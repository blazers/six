This is the code repository for SDFB. 

For the code to work, the expected working directory of R is THIS FOLDER. 

--------------------------------------------------
I will post [large] data files (those that might be allowed) in a different location, as to not misuse the online code repository. 

Data files belong to folder [data] or [private_data]. Code will attempt to reach files from this folder (or any of its subfolders) as necessary. 

Folders may have a <PLACEHOLDER> file; this is simply to create the directory in the code repository. 

--------------------------------------------------
Code content of the folders is the following: 
[/~]: No scripts should be in this directory. Sometimes various logs or images are generated here. 

[/data]: Data files

[/existing_networks]: Code to extract various data from websites, using minimal processing to obtain some sort of network.

[/figures]: Code to generate various figures (excluding network visualizations)

[/general_help_functions]: All sorts of relatively simple functions useful in many contexts.

[/metacode]: Code that processes all written code: One script extracts all to-do entries, another extracts all function documentation, etc. An overall todo list is stored here also. 

[/misc]: This folder organizes minor components to the project that do not warrant its own folder. 

[/network_estimation]: Code to estimate the network given processed data (ie document-count matrix)

[/network_visualization]: Code to generate plots in R, or commands to outsource to another program. 

[/private_data]: Data storage for files that are not share-able (due to copyright issues)

[/software]: Folder containing other software programs used

[/TEMP]: This folder may contain some temporary files generated by various scripts. 

[/text_mining]: This folder contains code to perform text extraction and processing, and conversion into intermediate forms (eg document-count matrix).

--------------------------------------------------
General conventions: 
Documentation: #@S, #@L, #@F denote short/long/function code documentation
Comments: remaning comments are standard #'s. 
To Do List: prefix with '# TODO:' (perhaps with spaces before)

Filename conventions: 
experiment_***.R => files that contain experimental code: these are not well documented, and might not work (in the sense that some variables might not have been defined here...) They were the result of either chunks of earlier code I wanted to keep, or just experiments with something. 
OLD_***.R => Old "legacy" code: Code kept for various reasons, but likely not used (due to updated versions). Most likely original code from various sources.
CLEAN_***.R => My older code that I am currently rewriting / refactoring
ONETIME_***.R => Old code that was run once for some purpose, and will likely never need again. Probably not well-written code; no sense in rewriting it.
