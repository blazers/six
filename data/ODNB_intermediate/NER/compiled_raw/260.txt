James Cunningham, sixth earl of Glencairn (c.1552-1630), participated in the Ruthven raid in 1582, but soon lost confidence in the new government and after its demise was reconciled to the king. In 1585, however, a Cunningham died in an attack on a Montgomery church, and shortly afterwards James signed a band with other kinsmen agreeing to protect whomever would assassinate Hugh Montgomery, fourth earl of Eglinton. The young earl, riding from Langshaw Tower, was ambushed and killed by Cunningham horsemen on either 18 or 20 April 1586. The Montgomerys retaliated by raiding Cunningham lands in the Irvine valley. Of the known murderers the laird of Clonbeith and the heir of Corsehill were killed within two years, while Robertland fled to Denmark to escape retribution; the laird of Aiket was finally shot in 1602. Kilwinning, who was implicated in the conspiracy, was shot outside his house in 1591, precipitating further violence between the kindreds, though support for the feud among the Cunninghams was never universal. 
The crown made repeated attempts to reconcile the families between 1595 and 1604. Then on 1 July 1606, while parliament was sitting in Perth, the earl of Glencairn and Sir Alexander Seton, master of Eglinton, passed on the high street in the evening and fighting broke out between their retinues, at the end of which one of Glencairn's servants lay dead. Following this disturbance the king renewed his efforts to end the feud and the parties finally submitted to a decreet arbitral of 16 March 1609. At its height the feud had undoubtedly caused real privation for some of the families of the participants, but any adverse consequences for the Cunningham kindred do not appear to have been lasting. Indeed the laird of Robertland's self-imposed exile proved prosperous, for in 1590 he returned to Scotland in the entourage of Anne of Denmark, to a knighthood and to the office of master stabler to the new queen. Glencairn himself was an active member of the privy council and acted as one of the commissioners in 1604 for the proposed union with England. He married, first, on 5 September 1574, Mariot or Margaret (died 1610), daughter of Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and mother of the seventh earl, and second, before 14 July 1612, Agnes, daughter of Sir James Hay of Kingask; she was formerly married to someone called Preston. Glencairn died after May 1630 and was briefly succeeded by his son

Hendrick Adriaen de Colonia (1668-1701/2), often called Adrian de Colonia, also became a painter with some contemporary reputation. Born on 17 April 1668, Hendrick probably trained with his father, and the chief source of his fame is the figures he inserted into landscapes painted by Adriaen van Diest, a Dutch artist working in London, who was also Hendrick's brother-in-law through his sister Huberta. He also drew a number of 'academy pieces' (Buckeridge, 407), and some landscapes, rougher in style than those of his father. He is reputed to have died, and been buried with his father in St Martin-in-the-Fields, in 1701 or 1702, aged thirty-three, but there is no record of this.

John Verelst (c.1675-1734), portrait painter, was probably the son of Harmen. Confusion arises because another John Verelst was father of two children in London in 1674 and 1682: this may have been Harmen's and Simon's brother, Johannes ('b'. 1648), whose profession is unknown. However, the painter John Verelst was most likely Harmen's son, as mentioned in the will of Lewis. His first surviving dated work was made in 1704. He and his wife, Anne, had at least seven children: Herman, Cicely, Adriana, George, James, Robert (father of Harry, governor of Bengal), and William Verelst (bap. 1704, d. 1752): this latter was also a portrait painter. John was buried on 10 March 1734 in the parish of St Christopher-le-Stocks, London.

James Brine (1812-1902) was born in Tolpuddle on 20 November 1812, the son of John Brine (1772-1829) and his wife, Catherine, 'nee' Parnacott ('b'. 1786). Brine and John Standfield were both unmarried at the time of the trial. 
Arrested in Tolpuddle on the morning of 24 February 1834 the men were marched in chains to Dorchester on charges of being present at an initiation ceremony where illegal oaths were administered during a meeting of a friendly society of agricultural labourers. This trade union had been formed in 1833, largely on George Loveless's initiative, in an attempt to resist wage cuts by local farmers. Evidence against the trade unionists was gathered by a spy who attended a meeting of the society in Thomas Standfield's cottage in December 1833, and the six men were made an example of to deter the further spread of union activity in the area. James Hammett was not present on the occasion in question, and seems to have been arrested in place of his brother John. The family connections within the group were such that one woman in the village, Diana Standfield, was wife of one of those arrested (Thomas Standfield), mother of another (John Standfield), and a sister of two of the others (the brothers George and James Loveless). Brine and Hammett were Anglicans, but the other four martyrs were all Methodists. George and James Loveless were local preachers, and George believed that he had been victimized as much for his Methodism as for his trade unionism. 
The men were held in Dorchester gaol until the opening of the spring assizes, and were tried in the county court at Dorchester on 17 March 1834, where the jury found them guilty; they were subsequently sentenced to transportation for seven years. After their conviction, the group was split up: George Loveless was taken ill and moved to a prison hospital, while the others were transferred to Portsmouth, and thence to Plymouth, before setting sail for Australia on 11 April. After four months at sea, they reached Sydney in August 1834, and were assigned as convict labour to various employers in New South Wales, walking long distances to reach the farms where they were to work. Meanwhile, George Loveless was finally judged well enough to travel in early April, and was kept in a prison hulk at Portsmouth for six weeks before boarding a ship bound for Van Diemen's Land, where he landed on 4 September and was put to work on a government farm. 
In England, agitation against the sentences began almost as soon as they were pronounced, and the outcry over the injustice of the case won the support of high-profile radical figures, including Daniel O'Connell, Fergus O'Connor, and William Cobbett. Less than a month after the trial the men were already being referred to as 'martyrs'. Petitions and demonstrations were organized, notably a mass gathering at Copenhagen Fields, from where thousands of protesters marched peacefully across London to Whitehall. Under the pressure of this campaign, the home secretary, Lord John Russell, granted the men conditional pardons in June 1835, followed by full pardons in March 1836. News of the full pardons reached Sydney at the end of August 1836, but the men were not informed directly and found out about them only by chance, remaining in assigned labour long after they should have been freed. George Loveless obtained a free passage at the end of January 1837, and was the first of the martyrs to return to England. He had already been back in England for two months by the time his brother, James Brine, and the two Standfields left Sydney in September, finally reaching Plymouth in March 1838, two full years after they had been granted free pardons. James Hammett remained in Australia until March 1839, having been on an assault charge when the others left Sydney; he was thus the last to return to England, in August 1839. 
The men were greeted with heroes' receptions on their return, attending processions, public dinners, and speaker meetings. A committee had been formed to support the men's families in their absence, and the London Dorchester Committee continued to raise funds to help establish the martyrs on farms of their own. In September 1837 George Loveless published a pamphlet, 'The Victims of Whiggery', which became an important text at Chartist meetings. Following the success of 'The Victims of Whiggery', the Dorchester Committee brought out 'A narrative of the sufferings of Jas. Loveless, Jas. Brine, and Thomas and John Standfield... displaying the horrors of transportation, written by themselves', which was published in 1838, with the profits going towards the fund. 
The Dorchester Committee raised enough money to obtain leaseholds on two farms in Essex, at Tilegate Green and Greensted, and the families moved there in August 1838, though their infamy assured them an unfriendly welcome from much of the local community. None of the men seems to have had much record of radical politics before the arrests, but following their return to England they took more political stances, establishing a Chartist association in Greensted, meetings of which were held in the Lovelesses' home, and which were the subject of complaints to the magistrate. The martyrs remained in Essex for several years, during which time the family connections were strengthened. James Brine married Thomas Standfield's daughter Elizabeth (1818-1906) at Greensted parish church on 20 June 1839. When Hammett at last arrived back in England, he and his wife and son moved to the Greensted farm, though in 1841 they returned to settle in Tolpuddle, where Hammett took up work in the building trade. 
In the mid-1840s the remaining five martyrs and their families emigrated to the province of Ontario, Canada, escaping the prejudice which they had encountered in Essex. The Brines left England in 1844, and began farming in Huron county. The Lovelesses settled near London, where George Loveless took out a mortgage on a farm of 100 acres and his brother James became the sexton of North Street Methodist Church. George Loveless later moved to another farm in Siloam and helped to build the Methodist church there. The Standfields emigrated in 1846 and also settled in London township. John Standfield, who had married Elizabeth Thurgood (1821-1883), daughter of John Thurgood, farmer, at Southwark on 4 July 1841, built a home called Dorset Hall and had a successful career as a storekeeper and hotelier, holding local public office and establishing a choir. In their new lives in Canada the men were determined to make a fresh start, and the story of their transportation remained a secret which they kept even from their younger children. 
All five men survived into old age, and all except James Loveless owned land in Canada. Thomas Standfield spent his later years living with his daughter Elizabeth, and died at Middlesex, Ontario, on 18 February 1864. James Loveless had three children, was widowed and later remarried, and died at Siloam, Ontario, on 16 February 1873 and was buried in the Methodist cemetery there. George Loveless died in 1874, six years after the death of his wife; they had five children. The couples Thomas and Diana Standfield and George and Betsy Loveless were buried in adjoining plots in Siloam cemetery. John Standfield died at London East, Ontario, on 28 September 1898, at the age of eighty-five, surviving his wife who had died fifteen years before; the couple had seven children, and were buried at Mount Pleasant cemetery in London, Ontario. The last survivor of the group was James Brine, who died at Blanshard township, Perth county, Ontario, on 11 August 1902. He had eleven children, eight of whom were born in Canada. He was buried in St Mary's cemetery in Blanshard township. 
James Hammett, the only one of the martyrs to return to Tolpuddle, was widowed three times. After the death of his first wife, he married second, in Tolpuddle on 6 September 1862, Charlotte (1832-1870), daughter of William Daniel, labourer. They had a daughter who died in infancy and a son. He married third, at Dorchester on 11 September 1875, a widow, Ann Frampton (1816/17-1877), daughter of Joseph Green, carpenter. She predeceased him. In 1875 he found himself briefly in the limelight once more, when the National Agricultural Labourers' Union presented him with an illuminated address and a gold watch to commemorate his service to the cause of trade unionism. His final years were less happy, as his sight deteriorated, and he chose to go into the workhouse at Fordington, Dorchester, so as not to be a burden on his family. He died there, of cerebral softening, on 21 November 1891, and was buried in the churchyard at Tolpuddle, where a headstone engraved by Eric Gill was erected in 1934. 
The case of the Dorchester Labourers, who in the early twentieth century were increasingly referred to as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, acquired an important place in the mythology of the trade-union movement, within Britain and on an international level. There were various schemes to commemorate the episode from the early years of the twentieth century onwards. Memorials were erected in Tolpuddle itself in the form of an arch outside the Methodist church (1912), a commemorative seat (1934), and a row of six cottages for retired agricultural workers, built and maintained by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and each bearing the name of one of the martyrs (1934). A Labor Memorial Park was dedicated to the memory of the martyrs in London, Ontario, in 1969. The men's story was dramatized on stage and on radio in the 1930s, and the TUC organized a major commemoration in 1934 for the hundredth anniversary of the trial. The labour movement in Britain has held annual rallies in Tolpuddle since 1934 to celebrate these most famous of its early pioneers, who are also commemorated in a museum in the village.

William Wyndham Malet (1803-1885), Church of England clergyman, who held a curacy in Bristol at the time Canon Sydney Smith secured him the living of Ardeley in Hertfordshire. Malet was instituted in 1843 and remained vicar there until his death. A man of firm opinions and acutely conscious of priestly office, he became something of a local character. The Hertfordshire historian J. E. Cussans recorded that 'Malet is one of the best men I ever met, but the manner in which he conducts his services strikes strangers with astonishment. He is an ultra Ritualist... [wearing]... all the vestments of a Roman Catholic priest' (Cussans, 104-5). At other times he wore the costume of a Benedictine monk and, although materially well off, he lived plainly and was generous towards the poor, for whom 'the doors of the vicarage are always open' (ibid.). William Upton's 'Survey of Hertfordshire Religions' in 1847-8 described Malet as 'Decidedly Puseyite' (Burg, 6). Not all of his parishioners agreed with his advocacy of increased money for poor relief, of higher agricultural wages, cheap coal for the poor, and the shifting of the burden of rates from the occupiers to the owners of the village's smaller cottages. Few country parish priests petitioned parliament and the monarch to the extent that he did. Such activities provoked friction between him and his vestry, which considered his sermons on poor relief as 'highly dangerous' and a subject for the bishop's attention. Tension also arose over the management of the church buildings and documents, and with the local squires, the Murrays of Ardeley Bury. Malet married Eliza, daughter of E. J. Esdaile, on 9 March 1837; they had four children. No appreciation was recorded on his death on 12 June 1885 after forty-two years' service to the parish. The interesting memorial window in the church was provided by his family and not through any effort of the vestry. Malet was the author of several works, including 'An Errand to South in the Summer of 1862' (1863) and 'The Olive Leaf: a Pilgrimage to Rome, Jerusalem and Constantinople in 1867' (1868).

She took up her mother's interest in the subjugated nations of Europe, in particular the cause of Poland. During the 1880s she sought to revive interest in the struggle for Polish independence by bringing the epic poems of Adam Mickiewicz to a wider English audience. In 1882 she published 'Konrad Wallenrode', a translation of his historical poem, which took as its theme the suppression of Lithuania by the Teutonic order -- a political allegory whose contemporary significance had escaped the Russian censors.

Educated at Ampleforth College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he served in the Royal Artillery, retiring with the rank of major in 1978. In 1976 he married Holly Isabel Barton; they had two daughters. He then became a stockbroker and headhunter, and in 1990 was appointed commanding officer of the Honourable Artillery Company (the territorial arm of the Royal Artillery) as lieutenant-colonel. He retired in 1996. Wingate was devoted to the memory of his father, from whom he inherited a strong facial resemblance; he defended his father's reputation -- which he considered traduced by the official history of the Burma campaign -- and was joint patron with the prince of Wales of the Chindits Old Comrades Association. Nevertheless, in 1996 he sold at auction his father's papers and medals. Wingate was a complex, emotional man, prone to brooding and to expressing his views forcibly, but also impulsive, affectionate, and encouraging. He died on 6 September 2000, survived by his wife and their two daughters.

Katherine Mary Chapman (1883-1948), who had first matriculated from Glasgow University in 1894. The daughter of John Henry Chapman, a barrister in Cheltenham, Katherine Chapman did not graduate until 1903 when she gained the triple qualification from the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow. Later she worked in the electrical department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, the first radiography department in the world. She became head of department -- the first woman to achieve such a position in a major Scottish teaching hospital -- and university lecturer in radiology, electrotherapy, and diagnosis. She retired from these positions in 1928 and set up practice in the West End of London. She died unmarried at Cardross in Dunbartonshire in May 1948. Marion Gilchrist wrote a touching notice in the 'Glasgow Herald' in which she praised her friend's pastoral care as much as her clinical skills. Their relationship had remained formal to a fault. To the end they never addressed each other than as Dr Gilchrist or Dr Chapman.

Sir Alexander Lindsay of Glenesk (d. 1382), the beneficiary of his elder brother's grant, served in his youth as squire to his cousin Thomas Stewart, earl of Angus. He had inherited his mother's lands north of Tay, and also received grants from his aunt Margaret, countess of Angus, which effectively reconstituted the Abernethy inheritance. About 1358, moreover, he married Catherine Stirling (died by 1378), daughter and coheir of John Stirling of Glenesk, whose estates in the sheriffdoms of Forfar and Inverness were entailed on him and their joint heirs. His lands of Byres he entailed to his younger brother William in January 1367 ['see 'Lindsay family of the Byres (per. 1367-1526)]. Active as a crusader and jouster, Sir Alexander was high in David II's favour, while after 1371 he was equally close to Robert II, whose niece Marjory Stewart he married, probably about the time of Robert's accession. He attended Robert's coronation, together with his nephew James Lindsay of Crawford ['see below'] (the son of Sir James and Egidia), and became a regular charter witness for the new king, as he had been for David II. It may also have been in 1371 that he was made justiciar north of Forth jointly with his nephew; they were certainly acting in this capacity by 1373, though from 1374 Alexander Lindsay held this office on his own. In 1375 he arranged for his son and heir, David, to marry the king's daughter Elizabeth. He retained royal favour and the justiciarship until 1381, when he set off on pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Granted a safe conduct on 4 December to travel through England, he died on Crete some time before March 1382.

Thomas Petre, sixth Baron Petre (bap. 1633, d. 1707), was born at Ingatestone and baptized on 5 December 1633, the fourth of the five sons of Robert, third Baron Petre (1599-1638), and his wife, Mary Browne ('c'.1604-1685). He was a nephew of the translator William Petre (1602-1678). Thomas's elder brothers William Petre, fourth Baron Petre (1625/6-1684), and John, fifth Baron Petre (died 1685), having died without male heirs, he succeeded to the title in January 1685. In the following year he married the sixteen-year-old Mary (died 1730), daughter of Sir Thomas Clifton, of Latham, Lancashire. In February 1688 James II appointed him lord lieutenant of Essex in place of Aubrey de Vere, twentieth earl of Oxford, following the latter's refusal to give unconditional support to the king. The warrant dispensed with the need for Petre to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, or to receive the Anglican sacrament. At about the same time nine other Essex Catholics were appointed justices of the peace: it appears that although none of those appointed was unworthy of the office, James could not have gone on to appoint more Catholics without lowering the social standing and influence of the Essex bench. Following publication of the declaration of indulgence in April, Lord Petre visited some fifty deputy lieutenants and justices to ask whether they would support abolition of the penal laws and the 'Test Act'. The response was generally equivocal, only twelve of those questioned being prepared to comply with the king's wishes. Members of the gentry began refusing to accept militia commissions at his hands, and Lord Petre, finding his position untenable, relinquished office by October and retired from political life. He died on 5 January 1707, and was buried on 10 January at Ingatestone. His widow died at Ghent on 15 February 1730 and was buried in the chapel of the English Benedictine convent there.

Anna Maria Barbara Petre, Lady Petre (1716-1760) was (after 1731) the only surviving child of James Radcliffe, third earl of Derwentwater (1689-1716), who was executed for his part in the 1715 rising (and who had been another of Catherine's disappointed suitors in 1711-12). Her mother was Mary Tudor (died 1723), daughter of Charles II. Anna was passionately devoted to her father's memory, and ordered her children to keep his apparel with respect and veneration in the mahogany chest she had had specially made. Derwentwater's body was eventually reburied at Thorndon Hall in October 1874. Her only son (following three daughters), Robert Edward Petre, ninth Baron Petre (1742-1801), was about five months old when his father died, and she was his guardian until she too died, on 31 March 1760; she was buried on 4 April 1760 at Ingatestone.

Margaret Ogilvy, Lady Ogilvy (1724-1757)], daughter of Sir James Johnstone, baronet, of Westerhall, Lanarkshire, and niece of Patrick Murray, Lord Elibank; they had a son, David, who did not assume the title, and two daughters. Not only did Lady Ogilvy share in the hardships of the army in Scotland, she also took an active part in the campaign, 'standing upon the Cross of Cupar in Angus with a drawn sword in her hand' on one occasion (Seton and Arnot, 3.238-9). The anti-Jacobite tract 'The Female Rebels' (1747) described her as an exemplar of the 'unwomanly' qualities of female Jacobitism, exchanging 'delicacy of sentiment, mercy, tenderness, and compassion, the peculiar ornaments of the fair sex' for the immoral and wanton activities of the 'wild transports of lawless ambition, the lust of power, cruelty, revenge' (Mackenzie, 247). Ogilvy's Forfarshire regiment (which later included a second battalion raised under Sir James Kinloch when Ogilvy was in England) is the best-attested of all the Jacobite units, since a detailed regimental order book survives (printed in volume one of the Spalding Club 'Miscellany' in 1841). Its maximum strength was about 800, and it is instructive to note that the names of many ordinary lowland small-town tradesmen and merchants appear on its muster roll. Chosen as one of the prince's council of war and privy council, Ogilvy was among the majority who expressed reservations concerning Charles's conduct during the rising, being also (with Elcho and Lord George Murray) highly critical of the prince's Irish advisers. Despite the composition of his own regiment, he was also disappointed at the lack of greater lowland support. Irritated by being allotted what he deemed the 'dirty work' of command of the baggage train after the fall of Carlisle (McLynn, 'Jacobite Army', 46), he threatened to resign his commission. At Derby he was among the foremost of those arguing for a retreat at the council of war.

Fanny Elizabeth Vining (1829-1891?) was born in London on 17 July 1829, the daughter of Charles Frederick Vining and a Miss Johnstone. It seems unlikely that this is the same Fanny Vining, for she would not have been fourteen years old on her marriage to Gill, and the marriage certificate declares them both to be of full age. It seems probable that this is the Fanny Vining (whose relationship to the other Vinings is not clear) who married Edward (or Edgar) Loomis Davenport (1816-1877), an American actor, in January 1849, and died in 1891. It is likely that the Miss Fanny Vining who appeared with Alfred Wigan's company at the Olympic in 1849 in a production of 'The Two Gentlemen of Verona' was the one who married Davenport, whom she accompanied to New York, and appeared with him in leading roles until his death. They had nine children, six of whom had careers on the stage, principally in the United States, most successfully Fanny Lily Gipsy Davenport (1850-1898), who had her own company, and Harry George Bryant Davenport (1866-1949), who, in 1912, became one of the first movie actors.

John Poyntz (fl. 1639-1665), also a naval officer, was recommended by Admiral Robert Blake, in the reorganization of the fleet early in 1653, for naval employment as a clerk of the cheque, on the basis of his fourteen years' service at sea -- presumably all or mostly in the merchant service. Having been clerk of the cheque in the 'Happy Entrance' (April 1653) and lieutenant of the 'Dover' on William Penn's expedition to the West Indies (1654), he was lieutenant of the 'Portland' in the West Indies (April 1655) and became captain of the fly-boat 'Mary' (or 'Mayfly'). He wrote to the council of state (15 November 1656) about settling planters from Nevis, St Kitts, and New England on Jamaica, and, on his return from the West Indies in March 1657, Poyntz certified (5 March) that, in the 'Mayfly', he had settled 1500 planters, including the governor of Nevis, around Port Morant, Jamaica. This activity suggests he may have been a kinsman of Sydenham Poyntz, who was governor of the Leeward Islands (1650-51) and, though he effectively disappears from history at that date, was possibly a resident of Antigua in the 1650s and was mentioned as governor of Antigua as late as 1661-3.

William Corden the younger (1819-1900), painter, was born in Derby, where he was baptized at St Alkmund's Church on 19 August 1819; he moved with his family to Windsor in 1829. He studied and worked with his father and they travelled together to Coburg in 1844 where he painted six watercolour views of the town for Prince Albert. The younger Corden was sent to Lisbon in 1850 by Queen Victoria and the prince to copy the portrait of Ferdinand, king consort of Portugal, by Ferdinand Krumholz. Instead it was arranged that he should himself paint full-lengths of Queen Maria II and her husband (Royal Collection). Corden was constantly employed by Queen Victoria to copy portraits in her collection, usually as presents. These included about fifty by F. X. Winterhalter and others by such artists as H. von Angeli, A. Graefle, H. R. Graves, G. Koberwein, R. Lauchert, J. Lucas, and J. Sant. Corden also painted photographs of watercolours for the queen. He exhibited eight works, including subject pictures, at the Royal Academy, between 1843 and 1855, and one at the British Institution. He married on 4 August 1857 Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Francis Burt, alderman and grocer, of Windsor. They had at least two sons and one daughter.

Joan Staunford (fl. 1379), who leased one of the stalls at the Cheapside Cross, can be more precisely identified. She was a frutestere, a seller of fruit, with an eight-year-old son but, apparently, deserted by her husband. In October of the year in which his mother had leased the stall, young John had been bequeathed 40's'. in the will of John Cornwaille, a currier. In order that she might receive the money on her son's behalf, in December 1379 the mayor and chamberlain entrusted Joan with the guardianship of John and the 40's'., also providing two men to act as her sureties. Sixteen years later, when John would have been twenty-four, he came to court to seek his 40's'. By this time his mother and one of her sureties were dead, so the court decided that the money should be levied from the tenements of the remaining surety. Hucksters were quite often in trouble in the mayor's court, not least when they engaged in the ubiquitous trade of selling secondhand clothing. Fourteen of the sixty-eight Londoners convicted in 1321 of selling clothes at the evening markets held at Cornhill and in Cheapside (contrary to civic regulation because it was too dark to examine the goods properly) were women. 
Women hucksters were also sometimes convicted of deliberately practising to deceive the ignorant customer.

Alison Boston (fl. 1424) was prosecuted by the city authorities and convicted not for being a prostitute herself but for having taken on a girl as an apprentice whom she then hired out for 'immoral purposes'.

Displayed alongside her was a bill written in English to explain her offence, and this was carefully copied into the city's letter-book. 
The city authorities may have been anxious to make a public example of Alison Boston because she had betrayed the trust and obligations required of the mistress of an apprentice. As early as 1276 girl apprentices were found in the city, but the surge in their numbers came in the century after 1350, when thirty-eight are recorded. It is remarkable, considering how few medieval apprentice indentures survive, that five of the thirteen from London concern girls.

The Rotheleys had several apprentices but do not appear always to have treated them well. Anne had been married before to another goldsmith, Richard Spencer (died 1442x5), and in this marriage also had traded 'sole' as a silk throwster and taken on apprentices. One of these, Joan Bosoun, the daughter of another goldsmith, sued Anne for failing to enrol her indentures at the guildhall within the first year of her term. William Rotheley served several times as warden between 1444 and 1465, but in 1468 he was fined by the Goldsmiths' court for having shut his 'mayde' (perhaps a reference to one of his wife's apprentices) out of his house at night, so that she had to borrow money to buy a night's lodging at the Pewter Pot. Such behaviour was thought to reflect badly on the Goldsmiths' fellowship and to be 'against all humanity', and Rotheley was fined 3's'. 4died 
The city authorities repeatedly showed themselves concerned to ensure that apprentices were properly treated, and their indentures enrolled at the guildhall within the first year of their service. Such precautions were needed not least because girl apprentices might be very young.

Agnes Tickhill (fl. 1410-1417), the daughter of the successful saddler William Tickhill, was placed as an apprentice with the wiredrawer William Celler for a term of fourteen years. This apprenticeship had been arranged by Thomasina March, a widow not free of the city who lived in Buckinghamshire. In 1417 William Tickhill, claiming that his daughter had been indentured without his knowledge or consent, complained that William Celler had left the city and had not taught Agnes his craft, nor had he enrolled her indentures at the guildhall. Agnes was now living with William Celler's wife, Joan, who claimed to be teaching her the craft of a cardmaker (for carding wool) for which she had been properly apprenticed the previous Christmas. Joan admitted that Agnes had originally been apprenticed under age, that Thomasina March had no authority over the girl, and that her indentures had not been enrolled at the beginning of her term. Having decided to examine Joan and Agnes separately, the court learnt that Agnes, who was still under age, had sealed the indentures at Christmas only because she was threatened with a beating, and that she would prefer to return to her father. She was therefore released from her indentures. If she was still under age (younger than fourteen) in 1417, then Agnes can have been only six or seven when first apprenticed to the Cellers in 1410. 
Parents valued apprenticeship for their daughters because it provided girls with patrons and business contacts and secured for them status and authority within the working community. It was an investment for the future, raising the prospect of a 'better class' of husband (probably a citizen of London), while enabling the woman thus trained to keep herself either within, or following, her marriage. Many more girls, however, would have worked as servants for an annual wage. Such women might or might not have lived in their employers' households, and their commitment would have been short-term, under arrangements rarely formalized in writing. Because the mayor and aldermen were not directly responsible for contracts between masters and servants, cases involving female servants rarely appear in the records of the city courts, but a few cases were brought by petition to the attention of the lord chancellor.

Describing herself on this occasion as 'of London, gentilwoman' (TNA: PRO, C 1/61/377), she may have been the Joan Chamberlain, 'widow, citizen, brewer and freewoman' who drew up her will in 1504 (Sharpe, 2.644). If so, her stand against her employer earlier in her career suggests that she was a woman of mettle, just as her will attests her business success -- it includes a bequest of $20 to be held in trust for the marriage of her niece, then acting as Joan's own servant. 
Masters, too, might feel aggrieved.

Alice Shevyngton (fl. late 15th cent.) had worked for William Gregory (probably a skinner) for three years on annual contracts and received 16's'. per annum. But although Gregory paid her wages regularly, in the fourth year Alice absented herself from his household for days and weeks at a time, 'pretending herself to have connyng in the tretyng of sore ighen [eyes]' (TNA: PRO, C 1/66/264). To prevent her master from taking action against her, Alice was herself suing him for debt, and such was her popularity in the community that Gregory doubted whether he would be able to secure a fair trial. It is not easy to understand why Gregory was so upset. He may have been old and ill, but he may also have resented Alice's independent stance. Servants might be of the same age as apprentices, but they could also be considerably older, and as such skilled, knowledgeable, married, and independent. Their relationship with their masters and mistresses was that of employer and employee, rather than that between a surrogate parent and child envisaged in apprentice indentures. 
It was unusual for women in medieval London to remain unmarried. A married woman could choose to trade as a feme sole independently of her husband and thus take on her own apprentices, run her own business, lease property, and sue and be sued for debt. But both husband and wife had to be free of the city. Both as wives and as widows women claimed to be freewomen of the city, with a status that carried privileges both within the city and further afield. The earliest reference to a widow identifying herself thus occurs in the will of

Katherine, together with her sister Alice, was later in dispute with her father's executors about the administration of his estate, and she may have asserted her status as a freewoman in her will in order to make more secure her bequest of a tenement to Elsyngspital at Cripplegate. 
It may have been that women only really needed to trade as femes soles when they chose to follow crafts different from those of their husbands, since if they followed the same craft it would have been difficult to distinguish the trade of one from that of the other. Many of the women who brewed as femes soles, for instance, were married to men who practised other crafts. Where a woman is found as a feme sole following the same craft as her husband it is usually as a widow who has taken over her husband's business.

Isabelle Sayer (d. 1473) came before the mayor and aldermen and said that she practised the art of a silkwoman and no other, and asked to be allowed to 'merchandise' without her husband, and to answer 'sole' for her own contracts according to city custom. This was granted and entered as a record. Some time later Isabelle seems to have left the city and moved to West Bedfont in Stanwell, Middlesex, where she drew up her modest but self-sufficient will in 1473. She left the residue of her goods to her son William but made no mention of a husband. By her craft she had been able to maintain her independence and make bequests to the parish church, to various lights there, and to the fraternity of the Virgin. 
Most of the women who appeared in the mayor's court to answer pleas of debt were probably doing business on quite a small scale. They may none the less have been able to read and write. There is good evidence that London women could write English, and doubtless read it also.

Joan Coggenhoe (fl. 1423) was sufficiently skilled at writing to be able to forge a deed, and was consequently condemned to stand next to the pillory (not actually in it because she was too old), while a text of her forgery, together with an explanation of Joan's crime, was to be hung around her neck. There is a presumption in this case, as in that of the procuress Alison Boston, that those who saw these women in the pillory would be able to read the accounts of their offences that were displayed with them. And the groups that gathered round such ill doers in the market place would certainly have included women, at whom these deterrent accounts would have been particularly directed. 
In the case of other women, whose business dealings were substantial, the presumption of literacy is even stronger.

Agnes Ramsey (d. in or after 1399), the daughter of the famous master mason William Ramsey, and whose husband, Robert Huberd, was also a mason, ran her father's business after his death in 1349, and drew up a contract with Edward II's widow, Queen Isabella, for the construction of Edward's tomb in the London Greyfriars at a cost of over $100. Styled 'Domina Agnes Ramsey' in the accounts from 1377 of the fraternity of the Holy Trinity in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate (where her father's workshop and her own was situated), Agnes continued to collect her father's debts and to engage in property transactions until 1399.

Matilda Penne (d. 1392/3) as the widow of a skinner ran her late husband William's business for twelve years after his death. From her shop in Wood Street she maintained contacts with other citizens engaged in the clothing trade, and there she trained her own apprentices and employed male servants (and also, perhaps, a female scrivener to keep the accounts). A woman of convinced piety, she based her religious life upon St Peter's Church, Wood Street, and it was there that she required to be buried. In her will, drawn up on 4 November 1392 and proved on 3 February 1393, Matilda remembered forty-three people, twenty men and twenty-three women, ranging from the wives of city aldermen to monks of Westminster Abbey to little-known neighbours. Disposing of cash bequests totalling between $60 and $70, and of valuable plate and furnishings, it is a document that testifies both to her independence and to her success in trading as 'a woman skinner, a shopkeeper and craftswoman in her own right' (Veale, 54). 
The workshops of founders (who made brass pots as well as church bells) were quite often managed by women. Twice during the fifteenth century the notable bell foundry outside Aldgate was run by widows who added a distinctive lozenge to the mark of their late husbands to signify the change of management.

When he died in 1440 Joan took over the business, for instance entering into a contract with the parishioners of Faversham to cast five new bells for their church and to remake any bells found to be defective. In her own will, made less than a year later, Joan made bequests to four male apprentices, two female servants, six male servants, four further men whose tasks were not specified, a specialized 'bell-maker', a clerk, and the daughter of another founder. She left her bell-making equipment to her daughter, another Joan, and the latter's husband, Henry Jordan, and clearly expected that they would carry on the business.

Joan Reynold (d. 1483) was the widow of Robert Reynold, a master of the craft who had died in 1476. She continued to run the business for another six years and in her will made bequests of tools to named servants and apprentices. Whereas her husband gave a maser weighing 9 ounces to the Founders' Company, Joan gave a double cup with a handle 'over gilted' weighing twice as much. These and others like them were remarkable women, who made their mark in the commercial world of London and won respect within their social milieux. 
The surviving records of the craft guilds and companies acknowledge the presence of women within the craft structure, but their role was not a formal one. Much of the evidence relates to women sharing in the religious, charitable, and social aspects of company life. The Skinners prayed for dead sisters as well as brothers of the craft, and the ordinances of many crafts and companies refer to sisters as well as brothers. Women who prospered through their links with the crafts remembered the latter in their wills.

Joan Bradbury (c.1450-1530) married as her second husband the mercer Thomas Bradbury. It was probably with her encouragement that he started to become closely involved in the government of the city, culminating in his election as mayor in 1509. His death in office early in 1510 led to his widow's endowing a perpetual chantry for his soul (and also for that of her first husband, Thomas Bodley (died 1492), a merchant tailor) in the church of St Stephen, Coleman Street. The Mercers' Company agreed to act as its trustees, and in return Joan gave her 'great house' in Cheapside for use as the company hall. A woman of strong personality and considerable managerial abilities, her charitable activities extended to the endowment of a grammar school at Walden, Essex, where her brother was vicar. But although it is clear that the social activities of the companies included women -- the Mercers several times held their St Thomas's tide banquet in Joan Bradbury's house before it was finally conveyed to them -- the participation of women in the craft and trade organization of London was not confined solely to their charitable and social functions. Many guilds acknowledged that it was desirable to encourage widows to continue to maintain the workshops or businesses of their dead husbands and to train their apprentices. It is apparent that tanners left the tools of their craft, and their stalls in the establishment known as the Tanner's Seld, to their widows almost always in trust for their children, or on condition that these widows married within the craft: they were guardians of a communal resource. 
In the fifteenth century, when labour was scarce, crafts and trades recognized, albeit grudgingly, the presence of women workers within their guilds and companies. In this respect the Brewers' Company may, however, have been unusual; in the early fifteenth century a third of all brewers paying quarterage to the company were women.

Agnes Bugge (fl. 1417-1430), the wife of the draper Stephen Bugge, paid her dues independently to the Brewers' Company throughout the 1420s. When Stephen died in 1428-30 he bequeathed 'his' brewhouse to his widow, and in law it was undoubtedly his property, yet it is clear that it was she who had been the brewer while he was active as a draper. Agnes's success in her profession may be deduced from her response to the 'voluntary assessment' whereby in 1419/20 the brewers raised money to fund a dispute with the city authorities; at 20's'. hers was the largest single contribution. Companies that recognized the existence of women workers over and above the wives and daughters sometimes specified in their ordinances were, nevertheless, apt to restrict their access to craft skills. If women sometimes flourished as traders and artisans, this owed much to their ability to create informal networks of female friends, servants, apprentices, daughters, dependants, and patrons, networks that supplemented the formal craft relationships. In the same way women very seldom held public office, in the sense of office in which they might have been placed in authority over a man. It was exceptional that in 1372 women were sworn alongside their husbands to supervise the dyeing of leather. 
In 1422 the jurors of Queenhythe complained that the official measurer of oysters, John Ely, had farmed his office to women 'who know not [how to do it]; nor is it worship to this city that women should have such things in governance' (Thomas and Jones, 3.138-9). In spite of this attitude there were occasions when widows were allowed to carry on their husbands' official posts.

Alice Holford (d. 1455) acted as bailiff of London Bridge for over twenty years after the death of her husband, Nicholas, 'citizen and textwriter', in 1434. The bailiff collected the tolls due from boats passing through the bridge and from carts crossing over it into London, a complicated task since the charges varied according to the goods and the person transporting them. In her will, drawn up in May 1455, Alice left a missal (which may have been the work of her late husband) for the chapel on the bridge, but only on condition that the master and bridgewards granted the house in which she had lived there to her son Nicholas, at the same rent (32's'. per annum) that she had paid. The bridgewards were also to pay 5 marks to her executors. In a world in which masculine control was usually taken for granted, the firm, almost commanding, tone of Alice's will suggests a woman confident of her authority and bargaining power.

For much of the next fifty-seven years Edgar Mocatta was the City's leading authority on the bullion market and was dubbed the 'silver king'. This reputation was won through transactions such as the 1913 rescue of the Indian Specie Bank, which was hopelessly over-extended through massive silver speculation, and through co-ordinating silver purchases of allied governments during the First World War. The British and Indian governments, together with the Bank of England, frequently sought his advice and confidential execution of sensitive transactions. He married in 1913 Mabel, daughter of Alfred Beddington of Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, London. 
In 1957, after several difficult years for the London bullion market consequent to the effects of world war and changing patterns of demand and market procedures, the Mocattas sold their business to Hambros Bank ending almost 300 years of business as an independent entity. Edgar then joined Hambros' board but died at his London office, 7 Throgmorton Avenue, London Wall, on 30 September that year. 
The Mocatta family, in particular Abraham [i] and his grandson Abraham [ii], dominated the London bullion market for most of the eighteenth century and thereafter played an influential part in it until the 1950s. Having accumulated wealth they were inevitably distracted into other areas of life and here their role, especially that of Frederic, in promoting Jewish culture was significant.

Sir William Babthorpe (c.1490-1555), son of William Babthorpe and Christina Sothill; succeeding his father aged eleven in 1501, he then became a ward of the crown. He was a lawyer who served as a legal member of the council in the north from 1525 until his death. He was a thrusting and ambitious man, and his steady accumulation of offices in the East Riding made him a powerful figure there. These covered a wide range of functions: commissioner for musters, justice of the peace, and 'custos rotulorum'; steward of the lordship of Beverley; constable of Wressle Castle and steward and master forester of Wressle (offices in the gift of the earls of Northumberland who employed him as a legal adviser); and steward of Howden and Howdenshire. In April 1536 he was named as one of the commissioners for surveying the lands and goods of the dissolved religious foundations in the East Riding, but in October he joined the leaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace, a decision which owed much to the influence of his kinsman Robert Aske, and it was no doubt with his connivance that Wressle Castle became the rebels' headquarters. When it became clear that the uprising had failed, however, Babthorpe rapidly changed sides. In January 1537 he sought to prevent another uprising in the East Riding, and in May he was appointed as one of the special commissioners who were responsible for processing the indictments against his former associates. His initial stance did him no harm: he continued as a member of the council in the north and was able to purchase a considerable amount of monastic property, including the manor of Flotmanby, and to acquire leases of the rectories of Drax and Adlingfleet. 
That Babthorpe was a politically important figure is demonstrated by his election to the parliaments of 1547 and April 1554 as one of the Yorkshire knights of the shire. At the coronation of Edward VI in 1547 he was made a knight of the Bath.

Sir William Babthorpe (c.1529-1581), apparently received some part of his education at the Middle Temple in London and was knighted in 1560 by the duke of Norfolk at Berwick while serving in his expeditionary force. Sir William was married twice, first to Barbara, daughter of Sir Robert Constable of Everingham, and then, in 1564, to Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Dawney of Sessay, and from these two marriages he had one son and four daughters. 
In a report on the Yorkshire justices of the peace which was compiled in 1564 Sir William was described as a man who was no favourer of religion as established by the Elizabethan settlement. In April 1565 Archbishop Young of York was in correspondence with Sir William Cecil about Babthorpe's unseemly talk, as he termed it, which was regarded as highly inflammatory. Cecil had already rebuked Babthorpe and his associates, and the archbishop assured him that they were now in great awe and obedience. When the northern rising broke out in 1569 Babthorpe demonstrated his loyalty by joining the royal army under the earl of Sussex. 
As a suspected recusant Sir William came under pressure from the northern high commission. In 1580 he produced a certificate of conformity for himself and his family but admitted that his wife refused to go to church. A few months later he was entertaining Edmund Campion. In his will Babthorpe gave direction that he should be buried in the family chapel at Hemingbrough parish church. Although he was basically dependent on his estate revenue he had managed to buy some additional property, including the manor of Bowthorpe. He died in 1581.

Sir William Babthorpe (1580-1635), the eldest son, refused to go to church while a pupil at a clandestine school. In 1599 he was enrolled as a student at Gray's Inn in London. Not long afterwards he married Ursula Tyrwhitt, the daughter of a Roman Catholic squire seated in Lincolnshire, with whom he had six sons and four daughters. Of his three brothers Robert became a Benedictine monk, and Ralph and Thomas entered the Society of Jesus after studying at the English colleges at St Omer and Rome. His sister Barbara joined the Institution of the Blessed Virgin Mary which had been founded by her cousin Mary Ward (who had been brought up at Osgodby Hall) and eventually held the office of superioress-general. 
During Elizabeth's reign Ralph Babthorpe thought it expedient as head of the family to hide his religious sympathies under the cloak of outward conformity. For some years the family was left in peace, but in 1592 Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, the lord president of the council in the north, launched a vigorous campaign against the recusant wives of well-to-do squires who were church papists. On 25 March the northern high commission under Huntingdon's chairmanship ordered Babthorpe to have daily prayers in his house as appointed in the 'Book of Common Prayer', and to allow no recusants under his roof. Subsequently, on 13 April, his wife was taken into custody and was sent to Sheriff Hutton Castle where, with other gentlewomen, she was kept a prisoner for almost two years. 
Despite his wife's refusal to conform, Babthorpe appears to have emerged from this episode without any damage to his reputation; it is significant that in 1595, for example, he was serving as a deputy lieutenant. In 1603 he was one of many Yorkshire gentlemen knighted by James I on his journey south, and his son William probably received his knighthood at the same time. 
Shortly before the accession of James I, Grace Babthorpe persuaded her husband to abandon his conformity by encouraging him to read two books which advanced the claims of the Roman Catholic church, to which he was consequently reconciled, though only gradually did his conversion become a matter of public knowledge. In a survey of Yorkshire Catholics carried out in 1604 it was noted that Sir Ralph and Sir William Babthorpe had recusant wives but that they themselves were only non-communicants. In 1607, however, the crown granted the benefits of Sir Ralph's recusancy to James, Lord Colville, who had to be bought off. Two years later Babthorpe managed to secure a lease of his estate at the modest rent of $62 12's'. a year, which was subsequently reduced to $50. At the same time his new-found commitment had other consequences for him. From 1607 onwards he was frequently summoned to appear before the northern high commission, and on hearing that a warrant was on its way he took flight in order to escape the fine which would otherwise have been imposed. Sir William was then living in Lincolnshire, outside the jurisdiction of the commission, and after a while he was joined there by his father and the rest of the family. 
The religious activities at Osgodby Hall were described by Father James Sharpe, a former chaplain, in an account written in 1610. According to this account all the servants were Roman Catholics and there were always two chaplains, one serving the household and the other looking after the spiritual needs of neighbouring families. On work days the normal schedule consisted of masses at 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., evensong, and matins, while on Sundays there were sermons and other additional features. 
In 1612 the government decided that the leading recusants in each county should be called before the privy council and tendered the oath of allegiance which denounced the pope's deposing power. For anyone refusing the oath the statutory penalty was imprisonment for life and forfeiture of all property. The Babthorpe knights were both included in the Yorkshire list, but Sir Ralph had already departed for the continent and his son may also have taken avoiding action. Sir Ralph and his wife eventually settled at Louvain, where in 1618 he died of a stroke while engaged in spiritual exercises. Three years later Lady Babthorpe became a nun at the convent of St Monica in Louvain, where she died in 1635. 
At the height of his prosperity Sir Ralph enjoyed a landed income of some $1300 a year and maintained an establishment of thirty servants or more. Although the manor of Bowthorpe had been sold in 1604 the estate was still largely intact at the time of his death. Within the next three years, however, Sir William disposed of virtually the whole of his patrimony. Such a financial catastrophe, which was without parallel among the recusant gentry of Yorkshire, can have been the product only of special factors. Probably the most important of these was an episode described in his mother's account of the family. She relates that when two priests were discovered in his house Sir William managed to hold off the pursuivants seeking to arrest them until they were safely away. As a result he was imprisoned for nearly a year and was forced to pay such a heavy fine that he was reduced to great poverty. 
Having lost his houses at Osgodby and Babthorpe Sir William moved to his remaining property at Flotmanby, but in 1633 this too was sold. Now completely landless, he joined the Spanish army in the Netherlands and quickly attained the rank of captain. He was killed in 1635 while fighting against the French near Ardres in the Pas-de-Calais.

He was a full fellow of New College from 1476 to 1479. Between 1487 and 1489 he provided legal counsel to Magdalen College, Oxford. The Middle Temple admitted him in 1489. From 1492 to 1504 he served as steward of Winchester College. Returned to parliament for Heytesbury, Wiltshire, in 1491, he became a JP for Hampshire in 1493, a position he retained until his death, and in the same year began to try cases in the court of requests. By 1494 he was a bencher of the Middle Temple and on 12 November 1495 he became a serjeant-at-law. In 1497 he became a king's serjeant. By 1499 he had gained a national reputation for his 'authority and worship' as a fine but expensive lawyer. Henry VII appointed him a justice of common pleas on 2 July 1504, and chief justice for Lancaster on 9 January 1507. 
Richard Kingsmill established another important connection for his son by arranging his marriage with Jane, daughter of John Gifford of Ichell, Hampshire, under a contract of 10 August 1490. While the Giffords were not among the most prominent of Hampshire's gentry, they occupied a more prestigious position than the Kingsmills, and John Gifford rightly saw John [i] Kingsmill as a young man of potential. John Kingsmill's marriage to Jane Gifford produced four children: John; Alice, who married Thomas Bullock of Arborfield, Berkshire; Mary, who married Richard Waller of Oldstoke, Hampshire; and Morpheta, a nun who became prioress and then abbess of Wherwell Abbey, Hampshire. Their father died on 11 May 1509, having lived long enough to leave his family with good local and national connections.

Sir John [ii] Kingsmill (c.1497-1556) maintained the upward social momentum established by his father, whom he followed into a legal career. He entered Lincoln's Inn in October 1516 and was called to the bar on 9 May 1521. It was also in 1521 that he took the momentous step of marrying Constance (died 1580/81), the daughter of John Goring of Burton, Sussex, and the sister of William Goring. Although the Gorings were only a modest family of Sussex gentry, the connection had important long-term results. First, another Goring daughter, Anne, married Richard Gifford, strengthening the Kingsmill-Gifford family alliance. Second, the Gorings were early protestants, and the influence of Constance and Anne helped bring both the Kingsmill and Gifford families into the reforming movement. Third, William Goring became an ally of Thomas Cromwell and helped to introduce his Kingsmill brother-in-law into that important political connection by the early 1530s. Fourth, by 1537 Kingsmill acquired the manor of Litchfield from the Gorings, his first substantial property in Hampshire. 
By 1530 John Kingsmill's career was starting to blossom. Knighted in that year by Henry VIII, he became steward of Mottisfont Priory in Hampshire. In 1533 he became involved in local government, serving as commissioner to inquire about wastes committed in various forests. He was appointed a JP in 1537, continuing to hold that office until his death, and served as sheriff of Hampshire in 1538-9 and 1543-4. During the late 1530s he worked closely with Cromwell's protege Thomas Wriothesley, and both men greatly benefited from the dissolution of the monasteries. Kingsmill's acquisitions included the manors of Sandford and Woodcott and also, in 1540, the rich manor of Sidmonton, which replaced Barkham as the family's principal residence. 
During 1539 Kingsmill worked hard as sheriff to assure the election of Cromwell's candidates as Hampshire's representatives in parliament. As a result he earned the enmity of the conservative Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester. Nevertheless after the fall of Cromwell in 1540 Kingsmill remained active in local government and was sheriff again in 1543-4. Under Edward VI he was a commissioner for the dissolution of chantries in 1548. Queen Mary pardoned him for offences committed prior to 1 October 1553, and thereafter he was inactive in local government and politics. 
Sir John [ii] Kingsmill left a large, successful, and staunchly protestant family when he died on 11 August 1556, although the significance of his legacy was not immediately apparent in the unfavourable atmosphere of the Marian restoration of Catholicism. During summer 1558 Hampshire experienced its only burning of a heretic, a gentleman named Thomas Bembridge, who happened to be a relative of both Anne Gifford and Constance Kingsmill. Bembridge recanted at the first attempt to burn him and his relatives illegally saved him from the fire. The privy council ordered a second and successful execution shortly afterwards, which created lasting bitterness among the Kingsmills and Giffords, especially toward the sheriff, Sir Richard Pexsall. 
Elizabeth I's accession immediately revived the Kingsmills' prospects and her reign can largely be considered the zenith of the family's fortunes. Sir John and Constance Kingsmill had seventeen children. Their eldest son, and heir,

Richard Kingsmill (c.1528-1600), followed the family tradition of a legal career and became more prominent politically than his older brother. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 June 1543 he was called to the bar in 1548. In 1555 Sir John Thynne recommended him for a position in Princess Elizabeth's household. He served Lincoln's Inn as a reader in 1558, 1559, 1566, and 1567; as treasurer in 1563; and as governor in 1568. A Hampshire JP from 1558 until his death, he was elected MP for Calne, Wiltshire, in 1559 and for Heytesbury, Wiltshire, in 1563. Appointed a commissioner for the establishment of true religion in the north of England in 1559, he was also identified as a favourer of the protestant religion in 1564 by Bishop Horne. During the 1560s he attempted to use his protestant and family connections to obtain the attorneyship of the court of wards, but did not succeed until 1573. He became surveyor of the court in 1590. Meanwhile in 1584 and 1586 he was elected a knight of the shire for Hampshire. He also built up his estate, acquiring the manors of Shoddesden, Hurstborne Fauconers, Tangley, Highclere, and Burghclere. He married Alice, the daughter of Richard Fauconer of Hurstborne, Hampshire, after 1557. Their daughter and heir, Constance, married Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, Warwickshire. Alice had died by about 1574, when her husband married Elizabeth Stonehouse ('nee' Woodrofe). Richard Kingsmill's death on 24 September 1600 without a male heir resulted in the breaking up of his estate. He was buried at Highclere, Hampshire. 
Sir John [ii] Kingsmill's other sons included Henry Kingsmill ('c'.1534-1577), who studied civil law in Paris and Padua, and under Mary went into exile at Venice in the household of the earl of Bedford. By 1560 he was a member of the royal household and in 1563 sat in parliament for Downton, Wiltshire, through the patronage of Bishop Horne. A firm protestant in the Genevan style, he died young. John [iii] Kingsmill ('c'.1536-1590) was a member of Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1553 and MA in 1562. A fellow of Magdalen between 1556 and 1572, he became that college's bursar in 1563. At Oxford he displayed strongly protestant sympathies and opposed vestments. Appointed chancellor of Winchester diocese in 1570, he sat in parliament for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, in 1584 and 1586. During his last years he lived at the Magdalen College manor of King's Enham, where he died in 1590 apparently unmarried. Andrew Kingsmill (1537/8-1569) studied civil law at Oxford but became more interested in Calvinist theology and biblical studies. He travelled to Geneva in 1566, became a minister there, and died at Lausanne leaving several devotional writings that were published posthumously. George Kingsmill ('c'.1539-1606) began his legal studies at Lincoln's Inn in 1560 and was called to the bar in 1567. A highly regarded lawyer, who was made a queen's serjeant in 1595, in 1579 he purchased the stewardship of King's Somborne hundred which probably accounts for his election in 1584 and 1586 as MP for Stockbridge in that hundred. After 1595 he married Sarah, the widow of Francis, Lord Hastings. In 1599 George Kingsmill became a judge in the court of common pleas like his grandfather. Dying without children in April 1606, he left to his widow an estate which included lands inherited from his brother Richard.

Sir Henry Kingsmill (c.1588-1624), was his father's eldest surviving son, though his second by birth. In 1610 he married the formidable Bridget (died 1672), daughter of John White of Hampshire. Knighted in 1611, Sir Henry died prematurely in 1624, leaving as his son and heir the eleven-year-old

Sir William [iii] Kingsmill (1613-1661). Bridget inherited two thirds of her husband's estates and also purchased the wardship of her son. The latter attained his majority in 1634, but because his mother outlived him he never gained full control of the Kingsmill lands. 
The relationship between mother and son was sometimes stormy. Even stormier was the political situation of England in 1640 when William [iii] Kingsmill first became a JP in Hampshire. Charles I appointed him sheriff of Hampshire at Reading about November 1642, but the parliamentary general Sir William Waller removed him from that office during October 1643. The king also knighted him, possibly on his appointment as sheriff and no later than October 1644. Although Sir William was a thoroughgoing royalist in his sentiments he never fought against parliament, and Charles I did not particularly trust him. In his actions as opposed to his words Kingsmill appears to have been a neutralist. His estates suffered during the civil war as there was considerable military activity in northern Hampshire. He had submitted to the local parliamentary committee for compounding by 1645, and from 1646 to 1650 was again a JP for Hampshire. He may have participated in royalist plotting during 1649 or 1650, after the king's execution, but thereafter he lived in outward quiet and acceptance of the regimes of the Commonwealth and protectorate. Privately he produced poetry that was deeply critical of the political situation. On 21 February 1654, at the comparatively late age of forty-one, he married Ann, daughter of Sir Anthony Haslewood. They had a son and two daughters, Bridget and Anne. 
Sir William died on 3 September 1661 leaving as his heir the six-year-old

Sir William [iv] Kingsmill (c.1655-1698), who from 1664 was raised by his uncle Sir William Haslewood. William Kingsmill was knighted in 1680. His relationship with his former guardian clearly deteriorated badly, for on 3 November 1683 he killed his uncle after a quarrel in which, Kingsmill claimed, Haslewood gave him great provocation and drew his sword on him. He was pardoned the manslaughter on 14 June 1684, in spite of the opposition of the dead man's family. He was married twice, first to Frances Calwell, with whom he had four children, including his heir, another William, and second to a woman named Rebecca, who bore him two daughters. He died on 26 November 1698. His son and heir William [v] Kingsmill (1685-1766) never married and suffered from insanity during the last thirty years of his life. The family's lands and arms passed by act of parliament in 1766 to the Brice family, who also adopted the Kingsmill name.

Her altered circumstances made it less than Margaret might have once expected, and it has been considered a disparagement. However, Margaret was not a woman of wealth and at the time of her marriage had no lands or possessions of her own. Furthermore, Sir Richard's ancestry, while not as illustrious as Margaret's, was certainly not of low degree.

Sir Arthur Pole (d. c.1527/8), was among those chosen to accompany the king's sister Mary Tudor to France for her marriage to Louis XII. A natural courtier, by 1516 he had been appointed an esquire of the body and in 1518 was among those six young men who were described as gentlemen of the privy chamber. An enthusiastic jouster, sophisticated and witty, he also enjoyed a close friendship with the third duke of Buckingham. Following the duke's fall Arthur suffered for this friendship and was expelled from court, but by October 1522 he had been restored to favour and had gained the king's support in a dispute with his father-in-law. Between 1519 and 1522 Arthur had married as her second husband Jane Pickering, daughter of Sir Roger Lewknor and a considerable heiress, and in 1522 unsuccessfully tried to obtain her father's lands at farm. In 1522 Arthur served in France under the duke of Suffolk, who knighted him there on 1 November. It is unclear if Arthur was expelled from the privy chamber in the purge of 1519, but in 1526 the Eltham ordinances caused his removal to the outer chamber, where he again served with the title of squire of the body. The date and cause of his death are unknown, but the likeliest possibility is that he died about 1527 or 1528 from the sweating sickness; he was buried at Bisham. According to Arthur's widow, following his death she was pressurized by the countess of Salisbury and Lord Montagu into taking a vow of perpetual chastity in order to safeguard the inheritance of her husband's children: Henry, Mary, and Margaret. The daughters were placed in the household of his mother, while by 1543 or 1544 Henry was dead. In 1539, following the fall of the Pole family, Jane disregarded her vow and married Sir William Barentyne. The act of parliament of 1543/4 which made provision for Sir Roger Lewknor's other daughters, and declared Jane's children from her marriage to Barentyne to be legitimate in spite of her vow, ensured that Arthur's daughters inherited considerably less than initially expected.

Ursula Stafford, Lady Stafford (d. 1570)]. The latter is first recorded on 22 November 1513, when the king granted 'our dear and wellbeloved cousin' (BL, Add. MS 18826, fol. 38) several gowns, kirtles, and costly materials. In 1515, as a member of the royal family, she was mentioned as a possible bride for the duke of Milan but on 20 October 1518 she made a spectacular marriage with Henry Stafford (1501-1563), son and heir of the duke of Buckingham. The duke was fond of her and in 1519 gave 'to my daughters Ursula and Mary $3 6's'. 8died' ('LP Henry VIII', vol. 3/1, no. 1285, p. 499), but following his fall in 1521 Ursula and her husband found themselves in a difficult situation financially. In 1522 and 1531 they were jointly granted various manors and lands out of the duke's estates, but not the most valuable ones, and in 1537 Stafford wrote to Cromwell asking to be allowed to buy some dissolved monastic property and threatening to leave the country due to his poverty. To help ease the burden one of their daughters, Margaret, was placed in the household of the countess of Salisbury, who paid 22's'. 63/4died towards her granddaughter's board during her stay in London in 1538. Another daughter, Dorothy ['see 'Stafford, Dorothy], entered the household of the future queen, Elizabeth. Ursula survived her family's fall and upon Mary's accession Baron Stafford (as he became in 1547) happily exploited the relationship which had existed between the queen and his late mother-in-law, reminding Mary that his wife's family 'chose death rather than consent to your disinheritance in your tender years' (TNA: PRO, SP 11/1, no. 17). During this period Ursula enjoyed a close relationship with her niece Katherine, countess of Huntingdon, who was Lord Montagu's eldest daughter, and they visited each other often. Warm relations also existed between Ursula and her brother Cardinal Reginald Pole who had returned from exile in November 1554, despite the fact that he did not have 'a very high opinion' of Lord Stafford ('CSP Venice', '1557-8', no. 1287). Ursula outlived her husband and her siblings and died on 12 August 1570. The lands which had been granted to her and her husband in 1522 and 1531, and which she still possessed in 1570, were valued at $175 8's'. 111/4died Her heir was her son Edward Stafford.

Mrs John Bull (supp. fl. 1712-c.1930) in accounts designed to show the effects of radicalism and war on British domestic as well as political life. Thus, in Jones's letters Mrs Bull and her sister-in-law anxiously discuss the impact of a now godless France on national attitudes to marriage. James Gillray's contemporary cartoon 'John Bull's Progress' offered a similarly bleak picture: with her once 'happy' home destroyed by war, Mrs Bull is forced to pawn her possessions and now sits in rags awaiting John's return from the army. By contrast, the original Mrs Bull, dating from 1712, had offered little loyalty, being a 'luxurious Jade' who 'lov'd splendid Equipages'. Arbuthnot's decision to kill off the first Mrs Bull left John free to remarry a more suitable 'sober Countywoman... the reverse of the other in her Temper' (Arbuthnot, 13, 15) who, practical, sensible, and respectful, willingly lent her support during the later political crisis.

The prosecution, anxious to reveal neither the scope of government intelligence sources nor the extent of political unrest, offered only limited evidence. The defence mainly sought to establish the conspiracy as the work of an 'agent provocateur', George Edwards, a Fleet Street model maker. 
A government spy since arriving in London from Windsor early in 1818, Edwards certainly helped precipitate the affair by colluding in the fiction that the cabinet would dine at the Grosvenor Square home of the earl of Harrowby, lord president of the council, on 23 February 1820. Police and guardsmen raided the Cato Street loft early that evening. In the fight that ensued Richard Smithers, a Bow Street officer, was stabbed and killed by Thistlewood. Though he and other conspirators initially escaped, all who had been present in the loft were eventually captured. Two turned king's evidence: Robert Adams (a shoemaker) and a baker,

John Harrison (b. 1786, d. after 1830). This eliminated any need for Edwards, on watch in Grosvenor Square on the night of the 23rd, to appear at the trial. 
The conspirators had deep roots in London ultra-radicalism. Tidd had allegedly been involved in the Despard conspiracy of 1802. Nearly all the others had been involved in the Spencean Philanthropists, admirers of the agrarian revolutionary Thomas Spence. After he died in 1814 they were consistently at the heart of political conspiracy in the capital and maintained an extensive correspondence with provincial ultra-radicals. It was the Spenceans who organized the great radical meeting at Spa Fields on 2 December 1816, which they intended as the signal for a general rising. During the autumn they had made a concerted play to win over the London trades and secure Henry Hunt as a speaker to attract a capacity crowd. Hunt, however, insisted that Spencean sentiments be removed from resolutions presented to the meeting, causing purists in the society to secede and leaving the 'Spencean conservative committee' in the hands of Thistlewood, James Watson, and Thomas Preston. Preston, a shoemaker born on 22 February 1774 in a slum court (Huggin's Alley, Paul's Court) off Cheapside, London, was severely lame, the consequence of childhood neglect by a nurse to whom he was farmed out by his mother and stepfather. This, though, had not impeded a picaresque career which had taken him to Ireland (where, about 1790, he led a Cork shoemakers' strike) and in 1797 to the West Indies, evading arrest at the time of William Pitt's suppression of London radicalism. 
Expectations for the Spa Fields meeting ran high in both capital and provinces. 'In the course of the Day', it was reported from Lancashire on 2 December, 'the Tower in London was taken by the Rioters... all agree in expressing the fullest determination to have mustered and armed immediately, in case the disturbance in London had been attended with Success' (TNA: PRO, HO 40/4/1[2], 3 Dec 1816). Though the meeting dissolved into widespread rioting, the intended assault on prisons and the Tower was aborted. The most serious violence occurred during the looting of City of London gunsmiths, at one of which a customer was shot, possibly by James Watson's son. Only at nightfall was order fully restored. 
The events of 2 December 1816 were pivotal to the evolution of Cato Street. They suggested that a mass meeting, however large, would not alone generate the momentum necessary to destabilize the capital, and that the authorities would always be prepared for unrest. Thereafter the Spenceans favoured covert tactics. It was reported that they 'cherished some desperate project' for a further Spa Fields rally on 10 February 1817, a rumour given force by meetings they held with provincial delegates a few days before (TNA: PRO, HO 42/158, 29 Jan and 7 Feb 1817). This meeting passed peaceably, but from its platform Hunt pointedly dissociated himself from the Spenceans. The effect was to incline them further to the politics of conspiracy: 'They... say the Philanthropy and Benevolence of Spencean Principles will never effect any Change, and that Luddism is best calculated for the times', reported an informer (TNA: PRO, HO 40/7[1], fol. 1929, report of J. Shegoe, 30 June 1817). Plans were devised for a 'coup d'etat' during Bartholomew fair in August. Under any circumstances this annual Smithfield fair tended to be riotous, and the plot was serious enough for the home secretary, Lord Sidmouth, to compare it to the Despard conspiracy. Preparations were called off at the last moment when the conspirators were confronted by hastily assembled official precautions. Thomas Preston, who had taken final leave of his family, 'declared he was so disappointed, that if he had had a Pistol by him, he thinks he should have blown his brains out' (TNA: PRO, HO 42/170, 9 Sept 1817). 
The government, concerned to protect its intelligence sources, took no action against those involved. It was now Thistlewood who invoked Despard, suggesting that the mass assassination of the privy council should now be their objective. Another Spencean, Surrey paperhanger

John George (1776/7-1842), also endorsed this tactic, 'the best signal... that would set all going' (TNA: PRO, HO 42/188, 30 June 1817). However, an attack on the Tower and Bank of England during the night of 11 October had to be abandoned when only eighty men mustered in the City. Further risings were mooted for 5 November and in January 1818, and again abandoned. 
George Edwards was introduced to the group at about this time by his brother William (a City of London police officer and 'bona fide' Spencean since 1812) and was commissioned to produce a bust of Thomas Spence. He quickly became a central member of the group and a keen proponent of the assassination tactic. The Spenceans, however, saw in the burgeoning politicization of the northern manufacturing districts an alternative route by which revolution might be instigated. Early in August 1819 Edwards reported to the Home Office that the conspirators looked 'with great Anxiety to the Manchr. Meeting on Monday, where they expect the Row to begin, and this they look upon as the Signal' (TNA: PRO, HO 42/191, 6 Aug 1819). The furious suppression of the Manchester meeting at St Peter's Field, which quickly led to its being named Peterloo, perhaps owed something to its association with the Spenceans in the government's mind. It galvanized the group, who immediately deemed it 'the revolution begun in blood'. 'For my own part I am ready now', declared the shoemaker Allen Davenport: 'I compare the present time to the French Revolution, we must arm ourselves as they did' (TNA: PRO, TS11/202, fol. 872; TNA: PRO, HO 42/197, 18 Oct 1819). In mid-October Thistlewood toured the provinces while the Spenceans worked the taprooms of London's poorest districts, particularly targeting Irish labourers. They contemplated using a rally on Clerkenwell Green on 1 November as the signal for an armed rising, but the subdued popular mood convinced them that more clandestine action was necessary. Shortly afterwards James Watson, the most inclined of the group to constitutional agitation, was imprisoned for debt. Without his restraining influence, the allure of attacking the cabinet dinner supposedly arranged for 23 February 1820 was hard to resist. James Ings even went so far as to prepare a placard to be displayed the following day, announcing the formation of a provisional government. 
The full extent of the conspiratorial circles around Cato Street remains conjectural, but they clearly extended far beyond those who were tried. Viscount Sidmouth believed that 'a simultaneous explosion appears to be meditated at a early period' (Devon RO, Sidmouth papers, 152/M C1820/OH, 21 March 1820). When news of the Cato Street arrests reached the north, certain ultra-radicals 'were staggered and confounded' according to one observer (Richmond, 184-5). London shoemakers', coachmakers', tailors', and typefounders' trade societies lent active support, the latter by casting bullets. A number of arms caches were discovered, one at the home of John George's son, Robert, a discharged sailor. 
The government, however, was primarily concerned to secure swift and exemplary verdicts upon Thistlewood and those with him when Richard Smithers was killed. Thus, Robert George and Preston avoided prosecution, even though the latter was known to have been preparing to seize cannon from the headquarters of the Honourable Artillery Company on 23 February. John George was another who escaped punishment, presumably in order not to expose the full extent of the government's informer network. George subsequently earned a living as a self-employed decorator but was reduced, possibly as a result of white lead poisoning, to manual labouring by the late 1830s. He died at Lambeth on 9 August 1842. 
Brunt, Ings, Davidson, Tidd, and their leader were tried with high treason and murder, sentenced to death, and hanged at Newgate on 1 May 1820. Their corpses having been decapitated, they were all interred in quicklime inside the gaol later the same day. The crown witness Robert Adams was released without trial but almost immediately imprisoned for debt. His colleague John Harrison was transported to Australia, where he opened a bakery in Bathurst, New South Wales, and where Sir Roger Therry describes a meeting with him in 1830. Two other transported conspirators, John Strange and James Wilson, became police constables in New South Wales. A campaign led by the City radical Alderman Wood to bring Edwards to justice failed and the latter disappeared. Under the alias of George Parker, he settled in South Africa and died at Green Point, Cape Town, on 30 November 1843. The leading conspirator who lived longest was Thomas Preston, active in metropolitan radicalism until his death on 1 June 1850: at his funeral the coffin was draped with a red flag and accompanied by the banner of the Marylebone Chartists' Emmett League. The last surviving conspirator was almost certainly the unnamed 'master shoemaker' who, still insisting on anonymity, detailed his involvement in the autobiography he published at the age of eighty-one in 1879 ('Boot and Shoemaker', 14 June - 6 Sept 1879).

Thomas Vincent (c.1720-1783), oboist and composer, who was born in London about 1720 and may have been one of the Thomas Vincents baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 28 October 1720 and 11 August 1723, both the sons of Thomas and Elizabeth Vincent. He became a very successful performer. His family connections no doubt assisted him in acquiring Giuseppe Sammartini as his teacher. Hawkins noted that Thomas junior was known to have possessed most of his teacher's 'excellencies' in 'a very eminent degree', at a time when oboists were 'greatly superior to any that can be remembered before the arrival of Martini in England' (Hawkins, 2.895). He appeared at events including the annual spring concerts given at the King's Theatre for the benefit of the Royal Society of Musicians (1743-68), the annual Foundling Hospital 'Messiah' in 1754 and 1758, and the Covent Garden and Drury Lane oratorios during the 1750s, and he was concerto soloist at the Lock Hospital on 29 February 1764. Vincent also published a number of works during this period, including six solos (1748), 'A Sett ['sic'] of Familiar Lessons for the Harpsichord' (1755), and songs (1760?). He was a member of the king's musick during the 1760s (while living at Brook Green, Hammersmith), although he may have gained this position much earlier, and may have appeared at the Dublin Rotunda in 1770. In 1764-5 Vincent joined Peter Crawford and John Gordon in the management of opera at the King's Theatre, but the venture ended in 1769 with the loss of a considerable sum of money. The will of a John Gowland (proved 23 August 1776), described as Vincent's assignee, shows Vincent to have been deeply in debt, as he was paying his entire salary of $40 as a royal musician, and his additional income as the king's barber, to Gowland; income was then to pass to a bookseller in New Bond Street, James Robson, who, after taking his own costs, was to transfer the sum to Vincent's wife, Penelope, for as long as she lived. Vincent was not to receive the money until after her death. Burney suggests happier times, when Vincent, an experienced professor and 'long a favourite on the hautbois', had 'been in great favour with the prince of Wales', presumably George III's father Frederick, and 'had acquired a considerable sum of money in his profession, which he augmented by marriage' (Burney, 'Hist. mus.', 2.870). Vincent died in 1783, probably on 10 May. An oboist, Thomas Vincent ('fl'. 1784?-1795), may have been his son and may have appeared in the Handel commemoration (1784) and been a member of the king's musick in 1793 and 1795.

He also published compositions, including a few songs which appeared mainly during the 1730s and 1740s. Burney described him as 'a brilliant performer' who 'died young' (Burney, 'Hist. mus.', 2.870).

Farquhar Mactaggart (d. c.1251). Suggestions that Farquhar's byname, meaning 'son of the priest', derived from his possession of the former west-coast monastery of Applecross, seem to have originated in nineteenth-century speculation; if he had an ecclesiastical connection it is more likely to have been with the shrine and sanctuary of St Duthac at Tain, on the southern shore of the Dornoch Firth. Probably a native of eastern Ross, he and others of that region would doubtless have regarded invasions from the west with hostility, looking for lordship to Scottish kings who were now increasingly active in the north of their realm, rather than to pretenders with Irish connections. On 15 June 1215 Farquhar presented the young Alexander II with the heads of his enemies, and was rewarded with a knighthood. In 1221 Alexander came to Inverness, and some time between then and 1226 he made Farquhar earl of Ross, the first in what proved a long-lasting dynasty. In July 1235 Farquhar justified his elevation during Alexander's campaign in Galloway, his arrival late in the day turning a desperate fight in the king's favour. He already had links with Galloway and the Western Isles. In the 1220s he founded a Premonstratensian abbey at Fearn with canons from Whithorn, while by 1223 his daughter Christina had married Olaf, afterwards king of Man, and he later assisted his son-in-law against enemies in Skye. He also made appearances at court, witnessing the treaty of York in 1237 and subscribing the copy of the Anglo-Scottish treaty of 1244 which was sent for papal confirmation. 
Farquhar died about 1251, and was buried at Fearn. It is an apt comment on the association with royal power which lay behind his remarkable career that his two sons, born to an unknown mother, should have been named William and Malcolm, doubtless after two twelfth-century Scottish kings.

William of Ross, second earl of Ross (d. 1274), had been old enough in 1235 to fight alongside his father (whose byname he is not known to have inherited). He married Jean, daughter of William Comyn, earl of Buchan, and supported his brother-in-law Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith, during the minority of Alexander III. But when Alexander began to rule in person in the early 1260s, and resumed his father's efforts to extend royal power into the west of Scotland, William was active on the king's behalf. In 1262 he was one of the leaders of a force which ravaged Skye, and in the aftermath of the following year's unsuccessful expedition by the king of Norway appears to have been given custody of Skye and Lewis.

John Noble (d. 1797), publisher and proprietor of a circulating library, are of uncertain origins. They may have been of French descent, and related to William Noble (apprentice to the London bookseller Benjamin Walford in 1709) and the bookseller S. Noble ('fl'. 1713-1717), of Long Walk, Cheapside. They were certainly either the siblings or close relations of the bookseller and library proprietor Samuel Noble ('fl'. 1760-1779) of Carnaby Street, of the journeyman bookseller Edward Noble (died 1786), who was foreman of John Nichols, and of Drusilla, the wife of the engraver Jacob Bonneau (died 1786). There is no record of their having served apprenticeships with members of the Stationers' Company. Although the Noble brothers operated on the fringe of the established book trade throughout their careers, they are noteworthy for their role in popularizing the commercial circulating library in England, and for developing an active and popular publishing programme which supplied their own and other such libraries with appropriate publications.

Sir John Campbell of Cawdor (d. 1546), third son of Archibald Campbell, second earl of Argyll (d. 1513), to Muriel (1498- 'c'.1575), daughter of John Calder (died 1498) and heir of her grandfather's modest but fertile lands near Nairn and Inverness, known as the thanedom of Calder or Cawdor; famously abducted as an infant after her father's death, Muriel was brought up in Argyll. A thane was a pre-Norman district ruler, and although in 1476 Calder had been granted the liberties and privileges of a barony, Muriel almost a century later was still describing her lands as the thanedom and barony of Cawdor. The earl of Argyll saw these lands as a useful outpost from which to further Campbell interests in the north. In spite of his wife's inheritance, however, which was unsuccessfully disputed by her Calder uncles, Sir John maintained his links with the west and wove a web of alliances among the clans there. One of his sisters had married Lachlan Maclean of Duart, who exposed her below high tide on 'Lady's rock' near Duart, whence she was rescued and taken home to Inveraray. Sir John took his revenge with a party of fourteen men on 10 November 1523, when he broke into a house in Edinburgh 'under silence of night' and murdered Duart in his bed. For this he received a remission in 1524. Family tradition suggests that only after this did Sir John make his home in the north, in a castle previously built or extended and fortified by the Calders in 1454-5, and begin to make alliances with his neighbours, extend his possessions, and encourage his younger sons to found families there. He died in spring 1546. 
Sir John was followed by Archibald (died 1551), the eldest of his five sons, who died just five years later. Muriel, who seems to have been a redoubtable lady, survived until about 1575. Archibald, who in 1545 married Isabel Grant of Frenchie, was succeeded by his eldest son,

John Campbell of Cawdor (d. 1592), for whom his uncle John Campbell, prior of Ardchattan and later bishop of the Isles, acted as tutor. In 1575 John married Mary, daughter of William Keith, fourth Earl Marischal, and younger sister of Annas or Agnes Keith, widow of the regent Moray and now married to Colin Campbell (c.1542-1584), and mother of his heir. This marriage led Cawdor once more firmly into the Argyll circle. On his death in 1584 Colin left a nine-year-old son, over whose upbringing there arose much (uncharacteristic) trouble among the Campbell gentry. Cawdor was nominated by the late earl as one of the six curators and, along with Sir James Campbell of Ardkinglass and Neil Campbell, bishop of Argyll, one of three principals. In a bond dated 1586 between Cawdor and Campbell of Lochnell on the subject of the custody and management of the young seventh earl, there is a reference to 'the abuse of thais quhilk keipis my lord of Argyllis body' (Innes, 188). They were clearly trying to reduce the influence of Ardkinglass, who was, however, supported by the powerful Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy. There was already a close link between the earls of Moray and Argyll owing to their strong protestant background and family relationship, and Cawdor was also involved with Moray over his lands in the north, where there was great rivalry between Moray and the earl of Huntly. Cawdor, with the earls of Atholl and Moray, was part of a group who in 1590 formed an offensive and defensive alliance apparently directed against Huntly. In the same year the young earl of Argyll, now aged fourteen, chose his own nine curators, of whom once again Cawdor was a principal, with Campbell of Lochnell in place of Ardkinglass. A widespread plot led to a contract by which seven signatories, including Huntly and Campbell of Glenorchy, aimed 'to cut of and slay' Argyll, his brother Colin, Moray, and Campbell of Cawdor (Macphail, 184). Accordingly on 4 February 1592 Cawdor, while sitting by the fire in a house at Knipoch near Oban, was killed by three or four shots fired from 'ane long hagbit' (ibid., 154). John Campbell of Ardkinglass, who had succeeded his father in 1591, had been easily persuaded by Glenorchy to arrange this, and it was he who confessed to implication in the murder. Three days later came the better-known assassination of the 'bonnie earl of Moray' at Donibristle by Huntly. Argyll and his brother survived. 
The aftermath of the murders left chaos in the north and the highlands were said to be like a huge harp of which it was impossible to touch one string without setting the others jangling. But the Campbells managed to restore clan unity, in the pursuit of which in 1601
