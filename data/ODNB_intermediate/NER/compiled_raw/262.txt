Anne Redfearn (d. 1612). Sowthernes never faced trial, having died in gaol between her commitment to prison on 2 April and the opening of the assizes. Her daughter Elizabeth Device, along with her children Alizon and James Device, and Anne Whittle and Anne Redfearn, were all hanged at Lancaster on 20 August. So also were a group who had been drawn into the trials through their reported presence at a feast at Malkin Tower on Good Friday 1612:

Alice Nutter (d. 1612) of Pendle, Katherine Hewytte, alias Mould-Heels (died 1612), wife of John Hewytte of Colne, John Bulcocke (died 1612), and his mother, Jane Bulcocke (died 1612), wife of Christopher Bulcocke, both of the Moss End near Newchurch in Pendle. 
The relationship of two other witches condemned to the Pendle group is uncertain: they may have been victims of the local fears raised by news of Pendle rather than accused for any association with the group. Certainly there is no established connection with Isabel Robey (died 1612) of Windle, near St Helens, who was also hanged. Margaret Pearson of Padiham was found guilty and punished by a year in prison and the pillory: this was her first conviction (though her third trial) and her victim had been an animal rather than a person. Anne Whittle testified against her but it is unclear whether she knew her before their shared confinement in Lancaster Castle.

Shirley Nolan (1942-2002). She had been born at the Maternity Hospital Annexe, Cookridge, Leeds, on 10 February 1942, the daughter of George Henry Oakey, then serving as a lance-corporal in the Royal Army Service Corps, and his wife, Rhoda, 'nee' Unsworth, bus conductor. She had an elder brother Bob and a younger brother Tony. Before the Second World War her father had been a tailor's fitter; later he was a chemical worker. She was educated at Pontefract Girls' High School and Trent Park College, Hertfordshire, before being awarded an associateship at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London. She married James Gerald Nolan on 4 August 1962, when he was thirty-one and working as a scaffolder. He was the son of Thomas Nolan, a janitor. She began teaching in 1963 in Harlow New Town, Essex, and in 1965 was head of drama at a school in Rainham, Essex. In 1969 Shirley decided to travel overland to Australia, accompanied, according to her autobiography, by a man named Ted whom she had met shortly beforehand. They arrived in Darwin, Northern Territory, in November 1969 and settled there, Ted running a delivery business and Shirley teaching literature. They moved to Adelaide, South Australia, in November 1971.

Annie French (1872-1965) was another illustrator who used a fine linear technique. Born at 5 Calder Street, Govan, Glasgow, on 6 February 1872, she was the daughter of Andrew French, a colliery clerk and later metallurgist, and his wife, Margaret Weir. Unlike Jessie King, her interest in art was encouraged by her family, and she was a student at the Glasgow School of Art from 1886 to 1889. She taught at the school's department of ceramic decoration from 1908 to 1912. Her black and white illustrative work, for example 'The Picture Book' (reproduced in 'The Studio', 14 July 1906) and 'The Plumed Hat' ('c'.1900; reproduced in Burkhauser, 142), shows some similarity in style to that of Aubrey Beardsley: it was imaginative and full of fantasy, but was little published although well reviewed in the prestigious art journal 'The Studio'. In 1914 she married the ceramic artist George Wooliscroft Rhead (1867-1920) and settled in London. She died at The Limes, a nursing home in St Helier, Jersey, on 27 January 1965. Examples of her work are held in private collections and a few are in the collection of Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries. 
Though Katharine Cameron illustrated many books, she was better known as a watercolour painter of flowers (especially roses) and landscapes. As a student at the Glasgow School of Art from 1888 to 1895 she was friendly with C. R. Mackintosh and the Macdonald sisters, and a member of the Immortals group. She contributed to 'The Magazine' and in 1949 presented its four issues to the Glasgow School of Art. 
Among Fra Newbery's many innovative ideas was the establishment of craft studios and the appointment of many women teachers of design on his staff.

De Courcy Lewthwaite Dewar (1878-1959), metalwork designer, was born on 12 February 1878 in Kandy, Ceylon, the daughter of a tea planter, John Lewthwaite Dewar, and his wife, Amelia Cochran. Her unusual first name had been passed down through several generations in her family, by whom she was known as Kooroovi, the Tamil word for a small bird. She was one of three surviving daughters of the family. From 1891 until 1908 or 1909 she studied part-time at the Glasgow School of Art. Her enamel and metalwork, which included jewellery, clock surrounds, mirror surrounds, plaques, caskets, buttons, and sconces, was frequently illustrated in 'The Studio'. She also painted, engraved, and produced designs for bookplates, calendars, tea-room menus, and cards, as well as costumes for masques. For thirty-eight years Dewar taught design in the metalwork department of the school, during some of that period with Peter Wylie Davidson, in whose 'Applied Design in the Precious Metals' (1929) her 'Presentation Casket' ('c'.1910; Glasgow Society of Women Artists, on loan to Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) is illustrated. 'Dewar's enamel and graphic work is characterized by strong colour and vigorous outline and the Glasgow Style designs from her student and tutorial phase gradually evolved to a more geometric and boldly coloured Czechoslovakian folk-art influenced style' (Burkhauser, 163). She was president of the Society of Lady Artists' Club, whose history she wrote (privately printed, 1950). Her sketchbooks of 'c'.1895-1910 (priv. coll.), letters, and journals provide 'a rare account of a woman designer of the Glasgow Style era' (ibid.). Dewar was involved with the women's suffrage movement, for whom she designed bookplates, programmes, and calendars. She compiled files on women artists for the National Council of Women in London providing biographical information and reproductions of works. She did not marry and lived with her sister, Katharine, at 15 Woodside Terrace, Glasgow, until her death there on 24 November 1959. 
Of a talented family, Helen Walton (1850-1921) joined the staff of the Glasgow School of Art in 1894 to teach ceramic design and decoration. The designer and architect George Henry Walton was her brother. Helen's sister Hannah (1863-1940) decorated china and glass, and another sister, Constance, like their brother Edward Arthur Walton, was a painter. Later, in 1902, Dorothy Carleton Smyth (1880-1933) and her sister Olive (1882-1949) were both on the school's staff and taught in a variety of applied art media and techniques such as sgraffito, gesso panels, illumination on vellum, and woodblock printing on textiles. Dorothy is now chiefly remembered for her costume illustrations and Olive for her stylized scenes in watercolour on vellum of subjects from legends. 
Four of the Glasgow Girls were painters in oils and worked more independently than the designers and decorative artists.

Allan Gairdner Wyon (1882-1962), son of Allan and his wife, Harriet Gairdner, was primarily a sculptor, and was also the last member of the family to work as a die-engraver. He trained at the Royal Academy Schools, and worked as assistant to the sculptor William Hamo Thornycroft. His works include the 'East Wind' for Charles Holden's new headquarters for London Underground at 55 Broadway (1926-9). On his father's death he took his place as head of the die-engraving firm, but under him it ceased to operate, and in 1933 the dies were transferred to John Pinches. He continued to design and model medals, however, into the 1950s. He died in 1962. 
Peter Wyon (1767-1822), who had continued to run the Birmingham side of the business after Thomas the elder's departure for London, produced tokens and medals, including a large medal of Boulton after a model by Roux (1809). The Birmingham business ended with his death, by which time his son William Wyon (1795-1851) was established at the Royal Mint in London. Following William's death, the post of modeller and engraver to the Royal Mint was created for his son Leonard Charles Wyon (1826-1891). 
The third brother, George Wyon ('b'. 1771), also remained in Birmingham, where on 26 August 1798 he married Elizabeth Phillips. Their son James Wyon (1804-1868) worked as assistant to his cousin William Wyon in London, and on the reorganization of the Royal Mint in 1851 became resident engraver. Two of the sons of James and his wife, Mary, Henry Wyon (1834-1856) and George Wyon (1834-1862), also became die-engravers. Another of George and Elizabeth's sons, John George ('b'. 1806), who remained in the west midlands and married Alice Arkinstall, was the father of Edward Wyon (1837-1906), who worked for the Birmingham mint of Heaton & Sons and, having supervised the construction of the first modern mint in China, at Canton (Guangzhou), in 1887-8, stayed on as head of the operative department. 
The fourth brother, James Wyon, set up a die-engraving business in Dublin.

Thomas [i] Dundas of Fingask (1681?-1762), woollen-draper, the son of John Dundas ('b'. before 1670, died 1724) and grandson of Sir John Dundas of Fingask (died 1670). In 1650 Sir John's Perthshire estate had been confiscated by the Scottish covenanting regime as punishment for the family's royalism, an action his descendants sought to redress. Having prospered in business, and after receiving a small inheritance, Thomas [i] was able to borrow money and in 1728-9 he purchased Letham and other lands in Airth, Stirlingshire. He obtained a crown charter for this property 'by which the names and designations thereof were to be changed into that of Fingask' (Dundas, 40), and he was henceforth known as Thomas Dundas of Fingask or of Letham. He married Bethia Baillie ('fl'. 1686-1732), sister of Bernard Baillie (1673-1743), abbot of St James's at Ratisbon in Bavaria. 
Notwithstanding this Roman Catholic connection the Dundas family conformed to the Church of Scotland and accepted the Hanoverian succession. Thomas [i] and Bethia had two children -- Thomas [ii] Dundas of Fingask ('c'.1708-1786) ['see below'] and

Sir John [iii] Arundell of Lanherne (c.1474-1545), was made a knight of the Bath when Prince Henry was created duke of York in 1494, and led troops both against Cornish rebels in 1497 and to France in 1513, when he was dubbed a knight-banneret. Appointed to the Cornish bench in 1509, he served continually on commissions for the south-west counties. Receiver of the duchy of Cornwall by 1508, he relinquished the position in 1533 to his younger son, Sir Thomas Arundell of Wardour (c.1502-1552). By refusing a barony in 1525, Sir John [iii] showed that he recognized the economic demands inherent in such a rank, and he was also unwilling to live at court as he grew older. None the less, in the absence of a resident aristocracy in Cornwall, the Arundells of Lanherne were noble in all but name, and contemporaries called them the 'great' Arundells. Sir John's appointment with his son to the council of the west in 1539 reflected the continued importance of the Arundells to the crown, to which they were linked by his marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset. Following her death, about 1503 he married Katherine Grenvile of Stowe ('b'. 1489x93), a match closer to home and requiring a papal dispensation, and suggesting a personal choice rather than a strategic alliance. She survived him. 
A devoted family man and considerate of his spiritual life, Sir John [iii] Arundell founded a chantry at St Mawgan and entrusted his children to Katherine's care before embarking with troops to France in 1513. A decade later, he cared for his daughter-in-law, left abandoned and pregnant in London when financial embarrassment caused her husband, his son and heir, John, to flee temporarily to the continent. His second son, Thomas, engaged in negotiations for the marriages of two of his sisters who were serving Queen Jane Seymour in 1536. Mary Arundell (d. 1557) married Robert Radcliffe, earl of Sussex, and Thomas Cromwell proposed the marriage of her half-sister Jane (died 1577) to his own son Gregory. However, Jane never married, and her father provided her with substantial support for life. A gentlewoman in Queen Mary's household, she returned eventually to Lanherne and is commemorated in St Mawgan church. Cromwell's failure to base his family's dynastic aspirations upon an Arundell alliance is unsurprising. The confraternal association of the Lanherne family with the Carthusians reflected deep piety and devotion to traditional religion. Religious change in England marked a turning point for them, although their enormous wealth enabled them to survive the difficulties brought upon them by their spiritual loyalties during the sixteenth century. Sir John [iii] died on 8 February 1545, possessed of substantial properties which included nearly 6000 acres in Devon alone and with lands in Devon and Cornwall valued at nearly $400. Buried at St Columb Major on 20 February, he had spent the last years of his life, and died, at the home of his nephew, Richard Roscarrock of Roscarrock in St Endellion parish, also an opponent of religious change.

Sir John [iv] Arundell of Lanherne (c.1500-1557), who succeeded his father, was the elder son of the latter's first marriage. In 1516 he married Mary, daughter of Sir Peter Edgcumbe of Cotehele ('c'.1469-1539) and Joan Dernford; at the same time his sister Elizabeth (died 1516x24) married Sir Peter's heir, Richard (died 1562). Mary had died by 1527, and her husband's twelve children were born of his second marriage, to Elizabeth (died 1564), daughter of the courtier Gerard Dannett. Appointed to the Cornish and Devon benches in the 1530s, and sheriff of Cornwall in 1541-2, Arundell was knighted in 1539. In 1536 he commanded a body of Devon militia against the Pilgrimage of Grace, and he went with the army to France in 1544. His life changed dramatically in 1549, however, when the privy council summoned him to answer charges brought by John, Baron Russell, the commander of the royal army against the western rising. Accused of refusing to raise militia and illegally ordering the performance of masses, Arundell claimed he had been without authority in a region far from home. His absence, although convenient, is substantiated in the council's records, and prudence may have dictated his ordering masses in a crisis as a way of promoting calm. But at this time the importance of the 'great' Arundells worked against them, in a climate of crisis governed by suspicion, intrigue, and fear, and their safety was also compromised by their being brothers-in-law of the earl of Arundell and the Howards, and cousins of Humphrey Arundell (1512/13-1550), a leader of the Cornish rebels. After repeated imprisonment and his brother Thomas's execution, Sir John was released in June 1552. He could have expected to prosper after the accession of Mary in the following year, but although he was both sheriff and a knight of the shire in 1554, his service to the new queen was short-lived. He died intestate on 7 November 1557, and his widow was granted administration of his possessions. The devotion of Elizabeth, Lady Arundell, to traditional religion and erudition reflected that of her husband, his family, and her children, as is evident in their wills, and in the library she inherited from her husband. Husband and wife were buried at St Mawgan, as were some of their children.

Sir John [v] Arundell (1527x30-1590), was the last of the 'great' Arundells -- the result of what became an open commitment to Catholicism against the background of both the Elizabethan religious settlement and constant threats of invasion from Spain. His election as MP for Helston in 1545 and then for Shaftesbury in 1547 undoubtedly resulted from the influence of his uncle, Sir Thomas Arundell of Wardour. The patronage of his future father-in-law, the third earl of Derby, probably secured his election for Preston in 1555, but his recent succession to his father did most to bring him election for Cornwall in 1558. Esquire of the body to Queen Mary and her husband by 1558, he served on muster, subsidy, and piracy commissions between 1558 and 1566, and was appointed to the Cornish bench in 1569, when he also co-commanded the county muster at the time of the northern rising. In 1571 he was recorder of Helston and steward of the seventeenth earl of Oxford's west country lands, some of which he purchased. 
Recognizing that Arundell did not sympathize with its religious policy, in 1562 the government excluded him from service on assizes. Bishop Alley's report of two years later on the stance of the leading men of his diocese likewise named him as an opponent. His being knighted in 1566 and his continuing to hold public offices probably represented attempts to persuade him to conformity at this time. He declined to subscribe to the 'Act of Uniformity' in 1570, but a recognizance was quickly discharged since his loyalty to the queen was evident. But when Cuthbert Mayne, the first seminary priest to be executed, praised Sir John from the scaffold at Launceston on 30 November 1577, the government would no longer tolerate his refusal to accept the Elizabethan settlement, and thereafter he came under constant pressure. Vulnerable as a recusant to accusations of disloyalty, Sir John suffered repeated imprisonment, fines, and enforced residence in London for the remainder of his life, despite his public declaration both of his loyalty to the queen and of his willingness to defend her and the realm against the pope. He died at Isleworth, Middlesex, on 17 November 1590, but was buried at St Columb Major on 6 December following. In his will, drawn up on 12 December 1589, Arundell made no attempt to conceal his Catholicism, bequeathing his soul to the mercy of God and 'the intercession and mediation of our Blessed Ladie the holie Virgin Marie and of the holie Aungelles Saintes and the blessed company of heaven'. His executor and residuary legatee was his son, another John Arundell, who was urged to make his own will forthwith, 'that he die not intestate whereby my goodes and chattells may come into straungers handes' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/76, fol. 290'r'- 'v'). Sir John's largest single bequest was of $100 to his wife, Anne, daughter of Edward Stanley, third earl of Derby, and widow of Charles, eighth Baron Stourton. The mother of Arundell's eight children, after his death she retired to the manor of Chideock, Dorset, but when she died in 1602 was buried beside him at St Columb Major. In 1599 two of their daughters, Dorothy and Gertrude, became Benedictine nuns in the first English convent on the continent, founded at Brussels. 
Traditional religion continued at Lanherne, however, for in 1794 Lord and Lady Arundell of Wardour gave the house to English Carmelites fleeing the French invasion of Flanders, and they retained it until 2001. It is now a convent for Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate, and retains a significant relic, a skull believed to be that of St Cuthbert Mayne. 
The sixteenth-century Arundells of Trerice did not share the religious traditionalism of their Lanherne cousins. They too prospered in the late fifteenth century through their services to the crown, under both Edward IV and Henry VII. In the latter's reign Sir John [vi] Arundell of Trerice (died 1511) linked the two lines when he married Jane Grenvile of Stowe (died 1552), sister of the Katherine Grenvile who married Sir John [iii] Arundell of Lanherne. The outstanding member of the family was their eldest son,

John [ix] Arundell (d. 1580), eventually inherited the Trerice name together with difficulties arising from a split inheritance that were resolved only in 1598, eighteen years after his death. Notwithstanding these problems, the master of Trerice was a wealthy man whose landownership in the south-western counties increased through the inheritance of his first wife, Katherine Hill, 'nee' Cosworth. Though he was MP for Mitchell in 1555 and 1558, and sheriff of Cornwall in 1573-4, John [ix] Arundell was less active in local and national affairs than his father had been, and in the eyes of posterity his most important achievement was the rebuilding of Trerice House (now owned by the National Trust). It is an excellent example of an Elizabethan manor house, with fine plasterwork and a continental gable design that may be unique for its period. Described by his son-in-law Richard Carew as a kind and loving man, these qualities also appear in his will, with its careful provision not only for his children (his daughters were to have $1200) but also for numerous servants, as well as for the neighbouring poor and for the repair of Wade Bridge. His heir, John [x] Arundell ['see 'Arundell, Sir John (1576-1654x)], was his son from his second marriage, which was to Gertrude Denys; anecdotally called John for the king, this John Arundell eventually inherited the Gwarnack properties. John [x] Arundell's son Richard Arundel (1616-1687) was created Baron Arundell of Trerice in 1665. The title became extinct in 1768 with the death of another John, the fourth baron, and the Trerice estates eventually passed to the Acland family. Richard's sister Anne (died 1701), married Sir John Arundell of Lanherne (1623-1701), but died childless. Sir John's great-granddaughter, Mary (died 1769), married Henry, seventh Baron Arundell of Wardour (1717-1756), thus reuniting the Lanherne Arundell lands.

Richard [i] Reynell (1519-1585) of East Ogwell, as the second son of John and Margery Reynell, pursued an adventurous early career of travel and military exploits. He journeyed to Hungary to fight the Turks and was present at the siege of Boulogne. He led a troop of horse in the western rebellion of 1549, was seriously wounded in the action to relieve Plymouth, and was rewarded with lands at Weston Peverell. His brother Walter [iii] was still alive about 1550 when Richard married Agnes, daughter of Thomas Southgate but had presumably died before Richard began to purchase more land in 1555, in particular West Ogwell. In April 1558 Reynell was appointed a captain to defend the county against the French. He sued for a pardon in January 1559 but was trusted enough to begin his long service as a JP later that year, and set a tradition of county service for his descendants.

Sir Thomas [ii] Reynell (1555-1618), entered the Middle Temple with his brother Josias on 13 May 1574. At this time he wrote letters and poems of a devotional nature to his father. He may have pursued a legal career as he refers to himself as 'at law at London' in 1585 (Devon RO, 4652M/F5/1). He kept a slight diary which was continued by his descendants. A typed copy of the original exists and shows that his life centred round his house at West Ogwell which he began building in 1589. Two years later he planted a pear garden and set a row of elms before the house. He consolidated the family estate by buying back land in North Bovey left to his brothers and also purchased Morleigh. He was seldom out of the county: one exception was in July 1603 when he was knighted at Whitehall with his younger brother George [i]. 
Sir Thomas's public service revolved round his position on the bench from 1588. The quarter session records survive from 1592 and show him attending nearly every meeting. He was also active in taking recognizances and pursuing matters of local concern such as presenting highways in need of repair. The war with Spain made other demands on him. In July 1596 he passed on information gained from merchants to Secretary Robert Cecil. In 1599 he served as a regimental officer and as acting deputy lieutenant in place of his cousin Sir George Carey who was treasurer-at-war in Ireland. Reynell's band and Sir George's guarded Torbay against a possible Spanish invasion. 
Sir Thomas married Frances, daughter of John Aylworth, esquire, of London and Polsloe on 3 March 1584. She died on 4 July 1605, survived by three sons and five daughters. On 9 February 1607 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew and widow of Sir Jonathan Trelawny; they had one son. Sir Thomas died on 8 April 1618 and was buried in the chancel of East Ogwell next to his first wife. His widow returned to Cornwall and soon married for a third time.

Sir Carew Reynell (c.1563-1624) was a gentleman pensioner of Elizabeth and James. He enjoyed the patronage both of Sir Robert Cecil and of the second earl of Essex, with whom he sailed on the 'islands voyage' of 1597. In 1599 he took a foot company to Ireland, where he was knighted by the earl and entrusted with the keeping of the castle and fort of Duncannon. His association with Essex caused his imprisonment early in 1601, but he was soon cleared of any implication in Essex's rebellion. He had been a member of the parliament of 1593 for Callington, but was returned for Lancaster in 1601 (when he made a speech in the Commons attacking sabbath-breakers) and later for Wallingford in 1614 and Cricklade in 1621. He also gained several profitable offices. He died on 7 September 1624 and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. He had married Susanna, widow of Michael Erneley and daughter of Walter Hungerford of Farley Castle, Wiltshire. He left the earl of Essex a tablet jewel set with more than eighty diamonds, with a picture of the earl's father and $30 in cash to prepare the jewel for the picture in 'Remembrance and full satisfaction of all the favour and benefits which I received from his most noble father' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/144, fols. 201'v'-202'r').

He was called to the bar on 8 February 1594 and became a bencher and autumn reader in 1614. He was a JP from 1603, attended quarter sessions as regularly as his Ogwell relatives, and was more active in taking examinations and drawing up recognizances. He served as the first recorder of Bradninch until he moved to Creedywiger, just outside Crediton, when his wife inherited the estate in 1618, and spent over $4000 consolidating it. He had a house in Exeter and sometimes acted on behalf of the city. Even though their estates were some distance apart, there were close contacts between the Ogwell and Creedy families which began before they were more intimately linked by the marriage of Richard of Creedy's eldest daughter Mary to Sir Richard [iii] of East Ogwell. Neither of Richard of Creedy's sons married, so a quarter of his estate passed to the Ogwell family by the right of Mary as a coheir. His memorial representing him and his wife kneeling in prayer, survives in Upton Hellions church.

Thomas [iv] Reynell (1624-1698) was the eldest surviving son of Sir Richard [iii] Reynell of East Ogwell and his wife, Mary. On 5 October 1640 he was admitted to Exeter College, Oxford, and stayed in the lodgings of the rector, John Prideaux, who had married his aunt Mary and may well have influenced his religious thinking. He went on to the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1649. On 30 June 1648 he married Mary Bennett, niece of Lady Croke, widow of Sir George Croke, judge of the king's bench. They lived with her until they moved to West Ogwell on 6 April 1650. 
Thomas Reynell sat on the bench from 1647 through all the changes of government until 1676, when he was removed at the request of the earl of Bath, but even so was appointed sheriff in 1677. On 22 May 1685 he was arrested at his house at night 'to appear before Council to answer for treasonable practices' (Devon RO, 4652M/F5/1) but no grounds could be found for convicting him. He was restored to the bench in October 1687 and resumed the same conscientious attendance characteristic of his family. A later member of his family wrote in the diary that he was 'a hearty well wisher of Revolution' and entertained at West Ogwell part of the company that 'attended our Deliverance' in 1688. He was MP for Devon in 1654 and 1656 and for Ashburton, a borough with a considerable dissenting party, in 1659 and again in 1677, 1679, 1681, and 1689. His younger brother, Sir Richard [v], baronet (1625-1699), who had been deprived of his judgeship of the Irish king's bench, held the seat in 1690. 
Thomas Reynell's first wife had died in September 1671, survived by their two daughters. On 28 July 1673 he married Elizabeth, widow of William Vincent and daughter of James Gould of Exeter, merchant. Thomas Reynell died on 15 January 1698. His eldest son, Richard [iv] Reynell (1677-1735), did not marry and was predeceased by his younger brother, so the Reynell estates passed to Rebecca Taylor, the daughter of his half-sister Mary.

Lucy Reynell (bap. 1577, d. 1652), whom he married in 1600, was the daughter of Robert Brandon, a London merchant. Richard [ii] was able to purchase and enlarge Forde House in the parish of Wolborough, where the life of his wife records that he collected a great library of works of scholarship, befitting a man notable for 'depth of learning and tongues'. He was knighted at Theobalds on 25 July 1622, the year in which his only child, Jane, married Sir William Waller (later the parliamentary general) and 'had a very great marriage of her' (Devon RO, 4652M/F5/1). Sir Richard died in 1634 and was buried on 25 January at Wolborough. His lands were inherited by Margaret, only surviving child of Jane, who married Sir William Courtenay. 
Lucy Reynell lived until 18 April 1652. Her character was extolled in the 'Life and Death of the Religious and Virtuous Lady' by Edward Reynell. This book reveals her attitude to the religious changes of her times, she 'warily avoided Superstition on one side and Faction on the other' and refused to make new friends by changing her old religion. She strictly observed the sabbath and all fasts and instructed the members of her household. She also managed a 'good spread table' and entertained 'such persons of quality as resorted to her house' -- her guests included the king and his household in 1625. When at leisure she worked on tapestry and made clothes for the poor. She built a home for four widows of ministers who were granted $5 p.a. in perpetuity. A charity still exists in her name. 
The two youngest sons of Richard and Agnes Reynell, George and Carew, cut their ties with Devon, selling the land inherited from their father to their brother Sir Thomas. George then embarked on three years of travel and Carew made his way at court. In 1597 George Reynell acquired the office of warden of the Fleet prison when he married Elizabeth, daughter of Valentine Browne of Lincolnshire and widow of Edward Tyrell, the previous warden. Later he became marshall of king's bench and was the object of several petitions against his conduct in this office, which he left to Carewe, his only son from his first marriage. Sir George (as he had become in 1603) made a second marriage to Ethelred, daughter of Sir Edward Peacock of Finchley, with whom he had three sons and one daughter. He died in July 1628.

Ritchie Graham (d. 1592), magician. They were tried in central courts in the course of perhaps the most extensive outbreak of witchcraft prosecutions in Scotland (1591-7), for an alleged conspiracy to assassinate King James VI, described in the pamphlet 'Newes from Scotland' (1591). They were supposed to have raised by witchcraft a magical storm in an attempt to sink the king's ship as he and his bride, Anne of Denmark, returned from their Scandinavian honeymoon to Scotland in 1590. According to their confessions these deeds were done at witches' conventions attended by the devil. One of these took place at the Old Kirk in North Berwick -- hence the naming of the group as the North Berwick witches, when in fact none of them lived there. 
In fact the outbreak centred geographically on Tranent, Haddingtonshire, where Fian was schoolmaster. Tranent, an inland village between Edinburgh and North Berwick, featured in all the major witch-hunts of the period, and was the scene of a significant case as late as 1659. As elsewhere in the county, there was an uneasy co-existence of Catholicism and protestantism across all social groups, and tensions had been increased by dearth and by outbreaks of plague, including a prolonged epidemic between 1584 and 1588. The village also provided the most zealous local witch-hunters of the 1590-92 episode: David Seton, bailie to the recusant Lord Seton, and Bailie Seton's son David Seton the younger. Bailie Seton was the employer of a maidservant, Geillis Duncan, whom he tortured privately on suspicion of witchcraft. It was Geillis who implicated Agnes Sampson, a respected local midwife and magical healer, as a witch. Barbara Napier was one of Agnes's higher status clients -- which later led to her implication. At a later stage Geillis also seems to have implicated Euphame MacCalzean, Seton's own much richer sister-in-law. There is some evidence that family tension may have led to this accusation; perhaps it was done in the hope of seizing Euphame's considerable estates of Cliftonhall. It is about these two high-status female accused witches that we know most. Of the others we know little beyond their confessions. 
Euphame MacCalzean was born before 9 November 1558, the illegitimate daughter of Thomas MacCalzean, Lord Cliftonhall ('c'.1520-1581), senator of the college of justice and from a famous Edinburgh legal family. Her life seems to have been characterized by riches and friction. She was legitimated by her father in 1558 and inherited estates and money worth thousands of pounds Scots. As a condition of marriage in 1570, her husband, Patrick Moscrop, adopted her surname, becoming Patrick MacCalzean. The relationship was unhappy and she was later accused of trying to kill him. The marriage produced three heiress daughters but apparently no surviving sons. Euphame's attempts to marry her daughters into the local elite created conflicts with Sir James Sandilands, a royal favourite. She also had to go to court against relatives to protect her estates. These factors may have been crucial in her accusation as a witch in a hunt started by her brother-in-law. 
Barbara Napier, daughter of Alexander Napier of Ingliston ('b'. before 1529, died 1572) and Isobell Litill (died in or after 1578), came from a family of Edinburgh burgesses. She had married her first husband, George Ker, an overseas book dealer, about 1572. After his death at La Rochelle in September 1576, she married, probably in 1578, Archibald Douglas, brother to the laird of Corshogill. She and her husband had been in service to the countess of Angus, Lady Jean Lyon, at Smeton, Dalkeith. Anxieties over the health of her husband and children and the favour of her mistress led her to consult Agnes Sampson for charms. In consequence of a dispute with her employer, Barbara was dismissed and there was a wrangle over a pension. She thus lacked high-level support from that quarter when Sampson denounced her. It may be, however, that when accused she sought alternative patronage from Francis Stewart, fifth earl of Bothwell, who had just been made lord lieutenant of the borders. She knew Bothwell's wife and had met the earl himself while she was in service to Lady Angus. 
The initial accusations against the lower ranking men and women seem to have been part of a local witch-hunt which had begun in early 1590, but at some point treason accusations were made, which led to central involvement by the king himself in late November 1590. Once the accusations reached the royal court, they became part of a power struggle in which factions tried to persuade the tortured witch-suspects to incriminate political rivals. This finally led in April 1591 to the earl of Bothwell being called before the privy council to answer accusations of being the ringleader of the witches' conspiracy. His connections with two of the accused witches, Barbara Napier and Ritchie Graham, were used in evidence against him. Bothwell was warded in Edinburgh Castle but escaped. Those mentioned above, however, were not so lucky. All were tried and, despite MacCalzean's lawyer kin, all were executed in 1591 or 1592 (Ritchie Graham) with the possible exception of Barbara Napier. 
Barbara was tried on charges of witchcraft, treason, and consulting with witches. She was found guilty only of the last charge and was sentenced to death for it at the king's behest. This was the first time the crime, though theoretically a capital one, had ever been punished by execution. The king then launched an assize of error -- a legal move to cancel her acquittal on the other charges by establishing that the jury of Edinburgh burgesses had wilfully erred in finding her innocent. It is not known what happened to Barbara but the existence of a second escheat for her estate in 1594 may point to her death by then; her husband was described as deceased. She was certainly dead by 1600 when her daughter tried to establish rights to her pension. It is likely that she was burnt, but where is unknown. 
The trials of the North Berwick witches had marked a watershed. It was last instance of such prosecutions being subordinated to a political intent, the first major trial of witchcraft under criminal law, and the first occasion on which continental witch theory was deployed. The wave of prosecutions came to a sudden end in 1597 when the king, whose interest in the phenomenon of witchcraft had helped to stimulate them, published his attack on sceptics, 'Daemonologie', but also revoked witchcraft commissions.

Mark Haliburton (d. c.1456), briefly entered the limelight 'c'.1449 as a result of association with the eighth and ninth earls of Douglas. Although apparently a layman, Haliburton was secretary to the latter. He escaped at first the forfeiture of the earl and his associates in 1455 through a display of loyalty to James II, and began to develop a career at court, even being rewarded with land forfeited by Douglas; but for some unknown reason he was himself forfeited, and perhaps executed, 'c'.1456. 
It is possible that before his death Sir Walter Haliburton assumed (simultaneously with some other Scottish landed families) a peerage title, but the evidence is uncertain. It is more likely that it was his eldest son,

Alexander Abernethy (d. in or before 1315), who swore fealty to Edward I in 1291; his rewards between 1301 and 1303 included the office of warden of Scotland between the Forth and the Mounth. While he was deprived of office in King Edward's final ordinances of 1305 and consequently took part in the national struggle, his loyalties were firmly for Balliol's claims over Bruce's. He was absent from Robert I's first parliament in 1309, received Clackmannan in Stirlingshire from Edward II in 1310, and led an unsuccessful defence of Dundee against Edward Bruce in 1312. In 1314, Abernethy having been forfeited and settled on the earl of Angus, Alexander went to England, and he was dead by 1315. 
The Abernethy line was continued in the person of William Abernethy of Saltoun, Haddingtonshire, from another branch of the family; the exact line of inheritance is obscure and did not include the forfeited barony of Abernethy itself. He subscribed the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 and witnessed a charter of King Robert in 1322, but otherwise little is known of his life until his forfeiture following the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333. He was among the knights at the court of David II, however, from whom he received a grant of Rothiemay in Banffshire in 1345. He died in 1346, probably at the battle of Nevilles Cross, and was succeeded by his son, George Abernethy of Saltoun and Rothiemay, who suffered imprisonment in the Tower of London after his own capture at Nevilles Cross. George Abernethy appears as a witness to a marriage contract in 1370, but died the following year, when he was succeeded by his elder son, George (died before 1400). His second son, John, went to the Holy Land, where he had died by 1381. The younger George Abernethy was succeeded by his son, William, who served as a hostage for the ransom of James I, his estates being valued at 500 marks sterling. When he died, without heirs, before 1428, he was succeeded by his brother, Laurence.

Charles William Nevill (1815-1888), eldest son of Richard Janion, born at Glanmor House on 7 May 1815, assumed local control on his father's death, having been a partner since 1841. He was educated at Swansea grammar school and Rugby School. He married in 1841 Jane (1820-1894), daughter of David Davies of Swansea, and they lived initially at Glanmor House and, from about 1850, at a newly built residence, Westfa House, in the village of Felin-foel, near Llanelli. Six out of ten children of the marriage survived to adulthood, Hugh ['see below'] being the only son. The company's smelting works and collieries flourished during the first two decades of his control, but then steadily contracted under the combined effects of the general decline in Britain's copper and lead smelting industries, caused by previous ore exporting countries starting their own smelting, and the working to exhaustion of the profitable seams at the company's collieries; and he became the first member of his family to preside over a decline in the company's fortunes. Unconnected with changes in partnership, the company name changed to Nevill, Druce & Co. in 1873. 
Charles William was particularly active in public life. A magistrate since 1838, he was also deeply involved in the poor-law guardians, the board of health, the harbour commissioners, and the school board. He was a deputy lieutenant of Carmarthenshire, the high sheriff in 1868, and the MP (Conservative) for the Carmarthenshire United Boroughs from 1874 to 1876. Strongly ecumenical in outlook, he supported the provision of nonconformist chapels at Llanelli and helped fund the building of the Anglican church at Felin-foel. At the age of sixty-six ill health confined him to his home, causing his withdrawal from participation in most affairs. He died at Westfa on 7 June 1888 aged seventy-three, and was buried in the graveyard of Felin-foel church.

Richard Nevill (1817-1892), the second son of Richard Janion, became an industrialist in his own right, involved in Llanelli's iron, tinplate, and manufacturing industries for most of his working life. He was born at Glanmor House on 6 June 1817 and educated at Thornbury, near Bristol. He married about 1849 Mary Sophia ('b'. 1821), daughter of Joseph Willis of Crewkerne, Somerset, and lived at Felin-foel House near his brother's residence of Westfa. There were three children from the marriage. Initially, he joined his father at the Llanelli copperworks but in 1839 left to become a partner in the Wern ironworks, a small foundry originally established at Llanelli by his uncle William Yalden junior. He expanded this into a large concern, known locally as Nevill's foundry, specializing in the manufacture of heavy machinery, works and marine engines, boilers, and other products. He was also involved in the establishment and management of iron and tinplate works in and around Llanelli. He did not particularly involve himself in public affairs, although he acted as a magistrate and was deputy lieutenant of Carmarthenshire and occasional chairman of the poor-law guardians. He was a staunch Conservative and a pillar of the Anglican church, involved with his brother in the establishment of the church at Felin-foel. In later years he suffered from heart problems, and he died suddenly on 5 June 1892, aged seventy-four, while visiting his wife's birthplace at Crewkerne.

William Henry Nevill (1822-1894), the fifth son of Richard Janion, worked for his father's company for many years before becoming a builder of iron sailing and steam ships. He was born at Glanmor House on 15 September 1822 and educated at Bridgnorth, Shropshire, before joining the company as an assistant to his father. About 1857 he married Rachel Louisa Fry of Woodford, Essex, a granddaughter of Elizabeth Fry the reformer and philanthropist. They lived initially at Llangennech Park, then moved to Ferryside, some 12 miles from Llanelli, in 1870. There were six children from the marriage. 
His family's long experience of shipping and metalliferous industry undoubtedly led William Henry into shipbuilding at a time when iron was replacing wood in ship construction, and in 1852 he took over an existing shipyard and invested in his brother Richard's ironworks, the Old Lodge, which supplied plates and other iron products to the yard. Considerable investment was made, but little appears to have been produced in the way of ships in the 1850s and substantial losses must have resulted. Shipbuilding ceased and he became a junior partner in his father's company, acting as manager of the Cambrian lead and silver works which had commenced smelting in 1848. Shipbuilding was restarted on a much larger scale in 1863 at a time of expansion and prosperity in national and local trade, with the ships initially supplied to a new company, the Llanelly Iron Shipping Co. Ltd, in which he and his brothers Charles William and Richard were substantial investors. At least twenty-three sailing ships and two steamships were built to Lloyd's highest classification over the following decade, ten of the sailing ships being purchased by the new company. Unfortunately, the boom shipping market of the 1860s soon slumped and there was little demand for well-built, but expensive, sailing vessels from the smaller shipyards. William Henry withdrew from shipbuilding, selling the yard in 1874 and closing the Old Lodge ironworks two years later. 
A talented person with a number of diverse patents to his name, William Henry had been unsuccessful in his business life, facing bankruptcy on two separate occasions and being kept from insolvency by his brothers at considerable cost to the family's finances. He died of heart failure at his home, Robert's Rest, Ferryside, on 8 September 1894, aged seventy-one.

In 1886 he married Maud ('b'. 1858/9), daughter of Frederick Elkington of Wolverley, Worcestershire, but previously a copper smelter at Burry Port, near Llanelli. There were no children from the marriage. Involved in the company since his father's health failed in the early 1880s, Hugh was admitted as managing partner in 1889 but found himself presiding over a declining concern. Copper smelting ceased in 1894, subsequent activity concentrating on small-scale refining and the manufacture of copper sheets, plates, and wire; the lead and silver works closed in 1896, and the last remaining colliery was abandoned in 1907. The company's dock and local railway system were separated from the parent concern in 1911 with the formation of Nevill's Dock and Railway Ltd, the company itself becoming Nevill, Druce & Co. Ltd in 1920. Unlike his father, Hugh hardly involved himself in public life, acting only as a magistrate. He left his home at Burry Port to live in Cobham, Surrey, shortly before his death from heart disease in a London clinic on 14 January 1924, aged sixty-eight.

There were three daughters and one son, Charles William ['see below'], from the marriage. He qualified as a mining engineer and was appointed manager of the Llanelli copperworks in 1894. The natural family successor to his childless cousin Hugh, he was admitted to the partnership in 1913, but then spent the duration of the First World War on active service, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel and being awarded the DSO for gallantry in the Dardanelles. He became managing director of the two limited companies after his cousin's death in 1924 and set about rationalizing operations, closing the refineries and hot rolling mills, and concentrating on the cold rolling of copper plates and the drawing of electrical wire. Active in public life, he was awarded the territorial decoration for his involvement in the Territorial Army, and was chairman of the Llanelli magistrates, a member of the governing body of the Church in Wales, and also a committed Rechabite who often lectured members of his workforce on the evils of drink. He was made a freeman of the borough of Llanelli in 1923 and acted as a deputy lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. He died of heart failure at his home, Brondeg, Ferryside, on 11 January 1946, aged seventy-eight.

Charles William Nevill (1907-1973), son of Richard Austin, born at Ferryside on 16 August 1907, was the last member of his family involved in the town's industrial and public life. Educated at Clifton College, Bristol, he married in 1947 Philippa ('b'. 1916), daughter of Captain H. P. Farrell of Karachi, India. He joined the company in 1925 and was appointed a director just before the start of the Second World War. During war service he attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel, was mentioned in dispatches, and was appointed OBE. He became chairman and managing director of the two limited companies on his father's death in 1946. The dock closed in 1951, and the copperworks became a copper wire and cable manufacturing subsidiary of a national company in 1961, although both Nevill's Dock and Railway Ltd and Nevill, Druce & Co. Ltd continued in existence, with Charles William remaining as their lifelong principal. Active in public life, he was a magistrate, became lord lieutenant of Carmarthenshire in 1967, and was made honorary colonel of the 4th (volunteer) battalion of the Royal regiment of Wales in 1972. He suffered a stroke shortly before Christmas 1972 and died at Llanelli General Hospital on 2 January 1973, aged sixty-five; his death marked the end of his family's 168 years of continuous involvement in Llanelli's industrial life. 
The Nevill family was instrumental in ensuring that Llanelli developed into a major centre of heavy industry. The first Charles Nevill and his son Richard Janion were the leading participants, building an industrial empire of national importance which attracted other investors and businesses to the town. The family's long-term commitment to the area provided stability of employment through many difficult periods, the company's reputation as considerate employers by the standards of the day being reflected in particularly good labour relations. The working to exhaustion of the company's coalfield and the adherence to obviously declining copper and lead interests in the late nineteenth century, when steel and tinplate manufacturing were becoming the staple industries of south Wales, hastened the family's economic decline and ensured its eventual disappearance from the industrial life of the region.

Robert Crichton (d. 1585), bishop of Dunkeld. Crichton, the younger son of Sir Patrick Crichton of Cranstoun Riddel, had become coadjutor bishop of Dunkeld in March 1543, assisting his uncle, Bishop George Crichton, and had opposed the nomination of John Hamilton as his uncle's successor in the see in January 1544. He also resisted Donald Campbell, nominated as Hamilton's successor in March 1548, and was in office as bishop of Dunkeld by 12 April 1554. At the August 1560 parliament he had, with Hamilton, hesitated over the confession of faith, but had acknowledged the presence of abuses in the church. He did not oppose the confession, but was never reconciled to the kirk. His loyalty to Mary probably stemmed from a combination of his Roman Catholicism and his family's general support for the queen. 
The castilians held the upper hand in Edinburgh for two years. They established an alternative administration to that of the regent, John Erskine, earl of Mar, and dismissed the Edinburgh town council. They were sustained by a financial system supervised by Kirkcaldy and two Edinburgh goldsmiths,

James Mossman (d. 1573) and his brother-in-law

James Cockie (d. 1573). Both were well established, and Cockie had been deacon of the incorporation of goldsmiths of Edinburgh in 1563-4 and 1564-5. Mossman's large house on the High Street in Edinburgh has, since at least the nineteenth century, been misidentified as John Knox's house. Cockie had a network of aristocratic patrons, including the regent Mar for whom he crafted the 'Erskine ewer', an elaborate crystal vessel. Guaranteeing, arranging, and clearing loans was an established part of Mossman's business. Mossman and Cockie helped to keep the castilians afloat by advising in the evaluation of various items of royal jewellery which were pawned to sympathizers outside the castle. They probably also helped with the production of coins in Mary's name. 
In June 1571 the castilians held their own parliament in the Tolbooth, the customary meeting place for Scottish parliaments. Maitland was able to boast to foreign courts that the Marian parliament consisted of the principal nobility of Scotland, while the regent's 'creeping parliament' in Canongate, under regular bombardment from Edinburgh Castle, was representative of only a faction of lesser men. However, the creeping parliament began the forfeiture of the principal Marians, including William and John Maitland and their brother Thomas Maitland (d. 1572) ['see under 'Maitland, Sir Richard, of Lethington], a process followed through in August by the regent's parliament at Stirling, where Crichton was among the forfeited, losing his see. 
A truce between the two sides, negotiated in July 1572, was broken by the king's party, who used it to infiltrate Edinburgh and establish control of the town. When James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, became regent in November 1572, only the castle remained in the queen's party's hands. Sir James Melville, Melville of Murdocairnie's brother, represented Morton at negotiations with the castilians, but Kirkcaldy was reluctant to yield the castle, even with a guarantee that the castilians' forfeited lands and possessions would be restored, without the restitution being extended to his allies in the rest of the country -- principally the followers of the Hamiltons and the earl of Huntly. In January 1573 Morton resumed the bombardment of the castle, then containing 160 officers and men. None the less it was not until the Hamilton and Huntly families were persuaded to return to the fold at the pacification of Perth in February that the regent could direct all his attention towards the castilians. 
In April, Kirkcaldy and his followers were presented with their last opportunity for an honourable surrender. On their rejection of this offer Morton brought into action the English army and its artillery, which had arrived at Leith the previous month. The bombardment began on 17 May, and Elizabeth's ordnance gave the regent a decisive advantage: Kirkcaldy was forced to surrender on 28 May. Most of the garrison were allowed to go free, many of them being recruited shortly afterwards for service in Sweden. On the other hand Kirkcaldy, the Maitland brothers, Home, Melville of Murdocairnie, Crichton, and a few others were to be 'reserved and kept where the regent shall appoint' ('CSP Scot.', 4.571), pending further discussions with Elizabeth. The latter, however, eventually agreed that Morton should have the final word on their fate. 
Kirkcaldy of Grange, despite appeals for clemency, was hanged on 3 August, fulfilling Knox's prophecy. His brother Thomas, a prisoner since January 1573, was hanged on the same day, as were Mossman and Cockie. Mossman had been forfeited in April 1573 for assisting the rebels and for producing illegal currency. Most of the other leading castilians were given indefinite terms of imprisonment. Maitland of Thirlestane spent the next five years in various forms of confinement, but thereafter his fortunes greatly improved: once James VI assumed personal control of the kingdom he became royal secretary and subsequently chancellor. Home's life was spared only through the intercession of two of his kinsmen, the lairds of Cowdenknowes and Manderston, and he was not released from imprisonment until shortly before his death in 1575. Melville of Murdocairnie was reprieved at the instigation of Queen Elizabeth, but remained imprisoned for about a year. Crichton was committed for a period to Blackness Castle, and from December 1573 was bailed for $10,000 into the keeping of Sir Walter Ker of Cessford in Edinburgh. From May 1576 he was allowed to live at Seton or another property of Lord Seton, or else remain in Edinburgh. After securing financial support from his successor at Dunkeld, James Paton, he was restored to the bishopric of Dunkeld on 22 August 1584. He died a few days before 26 March 1585, when the town council of Edinburgh agreed to the request of James VI that Crichton be buried in the church of St Giles.

In the event she married Archibald Campbell, fifth earl of Argyll ('c'.1532-1573), in 1554; she was divorced from him in June 1573. Her sister Margaret Stewart is obscure, and the name could even be a clerical error for Jean herself, since she was the subject of the same marriage offer to the Homes five years after the first. While there appears to be a preponderance of sons among James's children, unfortunately there is no record of any unacknowledged daughters.

Robert [i] Stewart ['see 'Stewart, Robert (1533-1593)] was the son of Euphemia Elphinstone ('b'. 1509, died after 1564), daughter of Alexander, first Lord Elphinstone, who later married John Bruce of Cultmalindie. Robert [i] became commendator of the abbey of Holyrood, and later earl of Orkney.

John Leslie of Parkhill (d. 1585), second son of William Leslie, third earl of Rothes (died 1513), and Janet ('fl'. 'c'.1490- 'c'.1520), daughter of Sir Michael Balfour of Montquhannie. His presence illustrates the high rank of many of the castilians. He had served in the household of James V from about 1534 until 1541, about which time he married Euphemia Moncrieff; they had two daughters. After being captured at the battle of Solway Moss on 24 November 1542, Leslie was released by the English under assurance. His presence among the conspirators owed little or nothing to English pressure; although characterized as 'rough and ready' (Sanderson, 223), he was committed to church reform and was one of the Fife lairds outraged by the execution of Wishart. Another Fife laird of protestant sympathies was

James Melville of Carnbee (d. in or before 1550), who 'mourned Wishart as a friend' (ibid.). Other participants, like the Leslies and Melville, shared a dislike of Beaton's person and power: they were 'no artificial group merely thrown together by their grievances' but a 'closely-related and allied circle' (ibid., 224). William Kirkcaldy of Grange (c.1520-1573) held protestant convictions; his father, Sir James Kirkcaldy of Grange (d. 1556), who joined the castilians after the murder of Beaton, was also a protestant and had been removed as treasurer of the realm in 1543 by Beaton's influence. Peter Carmichael of Balmedie, another conspirator, was from a family with a history of dependence on Beaton, while David Monypenny of Pitmilly was Beaton's cousin. The exact number of conspirators is unknown, but there were probably between twelve and eighteen. 
The murderers gained entrance to St Andrews Castle at about six o'clock in the morning of 29 May 1546, hiding among the 100 or so members of the garrison, masons, and members of the workforce engaged in rebuilding the castle as they walked across the lowered drawbridge. They seized the entrance, expelled the labourers, stole the keys from the gatekeeper, Ambrose Stirling, whom they then killed, and raised the drawbridge. The four principal assassins, Norman Leslie, William Kirkcaldy, James Melville, and John Leslie of Parkhill, made their way to Beaton's private chambers and with burning coals intimidated him into opening the door. According to John Knox, Beaton was stabbed twice by John Leslie and Peter Carmichael before James Melville declared that 'This work and judgment of God (although it be secret) ought to be done with greater gravity' ('Knox's History', 1.77) and at swordpoint urged Beaton: 'Repent thee of thy former wicked life, but especially of the shedding of the blood of that notable instrument of God, Master George Wishart, which albeit the flame of fire consumed before men, yet cries it a vengeance upon thee, and we from God are sent to revenge it: For here, before my god, I protest, that neither the hetterent [hatred] of thy person, the love of thy riches, nor the fear of any trouble thou could have done to me in particular, moved, nor moves me to strike thee; but only because thou hast been and remains an obstinate enemy against Christ Jesus and his holy Evangel. (ibid., 1.78)' Melville then dealt the fatal blows by running Beaton through two or three times with his sword. The murderers dragged Beaton's body to the parapet to display to the townsfolk. One 'knaif' ('Historie and Cronicles', 2.84), possibly Beaton's page Amand Guthrie, then urinated into the corpse's mouth. 
The government of the regent, James Hamilton, second earl of Arran, was heavily entangled by a siege and negotiation at Dumbarton, but the conspirators chose not to escape the castle. Beaton had enough friends to make it unwise for Norman Leslie and his friends to hazard public exposure, and the castle was their protection and their safeguard. While the government was distracted the castilians were joined by other supporters including Norman Leslie's brothers William and Robert, and the diplomat Henry Balnaves (d. 1570). A further advantage was the presence of James Hamilton, master of Arran, the regent's son, in the castle; this encouraged Arran to compromise with the castilians but they rejected his proposal that he arrange a papal pardon. The conspirators were forfeited by parliament on 16 August and that month a siege of St Andrews began. 
William Kirkcaldy of Grange travelled to England in August to request support from Henry VIII. Kirkcaldy was gratefully received by the English king, who sent north essential supplies such as powder, food, and cannon. Despite English assistance, by December the castilians were severely weakened by disease and the lack of food. However, government forces had failed to overcome them. An impressive mine, hewn through solid rock, perhaps by Ayrshire miners, left a permanent monument to the siege but had not made an impact on the castilians' defences. The besiegers were also afflicted by plague. In December it was agreed that the government would seek a papal pardon for the castilians as long as they did not deliver the castle and the master of Arran to England. The castilians hoped that, while Arran negotiated with the pope and with France to secure the pardon, better weather would arrive and with it new supplies from England. For the next six months the castilians enjoyed relative freedom of access to the town of St Andrews and the surrounding country. They moved as an armed band for their own protection, but also as a gang of oppression. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie recalled their riding wherever they pleased 'burnand and raissand fyre' ('Historie and Cronicles', 2.86). He particularly highlighted how they 'wssit thair bodyis in leichorie witht fair wemen, servand thair appietyte as they thocht goode' (ibid., 2.86-7). 
The death of Henry VIII of England in January 1547 seemed at first to confirm the castilians' hopes. In March the new English lord protector, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, formally made the principal castilians English pensioners and provided food and wages for their soldiers. The castilians agreed to hand over the castle to an English force and send the master of Arran into Somerset's custody in England, as part of the English plan to force the marriage of Mary, queen of Scots, to the new English king, Edward VI. The agreement may have encouraged the castilians to reject the papal pardon obtained by Arran in March or April, on the grounds that the clause 'remittibus irremissibile' described the remitted crime as one that could not be remitted and thus suggested that the murderers of Beaton were not completely absolved. Several castilians, including Leslie of Parkhill and Balnaves, visited England in early 1547. In April, Balnaves supposedly delivered the signatures of twenty-three Scottish nobles who had pledged themselves to England. The castilians received in return the services of an Italian surveyor, Guillaume di Rossetti, as well as armaments and construction materials for the castle. Meanwhile, John Knox (c.1514-1572) arrived in St Andrews in April, accompanied by three pupils. With Knox in St Andrews the castle became something of an evangelical city on a hill, Knox first engaging Catholics at the university in debate, and then preaching in the town itself. 
The castilians' new concordat with England was immediately compromised by political changes in France following the death of Francois I in March 1547. The new king, Henri II, was politically aligned with the family of the Scottish queen dowager, Mary of Guise, and by May had agreed to send a French force to end the siege. This was unknown to the castilians and their English allies. A French fleet probably arrived off St Andrews on 16 July, and began a siege, led by an Italian mercenary, Leon Strozzi, which ended with the surrender of the castilians on 30 July. The castilians were first imprisoned in the castle, and then transferred to the holds of the French vessels. 
The castilians became protestant martyrs, and Knox a galley slave. However, few of the castilians suffered excessively. Only James Melville of Carnbee died in captivity, in Brest Castle, Brittany, before Mary of Guise and the French agreed to the release of the last of the castilians in July 1550. Norman Leslie translated his imprisonment in France into service to Henri II. Knox was freed within nineteen months, thanks to English diplomatic pressure, and became a royal chaplain to Edward VI. Most of the castilians made their way home and were eventually restored to their property: Leslie of Parkhill was restored in 1563 and was formally discharged from his part in the murder of Beaton in 1575, before he died on 6 September 1585. William Kirkcaldy of Grange found preferment of France before returning to Scotland where he eventually became one of the castilians in Edinburgh ('act'. 1570-1573).

Princess Caroline Elizabeth (1713-1757), daughter of George II, enjoyed a similar but quieter life. She was born on 30 May/10 June 1713 at Herrenhausen, and moved to Britain with her sisters in 1714. After the death of Queen Caroline in 1737 she took some responsibility for the upbringing of her younger sisters Mary and Louisa. In the 1730s and early 1740s she enjoyed a close friendship with Lord Hervey. In 1743 Horace Walpole reported that her marriage to Duke Adolphus Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, later king of Sweden, was being discussed at the initiative of Russia, but Caroline remained unmarried. She suffered increasingly from ill health and in the 1750s went into 'absolute confinement' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 21.165) in St James's Palace. She died on 28 December 1757 at St James's Palace, and was buried on 5 January 1758 in Henry VII's chapel, Westminster Abbey.

William Longman (1882-1967), the son of C. J. Longman, the first of them educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, and the second at Harrow School and University College, Oxford. They both became partners three years later, once again specializing in their interests. Robert Guy was a highly intelligent and sensitive publisher with a lively interest in music and literary tastes of his own. It was he who encouraged novelists as different as Elizabeth Bowen, Stella Gibbons, and Mary Renault and the American author and playwright Thornton Wilder. He did not retire until 1948. William, always known in Paternoster Row as Mr Willie, concentrated on finance and accounts, inheriting a traditional and ritualized system, but, following the 'Companies Act' of 1914, one required to follow standard procedures of accounting. 
William was a shy man, who by the time when he retired in 1964 after thirty years as chairman was something of a recluse. Yet, like his father, he was involved in the higher politics of publishing. C. J. Longman had been first president of the newly formed Publishers' Association in 1896 and again from 1902 to 1914, and had given his full support to the net book agreement, regulating the retail prices of books, which had been initiated by Frederick Macmillan. William, who was president from 1929 to 1931, was described by a fellow publisher, Stanley Unwin, as the best president the association ever had. 
In their own publishing Robert Guy Longman and William Longman had to help steer their ship, still the Longman publishing logo, through the troubled seas of two wars and unprecedented depression. There was one family tragedy too. Eight weeks after the beginning of the First World War William's younger brother Frederick (1890-1914) was killed in action. During the depression the house of Longman had to turn for financial assistance to an outsider, Kenneth Boyd Potter, a member of a shipping family with its own rich and varied dynastic history, who became a director, bringing in necessary capital in 1926 and playing a bigger part than any of the Longmans when it became a public company in 1948. He was one of three directors who then disposed of some of their shares as part of a capital reorganization, William receiving $57,252 for his and Robert Guy $72,996. 
It would have been impossible to foresee this outcome on 29 December 1940 when at the height of the German air assault on Britain 39 Paternoster Row was totally destroyed along with neighbouring buildings. The fires that burnt there, started by incendiary bombs, were far more devastating than those of an earlier fire in 1861 which led the Longmans to have built on the site an imposing new building in Portland stone 'in the Renaissance style'. Literature, supported by the Arts and Science, was represented in the keystone of the main arch. It was with these two fires in mind -- and the great fire of London of 1666 -- that Blagden wrote 'Fire More than Water', noting that fires had their phoenixes, a lesson of 1940 as much as of 1861. 
In 1939 part of the Longman business had already been transferred to Wimbledon, and it was to suburban houses there that Robert Guy and William Longman now moved out, carrying on their business as far as possible as usual after a back list of nearly 6000 titles had been reduced to twelve. And there was further fire to come, for in April 1941 the old Ship Binding Works was put out of action. Even then the trials were not over, but in 1947 it was possible for the Longmans and their employees to return to London, this time to the West End not the City -- first to 6 and 7 Clifford Street, and next, in 1961, to 48 Grosvenor Street, not far away. These had been eighteenth-century domestic houses, built about the time when Thomas Longman started his business in 1724. 
There was no one single domestic residence passed on from one generation to another. The first Thomas Longman had lived and worked in Paternoster Row. So, too, had several of the later members of his family. Thomas Norton Longman (1771-1842) was the first to move out from the City to Mount Grove, Hampstead, in 1798: all his children were married in Hampstead parish church, and a bust in memory of him was placed there, donated by J. R. McCulloch, the political economist, and other friends. 
After his marriage in 1838 Thomas Longman (1804-1879) moved to a Nash house in Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, moving again further out of London ten years later, but keeping a London house in Sussex Gardens, where the youngest of his five daughters was born. It was the daughters whom he commemorated in a stained glass window in the Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street, complete with ships and black swans. Thomas moved later to Hampshire, where in 1860 he built an imposing new house at Farnborough Hill, designed in deep rose brick by Henry Edward Kendall, and set in a substantial estate. It too incorporated a frieze of stone terracotta panels depicting in high relief ships in full sail and swans swimming on water surrounded by palm trees. It was not bequeathed to any of his children, however, and two years after his death in 1879 it was acquired by the exiled French Empress Eugenie, who lived there until her own death in 1920. 
Thomas Longman's brother, William, who produced an even larger family consisting of seven daughters and three sons, lived in Hyde Park Square in London before acquiring houses first in Chorleywood and later in Berkhamsted, so that the Longman family, while mostly retaining London houses, was now scattered geographically. It was not until 1908 that the last Thomas Norton Longman, Thomas Longman's eldest son, acquired a substantial country house, Shendish, near Apsley, Hertfordshire, which had been built by Charles Longman, the Dickinson partner, in 1853 and which was occupied after his death in 1873 by his son Arthur (1843-1908), also a partner in the Dickinson paper business. Thomas Norton Longman retired to Shendish in 1919 exactly fifty years after his first arrival at Paternoster Row. He was buried there in a churchyard which was built at the expense of the Longman, Dickinson, Pratt-Barlow, and Evans families. 
Charles James Longman, Thomas Norton Longman's nephew, had a country house in Hertfordshire, Upp Hall, Braughing, near Ware, coincidentally not far from Harlow, where the Longman business was to move in 1968. His elder son, William, recorded that CJ was the last member of the family to live in style. He had four children, three of whom were given public-school and university educations, and possessed a town house, complete with mews and a coachman, as well as his country estate, where he employed seven domestic servants, two gardeners, two labourers, and two gamekeepers. 
The gamekeepers were more than status symbols, for most of the Victorian Longmans, beginning with Thomas Longman (1804-1879), were keenly interested in sports, a few of them more than they were in the business. The first William, deeply involved as he was in business affairs and in his own historical researches, which led him to write several books mainly on medieval English history and the architecture of St Paul's, was a founder member of the Alpine Club and its president from 1871 to 1874. C. J. Longman was an association football blue at Oxford and champion of England at archery in 1883, and along with his partner, the last Thomas Norton Longman, produced many books on different sports in their 'Badminton Library', begun in 1885 with the duke of Beaufort as its editor. CJ himself contributed the volume on archery. The series was supplemented later by a monthly 'Badminton Magazine'. George Henry Longman captained the Eton cricket eleven and Cambridge University, played regularly for the Gentlemen against the Players, and sponsored a Longman cricket club for employees of the business. Arthur Longman (1843-1908), like his father a partner in Dickinson & Co., was master of the Old Berkeley hunt. 
The last of the Longmans, Mark Frederick Kerr Longman (1916-1972), was more interested in the arts than in sports, but he had a country house at Bishopstone, on the top of a hill near Salisbury, an eighteenth-century rectory with Victorian connections. It is reputed to have been the model for Anthony Trollope's Plumstead Episcopi in 'The Warden', which was published by Mark's great-grandfather in 1855. 
Mark was the son of Henry Kerr Longman, who never entered the Longman business, but who came to its rescue as a stockbroker when for the only time in its history it faced banking problems in 1932. Mark's three forenames all came from the female side of his inheritance. In 1874 George Henry Longman had married Mary Frances Kerr, the daughter of Lord Frederic Kerr, whose brother was called Mark, and since the last Thomas Norton Longman had no male heir -- he had four daughters -- and William Longman had no children, it was through Henry Kerr Longman that the two of the last generation of Longmans entered the publishing business. Of his five sons, John Cecil Longman (1912-1965), who never intended to become a publisher, was made a director on the same day as his younger brother Mark, and their cousin, Thomas Michael Longman (1917-1978), only son of Robert Guy Longman. Thomas Michael was the only member of the family to leave the house of Longman. In 1959, unhappy about the decision of his fellow directors not to allow him to extend the theological side of their business, he set up a publishing business of his own, taking with him as partners two of his house colleagues, G. C. Darton and John Todd. 
Mark Longman had joined the house straight from Cambridge in 1938, returning after war service in 1946. Described in the headline of his 'Times' obituary (6 December 1972) as an 'outstanding publisher', he had become head of what was now simply called Longmans in 1964. An effective chairman and a brilliant speaker, he was president of the Publishers' Association from 1969 to 1971, following in the footsteps of an earlier generation of Longmans. He was also an energetic president of the National Book League, believing strongly in the future of the book in an age of new electronic media. 
There were great hopes for the future of the Longman business when it moved out in 1967 to a new building in Harlow New Town. It was designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd and proudly named Longman House. The warehouses had moved out earlier in 1959. The business was still expanding on the educational side with non-Longmans, like John Chapple and John Newsom, who inspired the move to Harlow, playing a major part. The expansion overseas, particularly in Commonwealth countries, had been so substantial that in 1966 a Longman Group of companies was constituted, their locations ranging from Nigeria to Australia, the Caribbean to the Pacific, with Mark as its first chairman. Exports and overseas sales then accounted for three-quarters of the Longman total. They depended on enterprise on the periphery rather than at the centre, where there was a shortage of family capital. In 1968, therefore, Mark initiated and carried through friendly negotiations that resulted in the take-over of the Longman Group by the Financial and Provincial Publishing Company, owned by S. Pearson & Son, and two years later Pearson Longman Ltd was formed. The pedigrees of the Longman and Pearson families, the latter with its origins in Bradford in 1856, sharply contrasted, but the first chairman of Pearson Longman, Patrick Gibson, had been at Eton with Mark and was proud to link the two family names in the company's new title. 
In the same year Mark became vice-chairman of Penguin, and after the death of Sir Allen Lane, founder in 1936 of the famous paperback business, he played a major part in arranging a merger between Pearson Longman Ltd and Penguin. It was not to last, but both companies continued to operate within the Pearson Group, a large conglomerate, dealing in many other products besides books, including porcelain and wine, until Pearson Longman, which flourished in the 1980s under the leadership of Tim Rix, a non-Longman and a non-Pearson, ceased to exist in 1994. That decision was taken not at Harlow but by the Pearson Group in London. 
Mark's widow, Lady Elizabeth Lambart, daughter of the tenth earl of Cavan, who had seen Mark through a long and crippling illness, survived this last landmark event in the Longman story. She had worked briefly inside Longmans as a secretary, and she was proud of the part that Mark, her second cousin, had played not only within the business, but within publishing as a whole. He was also chairman of the Fine Art Society, and his portrait by Graham Sutherland is a worthy memorial.

Sir Hugh Campbell of Cawdor (c.1639-1716), the son of Colin Campbell of Ardersier and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of David Brodie of Brodie, succeeded to the family estates in 1654. In 1660 he was made the ward of the earl of Lauderdale. In 1661, soon after coming of age, he was elected to the Scottish parliament as MP for Nairnshire, for which he continued to sit until 1693. In January 1662 he was contracted to marry Lady Henrietta Stewart, daughter of James, fourth earl of Moray, and the niece of Lauderdale's wife. They had four sons and four daughters. Sir Hugh was active in Scottish politics throughout the Restoration period. He did not join Argyll's rebellion in 1685, but supported the revolution of 1688-9 and was appointed to the Scottish privy council in May 1689. Some suspected his loyalty given the marriage in March 1689 of his second son, Archibald, to the daughter of Duncan Macpherson of Cluny, a Jacobite, and he was suspected of providing Viscount Dundee with information on council deliberations. During the first session of the 1690 parliament he was a member of the Club opposition, and he failed to attend the second session of 1690. He was not reappointed to the privy council in March 1692, but he was excepted from pardon in James II's proclamation of April 1692. He relinquished his seat in parliament to his son, Alexander, in 1693, probably owing to ill health. In 1704 he published his 'Essay on the Lord's Prayer', which advocated the use of the Lord's prayer in public worship. The suppression of his letters to the general assembly on this issue led to the publication of his correspondence with the moderators of the general assembly when the 'Essay' was republished in 1709. Sir Hugh was an opponent of the union of 1707, believing that 'a federal union and free trading would certainly be an advantage' (Innes, 405). He condoned the mobilization of Cawdor men for the Pretender (James Edward Stuart) on 19 September 1715, delegating his authority to his grandson, Duncan Campbell, son of Sir Archibald Campbell of Cluny. His death on 11 March 1716 may have prevented the forfeiture of his estates. He was buried on 29 March.

Sir Alexander Campbell the younger of Cawdor (d. 1697), predeceased his father. After matriculating at King's College, Aberdeen, in 1677, Alexander travelled abroad to France and possibly to Italy. In September 1688 he was contracted to marry Elizabeth (died 1714), daughter of Sir John Lort, second baronet, of Stackpole Court, Pembrokeshire, and Lady Susannah Holles. They had two sons -- the elder, Gilbert, died in 1711 -- and two daughters, one of whom, Susannah, married in 1718 Sir James Campbell, fifth baronet. Alexander sat for Nairnshire in the Scottish parliament in 1693-5, but died shortly after, on 27 August 1697. In 1698 his wife, Lady Campbell, succeeded her brother, Sir Gilbert Lort, third baronet, to the family's Welsh estates. Henceforth, the Campbells of Cawdor ceased to be merely Scottish landowners (with lands primarily in eastern Inverness-shire and Nairnshire, with control also of the islands of Islay and Jura), and became more British in their orientation with extensive interests in Wales. Indeed, there seems to have been some hostility to the Scots within the Lort family, Lady Lort's will making bequests contingent on her grandsons not marrying North Britons. Lady Campbell resided in England with her affairs closely watched over by her brother's friend, Edward Harley, brother of Robert, earl of Oxford from 1711.

Tetley, Joshua (1778-1859), brewer, was born at Armley Lodge, near Leeds, Yorkshire, on 20 July 1778, the third surviving son of William Tetley (1749-1834) and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Rimington (1751/2-1788). William, a second-generation maltster, was caught in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 1797 and declared bankrupt in February 1800. But he and four of his sons, trading in London as well as in Leeds, and operating as wine and spirit merchants and producers of fortified English fruit wines besides continuing their malting business in Armley, made a good recovery in the 1800s. 
On 12 March 1808 Joshua Tetley married Hannah (1784-1857), the daughter of Francis Carbutt, a Leeds linen and cloth merchant. The Carbutts were rather better connected than the Tetleys; her brother Francis, also a cloth merchant, was mayor of Leeds in 1847. In 1814 Joshua with his wife and five young children, all girls, moved into a house in Park Square, then the most fashionable address in Leeds. Eight years later, at the age of forty-three, he rented and went to live at the Salem Place brewery on the south bank of the River Aire opposite the Leeds coal staithe. 
There were, in 1822, some half-dozen common breweries in Leeds. All were small, their existence often short-lived. Together their output accounted for no more than 12 per cent of beer produced in the rapidly growing town. Brewing by publicans on their own premises was dominant. Certainly the Salem Place brewery, founded in 1792, was a small affair. Joshua paid only $409 for its fixtures, fittings, and the goodwill of the business; its rateable value was a mere $22. But Joshua evidently prospered, selling malt and flour as well as beer. The 'Beer Act' of 1830 seems to have transformed his prospects. Few of the hundreds of beerhouse keepers in Leeds and its surrounding district who took out the two guineas a year licence had either the know-how or the equipment to brew on their own premises, and therefore common brewers like Joshua Tetley were able to take advantage of the changing beer market. 
By 1839, when Joshua Tetley took his only son Francis William Tetley ['see below'] into partnership with him, the brewery was returning profits close to $3000 a year. Joshua moved from the brewery house beside the river to a more salubrious residence, Belmont House at Little Woodhouse, Leeds. Two years later he reckoned his wealth to be $33,842. From the late 1840s he began to take a lesser role in the management of the brewery (it employed thirty-two men in 1848), retiring from the partnership in 1858. Two years earlier he had moved to a large house in the country at Hampsthwaite near Harrogate, Yorkshire, where he died on 26 August 1859. He was buried in Hampsthwaite churchyard. At his death his will was sworn under $50,000, although in the previous year his interest in the brewery, valued at $42,393 in his last full account of 1853, had passed to Francis William Tetley. 
Joshua Tetley had clearly created a flourishing business by the 1840s. Its fortunes were further transformed in the following decade by 
The firm went from strength to strength, enjoying fully the boom in beer consumption which ran for two decades from the mid-1850s. Leeds itself expanded rapidly, providing a burgeoning free-trade market for beer on Tetley's doorstep. They rose to the occasion. Both the comments of their commercial rivals and the -- admittedly somewhat partial -- reports of early brewing consultants testify to the excellence of their entire range of beers, including good pale ales, the premium beer of mid-Victorian Britain. In 1875 Tetleys brewed an impressive 171,500 barrels, making it much the largest brewery in the north of England. 
Unlike his parents, who produced a single male heir and seven daughters, Francis William Tetley had not the same worries about male continuity. Fourteen children, seven sons and seven daughters, blessed the marriage over the following twenty-five years. Yet from the early 1860s Tetley suffered poor health. With the onset of severe illness in 1875 he severed his active connection with the brewery. His winters were spent in Egypt or Cannes. Eventually he retired to Bournemouth, although he retained the house, Foxhill, Weetwood, near Leeds, which George Corson had built for him in 1862. He died in Bournemouth on 22 January 1883, leaving an estate approaching $300,000. Considering that he did not have extensive landholdings, and that the firm did not own a single public house, it was an impressive fortune. 
The eldest of Francis William's six surviving sons, 
Charles Francis Tetley was made a partner in the brewery in 1877, and became chairman of the incorporated company in 1902. He was the first member of the business to play a significant part in Leeds politics, being elected to Leeds city council as a Conservative in 1895 and serving as lord mayor two years afterwards. In 1926 he was made a freeman of the city. He was prominent, as were later members of the Tetley family, in many aspects of the city's life, especially its fledgeling university. For fifty years a member of its governing body, he made benefactions to the University of Leeds, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1922. He was also for fifty years a churchwarden of St Michael's, Headingley. He died at Foxhill on 25 January 1934 and was buried at Lawnswood cemetery. His son Charles Harold Tetley (1877-1959), also educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, was chairman of the company from 1934 to 1953, pro-chancellor of the University of Leeds for twenty years from 1926, and donor of more than $100,000 to the university. 
Combining public service and charitable effort, often with distinguished military records (three of the company's chairmen, including Charles Harold Tetley, were awarded the DSO), Tetley family directors maintained the firm's position as arguably the north country's leading brewery. Owning no public houses until the summer of 1890, but with the benefit of debenture share issues after Tetley became a limited private company seven years later, a large tied-house estate was built up by 1914. Profits of the well-managed firm remained buoyant. Employment -- there were more than 600 employees at the outbreak of the First World War -- was guaranteed to loyal members of the workforce for generations. Tetley had become as synonymous with Leeds as Bass with Burton.

Lyle, Abram (1820-1891), shipowner and sugar refiner, was born in Greenock, Renfrewshire, on 14 December 1820, the sixth of the seven children of Abram Lyle (1783-1849), cooper and shipowner, and his wife, Mary Campbell. The young Abram was educated at the locally prestigious Murray's School; at the age of twelve he was apprenticed to a lawyer, James W. Turner (at a salary of $3 per annum), but two years later joined his father as an apprentice cooper. In the period before his father's death in 1849 the business had declined and the elder Lyle had taken to drink. This might have been the reason for Abram's life-long commitment to temperance. He also took it on himself to clear his father's debts out of a sense of honour. The young Lyle had to make his own way and did so through an informal business arrangement with John Kerr while continuing as a cooper. The two men, whose business was based entirely on friendship, built up a fleet of ships which grew from 161 tons in 1849 to 22,000 tons in 1870; formally all belonged to Kerr. On 14 December 1846 Lyle was able to marry Mary Park ('c'.1824-1881), the daughter of a local building contractor; the couple had two daughters and seven sons. As demand for sugar grew so did the market for casks to carry sugar and molasses from the Caribbean, as a return cargo for coal and textiles, in Kerr's ships. Greenock became one of the major sugar-refining centres in Britain in the 1860s. 
In 1865 Lyle and Kerr (together with Charles Hunter and James and Walter Grieve) purchased a refinery which they named the Glebe Sugar Refining Co. Lyle transformed it into the largest in Greenock. On Kerr's death in 1872 Lyle inherited a share in four ships, buying them outright a year later, whereupon he set up his own line: the Cape Line. By 1880 he had ten (sailing) ships, and bought a steamer, the 'Cape Clear', in the following year. He had made an earlier move to independence in 1879 when, with the intention of building a larger refinery, he sold his interest in the Glebe company to the other partners. Denied permission for a private berth in Greenock harbour, he sought out an alternative site on the River Thames at Plaistow to the east of London. Building began in 1881 and the following year Abram Lyle & Sons was established. The refinery was managed by four of his sons, Charles, Abram, William, and John, and 400 families moved from Greenock to provide a skilled workforce. Lyle himself did not move to London. His wife, Mary, died suddenly on 24 June 1881, and Lyle married again on 29 November 1882; his second wife was Elizabeth Gordon Cumming. 
It was at this time that Lyle's business underwent a change. In 1883, following a large European beet harvest, the price of raw sugar collapsed while all the company's assets were in cargoes at sea, including Lyle's Javanese sugar which lost $100,000 when it was sold. The new refinery, which had begun operating in January 1883, was kept going only by persuading the Bank of Scotland to extend its credit, and by selling the cooperage business in Greenock and the Cape Line's only steamer. The major boon to the company, however, was golden syrup, the product that provided most profit and one with which the company name was forever to be associated. Lyle's was not the only company to produce syrup but, using a secret formula, theirs was of higher quality and could command a premium price. It had probably been made, along with other sugar products, in Greenock, but from 1885 the Plaistow refinery began to sell it in tins bearing the now famous trade mark of a lion surrounded by bees. Lyle's shipping line (which was run by two other sons, Alexander and Robert) was, however, deprived of capital for the sake of the refinery. By 1890, with the fleet reduced to only four ships, the two businesses were divided into private limited companies. 
During the 1870s Abram Lyle gradually withdrew from business and left management of the companies to his sons. He now took an active interest in Greenock public affairs. A town councillor from 1858, he became a magistrate in 1860 (retiring in 1885), and was elected provost from 1876 to 1879. It was during these years that the Lyle Road was built in the town as a work creation scheme. In 1880 he paid for the construction of a fountain in the town's Cathcart Square. Lyle was also a director of the Glasgow and South West Railway Co., of the Greenock Infirmary, and of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Co.; he was chairman of the local marine board and had an interest in several local charities. Lyle was a bearer and elder of St Michael's Presbyterian Church, Greenock, and his strong religious beliefs prompted him to lead an ascetic life; though he played the flute and was a good singer and an effective platform speaker, business dominated to the extent that he resisted sport and other amusements. Lyle's faith may also explain his choice of the lion and bees as the trademark for the company's golden syrup. The image is taken from 'Judges' 14, in which Samson, having killed a lion, returns to find bees producing honey in its carcase; Samson later used the image as a riddle: 'Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness' ('Judges' 14: 13), of which the second part was reproduced on Lyle's syrup tins. 
By the 1860s Lyle was sufficiently wealthy to build a large house, Oakley, in Gourock, overlooking the Clyde, and to have a summer house at Innellan, Argyll. He left only a small estate ($42,540) at his death but made generous gifts to his sons ($230,000) during his lifetime. Lyle died at Oakley from pneumonia on 30 April 1891 and was buried in Greenock. Although the funeral was a family occasion, several thousand Greenock residents lined the streets in tribute. Lyle was survived by his second wife. Control of Abram Lyle & Sons passed to his sons Abram, Charles, William, Robert, and John, and then to his grandsons, among whom the most prominent was Leonard Lyle (1882-1954); it was under Leonard's directorship that the company amalgamated with another refiner, Henry Tate & Sons, to form Tate and Lyle in 1921.

Fitzpatrick, Anne, countess of Upper Ossory (1737/8-1804), correspondent of Horace Walpole, was the only child of Sir Henry Liddell, fourth baronet, later Baron Ravensworth (bap. 1708, d. 1784), and his wife, Anne (1712-1794), daughter of Sir Peter Delme, sometime lord mayor of London. Her father was a substantial coal owner in the north-east of England and Anne Liddell's childhood was probably divided between the family homes at Eslington, Northumberland, and Ravensworth Castle, near Lamesley, co. Durham, and London. On 29 January 1756, at her father's house in St James's Square, London, she married Augustus Henry FitzRoy, earl of Euston (1735-1811), who succeeded his grandfather as third duke of Grafton in 1757. Four children followed: Georgiana (1757-1799); George Henry (1760-1844), styled earl of Euston during his father's lifetime ['see 'FitzRoy, George Henry, fourth duke of Grafton]; a son ('b'. and died 1761); and Charles (1764-1829) ['see 'FitzRoy, Lord Charles]. 
The duchess of Grafton later claimed that she had married for love, though the social advantages the union brought her family, and the injection of cash she brought to the Grafton finances, were also important. The marriage may have been in difficulty by April 1761, when Horace Walpole told Horace Mann that 'The Graftons go abroad for the Duchess's health. Another climate may mend that -- I will not answer for more' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 9.363). The correspondence between the duchess and Walpole began in late summer 1761, when the duchess sent Walpole a 'decoupure' (a figure cut out in card) of herself and her daughter by Jean Huber of Geneva. Walpole's response began a series of 455 letters, which his twentieth-century editor W. S. Lewis considered showed him 'at his best as a writer and as a person' (ibid., 32.xxix). The Graftons remained abroad, in Geneva and in Italy, until August 1762. 
The duchess was considered attractive, but this could not by itself provide a basis for a stable marriage. The duke apparently disliked her love of large social gatherings and often expensive card games, though he himself lost money on the turf. Walpole thought Grafton felt compromised politically by the duchess's friendship with the siblings Gertrude, duchess of Bedford, and the second Earl Gower; they were leading figures in the Bedford whig faction and Grafton was keen to emphasize his independence to win the favour of George III. 
In 1764, while the duchess was pregnant with their youngest child, Grafton began to be seen openly with the courtesan Nancy Parsons. Following the birth of Lord Charles FitzRoy, and an argument in which the duchess told her husband she hated him, the duchess was expelled from the ducal residences. The Graftons were legally separated on 11 January 1765, the duchess keeping her jewels and her allowance of $3000 p.a. By 1 February the duchess had established a separate household in Upper Grosvenor Street, London. During the spring she began a love affair with William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, third duke of Portland, whom she had known since at least 1763. It seems likely that the duchess hoped to marry Portland, and their relationship was known in society, but in June 1765 Portland announced his engagement to Lady Dorothy Cavendish without first informing the duchess, leading to her public humiliation. The duchess's desolation was accentuated by the loss of both her sons, as first Lord Charles and then Lord Euston were taken into Grafton's care during 1765. Walpole was one of the friends to whom she turned; while in Paris that autumn he met John Fitzpatrick, second earl of Upper Ossory (1745-1818), and recommended him to the duchess. 
The duchess and Lord Ossory were lovers by November 1767, when Walpole discussed with the duchess the possibility of her renting Marble Hill House following the death of his friend Henrietta, countess of Suffolk. In May 1768 Grafton (by then prime minister) forced the duchess to reject an invitation to officiate as chief mourner at the funeral of George III's sister Princess Louisa, eventually admitting to his colleagues that his estranged wife was pregnant by Lord Ossory. In June she moved to a house in Coombe, Surrey; in the following month Grafton took from the duchess their daughter Georgiana, the last of their children to live with her. The duchess's daughter Anne (died 1841) was born on 23 August. Grafton then prosecuted the duchess for adultery. The duchess agreed not to counter with her own charge of adultery against the duke and to accept an allowance of $2000 per annum. The duke and duchess were divorced by act of parliament on 23 March 1769; the duchess married Lord Ossory at Kingston church, Surrey, on 26 March. 
Ossory's brother Richard Fitzpatrick gave the bride away, an act that revealed not just the urgent need to regularize the former duchess's social position but her parents' disapproval of her conduct. She reportedly regained the use of her marriage portion of $40,000. Several of her friends thought a public life would be possible (despite the further complication when Grafton took Ossory's cousin Elizabeth Wrottesley as his second wife), but the new Lady Ossory preferred to avoid the risk of being snubbed in society and retired to Lord Ossory's homes at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, or Farming Woods, Northamptonshire. She came to London for the winter in order to provide her husband with a hostess when he needed to entertain his political allies, and with him paid regular visits to the country residences of relations and friends. The marriage was apparently successful, Walpole commenting in 1775 that it 'made two persons happier than Venus's son generally does' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 32.262). Her daughter Anne was initially placed with foster parents, but after the death of her daughter Mary (1770-1771) and the miscarriage of twin sons in November 1771, was retrieved and brought up as a legitimate daughter, addressed as Lady Anne Fitzpatrick. The Ossorys later had a third daughter, Lady Gertrude Fitzpatrick (1774-1841). Lady Ossory befriended her sister-in-law Mary, Lady Holland, but on Lady Holland's death in 1778 did not gain custody of any of her daughters, a fact celebrated by their great-aunt Lady Sarah Lennox, who referred to Lady Ossory's uneven temper and unkindness to one of the girls, Caroline Fox. 
Lady Ossory and Walpole became regular correspondents in October 1769, probably after she heard that Walpole had been complimenting her in conversation. Only one of Lady Ossory's letters to Walpole survives, and details of her life are scant: 'today you are agent for Mr Ongley, and carrying a county election' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 32.209) could be facetious, but might suggest that she had a role in the election of her husband and Robert Henley Ongley as MPs for Bedfordshire in October 1774. About this time Ossory was nominated as British ambassador to Spain, an appointment that Walpole thought Lady Ossory welcomed as it would have allowed her a public life remote from the British elite in London, but the duke of Grafton persuaded the prime minister, Lord North, to withdraw the invitation. When Ossory, who had previously voted with North's government, defected to the opposition and spoke in favour of Edmund Burke's bill for peace with the American colonies on 16 November 1775 Lady Ossory was accused of having persuaded him to change sides. The letters suggest that Lady Ossory pursued moderate arguments on the American question, occasionally reproving Walpole for a lack of patriotism, while opposing both the ministerial policies and American independence and at the same time supporting the colonists' right to take up arms, a middle course that Walpole ridiculed (ibid., 33.305). In July 1782 she sent Charles James Fox a paragraph of Walpole's declaring 'Mr Fox the fittest man in England for prime minister' (ibid., 33.341). Despite rumours in the press the death of her father did not bring her the Liddell estates, but it did allow reconciliation with her mother. Lady Ossory's friendship with Walpole was complemented by the marriage of her son Lord Euston to Walpole's great-niece Lady Maria Waldegrave in November 1784, and it may have brought her some sense of justification that Grafton opposed the marriage, though she was pleased (for the sake of Euston's financial security) when Grafton relented after two months. 
Lady Ossory's sense of humour was governed by the propriety that shaped her social relations: when in 1785 Walpole sent her a copy of Miss Hoare of Bath's naked parody of the fashionable female figure, 'A Modern Venus', Lady Ossory responded by returning her own drawing of the same distorted female form, but this time clothed. As Walpole aged the nature of their correspondence changed, as he was increasingly immobilized by gout and Lady Ossory's travels, such as her tour of Wales in 1790, assumed greater interest for him. The last letter Lady Ossory received from Walpole was sent on 15 January 1797, six weeks before his death. 
Lady Ossory died on 24 February 1804 at her London home in Grosvenor Square, and was buried on 4 March at St James's Church, Grafton Underwood, Northamptonshire (a village that had been part of the Fitzpatrick estate until 1748). Her husband died on 1 February 1818; their daughters Anne and Gertrude inherited the Fitzpatrick estates in Ireland, but neither married. 
Lady Ossory recognized that her abilities were overshadowed by others in her circle: 'Mr Walpole shall now entertain you, better than I could were I ever so lively' she once wrote to Lady Holland (before 1 July 1774, BL, Add. MS 51454, fol. 54). Her own attempts at wit in surviving correspondence are often self-conscious; it is telling that Walpole does not seem to have retained her letters to him. None the less, she displayed great tenacity and skill in successfully making three major transitions in her life: a provincial heiress (albeit with maternal metropolitan mercantile ancestry) from a family new to the peerage whose fortune was reliant on one commodity, became a duchess able to hold her own in fashionable society; she weathered the storm of her separation from Grafton, the loss of her children, and her affair with Portland to live independently in a critical beau monde; and after her divorce and remarriage she established herself in a respectable rural retirement, for all practical purposes reconciled to her exile from social life. Her contribution to posterity, however, was in her role as Walpole's muse for thoughts on social and domestic life, allowing him to express more sensitivity and reflection in his correspondence than he did in many other series of letters dominated by acerbic comments on political events.

Elizabeth, Princess (1596-1662), queen of Bohemia and electress palatine, consort of Frederick V, eldest and only surviving daughter of James VI of Scotland (James I of England) (1566-1625) and his wife, Anne of Denmark (1574-1619), was born at Falkland Palace, Cupar, on 19 August 1596 (Akkerman, 322-3) -- and was baptized on 28 November the same year. 
As a child the Princess Elizabeth was entrusted by her father to the care of Alexander, Lord Livingstone, later earl of Linlithgow, and his wife, Helen Hay, daughter of Andrew Hay, earl of Erroll. Elizabeth grew up in Linlithgow Castle, midway between Stirling and Edinburgh, within a day's ride of each. In June 1603 Elizabeth accompanied her mother to England. Here Lady Frances Howard, who had married Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham, as her second husband, was appointed her governess. However, when Cobham's involvement in the Main and Bye plots was discovered, Lady Cobham was relieved of her charge in September 1603 and Elizabeth was removed on 19 October to the household of John, Lord Harington of Exton, and his wife, Anne. Harington was well known for his strict adherence to the Reformed faith, for his abhorrence of Catholicism, and for his belief in the virtues of learning, ideals which were to have a considerable influence on the princess. Elizabeth now lived mostly at Combe Abbey, 21/2 miles north of Coventry, one of the family seats of her governor, visiting the court only on rare occasions until 1608. She received instruction in writing, French, and Italian (languages she was to master with considerable success) as well as horse riding, music, and dancing. John Bull, organist of the Chapel Royal, was one of her music instructors. At the time of the Gunpowder Plot, Harington left Combe Abbey with his charge and sought protection in Coventry as he had reason to fear that the conspirators would try to seize the princess, but otherwise Elizabeth's childhood in England was uneventful. 
From the end of 1608 Elizabeth took up residence at court, where she took part in the great court festivals and danced in the masque 'Tethys' in 1610. She had lodgings at Hampton Court as well as at Whitehall and in Harington's residence at Kew. During these years her elder brother Henry, born in 1594, became her closest confidant. When they were unable to see each other, brother and sister exchanged frequent letters. The education she had received in Lord Harington's house had prepared Elizabeth for the idealistic militant protestantism which Henry cultivated. In fact one of Henry's closest companions was John Harington, son and heir of Elizabeth's preceptor. The princess clearly idolized Henry. She remained all her life true to the memory of her high-minded brother, who died prematurely in November 1612, and was later seen by contemporaries as the real inheritor of his political and religious ideals, much more so than her younger brother Charles. 
The choice of a suitable husband for the attractive princess -- visitors to the court commented on the striking beauty of the golden-haired girl -- was predictably a matter of great political concern. Her elder brother openly opposed a marriage with a Catholic prince, which James I and even more so his consort Queen Anne were reluctant to reject out of hand. There was certainly no lack of suitors. Among the princes asking for Elizabeth's hand were Frederick Ulrich of Brunswick, Prince Otto of Hesse, the duke of Savoy's son, and the king of Sweden's son Gustavus Adolphus, the hero of the early 1630s, all except the prince of Savoy protestants. In the end, however, Frederick V, count palatine of the Rhine and elector of the Holy Roman empire (1596-1632), was chosen as her husband. Born on 26 August 1596 NS, he was the son of Friedrich IV (1574-1610) and Louise Juliana (1576-1644), daughter of William I of Orange (died 1584), and had been educated in the Huguenot enclave at Sedan, under the protection of the duc de Bouillon. Having sent first Johann Albrecht, Count Solms, the lord high steward of the Palatinate, and then the steward of his household, Hans Meinhard von Schonberg (or Schomberg), to England to prepare the ground (the marriage contract itself was signed on 16 May), Frederick arrived in England himself on 16 October 1612. Although Elizabeth's mother was opposed to the marriage and warned her daughter that she was marrying beneath her station, the young princess, probably under the influence of her brother Henry, eagerly welcomed the match. On 18 December Frederick was invested with the Order of the Garter and on 27 December betrothed to Elizabeth in the banqueting house in Whitehall. The solemn wedding ceremony took place on 14 February 1613 in the chapel of Whitehall Palace, accompanied by extensive celebrations staged both at court and in the City. 
The marriage was part of a wider alliance concluded in the spring of 1612 between England and the protestant union, an association of German princes and free cities under the leadership of the Palatinate. For James I this protestant alliance was to be complemented by a closer understanding with Catholic dynasties, possibly cemented by the marriage of his sons with French or Spanish princesses. Thus the palatine marriage was to be not much more than a well-calculated move in a more comprehensive dynastic policy which would allow James to play his cherished role as Europe's peacemaker. For James's son Henry, however, who died before the wedding ceremony took place, and those at court who thought like him, the marriage between his sister and the elector meant much more. The 'Masque of Truth', which was to be performed at the wedding and which had probably been commissioned by Henry, celebrated the marriage as an event of truly eschatological significance, ushering in the final battle between light and darkness in which the empire of evil, that is popery, would finally be vanquished. After Henry's death it became impossible to stage this masque, but even so numerous plays and poems written or performed in 1613 or the following year, such as 'The Hector of Germanie, or, The Palsgrave, Prince Elector' by Wentworth Smith (1614), conveyed the same political message. Such sentiments were to be revived in 1619, when Frederick V accepted the crown of Bohemia, to the dismay of Elizabeth's father. In 1613 even James I had a medal struck to celebrate the wedding on which his daughter figured as 'Elizabeth altera', an allusion to James's predecessor and to the political traditions of Elizabethan England. In later years Elizabeth did not hesitate to mobilize support for the palatine cause by appealing to the almost saintlike veneration in which she was held as the heiress of the 'Name and Vertues, the Majesty and generositie of our Immortal Queene Elizabeth' (Cogswell, 96). 
Elizabeth and her husband did not leave England until 26 April to travel slowly via Flushing, The Hague, and up the River Rhine to Heidelberg, where the new electress was solemnly welcomed on 17 June 1613. Frederick V, the prince whom Elizabeth had married, was the ruler of one of the four secular prince electorates of the Holy Roman empire, and as such a key figure in German politics before the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War. As a Calvinist he was in the forefront of the battle against the Counter-Reformation and against the house of Habsburg in Germany. Frederick V's marriage with James I's daughter seemed to be the crowning achievement of a policy which tried to give the Palatinate a central place in international politics. Moreover, the marriage with a princess of royal blood was bound to enhance the status that Frederick V enjoyed among the German princes and strengthened his own and his counsellors' political ambitions, which in retrospect were dangerously unrealistic. Indeed Elizabeth herself was later blamed for having encouraged her husband to pursue an aggressive anti-Habsburg policy and to accept the crown of Bohemia in 1619, because she thought it demeaning to be the wife of a mere German prince. There is no real proof for this supposition, but the fact that Frederick V was married to a princess who could claim precedence over him on ceremonial occasions -- and did, on her father's insistence, do so -- must have furthered his wish to obtain a kinglike status or indeed a royal crown for himself, which would put him on an equal footing with Europe's great monarchs or at least with his own wife. 
Elizabeth's presence in Heidelberg brought an air of extravagance and refinement to the Palatinate. The princess, who had been accompanied to Heidelberg by her own numerous English household establishment, insisted on living in style. Her lack of restraint in financial matters, and her sometimes rather drastic sense of humour as well as her refusal to become 'all Dutch' (i.e. German) and indeed to learn German, however, did not make her universally popular in Heidelberg, in spite of her indisputable charm and beauty (Lemberg, 16). It took the sustained efforts of Hans Meinhard von Schonberg, who now held the office of marshall in the palatine court but acted also as James I's representative in Heidelberg, to alleviate the tensions between her servants and the elector's entourage and to reorganize Elizabeth's household, where waste and disorder reigned. But the influence which the matrimonial alliance with England had on the Heidelberg court went beyond a mere increase of expenditure and occasional conflicts of precedence. Even in earlier years the Palatinate had been more strongly influenced by the intellectual traditions of western European than other German principalities. After 1613 Heidelberg was clearly distinguished from other princely courts by an altogether grander and almost royal style at once indebted to the ideals of chivalry, humanism, and militant protestantism. This style was inspired by the dynastic alliance with the Stuarts, which also brought new artists to Heidelberg. The famous architect, engineer, and scientist Salomon de Caus, for example, who had worked for Elizabeth's brother Henry before 1613, followed her to Heidelberg and created the Hortus Palatinus, the most famous Renaissance garden in Germany. 
The marriage between Elizabeth and Frederick was a happy and affectionate one, although the elector was subject to periodic bouts of depression. On 14 January 1614 NS the couple's first child, Frederick Henry (1614-1629), was born; the birth of their second son, Charles Lewis, followed on 1 January 1618 and that of their eldest daughter, Elizabeth, one year later (5 January 1619). By this time the political crisis in Germany had already worsened to such an extent that war was imminent. Frederick, influenced by his advisers, decided to accept the crown which the Bohemian estates, having shortly before deposed Archduke Ferdinand of Austria -- soon to be elected emperor -- offered him in August 1619. Elizabeth herself did not yet play a very active part in politics. She did, however, clearly identify herself with her husband's policy, and certainly did nothing to dissuade him from accepting the Bohemian crown. Personal affection and loyalty, religious enthusiasm, but probably also the encouragement she received from the archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbott, account for her attitude. Abbott gave Elizabeth to understand that her father would be bound to support her and her husband, regardless of his reluctance to endorse the Bohemian adventure. In October Frederick and Elizabeth left the Palatinate and travelled to Prague, where they arrived on 31 October. A few days later, on 4 November, the elector was crowned king of Bohemia in St Vitus's Cathedral. This ceremony was followed by Elizabeth's own coronation three days later. However, the royal couple were not universally popular in their new capital. Elizabeth herself spoke little German, whereas the ladies of the Bohemian court hardly knew any French -- a language Elizabeth spoke fluently -- let alone English. Elizabeth's manners, her low-cut dresses -- shameless by Bohemian standards -- the irregular hours she kept, and not least the dogs and pet monkeys which surrounded her, offended the feelings of the native nobility and citizens. The strict Calvinism which Frederick and his entourage subscribed to, however, was even more offensive, and made the new king and his consort unpopular even with many non-Catholics, who preferred a more moderate form of protestantism. 
On 18 December 1619 Elizabeth gave birth in Prague to her fourth child, who was christened Rupert (Ruprecht), evoking the memory of Rupert III, elector palatine, who had been elected king of the Romans and emperor designate on the deposition of King Wenceslaus (who had ruled Bohemia as well as Germany) in the year 1400. The situation in Bohemia as well as in the Palatinate itself, however, soon became critical. In autumn 1620 Spanish troops overran large parts of the Lower Palatinate. Elizabeth, who knew that she could not really count on her father's support, entreated her brother Charles to intercede with James I for her 'that loves you more than all the world' and her husband (Elizabeth to Charles, 15 Sept 1620, 'Letters', 54). In October the Catholic armies advanced on Prague, and on 8 November Frederick's troops suffered a devastating defeat at the battle of the White Mountain. As Frederick's enemies had predicted, his rule in Bohemia had not lasted much longer than one winter. The Catholic pamphlets which were now published, and which satirized Frederick's short reign, often attributed the responsibility for his reckless policy to his allegedly arrogant and frivolous consort, although such criticism did nothing to diminish her popularity among the more militant protestants in Europe. The royal couple fled via Breslau, Kustrin (where her fifth child, Maurice, was born on 16 January 1621), Berlin, and Wolfenbuttel to the Netherlands. 
In The Hague Frederick and Elizabeth were received by the stadholder Maurice of Orange on 14 April 1621. The states general granted Frederick and his family financial support which was, at least initially, generous. They resided in the house Wassenaar-Duivenvoorde in The Hague, which belonged to Johan van Oldenbarnevelt's exiled son-in-law Cornelius van der Myle. In 1625 Oldenbarnevelt's own house -- the owner had been executed for political reasons in 1619 -- also became part of their lodgings. In the Netherlands, where Elizabeth was to spend the next decades in exile, she and her husband continued to live, at least during the 1620s, before retrenchments became inevitable, with all the trappings of royalty and little regard to the costs this entailed. Hunting, dances, and spectacles dominated life at the palatine court in exile. Elizabeth had herself and her family painted by some of the leading Dutch portrait painters of the period, in particular Gerrit van Honthorst and Michiel Jansz von Miereveldt, and sent many of the portraits to her supporters in the Netherlands and abroad. She and two of her children, Rupert and Louise Hollandine, later even took painting lessons themselves. 
Politically, however, matters went from bad to worse. In 1622-3 Spain and Bavaria occupied the Upper and Lower Palatinate, where the last garrisons loyal to the elector surrendered. Frederick V had already been outlawed by the emperor in January 1621; he now lost not only his hereditary dominions but also his electoral dignity, which was transferred to Maximilian of Bavaria in February 1623. In this desperate situation Elizabeth's political role began to change. In Heidelberg and Prague she had played only a modest part in politics in spite of her elevated status as a king's daughter. In exile, however, she became much more an equal, if not in fact the stronger, partner in the marriage with Frederick V. Frederick was devoted more than ever to his wife. He relied on English diplomatic and financial support in the 1620s, the latter, apart from the Dutch subsidies which he received, his principal source of income in exile, and continued to hope for England's direct intervention in the war. Elizabeth herself had a considerable talent to inspire admiration, loyalty, and love in Germany as well as England, more so than her husband, who tended to abandon himself to despair. Her beauty and undisputed charm, her strength of character, and the high-spirited courage with which she continued to fight undismayed for the palatine cause against heavy odds, but also the fact that her upbringing and education seemed to make her the perfect protestant heroine, gave her a unique position as the symbol of militant protestantism in Europe. Seemingly sober diplomats or scholars like Sir Henry Wotton wrote sonnets in her praise or, like Sir Thomas Roe, swore to 'serve her to deathe, to poverty', adding 'if you shall ever please to command, I will be converted to dust and ashes at your Majesties feet' (Strachan, 119; Oman, 212-13). Noblemen and soldiers committed to the ideals of chivalry like Christian of Brunswick in Germany or the third earl of Essex in England took pride in fighting for her cause. A cult of the 'Queen of Hearts' (Oman, 255), in which erotic, romantic, and religious elements were combined, developed in the 1620s, and Elizabeth knew how to encourage this enthusiasm. 
One of Elizabeth's most ardent admirers was Christian of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel (1599-1626), the protestant administrator of the prince-bishopric of Halberstadt in northern Germany. Christian was a military adventurer who acquired a reputation for ruthlessness; he was not averse to acts of robbery and kidnapping to improve his financial situation. In 1621, however, he raised an army to fight for his cousin Elizabeth and Frederick V. Christian's device in his campaign was 'pour dieu et pour elle', and in serving Elizabeth he clearly modelled himself on the knightly heroes celebrated by the chivalrous novels of the time. However, in June 1622 Christian was beaten at Hochst by Tilly and, having raised a new army, again in August 1623 at Stadtlohn near the Dutch border. Nevertheless, he was made a knight of the Garter in 1624 on Elizabeth's request. He remained devoted to Elizabeth until his early death in 1626. Although Elizabeth's own feelings for the 'mad bishop of Halberstadt', as contemporaries called him, are difficult to ascertain, Christian's sister Sophie assured him in December 1625 that 'la belle' whom he so adored still had a great deal of affection for him (Opel, 317). With Christian's defeat in 1623, however, the palatine cause seemed to be desperate, and all the more so as James I was now more strongly committed than ever to a compromise with Spain. Elizabeth watched with dismay the negotiations over a Spanish marriage and the prince of Wales's journey to Madrid in 1623. She had come to distrust her father, and wrote in despair to Lord Conway in September 1623, 'yet I hope his majesty will one day see the falsehood of our enemies'; but she continued to hope for her brother's help, in particular after his return from Spain, when Charles turned to a strongly anti-Spanish policy ('Letters', ed. Baker, 67-8). 
The fact that both Charles and the king's favourite the duke of Buckingham now tried to win king and parliament for a war against Spain seemed to augur well for the palatine cause. After November 1623 Elizabeth began to wear an ornament whose centrepiece was a lock of Charles's hair as a token of the trust she put in her brother. She and her husband remained in close contact with the war party in England during the last months of 1623 and throughout 1624. However, after Charles I became king in March 1625, the war strategy soon proved to be abortive. One of Frederick's and Elizabeth's most influential and most trusted advisers, Johann Joachim von Rusdorf, who acted as their representative in England, clearly blamed the old and new favourite the duke of Buckingham for this disaster. Rusdorf was in close contact with Buckingham's opponents at court, in particular Archbishop Abbott, in 1625-6, and although it is not quite clear to what extent Frederick and Elizabeth shared Rusdorf's sentiments -- they certainly could not afford to criticize the duke openly -- Buckingham himself began to see the palatine court in exile as a hotbed of opposition to his policy, closely linked with his enemies at court and in the country. On the other hand, the king and queen of Bohemia were bound to react with indignation to Buckingham's plans to marry his daughter to one of their sons, possibly their heir, which he wished to promote during a visit to The Hague in November 1625. Buckingham apparently wished to silence those of his critics who still saw him as a traitor to the protestant cause by this marriage, but such an alliance would also have made his grandchild the possible heir to the English crown. The king and queen of Bohemia managed to stifle any discussion of the dubious marriage project without openly offending the duke, but relations with the favourite remained tense. Rusdorf had to be recalled from London in January 1627 because the duke rightly suspected him of damaging his reputation abroad, in The Hague as much as in Germany and Scandinavia, by his reports. When Buckingham was assassinated in August 1628, Rusdorf on his part welcomed his death as an 'act of God' (Rusdorf, 'Memoires', 2.606). Elizabeth was more cautious, but clearly did not regret the end of the 'great man's' influence ('Letters', 77; Oman, 297). However, the dissolution of parliament in 1629 -- at about the same time as the power of the emperor and his Catholic allies in Germany had reached its apogee -- and Charles's determination to abandon the war effort altogether, put paid to all hopes to regain the palatine dominions and the electoral dignity with English support. Frederick V and Elizabeth resented the treaty of Madrid, which ended the war between England and Spain in November 1630 without providing for the Palatinate. Elizabeth remained all the more popular in England, and those who were dissatisfied with Charles's policies for religious or political reasons were clearly disappointed when Queen Henrietta Maria bore Charles a son in 1630, thereby ending Elizabeth's role as Charles's heir apparent. At court Dudley Carleton, Viscount Dorchester, appointed secretary of state in December 1628, remained a close friend of the palatines -- he had won Elizabeth's trust during his time as English ambassador at The Hague in the early 1620s. With the victories achieved by Sweden in 1631, there seemed to be once more a realistic chance for English intervention on the continent in the palatine dynasty's favour. Elizabeth implored her brother in a letter to enter into an alliance with Sweden ('Letters', 81-2). Charles, though irritated by the tone of Elizabeth's letter, was not entirely unmoved by his sister's pleading, but with Dorchester's death in February 1632 the peace party nevertheless gained the upper hand at the English court. 
The year 1632 was in many ways the most disastrous for Elizabeth since her flight from Prague. In early November Gustavus Adolphus, who was widely seen as the saviour of the German protestants, was killed in action in the battle of Lutzen. Frederick V had accompanied the Swedish king on his campaign in 1632 but had later in the year left the Swedish army and visited the Palatinate, which had been liberated by the Swedes. However, while he was staying in Mainz he fell ill and died on 29 November, thirteen days after the 'lion of the north'. Elizabeth, who was deeply devoted to her husband, was shattered. Nevertheless, she declined her brother's offer to settle in England. She recognized that such a move would be tantamount to abandoning all claims to the Palatinate for herself and her children. She therefore decided to stay in the Netherlands, where she and Frederick had built a country house at Rhenen in Gelderland in 1629-30, which she now increasingly preferred to her residence at The Hague. Her younger children were educated away from her own court in Leiden. The number of her children had quickly increased during the years in exile. Louise Hollandine (died 1709) was born in 1622, Louis, who died in infancy, in 1624, his brother Edward (died 1684) one year later, and his sister Henrietta Maria (died 1652) two years later. Four more children were to follow: Philip (1627-1650), Charlotte (1628-1631), Sophia (1630-1714), and Gustavus (1632-1641). Elizabeth's eldest son, Frederick Henry, however, deeply mourned by his parents, fell victim to an accident on 17 January 1629. Accompanying his father on a boat trip from Haarlem to Amsterdam, he drowned when the boat capsized. In spite of the strokes of fate which Elizabeth suffered, her spirit remained unbroken. She continued to indulge her passion for horse riding and hunting, and occasionally her children and visitors even performed a play or masque at her residence, a fact which irritated the strict Dutch Calvinists and was likely to provoke the indignation of the fervent protestants in England who still considered Elizabeth their heroine. 
During the 1630s Elizabeth's relations with the English court were marked by considerable political tensions. After Dorchester's death her closest confidant in her native country was Sir Thomas Roe, the former ambassador in Constantinople, who did not, however, hold any office at court, although he was employed by Charles I in diplomatic missions in the late 1630s and early 1640s. Relations with James Hay, earl of Carlisle, the king's groom of the stool (1580-1636), were also friendly, but Carlisle was neither influential nor determined enough to create a pro-palatine party at court, although men such as Sir John Coke, one of the two secretaries of state, and the earls of Holland, Northumberland, and Leicester were sympathetic to the palatines. But ardent adherents of the queen like Georg Rudolf Weckherlin, a German by birth and one of Coke's assistants, remained isolated at court, and Elizabeth's official representative in England, her former secretary Sir Francis Nethersole, lacked the tact and discretion necessary to promote the palatine cause. In December 1633 he wrote to Secretary Coke accusing Charles I of having neglected the interests of his sister. The Palatinate, Nethersole argued, had been lost through his father's and the king's own fault, and there would be no hope of regaining the principality if Charles continued to ignore his sister's interests. The king took offence, and had Nethersole, who had initially taken refuge in the Dutch embassy, arrested. His correspondence was seized and the letters he had received from Elizabeth examined by the privy council. Elizabeth had to dismiss her servant, who was banished from the court. In spite of the misgivings she clearly had about her brother's political inertia with respect to the Palatinate, she nevertheless remained opposed to a closer co-operation with France which Rusdorf, still one of her most influential advisers, advocated. 
In 1635 Elizabeth sent her son Charles Lewis -- who was later joined by his younger brother Rupert -- to England to gain Charles's support, but he achieved very little in political terms. When King Charles sent the earl of Arundel to Vienna in 1636 in a seemingly last attempt to have the palatine problem solved by peaceful means, Elizabeth remained extremely sceptical and was as opposed as ever to any concessions to Bavarian and Habsburg interests. The failure of the mission spared her at least the necessity of rejecting an unsatisfactory compromise between Charles and the emperor, which might have been founded on a marriage alliance between Charles Lewis and the imperial dynasty. In October 1638 Rupert, who had followed his brother Charles Lewis into the field to fight against the emperor, was taken prisoner by imperial troops. He was taken to Austria, where he remained in captivity for more than three years. Charles Lewis himself had escaped but was arrested in France in 1639, partly because the French suspected him of trying to recruit an army of his own in Germany among troops who served France, but perhaps also intending to keep him as a hostage in case England should side with Spain in the Franco-Spanish War. This incident confirmed Elizabeth in her innate distrust of French policy. Charles Lewis was released after about half a year, but he and his brothers, as well as Elizabeth herself, were now about to be confronted by difficult choices on account of the political crisis of the Stuart monarchy. 
When civil war broke out in England in 1642, Rupert and his younger brother Maurice decided to fight for the king, whereas Charles Lewis showed clear sympathies for parliament and issued a manifesto in October 1642 in his own and his mother's name in which he distanced himself from his uncle (Green, 358). Elizabeth's own sympathies were apparently more with Rupert than with Charles Lewis in this matter, although she wrote to Roe in April 1643 that she had only refrained from advising Rupert and Maurice to leave England because, having once joined the king's army, their honour was now engaged in the fight for the royal cause. She certainly knew that there was a greater chance of receiving financial aid from parliament than from her brother, and she apparently accepted her eldest son's decision to go to England in 1644 to seek the support of parliament for his cause and financial relief. Elizabeth herself sent a petition to both houses in April 1643 to request their help and support on the advice of Sir Thomas Roe, who had even proposed to ask the queen of Bohemia to mediate between her brother and parliament during the earlier stages of the conflict. Parliament had hardly any money to spare for the exiled princess, but further petitions followed. Only her brother's trial and execution caused her to break off all contacts with Charles's old enemies. She came to detest Cromwell and saw him as the very Beast from the book of 'Revelation'. Although her relations with her eldest son had always been affectionate in the past, his dubious attitude in this moment -- he was present in England when his uncle was executed -- was not easily forgiven. Relations further deteriorated when he refused to comply with his mother's request for generous financial support and a formal transfer to her of the lands and castles which formed her jointure according to her marriage treaty after the restoration of the palatine dynasty in the Lower Palatinate by the treaty of Westphalia in 1648. In Elizabeth's eyes it was an essential precondition for an eventual return to the Palatinate that she should gain possession of these lands. As no agreement could be reached on this point between Charles Lewis and herself, she stayed at The Hague after 1648. The final success of the cause she had fought for for such a long time -- the return of the Palatinate to its native dynasty -- therefore brought her personally little joy or relief. 
In fact, Elizabeth's financial situation in the Netherlands, which had become desperate after the outbreak of war in England, hardly improved after the Westphalian peace. In the early 1640s she had still been able to rely on the support of William, Lord Craven, one of her most ardent admirers and closest friends and a frequent visitor at her court, but the outcome of the civil war had ruined Craven, like many other real or suspected royalists. Furthermore, the Dutch states general refused to support her any longer after the end of the war with Spain in 1648 and the political eclipse of the house of Orange in 1650. The contrast between the claim to royal status which she never abandoned and the reality of life in her household, where poverty and a pronounced lack of discipline among the servants, who hardly received any regular wages, dominated, became ever more glaring and it was increasingly difficult to keep nervous creditors at bay. 
Elizabeth's situation was not made easier by the tensions within her family. Her son Edward had gone to Paris in the 1640s, where he married Anne de Gonzague, daughter of Charles, duke of Nevers, Mantua, and Montferrat, an attractive and wealthy woman eight years his senior who played a prominent role in French aristocratic society. Before the marriage Edward converted to Catholicism, a severe shock for his mother, although Elizabeth later forgave him his apostasy. Her youngest son, Philip, caused her even more trouble. In June 1646 he killed one of her courtiers and youthful admirers, the count de l'Espinay, whom malicious tongues credited with a love affair either with the widowed queen herself or with her daughter Louise Hollandine. Philip had to leave the Netherlands, and Elizabeth broke off all contact with him. He died in 1650. Two years later another son, Maurice, also died prematurely, when his ship sank in the Caribbean during one of the privateering raids he and his brother Rupert had undertaken against the merchant fleet of the hated English Commonwealth. Of Elizabeth's daughters her namesake Elizabeth was probably the most gifted. She studied science and philosophy, and when Descartes stayed in the Netherlands a friendship between the princess and the philosopher developed. After the philosopher's death in Sweden she was disconsolate and left her mother's court, went to Brandenburg, and eventually became abbess of the protestant ecclesiastical community of Herford. Her sister Henrietta married Sigismund Rakoczi, prince of Transylvania, but died soon afterwards, in February 1652. Louise Hollandine had in many ways been closest to her mother, but life in exile and poverty proved too much of a strain for her. In December 1657 she suddenly left her mother's court in secret and went to France, where she, like her brother Edward, became a Catholic. She entered a monastery and eventually became abbess of Maubuisson in 1664. As opposed to Edward's conversion, Louise's flight and change of religion never found Elizabeth's forgiveness. Even Sophia, her youngest daughter, who later depicted her mother in her memoirs as a somewhat distant figure who cared more for her dogs and monkeys than for her children, did not get on too well with her. Against her mother's will she left The Hague for Heidelberg in 1650, and married Ernst August of Brunswick in 1658, a younger son whom Elizabeth did not consider a suitable match for her daughter. She was unable to foresee that Ernst August was to become the first elector of Hanover and father of King George I. Of her sons and daughters Rupert was undoubtedly closest to his mother in Elizabeth's last years. When he returned to England after the Restoration which he and his mother had so eagerly awaited, Elizabeth became reluctant to stay any longer in the Netherlands. However, the invitation by Charles II which she expected did not materialize. She therefore decided to go to England even against the king's wishes in May 1661. In London she stayed at the house her old friend the earl of Craven owned in Drury Lane. As in the past, Craven proved to be a great support in difficult times. The earl undoubtedly admired her, but rumours that they were married in secret in the 1650s, or that there was at least a secret love affair between them, seem to be unsubstantiated. In February 1662 Elizabeth decided to acquire a residence of her own and moved to Leicester House. Apparently the removal in the midst of winter was too much for her. She died shortly afterwards, on 13 February at Leicester House, in the presence of her son Prince Rupert, probably from the effects of severe bronchitis, an illness she had suffered from in its chronic form for a long time. On 17 February she was buried in Westminster Abbey next to Prince Henry. 
Like few other women of the early seventeenth century Elizabeth Stuart has continued to fascinate the popular imagination in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Her life and character seemed in many ways to provide the ideal material for romantic novels. But even if one discards this romantic version of her life, the pertinacity and willpower she demonstrated in defending her own ideals and her family's interests for so long, with very few material resources and relying more on her charm and reputation than on political power, remain remarkable. Although sometimes considered by contemporaries as arrogant and frivolous as a young princess, she managed to adapt surprisingly well to life in exile, and later to her position as the female head of an outlawed dynasty. Political success, however, proved elusive in spite of her endeavours, and in the newly established European order, emerging from the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War, there was no longer any place for her political ideals inspired by the militant protestantism of her youth, except, possibly, in the English republic which had, however, killed her brother. At odds with most of her children she had, in the last decade before her death, become the survivor of an earlier age, isolated and without a country which she could really consider her own.

Besch, Anthony John Elwyn (1924-2002), opera director, was born at 193 Chatsworth Road, Kilburn, London, on 5 February 1924, the son of Roy Cressy Frederick Besch, chartered accountant, and his wife, Annie Gwendolen, 'nee' Jones, both of 90 Fordwych Road, West Hampstead. He was educated at Rossall School, Lancashire, and then went up for a year to Worcester College, Oxford, before being enlisted in the artillery in 1943. He served in Sussex, Kent, India, and Malaya. On demobilization he returned to Oxford, where he completed his degree in English literature, graduating with a first-class degree in 1949. 
In 1947, while still an undergraduate, Besch directed a successful production of Mozart's 'Idomeneo', then a rarity, for the Oxford University Opera Club. He followed this up the following year with 'La clemenza di Tito'. He started his professional career in 1950 as assistant to Moran Caplat, general manager of Glyndebourne, a post he held until 1953, working with Carl Ebert and Gunther Rennert. He then staged two productions for Welsh National Opera in Cardiff, the world premiere of 'Menna' by Arwel Hughes in 1953 and Verdi's 'The Sicilian Vespers' in 1954. In the latter opera he demonstrated outstanding ability for working with the chorus, then entirely amateur. For the Bath festival of 1955, he directed Gretry's 'Zemire et Azor', conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. He returned to Glyndebourne in 1957 to direct Mozart's one-act 'Der Schauspieldirektor', and to Bath in 1959 to stage Purcell's 'Dido and Aeneas'. That same year he directed 'Rodelinda', with Joan Sutherland in the title role, for the Handel Opera Society, and the British premiere of Luigi Dallapiccola's 'The Prisoner' for the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells Theatre. A busy year ended with two new productions for Sadler's Wells Opera (later English National Opera), Giordano's 'Andrea Chenier' and Wagner's 'Tannhauser'. 
During the 1960s Besch staged several notably successful productions for Sadler's Wells, including Bizet's 'The Pearl Fishers' and Donizetti's 'Don Pasquale' in 1960. These were followed by Strauss's 'Ariadne on Naxos' in 1961 and Rossini's 'Count Ory' in 1963. 'Count Ory' was immensely popular and was revived again and again, even after the company moved to the much larger London Coliseum. Another Rossini opera, 'The Thieving Magpie', and Tchaikovsky's 'Queen of Spades' were well received in 1966. In 1963 Besch had begun a fruitful collaboration with Scottish Opera (under the directorship of Peter Hemmings) by staging Verdi's 'Otello', followed by Gounod's 'Faust' in 1964 and Britten's 'Albert Herring' in 1966. These were all popular, but his production of Mozart's 'Cosi fan tutte' with Scottish Opera in 1967, starring Janet Baker and Elizabeth Harwood, was judged one of the finest opera productions of the decade and was revived over many years. During this period he also directed two first performances for the Aldeburgh festival, Lennox Berkeley's 'The Castaway' in 1967 and Harrison Birtwistle's controversial 'Punch and Judy' in 1968. 
Besch was much in demand abroad. He travelled to Auckland for Bizet's 'Carmen'; to Buenos Aires for Verdi's 'Attila' and Strauss's 'Elektra'; to the Wexford Festival for Gounod's 'Mireille', Rossini's 'Otello', and Puccini's 'La rondine'; to Washington for Cavalli's 'L'Ormindo'; to San Francisco for 'The Magic Flute': and to New York City Opera for Charpentier's 'Louise' and Britten's 'Albert Herring'. He was director of the opera school at Toronto University for a year, during which he staged Rossini's 'Turco in Italia' and Humphrey Searle's 'Hamlet'. 
Besch continued to work with Scottish Opera throughout the 1970s, and some of his finest productions dated from that period. Britten's 'Turn of the Screw' in 1970 toured to Iceland, and Strauss's 'Der Rosenkavalier' scored a triumph in 1971. Monteverdi's 'Coronation of Poppea' was almost equally successful in 1973. The premiere of Iain Hamilton's 'Catiline Conspiracy' and a production of Gluck's 'Alceste' made an interesting contrast in 1974, while 'Ariadne on Naxos' in 1975 was very popular. Besch added Britten's 'Rape of Lucretia' to the repertory in 1976, and in 1980 Puccini's 'Tosca', controversially set during the Second World War, annoyed some people but pleased most. Such departures from traditional staging were rare for Besch, who usually followed the example of his mentor, Carl Ebert, with imaginative but uncontroversial productions. However, his choice of operas to direct was often untraditional, as his work with the New Opera Company demonstrated. He staged magnificent productions of Shostakovich's comic opera 'The Nose' and of Szymanowski's 'King Roger'. He directed the British premieres of Alberto Ginastera's 'Bomarzo' in 1976 and Bohuslav Martinu's 'Julietta' in 1978, both given excellent performances by the New Opera Company in conjunction with English National Opera at the Coliseum. Meanwhile, in 1974 Besch directed an acclaimed production of 'La clemenza di Tito' for the Royal Opera at Covent Garden, and the same year staged the German premiere of Britten's 'Death in Venice' at the Deutsche Oper, Berlin. He followed a popular production of 'The Magic Flute' for English National Opera in 1975 with a successful 'Don Giovanni' in 1976. Abroad, he worked in Houston, Miami, and St Louis; and in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. 
From 1986 to 1989 Besch was head of opera studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. During his tenure there he staged notable productions of Martinu's 'Julietta'; the first British performance of Rossini's 'Il viaggio a Reims'; Bizet's 'La jolie fille de Perth'; Offenbach's comic opera 'Robinson Crusoe'; Musgrave's 'Voice of Ariadne'; and Rossini's 'La pietra del paragone'. In 1993 he directed a particularly enjoyable production of Haydn's 'L'infedelta delusa' for Garsington Opera. After his retirement Besch lived in Richmond, Surrey. In 1999 he suffered a mild stroke, which slowed him down to an extent he found frustrating. He died on 23 December 2002 at Bridge House, 64 High Street, Twyford, Berkshire, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his long-term partner, the Australian production designer John Stoddart.

Emslie, George Carlyle, Baron Emslie (1919-2002), judge, was born at 8 Carlton Gardens, Glasgow, on 6 December 1919, the eldest child of Alexander Emslie (1888-1972), an insurance company manager, and his wife, Jessie Blair, 'nee' Carlyle (1890-1976). His parents were both Scottish, his father being descended from an Aberdeenshire farming family. He attended Albert Road Academy and Glasgow high school and went on to Glasgow University, graduating MA in 1940. On the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered for active service and, after an initial posting to the Manchester regiment, he was commissioned in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He fought in north Africa, Italy, Greece, and Austria. In 1944 he passed out from the staff college at Haifa and became one of the youngest brigade majors in the army. He was mentioned in dispatches and appointed MBE (military division) for his war service in 1946. On 2 October 1942 he had married Lilias Ann Mailer Hannington (died 1998), whom he had met at university and who was then serving as a chief petty officer in the Women's Royal Naval Service. She was the daughter of Robert Hannington, company director. They had three sons, Nigel, Derek, and Richard. 
After the war, although encouraged to stay in the army, Emslie returned to Glasgow to take his law degree and complete his apprenticeship with Marshall and McLachlan, solicitors. Moving to Edinburgh, he devilled for Harald Leslie and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates, the Scottish bar, in 1948. For the next twenty years his work at the court of session was dominated by personal injury cases. With his capacity for hard work and clear thinking, Emslie soon established himself in the field and, after he took silk in 1957, he was recognized as one of the outstanding counsel at the bar. Acting mostly for defenders, he regularly used his skill in courteous cross-examination to expose the weaknesses and contradictions in his opponent's position. This skill was on display in 1963 when he successfully represented the eleventh duke of Argyll in his divorce action against the duchess, a prominent figure in London society, on the ground of her adultery. Despite opposition, Emslie destroyed her credibility in the witness box by taxing her with diary entries about various sexual partners and a notorious photograph of her engaging in a sexual act with an unidentified man -- which later featured in the report by Lord Denning on the Profumo affair. 
In 1963 Emslie was appointed sheriff of Perth and Angus. Two years later he was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates. With the active encouragement of the vice-dean and the clerk of faculty, he presided over much needed reforms which, in particular, reduced the financial barriers that had hitherto prevented many people from joining the faculty. In 1970 he became a judge of the court of session and in March 1972 he was appointed to succeed Lord Clyde as lord president of the court of session and lord justice general of Scotland. He held the combined offices until his retirement in September 1989. 
Although his practice had been almost exclusively civil, it was in criminal law that Emslie made his greatest impact. Under Lord Clyde and his predecessors criminal appeals had been actively discouraged; the appeal court sat little and produced few judgments. Under Emslie the atmosphere changed completely. With the advent of legal aid, more appellants had counsel to represent them. He listened courteously to the arguments, whether from counsel or from the appellants themselves, and would then usually deliver an extempore judgment that presented the rival contentions with a clarity that made them almost unrecognizable to counsel who had just advanced them. This remarkable feat depended on long and meticulous preparation beforehand. Being decisive, and taking no delight in legal technicalities, he was able to state the law in succinct, uncluttered propositions, which proved invaluable to later judges. His judgments on the burden of proof of self-defence (in 'Lambie v. HM Advocate', 1973) and on oppression in bar of trial (in 'Stuurman v. HM Advocate', 1980) are examples. In civil cases, proceedings in the first division were equally courteous and fair. His judgments were rarely appealed against -- and even more rarely reversed by the House of Lords -- but, because the field was more developed, the impact of his decisions was inevitably less dramatic. Even so, later judges frequently relied on his typically forthright statements in cases such as 'Wordie Property Co. Ltd v. Secretary of State for Scotland', 1984 (on reasons in administrative decisions). 
During Emslie's time as lord president, the work of the court changed. To his regret, many fewer decisions in personal injury actions were taken to appeal, so that he somewhat lacked opportunities to deploy his expertise in the field. Since he was convinced of the inherent superiority of most aspects of Scots law and practice, he resisted changes that he considered to be unnecessary or harmful. Notably, provision for temporary judges in the court of session was not made until after his retirement. But his confidence and authority, combined with his mastery of the rules of procedure, made him an effective innovator when required. He amalgamated the separate civil and criminal administrations of the supreme courts, and so helped ease the strains imposed by the increased demands of criminal work. He presided over the smooth disappearance of undefended divorce proofs from the court of session. Somewhat reluctantly, and under pressure from the House of Lords, in 1985 he introduced new rules for judicial review of the decisions of public bodies, and so set in motion the development of Scottish public law. Although he was made a life peer in 1980, as Baron Emslie of Potterton, he went to sit judicially in the House of Lords only twice and did not make his maiden speech until 1990. 
Emslie was a tall man of military bearing whose general appearance and dress were never anything but immaculate. In some circles a supposed resemblance to the Kaiser earned him the affectionate nickname German George. By his very presence he dominated his court. To the casual observer he might seem remote, but experienced counsel could detect, by the stroking of his moustache or the twinkle in his eye, whether he was displeased or amused, whether an argument was finding favour or not. Outside the law, he was an elder of Cramond kirk and, for many years, the assiduous vice-chairman of the board of trustees of the National Library of Scotland. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1987 and took an active interest in its affairs. An essentially private man, however, he was devoted to his wife and sons, two of whom were to follow him onto the Scottish bench. He liked to holiday on Bute and latterly, with his wife, at Appin, where he could pursue his interest in bird-watching. In his youth he played football for Glasgow University and Scottish Universities and always maintained a keen interest in the game. He was also a fine cricketer and, even as lord president, would turn out for the bench and bar in an annual match. But his principal relaxation was (highly competitive) golf, and he much enjoyed the annual match with the English bench and bar. Whenever possible, at weekends he would play at Muirfield, which offered him a congenial setting in which to relax with friends. 
After his wife's death in 1998 Emslie successfully looked after himself and took up new interests, visiting his youngest son in South Africa and playing the piano every day. Despite suffering a slight stroke he lived independently right up until his sudden death on 20 November 2002 at his home, 47 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, following a heart attack. He was survived by his three sons.

Ferman, James Alan (1930-2002), film censor, was born James Alan Feuerman on 11 April 1930 in New York city, the only son and the elder of two children of Sol Sidney Feuerman, a film producer and medical film editor, and his wife, Muriel, a teacher. Educated at Great Neck high school and Cornell University (1948-51), where he graduated in English, he then served in the US Air Force, being posted to the Bentwaters base, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. After leaving the air force he returned to Britain, and studied for an MA at King's College, Cambridge, under F. R. Leavis. He lived in Britain for the rest of his life, although he retained his American nationality. On 16 June 1956 he married Monica Sophie Beament, 'nee' Robinson, a 31-year-old secretary, whose previous marriage had been dissolved. She was the daughter of Walter Robinson, restaurateur. They had a daughter, Lucy, and a son, John. While at Cambridge, Ferman (who had changed his name by deed poll before living in Britain) wrote 'Zuleika', a musical adaptation of Max Beerbohm's comedy 'Zuleika Dobson', which was successfully presented in the West End in 1957. 
In 1957 Ferman joined the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC), the independent television contractor, as a trainee director. He directed three plays for the 'Armchair Theatre' series, 'The Criminals' (1958), 'Till Death Us Do Part' (1959), and Wolf Mankowitz's adaptation of Jacques Duval's comedy 'The Model Marriage' (1959). Transferring to Associated Television (ATV), he worked on 'Emergency Ward 10', a long-running medical series, and was principal director of 'The Plane Makers' (a drama series about the aviation industry, which won an SFTA award in 1963), 'Miss Hanago' (which was the ATV entry for the Monte Carlo festival in 1965), 'Kafka's America' (which won the Critics' Circle award in 1966), and an adaptation of Somerset Maugham's 'Before the Party' (which won a BAFTA award in 1970). From 1965 he worked as a freelance, mainly for the BBC; he also worked occasionally as a stage producer and director. An interest in social problems, particularly drug addiction, led him to produce 'Drugs and Schoolchildren', a five-part documentary series for teachers and social workers, and to take a part-time job as lecturer in community studies from 1973 to 1976 at the Polytechnic of Central London, where he was also director and chairman of the community mental health programme. 
In mid-1975 Ferman was appointed secretary of the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), a position he occupied (from 1985 with the title of director) until his retirement at the end of 1998. At the time of his appointment the BBFC had been under fire for several years from opponents of the 1960s 'permissive society', who had had unprecedented recourse to the use of common law against films, with varying outcomes, which had created confusion within the film industry and at the BBFC. Ferman's liberal instinct, tempered by his social conscience, led him to spearhead film industry pressure on the Home Office to prohibit common law private prosecutions against films, and instead bring films within the scope of the 1959 'Obscene Publications Act'. His efforts eventually succeeded, and from 1977 films became subject to the act's test of obscenity, as the 'tendency to deprave and corrupt, taken as a whole'. He regarded this as his greatest achievement, and no BBFC-certificated film or video was subsequently found guilty of obscenity. 
Nevertheless by the early 1980s the film industry and the BBFC came under the spotlight in relation to newly marketed extreme horror videos, so-called 'video nasties'. The outcome was a form of state censorship of videos in the shape of the 1984 'Video Recordings Act', which the BBFC was called upon to operate. Although Ferman was never convinced that this act was necessary, he and the president of the BBFC, Lord Harlech, did much to shape its final provisions through negotiations with the Home Office. Ferman went on to supervise the act's implementation, and the physical expansion and modernization of the BBFC that this entailed. 
Until the late 1980s Ferman proved to be a relatively uncontroversial censor, but thereafter his decisions were increasingly criticized by some sections of the media, who again blamed video viewing for an increase in violence, and in particular several exceptionally nasty murders. He consequently felt obliged during this period to tread cautiously over films and videos with extremely violent or sexually explicit content, but even so he continued to take liberal decisions, a sufficient number of these to render him a key target for parliamentary moral crusaders amid a fierce anti-BBFC campaign led by the 'Daily Mail'. A disagreement in 1997 with the new home secretary, Jack Straw, over policy on classification of pornographic videos and a simultaneous failure to prevent Straw from imposing a new president upon the BBFC formed the immediate prelude to Ferman's retirement in 1998. 
Within the film industry and the BBFC Ferman was widely admired and respected, though he was unable to establish a rapport with the burgeoning video industry. At the BBFC his administrative reforms included the first censorship training programmes, while he inaugurated international censorship conferences with the over-optimistic aim of harmonizing film and video censorship among the world's democracies. He took endless trouble to allow a film or video if possible, often personally editing a work to make it conform to his requirements. A gifted perfectionist and workaholic, he was occasionally difficult with his colleagues, and the staff expansion which the 'Video Recording Act' forced upon the BBFC brought him into protracted conflict with some of the younger censors. This tension became public in 1994, and the media's coverage tended to reinforce his authoritarian image, but he never spared himself on the BBFC's behalf and accusations against him of undue secrecy were ill founded. Arguably he remained too long in a demanding post always involving a delicate balance between libertarians and advocates of strict censorship, but his mistakes were few within a heavy workload. In effect he became a personification of the BBFC and probably performed his duties as well as was humanly possible. He certainly left the BBFC in a far more flourishing condition than he found it. His retirement was short and plagued by ill health. Suffering from cancer of the prostate, he died of septicaemia and pneumonia at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, on 24 December 2002. He was survived by his wife, Monica, and their two children.

Millichip, Sir Frederick Albert (1914-2002), football administrator, was born on 5 August 1914 at 115 High Street, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, the son of Hugh Bowater Millichip, a master saddler (later a leather goods manufacturer and sports outfitter) and his wife, Lily, 'nee' Pester. He went to Solihull School where he developed an interest in sport, notably cricket and association football. As a young man he played both while working in his father's business. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 he joined the South Staffordshire regiment as a private, but was later commissioned in the Royal Artillery, serving in north Africa and Italy. He was demobilized in 1945 with the rank of captain. Meanwhile, on 24 February 1943 he had married Patricia Mary Long, the eighteen-year-old daughter of Arthur Long, a company director. The marriage was short-lived, and he later omitted it from his 'Who's Who' entry. 
After the war Millichip trained to be a solicitor, qualifying in 1950. On 27 December the same year he married (Joan) Barbara Brown, a 24-year-old nursing sister, and daughter of Harold Henry Brown, farmer. They had a son and a daughter. Meanwhile Millichip worked for, and eventually became a senior partner in, his uncle's firm of Sharpe and Millichip, of West Bromwich. His uncle was also the solicitor of West Bromwich Albion Football Club and when he retired, Bert Millichip, as he was always known, took his place. He joined the board of directors in 1964, becoming chairman in 1976. By this time he had become more deeply involved in the administration of the game and had been elected a member of the council of the Football Association (FA) in 1970. By 1978 he was chairman of its disciplinary committee and in 1981 he was elected chairman of the FA itself. He was to preside over fifteen of the most turbulent years in its history. 
In the twenty years after 1970 English football became notorious for the unruly behaviour of the crowds who paid to watch. The 'annus horribilis' was probably 1985, when there was both a riot at an FA cup replay between Luton Town and Millwall and the disaster at the Heysel stadium in Brussels before the European cup final, when the supporters of Liverpool charged those of Juventus, leading to the collapse of a wall and the crushing to death of thirty-nine Italian fans. Both incidents were widely seen on television. At the time of the Heysel stadium incident Millichip was in Mexico where the England team were playing in preparation for the 1986 world cup. He acted decisively, flying back and forth over the Atlantic and announcing the withdrawal of English clubs from European competitions. The Confederation of European Football Associations later banned English clubs for five years and Liverpool for six. 
The Thatcher government's preferred solution to hooliganism at football matches in the United Kingdom was a membership and identity card scheme. This was an idea which few inside the sport supported, although, like Millichip, most were at a loss as to what could be done. But after the disaster at Hillsborough, Sheffield, before the FA cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in April 1989, when eighty-nine people were crushed to death, the government's committee of inquiry, chaired by Lord Taylor, came out against identity cards, recommending instead the removal of fences from around the pitch and the replacement of the traditional standing terraces by seats on all major sports grounds. 
If what to do about hooliganism was never far away from Millichip's thoughts, the second big issue that demanded his attention was who should run football. The FA was in theory responsible for all football, both the recreational and the professional spectacle. But since 1888 the Football League had largely been left to organize the professional side of the game, which it had done on a basis of mutuality. In practice this meant some transfer of wealth from the bigger clubs to the smaller ones, so exercising some control over market forces. These ideas were under some strain during the 1980s, with some of the bigger clubs threatening to break away from the traditional structures in order to make their own deals with television. These matters were made more urgent by the Taylor report. Replacing standing terraces with seats was not only expensive in itself but reduced the capacity of the stadiums. Some of the cost could be met by increasing the price of admission, but there was a limit to what spectators would be prepared to pay. Satellite television proved the saviour. In 1988 British Satellite Broadcasting had identified sport in general and football in particular as a way of building up a mass pay-per-view audience. Two years later the company merged with Rupert Murdoch's Sky to form BSkyB, which was prepared to pay $304 million over five years for exclusive coverage of the top matches. 
The clubs in the old first division saw this as an opportunity to break away from the Football League, with its old-fashioned ideas of caring and sharing. Millichip and the FA, whose relations with the league had not always been harmonious, connived with the top clubs to produce a blueprint for football which involved setting up a premier league and leaving the rest of the clubs in the Football League to fend for themselves. It is not clear how far Millichip was an initiator of these changes or whether he merely acquiesced in them. He rarely seems to have talked the language of reform and claimed to have had reservations about the premier league. He pointed out, though after the event, that not only had the footballing rich become richer as a result but the footballing poor had become richer too. Nevertheless many football supporters questioned whether it was the role of the FA to throw in its lot with the richest clubs, who were increasingly concerned with pursuing their own commercial interests. 
Millichip played an important part in the successful organization and presentation of the FA's bid in 1993 to host the European football championship of 1996. Unfortunately he was more noted for a mysterious but damaging episode associated with it. The success of the 1996 tournament led to the FA's bidding for the 2006 world cup. When the FA's intention was made public, the German football association claimed that the English were in breach of an agreement which Millichip had verbally made with German football officials, that if they supported the English bid for the 1996 European championships, the FA would support a German bid for the 2006 world cup. There was apparently nothing in writing, and Millichip said he could not remember having made such an agreement, but the words 'perfidious' and 'Albion' were brought together in many British and European newspapers. 
Millichip once said that he was an amateur at heart. What he probably meant was that he looked back to an earlier football world where football was less of a business, when players behaved with more self-control both on and off the field, and when crowd trouble was as rare as sunshine in November. He opposed, though he could not prevent, the sponsorship of the FA cup. Some of his views seemed to reflect an anxiety about the modern world. In 1980 he wrote to the then chairman of the FA, Sir Harold Thompson, about the 'terminal moral decay' which he felt was evident in both football and wider society (Millichip to Thompson, 26 Sept 1980, Thompson papers). He occasionally spoke out in favour of the return of corporal punishment. He regretted that more of his time as FA chairman was spent defending football rather than promoting it. But he served in difficult times, and faced problems far more complex than any faced by his predecessors. 
Millichip was a member of the UEFA executive committee from 1988 to 1996, having been a member of its organizing committee for the European championship since 1981. He was chairman of its committee for five-a-side football from 1988 to 1992 and of its juridical committee from 1992 to 1993. He was knighted for his services to football in 1991 and made an honorary DLitt by Loughborough University in 1995. David Davies, a senior football administrator, described him as 'unfailingly kind, approachable and such a polite man, a true gentleman' ('The Independent', 19 Dec 2002). He died suddenly on 18 December 2002, at Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, following a heart attack which struck while he was attending an annual dinner at Edgbaston golf club. He was survived by his wife, Barbara, and their two children.

Rennie, Sir John Shaw (1917-2002), colonial governor and international civil servant, was born in Cathcart, Glasgow, on 12 January 1917, the only son of John Shaw Rennie, an electrical engineering draughtsman, and his wife, Sarah, 'nee' Dick. He was the great-grandson of Thomas Rennie, curator of Glasgow Art Gallery. When he was ten his mother died and his father emigrated to Canada, leaving him to be brought up by aunts in Glasgow. He was educated at Hillhead high school and at Glasgow University, and with an aptitude for languages he gained a first in French and German. He joined the colonial administrative service and was sent immediately to Balliol College, Oxford, for a one-year course in administration. His first posting as a cadet was to Tanganyika in 1940. He was appointed an assistant district officer there in 1942 and then district officer in 1949. He married, in Glasgow on 26 February 1946, the 28-year-old (Mary) Winifred McAlpine Robertson, an assistant principal in the Colonial Office, and daughter of James Bryson Robertson, solicitor. They had met while studying at Glasgow University. They had one son, Neil. 
In 1951 Rennie was sent to Mauritius but stayed only four years before his appointment as British resident commissioner in the New Hebrides. He returned to Mauritius in 1962 as governor and commander-in-chief and was in office there in March 1968 when Mauritius became independent, within the Commonwealth, with Seewoosagur Ramgoolam as prime minister. At Ramgoolam's invitation, Rennie stayed on as governor-general until August 1968. 
Rennie joined the United Nations after a friend suggested that he should go to Beirut to help to administer the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The agency had been established in December 1949 by the general assembly to provide 'continued assistance for the relief of Palestinian refugees' and to 'further conditions of peace and stability'. Appointed deputy commissioner-general in 1968, under the American Laurence Michelmore, he arrived in Beirut just after the Six Day War. The war created more Palestinian refugee camps, particularly in Jordan. Rennie was appointed commissioner-general of UNRWA in 1971 on the strong recommendation of Michelmore, who was so keen that Rennie should succeed him that he had taken Rennie to New York to meet the UN secretary-general, U Thant, in order to impress upon the latter that Rennie was the right man for the job. U Thant breached convention with the appointment of Rennie, since this was traditionally an American post. 
Rennie was commissioner-general of UNRWA from 1971 to 1977, years which saw the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and civil war in Lebanon. Nothing could have prepared him for the problems he would encounter. This was one of the most difficult jobs the international civil service had to offer. But no matter the problems, and they were legion, he considered his appointment a considerable honour. He was a great believer in the work of the UN and the ideals that it stood for. The agency, when he took over, was twenty-one years old and had a welfare state of its own, with 500 schools with a quarter of a million pupils and some 7000 teachers. This was the most ambitious educational undertaking under international administration and nearly half the agency funding was devoted to it. The agency also provided health care and welfare in refugee camps in the host countries of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza strip. The headquarters of UNRWA were in Beirut, in a former French barracks set among mature palm trees on the so-called green line, but Rennie's work entailed a great deal of travelling to field offices in Damascus, Amman, and other Arab cities. Like most UN endeavours the agency was plagued with financial insecurity; UNRWA depended almost entirely on voluntary contributions for its regular and emergency operations and there were times when Rennie feared that he would be unable to pay the monthly salaries of the agency's teachers and medical staff. The agency was successful only in the limited sense in which success is measured in many UN operations: it helped to ameliorate a bad situation without eradicating it. The civil war in the Lebanon eventually forced the agency to close its Beirut headquarters. It moved to Vienna, an idea promoted by UN secretary-general Kurt Waldheim, keen for the UN to have as many offices as possible in his native Austria. Rennie and his staff considered this an unfortunate development. He left the agency in 1977 and retired. 
Rennie was appointed OBE in 1955, CMG in 1958, KCMG in 1962, and GCMG in 1968. He loved art and poetry and had a happy retirement, dividing his time between Islington in London and Umbria in Italy. He had a wonderful memory and in retirement compiled a comprehensive account of his service, having collecting additional information during frequent visits to the Public Record Office. He wanted this account, though not intended for publication, to be made available for the benefit of future scholars. He suffered a heart attack on hearing the news that his only son, Neil, a university lecturer, had been seriously injured in a road accident, and died in London on 12 August 2002. He was survived by his wife, Winifred, and their son, who made a full recovery.

Robbins, (Richard) Michael (1915-2002), transport administrator and historian, was born at 51 Rotherwick Road, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 7 September 1915, the eldest of the three children of Alfred Gordon Robbins (1883-1944), journalist and publisher, and his wife, Josephine, daughter of R. L. Capell of Northampton. His mother was the first woman to be employed by the 'Northampton Daily Echo'. His father, after working as a journalist in Yorkshire, joined the editorial staff of 'The Times' in 1908 and was the parliamentary correspondent from 1914 to 1920 and day editor from 1920 to 1927. He subsequently joined Ernest Benn Ltd, of which he became deputy chairman. 
Robbins was brought up in Hampstead Garden Suburb, and entered Westminster School as a king's scholar in September 1929. There he met Jack Simmons, a member of the same election and a lifelong friend in an association in which the railway was a third party. Captain of the school in 1933, Robbins went on to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1934. He was a classicist, and it is an interesting measure of his personal qualities that he prevailed upon the college and the university to allow him to proceed to Greats, 'literae humaniores', without the (to him) superfluous preliminary of reading for classical honour moderations in his first two years. He was awarded a second class in 'literae humaniores' and a Dixon scholarship in 1937, but did not graduate BA until 1952. He spent a year abroad after his final examinations, in Vienna until the Anschluss and then in Switzerland. 
After leaving Oxford, Robbins was thinking of journalism as a career, an interest drawn from both sides of his family, but a chance meeting between his father and Frank Pick led to his appointment in the summer of 1939 as a management trainee with London Transport. In December of that year he was called up for military service: he joined the Royal Engineers and was commissioned in December 1940. In 1941 he was posted to Persia with the 190 Railway Operating Company. In the course of the Second World War he also served in Egypt and Iraq, but his chief responsibility lay with the railway linking the gulf with Azerbaijan and the Soviet Union. He was promoted major in 1944. Meanwhile, on 21 October 1939 he had married (Rose Margaret) Elspeth Bannatyne (1917-1993), elder daughter of Sir Robert Reid Bannatyne, civil servant, of Ardingly, Sussex. They had a son and two daughters, and their family life was a constant source of strength to Robbins in a busy and demanding career. 
On demobilization Robbins returned to London Transport, and became secretary to the chairman, Lord Ashfield. The war disrupted the managerial programme, and no graduates had been appointed since 1939. In the meantime Robbins had acquired not only practical but also administrative experience that included diplomatic and political exigencies. He was the first officer of London Transport to attend the staff training college at Henley, and subsequently became secretary to the London Transport executive and its chief commercial and public relations officer in 1955. He was secretary to the London plan working party, which projected Route C, the later Victoria Line, and opened the first stage of that line in 1969. In 1971 he became managing director (railways), responsible among other ventures for the Heathrow extension of the Piccadilly Line in 1977 and the first stages of the Jubilee Line in 1979. He was president of the Chartered Institute of Transport in 1975-6. He was a notably effective manager of committees, a product of his mastery of technical detail and a range of diplomatic skills. 
Immersed as he was in the practical problems of London Transport, Robbins also found time for a remarkable number of historical studies. His long friendship with Jack Simmons was rooted in a shared interest in railways and especially the history of railways. While still at school they launched a periodical, 'Locomotion', which ran from 1931 to 1939 with an imprint which survived as the Oakwood Press. At Oxford, Robbins drafted 'The North London Railway', published in 1947, a study of a quality far beyond the general run of such literature. After the war he compiled an account of his experiences in the Middle East under the title '190 in Persia', privately printed in 1951. His interests ranged more widely, however. He was an energetic and observant walker, and when Jack Simmons was planning a historical and topographical series to be called 'A New Survey of England', for Collins, the publishers, Robbins offered to contribute a volume on Middlesex. He delivered the text within two years, and the book appeared in 1953. It was an exemplary survey of a county which hardly fitted into the established pattern of local antiquarian studies. In the event only one other volume appeared, 'Devon', by W. G. Hoskins, and the series foundered, but Robbins's contribution, which was of lasting interest, was characteristic both of his energy and of his discriminating judgement. He became an active officer of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society, and was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1957. He served as treasurer of the society in 1971 and as president in 1987-91. In the meantime he was consulted by Nikolaus Pevsner over the Middlesex volume of the 'Buildings of England' series, and Pevsner successfully proposed him as the chairman of the Victorian Society in 1978. 
Robbins's reputation as a historian was confirmed by his collaboration with Theodore Barker in the 'History of London Transport', the second volume of which (1974) was almost entirely his work. He was also interested in museums. He was responsible for the preservation of Metropolitan Railway Locomotive no. 23 and eventually saw it installed in London's Transport Museum in Covent Garden. He was a founder trustee of the Museum of London and chairman of the governors between 1979 and 1990. After English Heritage was established in 1984, in succession to the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments, he was appointed to the ancient monuments advisory committee (1986-91). In 1987 he became vice-chairman of the Greater Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. He was also an active member of the international metropolitan railways committee of the International Union of Public Transport from 1976 to 1981. He was appointed CBE in 1976. His practical experience was of great assistance to the many societies and institutions in which he held office, but his scholarship was as widely valuable as his administrative expertise. 
Robbins's public and professional manner was generally formal: his dress, with a watch-chain bearing the silver medallion of the transport executive and a universal railway pass, his carefully groomed moustache, and his habit of addressing his staff only by their surnames, were redolent of Edwardian manners. His private persona, however, was warm, amused, and even boyish when a topic aroused his enthusiasm, though his style was unfailingly elegant. First and last he exemplified the potential of a classical education. He died on 21 December 2002 at his home, 18 Fullerton Court, 27 Udney Park Road, Teddington, Middlesex, following a heart attack. He was survived by his three children, his wife, Elspeth, having predeceased him. A service of thanksgiving for his life was held at St James's, Piccadilly, on 19 March 2003.

Schapiro, Boris (1909-2002), bridge player and gambler, was born in Riga, Latvia, on 22 August 1909 (9 August old style), into a wealthy Jewish family of horse dealers, the son of a Russian-speaking father, Herman Schapiro, and a German-speaking mother. After the German invasion of Latvia in 1914 the family moved to St Petersburg, where Schapiro attended Madame Bombeck's kindergarten. The family fled Russia during the revolution, escaping by cattle truck to Odessa, where they met Captain Sherwood, the British master of the 'Dago', who had shipped Schapiro horses to Hull. With his help they arrived at Toulon on armistice day 1918, then proceeded via Paris to Doncaster, where a branch of the family business had been established in the 1850s, providing horses for the London Bus Company, pit ponies, and hunters. Continuing this business, Herman Schapiro also diversified into meat and textiles. 
Schapiro was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, before being dispatched to Bradford Technical College, to emerge as a fellow of the Textile Institute. He briefly attended the Sorbonne, but concentrated less on philosophy than chasing girls. Joining the family business, he bought meat for its butcher shops at Smithfield at 3 a.m., often playing bridge at the Hamilton Club until then. He worked for his father in Hamburg until 1935, when, interpreting for Viscount Castlerosse (in Berlin to interview Hitler for the 'Daily Express'), he provoked some Brownshirts and spent two nights in a Gestapo gaol. On 10 August 1935 he married Genia Gitta Slutzkin ('b'. 1908/9), daughter of Julius Slutzkin, a Russian leather merchant. Fluent in Russian, German, French, and English, he served in the Army Intelligence Corps during the Second World War. In the early 1950s he left the family business for the baccarat syndicate at Crockford's, the premier London gaming club, utilizing his experience as a racecourse bookmaker. Later he supplemented his income through journalism. His first marriage was dissolved in 1967, and on 25 March 1970 he married Helen May Johnson ('b'. 1942/3), secretary, and daughter of Arthur Johnson, sales manager. There were no children of either marriage. 
Schapiro played tennis at Wimbledon in 1936, losing in the first round. He had also been an international showjumping and dressage competitor. Increasingly, however, his life became dominated by bridge. He had played for money since boyhood, and won a world tournament in 1932 with Oswald Jacoby, his partner from the world auction bridge pairs in 1929. He began playing seriously after the Second World War, his partners including Sophocles Venizelos (later prime minister of Greece), Omar Sharif, and Iain Macleod (later chancellor of the exchequer). Quick tempered, sharp tongued, and critical of his partners, he regularly indulged in gamesmanship, including singing at the table, intimidation, and insult. He often played with his poodle, Vodka, on his lap. His pugnacity was emphasized by prominent pale eyes, an undershot jaw, and 'a gruff accent which retained traces of his native Latvian', but equally displayed 'a mastery of the earthier elements of the vernacular' ('The Times', 2 Dec 2002). Excitable, irascible, grumpy, he did not mellow with age. Nevertheless, his wicked sense of humour, an unexpected Slavonic warmth and charm, and self-confidence commanded respect, affection, and loyalty. Never one to withhold a witticism for reasons of taste, his standard greeting to a good-looking lady was, 'Fancy a spot of adultery?' He infuriated Rixi Markus by saying, 'The Almighty delighted man by inventing bridge and adultery. When he created Rixi, he combined them' ('The Times', 4 Dec 2002). 
Schapiro preferred natural approaches, but played the complex 'little major' with Terence Reese. Theirs was a formidable partnership, his flair complemented by Reese's superb technical analysis. (Schapiro later claimed to have won $50 by betting that Reese, whose concentration was legendary, would not notice a naked woman opposite as he played the hand.) After winning the Portland pairs in 1946 they dominated British and international bridge from 1948 to 1965, winning the Bermuda bowl in 1955; the European teams in 1948, 1949, 1954 and 1963; the mixed teams olympiad in 1962, with Fritzi Gordon and Rixi Markus; the 'Sunday Times' invitational in 1964; and taking silvers in the world teams olympiad in 1960 and world pairs in 1962. 
A crisis occurred at the 1965 Bermuda bowl in Buenos Aires. B. Jay Becker and Dorothy Hayden, members of the North American team, and Alan Truscott, bridge editor of the 'New York Times', noticed that Schapiro and Reese held their cards inconsistently, and deduced a correlation of finger patterns with their holdings in hearts. John Gerber, the American captain, informed Ralph Swimer, captain of the British team, and Geoffrey Butler, chairman of the British Bridge League (BBL) and member of the World Bridge Federation (WBF) executive committee, who independently verified this. At a special meeting of the appeals committee the WBF found Reese and Schapiro guilty. The British conceded winning matches to Argentina and North America, and withdrew the pair from play. The WBF left the disciplinary decision to the BBL, who set up an independent inquiry by Sir John Foster QC and General Lord Bourne, assisted technically by Alan Hiron and Tony Priday. After ten months, they concluded that although the direct evidence was 'very strong' the testimony did not meet the highest standards of proof. The WBF rejected this verdict and in 1967 reaffirmed its decision. As Reese and Schapiro were still barred from playing, the BBF elected not to participate in the 1968 olympiad. In 1968 the WBF restored Reese and Schapiro to 'good standing', deeming that three years' punishment was sufficient. 
The incident did not go away, however: an article by Rixi Markus in the American 'Bridge World' brought a libel suit from Swimer; and Reese and Swimer's refusal to play against each other compromised the 1968 trials. Swimer reported that Schapiro had privately confessed, blaming Reese ('that evil man made me do it'); this Schapiro denied. Reese's 'Story of an Accusation' (1966) had analysed the hands in detail, arguing that had there been cheating the evidence would show; Alan Truscott's response, 'The Great Bridge Scandal' (1969), accused Reese of being selective and avoiding the direct issues. Some, including Omar Sharif, insisted that it was an American conspiracy, but the Americans remained equally insistent that the British verdict was a whitewash. Inconclusively exonerated, Schapiro remained bitter, weeping melodramatically whenever the accusation was mentioned. He did not play with Reese again, and avoided competitive bridge until 1975, instead playing high-stakes rubber. 
In 1966 the 'Sunday Times' appointed Schapiro bridge correspondent; his final column appeared the day he died. He wrote two books: 'Boris Schapiro on Bridge / Bridge Analysis' (1976); and, with Terence Reese, 'Bridge Card by Card' (1971). His world titles spanned sixty-six years, from 1932 to 1998, when at the age of eighty-nine he won the world senior pairs (with Irving Gordon, in Lille), and his eleventh gold cup. A world grandmaster, he was made an honorary life member of the English Bridge Union for services to bridge in 1998, recognition previously denied because of the scandal. Schapiro remained alert into his nineties, attributing this to bridge and horses. His ninetieth birthday was a sumptuous affair, the guests including Omar Sharif, Jaime Ortiz-Patino, and Prince Khalid Abdullah, and the occasion toasted with bottles of wine he had collected all his life. He died on 1 December 2002 at his home, Stable Cottage, Thame Road, Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, of fibrotic lung disease. He was survived by his second wife, Helen. In 2004 she sponsored in his memory the Schapiro spring foursomes. His 'Times' obituarist described him as one of bridge's most colourful and irrepressible characters, one of the finest, most intimidating, and 'incontestably' the most durable, concluding that 'In a game that attracts more than its fair share of dragons, Boris Schapiro breathed more fire than most' ('The Times', 2 Dec 2002).

Strummer, Joe (1952-2002), rock musician and songwriter, was born on 21 August 1952 in Ankara, Turkey, the younger son of Ronald Ralph Mellor (1916-1984), a clerical officer in the diplomatic service, and his wife, Anna, formerly Girvan, 'nee' MacKenzie (1915-1986), a nurse whose family farmed in the Scottish highlands. John and his brother, David (1951-1969), lived in Cairo, Mexico City, and Bonn before moving to Britain for the first time in 1959. Home became a modest bungalow at 15 Court Farm Road, Warlingham, Surrey. 
From 1961 Mellor joined his brother as a boarder at the City of London Freemen's School in Ashtead, Surrey. Owing to their father's postings to Iran and then Malawi they saw their parents infrequently and were left feeling rejected. (If Ronald Mellor in particular seemed unsympathetic, this may have been due to his own experience in an Indian orphanage after his parents -- his father was a railway official in the raj -- died.) Unusually, it was Mellor who looked after his much quieter older brother, but the relationship was never very close. Mellor made friends easily, increasingly via film and music tastes -- Marlon Brando, the Rolling Stones, and, above all, Bob Dylan; David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia' was also a favourite. Outsider status was a common thread. According to one teacher Mellor was a likeable but unacademic pupil, constitutionally unable to address any authority figure without casting his eyes downwards (private information). With a penchant for drawing cartoons, he left school in 1969 with two A-level passes in art and history -- enough to enter London's Central School of Art and Design in the autumn. 
That summer, however, proved highly traumatic. Obliged to move back home, Mellor bristled with pent-up grievances. The combination of private schooling and a relatively humble background had left him acutely class-conscious. He saw his father's career as years of kowtowing, while in turn Ronald Mellor -- who was appointed MBE in 1969 -- struggled to understand his long-haired, hippy son. This strained relationship reached breaking point in July when David committed suicide. Shy and frail, he had left school a year earlier, after which he involved himself with the occult and far-right politics before overdosing on aspirins. Mellor was devastated, blaming himself as much as his parents. Already reluctant to talk about his family, he subsequently clammed up even more. Another development also seems to have been connected to this upset: as a Dylan fan, he understood that escape could be achieved through reinvention. At art college he insisted that people call him Woody (after the folk-singer Woody Guthrie) and started speaking with an Americanized accent. 
Not one for half measures, Mellor quit his course before the end of the first year, bought a second-hand ukulele, and with it began the life of a busker, soon graduating to guitar. His playing was unorthodox but not ineffective. Although left-handed, he held his instrument as a right-hander would, making his less dexterous hand the one he strummed with. The upshot, explained busking companion Tymon Dogg, was a powerful rhythm guitar style, coupled with a 'sausage-fingered approach to lead work' (Gilbert, 19). A spell in Newport, Wales, with student friends in 1973-4 resulted in the formation of a short-lived rock and roll band, the Vultures, with Mellor on guitar and vocals. About this time he cut his long hair and cultivated a 'greaser' look, complete with mutton-chop sideburns. 
In the summer of 1974 Mellor returned to London and settled in a squat at 101 Walterton Road, West Kilburn. Several other musicians were also resident and a band was formed -- the 101ers. As a bonding exercise the group came up with new names for themselves. Mellor became Joe Strummer, the everyman troubadour -- 'six strings or none at all' (Gilbert, 68). By 1975 the 101ers were front runners in London's pub rock scene, so-called because of the venues the bands played in. With its emphasis on raw energy and classic R&B songs, pub rock was both a rejection of mid-1970s progressive rock and a precursor of the punk style that followed. Frequent live performances allowed Joe Strummer -- Mellor would answer to no other name -- to hone what became his characteristic stage gestures, most notably the pumping right leg and the finger pressed in the ear (as he mangled his lyrics almost beyond recognition). 
On 16 May 1975 Mellor married Pamela Jill Moolman, a 25-year-old South African social worker, and daughter of Peter Albertus George Moolman, a chief executive in transport. Eager to gain British citizenship, she paid him $100. He spent the money on a Telecaster guitar, which became another trademark. The 101ers went into the studio that winter, but before any records were released Strummer had left the band, breaking it up in the process. Seeing punk trailblazers the Sex Pistols in April 1976 (supporting the 101ers) changed everything. A posthumous 101ers single, 'Keys to your heart', came out later that year -- written by Strummer for his Spanish girlfriend, Paloma Romano (who went on to become the drummer for the Slits and the Raincoats under the pseudonym Palmolive) -- and was followed in 1981 by 'Elgin Avenue Breakdown', an album of studio cuts and live recordings. 
1976 was 'year zero' in punk mythology: nothing that came before was relevant. In truth, it was Strummer's performances for the 101ers that brought him to the attention of a punk band being assembled by guitarist Mick Jones. Although at twenty-four he was older than most punks, Strummer nevertheless looked and sounded the part: 'full of bad old teeth and a voice like rust on the underside of an old car' ('Elgin Avenue Breakdown' sleevenotes, 1981). He even developed a new persona to fit the scene, burying his natural gentleness beneath a yobbish facade, while his voice took on a slurred cockney inflection. After a meeting outside a dole office (punk was a direct reaction to the unemployment of the time) Strummer joined with Jones and the bassist Paul Simonon to form the Clash, a name Simonon suggested after seeing the term used repeatedly in newspaper headlines. Its semantics and onomatopoeic quality fitted perfectly with their overtly political approach, which was encouraged by manager Bernie Rhodes. 
Strummer and Jones soon became punk's legendary songwriting partnership. With Strummer mainly responsible for the words and Jones for the music, they focused on the problems of the faltering British state -- which since 1945 had promised but not delivered full employment, equality of opportunity, and 'cradle to grave' welfare -- and created songs that resonated with disaffected youth. While the Sex Pistols peddled nihilism, the Clash offered hope. Strummer's lyrics were often drawn from experience. 'White riot', the band's first single in March 1977, was based on the Notting Hill carnival riots of 1976; Strummer, who had been present, saw the actions of the riled Afro-Caribbean community as the example to follow. Given the prevalent racism of the time, an important feature of the Clash's stance, politically and musically (they pioneered the fusion of punk and reggae), was this positive response to Britain's emergent multiculturalism. The Clash's eponymous debut album, released in April 1977, was a defining statement of the punk phenomenon. 
Strummer's idealism led him to become the conscience of the band -- and not just because he was its vocalist and frontman. This entailed squaring the group's staunch, if somewhat naive, left-wing politics with the practicalities of being signed to the biggest record company of the day, CBS. The 1978 single '(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais' directly addressed this problem 'of turning rebellion into money' and was regarded by many critics as one of the Clash's finest songs, as well as being Strummer's own favourite. While royalties were still paying off a $100,000 advance, this dilemma could be held at bay, but Strummer struggled with the contradictory expectations. The band meanwhile developed a uniquely close relationship with its predominantly male audience. 
Strummer's creative peak occurred in 1979-80. After an uninspired second album, 'Give 'Em Enough Rope', released in November 1978, the band looked to broaden their musical horizons, a move signalled by the sacking of Rhodes. For Strummer, the shift was prompted by his first visit to America, where his love of blues and country resurfaced. As on previous occasions, a barometer of the change was his hairstyle -- a slicked-back 1950s-style quiff became the order of the day. When the Clash first toured the US in early 1979, the sense of liberation from the punk-obsessed British scene was almost palpable. Much to Strummer's delight, Bob Dylan, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, and Andy Warhol all saw the New York show. A second tour followed later that year and this formed the basis of Pennie Smith's photographic record, 'The Clash: Before and After' (1980), which included commentary from Strummer. 
The musical transformation was mirrored by an opening up in Joe's personal life. In late 1978 he began seeing Gabrielle (Gaby) Salter, a teenager who lived with her mother in a council flat on the World's End estate in Chelsea, and before long he moved in. It was from there that he would cycle to the Clash's Vanilla rehearsal building in Pimlico to write new material. The working day typically started with a couple of hours of musical experimentation -- soul, ska, R&B, and jazz were all dabbled with -- before band and crew went across the road to play football. Stimulated by the rivalry, more music-making would follow. Material from the Vanilla sessions formed the core of 'London Calling', a double LP released in December 1979, which was widely considered the Clash's masterpiece. (The American music magazine 'Rolling Stone' voted it the top album of the 1980s and its cover was issued as a Royal Mail postage stamp in 2010.) 
Although the band's development continued apace during 1980, again influenced by visits to America, Strummer nevertheless tried to remain true to punk's egalitarian spirit. His personal relationship with Jones suffered as a consequence (Jones had fewer qualms about being a rock star), and in January the creative friction -- which was usually characterized by silences -- escalated into a dressing room scuffle. (Despite this, Strummer helped Jones with half the songs on his girlfriend Ellen Foley's album, 'The Spirit of St Louis', which came out the following year.) Meanwhile, the band's punk past reared its head with the cinema release in March 1980 of 'Rude Boy', a docu-drama detailing the travails of a Clash roadie. Shot in 1978-9, the film contained classic footage of the band, with Strummer often bug-eyed and convulsive with energy, most notably at the huge Rock Against Racism rally in London in April 1978. 
In December 1980, the Clash released 'Sandinista!', an ambitious triple album whose musical canvas included soul, hip hop, gospel, rockabilly, reggae, and even a waltz. Strummer's lyrics ranged equally widely, albeit with a 'leitmotiv' critical of US foreign policy (Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government was at the time being assailed by American-backed guerrillas). British critics initially condemned the record as a rag-bag of styles. Strummer, who had just been turned down for a mortgage, was particularly hurt by the charge of 'bloated arrogance': having effectively waived royalties on British sales so that it could retail for the price of a single album, he felt that he could not win. However, 'Sandinista!' was later viewed more positively, not least because of its influence on such artists as the Beastie Boys (Strummer's rap on 'The Magnificent Seven' was groundbreaking for a white band) and Chuck D of Public Enemy. 
1981 was notable for two events which sowed the seeds of the Clash's demise. The first was Strummer's successful campaign to have Rhodes reappointed as manager in February. This altered the dynamic between Strummer and Jones, whose influence in the group diminished. The other event was the American media hullabaloo surrounding the band's seventeen-show residency at Bond's in New York in May-June. According to Pat Gilbert's history of the band, this transformed the Clash from being 'a cool, alternative group in the States into a million-selling act' (Gilbert, 294). Over the next two years it became ever more apparent that Strummer was unable to cope with actually making money. 
The release of the Clash's fifth album, 'Combat Rock', in May 1982 initiated the break-up of the band. With relations already strained over the making of the record, Strummer, secretly encouraged by Rhodes, went missing on the eve of a British tour, in order to drum up publicity. But what Rhodes did not anticipate was that Strummer would vanish completely, causing the cancellation of the dates. Exhausted by six years of being the Clash's frontman, he absconded to Paris, grew a beard for disguise, and took a break from everything. Upon his return a month later, he insisted that the drummer Topper Headon, a crucial element in the band since 1977, be sacked on account of his heroin addiction. (Strummer's own drug use had included amphetamines during the band's early years, but was now apparently confined to marijuana.) Grateful to have Strummer back, Jones and Simonon agreed to the dismissal, but were unhappy about Rhodes's role in the affair. Ironically it was Headon who wrote the music for 'Rock the Casbah', which became the band's first top ten hit, tellingly in America where they had become more popular than in Britain. 
Meanwhile 'Combat Rock' was acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic, its critique of imperialism -- particularly the Vietnam war -- striking a chord at the time of the Falklands conflict. When the Clash toured America that summer Strummer sported a Mohawk haircut, influenced by the Scorsese film 'Taxi Driver'. (Detractors scoffed that he was more affected by Hollywood-mediated history than the events themselves.) These dates were followed by a support slot on the Who's 'farewell' stadium rock tour. To some commentators the Clash seemed poised to replace them, a prospect that acutely worried Strummer. In September 1983, after months of fretting about becoming a 'professional rebel', he sacked Jones for 'rock star' behaviour and in so doing effectively destroyed the band. But the truth was that Strummer could not handle material success -- 'Combat Rock' had sold a million copies by 1983 -- even though it finally enabled him to secure a mortgage for a house at 37 Lancaster Road in London's Ladbroke Grove. 
For the next two years Strummer vainly tried to return to the values of the early days of punk via a new five-piece Clash line-up, and he was busy touring when his father died in February 1984. Although a rapprochement had taken place (Ronald Mellor was very proud of his son's achievements), Strummer did not fully appreciate his father's accomplishments and personality until he became a father himself. He and Gaby Salter had two daughters, Jazz ('b'. 1984) and Lola ('b'. 1986). To make matters worse, Strummer's mother was diagnosed with cancer in 1984, to which she succumbed in December 1986. With his heart clearly not in it, Strummer's new Clash released an appropriately titled album, 'Cut the Crap', in October 1985 and promptly broke up. The only thing he enjoyed from the whole experience was the band's busking tour of Britain in June 1985, which recalled his pre-101ers days. 
Strummer spent the next few years regretting his decisions. An unsuccessful attempt to persuade Jones to reform the Clash at least helped to mend fences and Strummer co-wrote songs for 'No. 10 Upping Street' (1986) by Jones's new band, Big Audio Dynamite. Film work also offered a distraction. Strummer starred in 'Straight to Hell' (1986) and 'Mystery Train' (1989), but remained realistic about his acting abilities and concentrated on film scores. His most accomplished effort was for 'Walker' in 1987; other notable contributions included 'Sid and Nancy' (1986) and 'Permanent Record' (1988). He released an underappreciated solo album, 'Earthquake Weather', in 1989 but his record label was more interested in a Clash reunion, having released 'The Story of the Clash Volume 1' the previous year. 
The early 1990s were, by Strummer's own admission, a 'dark night'. While guest slots and production work were always available (he deputized in the Pogues in 1987 and 1991), he could not release music under his own name owing to a contractual dispute with CBS. In 1991 a reissue of 'Should I stay or should I go' topped the British charts following its use in a television commercial. A year later, after one of his daughters found a syringe in a playground, Strummer moved away from London to the Hampshire village of Newton Stacey, but soon afterwards he and Gaby separated. This unhappy period ended when he met Lucinda Clare (Luce) Henderson, 'nee' Tait ('b'. 1962), daughter of the architect Gavin Nicholas Tait, and they married in London on 31 May 1995. Strummer, Luce, and Luce's daughter, Eliza ('b'. 1992), from a previous marriage, resided at Ivy Cottage in Heckfield, Hampshire, before settling at Yalway Manor in Broomfield, Somerset, in 1997. 
Revitalized by his domestic life and enthused by collaborations with Black Grape (1996) and Fat Les (1998), Strummer assembled a new band -- the Mescaleros -- and in 1999 released 'Rock Art and the X-Ray Style'. With its blend of R&B, Latino vibes, and African beats, Strummer had clearly found a new niche as an elder statesman of 'world music'. Not that senior status diminished his vitality. During tours, band mates half his age took turns to stay up with him, as he quaffed red wine until dawn (the affectionate expression for this was 'you've been Strummered'). The old hippy in him resurfaced at music festivals when he would establish his own encampment for friends and fans to meet and chat. In the late 1990s he also hosted a radio show, 'London Calling', for the BBC's World Service. Interest in the Clash continued with the release of a live album, 'From Here to Eternity', in 1999 and the airing of a documentary, 'Westway to the World', the following year. In 2001 Strummer, Jones, Simonon, and Headon received the Ivor Novello award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for the Clash's outstanding contribution to music. Strummer's renaissance continued with another album, 'Global A Go-Go', that same year. In 2002, with work in progress on a third Mescaleros record, Strummer joined up with ailing country legend Johnny Cash to record a memorable cover of Bob Marley's 'Redemption song'. 
On Sunday 22 December 2002 Strummer collapsed and died at his Somerset home. He had just taken his dogs for a walk and was sitting on the sofa in the living room. His post mortem revealed that he had suffered from an intra-mural coronary artery, a rare congenital condition whereby one of the heart's main blood vessels grows inside the muscle wall; the result was a fatal restriction of the circulation. It could have killed him much earlier. His death was a major news story across the world. The irony in this was that Strummer had remained largely unrecognized in Britain, except to a niche audience, even in the Clash's heyday. In part this was because he had never been a tabloid punk rocker like Sid Vicious, but it was also due to the Clash's refusal to appear on the main TV music show of the time, 'Top of the Pops', owing to its insistence that acts mime. The prominence given to his death was thus more a measure of his influence than a reflection of his celebrity. In the pantheon of politicized popular music, he was placed on a par with Guthrie, Dylan, Lennon, and Marley. During his public funeral service at Kensal Green cemetery on 30 December (a private ceremony took place later that day at West London crematorium) his coffin was adorned with a sticker that urged 'question authority'. While a last testament to his career was the release of the Mescaleros album 'Streetcore' in 2003, continuing tributes to his inspirational personality included the naming of a locomotive train after him in 2005 and a square in the Spanish city of Granada in 2013. A charity, Strummerville, was established the year after his death to help young artists develop and promote their music. As for his longer-term legacy, he may well be remembered as a leading advocate of multicultural society at a time when the racialism associated with Britain's imperial past was still rife.

Thackray, John Philip (1938-2002), singer and songwriter, was born on 27 February 1938 at the maternity hospital, Leeds, Yorkshire, the son of Ernest Thackray, police constable, and his wife, Ivy May, 'nee' Armitage, both of 2 Park View Terrace, Rawdon, Leeds. Educated at a Jesuit school, St Michael's College, Dolgellau, where he contemplated joining the priesthood, he then attended Durham University where he studied modern languages and trained as a teacher. He taught in France for four years, and it was there that he absorbed the chanson genre of popular music, and in particular the songs of Georges Brassens, which provided the paradigm for his own future work. Much later he persuaded Brassens to perform a concert at the university theatre in Cardiff. 'I did the first half,' he said, 'and it was the pinnacle of everything I ever achieved to be on the stage with him that night' ('The Independent'). 
Returning to teach in Leeds, Thackray began writing songs both for the classroom and for performance in local folk clubs. An appearance on an early morning farming programme on local radio led to regular features on the BBC's 'Northcountryman' radio programme, and his first television appearance in 1966, in 'The Good Old Days', broadcast from the City Palace of Varieties in Leeds. In 1967 he signed to EMI's Columbia record label and recorded his first album, 'The Last Will and Testament of Jake Thackray'. On 3 August 1968 he married Sheila Marian Clarke-Irons, a 21-year-old student, and daughter of Peter William Clarke-Irons, manager of a petrol station. They had three sons, Bill, Sam, and Tom. 
By the late 1960s Thackray was appearing regularly on national television, with residencies on BBC late night satirical programmes 'The Braden Beat', 'The David Frost Show', and 'That's Life'. These shows required a topical song a week. 'It wasn't pressure, it was work,' Thackray said later, 'and it taught me how to write quickly to a deadline. Some of the songs were duff -- absolutely bloody duff -- and I blush to think about having sung them' ('The Independent'). None the less, he made over 1000 television appearances; he also continued to combine his teaching and songwriting careers until the early 1970s. 
In 1969 Thackray released his second album, 'Jake's Progress', which again received widespread critical acclaim, and steady if unspectacular sales. He appeared at the London Palladium, and in 1971 in a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, recorded and released as 'Live Performance!' But he was becoming disenchanted with the entertainment industry, and uncertain of the validity of his work. Backstage at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, he had to be persuaded to appear by Norman Newell, who had signed him to EMI. He toured extensively abroad, and continued to work in clubs and theatres throughout the 1970s, producing 'On Again! On Again!' in 1977, 'Jake Thackray and Songs' in 1981, a live recording of a BBC2 concert, and a book of his lyrics. However, increasingly he felt that 'People come to see me because I'm on the telly. They would go and see Michael Fish the weatherman if he went on tour' ('The Independent'). His disillusionment was exacerbated by changes in the entertainment industry and society in general; his literate wit was at odds with both punk and the Thatcher years, which also affected the image of Yorkshire that had provided the sense of identity in much of his work. Folk music audiences lost interest in contemporary song, and to many his bawdy humour appeared rooted in a sexist misogyny. 
In the 1980s Thackray retired with his family to Monmouth in south Wales. 'I'd never liked the stage much,' he later said, 'and I was turning into a performing man, a real bloody Archie Rice, so I cancelled gigs and pulled out' ('The Times'). The family established a closely guarded privacy that henceforth characterized Thackray's relationship with the rest of the world. He wrote a humorous column for the 'Yorkshire Post', but generally acquired the reputation of a recluse, with stories circulating of ill-health, excessive use of alcohol, and a complete loss of faith in his work. He separated from his wife, and in 2000 was declared bankrupt. 
Although popularized through television, and covered by a variety of other artists from the Barron Knights performing the comic 'Sister Josephine' to Petula Clark duetting 'La-di-dah' with the poet Rod McKuen, Thackray's songs showed a thoroughgoing disregard for current popular music conventions of chart success. At the time of his death his work was beginning to be appreciated again for its particular attributes and manifold achievements. As a performer he presented a distinct persona, with his lugubrious expression, sardonic delivery, and nylon-strung guitar. As a writer he represented the continuation of the genre of English popular, urban song into the television age, combining elements of both the music hall and folk traditions. His writing was remarkable for its sheer wit and verbal agility, and the juxtaposition of an absurd imagination with a delight in the detail of everyday life, expressed in a musical language that translated the resources of the French chanson into English. Describing his work, he said: 'I can see that I am in the English tradition if you like, with songwriters like Flanders and Swann and Noel Coward, who are wordy, funny writers. The main difference is in my tunes, which are based on French music. I've been called 'The Yorkshire Noel Coward', but that only reflects the poverty of journalists. They do it because my songs have lots of words in them and I have a clipped, abrupt delivery. ('The Independent')' Thackray died of heart failure at his home, 75 Carbonne Close, Monmouth, on 24 December 2002. He was survived by his wife, Sheila, and their three sons.

Siepmann, Mary Aline (1912-2002), novelist, was born on 24 June 1912, at Red Gables, Englefield Green, Egham, Surrey, the younger daughter and youngest of the three children of Harold Mynors Farmar (1878-1961), an officer in the Lancashire fusiliers, and his wife, Violet Hyacinth, 'nee' Dalby (1885?-1971), youngest daughter of Sir William Bartlett Dalby, a leading aural surgeon. From an early age she was convinced that she was unwanted -- her mother had told her that she should have been a boy -- and she felt more loved by her nanny, Hilda Scott, and by Lady Dalby, her maternal grandmother. The latter had been born Hyacinthe Wellesley and was a direct descendant of Richard Wellesley, Marquess Wellesley, elder brother of the first duke of Wellington. The abrupt departure of Nanny Scott overshadowed Mary's infancy; she said that she 'never felt secure again' ('The Independent'), and she became a rebellious child who was educated at home by a succession of sixteen foreign governesses. As a result she spoke good Italian and French and some German but always had to count on her fingers. When she was aged fifteen her parents went to India with her elder sister, Susan, leaving her in a 'home school' for two years in the company of a pet bullfinch. These deficiencies in her formal education gave her a lifelong inferiority complex. From her early days she had wanted to write but for many years she destroyed everything she finished. 
After being presented at court at the age of eighteen Mary Farmar went to work as a volunteer in a London soup kitchen and became friends with left-wing contemporaries such as the barrister John Platts-Mills and the old Etonian banker and Labour borough councillor Lewis Clive; they encouraged her to enrol as an extramural student of international politics at the London School of Economics. Clive (who was killed in 1938 fighting on the Ebro with the International Brigade) fell in love and asked Mary to marry him. But she was bored by political meetings and on 23 January 1937 -- needing to get away from her parents -- she married a wealthy young peer, Charles Swinfen (Carol) Eady, second Baron Swinfen (1904-1977), barrister, who had inherited the fortune his father Charles Swinfen Eady, first Baron Swinfen, had made at the chancery bar, prior to becoming master of the rolls. For three years the new Lady Swinfen enjoyed a privileged existence, attending the coronation of King George VI, driving her husband's Lagonda, and travelling on the continent. Although, as she subsequently complained, the marriage was not notable for sexual passion, a child, Roger, was born on 14 December 1938. 
The course of Mary Eady's life changed on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 when a family friend recruited her into a section of MI5 that was engaged in breaking German military ciphers. Her prediction that Denmark was to be invaded, one day before the invasion took place, was dismissed by a superior officer as 'a lot of balls' ('Daily Telegraph'). When her unit was moved from St James's Park to Bletchley Park in September 1940, to work on Enigma decrypts, Mary, by now pregnant with her second child, resigned and went to live at Boskenna in west Cornwall, the seat of Colonel Camborne Paynter. A second son, Toby, was born on 28 February 1941. Handing over her two infants to Colonel Paynter's cook, Mary -- who was by now separated from her husband -- started to lead the uninhibited and promiscuous social life that later became the subject of 'The Camomile Lawn' (1984), one of her most successful novels. She once said 'War is very erotic, people had love affairs they would not otherwise have had' ('Toronto Globe and Mail', 9 May 1995). Colonel Paynter, who was an accomplished linguist, kept open house for pilots and other officers, including allied 'emigres' and SOE agents, and among her friends were the Gaullist intelligence chief Andre Dewavrin ('Colonel Passy'), the exiled Czech leader Jan Masaryk, and his shadow minister of finance, Heinz Ziegler, who wanted to marry her. Her frequent visits to London and the Ritz Hotel during the blitz and the V1 and V2 attacks of 1944 and 1945 gave her material that she would later use in her fiction, and she remained in contact with intelligence colleagues throughout the war. 
In 1945 Carol Eady divorced his wife on grounds of desertion. This divorce, during which Mary's brother Hugh Farmar appeared as a witness against her and Lord Swinfen was awarded custody of their two children, caused a rift between Mary and her family that never properly healed. Shortly afterwards she started to live with a married lover, the journalist and playwright Eric Otto Siepmann (1903-1970), youngest son of the celebrated Clifton schoolmaster Otto Siepmann. In 1949, Eric Siepmann was offered the post of Berlin correspondent by Ian Fleming, foreign manager of the 'Sunday Times', and Mary, who had by then changed her name by deed poll to Siepmann, accompanied him. But the job did not last and their life together was overshadowed by the hostility of Siepmann's second wife, Phyllis, a champion ski-racer and bluestocking, who hounded them wherever they went. Siepmann eventually obtained a divorce on grounds of cruelty and he and Mary married on 23 April 1952. Their only child, William, was born on 8 December 1953. 
Eric Siepmann was 'a drunk, but not an alcoholic' according to his wife (private information), and in 1954, following an indiscretion at a diplomatic reception in Damascus, he lost another job, so he and Mary went to live in a remote farmhouse at Thornworthy on Dartmoor, determined to make their fortune from literature. At this time, their circle of friends included Nancy Mitford, Graham Greene, Malcolm Muggeridge, Patrick Kinross, and the Catholic novelists Antonia White and Emily Holmes Coleman. Antonia White acted as godmother when Mary and Eric were received into the Roman Catholic church in 1956. Despite Siepmann's intellectual brilliance, his writing remained unpublished and Mary started to teach English to visiting pupils from France and Germany. On 10 January 1970 Siepmann, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died, leaving his widow and their sixteen-year-old son with no pension or other means of support. She said that when he died 'I felt as though I had been cut in half' ('Image Magazine', April 1990). To make ends meet she took a job as a French teacher in a preparatory school but lost it when the headmaster discovered that she had never sat an exam in her life. Subsequently she minded an antique shop for friends and sold her knitting. During the early years of her widowhood, her life was complicated by poverty and a family feud over an inheritance that eventually led to the permanent estrangement of her eldest son. In later life she cared for her own nanny and her children's nanny, both of whom lived to be 100, while cheerfully admitting that she had grown to loathe her mother. 
Shortly before Siepmann's death Mary had written two children's books, 'Speaking Terms' and 'The Sixth Seal', both of which were published under the pseudonym Mary Wesley in 1969, to no great effect. But this slight success gave her the confidence she required to continue. It was in these extreme circumstances that she started a novel about a widow who had decided to 'jump the queue' (commit suicide). When it was finished she sent 'Jumping the Queue' to seven publishers. It was repeatedly rejected until James Hale at Macmillan saw the possibilities and published it in 1983. By that time Mary had been forced to sell her cottage on Dartmoor because she could no longer afford to repair her car and had moved into a small terrace house in Totnes, her nearest market town. Over the next fifteen years, displaying extraordinary energy and concentration, Mary Wesley became one of the most successful novelists in the country. She published nine more titles that sold over three million copies and won her six-figure advances. Her consistent themes came from her own experience of war and families at war. In 'The Camomile Lawn' (1984) she set out to establish an uncomfortable truth that for many survivors the blitz had been a form of liberation. She returned to the wartime setting in 'Not That Sort of Girl' (1987), 'A Sensible Life' (1990), and 'Part of the Furniture' (1997). In her third novel, 'Harnessing Peacocks' (1985), she introduced another recurrent theme, dysfunctional family life, the violence that can lie beneath its surface, and the effect this has on young women struggling to achieve their independence. All ten of her books were notable for the sexual energy displayed by her heroines, both young and old, and marked by a black humour that recalled Saki or the early Evelyn Waugh and was most apparent in 'A Dubious Legacy' (1992). 
Mary Wesley proved to be adept at publicizing her own work on the radio and in press interviews, quickly mastering the effective contrast between her cut-glass manners and her loathing of the Conservative prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Her feelings towards Thatcherism were influenced by the misadventures of her youngest son, who spent a period of his life in a London squat prior to retraining as a tube train driver, and she carried a printed card in her handbag (inspired by the organ donor card) called the Thatchcard which read, 'Under no circumstances whatsoever do I wish to be visited in hospital by Margaret Thatcher' (Mary Wesley collection, Boston, box 7, fol. 1). In interviews she became a mistress of devastating one-liners, 'Fuck is an old English word' ('Daily Telegraph'); 'I love my children... I'm delighted to see them and delighted to see them go' ('Sunday Times', 25 Sept 1988); 'I have never been to bed with anyone I didn't love -- or at least find attractive' ('Daily Mail', 8 May 1993). 
With Wesley's huge popular success came critical acclaim. Her work was compared with that of Elizabeth Bowen and Muriel Spark; she was praised in the 'Times Literary Supplement' in 1992 for creating 'a black comedy of English manners', for her ability to rework the classic themes of the fairy tale such as the evil parent and the abandoned heroine, for her perceptiveness about girlhood, and for the images of childhood joy and misery that were never marred by sentimentality about relationships between parents and children. She was made an honorary fellow of the London School of Economics (1994), appointed CBE (1995), and elected FRSL (1997). As she became richer she gave much of her wealth away to friends or strangers, saying that she could never forget the days when she had been too poor to buy a postage stamp. She died of cancer at her home, Bogan Cottage, North Street, Totnes, on 30 December 2002, 'in her own bed', as her death notice put it. On 3 January 2003, following a Roman Catholic funeral held in the Anglican Church of St Mary and introduced by a recording of the dawn chorus, she was buried in a red Chinese lacquer coffin that had once served as her coffee table, beside her second husband, in the graveyard of Buckfast Abbey. She was survived by her three sons.

Allan, Sir Anthony James Allan Havelock-, fourth baronet (1904-2003), film producer, was born on 28 February 1904 at Blackwell Manor, Blackwell, Darlington, co. Durham, the third son of Allan Havelock-Allan (1874-1949), army officer and landowner, and his first wife, Anne Julia, 'nee' Chaytor (died 1953), daughter of Sir William Chaytor, third baronet. The Havelock-Allan family bore a distinguished tradition in the army and Liberal politics. His great-grandfather, Sir Henry Havelock, who led the relief of Cawnpore and Lucknow during the Indian mutiny of 1857, died before being made (as intended) a baronet; the honour then fell on his son (Havelock-Allan's grandfather), Sir Henry Marshman Havelock ['see under 'Allan, Sir Henry Marshman Havelock-], who had already been awarded a VC for his role in the mutiny, and who later served as MP for Sunderland and then South-East Durham, and in 1880 changed his surname to Havelock-Allan, under the terms of the will of his cousin, Robert Henry Allan, of Blackwell Grange. Havelock-Allan's uncle, Sir Henry Spencer Moreton Havelock-Allan, second baronet, was Liberal MP for Bishop Auckland from 1910 to 1918. 
Havelock-Allan was educated at Mr Gibbs's School in Sloane Street, North Hall preparatory school in Hertfordshire, Charterhouse, and in Switzerland. He was expected to follow family tradition and enter the army, but his eldest brother, Henry, had remained in the Scots Guards after the war (the second brother, Clervaux, died an infant), and Havelock-Allan decided that relieved him of the responsibility and pursued his own inclinations. He worked initially at Garrards, the crown jewellers, and later in the gramophone business, first at Brunswick in London and then in 1927-8 for Vox AG, Berlin. He returned to London as a stockbroker, worked on the classified advertising section of the 'Evening Standard', and for a time booked the acts for Ciro's cabaret club. 
Havelock-Allan had developed a passion for the theatre at an early age, was briefly involved in amateur dramatics, and was happy working in the entertainment business. He therefore enthusiastically accepted the offer of his friend Richard Norton in 1933 to become a casting director at the British and Dominions Film Corporation, working mainly on the low-budget films of Jack Raymond. In 1935 he took over production of 'Quota Quickies' made at the company. These were financed by Paramount and produced at low cost to enable the American company to distribute its own films in Britain in accordance with the 'Cinematograph Films Act' of 1927. Havelock-Allan produced over thirty of these in three years, and though the form was generally maligned as shoddy, such productions were an invaluable training ground for new and inexperienced talent. It was in his character to make the films as well as finances allowed, and he later claimed that they produced an overall profit and solicited better reviews in the trade press than the company's earlier efforts. In films such as 'Gentlemen's Agreement' (1935), 'The Scarab Murder Case' (1936), 'Missing, Believed Married' (1937), and 'Lancashire Luck' (1937) he cast aspiring actors of the calibre of Vivien Leigh, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Margaret Rutherford, and Wendy Hiller, and he later recalled this hectic period as the most enjoyable of his professional life. 
In 1936 Elstree Studios burned down and British and Dominions moved its productions to the newly built Pinewood Studios. Havelock-Allan joined a new company there, Pinebrook, which had been established to keep the studios busy and staff employed -- producing modest films at times when the studio was underemployed. He produced six films there up to 1940; the first, 'This Man is News' (1938), modelled on fast-moving Hollywood-style crime films such as 'The Thin Man' series, was produced for $14,000 and made ten times that amount at the box office. It featured Barry K. Barnes as a reporter who becomes embroiled in a murder mystery, and also, in a supporting role, the young actress (Babette Louisa) Valerie Hobson (1917-1998). It was Havelock-Allan's first substantial commercial and critical success and spawned a sequel in 'This Man in Paris' (1939). Havelock-Allan and Hobson married on 12 April 1939, and had two children, Simon (1944-1991) and Mark ('b'. 1951). Simon suffered from Down's syndrome. 
During the Second World War, Havelock-Allan contributed the production 'From the Four Corners' (1941), a propaganda short for the Ministry of Information which he also directed. As Pinewood had been requisitioned by the government he joined Two Cities Films, a production company formed in 1937 by a flamboyant Italian lawyer, Filippo del Giudice. Havelock-Allan's first production was 'Unpublished Story' (1942), a routine wartime thriller, starring Richard Greene and Valerie Hobson, about journalists uncovering fifth columnists. His next film was of much greater importance. Del Giudice wanted to finance a big, patriotic picture, and Havelock-Allan through his social connections introduced him to Noel Coward, who responded with the idea about a naval film based on the recent exploits of his friend Lord Louis Mountbatten on HMS 'Kelly'. 'In Which We Serve' (1942), on which Coward was unfairly granted producer credit and Havelock-Allan was named associate producer, was one of the most successful and admired British films of the war, a substantial commercial and propaganda success in America and the film that brought together the acclaimed production team of Havelock-Allan, David Lean, and Ronald Neame. Lean, one of the most brilliant editors in British cinema, was thought necessary to help Coward, the nominal director, on technical matters and gained co-director credit, and Coward suggested Neame as cameraman. 
Three further adaptations of the playwright followed. Coward produced in Technicolor for Two Cities both 'This Happy Breed' (1944) and the less successful 'Blithe Spirit' (1945). Havelock-Allan contributed to the scripts and acted as executive in overall control of the productions. The latter film was co-produced by Cineguild, a new production company formed by Havelock-Allan, Lean, and Neame, with production finance and distribution through the Rank Organization. This type of arrangement provided considerable creative freedom and was central to the artistic success of British cinema in this period, supporting other successful independent producers such as Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The professional relationship with Coward ended with a modest black and white melodrama, 'Brief Encounter' (1945), produced by Cineguild. Havelock-Allan's favourite among his productions, it was a major critical and commercial success and remains one of the most loved of all British films. 
After four Coward pictures, the Cineguild partners felt it was time to do something different and opted for Lean's ambition to film 'Great Expectations' (1946). Havelock-Allan contributed to the script and acted as executive producer, with main responsibility for the finances and budget. The film was another triumph and was considered by many critics the definitive film adaptation of Dickens. The costume films made at Gainsborough were wildly popular in the 1940s, and it was Havelock-Allan's idea to produce a historical melodrama next, but with a greater fidelity to history. 'Blanche Fury' (1948) was a problematic production with an unhappy male lead in Stewart Granger and a French director, Marc Allegret, with marital problems. While the film looked splendid -- a trademark of Cineguild productions -- it was harsh, featured unpleasant characters, and offered little opportunity for audience identification. The title character was played by Valerie Hobson, who had featured in 'Great Expectations' and also starred in the lesser Cineguild productions, 'The Small Voice' (1948) and 'The Interrupted Journey' (1949). By this time Havelock-Allan was drifting away from the company, and he worked uncredited on 'Oliver Twist' (1948), an adaptation that failed to reach the critical heights of 'Great Expectations' and drew some censorship difficulties in America. 
In 1948 Havelock-Allan formed his own company, Constellation Films, but completed only a handful of productions through the 1950s. These included a charming Italian co-production released in England as 'Never Take No for an Answer' (1951), which reputedly was the first commercial film to receive permission to shoot in the Vatican, and two films with director Anthony Asquith, 'The Young Lovers' (1954) and 'Orders to Kill' (1958). Havelock-Allan had known Asquith, the son of the former Liberal prime minister, at Mr Gibbs's School. In the late 1950s he became convinced of the future of pay television and formed British Home Entertainment with Lord Brabourne and Daniel Angel. The emphasis was on quality productions for a discerning audience, such as 'An Evening with the Royal Ballet' (1963), co-directed by Havelock-Allan and Asquith, and featuring principal dancers Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. Some productions were also released into cinemas, such as the film record of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre production of 'Othello' (1965), and Franco Zeffirelli's 'Romeo and Juliet' (1968), a worldwide smash hit, which perfectly accorded with the youthful 'Zeitgeist' of the time and provided Havelock-Allan with an Oscar nomination for best picture. Ultimately, the government could not be persuaded of the necessity of pay television and as the company was not granted the necessary licences it was sold in 1969. Havelock-Allan's final production reunited him with David Lean on the ill-fated 'Ryan's Daughter' (1970). The family motto of 'Fortiter gerit crucem' ('He bears the cross bravely') was an apt description of the producer's troubles on an unhappy shoot that went over budget after bad weather and long production delays. When it was eventually released it was mauled by the critics, but later won over a considerable audience. 
Havelock-Allan made innumerable contributions to the film industry's professional bodies, which included serving as chairman of the British Film Academy (1952) and chairman of the Society of Film and Television Arts (1962-3). In retirement he continued to take an interest in the film industry, and his advice was often sought. He became the fourth baronet on the death of his unmarried brother Henry in 1975 (their uncle having also died childless, despite three marriages). His first marriage, to Valerie Hobson, had ended in 1952 (she subsequently married the politician John Profumo). On 26 June 1979 he married Maria Theresa Consuela (Sara) Ruiz de Villafranca, daughter of Carlos Ruiz de Villafranca, the former Spanish ambassador to Chile and Brazil. 
It is often difficult to discern the specific contribution a producer makes to a film. However, it is generally acknowledged that Havelock-Allan was a producer of taste and distinction, and in the period with Two Cities and Cineguild he was pivotal in producing some of the most accomplished films in a period of outstanding achievement. These films were characterized by superb scripts, immaculate casting, and the highest production values. Havelock-Allan was a 'creative' producer, suggesting ideas, shooting some scenes, contributing to scripts, and recruiting the ideal artists and technicians. He received Oscar nominations for his work on the scripts of 'Brief Encounter' and 'Great Expectations' as well as for producing 'Romeo and Juliet'. A 'thoughtful man, conscientious and indeed fastidious in the things he undertakes' ('Kinematograph Weekly', 8 April 1948), he was widely liked and admired and always ready to help researchers, historians, and programme makers. He died of bronchopneumonia at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, Westminster, on 11 January 2003, and was survived by his wife, Sara, and son Mark, who succeeded him as fifth baronet. At the time of his death he had been working on his autobiography.

Broom, Sir Ivor Gordon (1920-2003), air force officer, was born on 2 June 1920 at 41 Lansdowne Road, Cardiff, the only child of Alfred Godfrey Broom, district manager for the Prudential Assurance Company and a Baptist preacher, and his wife, Janet Rodger, 'nee' Watson. He was educated at west Monmouth grammar school and Pontypridd county school, and successfully passed the civil service examination. On leaving school, aged seventeen, he worked as an Inland Revenue tax officer, first in Banbury and then in Ipswich. A position in the civil service was, at that time, considered a 'job for life', but six months after the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 Broom made what was to prove a permanent career move, by enlisting in the Royal Air Force. 
Following flying training at RAF Cranfield during the height of the battle of Britain, Broom was posted to 114 squadron in 1941. 114 squadron was equipped with Blenheim twin-engine bombers. Blenheims were an unpopular aeroplane among aircrews, on account of their high loss rate. However, the ever optimistic Broom was unperturbed. He flew with the squadron on daylight raids over the channel and French and Dutch coasts. His leadership ability was quickly noted and in the late summer of 1941 he led a detachment of Blenheims to Malta. There he and his crew were 'hijacked' by Air Vice-Marshal Hugh Pughe Lloyd to reinforce the beleaguered 107 squadron, which had suffered a phenomenally high number of losses. Broom was immediately launched into maritime strike operations, and confirmed Lloyd's faith in his skill. Lloyd made Broom a pilot officer, telling him to move his stuff into the officers' mess and the paper work would be sorted later. Broom's leadership and courage in Malta were recognized with the award of the DFC in January 1942. 
Broom returned to Britain in February 1942 and was 'rested' from operational flying by undertaking a tour as an instructor on Mosquitoes. It was at 1655 Mosquito training unit that he met the navigator Flight Lieutenant Tommy Broom, with whom he established a successful partnership, becoming known as the Flying Brooms. (They had an emblem of crossed broomsticks painted on the nose of their aircraft.) They were soon posted to 517 squadron, where Ivor was awarded a bar to his DFC and Tommy a DFC for their successful mine-laying operation over the Dortmund-Ems canal on the night of 9-10 August 1944. By now a wing commander, Broom saw out the Second World War in Europe in command of 163 squadron, although not before his characteristic determination saw him awarded a second bar to his DFC for bombing a railway tunnel near Kaiserslautern, Germany, in January 1945 with 128 squadron. He had meanwhile, on 25 July 1942, married Jessie Irene (Jess) Cooper, a nineteen-year-old shop assistant from Ipswich, and daughter of William Joseph Cooper, merchant. They had two sons and a daughter. 
Broom's first post-war posting to 28 squadron in Singapore was something of a surprise -- the squadron was equipped with Spitfires, an aircraft that he had never flown before but quickly set about mastering. He returned from Singapore in 1948 and attended staff college. On passing out he re-formed 57 squadron, equipped with English Electric Canberra jet bombers. Following a tour of the Middle East with 57 squadron he worked for a period at the Air Ministry and then for two years at the RAF Flying College, Manby. At Manby he became involved in what was to be one of his career highlights, piloting a Canberra, 'Aries IV', non-stop from Ottawa to London on 28 June 1955. At an average speed of 496.8 m.p.h. the flight set a new transatlantic air speed record, for which Broom was awarded an Air Force Cross in 1956. 
In 1956 Broom took charge of the Bomber Command development unit at RAF Wittering, a job that he regarded as one of his most fulfilling. This was followed by further desk appointments at the Air Ministry until October 1962, when he was appointed station commander at RAF Bruggen, Germany. Back home after two years he once again found himself working at the Air Ministry, as director of organization (establishments), and received promotion to air commodore. The latter years of his RAF career saw two prestigious appointments, first as commandant of Central Flying School (1968-70), where he suffered a serious flying accident while piloting one of the Red Arrows' Gnat aircraft, and second as air officer commanding 11 (fighter) group, Strike Command, which saw him qualify as a pilot on Lightning and Phantom aircraft. His final RAF appointments were as deputy controller (1972-4) then controller (1974-7) of National Air Traffic Services, the latter appointment carrying with it membership of the board of the Civil Aviation Authority. He was appointed CBE in 1969, CB in 1972, and KCB in 1975. 
Broom retired from the RAF in 1977, with the rank of air marshal. In retirement he was as active as ever, becoming a popular and enthusiastic supporter of many veterans' associations, including the RAF Association (of which he was vice-president from 1981), the Pathfinder Association (of which he was president in 1990-93), and the Blenheim Society (of which he was president from 1990). He also worked part-time as an international aerospace consultant, and was chairman of Gatwick Handling Ltd (1982-93) and Farnborough Aerospace Development Corporation (1985-92). A keen golfer, he was president of Moor Park Golf Club (1992-7). Described by his 'Times' obituarist as 'a great RAF party man' ('The Times', 29 Jan 2003), he was also a committed Christian and teetotaller, noted for his wit and good humour. He died of prostate cancer at the Peace Hospice, Watford, Hertfordshire, near his home in Loudwater, Rickmansworth, on 24 January 2003. He was survived by his wife and their three children.

Brunner, (Dorothea) Elizabeth, Lady Brunner (1904-2003), voluntary worker, was born on 14 April 1904 at 1 Upper Woburn Place, London, the daughter of Henry Brodribb Irving (1870-1919), actor-manager, and his wife, Dorothea Forster, 'nee' Baird (1873-1933), the actress who created the part of Trilby in George Du Maurier's play of that name (1895) and later that of Mrs Darling in 'Peter Pan' (1904). Her paternal grandfather was Sir Henry Irving, the famous actor-manager. She made her own stage debut at the age of twelve, in 'The Bells' (in which her father had a leading role), and many years later wrote a memoir, 'Child of the Theatre' (published posthumously in 2010). She told the story of how much she enjoyed dressing up for the lord mayor's ball: 'My final outfit, and the best of all, was Brunhilde. Again the string and knitting needles provided my splendid armour, a Wagnerian crown adorned my head and lengths of chiffon draped my armour. I remember (as Brunhilde) falling dreadfully in love with a medieval knight. ('Child of the Theatre', 25-6)' Elizabeth Irving was educated at home and then at South Hampstead high school, London, Oxford high school, and Wycombe Abbey. She left at sixteen to train as an actress in Oxford (under Rosina Filippi) and in London (under Komisarjevsky), and was herself a gifted actress. In the early 1920s she acted in both classical plays, including as Titania in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', and in the silent film of Charlotte Bronte's novel 'Shirley' (1922). On 8 July 1926 she married Felix John Morgan Brunner (1897-1982), businessman, son of Sir John Fowler Brunner, second baronet, and grandson of Sir John Tomlinson Brunner, first baronet, the co-founder of Brunner Mond, which became part of Imperial Chemical Industries in 1926. Her husband (who inherited the baronetcy in 1929) was a director of Brunner Mond and subsequently chairman of the Brunner Investment Trust until 1972. He was also active in Liberal politics, and served as president of the Liberal Party in 1962-3. His family was of Swiss descent, and he and his young wife spent their honeymoon in Switzerland and walked extensively in the mountains of the Valais; they returned regularly to that area. They lived in London until 1937 and had five sons between 1927 and 1935. In 1937 they bought Greys Court near Henley-on-Thames. 
While bringing up her family in the beautiful surroundings of Greys Court, Elizabeth Brunner over the years created a lovely garden among the ancient buildings. She also became increasingly involved in local life and especially in her local Women's Institute (WI). She was soon elected local president and in 1944 was elected a member of the national federation. In 1945 she proposed the successful resolution at the annual general meeting 'That this meeting welcomes the suggestion of a Women's Institute College... and instructs the Executive Committee to make the necessary arrangements' ('The Independent'). She subsequently became a member of the subcommittee set up to explore the idea further. It was realized in 1948 with the foundation of Denman College, Marcham. According to the historian of Denman College 'It was largely due to [Elizabeth Brunner's] drive and determination to overcome all obstacles that the idea became reality' ('The Times'). She served as an energetic chairman of the National Federation of Women's Institutes from 1951 to 1956, and remained active in the WI both locally and nationally thereafter. She never forgot that the WI itself (and Denman College in particular) was committed to providing opportunities for adult education for women, not at that time readily available in rural areas. 
The need to act and campaign both locally and nationally on litter and waste was a major concern by the 1950s. In 1955 the Keep Britain Tidy group was formed as a result of a resolution passed at the Women's Institutes' AGM the previous year, under the presidency of Elizabeth Brunner. She was the founding chairman of the new group in 1955-6, remained president for many years, and was senior vice-president until the end of her life. For this work she was appointed OBE in 1964. She was also a JP for a great many years, chairman of the Women's Group on Public Welfare for ten years from 1960, and chairman of the Henley and District Housing Trust. From 1968 to 1971 she was a member of the general advisory council of the BBC. 
In 1969 Greys Court was given by the Brunners to the National Trust, but Elizabeth and her husband continued to live there until their deaths. She would welcome members of the public as they went through the ground floor, including the large kitchen where she was often to be seen enjoying preparing food for her friends and guests. She had much admiration for Richard Wheeler of the National Trust, describing herself as 'much fortified by his presence' (private information). Her religious faith and her friendship with Archbishop Robert Runcie enabled her to go joyfully into old age. She subsequently added the Maze of Life to the Greys Court garden. Her husband (who had suffered much as a result of his experiences as an artillery officer in the First World War) died in 1982. 
Elizabeth Brunner had a great sense of humour, and to be with her was always fun. She was also an excellent and prolific letter writer. Strangely (perhaps deliberately, perhaps not) she never included in the dates of her letters the year in which she was writing. This was even so in 1995 in letters describing the accident that befell her in St Luc, Switzerland, when she was badly injured, and as a result of which she suffered great pain. Few of her friends thought that she would ever return to Switzerland, but the next year she was back, to be received by the mayor with a speech of welcome and to the sound of fifes and drums. She returned every year until she was ninety-seven. She died at Greys Court on 9 January 2003, of heart failure, and was survived by three of her five sons. At her memorial service on 12 April her granddaughter, Isabel, gave an address in which she stressed her grandmother's 'readiness to talk about love', and her perhaps unusual grandmotherly advice that 'the way in love wasn't a kind of proper good sense but an instinctive feel for whether or not it was nice or not to be kissed by a certain person in a taxi' (private information). She was widely loved and much admired.

Alwyn, William (1905-1985), composer, was born William Alwyn Smith on 7 November 1905 at 54 Kettering Road, Northampton, the son of William James Smith and his wife, Ada Tyler Tompkins. Northampton was also the birthplace of the composers Edmund Rubbra and Malcolm Arnold. Though he was of humble background -- his father was a grocer -- Alwyn's gifts were apparent in childhood, when the gift of a piccolo at the age of nine launched him on the path to music. He attended Northampton grammar school, and by fifteen he had become a pupil at the Royal Academy of Music in London, studying composition as well as the flute and piccolo. A financial crisis on the death of his father two years later meant that Alwyn had to pay his own way by playing in cinema pit ensembles and giving elementary piano lessons in the impoverished East End of London. 
Success was not long in coming, however. Alwyn was invited back to the Royal Academy to teach composition, and also became principal flautist of the London Symphony Orchestra. On 1 January 1929 he married Olive Mary Audrey, daughter of William Joseph Pull; they had two sons. As a composer he achieved an early breakthrough with the first performance, at the 1927 Promenade Concerts, of his 'Five Preludes for Orchestra'. From the mid-1930s onwards he composed over 200 scores for films of various kinds: short documentary features were his initial terrain, but he later turned to feature films, and among his sixty or more in this genre scores such as those for 'Odd Man Out' (1946), 'The Fallen Idol' (1948), 'The History of Mr. Polly' (1949), and the Disney version of 'Swiss Family Robinson' (1960) all became classics of their kind. The composer once commented that he found film work a huge stimulus: it gave him the opportunity to experiment, to work with orchestras, and to confront in music a wide range of emotional scenarios. 
During the Second World War these skills were put to good use in composing music for a string of propaganda films for the ministry of information and the army film unit. These included 'Desert Victory', 'Fires were Started', and 'World of Plenty', all made in 1943. Alwyn played the flute many times in the series of wartime concerts mounted at the National Gallery by Dame Myra Hess, and was also active as an air-raid warden. Though he continued to write film music until the early 1960s, he always refused the temptation to emigrate to Hollywood, a possibility that was regularly on offer. 
Sensibly, Alwyn delayed embarking on a symphonic career until he was in his forties and ready for such a step. He then began what was always conceived as a cycle of four symphonies, a tetralogy with symphonic features in itself, such as a lighter-veined scherzo or an energetic finale. Sir John Barbirolli conducted the first symphony (1949) and encouraged him to continue in this vein. The birth of the third symphony (1955-6) was scrupulously recorded in a compositional diary which Alwyn later allowed to appear (in the 'Adam International Review' for 1968) under the title 'Ariel to Miranda'. The 1950s were an immensely productive decade for Alwyn, in which he wrote music in a wide variety of orchestral and chamber forms. Some of his most immediately attractive music came in his concertos, such as 'Autumn Legend' (1955), which was inspired by the paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites and features a solo cor anglais; and also in 'Lyra angelica' (1954), where the harp is the solo instrument, evoking a vision of heaven. 
By now Alwyn was regularly writing songs, occasionally using his own texts for the purpose, though he also set such writers as William Blake and Louis MacNeice; and in later years he was close to the poet Michael Armstrong, whose evocations of the night strongly appealed to him. Mention should also be made of Alwyn's work on behalf of his fellow composers. He campaigned for composers' rights as an active member of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain, the Performing Right Society, the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society, and the Society for the Promotion of New Music. He was appointed CBE in 1978. 
Alwyn may have thought that with his fourth symphony he had written the last of his 'dramas of contrast and emotion'. There was to be an epilogue, though. In 1973, still adhering to this rubric, he added a comparatively short but powerful single-movement work, giving it the subtitle 'Hydriotaphia'. This was a reference to the famous work of the seventeenth-century English religious writer Sir Thomas Browne. 
The fifth symphony embraced the elegiac note that increasingly surfaces in the music of Alwyn's later years and that was an integral part of his aesthetic of modern Romanticism. He once identified Dante Gabriel Rossetti as an important model for him, while he claimed to have learned formal musical freedom from early exposure to the example of Liszt's 'Faust' symphony. The last twenty-five years of Alwyn's life were spent in Suffolk, at Blythburgh, within sight of the sea. His amanuensis and literary secretary from 1961 was Doreen Mary Carwithen ['see below'], whom he had taught composition at the Royal Academy of Music. She had changed her surname to Alwyn by deed poll by the time they married, on 19 April 1975. At Blythburgh he not only composed two operas to his own librettos, 'Juan, or, The libertine', and 'Miss Julie', based on Strindberg's play, but also found time to paint, to translate modern French poetry, and to dabble in autobiography ('Winged Chariot', which was privately published in 1983). 
In 1981 Alwyn was severely ill after a stroke, which made him unable to compose for two years. He died at the Southwold and District Hospital, Southwold, Suffolk, on 11 September 1985, just short of his eightieth birthday. The third quartet, which he wrote in the year before his death, demonstrated undiminished powers and is one of the works within a very large corpus that is destined to be remembered. 
Alwyn's second wife, Doreen Mary Carwithen (1922-2003), composer, was born on 15 November 1922 at High Street, Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, the daughter of Reginald Arthur Lewis Carwithen, insurance clerk, and his wife, Dulcie Doreen, 'nee' Clarke, music teacher. She was four when she first began playing the piano and violin. She subsequently played cello in local orchestras. In 1941 she obtained a county scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, and during the war she played in ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association) concerts. Her earliest composition, at the age of sixteen, was a setting of Wordsworth's 'Daffodils' for voice and piano. In 1947 her overture 'ODTAA' ('One Damn Thing After Another'), written two years previously, was selected by the music advisory committee of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and given its premiere at Covent Garden, conducted by Sir Adrian Boult. In the same year Carwithen joined J. Arthur Rank, and over the next fifteen years wrote the scores of some thirty-five films, including 'Harvest from the Wilderness' (1948) and 'Break in the Circle' (1955). She also wrote the music for 'Elizabeth is Queen' (1953), the official film of the coronation. Meanwhile her second quartet won a Cobbett award in 1952, and her concerto for piano and strings was premiered at the Henry Wood Prom Concerts in London. She composed little after setting up house with Alwyn in Blythburgh, and became known as Mary Alwyn. Following her husband's death she established the William Alwyn Foundation to promote his works. She also began work on new compositions of her own, including a third quartet. A severe stroke in 1999 left her paralysed down one side. She died at Austhorpe House Nursing Home, Forncett St Peter, Norfolk, on 5 January 2003. She had no children.

Cookson, William George (1939-2003), editor and poet, was born on 8 May 1939 at King's College Hospital, London, the only child of George Heinrich Frederick Cookson (died 1949), an inspector of schools who had published several books of verse and in 1936 had founded the magazine 'English', and his wife, Rachel Vera, formerly Barry, 'nee' Pelham-Burn, who had trained as a concert pianist. His parents then lived at 8 Cranbourne Court, Albert Bridge Road, Battersea, London. His father was getting on in years when Cookson was born (he died when Cookson was ten), but his retirement allowed the family to live first at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, and then at Elstead, Surrey, where Cookson remembered his father as instilling in him a deep love of nature and of literature. When his father died Cookson and his mother moved back to Cranbourne Court, where they lived at number 5. Cookson continued to live there for the rest of his life. 
Cookson was educated at The Hall preparatory school, Hampstead, and (as a day boy) at Westminster School, where he proved himself an ardent reader and an able oarsman, and with his friends Edmund Gray and Howard Burns helped to revive the school magazine, 'The Trifler', to which he contributed fragmentary poems in the manner of David Jones and Ezra Pound. He also joined the London committee working to free Pound from St Elizabeth's Hospital for the Insane in Washington, and made friends with the poetry editor of 'Nine' magazine, Peter Russell. It was Russell who introduced Cookson to Czeslaw and Krystyna Bednarczyk, the Polish printers who later produced 'Agenda' from their Poets' and Painters' Press under the railway arches close to the Festival Hall. 
By the age of seventeen Cookson was reviewing modern poetry regularly for 'Time and Tide' magazine and corresponding with Pound in America. It was on the basis of this friendship that he visited Pound on his release in May 1958, at Brunnenburg Castle in the Italian Tyrol. In 'Agenda: an Anthology' (1994) he explained how the magazine, first published in 1959, grew from this visit, and how the shape of its first few issues owed something to Pound's 'Four Pages' and to Pound's biographer, Noel Stock, in 'Edge'. The magazine from the beginning had a propagandist aim. Pound wrote the first editorial, with Cookson introducing readers to the best work of David Jones and Hugh MacDiarmid, and Peter Russell introducing the poetry of Osip Mandelstam. 
In 1960 Cookson went up to New College, Oxford, to read English under John Bayley, taking 'Agenda' with him. It was while at Oxford that he published Alan Neame's memorable translation of Jean Cocteau's long poem, 'Leone', moving the magazine away from its short format to its more characteristic book length. Also at Oxford he met the poet Peter Dale who helped him widen his editorial horizons by including discussions on the craft of poetry. Special issues of the magazine began to appear dedicated to what at the time were neglected writers of the past (figures such as Wyndham Lewis and H. D. [Hilda Doolittle]) and important themes such as rhyme, rhythm, and verse drama, as well as poetry in translation. Agenda Editions also occasionally brought out books of poetry, among which Cookson was proudest of Peter Dale's sonnet sequence, 'One Another', and the reprint of Laurence Binyon's translation of Dante's 'Divine Comedy'. 
Once Cookson had returned to London carrying his third-class degree (he had only studied the Old English part of the syllabus), he soon found funding from the Arts Council for 'Agenda'. When the Arts Council withdrew its funding after twenty-seven years the magazine continued with generous support from T. S. Eliot's widow, Valerie, and J. Paul Getty, among others. Cookson's gift as an editor lay in being a patient reader. The poet Kathleen Raine said he was the finest and closest reader of poems she had known. His own credo as an editor was that 'A great poem must remain a mystery. In every age, it is a rare event... lasting poetry remains timeless and is therefore always contemporary -- it does not date, like the ephemera. One of the aims of 'Agenda' should be to take a stand against the trivia, cleverness, dull predictability -- emotion without intellect, fancy without imagination -- that pervades much widely praised and award-winning, current poetry, both here and in the USA. ('Agenda: an Anthology', xxv-xxvi)' His successor as editor of 'Agenda', Patricia McCarthy, said of Cookson's approach to poetry that he loved 'transcendence over the mundane and popular polemic' (McCarthy, 7). On all matters he was a man of rare generosity and spirit. He was particularly interested in the influence of other cultures on English poetry, and brought out issues on poetry from many foreign countries and regions. Over the years sections of Pound's developing 'Cantos' appeared in the magazine, along with the work of a majority of the leading poets of the latter half of the twentieth century: Theodore Roethke, Louis Zukosfsky, Basil Bunting, David Gascoyne, Tom Scott, Robert Lowell, William Carlos Williams, Charles Tomlinson, Ian Hamilton, Geoffrey Hill, Seamus Heaney, W. D. Snodgrass, Thom Gunn, Derek Walcott, Eugenio Montale, and Giuseppe Ungaretti. Cookson was also among the first editors to publish work by young poets such as Elizabeth Jennings, R. S. Thomas, Ted Hughes, Roy Fuller, John Montague, Derek Mahon, Peter Levi, Michael Hamburger, and C. H. Sisson. 
Cookson published two books of his own poetry, 'Dream Traces' (1975) and 'Vestiges' (1987; revised and reissued as 'Vestiges and Versions', 2002), which owed a considerable debt to imagism. He was a craftsman of the subjective lyric, discovering tranquillity and quietus in the midst of a hectic, busy, and selfless life. He also edited a selection of Ezra Pound's prose with an introduction for Faber in 1973, and in 1985 brought out a superlatively detailed 'Guide to the Cantos of Ezra Pound' for New Directions in the USA (later reprinted with updates by Anvil Press in London). 
On 19 December 1973 Cookson married Vera Lungu, a 35-year-old Romanian, and daughter of Petru Lungu, a teacher. The marriage was dissolved shortly after, and on 20 July 1985 Cookson married the 37-year-old Margaret Elizabeth Craddock, medical secretary, and daughter of George Henry Craddock, company secretary. They had one daughter, Emma. He and his family liked to holiday on the Greek islands, and in one of his last reviews for 'Agenda' he wrote admiringly of Martin Hammond's translation of 'The Odyssey', praising its evocation of the beauty of the islands and reminding his readers of their debt to Greek poetry and civilization -- the necessity of tradition in a time of turbulent change. He was very fond of T. S. Eliot's observation that 'culture is traditional and loves novelty'. 
After a lifetime's struggle with alcoholism (his mother too had been a heavy drinker) Cookson died on 2 January 2003 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, just across the River Thames from his beloved Battersea Park. In his funeral address at St Mary's Church, Battersea, on 22 January 2003, the earl of Gowrie said of him: 'To edit a magazine for more than 40 years is a remarkable achievement. To do so without compromising your vision of what poetry is, and what poetry is for, is a heroic one' ('Address by Lord Gowrie', in McCarthy, 29).

Enright, Dennis Joseph (1920-2002), poet and literary critic, was born on 11 March 1920 at 20 Camberwell Terrace, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the elder child and only son of George Roderick Enright, postman, and his wife, Grace, 'nee' Cleaver. George Enright was from Ireland and a 'lapsed Catholic'. He had fought on the Somme and at Gallipoli. Grace was Welsh, and a Wesleyan Methodist. Much of Dennis Enright's childhood and youth can be glimpsed in his sequence of poems, 'The Terrible Shears: Scenes from a Twenties Childhood' (1974), in which he ruefully and entertainingly captured moments in a poor Anglo-Irish family in genteel Leamington. 
Enright was a scholarship boy, who won a place first to Leamington College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was a pupil of F. R. Leavis. He contributed to Leavis's journal, 'Scrutiny', while still an undergraduate: essays on and reviews of German literature as well as English. He graduated BA in 1944. As a conscientious objector during the Second World War, he was directed to work on the land, including driving farm lorries. 
When peace came, frustrated in finding any post in a British university (he partly blamed his Leavisite attachments), Enright began his teaching career at the Farouk I University in Alexandria in 1947. He later used much material from his period in Egypt in the first (and best) of his four novels, 'Academic Year' (1955). He also published in Alexandria, in 1948, his first slim volume of poems, 'Season Ticket', brought out by a local press. It attracted the attention of such critical notables of the period as Alan Pryce-Jones and Raymond Mortimer. 
Enright had in February 1946, in Warwick, married the twenty-year-old Daisy Emily Chainey, but in Egypt she soon 'attached herself' (as one of the characters in 'Academic Year' says about his own spouse) to an older, more sophisticated colleague of Enright's at the university, the Welsh scholar and translator Gwyn Williams, whom she married in 1949. Enright was left desolate by this, and seldom referred to the marriage. To ensure speedy and amicable divorce proceedings, he allowed himself to be seen as the guilty party. He had already met Madeleine Harders, widow of the French poet and novelist Marius Grout (winner of the 1943 prix Goncourt). She was teaching at the Lycee Francaise in Alexandria. They married in 1949. This was a long, close, and happy marriage. There was one child, their daughter Dominique. 
Enright wrote much poetry in Egypt, and also published his first prose book, 'A Commentary on Goethe's Faust' (1949), brought out in the USA by New Directions. This was based to some extent on work which had appeared first in 'Scrutiny'. It was also a by-product of the DLitt which, rather curiously, he took at the university in Alexandria: a thesis on three German poets (Holderlin, Rilke, and Stefan George), written in English, which he had to defend in French in front of a panel of Egyptian professors. 
The post-war Egypt in which the young Enright had arrived was no longer the curiously bohemian place of temporary intellectual exile conjured up by such names as Robert Liddell, Bernard Spencer, Terence Tiller, P. H. Newby, and Robin Fedden (all of whom taught in Egyptian universities in 1940-45), or Keith Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, G. S. Fraser, and Olivia Manning (not university-based but associated, even if only on wartime leave). These were the last years of Farouk's corrupt and decadent regime. It was a country on the edge of extreme and violent change. In 'Academic Year', and in some of his poems of the time, Enright reflected its mixture of anarchy and repression, nihilism and nerves, riots and rumours of riots and of 'coups d'etat', as well as the more customary student strikes. But his sardonic temperament also responded with delight to innumerable causes of amusement: the duplicating machine for the printing of examination papers installed in the lavatory, the stunningly unmarkable answers written during the feverish exam rituals ('Dickens' father was not successful in his marriage and he had ten children'), the varieties of Arab student English -- beseeching, charming, ingratiating, insolent: 'We all honour you, sir, you are our teacher. But we cannot work today -- it is Down with Britain day, if you will excuse it, sir.' 
In 1950 Enright returned with his wife Madeleine to Britain, where he was appointed an organizing tutor in the extramural department of the University of Birmingham, based in the Black Country, not far from the town of his upbringing, and involved in much peripatetic teaching. At a time of post-war austerity, it was not a particularly happy period for the Enrights; but it was in these years that he began to establish himself in Britain as a poet and critic of excellence and distinct views, in such periodicals as 'The Listener' (encouraged by J. R. Ackerley), the 'New Statesman' (for Raymond Mortimer and Janet Adam Smith), 'Essays in Criticism' (for F. W. Bateson), and the 'Times Literary Supplement' (for Alan Pryce-Jones). Though not a Catholic, he contributed reviews for a time to the Catholic journal 'The Month', and it was in its November 1951 issue that he had the distinction of being the sole reviewer of (and full of praise for) Philip Larkin's little self-published pamphlet 'XX Poems'. These were perhaps among the earliest murmurs of what became known, a few years later, as the Movement. In 'New Poems 1952' (the first of the PEN anthologies), Enright published three poems alongside ones by his later fellow-Movementeers Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest. 
Enright's next geographical move was more extreme and more crucial. In 1953 he took up a post as visiting professor at a rich private university in Japan, Konan University, near Kobe, in the Kansai (or midlands) of that country. This experience (1953-6) produced some of his best earlier poems, including such widely anthologized pieces as 'The Short Life of Kazuo Yamamoto' and 'The Noodle-Vendor's Flute'. He also produced one of the liveliest post-war prose books on aspects of modern Japan, 'The World of Dew' (1955), with its characteristic dedication 'To the union of goodwill to commonsense'. He had, almost proleptically, published his first full-scale volume of poems, 'The Laughing Hyena', in 1953, just before he arrived in Japan: the 'hyena' was a 'hanya', or Japanese devil-figure, depicted by Hokusai. The contradictions and ironies of Japan made good material. The Japan Enright got to know was a country still devastated by the war, poverty-stricken, several years before the 'economic miracle' of the 1960s and later; and the poet recognized what he saw all round him, and made use of what he saw. Apart from 'The World of Dew', the best emblem of Enright's Japanese years is his book of poems, 'Bread Rather than Blossoms' (1956) -- the title being a version of the Japanese proverb 'hana yori dango' ('dumplings before flowers'). 
One of the most influential moves made by Enright during his years in Japan was his editing (for the company Kenkyusha, in Tokyo -- a well-established publisher of books concerned with English studies) of the anthology 'Poets of the 1950s'. This appeared in early January 1956 -- a few months before Robert Conquest's 'New Lines' -- and it included all the poets in Conquest's book with the exception of Thom Gunn (whose work Enright had not then read). It became one of the sacred texts of literary history, or at least of the literary history of the Movement. 
On leaving Japan, Enright took up a brief and not very happy appointment at the Free University, Berlin, in 1956-7. There followed a rather happier period in Thailand, where he was British Council professor of English at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, from 1957 to 1959. Even here, though, there were unwelcome incidents, such as his brief incarceration in prison after an altercation with several policemen who had parked in the narrow road leading to the Enrights' front gate while they visited a brothel. An officer, spouting much abuse, kicked Enright; Madeleine struck the officer, all degenerated into a brawl, and Enright was marched off. The whole incident was later described with characteristic lugubrious wit in 'Memoirs of a Mendicant Professor' (1969). Enright also transgressed by taking up opium-smoking for a time in Thailand: the British Council representative and some senior members of the British embassy staff disapproved. Some of his published poems, too, were felt to be an embarrassment, such as one which 'referred to the recent shooting of several malefactors against the wall of the National Library... the poem respectfully opined that it was culturally deleterious to shoot people against the walls of libraries, and pointed out that in Europe we did this sort of thing more discreetly in cellars, etc. ('Memoirs', 97)' Though his engagement in Bangkok was prematurely terminated because of these 'difficulties', the British Council in London loyally tided Enright over until something else turned up. Indeed, he wrote with characteristic tongue-in-cheek irony of the council's offices in Davies Street, London: 'A blessing on its head! Cringing one's way out of one office, a broken man, an exposed pornographer, whoremonger, dipsomaniac, and opium addict, one's painter torn to ribbons, one would enter another office to find oneself a hero of labour, an expert, a distinguished academic, besought on almost bended knees to be gracious enough to fly first class to India and spread one's sweetness and light. ('Memoirs', 113)' What in fact turned up was the Johore professorship of English at the University of Singapore, a post Enright held from 1960 until 1970 -- his longest academic appointment, and his last abroad. This appointment got off to a lively and controversial start with his inaugural lecture. This was uncontroversially entitled 'Robert Graves and the decline of modernism', but it was its preliminary comments, on the cultural policies of the newly elected Singapore government, that made headline news, provoking a strong government reaction. The lecture urged Singapore and Malaya to remain culturally open, not devoted to 'a sarong-culture, complete with pantun competitions and so forth'. The acting minister of law and labour summoned Enright to his office, and in a later letter referred to him as a 'mendicant professor' -- an epithet which Enright turned to his own advantage in his later 'Memoirs'. What followed ('The faint odium, the odour of official disfavour attaching to the Professor of English', 'Memoirs', 146), a sort of symbolic status, continued for a long time. Nevertheless, Enright went on functioning effectively and genially in the university, in which he came to employ the young novelist Paul Theroux, who later wrote of him: 'Most people I meet tell me what an absolute sweetheart Dennis Enright is, yet he has always struck me as being rather tough, and capable of being fierce, as shy people often are' (Theroux, in Simms, 'Life by Other Means', 29). 
By 1970 Enright was tired of the Singapore government's tightening hold on the university, and perhaps tired of over twenty years of teaching abroad. A little earlier he had brooded that 'It's probably too late to go back... Already one finds whole tracts of such journals as the 'New Statesman' and the 'Spectator' largely incomprehensible' ('Memoirs', 190). But an invitation to become co-editor of the monthly journal 'Encounter' (to be responsible for the literary and 'cultural' material), together with the offer of a temporary lectureship in English at the University of Leeds, persuaded him to return to England in 1970. For the first time since his youth Enright settled down, finding a comfortable though cramped flat with Madeleine in a quiet part of Putney. His work for 'Encounter' was conscientious and energetic, but it was not full-time, nor was he paid a full-time salary. It was then, in the early 1970s, that Enright accelerated his considerable output of critical work, not only reviews and critical essays but the editing of a number of books, including several anthologies, such as the 'Oxford Book of Death' (1983) and the 'Faber Book of Fevers and Frets' (1989), and such 'causeries' as 'Fair of Speech: the Uses of Euphemism' (1985) and 'The Alluring Problem: an Essay on Irony' (1986). When he was approached by the publisher Chatto and Windus to join the firm as an editorial director, he gave up his 'Encounter' post and began work there (under the formidable Norah Smallwood) in 1974. At Chatto and Windus he was responsible for a broad range of titles, including the poetry list (which had been started by C. Day Lewis); but he was probably most proud of overseeing the enormous revision by Terence and Joanna Kilmartin of Proust's 'A la recherche du temps perdu' (1981), the first full overhaul of this masterpiece since the Scott Moncrieff version. 
Meanwhile Enright was as prolific a poet as ever. One of his most highly praised books was 'The Terrible Shears' (1974), a sequence about his childhood; two other sequences drew drily and wittily on great works of art, 'Paradise Illustrated' (1978) and 'A Faust Book' (1979). A first volume of 'Collected Poems' appeared in 1981, to be augmented several times before his death. He was awarded the queen's medal for poetry the same year. 
Enright resigned from publishing in 1982, and was a hard-working freelance for the rest of his life. Three late books were the 'commonplace' collections he put together -- thoughts prompted by his reading, sudden 'pensees', droll observations on words, attitudes, people, experiences: 'Interplay' (1995), 'Play Resumed' (1999), and 'Injury Time' (2003). He was appointed OBE in 1991. The year before that, in 1990, a Festschrift, 'Life by Other Means', edited by his long-time editor at Oxford University Press, Jacqueline Simms, was published to mark his seventieth birthday. This contained reminiscent and critical pieces by twenty-one poets, novelists, critics, and former colleagues, including A. S. Byatt, Donald Davie, Douglas Dunn, P. N. Furbank, Blake Morrison, Peter Porter, and Paul Theroux. Together they said many illuminating and amusing things about their subject and his work. He was made a companion of literature by the Royal Society of Literature in 1998. 
Enright was an amusing companion, his expressive face and 'sotto voce' comments lightening many a literary event. His long, droll features and crinkly hair were the attributes of a comedian, and indeed he reported of himself that in foreign parts he had sometimes been taken for Danny Kaye, and sometimes for Harpo Marx -- confusions which he occasionally allowed to go unresolved. His later years were dogged with physical ills (kidney and bladder problems, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer which began on a kidney), but these he typically put to use in 'hospital poems' and wry jottings in his commonplace books. He once called himself a 'disillusioned liberal', but then decided the word was not quite accurate: ''Chastened' let us rather say. What you have not deified cannot fail you so utterly. As for 'liberal', I don't think it will ever come to seem a dirty word to me' ('The Independent', 1 Jan 2003). He died on 31 December 2002 at Trinity Hospice, Clapham, London, of cancer of the bladder. He was survived by his wife, Madeleine, and their daughter, Dominique, a publisher.

Furlong, Monica Mavis (1930-2003), novelist and writer on religion, was born on 17 January 1930 at 29 Kenton Park Avenue, Kenton, Middlesex, the younger daughter of Alfred Gordon Furlong ('c'.1889- 'c'.1970), a motor tyre salesman of Irish descent, and his wife, Bessie Winifred Esther (Freda), 'nee' Simpson (1901-1985). She attended Harrow county girls' school and left to take a secretarial course. Her family did not expect a girl to go to university. After secretarial jobs she was in demand as a journalist, writing for 'The Spectator' (for Bernard Levin, who was to become a lifelong friend), 'The Guardian', and the 'Daily Mail', where she was on the staff from 1961 to 1968. During her time in secretarial work she was drawn to the Church of England and through her local vicar, Joost de Blank, later bishop of Stepney and archbishop of Cape Town, she learned an Anglo-Catholic form of Anglicanism. On 12 September 1953 she married William John Knights ('b'. 1922), the son of William John Knights; they had one son and one daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1977. This divorce, after twenty-four years of difficult marriage, was among the most painful experiences of her life; at that time divorce was seen as a terrible failure and disgrace for a Christian. In response to this she accepted a commission from the Mothers' Union to write a short book about the experience of divorce, a courageous act by herself and by the Mothers' Union. 
From 1974 to 1978 Furlong was a producer in the religious department at the BBC, while continuing to write. Her work as a journalist (on both secular and religious affairs) brought her into contact with most of the events and issues of life at the time. On the religious side, she wrote a steady stream of books, including 'With Love to the Church' (1965), reflecting her liberal understanding of prayer and spirituality, the more mystical 'Travelling In' (1971) and 'Contemplating Now' (1971), 'God's a Good Man' (poems, 1974, reissued in 'Prayers and Poems', 2003), and 'Christian Uncertainties' (1975). The first of her biographies was of John Bunyan, 'Puritan's Progress' (1975), followed by 'Merton' (1980), 'Genuine Fake' (1986, on the guru Alan Watts, reissued in 2001 as 'Zen Effects'), and 'Therese of Lisieux' (1987), in which she combined her spiritual interests and her feminist commitment. Her secular writing included four novels, which were highly praised, but did not become best-sellers: 'The Cat's Eye' (1976), 'Cousins' (1983), 'Wise Child' (1987), and 'A Year and a Day' (1990), the two last being novels for children, set in the seventh century. She also wrote a travel book, 'Flight of the Kingfisher: a Journey among the Kukatja Aborigines' (1996). 
As one of the leading Christian feminists of her time Furlong made an outstanding contribution in the political arena, in feminist thought and writing and in the area of worship and spirituality. She stood in the proud Anglican tradition of women theologians and writers such as Dorothy Sayers and Rose Macaulay. She shared with them a depth of catholic practice and original theological insight, a critical love for the church and willingness to challenge it, as well as a private life which did not conform to everything the hierarchy wanted to regard as respectable. But their fame eluded her, and she found it difficult to produce a regular and consistent series of novels which would gradually have built up a committed body of readers and laid the foundations for popular success. 
After 1975 Furlong became a campaigner for the ordination of women, bringing to the task her wide friendships across the whole area of public and literary life. She was moderator of the Movement for the Ordination of Women from 1982 to 1985. In this role she ensured that the movement kept a cutting edge, did not compromise, and was not afraid of embarrassing the (male) bishops. Everything she did was founded on theological understanding, but her main ability was to work on several fronts at once. Her leadership of the St Hilda community (which worshipped in the East End of London on Sunday evenings) gave women a vision of what could be done in leading worship; those who imagined that worship was impossible unless a male priest celebrated the eucharist for them not only saw that the sky did not fall if a woman priest (from the United States) was the celebrant, but more importantly that, if male priests continued to keep the eucharist within their own power, then there were many non-eucharistic ways in which Christians could worship God. Meanwhile her knowledge of the media, and her contacts within it, alongside her ability to think strategically, made her a most effective politician. She knew how to present her cause to the media and how to avoid being silenced by the authorities in the church. Her refusal to be daunted was the chief memory of those who worked with her. She would not allow herself to become dependent on male approval, and knew that women too had much to offer the church and society. Many of her religious books reflected her concern for women's issues: they included 'Feminine in the Church' (1984), 'Mirror to the Church' (editor, 1988), 'A Dangerous Delight' (1991), 'Bird of Paradise' (memoir, 1995), and 'Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics' (1996). Her last and most challenging book was 'The C of E: the State It's In' (2000). Church leaders were not happy to face her criticism in this book, and yet it was seen by many readers as prophetic. 
Furlong received honorary doctorates from Bristol University and from the General Theological Seminary of New York. After the ending of her marriage she continued to live in London, with a large and lively circle of friends. After some years of struggle with the church, which as an institution sometimes seemed not to return her love, she settled down in her last years to edit her local parish magazine and to campaign for the abolition of the act of synod that hedged the ordination of women as priests about with huge privileges for those who objected to it. She was delighted with the appointment of Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury. She died of ovarian cancer at the Round House, Hoe Farm, Umberleigh, Devon, where she spent her final days with her daughter's family, on 14 January 2003. She was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Cator Road, Beckenham, on 23 January. She was survived by both her children.

Gibb, Maurice Ernest (1949-2003), musician, was born on 22 December 1949 in Douglas, Isle of Man, the younger twin and third of the four sons of Hugh Leslie (Hughie) Gibb (1916-1992), a Manchester-based ballroom bandleader, and his wife, the singer Barbara May, 'nee' Pass ('b'. 1920). He had an older sister, Lesley ('b'. 1945). At the age of six he, his twin brother Robin Hugh Gibb (1949-2012), and their elder brother Barry Alan Crompton Gibb ('b'. 1946) formed the Rattlesnakes, and began to sing on the stages of Manchester cinemas, performing short sets between feature films, particularly on Saturday mornings. In 1958 (shortly after the birth of the fourth son, Andy) the family emigrated to Queensland, Australia, where the three older boys continued to perform as a harmony group at first called the BGs and then the Bee Gees, both abbreviations of Brothers Gibb, at beach resort venues in and around Brisbane. Their act owed much to the inspiration of America's Everly Brothers. Regular appearances on a local television show led to their first recording contract with Festival Records, a leading Australian label for whom they made a dozen singles and two albums. By 1965 the Bee Gees were voted Australia's top songwriters. The following year 'Spicks and Specks' went to the top of the Australian charts, although by this time the Gibbs had decided to return to England. 
In London the Australian impresario Robert Stigwood (a director of Brian Epstein's NEMS Enterprises) became the Bee Gees' new manager, and they consequently joined a roster that ranged from the Beatles and Cream to Cilla Black. The Beatles and the Bee Gees became friendly, Maurice bonding particularly with John Lennon, who gave him his first alcoholic drink and later presented him with a guitar for his twenty-first birthday. Boosted by an introductory appearance on BBC television's 'Top of the Pops' in May 1967, the Bee Gees took their first UK single, 'New York Mining Disaster 1941', to number one. They followed this with a string of further hits, including 'To Love Somebody' (also recorded by Nina Simone), 'Massachusetts', 'World', 'Words' (later recorded by artists as diverse as Elvis Presley and Boyzone, and honoured by the Isle of Man Post Office with a commemorative stamp in 1999), and 'I've Got to Get a Message to You', as well as several best-selling albums. Their fame spread to the USA, where the group's three initial albums, '1st', 'Horizontal', and 'Idea', soared into the best-sellers. Maurice Gibb, the most versatile of the trio, played bass guitar, piano, organ, and Mellotron, as well as contributing to the group's distinctive vocal harmonies, though he was often overshadowed by his brothers. Robin Gibb took the lead vocal on most of their early hits, but it was Barry's voice which made their sound instantly recognizable. 
Barry Gibb was the first of the three brothers to marry, on 22 August 1966 tying the knot with Maureen Bates. They were divorced in 1970. On 4 December 1968 Robin Gibb married Molly Hullis, a music industry publicist, and daughter of George Frank Hullis, safety officer. They had together survived the Hither Green rail crash the previous year, which claimed forty-nine lives. They had two children, Spencer ('b'. 1972) and Melissa ('b'. 1974), but the marriage ended in separation and then in 1980 in divorce. On 18 February 1969 Maurice Gibb married the successful Scottish pop singer Marie McDonald McLachlan Lawrie, known as Lulu ('b'. 1948), daughter of Edward Lawrie, a butcher, at St James's Church, Gerrard's Cross, Buckinghamshire, and she moved initially into his mews cottage in Belgravia and later to a house in Highgate. They had first met in a BBC television canteen. When the marriage broke down four years later Lulu said: 'It was never going to work. We were two spoiled little pop stars each too used to having our own way' (Lulu, 113). 
Disputes within the trio in 1969, and in particular between Barry and Robin, over who should be their lead vocalist, paved the way for Robin's departure. Each of the Gibbs attempted solo projects but failed to find any to give them long-term job satisfaction. Maurice went into 'Sing a Rude Song', a musical produced in Greenwich, and issued a single, 'Railroad'. Robin issued a solo album, 'Robin's Reign' (1970), and Barry recorded some singles which failed to chart. Barry and Maurice also collaborated on the album 'Cucumber Castle' (1970), which reached number 57 in the UK album charts. By 1971 the brothers had reunited to make the album 'Trafalgar', which went to number one in the American charts. After a period of relative inactivity the Bee Gees came crashing back into the headlines in 1975 with the disco-orientated 'Jive Talking', a chart-topper on both sides of the Atlantic, followed by the equally popular 'You Should Be Dancing' (1976). Stigwood strengthened the group's new association with disco dancing by getting them to write seven songs for the soundtrack of his film 'Saturday Night Fever', including 'Night Fever', 'Stayin' Alive', and 'How Deep is Your Love'. 
All three brothers married happily a second time. On 1 September 1970 Barry married Linda Gray, a former Miss Edinburgh. They had four sons and a daughter. On 17 October 1975 Maurice married Yorkshire-born Yvonne Jeanette Spenceley ('b'. 1950), daughter of Ronald Spenceley, store manager for a wine merchant. They had two children, Adam ('b'. 1976) and Samantha ('b'. 1980). The couple had been introduced by the boss of Batley's famous Variety Club, where the Bee Gees were appearing in cabaret and Yvonne was manageress of the venue's steak bar. Yvonne was credited with helping Gibb to reduce his enormous intake of alcohol, which had spiralled out of control over the years to become a serious problem. On 31 July 1985 Robin married Edwina Elizabeth (Dwina) Murphy, a writer and artist with an interest in druids and esoteric religion, and daughter of Edward John Murphy, engineer. They had one son, Robin-John ('b'. 1983). Robin Gibb also had a daughter, Snow ('b'. 2008), with his housekeeper, Claire Yang, but he remained in a committed relationship with his wife, Dwina. 
Seeking a change of musical environment in which to make their R&B-orientated album 'Main Course', the Bee Gees moved to America, renting a place on Ocean Boulevard in Miami, the previous home of Eric Clapton. The brothers decided to make their permanent homes in Miami, creating their own Miami-based music production company, Middle Ear Studios. Aretha Franklin's acclaimed producer, Arif Mardin, helped to Americanize their studio style, showcasing Maurice Gibb's bass-playing more powerfully, utilizing Robin Gibb's distinctive vibrato, and accentuating Barry Gibb's high-flying falsetto, a vocal gimmick that became a memorable hallmark of the group's sound. Recordings produced during the later 1970s and early 1980s included six consecutive chart-topping singles in the United States. Titles such as 'You Should Be Dancing', 'Too Much Heaven', 'Tragedy', and 'Spirits Having Flown' (from the album of the same name, which sold 20 million copies worldwide) were released via Robert Stigwood's RSO label. In this era the only blemish on the Bee Gees' record of musical achievements was their participation in Stigwood's less than mediocre film 'Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band', loosely based on the ground-breaking 1967 album made by the Beatles. Meanwhile they expanded their recording activities to write material for and produce recording sessions with a range of North American female superstars including Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Dolly Parton, and Dionne Warwick. In 1987 the international number one hit single 'You Win Again' marked the group's move to Warner Brothers. Personal tragedy marred the lives of the Gibbs the following year with the sudden death of the youngest brother, Andy, himself a successful singer. 
The three brothers joined the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994. The Bee Gees sold well over 220 million records by the time of Robin's death (second as a group only to The Beatles), won seven Grammy awards, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2002 the three brothers were each appointed CBE. Although the group's work in the 1990s was less spectacularly popular, they continued to record until two years before Maurice died, their final album being 'This is Where I Came In' (2001), a curious mixture of musical styles recalling both their disco successes of the 1970s and the earliest hits they had written in the late 1960s. 
Maurice Gibb was widely regarded as the most gregarious of the brothers, a benign, down-to-earth peacemaker, and a mild-mannered stabilizing influence who maintained an equal balance of power within the trio. He died at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami, on 12 January 2003. During emergency abdominal surgery a few days earlier he had suffered a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Yvonne, and their two children. 
After Maurice's death, Barry and Robin Gibb made several joint appearances, but declined to appear as the Bee Gees. Robin Gibb released an album, 'My Favourite Christmas Carols' (2003), and both brothers featured on other artists' recordings. Robin also entered into community life in Thame, Oxfordshire, where he lived at the The Prebendal, Priest End (as well as maintaining homes in Miami and on the Isle of Man). The last few years of his life were clouded by the onset of cancer, spreading from his colon to his liver and lungs. Nevertheless, he collaborated with his son Robin-John on the latter's 'Titanic Requiem' (2012). He died at the London Clinic, Devonshire Place, Westminster, on 20 May 2012 and was survived by his wife, Dwina, and his four children.

Goodwin, Ronald Alfred (1925-2003), conductor, composer, and arranger, was born at 10 Corry Street, Devonport, Plymouth, Devon, on 17 February 1925, the younger son of James Goodwin (died 1952), a Metropolitan Police constable engaged in security work at the naval dockyard, and his wife, Bessie Violet, 'nee' Godsland (died 1966). He learned to play the piano from the age of five, and when he was nine the family returned to London. At Willesden county grammar school he took up the trumpet and joined the school band. When the Second World War broke out the family moved to Harrow, and Goodwin transferred to Pinner county grammar school, where he formed his own band -- Ron Goodwin and the Woodchoppers. 
In 1943, after a brief spell as an insurance clerk, Goodwin joined the arranging department of the music publisher Campbell, Connelly & Co. There he received invaluable help from the arranger Harry G. Stafford, and he also took private conducting lessons from Siegfried de Chabot, a professor at the Guildhall School of Music. He subsequently worked as an arranger for Paramor-Gold Orchestral Services and played trumpet for Harry Gold and his Pieces of Eight. In 1945 he became head of the arranging department at Bron Associated Publishers, and very soon he was arranging for bands of the day including the Ted Heath, Geraldo, and BBC dance orchestras. On 3 July 1947 he married Ellen Gertrude Drew, daughter of William Lewis Drew, postman. They had one son, Christopher Russell Goodwin ('b'. 1951). 
From 1949 Goodwin conducted for the Polygon company, arranging and conducting recordings of Petula Clark and Jimmy Young, including the latter's number one hit, 'Too Young' (1951). He then began an association with George Martin of Parlophone Records, which from 1953 saw him arranging and conducting more than 300 recordings for over fifty artists, including Peter Sellers in the series of three LPs that culminated in 1960 in 'Peter and Sophia' and its hit single 'Goodness, Gracious Me!'. He simultaneously made his own recordings and broadcasts as Ron Goodwin and his Concert Orchestra, and in addition began to compose scores for documentary films at Merton Park studios. 
In 1958 Goodwin wrote his first feature film score for 'Whirlpool', with screenplay by Lawrence P. Bachmann. After Bachmann became executive producer at MGM British Studios in 1959 Goodwin composed and conducted the music for most of its productions, as well as working for other film studios. Especially successful was his music for 'Murder She Said' (1961), and for other films featuring Margaret Rutherford as Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. However, he really made his name with the wider public with the film '633 Squadron' (1964), producing an ingenious main theme using six fast beats and three slow beats. Music for 'Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines' (1965) cemented Goodwin's high public profile, as did that for 'Battle of Britain' (1969), commissioned to replace a score by Sir William Walton that the studio deemed unsuitable. Others of over sixty feature films to use his music included 'The Trap' (1966), which featured Oliver Reed and whose theme became widely familiar through television coverage of the London marathon. Goodwin also composed the scores for 'Where Eagles Dare' (1969), Alfred Hitchcock's 'Frenzy' (1972), and 'Force Ten from Navarone' (1978). 
Meanwhile Goodwin's LPs on the Columbia Studio Two label, models of good taste in their integration of elements of jazz and swing into the classical orchestral format, won wide popularity and earned him a gold disc for the album 'Spellbound' (1973). In 1970 he first appeared as guest conductor of leading orchestras, with a repertory combining current popular music and film themes, with his own linking anecdotes. These concerts proved hugely popular, leading to invitations to conduct across the world. Goodwin's more extended compositions included his 'Drake 400 Suite' (1980) and 'Armada 400 Suite' (1988), both commissioned by his native Plymouth. His 'New Zealand Suite' (1983) marked a long association with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, which in 1978 had earned him a platinum disc from EMI New Zealand for the album 'Going Places'. He received three Ivor Novello awards, including a lifetime achievement award, and was a fellow of the City of Leeds College of Music and a freeman of the City of London. On 22 September 1986, after the dissolution of his first marriage, he married Heather Elizabeth Mary Dunsden, whom he had known since her childhood. She was the daughter of Harold Wesley Dunsden, civil servant. 
Goodwin was a musical perfectionist, but with a fine rapport with his fellow artists. He was recognized as a kind, caring man, with a wonderful sense of humour. A keen worker with young people, he was much involved with the Hampshire County Youth Orchestra and the City of Birmingham Schools' Concert Orchestra. For many years he conducted a series of light-hearted Christmas shows with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, the final ones only a few days before his death at his home, Blacknest Cottage, Brimpton Common, Berkshire, on 8 January 2003, following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Heather, and his son, Christopher.

Gorman, William Moore (1923-2003), economist, was born at Letterkeen, near Enniskillen, co. Fermanagh, on 17 June 1923, the son of Richard Gorman (died 1927), a veterinary surgeon practising in Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia, and his wife, Sarah Crawford, 'nee' Moore (died 1963). He spent some of his early childhood in southern Africa, and it was his African nursemaid who named him Terence, a name that stuck. After his father's death he returned with his mother to Northern Ireland. He was educated at Mount Temple School, Rathgar, Dublin, and Foyle College, Londonderry, and went to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1941. From 1943 to 1946 he served as a radio mechanic in the Fleet Air Arm. He graduated from Trinity in 1948 in economics and in 1949 in mathematics. While at Trinity he met his future wife, Dorinda Maud (Din) Scott, daughter of Walter Thomas Scott, civil servant. They married in Dublin on 29 December 1950. The previous year Gorman had been appointed an assistant lecturer in econometrics and social statistics in the commerce faculty at the University of Birmingham. He was promoted lecturer in 1951 and senior lecturer in 1957 before going on to hold chairs in economics at Oxford (1962-7) and at the London School of Economics (1967-79). He then returned, as an official fellow, to Nuffield College, Oxford, where he remained until he retired in 1990. 
Gorman was one of the foremost creators of the new field of consumer economics. He made at least four important contributions to the way economists thought about consumer decision-making. His interest in consumer behaviour seems to have begun with his undergraduate thesis at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1948, on the demand for tomatoes. Subsequently he realized that the huge range of products available meant that systematic analysis of consumer behaviour would be swamped in detail and no broad concepts would be recoverable. So the 'characteristics approach' to consumer behaviour was born. 
In the late 1950s, while teaching at the University of Birmingham, Gorman undertook an exchange with agricultural researchers in Iowa. In his research on quality differentials in the egg market he developed his method of looking at commodities in terms of a relatively small number of underlying characteristics. For example a food product may be thought of in terms of nutrition, colour, and so on. He realized that if utility depended just on these characteristics this theory could explain why consumers bought only a limited set of commodities. It could explain the demand for new goods, now thought of as a new bundle of the same underlying characteristics. This idea became a mainstay of consumer theory, used extensively in industrial economics. 
In the 1960s Gorman also developed the idea of 'two-stage budgeting' to simplify consumer decision-making. He asked the question: when is it possible to simplify decision-making across broad groups of commodities so that choices in one group can be made with only limited information about choices in others? Two-stage budgeting again became commonplace in the way economists envisaged consumer decisions across a wide range of markets, from fruit and vegetables to assets. As with Gorman's work on characteristics, he developed a new concept to match the decision-making process of consumers, but also to help the analyst to make sense of the market. 
Gorman's third contribution to economics was the notion of adult equivalence scales as a method of comparing households. Part of the stock in trade of microeconomic policy analysis was to examine the distributional consequences of policy reforms. For instance, would a proposed tax reform lift more families out of poverty? Would it reduce inequality? The answers required households of different types to be compared. Gorman came up with a way to 'equivalize' families of different sizes. His solution was to think of the minimum income required to achieve a level of well-being, then consider the amount that income needs to be shifted to achieve the same level of well-being for another family of a different composition. Gorman noted that because children consume different bundles of goods from adults this adjustment will differ when prices change, and he worked out a consistent way of dealing with this. 
Finally, Gorman provided an extensive methodology for linking macro- and micro-relations in economic behaviour. How easy is it to predict the way aggregate non-durable expenditure changes with growth in national income? Gorman showed the conditions under which such a stable aggregate relationship would hold. Indeed, this was some of his first work, published in the 1950s. The conditions he derived turned out to be strong indeed and unlikely to be satisfied, especially in periods of changing distribution. 
Gorman was infuriatingly stubborn, yet endearing. Notoriously absent-minded, he never really understood that many people -- even trained economists -- have difficulty conceptualizing economic phenomena in mathematical terms. In many ways he was the epitome of the ivory-tower academic. Yet he was one of a small number of distinguished twentieth-century academics who changed economics. Wonderfully clever and engaging, he featured on many shortlists for the Nobel prize in economics and was highly influential on the work of many Nobel prizewinners. Although his ideas were adopted in many day-to-day economic analyses, he remained largely unknown to most economists outside academia during his own lifetime. He received honorary doctorates from Southampton and Birmingham universities, the National University of Ireland, and University College, London, where he was a visiting professor (1986-96). He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1978. He was also an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and of the London School of Economics; and an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Economics Association. In 1972 he served as president of the Econometric Society. His last years were clouded by Alzheimer's disease. He died on 13 January 2003 at the Manor House nursing home, Merton, Oxfordshire, following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Din. There were no children of the marriage.

Jenkins, Roy Harris, Baron Jenkins of Hillhead (1920-2003), politician and author, was born at Greenlands, Snatchwood Road, Abersychan, Monmouthshire, on 11 November 1920, the only child of Arthur Jenkins (1882-1946), assistant miners' agent, and his wife, Harriet (Hattie), 'nee' Harris (1886-1953), music shop assistant and subsequently magistrate and county councillor. 
In his old age Jenkins, with characteristic detachment, described his mother as 'a little plump but no more' (Jenkins, 'A Life at the Centre', 8), and there was no doubt which of his two parents had the greater influence upon him. The young Jenkins worshipped his father, an unusually cultivated man who -- despite going to prison at the time of the general strike in 1926 -- went on to be MP for Pontypool (1935-46), parliamentary private secretary to the leader of the Labour Party, and finally a junior minister in the post-war Attlee government. 
Typical of Jenkins's mother's desire for middle-class respectability was the fact that news of his father's sentence of imprisonment for nine months (of which he served only three) on charges of riotous assault and incitement to riot was carefully kept from Roy until he was in his mid-teens. Other Welsh mining valley families of the time might well have taken pride in such an example of political martyrdom but that had never been Hattie Jenkins's way. She merely informed her son that his father had gone on 'an extended tour of inspection of the coalmines of Germany' ('A Life at the Centre', 17) and the young Jenkins knew no better until he eventually learned the truth from contemporaries at school. It was not so much that his parents were ashamed of what had occurred; rather was it that neither of them wanted their son -- the apple of their eyes who had been born after nine years of marriage, a number of miscarriages, and one stillbirth -- to grow up an embittered class warrior. 
All the evidence suggests that Jenkins enjoyed a happy childhood. As a fully fledged miners' agent employed from 1921 by the South Wales Miners' Federation his father held an assured place in the community, something tacitly acknowledged when in November 1935 he succeeded a local former steelworker as Labour MP for his native constituency. Arthur Jenkins's election to parliament for Pontypool at the age of fifty-three may have come too late for him to have any realistic prospect of a dazzling political career. But as an alumnus of Ruskin College, Oxford, to which trade union seminary he had won a mature scholarship in 1908, and as in addition someone who had spent time in Paris (where he acquired a French accent that was always to elude his son), he soon made sufficient impression at Westminster to be invited by the leader of his party, Clement Attlee, to become his parliamentary private secretary and join him working in his private office. It was the foundation of a bond between the two families that was to survive even Arthur Jenkins's death in 1946. 
But if his father's removal from home necessarily had its downside for the young Jenkins -- Arthur Jenkins followed the usual practice among Labour MPs of the time of spending three or four nights a week at a modest hotel in London and only coming back to the constituency at weekends -- it also had its compensations. The necessary abandonment of the post of miners' agent meant that the family had to move house, and their new rented home in Pontypool proved far more spacious, having no fewer than twelve rooms, to say nothing of half an acre of garden. The new MP and his wife frequently invited visiting politicians to stay -- and it was thus at this early stage of his life that the young Jenkins first met such Labour luminaries as Attlee himself, his deputy Herbert Morrison, the future chancellor Hugh Dalton, and Arthur's own boss later at the Ministry of Education, Ellen Wilkinson. Insofar as a member of 'the people's party' can be born to the purple, Roy Jenkins could plausibly claim that something very like it had happened to him. It remained, however, a measure of the wry amusement he brought to the cult of celebrity that he always afterwards maintained that the figure who had easily the greatest impact upon him was not any distinguished member of the opposition front bench but rather a wandering Workers' Educational Association lecturer recently banished from Oxford and just beginning to be known -- at least to 'New Statesman' readers -- under the byline of R. H. S. Crossman ('A Life at the Centre', 23). 
By 1937 the young Jenkins's eyes began to turn to Oxford. Curiously his father had sent him not to the best school in the area -- West Monmouth School in Pontypool -- but rather to the Abersychan county school, perhaps on the ground that it was nearer the family's original Abersychan home. The young Jenkins had done reasonably well at Pentuin primary school but at Abersychan county school any academic promise tended rather to fall away. On his own admission his higher school certificate results were 'undistinguished' ('A Life at the Centre', 24). 
Possibly as a result, his father came under some pressure from a friend who was a schools inspector to move him to a private boarding school; but, luckily for Jenkins's political prospects, this plan withered on the vine and instead the seventeen-year-old found himself going daily by bus to attend University College, Cardiff. Some hostile comment was caused many years later by his failure to include any reference to this educational interlude in his 'Who's Who' entry -- but the truth seems to have been that he always saw it in the light of an 'interlude' and as a mere six-month preparation for tuition at Oxford, and it did not seem to him to merit a mention of its own. 
Ever since his own brief days at Ruskin College before the First World War Arthur Jenkins had been determined that any son of his would go to Oxford and attend the university proper. But this meant a considerable financial sacrifice. An MP then earned only $600 a year and, although Jenkins's father received an additional $90 per annum from the mineworkers' union, putting a child through university clearly represented a strain on such slender resources. (The young Jenkins had sat the Balliol College scholarship exam in March 1938 but had not won any award.) It was nevertheless to Balliol, as a commoner and at his father's expense, that he went in October 1938, soon finding himself in the thick of the Oxford 'Munich' by-election of that month -- in which the master of his college, A. D. Lindsay, stood as an 'Independent Progressive' critic of the Munich agreement, only to be defeated by the Neville Chamberlain loyalist and Conservative candidate, Quintin Hogg. 
Balliol at that time was very much at the political hub of the university, and the young grammar school boy from south Wales was fortunate in the wide range of future parliamentarians assembled among his contemporaries. Remarkably, within a single college the list included the future Conservative prime minister Edward Heath, the high tory Hugh Fraser, who sat opposite Jenkins in the Commons for almost thirty years, and Julian Amery, who served as minister of aviation immediately preceding Jenkins -- to say nothing of future Commons Labour colleagues such as Denis Healey and David Ginsburg. His own closest political ally and personal friend was, however, drawn from the college next door -- Trinity -- to which Anthony (Tony) Crosland had gone the year before Jenkins arrived at Balliol. Together they fought battles both in the Oxford Union and within the University Labour Club, which latter they were responsible for splitting by jointly founding the Oxford University Democratic Socialist Club in the spring of 1940. With the old Labour Club full of hard-line communists (of whom Healey at the time was one) the new organization prospered, soon attracting 400 members and electing Jenkins as its chairman in succession to Crosland at the end of 1940. In the Oxford Union, though, he had less luck, failing to become its president by a mere five votes in June 1940, and being defeated rather more emphatically at his second attempt in November 1940. Even fifteen years later, when dining with a group of Labour Club undergraduates, he would recall these twin defeats as 'the two greatest disappointments of my Oxford career'. 
That career had, however, its compensations -- not least the first-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics that he attained in the summer of 1941. (He took justifiable pride, too, in his presidency of the Balliol junior common room, to which he was elected for a year in December 1940.) But, once 1941 had opened, it was towards the achievement of his first in 'schools' that most of his efforts were bent. As he recalled many years later, 'It was obvious that my only hope of doing well was to change my habits completely... I accordingly started to work eight hours a day, seven days a week and kept up this average for the next eighty days' ('A Life at the Centre', 43). It was a valiant effort and it secured the desired result. In July 1941 Jenkins discovered that he had won one of just four firsts in philosophy, politics, and economics awarded that year -- and the fact that his own success had been managed only after a forty-minute viva strongly suggested, as he always had the grace to admit, that his was very much a borderline case. (He was also fond of recalling that his economics tutor at Balliol, Thomas Balogh, later as a peer a ministerial colleague in the final Wilson government, was so taken aback when the results came out that he had to pour himself a stiff whisky in order to cope with the shock.) 
How much difference did getting to Oxford make to Jenkins's life? The obvious answer is that it was decisive -- it was, after all, a Balliol don who famously spoke of him as 'one of nature's Old Etonians'. Certainly, all trace of Welsh inflection or intonation (with rare exceptions such as his continued enunciation of the word 'situation', which invariably came out as something like ''sidooazhun'') miraculously disappeared from his speech once he became an Oxonian, leaving his voice with only one distinctive characteristic: his inability to pronounce the letter 'r' (which always emerged as 'w'). 
There were other things, too, that Oxford did not change. If Jenkins arrived at Balliol in the autumn of 1938 as almost a tribal Labour supporter, he departed from it in the summer of 1941 in exactly the same unreconstructed political state. But by then his personality had certainly blossomed -- not least through his encountering at a Fabian summer school held at Dartington Hall in Devon in August 1940 his future wife, (Mary) Jennifer Morris ('b'. 1921), the daughter of the renowned town clerk of Westminster, Sir (George) Parker Morris. The attraction, despite some attempted competition from Tony Crosland, appears to have been mutual and immediate. Although they had never encountered one another before, the two of them left Dartington Hall together at the end of the summer school and, through all the demands and exigencies of war, managed to keep in regular touch before being married towards the end of the war at the Savoy Chapel in London on 20 January 1945 (with Clement Attlee as a witness). 
Although interesting and fulfilling enough, Jenkins's Second World War service was hardly heroic. Commissioned in the summer of 1942 into the West Somerset yeomanry -- which, together with the Leicestershire yeomanry, supplied artillery support for the guards armoured division -- he served as a lieutenant with a domestic battery for a little under two years before being summoned at War Office direction to join the code-breakers working at Bletchley Park. (The responsibility for this change of activity seems to have lain with A. D. Lindsay, the master of Balliol, who prided himself on his capacity to get Balliol men into military jobs that suited their talents.) But not being a mathematician, or even a dedicated crossword-solver, the 23-year-old Jenkins lacked the obvious talents attached to his more cerebral colleagues working at Bletchley, something that at first tended to intimidate him. Nevertheless, with the exception of one period in the autumn of 1944 when, as he put it, he 'went seriously off form for several weeks' ('A Life at the Centre', 53), he acquitted himself well, more than justifying the faith placed in his mental ingenuity by his former college head. 
Yet Jenkins never allowed codes, or the keys to them, totally to dominate his mind. He kept up his general reading and maintained his keen interest in politics, attending at least two annual conferences of the Labour Party, held at Methodist Central Hall, Westminster, during the war. The son of a Labour MP who had come to his true vocation only relatively late in life, Jenkins made up his mind while still in his twenties that a politician was what he would like to be. By the last part of the war he was already actively seeking a parliamentary seat -- and the best prospect looked like the Aston division of Birmingham, which had already been won for Labour by John Strachey in 1929, only to revert to the Conservatives in both 1931 and 1935. 
In the event the youthful Captain Jenkins lost at the selection conference to Major Woodrow Wyatt, two years his senior -- supposedly, according to his successful rival, because, when offered accommodation overnight by the constituency secretary, he had responded that while the invitation was very kind he preferred on balance to stay in a hotel. This, Wyatt implied in his mid-term autobiography, 'Confessions of an Optimist' (1985), had made his opponent sound somewhat less than a man of the people, though the truth was both more complex and more compromising. The one thing that his shyness prevented Jenkins from explaining was that his fiancee, as Jennifer Morris had now become, planned to spend the night with him in Birmingham and that in those circumstances it seemed tactful to enjoy the anonymity of a hotel rather than risk embarrassing the 'en famille' ambience of a party member's home. Disappointed again in at least one other Birmingham seat -- Leo Amery's Sparkbrook constituency, which went to a local Labour alderman who proceeded comfortably to win it at the general election -- the young parliamentary aspirant was still not prepared to give up, eventually agreeing to fight the safe tory seat of Solihull on the outskirts of Birmingham, where he found himself facing a Conservative majority of 34,649. 
It amused Jenkins in his later years to comment that at his first election in 1945 he 'achieved the not inconsiderable feat of standing for Labour and still failing to win' (private information). But that was a grossly unfair piece of self-mockery: even in the annus mirabilis for Labour of 1945 there was no way that solid suburban seats like Solihull would forsake their traditional tory allegiance. Jenkins had done remarkably well to cut the Conservative majority in the way that he had -- he got it down to barely more than 5000. It was a thoroughly creditable result and one that had the useful effect of reinforcing the high opinion that the party's regional office already held of him. Yet it still meant that the young soldier -- allowed leave to fight the election but not formally released from the army until January 1946 -- would have to find a job once he returned to civilian life. 
That problem, though, was soon solved for him. One of the earliest decisions of the just elected Labour government had been to set up a body somewhat portentously called the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), established to make it easier for small- to medium-sized businesses to raise long-term capital. The ICFC's chairman was the then freshly ennobled Labour peer William Piercy whom the young Jenkins had got to know when this former lecturer at the London School of Economics worked alongside his father in Attlee's private office during the war. The invitation thus duly came for the about-to-be-demobbed Captain Jenkins to take on the role of an apprentice amateur merchant banker in the public sector -- and not least because it afforded the opportunity of a priority release from the forces it was accepted with alacrity. 
Jenkins himself always afterwards maintained that he was not really cut out to be a merchant banker. His one triumph at the ICFC was to arrange for the grant of a loan of $163,000 to Charles Forte, a significant step along the road to fame and fortune for Forte who, then a mere milk-bar owner, went on to become one of the most successful hoteliers and restaurateurs in Britain. Yet the melancholy truth was that the majority of his work bored the young, aspiring politician who, whether prudently or not, found it hard to disguise from his colleagues his impatience to join other junior Labour lions, such as Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, in the House of Commons. 
Jenkins's first chance to do so surfaced in distinctly sad circumstances. In April 1946 Arthur Jenkins, always the hero and mentor to his son in his growing years, died. He was only sixty-four but his hard work as Attlee's parliamentary private secretary, starting in 1937, had plainly exhausted him. He was already suffering from a neglected prostate condition when, after he had served for a few weeks as under-secretary at the Ministry of Town and Country Planning during the last phase of Churchill's wartime coalition, Attlee chose him to join Ellen Wilkinson at the Ministry of Education in August 1945. According to his own account, the 25-year-old Jenkins was 'shattered by his death' ('A Life at the Centre', 66). 
The vacancy his father's loss created in the Commons inevitably posed the question as to whether Jenkins, defeated at Solihull only nine months previously, should apply to fill it. Perhaps rashly, and very much at the urging of his strong-minded mother, he decided to do so, only to find himself vanquished at the final hurdle. In the run-off ballot at an adjourned selection conference -- there had been some voting paper irregularities on the first day -- the son of the former member gained seventy-six votes against the 134 won by his equally local rival (a solicitor practising in the town's courts). At the time it was clearly a massive disappointment, in no way mitigated by his mother's regarding it also as a personal insult, but in retrospect Jenkins came to see it as something more akin to a deliverance. Had he been chosen to succeed his father while not yet even twenty-six not only would he have been constantly compared to him; even more dangerously, with the example of Arthur Jenkins in mind, he would have found it very hard to avoid being categorized as primarily a Welsh politician who happened to go up to London once a week in order to vote in the Commons. 
Not all mercies are, however, immediately perceived as such -- and the depth of the young Jenkins's disappointment was perhaps best reflected in the restiveness that immediately began to affect his professional life, still necessarily outside parliament. In the months following the Pontypool debacle he continued working at the ICFC but did not seem able to stop himself from feeling increasingly unsettled. He applied for academic jobs (both at Oxford and at Manchester), put in an application to become a BBC talks producer, and even thought about reading for the bar -- something he had originally planned to do on leaving Oxford and probably would have done but for the war. If the string tying him to politics survived at all, it was largely thanks to his father's old boss, Clem Attlee -- who, as prime minister, not only arranged for the son of his former faithful parliamentary private secretary to edit his speeches but also (much more surprisingly in so modest a man) authorized him to write the first official biography to be published of him. The result, 'Mr Attlee: an Interim Biography', did not come out until 1948 and, apart from representing its author's debut in this particular literary form, has little to commend it (although Jenkins himself remained strangely proud of it to the end of his life and especially of having written it, mainly at odd moments, within the space of a calendar year). Having published it, he did, though, candidly admit that he would never again attempt a 'living' subject, a rule he adhered to in the course of the seven subsequent political biographies that he produced. 
By the time his first biography was published Jenkins was in fact already within striking distance of achieving his primary ambition of becoming a member of parliament. In March 1948 John Martin, the somewhat obscure Labour MP for Southwark Central, announced that ill health left him with no option but to retire -- he nevertheless managed to live for another thirty-five years -- and, proof perhaps that his loyalist book had done him no harm, the prime minister's young biographer found himself encouraged by party officials to apply for the vacancy. It was not, to be blunt, a particularly attractive opening: the constituency was due to be amalgamated with its neighbour, Southwark East, in time for the next general election -- and the sitting member for the latter constituency had already secured the agreement of officials of the London Labour Party that whoever gained the nomination for Southwark Central would not be allowed to enter the lists for the new combined seat of Southwark at the expected 1950 general election. 
The competition for, at best, a two-year ticket of admission to the House of Commons, therefore, was not strong, and at the selection conference held on 23 March 1948 the now 27-year-old Jenkins found himself facing a single opponent, a local Southwark alderman who, as Jenkins pithily put it in his memoirs, 'had some friends but more enemies' ('A Life at the Centre', 71). Whether because of that or not, he was fortunate enough to sail through, gaining the support of twenty of the twenty-eight delegates present (the contrast in numbers providing striking evidence of the relative strengths of Labour membership in inner city seats such as Southwark Central as compared with the party's then industrial fortresses like Pontypool in south Wales). At least his slightly 'rotten borough' success at Southwark meant that the youthful potential politician had achieved his life's ambition, and in fairly creditable circumstances (becoming 'baby' of the house when he arrived there on 4 May 1948, and retaining that position until another by-election victor, the future Conservative minister Sir Edward Boyle, was elected for Birmingham, Handsworth, in November 1950). 
At Westminster, despite all the struggle and anxiety to get there, Jenkins, like most new MPs, failed to make any immediate impact. It cannot have helped, at least with his colleagues, that he was inevitably regarded very much as the prime minister's protege -- an impression Attlee did little to dispel by, highly unusually for a head of government, acting as one of the new member's two sponsors on the afternoon he was introduced into the chamber. Subsequently Jenkins was at pains to insist that his real heroes in that first post-war Labour government had been Stafford Cripps and Aneurin Bevan, but at the time he was close to neither of them in the same way that he and his family were to Attlee. The prime minister even became godfather to Jenkins's first son, Charles, when he was born in March 1949, Jennifer's pregnancy providing the cue for the new MP and his wife to move -- inconveniently, as it turned out -- away from their small flat above a snack bar in Marsham Street, Westminster, to a much larger two-floor apartment at the top of a Victorian mansion in Cornwall Gardens, Kensington. 
It may well be that in those early years the not yet thirty-year-old Jenkins, who already possessed a strong competitive streak, fell victim to his own anxieties. His decision to go for the doomed Southwark Central seat meant after all that he had secured himself only a temporary pass into the Commons, not any form of season ticket. This worry appears for a period to have preyed upon his mind. Certainly it was at this time that he took himself off to see a psychiatrist, who pronounced that while he took the young politician's anxieties seriously he saw no reason why he should not survive for a normal lifespan provided he was content to lead a quiet life and spared himself any unnecessary psychological strain or nervous pressure. It was perhaps typical of the amused candour with which he tended to regard his various vicissitudes that Jenkins himself should have gone out of his way to record this faintly bizarre advice in the autobiography that he wrote some forty years later. 
In fact, the anxiety about the immediate future apart, the young politician -- having at last entered the promised land -- found his new life thoroughly agreeable. Within a few months of being elected an MP he had been invited by Philip Noel-Baker, the secretary of state for Commonwealth relations, to become his parliamentary private secretary -- an offer he eagerly accepted not so much on the ground that he had any special interest in the area of policy covered by that particular cabinet department but rather because, as he put it frankly, 'I was keen to have a foot even on the lowest rung of the ladder of office' ('A Life at the Centre', 76). He did not, though, manage to maintain that foothold for long. When, in February 1950, Noel-Baker was shunted out of the cabinet to become minister of fuel and power, the demoted former secretary of state prudently resolved that in his new domestic role he would need to have a miners' MP as his parliamentary private secretary and consequently asked Jenkins to step down. Having attained his objective of getting some inkling of how a government department worked, the youthful MP for Southwark Central appears to have agreed to do so without rancour or regret (and maybe even with a measure of relief). When, a month or two later, the minister of supply, George Strauss, asked Jenkins to take up a similar position with him, the invitation to serve as a dogsbody for the second time round was politely declined. 
Another explanation could have been that the young political apprentice -- however ambitious -- already had a second string to his bow, and one that increasingly was taking up a good deal of his time and attention. Once 'Mr Attlee: an Interim Biography' had been published in the spring of 1948, Jenkins had almost immediately started work on a more ambitious project that, under the title of 'Mr Balfour's Poodle', aimed to tell the story of the legendary struggle between H. H. Asquith's Liberal government and the House of Lords over David Lloyd George's 'people's budget' of 1909 (it was, in fact, a phrase of Lloyd George's that provided the title for Jenkins's second work). The book did not come out until February 1954 but that was partly because its author had taken up more contemporary political themes in the meantime. In 1951 -- demonstrating, incidentally, that his moorings were not exclusively on the right wing of the Labour Party -- Jenkins produced a 7000 word 'Tribune' pamphlet advocating a programme of stringent taxation of capital (to which Michael Foot, 'Tribune''s editor, gave the ironic title 'Fair Shares for the Rich'). A few months later Jenkins followed that initiative up with a more considered article, 'Equality', in the 1952 volume of 'New Fabian Essays', and a year after that produced a frankly propagandist work entitled 'Pursuit of Progress', in which he sought to reconcile the spirit of impatient utopianism within the Labour Party with the rival ethos of practical reformism. If it scarcely ranks as one of Jenkins's more solid works, it at least demonstrated that even when his head began to turn towards the right the romantic left still operated a sufficient hold upon his heart for him not to want to provoke any unnecessary conflict between the two. 
When, if only at the eleventh hour -- in October 1949, just four months before the February 1950 general election -- Jenkins secured his parliamentary future by obtaining the Labour nomination in the newly constituted seat of Stechford in his old stamping ground of Birmingham -- he continued to maintain a surprisingly independent position in the internal politics of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). This was partly because he found the company of left-wingers much more invigorating than that of their more stolid right-wing colleagues. For a time at the beginning of the 1950s he even formed part of a canasta school, meeting illicitly in the vaults of the Palace of Westminster, where his card-playing companions included such future prominent followers of Aneurin Bevan as John Freeman, Tom Driberg, and Hugh Delargy. It was only Bevan's dramatic resignation from the second Attlee government in April 1951 that persuaded Jenkins that he would have to decide on which side of the great divide he stood -- and even then he took his time, waiting for Bevan's increasingly strident attacks on Gaitskell, who had succeeded Stafford Cripps as chancellor in October 1950, before formally identifying himself with the Gaitskellite cause. But the conversion when it came was complete -- although, as he admitted in his memoirs, he was full of envy for those few Labour MPs who managed to maintain convivial relations with Bevan while disagreeing with his politics profoundly. 
The unequivocal stand that Jenkins took from the early days of the Bevanite revolt required some courage. In most of the party's great disputes of the time, such as the running battle over German rearmament, he found himself at odds with his new constituency party, even if the leading figures in Stechford showed sufficient forbearance never to press their disagreements with their MP to the point of divorce. This restraint was all the more creditable since Jenkins, although he was to hold the seat for twenty-six years, hardly enjoyed the reputation of being a notably conscientious MP. More a once-a-month than a once-a-week visitor, he maintained no home in the constituency, preferring to stay with two party activists (suggesting perhaps that he had learned something from his early experience at Aston) and, although always energetic enough at election times (including those for Birmingham city council), somehow consistently contrived to wear his responsibilities as the senior Labour member for Birmingham, as he ultimately became, pretty lightly. Perhaps unfairly, one of his younger former colleagues in parliament later recalled how, as the train on which they were both travelling drew out of New Street station, he once remarked with unmistakable feeling: 'Don't you always feel an enormous sense of relief when you leave this place?' (A. Watkins, 'Brief Lives', 1982, 75); the MP, though unnamed, was Brian Walden. 
The truth, of course, was that in sharp contrast to his father Jenkins did not take long to establish himself as a predominantly metropolitan figure. The job he took to supplement his parliamentary salary (from 1946 to 1954 only $1000 per annum) was as a consultant to the John Lewis Partnership, which meant spending one to one-and-a-half days a week in the company's headquarters above its Oxford Street store. (Jenkins was to remain a John Lewis adviser for longer than any other post he ever held, apart from the chancellorship of Oxford University, being associated with the partnership, latterly as director of financial operations, for eleven years until he joined the Wilson government in October 1964.) 
Necessarily, especially after the death in 1953 of his mother, who never moved away from Pontypool, Jenkins's interests became focused more and more upon London. The births of a daughter, Cynthia, in 1951 and a second son, Edward, in 1954 persuaded both Jenkins and his wife to leave Cornwall Gardens and buy a substantial house on the south side of Ladbroke Square, just down the hill from Notting Hill Gate. Encouraged by the faded grandeur of their new surroundings (which included access to one of the largest communal gardens in London, complete with a tennis court) the young and always gregarious politician embarked on a fairly extensive programme of entertaining, with the new Labour Party leader, Hugh Gaitskell, and his wife, Dora, being among the most frequent guests. Politically Jenkins was now firmly marked down as a Gaitskellite and -- although he rather competed with his old friend Tony Crosland for the position of court favourite -- his enjoyment of the approval of the new management that took over the Labour Party from Attlee in 1955 was never in any doubt. 
Paradoxically, however, this did Jenkins's career prospects little good. Gaitskell, rather like President John F. Kennedy, always liked to separate his genuine friends from his working colleagues, and Jenkins, who had to wait until November 1959 even to be appointed to a junior role on the opposition front bench (he resigned from being part of the Treasury team only seven months later), proved no exception to that rule. As he ruefully commented, throughout most of the years of the Gaitskell leadership 'my position in the political hierarchy hardly advanced at all' (A. Watkins, 'Backbencher', 'Jenkins', ed. Adonis and Thomas, 47). But for that he was at least partly to blame. Politics is a jealous taskmistress and colleagues tend to look askance if they detect a member of their own fraternity dispersing his energies too widely. During the 1950s Jenkins would certainly have had to plead guilty to that charge. In addition to his responsibilities at the John Lewis Partnership he produced a highly praised and commercially successful follow-up to 'Mr Balfour's Poodle' in 'Sir Charkes Dilke: a Victorian Tragedy' in 1959 and started writing his classic 'Asquith' (which came out in 1964) in the same year. As if that were not enough, he had taken naturally to the life of higher journalism, writing regularly for Ian Gilmour's 'Spectator' in 1957-60 and contributing after that to David Astor's 'Observer', for which he wrote long, distinguished 'review fronts' (including a notable one on the papal election of 1963), to say nothing of becoming one of the star book reviewers on that newspaper's then illustrious literary pages. Perhaps not surprisingly, the impression began to take root among his more serious-minded colleagues that he was, at best, a dilettante politician, either unwilling or unable to bring to the pursuit of his calling the exclusive dedication that it demanded of them. 
If anything, that reputation was underlined by what he actually chose to do within the House of Commons. There also he contrived to appear as somehow a peripheral politician -- more interested, say, in piloting on behalf of the Society of Authors an 'Obscene Publications Bill' (designed to curb censorship and increase literary freedom) through its various legislative stages than in taking part in the daily hurly-burly of inter-party combat. He did, though, some hard work each summer under Gaitskell's leadership on the committee stage of the 'Finance Bill' and no one denied that he was both an eloquent and elegant Commons performer: what remained in doubt, since promotion and preferment had been denied to him, was the extent of his partisan commitment. Moreover, within the ranks of his own party, there were darker suspicions in play. When, for example, on the eve of the 1959 general election he wrote in 'The Spectator' -- uncannily foreshadowing the formation of the Alliance in the early 1980s -- that 'on a whole range of foreign, colonial and libertarian issues the best and most dominant Liberals now see completely eye-to-eye with the Labour Party... the overwhelming need is to channel the anti-Tory vote into the most effective channels' ('The Spectator', 25 Sept 1959), it must be doubted whether he was commending himself even to Hugh Gaitskell. 
Yet his admiration for Gaitskell remained the most constant factor in Jenkins's political outlook -- even their eventual disagreement over the desirability of Britain entering the European Economic Community (EEC) only threatened and did not rupture their friendship, which remained for Jenkins the most important relationship he had in politics. It was this that made Gaitskell's death at the age of only fifty-six in January 1963 so devastating a blow. Jenkins was away at the time in the United States, writing a piece for 'The Observer' looking back on the Cuban missile crisis of a year earlier, but, having stoutly defended Gaitskell against the leadership challenge made to him by Harold Wilson in 1960, his advice to the rump of forlorn Gaitskellites gathered in London was firm and unequivocal: they might all separately have their own ideas about who should be his successor -- for his part, he would certainly be voting for Gaitskell's deputy, George Brown -- but the one option not open to any of them was to support the man who had sought to be the dead leader's usurper. The second part of his advice was heeded by the other Gaitskellite MPs but the first was not: many of them felt such apprehension about electing the volatile deputy leader that they saw themselves as compelled to look elsewhere for a third candidate (who eventually materialized in the shape of the shadow chancellor, James Callaghan). Jenkins, though, was right to suspect that all Callaghan's intervention would achieve would be to prevent any momentum building up behind Brown as the only man capable of defeating Wilson within the PLP. On the first ballot Brown got only 88 votes to Wilson's 115 with Callaghan trailing the field on 41, while on the second, and decisive, run-off Wilson beat Brown by 144 votes to 103. There followed perhaps the bleakest period in Jenkins's political life. 
Wilson certainly had little reason to do anything to help Jenkins, being only too aware (everything else apart) that there had in 1960 been a half-baked scheme on Gaitskell's part to evict Wilson from the shadow chancellorship and install Jenkins in his place. The plot, if that was what it was (Jenkins always claimed not even to know about it), did not work, and the following year Gaitskell was reduced to making Wilson shadow foreign secretary and appointing the relatively untried Callaghan to head the opposition Treasury team. 
Yet in politics it is often the unexpected event that determines the future -- and so it proved in this case. To his genuine surprise, Jenkins found himself in July 1963 being sounded out as to whether he would be prepared to accept the position of being the next editor of 'The Economist'. The approach came primarily from the editorial staff and it is not certain that it had been sanctioned by the paper's controlling company, the Financial Times. But it certainly had all the appearance of being a genuine invitation and it was in that spirit that a depressed Jenkins, by now thoroughly disillusioned with party politics, entertained it. He did not, though, rush his fences, telling both the chairman of 'The Economist', Geoffrey Crowther, and the intermediary who had first approached him, Norman Macrae, the paper's assistant editor, that he would like a month or so to reflect upon the offer. 
That proved to be a prudent precaution for, on the advice of a long-standing friend, Marie-Alice de Beaumarchais (whom Jennifer and he were later to get to know even better as the wife of the French ambassador in London), Jenkins took the decision to place his dilemma before the party leader, Harold Wilson. There were to be many ups and downs in their relationship but it is possible to believe that the seeds of what eventually became a wary mutual respect were planted in this unusual confrontation between the two of them. Certainly, to Jenkins's surprise, Wilson reacted 'with immense consideration' ('A Life at the Centre', 150) to what he was told, letting his erstwhile dedicated opponent know that he would quite understand if he accepted the 'Economist' offer but at the same time insisting that he would 'deeply regret it' (ibid., 151). He also said with complete candour and some courage that, while he could not see there being an immediate place for Jenkins in any cabinet that he formed, there would certainly be a middle-rank job within such a government and that from there 'the road to promotion would be wide open' (ibid., 151). 
By any judgement it was a generous response, and it had the effect of stopping Jenkins from abandoning the life of politics for that of political commentary. (It probably helped that 'The Economist' was just the type of 'bien pensant' publication for which Wilson tended to have an exaggerated respect.) But, even after his conversation with his party leader, Jenkins did not rejoin the opposition front bench -- which he had left just two years earlier while Gaitskell was still leader -- and the 1964 general election was the last one in which he found himself fighting as a purely local candidate defending his own constituency. In a straight fight with the Conservatives, as the contest had also been in 1959, he put up the Labour majority from 2923 to 5388 and, despite the narrowness of Labour's overall victory (in the Commons the new government had a majority of just four seats), drove back to London in a confidently expectant mood. 
At first, however, there was simply silence -- Wilson, understandably, was preoccupied with the choice of his first cabinet and he had already warned Jenkins that his name would not feature in it. Eventually the aspiring young minister learned of his destiny not from the prime minister but from his deputy, George Brown, who, in recognition perhaps of the way Jenkins had stood by him in the leadership election twenty-one months earlier, summoned him round to his flat near Marble Arch and told him that the next morning he would be offered the post of minister of aviation. 
To Jenkins this was good news since it meant he would be in charge of his own department (if one outside the cabinet) and that he would not be directly subordinate to a senior minister. He was also shrewd enough to realize that his was a department in which a number of key decisions, such as over the future of the Concorde supersonic project, would need to be made and that he would come to such questions not entirely without background knowledge -- by good fortune, his last commission for 'The Observer' only three months earlier had been to write a long article on the problems of the British aircraft industry (it was, indeed, this review front piece that had first placed in Wilson's mind the notion of appointing Jenkins to aviation). 
Having been sworn of the privy council on 24 October 1964, three days after his ministerial appointment, Jenkins in no time began to emerge as a firm and determined minister who knew his own mind and did not shrink from taking tough decisions, even when they involved entering the kind of bilateral minefield that, under a formal treaty, governed the Anglo-French development of Concorde. The original plan, reached by incoming cabinet ministers in the new government, had been to cancel the project but, given the punitive nature of the penalty clauses involved, the freshly appointed aviation minister felt he had no choice but to fight a long-drawn-out delaying action which eventually granted the world's much-vaunted first supersonic airliner a reprieve. The subsequent sad history of Concorde, and in particular the failure to sell it to other airlines around the world, was not such as to suggest that this decision was indubitably right. But, after one bad, initial wobble in December 1964, in which he allowed himself to be quoted in 'The Observer' as saying that the whole supersonic project was 'a dead duck', Jenkins, helped materially by at least two debating triumphs in the Commons, ensured both that the plane survived and that his own reputation flourished. There had consequently to be savings elsewhere -- the bulk of the cuts falling on the manufacture of military aircraft such as the P-1154, the HS-681, and even ultimately the TSR-2 -- but that did not alter the fact that within a year the 'ingenu' minister of aviation had emerged as one of the most determined departmental warriors in Whitehall. 
Jenkins had also demonstrated that he was a politician with the long view. When Patrick Gordon Walker, an old Gaitskellite whom Wilson had defiantly appointed as foreign secretary in the face of his defeat in his west midland constituency of Smethwick at the October 1964 general election, failed again to win a seat in parliament at a by-election at Leyton in January 1965, a cabinet reshuffle became inevitable. Jenkins had no reason to believe he would be involved in it until, on the morning after Gordon Walker's second defeat at the polls, he got a phone call. The chairman of the PLP, Emanuel Shinwell, merely wanted to pass on the intelligence that he had that morning been consulted by the prime minister as to who should be the next foreign secretary and that he had recommended Jenkins for the job. He, therefore, asked for an assurance that, if the post were offered, Jenkins would not refuse it -- an undertaking that, hardly surprisingly, was immediately forthcoming. 
Fighting a losing battle with his initial disbelief, Jenkins was due that morning to attend a meeting of the overseas and defence committee of the cabinet at number 10. All seemed depressingly normal and, although the prime minister presided, he betrayed no sign of wanting to speak privately to the only non-cabinet member present. Jenkins thus returned to his own department no longer merely mystified but marginally mortified as well. Any mood of depression was, though, immediately banished by his private secretary announcing that number 10 had been on the phone and that the prime minister urgently needed to talk to him. As Jenkins wrote in his memoirs twenty-five years later: 'For the first time I took Shinwell's telephone call wholly seriously and ingested the thought, unbelievable though it seemed on any previous basis, that Wilson was going to make me Foreign Secretary' ('A Life at the Centre', 168-9). 
It proved, of course, a false assumption. When Jenkins arrived at number 10 it was only to be asked to wait and then to learn casually from Jim Callaghan -- who happened to be passing as the aspiring successor to Curzon and Balfour was still loitering in the little hall outside the cabinet room -- that Michael Stewart, the minister of education, was already inside. That could mean only one thing: it was the reversion to Stewart's job at education, and not the foreign secretaryship, that was going to be offered to him. Of course, that was a disappointment but even the latter offer would mean immediate promotion to the cabinet -- with engaging honesty Jenkins was later to admit that, if at their eventual cabinet room interview later that morning, the prime minister had required an answer there and then, he would in all probability have said 'yes' ('A Life at the Centre', 170). But Wilson never made that demand and Jenkins was therefore able to get away with a request for time to consider the matter over lunch -- something that Wilson a little grudgingly conceded, saying that he would need an answer by 2 p.m. Jenkins's instinctive reaction was revealing: it was to call home and ask his wife, Jennifer, to come from Ladbroke Square and join him for a sandwich lunch in his office. There she urged acceptance of the prime minister's invitation -- but the more Jenkins himself thought about it, the less inclined to make the suggested move he became. The clincher for him seems to have been projecting his mind forward to Monday morning, wondering how he would feel if he found himself walking up the steps of the Ministry of Education in Curzon Street rather than returning to his old office overlooking the Thames Embankment and concluding that he would feel 'more regret for Aviation than enthusiasm for Education' (ibid.). 
In the prime minister's room in the House of Commons Jenkins therefore explained to Wilson why he was not disposed to make the suggested move, even though that was bound to mean staying outside the cabinet and seeing someone else enter it. When that 'someone else' proved to be his own old friend Tony Crosland he could not stop himself from giving way to second thoughts. Yet he did not just harbour these: characteristically, he did something about them. The next day all the newspapers carried the announcement of Crosland's appointment to education but their information did not stop there. Almost without exception, they reported that the former economic secretary to the Treasury had been promoted only after Roy Jenkins, the two-years-younger minister of aviation, had turned the cabinet post down. It was a vivid illustration of just how strong the competitive element was in Jenkins's make-up -- for that information had not come from number 10 but rather from the new public relations adviser, John Harris, whom Jenkins had that weekend appointed to join the staff of his private office. (Harris had previously been serving the unfortunate Gordon Walker at the Foreign Office.) 
In one sense that was not an episode from which Jenkins emerged with much credit, as he himself in later years was always the first to admit. But, viewed in the round, it could equally be said to illustrate one of his strengths as a politician: his acceptance that the long-distance runner always starts with something of an advantage over the sprinter in politics. That was certainly what this incident showed. For within fifteen months of being appointed to the Ministry of Aviation -- and less than a year after turning down the move to education -- the figure who had started out as just about the most irreconcilable of all the old Gaitskellites was installed in one of the great, historic offices of Whitehall, that of secretary of state for the Home Department. 
This time it did not come about by mishap or chance. Discovering from a government colleague that Wilson took the view that the Home Office was not a job that Jenkins would ever want, the latter took his courage in his hands and went to see the prime minister in order to point out how profoundly mistaken and even ill informed he was. (A Penguin paperback that Jenkins had brought out just before the 1964 election, 'The Labour Case', had been substantially concerned with what in those days were known as 'Home Office issues'.) Relieved to hear what his visitor told him, the prime minister let the unguarded words 'Well, that makes it all much easier' slip from his lips, leading Jenkins to assume that he could confidently look forward to taking over from the already frail Sir Frank Soskice at the Home Office in fairly short order. But prime ministers do not like to be hurried and a few unhelpful 'leaks' suggesting Jenkins already had the job in the bag ensured that it was not until just before Christmas that the biographer of Asquith took over responsibility for the department that his subject had once run. 
Already there were those eager to draw comparisons between the two men's careers, and these were not always designed to be helpful. Nor was it at all the case that with his arrival as her majesty's 'principal secretary of state' (as Rab Butler, relying on history, always took pains to describe himself) the highway to number 10 lay open before Jenkins. Neither of his immediate predecessors, Henry Brooke for the Conservatives and Sir Frank Soskice for Labour, had qualified as a great success, and to find a home secretary who had gone on to be prime minister it was then necessary to go all the way back to Winston Churchill. The Home Office had in fact acquired a reputation of being a graveyard for politicians -- and it is against that somewhat gloomy background that Jenkins's astonishing performance presiding over it for just under two years needs to be measured. 
It was certainly not a case of Jenkins avoiding troubles or ducking out of difficulties: crises, ranging from the escape of the Soviet master spy George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs in October 1966 to the sinking of the American oil tanker the 'Torrey Canyon' off the Scilly Isles at Easter 1967, crowded in upon him almost from the moment he took up office. What distinguished Jenkins from his immediate predecessors, though, was his determination actually to achieve reforms. He managed to persuade himself that he had heard 'a liberal hour' strike and was determined to make use of it to introduce a whole range of enabling, empowering legislation. It thus came about that the years 1965-7 -- admittedly, largely through private member's bills facilitated by Jenkins -- witnessed an almost complete overhaul of Britain's social mores. The divorce laws were reformed, the legal treatment of homosexuals was made much less oppressive, abortion on demand accepted within legal and medical limits, and even the traditional theatrical censorship exercised by the lord chamberlain abolished. As a result Jenkins was later sometimes reproached for having created 'the permissive society'; but what he had, in effect, done was to introduce altogether more civilized standards into British life. 
Jenkins's first spell as home secretary was undeniably the high point of his career until that date, and some might be tempted to say that nothing he did later (certainly not his second reluctant spell at the Home Office in 1974-6) surpassed it. He enjoyed regular debating triumphs in the House of Commons -- a particularly notable one being against Quintin Hogg in the debate on the George Blake escape from prison -- and became in addition the government's principal plenipotentiary on social legislation to the enlightened part of the electorate. It helped too that he started to assume some of the trappings of a great man, even following the example of his hero Asquith in buying a country home in Berkshire, the old vicarage, St Amand's House, at East Hendred (from 1974 in Oxfordshire), with its croquet lawn and tennis court, soon becoming almost a rival to Asquith's former Thames Valley home, The Wharf at Sutton Courtenay, in the amount of political entertaining that it witnessed. And, fittingly, it was the money he made from the publication of 'Asquith' that had made this spreading of the Jenkins family's wings to the countryside possible. 
Against this background of a neo-Edwardian lifestyle, it was perhaps surprising that Jenkins should have got on with Wilson as easily as he did. True, they shared some interests in common -- a passionate appetite for railway timetables being one of them. But their tastes remained markedly different, the prime minister being, for example, essentially a high-tea man while Jenkins always preferred a proper dinner. This was one of the differences that came out once they started living next door to one another in Downing Street towards the end of 1967 -- Jenkins growing increasingly to dread a summons for 'an evening chat' in the study of number 10 since it invariably ended with too much whisky having been drunk and no food of any kind being in sight. But in Jenkins's mind none of this mattered as compared with the debt that he came to realize he owed to Wilson -- something that he became especially aware of after the prime minister offered him his great opportunity by appointing him chancellor of the exchequer in succession to Callaghan in the wake of the sterling devaluation of November 1967. In taking that step Wilson must have known that he was gambling with his own future: the very qualities that led the prime minister to prefer Jenkins to Callaghan's candidate, Tony Crosland -- his command of the Commons, his proven ability to turn the tables on his critics in debate, the natural authority that he brought to the delivery of broadcasts -- were precisely the same ones that could be seen as constituting a threat to Wilson. In fact, as neighbours in numbers 10 and 11 the two men rubbed along pretty well -- most of the mischief being made by the more devoted acolytes of each rather than by the two principals themselves. (There were, though, exceptions even to that rule: Marcia Williams, the prime minister's dedicated political secretary, was always a doughty defender of Jenkins and the chancellor's Man Friday, John Harris, reciprocated in kind with his own high regard for Williams, though not for Wilson himself.) 
When he became chancellor in November 1967 Jenkins would have been less than human if he had failed to wonder whether he might not have been handed a poisoned chalice. But, as his sense of realism probably told him, there are worse places to come in than at the bottom of the market. After devaluation there was only one obvious way for Britain's economic prospects to go -- and that was up. The new chancellor did, however, have to wait a long time for any break in the clouds to appear, and it was at least a year before he could be confident that the worst was behind him. From the spring of 1969 onwards, though, it became fairly clear that the economic corner had been turned and Jenkins's own position within the government became measurably stronger as a result. In his old age he himself became convinced that he had probably been nearer to the premiership in 1968-9 than he would be at any other stage of his career -- but as he expressively wrote in the penultimate paragraph of his autobiography: 'I may have avoided doing too much stooping but I also missed conquering' ('A Life at the Centre', 622). That was partly due to his own temperament, much closer to that of Asquith than to anyone else who had since got to number 10. As he put it slightly more ruefully in that same volume of memoirs: 'People who effectively seize the prime ministership -- Lloyd George, Macmillan, Mrs Thatcher -- do not let such moments slip' (ibid., 260). 
But there was never any doubt from 1968 onwards, especially after the resignation of George Brown, the party's deputy leader, from the Foreign Office in March of that year, that Jenkins was the acknowledged second figure within the government. His tough budgets of 1968 and 1969 if anything reinforced his authority, which began to be somewhat equivalent to that of Stafford Cripps in 1947-50. Only one external development undermined his position, and that was the dispute which arose with the trade unions over Barbara Castle's proposals for union reform contained in her white paper of January 1969, 'In Place of Strife'. A strong supporter of this initiative -- if only because it promised to get him and the Treasury off the hook of trying to maintain a prices and incomes policy for a third successive year -- Jenkins was undeniably bruised by being forced to withdraw his endorsement from it once it became clear that opposition to it within the parliamentary party was such that it could not be got through the Commons division lobbies. Once again Jenkins never sought to disguise his own sense of shame, writing twenty years later: 'It was a sad episode from which he [Wilson] and Barbara Castle emerged with more credit than the rest of us' ('A Life at the Centre', 290). 
If one thing adversely affected Jenkins's long-term prospects after his less than heroic behaviour over 'In Place of Strife' it was the resurgence in the fortunes of the home secretary, Jim Callaghan. He had led the charge both within the parliamentary party and on the national executive against the prime minister's and the first secretary's trade union proposals, and their defeat was necessarily his victory. The restoration of Callaghan's reputation was a bad blow to Jenkins, since it meant that there was no longer just a single viable alternative to Wilson but rather two rival contenders. For the last months of the 1966-70 Labour government the prime minister played off the claims of his two rival potential challengers with consummate skill. 
In his final weeks at the Treasury the chancellor also came under some criticism for not following the traditionally cynical strategy of a 'giveaway' budget just before an election. Although Jenkins's April 1970 budget was easily the most lenient of the three he produced, it released only some $150 million into the economy and was thought by some even of his cabinet colleagues to reflect far more the chancellor's own desire to preserve his reputation for probity than to enhance the party's prospects at the general election. Jenkins himself displayed little patience with this criticism, arguing that his 1970 budget 'caught the political mood better than a more generous Budget would have done' ('A Life at the Centre', 292). And in that he was almost certainly right. The factors that undermined Labour at the 1970 general election -- the sharp turndown in the balance of trade figures, thanks to the purchase by British Airways of two jumbo jets, which only surfaced on the last weekend of the campaign, to say nothing of the deep despondency caused by England's defeat at the hands of West Germany in the quarter-final of the world cup held on the Sunday before polling day -- took some time to come into play. Indeed, if any one factor defeated Labour, it was probably its own overwhelming sense of complacency (as only too vividly reflected in the prime minister's almost monarchical national tour). 
For his part Jenkins fought an energetic national campaign, delivering speeches in places as far apart as Plymouth, Glasgow, and Manchester, as well as giving one of the Labour Party's five TV election broadcasts, and he appears to have been convinced until the end that victory was well within grasp. (He had, in fact, already accepted the post of foreign secretary in any post-election Labour government, calculating that in any eventual leadership race, if he could cite experience at the Home Office, the Treasury, and the Foreign Office, he would hold a virtually unbeatable hand.) The actual election result, in which Edward Heath achieved a Conservative majority of thirty-one, thus came as a profound shock and removed arguably the best chance Jenkins had of becoming prime minister in any conventional way. (Wilson had already told him that, if the government were re-elected, he would not want to remain in number 10 indefinitely.) 
Nevertheless, the first signs were that Jenkins's personal fortunes had hardly foundered. In July 1970, as a result of George Brown losing his seat of Belper at the general election, Jenkins was comfortably elected to be Labour's next deputy leader, easily defeating both Michael Foot and the new leader of the house, Fred Peart, on the first ballot. (Jim Callaghan, who already held the post of party treasurer, the gift of the annual conference, cannily stayed out of the contest.) It did not take long, however, for the threat to emerge that would eventually overturn the entire Jenkins dream of his political future. 
In 1967 the Labour government, with Jenkins's enthusiastic support, had applied to join the EEC, only to see its application vetoed by President de Gaulle of France. After the election Wilson had planned to revive the application -- de Gaulle having meanwhile departed from the French presidency -- but now that option necessarily fell to Heath, who lost no time in announcing that Britain would once more apply to join. This faced Wilson and the Labour Party with a dilemma: given the split within the tories' own ranks on the issue, should Labour make things easy for Heath by supporting his application (just as he had backed the Labour one three years earlier) or did the imperatives of opposition politics demand that they try to put every obstacle in his way (if not over the principle, then at least over the terms that a Conservative government managed to secure)? 
Perhaps predictably, Wilson came down in favour of the latter course, leaving Labour's 'pro-Europeans' (who numerically were stronger than the Conservative 'antis') with a conflict of loyalties. Two successive Labour conferences were held at which a certain amount of blood was spilt but the issue had still not been resolved when the time came in October 1971 for Heath to put his bill authorizing signature to the treaty of accession before the House of Commons. The government whips then did a rather shrewd thing, letting it be known that a free vote would be granted to all tory MPs on what was essentially a debate culminating in a decision on principle. Labour, however, refused to follow suit, issuing a three-line whip to all Labour MPs requiring them to vote against the government. As a tactic, this totally misfired. Refusing to be bludgeoned into abandoning their convictions, no fewer than sixty-nine Labour MPs, led by Jenkins, joined the bulk of the government supporters in the 'aye' lobby, while another twenty abstained, yielding the tory prime minister a comfortable majority of 112 in favour of the United Kingdom throwing in its lot with Europe. 
As deputy leader, Jenkins immediately became the target of most of the loyalists' fury. For a back-bench MP to vote against the party line was one thing; for someone holding the number two position within the party's hierarchy to do the same was quite another. It was therefore a tribute to the hold his talents still exercised over his colleagues' minds that just one month later Jenkins should have been re-elected deputy leader -- even if this time it did require a run-off to secure a result. On the first ballot, declared on 10 November 1971, Jenkins had 140 votes to Michael Foot's 96 and Tony Benn's 46, thus being three votes short of a clearcut majority. But the second ballot, held a week later, revealed a less convincing victory: 140 votes again (for Jenkins) to 126 (for Foot), Benn having meanwhile been eliminated. 
At the time even that slightly ambivalent result was received with great relief by what were now being openly called 'the Jenkinsites'. But there can really be no doubt that the decision to stand again for the deputy leadership in the wake of the great European rebellion was a mistake. Having made the one symbolic gesture open to him, Jenkins, as deputy leader, found himself held virtually in protective custody, required night after night to vote against individual clauses in a government bill that he actually supported. He resigned from the shadow cabinet and as deputy leader in April 1972, ostensibly in a protest against the party coming out in favour of holding a referendum designed to accept or reject whatever terms were finally obtained, but in reality because he was sick at heart at all the humiliations he had already been put through. Although he took two other members of the shadow cabinet with him -- George Thomson and Harold Lever -- it was something of a botched demarche, removing any last frail chance Jenkins retained of succeeding to the Labour leadership through an orderly process. 
If the truth is that politicians can be divided into two categories -- those who operate riskily on the outside rails and those who can only prosper by hugging the inside track -- then there was never any question as to which classification, despite his occasional penchant for recklessness, Jenkins belonged to. The next eighteen months -- until, with his tail rather between his legs, he rejoined Wilson's shadow cabinet, no longer as shadow chancellor but rather as shadow home secretary in November 1973 -- provided a stark proof of that. He treated the whole process rather as if it were a game of grandmother's footsteps in which he would take a couple of steps forward towards confrontation with Wilson and then rapidly (and clumsily) retreat by at least two further steps in the opposite direction whenever someone threatened to spot what he was up to. He was probably not helped either by some of his minions (both in the media and in parliament) being much more eager for combat than he was; but they were right in that the logic of his position was certainly that he should have stood against Wilson for the leadership in November 1973 and, when he failed to do so (and crawled back to the shadow cabinet instead), both his prestige and his standing were necessarily diminished. 
When Heath made his great blunder of calling 'the miners' election' of February 1974 it was Jenkins's view that not only would Labour not win it but that it did not even deserve to. Wilson's success on polling day in gaining four more seats than the Conservatives in the Commons (though fewer votes in the country) therefore brought his former deputy little joy. Jenkins's gloomy mood was, if anything, accentuated by the fact that it was by no means certain whether an appropriate niche could be found for him in the new government. He still nursed his young man's ambition to be foreign secretary but that, at least in Wilson's eyes, was clearly out of the question in light of Jenkins's passionate pro-European commitment. There remained the Treasury -- and there were some in the prime minister's entourage (including Marcia Williams) who felt strongly that Jenkins should be allowed to go back there. The potential candidate himself, however, refused to make any overt bid for the job, being content that it should go to Denis Healey, who had succeeded him as shadow chancellor after his departure from the opposition front bench in April 1972. Thus, as much by a process of elimination as by anything else, he found himself confronted with the offer of returning to the Home Office where he had last been eight years earlier. It was not a prospect that he approached with much relish -- witness the chapter heading ('A recidivist home secretary') he gave to this portion of his career in his memoirs. Nor, even for the progressive section of the public, was this second coming anything like as exciting or exhilarating as his first arrival in 1965. 
Inevitably, in this third Wilson government, Jenkins could not help looking like a spare wheel on the coach, someone whose undoubted talents were not being used constructively. When he managed to shine, it was most often in unorthodox initiatives, like his personal drafting of the Home Office statement on Northern Ireland's Price sisters, rejecting the hunger strike pressure they were trying to bring to bear in order to get themselves repatriated to Ireland. But what was certainly true was that he seldom, if ever, looked like a minister functioning at maximum capacity. Instead he was someone who tended to attract attention only when he stepped out of line -- as he did, for example, at Haverfordwest in July 1974 when, in a much reported speech, he drew attention to what he took to be the lurch to the left that the Labour Party was then undergoing. One year later, in defiance of his original reservations about the whole constitutional concept, he was also to lead the cross-party campaign for a 'yes' vote in the June 1975 European referendum. 
Conceivably it was recognition of the kind of danger he represented while on such a free rein that caused the prime minister to cast about and see if he could not discover some more fulfilling role for so able but awkward a colleague. When Wilson established that both Valery Giscard d'Estaing (president of France) and Helmut Schmidt (chancellor of West Germany) would be prepared to back the man who had once seemed his own natural successor to be the next (and first British) president of the European Commission in Brussels, he understandably thought that he had cracked the problem. 
At first the implicit invitation to start a new life in Brussels does not appear greatly to have excited Jenkins. For one thing, he knew that it was by no means certain that Wilson would be in any position to deliver -- for he had already learned from the number 10 intimate Lord Goodman (though not from the prime minister himself) that Wilson was planning to retire in March 1976. In time gone by the imparting of such a secret would have galvanized Jenkins into high activity. But it did not do so on this occasion. Indeed, according to his own account, it failed to 'destroy my political lethargy'. This he himself ascribed to a 'debilitating low flu' which he suffered from throughout the latter part of January and well into February ('A Life at the Centre', 430), but it seems possible that a basic disengagement with British politics was already at work as well. In any event, having at first shown little interest in the prime minister's overture, he subsequently wrote to him intending to keep the door at least ajar (not an easy exercise since the one thing he could not own up to was his own knowledge, acquired from Lord Goodman, that when the time came Wilson might not be in any position to formalize the offer). 
In fact, that was precisely how things worked out. When Wilson announced his surprise resignation on 16 March 1976, Jenkins immediately threw his hat into the ring to succeed him. He does not appear to have told any of his supporters of the half-offer to go to Brussels he already had in his back-pocket and -- among six candidates (Callaghan, Foot, himself, Healey, Benn, and Crosland) -- he fought a tenacious campaign to assert his right to the succession. From the beginning the general view was that Callaghan would emerge as the eventual victor with Jenkins possibly as his main rival but when the result of the first ballot was announced on 24 March it was sufficiently crushing for the home secretary to feel compelled to withdraw from the contest. He received a mere fifty-six votes -- at least ten fewer than his campaign manager had led him to expect -- to Callaghan's eighty-four and Foot's unpredicted ninety. (In the last, and conclusive, round of voting Callaghan comfortably defeated Foot by 176 votes to 137.) 
The distribution of government jobs now rested with the new prime minister and, while Jenkins did not seek to hide from the outgoing foreign secretary his ambition to succeed him at the Foreign Office, it did him little good. Callaghan regarded him as altogether too committed and divisive a figure on Europe to hold the post -- Jenkins's successful leading of the pro-Europe forces in the previous summer's referendum campaign was no help here -- and proceeded instead to appoint Jenkins's old friend, and increasingly his rival, Tony Crosland. More perplexing was the new prime minister's decision to make no change at the Treasury, where Denis Healey was beginning to run into the troubles which finally led to the negotiations over the International Monetary Fund loan of the last months of 1976. It was, in fact, at that latter point that Callaghan relented and made an abortive attempt to persuade Jenkins to return as chancellor to Great George Street, but by then the EEC president-designate had become committed to going to Brussels, and it was too late. 
The new prime minister proved, however, very accommodating over how long his departing home secretary should remain in the government, and Jenkins did not finally resign from the Home Office until September. He then embarked on a crash course to prepare himself for his new responsibilities, learning French and studying the whole complex internal structure of the Brussels commission. If he learned one early lesson, it was that a president of the European Commission was not at all in the same position as a British prime minister. When it came to the allocation of responsibilities it was not up to him to say who did what. All sorts of other factors (including the sensitivities of member states) had to be taken into account, and the task of distributing the various portfolios took up most of Jenkins's time and energy before he actually arrived in Brussels on 6 January 1977. What had been an untidy and messy business was more or less settled at a conference held at Ditchley Park in Oxfordshire -- with all potential commissioners and their wives present -- on the weekend before Christmas. The result may not have been everything the new president had wanted, but at least he had the consolation of knowing that it was the best he could obtain. 
As a politician Jenkins brought to the post of president of the European Commission a greater sense of personal style than did most of his predecessors, who had tended to be bureaucrats. The economic recession of the post-1973 oil price rise meant, however, that the 1970s were not a promising decade in which to introduce further integrationist reforms. It was all the more credit to him, therefore, that he managed to secure the agreement of the community (except the United Kingdom) to set up the European monetary system, a first but necessary step towards the introduction of the common currency (whose long-delayed arrival did not take place until the beginning of the twenty-first century). 
At first Jenkins was not particularly happy in Brussels, confessing in his early days that not a single night ever passed without his dreaming of the House of Commons. But once he had won his right of direct representation at Western summits -- a particularly tense battle in which he got no help from Giscard, Schmidt, or (more predictably) Callaghan -- he settled into his new role with greater confidence. What, however, he could not manage to do was to banish Westminster entirely from his mind. His renowned Dimbleby lecture, 'Home thoughts from abroad', arguing, if obliquely, for a realignment of British politics, was delivered on BBC1 on 22 November 1979, before he had even completed three years in the presidency, and from that moment European issues enjoyed no monopoly of interest in his mind. 
Yet Jenkins still contrived to exercise self-discipline. This, paradoxically, was a quality that, contrary to the various legends that clung around him -- his interest in women, which was fully reciprocated, his consumption of drink, particularly claret, his Churchillian fondness until 1983, when he gave up smoking, for Havana cigars -- he much admired and even occasionally practised. Twice Callaghan offered him a peerage but twice he refused it, even though on the second occasion it was accompanied by a query as to whether he could make himself available to become governor of Hong Kong. Jenkins may not have found Brussels life particularly stimulating -- the regular stream of British visitors that came to his door in the rue de Praetere was one proof of that -- but, having set his hand to the plough, he was determined to follow the furrow through to the end. On the other hand, the one idea that he does not seem seriously to have contemplated was renewing his presidency after the first four-year term. The notion of extending his term may have been floated by some members of the commission but the inflexible line displayed on European issues by the new British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, soon put paid to that -- and, in any event, there is considerable doubt whether Jenkins himself would even have entertained it. 
Long before the hour of release came with the end of his tour in January 1981, Jenkins's mind had already begun to swing back firmly to British politics. Significantly, from January 1980 onwards, mention of discussions over what was always cautiously referred to as 'the new party' began to surface in his 'European diary', a record of his period at the commission that he kept throughout his four years there but which had to wait for publication until 1989. What emerges clearly is that, from the beginning, Jenkins was the prime mover behind the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Perhaps, however, that was not altogether surprising. Unlike the other three Labour politicians usually credited with founding the SDP -- David Owen, Bill Rodgers, and Shirley Williams -- Jenkins was already footloose in terms of party affiliation (although entitled to a postal vote in the 1979 general election he had not even bothered to exercise it, a discovery that caused some consternation within the Labour Party when it leaked out some time after polling day). The truth was that Jenkins had gradually grown estranged from his political roots -- and the initial period in Brussels wrestling with the basically anti-European position of the Callaghan government had inevitably increased the pace of that estrangement. By contrast he had while still at the European Commission forged particularly close links with David Steel, the leader of the Liberal Party (and for whose party his wife, Jennifer, had actually voted on election day in May 1979). In fact, Steel possesses a claim to being the true founding father of the SDP, since it was at his insistent advice that Jenkins drew back from joining the Liberals (as had been his original intention) and instead chose to gamble everything on the formation of a new centre party. 
Even at the time of Jenkins's Dimbleby lecture in November 1979 this had not been an embryonic project that commanded universal enthusiasm even among potential supporters -- Jo Grimond, the former Liberal leader, being particularly scathing about it. And as the preparations for launching the new party grew more overt -- as reflected, for example, in Jenkins's follow-up speech to the parliamentary press gallery on 9 June 1980 -- the chorus of discouragement grew, if anything, in strength. If there was a single moment of breakthrough, it probably arrived when Owen, Rodgers, and Williams (or the 'gang of three' as they had now begun to be called) published a collective manifesto as an 'open letter' in both the 'Daily Mirror' and 'The Guardian' on 1 August 1980. It was a development that took place without reference to Jenkins, but he, perhaps more than anyone else, realized its significance. 
That autumn -- occasionally in Brussels but mainly at his Oxfordshire home -- Jenkins became involved in a succession of meetings with the three leading potential defectors (all three of whom, like him, had once been Labour cabinet ministers). At first his addition to the group does not appear to have been given a universal welcome -- with David Owen, in particular, warning him that there could be no future for 'a centre party' along the lines he was suggesting and that anyway the leader of any new political grouping that was formed would, on grounds of her public popularity alone, have to be Shirley Williams. Nevertheless, somehow or other, through the last months of 1980, the 'gang of four' (as it had now inevitably come to be known) hung together -- though it was the Labour Party that ultimately cemented their alliance. After Labour's special conference at Wembley in January 1981 (at which the rules were changed for the election of a party leader, removing that right from Labour MPs and giving it instead to a new electoral college) it was widely assumed to be only a matter of time before the breakaway took place. In fact, the time needed proved to be very short. The very next day, speaking from outside David Owen's house in Limehouse, the gang of four announced the formation of a Council for Social Democracy, immediately recognized as merely a staging post towards the formation of a new political party. 
The Social Democratic Party was formally launched at the Connaught Rooms in London on 26 March 1981 and started off with fourteen former Labour MPs and just one former Conservative member (Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, the tory MP for Norfolk North-West). Yet, despite the fact that he was not in parliament, and had not sat in the Commons since the end of 1976, Jenkins was recognized from the beginning as the new movement's pivotal figure. This popular perception was not, however, an unmixed blessing. It meant that Jenkins immediately came under pressure to get himself back to Westminster -- something that he first attempted at a by-election in the safe Labour seat of Warrington in July 1981 and then achieved at Glasgow Hillhead in March 1982. Three months later the membership of the party in a postal ballot voted for him rather than David Owen (Shirley Williams having meanwhile been steered towards the party presidency) to be its first leader. 
No one will ever know how different the history of the SDP might have been had the 43-year-old Owen rather than the 62-year-old Jenkins been chosen in the party's first (and only) leadership ballot. But by the time of the general election of 1983 (which the SDP fought as the Alliance with the Liberal Party), it had already become clear that among some of his leading colleagues Jenkins was coming to be viewed as a bit of a liability -- hence the somewhat clumsy attempt at the Ettrick Bridge 'summit', presided over by the Liberal leader David Steel and held in the middle of the campaign, to remove him from his already announced but faintly presumptuous position of 'Prime Minister-designate'. Jenkins survived that abortive 'putsch' only to find himself, once the distinctly gloomy election results for the SDP had been announced, confronting a fresh leadership challenge from David Owen. Rather than face him in open combat -- he had won their previous engagement in the summer of 1982 only by the fairly slender margin of 26,256 votes to 20,864 -- Jenkins chose to retire from the party leadership, allowing his rival to be elected unopposed. It was a sad ending to an attempt at a second coming in British politics which had started propitiously enough but which then, thanks to a number of extraneous factors (including Margaret Thatcher's success in the Falklands War), had signally failed to fulfil its early promise. 
Although Jenkins retained his seat at Glasgow Hillhead in the 1983 election -- just about the one cheerful result for the SDP, which despite gaining 11.6 per cent of the national vote saw its representation in the Commons decrease from twenty-nine to six, alongside seventeen seats for Steel's Liberals, on 13.7 per cent of the vote -- the years after the general election effectively marked Jenkins's withdrawal from front-line politics. This was partly due to ill health. Towards the end of 1984 he underwent a prostate operation, with complications that did not really clear up for more than two years. But it also owed something to his disillusionment with the contemporary House of Commons. Although, when fit, he continued to appear there, his inability to cope with insults and interjections from a group of left-wing Labour back-benchers sitting alongside him below the gangway made him lose all relish for the chamber he had once dominated. His relations, too, with his new party leader David Owen remained edgy and, as the rump of the SDP groped its way towards merger with the Liberals -- a prospect favoured by Jenkins but fiercely opposed by Owen -- the gulf between them perceptibly widened. The final detonation of this fundamental difference did not, however, take place until after the 1987 election when Jenkins, having lost his own Glasgow seat to George Galloway (then standing for the Labour Party), took the majority of what was left of the SDP into an arranged marriage with the Liberal Party (initially as the Social and Liberal Democrats, then from 1989 as the Liberal Democrats) while Owen defiantly placed himself at the head of a body called 'the continuing SDP' which survived barely three years before receiving its quietus by running behind even Screaming Lord Sutch's Monster Raving Loony Cavern Rock Party at a by-election held at Bootle in May 1990. 
Superficially Jenkins's career could be said to vindicate Enoch Powell's dictum that 'all political lives end in failure'. Yet any such judgement is singularly inapposite. For his life story affords a rare example of a case in which the best was kept to the last. Had Jenkins retired in 1983, when he lost the leadership of the SDP, or, indeed, in 1987 when he was defeated in the third constituency he had represented in parliament, his various achievements both as a politician and as a writer would certainly have commanded recognition. What lends his career, though, its unique distinction is the purpose to which he put the final fifteen years of his life. His three best-known books -- his own autobiography, 'A Life at the Centre' (1991), his life of Gladstone (1995), and his one-volume biography of Churchill (2001) -- were all written when he was in his seventies. Similarly, the elective office which probably brought him the most pleasure -- his chancellorship of Oxford University, won in a first-past-the-post contest against two distinguished Conservatives, the political historian Lord Blake and his own old Balliol contemporary Edward Heath -- only just predated his forced departure from the Commons. In this role, for fifteen years he officiated at degree ceremonies and other formal functions, welcomed visiting dignitaries, and presided over the university during a period marked by defence of its independence and transformation of its finances. And, even in politics, he could probably claim to have wielded as much influence in the final phase of his career as he had at any other stage, with the possible exception of the latter half of the 1960s. 
Not only, on leaving the Commons, did Jenkins accept a life peerage (as Baron Jenkins of Hillhead) and almost instantly become the leader of, and the highly eloquent spokesman for, the sixty-odd Liberal Democrat peers. He also, even more significantly, became a personal guide and political mentor to, first, the youthful leader of the opposition and then, from 1997, the young prime minister, Tony Blair, who openly saw him (through his founding of the SDP) as the godfather of 'new' Labour -- though Blair contrived to ignore the recommendations of the commission on electoral systems which he appointed Jenkins to chair in 1997, and which reported in 1998. By the end of his life when, among many other honours, he held the presidency of the Royal Society of Literature, Jenkins had become very much the grand old man of British public life, a portly but always lively presence somehow contriving to evoke memories of another, more civilized age, when politics and literature often walked together. His critics sometimes charged him with 'seeing politics very much like Trollope' (Healey, 329), and there may have been a sense in which he was born out of his time -- witness the label often affixed to him of being the last of the whigs. But that he had a considerable impact (more than many prime ministers) on the actual age in which he lived is beyond argument. It was fitting that, exceptionally for a politician who never reached number 10, he was in 1993 singled out for recognition by the queen with the award of the Order of Merit. 
Jenkins died of heart failure at his home, St Amand's House, East Hendred, Oxfordshire, on 5 January 2003 (he had undergone a heart bypass operation at the Wellington Hospital in St John's Wood in the autumn of 2000). His funeral, attended by Tony Blair and his wife, took place in the village church that same week, and he was buried in the village churchyard. A memorial service was subsequently held in Westminster Abbey. His wife and three children survived him.

Knill, Sir John Lawrence (1934-2002), engineering geologist, was born on 22 November 1934 at Hazelhurst, Penn Road, Penn, Wolverhampton, the son of William Cuthbert Knill, water engineer, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Dempsey. He was educated at Whitgift School, Croydon, and Imperial College, London, from where he graduated in 1955 with a first-class honours degree in geology and where he was awarded the Watts medal. He then undertook research on the Dalradian rocks of the south-west highlands of Scotland, graduating PhD (and receiving the Judd prize) in 1957. The same year he married his fellow student Diane Constance Judge, and was appointed assistant lecturer in the department of geology at Imperial College. He and Diane had a son, Patrick, and a daughter, Fiona. 
Knill's career as a practising engineering geologist also commenced in 1957, in Iran, where he worked initially on the hydrogeology of Tehran for Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners. His involvement with Gibb on projects in Iran continued until 1982 and included further work on the Tehran water supply and on dams and hydroelectric projects in the Alborz Mountains. His work on the Latiyan Dam in Iran and on other dams for Gibb formed the basis for his landmark paper on the recording and interpretation of geological conditions in dam foundations, published in 1965. 
After being appointed to the staff of the geology department at Imperial College in 1957, Knill took over the teaching of engineering geology from F. G. H. Blythe. He established the master of science course in engineering geology at Imperial College in 1964. This course soon became regarded as the paramount postgraduate course in engineering geology in the UK and attracted students from the UK and overseas, particularly those with some initial industrial experience. Over the years, many of his students achieved senior positions within industry and government departments throughout the world. The quality of his teaching was greatly enhanced by the strong industrial links that he developed, initially through his contacts with Gibb, but subsequently expanded to include links with a wide range of contractors and consultants in the UK and overseas, many of whom looked to him for advice on practical projects. The department also developed a strong research group working on such topics as the engineering geology of mudrock formations and the experimental, high-pressure consolidation of clays. 
Throughout his career at Imperial College, Knill was active in both college and university life. His academic career culminated in his appointment as professor of engineering geology in 1973. He gave his inaugural lecture, 'Cow Green revisited', on 10 February 1976. At Imperial, he was head of the department of geology (1979-88) and dean of the Royal School of Mines (1980-83). His work within the university included serving as chairman of the University of London board of studies and as a member of the university's academic council. He was also a member of the science sub-committee of the Sultan Qaboos University project in Oman. 
A strong advocate of high professional standards and integrity, Knill convened the Geological Society's Working Group on Professional Geology in 1972 and served as general secretary (1974-8) of the Association for the Promotion of an Institution of Professional Geologists. He became second chairman of the newly created institution in 1979-80, then president from 1981 to 1984. From these roots grew the professional title of chartered geologist (awarded by the Geological Society, following the incorporation of the Institution of Geologists in 1991), with over a thousand geologists qualifying by the time of Knill's death. 
In 1988 Knill left Imperial College to become chairman and chief executive of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for a five-year period. His appointment coincided with a turning point in public and political attitudes towards environmental issues. His period with NERC was characterized by the creation of high-quality, multi-disciplinary research programmes, increased collaboration between the NERC institutes and the higher education sector, and a dramatic resurgence in the fortunes of NERC. On leaving NERC in 1993, he became a freelance engineering geologist, working largely on dispute resolution, risk assessment, and failures associated with dams, tunnels, and slopes in the Middle East, Africa, and the Mediterranean as well as in the UK. During the 1980s and 1990s he was also involved in wider environmental issues at government level, including being appointed by the secretary of state for the environment as a member of the independent Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (1985-95) and as chairman (1987-95). He was also a member of the national co-ordinating committee for the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (1992-5), chairman of the Geological Society conservation committee, and a member of the Nature Conservancy Council (1986-9) and of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1991-6). He served on the council of the National Stone Centre (1984-5). 
Knill retained his close contacts with the academic world and was much in demand as a lecturer and teacher of engineering geology. He retained his chair at Imperial College until 1993, thereafter becoming emeritus professor and senior research fellow. He was appointed visiting professor at Royal Holloway College and was awarded honorary degrees by the universities of Kingston, Nottingham Trent, and East London. He was the author of over 200 scientific papers. Distinctions and honours were numerous. He was elected a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1981), the Institution of Geologists (1985), and the Fellowship of Engineering (1991), and received the Whitaker medal of the Institution of Water and Environmental Management (1969), the Aberconway medal (from the Institution of Geologists, 1989), the William Smith medal (from the Geological Society of London, 1995), and the Hans Cloos medal (from the South African Institution of Engineering and Environmental Geology, 2002). He was a strong supporter of integrating amateur and professional geologists. He joined the Geologists' Association in 1951 and served as president from 1982 to 1984. He was president of section C of the British Association meeting (1988-9). He was knighted for his services to science in 1994. 
Latterly Knill and his wife lived in Shaw-cum-Donnington, near Newbury, where he established a vineyard that combined his interest in good wine and the effect of geology and slope aspect on viticulture. After a valiant fight against cancer, he died peacefully on 31 December 2002 at Newbury District Hospital. His funeral was held on 10 January 2003 at St Mary's, Shaw, Newbury, and he was cremated at Oxford crematorium. He was survived by his wife, Diane, and their two children. 
Knill was the leading engineering geologist of his generation. He was involved in the application of geology in the construction industry and in environmental issues throughout a career that spanned forty-five years. He utilized his expertise and experience as a consultant of international repute and imparted his knowledge and understanding to others throughout a distinguished academic career. Professionally, he was decisive, uncompromising, and forceful in presenting his views with a style that others could find intimidating. He was tireless in offering support and advice to the large number of his colleagues and former students, many of whom became his personal friends.

May, Alan Nunn (1911-2003), physicist and spy, was born on 2 May 1911 at Bedruthan, Park Hill, Moseley, Birmingham, the youngest of four children (one girl and three boys) of Walter Frederick Nunn May, brassfounder, and his wife, Mary Annie (Minnie), 'nee' Kendall. He was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to both of which he won scholarships, graduating from Cambridge in 1933 with a first in physics and going on to take a PhD under Charles Drummond Ellis. In 1936 he left Cambridge to take up a lecturing post at King's College, London, where Ellis had become professor. 
At King's, May pursued research into the development of electronic counters to measure sub-atomic activity and as the Second World War approached was drawn into secret work on radar. In October 1939, however, his department was evacuated to Bristol and the link with radar was broken. Instead he was soon recruited to help with early studies of the feasibility of an atomic bomb, and in early 1942 he was seconded back to Cambridge to work on nuclear reactor development as part of the Tube Alloys directorate. 
It was at this point, by his subsequent account, that May's opinion was sought on a classified American report suggesting that Germany might have the ability to explode a weapon that would spread radioactive material over a large area -- a 'dirty bomb'. May privately took the view that the country most threatened by this possibility was the Soviet Union, and decided to pass the information to a Soviet secret service contact. By 1942 he had been a communist for some years. His left-wing leanings may have stretched back to his youth, when his father's business collapsed during the depression, leaving the family struggling to get by. As a student in Cambridge he had been in close touch with left-wing people -- his tutor was Patrick Blackett, a socialist and pro-Soviet enthusiast, while Donald Maclean was a friend -- and he became a Communist Party member (though he had allowed this to lapse by 1940) and a prominent activist in the left-wing Association of Scientific Workers. 
In January 1943 the Cambridge reactor research team, May included, was transferred to Montreal and given the task of designing a heavy water reactor to be built at Chalk River, Ontario. The American Manhattan project was by then established, and it shared substantial amounts of information with the Canadian-based group. In a statement about his espionage dictated three weeks before his death May said that before he travelled to Canada his Soviet secret service contact had asked him to resume his spying once there. This he did not do. At the beginning of 1945, however, the Soviet Union was urgently seeking information about atomic research and a Lieutenant Angelov of the Soviet military intelligence agency, GRU, appeared at May's flat in Montreal demanding that he help. May later insisted that he was reluctant and there is evidence confirming this. He was persuaded none the less and within a fortnight gave Angelov two lengthy reports, one on the technical details of atomic weapons research as he knew them, and one on the structure of the Manhattan project. 
May was well informed, having paid several visits to the Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, the seat of American reactor research. Over the remainder of 1945 he saw Angelov several times and, as he wrote later, 'I provided all the information I could' (Alan Nunn May's last statement). This included microscopic samples of the uranium isotopes U233 and U235, and much more. 'Because I had access to the entire library of research documents on nuclear power (a great deal of which was provided by the USA), I was able to borrow these documents from the library and hand them over to the agent who would take them to Ottawa, photocopy them, transmit them to Russia and return them to me. (ibid.)' According to the Canadian royal commission that subsequently reported on these matters, he was paid at least $700 (Canadian) for his assistance, and two bottles of whisky. By his own account he accepted some money under protest but promptly burned it. 
In September 1945 May's job with the Canadian project came to an end and he returned to his lecturing post in London. Angelov gave him detailed instructions for a rendezvous with a London-based GRU agent at a location next to the British Museum. By now, however, the sequence of events leading to his arrest had begun. Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk who handled GRU material at the Soviet embassy in Ottawa, had defected, bringing with him copies of many GRU documents, including some incriminating May. MI5 were informed but they delayed May's arrest; they too now had the British Museum rendezvous details and hoped May would lead them to other spies. At a higher level, government ministers wanted to defer the inevitable souring of relations with Moscow that would result. In the event May did not attend the rendezvous, because, he said later, he had been tipped off. 
May was eventually arrested at King's College on the Strand in London on 4 March 1946. He made a partial confession, acknowledging the truth of the information already known to the British authorities and nothing more. He refused to name anyone else involved in espionage. His statement ended with the words: 'The whole affair was extremely painful to me and I only embarked on it because I felt this was a contribution I could make to the safety of mankind. I certainly did not do it for gain' (Moorehead, 39). At May's trial at the Old Bailey on 1 May 1946 Sir Hartley Shawcross, prosecuting, dwelt on the breach of trust and the exchange of money, and described the case as squalid. The defence responded that May had merely helped a wartime ally and had obeyed the dictates of conscience. He was found guilty and Mr Justice Oliver, after passing a sentence of ten years' gaol, denounced May for conceit, wickedness, and degradation. Though friends on the left and in the scientific community thought the sentence harsh, and Harold Laski led a fruitless delegation of protest to see the home secretary, Chuter Ede, May did not appeal and served six and a half years in prison. 
After his release from prison May returned to Cambridge and on 1 August 1953 married Hildegard Pauline Ruth (Hilde) Broda, an Austrian-born divorcee (daughter of Ludwig Girwing, army officer) who was deputy medical officer of health for the city. She already had a son, and they had a son together. Finding himself barred from university employment, May took a job at a scientific instruments company; his family said later that the post was covertly subsidized by the government, perhaps to counter any temptation he may have felt to emigrate to the Soviet Union. In 1961, on the recommendation of J. D. Bernal, a former Cambridge colleague, he was appointed to a research post in physics at the University of Ghana. He remained there for seventeen years, becoming in turn professor, dean, and finally a government adviser on science education. In 1978 he returned once again with his wife to Cambridge, to live out a quiet retirement. Until the statement he dictated to his stepgranddaughter Alice Evelegh on 23 December 2002 was made public immediately after his death he offered no public comment about his spying activities, and that statement made clear that he had no regrets. He died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 12 January 2003, of pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was survived by his wife, Hilde, his son, and his stepson. 
Measuring the importance of May's espionage is difficult, not least because the Soviet Union had many other spies -- perhaps dozens -- providing it with information about atomic developments in the USA and Britain in the 1940s. (At least one, the British-Italian Bruno Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, was a wartime colleague of May's in Canada, also working on the Deep River project.) Probably because the case was embarrassing to the government, the official British line at the time appears to have been to play down his importance. Certainly May was not at the heart of the Manhattan project, as were such other spies as Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Alvin Hall, so he could have told the GRU very little about weapon design. The reactor knowledge he was able to pass on, however, is likely to have been of considerable use to Soviet reactor scientists. 
Whatever the quality of his information, May played an important role in the origins of the cold war. His unmasking caused shock in official circles in London and Washington, and among the public, since this was the first overt proof that the Soviet Union had engaged in espionage against its wartime allies, and had gained access to atomic secrets by doing so. The case left little doubt that a nuclear arms race was underway and was one of the many factors in that period which helped establish the Soviet Union in the public mind as the new enemy of the West. In Washington, moreover, there was outrage that a man who had done little to conceal his communist activities before the war should have been cleared by MI5 to work at Montreal and to have access to a Manhattan project laboratory. This feeling helped create the climate for the American 'McMahon Act' of 1946, which had the effect of terminating the wartime British-American nuclear weapons partnership, and thus of forcing Britain to create its own independent deterrent.

Menuhin, Diana Rosamond Constance Grace Irene, Lady Menuhin (1912-2003), ballet dancer, was born on 12 November 1912 at 39 Lowndes Street, Belgravia, London, the elder daughter and second of three children of Gerard Louis Eugene Gould, a civil servant of Irish extraction, and his wife, (Daisy) Evelyn, 'nee' Suart, daughter of a cavalry officer, and a gifted amateur pianist in her own right. Her father died when she was three, leaving her unworldly mother to bring up her and her siblings, Gerard and Griselda. She showed an interest in and aptitude for dance, so was sent to train with Marie Rambert at Notting Hill Gate, one of a number of pupils who enrolled, as the times of Rambert's afternoon classes fitted in after school. Although she came to loathe Rambert -- she suffered from criticism of her appearance and talent from both her mother and her ballet teacher that left her hurt and insecure -- she later generously commented that it was by far the best ballet school in England at that time. In the 1930s she found greater satisfaction from the teaching in Paris of the former ballerinas of the Russian Imperial Ballet Lubov Egorova and Mathilde Kschessinskaya, who gave her considerably more confidence. 
Gould later called her memoir of her dance career 'A Glimpse of Olympus' (1996), as she considered that she was thwarted when chosen for stardom successively by Serge Diaghilev, Anna Pavlova, and Georges Balanchine. Before she could take up Diaghilev's invitation to join the Ballets Russes he died and the same disaster occurred when Anna Pavlova invited her to join her company as a soloist. She did dance as a soloist with Georges Balanchine for his short-lived experimental Les Ballets 1933, but when he invited her to accompany him to the United States of America to found a company her cowardice won. 'Longing to say yes, but young and frightened at such a great leap into what might be the dark, this idiotic English virgin again said no' ('Glimpse of Olympus', 85). Leonide Massine then asked her to join the Ballets Russes. She initially turned down the offer, but when she accepted the Russian dancers flatly refused to share allotted roles with her. Gould often said that she felt her career as a dancer had been cursed by the presence of a 'black fairy' at her christening. 
Gould was, nevertheless, the first home-grown ballerina of the Ballet Club and was quickly acclaimed by the ballet critic Arnold Haskell as 'the most musical dancer the English dance has produced' ('Glimpse of Olympus', 95). She was Rambert's first star pupil, presenting a full evening recital, supported by Harold Turner, at the Maddermarket Theatre, Norwich, in 1928. Frederick Ashton, with whom Gould loved to work -- 'his instinctively musical ear, his taste, his lyrical style exactly suited my belief that dancing was the representation of music in visible form' (ibid., 69) -- created a number of his early ballets for her, including 'Leda and the Swan' (1928) and 'Pavane pour une infante defunte' (1933). She was less in sympathy with Antony Tudor's choreography but created the title role in his 'Lysistrata' (1932), Thais in his 'Paramour', initially incorporated into the Oxford University Dramatic Society's 'The Tragical Historie of Doctor Faustus' (1934), and the Planet in his modernistic Mars scene of 'The Planets' (1934). She also performed in Max Reinhardt's 'The Miracle' (1932), understudying the two leading roles; with the Markova-Dolin Ballet, for which Bronislava Nijinska cast her as the Hostess in 'Les biches' (1937); and with the Arts Theatre Ballet, dancing and designing as well as serving as Harold Rubin's social secretary when he set up the Arts Theatre Club in the early years of the Second World War. 
At 5 ft 8 ins, Gould was a tall, beautiful woman who moved well. Although she was insecure about her appearance, she became one of the first dancers to model for Fortnum and Mason's and fashion magazines, including 'Vogue'. She performed as an actress both in experimental drama such as 'Genesis 2' (1934) and 'Squaring the Circle' (1935) and in mainstream commercial productions like 'What Every Woman Knows' (1943), 'Jacobowsky and the Colonel' (1945), and a lively production of 'The Merry Widow' for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). 
On 19 October 1947 Gould married, as his second wife, the violinist Yehudi Menuhin (1916-1999), who was knighted in 1965 and created Baron Menuhin in 1993. They had two sons, and she also became stepmother to the son and daughter of her husband's first marriage. She was devoted to and fiercely protective of her husband, accompanying him throughout the world and organizing his schedule. Constantly supporting humanitarian causes, the couple mixed in rich and influential society, with homes in Gstaad, Mykonos, and London. Although she could be unforgiving and had a sharp tongue and acerbic wit, Diana Menuhin also had a gift for friendship and she was influential in the creation of Live Music Now, a programme to send young professional musicians into the community. She was an entertaining writer and speaker. She wrote two lively volumes of autobiography, first 'Fiddler's Moll' (1984), describing her peripatetic partnership with Menuhin, and subsequently 'A Glimpse of Olympus' (1996), concerning her performing career. Her final years were blighted by dementia, and she died in a nursing home, Meadbank, 12 Parkgate Road, Battersea, London, on 25 January 2003, of bronchopneumonia. She was survived by her two sons and her two stepchildren.

Oppenheim, Sir Duncan Morris (1904-2003), industrialist, was born at Highfield, St Helens, Lancashire, on 6 August 1904, the second of three sons of Watkin Oppenheim, solicitor, and his wife, Helen, 'nee' McKechnie, a strict Presbyterian who passed on to him a spartan way of life. On his father's side his family were protestants from Budapest, who had come to England in 1740. His grandfather, Henry Samuel Oppenheim, was solicitor and executor to Thomas Beecham, founder of the pill firm in the town. Watkin Oppenheim had followed his father into the law, as did Duncan after education at Repton School. In 1929 he joined the commercial solicitors Linklaters and Paines in London. His marriage on 14 January 1932 to the 26-year-old Joyce Mary Mitcheson, daughter of Stanley Dodd Mitcheson, a club secretary, ended after a year when she died childless. 
In 1934 Oppenheim became a solicitor with British American Tobacco (BAT), briefly serving in China. On 3 October 1936, by then head of its legal department, he married Susan May Macnaghten (1908/9-1964), daughter of Brigadier-General Ernest Brander Macnaghten; they had a son and a daughter. As secretary of the chairman's committee, he found himself in the centre of BAT's affairs, and judiciously worked with his autocratic chairman, Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen, aware that the company was regarded as a 'ponderous, unwieldy, old-fashioned English accounting machine' ('DBB', 1.866). He became a director in 1943, deputy chairman in 1947, and vice-chairman in 1949. During the Second World War, though tobacco manufacturing was designated a reserved occupation for men over thirty, Oppenheim joined the Home Guard and combined his work for BAT with four nights a week as an air-raid warden. 
When appointed chairman in 1953 (attributing his rapid rise to the untimely demise of more favoured candidates) Oppenheim strove to overturn the company's unfavourable image. His solution was to introduce a more collegiate style. Hiding his keen legal intellect behind an unassuming manner, he delegated day-to-day business to trusted subordinates. The management training centre he set up at Chelwood, Sussex, helped to knit the company together as many senior executives were widely scattered overseas. He took over just when BAT's business in China, which contributed a third of its earnings, was being expropriated, followed by the loss of the Egyptian market in 1956, after the revolution there. Oppenheim combated those setbacks by building up trade in the United States and Latin America, and transferring production from Britain to units overseas, run by local managers. He made a point of interesting himself in the working and housing conditions of employees throughout the world. In 1956 he acquired the overseas business, and valuable brands, of BAT's rival Benson and Hedges. Himself an occasional smoker, he faced the growing medical evidence of links with cancer by stressing the need for further research, but meanwhile found discussion of the issue 'unconstructive' ('Daily Telegraph'). However, in 1961 he did begin a programme of diversification, successively purchasing Wiggins Teape, the paper manufacturer, Mardon Packaging International, Tonibell ice cream, and the Lentheric fragrance company. When he retired in 1966 the company's profits had risen from $42 million to nearly $102 million since 1953, while the level of dividends paid had more than trebled. 
Oppenheim was concerned to modify the insular view of markets taken by British business leaders and politicians. He therefore became chairman of the British National Committee of International Chambers of Commerce (1963-74) and of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1966-71). In 1964 the Labour government began to penalize through tax measures UK companies receiving overseas income not fully offset by earnings in Britain. As chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's investment committee, he sponsored a report by Cambridge economists entitled 'Effects of UK Direct Investment Overseas'. That report, acknowledging Oppenheim by name, found distinctive gains in exports from setting up plants abroad (contrary to the Labour government's claim that overseas investment destroyed British jobs). In 1960 he was knighted for services to industry. 
Throughout his long life Oppenheim had an abiding interest in art. Having taken up painting at the age of five, he developed into a highly regarded artist, who created naturalistic works in oils, watercolour, and acrylic which were regularly hung in the Royal Academy's summer exhibition. During the Second World War he painted a number of German bombing incidents, several examples of which were acquired by the Imperial War Museum. From 1956 to 1972 he chaired the council of the Royal College of Art, which gained its royal charter in 1967. Two years later he was awarded the bicentenary medal of the Royal Society of Arts. He held one-man exhibitions at the Upper Grosvenor Galleries in 1971, Spinks in 1980 and 1983, and the New Grafton Gallery in 1985, 1988, and 1992. 
After retiring from BAT Oppenheim became deputy chairman of the Commonwealth Development Finance Company, as well as being a director of Lloyds Bank and of the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society. As a keen sailor he was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. He served on the committee which transformed St John's Church, Smith Square, into a concert hall, and paid for the casing of the new organ installed there. A practical rather than an ideas man, he concerned himself with how things worked and could be improved. He agreeably summed up various facets of his character -- modesty, impatience with small talk on social occasions, and a subtle sense of humour -- in his reply to an importunate dinner partner who asked what his job had been: 'I was a tobacconist' ('Financial Times'). He died of pneumonia at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, on 5 January 2003, and was survived by the son and daughter of his second marriage.

Roper, Hugh Redwald Trevor-, Baron Dacre of Glanton (1914-2003), historian, was born on 15 January 1914, at Glanton, Northumberland, the elder son of Bertie William Edward Trevor-Roper (1885-1978), physician, and his wife, Kathleen Elizabeth, 'nee' Davison (1885-1964). His younger brother, Patrick Dacre Trevor-Roper (1916-2004), followed their father in pursuing a distinguished career in medicine. As a boy Hugh was solitary, self-reliant, and studious: boarding at Charterhouse (after Stancliffe Hall school, Derbyshire, and Belhaven Hill preparatory school, Dunbar) provided relief from a grim household where the children were often rebuffed, but never praised. He was awarded a classical scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1932, the Craven scholarship in 1933, and a first in classical moderations and the Hertford and Ireland scholarships in 1934; but he then transferred to modern history, in which subject he won first-class honours in 1936. As an undergraduate he moved in a set of hard-drinking hunting men, but read long, challenging works of scholarship with ferocious concentration: he taught himself German so as to study Wilamowitz, but then used his skill to read 'Mein Kampf'. 
Trevor-Roper became a research fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1937 and embarked on research which was published by Macmillan in 1940 as 'Archbishop Laud'. At this time he was a tory Marxist, committed to economic motives and causation, although his interests later focused on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century political and social structures, and in later middle age his work turned towards the history of ideas and the origins of the Enlightenment. 
Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Trevor-Roper was recruited to MI8, the Radio Security Service (RSS), a newly formed War Office department initially based at Wormwood Scrubs, which (after he and a colleague had deciphered a crucial code) became expert in monitoring the intercepted wireless traffic of the Abwehr, the German intelligence service. Trevor-Roper had an intelligence of rare clarity and incisive force that exceptionally fitted him for the task of analysing and interpreting this welter of material. In recognition of their successes he and the RSS were transferred in 1941 to MI6's counter-espionage section. Trevor-Roper was a resolute, independent-minded officer, who more than once was threatened with court martial: although never insubordinate, he was impatient and provocative of complacent mediocrity. In 1943 he became head of the radio intelligence section, a new branch of MI6, and developed a special interest in the workings of the German underground opposition. During 1944 he joined the War Room, a counter-intelligence group preparing for the occupation of Germany, headed by his friend Dick White. 
It was at White's instigation that in the autumn of 1945 Major Trevor-Roper began a systematic investigation into the circumstances of Hitler's death, including interrogation of eyewitnesses, and compiled an official report on the subject. After returning to Christ Church as a Student (tutor) in 1946, he expanded his report into a book, 'The Last Days of Hitler', which was published to high acclaim in 1947. It was never out of print in its author's lifetime. 
Trevor-Roper was a relentless scourge of zealots, cheats, and bores, and had exacting standards of historical evidence. But although he required the truth to be pure, he liked his mentors to be wicked gossips. In 1940 he was befriended by the selfish but winsome Chelsea man of letters Logan Pearsall Smith: Trevor-Roper's supple, exact, indelible prose, his elaborate elegance as a raconteur, and his malicious pleasures owed much to Smith. In 1947, while visiting Italy as a special correspondent of 'The Observer', he met Smith's brother-in-law Bernard Berenson, the tutelary genius of I Tatti, to whom he became gratefully devoted for training his pictorial imagination and for quickening his interest in the history of European ideas. Another enduring friendship, dating from 1951, was with Gerald Brenan. These contacts were proof of Trevor-Roper's interest in European, rather than merely national or regional, history. He had a reading knowledge of at least eight languages and was an inveterate traveller; and he thus acquired a breadth of experience and scholarship that English historians seldom attain -- there had been no one to rival the cosmopolitanism of his professional expertise since Lord Acton. He was the pioneering advocate in Britain of 'l'histoire totale'. He extolled the 'Annales' school in France, and particularly the early work of Fernand Braudel: during the 1950s he attended their seminars in Paris. 
In 1953 Trevor-Roper, whom Pearsall Smith had encouraged in a taste for the coroneted 'haute monde', began a passionate affair with Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Howard-Johnston (1907-1997), the wife of Rear-Admiral Clarence Dinsmore Howard-Johnston and eldest daughter of Field-Marshal Earl Haig. After an acrimonious divorce the lovers were married on 4 October 1954: Trevor-Roper thus acquired three stepchildren. 
The success of 'The Last Days of Hitler', and Trevor-Roper's beautifully limpid prose, made him a sought-after and well-paid reviewer, essayist, and travel writer in the 'Sunday Times', the 'New Statesman', the 'New York Times', and other periodicals. These worldly successes, and his sardonic humour, were resented by some contemporaries in Oxford, where his appointment to the chair of modern history was blocked in 1951. He was a dialectic historian, who investigated and tested the truths of other historians, sometimes with grave irony and on other occasions with destructive zest. By now he detested talk of ineluctable historical forces and all mechanistic theories of history: he cherished the free wills and moral choices of historical protagonists. His formidable powers as a controversialist were evident in his essay demolishing Lawrence Stone's views on the Elizabethan aristocracy (1951); in his annihilating 'opusculum' directed against R. H. Tawney's 'The gentry 1540-1640' (1953); and in his 'Encounter' polemics, 'Arnold Toynbee's millennium' (1957) and 'A. J. P. Taylor, Hitler and the war' (1961). 
These activities distracted him from writing the big book that his friends expected of him. After 1948 he started but discarded several monographs, produced an edition of Hitler's table talk in 1953, and collected his 'Historical Essays' in 1957; but his efforts after 1958 to produce a 'magnum opus' -- conceived as a three-volume study of the age of Cromwell and modified into a volume on the crisis in English government from 1600 to 1658 -- were abortive. He could not find a satisfactory form or ending for his manuscript, which was, he felt, overcrowded with argument. This failure caused him anguish, which was not relieved by the ambivalent critical reception of 'The Rise of Christian Europe' (1965). His default also gratified his proliferating enemies, for Trevor-Roper was a combative man whose razor-edged intelligence caused wounds that in some cases never healed. He was a sceptic who hated closed intellectual systems, despised metaphysics, and was revolted by the enforced submission of personal judgement to doctrinal authority. This led him into trenchant criticism of Catholicism, especially fashionable converts and their Jesuit confessors; of Stalinists; but also -- for in these matters he was even-handed -- of communist witch-hunts. His keen scrutiny after 1966 of the bogus traditions and theocratic Calvinism underlying some currents of Scottish nationalism was never forgiven in some quarters. 
Trevor-Roper was an astute if mischievous intriguer in university politics, and after careful manoeuvres he secured his appointment as regius professor of modern history in 1957. This required him to relinquish his studentship at Christ Church for a fellowship at a smaller, more staid college, Oriel, where his colleagues, rather than feeling refreshed by a healthy breeze after his arrival, initially shuddered at his chill Northumbrian blast. Of his predecessors in the regius chair he most admired York Powell, 'a universal man accidentally thrown up among our grim specialists' (Lloyd-Jones and others, 13), as he said in his inaugural lecture, which attacked obscurantism and timid pedantry among scholars, and urged that historical writing must be provocative, even playful, if history was not to seem a dead subject. Though Trevor-Roper disdained irresponsible frivolity, or any other form of cowardice in the face of life's difficulties, he cared even less for unrelenting seriousness, which seemed to him a form of fanaticism that stultified scholarship. He wanted Oxford University to be saved from 'solemn, pompous, dreary, respectable... experts' and to be instead 'gay, irreverent, genial, unpompous' (Trevor-Roper, 307). To this end he masterminded the campaign that resulted in the defeat of Oliver Franks and the election of Harold Macmillan as chancellor of the university in 1960. 
The range of Trevor-Roper's interests was exceptional: only he could have published, in the same year (1964), editions of Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' and of 'Hitler's War Directives'. His many time-consuming digressions included investigations in the 1950s into the Swedish humanitarian Count Bernadotte's murky dealings with Himmler's Estonian masseur Felix Kersten; his report on Adolf Eichmann's trial in Israel in 1961; and his scrutiny of the Warren commission's report, which convinced him that President Kennedy's assassination was a conspiracy. Trevor-Roper, who had known and liked Kim Philby, wrote of twentieth-century espionage with subtle authority in 'The Philby Affair' (1968). In that year, too, he began occasional contributions to 'The Spectator' of witty pastiches, purporting to be the letters of a seventeenth-century Oxford don, 'Mercurius Oxoniensis', commenting on the vagaries of academic life and the absurdity of contemporary manners: these were collectively published as 'The Letters of Mercurius' (1970). In 1973, at Basel airport, the manuscript memoirs of the Sinologue Sir Edmund Backhouse were confided to Trevor-Roper's keeping. He found them obscene, fantastic, and risible; but his testing of their claims resulted in 'A Hidden Life' (1976), which (with cool, unwavering irony) revealed Backhouse as a fantasist, forger, and swindler. It confirmed Trevor-Roper's place as the funniest historian since his hero, Gibbon. 
Trevor-Roper's forte, like Namier's, was the historical essay; but -- perhaps unlike Namier -- he valued historical evidence for its quality, not its massed quantity. It was a joy to watch him in a record office, as his eyes darted with hawk-like vigilance over the papers on his desk: he mistrusted those who delved interminably in muniment rooms, and liked to reach his conclusions not from dogged archival trawls but by swift, confident assessment of the sources followed by the play of his intelligence over his selection of evidence. The lack of evident intensity in his research suggests one reason why colleagues such as V. H. Galbraith felt reservations about him. 'Religion, the Reformation and Social Change' (1967) showed Trevor-Roper's powers as an essayist at their finest. His approach was always eclectic, not doctrinaire; he was a historian of moods and tempers, who used social structures and systems as explanations. He admired moderate social critics, like Erasmus and Bacon, but deprecated historians such as Christopher Hill who sentimentalized saboteurs, outsiders, and nihilists. His luminous, penetrative, discriminating mind was equally joyous in three further collections: 'Renaissance Essays' (1985); 'Catholics, Anglicans and Puritans' (1987); and 'From Counter-Reformation to Glorious Revolution' (1992). Original ideas, fertile speculations, and dazzling comparisons, which narrower historians might achieve only once or twice in their careers, sparkled through his pages. 
The Thatcher government recommended Trevor-Roper for a life peerage in 1979, and he took the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. As an impish anti-clerical he most enjoyed, among his other honours, his doctorate of divinity from the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee (1980). He had been elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1969. 
Dacre retired early from the regius chair to become master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1980. His appointment was instigated by a group of high tory bachelor dons, led by Maurice Cowling, who felt confident that his sallies would enhance the gaiety of the senior common room and that he would oppose moves to admit women to the college. They had misjudged their man, for Dacre was a reforming whig, who believed that a clerisy should be open, plural, civilized, and efficient. He wanted constitutional process, not die-hard custom, to govern college business. He resisted, and in some cases defeated, reactionary tendencies in the college, and vigorously promoted its 1984 appeal. The state of the college library in 1980 scandalized him, and he was especially proud of instigating the creation of a new library. The rancour at Peterhouse exasperated Dacre, and at times became too dominant an obsession, but never wholly soured him. The Dacres made the master's lodge a centre of hospitality and culture, and had grateful admirers, as well as detractors, among the fellowship. 
Gavin Astor, his wife's brother-in-law, had secured Trevor-Roper's appointment as an independent national director of Times Newspapers in 1974. Dacre opposed the selection of Harold Evans as editor of 'The Times' in 1981, and deplored the sales strategy of Rupert Murdoch who, he believed, wished to degrade British institutions, especially the monarchy, by a campaign of constant belittlement, trivialize British politics, vulgarize national culture, and reduce the population to a boorish, infantilized mass. Trevor-Roper, in the post-war period, had sacrificed some of his best energies to journalism; and the great calamity of his life, in 1983, arose from his involvement with the newspaper world. Sixty handwritten volumes purporting to be Hitler's diaries were concocted by a Stuttgart confidence trickster and sold for $3.5 million to 'Stern' magazine. After Murdoch decided that he wanted an immediate decision on serialization rights, Dacre rashly submitted to pressure from Charles Douglas-Home, editor of 'The Times', to inspect the diaries in a Zurich bank vault. Following a cursory examination, and misled by false assurances that were intended to further the criminal conspiracy, Dacre allowed the correct processes of historical verification to be sacrificed to the exigencies of a newspaper scoop. On the very day (23 April 1983) that Dacre's exuberant authentication of the diaries was trumpeted in 'The Times', he developed sharp misgivings, of which he warned Douglas-Home; but these doubts were not conveyed to the 'Sunday Times', which published a farrago of humiliating nonsense the next day. His reputation was permanently besmirched, although it was not until 1988 that Murdoch dislodged him from his directorship of Times Newspapers. 
The enmities that Dacre aroused could obscure the affection that he generated. At Christ Church and Oriel he was solicitous and stylish in his treatment of undergraduates: he preferred them to be high-spirited and sociable, and regaled them with indiscretions about wartime MI6. In the 1960s he baited student revolutionaries, and after those disturbances had subsided he continued to retaliate against undergraduate sloppiness and self-indulgence, whether in work, appearance, or emotions, for he always was reticent, fastidious, and self-controlled. He was not an academic empire-builder, but gave meticulous, witty, and subversive encouragement to young scholars. 
After he left Peterhouse in 1987 Dacre's personal tensions and intellectual assertiveness both relaxed. He nursed his wife through the distressing course of Alzheimer's disease. He developed Charles Bonnet's syndrome, which in 1998-2001 gave him such alarming hallucinations that, for a time, this most unswervingly rational of men feared that he was losing his sanity. Although nearly blind, he maintained a large international correspondence, and spent months painfully rereading voluminous notes for long-abandoned biographies to write the entries for this dictionary of, among others, Theodore Mayerne and Thomas Sutton. Finally, he was stricken by prostate cancer, which he faced with stoical fortitude, and of which he died, on 26 January 2003, at Sobell House hospice, Oxford. His ashes were scattered at Dryburgh Abbey, Berwickshire. He was survived by his three stepchildren.

Russell, (Irwin) Peter (1921-2003), poet and editor, was born on 16 September 1921 at 34 Henleaze Avenue, Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, the only child of Irwin George Russell, a commercial traveller for a scale maker, and his wife, Margery Maria, 'nee' Fortune, an invalid. When Russell was very young, his father died of tuberculosis contracted in the trenches in the First World War, and because of his mother's ill health he was brought up mainly in the care of a governess who instilled in him a lifelong love of literature, especially of Greek and Roman mythology. At the age of six he was sent to a preparatory school in Malvern, and from there to Malvern College, intent already on becoming a poet, and there he revelled in reading Homer, Plato, Virgil, and Horace in the original languages. He pursued his studies at home in the holidays, mainly in English, American, French, Italian, and Spanish literature. In his readings of Dante and Petrarch he first fell in love with the culture of Italy, an interest that shaped the course of his life. This passion was intensified as he read the works of Shelley, Keats, and Byron. On leaving Malvern College he spent the summer of 1939 in Heidelberg, supposedly studying volumes on organic chemistry for his entrance to Cambridge University, where he was to study natural sciences at King's College, but in fact spending his time reading German Romantic poetry: Goethe, Holderlin, Novalis, and Heine. This eclectic background determined the internationalist approach he always maintained in his poetry, criticism, and translations. It also fashioned his approach to submissions as a poetry editor. 
On returning to England at the outbreak of the Second World War, Russell joined the Royal Artillery, serving as an intelligence officer in India, Burma, and Malaya, and rising to the rank of major. While there he developed a passionate interest in oriental languages and cultures. Once, on crash-landing in the Bihar desert and then trekking for miles, he and his party came across a village of mud huts where there was a small bookshop run by a Hindu priest. All the books were Hindu scriptures in Sanskrit or the Bihari language, except one, 'A Selection of Poems of Ezra Pound', his favourite poet. He regarded this as a propitious sign, and was later to set up his own bookshops in Sussex, Kent, and London. 
After the war Russell studied English at Queen Mary College, London, but left without taking a degree, worried, he said, that he might become an academic. His first book of poems and sonnets, 'Picnic to the Moon', had already been published in 1944. From 1949 to 1956 he was editor of the poetry magazine 'Nine', in which he published new works by Ezra Pound (defending his work against those who regarded him only as a traitor and a fascist), T. S. Eliot, Borges, Boris Pasternak, and Tom Scott, and his own translations. At this time he also wrote a book on Pound's poetry, 'An Examination of Ezra Pound' (1950), and was prominent in the campaign for Pound's release (eventually secured in 1958) from the hospital in Washington, DC, where he had been held as insane after being charged as a traitor for his pro-Mussolini broadcasts from Italy. Russell had been corresponding with Pound since 1948. He was also reviewing regularly for the 'Times Literary Supplement' and for C. V. Wedgwood's 'Time and Tide' at this time. On 27 March 1951 he married Marjorie Alice Jewett, a widow, and daughter of Frederick Henry Keeling Bloxham, and thereby acquired a stepson. 
In 1954 Russell published 'Three Elegies of Quintilius', supposedly translations from a hedonistic but well-informed and opinionated fifth-century Latin poet. He particularly enjoyed one pompous review, which declared that the translations were not a patch on the originals. In 1956 'Nine' closed, and from 1959 to 1963 Russell lived in central London, spending most of his time studying Persian and Russian literature (he was the first to translate Osip Mandelstam's poetry into English) and reading widely on the latest developments in the sciences. In 1963 he and his wife, Marjorie, divorced, and he was also declared bankrupt, regarding this latter event as a godsend, since he could now give up his business life and turn to the writing of poetry again. He worked for the BBC for a while before leaving Britain for good, living in the United States, Berlin, Venice, Yugoslavia, Canada, and Iran, teaching mainly, finally settling about 1983 in La Turbina, a remote former watermill in the mountains between Florence and Arezzo, sustained only by his books, whisky, and cigarettes. He wrote some of his best poetry there, publishing the acclaimed 'All for the Wolves' in 1984, 'The Elegies of Quintilius' in 1996, and 'The Apocalypse of Quintilius' and 'Towards an Unknown Life' in 1997. A fire and a flood at La Turbina destroyed many of his books and letters, but he survived these disasters with his usual fortitude. Being fluent and prolific in Italian and English, he found himself towards the end of his life having as many Italian readers as English ones. He was particularly proud of having a number of his poems in the Venetian dialect published. He had married, as his second wife, Lana Long, with whom he had a son, Peter George, who acted as his secretary at the close of his life, and two daughters, Sara and Kate; his second marriage, however, also ended in divorce. He had a number of other relationships. 
Russell's knowledge of literature was both global and detailed, as was his experience of life. This breadth of vision was embodied in his poetry, especially in his musical lyrics, which celebrated life and art in an intensive unity that Russell believed was the permanent basis of a good life. Poetry should body forth goodness, love, truth, justice, and beauty, he thought, seeing all great art as a homecoming. Although he liked to wander into satire often, his main strength lay in gauging the primacy of the lyrical emotion, pitching it against lust, respecting intelligence and tradition, and conceiving of the poem as a perfect vision in an age given almost wholly over to empiricism, as he saw it. He believed in the possibility of coherence, completeness, total synthesis, and integration in a time of relativism and quantum uncertainty. He was never dogmatic, however, endorsing Pound's statement that 'belief is a cramp, a paralysis, an atrophy of the mind in certain positions' (quoted in 'Poetic Asides I', 63), and believing that, above all else, poetry is a celebration, the joy of discovery. He died in hospital at San Giovanni Valdarno, Italy, on 22 January 2003, and was survived by his three children.

Short, Irene (1916-2003), politician, was born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 26 April 1916. Her father, whose surname was Anderson, died shortly after her birth and her mother, Miriam Marks, married Percy Gill. The young Renee had little contact with her mother except for Friday night celebrations of their Russian-Jewish ancestry. Brought up in Nottingham by her paternal grandparents, she attended Nottingham county secondary school for girls and entered Manchester University to study modern languages. There is no record of her taking a degree. At university she met Endre Schwarz (1915-1999), a Hungarian-speaking Romanian national studying engineering. They married in 1940 and had two daughters, Ginette and Jennifer. As Andrew Short her husband became a structural engineer employed at the Building Research Centre. 
After her marriage Renee Short became a shorthand journalist and later a theatrical costumier. Backed strongly by her husband, she began to develop a career in Hertfordshire local politics. A Labour member of the county council from 1952, she fought unsuccessful parliamentary election campaigns at St Albans in 1955 and at marginal Watford in 1959. Her political career began in a period of intense Labour factionalism. She was a regular contributor at party conferences, where her red hair and criticisms of party policy allowed stereotyping of her as a suburban left-winger. 
In the October 1964 general election Short was successful in heavily working-class Wolverhampton North-East. She joined the left-wing Tribune group. Her eulogies on economic planning and public ownership typified its politics. Less common was her favourable attitude towards the Soviet Union, which she maintained even in the context of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968: 'I love and admire very much the Soviet Union... we find that the Soviet Union has done precisely that for which they attack the Americans in Vietnam... This is a very bitter thing for us' ('Hansard 5C', 769.1308-9). She remained positive about many features of Soviet and east European societies. 
Short's commitment to socialism was complemented by passionate and well-informed interventions on specific issues, often health and education, but most notably abortion law reform. She was one of the most dedicated advocates of abortion reform in the 1964 and 1966 parliaments. Subsequently she was a zealous opponent of any attempt to dilute the 1967 'Abortion Act'. Wolverhampton politics affected her position on immigration and race relations. Enoch Powell was her neighbouring member. His advocacy of further restriction and repatriation and his emotive language attracted support in Short's largely white constituency. She combined hostility to Powell with self-conscious 'realism'. In February 1968 she spoke in favour of controversial legislation that deprived Kenyan Asians of their British citizenship. She commended Labour policies as effectively restricting immigration. This pragmatism did not protect her at the 1970 general election. She was opposed by a self-proclaimed Powellite, and her majority fell from over 8000 in 1966 to under 2000. 
Short was a forceful and consistent opponent of British membership of the European Community, not least on the ground that membership would be an impediment to socialist advance in Britain. This emphasis on a British-based socialist strategy also illuminates her lack of sympathy for Scottish and Welsh devolution. In January 1978 she was among thirty-seven Labour MPs who supported the successful Cunningham amendment to the Scottish devolution bill, which required 40 per cent of the Scottish electorate (and not just a majority of those who voted) to back devolution in a referendum. This decisively blocked the achievement of a Scottish parliament the following year. 
Short's reputation as a left-wing critic was strengthened by her role on the Labour Party's national executive. During the 1960s she had stood regularly but unsuccessfully as a candidate for the women's section. Election to this section required the backing of male-dominated trade unions. In 1970, with some major unions shifting to the left, Short was elected and became a reliable member of the executive's increasingly influential left-wing faction. She participated in acrimonious debates about policy and constitutional reform, including the mandatory reselection of MPs. 
Short's knowledge of complex subjects was evident in the polarized politics of the 1980s. Her commitment to penal reform was expressed in a book published in 1979. For eight years she chaired the Commons select committee on social services effectively. These achievements were offset by difficulties within a factionalized Labour Party. Predictably she backed Tony Benn in the 1981 election for deputy leader, but his narrow defeat was accompanied by her own removal from the national executive. Sections of the trade union right had rallied and began to depose executive members with unacceptable views. She subsequently shifted towards Labour's political centre and supported Neil Kinnock in the 1983 leadership contest. Perhaps her very narrow victory in Wolverhampton in that year's general election had underlined the depth of Labour's crisis. Her political shift meant her re-election to the national executive at the 1983 conference. Her fortunes in executive elections owed more to the complexities of trade union politics than to her advocacy of Labour women's priorities. By the 1980s she was distant from many of the concerns of Labour feminists, not least their demand that women should elect the members of the women's section. She proved vulnerable to the reselection procedure that she had supported. Her backing within the Wolverhampton Labour Party declined in part because of factional rivalries. Her continuing residence in Hertfordshire might also have been a vulnerability. Having narrowly won a reselection contest in 1981 she anticipated a more formidable attempt to replace her in 1985. This time she decided to retire at the next election. She left the Commons in May 1987. At the subsequent general election her former seat was won by the Conservatives for the only time in the twentieth century. She died on 18 January 2003 at the Horton Hospital in Banbury, and was survived by her two daughters, her husband having predeceased her. 
Renee Short was very much a Labour left-winger of her generation. Enthusiasm for economic planning and advocacy of a better relationship with the Soviet bloc combined with campaigns on specific issues where her expertise could generate wider support. Her traditional left-wing politics could incorporate robust advocacy of abortion reform. She seemed less comfortable with later feminist campaigns. Her position within the party owed much to a left-wing trade union factionalism that complemented the strengths and limitations of her own politics.

Tinniswood, Peter (1936-2003), writer, was born on 21 December 1936 at 5 Granard Road, Wavertree, Liverpool, the son of Thomas Henry Bismarck Tinniswood (1892-1978), newspaper compositor, and his wife, May, 'nee' Broley (1910-1995). When Tinniswood senior was offered a job on the 'Manchester Guardian' they moved to Manchester, where his wife opened a small dry-cleaning business. Tinniswood was educated at Sale grammar school and Manchester University, though he liked to claim that listening to the customers in his mother's shop did more to arm him for a career as a humorist. Certainly it endowed him with an instinct for the lugubrious cadences of northern speech which would be such a feature of his work. Meanwhile, after a spell of teaching and a sojourn in Vienna as an insurance salesman, he made a start in journalism on the 'Sheffield Star' in 1958. A fellow reporter was David Nobbs. They became friends for life and occasional collaborators, beginning with jokes and sketches for comedians of the day. By 1963 they formed one of the script partnerships (others included Dennis Potter and David Nathan, and Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall) eager to shock the bourgeoisie glaring at BBC Television's satirical 'That Was The Week That Was'. They went on to write the radio comedy series, 'Hardluck Hall' (1964), and material for David Frost's 'The Frost Report', and for comedians including Dick Emery and Roy Hudd. 
It was not until 1967, when he was working on the 'Western Mail' in Cardiff, a long way from his roots, that Tinniswood applied himself seriously to his first novel and the fount of much of his later output. On 22 October the previous year he had married Patricia Mary Theresa Mallen, a 23-year-old draughtswoman, and daughter of Sean Mallen, customs officer. With their first child on the way and the rent of their flat to find, it was a bold decision to take six months off from the newspaper in order to concentrate on his book, but one that was eventually justified. First published in 1968, 'A Touch of Daniel' was selected by the Book Society and taken up by the Americans, while the Boulting brothers acquired the film rights. It featured the extended Brandon family, led by the gloomy Uncle Mort, dependent on the tireless errand-running of Carter Brandon, and collectively given to a northern idiom at once down-to-earth and aloft with fancy. As David Nobbs later remarked, no one else could have written such lines as 'It's a bit of a devil when your fiancee is the last one to hear about you having a baby owl', or 'I don't suppose wiping your nose was one of those things they taught them in the merchant navy' ('The Guardian'). Two further chronicles of the Brandon family followed, and although the Boultings' film option was never taken up the saga formed the basis of the long-running television comedy 'I Didn't Know You Cared' (BBC, 1975-9). Tinniswood's first solo television series had been 'Never Say Die' (1970), a hospital comedy set in Yorkshire. 
His other great creation was the cricket-loving brigadier first encountered in 'Tales from a Long Room' on BBC2 in 1980, and subsequently in full bloom in a thirteen-part series for Channel 4 in 1985. Owing much to the author's own passion for sport, these were in effect monologues delivered by Robin Bailey, who had memorably played Uncle Mort, and instead of northern pessimism was now dispensing languid reminiscence, with ever wilder flights of fancy. The brigadier was the central character in a series of half a dozen novels written by Tinniswood between 1981 and 1987, from 'Tales from a Long Room' (1981) to 'Tales from Witney Scrotum' (1987). 
Tinniswood went on to complete a total of seventeen novels, innumerable television scripts, and in his later years much work for radio, which he loved. In the theatre, he never quite overcame a dismissive review of his first play, 'The Investiture', in 1971, by the critic Harold Hobson. His rare excursions into 'serious' drama tended likewise to be undervalued, notably 'Stoker Leishman's Diaries' (1981), derived from the journal of one of the lower-deck members of Scott's ill-fated south pole expedition of 1912. But his radio play 'Anton in Eastbourne', imagining an encounter between Anton Chekhov and Katherine Mansfield, was chosen by Paul Scofield (playing Anton) to mark his eightieth birthday in 2002. 
Tinniswood's first marriage, which produced four children, ended in divorce after twelve years. On 20 September 1980 he married Elizabeth Kathleen (Liz) Goulding, the actress who had played Carter Brandon's wife Pat in 'I Didn't Know You Cared'. She was the daughter of James Callaghan, company director, and had also been married before. Goulding and Tinniswood separated in 1997. When his health deteriorated, however, she invited him to rejoin her, in Surrey, so that she could care for him. Cancer of the larynx had been diagnosed in 1995, and despite an initially successful operation returned in 1998. He had an operation which left him dependent on an artificial voice-box but which also seemed to give him a last burst of creativity, helped by BBC radio producers who sensed that he was happiest when working and continued to commission him. His final play, 'The Last Obit', also staged at the New End Theatre, Hampstead (2002), was the meditation of an elderly obituaries editor as, on her last day at the newspaper, she toils to sum up the life of a dying dame of the Order of the British Empire. She ends with the note that this subject 'is not survived by her obituarist'. He died on 9 January 2003 in the Princess Alice Hospice, Esher, Surrey. He was cremated at Randalls Park, Leatherhead, and his ashes were scattered on common land in a place dear to both him and Liz. He was survived by her and the four children of his first marriage.

Younger, George Kenneth Hotson, Baron Younger of Prestwick and fourth Viscount Younger of Leckie (1931-2003), brewer, politician, and banker, was born on 22 September 1931 at Garfield House, Victoria Square, Stirling, the eldest child in the family of three sons and one daughter of Edward George (Teddy) Younger, third Viscount Younger of Leckie (1906-1997), brewer and public servant, and his wife, Evelyn Margaret (died 1983), daughter of Alexander Logan McClure, advocate, of Edinburgh. He was the great-grandson of George Younger, first Viscount Younger of Leckie, brewer and politician, and nephew of Sir Kenneth Gilmour Younger, politician and reformer. His early life was spent in Stirling, but with frequent visits to the nearby family estate at Leckie, Gargunnock. He was educated at Cargilfield School, Edinburgh, and then at Winchester College. In later life he was made warden of the college, an honour of which he was immensely proud. Aged fourteen he lost an index finger in a shooting accident: as he was climbing over a wall, the gun fell to the ground and went off. 
Before entering university Younger was commissioned as a national service officer into the Argyll and Sutherland highlanders (in which his father had served during the Second World War), but because he was only eighteen he was initially too young to assume active service in Korea (the 1st Argylls having been sent there). Instead he was first posted to the 1st Black Watch in Berlin, where he met Diana Rhona Tuck, whose father, Captain Gerald Seymour Tuck (then a commodore in the Royal Navy), was deputy commissioner of the military security board in Berlin. They married on 7 August 1954, and had three sons and one daughter. 
During the bitter winter of 1950-51 Younger saw active service in Korea as a platoon commander. After completing his national service he continued as a territorial for fifteen years, and had a lifelong association with the military. In 1968 he spearheaded the successful Save the Argylls campaign, culminating in a one-million-signatory petition to the House of Commons, delivered in whisky boxes. In later life he took up several honorary military posts, most notably as lieutenant in the queen's bodyguard for Scotland, the Royal Company of Archers. Once, while defence secretary, he described the ceremonial bows and arrows he sported as 'the ultimate deterrent' ('The Scotsman'). 
After national service Younger read modern history at New College, Oxford. The college authorities thought it would be amusing if he shared a room with Charles Guinness, the son of another famous brewing family. At Oxford he became proficient in the French horn, founding the Oxford University Confederation of Horns. He was later made an honorary fellow of New College. On leaving Oxford in 1954 with a third-class degree he made his family home in Alva, Clackmannanshire, entering the family firm, George Younger & Son, in Alloa. He later joined the wines and spirits division in Edinburgh as sales director, where he remained until he entered parliament. 
Younger's political career seemed to be assured for life when (having lost out to Peggy Herbison in North Lanarkshire in 1959) he was adopted as the Conservative and Unionist candidate for the safe seat of Kinross and West Perthshire in 1963, but fate took a hand: Sir Alec Douglas-Home needed a seat on renouncing his peerage to become prime minister. Younger did the decent thing and stood aside. His sacrificial act was soon rewarded with the marginal seat of Ayr in time for the 1964 election, a constituency his great-grandfather, the first viscount, had held from 1906 to 1922. Defending a marginal seat became quite a challenge, leading to two very narrow scrapes, in 1966 (majority 484) and again in 1987 (majority 182). That Ayr remained in Conservative hands for so long was largely due to Younger's vigorous defence of its interests, particularly in ensuring that Prestwick airport retained its status as an international transatlantic terminal. 
Only a year after entering parliament Younger was made a Scottish Conservative whip, and then deputy chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland, in 1967. On Edward Heath's general election victory in 1970 Younger became parliamentary under-secretary of state in charge of economic development under Gordon Campbell, in which post he helped to introduce Japanese industrialists to Scotland's new 'Silicon Glen'. Younger held the post until just before the 1974 election, when he served for a very brief stint as minister of state for defence, just before the Conservatives were cast into opposition. In 1975 the new leader of the party, Margaret Thatcher, promoted Younger to front-bench shadow defence spokesman, but dropped him only eight months later to make room for Ian Gilmour. A year later he agreed to serve as deputy to Teddy Taylor, named shadow secretary of state for Scotland on the resignation of Alick Buchanan-Smith following Thatcher's U-turn on Scottish devolution. 
With the Conservatives back in power in 1979 the fate that had counted against Younger in the past turned in his favour. Had Teddy Taylor not lost his Glasgow Cathcart seat at the general election, Younger might not have become Margaret Thatcher's first secretary of state for Scotland, holding the post for six and a half years, longer than any other incumbent. He rapidly formed what amounted to a semi-autonomous mini-government north of the border, issuing ministers with public portfolios for the first time, and giving them more responsibility than had been seen previously. But as Thatcher remarked in her memoirs, 'There was no Tartan Thatcherite revolution' (Thatcher, 618). Younger was very much in the 'one-nation' mould of Tory politicians, pursuing pragmatic interventionist policies in Scotland. This policy was most obviously seen in his defence of traditional industries: in 1982 his threat of resignation gave the strategically important Ravenscraig steelworks near Motherwell a stay of execution until its eventual closure six years later. Throughout his long stint as secretary of state for Scotland Younger enjoyed a successful tenure, always conducting himself with self-deprecating charm, good humour, and an innate courtesy, traits that earned him the nickname Gentleman George; when he left the post his under-secretaries presented him with a silver miniature replica of a bed of nails ('The Guardian'). Younger's one major failure, however, was to underestimate the furious backlash against the revaluation of the Scottish rating system in 1985, and his subsequent attraction to a new system of local government finance, the community charge or 'poll tax'. 
In January 1986 luck again turned in Younger's favour. After Michael Heseltine walked out of cabinet in protest at Thatcher's handling of the Westland affair, concerning a defence contract for the purchase of helicopters, Younger was promoted to secretary of state for defence. He became very popular with the armed forces, partly because of his prior military service, but also because of his successful defence of the ministry's budget in the annual spending reviews. And just as he had done in Scotland, Younger spread the work of defence procurement to ensure the survival of as many factories and shipyards as possible. In 1988 he signed a protocol on defence sales with the Malaysian government under which $1 billion of arms sales were linked to $200 million of British aid, mainly to finance the Pergau Dam hydro-electric project. The foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe, had not been consulted before Younger signed the agreement. In 1994 a foreign affairs select committee report described Younger's failure to inform the Foreign Office as 'reprehensible'. In mitigation Younger felt he was sufficiently senior to negotiate the deal without consulting colleagues at home, and that such a move might have looked weak in the eyes of the Malaysians. In any event Younger took full responsibility for his actions. 
In 1989 Younger helped to run Margaret Thatcher's successful campaign against Sir Anthony Meyer, the so-called 'stalking horse' candidate who was challenging her for the party's leadership. Shortly afterwards the prime minister hinted at the possibility of the Foreign Office in a vain attempt to stop Younger leaving the government to become director and then chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland group. (The post of chairman had been kept open for him for some five years.) In November 1990, when she was challenged by Michael Heseltine, he was again asked to act as Thatcher's campaign manager, and later attracted, rather unfairly, some of the blame for the failure of her campaign. The prime minister's offer placed Younger in a quandary. Honour-bound to accept or risk being perceived as disloyal, he did so only on condition that others did the work, because by this stage he was too busy with his work at the Royal Bank, where his mission was to establish a Scottish-based bank as an international force. In that he succeeded, presiding over the most successful period in the bank's history, culminating in the takeover of the much larger NatWest group in March 2001. Younger's natural charm had helped to convince the City of London and the relevant shareholders of the takeover's merits. 
Younger retired as a Conservative MP in 1992, being raised to the peerage as Baron Younger of Prestwick. As well as taking on many company directorships, he accepted dozens of voluntary posts, British as well as Scottish, moving Sir Malcolm Rifkind to comment on his death: 'There has hardly been a major Scottish institution that has not benefited from his voluntary service in recent times' ('The Scotsman'). Most notably he was chairman of the celebrations of the fortieth anniversary of the queen's coronation, for which he was appointed KCVO. In 1995 he became one of the sixteen knights of the Order of the Thistle. Two years later he inherited the viscountcy on the death of his father. He died of cancer at his home, Leckie House, Gargunnock, near Stirling, on 26 January 2003, and was survived by his wife, Diana, and their four children. He was succeeded as Viscount Younger by his eldest son, James ('b'. 1955). As Baroness Thatcher rightly said of Younger in her memoirs, 'His career is proof of the fact that, contrary to myth, gentlemen still have a place in politics' (Thatcher, 756).

Deniz, Francisco Antonio (1912-2005), guitarist and bandleader, was born at 9 Christina Street, Cardiff, on 31 July 1912, the eldest of three sons of Antoni (or Antonio) Francisco Deniz, formerly Diniz (1878- 'c'.1931), a donkeyman (engine-room sailor), and his wife, Gertrude Blanch (or Blanche), 'nee' Boston (1886-1974). His younger brothers were Jose William (Joe) Deniz (1913-1994) and Laurence Richard (Laurie) Deniz (1924-1996); a sister died in infancy. Their father was an African from Cape Antonio in the Cape Verde Islands, and their mother, born in Cardiff, was of English and African American descent. 
Deniz was born while his father was away at sea and baptized twice as a result. As Frank he was christened at St Mary's Church, Cardiff, under the rites of the Church of England, but when his father came home, he was baptized again as a Roman Catholic with the name Francisco Antonio. He grew up in Cardiff with his half-siblings, Maria Margaret Correa (1907-1978) and Manoel Edward Correa ('b'. 1909), the children of their mother's first marriage, to Manoel or Manuel Correa, a ship's cook. Correa was a Cape Verdean, too, and thus, like Antoni Deniz, a member of what is believed to have been the first and oldest immigrant community in Cardiff's docks. As a boy Deniz heard African and Caribbean airs, sea shanties, and popular songs. He knew traditional Portuguese music through his father, who played violin, mandolin, and guitar, and learned to play by listening to Portuguese-speaking Cape Verdean Africans at Sunday sessions where his mother played piano. 
Deniz attended South Church Street school and on leaving, aged fourteen, sold newspapers in the streets. When the newspaper's photographer hired Deniz to carry his equipment, he experienced a new life, attending race meetings where he observed Cardiff 'society'. But his father disapproved and with an eye to the future took his eldest son to sea at fifteen, against his mother's wishes. For three years he worked on tramp ships, sometimes with his father, travelling to India, Malaya, Australia, China, and as far as Vladivostok. When his father was taken ill in Odessa, he was forced to leave him in hospital, where he died. He continued going to sea for nearly ten years, eventually qualifying as a donkeyman, while playing guitar and taking the opportunity to hear music wherever he travelled. In Jacksonville, Florida, he heard African American longshoremen singing work songs and blues, and encountered segregation. In Galveston and Charleston he came across 'holy-roller' preachers and in Boston joined a gospel congregation. 
Between voyages Deniz stayed in Cardiff. In 1934 he heard and met Louis Armstrong at the Empire Theatre, and the same year started playing music with his brother Joe, and with his future wife, Clara Wason ['see below']; their Blue Hawaiians included another guitarist, Victor Parker. He played also with the dance band of the saxophonist Syd Clements and for a while he, too, played saxophone, mainly because of the limited role then available for stringed rhythm instruments in a band. His experiences in the Americas had shown him that he did not want to strum a banjo or play Hawaiian-style guitar; what inspired him was the single-string work of Teddy Bunn and Eddie Lang, pioneering American jazz guitarists who played clear melodic lines on the instrument. 
On 8 August 1936 Deniz married Clara Wason at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Cardiff. Born in Cardiff on 30 September 1911, Clara Ethel (Clare) Deniz (1911-2002), pianist, was the daughter of Frederick Wason ('c'.1883-1913), a merchant seaman from Barbados, and Bessie Louise Bryant from Somerset, who had some French ancestry. She grew up with her mother in Grangetown, Cardiff, in the home of a Mrs Knight, who came from a mixed-race theatrical family in Bristol, and who was married to a ship's steward from the Caribbean; there Clara learned to play the piano, inspired by Louisa (Louie) Erskine, aunt of the heavyweight boxer Joe Erskine. 
After their marriage Frank and Clara Deniz moved to London and immediately found their way into the raffish world of bottle-parties that dominated the capital's nightlife. They joined forces with other British-born musicians of colour, and moved around Soho, taking whatever work they could find. With the guitar yet to come into its own as a dance-band instrument, they often relied on Clara's income, and eventually it was she rather than Frank who (as Clare Deniz) joined an up and coming band when she replaced Yorke de Souza in the 'all-black' orchestra of the Guyanese dancer Ken 'Snake Hips' Johnson. In 1937 Frank Deniz spent a brief period as Johnson's second guitarist, playing alongside his brother Joe. The intention was to feature Joe on the amplified Hawaiian guitar, then a popular instrument, and another guitarist was needed to carry the rhythm. The birth of the Denizes' first daughter, Lorraine, in 1937, brought about his departure from the band, although he did so with the blessing of its leader. He then returned to the bottle-parties and jam-sessions. He met prominent American musicians including Art Tatum and Fats Waller, but it was not until he joined the Nigerian pianist Fela Sowande at the Florida Club in 1938 and accompanied the American singer Adelaide Hall that he received the exposure warranted by his developing abilities. 
In May 1940 Deniz joined the merchant navy, and survived the dive-bombing of his ship. In San Francisco he heard Louis Armstrong again and met his hero, Teddy Bunn, then in Brazil encountered the Afro-Portuguese rhythmic music that would determine his artistic direction. The chance to practise came by playing 'Latin' music with Edmundo Ros between voyages. In November 1941 he was among the leading musicians participating in the first recorded public jam session, organized by 'Melody Maker', the music trade's weekly newspaper. He played jazz and Latin American music with other bands, but because of his earlier seagoing career, was unable to escape his maritime commitments, despite being torpedoed twice. He continued to broadcast between voyages and joined ENSA to entertain troops with the accordionist Eric Winstone. Leading his own Spirits of Rhythm, named in homage to Teddy Bunn's group of the same name, his guitar playing drew accolades, while Clare also played with the band. Their second daughter, Claire Frances, was born in 1945. 
At Rudy Evans's Caribbean Club, where he preceded Lauderic Caton in the house trio, Deniz drew the attention of the music profession's burgeoning modernists. He continued as a featured artist with Winstone, with whose band Clare also played, but although he worked with many jazz notables including the violinist Stephane Grappelli and at the Caribbean Club, where he returned in 1946, his goal lay elsewhere. To shake off the negative image that was attached -- unjustly -- to local black artists, he dropped the Americanisms he had adopted as a 'jazzman', and changed his presentation, demeanour, and dress. His fellow guitarist Ivor Mairants helped him initially but his breakthrough came about through the pianist Stanley Black, an admirer of the Deniz brothers who loved Latin American music. When Black became leader of the BBC Dance Orchestra in 1944 he gave Deniz his entree to radio by employing him regularly and introducing him to other leaders and arrangers -- and, importantly, contractors and producers, thereby helping to establish him as a session musician. 
In 1953, Frank and Clare Deniz were reunited with Fela Sowande when they appeared in the BBC radio series 'Club Ebony', where Clare sang in Sowande's choir. The same year, inspired by an encounter with Carmen Miranda's musicians, Frank formed a Latin American band, Hermanos Deniz, which included his brother Joe, and later also their younger brother Laurence. For several years the band held prestigious residencies in London's West End. As the guitar grew in popularity, Deniz began writing and playing with his group for films. He created music for Orson Welles's 'Three Cases of Murder' (1953) and, with Laurence, co-wrote thirty original pieces for Carol Reed's 'Our Man in Havana' (1959). 
Regarded as one of the leading guitarists of his generation, Deniz was a thoughtful and serious individual for whom respectability was crucial. The example of Ken 'Snake Hips' Johnson's success with an 'all-black' orchestra inspired him and determined him to organize an equally businesslike band. He did this through excellent musicianship and a capacity to adapt. His uncredited session work ranged from light music to rock 'n' roll but his favourite job came accompanying the American songwriter Hoagy Carmichael. His forte was reproducing the warmth, interplay, and percussive colour of African-Portuguese and African-Spanish rhythms. He continued to organize bands for private functions until 1980 when he and Clare moved to Spain. They worked occasionally in local bars and Frank studied Spanish guitar, but when Clare contracted Parkinson's disease in the 1990s they returned to England where he became her full-time carer. She died in Whitford, Hertfordshire, on 7 December 2002. Frank Deniz died at home, at 12 Amwell Lane, Stanstead Abbots, Hertfordshire, on 17 July 2005; like Clare he was cremated at Harlow crematorium. He was survived by his two daughters, Lorraine and Claire, the latter a successful cellist, known as Clare Deniz.

Wynn, Sir Watkin Williams, fourth baronet (1749-1789), patron of the arts and politician, was born on 8 April 1749, the elder son of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, third baronet (1693?-1749), of Wynnstay, Denbighshire, and his second wife, Frances (1717/18-1803), daughter of a Cheshire squire, George Shakerly of Holme. His father had married his much younger god-daughter at the express request of his first wife, with the evident motive of securing an heir. The younger Watkin was five months old when his father died in a hunting accident on 26 September 1749. He inherited a complex of estates in north Wales and the border counties, notably Wynnstay, Llanforda in Shropshire, Rhiwgoch in Merioneth, and Llwydiarth in Montgomeryshire. 
Wynn was educated at Westminster School from about 1760 until 1766. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 9 May 1766, but left the university without a degree in 1768. He was created a DCL in 1771, presumably to honour his father's name. Wynn had already shown interest in music, drama, and painting. He joined the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club, which met weekly for singing, in 1768, and also that year commissioned the first of several portraits of himself or other members of his family from Joshua Reynolds. He indulged and developed his cultural interests on his grand tour, which lasted from May 1768 to February 1769, and cost him $8643. With his companions Captain Edward Hamilton and Thomas Apperley (the latter perhaps acting as a tutor), and steward Samuel Sidebotham, he travelled via Paris and Switzerland to Florence, where in October he gave a lavish dinner for sixty in honour of the investiture of Sir Horace Mann as a knight of the Bath. The party proceeded to Rome, where Wynn commissioned two paintings, one a group portrait of his party, from Pompeo Batoni, and patronized other painters including Gavin Hamilton, Anton Raphael Mengs, and Thomas Jenkins. He joined William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire, in employing the antiquary James Byres of Tonley to show them the Roman remains at Tivoli, and commissioned an unexecuted design from Byres for the reconstruction of Wynnstay as 'a vast Italian palazzo that would dominate the Dee valley' (Ford, 436). The party moved on to Naples and then Venice. Throughout Wynn attended plays, operas, and concerts, and acquired pictures, sculptures, and music scores. This cultural experience set the tone for the rest of his life. 
On 11 April 1769, two months after his return, he married Lady Henrietta Somerset (1748-1769), daughter of Charles Noel Somerset, the deceased fourth duke of Beaufort (1709-1756) ['see under 'Somerset, Henry second duke of Beaufort]. Wynn had anticipated the wedding with the purchase of several expensive presents for his wife and family in Paris, and the commissioning of a rococo silver gilt toilet set in London from the royal goldsmith, Thomas Heming (eventually acquired by the National Museum of Wales in 1964). The promise these presents represented was broken by the death of his wife on 24 July 1769, after just over two months of marriage. 
Wynn's coming-of-age party in April 1770 became the stuff of legend: 8700 tickets were issued, reportedly allowing over 15,000 people into the park at Wynnstay, and the celebration cost $1621. The next year Wynn married again. His bride on 21 December 1771 was Charlotte Grenville (1754-1832), daughter of the recently deceased former prime minister George Grenville: but, although his wife was also a niece of William Pitt, earl of Chatham, these connections would prove to have little influence on Wynn's political conduct. They had three sons, including Charles Watkin Williams Wynn and Sir Henry Watkin Williams Wynn, and three daughters. 
Wynn now adopted an annual lifestyle that would accommodate his multifarious interests, staying in London for the social season and parliamentary session for the first half of the year (he became an MP in 1772), and withdrawing to Wynnstay for the late summer and autumn, often until Christmas. In 1771 he bought 20 St James's Square as his London home for $18,500, and then spent $30,000 in the next three years on constructing what was virtually a new building, the architects being Robert and James Adam. Throughout the 1770s and 1780s Wynn, with his love of drama, music, and the visual arts, was very much a part of the lively London cultural scene. All his life he was an ardent theatre-goer, as well as an actor in amateur theatricals. His London house had a music room, where he held musical breakfasts, and doubtless often played himself, for in 1773 alone he had 158 violoncello lessons. He also appeared as a steward at the annual music festival at St Paul's to benefit the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy during the 1770s. A Welsh dimension was another characteristic of Sir Watkin's London life, for although unable to speak Welsh he was proud of his heritage. He gave $100 per year to the Welsh charity school in London, and in 1772 he became vice-president of the Society of Antient Britons, the first London Welsh society. He was an active member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, the principal social, philanthropic, and intellectual Welsh society in London, and was chosen to be its second chief president in 1775. Wynn's social position as a London virtuoso was recognized when he was elected to the Society of Dilettanti, with whom he was painted by Reynolds in 1777. From the late 1770s Wynn's musical activities assumed a larger share of his public life. He was second only to John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, on the committee for 'Antient Concerts' for music more than twenty years old, and his devotion to Handel -- he collected prints and manuscripts of the composer's music, as well as giving his music prominence in the concerts he programmed -- anticipated that of George III in helping Handel to a predominant place in the musical canon. 
Wynn's cultural activities were partly replicated during his summer sojourns at Wynnstay. In August and September 1771 he travelled with the painter Paul Sandby, Apperley, and other friends around north Wales, an expedition that suggests Wynn was one of the pioneers of the fashion for the appreciation of the picturesque in landscape. The journey resulted in Sandby's 'Views in North Wales' (1776). Among the other painters Wynn patronized were his remote kinsman, the Denbighshire-born Richard Wilson, and the portraitist William Parry. Robert Adam built a theatre at Wynnstay, a venue for concerts and plays, which usually included an annual week of amateur dramatics in which Wynn took part. In 1777 it was graced by David Garrick. Wynn also engaged in customary country-house life. The Cycle of the White Rose, formerly a Jacobite organization headed by his father, now became a social club for the local gentry, and he also established a Freemasons' Lodge at Wynnstay. A member of the Jockey Club, Wynn supported race meetings in his home area of the Welsh borders. The Wynnstay hunt was founded in 1768, but Wynn's lack of enthusiasm for that traditional country sport was shown by his first economy, the sale of his hunting horses and hounds in 1781. 
This sale indicated that the background to Wynn's extravagant lifestyle was one of growing financial stringency. He was never quite as wealthy as contemporaries thought. His income in 1749 has been variously estimated at between $12,000 and $20,000, and though it was $27,000 by 1778 his debts were rising. Between 1773 and 1781 alone he borrowed $65,000, and the Wynnstay debt at his death was $160,000, with an annual interest burden of $6000. Wynn was not entirely to blame. His mother's annual $2000 jointure had by his death cost the estate $80,000, and his father had left a large debt. However, Wynn's lavish subsidy of so much London culture and his famous Wynnstay hospitality were the constant despair of his agents. Additionally, there were the costly obligations of politics. 
Wynn had inherited with Wynnstay implicit political commitments: to retain the Denbighshire seat in the Commons for his family, and to maintain the powerful electoral interest his father had built up in north Wales. According to a radical newspaper, the 'London Evening Post', Wynn developed an early interest in politics, so much so that in 1770 he was reputedly invited to stand as the radical candidate in a Westminster borough by-election ('London Evening Post', 27 Feb, 24 and 26 April 1770). Wynn would seem an improbable radical, but he was keen to enter parliament, and did so at a Shropshire by-election in 1772. At the general election of 1774 he transferred to Denbighshire, retaining that seat for life; there is no record of any speech by him during his seventeen years as an MP. In 1774 Wynn spent $4600 in a vain attempt to defend the Montgomeryshire seat of his cousin Watkin Williams against a candidate sponsored by the rival Herbert family interest of Powis Castle. The quarrel spilled over into Merioneth, where Wynn helped his ally Evan Vaughan to retain his seat against another Powis Castle candidate. Wynn's further active part in a Caernarvonshire contest made the 1774 election an expensive experience for him and one he did not intend to repeat. He had, in fact, successfully defended his family's influence; Powis Castle's fears of another costly contest enabled him to recover control of Montgomeryshire at the next election, and he helped Watkin Williams to take the Flint Boroughs seat in 1777. 
In parliament Wynn had sided with the opposition to Lord North's ministry, but he nevertheless applied, through North, for the lord lieutenancy of Merioneth when it fell vacant in 1775. George III gave grudging consent: 'if he means to be grateful, otherwise favours granted to persons in opposition is not very political' ('Correspondence of George III', 3.74, 205-7). For the next few years Wynn was a government back-bencher, but at the end of 1778 he was second only to Thomas, seventh Viscount Bulkeley, in organizing protests of the Welsh gentry against a Treasury warrant to investigate the diminution of crown revenues in Wales. The real motive behind this storm of protest at an alleged attack on liberty and property was the fear that an investigation would reveal illicit encroachments on crown lands by Welsh squires. The inquiry was blocked, but the episode coincided with growing unease about royal influence, and Wynn moved back to opposition. He took a special interest in the campaign to curb government patronage, and Edmund Burke consulted him in 1780 about Welsh aspects of his proposed legislation. Wynn voted against North until his fall in 1782. He missed the critical session of 1783-4 when the Pitt ministry was formed, and the anticipation on both sides was that he would support Pitt rather than Charles James Fox: for Earl Temple, so instrumental in Pitt's elevation, was his brother-in-law, and Pitt his wife's cousin. Wynn confounded expectations, and voted steadily against Pitt until his death. His political affiliation did not preclude his collaboration with George III in the Handel commemoration of 1784, where political factionalism gave way to a shared cultural enthusiasm among the elite. From 1785 George III subscribed to the Antient Concerts, which became known as the King's Concerts, and although they were ended through the political estrangement of the directors from the king this did not occur until after Wynn's death. 
Although of robust appearance and a cheerful disposition, Wynn suffered poor health for much of his life, being often stricken with erysipelas, then known as St Anthony's Fire, a dangerous disease akin to scarlet fever. He died, after a recurrence, on 29 July 1789, at his home, 20 St James's Square, Westminster. He was buried at Ruabon, Denbighshire. The obituary in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' extolled his character rather than his achievements. 'He did not enter into the vices or the follies of his age... In his public and private capacity his disinterested integrity was unimpeachable... it belonged to Sir Watkin to be the more beloved the better he was known' ('GM', 59, 1789, 765).

Redfern, Percy (1875-1958), journalist and historian of the co-operative movement, was born in Leicester, the illegitimate son of a housekeeper. He was brought up by his father, Francis Redfern, who was an architect, and by his stepmother. The precise details of his background and early life are obscure but he was educated at various schools, including a dame-school, church school, and boarding-school in London, and Nottingham grammar school. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a Nottingham draper, an occupation that brought him into direct contact with the changing world of retailing and consumption. The harsh conditions of labour made a deep impression on him, as did the corrupt practices used by the trade to hoodwink gullible customers. He found the so-called 'religion of socialism' immediately appealing and recalled in his autobiography, 'My Journey to Understanding' (1946), how Robert Blatchford's weekly 'Clarion' came as 'a message of life and joy' (Redfern, 20). 
Redfern hated the living-in system common in the retail trade but continued with shop work, first in Coventry then London. He moved to the capital in 1895, joined the Social Democratic Federation and contributed to 'Justice'. In 1896 he took a job in Huddersfield and became an active member of the Independent Labour Party, electioneering for Tom Mann, Keir Hardie, and Victor Grayson among others. For Redfern, like many of his generation, socialism constituted a form of community life and provided a source of meaning and hope. The most vivid passages in his autobiography convey how he and his comrades trained themselves 'in the faith' (Redfern, 38). 
The most important turning point in Redfern's career came in 1899 when he obtained a clerical post with the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) in Manchester. Soon after he became sub-editor then editor of 'The Wheatsheaf', the co-operative movement's monthly magazine. This publication was distributed free to local retail societies and had a circulation of nearly 0.5 million before the First World War. On 12 July 1905, at the Durham Road Unitarian Chapel, Altrincham, Redfern married Edith ('b'. 1878/9), daughter of John Gill Bridges Barber, cashier. He apparently enjoyed a happy family life, though few details are known. 
Redfern immersed himself in co-operative history and theory and discovered the potential of the consumer through the life and speeches of the former chairman of the CWS, J. T. W. Mitchell, whose biography he later wrote. Reaching back to the Owenite roots of co-operation, Redfern soon came to regard the modern co-operative movement as a possible democratic utopia in embryonic form, built by organized consumers. Once converted, he communicated this view zealously throughout his subsequent writings. In an article for the 'Co-operative Society Annual' in 1910, for example, he concluded: 'a first step toward a new social order is the organisation of the people by and for themselves, specially and definitely as consumers' (Redfern, 218). 
The impact of total war, particularly profiteering on the home front, strengthened Redfern's belief that the consumer ought to be taken seriously. He rejected the majority socialist position that viewed consumers as a lost cause -- merely prey for cunning advertisers and retailers -- insisting instead that the potential of buyers to change the world was immense, if only they grasped the opportunity and organized themselves properly. He attempted to redefine the consumer for democratic economic and social change at greater length in his important manifesto 'The Consumers' Place in Society' (1920), in which he baldly asserted: 'It is the consumer who stands at the gates of a new social order' (Redfern, 17). By this time he had thoroughly modified his earlier socialism that had prioritized state action and he looked forward to the spread of what he termed 'voluntary collectivism' (Gurney, 191). 
The rest of Redfern's public life was devoted to co-operative propagandism. He had a real passion for the past and in 'The Wheatsheaf' in 1911 he welcomed the growing interest in the history of the common people because it enabled co-operators, 'to remember that the present co-operative system is only the means to an end, and that the emancipation of the proletariat is of more consequence than an extra penny in the pound at the present time' (Gurney, 139). He went on to publish two major studies, 'The Story of the C.W.S.' (1913) and 'The New History of the C.W.S.' (1938), both well researched, readable works. Redfern was insistent that the movement should not be so inward looking and often stressed the importance of educating the wider society about the meaning and achievements of co-operation, not only the way it was effecting economic reform but also how it was producing a new culture in the process. 'We need to live in the movement, but not to bury ourselves in it' was how he put it in his popular textbook published in 1914 on the eve of war, 'Co-operation for All' (p. 118). He retired from the CWS in 1938. 
Redfern was a freethinker in his early life but later enthusiastically embraced Tolstoy's Christian anarchism; his first book (1907) was a study of the novelist's philosophy of life. He also took up vegetarianism (he was storekeeper for the Manchester Vegetarian Society for a while) and was a convinced pacifist. Eventually he found his spiritual home among the Society of Friends in Manchester. His faith in a complete co-operative utopia also mellowed with age, and in his autobiography he argued instead for a mixed economy (Redfern, 161). He died from heart disease at The Retreat, York, on 11 February 1958 and was buried in the southern cemetery, Manchester. A memorial service was held at the Manchester Friends' meeting house.

Bucknell, Robert Barraby (1912-2003), television presenter, was born at 61 King Henry's Road, Hampstead, London, on 26 January 1912, the elder son and eldest of four children of Arthur Thomas Bucknell, surveyor and valuer, and his wife, Dora Isabel, 'nee' Bromby. He was educated at William Ellis School, Highgate, then served an apprenticeship with Daimler and qualified as a mechanical engineer before working in the garage owned by his father, who had added it to the family building and electrical business he had inherited at St Pancras. As a conscientious objector during the Second World War Bucknell worked for the London fire service and took over the running of the family building business after both his parents were badly injured when a bomb fell on their house. Bucknell was also a Labour borough councillor in St Pancras and served as chairman of the local housing committee, involved with projects to remodel the area, which was devasted during the war. 
In 1944 Bucknell married Betty Pearn, who in the post-war years presented cookery programmes on BBC radio. Through this connection, following the birth of the couple's first child (they eventually had two sons and one daughter), Bucknell was asked to talk about fatherhood on another show. His skill for designing gadgets such as a suitcase on wheels and a car for drivers with no legs, combined with the dawn of a consumer society and more people owning their own homes, led to his being hired to contribute practical tips for housewives to the afternoon television programme 'About the Home' (1956-7). He quickly rose from being one of a panel of experts to having his own spot in the show and its successors, 'Mainly for Women' and 'Domestic Forum' (1957-60), as well as in the children's series 'Focus' (1959-60). 
These successes led to Bucknell's own series, 'Short Cuts' (1956), followed by 'Do It Yourself' (1960-64), with the presenter dressed in a shirt and tie, his hair slicked back, passing on home-improvement tips -- from wallpapering to mending a dripping tap -- in a quiet, authoritative manner. He later recalled: 'The show was very much a one-man effort. I used to build all the shelves, tables, whatever we were using on the programme, in the basement of my own house and transport them 'en bloc' to the studio. Even the rehearsals used to take place in my basement. The early editions were live, and I was dependent on the floor manager to ensure that things like screws were close at hand. The whole show could fall apart without a few screws, and it didn't look very good if I had to search around for them. And it wasted valuable air-time. (Kingsley and Tibballs, 36)' Some of Bucknell's quick-fix solutions, involving, for instance, covering period features such as fireplaces, were later derided, but he established a reputation as television's Mr DIY (although he was not British broadcasting's first celebrity handyman, that honour going to W. P. Matthew, who contributed to BBC radio before hosting his own television series, 'Household Hints'). Even more popular was 'Bucknell's House' (1962-3), in which the presenter renovated a derelict Victorian terraced property, 79 The Grove, Ealing, London, complete with dry rot, wet rot, and woodworm, over thirty-nine weeks, despite a surveyor advising against the project. The series attracted up to six million viewers and a postbag of 37,000 letters a week, and the house, bought by the BBC for $2,250, was sold at auction for $7,000 in 1964 after being converted into two modern flats. 
With Jack Holt, Bucknell also designed a family sailing dinghy, sponsored by the 'Daily Mirror' -- complete with red Viking sails to match the newspaper's masthead -- which was launched at the 1963 London boat show. More than 90,000 models of the Mirror dinghy were eventually sold and, in 1986, it went on permanent display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. 
Bucknell switched to ITV to present the Sunday lunchtime show 'The ABC of Do It Yourself' (1966), before returning to the BBC for his final series, 'Car Wise' (1967-8). He subsequently contributed to other programmes and appeared in television commercials. In the 1970s he contributed a year-long series of articles to 'TV Times' describing a new 'Bucknell's house' renovation, this time in Luton, but he wound down his television appearances partly because of increasing deafness. He wrote a number of popular books, including 'Do It Yourself' (1960), 'Bucknell's House' (1964), 'The ABC of Do It Yourself' (1966) and 'Barry Bucknell About the House' (1976), as well as the 'Make It Yourself' series (1961). 
Throughout his time as a television presenter Bucknell had continued to work in the family business, of which he became managing director. In later years he spent increasing time on boat design. Retiring with his wife to the Cornish coast, he continued to enjoy his lifelong hobby of sailing. In his younger days he had also been a keen squash player, skier, and glider pilot. He died on 21 February 2003 at his home, The Red House, St Mawes, Truro, Cornwall, of pneumonia, and was survived by his wife, Betty, and their three children.

Hill, (John Edward) Christopher (1912-2003), historian, was born on 6 February 1912 at Norfolk House, Bishopthorpe Road, York, the elder child and only son of Edward Harold Hill, a solicitor, and his wife, Janet Augusta, 'nee' Dickinson. 
Hill was educated at St Peter's School, York, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he read modern history. His family were pillars of the Methodist church in York, and he was brought up in a tradition of strong piety and moral fastidiousness. Although he ceased to be a Christian during his undergraduate years, he never abandoned a more general commitment to good works and simple living, to which he adhered throughout his life. He was profoundly influenced by the egalitarian message of the unorthodox Methodist preacher T. S. Gregory, to whom he dedicated a book more than thirty years later; and he never wavered from his central belief in human freedom and equality, now conceived in secular and this-worldly terms. 
By 1934 (the year he graduated with a first-class degree in modern history) Hill had joined the Communist Party, at a time when the situation in both national and international politics led many idealistic young people to make the same choice. That autumn he was elected a prize fellow of All Souls College, a further sign of the precocious academic talent that had already won him a Brackenbury scholarship to Balliol, then the Lothian prize and a Goldsmiths' senior studentship. In 1935-6, on the advice of his Balliol tutor Humphrey Sumner, he used a scholarship for foreign study to finance a ten-month stay in Moscow, a period during which he became fluent in Russian and established good relations with a group of lively Soviet historians. He was particularly interested in their work on English economic and social history, which had a major influence on his own historical thinking, while he also developed a great liking for Russia and had a love affair with a young Russian woman. On his return he took a post as assistant lecturer at Cardiff, where he remained for two years before returning to Balliol in 1938 as fellow and tutor in history. While at Cardiff he compensated for an unsuccessful attempt to enlist in the International Brigade for service in the Spanish Civil War by notable activism in helping Basque refugees. 
Army service from June 1940 during the Second World War saw Hill rise to the rank of major in the intelligence corps; between 1943 and 1945 he was seconded to the Foreign Office, where he worked in the northern department. On 17 January 1944 he married Inez Waugh, the 23-year-old daughter of Gordon Bartlett, army officer, and the divorced wife of Ian Anthony Waugh. They had one daughter, Fanny. Inez was a lively and sociable woman to whom Hill was passionately attached; the breakdown of this difficult relationship after some ten years was a bitter blow for him. Towards the end of his life and after his death Hill's wartime service in the Foreign Office led to charges that he had concealed his political affiliations, while acting as a Soviet mole and giving prejudiced advice about Stalin's intentions in eastern Europe. These accusations, which had always seemed to rely more on innuendo than hard fact, looked even less plausible when the archival record of Hill's service was examined. The main issue concerned a Committee on Russian Studies, on which Hill sat and of one of whose sub-committees he was secretary, which made some rather tentative plans for the teaching of Russian in post-war Britain. The committee was concerned about the possible difficulties that could arise from the number of Russian exiles teaching the language, whose hostile views might endanger future Anglo-Soviet relations. Among the various proposals was one to employ Soviet citizens among other instructors, a perfectly familiar arrangement for other languages, although in this case it is easy to imagine that security problems would have arisen of a kind few would have foreseen in 1944-5. This suggestion was clearly one made by the committee as a whole, and there is nothing to indicate that Hill played a notably prominent role in such decisions. 
After the war Hill returned to Oxford and his academic career; until 1957, however, he was also deeply involved in the activities of the Communist Party. He would always remember the meetings of the historians' group, with such friends and colleagues as Dona Torr, Rodney Hilton, Victor Kiernan, Eric Hobsbawm, and A. L. Morton, as the centre of his intellectual life over this period, but he also wrote a good deal of what he later described as 'more or less hack party stuff' for a wider audience. An important moment was the foundation of the historical journal 'Past and Present' in 1952, in which Hill was one of the prime movers. 
The events of 1956, with Khrushchov's secret speech to the twentieth party congress, then the Soviet invasion of Hungary, threw the British Communist Party into disarray. For Hill and most of his friends the intellectual dishonesty practised by the leadership became intolerable, with its denial of obvious facts that needed to be confronted. Many left the party immediately. Hill remained for some months longer, serving as a member of the commission on inner party democracy, with which the leadership tried to appease its critics; he finally resigned after presenting a minority report that was voted down overwhelmingly at the party congress in the spring of 1957. Much later he would express his feeling that those who resigned too precipitately had ensured the ultimate demise of the party, but this was surely one of those rare occasions when he allowed sentiment to cloud his judgement, since his principled stand was doomed to fail even had they stayed on to support him. After this he would never engage in active politics again, although he remained instinctively a man of the left, and maintained many of the personal relationships that dated back to these years. 
1956 was a crucial turning point for Hill in other and happier ways; on 2 January that year he married Bridget Irene Mason ['see 'Hill, Bridget Irene (1922-2002)], a fellow communist and a historian who had been a favourite pupil of R. H. Tawney. She was the daughter of Harry Herbert Sutton, Baptist minister, and the former wife of the Marxist historian of science Stephen Mason, with whom the Hills remained on good terms in later years. For more than forty years Bridget and Christopher Hill formed a rare partnership, such that their many friends could hardly conceive of them apart, while they sustained one another in every possible way, in both their personal and their professional lives. There were serious adversities to overcome, for the break with the party, a wrenching experience for both, was followed in 1957 by the death of their first daughter, Kate, in an otherwise minor car accident. In 1986 Hill's daughter from his first marriage, Fanny, drowned when on holiday in Spain. There was compensation in a happy home life with two other children, Andrew ('b'. 1958) and Dinah ('b'. 1960), and in the next generation from two grandchildren, William and Polly Stein, from Fanny's marriage to John Stein. 
Academic life was not always easy for professed communists in the cold war era, and Hill may have found the atmosphere even in Balliol less agreeable after A. D. Lindsay, Baron Lindsay, was succeeded as master by the dour and conservative Sir David Lindsay Keir in 1949. Hill applied for the chair of history at Lord Lindsay's new university of Keele, only to be turned down on the grounds of his political affiliations, which Lindsay apparently feared might damage that fledgeling institution. For twenty years, therefore, he taught a succession of Balliol undergraduates and a growing number of graduate students. As a tutor his style was unusual, even disconcerting, yet he inspired both personal devotion and academic success from a long line of pupils. He projected a remarkable personality, a quality of ferocious determination behind a quiet exterior. Short, wiry, with small neat features beneath an impressive forehead, and curly dark hair receding slightly from a widow's peak, he somehow combined a distinctly curt manner with personal warmth. Underlying shyness was emphasized by a slight stutter, and a curious mannerism of a loud sniff which often preceded some cutting remark. Anyone who supposed that he inculcated Marxist dogma into his credulous pupils was hopelessly wide of the mark, since in his tutorials he relied almost wholly on abrupt questions, then displayed steely resolve in sitting through the longest silences until someone had to offer at least a feeble guess in response. He sat curled up in a curious hammock-like chair, beneath a picture of Oliver Cromwell, and made the pupils do all the work. Most of them must have been startled by the preface to Hill's enormously influential textbook of 1961, 'The Century of Revolution', where he asserted that 'I am conscious that my ideas are at least less half-baked than they would have been if I had not had to defend them in tutorial discussions with pupils, extending now over twenty-five years'. 
When Keir retired in 1965 Balliol chose Hill as the new master, provoking some predictable outrage in the conservative press. What his colleagues had recognized was his intense loyalty to the college and his capacity for pragmatic and consensual action; if there was a revolution in Balliol over the next thirteen years it was one in style, with Hill (ably assisted by Bridget) cultivating a refreshing informality and friendliness at all levels. There were significant if hardly dramatic changes in running the college, including a voice for student representatives, and the way was prepared for the admission of women, which began the year after Hill's retirement. Perhaps the most difficult issues arose from the years of student radicalism after 1968, towards which Hill had very mixed feelings; his instinctive sympathy for libertarian revolt was tempered by a dislike for gesture politics and self-indulgence. In practice he handled the issue with notable skill, avoiding confrontations wherever possible, imposing discipline when really necessary, and offering private help to some of those who got themselves into difficulties. He and Bridget had always shown an exceptional willingness to defend those in personal trouble, most often where sexual behaviour and official morality clashed; a startling number of people had reason to be grateful to them for unobtrusive and tactful help in such matters. 
The unlikely combination of communist activism and headship of an Oxford college (admittedly with a significant time gap) was possible only because of Hill's standing as a historian, and it was as a scholar that he made his major contribution to the intellectual scene of his times. His reputation as a historian can be dated from 1956 and the publication of his first serious academic book, 'Economic Problems of the Church from Archbishop Whitgift to the Long Parliament'. Up to this point, apart from his avowedly political output, he had published only a few articles and two exercises in a rather doctrinaire Marxist style. The first of these, 'The English Revolution, 1640' (1940), was by his own later account the work of an angry young man who expected to die in the war. Although its picture of a bourgeois revolution was hardly convincing, this was still a compelling seventy-page declaration of intent, within which there were prophetic signs of independence from the strict party line. In 1949 he and the future Labour minister Edmund Dell edited a collection of documents, 'The Good Old Cause', whose introductory sections later struck a rather quaint note. If he had been a slow starter, however, Hill made up for this by moving into a period of sustained productivity that would continue into his eighties. His new standing as one of the leading early modern historians in Britain was reflected in the invitation to give the Ford lectures at Oxford in 1962, and in his election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1965. 
In the years of his maturity, the 1960s and 1970s, Hill was the dominant figure in the study of seventeenth-century England. His textbooks led the field, while he was simultaneously pouring out a stream of monographs and articles replete with learning and bursting with ideas. He succeeded, as his predecessors S. R. Gardiner and Sir Charles Firth had not done, in establishing in the public mind that this was the 'century of revolution', the decisive age when England was transformed into a great economic and imperial power, amid the collapse of an old order. It is hard, in retrospect, to recognize just how far the more dramatic and disruptive aspects of the period had previously been written out of the standard account, with its preference for evolutionary change within an essentially benign picture of English constitutionalism and English social development. No historian could have overthrown this orthodoxy on his own, so clearly Hill had caught the mood of the times, and he was followed by a large group of younger scholars, including many of his own pupils. Nor could any form of doctrinaire Marxism have had such an effect, a point underlined by the fact that very few of those who admired his work had ever toyed with Marxist theory. 
By his own account it was an enthusiasm for the metaphysical poets that had first drawn Hill to the seventeenth century, while his Marxism followed from his political commitments rather than inspiring them. In his mature years he adopted the style of a very English empiricist, who rarely offered explicit theoretical statements in his academic work, and he never wrote at any length about the social and economic processes that were at the heart of his original explanatory system, nor attempted grandiose international comparisons. A rare clue to his thinking can be found in a fascinating essay entitled 'A bourgeois revolution?' (in J. G. A. Pocock, ed., 'Three British Revolutions', 1980), in which he claimed that he had no more preconceptions than the next historian, and that his ideas were constantly modified by fresh information. He cited Isaac Deutscher and Lenin, with footnote references to Marx and Engels, to prove his perfect orthodoxy when defining the bourgeois revolution in terms of its outcomes, not its origins. This ingenious piece of dialectic came close to equating Marxism with the identification of any and every process of change and modernization. In practice, therefore, he negotiated himself an enormous loophole, so that he could operate as a radical historian of an undogmatic kind. His ultimate picture of the English revolution was one of multi-faceted change, full of unintended consequences and disappointed hopes, a process which benefited the few at the expense of the many, and ushered in a harsher, more exploitative world. 
Hill's literary interests were reflected in the high quality of his own writing; he cultivated a spare and direct style that always carried the argument forward. At the same time he was exceptionally learned, so that some of his severest critics acknowledged that he probably knew more about the English seventeenth century than any other scholar had ever done. His footnotes were famous, with some essays of otherwise ordinary length boasting as many as 350, referring to hundreds of sources. Prodigious reading in the contemporary printed material and published sources went along with total coverage of modern scholarship. Whatever obscure monograph emerged from an American university press, he bought it, filleted it, then sold it again unless it was really worth keeping. The process was visible in many of his book reviews, with their palimpsest of direct quotations and pithy comments. His methods of work could lead to some intellectual problems, for on occasion he was vulnerable to charges that he took quotations out of context, and that he disregarded evidence that worked against his case. Although he defended himself vigorously on essentials, he was disarmingly ready to admit lapses of this kind, and to emphasize the provisional nature of all historical arguments. This followed from his passionate conviction that the historian should seek to connect up as many aspects of the past as possible, and must be free to speculate about links even when they could not be proved. In the end he probably did exaggerate the extent and speed of change in seventeenth-century England, more through the selective use of evidence than from any theoretical rigidity, but the creative richness of his work was the positive side of this tendency. 
Across his enormous published output Hill often took intellectual risks; it seems unlikely that he ever chose the prudent course in preference to the bold one. When he frequently said that it was more important to stir up debate than to be right, he simply preached what he practised. If 'Economic Problems of the Church' was hard to criticize, its companion volume, 'Society and Puritanism in Pre-Revolutionary England' (1964), ventured onto treacherous ground as Hill sought to explain the worldly reasons why individuals might find puritanism attractive, and laying out some of the possible consequences. This book was as much Weberian as Marxist in its approach, and although Hill's answers did not wholly convince (especially his identification of a 'middling sort' with puritan sympathies), the issues remained live. The Ford lectures appeared as a substantial monograph, 'The Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution' (1965), with key chapters on the ideas of Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Walter Ralegh, and Sir Edward Coke. This was at once a brilliantly original piece of path-finding work and an invitation to destructive criticism, because the attempt to align virtually all critical thinking before 1640 with opposition to the crown could be sustained only through some highly dubious categorization. In 1967 there was another textbook, 'Reformation to Industrial Revolution: a Social and Economic History of Britain, 1530-1780', with a wider chronological range than usual. 'God's Englishman: Oliver Cromwell and the English Revolution' (1970), which was designed more as a set of reflections than a full biography, offered a very insightful view of Cromwell's contradictory impulses and sympathies, from someone who could understand the lord protector's position with unusual empathy. 
Hill's most notable work of the early 1970s came in the small masterpiece 'Antichrist in Seventeenth-Century England' (1971), then in the celebrated book 'The World Turned Upside Down' (1972), which brought an astonishing range of radical thinkers from the revolutionary decades vividly back to life. It was an appropriate tribute that part of this work should later be staged at the National Theatre. In 1977 Hill followed up some brilliant earlier essays on literature with an iconoclastic major work, 'Milton and the English Revolution'. He insisted that Milton's major works were fully comprehensible only in the light of the poet's deep involvement with both the politics and the radical ideas of the interregnum; the case was put forward persuasively and with many qualifications, but attracted a good deal of predictable hostility. A later work that followed a similar pattern was 'A Turbulent and Seditious People: John Bunyan and his Church' (1988), which unexpectedly won the W. H. Smith award. Another book that could be seen as a continuation was 'The Experience of Defeat' (1984), which recounted the poignant story of how different groups of radicals had responded to their failure or suffered for it. There were two other books when Hill was in his eighties, 'The English Bible and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution' (1993) and 'Liberty against the Law: some Seventeenth-Century Controversies' (1996). Although neither would count among his finest work, they were striking evidence of his continued vitality and his capacity to move into new territory. To all these books must be added the major collections of essays, 'Puritanism and Revolution' (1958) and 'Change and Continuity in Seventeenth-Century England' (1974), then the three volumes of 'Collected Essays' (1985-6), actually a selection from about 150 articles that he had published. Two final collections of essays were 'A Nation of Change and Novelty: Radical Politics, Religion and Literature in Seventeenth-Century England' (1990) and 'England's Turning Point: Essays in 17th-Century English History' (1998). 
After his retirement from Balliol in 1978 Hill worked for the Open University for two years as a professor, while continuing to give many lectures, in both formal and informal contexts, as he had done throughout his working life. He and Bridget moved to a rambling old house at Sibford Ferris, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, while continuing to spend much time at their house near Verteillac in the Dordogne. Tragically his last years were blighted by Alzheimer's disease, although this may at least have prevented him from knowing that Bridget had died in July 2002. He died at Southerndown nursing home, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, on 23 February 2003, of cerebral atrophy. He was survived by his son, Andrew, and daughter, Dinah. 
Hill was a great historian, who brought about dramatic changes in the general perception of the seventeenth century, and inspired many others to share his enthusiasms. Above all he enriched knowledge of the period by peopling it with the dazzling array of original and unlikely characters who fill the pages of his finest works, for when he wrote about them he infused his history with the deep humanity and generosity of his own personality, in a truly moving fashion.

Moiseiwitsch, Tatiana Benita (1914-2003), theatre designer, was born on 3 December 1914 at The Grange, Church Road, Barnes, Surrey, the elder child of the Odessa-born pianist Benno Moiseiwitsch (1890-1963) and his wife, the Australian violinist Daisy Fowler, 'nee' Kennedy. Her sister, Sandra, was seven years her junior. Her parents divorced in 1924, and her mother married the poet, playwright, actor, and producer John Drinkwater, with whom she had another daughter. Moiseiwitsch learned of her father's remarriage through the pages of the 'Evening Standard', and later gained a stepbrother through this union. 
By the time she was six Moiseiwitsch had travelled to Australia and America, and in London her family's itinerant life meant that she attended a succession of private schools. Even before her parents' divorce, the demands of her father's international concert tours meant he was absent for long periods. The household was highly disciplined, with both parents assiduously following her progress on the Irish harp and piano. She 'shook like a jelly' (interview, BL NSA) when she had to play for her father and never forgot the occasion when, having listened intently to her recital, he embraced her warmly with the words, 'And that wasn't for your playing, darling' (ibid.). Her short-lived hopes of a career as a dancer were similarly disappointed. It was Drinkwater who suggested she enrol at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where Jeanetta Cochrane and Ruth Keating were influential teachers and courses included costume history. Her mother and stepfather were friends of Lilian Baylis and, while sitting with them in the stalls at the Old Vic, Moiseiwitsch was plucked out by Baylis and asked if she would like to make hats at Sadler's Wells for a production designed by Madam Polunin. Thrown in at the deep end, she recalled, 'I realised you don't say you've never made a hat in your life. You ask, and you just do it. After I'd made one, she said, 'Well, now. We need eight'' (interview, BL NSA). Her down-to-earth approach never left her. She spent a year at the Old Vic, making props and masks, painting scenery, and assisting in the wardrobe department. 
When Keating was appointed designer for Hugh Hunt at the Westminster Theatre, Moiseiwitsch became her assistant, and it was there, in 1934, that she made her debut as a professional designer. The following year Hunt invited her to work with him at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. Nominally on a three-month trial period, she never lost the feeling that she might be asked to leave at any moment, despite designing over fifty productions during her three years at the Abbey. Yeats was a commanding presence: he would eat in total silence before rising with the words, 'I will now taking my chilling presence away' (BL NSA), and Moiseiwitsch was instructed that he must always be allowed to win at croquet. The period with Hunt established the director-designer relationship with which she was most comfortable: 'What I did learn was to trust a director to know what he wanted and to try and give him what he wanted' (ibid.). A true collaborator, not the least of her talents lay in translating the often scant and impressionistic indications given by directors into three-dimensional sets and production styles. A keen researcher, she brought intelligence, invention, and dedication to the relationship, cloaking her immensely supportive qualities and flair with modesty and generosity, happy to leave others in the limelight. As Frith Banbury remembered from his later experience of working with her in London and New York on 'The Deep Blue Sea' and 'The Holly and the Ivy', 'Your opinion was asked all along the line and followed. It was marvellous working with her' (private information). 
During the Second World War Moiseiwitsch honed her skills in London's West End and at the Q Theatre before moving to the Oxford Playhouse. On 19 December 1942 she married Felix Maurice Krish (1916-1943), an actor then serving as a pilot officer in the RAF Volunteer Reserve. His death in a plane crash less than two months after their wedding was a devastating blow. She never remarried. 
Moiseiwitsch embarked on the professional relationship which was to define her career when, in 1944, she accepted an invitation from the director Tyrone Guthrie to join the Liverpool Playhouse, where the Old Vic Company was temporarily based. Back in London they collaborated on, among other productions, the celebrated 'Cyrano de Bergerac' (1946) starring Ralph Richardson, and (less successfully) 'Peter Grimes' for the Royal Opera House (1947). At the Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, in 1950 Moiseiwitsch created a single wooden set for Guthrie's 'Henry VIII', with costumes richly inspired by Holbein, and when Guthrie staged a ground-breaking cycle of four of the histories in 1951 she gave him a permanent set which could be used for all the plays, freeing the action from cumbersome scene changes and encouraging the eye to focus on the actors' bodies, on carefully constructed essential props, and on the rich textures and colours of her textiles. 
It was Moiseiwitsch who helped Guthrie realize his dream of liberating Shakespeare from the proscenium arch when in 1953, in a temporary tent structure, they created a thrust stage for the Festival Theatre, Stratford, Ontario, fundamentally altering the relationship between stage and audience and revolutionizing contemporary thought about the staging of the classics. Rooted in an understanding of how Shakespeare's plays might first have been performed, the solution Moiseiwitsch devised was nevertheless entirely modern and quickly proved itself adaptable to productions set in a wide range of periods. A permanent building on the same principles replaced the tent, and she returned regularly to work in Ontario. She and Guthrie developed their ideas further with the asymmetrical open stage at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis in 1963, where Moiseiwitsch stayed as principal designer until 1966. It was for this space that she designed her acclaimed 'House of Atreus' (1967) -- described by 'Newsweek' as 'awesome and timeless' -- presenting the actors with masks one and a half times human size, enlarged hands, and heightened shoes. 
Moiseiwitsch's career spanned half a century and took her to many countries. For Nick Thompson, architect of the Sheffield Crucible, who worked with her when she was consultant designer (1970-71) on the building, she was 'My guru. I trusted her implicitly' (private information). Although she was sometimes wrongly credited with having influenced the design of the Chichester Festival Theatre, she was in fact highly critical of its auditorium. She sat on the building committee for the National Theatre, where in 1978 she designed 'The Double Dealer' for the Olivier. In the 1970s she worked several times with John Dexter, both for the National Theatre company and at the Metropolitan Opera, New York. She was appointed CBE in 1976. Her last production was 'The Government Inspector' in 1985 at Stratford, Ontario. 
Describing her as 'a romantic firmly grounded in the classics', the novelist Robertson Davies, later a close friend, never forgot his first glimpse of the young Moiseiwitsch and 'the fixity and solemnity of her expression... Amazing also because of the beauty of her eyes, large and dark like those one sees in Russian icons' (Edelstein, 3). Moiseiwitsch had an unusual, heart-shaped face and was physically an unimposing figure yet capable of firmness when required. She relished human foible. Her last home was in Kensington, London, where she lived surrounded by many close friends. In 1994 a touring retrospective exhibition about her work was initiated at the University of Chicago. She died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, of breast cancer, on 19 February 2003.

Morgan, Walter Thomas James (1900-2003), biochemist, was born on 5 October 1900 at 28 Windsor Road, Ilford, Essex, the second child of Walter Morgan, a solicitor's clerk at the Royal Courts of Justice, and his wife, Annie Edith, 'nee' James. He attended the local primary school until the family moved to Little Ilford and he then went to Raine's Foundation School in Whitechapel. There he developed an interest in mechanical engineering, and isometric drawings became his hobby. He left school in 1916 and took a junior technician post with a gas company, where he learned analytical methods for coal tar products. He then moved to a government factory in Greenwich that was producing synthetic phenol. In 1918 he volunteered for the Royal Navy and was posted to a shore-based research and manufacturing station in east London, but his tasks were menial and he became a stoker on a steam-powered truck. 
Morgan's father died in the influenza pandemic in 1918 leaving his mother in precarious financial straits, but he got a government grant for a degree course in chemistry at the East London College. At the London Hospital medical school he learned about the synthetic and degradation pathways of the known organic compounds. To help with the family finances he took a job with a gas company and was asked to find the means to produce gas more efficiently from coal than the method then in use. This he succeeded in doing. The discovery of insulin in 1922 encouraged him to aim for a higher qualification and he worked in the evenings at West Ham Municipal College on the amino acid composition of proteins. After his examination for the MSc one of the examiners, Professor Arthur Harden, wrote suggesting he apply for a studentship at the Lister Institute. He was successful in obtaining a Grocers' Company scholarship, and began work at the institute. His first task was to establish the structure of hexose diphosphonate, and his study of the phosphoric esters was the subject of his PhD thesis in 1927. At Harden's suggestion he then attended a practical course on the microanalysis of organic substances at the University of Graz, as a Beit memorial medical research fellow. In 1928 he was appointed biochemist at the Lister serum and vaccine department at Elstree, where he took up immunology and problems in the production and testing of antisera and bacterial toxins. Over the next ten years he prepared bacterial antigens that were far more suitable for use than the crude preparations used hitherto. On 25 April 1930 he married Dorothy Irene Price (1900/01-1993), also from Little Ilford. She was the daughter of Harold James Price, upholsterer. They had two daughters and one son. 
In 1937 Morgan obtained a Rockefeller research fellowship to study with Professor Tadeusz Reichstein in Zurich. When he returned to the Lister Institute in 1938 he became reader in biochemistry. The outbreak of the Second World War and fears about the dangers of large-scale bacterial cultures in a bomb-threatened city combined with the introduction of the sulphonamides and penicillin to alter his career. Casualties and antibody antigen reactions with incompatible blood transfusions made him think that his experience with bacterial antigens could be usefully applied. Although it was forty years after the ABO blood groups had been established, little was known about their chemical structure. Morgan realized the need to use samples from individual human subjects and the finding, with Ruth van Heyningen, that ovarian cyst fluid was a source of secreted blood group substances was an important breakthrough. By the early 1950s, working with a series of colleagues (notably Winifred Watkins, who joined him in 1942), Morgan had obtained purified preparations of A, B, H, and Lewis blood-group substances and identified them as carbohydrate-amino acid complexes. The complete sequences of the A and B substances were characterized by 1965 and those of the related blood group substances followed. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1949 and served as vice-president of the society from 1961 to 1964, having become professor of biochemistry in 1951 and deputy director of the Lister Institute the following year. He was a member of the Scientific Advisory Council from 1956 to 1960 and of the Medical Research Council from 1966 to 1970. 
Morgan retired as head of the biochemistry department in 1968 and stayed on as a guest worker but was appointed director of the Lister Institute in 1972 when its financial status was insecure. In 1975 he had the sad duty of seeing its closure. Winifred Watkins moved to the clinical research centre at Northwick Park Hospital and Morgan joined her as a guest worker until her retirement in 1989. He continued to work at the bench on blood group substances until he was eighty-nine and remained an active participant at scientific meetings until he was ninety-seven. He received numerous honours and awards in the UK and abroad including the royal medal of the Royal Society (1968), the Landsteiner award of the American Association of Blood Banks (1967), and honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians (1982). He had been appointed CBE in 1959. He remained alert and interested in scientific matters until his death from bronchopneumonia at Woodlands Nursing Home, 38 Smitham Bottom Lane, Purley, Surrey, on 10 February 2003. He was survived by his three children. Among colleagues he was renowned for his meticulous standards and his demands for rigorous scientific proof. He made many lifelong friendships, and all who worked with him admired his modesty and generosity, as well as the originality that made him an outstanding pioneer in the field of immunochemistry.

Saunders, Sir Peter (1911-2003), theatre producer, was born on 23 November 1911 at 56 Springfield Road, Swiss Cottage, London, the second son of Ernest Saunders, manufacturer of razor blades, and his wife, Aletta, 'nee' Myers. He was educated at Oundle School, where he first developed a taste for the stage, and was 'finished' in Lausanne, thanks to the financial backing of an aunt, his father having died of a heart attack while taking the young Peter swimming. Although Saunders's post-war career was entirely devoted to theatre, he began his professional life as a film cameraman, moving on from this rather improbable start (even then he was an imposing figure of a man) to work as a director, journalist, and press agent. During the Second World War he served in the intelligence corps, rising through the ranks to become a captain, and developing a taste for staging army revues. The first West End play he produced, 'Fly Away Peter' (1947), was written by his wartime staff sergeant, A. P. (Alfred Percy) Dearsley. When the play struggled to find audiences Saunders had to ask the actors to take reduced wages; afterwards, he vowed never to ask his performers to shoulder the producer's burden again. That he never had to do so was largely thanks to his rapidly honed theatrical business sense, which proved to be particularly successful when it came to staging Agatha Christie plays. 
Christie was an accomplished playwright as well as a best-selling author, and she found Saunders -- who produced touring versions of her 'Murder at the Vicarage' and 'Black Coffee' (both 1950), as well as her 'The Hollow' (Fortune, 1951) -- professionally competent as well as personally charming and reassuring. In 1951 she offered him a stage adaptation of a radio play ('Three Blind Mice') which she had written for Queen Mary's eightieth birthday, in 1947. Renamed 'The Mousetrap', the play opened on 25 November 1952 at the Ambassadors Theatre, in a production starring Richard Attenborough and his wife, Sheila Sim. The play moved, without break, to the neighbouring St Martin's Theatre in 1974, where it continued until after Saunders's death, establishing a record as the world's longest-running play. An entertaining psychological thriller that in its subject matter was ahead of its time (with a psychotic killer whose derangement was triggered by a woefully unhappy childhood), in every other respect 'The Mousetrap' epitomized the 1950s. The play's longevity was a pleasant surprise to Christie, who had predicted that it would provide Saunders with 'a nice little run of six months' ('Daily Telegraph'), and a profitable one for Saunders and Christie's grandson, Matthew Prichard, to whom she had donated the copyright. That it kept going, developing a seemingly unstoppable momentum, was largely thanks to Saunders's public relations skills. These included well-publicized anniversary events over the years at the Savoy, with an increasingly hunched yet redoubtable Dame Agatha wielding an appropriately dangerous-looking knife to cut the cake. 
In contrast to 'The Mousetrap', Saunders produced the stage version of 'Alfie' (Duchess, 1963), whose cockney anti-hero was later immortalized on film by Michael Caine. That was a relatively short-lived adventure, but he had (having taken over Volcano Productions) another long-runner with 'No Sex Please, We're British' (Strand and Duchess, 1971-86). In all Saunders produced more than 100 plays. Although his taste for light comedy was eventually left behind by a public interested in more demanding and explicit plays, his position as a theatre owner as well as producer meant that he remained in touch with changing theatre tastes, even when they failed to coincide with his own. Among the theatres he ran as owner or lessee were the Ambassadors, the Duchess, St Martin's, the Vaudeville, and the Duke of York's. 
Saunders was twice married: first on 2 May 1959 to (Lily Louise) Ann Stewart (died 1976), a 48-year-old divorcee, and daughter of William Hodgson, diamond cutter; and secondly in 1979 to Caterina Imperiali di Francavilla Baylis, the Italian-born television presenter known as Katie Boyle. There were no children of either marriage. Saunders was no stranger to television himself: he was a founding director of Yorkshire Television in 1967. He was also heavily involved in radio, producing many programmes for Radio Luxembourg and being a founding member of the consortium that in 1973 successfully bid for the opportunity to create a London-wide independent radio station (later named Capital Radio). 
The combination of Saunders's theatrical experience -- recognized by a knighthood in 1982 -- his 'dignitas' (lightened by flashes of humour and an engaging smile), and his administrative skills, made him ideal for a number of high-profile positions in the theatre industry. These included twice being president of SWET (the Society of West End Theatres), from 1961 to 1962 and 1967 to 1969, and president of both the Stage Golfing Society and the Stage Cricket Club. As the last two offices suggest, he had some conventional recreational tastes, but in a pre-mobile phone culture he was unusual in listing, in 'Who's Who', 'telephoning' as one of his hobbies. He also listed 'collecting wills', as he found in them a fascinating insight into people's characters. Although proud of his extensive producing career, which he followed until his retirement in 1994, he was well aware that his place in theatre history depended very largely on 'The Mousetrap'. He recognized this not just by calling his autobiography 'The Mousetrap Man' (1972), but by naming his house (3 Canon's Close, the Bishops Avenue, Hampstead) Monkswell. This was the name of the country house hotel where the action of 'The Mousetrap' took place, but his own death (at home, of heart failure and bronchopneumonia, on 6 February 2003) was in peaceful contrast to the elegantly plotted murders whose popularity had enabled him to buy a house in one of London's most expensive streets. He was survived by his wife, Katie, and left an estate valued for probate purposes at more than $11 million.

Smith, Sir John Cyril (1922-2003), jurist, was born on 15 January 1922 at 7 Headlam Terrace, Barnard Castle, co. Durham, the second son of Bernard Smith, manager of an iron foundry, and his wife (Alice) Madeline, 'nee' Shearwood. He attended St Mary's Grammar School, Darlington, and then worked in the family business as a civil engineer until joining the Royal Artillery in 1942. It was during his military service, in which he served in India and Burma and rose to the rank of captain, that he attended a lecture on law that sparked his interest in the subject. After demobilization in 1947 he was admitted to Downing College, Cambridge, to read law. He took a first in 1949 and graduated LLB in 1950, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn and appointed assistant lecturer in law at the University of Nottingham the same year. He became a lecturer in 1952, reader in 1956, and professor in 1958. On 5 September 1957 he married Shirley Ann Walters (died 2000), a 22-year-old shorthand typist and daughter of Maurice Louis Walters, shipping clerk. They had two sons, Mark and Andrew, and a daughter, Amanda. 
Smith had joined the law department at the University of Nottingham in its earliest days, and as head of department from 1956 to 1987 (he also served as university pro-vice-chancellor in 1973-7) he led and shaped it into a leading law school, with a high standing both in the legal profession and among legal scholars. He was respected as a supportive head of department, who would always find time to talk to his students and to encourage young lecturers. 
Despite this long-standing administrative load Smith published frequently and widely. Already the author of many articles by the early 1960s, he embarked on the major project of writing a modern textbook on the criminal law. He subsequently called upon a young colleague, Brian Hogan, and in 1965 they produced the first edition of Smith and Hogan's 'Criminal Law', one of the most successful legal textbooks of the second half of the twentieth century. It was acclaimed by students, teachers, practitioners, and judges for its clear and rigorous analysis of the law and its willingness to criticize and to propose solutions where statute or case law was found wanting. Smith's critical framework was that of subjectivism, arguing that it was wrong to convict a person in the absence of proof that he or she intended or knowingly risked causing the prohibited consequence. Smith also became the leading case commentator in the 'Criminal Law Review', and judicial decisions that strayed towards objectivism, imposing criminal liability for unknown or unforeseen consequences, were met with unremitting criticism that some judges found uncomfortably blunt. 
Smith served as a long-standing member of the Criminal Law Revision Committee until its demise in 1985 (having first joined it as a co-opted member in 1960), as special adviser to the House of Lords select committee on murder and life imprisonment (1988-9), and then as an assessor to Sir John May's inquiry into the Guildford bombing case (1989-92). But it was for his work on the draft criminal code that he was most notable. He chaired a small team of academic lawyers who worked from 1981 to 1985 to prepare a report and draft 'Criminal Code Bill', which the Law Commission published for consultation. A slightly modified version was then published as a Law Commission report in 1989. The government of the day showed no enthusiasm for putting the bill before parliament, despite the encouragement of leading judges. There was a brief period of optimism after the election of a new government in 1997, but by the time of his death Smith was becoming wearied by the widening gap between aspirational statements and real progress in enacting a criminal code. 
Although the criminal law was Smith's main preoccupation he also lectured and wrote with distinction on the law of contract (J. C. Smith and J. A. C. Thomas, 'A Casebook on Contract', 11th edn, 2000), on the law of evidence ('Understanding the Law of Evidence', 1994), and on criminal procedure. His formal retirement in 1987 did not result in either a reduction in his publications or a withdrawal from discussions with his colleagues. Indeed, he was accorded the title of emeritus professor in residence, and continued to go into the law department at Nottingham regularly. He also continued to give lectures to judges in judicial studies board seminars, never shrinking from expressing criticisms, albeit gently, when he detected error, inconsistency, or elements of objectivism. He received many honours and distinctions, including election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1973. He was appointed CBE in 1983 and knighted in 1993. A slight man, whose hair was white from an early age, Smith had a wry sense of humour and a modesty that he would jokingly defend by saying that 'flattery is all right so long as you don't inhale' (personal knowledge). He had suffered from angina for many years, and was shocked when his wife, Shirley, predeceased him in 2000. He recovered to see one more edition of Smith and Hogan (the tenth) through to publication in 2002. He died at University Hospital, Nottingham, on 14 February 2003, of heart failure. He was survived by his three children.

Thistlethwaite, Frank (1915-2003), historian and university administrator, was born on 24 July 1915 at 11 Powell Street, Burnley, Lancashire, the elder son of Lee Thistlethwaite (1885-1973), cotton cloth merchant and manufacturer, and his wife, Florence Nightingale, 'nee' Thornber (1892-1983). Both sides of the family came from a long line of nonconformist ancestors in the north-east Lancashire cotton industry, who had risen from handloom weavers to manufacturers. 
Thistlethwaite was educated at Coal Clough elementary school and the grammar school in Burnley before going on to the Quaker Bootham School in York. From there he gained an open exhibition in history at St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied history and English. He also edited the 'Cambridge Review' and acquired an admiration for New Deal America. Accordingly he won a Commonwealth Fund fellowship in 1938 to study at the University of Minnesota. He travelled in the mid-west and California, and there he met Jane Hosford (1918-1992), daughter of H. Lindley Hosford, of Lyme, Connecticut; they married on 11 August 1940 and had three daughters and two sons. 
Thistlethwaite had intended to return to wartime Britain but was urged by the British ambassador to stay to work for the British Library and its offshoot the British Press Service, where he worked with a team which included Isaiah Berlin, providing the British view of the war to (neutral) American journalists and reporting on the American media coverage for the Foreign Office. However, he determined to return to Britain in November 1941 and, his eyesight disqualifying him from a flying commission, he modestly enlisted in the RAF as an aircraftsman second class, becoming a radar plotter at Rudloe Manor, Wiltshire. This underuse of his abilities was rectified by Geoffrey Crowther, who recruited him to the Ministry of Production in June 1942. He joined the joint American secretariat of the war cabinet office to co-ordinate supply issues with the Americans under the 'Lend Lease Act', and was co-secretary of the North American supplies committee, with the temporary rank of principal. In 1945 he returned to Washington with the British civil secretariat, the counterpart of the joint American secretariat, then went back to the war cabinet as secretary of the UK delegation to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration council. 
At the end of the war Thistlethwaite chose to return to Cambridge as a fellow of St John's College rather than continue his already high-level civil service career. His mission as a Cambridge academic was the development of American studies. He attended the first Salzburg seminar in American studies in 1947. As lecturer in American economic history he taught the new history of the USA course for part one of the historical tripos, became secretary of the Cambridge conference of the Fulbright Commission in 1952, and was a moving spirit in creating the British Association of American Studies in 1956, serving as chairman until 1959. His reputation was underpinned by his books 'The Great Experiment' (1955) and 'The Anglo American Connection' (1958), and as visiting professor at Rochester, New York (1950), Princeton (1954), and Pennsylvania (1956). Within American studies he developed a special interest in Atlantic migration, his paper on this at the Stockholm Congress of Historical Sciences in 1960 being regarded as seminal in such studies. 
Thistlethwaite's background of high administrative work in the 1940s and innovative academic writing in the 1950s made him the ideal vice-chancellor for the new University of East Anglia, where he was appointed in 1961. He brought fresh ideas to Norwich based on his own experience. First was a belief in interdisciplinary studies rather than single-subject degrees. His own Cambridge studies and teaching had been in history, English, and economics, and the Salzburg seminar had shown the virtues of the multi-disciplinary approach. American studies became a school at East Anglia, linked with English. Secondly he introduced American-style seminar teaching and coursework assessment, which later became commonplace at other universities. Thirdly, his artistic sensibilities shaped the university. His lifelong interest in architecture (he was an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects) determined him to make the East Anglia site the location of some of the finest campus architecture in Britain, by Bernard Feilden, Denys Lasdun, and Norman Foster among others. His friendship with Sir Robert and Lady Sainsbury led to the donation of their priceless art collection and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, designed by Foster. A concert-class pianist himself, he created the school of music, led by Philip Ledger and advised by Benjamin Britten. 
In 1980 Thistlethwaite retired to Cambridge as an honorary fellow of St John's College and chairman of the Friends of the University Library. He had been appointed CBE in 1979 and was awarded honorary degrees from East Anglia, Minnesota, and Colorado. In retirement a visiting chair at Minnesota resulted in his book on seventeenth-century Dorset migrants to New England. He also wrote four volumes of autobiography. He died of pneumonia and heart failure at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 17 February 2003, and was cremated in Cambridge on 24 February. He was survived by three daughters and a son, one son having died in 1951 and his wife, Jane, having also predeceased him.

Wilberforce, Richard Orme, Baron Wilberforce (1907-2003), judge, was born on 11 March 1907 at Jullundur, India, the son of Samuel Wilberforce (1874-1954), a member of the Indian Civil Service, and later a judge of the High Court in Lahore, and his wife, Catherine (died 1963), daughter of John Sheepshanks, bishop of Norwich. His grandfather, Reginald Wilberforce, as a young ensign in the 52nd light infantry, had reached India just in time for the outbreak of the mutiny in May 1857; he fought in the retaking of Delhi and in the suppression of the mutiny. Reginald's father was Samuel Wilberforce, the disputatious bishop of Oxford (and later of Winchester). The bishop's father was William Wilberforce, the emancipator. Wilberforce was proud of his ancestry -- publishing the letters of his father and the mutiny chapter written by his grandfather, and anxious to defend his great-grandfather from crude misrepresentation in the Darwin controversy. But undoubtedly the greatest influence was William Wilberforce. Wilberforce studied the life and works of his ancestor William and placed him on a pinnacle. 
Two days after Wilberforce's birth his father wrote home admiringly to his own mother: 'I had no idea that babies could be so nice, but I don't suppose that they generally are... He has well formed features and a most determined mouth and chin and a big head. I shall be very surprised if he does not turn out full of brains and resolutions. (Wilberforce, 'Reflections', 2-3)' As a boy Wilberforce spent the first seven years of his life in India. In 1914, with the outbreak of the First World War, he was sent back to England with his younger sister. They were looked after by their maternal grandmother and their Aunt Doll. He attended five preparatory schools, the last being Sandroyd, which he regarded as the best investment his parents ever made: 'with only two years they brought me up to scholarship level' (ibid., 10). Thus equipped he was sent in June 1920 to sit the exam at Winchester. He won a place in college. 
Wilberforce was happy at Winchester College and started to do well in his studies, especially in mathematics. The headmaster, Monty Rendall, played a decisive role in persuading him to drop mathematics and switch to classics: 'Wilberforce (he said), you are doing well with Maths, and I've no doubt that you could go on to Cambridge, become a Wrangler, most probably a Professor; these are good but narrow options. If you want a wider choice and greater opportunities in public life, you must go for the humanities. ('Reflections', 13)' Wilberforce accepted this advice, dropped maths, and threw himself into the classics. By the time he left Winchester he had achieved all four of the so-called 'medal tasks' (the top prizes for composition of both prose and poetry, in Latin and Greek). He later acknowledged that the decision to switch from mathematics had been right. But his original interest was ineradicable. His mind constantly reverted to mathematical problems and scientific discoveries. As he later wrote, 'It is certainly remarkable how, in sleep or waking condition, my thoughts tend to circle round mathematical discoveries and problems' (ibid., 85). 
From Winchester, Wilberforce moved effortlessly to New College, Oxford, where he was assured of a place and a scholarship on his academic record. He read the classics. As expected, in 1928 he got a first in classical moderations, followed two years later by a first in 'literae humaniores'. He won the leading prizes in classics: the Craven, Hertford, and Ireland scholarships. He then moved to London and studied for the bar at the Middle Temple; he was called in 1931. He had the good fortune to be accepted as a pupil by the legendary Wilfred Hunt, for many years the busiest junior at the chancery bar. A co-pupil was his friend Herbert Hart. 
In 1932, on his third attempt, Wilberforce was elected a prize fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. It was a year for some unfortunate asides, which were overheard by the candidates. At the candidates' dinner, when the port decanter was being circulated, the glass stopper fell from Wilberforce's nerveless grasp and smashed his dessert plate. A large slice slid across the table into the lap of Sir Charles Oman, who was heard to observe, 'That was one of the old plates' ('Reflections', 20). Another candidate was Isaiah Berlin. As he left the room after the formal viva he heard the warden say to the senior fellow, 'I hope we don't have to have that one' (ibid., 183). Fate decreed otherwise. The successful candidates (unusually, three rather than two) were Berlin, Patrick Reilly (who subsequently had a distinguished career as a diplomat), and Wilberforce. He remained a fellow -- in one category or another -- until his death, over seventy years after his first election. 
Eschewing an academic career, Wilberforce spent the rest of the 1930s establishing a practice at the chancery bar in the chambers of Andrew Clark. It was a struggle -- he had no family connections and very modest chances of inheriting work from others in the chambers. His earnings were meagre, though the work flow began to pick up by the end of the period. During this time he regularly kept a diary, which was privately printed in 1996 as 'Thirty in the Thirties'. Naturally there is information about his attempts to establish a practice. What is of extraordinary fascination, however, is the account given in the diary of his social, intellectual, and cultural life. Although he was not well off, everything seems to have been within his grasp -- opera (Covent Garden and Glyndebourne), ballet (including Diaghilev), theatre, films, and foreign travel. He was fluent in French and German. Having visited Germany as a schoolboy, he went again in 1932 and as late as 1938. There were many visits to France and Italy. 
The dark background to Wilberforce's diary account was the rise of Nazi Germany, leading on to the seizure of Czechoslovakia and Austria. Wilberforce deplored the weakness of the response by Britain and other countries, and came to fear that war was inevitable. He joined the reserves in 1938 after Munich and on the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 volunteered for service in the army, ignoring advice that it was not in his interests to do so. 
Norway was the scene of Wilberforce's first military exploit. The war cabinet decided in the spring of 1940 that Britain must go to the aid of Norway, which had been invaded by Germany. Major-General Bernard Paget was put in charge of the expeditionary force. Paget was a brilliant soldier with wide experience of staff work. His aide-de-camp was Second Lieutenant Richard Wilberforce, Royal Artillery, who had no experience as a staff officer. The venture lasted three weeks. Wilberforce regarded them as the best three weeks of his life. The British intervention was, of course, doomed from the start. It was too little and too late. Wilberforce's diary records his admiration for Paget, in particular his integrity in dealing with the Norwegian army commanders. At the other end of the scale from admiration were his views about the 'dugouts' in the War Office who were supposed to have planned the operation. 
Paget was clearly impressed by Wilberforce in action in Norway, and invited him to accompany him to France. But the trip was aborted by the loss of a destroyer and by Dunkirk. Deprived of a French campaign, Wilberforce was deployed in various staff appointments until -- 'mirabile dictu' -- he was made a lieutenant-colonel at the War Office in charge of army entertainments: he was supposed to bring order into amateur chaos. Then in 1944 he joined the supreme headquarters of the allied expeditionary force (SHAEF) in a unit under another fellow of All Souls, John Foster. The role of Foster's unit was to take over the administration of Germany after its hoped-for surrender. At SHAEF Wilberforce met and played bridge with Eisenhower, whom he admired. He also had a spell under Field Marshal Montgomery, and was 'struck by his limitless egoism and naivety -- rather likeable' ('Reflections', 157). 
By 2 May 1945 Germany was seen to be falling apart. Hitler's death was announced, and Doenitz proclaimed his own succession. The next day Wilberforce was instructed to draft appropriate surrender documents to cover what he called in his diary 'various eventualities', that is different types of surrender. He duly drafted three documents, covering total surrender, a military surrender, and merely an agreement to meet later and discuss. The second was the one actually adopted and it was signed in Berlin on 8 May by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel and others. 
After the German surrender Wilberforce became head of the British legal section of the four-power Control Commission for the administration of Germany. He held the rank of brigadier and worked in Berlin with his equal-ranking American, Russian, and French counterparts. They had vast powers and responsibilities -- broadly to sweep away all traces of the Nazi regime, by abolishing or denazifying the existing laws, and by replacing its officials, judges, professors, trade union officials, and so on with 'clean' substitutes. Needless to say the search for such people after twelve or so years of totalitarian rule was no easy task. One day a new French counterpart arrived, Roger Lenoan, an academic lawyer recently appointed as a judge of the cour de cassation. With him came his daughter, Captain Yvette Marie Lenoan. Two years later Wilberforce and Yvette were engaged and they married in July 1947. They had two children, Anne Catherine and Samuel (Sam). In 1946 Wilberforce had left the Control Commission in Berlin and become a civil servant in London with the rank of under-secretary at the Control Office for Germany and Austria. He spoke of this as the best civil service job in the world. 
The Control Office was abolished in 1947, so Wilberforce returned to the bar -- a year too late. The old set of chambers had disappeared but Wilberforce managed to get accommodation of a sort together with Andrew Clark and Duff Dunbar. For the next few years he eked out an existence with Foreign Office cases (including 'Corfu Straits' and 'Norwegian Fisheries') and was appointed as British legal member of the International Civil Aviation Authority. The practice built up and he took silk in 1954. In 1956 he was the lead author of 'The Law of Restrictive Practices', for many years the authoritative text, and was appointed CMG for his services in connection with the Warsaw convention on international carriage by air. Famous cases now came his way, such as 'J. Bollinger v. Costa Brava Wine Company' (the so-called 'Spanish champagne' case) in 1960. In the meantime, in 1950, he had stood as Conservative candidate for Central Hull -- the city which William Wilberforce had represented. Fortunately he lost -- fortunately, because the opening of a new career in parliament might have deprived the law of one of its great luminaries. Hull was later to capture him in another role, as chancellor of the university (1978-94). 
Wilberforce was appointed a chancery judge (and knighted) in 1961. After a mere three and a half years (most unusually without any intervening appointment to the Court of Appeal) he was elevated direct to the House of Lords, where he sat as a law lord for the next eighteen years. (Notwithstanding that speedy advance, there is a half self-mocking, half serious complaint in one of his autobiographical notes that if only he had been made a chancery judge a little bit earlier he could have sat in the Lords until he was ninety.) As a law lord he heard 465 appeals. He gave individual judgments in very many of them. Of this vast body of work one may fairly say that as a judge at the highest level he left a corpus of judgments, covering a huge area of the law, which stand comparison for their scope and brilliance with the judgments of any other British judge of the twentieth century. 
It is scarcely possible in a short space to give any sort of impression of the richness and power of this corpus of decisions. Any selection will appear entirely arbitrary to others with knowledge of his achievement. There would perhaps be unanimity however on the point that the most important decision that Wilberforce rendered while a judge in the chancery court was in striking down the well-established retention and transfer system that governed the livelihoods of all professional footballers in the United Kingdom. The case was 'Eastham v. Newcastle United Football Club and others' (1964). The 'others' included the Football Association and the Football League. In the teeth of the opposition of these big battalions Wilberforce held that the long-accepted system imposed an unjustifiable restraint on the freedom of individual footballers to further their own careers and was thus contrary to public policy. In a characteristic passage he said: 'The transfer system has been stigmatised by the plaintiff's counsel [Gerald Gardiner QC] as a relic from the Middle Ages, involving the buying and selling of human beings as chattels; and, indeed, to anyone not hardened to the acceptance of the practice it would seem inhuman, and incongruous to the spirit of a national sport.' No appeal was brought against this decision notwithstanding its profound economic repercussions for the football industry.Illustrative cases from the House of Lords records demonstrating Wilberforce's logical thought, clarity of expression, and imaginative insight include: 'Prenn v. Simmonds' (1971), giving guidance as to how contractual documents are to be construed in the light of the factual background known to the parties when they contract, and with reference to the aim and genesis of the transaction; 'Ebrahimi v. Westbourne Galleries' (1973), elucidating the concept of winding up a company on 'just and equitable' ground and recognizing the role to be played by equitable considerations in affecting legal rights; 'General Tire v. Firestone' (1975), restating the classical basis for the award of damages for infringement of a patent and repudiating a heretical 'tertium quid' basis (what ought the infringer fairly to have paid?); 'Hesperides Hotels v. Aegean Holidays' (1979), reasserting the established rule that English courts will not entertain actions claiming damages for trespass to foreign land or claims of conspiracy to commit such trespass; and 'British Steel Corporation v. Granada TV' (1981), rejecting (notwithstanding the dissent of Lord Salmon) a plea that journalists were in a privileged position and were entitled to refuse to disclose the sources of their information. 
During his lifetime Wilberforce's decisions were held in high regard and regularly cited with approval. One exception was his attempt in 'Anns v. Merton London Borough Council' (1978) to restate the law of negligence as a simple double test applicable to cases where a local authority had responsibilities in relation to (say) the inspection of the foundations of newly built houses. His test was ultimately found to give rise to more problems than it solved and a seven-man panel of law lords finally declared it to be erroneous in 'Murphy v. Brentwood District Council' (1991). 
From the viewpoint of the advocate, Wilberforce was as close to perfection as it was possible to get: ever courteous, totally in command of the facts and the relevant law, never intervening to show his superior knowledge, never bullying, always encouraging, questioning in order to direct or sharpen the argument, not to deflate or crush. Sometimes he would give a prod to hasten the progress of a case or cut short a hopeless argument. But it was done with such grace and charm that no feathers were ruffled. 
In 1971, when Wilberforce had been a law lord for some seven years, he was asked to be the chairman of an inquiry into the pay and conditions of electricity workers. He took on the job and resolved the dispute. Some thought he had been too generous but on the whole his work met with praise. In February 1972 a new and more formidable task was committed to him. This was to find a solution to the long-running miners' strike. It was clear that the government urgently needed an end to the strike. The country was paralysed, industry was at a standstill, hospitals and patients were at risk. Seven days after he was appointed Wilberforce and his two colleagues handed their report to the government, recommending a new pay structure for the miners on the basis that they were a special case. The feat was achieved by Wilberforce's relentless energy and stamina. The effort (including lack of sleep) imposed a very serious strain on his health. The report ended the strike, but the scale of the wage increases for miners which the committee recommended was much criticized in public and savagely in private by ministers and mandarins. Wilberforce felt that his supreme effort was regarded with contempt and that he himself had been banished from the ranks of the great and the good. It was years before he was again asked to undertake any sort of extra-judicial inquiry. When asked, he declined. 
In the House of Lords Wilberforce contributed often to debates on the floor of the house. He was a voice of authority and he was heard with deep respect. He was a passionate supporter of the institution and its works. After his eighteen years as a law lord he continued as an active member of the Lords for a further twenty-one years, regularly taking part in its debates. Even when a law lord he was not over-impressed by fashionable arguments about the separation of powers. With a strongly pragmatic approach to problems, he saw no harm in a law lord initiating a debate on, or intervening in, such topics as law reform, higher education, treaty implementation, or the protection of the weak -- to name but four matters where his interests were heavily involved. He would never allow himself to sit judicially in any cause where he might conceivably be thought to be 'parti pris'. Short of abolition the worst thing that he thought could happen to the Lords was that it should be infiltrated by elected members. 
His maiden speech was made on 1 April 1965 on what was an ideal occasion for him -- the second reading debate on a bill to set up the two law commissions, one for England and Wales and a second for Scotland. Naturally he was an enthusiastic supporter of the bill, and with his range of knowledge and imaginative insight he was able to make a persuasive case for it. He argued that there was a need for a standing body to undertake law reform; that the existing 'ad hoc' committees, though doing excellent work, were inadequate; that there was much to be done as regards codification of the law; and that comparison with other legal systems was essential, to prevent insularity and widen the options. Though he welcomed the idea of academic lawyers serving on the commission, he wanted a lay element: 'If the generals will forgive me for pirating the expression, law reform is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the lawyers' ('Hansard 5L', 1 April 1965, 264.117). Apart from law reform another frequent subject for Wilberforce's speeches was slavery, ancient and modern. Indeed, both his last two speeches -- delivered on 13 March and 25 June 2002 -- were directed against the trade of trafficking human beings: victims of exploitation and forced labour, enforced mercenaries, and so on. He accepted that it was more difficult to stamp out the modern form of slavery. As he said, 'Anyone can recognise a slave; it is not so easy to recognise a victim of trafficking.' 
Wilberforce had joined the Anti-Slavery Society as a member in 1932. In 1934 he was asked to serve on the general committee. He rose to become a vice-president and then joint president in 1970, and he remained president until his death. When the City of London gave a dinner in 1972 to celebrate the bicentenary of the decision in the case of James Somerset (the slave whom Lord Mansfield, with some hesitancy, refused to return to his owner) Wilberforce was asked to propose one of the toasts. He worked tirelessly and to the end of his life in the interests of the society -- fund-raising, travelling abroad, speaking in parliament, and giving advice. 
Wilberforce was also active in numerous professional bodies, including the International Law Association, whose executive committee he chaired from 1966 to 1988. He was president of the Federation Internationale du Droit Europeen in 1978, and a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. An interest in music saw him made joint vice-president of the Royal College of Music, and an honorary fellow. He received honorary degrees from Oxford, London, Hull, and Bristol universities; and he was high steward of Oxford University and visitor of Wolfson and Linacre colleges. 
Perhaps the secret of perpetual youth is endless curiosity. Wilberforce made his own collection of quotations in a 'not so commonplace' book. He included one from Walter Pater: 'To burn always with this hard gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life. Failure is -- to form habits, for habit is relative to a stereotyped world.' He never formed such habits. Everything new held a fascination for him: new people (he always wanted to sit next to the latest prize fellows at All Souls: as he talked no age barrier existed); the latest scientific ideas, be they about black holes, DNA, or a 'beautiful' proof of a difficult theorem; the latest exhibition at the Royal Academy; or difficult music, such as by Stockhausen and others. When the Eurostar service to Paris opened he was on the first available train. And so with the Jubilee line: Wilberforce was on the first train, and getting out at every station to study the architecture. 
Wilberforce had a combination of qualities that was, among his contemporaries, probably unique. With a superb mind and a retentive memory; imaginative; humorous; sensitive in art and music; and sensitive in all human contacts, he was extremely modest and entirely lacking in arrogance or self-importance, enabling him to talk without condescension and on easy terms to fellow peers and small children, to the clever and the not so clever. 
Suffering from prostate cancer, Wilberforce died on 15 February 2003 at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea, London, of a chest infection. He was survived by his wife, Yvette, his daughter, Anne Catherine, and his son, Samuel. His funeral service was held on 22 February; memorial services were held at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 15 May 2003, the University of Hull on 20 May 2003, All Souls College on 26 October 2003, and the Temple Church on 27 October 2003. His 'Reflections on My Life', edited by his son, was published posthumously in 2003.

Young, Edward Preston (1913-2003), designer and submariner, was born on 17 November 1913 in San Fernando, Trinidad, the son of William Young (died after 1956), general trader. Following the family's move to England, Young attended Highgate School, London. Despite showing little interest in most academic disciplines, he developed a proficiency in English literature and, on leaving school aged seventeen, sought work in the publishing industry. An unsuccessful interview with Stanley Unwin led him to the offices of The Bodley Head, a well-established but financially troubled firm of which the youthful Allen Lane became chairman in 1930. Lane employed him as a junior clerk and, with his interest in typography and design, Young soon became responsible for many of the company's press advertisements. 
In 1934 Lane made the decision to establish a series of high-quality but inexpensive paperback titles. Impressed by the colophon used by the German publisher Albatross, he wanted his own imprint to be named after an animal or bird. Various suggestions were considered before Lane's secretary, Joan Coles, suggested a penguin. Lane duly sent Young to London Zoo to sketch the birds. Young's drawing, and the resulting penguin colophon -- jaunty, playful, and appealing -- came to symbolize a revolution in British reading habits. By reprinting established hardback titles in cheap paperbound editions, Lane's new company, Penguin Books, vastly expanded the audience for quality literature and was recognized, alongside institutions such as the BBC, as an agency for popular education. Penguin, as Young later recalled, '[got] rid of the idea that the only people who wanted cheap editions belonged to a lower order of intelligence' ('Book Collector', 1952, 210). In his role as the firm's first production manager, Young created a design template that captured Lane's tastes and publishing values. The gaudy pictorial covers of most existing paperbacks were rejected in favour of a plain, stylish aesthetic that carried an aura of modest respectability. Two bands of solid colour at the top and bottom of the cover were separated by a clear white panel on which the author's name and book title were printed in Eric Gill's sans serif font, with the colour schemes of the upper and lower bands corresponding with different genres: orange for fiction, green for crime, dark blue for biography, and cerise for adventure. To emulate their more prestigious hardback equivalents, Young also provided Penguin Books with dustcovers that replicated the cover image. When the 'Pelican' imprint was created as a format for the firm's original non-fiction in 1937, Young produced a second colophon of a serious-looking bird that projected the educational tone of the works it adorned. It remained in use until a minor redesign was carried out by William Grimmond in 1947. 
In July 1939 Young left Penguin for financial reasons and joined another paperback publisher, Reprint Books. However, his tenure in the firm was interrupted by the onset of the Second World War. A keen yachtsman, Young entered the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant and, after receiving training in Sussex, undertook his first patrol in the submarine 'H28' in October 1940. After being transferred to HMS 'Umpire' in July 1941, he narrowly escaped when the boat was accidentally rammed and sunk by a trawler that was escorting a convoy off the Norfolk coast. Young was one of two men who successfully escaped, without equipment, from the conning tower as the submarine lay on the seabed. Twenty-two men were drowned in the disaster. 
Following periods of service in the north Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Young was ordered to take the commanding officer's qualifying course in early 1943. Having passed this notoriously challenging programme, he became the first RNVR officer to captain an operational submarine when he took command of HMS 'P555' on 23 March 1943. From June 1943 until the end of hostilities Young commanded the newly built HMS 'Storm' on patrols with the Far Eastern Fleet, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. While at sea he attempted to boost the morale of his men by writing light-hearted news sheets that informed them about destinations and future plans. He was promoted commander on his return to Britain in April 1945, and finished his naval career in a staff post on HMS 'Cyclops' stationed on the Isle of Arran. 
On 14 April 1945, at Westminster register office, Young married Diana Lilian Jequier (1916-2003), daughter of George Augustus Graves, restaurateur. The couple had two daughters, and in the year of his marriage Young returned to publishing as the production manager for Pan Books. However, he left a year later to become the director of a new firm -- Rupert Hart-Davis -- which adopted an image and editorial style that was more akin to the Penguin model he had helped to establish before the war. It was Rupert Hart-Davis who first published Young's best-selling war memoir, 'One of our Submarines' (1952), which Penguin, in honour of their first production manager, reprinted as its 1000th title in 1954. A modest account written in cheerful and accessible prose, the book was a fitting symbol of the achievements of its author and publisher, and remains in print in the twenty-first century. Following the dissolution of his first marriage, Young married, on 7 July 1956 at St Marylebone register office, Mary Reoch Cressall (1915-2001), the daughter of Thomas Strang, tea merchant. 
Over the next decade Young wrote more non-fiction books on a range of topics, including 'Forty Years of Motoring' (1959) and 'Look at Submarines' (1964). In 1970 he became managing director of the Rainbird Group before retiring three years later to Domme in the Dordogne, where he and Mary wrote the 'Shell Guide to France' (1979). In his later years Young returned to England and lived at Rustington, Sussex. He died, at Lobswood House residential home, Littlehampton, on 28 January 2003. He was survived by the two daughters of his first marriage, and his first wife, who died in March of that year. Though less prevalent in Penguin's published output from the 1960s, Young's original banded cover design has continued to exert a significant influence on the company's image and in associated brands. In 2009 a set of postage stamps marking classic British design included Young's Penguin cover for Vita Sackville-West's 'The Edwardians'.

John Hayes St Leger (1756-1800), army officer, courtier, and rake, was born on 23 July 1756, the eldest son of John St Leger (1726-1769) of Grangemellon, co. Kildare, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Colonel Thomas Butler. Educated at Eton College (1767-70), he received a commission on 24 September 1778 as captain in the 55th regiment of foot. He was promoted major in the 90th foot on 26 November 1779 before transferring to the 80th foot in 1780, in which regiment he was made lieutenant-colonel on 25 October 1782. By this time 'Handsome Jack' St Leger was an intimate of George, prince of Wales. Already an accomplished rake, having some years earlier cut a swathe through the 'demi-monde' of Louis XVI's court in France, St Leger's roistering incurred the disapproval of George III, who warned the prince against emulating 'conduct that makes all good men despise a St Leger' (Aspinall, 1.44). The prince, in contrast, considered St Leger 'one of ye best fellows yt. ever lived' (ibid., 1.57), commissioned portraits of them both by Thomas Gainsborough, and in February 1784 appointed him a groom of the bedchamber in his household. Eventually, however, St Leger's expenses outran his income, and in 1785 he retired to Ireland to recoup his fortune. While there he is credited -- in company with Buck Whaley -- with the revival of the Dublin Hell Fire Club, notorious for its black masses and orgies. He also renewed the St Legers' connection with the Manners family and was a familiar face at the viceregal court of Charles, fourth duke of Rutland. Indeed so extravagant were the compliments paid by St Leger to the duke's beautiful wife, Mary Isabella -- on one occasion at a dinner party he drank the water with which she had just cleaned her teeth -- that the gossip was that they were having an affair. Certainly after the duke's death in 1787 they did become lovers (although she soon switched her attention to Frederick, duke of York, to the concern of the prince of Wales, who expressed anxiety as much for St Leger's sake as his brother's).

Honywood, Sir Philip (c.1677-1752), army officer, was the second son of Charles Ludovic Honywood of Charing, Kent, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of a Mr Clement of Portsmouth. The Honywoods were old but minor Kentish gentry who earlier in the century had acquired estates in Essex, at Markshall and elsewhere, which Honywood's elder brother Robert ('b'. in or before 1676, died 1735) was to inherit from a distant cousin in 1693. 
Honywood was commissioned as ensign into Colonel the Hon. James Stanley's regiment of foot on 12 June 1694, and in the following year saw active service with his regiment at the siege of Namur. In April 1696 he was promoted captain in the Royal Fusiliers, but at the conclusion of the Nine Years' War in 1697 was put on the half-pay list. With the reopening of hostilities with France in 1702 he was commissioned in March that year as captain in the earl of Huntingdon's newly raised regiment of foot (the 33rd foot) and in December 1703 was promoted brevet major. After initial service in Flanders Honywood and his regiment embarked as part of the earl of Galway's expedition to Portugal, and by 1705 he was lieutenant-colonel of his regiment, now under the command of Colonel Robert Duncanson. That spring, during Galway's attack on the frontier town of Valencia d'Alcantara, Honywood courageously led his corps through the breached walls of the town and acted briefly as temporary commander of the regiment when Duncanson was killed. He was none the less superseded in the colonelcy by Colonel (later Field Marshal) George Wade, adjutant-general on Galway's staff. Galway assuaged Honywood's disappointment by assuring him of the next vacant colonelcy, and in the meantime gave him a colonel's brevet. Honywood's conduct at the allied defeat at Almanza in April 1707 earned him appointment to a brigadier's brevet with the command of a battalion and the pay of a colonel, but Galway's promises of a full regimental command remained unfulfilled amid the competing claims of other field officers. 
In the spring of 1708 Honywood's mission to convey dispatches from Spain to London and brief the lord treasurer, Sidney Godolphin, first earl of Godolphin, on military progress in the Iberian peninsula provided him with ample opportunity to press his case at the highest level. John Churchill, first duke of Marlborough, commander-in-chief, did not see this as an immediate priority, but Honywood was finally given his own regiment, the 68th foot (lately Colonel Townshend's), on 27 May 1709. Honywood was subsequently transferred to the Flanders theatre, and under Marlborough's eye served in the arduous campaigns of 1709-10. He quickly impressed Marlborough as an officer 'who serves here with distinction' ('Letters and Dispatches', 5.135) and was promoted to brigadier in September 1710, though it is likely, too, that his strong whiggish opinions also made their mark with the duke. Before the end of the year, however, Honywood's political outspokenness had cost him his rank and regiment. When the newly installed tory ministers in London, led by Robert Harley, heard reports that Honywood and several other general officers in Flanders were, at their public dinners, 'drinking Destruction to the present ministry, and dressing up a hat on a stick, and calling it Harley' and then firing a pistol at the hat (Swift, 120), Honywood and two colleagues were immediately deprived of their regiments. This sharp reaction, widely publicized, was clearly intended as an example to other disaffected officers as the ministry sought to impose its will on the high command. Now without military employment, Honywood appears to have remained in the Low Countries as a private observer of the closing stages of the war, and during the summer of 1713, following the conclusion of peace, he was at Brussels in the company of Marlborough's son-in-law, John Montagu, second duke of Montagu. 
The accession of George I initiated Honywood's rapid restoration to favour, and in October 1714 the king appointed him, along with several other senior officers, to the court post of groom of the bedchamber with a salary of $500. His commission as brigadier-general was renewed in March 1715. As part of the government's plans to augment the army Honywood was directed during the summer to raise a new regiment of dragoons. The 207-strong regiment, known as Honywood's dragoons (later the 11th dragoons), of which he remained colonel for the next seventeen years, was recruited in Essex and based at Colchester. In November he commanded the regiment in the defeat of the Jacobite forces entrenched at Preston, in the course of which he was wounded in the shoulder. Four years later, in September 1719, he led a brigade in the capture of the town of Vigo by Richard Temple, first Viscount Cobham, and the destruction of its dockyard in the joint Anglo-French expedition against northern Spain. 
Thereafter Honywood was not to see enemy action again until 1743. Under a political regime committed to keeping the nation out of war, he settled into what was to be a long period of peacetime military routine, the main highlight of which was the annual round of military inspections and reviews. His solid professionalism kept him firmly within the favour of the first two Hanoverian monarchs, which, together with his enjoyment of many aristocratic and military contacts at court, ensured his continued steady rise within the army's senior ranks. He enjoyed particular benefit from his old association with William Cadogan (subsequently Earl Cadogan) during George I's reign, being regarded along with a number of other general officers as one of Cadogan's intimate 'cabinet'. In October 1721 he was placed as a brigadier-general on the Irish establishment. The following August, while on command at a training encampment at Hounslow Heath, he attended the state funeral of his old patron the duke of Marlborough. He was promoted major-general in March 1727. In June 1728 George II appointed him governor of the fort of Duncannon in co. Wexford, primarily to compensate him for the loss of his bedchamber post and salary at the king's accession. Further evidence of royal favour came in May 1732 when Honywood was appointed colonel of the King's regiment of dragoons (subsequently the 3rd hussars). In July 1735 he was appointed governor of Berwick upon Tweed and in December promoted lieutenant-general. 
Away from military duties Honywood, who never married, devoted much time to equine pursuits. He was a close friend of Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond (who had married Cadogan's eldest daughter, Sarah), and was a regular guest at Goodwood, belonging also to the Charlton hunt, of which Richmond was master. During the early 1730s he was appointed ranger of Old Windsor Walk and enjoyed the privilege of a 'hunting seat' in Windsor Forest. He was also a keen horse breeder, and in one of his recorded triumphs Slammerkin, owned by Lord Walpole, won the Prince's cup at Newmarket in 1735. 
By the end of the 1730s continental war with France and Spain had become a distinct possibility, as had the danger of invasion. In May 1740 Honywood was chosen governor of the fortress and garrison of Portsmouth, a key instrument in the coastal defence of southern Britain. During the summer months he was in command of an encampment of five cavalry and three foot regiments at Windsor Forest, one of a series formed across the south-east of England to prepare the army for war. With Britain's eventual entry into the Austrian War of Succession and commitment to lead a 'pragmatic army' of allies against France, Honywood was placed in command of the British cavalry and embarked for Flanders in August 1742, the entire force being under the command of John Dalrymple, second earl of Stair. There followed months of inaction, however, before in February 1743 the army began its long eastwards march into Germany. On 26 February Honywood was promoted full general of horse, and in April was made colonel of the King's regiment of horse in fulfilment of a long-held ambition. At the battle of Dettingen on 27 June he was the senior commander in the field after George II and Lord Stair. The cavalry regiments -- with one or two exceptions -- found it difficult to make any impact in the fighting largely due to their inadequate numbers and to the intensity of the French infantry attack, but there was also a distinct impression that their commanders had given neither a clear nor a strong lead. The lack of generalship was typified by one incident where Honywood's regiment, in turning away from the enemy to regroup, ploughed into the Royal Horse Guards and broke up their formation. The king was nevertheless grateful for his victory and created Honywood and three other generals knights of the Bath, investing them not far from the battlefield on 4 August. Honywood had in fact already solicited a 'red ribbon' from Henry Pelham, 'de facto' head of the administration, earlier in the year, citing his recently attained fiftieth year of military service. 
Upon Lord Stair's sudden resignation from command of the army a few weeks later, Honywood was appointed as his successor. He was seen as a poor replacement of a much esteemed general, and his known aversion to the guards' regiments won him few admirers among their officers. Although in March 1744 he was directed by the secretary of state, John Carteret, second Baron Carteret, to hold the British troops in Flanders in readiness for fresh action against the French, it was only a matter of weeks before he was replaced in overall command by Field Marshal Wade. His recall from Flanders later that summer marked the end of his participation in the war. 
Honywood returned to his duties at Portsmouth, where from 1746 until his death he was much preoccupied with the rebuilding of the garrison fortifications. His long experience as a cavalry commander was called upon in May 1749 when he was chosen to preside over a board of colonels appointed by the king's command to consider changes to the organization and drill of the dragoon regiments. His position near the very top of the military establishment inevitably gave rise to speculation in 1750 that he was to be made colonel of the Royal Horse Guards (on the death of his old friend the duke of Richmond) and promoted to field marshal in 1751, but neither honour was forthcoming. Honywood died on 17 June 1752 at the Governor's House, Portsmouth. 
Despite his seniority Honywood has not enjoyed the belated reputation of several of George II's other generals, such as Ligonier, Wade, or Bland, whose careers are linked to specific achievements, on the battlefield or otherwise. Honywood, by contrast, is a prime example of the many general officers who had forged their early careers under Marlborough, and were subsequently obliged to spend long years in senior command in peacetime conditions, doing little more than maintain the standing army as a defensive, policing, and fighting force, often under tight financial constraint. There was little room for generalship to thrive in such conditions, but it was under men of Honywood's plain stamp that the upkeep of the army was preserved in the early and mid-eighteenth century.

Pigott, Nathaniel (bap. 1661, d. 1737), barrister and counsellor at law, was baptized on 17 July 1661 at St Bride's, London, the elder son of Adam Pigott (died 1737?), merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth (probably 'nee' Griffin). His brother, Adam (1673-1751), was a Jesuit private chaplain in York. A Roman Catholic, he was probably educated abroad, at Douai or St Omer. He was admitted to the Inner Temple on 19 March 1683 and called to the bar, in the same year as such other Catholic lawyers as Edward Bedingfeld, on 4 July 1688. On 24 November 1689 he refused to take the required oaths of supremacy and allegiance and to receive the sacrament. Consequently his call was 'vacated' on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic: Pigott was the last Catholic called to the bar until 1791. In 1690 his suspension was removed without any reason being given, although he was still proscribed from pleading a case in court. About this time he married Rebecca Busby, with whom he had seven sons and three daughters, three sons becoming priests and a daughter becoming a nun. His London home was in Holborn Row, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and he had property at Bodingham in Essex. He bought his main residence in Whitton, Middlesex, from Sir John Webb in 1715, adhering to the requirement that Catholics should not reside permanently in London. The house faced Whitton House, the residence of Sir Godfrey Kneller. 
Pigott practised as a chamber counsel and conveyancer, acting as trustee for conveyances, furnishing legal opinions, and offering legal and business advice. 'In the conveyancing branch of the law his eminence was undisputed' (Kirk, 184). He had extensive libraries in the studies of both his houses, containing books in canon, common, and civil law, some inherited from colleagues, as well as an extensive collection of manuscripts. Conveyancing expertise was particularly important to the preservation of Roman Catholic estates, which were vulnerable to claims from potential protestant heirs and from threatened sequestrations by the crown. His clerk was Charles Boucher, subsequently one of his executors. 
Following the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1715 Pigott defended James Radcliffe, third earl of Derwentwater, William Gordon, sixth Viscount Kenmure, and other leaders of the rebellion, alongside Derwentwater's lawyer, Henry Eyre ('c'.1667-1719). Having in 1706 advocated giving 'assurance both in conscience and law for our obedience to the government' in return for protection (Pigott to Sir Robert Throckmorton, 9 May 1706, Warwickshire RO, Throckmorton papers, CR 1998, box 65), Pigott joined Eyre in persuading Derwentwater and Kenmure to follow what both lawyers saw as the only practical course, of pleading guilty to high treason. Kenmure later lamented that their lawyers had not mounted a more spirited defence. Pigott himself was fined $50 in 1715 for refusing to take the oath of allegiance. 
Pigott acted for Alexander Pope during the long dispute between Pope and the widow of Sir Godfrey Kneller over the siting of the memorial to Kneller in Twickenham church, a dispute resolved in 1725. Pigott nursed Pope back to health following Pope's coach crash into the River Crane outside Whitton House in September 1726. Pope acknowledged both services a year later: '
The Muse this one Verse to learn'd Pigot addresses, 

In whose Heart, like his Writings, was never found flaw; 

Whom Pope prov'd his Friend in his two chief distresses, 

Once in danger of Death, once in danger of Law. 
('The poems of Alexander Pope', 476)' Pigott's clients included many in the tight circle of prominent Catholic families, including among many others William Fairfax, eighth Viscount Fairfax, of Gilling in Yorkshire (whose daughter Alethea married Pigott's second son, Ralph), the Petres of Ingatestone in Essex, the Arundells of Lanherne in Cornwall, and the Throckmortons of Coughton, Warwickshire, as well as Edward Caryll of Harting, Sussex, who married Pigott's eldest daughter, Katherine. Pigott also had several prominent protestant clients, including James Brydges, duke of Chandos, the earl of Derby, the Websters of Copthall in Essex, the Dashwoods of West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, all of whom were Anglicans, and the Darby family of Coalbrookdale, Shropshire, who were Quakers. He was also councillor ('consiliarius') and advocate to the English Benedictine congregation for over thirty years from about 1687. 
After a short illness, in which he was nursed by his sister-in-law Hannah Busby, he died at his home in Whitton, Middlesex, on 5 July 1737, and was buried in St Mary's Church, Twickenham; his memorial tablet by Peter Scheemakers has his old friend Alexander Pope's tribute to one who 'gave more honour to his profession, than he derived from it. Possessed of the highest character, by his learning, judgment, experience, integrity, depriv'd of the highest stations, only by his conscience and religion'. His wife, who had lost her memory, survived him. 
In his will Pigott left his 'four old Common Place Books', his most vital working resource, to his neighbour John Ward of the Temple. From his three manuscripts of 'analasise of the common and civil law' two legal works were published posthumously in 1739, 'A Treatise of Common Recoveries, their Nature and Use' and 'New Precedents in Conveyancing', a composite of precedents from various lawyers in which Pigott himself is the most prominent source. Pigott's texts remained standard authorities for the remainder of the eighteenth century. Of his family, his son Edward administered the last rites to Alexander Pope in 1744, and Ralph was the father of the astronomer Nathaniel Pigott.

Anderson, Sir (William) Ferguson (1914-2001), geriatrician, was born on 8 April 1914 at 11 Lochside Street, Glasgow, the son of James Kirkwood Anderson, master plumber, and his wife, Sarah Barr, 'nee' Kerr. His father, a captain in the 7th Scottish Rifles, was killed on active service in Gaza in 1917. Educated at Merchiston Castle School and Glasgow Academy, Anderson studied medicine at the University of Glasgow, graduated MB ChB in 1936, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 1939. He spent three years as medical registrar in Noah Morris's department at Stobhill Hospital, where his interest was aroused in the nascent speciality of geriatrics. Morris, professor of materia medica and therapeutics at Glasgow University, instituted his clinical practice in Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow, a municipal hospital with a high proportion of elderly patients, many with chronic illnesses and so unacceptable in the voluntary teaching hospitals. Morris and his successor, Stanley Alstead, encouraged their medical staff to study ageing and old age in their practice and research. 
On 25 September 1940, at Pollokshields East Church, Glasgow, Anderson married Margaret Battison Gebbie, the twenty-year-old daughter of Thomas Gebbie, public works contractor of Whitecraigs, Renfrewshire. They had a son and two daughters. From 1941 Anderson spent five years in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in India and Germany. He graduated MD and won the University of Glasgow's Bellahouston gold medal in 1942. He returned to Glasgow in 1946 as senior lecturer in materia medica at the university and physician to Stobhill Hospital. In 1949 he moved to Cardiff as senior university lecturer and honorary consultant physician but three years later he returned to Glasgow as physician in geriatric medicine at Stobhill Hospital and Foresthall Hospital (part of the former Glasgow workhouse). He had the additional title of adviser in diseases of old age and chronic sickness to the western regional hospital board in Scotland and so could influence the development of geriatrics in the whole of Glasgow and western Scotland. 
Geriatrics had emerged as a special branch of medicine when the recognition of medical neglect of old people in workhouse infirmaries and hospital chronic sick wards was demonstrated by Marjory Warren from her work at the West Middlesex County Hospital and its associated workhouse infirmary in the late 1930s. The speciality received official recognition with the establishment of the National Health Service in 1948, and appointments as consultant physicians in geriatric medicine followed. As with many new specialities in the history of medicine, geriatrics encountered a good deal of scepticism, not to say hostility, from colleagues, particularly those who had some responsibility for care of these neglected elders. This occurred at Stobhill Hospital as elsewhere -- indeed the proposed establishment of two geriatric wards was initially opposed by the medical staff committee who feared it would 'adversely reflect on [Stobhill's] status as a teaching hospital' (Brocklehurst, 'Unsung heroes'). Anderson was the ideal person to overcome this prejudice with his calm and persuasive personality, his authority within medicine, and the support of the western regional hospital board of Scotland. 
Anderson realized that teaching and research and therefore involvement in the university medical schools was required if geriatrics was to flourish as a speciality. He led by example, promoting the establishment of the Cargill chair of geriatric medicine in Glasgow University, the first in the country (and probably in the world). He occupied this chair with distinction from its establishment in 1965 until his retirement in 1979. He pioneered social and preventative medicine for older people at his drop-in centre in Rutherglen in association with Nairn Cowan, and as president of Crossroads (Scotland) Care Attendants Schemes, chairman of St Mungo's Old Folks' Club in Glasgow, vice-president of the Scottish Retirement Council, Age Concern Scotland, and the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation, and patron of the Abbeyfield Society for Scotland. For these local contributions the city of Glasgow awarded him the St Mungo prize in 1968. He was appointed OBE in 1961 and KBE in 1974. A fellow of the royal colleges of physicians of Edinburgh (1961), London (1964), Ireland (1975), and Canada (1976) as well as of Glasgow, his medical career was crowned with the presidencies of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow (1974-6), of the British Geriatrics Society (1975-8), and of the British Medical Association (1977-8). 
Anderson's zeal in forwarding the speciality was worldwide, and he became an ambassador for geriatrics. He was an adviser to the World Health Organization on the organization of medical care (1973-83), an honorary fellow of the American College of Physicians (1980) and of the Australian College of Medical Scientists (1971), and Fogerty international scholar at the National Institute on Aging, USA (1979); he received the Brookdale award of the Gerontological Society of America (1984). He undertook visiting professorships around the globe. In 1974 he was appointed a knight of St John. 
Anderson's publications included 'Current Achievements in Geriatrics' (1964), edited jointly with Bernard Isaacs, and 'Practical Management of the Elderly' (1967), which ran to five editions by 1989 (the last two written jointly with Brian Williams). Known to friends and colleagues as Fergie, Anderson was a man of great charm and unusual humility combined with a gift of promoting a 'feel good' quality in others. He enjoyed foreign travel but spent most of his life in Glasgow, retiring to a house on the fringe of the Campsie Fells. He died on 28 June 2001 and was survived by his wife, Margaret, their son, James, and their two daughters, Mairi and Kathleen.
