Pennefather, William (1816-1873), Church of England clergyman, the youngest of the eight children of Richard Pennefather (1772-1859), baron of the Irish court of exchequer, and his wife, Jane, 'nee' Bennett, was born in Merrion Square, Dublin, on 5 February 1816; one of his elder brothers was Richard Pennefather. He was educated first at a preparatory school in Dublin; then at Westbury College, near Bristol, where he was known as 'the saintly boy'; and finally, from 1832, he was privately tutored by the Revd William Stephens at Levens, near Kendal, Westmorland. He went to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1834, but suffered from consumption and did not graduate BA until 1840; he was drawn into the life of the evangelical community in the city. Ordained deacon in 1841 and priest in the following year, Pennefather was licensed to the curacy of Ballymacugh, co. Cavan, and then became incumbent of Mellifont, near Drogheda, in 1844. A keen supporter of Irish Church Missions, he was active during 1846 and 1847 in famine relief activities. On 16 September 1847 he married Catherine King ['see below'], eldest daughter of Rear-Admiral the Hon. James William King, youngest son of the second earl of Kingston, and his wife, Caroline Cleaver. 
In 1848 Pennefather became perpetual curate of Holy Trinity, Walton, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, a recently created parochial district in the town. His successful ministry there led to his transfer, in 1852, to the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Barnet, Hertfordshire. A few years later an extra aisle and gallery were added to his church. Pennefather and his wife, themselves childless, began the care of orphans in 1855. Annually from 1856 (except in 1857), he also organized a conference of Christian workers, concentrating on the themes of home and foreign missions, holiness, and the premillennial second advent. In 1860 he began the training of women workers as overseas missionaries, many of whom were to serve with the Church Missionary Society and Church of England Zenana Missionary Society. 
In 1864 Pennefather left Barnet for the incumbency of St Jude's, Mildmay Park, Islington, in north London. His annual gathering, for which a purpose-built hall seating 3000 people was opened in 1870, became the Mildmay Conference. The training home evolved into an institution for deaconesses, primarily preparing women for work as uniformed domestic missionaries or, from 1866, as nurses. The strain of co-ordinating this growing evangelical empire led to a complete breakdown of Pennefather's health, which had always been delicate, early in 1873, and he died from apoplexy on 30 April 1873 at his home, Melford Lodge, Muswell Hill, Middlesex. He was buried at Ridge, near Barnet. 
Dignified in bearing and courteous in manner, Pennefather impressed contemporaries by the depth of his devotional life and the warmth of his human sympathy. In his love of poetry he nurtured some skill as a hymn writer. Several of his compositions were published, though the only one which remained widely sung was 'Jesus, stand among us'. Pennefather's insistence that converted Christians of all denominations should co-operate is eloquently expressed in 'The Church of the First-Born' (1865). He invited the American evangelist Dwight L. Moody to Britain, but died before the opening of his preaching tour. Pennefather's stress on holiness, like his inauguration of the Mildmay Conference, prepared the way for the Keswick Convention, which first took place two years after his death.

Pennethorne, Sir James (1801-1871), architect, was born on 4 June 1801 in Worcester, the third of the seven children of Thomas Pennethorne (1762-1843), hop merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Salt (died 1849), who ran a school. The architect John Pennethorne was his younger brother. He grew up in Worcester, and was educated in Dr Simpson's academy there, but in 1820 he took the place of his elder brother Thomas (1798-1819) as a clerk in the London office of the architect John Nash, whose second wife was his second cousin; the legend that he was an illegitimate son of the prince of Wales (later King George IV) by Mrs Nash cannot be substantiated. 
Nash's influence was crucial in shaping Pennethorne's career. It was Nash who arranged for him to be taught drawing by Augustus Charles Pugin in 1821-3, and he was involved in the preparation of the second volume of Pugin's 'Specimens of Gothic Architecture' (1823). He also attended the Royal Academy Schools, and it was in Nash's magnificent new house at 14 Regent Street that he prepared his first architectural design, for a neo-classical monument to the battles of Waterloo and Trafalgar, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1824 but never constructed. In October 1824 Pennethorne embarked on two years of foreign travel and study, financed by Nash and clearly intended to establish him as his successor. Most of the time was spent in Rome, where he carried out an intensive study of classical and Renaissance buildings, culminating in the preparation of two accomplished but fanciful perspective drawings of the restoration of the Roman forum, the second of which led in April 1826 to his election as a member of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. He visited and illustrated the Greek temples of southern Italy and Sicily in the summer of 1826, and he also spent some time in Paris in the office of Augustus Pugin's brother-in-law Louis Lafitte before returning to Britain at the end of that year. 
Pennethorne corresponded regularly with Nash while abroad, and on his return he resumed his position in the older architect's office, becoming his chief assistant in 1828. In this capacity he supervised the last of the metropolitan improvements designed, under an act of parliament of 1826, to link the newly created Regent Street to Trafalgar Square and the Strand: notably Carlton House Terrace, the development of a block of crown property at the western end of the Strand, and the remodelling of St James's Park on picturesque lines. He was involved in the construction, and perhaps also to some extent in the internal design, of Nash's new state rooms at Buckingham Palace, and in 1830, when Nash retired to the Isle of Wight, he took charge of his London office. Here the quantity of work fell off drastically after the death of George IV and Nash's dismissal from his official appointments by the new whig government, and when Pennethorne took over full control in March 1834, a year before Nash's death, little remained beyond repairs and minor building work on the crown estate in London. One of the works in hand was the completion of Park Village West, one of Nash's speculations to the north-east of Regent's Park, and here Pennethorne supervised the building -- and may have been involved in the design -- of some of the houses. On 8 April 1834 he married Frances (died 'c'.1865), daughter of Deane John Parker, a Canterbury banker whose elder brother Henry, a tax official -- the original 'Nosey Parker', according to family legend -- had married Nash's sister-in-law Grace Bradley; the first of their eight children, Deane Parker Pennethorne, was born in 1835. Pennethorne moved out of 14 Regent Street when it was sold by Nash in 1834, and established his office first in Duke Street and then in Bury Street, St James's, before moving to Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, where he was living in 1839. 
Pennethorne's independent career got off to a very slow start. His first building, delegated to him by Nash, was Crockford's Bazaar at 10 St James's Street (1831-2; subsequently remodelled), and during the rest of the 1830s he designed only a handful of country houses -- notably Swithland Hall, Leicestershire (1834), and the rebuilding of Dillington House, Somerset ('c'.1837) -- and two London churches: Christ Church, Albany Street (1836-7), an austere neo-classical building of some distinction, and Holy Trinity, Gray's Inn Road (1827-8; dem.). But he failed to win any of the competitions he entered, and, despite being recommended by Nash to the commissioners of woods and forests in 1834, he gained no official work until 1839, when he was appointed architect and surveyor to the commissioners for a new phase of metropolitan improvements designed to drive new streets through slum areas in or near the heart of London; the appointment was held jointly with Thomas Chawner, who retired in 1845. The most important of the new streets were New Oxford Street, cutting through the centre of the notorious St Giles Rookery, and Commercial Street, designed to divert traffic to and from the London docks away from the City and through the slums of Whitechapel. Though conceived in a spacious manner which owed much to Nash, they and the two other new streets (Cranbourn Street and Endell Street) were drastically reduced in scale in 1840 as a result of political pressure and financial difficulties, and, as carried out in 1843-7, they made less of an impact on London than Pennethorne, who was solely responsible for their design, had intended. Meanwhile in 1841 he and Chawner were entrusted by the commissioners with the design of Victoria Park, the first park in the East End of London and the first park in any English city to be laid out with public funds for the benefit of the working classes. Here too there were savage cuts in funding before the park was completed in 1847, to Pennethorne's revised but still effective designs of 1845. A similar process occurred at Battersea Park, on the south bank of the River Thames, first designed by Pennethorne in 1845, but revised and reduced in scale in 1853-4 and not completed until 1863. Pennethorne's plans of 1851 for a third park, to be named Albert Park, in north London, never left the drawing board, and in 1855 responsibility for both new streets and parks passed from the government to the newly constituted Metropolitan Board of Works. 
For most of the 1840s Pennethorne's professional life was taken up with metropolitan improvements and the surveyorship of the crown estate in London, to which he was jointly appointed with Chawner in 1840. He took over as sole surveyor of the estate in 1845 and went on to redesign the Quadrant in Regent Street following the removal of Nash's arcade in 1848 and to lay out the street now called Buckingham Gate to the south of Buckingham Palace in 1853-8; he also supervised the realignment of the approaches to Windsor Castle in 1846-52. His official appointments brought him an office at 7 Whitehall Yard and a steady income which enabled him to settle in some comfort with his growing family at Elms Court, Highgate Hill, and when Chawner retired at the end of 1845 he gave up what remained of his private practice to work full-time for the government. He now began to be employed by successive first commissioners of woods and forests (from 1851 first commissioners of works) to design public and government buildings for which a competition was not deemed necessary, starting in 1846-51 with the Museum of Practical Geology in Piccadilly, a handsome structure (since demolished) with facades in the Italian Renaissance manner and an ambitious iron and glass roof lighting the main display area. The massive and austere Public Record Office in Chancery Lane followed in 1851-70, its Gothic exterior hiding a rigorously utilitarian fireproof interior (the west wing was built to the designs of Sir John Taylor in 1891-6), and in 1852-6 Pennethorne designed a new west wing at Somerset House for the Inland Revenue, externally echoing the main building by Sir William Chambers. He also added a new south range, including a lavishly decorated ballroom and supper room, to Buckingham Palace in 1852-6, and in 1854-7 new offices for the duchy of Cornwall were built to his designs at the eastern end of the newly opened Buckingham Gate, facing the palace. 
Pennethorne's later career is littered with the debris of abandoned projects for public buildings in London. In 1853 he was entrusted by the then first commissioner of works, Sir William Molesworth, with the design of a new block of government offices, including a new Foreign Office, on the western side of Whitehall, but in 1855 Molesworth was replaced by Sir Benjamin Hall, who abandoned Pennethorne's plans and announced a competition which eventually led, after many vicissitudes -- including the temporary reinstatement of Pennethorne in 1857 -- to the erection of the present Foreign Office to the designs of Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1862-73. Designs for a new War Office in Pall Mall, conceived in 1856, also fell victim to Hall, and a succession of projects for enlarging the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, the first of them dating from 1850, resulted only in the construction in 1860-61 of a new picture gallery which was demolished when the present main staircase was built to Sir John Taylor's designs in 1885. Elaborate designs for the layout of the South Kensington estate owned by the commissioners of the Great Exhibition also remained stillborn, and Pennethorne's only tangible contribution to the development of this district was the erection in 1856 of a temporary and short-lived lecture-room for the South Kensington Museum. 
Pennethorne's ill-defined and ambiguous role as government architect was undermined by a series of reforms to the office of works carried out by Sir Benjamin Hall in 1856, and his official career was only rescued after he appealed directly to the Treasury, to which the office was subordinate. But, despite being viciously attacked in Beresford Hope's 'Saturday Review', he was awarded a special gold medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1857 (for the completion of Somerset House), and when Hall stepped down as first commissioner of works after the fall of Palmerston's government in 1858 he recovered something of his former status in the office. Hall's successor, Lord John Manners, employed him to design the staff college at Camberley, Surrey (1859-61), in a plain classical style, and, as a result of a Treasury inquiry in the same year, he was given an annual salary of $1500 for 'general services', in addition to his existing salary of $850 as surveyor to the crown estate and the normal percentage fees for any new buildings he might be asked to design. His last major commissions were the completion of the Public Record Office, the internal remodelling of Marlborough House and the building of a new stable block there for the prince of Wales (1860-63), and, most important, the Senate House for the University of London (1867-70), an impressive and richly decorated classical building erected on ground to the north of Burlington House, acquired by the government on his recommendation in 1854 and for which he made several abortive proposals. 
Pennethorne's post as 'salaried architect and surveyor' to the government was abolished following a further reorganization of the office of works by Gladstone's first commissioner of works, A. H. Layard, and he retired on 30 June 1870. He was given a royal gold medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1865 and a knighthood in November 1870. His former assistant Arthur Cates, who succeeded him as surveyor to the crown estate in London, called him '[a] man of retired and studious habits, engrossed in the duties of his office, and mixing but little with society' (Cates, 60). His careful and refined style of classical architecture was not to the taste of the younger generation in the 1870s, and his immediate influence was slight: none of his pupils or assistants made a major impact on the late Victorian architectural world. His career was in some respects a frustrating one, plagued as it was by political interference and perhaps also by deep-seated failure to escape fully from the shadow of his mentor, John Nash. But Pennethorne's long-term legacy was greater than the relatively modest tally of his buildings might suggest. His former detractor, Beresford Hope, told the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1865 that he was responsible 'in no small degree [for] the revival of art-conscience on the part of our rulers' ('RIBA Transactions', 1864-5, 1). He was one of the most accomplished classical architects of his age and, as a designer of new streets and parks, he played a crucial part in the shaping of mid-Victorian London. 
Pennethorne moved to Worcester Park House, Long Ditton, Malden, Surrey, in 1865, and it was here that he died, from a heart condition, on 1 September 1871. He was buried in Highgate cemetery.

Pennethorne, John (1808-1888), architect, was the youngest of the seven children of Thomas Pennethorne (1762-1843), a hop merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Salt (died 1849), a schoolmistress. He was born at Worcester on 4 January 1808 and in the late 1820s followed his older brother Sir James Pennethorne into the office of John Nash in London. In 1830 he began a five-year tour of professional study in Europe and Egypt, visiting Paris, Milan, Florence, Venice, Rome, Sicily, Athens, and Thebes, which determined his subsequent career. On his first visit to Athens in 1832 he became interested in the geometrical 'refinements' of the temples of the Acropolis, notably the introduction of subtle curvature for the horizontal lines -- something alluded to by Vitruvius. While spending the winter of 1833 at Thebes he made careful studies of the mouldings and coloured decorations of the temples and tombs, and came to the conclusion that the colouring and ornamentation of Greek temples, as well as some aspects of their geometry, derived ultimately from Egypt. On returning to Athens in 1834, he renewed his study of the Parthenon, taking wax moulds of the mouldings and ornaments. He returned to England in 1835, but in 1837 he again visited Athens to make more complete observations and measurements of the curved lines of the steps, stylobate and entablature, and the inclination of the columns, of the Parthenon. He finally came to the conclusion that there was no foundation in fact for the conventional belief that the system of design in Greek architecture was absolutely rectilinear. The same conclusion had already been reached by Josef Hoffer, and Hoffer's research was published in C. F. L. Forster's 'Allgemeine Bauzeitung' in 1838 (3.249) quoting measurements of the Parthenon which had been made independently of Pennethorne's investigations by Edward Schaubert, an architect working for the Greek government. 
Ill health forced Pennethorne to return to England in 1837, and in 1844 he published, for private circulation, a pamphlet of sixty-four pages, 'The elements and mathematical principles of the Greek architects and artists, recovered by an analysis and study of the remaining works of architecture designed and erected in the age of Pericles', in which he drew upon passages in Plato, Aristotle, and Vitruvius, as well as his own discoveries, to set forth a theory of 'optical corrections'. His discoveries had already been noticed by W. M. Leake in his 'Topography of Athens' (1841), and in 1845-7 they were pursued by F. C. Penrose, who in 1851 published his 'Investigations of the Principles of Athenian Architecture'. The elaborate and exact measurements here given supplied Pennethorne with the mathematical data necessary to work out fully his theory of optical corrections. 
In 1851 Pennethorne settled with his unmarried sister Anne at Hamstead, John Nash's farm on the Isle of Wight, and for several years he devoted himself to agriculture. He resumed his studies in 1860, and in 1878 he published, at his own expense, an impressive folio volume, 'The geometry and optics of ancient architecture, illustrated by examples from Thebes, Athens, and Rome', with fifty-six plates by John Robinson, a pupil of his brother James. His findings were summarized in a paper on 'The connection between ancient art and the ancient geometry, as illustrated by works of the age of Pericles', published in the 'Transactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects' (1878-9). His argument was that the Greek architects, having first designed a building so that geometrically its proportions were harmonious, afterwards corrected those dimensions with reference to the visual angle under which it would be seen, and by these methods of work produced a building which optically displayed the same harmony of proportion as characterized the merely geometrical projection. These optical corrections, he believed, contributed greatly to the superiority of Greek architecture over Roman. His conviction that Greek temples were designed to be seen only from certain points of view was challenged in his lifetime and was not accepted by later scholars. But his careful research, embodied in his book of 1878, made an important contribution to the understanding of the architecture of ancient Greece and of the importance of mathematics in determining architectural proportion. 
Pennethorne died, unmarried, at Hamstead, Isle of Wight, on 20 January 1888.

Penney, William, Lord Kinloch (1801-1872), judge, son of William Penney, merchant, of Glasgow, and Elizabeth, daughter of David Johnston DD, of North Leith, was born at Glasgow on 8 August 1801 and educated at the university there. On completing his education he entered the office of Alexander Morrison, solicitor, and afterwards spent some time in an accountant's office. In 1824 he was called to the Scottish bar, and he soon gained a large practice, principally in commercial cases. He was twice married: first, on 3 July 1828, to Janet (died 1839), daughter of Charles Campbell of Argyll; and second, on 5 August 1842, to Louisa Jane, daughter of John Campbell of Kinloch, Perthshire. From the two marriages there were five sons and seven daughters. 
In politics Penney was a Conservative, and he was raised to the bench on the recommendation of Lord Derby in May 1858, taking the courtesy title Lord Kinloch. In October 1868 he was appointed to the inner house, or first division, of the Court of Session. An obituarist noted that though 'not without some faults of judicial demeanour, he... was remarkable not only for the elegance of his judgments, but for their generally just practical sense and wisdom.' Penney was also the author of a number of devotional works, some in verse, that enjoyed a measure of contemporary popularity. He died at Hartrigge House, near Jedburgh, on 31 October 1872, and was survived by his wife.

Pennie, John Fitzgerald (1782-1848), playwright and poet, was born on 25 March 1782 at the vicarage, East Lulworth, Dorset, the son of Robert Pennie and his wife Hannah, 'nee' Gould. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Pennie family had been socially important, but were ruined by their 'loyalty to the Stuart cause and the Roman Catholic religion' (Davies, 7). Pennie's parents were probably in service at the vicarage. He lacked a regular education, and, self-taught, at fifteen he wrote a tragedy, 'The Unhappy Shepherdess', based on a tale in Robert Greene's 'History of Dorastus and Fawnia'. An appreciative neighbour, Captain Hay Forbes, directed him to London, but the manager of Covent Garden Theatre advised him to go home and write another tragedy. 
After work as a solicitor's clerk in Bristol, and as an usher in a private school at Honiton, Pennie joined a travelling company of actors in the west of England. About 1810 he married Cordelia Elizabeth (1773/4-1848), orphan daughter of Jerome Whitfield, a London attorney, and presented a comedy in the theatre at Shaftesbury, with the mother and sister of Edmund Kean. The venture ruined him, and he suffered extreme poverty. In 1814 a company at Chepstow gave a benefit performance of his 'Gonzanga', published in October that year. Other theatrical engagements followed, but he quarrelled with all his managers. His tragedy 'Ethelwolf', published in 1821, was performed at Weymouth in 1826, and 'The Varangian, or, Masonic Honor' was played with success at Southampton, but neither 'Ethelred the Usurper', written in 1817, nor 'The Eve of St Bruce', written in 1832, was performed. 
Meanwhile Pennie had opened a school at Lulworth, and published in 1817 'The Royal Minstrel'. In the advertisement to this epic poem on the story of David, an impressive Miltonic pastiche, he describes himself as 'labouring under every possible disadvantage'. The school failed. In 1828 he moved to Kesworth Cottage, near Wareham, and began to write in the 'Dorset County Chronicle' and in the 'West of England Magazine'. Friends helped him to build a cottage at Stoborough, where he lived for the rest of his life. He named it Rogvald, after his second epic, published in 1823, an ambitious work with a west Mercian setting. 
Pennie's autobiography, 'The Tale of a Modern Genius', published in 1827 under the pseudonym Sylvaticus, reveals a bitter sense of ill-usage and neglect. His other published works included 'The Garland of Wild Roses', poems for children (1822). To provide for his son and grandchildren he contracted debts, from which he had just cleared himself when he died at Rogvald on 13 July 1848. His wife had died two days previously. They were buried at East Lulworth.

Pennington, Sir Isaac (bap. 1745, d. 1817), physician and chemist, was born at Longmore in Furness Fell, Lancashire, the son of Paul Pennington, the captain of a merchant ship, and baptized at Colton, Lancashire, on 17 December 1745. He attended Sedbergh grammar school, and then entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar, on 12 August 1762. He became a Lupton scholar on 4 November 1766. He went out as thirteenth wrangler in 1767, one of his examiners being Richard Watson, whom he succeeded as professor of chemistry. He was admitted as a fellow of St John's on 22 March 1768, and continued in this capacity until his death. He was admitted to the faculty fellowship in medicine on 18 October 1775, and thus retained his fellowship; he was president from 1787 to 1802. He graduated MA in 1770, and MD in 1777. He became the professor of chemistry in 1773, and in 1793 resigned, and was appointed regius professor of physic, a post he held until 1813. He was physician to Addenbrooke's Hospital from 1785 until 1817, and was knighted in 1796. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 29 March 1779, and delivered the Harveian oration in 1783; this remained unpublished. Pennington made no attempt to introduce long overdue reforms to the teaching of medicine in Cambridge, and is perhaps mostly remembered for being challenged to a duel by a colleague, Busick Harwood. It appears that on the pair meeting one morning Pennington said 'Good morning, Sir, B. U. Sick?', to which Harwood is said to have replied 'Sir? I, Sick? I was never better in my life' (Towers, 74). Pennington died at his house in Bridge Street, Cambridge, on 3 February 1817, and is commemorated by a tablet in the chapel of St John's. He never married, and in his will, read on 11 March 1817, he appointed the Revd James Wood (master), the Revd Laurence Palk Baker (fellow), and the Revd Charles Blick (fellow and bursar), as his executors. He bequeathed his property in St Sepulchre's parish, Cambridge, to the master -- this included his house in Bridge Street. He made a number of small legacies to servants and friends, but bequeathed the residue of his estate to the college; this included a small anatomical collection formed by the physician Thomas Lawrence. He also founded a number of exhibitions in the college, with a preference to candidates from Hawkshead and Colton near his birthplace in Lancashire.

Pennington, James (1777-1862), writer on currency and banking, born at Kendal, Westmorland, on 23 February 1777, was the son of William Pennington, a bookseller, and his wife, Agnes Wilson. Educated first at Kendal grammar school, he afterwards became a pupil of John Dalton (1766-1844) of Manchester. Subsequently Pennington worked in business in London. In 1811 he married Mary Anne, eldest daughter of John Harris of Clapham; they had four sons and three daughters. 
At the end of 1831 Pennington was appointed to investigate the accounts of the East India Company, but the appointment was cancelled when the administration changed. Thrown out of employment Pennington devoted himself to the study of currency and finance, and attracted the favourable notice of William Huskisson, David Ricardo, and Thomas Tooke. On Tooke's recommendation he joined the Political Economy Club in 1828; he also contributed appendices to Tooke's 'Letter to Lord Grenville' (1829), and to his 'History of Prices' (2, appx C). When, on the emancipation of slaves in 1833, it became necessary to regulate the currency of the West Indies, Pennington was employed for that purpose by the Treasury, and framed the measures which were adopted. In 1848 he published 'The Currency of the British Colonies', which was printed for official use, and which contains much detail of historical interest. 
As early as 1827 Pennington had urged, in a paper submitted to Huskisson, the desirability of some restriction on the issue of notes by the Bank of England. He had further explained his views in a pamphlet addressed to Kirkman Finlay (1840). During the preparation of the 'Bank Act' (1844) he was confidentially consulted by Sir Robert Peel. Though he accepted the principle of that legislation, he was not in entire agreement with Peel, and disapproved of the separation of the banking and issue departments of the Bank of England. From this time until his death he was frequently consulted by the government on currency and finance, on which he was regarded as a leading authority. He died on 23 March 1862 at his home in Clapham Common. His son Arthur Robert became canon of Lincoln and rector of Utterby, Louth.

Sir John Pennington (c.1394-1470), soldier, the son and heir of Sir Alan Pennington (died 1415) and his wife, Katherine, the daughter of Sir Richard Preston, fought as a young man at the battle of Agincourt in Lord Harrington's retinue. Later he was a commissioner of array and of the peace in Cumberland (1427-59) and a warrior in Scotland under his Percy kinsman, the second earl of Northumberland. In 1448 he was captured by the Scots at the battle of the Sark. He sided with the Lancastrians in the Wars of the Roses, allegedly sheltering the fugitive Henry VI at Muncaster, and received from that king the cup preserved there as 'the luck of Muncaster'. In 1412 he married Katherine, the daughter of Sir Thomas Tunstall; they had a son and two daughters. He died on 6 July 1470 and was buried at Muncaster. The baronetcy dated from 1676, with Sir William, who married the heir of Warter. The second baronet, Sir Joseph, married into the Lowther family of Lonsdale, as did his daughter. His elder son, Sir John, who defended Carlisle against the Jacobites in 1745, died unmarried, and was succeeded by his brother Joseph, the father of the subject.

Pennington, John, first Baron Muncaster (bap. 1741, d. 1813), army officer and politician, was born in Bath, Somerset, and was baptized in Bath Abbey on 22 May 1741; he was the eldest of the three sons and four daughters of Sir Joseph Pennington, fourth baronet (1718-1793), a landowner, of Muncaster Castle, Cumberland, and Warter Priory, Yorkshire, and his wife, Sarah (died 1783), the daughter and heir of John Moore, an apothecary of Bath. She was long separated from her husband and died at Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, in August 1783. The Penningtons originated in Furness and had settled in Cumberland by the mid-thirteenth century, though they acquired property in Westmorland and Yorkshire by marriage. 
John Pennington was educated at Winchester School (1754-6), then entered the army as ensign in the 3rd foot guards. His military diary for 1758 survives among family papers now in the National Library of Scotland. He became lieutenant and captain in 1762 and transferred to the 2nd regiment as major in 1765. In 1771 he travelled to Spain. In 1773, as lieutenant-colonel of the 73rd foot stationed at Fort George, he met Dr Samuel Johnson and worsted him in a discussion about the respective military merits of Arab warriors and trained troops. In 1775 he left the army when his father moved to Warter and made over Muncaster to him. Relations between the two deteriorated following a dispute over the rental, and the arrangement was cancelled for a year until Pennington married, on 26 September 1778, Penelope (1744-1806), the daughter and heir of James Compton of New York. Their son, Gamel (1780-1788), named after a twelfth-century ancestor, and one of their two daughters predeceased him; the other became countess of Crawford and Balcarres. 
Pennington had dabbled in politics before his marriage. He had intended to stand for Carlisle in 1774, and in 1780 he offered himself for Cumberland with government backing but declined a contest. His address suggested that his cousin Sir James Lowther had reneged on a promise of support for him. Instead he was returned for Milborne Port, on the Medlycott interest, on 4 December 1781. This cost him $3000, and was arranged by the prime minister, Lord North. When Rockingham succeeded North, Pennington was offered a place, which he declined, in exchange for giving up his seat. This was negotiated through the duke of Grafton, who had first offered Pennington his patronage in 1775 and threatened to resign office unless something was done for him. Grafton resigned, but, thanks to him, eight months later, on 21 October 1783, Pennington was created an Irish baron; an Irish peerage was thought appropriate as he expected to foreclose on a mortgage on an Irish estate, which was security for a loan, only partly repaid, made by the trustees of his marriage settlement. 
An early adherent of Pitt the younger, Muncaster would have preferred to sit for his county, but Lowther continued to keep him out. He considered himself the government's best friend in Cumberland, and in 1789 erected a pyramid at Muncaster Castle to mark the king's recovery from his illness. In the Commons he seconded a successful motion on 20 March 1789 to commemorate the revolution of 1688 and on 14 December 1790 praised the convention with Spain. No later speech is known, but he found a new cause in William Wilberforce's campaign to abolish the slave trade: they had met in the Lake District in 1784. His 'Historical Sketches of the Slave Trade and its Effects in Africa' (1792) proved a useful source book for abolitionists, and Wilberforce assured him that they were 'tuned in the same key' (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 1.68). Muncaster was a teller for abolition in divisions of 1791, 1794, and 1796. 
By 1796 Muncaster's constituency had succumbed to a rival interest and he turned to the government for a replacement seat. He was offered Colchester, which he could ill afford while engaged on a Gothic renovation of Muncaster, but he was returned, together with the well-to-do Robert Thornton, who headed the poll and was also linked with Wilberforce. His building activities, which included a choice octagonal library, soon prejudiced his parliamentary attendance, however, and he relied on Wilberforce and the press for political information. He raised 200 volunteer soldiers, or 'mountaineers', in 1798, and he backed Pitt's successor Addington, writing of his approval of peace preliminaries with France in November 1801. Realizing that his neglect would lose him Colchester in 1802, he offered himself at York, only to withdraw. In 1804 he revived his hopes of sitting for Cumberland at the next vacancy, but the Lowther interest withstood him. He lamented Pitt's death, which nevertheless led to his return to parliament for Westmorland, with Lowther's backing conditional on his support for the Grenville ministry. His wife died in an accident on 15 November 1806 while she was out canvassing on his behalf. In spite of his grief, Pennington travelled to Westminster to join Wilberforce in voting to abolish the slave trade in February 1807. 
Muncaster's parliamentary seat proved to be secure with Lowther's support, but his interest in politics had waned, and he had to be importuned to attend in support of government. In January 1811 he voted for the regency restrictions only after ascertaining that a rumour of the Lowthers' desertion to opposition was false. His last political gesture was to vote against Catholic relief in the first session of the 1812 parliament. He died at Muncaster Castle on 8 October 1813 and was buried at Muncaster on 15 October. His age at death is incorrectly given as seventy-six on his memorial, one of several to members of his family that he designed himself. Muncaster Castle was his glory: he planted thousands of trees and stocked the demesne with cattle and Yorkshire wold sheep. He was an agricultural improver who imported new ideas or tried his own, such as summer fallows for wheat, feeding potatoes to cattle, growing cabbages and carrots, and using tidal mud and mussels as fertilizers and sea sand to check moss. He arranged for his daughter to have a twenty-one-year lease of Muncaster after his death. 
Muncaster was succeeded in the barony by his surviving brother,

Lowther Pennington, second Baron Muncaster (1745-1818), army officer. Having been commissioned as an ensign in the Coldstream Guards in 1764, he was promoted lieutenant and captain in 1772, captain and lieutenant-colonel in 1778, colonel in 1783, major-general in 1793, lieutenant-general in 1799, and full general in 1808. His next brother had been killed in a duel, and he himself had killed a fellow officer in another duel at New York over the latter's humming of a tune in 1777. In 1793 he served in Flanders under the duke of York, who informed the king of his overzealous attack on a French battery, which cost his men heavily. The duke found that Pennington was unpopular with the Coldstreams, especially when he furiously insisted on the court-martialling of the regimental adjutant, who was acquitted. His personal bravery was not in question. The 131st foot, of which he was colonel in 1795, was called Pennington's regiment. He took half pay soon afterwards and became colonel of the 10th veteran battalion in 1806. He married, on 13 January 1802, Esther (died 1827), the daughter of Thomas Barry of Clapham, Surrey, and the widow of Captain James Morrison, an infantry officer. Their only son inherited the barony on Pennington's death in London, on 29 July 1818, at his house in Grosvenor Place. He was buried at St George's, Hanover Square.

Pennington, Montagu (1762-1849), writer and literary editor, was born on 21 December 1762 at Great Mongeham, Kent, the youngest of the four sons of Thomas Pennington DD (1728-1802), perpetual curate of Sutton-by-Dover and later rector of Tunstall, Kent, and Margaret, 'nee' Carter (1725-1798), the youngest child of Nicolas Carter DD (1688-1774) and sister of the classical scholar and author Elizabeth Carter (1717-1806). Montagu Pennington was educated at home by his aunt Elizabeth. His baptismal name was derived from her friend the well-known bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu, whose many kindnesses to him included taking him on a four-month visit to Paris in 1776. On 23 October 1777 he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, and graduated BA in 1781 and MA in 1784. 
Having taken holy orders Pennington was appointed in 1789 to the living of Sutton, near Dover. For nearly twenty years, beginning about 1788, he resided in Deal with his aunt in a house she later bequeathed to him. He was curate-in-charge of the adjoining parish of Walmer. Being fond of travel, he was visiting Lille in 1791 when, according to a letter from Elizabeth Carter to Elizabeth Montagu, the French Revolution drove him to the Netherlands ('Letters from Mrs. Elizabeth Carter', 3.331). 
Pennington became vicar of Westwell near Ashwell in Kent in December 1803, and of Northbourne and Sholden near Deal in 1806. Elizabeth Carter died in the same year, and Pennington was executor and residuary legatee of her estate. She left him all her papers, and he prepared for press the fourth edition of her translation of Epictetus (first published 1758), to which he added her last alterations and notes (2 vols., 1807). He also published the 'Memoirs of the life of Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, with a new edition of her poems..., to which are added, some miscellaneous essays in prose' (1807; 2nd edn, 2 vols., 1808). The 'Monthly Review' praised this work, noting that Pennington 'has executed his task with fidelity and general propriety' as well as 'unassuming modesty' ('Monthly Review', 240). He edited 'A series of letters between Elizabeth Carter and Catherine Talbot, 1741-1770, with letters from Elizabeth Carter to Mrs. Vesey' (2 vols., 1808; 4 vols., 1809); brought about the republication of the 'Works of Miss Catherine Talbot, 7th ed., first published by Elizabeth Carter and now republished' (1809; 8th edn, 1812; 9th edn, 1819); and edited 'Letters from Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, to Mrs. Montagu... between the years 1755 and 1800' (3 vols., 1817). In 1811 Pennington published 'Redemption, or, A View of the Rise and Progress of the Christian Religion'. In 1814 Pennington became perpetual curate of St George's Chapel, Deal, a preferment he held until his death. He was also magistrate for Kent and the Cinque Ports. He married Mary Watts (1763-1830), widow of Captain Watts RN. She died at Deal on 24 March 1830, aged sixty-seven, without any children by Pennington. 
In Kent, Pennington's friend and neighbour Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, editor, author, and genealogist, valued him as his only literary ally among the 'stupid clanships' of the Kentish squires. Brydges described Pennington as a good classical scholar, with a 'great memory' and admirable judgement, but 'a little fastidious' (Brydges, 'Autobiography', 1.46). Brydges acknowledged Pennington's 'continual and various aid' in his ten-volume 'Censura literaria' (10.v). Pennington was probably the author of a manuscript note in the British Museum's copy of 'Censura literaria', given to him by Brydges, which states that Pennington contributed all the articles in the section called 'The ruminator' signed '&Dagger;*&Dagger;', P. M., and Londinensis. Four of the essays signed P. M. are on the theological writings of Grotius. In a separate publication of 'The Ruminator' (1813) essays on Jeanne d'Arc (no. 77) and on faith and natural religion (no. 85) signed P. M. are probably also by Pennington. Certainly, Brydges again acknowledged Pennington's 'valuable contributions' in the preface. 
Montagu Pennington died on 15 April 1849 in Deal, where he was buried in the cemetery of St George's. Modern scholars will value him most as Elizabeth Carter's first biographer and editor, as well as for assisting women's publications, most notably those of his aunt and her correspondents.

Penny, Edward (1714-1791), portrait, historical, and genre painter, was born at Knutsford, Cheshire, on 1 August 1714, and was baptized on 15 August, one of the twin elder sons of Robert Penny (1687-1738), surgeon, and Clare (1683-1760), daughter of William Trafford of Swythamley, Staffordshire. Many in his family had pursued a career in the church or as a surgeon, as did his twin brother, Henry. Penny, however, pursued his interest in painting and was sent to London to study with Thomas Hudson, whose influence is clearly evident in his early portraits. He subsequently studied in Rome with the portrait painter Marco Benefiale. About 1748 he returned to England and began to execute portraits in all formats from oval to full-length, a practice he continued throughout his career. Penny married on 4 September 1755 at St Anne's, Soho, London, Elizabeth (1719-1790), daughter of John Simmons of Millbank, Westminster, and widow of Richard Fortnam of St George's, Hanover Square, London. 
Just as his contemporary Sir Joshua Reynolds imbued portraiture with the grand manner, Penny developed a highly original amalgam of history painting and genre, infusing historical events with the quotidian and genre scenes with the gravitas of more elevated subjects. The first works he exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1762 were a small whole length of a lady and a scene from Nicholas Rowe's 'Jane Shore'. Penny exhibited almost yearly at the Society of Artists until 1768, sending primarily subject paintings and history paintings. In 1764 he exhibited an innovative modern dress depiction of the death of Wolfe, signed and dated 1763 (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). Another version without the subsidiary figures is at Petworth House, Sussex. Subsequent to the success of Benjamin West's version, Penny's was engraved by Richard Houston in 1772. He also displayed a scene from Swift's description of a city shower (engraved Thomas Chambers, 1775; Museum of London), one of several works by Penny that were favourably recognized by Walpole. The next year he exhibited 'An Officer Relieving a Sick Soldier' (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) which Walpole noted as depicting Lord Granby. The theme of charity would become one of the most prominent in his work. Penny became the vice-president of the Society of Artists in 1765, a position he held until his resignation from the society in 1768. He then became one of the founders of the Royal Academy and was appointed the first professor of painting. 
At the first Royal Academy exhibition in 1769, Penny avoided the prohibition against quotation by exhibiting a painting with the following title: ''I saw a smith with his hammer thus,/The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,/With open mouth swallow a taylor's news.' Shakespeare, King John' (Tate collection, known as 'The Gossiping Blacksmith'). Ostensibly a genre painting, the picture contained marked political overtones. It was engraved in 1771 by Richard Houston as 'The English Politicians' and was quickly co-opted by the supporters of John Wilkes. A print based on Penny's painting was published in the 'Oxford Magazine' in 1771 with the significant addition of a print of John Wilkes hanging on the back wall of the forge. Penny exhibited almost every year from 1769 to 1782. The India Office commissioned 'Lord Clive explaining to the nabob the situation of the invalids in India; at the same time showing him a deed whereby he relinquishes Meer Jaffier's legacy, five lacke of rupees, to the honourable East India Company, for the support of the military fund' (Department of the Environment, Foreign and Commonwealth Office) which was sent to the Royal Academy in 1772. 
Throughout his career Penny executed a number of paired pictures. Two were sent to the Royal Academy in 1774, 'The Profligate Punished by Neglect and Contempt' and 'The Virtuous Comforted by Sympathy and Attention' (Yale U. CBA). His 1776 Royal Academy entry returned to the theme of Jane Shore. He exhibited 'Jane Shore led to do penance at St. Pauls: the insolent in office, and pretenders to purity, by insulting the wretched, betray their own baseness' (Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery). The flat bright colours of the painting and planar composition depart from Penny's usual style. Given the radical nature of the composition, it is not surprising that the painting remained in the possession of his family until the middle of the twentieth century. Penny's compositional experimentations are also evident in a pair of paintings exhibited in 1780, 'A Boy Taken out of the Water, Drowned' and ''The boy by proper means recovered': vide Dr. Franklin's sermon to the Humane Society, humanie nihil a me alienum -- Ter.', in which the principal action described in the title takes place in the background of the painting and the foreground depicts the reaction to the main events. The pair was engraved as 'Apparent Dissolution' and 'Returning Animation' by William Sedgwick in 1784 and by J. Corner and P. Audinet (in smaller versions). 
Penny resigned his professorship of painting owing to ill health on 31 December 1781. In the final year of his exhibition at the Royal Academy, 1782, among the pictures he submitted were 'Widow Costard's cow and goods distrained for taxes, are redeemed by the generosity of Johnny Pearmain'. Penny died at Chiswick, Middlesex, on 16 November 1791, and was buried with his wife, who had died on 30 April the preceding year, at Chessington, Surrey. Penny's lectures were bequeathed by his will to his nephew, the Ven. George Buckley Bower, archdeacon of Richmond. There is no record remaining of the lectures, although they were praised by his successor as professor of painting, James Barry.

Penny, John (d. 1520), abbot of Leicester and bishop of Carlisle, was probably born at Leicester, where his father, John Penny (died 1496), was a freeman of the borough 'c'.1452 and mayor in 1481-2; his mother's name was Isabella Penny. His education is uncertain: he is said to have gone to Lincoln College, Oxford, and also to have become LLD of Cambridge, but neither claim can be substantiated. He was admitted a freeman of Leicester in 1475/6 as 'John Pene, pardoner' (that is, licensed to sell papal indulgences). In 1477 he was an Augustinian canon at the abbey of St Mary, Leicester, in 1493 prior, and on 25 June 1496 was elected abbot. Leland notes that Penny added to the abbey buildings: a long stretch of brick precinct wall he built, bearing his initials in darker bricks, survives. He was allowed to hold the Austin priory of Bradley, Leicestershire, 'in commendam' from 14 September 1503. In 1505 he became bishop of Bangor, but because of the small revenues of that see retained his abbacy and priory until after he had been translated to the bishopric of Carlisle by a bull dated 22 September 1508. His register has not survived, and little can be said of his episcopate, but in 1513 Penny and the bishop of Durham pronounced the pope's censures against the Scots for their invasion of England. He was a man of active mind, and a letter which he wrote to Wolsey in 1519 from Melbourne in Derbyshire, a manor of the bishops of Carlisle, shows that he was ready to support the cardinal in his plans for ecclesiastical reform, but was prevented by illness from attending the council summoned by Wolsey to meet in London. Penny died at the abbey in Leicester in 1520 and was buried near his parents in St Margaret's Church, Leicester, where his well-preserved alabaster effigy (placed on a new tomb in 1846) may still be seen. He gave lands towards a free school in St Margaret's parish, but in 1552 it was found that they had been sold some years previously and the money embezzled by John Beaumont, master of the rolls and recorder of Leicester.

Penny, John (1803-1885), journalist, born at Sherborne, Dorset, on 16 February 1803, was the third son of Elias Penny, bookseller and publisher of Sherborne, and was educated at the King's School there. In 1828 he became proprietor and editor of the old 'Sherborne Journal'. In the columns of the paper he championed the cause of reform, and thus earned the gratitude of the whigs. In 1832 he published a pamphlet entitled 'Dorsetshire Emancipated from Tory Dominion', and was rewarded by Lord John Russell with the stamp-distributorship of Dorset. He then moved to Dorchester, but soon afterwards was promoted to a similar but more important post at Leeds. While there he wrote a drama, 'Stephen, King of England' (1851), which was produced at the Leeds Theatre and favourably received. In 1858 he gave up the 'Sherborne Journal', and subsequently retired from official life. For a while he enjoyed his superannuation at the house he had built for himself at Harrogate, but in the early 1870s he developed acute asthma, for the relief of which he had to travel between Bath (for the beneficial waters of its pump room), Bournemouth (for its warm weather and sea air), and, occasionally, a villa in Chetnole, Dorset, which provided him with opportunities for regular walks and physical exercise. Penny died at Bath on 7 February 1885, and was buried on 12 February at Exeter with his wife and only son, who had predeceased him. 
Penny's eldest brother, William Webb Penny (1799-1888), was proprietor and editor of the 'Sherborne Mercury', one of the oldest papers in the west of England, from 1829 until 1842. His youngest brother, Charles Penny (1809-1875), of Pembroke College, Oxford, was headmaster of Crewkerne grammar school from 1838 until 1875, and for many years rector of Chaffcombe, Somerset.

Penny, Nicholas (1790-1858), army officer in the East India Company, was born in November 1790, fourth son of Robert Penny of Weymouth, Dorset, the descendant of a family long settled there. He was appointed to the Bengal army in 1806. He was gazetted ensign in the Bengal native infantry on 16 August 1807, and lieutenant on 19 December 1812, and, successively, brevet captain (5 March 1822), regimental captain (13 May 1825), brevet major (19 January 1826), regimental major (2 February 1842), brevet lieutenant-colonel (23 November 1841), regimental lieutenant-colonel (29 July 1848), brevet colonel (7 June 1849), regimental colonel (15 September 1851), and major-general (28 November 1854). 
Penny served with distinction throughout the siege of Bharatpur, the First Anglo-Sikh War, and the Indian mutiny -- from 1825 to 1858 -- and was repeatedly on active service. In November 1825 he accompanied the commander-in-chief, Lord Amherst, on service to Agra. He was present as deputy assistant quartermaster-general with the 2nd division of infantry at the siege of Bharatpur in December 1825 and January 1826, was thanked in divisional orders by Major-General Nicholls, and shared in the Bharatpur prize-money. He was brigade major on the establishment from 2 October 1826 to 19 May 1828. He was appointed to Mathura and Agra frontier on 4 October 1826, deputy assistant adjutant-general on the establishment on 19 May 1828, and assistant adjutant-general of a division on 9 July 1832. He married at Dinapore on 26 May 1830 Louisa Margaret, third and youngest daughter of John Gerrard. 
Penny was granted the brevet rank of major for distinguished services in the field, and was appointed to command the Nusseree battalion (the first British Gurkha regiment) on 2 June 1841, and was reported as 'a most zealous officer'. He was appointed to command the 12th brigade of the 5th division of infantry of the army of the Sutlej on 1 January 1846, and on the breaking up of this brigade was appointed to command the 2nd infantry brigade (16 February 1846). He served at the battle of Aliwal, and was commended in dispatches. At the battle of Sobraon, in the First Anglo-Sikh War, Penny was slightly wounded; his services were commended in dispatches and he was made a CB on 27 June 1846. He was posted to the 69th Bengal native infantry, and ordered to Lahore on 27 September 1848. He was appointed to command of the 7th brigade of the 3rd infantry division of the army of the Punjab, with the rank of brigadier (13 October 1848). 
Penny had ceased to command the Nusseree battalion on promotion to lieutenant-colonel (7 October 1848). He was transferred from the 69th to the 70th Bengal native infantry on 12 January 1849, and was present at Chilianwala in command of the reserve, and also at Gujrat. He was mentioned in dispatches, and received the thanks of the governor-general, Lord Dalhousie. He was transferred to the 2nd European regiment on 31 March 1849, and was appointed aide-de-camp to the queen, and promoted brevet colonel for his services in the Punjab. 
In 1850 Penny was transferred from the 2nd European regiment to the 40th Bengal native infantry, was appointed second-class brigadier, and was posted to the district of Rohilkhand (14 July 1851). He was transferred to the command of the Jullundur field force on 2 February 1852, and on 28 August he was appointed to command the Sirhind division, and subsequently he was again transferred to the command of the Sind-Saugor district (22 November 1853), and to the Sialkot command (19 January 1854). In May 1855 he was appointed to the temporary divisional staff, and posted to the Cawnpore division, and on 30 June 1857 was appointed to the divisional staff of the army as major-general, and posted to the Meerut division. When the mutiny was at its height he was appointed to command the Delhi field force, in conjunction with that of the Meerut division, from 30 September 1857. This was after the capture of Delhi, as Sir Archdale Wilson kept command until the city was taken. Penny was killed by rebels at Budaun, while in command of the Meerut division, on 4 May 1858. He was buried at Meerut.

Penny, Thomas (c.1530-1589), botanist and entomologist, was born at Gressingham, near Lancaster, one of two known sons of John Penny, a smallholder in the hamlet of Eskrigge in that parish. After perhaps attending the local grammar school he went up to Queens' College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1546, but on being awarded a sizarship at the larger Trinity College he transferred there in 1550, graduating BA in the following year. Elected a fellow in 1553 he stayed on to study, becoming senior bursar of Trinity in 1564. 
Though not ordained until June 1561, Penny was already preaching, and on 2 March 1560 was collated to the prebend of Newington in St Paul's Cathedral. A strong supporter of the Reformation, his 1565 Spital sermon at Paul's Cross caused him to be censured by Archbishop Matthew Parker, as being ill-disposed towards the established church. With his clerical career in jeopardy, he imitated an earlier Cambridge divine and naturalist, William Turner, and went abroad to equip himself for medical practice instead. Already knowledgeable about butterflies and plants, he was warmly received in Zurich late in 1565 by Conrad Gesner, then engaged on his 'Historia plantarum'. Penny presented Gesner with some choice plant specimens, and probably received some insect drawings by Gesner in exchange. Gesner's death a few months later, however, ended their collaboration, and led Penny to move to Geneva and spend the next summer exploring botanically the neighbouring mountains. He went next to Montpellier, where his friendship with Matthias de l'Obel, then a student there, doubtless originated, visited Majorca, and then seems to have travelled up through France to spend a period at Heidelberg. There he probably became acquainted with the elder Joachim Camerarius and collected plants and insects with two English medical students who were fellow naturalists. After a final tour of Prussia and the Baltic coast he returned to England, apparently in 1569, and set up in London in what proved to be a practice of some renown. No friend of established authority, however, he twice defied the College of Physicians by practising without its licence, even incurring imprisonment, before it eventually bowed to his reputation and admitted him a fellow (by 1582). Surprisingly, he retained his prebend until 1577, when he was deprived of it for nonconformity. 
Anchored for the rest of his life in Leadenhall Street, Penny nevertheless travelled widely in England in pursuit of natural history, records credited to him in the works of de l'Obel, John Gerard, and others including several plants new to the British list. Though insects increasingly now became his dominant interest, he was still botanist enough to introduce Charles de l'Ecluse to several English rarities as late as 1581. 
In November 1587 the death of his wife, Margaret, the daughter of John Lucas, master of requests to Edward VI, seemingly hastened Penny's end. Asthmatic and suffering from symptoms diagnosed by his friend and colleague Thomas Moffet as due to abstinence from salt, he died in January 1589 in London and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew Undershaft, his home parish. A puritan to the last, he stipulated in his will, dated 4 June 1588, that there should be no ceremony whatever at his interment, mourning apparel, ringing, and singing being all expressly prohibited. Papers he purportedly left to Turner's son Peter cannot now be traced; those he had been amassing for a major work on insects Penny left to Moffet. A book man where Penny had been a field man, Moffet went to much trouble in putting these into order and added so much that he felt justified in presenting the manuscript of 1200 folios he had ready for publication in March 1589 as having four authors. The first-hand observations and more detailed descriptions (including of nineteen British butterflies) were, however, probably Penny's. No copy appears to have survived of a German imprint of 1598, apparently the basis of Edward Topsell's plagiarism in an English translation under the title 'A Historie of Foure-Footed Beasts' (1607), the earliest-known entomological work published in Britain. Moffet's Latin version, 'Insectorum sive minimorum animalium theatrum', repeatedly submerged by his many competing commitments, eventually appeared posthumously in 1634. 
The Balearic St John's Wort now known as 'Hypericum balearicum' was named 'Myrtocistus pennaei' by de l'Ecluse in honour of its discoverer.

Pennycuick, John (1789-1849), army officer, was born at Soilarzie, Perthshire, on 28 October 1789. He was appointed ensign in the Edinburgh militia on 17 February 1806, entered the army on 31 August 1807 as an ensign in the 78th (Highland) regiment, and became lieutenant on 15 January 1812. He served in the expedition to Java, and was wounded in the attack on the entrenched camp adjoining the fort of Meester-Cornelis on 26 August 1811. He married, at Lanesborough, co. Roscommon, on 21 March 1820, Sarah, daughter of James Farrell, vicar of Rathcline, and they had five sons and six daughters. 
Pennycuick was promoted captain on 14 June 1821, and on 13 January 1825 he exchanged into the 47th regiment, with which he took part in the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1825-6. He became major, unattached, on 25 April 1834, and on 8 May 1835 obtained a majority in the 17th foot. With this regiment he took part in the campaign of 1839 in Afghanistan, including the capture of Ghazni, and was afterwards employed in Baluchistan under General Willshire, to subdue the khan of Kalat. He led the storming party in the capture of Kalat on 13 November 1839, and was made CB, having already obtained a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy for Ghazni. He had been made a KH in 1837. 
Pennycuick became lieutenant-colonel on 12 June 1840, and in 1841 took and destroyed some Arab posts near Aden. In 1848 he exchanged from the 17th to the 24th regiment; at the end of that year he served in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, and commanded a brigade, which consisted of his own and two Indian regiments, in Thackwell's division (afterwards Sir Colin Campbell's). He was in the force under Thackwell which turned the Sikh position on the Chenab, by crossing at Wazirabad, and he was eager to attack at once; but others prevailed, and the Sikhs were allowed to retire. When Lord Gough decided to attack them near Chilianwala, on the afternoon of 13 January 1849, Pennycuick's brigade led the attack. They were told to advance without firing, as the 10th had done at Sobraon. The 24th carried the Sikh guns with a rush, but they had outstripped the two Indian regiments and found themselves exposed, with their own arms unloaded, to a heavy fire from the jungle round them. Pennycuick and Brooks, the other lieutenant-colonel of the 24th -- 'two officers not surpassed for sound judgment and military daring', as Gough wrote -- were killed, and the brigade was driven back. The 24th lost twenty-two officers and 497 men. Among the officers killed was a younger son of Pennycuick, Alexander, a boy of seventeen, the junior ensign of the regiment: 'Young Pennycuick, [who] had been on the sick list, was brought to the field in a dooly -- there he insisted on going with the Regt. into action -- he retired with it, after the repulse, and at the village, heard of his father's fate. Immediately he went to the front in search of the body, and it would appear was killed by its side, for the two were found lying dead together. (Brereton, 122)' The two were buried alongside one another on the evening after the battle. Pennycuick's second son was James Farrell Pennycuick.

Pennycuick, James Farrell (1829-1888), army officer, was born on 10 August 1829, second but eldest surviving son of Brigadier John Pennycuick (1789-1849) and his wife, Sarah, daughter of the Revd James Farrell. After the Royal Military Academy (1844-7), he entered the Royal Artillery as second lieutenant on 2 May 1847. He became first lieutenant on 30 June 1848, and second captain on 21 September 1854. He served in the Crimea, and took part in the battle of Inkerman, his being one of the two 9-pounder batteries with the 2nd division, which were the first to engage the much more powerful Russian artillery. He received the brevet rank of major, and the fifth class of the Mejidiye. During the Indian mutiny he was engaged in the second relief of the Lucknow residency, the battle of Cawnpore (6 December 1857), and the siege and capture of Lucknow. He served in the 1860 China expedition, including the capture of the Taku (Dagu) forts, and was made brevet lieutenant-colonel (15 February 1861) and CB. He became a regimental lieutenant-colonel on 10 July 1871, regimental colonel on 1 May 1880, and on 8 November 1880 major-general. On 1 July 1885 he became lieutenant-general, and on 4 January 1886 general. He had married a daughter of W. Rutledge of Victoria, Australia; they had sons and daughters. Pennycuick died at 50 Weymouth Street, Portland Place, London, on 6 July 1888, and was buried on 10 July at Bedford cemetery.

Pennyman, John (1628-1706), Quaker schismatic, was born on 14 August 1628, the fourth son of Sir James Pennyman (died 1655), of Ormesby, Yorkshire, and his second wife, Joan Smith (died 1657), of London. His half-brother, Sir James Pennyman (1609-1679), was knighted by Charles I at Durham in 1642 and was later created a baronet by Charles II in February 1664. At fifteen John Pennyman went into the king's service and was made an ensign in the foot regiment of which Sir James was colonel. Following two years' service and the royalist defeat, he and two of his brothers took refuge abroad 'till his father and eldest brother had made their composition, and sent for them to come over' (Pennyman, 'Life', 1696, 1). 
On 8 February 1647, aged eighteen, Pennyman was apprenticed to a Mr Fabian, a woollen draper and fervent royalist based in St Paul's Churchyard in London. In 1650 he experienced a 'conversion' while reading the epistles of St Paul and 'was fully convinced of the sad and woeful condition he was in by reason of his sins' so that 'he began to walk, not after the flesh, but after the spirit' (Pennyman, 'Life', 1696, 2-3). His parents greeted his new religious experiences with difficulty for they were 'very zealous for the king, and Church of England' (ibid., 5). In 1651 he heard the Fifth Monarchist Christopher Feake speak at Christ Church, Newgate Street, and joined the sect; he remained with them until Feake's committal to Windsor Castle about 1658. 
In 1654 Pennyman married Elizabeth Heron (died 1668); in his 'Life' he states that they had three children, and Quaker registers reveal that these included Anne ('b'. 1663), and Elizabeth who died in 1673 aged eight. At the time of his marriage Pennyman also notes that he had set up in business, and he evidently prospered as a woollen draper for he owned shops and houses at the west end of St Paul's. 
Pennyman joined the Friends about 1658, 'finding the Quakers to preach up the power, and decry all forms', beliefs which 'seemed to come nearest to his sentiments'. He was also attracted to 'the simplicity of their doctrine, and their patience and constancy in their sufferings' (Pennyman, 'Life', 1696, 9). After some time, however, he came to believe that 'a great part of the Quakers' had 'degenerated into mere form', having '[set] up G.[eorge] Fox instead of the spirit of Christ, to be their Lord and law-giver' (ibid., 10). In 1660 Pennyman and others such as John Osgood and William Gosnell left the main body of the Friends, and held their own meetings in woods near Hanger's Green, but 'they still frequented their civil meetings... and stood by them in their sufferings' (ibid.). Pennyman's long-standing association with Thomas and Ann Mudd ['see below'], and John Perrot, also Friends, may have stemmed from this time. 
In 1663 Pennyman is recorded as a woollen draper living in Paul's Yard, London. In his autobiography he also mentions a country house in Kentish Town, where he went each Saturday. During the plague Pennyman rejoiced that his family were left untouched; at the time he and his wife were in Yorkshire, but the rest of the family was in London. They also survived the great fire of London, the family and servants being sent to Mile End Green for their protection. Pennyman married again following his first wife's death from a fever on 24 February 1668, but he suffered further bereavement with the death of his second wife, Dinah (died 1669), at the home of her father, Nicholas Bond, in Pall Mall, St James's, on 23 August 1669; like his first wife she was buried at Chequer Alley. 
From about 1669 it appears that Pennyman began to have experiences more typical of the ecstatic behaviour found among some of the very early Quakers, and which consequently led eventually to his being disowned by the movement. In 1669 he recounted in his autobiography how he had gone to a meeting in White-Hart Court and, after standing up, had lost his breath and senses for a number of minutes, which seemed to provide him with spiritual refreshment. This same incident recurred at other meetings. In 1670 he related how he fasted for three days while confined to his bed and had a vision of the Lord. An incident with more serious repercussions occurred on 28 July 1670, when Pennyman began to find some Quaker books 'an oppression to him' (Pennyman, 'Life', 1696, 26) and asked two porters to carry a bag of Quaker books and two other bags to a Mr Bates in Cornhill; he then 'stopped on an impulse' at the exchange, where he asked for a candle and requested the porter to burn some of the books. This action caused a scandal in Quaker circles as rumour spread that he had burned the 'Bible', but in his autobiography he stresses that the books burnt were 'not the two bags where the 'Bible', Book of Martyrs, &c. were' (ibid., 27). He was committed to Bishopsgate prison and later to Newgate. Pennyman defended himself in a letter to his brother which was printed and given away at the exchange. Nevertheless, on 10 August 1670, leading Friends disowned Pennyman for the public sacrificing of the scriptures and other books, declaring that they believed him to have been 'instigated by the Devil' and 'in some measure broken and discomposed in his mind and understanding' ('Testimony'). Pennyman had this broadside reprinted in red with a black border and had it widely distributed. He was soon released from prison through the influence of his brother and nephew. 
Pennyman's third wife, 
On 10 October 1671 Mary went to live with Pennyman in Aldersgate Street. He recounted that he requested Alderman Ashurst for the use of Merchant Taylors' Hall because the Friends refused him the meeting hall at White-Hart Court, and there 'by special motion, with great solemnity', published his marriage (Pennyman, 'Life', 1696, 50). Great provision was made for the celebration with meat and drink 'to be all of one sort', twenty-seven venison pasties, a hogshead of claret, 'and sufficient for about 250 persons' (ibid.). The union provoked yet another furore in Quaker circles, with William Penn writing: 'We countenance no clandestine marriages, as we have reason to believe John Pennyman's was: for he came not... to be married, but to declare he had taken Mary Boreman to be his wife... but when, how, and before whom he did it, is known to few, if any. (Penn, 'Judas', 62)' Clearly the union was not recognized by the Friends as a Quaker marriage as it had not followed 'those plain, public and orderly proceedings towards God, relatives and Friends, as which are owned and practised by us' (ibid.). In another tract Penn referred to Pennyman as 'that exalted J. Penniman' and criticized the Pennymans' 'costly clothes' and 'prodigal feast' (Penn, 'Spirit', 13). Mary in particular attracted Penn's opprobrium: '[She] exchanged her cloth waist-coat for a silk farendine gown, her blue apron for one of fine holland, and her ordinary bodice for rich satin it self; to say little of her riding in fine coaches, and several other things (once accounted by her self righteous abominable things). (ibid., 13-14)' The marriage was also the subject of a scurrilous ballad by Matthew Stevenson, entitled 'The Quakers Wedding' (1671). Perhaps as a result of the mainstream Quaker reaction to the wedding, the Pennymans, along with William Mucklow and Ann and Thomas Mudd, for the first time openly rejected the Quaker leadership of George Fox. 
In winter 1672-3 the Pennymans left London feeling called to visit Hertfordshire and Essex, which they did on foot. In a letter of 22 November 1673 William Penn wrote to Mary Pennyman, accusing her husband of being 'a reviler of our Friends behinde their back & a Promoter of the Book Tyranny & Hypocrisie detected &c. by contributing to the Accusations therein mentioned' (Dunn and Dunn, 262). Penn also claimed that Mary had 'so puffd up the poor Man, that he is ever and anon ready to be cracked' and of having 'entered... & help'd to his being beguil'd, by swelling him beyond his place, as if he were some God on Earth' (ibid., 264). The book to which Penn referred, and which is thought to have been written by William Mucklow, was heavily critical of leading Friends and the central organization which was growing up in London. A number of Pennyman's letters to Mucklow, particularly in the early 1690s, were printed in his autobiography. In these Pennyman lamented the distance that had grown up between the two of them, which may have stemmed from a reluctance on Mucklow's part to continue his criticism of the Quaker leadership. 
Pennyman appears to have lived at various places in the capital during the 1670s, including Hammersmith about 1672-3 and Hackney from 1674. He records how he was labelled 'a disturber' for interruptions to various Quaker meetings, apparently frequently (Pennyman, 'Life', 1696, 148). In 1689, seven years since he had been to a meeting, he related how he felt moved to go to White-Hart Court; there, before anyone else spoke, he exhorted the meeting to cleanse their hearts -- for which he claimed he was violently pulled down by three or four Friends (ibid., 160). In 1692 Pennyman and his family went to live with his son-in-law John Barkstead at St Helen, Bishopsgate. After publishing his autobiography in 1696 as 'A Short Account of the Life of Mr. John Pennyman', he went to the country, 'supposing the time of my departure was then near', and stayed there for three months, during which time he examined the writings of Matthew Hale, extracts of which he had printed (Pennyman, 'Life', 1703, 188). It then appears that he lived in Hackney, about 1698, and in November and December 1700 visited all the Friends' public meetings, such as those at White-Hart Court, Devonshire House, the Bull, the Savoy, Westminster, Ratcliff, and others, where he was moved to warn Friends 'to hearken to truth and righteousness in your inward parts' for all hearing and preaching was 'in vain' (ibid., 203). 
Pennyman produced about thirty works, the majority aimed against the Friends, such as 'The Quakers Unmasked' (1682). One of the few works which was not, written with Humphrey Woolrich and Thomas Coveney and published as 'Some Grounds and Reasons Drawn from the Law of God' (1660), criticized the law of imprisonment for the refusal of hat honour. Pennyman also co-authored some works with his wife: for example, 'The Ark is Begun to be Opened' (1671) and 'John Pennyman's Instructions to his Children' (1674) in which he writes, 'beware of taking up your rest in any outward form of worship... for our eyes have seen the sad fruits and effects' (Pennyman, 'Instructions', 9-10). Mary also wrote 'Something Formerly Writ' (1676). In 1700-01 John Pennyman published 'Some of the Letters and Papers which were Written by Mrs. Mary Pennyman', one of which included a letter to their friends Ann and Thomas Mudd in which she defended herself and her husband against their Quaker critics: 'they say we are turned into the world, but our desires truly are to get more and more out of the spirit of this world' (Pennyman, 'Letters and Papers', 10). Appendices to Pennyman's own autobiography were also published such as 'An additional appendix to the book of Mr. Pennyman's life being a collection of some more of his writings' (1706). 
Mary Pennyman died on 14 January 1701 aged seventy, following several years of ill health. The following testimony by her husband reveals the closeness of their relationship: 'she was one of the best of wives, and certainly one of the suitablest, serviceablest, and comfortablest companions, for many years, especially in divine matters, to me' (Pennyman, 'Letters and Papers', sig. A2'r'). John Pennyman died on 2 July 1706 and was buried at Bunhill Fields seven days later. Like many of the Quaker separatists, his life serves to highlight the changes in Quakerism in its first decades and the tensions which arose between the spiritual freedom which the early Friends appeared to offer and the constraints imposed following the establishment of the local and central meeting structure.

Pennyman, Sir William, baronet (1606/7-1643), army officer and politician, was the eldest son of William Pennyman of St Albans, Hertfordshire (an illegitimate son of James Pennyman of Ormesby, Yorkshire), and of his wife, Anne (either 'nee' Tottle or 'nee' Aske). William Pennyman the elder was one of the six clerks in chancery, and on 28 June 1610 obtained a grant with George Evelyn of the office of comptroller and clerk of the hanaper. He died in 1628. William Pennyman the younger was educated at Westminster School, matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 31 October 1623, aged sixteen, and was admitted a student of the Inner Temple in the same year. He was created a baronet on 6 May 1628, and was married to Anne Atherton ('c'.1609-1644) by January 1634. Pennyman succeeded to large estates in Yorkshire, acted as sheriff of the county in 1635-6, and was recommended by Strafford, in April 1637, for the post of 'custos rotulorum' of the North Riding, on the ground of his integrity and good affection to the king's service 'which he hath given very good testimonies of in all the commissions he is employed on, as Deputy-Lieutenant, one of the Council of those parts, and as Justice of Oyer and Terminer and of the Peace'. He was an associate of Strafford in exploiting the Yorkshire alum mines in the 1630s. In December 1638 he purchased an office in the Star Chamber, worth $2000 per annum and became a bencher of Gray's Inn in 1639. During the two bishops' wars (1639, 1640) he commanded a regiment of the Yorkshire trained bands, and represented Richmond in the two parliaments called in 1640. 
Pennyman was one of the witnesses called at Strafford's trial to testify to the earl's conduct concerning the Yorkshire petition, to the illegal levy of money to support the Yorkshire trained bands (for which Pennyman had been questioned in the Commons in December 1640), to Strafford's boast that he would make the little finger of the king heavier than the loins of the law, and to the crucial charge of planning to deploy the Irish army in England. He showed great reluctance to depose to anything against Strafford, and ultimately cast his vote against the bill for Strafford's attainder with fifty-eight other members. 
Having lost office through parliament's abolition of Star Chamber, it was inaccurately reported in December 1641 that Pennyman would be appointed a treasurer of the navy. In April 1642 he accompanied Charles I in his bid to regain control of Hull and subsequently raised a troop of horse and a regiment of six hundred foot for the king, and joined him at Nottingham by 30 July 1642. He was disabled from sitting in the Commons on 11 August following. 
Pennyman fought at Edgehill, and in April 1643 was appointed governor of Oxford in succession to Sir Jacob Astley. He fell a victim to the epidemic which prevailed in Oxford in the summer of 1643, died there on 22 August, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral. His widow died on 13 July 1644, and was buried in the same grave as her husband; they left no children.

Penrose, Sir Charles Vinicombe (1759-1830), naval officer, was born in the parish of St Gluvias near Penryn on 20 June 1759, the youngest of seven children of John Penrose (1713-1776), vicar of St Gluvias and letter writer, and his wife, Elizabeth (1718-1782), daughter of the Revd John Vinicombe. In February 1772 he was admitted to the Royal Naval Academy, Portsmouth, and, after the full course of three years, he joined the frigate 'Levant' (Captain the Hon. George Murray), in which he served for four years in the Mediterranean. In August 1779 he was promoted lieutenant and in November he joined the frigate 'Cleopatra', again under Murray. The vessel served in the North Sea for the remainder of the war, Penrose, by then her first lieutenant, suffering severely from hypothermia during the winter of 1780-81. He participated in the action off the Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781, and afterwards wrote a critical account of Sir Hyde Parker's conduct. 
In January 1783 the 'Cleopatra' was paid off and for the next seven years Penrose was ashore. Nevertheless he rejected an offer by some of the burgesses of Penryn to use their political influence to secure him promotion provided he became a voter in the borough. On 2 January 1787 he married Elizabeth Trevenen (1749/50-1832); the couple had three daughters, and during their early married life lived at Breage, near Helston. Penrose's refusal to advance his career through politics meant that he was still a lieutenant in 1790 when, again under Murray, he served in the 'Defence' during the Spanish armament. In 1793 he joined the 'Duke', serving under Murray at the capture of Martinique in June, and later he followed his captain into the 'Glory' and then the 'Resolution'. In April 1794 Murray was promoted rear-admiral and given command of the North American station: Penrose too was promoted and followed his patron as commander of the 'Lynx'. Further advancement was quickly forthcoming when he was posted into the 'Cleopatra' in October; and he was briefly Murray's flag-captain in the 'Resolution' in 1795 before returning to the 'Cleopatra' the following year. Penrose returned home with Murray in June 1796 after the admiral had suffered a stroke. After extensive repairs the 'Cleopatra' then served in the channel, though ill health obliged Penrose to leave her in July 1797. From 1799 he once again served in the West Indies, successively in the 'Sans Pareil' and the 'Carnatic', before coming home with sunstroke in July 1802. 
Between 1804 and 1810 Penrose commanded the sea-fencibles in the Padstow district. He was then appointed commodore for port duties at Gibraltar; in that responsible position he played an important role in helping Spanish forces fighting the French and also in the defence of Tarifa. In January 1813 his health again forced him home but he was able to participate in a small commission revising the establishment of stores in Plymouth Dockyard. On 4 December he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral and placed in command of a small squadron operating off northern Spain and south-western France. This force distinguished itself in constructing a bridge across the Adour River in February 1814 and by clearing the Gironde of all French warships during March and April. 
Upon Penrose's return to Plymouth in the autumn he was made commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, this lasting until May 1815 when Lord Exmouth, the fleet's former commander, resumed his position. Penrose remained as his second until again becoming overall commander when Exmouth went home in May 1816. In August Penrose was furious to learn of the expedition against Algiers, about which the Admiralty had sent him no word and of which he heard only by chance. He was even angrier to discover that a junior admiral, a stranger to the station, had been made the expedition's second-in-command. Exmouth was able to soothe Penrose's understandably hurt feelings and to persuade him to handle the concluding negotiations with the dey of Algiers. After this he resumed his sole command in the Mediterranean until returning home in 1819. On 19 July 1821 he was advanced to the rank of vice-admiral, having been made a KCB on 3 January 1816 and a KGCMG on 27 April 1818; he saw no further service. 
Penrose retired to his home at Ethy, near Lostwithiel. Between 1804 and 1810 he had contributed to the 'Naval Chronicle' under the signatures A. F. Y. and E. F. G., and also to an account of Cornish agriculture published in 1811. He later wrote some pamphlets on naval matters and penned a memoir of his brother-in-law, Captain James Trevenen of the Russian navy, which was published by his nephew, the Revd John Penrose. Charles Penrose died at Ethy, probably of a stroke, on 1 January 1830, and was buried in the churchyard at St Winnow. He was survived by his wife, who died on 3 April 1832.

Penrose, Elizabeth (c.1779-1837), writer, was born at Goadby Marwood, Leicestershire, on 3 August 1780, the second daughter of Edmund Cartwright (1743-1823), rector of Goadby Marwood, and his wife, Alice (died 1785), the youngest daughter and coheir of Richard Whittaker of Doncaster. Her family were lively and intelligent: her father was a famous inventor of textile machinery, and her uncle, Major John Cartwright (1740-1824), was a prominent radical reformer. Her brother Edmund (1773-1833), who took orders, was the author of a 'Parochial Topography of the Rape of Bramber' (1830), and her youngest sister, Frances Dorothy Cartwright (1780-1863), wrote a biography of their uncle (1826), and her elder sister, Mary, wrote one of their father (1843). 
Alice Cartwright died on 12 September 1785, and on 5 June 1790 Edmund Cartwright married Susanna, daughter of the Revd John Kearney. His daughters lived almost entirely with paternal relatives after Cartwright's second marriage. The two eldest, Mary and Elizabeth, were sent to the Manor School in York; a former pupil, Eliza Fletcher, described the education offered at this boarding-school as 'artificial, flat and uninteresting', opining that 'nothing useful could be learned' ('Autobiography of Mrs Fletcher', 17). Probably Elizabeth Cartwright developed her historical interests independently: her uncle, in a letter of 1796, recorded that 'Eliza, though a merry girl, devours folios of history with much more appetite than her meals' ('Life and Correspondence', 1.411). Fair and slight, she became, according to Eliza Fletcher (162), 'a most delightful woman, with a lively, active, accomplished mind, and the most engaging sweetness and simplicity of manners'. 
Elizabeth Cartwright spent much time with two unmarried aunts at Markham, in Nottinghamshire, where she met John Penrose (1778-1859), a Cornish clergyman who was the elder brother of Mary Arnold, wife of the famous Rugby headmaster and historian. He became vicar of Bracebridge, Lincolnshire, in 1809, and married Elizabeth Cartwright on 6 May 1814. Their marriage, apparently a happy one, brought them three sons: John (1815-1888), who took holy orders and became an assistant master at Rugby; Charles Thomas (1816?-1868), who was later headmaster of Sherborne School; and Francis Cranmer Penrose (1817-1903), an architect and astronomer. The daughter of the last, Emily Penrose (1858-1942), became principal of Somerville College, Oxford. 
In 1823 Elizabeth Penrose's first book, 'A History of England from the First Invasion by the Romans to the End of the Reign of George III', appeared under the pseudonym of Mrs Markham. It was first published by Archibald Constable of Edinburgh in 1823, but, after his notorious bankruptcy of 1826, John Murray purchased the remaining stock. In the same year a revised and enlarged edition appeared, with illustrations drawn from the antiquarian works of Joseph Strutt -- a novel departure for an early nineteenth-century textbook. It was an immediate success and achieved 'a very large and regular circulation' (Smiles, 2.152). 
According to the introduction Mrs Markham resolved to write the book, after her eldest son experienced difficulty reading Hume's 'History of England', as a didactic substitute for the usual bedtime story. The narrative is a domesticized version of English history, presenting historical figures as exempla of good and bad conduct in private life; the virtues advocated are familial duty, personal integrity, and social benevolence. But the 'History' has wider implications: Elizabeth Penrose firmly supports the Anglican establishment and the social and political 'status quo'. Her knowledge of the late eighteenth-century 'philosophical' historians was reflected in her determination to produce 'something more than a mere chronicle of events', hoping to trace 'the successive changes which have taken place in manners, arts and civilization'. These matters were covered in the conversations at the end of each chapter, where the author employed the question-answer technique common to the nineteenth-century textbook writer. 
With her husband managing publication with John Murray and probably her other publishers, Elizabeth Penrose produced a succession of juvenile works, including 'A History of France' (1828), which was republished by Murray in a revised edition in 1857 and 1882. Books of questions to accompany it were published in 1853, 1854, and 1860. Histories of Greece and Rome were announced, but never published. Elizabeth Penrose also published 'A Visit to the Zoological Gardens' (1829), 'Historical Conversations for Young Persons' (1836), 'Sermons for Children' (1837), and 'The New Children's Friend' (1832). The latter publication is a curious compound of didactic tales and conversations on matters as diverse as the history of the Isle of Man and the transmigration of the soul. 
By 1834 Elizabeth Penrose was unwell; she and her family moved to the Minster Yard, Lincoln, which was considered a more healthy situation. Here she died on 24 January 1837 and was buried in the cloisters of Lincoln Cathedral. 

'A History of England' proved more resilient than its author, and had reached its twelfth edition by 1846. It was republished in revised editions by Murray in 1853, 1859, and 1875. In 1865, when it was published by T. J. Allman, the editor, Mary Howitt, commented in her preface that the 'History of England' was 'well-known to all mothers whose children, like mine, received their first lessons in English history from its pages'. The longevity of its reputation is confirmed by the appearance in 1926 of a parodic version by Hilaire Belloc. Books of questions to accompany the 'History of England' were published in 1845, 1856, and 1858. With the possible exception of Maria Callcott's 'Little Arthur's History of England' (1835), it was the most successful nineteenth-century history textbook: it is hardly an exaggeration to say that it 'held its place as almost the only textbook of English history used in schools and families for nearly forty years' ('DNB').

Penrose, Francis (1718-1798), medical writer, was a surgeon who practised for many years at Bicester, Oxfordshire. He bought property in the nearby village of Chesterton, and later bought Chesterton Lodge, which he greatly improved. The estate was sold after his death. Penrose was chiefly remembered in the area for his attempt to investigate the ruins of Alchester in Wendlebury, the Roman station at the junction of two roads adjoining Chesterton. There, in a wood on the west side of the castrum, he discovered in 1766 the remains of a large building, within which were a tesselated pavement and a hypocaust. This building he described as the Praetorium. Penrose left Bicester about 1782, and went to live in Stonehouse, Devon, but did not practise there. 
Penrose was a prolific writer of pamphlets on scientific subjects related to medicine. His works do not, as a rule, repay perusal. He wrote 'A Treatise on Electricity' (1752), and 'An Essay on Magnetism' (1753). His 'Physical Essay on the Animal Economy', in which old physiological theories were revived, was published in 1754. His essay on the putrid sore throat and putrid fever, published in 1766, was a practical treatise, in which he recorded cases he had seen in his practice. His Newtonian 'Letters Philosophical and Astronomical', on 'the creation, the deluge, vegetation, the make and form of this terraqueous globe' was published in 1789. The letters were originally written to John Heaviside (1747/8-1828), and were dated from Stonehouse in 1783. The critical reviews in December 1788 said of them that 'the Mosaic account of the creation is here explained and defended, as well as the deluge, and gravity is accounted for by hot and cold ether'. Penrose's 'Essays... Founded on the... Chemistry of Lavoisier, Fourcroy...' (1794) was severely handled in the first volume of the 'Medical and Chirurgical Review' (1795). On the title-page he describes himself as MD for the first time; he is supposed to have obtained the degree at a German university. 
Penrose's son, James Penrose (1750-1818), was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to George III in November 1793, in succession to John Hunter (1728-1793). Francis Penrose died in his son's house at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, on 17 January 1798. Both father and son were buried in the churchyard at Hatfield, but no trace of their tombstone exists.

Penrose, John (1778-1859), Church of England clergyman and theological writer, was born at Cardinham, Cornwall, on 15 December 1778, the eldest son of John Penrose (1753-1829), then vicar of that parish, and afterwards rector of Fledborough and vicar of Thorney, both near Newark, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Jane (died 1818), second daughter of the Revd John Trevenen. 
Penrose was educated at home, and for a short time from 1794 to 1795 at Tiverton School. From there he went to Exeter College, Oxford, but stayed only three months before moving to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to take up an exhibition. He graduated BA in 1799 and MA in 1802. After teaching for a few months, he was ordained at Exeter in 1801, and he officiated at the chapelry of Marazion in Cornwall until he left Penzance in 1802. Afterwards, he held the vicarage of Langton by Wragby, Lincolnshire, (1802-59) and that of Poundstock, Cornwall (1803-9). In 1805 he returned to Oxford to study, and was Bampton lecturer in 1808, in which capacity he wrote his 'Attempt to Prove the Truth of Christianity', published in that year. In 1809 he became vicar of Bracebridge, near Lincoln. 
It was while living and teaching in Harefield, Middlesex, at this time that Penrose met and fell in love with Elizabeth (1780-1837), the daughter of Edmund Cartwright (1743-1823) and Alice Whittaker. They were married on 6 May 1814 and settled in Bracebridge that summer. Elizabeth Penrose was a children's historical author and teacher, writing under the pseudonym Mrs Markham. John (died 1888), their first son, was born in 1815; his twin brother was stillborn. Two more boys followed: Charles Thomas (1816?-1868) and Francis Cranmer Penrose (1817-1903), who was to become an architect and astronomer. 
Over the next forty years Penrose published a large quantity of mainly religious works, notably 'An Inquiry into the Nature of Human Motives' (1820) and 'Of Christian Sincerity' (1829). In 1837 his wife died. The same year, he was awarded the perpetual curacy of North Hykeham, Lincolnshire. In his later life, as well as sermons and treatises, he published the lives of his paternal and maternal uncles, Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Vinicombe Penrose and Captain James Trevenen, as well as, privately, a memoir of his father. 
Penrose died at Langton by Wragby on 9 August 1859, and was buried in the churchyard there.

Penrose, Thomas (1742-1779), poet, baptized at Newbury, Berkshire, on 9 September 1742, was the eldest son of Thomas Penrose (1715/16-1769), rector of that parish. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 30 May 1759, aged sixteen. After 1762 he left the university and joined a private expedition, partly English and partly Portuguese, which was formed for the attack of Buenos Aires, under the command of an adventurer named Captain Macnamara. The party left the Tagus on 30 August 1762, and on its way attacked the settlement of Nova Colonia de Sacramento in the River Plate, which had been seized by the Spanish. Operations were at first successful; but the chief ship, the 'Lord Clive', caught fire, and Macnamara was drowned, with most of the crew. The second vessel, the 'Ambuscade', in which Penrose served as a lieutenant of marines, escaped, and ultimately arrived at the Portuguese settlement of Rio de Janeiro. Penrose had been wounded in the fight and, although he recovered from his wounds, the hardships of the next month in a prize sloop undermined his constitution. Very soon afterwards he returned to England, and again settled at Oxford, graduating BA from Hertford College on 8 February 1766. In 1768 Penrose married Mary, eldest daughter of Samuel Slocock of Newbury. 
Penrose is described as possessing learning, eloquence, and good social qualities. His principal writings are mainly imitative of Collins and Gray; but several of his poems deal in a natural vein with his disappointments in life. A poetical essay, 'On the Contrarieties of Public Virtue', shows powers of irony and satire. His chief works were 'Flights of Fancy' (1775), 'Address to the Genius of Britain' (1775), a poem in blank verse proposing a limit to our 'civil dissensions' and criticizing the conduct of the government towards America, and a posthumous volume of poems (1781) with a biographical introduction by James Pettit Andrews, who had married his sister Anne. His work was included in Anderson's 'Complete Edition of the Poets' (vol. 11), Park's 'British Poets' (vol. 33), Pratt's 'Cabinet of Poetry' (vol. 5), and the Chiswick edition of 'British Poets' (vol. 63); and several of his poems are in Bell's 'Fugitive Poetry' (vols. 12 and 13). A poem by Penrose entitled 'Newberry Belles', signed 'P., Newbury, 8 May 1761', the characters in which are identified by Godwin, is in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' of 1761 (pp. 231-2), and two more of his poetical pieces are in the same periodical for 1799 (pt 2, pp. 1177-8). Campbell included two of Penrose's pieces -- 'The Helmets' and 'The Field of Battle' -- in his 'Specimens of the British Poets'. 
Penrose took holy orders, and became curate to his father at Newbury. About 1777 he was appointed by a friend to the rectory of Beckington-cum-Standerwick, near Frome in Somerset; but his health failed. He died at Bristol on 20 April 1779, and was buried at Clifton, where a monument was erected in his memory. 
Penrose's widow married at Newbury, in February 1786, the Revd Thomas Best, master of the free grammar school, and died about 1840, at the age of ninety-four. Penrose's only child, Thomas (died 1851), was admitted on the foundation of Winchester College, became fellow of New College, Oxford, and vicar of Writtle-cum-Roxwell. He wrote 'Sketch of the Lives and Writings of Dante and Petrarch' (1790).

Penruddock, John (1619-1655), royalist conspirator, was the eldest son of Sir John Penruddock (died 1648) of Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire. The Penruddocks had been established as a landed family in Wiltshire since the late sixteenth century and Sir John had served as sheriff of the county in 1635. John Penruddock was educated at Blandford School, Queen's College, Oxford, and Gray's Inn. In 1639 he married Arundel Freke, daughter of John Freke of Ewerne's Courtenay and Melcombe, Dorset. On the outbreak of the civil war the Penruddock family supported Charles I. John Penruddock rose to the rank of colonel and fought for the king until Easter 1645 when he resigned his commission and attempted to compound for his confiscated estates. Two of his younger brothers were killed fighting for the king. On his father's death in 1648 he inherited the family estate, but as a result of his inability to pay his composition fine, the lands remained sequestered for six years before he raised the $1300 required to regain them. He later estimated that he had amassed debts of about $1500 as a direct result of the war. 
During the early 1650s Penruddock refused to become reconciled to the new English state and in 1655 he was heavily involved in an abortive rising mounted by the underground royalist organization, the Sealed Knot. The conspirators had intended to stage a series of co-ordinated armed insurrections in a number of locations throughout England, but on 8 March risings near Newcastle upon Tyne, York, and Nottingham were quickly suppressed and another in Cheshire failed to materialize at all. Penruddock and his supporters had originally planned to seize Winchester but they dropped the idea after the town's garrison was reinforced at the last minute. Instead, on the night of 11 March, several hundred cavalry led by Penruddock and Sir Joseph Wagstaffe rendezvoused at Clarendon Park in Wiltshire, and before dawn rode into Salisbury and arrested the sheriff of the county and the judges who were conducting the Wiltshire assizes sessions there. After proclaiming their support for Charles Stuart, they left Salisbury and rode westward through Blandford, Sherborne, and Yeovil in the hope that the royalists of Somerset and Dorset would come in to swell their numbers. Very few, however, joined them and several days later a small force of government troops from the garrison at Exeter commanded by Captain Unton Croke caught up with them at South Molton in north Devon. After a skirmish the royalists were defeated and Penruddock was captured. 
In the aftermath of the rising Penruddock was put on trial for treason before a jury of local men at Exeter. According to his own account of his trial he argued that opposing Cromwell could not constitute treason as the protector's power had not been legally sanctioned, and declared to the judge: 'The law I am now tried by is no law, but what is cut out by the poynt of a rebellious sword' (Penruddock, 5). He told the jury: 'I observe treason in this age to be an 'individuum vagum', like the wind in the Gospel, which bloweth where it listeth; for that shall be treason in me today which shall be none in another tomorrow' (ibid., 6). He also argued that, on his surrender at South Molton, Croke had offered him security for his life and estates. These arguments were dismissed and he was sentenced to death. 
At the end of the trial Penruddock expressed his hope that Cromwell would commute his sentence. His wife, Arundel, subsequently campaigned vigorously on his behalf, travelling to London to plead with Cromwell for his life. All her efforts were in vain, however, and he was beheaded at Exeter on 16 May 1655. Shortly afterwards an account of his last days and execution was circulated by his friend Seymour Bowman. This contained what the author claimed was the last correspondence between Penruddock and his wife. Penruddock was said to have written at one point: 'though the armies of men have been too hard for me, yet am I now lifting myself under the conduct of my Sovereign and an army of martyrs, that the gates of hell cannot prevail against' (Ravenhill, 15.3). No original manuscripts of this correspondence exist, and its authenticity must be doubted; none the less, its circulation along with the account of the trial did much to turn Penruddock into a martyr for the royalist cause. His estates were subsequently confiscated, but Cromwell later responded to a petition from his widow and granted a portion of them back to the family. The decision to send out major-generals to govern England in the autumn of 1655 was a direct response to Penruddock's rebellion.

Penry, John (1562/3-1593), religious controversialist, was born in Brecknockshire, the son of Meredith Penry of Llangamarch. He may have attended the grammar school in Brecon before he entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 11 June 1580. He graduated BA in 1584 and then withdrew from his college for just over a year, spending part of this time in Wales. He went back to Cambridge in October 1585, but in the following June migrated to Oxford and took the degree of MA from St Alban Hall in July 1586. Probably already in close contact with the most forward protestants in Oxford, Penry refused to seek ordination in what he considered to be an insufficiently reformed church, though he preached in both universities and also in Northampton, where as early as 1587 Richard Bancroft believed he had become a member of the classis. 
Immediately after he had obtained his master's degree Penry turned his attention to the state of the church in his native land, and in 1586 compiled 'A treatise containing the aequity of an humble supplication which is to be exhibited unto hir gracious maiesty and this high court of parliament in the behalfe of the countrey of Wales, that some order may be taken for the preaching of the gospell among those people'. Having heard that parliament might be dissolved, early in 1587 Penry gained a licence for his tract, had 500 copies printed in Oxford, and brought them hurriedly to London. On 28 February he persuaded Edward Dounlee, the member for Carmarthen, to present 'The Aequity' to the House of Commons, where it gained the enthusiastic support of the Warwickshire MP, Job Throckmorton. However, Archbishop Whitgift was indignant that parliament should be interfering in matters of religion, and even before the session had ended issued warrants for the seizure of the book and its author. Penry appeared before the high commission in March 1587 on a charge of having published treason and heresy, and was pronounced guilty and imprisoned in the Gatehouse for a month. 
Determined not to abandon his mission to rescue his countrymen from their ignorance and blindness, Penry at once set to work on another publication. Since he now stood no chance of procuring an episcopal licence, he needed access to a secret press, and it seems that a Cambridge friend, John Udall, introduced him to the printer Robert Waldegrave, who in April 1588, at his printing house in the Strand, published 'An exhortation unto the governours and people of her maiesties countrie of Wales, to labor earnestly to have the preaching of the gospell planted among them'. During the course of the year Waldegrave brought out two more editions of this much longer work, which denounced the bishops as soul murderers for their neglect of the people of Wales. 
Penry had just taken the stock of his second book from Waldegrave's house when it was raided on 16 April 1588. The printer and his wife removed what type they could salvage to Elizabeth Crane's house in Aldermanbury and then, after Penry had procured a new press, resumed printing at Mrs Crane's country estate at East Molesey. The press was still in Surrey when in August 1588 Waldegrave published 'A defence of that which hath bin written in the questions of the ignorant ministerie, and the communicating with them', Penry's interim reply to 'A Godly Treatise', a vindication of the clergy of the English church by Robert Some. 
At this period Penry seems to have been living intermittently in Northampton, and on 5 September 1588 he married Helen, the daughter of Henry Godly, a minor town official, in All Saints' Church. When Some brought out a rejoinder to 'A Defence of that which hath bin Written', Penry embarked on a second reply, but instead of printing this, in October 1588 Waldegrave gave precedence to 'The Epistle', the first of the Marprelate tracts. 
Although there can be no doubt that by the summer of 1588 he had assumed the management of the secret press, most historians think that Penry took only a minor part, if any part at all, in the writing of the Marprelate tracts, and Leland Carlson has argued persuasively for Job Thockmorton's identification with Martin Marprelate. After the appearance of 'The Epistle' and the ensuing publicity, Mrs Crane felt unable to shelter the press any longer, and in November Penry negotiated its removal to Sir Richard Knightley's house at Fawsley in Northamptonshire. Early in 1589 it was thought prudent to move the press again, and Knightley arranged for it to go to his kinsman, John Hales, at the White Friars in Coventry. In between Marprelate tracts, Waldegrave published for Penry in February 1589 'A viewe of some part of such publike wants & disorderes as are in the service of God, within her maiesties countrie of Wales, togither with an humble petition, unto this high court of parliament for their speedy redresse'. 
Increasingly uneasy over Marprelate's levity, Waldegrave left the press in March, sold his type to Throckmorton and withdrew to France, taking with him the manuscript of Penry's most autobiographical tract, 'Th' appellation of John Penri, unto the highe court of parliament, from the bad and injurious dealing of th'archb. of Canterb. & other his colleagues of the high commission'. Here Penry bewailed yet again 'the lamentable misery of soules, wherein my countrymen the inhabitants of Wales live at this present', before going on to attack 'the unjust oppression of Gods church by ungodly and tiranical Lord Bishops' (Penry, 'Th' Appellation', 2, 16). Waldegrave printed 'Th' Appellation' in La Rochelle in July 1589, returning secretly to England with copies of the work in the autumn. 
On Waldegrave's departure Penry hired a new printer, John Hodgkins, and continued his association with the venture, which he next transferred to Wolston Priory at the invitation of Roger Wigston's wife. Government searchers, however, were making it impossible for the press to remain in the midlands, so Hodgkins attempted to move to the north of England, but the press was finally apprehended near Manchester towards the end of August 1589. Penry had not left Wolston when news of the seizure came, and for a time went from one hiding place to another. Then at the beginning of October, provided with money by Throckmorton, he fled to Scotland, where his wife joined him. Waldegrave also sought refuge in Scotland, finding work there as the king's printer. 
Hospitably received by the Edinburgh ministers, in 'A briefe discovery of the untruthes and slanders (against the true governement of the church of Christ)' Penry tried to repay their generosity by defending Scottish presbyterians against the aspersions of disloyalty made by Bancroft in his Paul's Cross sermon of February 1589. Waldegrave published this tract without attribution early in 1590, but when Penry next attempted to clear himself of treasonable activities, in 'A treatise wherein is manifestlie proved, that reformation and those that sincerely favor the same, are unjustly charged to be enemies unto hir maiestie and the state', he brought out the work as he normally did, under his own name. 
Following protests from the English ambassador about Penry's activities, James VI had him proclaimed an outlaw in the summer of 1590, but apart from a clandestine visit to London at the time of the Hacket conspiracy in July 1591, Penry succeeded in remaining quietly in Scotland for a further two years, involving himself in the far less controversial task of translating a work by Theodore Beza, published as 'Propositions and Principles' in Edinburgh in 1591. In Scotland he probably also began, but never lived to finish, 'The Historie of Corah, Dathan and Abiram', in which he attempted to make a complete separation between allegiance to the crown and membership of the English church. It was published posthumously in Middelburg in 1609. 
Until he left England he was a firm believer in the presbyterian form of church government, but Penry, like Robert Browne before him, seems to have changed his opinions after experiencing a presbyterian church at first hand. When in September 1592 he decided to come south to make yet another attempt to procure the conversion of Wales, as soon as he reached London he attached himself to the separatist church of Barrow and Greenwood, then under the leadership of Francis Johnson. Although he accepted no formal office, he certainly preached to the church and drew up petitions for its freedom from arrest and for the release of its members from prison, in addition to composing an answer to 'XV Slanderous Articles', which had attacked the separatists. 
After several months in flight from the authorities Penry was captured in Stepney on 22 March 1593. Subjected to a series of examinations, he admitted having published 'Reformation No Enemie' and the 'Propositions and Principles' while in Scotland. Desperate to prove his innocence of any crime, he next produced a 'Declaration of faith and allegiance', in which he protested his total loyalty to the queen while refusing to associate in public worship with the assemblies of the land. On 6 April Barrow and Greenwood were hanged for treason at Tyburn, and Penry realized that he might well suffer the same fate. On the day Barrow and Greenwood died he composed a farewell letter to his wife, on 10 April another letter to his daughters, and on 14 April one entitled 'To the Distressed Faithfull Congregation of Christ in London'. His first trial took place in king's bench on 21 May, on a charge of intending to overthrow religion and inciting the queen's subjects to rebellion and insurrection. When the prosecution began using information from private papers taken from him in Scotland, Penry appealed to Burghley against the injustice of the procedure, and the trial was suspended. At a new trial which began on 25 May the prosecution employed 'Reformation No Enemie' as evidence against him, and he was pronounced guilty of publishing scandalous writings against the church. Although the indictment had made no mention of the Marprelate tracts, the conviction that Penry was Martin Marprelate lay behind his condemnation. On 28 May Penry addressed a final plea to Burghley to procure a pardon from the queen, but Burghley could not help him. Early on 29 May 1593 Whitgift, Sir John Popham, and Sir John Puckering signed the death warrant, and later the same day Penry was hanged at St Thomas-a-Watering in Surrey. 
Aged only thirty in 1593, in addition to his young wife Penry left four little daughters, Deliverance, Comfort, Safety, and Sure Hope, the eldest aged four, the youngest only a few weeks old at his death. Deliverance certainly lived to maturity. For a time a member of the household of Francis Johnson, the minister of the exiled separatist church, in May 1611 she married in Amsterdam an English bombazine worker, Samuel Whitaker.

Pentland, Joseph Barclay (1797-1873), naturalist and traveller, was born in Ballybofey, co. Donegal, Ireland, on 17 January 1797. Nothing is known of his early life save that he was educated at the Royal School, Armagh, and at the University of Paris. He became associated with Cuvier, vividly reporting day-to-day events in the Jardin des Plantes in a long series of letters to William Buckland and making percipient observations on the osteology of fossil marine reptiles (ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs), which were to be drawn upon in W. D. Conybeare's descriptions. In addition to his work for Cuvier, Pentland studied fossil bones from India and Australia and collected them in Italy, an extinct pygmy hippopotamus from Sicily being named 'Hippopotamus pentlandi' after him. 
Appointed secretary to the British consul-generalship in Lima (1826-8), Pentland undertook extensive explorations in newly independent Bolivia. Using the most up-to-date barometers, he determined the heights of many Andean peaks, including Gualtieri (22,000 ft), Arequipa (later El Misti, 18,300 ft), Illimani (21,300 ft), and Chirquibamba (21,000 ft); the measurements, though since corrected, were of the right order of magnitude. Pentland recognized that most of these mountains were volcanoes, but also discovered Palaeozoic fossils at high altitudes (14,000 to 17,000 ft). He examined the antiquities of Cuzco and visited Lake Titicaca, perceiving that the Rio Desaguadero, hitherto thought to flow into the lake, was in fact its outlet. His 'Report on Bolivia' to the Foreign Office, though the first substantial account of that country's geography, was not published until 1974, edited by J. V. Fifer ('Camden Miscellany', 25). 
After returning to Europe and preparing the posthumous catalogue of Cuvier's collection, Pentland was appointed consul-general in La Paz to the short-lived Peru-Bolivia Confederation (1836-9). He undertook further explorations, preparing a first map of Lake Titicaca (close to which he found fossil 'mastodon' bones) and disinterring human skulls from nearby tombs. He collected many plant and animal specimens, at least three plant species and a bird (the Andean tinamou) being consequently named after him. 
Following his second return to Europe, Pentland remained interested in South America, supporting the work of explorers John Bowring and Hugh Weddell, encouraging the growing of Andean plants in Kew Gardens and the Jardin des Plantes and, in particular, being instrumental in arranging for the introduction of 'Cinchona' -- the quinine plant -- to the West Indies. He helped Mary Somerville in the preparation for publication of maps of Peru and Bolivia for her 'Physical Geography' (1848). A hitherto undescribed nickel-iron mineral he had obtained from Craigmure, Argyll, came to be named 'pentlandite'. 
Pentland never married. From 1845 he made Rome his home, becoming so well acquainted with the antiquities of Italy that he edited for John Murray three editions of 'A Handbook of Rome and its Environs' (1860, 1871, and 1872); 'A Handbook for Travellers in Southern Italy' (6th edn, 1868); and 'A Handbook for Travellers in Northern Italy' (11th edn, 1869). During two visits by the prince of Wales to Rome, Pentland acted as his cicerone. He died at his home, 3 Motcomb Street, Belgrave Square, London, on 12 July 1873 and was buried in Brompton cemetery.

Penton, Stephen (1639-1706), college head, the son of Stephen Penton, was born at Winchester on 30 March 1639 and baptized at St John's Church there on 9 April 1639. He was admitted as a scholar of Winchester College in 1653, matriculated from New College, Oxford, on 28 June 1659 and became a probationary fellow in the same year. From 1661 to 1672 he was a full fellow of the college. He graduated BA on 5 May 1663 and proceeded MA on 17 January 1667. From 1670 to 1676 he held the rectory of Tingewick in Buckinghamshire through the gift of his college. From at least 1671 he served as chaplain to Robert Bruce, earl of Ailesbury and Elgin, and as tutor to his son Thomas. On 15 February 1676 he was appointed principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, by the provost and fellows of Queen's College on the condition that he resign his living at Tingewick, to which his college, as part of this arrangement, later appointed a fellow of Queen's, Lancelot Bland. 
Andrew Allum, Penton's vice-principal, considered him a less capable administrator than his predecessor, Thomas Tully. Certainly admissions declined during Penton's principalship from eleven in 1680 down to four in 1683. One reason for this downward trend, according to Allum, was Penton's marked preference for an 'inconsiderable set of gentlemen commoners, now his darling creatures' (Kelly, 46). As part of Penton's scheme to make the hall more attractive to the sons of the gentry he was responsible for building the college chapel and its adjoining library on a strip of land he obtained through his connections at New College. Money was raised out of Penton's own pocket and from the sale of plate given to the college by his predecessor. The chapel, built in the same Palladian style as neighbouring Queen's, was consecrated by John Fell, bishop of Oxford, on 7 April 1682. It was also a desire to attract more students from the gentry to Oxford that lay behind Penton's most famous literary work, 'The Guardian's Instruction' (1688), which tried to demonstrate the value of an education at the university, particularly for those younger sons who would not inherit their father's estates. The aims of this work were expanded in Penton's 'New Instructions to the Guardian' (1694), which covered the education of the sons of the gentry from the age of three to twenty-one and urged that the professions of law, medicine, and divinity were not beneath gentlemen. Aside from these works Penton also published, in 1682, a treatise asserting the lawfulness of bowing or kneeling at the altar. 
The efforts to attract the gentry to St Edmund Hall were limited in their success. Penton resigned the principalship for reasons of health (he appears to have suffered from jaundice) on 7 March 1684 and on leaving made a present of twelve silver-handled knives and forks to the college. In 1684 he was nominated to the living of Glympton, Oxfordshire, by Frances Wheate, widow of Thomas Wheate, a position he held until 1693. Over the same period he was also lecturer in the neighbouring church at Churchill. On the nomination of his old pupil Thomas Bruce, now Lord Ailesbury, he was instituted on 27 September 1693 to the rectory of Wath by Ripon, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and was collated on 28 May 1701 to the third prebendal stall at Ripon, holding both preferments until his death. He seems to have lived mainly in the north from 1693 onwards, though he still used his influence to get Robert Wood, the son of Thomas Wood, a fellowship at All Souls in 1694. A sermon given at Oxford in September 1705, praising the duke of Marlborough, is often attributed to Penton, as he had been a fellow of New College, but it was actually preached by his nephew Henry. Penton died a bachelor on 17 October 1706 at Wath by Ripon and was buried on 20 October in the chancel of Wath church, where an epitaph that he wrote himself was inscribed on a brass plate. This quaint inscription (it opened: 'Here lies what's left of Stephen Penton, Rector, who being dead, / Yet speaketh once for all: My beloved Parishioners. / Since any one of you may be the next, / Let every one prepare to do so') aroused some criticism from contemporaries (Whitaker, 187). He left most of his estate to the poor of the parish, having already given most of his books to the Bodleian and St Edmund Hall libraries.

Peploe, Samuel (bap. 1667, d. 1752), bishop of Chester and religious controversialist, the son of Podmore Peploe, was baptized at Dawley Parva in Shropshire on 29 July 1667. Following attendance at Penkridge School in Staffordshire he matriculated as a batteler of Jesus College, Oxford, on 12 May 1687, graduating BA on 12 March 1691 and proceeding MA in 1693. After he had taken holy orders, his preferment was rapid: in 1695 he was presented to the rectory of Kedleston, near Derby, and in 1700 to the vicarage of Preston in Lancashire, where he quickly established a reputation as an outspoken enemy of a largely Roman Catholic population. His first wife, Ann Browne, with whom he had a son and four daughters, died on 25 November 1705; and on 8 January 1712 he married Ann Birch, a daughter of the previous incumbent at Preston. There were no surviving children from this second marriage. 
Peploe's patrons at Preston, the Hoghtons of Hoghton Tower, were themselves staunch Presbyterians and it was undoubtedly Peploe's low-church sympathies in religion and strident whiggism in politics that recommended him to them. Lancashire in the first half of the eighteenth century was a county of religious and political extremes, where contemporary discourse portrayed the antagonism of a predominantly Roman Catholic, nonjuring, and Jacobite gentry to a palatine establishment well leavened with protestant dissenters. Conforming Anglicans like Peploe were obliged to pick their way between such rhetorical shoals with extreme care. 
When the Jacobite forces entered Preston in November 1715 Peploe reportedly mounted his pulpit to preach a sermon exhorting his parishioners to abjure the pretender and manifest their loyalty to the house of Brunswick. But it was less this alleged act of signal bravery than his well-publicized sermons against the dangers of popery and efforts on behalf of the forfeited estates commission that brought him to the attention of ministers. On 1 July 1717 he was nominated to the vacant wardenship of Manchester collegiate church; he was, however, subsequently refused induction by his diocesan, Francis Gastrell, on the grounds that the degree of bachelor of divinity conferred upon him by faculty at Lambeth was not a valid qualification. Years of litigation, pamphleteering, and personal enmity ensued, culminating in a determination in king's bench that, for such purposes at least, degrees conferred by the archbishop of Canterbury were of equal value to those granted by the universities. 
When Bishop Gastrell died in 1725 the question of his successor at Chester was hotly disputed, with rival church dignitaries each pressing the merits of their clients upon the ministry. Peploe was almost certainly the candidate of Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, but he was assured by the duke of Newcastle that his advancement came as reward for his 'zeal and affection to the true interest of our king and country' (duke of Newcastle to S. Peploe, 15 Jan 1726, TNA: PRO, SP 35/61, fol. 15). He was consecrated on 12 April 1726 and, though obliged to resign his benefice at Preston, was permitted to retain the wardenship at Manchester 'in commendam'. Contention there, however, continued unabated, with bitter wrangles over the visitorship and appointment of a chaplain. Indeed in the absence of any county-wide election contests in Lancashire after 1722, Manchester College came to constitute a ritual forum in which local partisans could carry on their ideological battles by subtler means. 
At first Peploe's situation at Chester was little better, with an episcopal bureaucracy appointed by his predecessors and his cathedral firmly under the control of a tory chapter. Over the course of the next twelve years, though, the new bishop worked diligently to build up the whig interest in his diocese, supplying men of proven whig loyalties to vacant benefices in his gift and using his credit with the government to make like-minded appointments to the chapter. By such methods was the tories' stranglehold on diocesan machinery eroded and eventually broken down: in 1738 Peploe resigned his wardenship at Manchester in favour of his son Samuel (1699-1781), and in the following year he saw a whig majority at last established in his cathedral. 
From his earliest days at Preston, Peploe had identified himself with contemporary movements for the reformation of manners and the establishment of charity schools. He was a co-founder of the town's blue coat school in 1702 and of Cadley School five years later. Such institutions, he would assert in 1730, 'shewed the ways of piety, peace and temperance' (S. Peploe, 'A Sermon Preach'd in the Parish Church of St Sepulchre, April the 2d 1730', 1730, 20), made the rich mindful of their Christian obligations to the poor, and served as a bulwark against the moral depravity of society. Although frequently at odds with Anglican zealots, Peploe was nevertheless an assiduous defender of the church against its enemies. He understood the extent of popular prejudice against the clergy and strove to overcome it. 'They have represented us as Useless and Burdensome, as Idle and Superficial in our ministerial Performances,' he wrote in a charge to his diocesan clergy on the occasion of a visitation in 1747; 'which, however true it may be in regard to some particular Persons... yet surely, it is an unjust Imputation on the Body of the Clergy' (Green, 'Charity, morality, and social control', 21). During his episcopate he consecrated thirty-nine churches and chapels, largely with the aim of counteracting the influence of Roman Catholicism, and erected two new galleries in the choir of his cathedral; he was normally resident in his bishopric whenever parliament was not in session; and in general he carried out the pastoral duties of his episcopal office, including visitations and confirmations, with greater fervour and conscientiousness than was common among Hanoverian prelates. 
A pugnacious temperament led Peploe into conflict with a succession of locally prominent figures and ensured that he would be remembered primarily as a protagonist in partisan causes. Perhaps his defining characteristic, though, was a virulent anti-Catholicism which, growing out of circumstances in his diocese, informed his theology as well as his politics. When the Jacobites threatened once more in 1745, he subscribed $200 towards local defences and delivered a sermon against 'Popish idolatry' in his cathedral. After years of failing health, which denied him translation to the see of Bath and Wells, he died on 21 February 1752; he was survived by his second wife. Peploe was buried in Chester Cathedral on 28 February.

Pepper, John Henry (1821-1900), illusionist and educationist, was born at Great Queen Street, Westminster, on 17 June 1821, the son of Charles Bailey Pepper (died 1854), a civil engineer. He was educated at Loughborough House, Brixton, and King's College School, in the Strand, London, and was then a pupil of the chemist John Thomas Cooper. In 1840 he was appointed assistant chemical lecturer at the Granger school of medicine. He married on 22 May 1845 Mary Ann Benwell; they had no children of their own but adopted a son. 
In 1847 Pepper gave his first lecture at the Royal Polytechnic in Regent Street (founded in 1838), and in 1848 he was appointed analytical chemist and lecturer to that institution. Some four years later he became 'honorary' director of the polytechnic at a fixed salary, a post he held for twenty years. He lectured frequently at the polytechnic, and was invited to numerous schools, at which he delighted juvenile audiences by popular experiments, illusions, and magic-lantern displays. He also issued a series of unpretentious manuals of popular science, which had a wide circulation. Among the most popular was 'The Boy's Playbook of Science' (1860), an extensively illustrated manual of experiments which could be carried out in the home to demonstrate the properties of matter. A revised edition appeared in 1912. On the title-pages of his books he described himself as fellow of the Chemical Society, and honorary associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. His title of professor was conferred upon him 'by express minute of the Polytechnic board', and was not therefore, he was careful to explain, that of a hairdresser or a dancing master (Pepper, 2). 
Pepper ran educational classes in connection with the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington. These hardly covered the costs of his lease of the premises at the polytechnic, which was severely hit by declining attendances in the winter of 1862, following the success of the second Great Exhibition. His instincts as a showman succeeded in reviving the popularity of the institution and ensuring its future by means of presentations of an optical illusion, involving mirrors and a hidden stage, described by 'The Times' as the most wonderful ever put before the public. In September 1858 Henry Dircks of Blackheath had communicated to the British Association the details of an apparatus for producing 'spectral optical illusions'. The idea was rejected by several entertainers, but Pepper recognized its potential and, after some not very important modifications in the machinery, exhibited the 'ghost' for the first time on 24 December 1862, in illustration of Dickens's 'Haunted Man'. On 5 February 1863 the apparatus was patented in the joint names of Pepper and Dircks. The two men later fell out, Dircks complaining with some justification that his name as that of sole inventor was unduly obscured in the advertisements of the exhibition. Popularly known as 'Pepper's ghost', the illusion had an enormous vogue, was visited by the prince and princess of Wales (19 May 1863), commanded to Windsor, and transferred to the boards of many London theatres, to the Chatelet at Paris, to Wallack's Theatre, New York, and to the Crystal Palace. 
In March 1872 Pepper temporarily transferred his exhibit to the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, but lost money on it. He travelled with his show in America and Canada during 1874-9, and took it to Australia in 1879-81. He settled in Brisbane as public analyst from 1881 to 1889, when he returned to England. He reintroduced his 'ghost' at the polytechnic, but the spectre failed to appeal to a sophisticated public, and its proprietor withdrew into private life. His first wife died in December 1889 and he married again. Later he entered the Church of Rome. The 'Professor' died at Ifield Villa, 55 Colworth Road, Leytonstone, Essex, on 25 March 1900, leaving a widow, Janet. He was buried in Norwood cemetery.

Pepperrell, Sir William, first baronet (1696-1759), army officer and merchant, was born on 27 June 1696 at Kittery Point, Maine (then part of Massachusetts), the sixth of eight children of William Pepperrell (1648-1734), merchant and shipowner, and his wife, Margery (1659-1741), daughter of John Bray. The son of a prosperous citizen who had emigrated from Devon or from Wales as a penniless fisherman, Pepperrell grew up in comfortable circumstances. He received some formal education from his father and private tutors, mostly in practical matters such as geography, surveying, and navigation. Taking a personal share in operating his father's store, he grew up affable, robust, and hardy. He was accustomed to Indian warfare, and was trained in the use of arms. He joined the Maine militia when he was sixteen and was a colonel by 1722. After becoming a partner in his father's business he rapidly improved it, building ships, trading in fish, and importing goods for sale in Boston. He and his father invested the profits from these ventures in real estate, and soon they were almost sole proprietors of the townships of Saco and Scarboro, with large properties in Portsmouth, Hampton, and elsewhere. Pepperrell was shortly one of the foremost men in the colony. On 21 February 1723 he married Mary Hirst (died 1789), granddaughter of Samuel Sewall, chief justice of Massachusetts; they had four children, two of whom died in infancy. 
In 1725 Pepperrell became a justice of the peace in York county. A year later he was elected to the Massachusetts general court and appointed commander of the Maine militia. He was elected to the Massachusetts council in 1727, and was thereafter annually re-elected until his death. He served for eighteen years as the council's president. Also in 1727 he attended his first Indian conference, afterwards becoming an expert in Indian affairs. He was appointed chief justice of the York county court of common pleas in 1730, and began studying law. When his father died in 1734 he inherited the bulk of the estate, thus becoming even richer and more powerful. Pepperrell underwent a religious conversion in 1734, was baptized, and subsequently evinced great and sincere piety. In 1744 his son Andrew joined him in business after graduation from Harvard College; Andrew died in 1751. Pepperrell's son-in-law, Nathaniel Sparhawk, who had married his daughter Elizabeth, also entered the business. 
In 1745 Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts appointed Pepperrell to command an expedition against the French fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island. On 30 April Pepperrell landed an army of 4300 men near the fortress, and commenced a determined siege. He assaulted Louisbourg on 26 May, suffering huge casualties, and soon supplies ran short. His troops' morale flagged as half of them fell sick, but they were heartened in late May when the Americans captured a French frigate sent to resupply the fortress. On 16 June, one day before Pepperrell was to launch a second assault, the French garrison surrendered. Although he had not shown great martial skill, Pepperrell had held his forces together and retained the co-operation of the British fleet. For his services he was commissioned a colonel in the British army on 1 September 1745 and authorized to raise a regiment, which he did, the 51st regiment. Also, on 15 November 1746 he was created a baronet, the first such honour given a native-born American. 
Pepperrell remained at Louisbourg until the spring of 1746, then returned home. In 1749, having retired from business, he visited London, where he was cordially received by George II and presented by the City with a service of plate. He helped negotiate a treaty with the Indians in 1753. On the renewal of war with France in 1755 he was commissioned a major-general and given command of the eastern frontier. He was acting governor of Massachusetts from March to August 1757. On 20 February 1759 he was promoted lieutenant-general, another first for an American-born Englishman. He died at his home at Kittery Point on 16 July 1759 after a 'lingering illness' (Fairchild, 195), leaving his vast estate to his grandson William Sparhawk, who took the surname Pepperrell.

Pepusch, John Christopher (1666/7-1752), composer and teacher of music, the son of a German protestant clergyman, was born at Berlin and baptized Johann Christoph Pepusch. Nothing more is known of his parents, nor is his date of birth certain, but according to the memorial tablet erected at the Charterhouse by his colleagues and pupils in 1767, he was eighty-five when he died. He studied theory under Martin Klingenberg, cantor of the Marienkirche in Berlin, and organ under Grosse, a Saxon otherwise unknown. At the age of fourteen Pepusch played the harpsichord at court and was soon afterwards appointed by Electress Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg to be the teacher of the electoral prince (later Frederick William I of Prussia). He moved to London by way of Holland, supposedly after witnessing 'a terrible act of despotism' (Burney, 2.985) by the elector, arriving shortly after the treaty of Ryswick in September 1697. 
Pepusch's first documented appearance in England was in April 1704, when he provided compositions for an ensemble of visiting musicians headed by his brother Heinrich Gottfried Pepusch (died 1750), an oboist employed by the Prussian court from 1692 to about 1736. He may already have been a member of the band at the Drury Lane Theatre and he certainly moved from there in early 1708 to join the opera company operating from the new Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket. At the same time he took up residence in Hooker's (later Boswell) Court. For the next seven years he served the opera as violinist and harpsichordist, and prepared the pasticcio 'Thomyris, Queen of Scythia' in April 1707, for which he composed the recitatives and added some additional songs. 
Pepusch also served as the agent and accompanist for the soprano (Francesca) Margherita (also Marguerite or Margaretta) de L'Epine (d. 1746) from about 1705, and as the organizer of public concerts at which many of his own works were performed. He was apparently already well known as a composer of instrumental works when he arrived in London, and he published a series of eight volumes in Amsterdam between 1705 and 1718, including five sets of violin sonatas, two of trio sonatas, and one each of recorder sonatas and concertos. A number of these works were also published in London, apparently without his permission. A number of concertos, solo and trio sonatas, and miscellaneous keyboard works remain in manuscript. The most interesting of these are seven sets of sonatas composed for various English violinists, each containing sixteen works in as many keys. 
Pepusch was also active as a composer of vocal music. In 1710 he published 'Six English Cantatas' to a set of texts by John Hughes. These, according to the poet, were written to demonstrate the desirability of setting English words to the newly imported Italian style of music. The most famous, 'Alexis', was sung well into the nineteenth century in a slightly adapted form with cello obbligato. 
On 9 July 1713 Pepusch took his DMus degree from Oxford, matriculating from Magdalen College. The music to his academic ode in honour of Queen Anne, 'Hail, Queen of Islands! Hail, Illustrious Fair', does not survive, nor does that to his ode on the coronation of George I the following year. 
In 1714 Pepusch transferred his allegiance to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, bringing with him singers and instrumentalists from the opera company at the Queen's Theatre. For this company he composed four masques with music in an Italianate style: 'Venus and Adonis' (1715), 'Myrtillo and Laura' (1715), 'Apollo and Daphne' (1716), and 'The Death of Dido' (1716). These works were generally well received and seem to have influenced Handel in his composition of 'Acis and Galatea'. 
For the 1716-17 season Pepusch joined John Rich's company at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, again bringing with him other performers. He remained until 1732 as director of the orchestra, while ceding most of the composing duties to John Ernest Galliard. Pepusch did continue to write cantatas, many of which were performed at public concerts or between the acts of plays. Some of these are included in his second book of 'Six English Cantatas' published in 1720, and in other anthologies; perhaps a dozen more survive in manuscript or are lost. He also provided additional songs for a 1719 revival of 'Thomyris, Queen of Scythia'. 
Pepusch disappears from the London newspapers for the 1717-18 season, presumably because of his involvement with the musical establishment of James Brydges, second earl of Carnarvon and later first duke of Chandos. He is recorded at Cannons, Chandos's estate near Edgware in Middlesex, as early as December 1717. He was again active at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre during the 1718-19 season, but seems to have been appointed musical director at Cannons in early 1719 with a salary of $25 per quarter. He held this position until mid-1723, after which he supplied musicians from London on an occasional basis. 
At Cannons, Pepusch composed both sacred and secular music, in the earliest years as a colleague of Nicola Francesco Haym and George Frideric Handel, and was eventually responsible for an ensemble of some twenty-five singers and instrumentalists. The vast majority of Pepusch's fifteen known anthems, most for solo voices, chorus, and instruments, were written for services held in the parish church of St Lawrence, Little Stanmore, located adjacent to the estate. Pepusch also seems to have begun his career as a teacher of music about this time, and several of his students from Cannons, including Thomas Salway and Thomas Rawlings, became successful performers. 
Some time during this period Pepusch married L'Epine, but the exact date has never been established. It may have been as early as 1718, when she first tentatively retired from the London stage, but it seems likely that Pepusch's appointment at Cannons in 1719 provided the financial security that permitted both their marriage and her official retirement from the stage after 28 May 1719. Their only child, a son, John, who died on 11 July 1739 after reputedly showing signs of considerable musical talent, was baptized at St Clement Danes on 9 January 1724. L'Epine remained active as a singing teacher, and Pepusch wrote cantatas during the 1720s for a number of her students. 
Pepusch returned to Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre for the 1723-4 season and provided a 'musical entertainment' for St Cecilia's day 1723 entitled 'The Union of the Three Sister Arts', the songs from which were published. He also provided new music (now lost) for a revival of Thomas Betterton's and John Dryden's 'The Prophetess, or, The History of Dioclesian' the following year but composed relatively little after this date. 
Pepusch was almost certainly in charge of the music for John Gay's 'The Beggar's Opera', which opened on 29 January 1728. He composed the overture and may have had a hand in arranging the airs; that the musically inept basses in the printed edition are a reflection of his work seems unlikely. Gay's sequel, 'Polly', was published in 1729 but not performed on stage until 1777; again the extent of Pepusch's involvement is unknown. Both Burney and Hawkins say that at about this time Pepusch set out for North America in support of Bishop George Berkeley's project for a college there, but was shipwrecked. However, Berkeley sailed (to Rhode Island) without misadventure and Pepusch is not mentioned among his travelling companions. He seems to have retired after the 1732-3 season when Rich decided to move the entire company to his Covent Garden Theatre, which was further away from Hooker's Court. 
In 1726 Pepusch had been one of the founders of the Academy of Ancient Music, remaining its director until 1751, and from the 1730s it increasingly became a central focus of his activities. The singers were initially drawn from the choirs of St Paul's Cathedral and the Chapel Royal. In the early 1730s Maurice Greene left to establish a rival academy at the Apollo tavern, taking the St Paul's boys with him, and Bernard Gates also withdrew the Chapel Royal boys. After a year's struggle without trebles, it was arranged that Pepusch and at least one assistant would instruct boys in singing, accompanying on the harpsichord, and composition, as well as English grammar, writing, and arithmetic for a nominal fee. This may have been made easier by his move to a larger house in Fetter Lane in late 1734. 
Pepusch also continued to teach privately, and his reputation grew. He was convinced of the perfection of Corelli's compositions, and published corrected and revised editions of the Italian composer's sonatas and concertos in score in 1732. According to Hawkins, Pepusch developed a 'musical code, consisting of rules extracted from the Works of his favourite Author, and the exercises which he enjoined his disciples were divisions on, and harmonies adapted to, basses selected from his works' (Hawkins, 'Life of Dr. Pepusch', 301). Among his pupils were William Boyce, James Nares, Samuel Howard, Benjamin Cooke, John Travers, William Babell, George Berg, William Savage, and John Christopher Smith jun. 
In 1730 'A Treatise on Harmony: Containing the Chief Rules for Composing in Two, Three and Four Parts' was published anonymously. According to Hawkins, it was the work of Pepusch's student James Hamilton, Viscount Paisley and later seventh earl of Abercorn, and published without his permission. It probably illustrates elements of Pepusch's teaching, and the revised version which appeared the following year may have been done with Pepusch's assistance. Other reflections of Pepusch's teaching may be seen in the various 'Notes on harmony' compiled by Benjamin Cooke between 1745 and 1751 (manuscripts in the British Library and the Royal College of Music), but 'A Short Account of the Twelve Modes of Compositions and their Progressions in every Octave' in a manuscript of 1751 mentioned by W. H. Husk in the first edition of 'Grove's Dictionary of Music' cannot be traced. 
In December 1737 Pepusch was appointed organist of the Charterhouse and moved to an apartment on the grounds. In the same year he offered William Oldys assistance in the preparation of a history of the art of music and its professors in England (Oldys, 15). His increasing interest in the music of the ancients led to his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1745 and the publication of his paper 'Of the various genera and species of music among the ancients' in the 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society' the following year. 
His wife died on 8 August 1746 after which Pepusch increasingly retired from public life. He himself died in his rooms at the Charterhouse on 20 July 1752 and was buried three days later in the chapel there. According to his will, dated 9 July 1752 and proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury on 21 May 1753, his extensive library was to be divided between the Academy of Ancient Music, his colleague in the theatre Ephraim Kellner, and his student John Travers. Through a series of unfortunate circumstances it was scattered by the end of the eighteenth century and only a few pieces can now be identified. Pepusch's own compositions show great technical skill but little musical originality; they are well crafted but dull. His true legacy is to be found in the work of his students, both as composers and practical musicians and as collectors of the 'antient' music he so loved.

Pepwell, Henry (d. 1539/40), printer, was born in Birmingham. His father was probably the John Pepwell of Birmingham who was sued by a mercer in 1520 for a debt on a bond signed in St Sepulchre's parish, London (TNA: PRO, CP 40/1029, rot. 323'v'). From 1518 his business was located at the sign of the Trinity in Paul's Cross Churchyard, London, formerly the house of the stationer Henry Jacobi, whose materials had passed to Pepwell. Jacobi's device, with the surname cut out, first appears on Pepwell's 1519 edition of Stanbridge's 'Accidence'. Pepwell also employed an assistant, Roger Shedmore. Pepwell was warden of the Company of Stationers in 1525-6. 
Sixteen books survive that were printed by or for Pepwell between 1518 and 1539. Two are vernacular works of fiction: William Neville's 'Castell of Pleasure', with additions by Robert Copland, and the 'Boke of the Cyte of Ladyes', Brian Anslay's translation of the work by Christine de Pisan. There is a verse preface by the printer in the latter, describing the patronage of the third earl of Kent, Richard Grey. Pepwell was involved with printing of early English humanist texts, issuing a number of grammar books, including some by John Colet and William Lily for use at St Paul's School in London, and work by Erasmus. The remainder of the books that carry his imprint are legal or religious; they include an edition of Richard of St Victor with extracts from the writings of the English mystic Margery Kempe. Pepwell probably also printed indulgences and images of pity (see 'STC, 1475-1640', 14077c.11c). 
In 1526 Pepwell was among those present when the bishop of London issued his second set of injunctions to the booksellers (Reed, 173-5). In 1531 he commissioned an edition of Eckius's 'Adversus Lutheranos' from the Antwerp printer Michael Hillenius; John Bale states that Pepwell was employed by John Stokesley, bishop of London, to do so. In a letter of August 1533 from Stephen Vaughan to Thomas Cromwell about the recusant cardinal William Peto, Pepwell is identified for questioning about the business of Thomas Dockwray, a fellow stationer who was in Antwerp on behalf of Stokesley. In May 1538 Pepwell was one of six Londoners who each raised 500 marks bail for Stokesley following his arrest by Cromwell for the execution of a papal bull. In 1536 he was one of the syndicate of publishers involved with John Wayland in publishing Hilsey's primer. 
Pepwell is often named in documents relating to the community of stationers at Paul's Cross in his parish of St Faith's. His business was valued at $40 for the 1523-4 lay subsidy for that parish, and he and Dockwray were appointed petty collectors of the king's subsidy in St Faith's in 1536. In 1538 he travelled to St Albans to accompany the monastery printer (probably John Herford) back to London, where the latter was questioned by the stationers William Bonham and Henry Tab on Cromwell's behalf. In September 1539 he was in arrears for his Paul's Cross property; the same document names Tab, Dockwray, Bonham, John Reynes, Thomas Petit, and Polydore Vergil as neighbours. Pepwell had been bequeathed $4 of books by Wynkyn de Worde in 1534 and he and Bonham are named in a fragment of a 1537 or 1539 account book from de Worde's shop, where Pepwell is charged for copies of a (probably 1536) edition of 'Adam Bell', Stanbridge's 'Accidence', and a Latin primer. 
Pepwell died between 11 September 1539, when he made his will, and 8 February 1540, when it was proved by his widow, Ursula, his sole executor. This may or may not be the daughter of Paul Alexander mentioned as Pepwell's wife in a complaint to chancery of 1531/2 (TNA: PRO, C 1/608/29, C 1/609/39). He left instructions to be buried in the Pardon churchyard near St Paul's, and bequeathed a mass book and 5's'. to his old parish church in Birmingham for prayers for his soul; Bonham is named as a supervisor. He divided his property among his widow and his children, none of whom is named in the will. Arthur Pepwell, who is mentioned in the Stationers' Company register after 1554, is probably a descendant.

Pepys, Charles Christopher, first earl of Cottenham (1781-1851), lord chancellor, was born on 29 April 1781 in Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square, London, the second of three sons (another was Henry Pepys) of Sir William Weller Pepys, first baronet (1740-1825), a master in chancery (who was descended from John Pepys, great-grandfather of Samuel), and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1830), eldest daughter of the Rt Hon. William Dowdeswell. 
Pepys was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he did not sit for the tripos but was content to graduate LLB in 1803. Contemporaries remembered him as a short, 'stout, sturdy, thickset boy, of blunt speech and cold disposition, aiming at no distinction, making few friends... None could say that he was clever; some of his schoolfellows pronounced him dull. His dark, searching eyes, massive forehead and expressive lips, refuted the charge.' He never lost his 'air of independence and determination which indicated an inward consciousness of superiority' (Le Marchant, 59-60). 
Pepys was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 26 January 1801 and was called to the bar on 23 November 1804, the same day as the future Viscount Melbourne. In 1837 he became treasurer of his inn. Like many of his distinguished contemporaries, he was a pupil of the famous special pleader, William Tidd. His fellow pupil, John Campbell, later Lord Campbell, described him as 'the greatest ornament of our [Tidd's] Bar' ('Life of John, Lord Campbell', 1.138). He decided to practise at the emerging chancery bar (he was among the first generation of chancery lawyers who did not go circuit), so, having taken chambers in 16 Old Square, Lincoln's Inn, he began his study of equity with Sir Samuel Romilly. The fact that his father was a master in chancery must have helped his practice. Within five years of his call, his father wrote to Hannah More: 'The success of my second son at the Chancery Bar has been most rapid, and highly gratifying to me' (Gaussen, 2.295). His professional success came from his total dedication to his equity practice and his disdain for society; in later life his only recreation was foreign travel. A chancery advocate did not have to be an Erskine or a Scarlett. Pepys had a clear mind, reasoned cogently, was rarely repetitious, and 'never forgot that he was addressing a single judge and that judge a professional man' ('Law Review', 14, 1853, 354). 
Pepys's practice at the bar prospered, enabling him on 30 June 1821 to marry Caroline Elizabeth (1802-1868), the second daughter of William Wingfield KC, then chief justice of the Brecon circuit, and to become another master in chancery. On 24 August 1826 he received his silk gown from Lord Lyndhurst and became a bencher of his inn in November that year. Four years later he was appointed solicitor-general to Queen Adelaide, retaining that post until May 1832. 
Whiggism was in Pepys's blood; his maternal grandfather had been the chancellor of the exchequer in the Rockingham administration in 1765. Though he had shown little political ambition, in July 1831 he entered the House of Commons as the member for Higham Ferrers, a seat which he exchanged the following September for Lord Fitzwilliam's borough of Malton. In the house he rarely spoke, and then on purely legal questions; his first speech, on 31 October 1831, was on the 'Bankruptcy Bill'. The whigs had a paucity of lawyers in the house, and their predicament became acute when Sir William Horne, who had become attorney-general on Sir Thomas Denman's appointment as lord chief justice in November 1832, proved to be a disastrous choice. In 1834 he was pushed out of office. Campbell succeeded him and, to the surprise of the profession, Pepys became solicitor-general on 22 February 1834, receiving the customary knighthood. As solicitor-general Pepys was not active in the house. He piloted the bill to establish the central criminal court and spoke in favour of the new 'Poor Law Bill'. But he had no taste for debate and his most successful intervention was his speech moving the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the law of libel. 
In September 1834 the master of the rolls, Sir John Leach, suddenly died. Campbell, to his mortification, was passed over in favour of Pepys who, at the instigation of Brougham (whom Pepys had impressed), became master of the rolls on 29 September and a privy councillor a few days later. Brougham wrote that Pepys's elevation 'was his own best title to the gratitude of the profession' (Brougham, 3.430). 
The whigs returned to office in April 1835. The prime minister, Melbourne, resolved that Brougham should never again be his lord chancellor. The great seal was put into commission while the cabinet wrangled over an alternative to Brougham. The contest was between Henry Bickersteth and Pepys. On 17 January 1836 Pepys became lord chancellor of England, taking the title Baron Cottenham of Cottenham in the county of Cambridge. Greville described the promotion of this 'plain undistinguished man' as 'one of the most curious instances of elevation that ever occurred' ('Greville Memoirs', 3.328). Pemberton Leigh, later Lord Kingsdown, recorded the comment that: 'Melbourne must have felt very much like a man who had parted with a brilliant capricious mistress and married his housekeeper' (Leigh, 'Recollections', 112; 'Edinburgh Review', 60). In 1841 the whigs were turned out of office. On their return in 1846 Cottenham became lord chancellor for the second time, again succeeding Lyndhurst. 
Cottenham was unashamedly a party man, whose preference for whigs in his patronage appointments to the commissions of the peace and to the trusteeships of municipal charities infuriated the tories. But he failed his party in the Lords, as he had done in the Commons. A feeble debater, he was no match for Lyndhurst or Brougham. But Atlay thought that he 'was a much more useful member of the Cabinet than was generally suspected' (Atlay, 1.404), a judgement which Lord John Russell appeared to endorse, describing him as 'a direct man and a straightforward statesman' (Russell, 276). 
On 28 April 1836 Cottenham introduced a bill for dividing and distributing the duties performed by the lord chancellor. The bill left the jurisdiction and procedure of the court of chancery untouched, although the equity business of the court of exchequer was transferred to it. Its head was to be a permanent judge, the lord chief justice of the court of chancery, who was to devote himself solely to judicial business. The office of lord chancellor was to remain. Its holder would keep the great seal and its traditional patronage, and preside over the House of Lords and the hearing of appeals to the House of Lords and the privy council. 
It was predictable that the bill would be opposed by Lyndhurst, who depicted Cottenham's chancellor as a lawyer without a court. More disconcerting was the opposition of Bickersteth, now Lord Langdale and Cottenham's successor as master of the rolls, who strongly disapproved of its main provisions. Cottenham's defence of the bill was, in Campbell's words, 'tame, confused, and dissuasive' ('Life of John, Lord Campbell', 2.82). The bill was handsomely defeated and with its defeat died any further attempt by Cottenham radically to reform the court of chancery. 
The fifty-one new orders in chancery in 1841, although making detailed reforms, were quite inadequate attempts to remedy the defects of equity procedure. Equally unsuccessful was Cottenham's attempt to implement the recommendations of the commission of inquiry into the bankruptcy and insolvency laws. But he did have some minor successes. For example, in 1838 he secured the enactment of a statute abolishing imprisonment for debt on mesne process; thereafter a person could not be arrested on the mere affidavit of another that he was owed $20. In 1841 the statute which had prohibited the clergy from all dealings in trade was repealed; the earlier statute had been interpreted to mean that if a clergyman was a shareholder in a joint-stock company, the company was an illegal association and could not recover moneys due to it. And an act of 1847 enabled trustees who wished to be relieved of the responsibility of administering the trust to pay trust money into court. 
Cottenham will not be remembered as a politician or as a law reformer. But as a judge he earned the praise, though not the love, of his contemporaries. Kingsdown said that he was 'one of the best judges I ever saw on the Bench' (Atlay, 1.402). Cottenham did not have Lyndhurst's brilliance of mind but his knowledge of equity was more profound. Among his decisions are 'Tulk v. Moxhay' (1848), the corner-stone of the law of restrictive covenants, and 'Saunders v. Vautier' (1841), which holds that all the beneficiaries of a trust, if of full age, may, if they so decide, determine the trust. The growth of the joint-stock company led to much litigation. Cottenham's decisions laid the foundations of modern company law. Prominent among them is 'Foss v. Harbottle' (1843), which established that only the company, and not individual shareholders, can seek redress for the illegal acts of its directors. 
Cottenham's judgments, which were meticulously prepared, are a model of what judgments should be. According to Le Marchant: 'The style of them, like the character of the man, was perfectly free from all affectation and display; whether written or spoken, they were always simple, terse and perspicuous; clear and condensed in their summary of the facts, and in their exposition of law, comprehensive and vigorous, but at the same time, cautious and precise. (Le Marchant, 64)' Cottenham, unlike Eldon, made up his mind quickly and once made it was a Herculean task to persuade him to change it. 'His demeanour in Court was not without a certain dignity, but its prominent feature was an austerity, amounting sometimes to harshness, which maintained his authority rather than conciliated esteem' (ibid., 64). Impatient of empty and repetitious rhetoric, he listened patiently to cogent argument, rarely interrupting 'except for the purpose of bringing it to an issue, by showing that he had detected its weak point' (ibid., 65). However, during his second chancellorship he became increasingly inaudible, irritable, and intolerant. 
Cottenham's relationship with his judicial colleagues was an uneasy one. Langdale's attack on his attempt to reform the court of chancery made a cool relationship even cooler. His dislike of the vice-chancellor, Sir James Knight Bruce, was long-standing. According to Lord Selborne, its source was their rivalry in Vice-Chancellor Shadwell's court, 'when that great lawyer, plain and dull of speech, had to endure what he regarded as daily affronts from his eloquent competitor' (Palmer, 1.375). Cottenham would not permit any deviation from the traditional practice of the court, even upholding one of the greater abuses of the master's office, 'hourly warrants', by which a fresh fee was payable every hour. In contrast, Knight Bruce was of a very different temper and had been allowed by an indulgent Lyndhurst to take procedural short cuts, freely granting amendments at the hearing of a cause. This practice infuriated Cottenham, who considered 'the system which he [had] to administer as the perfection of human wisdom' ('Life of John, Lord Campbell', 2.207), and led to many bitter exchanges at the expense of hapless litigants. Knight Bruce was convinced that Cottenham approached his judgments with 'a disposition to reverse them' (Palmer, 1.375). Cottenham was on no better terms with the other vice-chancellor, Sir James Wigram. 
To his contemporaries Cottenham was a man conscious of his dignity, touchy, aloof, self-centred. But he was a loving husband and devoted to his fifteen children, twelve of whom survived him. Unlike his father he had no interest in literature. His conversation with his few intimates, 'often enlivened by a vein of dry humour', was 'on the topics of the day' (Le Marchant, 67). Cottenham cared little for society. He was a private man. 
During his second chancellorship, which began in 1846 and lasted almost four years, Cottenham's powers deteriorated. The burdens of office, combined with his conscientious devotion to his judicial duties, led to longer and longer delays in giving judgments, standing important cases over to the long vacation, and issuing 'directions for enquiries' to the masters for further investigation of the facts. The arrears of the court built up. In November 1847 Cottenham broke a blood-vessel in his throat, and was thought to be dying. But in the new year he was back in the house and in court, though seldom appearing in the cabinet. A personal attack by a disgruntled attorney, William Dimes, clouded his last years. Dimes had unsuccessfully brought suit against the Grand Junction Canal and had been committed by Cottenham for contempt for breach of an injunction. Dimes was a determined man and in 1849 brought an action to set aside Cottenham's judgment on the ground that Cottenham, a shareholder in the company, had an interest in the outcome of the proceedings. In June 1852 the House of Lords upheld that claim. 
In the year following Dimes's action Cottenham was absent from court more frequently. On 27 May 1850 he abruptly resigned, to be granted in the following month the titles of Viscount Crowhurst and earl of Cottenham; in 1845 and 1849 he had succeeded to the baronetcies held by his older brother and uncle. He was advised to winter abroad and, in the spring of 1851, felt well enough to return home from Malta. But in Pietra Santa, near Lucca, in Italy, he was taken ill; he died on his seventieth birthday, 29 April 1851, and was buried in Totteridge in Hertfordshire.

Pepys, Henry (1783-1860), bishop of Worcester, was born in Wimpole Street, London, on 18 April 1783. He was the third son of Sir William Weller Pepys and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Dowdeswell. Charles Christopher Pepys, earl of Cottenham, was his brother. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1800 and graduating BA in 1804; he then migrated as a fellow to St John's College, Cambridge, and proceeded MA in 1807, BD in 1814, and DD in 1840. 
Pepys was ordained priest in 1808 and was curate of Swaffham Prior from 1808. He was rector of Aspeden, Hertfordshire, from 12 June 1818 to 28 April 1827, and held with it the college living of Moreton, Essex, from 16 August 1822 until 1840. On 3 February 1826 he was appointed a prebendary of Wells, and on 31 March 1827 rector of Westmill, Hertfordshire. In politics he was a Liberal. On 27 January 1840 he was, on Lord Melbourne's recommendation, elevated to the bishopric of Sodor and Man; he was consecrated at Whitehall on 1 March, arrived at Douglas, Isle of Man, on 27 April, was installed at St Mary's, Castleton, on 8 May 1840, and left the island on 4 May 1841, on his translation -- also by the whig government -- to the see of Worcester. 
In the House of Lords, although Pepys voted in favour of the chief Liberal measures, he spoke only twice, on ecclesiastical questions of small importance. He was one of the bishops who assisted at the controversial consecration of R. D. Hampden in 1847, and he publicly attacked the high-church bishop Henry Phillpotts. Personally Pepys was popular, and was conscientious in the discharge of his diocesan duties. He was a generous patron of the triennial festival of the Three Choirs. 
Pepys married, on 27 January 1824, Maria, third daughter of the Rt Hon. John Sullivan, commissioner of the Board of Control. They had four children: Philip Henry, registrar of the London court of bankruptcy; Herbert George, honorary canon of Worcester; Maria Louisa, who married the Revd Edward Winnington Ingram; and Emily, who married the Revd William Henry Lyttelton, and died on 12 September 1877. 
Pepys published 'The Remains of the Late Lord Viscount Royston, with a Memoir of his Life' (1838), six charges, and two sermons. He died at Hartlebury Castle, Stourport, Worcestershire, on 13 November 1860. He was survived by his wife, who died aged eighty-nine, on 17 June 1885.

Pepys, Sir Lucas, first baronet (1742-1830), physician, son of William Pepys ('bap'. 1698, died 1743), a banker, and his wife Hannah (died 1761), daughter of Dr Richard Russell of Brighton and widow of Alexander Weller, was born in London on 24 May 1742 and baptized at St Mary Woolnoth on 8 June. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 9 May 1764. He then studied medicine at Edinburgh in 1765, and afterwards graduated at Oxford, MA on 13 May 1767, MB on 30 April 1770, and MD on 14 June 1774. Before his MB degree he obtained a licence to practise from the University of Oxford, took a house in London, and on 10 February 1769 was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital, where he held office for seven years. In the summer months he practised in Brighton. On 30 October 1772 he married Jane Elizabeth Leslie (died 1810), the widowed countess of Rothes, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. 
Pepys was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1775, was censor in 1777, 1782, 1786, and 1796, treasurer from 1788 to 1798, and president from 1804 to 1810. In 1777 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to the king, and in 1792 physician-in-ordinary. He was created a baronet on 22 January 1784. 
Pepys attended George III during his illness of 1788-9, and in that of 1804. He was examined on the subject of the king's health by a committee of the House of Commons on 7 January 1789. He then thought it likely that the king would recover in time, and stated that he had observed signs of improvement. He attended two days a week at Kew, where the king was, from four in the afternoon until eleven the next morning, having a consultation often with either Sir George Baker or Richard Warren. 
In 1794 Pepys was made physician-general to the army, and was president of an army medical board, on which it was his duty to nominate all the army physicians. When so many soldiers fell ill of fever at Walcheren, he was ordered to go there and report. When he declined, the board was abolished; but he was granted a pension. Pepys had a large practice, and became an active supporter of the National Vaccine Institution. He was punctual and assiduous as president of the College of Physicians. His only published work was the Latin preface to the 'London Pharmacopoeia' of 1809. 
After the death of his first wife in 1810, Pepys married Deborah (died 1848), daughter of Dr Anthony Askew, on 29 June 1813. His house was in Park Street, Grosvenor Square, London, where he died on 17 June 1830. He was described by William Munk, as 'a person of great firmness and determination, somewhat dictatorial in his manner'.

Pepys, Richard (c.1588-1659), judge, was born at Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, the second son of John Pepys (died 1604) of the Middle Temple and of Impington, near Cottenham, and Elizabeth (died 1642), daughter of John Bendish of Bower Hall, Bumpstead, Essex. Pepys joined the Middle Temple in 1609 and was called to the bar in 1617. He subsequently sat in the Short Parliament (March-May 1640) as member for Sudbury, Suffolk. In 1642 he was left heir to the estate of his elder brother, John, and in 1643-4 was elected treasurer of the Middle Temple, having previously served there as reader in 1640. In January 1654 he was appointed serjeant-at-law, and was immediately afterwards a member of the commission for the spring circuit through the midland counties. On 30 May in the same year he was appointed baron of the exchequer, in spite of scruples as to the protector's legal authority. In August, Pepys, by then over sixty, accepted appointment to Ireland, 'attracted (it seems) by the chance of improving his fortune' (Barnard, 284), though the move at his age could be viewed as foolhardy rather than wise. Made at the outset a member of the Irish lord deputy's council, he served under both Charles Fleetwood and Henry Cromwell and thus learned at first hand of the manner in which the council's work suffered from the 'lamentable rubbs and interruptions' of which Cromwell was to make complaint. When, in September 1657, Cromwell wrote privately to Secretary Thurloe on the subject of filling future vacancies on the Irish council, his list of qualifications was very likely based on his own assessment of Pepys's worth: councillors should possess sound judgment, be expert in draftsmanship ('conceiving and wordeing of orders') and prepared to 'take paines to observe and search into matters' (Thurloe, 'State papers', 6.505-6). 
Pepys's principal duties were judicial. Named chief justice of the upper bench in 1654 he was associated with the revival of the Dublin four courts the following year. Until the appointment of William Steele as lord chancellor in August 1656 he was chief commissioner of the Irish great seal and in that capacity presided over a makeshift court which in a test case handed down a decision presaging a return to normality in Ireland's commercial life; he insisted on the payment of interest on debts contracted before 1641. 
Pepys married, first, Judith, a daughter of Sir William Cutte of Arkesden, Essex, and second, Mary (died 1660), daughter of Captain Gosnold. He left four sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Richard, married Mary, daughter of John Scott of Belchamp-Walter, Essex, and, with his wife and daughter, Mary, migrated to New England in 1634, but returned in 1650 and settled at Ashen Clare, Essex. A number of Pepys's letters to Richard have been printed (W. C. Pepys, 'Genealogy of the Pepys Family, 1273-1887', 1887). They possess great charm. Richard is urged to be careful about money, advised to decline the office of constable, something 'never before put uppon a judge's son' (Pepys, 60), and warned against false friends: 'Pray have a care to avoyd flattering companions and such as will if they can insinuate into you, pretending with love and intending theire owne advantage' (Pepys, 59). 
Pepys died in Dublin on 2 January 1659. Henry Cromwell, in reporting the news, described Pepys as 'a good councellor,... a good judge, and indeed a right honest man' (Thurloe, 'State papers', 7.590). Edward Worth, in his funeral sermon ('The Servant Doing and the Lord Blessing', 1659), was even more effusive in his praise, drawing attention, in particular, to Pepys's fairness and to the fact that during his period of service in Ireland he did nothing to feather his own nest: 'As a magistrate, he might say with Samuel, 'Whose ox or whose ass have I taken?'' ('1 Samuel', 8: 16). Pepys was buried at Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. He was a cousin once removed of the diarist Samuel Pepys.

Pepys, Samuel (1633-1703), naval official and diarist, was born at the family home, Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, London, on 23 February 1633, the second son of John Pepys (1601-1680), tailor, and his wife, Margaret, 'nee' Kite (died 1667), daughter of a Whitechapel butcher. He was the fifth of their eleven children, and the oldest to survive into adulthood. He was baptized on 3 March in St Bride's Church by James Palmer. Although his immediate background was urban and modest, Pepys's family came from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, and he had landed connections there and in Huntingdonshire. Among these was his father's brother Robert, who owned an estate at Brampton, Huntingdonshire, which Pepys eventually inherited. Of more immediate importance was the marriage of John Pepys's aunt Paulina to Sir Sydney Montagu of Hinchingbrooke; their son Edward Mountagu (later earl of Sandwich), who was to have a large place in the Commonweath regime and a larger one in its overthrow, was the agent for Pepys's advancement into public service. 
Pepys's childhood was only partially spent under his parents' roof. For a time he and his next brother, Tom, were sent to a nurse, Goody Lawrence, at Kingsland in the country just north of London. About 1644 he was living with his Huntingdonshire relations (probably at Brampton), because for a while he attended Huntingdon grammar school. He came away with an admiration for the school's favourite son, Oliver Cromwell, which he did not abandon despite his loyalty to the restored monarchy. His schooling was completed at St Paul's under its formidable high master John Langley. Pepys warmed more to the surmaster, Samuel Cromleholme, and was pained to see him degenerate into a comic drunk. From his schooldays Pepys kept a volume of Xenophon which he solemnly inscribed in Greek with his name and the date 1649 -- the year in which he was an approving spectator at the execution of Charles I. 
St Paul's gave Pepys a leaving exhibition in 1650, and on 21 June he entered his name at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where his uncle John Pepys LLD was a fellow. Several members of the family had distinguished themselves in the law, and Samuel seemed to be headed in the same direction. But it was at Magdalene that he was admitted a sizar on 1 October, and where he took up residence on 5 March 1651. On 3 April he was advanced to a scholarship on the foundation of John Spendluffe. Perhaps an invitation came from the new master, John Sadler, a neighbour of the Pepyses in Salisbury Court; another influence may have been Samuel Morland, who became Pepys's tutor, and who knew the Montagus. Whatever the circumstances, it was a move which Pepys and the college only once had occasion to regret (when he was reprimanded for drunkenness in hall on the night of 20 October 1653). Pepys retained fond memories of the college beer and he also made many lasting friendships. In the first year he kept with Robert Sawyer, a third-year man and a future attorney-general. Richard Cumberland, later bishop of Peterborough, had been a contemporary of Pepys at St Paul's, but it was at Magdalene that they became close friends. On 4 October 1653 Pepys was elected to a Smith scholarship. He took his BA in March 1654, recording his new status in a book of cabalistic hokum which had taken his fancy. After he left Cambridge Pepys regularly visited his old college; he proceeded MA on 26 June 1660. 
Soon after coming down Pepys was found employment in the London household of Edward Mountagu, now a councillor of state in Cromwell's protectorate. Pepys's duties were at first trivial, but as Mountagu's professional and family life took him increasingly away from London, he became effectively his master's secretary. Nevertheless he was scarcely well enough placed to marry, which at the end of 1655, when still living in one room of Mountagu's Whitehall lodgings, he did. He had fallen in love with Elizabeth ['see 'Pepys, Elizabeth (1640-1669)], the fourteen-year-old daughter of Alexandre St Michel, an impoverished Frenchman who had briefly been gentleman carver to Henrietta Maria. Elizabeth brought the awkward legacy of a convent education, and a negative dowry of mendicant relatives, most notably her brother Balthasar (Balty). The marriage in St Margaret's, Westminster, on 1 December 1655 was a civil ceremony; they celebrated their anniversary on 10 October, probably the date of a preceding wedding according to prayer-book liturgy, which Pepys attended when he could. Before that anniversary had come for a second time, Pepys and Elizabeth had spent some time apart. This first crisis in their marriage was resolved; others would follow, but although childless they remained together until Elizabeth's death. On 26 March 1658 Pepys, who had long been in acute pain from a kidney stone, underwent a potentially lethal operation for its removal. The immediate problem was cured, but Pepys continued to suffer from genito-urinary disorders, which may have prevented him from fathering children. By the end of August that year the Pepyses had moved into a house of their own, in Axe Yard, close to the present Downing Street. Coincidentally at about the same time (before Cromwell died in September), Pepys acquired a part-time place as teller in the exchequer under George Downing, after whom the street would be named. For Pepys it was a first foothold in the public domain, but he continued to serve his original master. Mountagu was now a general-at-sea; in May 1659 Pepys took dispatches to him in the Baltic, and so unwittingly began his own thirty years of service to the navy. 
It was certainly with some sense that his own life, as well as the nation's history, was at a pivotal point, that on 1 January 1660 Pepys began the diary which has made him famous. He opens with a self-conscious summary of his domestic circumstances and the political background; thereafter his writing takes on the structures and rhythms which are sustained for the nine and a half years which the diary fills. He had kept no previous journal, though his dispatches to Mountagu may have been his apprenticeship in reporting. A 'Romance' written at Cambridge (and destroyed along with other juvenilia in 1664) was the only previous literary effort he recalled (Pepys, 'Diary', 5.31). The extant manuscript of the diary is a fair copy, written up (in shorthand) every few days from a scribbled draft, collated with other private papers or printed sources to hand. Pepys undoubtedly improved on his text in this process, though without compromising the authenticity of the daily record. The result is properly acclaimed as an astonishingly vivid and disciplined exercise in self-analysis, a historical document of the first rank, and a literary classic. The diary is naturally the single most important source of knowledge about Pepys himself and his relationships, and his public reputation derives largely from the image he projects of himself during the diary years, 1660-69. As it happened these were all the years that remained of his married life, and the period in which his professional apprenticeship was completed. 
Pepys had a rival for Sandwich's chief favour, John Creed, a man who shared many of Pepys's enthusiasms and with whom he maintained an uneasy friendship. Creed seemed more intellectually gifted, and had a larger social competence; but Pepys was the harder worker, and this was decisive. On 6 March Mountagu, who had been secretly negotiating for the return of Charles II, asked Pepys to go to sea with him as secretary. After a few days' thought Pepys accepted, and on 23 March, having put Elizabeth in a boarding house and bought some new clothes, he boarded the 'Swiftsure'. With Mountagu he transferred to the 'Naseby' when the fleet sailed to the Netherlands to bring back the king. Pepys contrived a place in the key documents of the Restoration by appending his counter-signature to the printed text of the king's declaration issued from Breda on 14 April. When the king came aboard the fleet on 23 May, Pepys heard him talk of his wartime escape; on the following day he was addressed by name by the duke of York. 
Back home, Mountagu received the earldom of Sandwich and the Garter, and (on 2 June) promised Pepys that they would 'rise together' and he would in the mean time do him 'all the good Jobbs' he could (Pepys, 'Diary', 1.167). This pledge was promptly honoured with the post of clerk of the acts at the Navy Board, first mentioned by Sandwich on 18 June, and secured for Pepys by patent on 13 July. The board, which controlled most of the material needs and manpower of the navy, was reconstituted at the Restoration, and Pepys was obliged to settle a pension on his pre-war predecessor. The clerk was secretary to the board, with a salary of $350, the prospect of much larger income from gratuities, and an official house. Pepys sensibly rejected an offered $1000 buy-out from another suitor, and moved from Westminster to the much larger accommodation in Seething Lane, where he entertained his friends for the first time on 18 July. He had resigned his post in the exchequer in 28 June, but on 23 July he was sworn in as a clerk of the privy seal, an extra little 'Jobb' Sandwich had found for him; this he relinquished two years later. On 24 September Pepys was sworn in as 'ex officio' justice of the peace for Middlesex, Kent, Essex, and Hampshire (the counties where the royal dockyards lay). 
Pepys took up these responsibilities with only such knowledge of naval affairs as he had gathered from his two voyages in Mountagu's service; his principal colleagues at the Navy Board were men of incomparably greater experience: Sir George Carteret, the treasurer, who had held Jersey for the king; Sir John Mennes, the comptroller (from 1661), an unswerving servant of the crown on land and sea since the days of James I; Sir William Batten, the surveyor, whose loyalties had rather notably swerved during the civil war but whose seaworthiness was undoubted; and Sir William Penn, one of the heroes of the First Anglo-Dutch War and the conqueror of Jamaica. Carteret and Mennes had been 'gentlemen' captains, while Batten and Penn represented the alternative brand of 'tarpaulins', whose claim to naval command was based on experience rather than heredity and court connection. Pepys, who was neither a gentleman nor a tarpaulin, entered office with due deference to both sorts. He soon formed a prejudice (borrowed from Sandwich) against the 'gentlemen', and paradoxically perpetuated the notion of a division in the officer structure which in fact became blurred, not a little by his own efforts. Having been made welcome by his older colleagues, within a short time he came to despise most of them for what he considered their inefficiency and corruption. Batten, Penn, and Mennes would be the particular targets of venomous epithets which Pepys's most sympathetic biographers have found difficult to square with his pervading geniality. It is perfectly true that Mennes and the 'Sir Williams' were not well suited to the chores of bookkeeping and accountancy in which Pepys delighted, and he was soon able to outsmart them in points of detail. He made it his business very quickly to learn the multifaceted work which had fallen his way. He engaged a tutor to improve the arithmetic he needed to follow the international finance on which the naval supplies depended. He made himself expert in the weights and measures of the goods themselves, talking to dockyard storekeepers, carpenters, and boatswains, getting to know all the wonderful wheezes and scams which could turn the king's shilling into a pretty penny. All this he carefully noted in a series of interrelating records, of which his personal diary was one. A contract with Sir William Warren for $3000-worth of Norway masts (concluded 3 September 1663), which Pepys had single-handedly negotiated, was the point at which he effectively outran his seniors at the board. Of these only Carteret and William Coventry, who sat without portfolio, retained his respect. But Coventry, who was also the duke of York's secretary, was hostile to Sandwich; an awkwardness for Pepys, who feared (wrongly, as it happens) that his own position would be threatened if his original patron lost favour at court. 
While Pepys was mastering his core career, his concerns and contacts helpfully proliferated. In 1661 Robert Pepys had died, leaving a life interest in the Brampton estate to Pepys's father, who retired there; but Pepys himself had the reversionary interest and from now on managed the property. On 15 February 1662 he was admitted a younger brother of Trinity House, and on 30 April he received the freedom of Portsmouth. In August Sandwich nominated him for the committee which had been set up to run Tangier, a part of Queen Catherine's dowry. The financing of the garrison rapidly became a muddle, for which the solution was to appoint Pepys as treasurer (20 March 1665). He had been appointed to the commission of the royal fishery by its charter of 8 April 1664. On 21 February 1665 he was elected FRS; while never more than an interested observer, he became known in learned circles. The Second Anglo-Dutch War which began in the following week had been dreaded by Pepys, and it could indeed have brought his ruin; in fact it was his maturing. With Penn at sea, Batten dying, and Mennes never much help, the work of supplying the fleet at war lay almost wholly with Pepys; he had become, as the duke of Albemarle told him in April 1665, 'the right hand of the Navy here' (that is, ashore), nobody else 'taking any care of anything' (Pepys, 'Diary', 6.89). At the outset of the war Pepys recommended a centralized victualling structure; his proposal was accepted and he was himself appointed surveyor-general of victualling, with a salary of $300 a year, on 27 October 1665. He adroitly disengaged himself from the scandal over prize-goods which disgraced Sandwich at the end of the year. 
During the first months of the great plague which came in that same first year of the war, Pepys remained in London. On 18 August, following an order from the king, he and his staff were evacuated to Greenwich; Elizabeth was sent to the relative safety of Woolwich. During the great fire of September 1666, the first news of which he brought personally to the king, he evacuated what he could of his possessions (including the precious diary) to the country; in fact his house was saved. From its reporting of these two disasters to the metropolis in which he thrived, Pepys's diary has become a national monument. By 1667 the government had decided to abandon an unprofitable war, and Pepys approvingly helped to discharge the fleet. Now that the English would not meet them on the high seas, the Dutch became a threat to the mainland. Although Pepys and his colleagues recognized this well enough -- 'all our care now being to fortify ourselfs against their invading us' (Pepys, 'Diary', 8.115) -- the defences in the Medway proved inadequate against the superb seamanship of the Dutch. Early on 12 June Pepys recorded Albemarle's assurance that 'all is safe... the boom and Chaine being so fortified' (ibid., 8.260-61); but within hours he heard that the chain had been breached at Gillingham, and that the 'Royal Charles' had been towed away. 
Pepys's immediate concern had been to get his wife, his father, and as much he could withdraw in gold coin, out of London. For as long as the Dutch remained in the river, he was virtually on active service. But it was already plain that the Navy Board, and its right-hand man, would face a formidable investigation unless the lynch mob got them first. Pepys came well enough through the first examination, held before a committee of the privy council on 19 June. As always he was armed with his files and letter-books, from which he could evidence the proper dispatch of orders and 'materiel'. He sensed that the resident commissioner of Chatham, Peter Pett, was being targeted for blame, and was quick to follow the pack. Once the war ended in August, wider inquiries into its conduct were ordered by parliament. On 17 October the Commons appointed a committee of 'miscarriages'. The first Pepys heard from them (20 October) was a request for lists of ships and commanders at the time of the controversial division of the fleet in 1666; he was glad that they were 'after that business' (Pepys, 'Diary', 8.489): operational foul-ups were not the Navy Board's responsibility. So the news that the committee was much concerned with allegations of cowardice after the battle of Lowestoft was also welcome; indeed, the issue conveniently embarrassed Penn as commander without reflecting on him and his colleagues as commissioners. The board did face questioning on the Medway disaster, but from their first appearance (25 October) they insisted that 'Commissioner Pett was singly concerned in the executing of all orders at Chatham' (ibid., 8.501), and this convenient fudge was accepted by the committee when it reported in February 1668. Their one major criticism of the board was over the payment of seamen by tickets, promissory notes which could be cashed only at the navy treasury in London. The system was certainly bad, but it was not (as the parliamentarians suspected) a massive fraud run by the navy officers. The technicalities were explained and justified by Pepys in a lengthy speech at the bar of the Commons on 5 March. It was a virtuoso performance, capped by the personal congratulations of the king and the duke as they walked in the park next day. 
However, another and more powerful tribunal, the commissioners of accounts, had already set to work in the premises at Brooke House, Holborn, from which they took their name. They asked much more searchingly about how the parliamentary vote for the war had been spent, and that took the investigation to the centre of Pepys's domain. For almost two years the commission gathered evidence, issuing occasional reports. 
Pepys's anxieties were interwoven with domestic crises. His sexual misconduct, so relentlessly chronicled in the diary, touched its lowest point in October 1668 when Elizabeth found him indecently engaged with her maid. The resulting quarrel was contained chiefly by the mediation of Pepys's clerk and lifelong friend, Will Hewer. By the middle of the following year Pepys's eyesight had become so poor that he feared imminent blindness; and with this terrible expectation ('almost as much as to see myself go into my grave') he ended his diary on 31 May 1669, never to resume it (Pepys, 'Diary', 9.565). He had asked for three or four months' leave, which the king personally allowed. His eyesight improved, and so did his relations with Elizabeth; in June they went for a prolonged holiday in the Low Countries and France. Pepys was given a heavy sightseeing schedule by John Evelyn, who was becoming a good friend. They returned on 20 October, but Elizabeth developed a fever (perhaps typhoid) and died on 10 November. 
Pepys had been unable to campaign personally for the Commons seat of Aldeburgh, sought for him by the duke of York and the local magnate, the duke of Norfolk's heir; the burghers were not minded to have an absentee and allegedly papist member foisted on them, and Pepys lost the election. Meanwhile the Brooke House commissioners had submitted eighteen 'Observations' on the conduct of the Navy Board during the war. By 27 November Pepys had completed a weighty response to each observation, which he followed on 6 January 1670 with a 'particular defence' of his own role. The issues were debated in a series of special meetings of the privy council chaired by the king, who had smartly manoeuvred the inquiry into a forum he could control (3 January-21 February). Pepys kept a journal which is the main record of these proceedings, in which he appears to confound his critics in every particular. Maybe it was not quite as easy as Pepys's carefully structured narrative suggests, and more than once the king helped him along. When the eighteenth observation had been disposed of, a final attempt was made to catch Pepys out by producing a seaman's ticket payable in his name. Pepys flatly denied receiving the sum stated, and the king dismissed the idea that 'one having so great trust... should descend to so poor a thing... in a matter of 7'l'. 10's'.' (Latham, 'Pepys and the Second Dutch War', 431). In the end Brooke House proved to be a mare's nest, and Pepys emerged secure. 
At about this time Pepys formed what became an enduring relationship with Mary, daughter of Daniel Skinner, a Mark Lane merchant whose business failed. Mary had been brought up by her aunt Elizabeth, wife of Sir Francis Boteler of Hatfield Woodhall, Hertfordshire, from whom in 1681 she received a handsome legacy. Although at first she maintained a separate establishment, she later became the accepted lady of Pepys's house. Why he did not make her his wife cannot be said; perhaps it was because her brother Daniel assisted Milton, and the family was therefore tainted with republicanism. She was nevertheless sometimes accorded the style of Mrs Pepys. How faithful Pepys may have been to her is impossible to say. Since he was never denounced for immorality by his political opponents, it may be supposed that any additional passions were as furtively and fleetingly satisfied as those of the diary era. 
'Music and women', Pepys had written in 1666, 'I cannot but give way to, whatever my business is' (Pepys, 'Diary', 7.69-70). His delight in music abounds in the pages of the diary, and is also evidenced by books and manuscripts he collected. It even surfaced in his public career, in making a point to a fellow 'understander of music' at the Brooke House hearings (Latham, 'Pepys and the Second Dutch War', 369). The diary gives valuable information about the reintroduction of Anglican church music at the Restoration, and the general development of musical culture in Charles II's London. Pepys knew many of the court and other professional musicians of the capital, and was competent enough to share in their impromptu music-making. He had evidently just mastered sight-reading in January 1660, and subsequently had lessons to improve his technique. He sang at home, in coffee houses, and on one occasion as a deputy lay-vicar of Westminster Abbey. He could manage the lute (having his instrument upgraded as a theorbo in 1661), the viol, and the violin. In 1667 he acquired a flageolet and in the following year a recorder and a spinet. In learning to play these newly acquired instruments he was hampered by lack of knowledge of the gamut. It was only when, from 1673, he was able to employ a domestic musician (Cesare Morelli), that Pepys was provided with tablatures he could follow. Technical deficiency also impeded his aspirations to compose. He could sketch a melody well enough, but required professional help to supply the harmonization. When one of his distinguished teachers, William Child, was about to take the Oxford doctorate of music, Pepys had 'a great mind' to do the same (Pepys, 'Diary', 4.199); but the degree required an expertise which Pepys would never approach. 
The theatre was Pepys's other great love. He had done some acting as a boy and in the 1660s he became an enthusiastic playgoer, though there remained on his conscience a puritan notion that all the stage was a vice. Naturally he enjoyed the spectacle and the social experience of the theatre, but he also had firm views on the linguistic and compositional requirements of a good play. He often found that a piece which read well played disappointingly. Yet on reading 'Othello', which he had admired on the stage, he found the structure much inferior to Samuel Tuke's 'Adventures of Five Houres', 'for the variety and the most excellent continuance of the plot' (Pepys, 'Diary', 4.8). In general he admired Shakespeare's tragedies and histories; his disparaging notices of the comedies ('Midsummer night's dream': 'inspid'; 'Twelfth Night': 'silly'; ibid., 3.208; 4.6) have been smugly cited as evidence of poor judgement, but he probably saw them in adaptations which would horrify a modern audience. 
On 24 January 1672 Pepys was admitted elder brother of Trinity House. War with the Dutch was resumed in March. Sandwich was a casualty at Sole Bay, and Pepys was a banner-bearer at the funeral in Westminster Abbey; they had ceased to be close, and Pepys's career now had its own momentum. In January 1673 a fire which destroyed the Navy Office obliged Pepys to take temporary lodgings in Winchester Lane. When the 'Test Act' compelled the duke of York to resign as lord high admiral the king appointed an Admiralty commission, and by 19 June Pepys was promoted to be its secretary. This meant much more money ($500 per annum and a great deal more in legitimate fees) and enhanced status. However, while still clerk of the acts Pepys had extended his influence outside the strict remit of the Navy Board; his old place there could be shared between his undistinguished younger brother John and his former clerk Tom Hayter, while his own new post rather confirmed him in a larger place he already effectively held. More significant was his move in January 1674 to Derby House, which became the Admiralty's first dedicated premises. Pepys thereby inaugurated an institution which only the matching dynamism of Mountbatten could terminate. The king took a controlling interest in the new Admiralty administration, and the rapport he had established with Pepys during the Brooke House hearings was further developed. The king had helped him win election to the Commons as member for Castle Rising (Norfolk) on 4 November 1673; this time he was able to campaign with his own purse (to near $700). But the support he again received from the duke of York and the Howard interest prompted the opposition to denounce him as a crypto-papist, and to seek to have his election quashed. MPs were told of popish furnishings in Pepys's house; it emerged that the details were fabricated by Shaftesbury, who backed down when he could not substantiate them. In fact Pepys never inclined to Rome, but he courted suspicion by collecting Catholic books and pictures (which, when cornered, he denied) and by attending Catholic services. This activity is now recognized as the result of aesthetic and intellectual curiosity, but coupled with his adherence to the duke it raised in his contemporaries authentic fears, which the opposition were to reactivate. 
For now Pepys kept his seat, but he never became a parliamentarian, having already developed the permanent secretary's disdain for part-time legislators. He regarded his political allies, the tory squires, as blockheads; they found him a painful reminder of the schoolroom. Pepys secretly admired the superior intellect and competence of the opposition; he was not himself really a party man, and he had (in the wider sense) no constituency except the navy. He entered the Commons for professional rather than personal reasons; in 1668 he had formed the 'great design, if I continue in the Navy... to be a Parliament-man' (Pepys, 'Diary', 9.385). He knew well enough that a fine speech from the bar was no substitute for the influence he could exercise from the dispatch box. A navy minister, as already existed in France and the United Provinces, might counteract 'the ignorance of our parliaments in matters marine' and command confidence for the supply on which the service depended ('Samuel Pepys's Naval Minutes', 356). In due course Pepys came to fill that role, and so occupies a significant place in the developing balance between executive and legislature. Nevertheless, during the parliaments of Charles II he sat on few committees, and rarely spoke on non-naval matters. Other institutions claimed him: in February 1676 he was made a governor of Christ's Hospital, and would do much to foster the Royal Mathematical School there as an academy for seamen. On 22 May 1676 he was elected master of Trinity House, and on 8 August 1677 the Clothworkers' Company chose him as its master. 
The years 1676-7 saw the principal achievements of Pepys's first secretaryship. He devised regulations for midshipmen and volunteers (4 May 1676), for men and guns (3 November 1677), and for naval chaplains (15 December 1677). The establishment of an examination for lieutenants (18 December 1677) was central to the professionalization of the officer corps. His political triumph was in persuading the Commons to vote $600,000 over two years for the thirty new ships needed to compete with the French (23 February 1677). When the Cavalier Parliament was dissolved in January 1679 Pepys had no need to risk the expense and uncertainty of a contested election, and was returned for Harwich on the Admiralty ticket. He had already been labelled 'vile' by the opposition, who rightly saw him as the duke of York's continuing agent, and they resolved to destroy him. There was a failed attempt to fit up his clerk Samuel Atkins for the murder of Sir Edmund Bury Godfrey: Pepys efficiently organized the defence, and Atkins was acquitted on 11 February. Pepys's position became precarious when the king was obliged to appoint a new and whig-dominated Admiralty commission on 21 April. A week later a Commons committee on naval miscarriages began to examine 'all enormities' and it was expected that Pepys was to be 'pulled into pieces' ('Ormonde MSS', new ser., 4.507, 509). 
On 20 May Pepys and the shipwright Sir Anthony Deane were charged with leaking naval secrets to the French; Pepys himself was again accused of popery. On the following day he resigned his secretaryship, and on the 22nd he and Deane were sent to the Tower. At once Pepys set his friends to gather evidence establishing his innocence and the unreliability of his accusers: these, it emerged, were his sacked butler, John James, and a footloose trickster, John Scott, whose previous dishonesties Pepys had exposed. In the event Pepys's defence dossier (ruefully called the 'Book of Mornamont' from Scott's imaginary castle) was not needed. Even in the prevailing anti-Catholic hysteria, the prosecution could not construct a case; Pepys and Deane, who had been bailed on 9 July, were eventually discharged on 30 June 1680. 
In October Pepys attended the king at Newmarket, anticipating some reward for past service, if not a chance of future employment. What Charles II gave him was a dictated version of his great escape story (which Pepys took down in shorthand, and intended to publish) and two parts of the illuminated Anthony roll manuscript which had been presented to Henry VIII: magnificent but inedible. Pepys was in fact now unemployed; he had given up his lucrative Tangier post in 1679 and had not stood for re-election to parliament that year. He was surprisingly still nominated to the bench, but for the present he had to live chiefly from his savings. Pepys's father had died in October 1680, and the small Brampton estate was now his. But having made his London house into an official residence he could not return to it; instead he lodged with Hewer at York Buildings, off the Strand. In 1685 he took the tenancy in his own name, and there his library achieved its maturity. In 1681, with his public life seemingly over, he had some hope of being nominated provost of King's College, Cambridge; but (probably correctly) he was doubtful of his credentials, and allowed his candidacy to lapse. He continued to show his face at court when he could, and he was duly invited to sail with the duke of York to Scotland in May 1682. He chose a comfortable cabin in the 'Katherine' yacht rather than a place in the duke's ship the 'Gloucester', thereby avoiding the wreck of the latter in which many died. On reaching his destination he was displeased by the 'universal... rooted nastiness' of the inhabitants, though he was impressed by the beauty of Glasgow ('Letters', ed. Howarth, 139). 
Pepys's return to public service came in the following year when he was sent to Tangier in Lord Dartmouth's fleet. The mission, only disclosed after it left Portsmouth on 9 August, was the evacuation of a colony which had proved unsustainable. Pepys, as Dartmouth's secretary, had particular responsibility for assigning compensation for abandoned property; it was an uncongenial task, but accomplished with his customary efficiency, and giving him a pioneering place in the history of British imperial retreat. His duty done, he and Hewer took a holiday in Spain, reaching Seville on 3 February. Their travels were spoiled by foul weather, but Pepys did manage to collect a chestful of printed Spanish plays and ephemeral literature, now among the rarities of his library. He returned to England in March 1684. During the trip he had kept a journal, which has been called his second diary; it is indeed the most substantial of the various 'ad rem' journals he wrote after 1669, and an important record, but it has little of the charm or the literary merit of the personal diary of 1660-69. For his final service to Tangier Pepys received almost $1000; more important was the reacquaintance it brought him with the navy and many of the personnel. He was confirmed in his view that the service was incompetently directed and negligently officered. 
On 19 May 1684 the king revoked the Admiralty commission of 1679, and for the remaining months of his life he was his own lord high admiral, assisted by the duke of York. On 10 June Pepys was returned to office by letters patent which named him secretary for the affairs of the Admiralty of England, a post created for him and of which he was the only holder. He began at once to take stock, and by the end of the year had presented the king with a detailed denunciation of the previous regime's record. On 1 December he was elected president of the Royal Society, as which he served for two years; in consequence Newton's 'Principia' (1687), published by the society, carries Pepys's imprimatur. Following the accession of James II (6 February 1685) Pepys was confirmed in office; James, like his brother, was king and admiral, and by his own elevation Pepys became clear chief of the naval staff. At the coronation on 23 April he attended as a baron of the Cinque Ports, one of the bearers of the king's canopy. In the general election which followed he was returned for Sandwich and also for Harwich, choosing to sit again for the latter. In this parliament he served on nineteen committees, including some outside his departmental concern. On 30 May he was made deputy lieutenant for Huntingdonshire, and on 14 July was elected for a second term as master of Trinity House. Charles II had lacked opportunity to act on Pepys's recommendations on returning to the Admiralty; the new king, however, was ready to give his old servant free rein, but could do so only because his tory parliament was willing to vote ample supply. By the end of the year Pepys had (with especial prompting from Deane) concluded that the existing machinery of naval administration was incapable of the necessary reconstruction work. 
On 1 January 1686 Pepys presented to the king a more detailed criticism of those who had run the navy in his absence, their dereliction of duty and the waste of 'materiel' which had resulted. There is no doubt that here, and in his subsequent 'Memoires of the Royal Navy', he flagrantly misused statistics to besmirch his predecessors. He contrasted the strength of the fleet when he had left with that he had found on his return, without explaining that in 1679 ships were in pay which had been sent out to fight the French, whereas in 1684 a smaller fleet of less heavily armed ships was appropriate for the navy's current convoy and policing duties. His aspersions on the indolence and private trading of commanders were veiled criticisms of the king who patronized them. The solution offered in his 'Proposition' of 26 January 1686 was a three-year 'special commission' which would combine the functions of the Admiralty and the Navy Board; James agreed, and the commissioners (who included Deane, Hewer, St Michel, and others, all head-hunted by Pepys) began work on 22 March. The programme of refurbishment was so successful that the commission was prematurely dissolved on 12 October 1688; the threat of a Dutch invasion had additionally spurred its activities. 
Pepys's thoughts on the approaching climacteric are never fully evident. Outwardly he supported James II's regime, and may indeed have believed it was 'very fitt... that the king should be at liberty to dispense with as well as make his own rules' (Magd. Cam., Pepys Library, MS 2860, p. 247), but he must have viewed James's headstrong Catholicizing with personal dismay and professional disdain. The failure of the fleet to repel, or even face, the Dutch when they came was no fault of his; he had sent Lord Dartmouth every resource except wind. James was sitting for a portrait for Pepys when he heard that William of Orange had invaded his kingdom. Pepys was among those who witnessed the king's will at Whitehall on 17 November, and in the afternoon he went with him to Windsor. He chose this moment to ask to be paid for his past services; James wrote him what amounted to a dud blank cheque, which Pepys optimistically filled in for $28,007 2's'. 11/4died In the final days of the reign Pepys arranged for the escape of the queen and the prince of Wales; he had no involvement in the king's confused withdrawal. The provisional government which assembled on 11 December ordered an end to hostilities, and Pepys transmitted this instruction to Dartmouth; he may thereby be said to have signalled the end of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Four days later Pepys attended the junta at Whitehall and advised on procedure for stopping the ports. On 19 December he was sent for by the prince of Orange and asked to stay in post, to which he agreed. At this point it was still possible to accept the prince as head of government without compromising allegiance to the head of state. 
Pepys was confident of securing election for Harwich in the Convention Parliament summoned for 22 January 1689, but at the poll on the 16th he was defeated by the whig candidate. The accession of the Oranges on 13 February was followed by a comprehensive purge of office-holders; it is unlikely that Pepys would have been retained at the Admiralty even if (as was not the case) he had been prepared to swear allegiance to the new rulers. His last office business was done on 22 February, though he dated his resignation two days earlier. This time he managed to keep his house, York Buildings, by the simple tactic of not moving when the incoming Admiralty claimed it as an official residence. From 5 May to 15 June he was, along with Hewer and Deane, detained by a king's messenger on suspicion of treason against the new government. On 25 June 1690, when a French fleet stood menacingly in the channel, Pepys was imprisoned in the Westminster gatehouse; his release on medical grounds was ordered on 14 July. He did in fact suffer a return of his old kidney and eyesight troubles, but these did not impede an active retirement. 
At first Pepys had some thought of ending his days as the country squire he had occasionally affected to be, but he decided he was not yet tired of London. The several institutions in which he was already well established -- the Royal Society, Trinity House, Christ's Hospital, and the Clothworkers' Company -- offered plentiful opportunities for social and intellectual pleasure. Above all he gave his time to his library and to scholarly enquiry. He was already a bibliophile in the diary years. Some books he acquired for their beauty or curiosity, or because they were the right thing to have, but for the most part what he bought he also read. Among contemporary authors Thomas Fuller was his favourite, and of the poets, Chaucer, while in a count of titles Robert Boyle has prime position. Pepys's lifelong enthusiasms for drama and music are well represented. He read French, Spanish, and Italian, and his library reflected this competence. He rarely wrote in his books, and the instances therefore invite attention: he bound Sternhold and Hopkins with Skelton to demonstrate that the metrical psalter compared well with 'the highest... secular poetry of that time' (Magd. Cam., Pepys Library, MS 228). 
In 1666 Pepys had a dockyard joiner, Thomas Simpson, make the first of twelve glass-fronted book presses. Arranging the collection became a great hobby, and in his retirement he was able to employ library assistants, principally the translator Paul Lorrain. The books were shelved and numbered in order of ascending size; cataloguing and indexing the collection therefore became progressively more complex. Disappointingly as it now seems, Pepys often discarded older books as new ones were acquired, or as space in the presses determined. His nephew and eventual heir, John Jackson, helped to bring the collection to its target of 3000 volumes. Jackson was the younger son of Pepys's sister Paulina; the elder nephew, Samuel, all but wrote himself out of Pepys's will, but John proved an appreciative substitute. He was sent to Magdalene, and then to France and Italy -- a trip which Pepys would have liked to make, but could now enjoy only vicariously. In particular Jackson was commissioned to bring back further treasures for the library. 
Pepys's collection became well known, and was sought out by scholars. His manuscripts (then numbering 129) were listed in Edward Bernard's 'Catalogi... Angliae et Hiberniae' (1697), although Pepys had to be persuaded to allow the entry. He corresponded occasionally with some of the greatest men of his day (Newton, Dryden, Sloane), and prolifically with academics such as Humfrey Wanley, Arthur Charlett, and his kinsman Thomas Gale. While he kept in touch with Cambridge and Magdalene, and subscribed to the new building in his old college, most of his learned friends were now at Oxford. One such was the mathematician John Wallis, whose portrait Pepys commissioned from Kneller and gave to the university; in return he received a diploma from the public orator (29 October 1702). Chief among these elevated exchanges was his correspondence with Evelyn, which now literally fills a book. Their association, which had begun at a professional level during the 1660s, had developed into one of warm mutual regard. Evelyn came to represent the ideal gentleman-scholar which the retired Pepys aspired to be. Pepys had long intended to compile a naval history: the idea seems to have begun in 1664, when Coventry suggested he should write an account of the First Anglo-Dutch War. The scale of the proposed work gradually lengthened, and many books and notes were acquired with this distant prospect in view. Enforced leisure from 1679 to 1684 had allowed for further research, Evelyn providing much arcane knowledge from his own store. Pepys's renewed leisure, ample means, and reasonable health during the 1690s seemed likely to generate the great work, but it never came. The 'Memoires' of 1690 were his only publication. The subsequently printed 'Naval Minutes', a commonplace book of matters historical and contemporary, gives some hint of the scope though not the arrangement of Pepys's intended survey. 
In the last years of his life Pepys stayed frequently with Hewer at the grand house he now owned in Clapham. From 1701 he lived there permanently, and it was there that he died on 26 May 1703. On 4 June he was buried at St Olave, Hart Street; the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London were present, but it was one of Pepys's circle, the nonjuring bishop of Thetford, George Hickes, who officiated. 
Pepys left an annuity of $200, together with much plate, pictures, and other possessions, to Mary Skinner, acknowledging her 'steddy friendship and assistances' during the previous thirty-three years (Wheatley, 'Pepysiana', 262). Samuel Jackson received a token annuity of $40. The only property Pepys owned was the Brampton house with its 74 acres. Much of his will concerned investment of the hypothetical $28,007 which he still claimed from the crown, and which he fondly hoped would be settled on his heirs. John Jackson was the residuary legatee, and he inherited the library for his lifetime. Following Pepys's instructions, Jackson completed a few sets of volumes, and finished the catalogue. On Jackson's death in 1724, the collection passed to Magdalene where, as Pepys had stipulated, it was to be kept wholly apart from the college's other books. The convoy of wagons which took the 3000 books and their twelve presses to Cambridge was a sealed train carrying Pepys's reputation to posterity. His name was not forgotten in the navy, where many of his 'establishments' and administrative practices remained in use into Nelson's era and beyond; Barham in particular spoke highly of him. It was known that his library was rich in maritime history and other scholarly matters, but that it might contain more was unsuspected. 
The seemingly impenetrable shorthand of the six volumes marked 'journal' discouraged examination until, it seems, the successful publication of Evelyn's diary (1818) prompted Magdalene to have Pepys's manuscript deciphered. An impecunious undergraduate of neighbouring St John's College, John Smith, was hired, and learned the characters by comparing Pepys's shorthand of Charles II's escape story with the longhand version. He did not know that the manual for the system, Thomas Shelton's 'Tutor to Tachygraphy' (1642), was in the library. A first selection from the revealed text was published in 1825, edited by the third Lord Braybrooke, hereditary visitor of the college. The project was a great success, prompting progressively fuller editions. H. B. Wheatley's edition (1893-9) was complete save for what the 'Dictionary of National Biography' confidently dismissed as 'passages which cannot possibly be printed'. The edition by Robert Latham and William Matthews (1970-83), based on a new transcription, at last provided the whole text, and corrected many other deficiencies in the previous versions. Meanwhile Pepys's professional achievements have become better known from the publication by the Navy Records Society of several of his other writings. 
Pepys has thereby achieved something of a split reputation. Sometimes his professional career has not been taken seriously because of the hedonistic image perceived from the diary. Conversely those to whom the Pepys of the diary is sympathetic can be disappointed by all else that he wrote, and conclude that after 1669 his genius left him. However much his later life is examined, it is the diary which has made him famous, and from which he will be judged. Much has been made of the blemishes of character which the diary reveals, though the frankness of his confessions has generally brought absolution. Pepys is a persuasive companion, and because when he speaks directly to his reader he is so palpably honest, he can seem to have the right of every argument. There is a powerful personality at work here, but also great art. As a diarist he is simply the best there was, with the good fortune to be close to the centre of momentous events. He has the continuing compliment of countless imitators; he is commemorated in a good few hostelries, and in the activities of the club which bears his name. Not quite everyone has been seduced by his charm, but in the glass he holds up few can have found no reflection.

Pepys, William Hasledine (1775-1856), surgical instrument maker and natural philosopher, was born on 23 March 1775, one of two surviving sons of William Hasledine Pepys (1748-1805), cutler and surgical instrument maker of the Poultry, London, and his wife, Letitia Weedon. The family claimed descent from Sir Richard Pepys (1588-1659), lord chief justice of Ireland. Nothing is known of Pepys's education, but he was among the group of young men interested in the new sciences who founded in 1796 the Askesian Society. He was a founder in 1805 and first secretary of the London Institution, and active in the British Mineralogical Society, founded in 1799, which in 1807 merged with the Askesian Society to form the Geological Society of London. Pepys was active and held office in all these groups; his skill in building apparatus for chemical and electrochemical investigations was important in advancing the sciences which underpinned the members' interests. An autobiographical note relates, 'The first experiments I made were in the early part of my life. I commenced with fermentations... the methods required for their production brought me acquainted with gaseous fluids, and a great field was opened to me... one experiment suggested another, and in the pursuit, discoveries were made that were not expected' (Royal Society, MS 155). When the new metal platinum was finding its way into scientific instrument workshops Pepys and his friends in the Mineralogical Society undertook electrical experiments with it. In May 1805 Pepys made up a platinum fruit knife which he presented to Sir Joseph Banks, and in June he presented two similar knives to George III. 
Pepys succeeded to his father's business and extended it to scientific instrument making. He followed his father in the Cutlers' Company, becoming twice master during the 1820s, and he was in later years a benefactor to the Cutlers' charities. His work and interests brought him into contact with several Quaker scientists, notably William Allen and Luke Howard, though Pepys himself was a lifelong practising Anglican. With Allen he developed apparatus for researches into respiration in man, animals, and plants, which laid the basis for understanding the chemistry of that process. Mineralogy led him to the blowpipe for analysis of various minerals and of human teeth. In the new field of electrical technology Pepys investigated atmospheric electricity with Howard, delved into magnetism with Humphry Davy and others, and undertook the construction of several large batteries which he made available for electromagnetic researches. 
Pepys married, on 21 September 1815 at Waltham Abbey, Lydia (died 1851), an under-age daughter of Robert Walton. They had seven children: five daughters, of whom two died young, and two sons; William Hasledine Pepys (1817-1880) settled in Cologne and Robert Edmond (1819-1883) continued the business until 1863 when the Poultry shops were demolished for redevelopment. 
Pepys enjoyed a long and influential relationship with the Royal Institution, from the time when Count Rumford proposed him as a proprietor in 1800 until 1846. Thereafter he served on the permanent committee set up to deal with chemical investigations undertaken in the institution's laboratory. In 1812 he directed John Newman, the institution's instrument maker, in a comprehensive overhaul of the institution's apparatus and the purchase of necessary new items. In 1814 he was elected as a visitor, in 1815 a manager, and in 1821 he became its secretary. In 1828 he joined the committee for regulating the discourses and lectures, and in 1830 the accounts committee. In February 1830 the institution awarded him the Fuller gold medal for his chemical researches and improvement of chemical apparatus. Pepys's experiments lacked originality but he was adept at devising and constructing apparatus. He was among the first to use mercury contacts for electrical apparatus, and to employ rubber-coated tubes for conveying gas. His eudiometer, air-holder, and mercury gasometer had proved useful for research into the constitution of air and gases, his researches into combustion of diamond, graphite, charcoal, and various metallic ores had commercial potential, and his work with Allen on respiration contributed to medical knowledge. 
The London Institution, modelled on the Royal Institution, was established in 1805, its proprietors drawn from trade and industry. At first it offered members only a library, but in 1819 it moved into new purpose-built premises in Finsbury Circus, with a laboratory designed and equipped by Pepys, and he carried out many of his investigations there. He designed its great battery, built up from 2000 double plates. From 1819 until its plates finally corroded in 1835 it was used by other scientists, Davy and Brande among them, for experiments and demonstrations. In 1823 Pepys designed a huge single cell for the London Institution, each plate measuring 50 by 2 feet. 
Pepys was elected FRS in 1808 and he published occasionally in the 'Philosophical Transactions', but the majority of his numerous articles appeared in Tilloch's 'Philosophical Magazine'. He was elected to the Society of Arts in 1801, and served on its chemistry committee from 1850. He was a member of the Pitt Club from 1822, of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1823, and was also a member of the Athenaeum. Pepys died at his house in Earl's Terrace, Kensington, London, on 17 August 1856.

Perbroun, John (d. 1342/3), merchant, was the son of Robert Perbroun of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The town was the centre of the internationally important herring trade in England and also a port that enjoyed a diversified trade with Bordeaux and other Atlantic and North Sea centres. John Perbroun became involved in all the trades underpinning the town's wealth. Between 1320 and 1324 his dealings in wine were worth at least $122 6's'. 8died, and with those of his partners $696 11's'. 2died His purchase, with Herman Breton, a fellow burgess, of goods worth $340 4's'. 6died in 1323-4 for the purposes of trade indicates the scale of his activity at this time. His main involvement in the herring trade was as a host (surety) for foreign fishermen and as an owner of fishing boats, of which he had at least seven in 1337, and a fish house. He also dealt in wool, and owned at least four merchant ships. 
Perbroun held many urban offices. At any one time Great Yarmouth had four bailiffs, and between 1312 and 1339 Perbroun served fifteen times as one of them. He was collector of murage in 1338-9, MP in 1322 and 1323, and represented the town at merchant assemblies, summoned by the crown for the negotiation of taxes on wool, in 1327 and 1340. Moreover, as a successful merchant and shipowner, he was an obvious choice for certain royal offices, including that of admiral, the official responsible for the impressment of shipping for the king's wars. Perbroun held this office north of the Thames at least eight times between 1317 and 1341. As admiral he received a regular income and, in 1334, a royal gift of $100. He was deputy to the king's butler at Yarmouth in 1323, collector of royal customs there in 1330-33 and 1334-41, and, with Thomas Drayton, a fellow burgess, farmer of the customs in 1333-4. It is difficult not to conclude that service as admiral gave him easier access to further offices. 
Perbroun's career was not without its dangers and blemishes. In 1314, when he was town bailiff, hostility from the rival settlement of Little Yarmouth forced him to take refuge for a time at sea. In 1327 he supported Prince Edward against his father, and was subsequently pardoned for acquiescence in Mortimer's rule. In 1333 he defaulted on sums due from customs accounts, and the king was still seeking redress in 1343, after Perbroun's death. He was both a victim of piracy and a perpetrator of it. In general, however, he prospered, and in 1332 he was taxed at $3 for the subsidy on moveables, 50 per cent more than the next wealthiest burgess. In the next year his property in Yarmouth was valued at $8 0's'. 7died per annum. The sum points to a substantial but not unduly large investment in real property and suggests that much of his capital was tied up in his ships and merchandise. Perbroun had two brothers, and when he died, in 1342 or 1343, was succeeded by three sons and a daughter; his eldest son, Farman, who was taxed at 4's'. in 1332, had three sons and four daughters. Farman, however, was impoverished in the late 1340s and died of the black death in 1348-9. No Perbroun is mentioned in Yarmouth after 1364, and with the exception of Roger Perbroun, who held church livings at Howe, Brandon, and Hemsby (all in Norfolk), and who may have been related to John, no member of the family can be traced after this time in rural Norfolk or Suffolk. Unlike some other influential families, such as the Elyses, Draytons, and Fastolfs, the Perbrouns failed to establish themselves as either an urban or a rural dynasty. The fortunes of the Perbrouns, bound up in shipping and the herring trade, provide a mirror of those of Great Yarmouth more generally. Prosperity in the late thirteenth century, and the early decades of the fourteenth, was followed by misfortune and decline, started by the Hundred Years' War and accentuated by the black death.

Perceval, Alexander (1787-1858), politician and serjeant-at-arms of the House of Lords, was born on 10 February 1787 at Temple House, Ballymote, co. Sligo, the second son and eventual heir of the Revd Philip Perceval, who succeeded his elder brother Guy Carleton Perceval in the family estates in 1792, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Alexander Carroll of Dublin. The first of the family to migrate from Somerset to Ireland had been Richard Perceval (c.1558-1620), who as the confidential agent of Lord Burghley was credited with deciphering the communications which gave the first intelligence of the Armada. Philip Perceval had died by the time his son Alexander entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 7 November 1803 (Burtchaell & Sadleir, 'Alum. Dubl.', 662); the latter's landed inheritance in co. Sligo, where he largely resided, was a substantial one, and he later became an active justice of the peace. On 11 February 1808, the day after he came of age, Perceval married Jane Anne (died 1847), eldest daughter of Colonel Henry Peisley L'Estrange of Moystown, King's county. They had a large family, of whom four sons and six daughters survived to adulthood. 
Perceval was lieutenant-colonel of the Sligo militia from 1809 until 1851. At the general election of 1831 he was returned to parliament for co. Sligo after a contest. He was re-elected unopposed in 1832 and 1835, was again victorious in a contest in 1837, and came in without opposition in 1841. As 'an earnest and zealous Conservative' ('GM', 3rd ser., 6, 1859, 209), he opposed the Grey ministry's reform bills, and as a member of the Orange Association of Ireland he was in the minority against the grant to the Catholic college of Maynooth of 26 September 1831. In January and February 1832 he was prominent in successful protests in the Commons against the practice whereby the Irish lord chancellor exacted fees from justices of the peace for the renewal of their commissions on a demise of the crown ('Hansard 3', 9.794, 10.33-45). A founder member of the Carlton Club in March 1832 ('The Times', 10 March 1832), he was treasurer of the ordnance in Sir Robert Peel's first administration from December 1834 until April 1835. The following year he acquiesced and aided in the dissolution of the Orange Association, of which he was by then treasurer, at the behest of the Melbourne ministry (BL, Add. MS 40424, fol. 267). During his ten-year Commons career he was a regular speaker, mostly on Irish subjects: some 500 interventions by him were reported. When Peel formed his second administration in September 1841 he appointed Perceval a lord of the Treasury, having been unable to effect a preferred arrangement to place him in the household (BL, Add. MS 40487, fol. 356). Perceval held the post for only twelve days before replacing Admiral Sir George Seymour as serjeant-at-arms of the House of Lords, which obliged him to relinquish his seat. 
Perceval, who was created a DCL of the University of Oxford on 13 June 1834, served the upper house capably for more than seventeen years until his death, after 'two attacks of paralysis', at his home, 28 Chester Street, London, on 9 December 1858. He was described in an obituary as 'a highly educated gentleman, full of Irish humour and well-told anecdote', whose 'temper was one of deep unfeigned devotion' ('GM', 3rd ser., 6, 1859, 209).

Perceval, Arthur Philip (1799-1853), Church of England clergyman and religious writer, was born on 22 November 1799, the fifth and youngest son of Charles George Perceval, second Baron Arden (1756-1840), and his wife, Margaretta Elizabeth (1768-1851), eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson, baronet. He entered Oriel College, Oxford, on 19 March 1817, graduating BA in 1820 and BCL in 1824; from 1821 to 1825 he was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. On 18 June 1824 he was appointed rector of East Horsley, Surrey, and on 15 December 1825 he married Charlotte Anne (died 21 June 1856), eldest daughter of the Revd Augustus George Legge, fifth son of William, second earl of Dartmouth. They had three sons and two daughters. 
In 1826 Perceval became chaplain to George IV, and continued as royal chaplain to William IV and Queen Victoria until October 1850, when he was deprived of his appointment for his opposition to the Gorham judgment. He was involved with the Oxford Movement from its beginnings in 1833 and was the author of numbers 23, 35, and 36 of 'Tracts for the Times'. In 1841 he published a 'Vindication of the Authors of the Tracts for the Times', which particularly defended J. H. Newman against the attacks made on his 'Tract 90', and on 24 July 1838, when preaching as royal chaplain at the Chapel Royal, St James's, he advocated high-church principles before the queen, to her irritation. Bishop Blomfield of London, who was aware of Perceval's intention, was said to have preached for several Sundays in order to keep Perceval out of the pulpit; but when the bishop broke his collarbone Perceval found his opportunity ('Greville Memoirs', 1.116). 
Perceval was a prolific author, and his published works, though mainly composed of letters, sermons, and pamphlets, fill three pages in the British Library catalogue. Among the most characteristic are 'The Roman Schism Illustrated from the Records of the Catholic Church' (1836), 'Sermons Preached Chiefly at the Chapel Royal, St James's' (1839), 'An Apology for the Doctrine of Apostolical Succession' (1839), and 'A Collection of Papers Connected with the Theological Movement of 1833' (1842). Although a dedicated high-churchman, Perceval gradually distanced himself from the Oxford Movement. He died on 11 June 1853 at Little Bookham, Surrey, from an overdose of laudanum ('GM', 208).

Perceval, John, first earl of Egmont (1683-1748), politician and diarist, was born at Burton, co. Cork, on 12 July 1683, the second son of Sir John Perceval, third baronet (died 1686), and his wife, Catherine (died 1692), the fourth daughter of Sir Edward Dering, second baronet, of Surrenden Dering, Kent. Following the death of their father in 1686 at the age of twenty-nine, John Perceval and his brothers Edward and Philip were placed in the care of a great-uncle, Sir Robert Southwell, of King's Weston in England. Their mother remarried in 1690 but two years later died in childbirth. Upon the death of his elder brother, Edward, at the age of nine, in November 1691, the eight-year-old John Perceval became the fifth baronet. 
John Perceval and his younger brother, Philip, grew up in England under the guardianship of Sir Robert Southwell and, following his death in 1702, that of his son Sir Edward Southwell. After private tuition at home, and three years at Mr Demouere's academy in Westminster, Perceval matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in November 1699. He left Oxford in 1701 without taking his degree but the following year, probably because of his great-uncle's influence, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Between 1704 and 1707 he travelled in England, Ireland, and continental Europe. He married on 10 June 1710 Catherine (1687/8-1749), the eldest daughter of Sir Philip Parker a Morley bt, of Erwarton, Suffolk. They had seven children, three sons and four daughters, of whom John Perceval and his sisters Catherine and Helena reached adulthood. Perceval paid periodic visits to Ireland, and lived there between 1711 and 1714, but chose to make London his main residence. 
In 1704, at the age of twenty-one, Perceval inherited the 22,000 acres of land in Cork and Tipperary which provided him with a healthy income for the rest of his life. In that same year he also embarked on his political career when he was returned to the Irish House of Commons as the member for County Cork. Later in 1704 he was sworn of the privy council in Ireland. In 1713 he was re-elected as the member for County Cork and two years later, after first refusing it on the grounds that it was inferior to its English equivalent, he accepted the Irish title of Baron Perceval of Burton in the county of Cork. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords on 12 November 1715. Perceval had been led to believe by his friends in government and court circles that this Irish honour would shortly be followed by the English barony which he so craved, but this was not to be. However, in 1723 he was created Viscount Perceval of Kanturk, also in the county of Cork. 
Although deeply disappointed by his failure to secure an English title, Perceval was immensely proud of the Irish honours bestowed on him. In 1719, and again in 1733, he was at the forefront of those Irish peers who tried to prevent either royal or parliamentary erosion of their authority. The stand taken by Perceval did not irreparably damage either his reputation or his career. He assiduously continued to cultivate the support of influential persons in the highest social and political circles, and he remained on the very best terms with the prince of Wales, later George II, Queen Caroline, and Sir Robert Walpole. Perceval became active in English politics during the 1720s. In 1727 he spent around $1000 to secure his election as MP for Harwich, but stood down in the election of 1734 in favour of his eldest son, John. Mainly because of the Walpole ministry's deep dislike of him, the young Perceval was defeated. Although his father never forgave Walpole for this affront, the prime minister remained relatively cordial towards Perceval. 
In 1729 Perceval sat on the parliamentary gaols committee chaired by James Edward Oglethorpe, and the subsequent close collaboration between the two men was instrumental in the founding of the colony of Georgia. Perceval's interest in the Americas had been kindled in 1708 when, on a visit to Ireland, he met George Berkeley. They became firm friends and, when Perceval returned to England, they embarked on a lengthy correspondence. Perceval was impressed by Berkeley's plan to found a colony in Bermuda for the training of Anglican missionaries and, although that plan came to nothing, Perceval retained his interest in the Americas. He was an early and an enthusiastic supporter of Oglethorpe's scheme to establish a new colony on the North American mainland, and he used his influential connections to secure support for the proposed colony of Georgia. In the royal charter of 9 June 1732 authorizing the founding of that colony he was named as the first president of the trustees ['see 'Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America]. In the summer of the following year, partly because of his lobbying and partly because of his role in the Georgia project, he received another Irish honour when he was created earl of Egmont. 
Between 1732 and the spring of 1742, when he resigned from the common council of the trustees because of his failing health, Egmont played a pivotal role in securing both the public and the private funding which were essential for the support and defence of Georgia. When the trustees' plan came under attack from the Georgia colonists and their allies in the House of Commons Egmont adroitly organized their defence. The survival of Georgia owed as much to Egmont's efforts in London as it did to Oglethorpe's activities in the colony. Egmont kept a personal diary for many years, and this, together with his accounts of the Georgia trustees' proceedings, provides a mine of information not only about his own life but also about many different facets of elite society in early Georgian London. Egmont's diaries, and the unreliable 'Genealogical History of the House of Yvery', published under his supervision in 1742, lend credence to the contemporary view of him as a pompous and conceited person. However, his diaries also reveal that he had a deep and abiding love of the arts and enjoyed a generally happy relationship with his wife. Egmont died in London on 1 May 1748 and was buried at Erwarton. He was survived by his wife, who died on 22 August the following year and by his son, John Perceval (1711-1770), who succeeded him as the second earl of Egmont. His name was often subsequently spelt Percival.

Perceval, John, second earl of Egmont (1711-1770), politician, was born on 24 February 1711 at Westminster, the only surviving son of John Perceval, first earl of Egmont (1683-1748), politician, and his wife, Catherine (1687/1688-1749), the eldest daughter of Sir Philip Parker, second baronet, of Erwarton, Suffolk, and Mary Forbrey. 
Styled Viscount Perceval from 1733 to 1748, Perceval received a private education in which his father instructed him in history and antiquities. At the age of twenty he was returned for the seat of Dingle in the Irish parliament. In 1734 his father stood down at his parliamentary seat at Harwich in favour of his son, but Perceval was not returned, and both father and son blamed the defeat on Robert Walpole. Feeling slighted by both Walpole and the king, Perceval gave his support to the opposition and the use of his house in Pall Mall to Frederick, prince of Wales. The offer was refused, but the prince later took Perceval as his political adviser. At Kensington, on 15 February 1737, Perceval married Lady Catherine Cecil (1719-1752), the second daughter of James Cecil, fifth earl of Salisbury, and Anne Tufton. They had five sons and two daughters. Perceval tried twice more to gain a seat in the British House of Commons but was unsuccessful. He was then adopted as an opposition candidate for Westminster after 'intriguing' against two government candidates, and after the annulment of the election he was returned unopposed on 31 December 1741. His maiden speech in the Commons was in support of a motion to enquire into the conduct of the war, and was directed against Walpole. His pamphlet 'Faction Detected by the Evidence of the Facts' (1743) earned the disapproval of the opposition and his constituents, resulting in the loss of his seat in 1747. Perceval was adept at making political enemies, for no sooner had he gained a new parliamentary seat at Weobley with the support of Henry Pelham than he went over to the opposition. He had been defeated at the poll but returned by petition, and demonstrated his loyalty to Pelham by calling him a treacherous servant of the king. After joining the Leicester House faction surrounding the prince of Wales, Perceval was made a lord of the bedchamber to the prince. According to Horace Walpole, both the old and new members of the ministry hated Perceval, and the tories could not forgive him for his conduct in the previous parliament. On 1 May 1748 Perceval succeeded his father as second earl of Egmont in the Irish peerage. 
Egmont was now Frederick's chief political adviser, and between them they drew up detailed plans for Frederick's accession to the throne on the eventual death of his father George II. These plans included a distribution of offices and an analysis of the House of Commons to assist in the general election that would come about within six months of a new reign, the fixing of the civil list, matters concerned with foreign policy, and drafts of speeches to parliament. Egmont was now a prominent opposition speaker in the Commons, and his attack on the 'Mutiny Bill' in 1749 caused Sir Hanbury Williams to pen an epigram in which he cast Egmont as someone who had mutinied for pay and twice deserted. 
In 1749 Egmont published two political pamphlets critical of Henry Pelham and his brother the duke of Newcastle, and another concerning the 1743 treaty of Hanau. The following year he is supposed to have written 'Constitutional Queries Earnestly Recommended to the Serious Consideration of every True Briton', which was ordered to be burnt by the common hangman in 1751. The death in March 1751 of Frederick left Egmont's political ambitions in disarray. The princess of Wales summoned him and directed him to go to Carlton House to collect the prince's papers. The political papers concerned with the accession were burnt, though Egmont retained copies that have survived. Egmont then held a meeting at his house in Pall Mall of the main opposition members, and resolved to stand by the princess and her children. However, the princess found that it was in her best interest to abandon her husband's friends, and the bulk of the prince's faction dispersed, leaving Egmont in opposition for the remainder of the parliament. To his political misfortunes was added a personal one with the death of his wife on 16 August 1752. 
In the general election of April 1754 Egmont was returned for Bridgwater. The princess now persuaded him to accept office. He was sworn of the privy council on 9 January 1755, but refused to serve with Henry Fox, now leader of the house. He was also supplanted at Leicester House by Lord Bute. On 26 January 1756 he married Catherine (1731-1784), the third daughter of the Hon. Charles Compton and Mary Berkeley. They had three sons and six daughters. Spencer Perceval (1762-1812), his second son by this marriage, became prime minister in 1809 and was assassinated in 1812. In October 1756 the duke of Newcastle offered to make Egmont a secretary of state and leader of the House of Commons, but Egmont refused unless he was also made an English peer. This did not suit Newcastle, as he needed Egmont in the Commons. Egmont again refused office in May 1757. About this time, James Waldegrave, second Earl Waldegrave, described Egmont as a good speaker in parliament who was not easily intimidated and whose only amusements were business and politics, yet 'he respected himself rather more than the world respected him' (Namier, 3.267). Egmont continued in opposition during the remainder of the reign but was not politically active, even though he consistently opposed William Pitt, whom he detested. 
The accession of George III in 1760 raised Egmont's hopes that his political fortunes might change. Returned once more for Bridgwater in March 1761, he became associated with Lord Bute. He had asked Bute the year before if he could be of service to the king, hoping that he would be made a British peer. This ambition was achieved on 7 May 1762 when he was created Baron Lovel and Holland of Enmore, Somerset. Three days later he took his seat in the House of Lords, and on 27 November 1762 he was made joint postmaster-general. A less controversial figure than in former times, Egmont now settled down to the work of government. He became associated with a political grouping that came to include Bute and Charles Jenkinson and was attached solely to the crown rather than to any political faction. 
Egmont's capacity for business was finally realized when, on 10 September 1763, he was appointed to succeed the earl of Sandwich as first lord of the Admiralty, in George Grenville's ministry. First, however, he was able to make use of his position to provide for his numerous family. His third son, Philip, an officer in the navy, was appointed to the command of the 'Ramilles'. Charles Perceval and Spencer, sons from his second marriage, were made registrars of the Admiralty through reversionary grants by letters patent. But his achievement at the Admiralty has been unrecognized, largely as a result of Horace Walpole's unflattering portrayal of him as a wasteful eccentric who left the navy in a wretched condition, throwing away between $400,000 and $500,000 'on pompous additions to the dockyards' (Walpole, 'Memoirs of... George III', 4.136-7). 
Egmont's delight in antiquities and his eccentric taste as well as a number of unusual schemes served to make contemporary observers such as Walpole portray him as a figure of ridicule. Egmont had produced two volumes of the 'Genealogical History of the House of Yvery' in 1742, giving a fanciful account of the origins of his own family. His house at Enmore, near Bridgwater in Somerset, was rebuilt as a moated castle. His most unusual scheme, however, was to submit a memorial to the king in December 1763 asking for a grant of the island of St John in the Gulf of St Lawrence, to be settled on a feudal basis. He estimated that 800,000 acres could be held by military tenure and that, if the system should be extended to the newly acquired lands in Canada, a feudal levy of 724,000 men could be raised for the defence of America. In this venture he gained support from respected naval officers such as Keppel and Saunders, but after strenuous objections from General Conway the scheme was set aside. 
There was nothing fanciful about Egmont's management of the navy between 1763 and 1766. By his predecessor's estimate, it would take over five years and more than $3 million to put the navy on a respectable footing after the hardships of the late war. The Admiralty's task was complicated by reduced parliamentary supplies, a navy debt of over $41/2 million, and a programme of retrenchment. Egmont made a visit to the dockyards in the spring of 1764, the first such visitation since that of Sandwich and Anson in 1749. He noted a number of inadequacies in the infrastructure and organization of the yards, and he ordered that repair priorities be rearranged so that ships could be brought forward more quickly. All new ships were to be built on slips to free the docks to undertake repairs, and he requested detailed information on the regulation and economy of the yards. Turning his attention to the shipwrights and artificers in the yards, Egmont called for reports on the numbers and occupations of dockyard workers, the condition of the ships, and the length of time and number of men required to undertake specific tasks. He then made a number of productivity calculations. He increased the number of shipwrights by 400 and introduced a scheme of superannuation for deserving elderly shipwrights which allowed their places to be taken by able-bodied and more productive workers. By his efforts the dockyards were made more efficient and productive. It was also during Egmont's period at the Admiralty that Byron was sent on his voyage of discovery to the Pacific, and that a settlement was made in the Falkland Islands, named Port Egmont in honour of the first lord. 
In 1765 Egmont's need for further naval expenditure was resisted by George Grenville, first lord of the Treasury and prime minister. Grenville had brought the navy's debt down to manageable proportions and was anxious that an increase in naval appropriation would cause alarm both at home and abroad. Egmont was particularly concerned that the Treasury had reduced the naval estimates and that money needed urgently for the expansion of the dockyards at Portsmouth and Plymouth had been cut entirely. He consulted in secret with the Navy Board, which produced detailed plans of expenditure that Egmont submitted to the king through the earl of Halifax on 30 May, along with accounts of the French and Spanish fleets. The Treasury, on learning of these accounts, attempted to undermine Egmont by dealing directly with the Navy Board on matters of expenditure. Egmont had already removed Grenville's power to cut appropriation for dockyard expansion by obtaining a privy council order directing a sum for this work to be included annually in the estimates. The Treasury's response was to interfere in the affairs of the Navy Board, and this was an affront to Egmont's authority. Grenville was already on bad terms with the king, and further aggravation was avoided by the dismissal of Grenville and his ministry. 
Egmont had usually remained silent in Grenville's cabinet, but he emerged from the collapse of the ministry as the king's man. In much the same way that he had advised Prince Frederick in the composition of a new government, Egmont, along with the duke of Cumberland, the king's uncle, now assisted George III in the construction of a new administration to be led by the marquess of Rockingham. Egmont remained in the new ministry as first lord of the Admiralty. He was free from Treasury interference and by September 1765 could report that the fleet would muster sixty-two ships of the line of sixty guns or more, all in good condition, with a further twenty fit for service by the end of 1769. This achievement was in large measure due to Egmont's competent management of the navy's affairs. 
The Rockingham administration collapsed in 1766 and a new ministry was formed under William Pitt, now ennobled as earl of Chatham. Despite his antipathy to Pitt, Egmont, with the support of the king, remained at the head of the Admiralty. However, he soon resigned (on 12 August), since he found Pitt's overbearing nature too much to tolerate. He explained to the king that he disapproved of Chatham's foreign policy, and feared that he would embarrass his majesty's affairs if they were debated in council: 'He could submit to the majority; but as he found one man was to have more weight than six, he begged to be unemployed' (Walpole, 'Memoirs of... George III', 2.155). 
Egmont played no further part in government or politics. He had a clear aptitude for public business, though his political judgement did not always work to his advantage. His parliamentary notes, written in neat columns with tiny characters, display a methodical and highly organized mind. Dr Johnson wrote of him that he was 'a man whose mind was vigourous and active, whose knowledge was extensive and whose designs were magnificent, but who had somewhat vitiated his judgement by too much indulgence in romantic projects and speculations' (GEC, 'Peerage', 5.30). Horace Walpole has left an illustration of Egmont's personality: 'His heart rather wanted improvement than his head, though when his ambition and lust of Parliament were out of the question, he was humane, friendly and as good humoured as it is possible for a man to be who was never known to laugh; he was once indeed seen to smile, and that was at chess. He did not dislike mirth in others but he seemed to adjourn his attention till he could bring back the company to seriousness. (Walpole, 'Memoirs of... George II', 1.23)' Egmont died at his home in Pall Mall, London, on 4 December 1770 and was buried on the 11th at Charlton in Kent. He was survived by his wife, who had been created on 23 May 1770 Baroness Arden of Lohort Castle, and died at Langley, Buckinghamshire, on 11 June 1784.

Perceval, Sir Philip (1605-1647), politician, was the younger of the two sons of Richard Perceval (c.1558-1620) of Sydenham, Somerset, and his second wife, Alice, daughter of John Sherman of Ottery St Mary, Devon. He succeeded his father and brother as clerk and registrar to the commissioners of the Irish wards, a post which he held in sole right after 1624. In the late 1620s and 1630s Perceval became feodary and escheator in co. Limerick and clerk of the court of wards in Munster, and he used his position to lease wards' lands at low rates, lending the profits to local families in return for mortgages. His moneylending schemes were extremely lucrative, as Old English debtors, unable to pay the sums due, were forced to surrender their estates. The Barrys, MacCarthys, O'Callaghans, and Roches all fell victim to Perceval's designs, and by 1641 nearly 100,000 English acres in Munster -- yielding rents in excess of $4000 -- had come into his possession. Financial success brought social acceptability, helped by his marriage on 16 October 1626 to Katherine, daughter of the well-connected Dublin official Arthur Ussher. He also became a friend of other acquisitive New Englishmen in Munster, including the first earl of Cork and Sir William St Leger. 
In the 1630s Perceval's prospects improved still further with his successful attempt to court the favour of the new lord deputy, Viscount Wentworth. By early 1634 he had become friendly with two of Wentworth's closest advisers, Sir Philip Mainwaring and Sir George Radcliffe. In 1636 he was admitted to King's Inns, Dublin; in the same year he was knighted by the lord deputy at Dublin before accompanying him to England. In the later 1630s Perceval aided Wentworth's schemes to find royal title to lands, preparatory to plantation, in Connaught, Munster, and the Byrnes country in co. Wicklow, in which he and other government lackeys also benefited. With the fall of Wentworth in 1640-41, Perceval's part in these irregular land deals was exposed, and he narrowly avoided prosecution in England ('among those whose actions are re-examined and reflected upon'; 'Egmont MSS', 1.142) in September 1641. 
The execution of Wentworth did not, however, leave Perceval entirely without allies. A particularly useful patron was the twelfth earl of Ormond, whose business associations with Perceval dated back to 1631, and who had used him as guarantor of his debts in March 1641. After the outbreak of rebellion in Ireland in October 1641 Ormond repaid the favour by commissioning Perceval first as captain of firelocks in his own regiment, and then as commissary-general of the victuals. In turn Perceval, who had travelled to England in the winter of 1641-2, defended Ormond against accusations of colluding with the Catholic rebels, raised by parliamentarians suspicious of his Old English ethnicity. 
In the meantime the Irish rising had spread to Munster, where resistance was mounted by Perceval's old friends the earl of Cork, Sir William St Leger, and St Leger's son-in-law, Lord Inchiquin. Perceval's lands were overrun, with his castles at Liscarroll and Annagh holding out until September 1642. It was the local crisis, and the fear that the onset of civil war in England would prevent any further aid to the protestants in Ireland, which encouraged him to support negotiations which led to a truce with the Catholic confederates in September 1643. In March 1644 he was chosen as one of four agents sent by Ormond to Oxford to turn the cessation into a permanent peace. Yet Perceval and his colleagues found that many prominent courtiers (including Prince Rupert) supported the demands of the confederates, and in reaction they were vociferous in their opposition to peace on easy terms. This brought condemnation from many at Oxford. As Radcliffe told Ormond in June 1644: 'Perceval... had gone here for a roundhead if your excellency had not recommended him as he did' (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 11, fol. 175). Perceval had left Oxford at the end of the month, but instead of returning to Dublin, he stayed with friends in Hertfordshire. In August, following the defection to parliament of the Munster forces led by Lord Inchiquin, Perceval went to London, where he too embraced the parliamentarian cause. 
From 1645 until his death in 1647 Perceval was a crucial figure in Anglo-Irish politics. He was on good terms with Inchiquin in Munster, and at Westminster sided with those Irish protestant MPs aligned with the presbyterian party, especially Sir Robert King, Sir John Clotworthy, and William Jephson. Perceval also remained on good terms with Ormond, and was an important part of the network which kept open lines of communication between Dublin and London. The rival Independent party, who were suspicious of Ormond and Inchiquin, recognized Perceval as a threat, and from the autumn of 1645 mounted a vigorous campaign to discredit him, reminding the parliamentarians that he had supported the 1643 cessation, and hinting that he had come to Westminster 'with the king's leave, and acted for him here ever since', and stating that he was 'so engaged to Lord Ormond that he was not capable of public employment' ('Egmont MSS', 1.279, 353-4). Such attacks did not deter Perceval from acting as intermediary between parliament and Ormond in their abortive peace talks in the autumn of 1646, or in defending Inchiquin against Independent attacks in the winter of 1646-7. 
Perceval's stance on Irish affairs recommended him to the leaders of the presbyterian party, and as early as March 1647 there were moves to secure him a seat in parliament. His election on 19 May to the Cornish borough of Newport was probably on the interest of Thomas Gewen MP, who was recorder of the nearby town of Launceston. Perceval's arrival in the Commons caused a storm of protest from the Independents, who reminded the house on 2 June that he had supported the cessation and was a 'special confidant of the Lord of Ormond' ('Egmont MSS', 1.411, 413). A further attack came on 5 July, when the Independents were narrowly defeated in an attempt to disable any member who had supported the 1643 cessation. This assault was interrupted by the 'forcing' of the houses in late July and early August, when a presbyterian mob invaded parliament. Perceval remained at Westminster during this period, and supported attempts to defend London against the New Model Army. The victory of the army and their Independent allies heightened the danger to Perceval, and by the end of August he had withdrawn from the Commons, staying with friends such as the earl of Suffolk and William Jephson outside London, and preparing his defence against any impeachment proceedings initiated by his enemies. Before he could vindicate himself, however, Perceval fell ill, and died in London on 10 November 1647. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, with a funeral sermon preached by his wife's kinsman Primate Ussher. Through his eldest son, John Perceval, he was the ancestor of the earls of Egmont.

Perceval, Richard (c.1558-1620), administrator and lexicographer, was the eldest son of George Perceval (died 'c'.1600), a gentleman of Nailsea and Sydenham, Somerset, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Bampfylde of Poltimore, Devon. His life was the focus of a family history commissioned by his descendant the first earl of Egmont, which confused many of the details of his career. Perceval was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1571, and at Lincoln's Inn in 1576. He married as his first wife Joan (died 'c'.1585), daughter of Henry Yonge of Buckhorn Weston, Dorset, who was probably the widow of John Royall and brought him no dowry. His father, upset by the match, disinherited him, and he spent four years in Spain. He presumably returned to England at the outbreak of war in 1585, after which he taught for several years at his old school. He also drafted a Spanish-Latin-English dictionary and grammar with the assistance of some of the Armada prisoners, whose ransom he helped to negotiate. His book 'Bibliotheca Hispanica' (1591) was dedicated to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, presumably in hope of preferment; but about 1594 he joined the secretariat of the earl's rival Sir Robert Cecil upon a recommendation from his relative Roger Cave. 
Despite his linguistic abilities, Perceval had little to do with Cecil's diplomatic activities, although he later boasted of his speedy translation of a captured Spanish dispatch in 1598 which proved that Henri IV of France was about to abandon his alliance with England. His chief role was the handling of petitions for leases of the estates of minors whose wardship fell to the crown, many of which crossed Cecil's desk both before and after he became master of the court of wards in 1599. Perceval's family claimed his post had been worth $2000 a year, probably an exaggeration, but he is known to have been offered generous gratuities by suitors, and he procured leases of several wardships for himself and his relatives. In addition to his main role, he occasionally supervised Cecil's building works. 
Perceval was returned to parliament in 1604 as MP for Richmond, Yorkshire, probably through the intervention of the borough's recorder and former MP Cuthbert Pepper, surveyor of the wards. Cecil (newly elevated to the Lords) may have intended to use him as one of his unofficial spokesmen in the Commons: in April 1604 Perceval suggested a compromise over the king's proposal to retitle his realms 'Great Britain'. However, in the same speech he declared his opposition to 'an inundation, or deluge' of Scottish courtiers, a remark unlikely to endear him to the king. This may explain why Perceval was not subsequently used as a 'man of business', although he and Sir Walter Cope were sent to reassure the house when rumours of James's assassination circulated on 22 March 1606. Surprisingly, he played little part in the 1610 debate on the great contract, which proposed to abolish the court of wards. 
Perceval lost his main income on his master's death in 1612, which may explain why he sold his Somerset estate in the following year. However, he continued as clerk registrar of the wards until 1614, when he was dismissed by the new master, William, Lord Knollys. Called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1615, he may have intended to practise as a lawyer, but in 1616 he was sent to Dublin as clerk to the fledgeling Irish court of wards, a post he held until his death at Dublin on 4 September 1620. He was buried in St Audoen's Church, Dublin, where his monument stated he had died in his sixty-ninth year; he was probably somewhat younger, as he only entered Merchant Taylors' as a schoolboy in 1571. He had three sons (all of whom died young) and two daughters by his first marriage; his second, to Alice, daughter of John Sherman of Ottery St Mary, Devon, produced two sons and two daughters. His youngest son, Sir Philip Perceval, inherited the estate at Liscarroll, co. Cork, which he had bought in the last years of his life, and founded an Anglo-Irish dynasty.

Perceval, Robert (1756-1839), physician and chemist, the youngest son of William Perceval, barrister, and his second wife, Elizabeth Ward of Lisbane, co. Down, was born in Dublin on 30 September 1756. He was descended from Sir Philip Perceval (1605-1647), and hence related to the earls of Egmont. Perceval's early education was at Dr Darby's school in Ballygall in north co. Dublin. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in April 1772, and graduated BA in 1777. He then went to Edinburgh, where he studied medicine, was taught chemistry by Joseph Black, and graduated MD on 24 June 1780, with a thesis on the physiology of the heart. 
After studying for two years on the continent Perceval returned to Dublin via London in late 1782. In the following year he was appointed lecturer on chemistry in the university. On 24 November of the same year he was elected a licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians; he subsequently became a fellow. In 1785 he was appointed first professor of chemistry in the University of Dublin, and remained in this post until 1805. Also in 1785 he took an active part in founding the Royal Irish Academy, his name appearing in the charter, and he served as secretary to the academy for a number of years. In the same year he helped to found the Dublin General Dispensary. His scientific papers all appear in the 'Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy'. 
In 1786 Perceval was appointed inspector of apothecaries, and while carrying out this work incurred some temporary unpopularity. He was one of the compilers of the Dublin 'Pharmacopoeia' for the Irish college of physicians. He married, in 1786, Anne, daughter of W. Brereton of Rathgilbert. Perceval now began to devote much of his time and money to medical and other charities in Dublin. He was admitted MB and MD by Dublin University in 1793. 
Largely because of pressure exerted by Perceval through the university, in April 1799 a committee of the Irish House of Lords was appointed to inquire into the application of the funds left by Sir Patrick Dun. Perceval was examined, and stated that he did not think the King and Queen's College of Physicians had properly fulfilled its obligations under Dun's will. Following the report of the Lords' committee, the 'School of Physic Act' became law on 1 August 1800. In accordance with this act a hospital, called Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, was built from the surplus funds of Dun's bequest, and was opened on 25 October 1808. Three professorships in medicine were also established. Although Perceval had been censured by the College of Physicians for his share in the promotion of the act, he was elected president of the college on 4 November 1799. However, at his own wish a special clause was inserted in the act, according to which no university or King's professor could remain a fellow of the college. Perceval therefore resigned his presidency and fellowship, but was elected honorary fellow on 18 October 1800. He subsequently became involved in a controversy with Dr E. Hill, who was obliged, under the provisions of the act, to resign the professorship of botany, which he had held simultaneously with the regius professorship of physic. 
Perceval now became an active member of the Prison Discipline Society, which subsequently merged with the Howard Society, and he became known as 'the Irish Howard' for his concern with the welfare of prisoners. On 18 March 1819 he was appointed physician-general to the forces in Ireland. In 1821 he published an essay in which he sought to show from the texts of the 'New Testament' that Christ, although a divine person, was distinct from the deity, a doctrine similar to that of Adam Clarke (1762-1832). After a lingering illness Perceval died in Dublin on 3 March 1839. 
Perceval was a successful physician, but his claims to fame rest chiefly on his philanthropic efforts. His published contributions to chemistry were insubstantial; the notes for a medical treatise he intended to publish were handed to John Mason Good when Perceval heard that Good was contemplating a similar project.

Perceval, Spencer (1762-1812), prime minister, was born on 1 November 1762 in Audley Square, London, the second son of John Perceval, second earl of Egmont (1711-1770), and his second wife, Catherine (1731-1784), third daughter of the Hon. Charles Compton and granddaughter of George, fourth earl of Northampton. Being the second son of a second marriage he had numerous close relatives (three stepbrothers and one stepsister at the time of his birth, as well as an elder brother, Charles George Perceval, and, later, three sisters) but little prospect of an inheritance sufficient for a life of leisure. 
Perceval's earliest years were spent with his family in their manor house in Charlton, Kent, but in 1774 he was sent to Harrow School and in 1780 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, taking an honorary MA in 1782. His education at both institutions was marked by two themes: academic success and a growing commitment to evangelical Anglicanism. At Harrow he won prizes and was remembered by one of his tutors for his avoidance of 'desultory reading' and for his 'intense perseverance' in pursuit of an accurate understanding of the set texts. At Cambridge, under the supervision of William Lort Mansel and Thomas Mathias, he won the college declamation prize for English and was noted for his studiousness. 
The evangelicalism which was later to distinguish Perceval from the general run of professional politicians developed, it seems, as much from contact with others as from private contemplation. One of the closest and most enduring friendships he made at Harrow was with Dudley Ryder, the second earl of Harrowby, who became a noted evangelical; other contemporaries included two famous for that tendency, the Revd Thomas Gisborne and Thomas Bruce, the future seventh earl of Elgin. More significantly, he associated himself closely at Cambridge with a small but highly influential group of evangelicals, one of whom was the Revd Isaac Milner. 
In the absence of any significant private means on leaving Cambridge, Perceval needed a profession and an income. He therefore entered Lincoln's Inn in 1783, was called to the bar three years later, and having practised with success on the midland circuit, began to accumulate posts through his connections. The first was the deputy recordership of Northampton, secured in 1790 through the influence of his mother's family, the Comptons of Castle Ashby. Others, in the form of a commissionership of bankrupts and the sinecure post of surveyor of the meltings and the clerk of the irons, followed by 1791 as a result of the influence of his elder brother, Lord Arden, who had become a lord of the Admiralty in Pitt's administration. 
It was at this critical juncture that Perceval turned his attention to politics. In 1791 and 1792 he published two anonymous pamphlets, the first in favour of continuing the impeachment of Warren Hastings and the second offering advice for those who wished to resist radicalism. This readiness to contribute to public debate on the side of those who were alarmed by the impact of the French Revolution on British politics certainly did no harm to his prospects at the bar. He was appointed junior counsel for the crown at the trials of the two most influential radicals, Thomas Paine and John Horne Tooke, in 1792 and 1794, and in the latter year was made counsel to the Board of Admiralty through Lord Arden's influence. Two years later he was made a KC and became a bencher at Lincoln's Inn; at this time his private practice was worth about $1000 p.a. 
By now Perceval's private life and convictions had characteristics that were to change little during the remainder of his career. Small of stature -- Lord Eldon referred to him as 'Little P' -- he magnified his naturally pale complexion by dressing usually in black, thereby exuding an air of zealousness. The impression created was not an illusion. Perceval's earlier contact with evangelicalism had led to a commitment to living the life of a Christian gentleman -- to being in the words of one commentator, 'Christianity personified'. Throughout his life, for example, he was the most generous and charitable of men, giving away large sums of money to good causes. In addition, he was a stern sabbatarian, a pungent critic of gaming, drunkenness, hunting, and adultery, as well as a consistent supporter of the abolition of slavery. However, his evangelicalism was of the conservative brand. Unlike some evangelicals, he rejected the view that any gathering of believers constituted a church, and was a firm upholder of the Church of England. From this conviction flowed many of the public policies with which he was associated: reform of the established church in the shape of measures to reduce non-residence, to improve clerical stipends, and to build churches in industrial towns; and, most famously, his opposition to Catholic emancipation. This was based partly on the practical grounds that while failing to appease Catholic Ireland it would weaken the established church; and partly on a combination of millenarianism and bigotry. Thus in a pamphlet on biblical prophecy published in 1800 he wrote of the French Revolution as a divine instrument destined to destroy 'popish superstitions'. 
Perceval's religiosity was matched by his commitment to family life. Never gregarious by nature, he was married on 10 August 1790 to Jane Wilson, the sister of his elder brother's wife and the daughter of Sir Thomas Wilson, a former soldier and MP who had bought the Percevals' manor house in Charlton. The marriage, of which Sir Thomas had disapproved in view of what he regarded as Perceval's poor financial prospects, proved an enduring love match and produced six sons and six daughters. Moreover his wife shared his devotion to religion and joined him wholeheartedly in daily prayers as, in due course, did the rest of his family. 
It was characteristic of Perceval that his entry into politics was more the initiative of others than his own. Shortly before Perceval took silk in 1796, Pitt and the home secretary, the duke of Portland, considered him for the vacant chief secretaryship in Ireland and he was pressed to accept by both the lord lieutenant, Lord Camden, and the first lord of the Admiralty, Lord Spencer -- the latter offering the inducement of a sinecure. Perceval declined the opportunity, pleading the disruption the appointment would cause to his family and his aversion (and presumably that of others) to sinecures. Moreover his return to parliament for Northampton at a by-election in May 1796 was in response to an invitation from his cousin, Lord Compton, who had succeeded to an earldom and wanted a locum tenens until his heir came of age. Elected without a contest then, Perceval stood again as a Compton candidate at the general election later in the year, retaining his seat in a contest in which he declined an alliance with a potential supporter of Pitt's administration in deference to the needs of the family interest. 
However, it was also to be characteristic of Perceval that, once he had been drawn into a new field of endeavour, he devoted himself to it seriously if cautiously. In order to make a mark in the 1790s a great speech was required. Perceval was certainly aware of this and prepared drafts of speeches with great care but none that he delivered attracted notice until 4 January 1798 when he responded to Fox's and Burdett's criticisms of the war effort during a debate on the 'Assessed Taxes Bill'. In his speech he justified the continuation of the war and castigated Fox for both his secession from parliament and his demand for reform at a time of national crisis. It was in effect, if not in fact, his maiden speech and received widespread praise. Granville Leveson-Gower thought it 'incomparable' and Pitt judged it 'one of the best I ever heard' (Gray, 41). 
The speech established Perceval's reputation as a parliamentarian and as a possible future minister. Pitt evidently considered him an eligible heir and steps up the administration's legal ladder followed quickly. In August 1798 he was appointed solicitor to the ordnance and later, in 1799, solicitor-general to the queen. For his part, Perceval spoke more frequently in debate and often acted as a government teller. Besides continuing to argue the case for the war, in which he once identified Bonaparte as the woman in 'Revelation' 17: 3-6, 'who [sits] upon a... beast... the mother of harlots... drunken with the blood of the saints', he endorsed the strategies of the controversial Dutch and Egyptian campaigns, defended the income tax, and supported the union with Ireland. In short, and with the exception of the resort to biblical prophecy, he was a thorough Pittite. 
In the period between Pitt's resignation in February 1801 and Lord Grenville's six years later -- a period characterized by unstable administrations and a proliferation of parliamentary factions -- Perceval became one of the four leading contenders for the leadership of Pitt's friends, the others being Castlereagh, Canning, and Hawkesbury (later the second earl of Liverpool). He acquired rather than pursued that position. Declining to resign with Pitt over the Catholic question, he was appointed solicitor-general (1801) and attorney-general (1802) under Addington, retaining that position in Pitt's last administration, though only after stipulating political terms. He therefore became the Pittites' leading law officer in the Commons at a time when the cases in which he was involved against the radicals Despard, Peltier, and Cobbett (1803-4) and the minister Lord Melville (1805), and in favour of the princess of Wales, whom he defended (1806-7), were high-profile political issues. However, the principal reason for his elevation was his ability as a debater. He was the most powerful defender of the Addington ministry following the renewal of the war in 1803 and the most effective critic of Lord Grenville's, speaking then on more than seventy occasions and providing rallying points for an emerging Pittite opposition. 
On the other hand, Perceval was more than a skilled advocate of a party brief. He developed his own idiosyncratic set of views, components of which appealed to various wings of Pitt's party: opposition to Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform; support for the abolition of the slave trade and the regulation of child labour; and a determination to continue with the war. Moreover, although he acquired no personal following, he demonstrated a capacity for independent judgement and for leadership. During Grenville's ministry, for example, he often led for the opposition and rejected attempts to recruit him into government on the grounds of policy differences and loyalty to his colleagues. 
There was therefore no doubt that Perceval could command high office in the Pittite ministry formed in March 1807 by the infirm stop-gap prime minister, the duke of Portland, following the collapse of Grenville's government on the Catholic question. Indeed his claims were particularly strong as he was the only member of the quartet of future Pittite leaders whose degree of opposition to Catholic emancipation coincided with that of the king. Portland consequently offered Perceval the chancellorship of the exchequer with the 'lead' in the Commons, the latter, perhaps, because of the equal pretensions of the emerging rivals for the succession to Pitt, Castlereagh and Canning. However, much to the consternation of his colleagues and friends, Perceval initially declined the exchequer, pleading as his reasons his preference for the attorney-generalship (and the continuation of his private practice), the inadequacy of the income of $3700 p.a., and his distaste for the 'financial and other labours' which the post would involve. It was only after several days of discussions that he was persuaded to change his mind, the pill being sweetened by the additional post of the duchy of Lancaster which raised the annual salary to $4000. Once again he had been drawn into a position rather than having marked it out for himself. 
The Portland government of which Perceval thus became a part was confronted by two outstanding problems: Bonaparte's European hegemony and, in numbers at least, one of the strongest parliamentary oppositions since the early 1780s. Perceval's chief responsibility at the exchequer was to find the economic means to confront the threat from abroad. This he did by framing the orders in council which put under blockade all harbours from which British ships were excluded by Bonaparte's Berlin decrees of 1806; and by budgets in 1808 and 1809 which, while imposing no new taxes, made economies in expenditure and raised loans for the war effort at very favourable rates. None of these policies was novel: the orders drew heavily for argument on James Stephen's 1805 pamphlet on the subject; and Perceval's budgets were in line with the orthodox view of the time that the economy could not bear additional taxation. 
The task of confronting the opposition as leader of the Commons proved much more demanding and contentious. Although by no means united in purpose, elements of the opposition harried the ministry on the issues of Catholic emancipation, the conduct of the war (including the related issue of the alleged peculation of the commander-in-chief, the duke of York), and, most persistently as a result of the inquiries and reports of a Commons finance committee, the allegedly excessive patronage available to ministers through places, pensions, sinecures, reversions, and the purchase of seats in parliament. 
After a characteristically hesitant start Perceval responded with a successful resistance. His most uncompromising stand was taken on the Catholic question. In his address to the Northampton electors at the by-election following his appointment to office in March 1807 he nailed his colours firmly to the theme of 'No Popery' -- a theme that became a popular anthem at the subsequent general election. Later he opposed the increase of the annual grant to Maynooth College and led the successful opposition to the Catholic petition of 1808. On other matters, however, he was prepared to compromise. In the case of the defence of the duke of York, for example, he performed brilliantly in the house as the duke's counsel but was realistic enough to recognize that the majority that he secured for a plea of innocence would evaporate unless the duke resigned. This was advice that the king and the duke accepted. 
Perceval was equally realistic about ministerial patronage and power. The most radical proponents of reform sought full disclosure of all places and pensions held by MPs, the abolition of reversionary posts, and the outlawing of the purchase of parliamentary seats; these were hors-d'oeuvres to the main radical dish of 'parliamentary reform', shorthand for an extension of the franchise and a redistribution of seats. Perceval himself had no time for pensions and reversions but he recognized that the existing form of government could be sustained only by some measure of ministerial patronage and was conscious that his own brother, Arden, was one of the best-endowed sinecurists. He consequently sought to moderate rather than resist radical demands. With regard to the disclosure of places and pensions he successfully persuaded its sponsor to require the names of all holders rather than just those of MPs. This had the effect of delaying disclosure until 1810. In the case of a bill to bring to an end the appointment to reversionary posts -- an issue which most closely touched Arden's interests -- he manoeuvred its blockade in the Lords in 1807 and eventually came to an arrangement with its sponsor that limited its operation to one year. As for the sale of parliamentary seats, he successfully weakened Curwen's bill of 1809 which was designed to bring the practice to an end. There, however, his flexibility ceased for on the issue of parliamentary reform he expressed, once again, implacable opposition. 
In the second week of August 1809 the duke of Portland suffered a stroke. With encouragement from the king, his colleagues immediately set about deciding on a successor. The portents for calm and rational deliberation could hardly have been more unpropitious. Earlier in the year Canning, the foreign secretary, had threatened to resign over what he regarded as an incompetence of Castlereagh, the secretary at war. As a result the king had concocted a plan to transfer responsibility for the war from Castlereagh to Canning. However, the plan depended on Castlereagh's being kept in the dark until the end of the parliamentary session, by which time the military expedition to Walcheren, which he had planned and on which war hopes were pinned, would have taken place. As details of the plan became known to a widening circle of cabinet members but not to the hapless Castlereagh, intrigue and recriminations flourished. 
Perceval responded to these developments honourably and realistically. He deprecated the deception of Castlereagh and threatened to resign if it was carried through. As for the premiership, for which he was obviously a leading candidate, he wrote of it as an exceedingly unattractive proposition given the existence 'of so many... of equal or nearly equal importance' within the cabinet (Perceval to Huskisson, 21 Aug 1809, Perceval MSS). Eschewing any eagerness for it for himself he recommended his friend Lord Harrowby to Canning at the end of August. 
The choice of a successor took a further month of elaborate negotiation. Canning responded to the suggestion of Harrowby with the view that Portland's successor should be in the Commons and also indicated that he himself would not serve under Perceval. Perceval, for his part, considered whether his own dignity would enable him to serve under Canning but decided against once Liverpool and others had said that they would not do so. Canning subsequently withdrew from the contest and, fearing that he and his followers would vote against them, Perceval and his colleagues opened a negotiation for a coalition government with the opposition leaders, lords Grenville and Grey, Perceval expressing a willingness to serve under either as home secretary. This too came to nothing, with the result that on 30 September the cabinet recommended Perceval to the king as Portland's successor. The king did not 'pause' in accepting their recommendation and Perceval responded on 2 October that although he would not be found 'wanting in exertion, in industry, in zeal & in duty... in talent & power, he feels his great defects for such a station in such arduous times' ('Later Correspondence of George III', 5.386). As these words and his previous conduct suggest, it was not an advancement he had engineered or sought. 
Perceval nevertheless proved to be a remarkably resilient prime minister. His primary responsibility was to construct and maintain a strong administration at what was a critical juncture in the war. The falling-out of Pitt's friends and the numerical strength of the opposition groups made this an unusually difficult task. As a result of their differences over the succession to Portland, Canning declined to play a part and took with him three of his own followers. In addition, Perceval was unable to come to terms with three other Pittite alumni, lords Hardwicke, Sidmouth, and Melville, the last two of whom commanded significant parliamentary groupings of their own. A further set-back occurred when he was obliged to continue as chancellor of the exchequer, this time unsalaried, as a result of a succession of refusals to fill the post. His nine-man cabinet, which had only two members in the Commons, was therefore unable to command the firm allegiance of all the significant figures in his own party. 
Furthermore the political problems Perceval confronted in his first year in office were exceptionally severe. In the 1810 parliamentary session the government was pressed hard, principally on what turned out to be a disastrous Walcheren expedition, but also on the composition of the finance committee: in fact it was defeated in six major divisions of the Commons, in some cases as a result of the opposition of Canning, Castlereagh, and even the small band of MPs who shared Perceval's evangelicalism -- the 'Saints'. Moreover a potentially fatal blow was delivered in October when the king, the Perceval government's main prop among the neutrals in parliament, lost his sanity. 
Perceval confronted these problems stoutly and with little disposition to trim -- he was, as Whitbread put it on one occasion, 'as bold as brass'. He made some concessions on measures, most particularly on the inquiry into Walcheren, but otherwise steered his own course. Recognizing his weaknesses in parliament, for example, he made several attempts between the spring and summer of 1810 to recruit Sidmouth, Canning, and Castlereagh but declined opportunities to take them in individually, preferring as complete a reunion of Pitt's friends as possible. Moreover in response to the king's illness he did not hesitate to introduce (13 December 1810) Pitt's 'Regency Bill' of 1788, albeit for a year only, which, by placing restrictions on the regent's powers, was bound to give the prince of Wales and his supposed friends, the whigs, a major opportunity to topple the government. That he survived these vicissitudes owed more to luck than to judgement. On the critical issue of the Walcheren inquiry, the government survived as a result of the resignation of the expedition's commander, Lord Chatham, and the fact that waverers and independents in the Commons preferred the government to the opposition. As for the 'Regency Bill', the opposition played its hand poorly with the result that the bill passed with paper-thin majorities in full houses. Moreover the run of good fortune continued when, despite rumours to the contrary, the prince abandoned the whigs in February 1811 and retained Perceval in office, largely from fear of what the king would do should he recover his sanity and find Lord Grenville or Lord Grey his prime minister. 
The satisfactory outcome of the 'Regency Bill' proved to be the turning point for the government. During the year of its operation, despite successfully resisting some of the prince's more extravagant claims upon the taxpayer, Perceval gradually earned his favour. When the restrictions came to an end in February 1812, the prince tried to persuade the whig leaders to join the government but was unsuccessful: thereafter the prince's political support, now as important as that of the king had once been, flowed in the government's direction. Perceval, for his part, adroitly manoeuvred the one loose cannon in his cabinet, the foreign secretary, Lord Wellesley, into resigning in February 1812 and introduced into it lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth. In the summer of 1811 Lord Liverpool had written of Perceval's having 'acquired an authority' in the House of Commons, 'beyond any minister in my recollection, except Mr Pitt' (Yonge, 1.372). By the spring of 1812 the ministry as a whole looked impregnable. 
Perceval's policies also contributed to the improvement in the government's fortunes. His principal objective was to fund the offensive against Bonaparte that the Peninsular campaign had put into motion. To achieve this in his capacity as his own chancellor he pursued much the same policies as he had done when Portland's. He therefore continued with economies and rationalization in government departments. With regard to budgetary policy he did prepare a daring plan to 'raid' the hallowed sinking fund for supplies but, fearing the outcry, dropped it and adopted the traditional policy of raising money by loans as opposed to new taxes -- the loans being based on rigorously scrutinized terms and funded in part by annual exchequer bills, thereby limiting long-term debt. Finally, he produced successful plans of his own to purchase at the best prices the specie necessary for the troops at the front. These were practical policies within an orthodox financial framework: they eschewed newfangled theories of debt redemption and set to one side the fears resulting from the depreciation of paper currency. In fact Perceval was so wedded to his particular recipe for an offensive war that he introduced a bill to make paper currency legal tender -- thereby flying in the face of the growing army of bullionists; and only conceded with extreme reluctance the case for an inquiry into the orders in council (March 1812) on the grounds of its damaging impact on the economy. On the other hand, from the evidence of the Peninsular campaign Perceval could claim with justice that the war effort had prospered under his stewardship. 
Perceval also ploughed a well-established furrow with regard to domestic issues. His principal objective remained resistance to any change in the balance of the constitution whether pressed by British radicals or Irish Catholics. The first test for this resolve came early in 1810 when London-based radicals, including Sir Francis Burdett, the MP for Westminster, construed a standing order that enabled the Commons to clear the gallery of strangers as an attack on the liberty of the press and called for a public debate on the issue. Despite the fact that Burdett had acquired a heroic stature among popular radicals in London, Perceval decided on the sternest possible response -- Burdett's commitment to the Tower for accusing the house of the arbitrary use of its privileges -- and engineered successful motions to this end by two back-bench MPs. This led in early April to one of the most dangerous confrontations ever seen in Hanoverian London between radical and government forces, which nevertheless resulted in Perceval's standing firm and achieving Burdett's imprisonment. He thereby underlined his staunch support for the 'status quo' and seemed to be vindicated in his judgement on the preponderance of conservative over radical forces when Burdett's release in June passed off without incident. 
A similar line of resistance can be detected in his dealings with the Catholic question. The new factors here were the whigs' idea of a royal veto on episcopal appointments to make emancipation more palatable to traditionalists, and the supposed sympathy of the prince of Wales for Catholic claims -- a sympathy which encouraged the Catholic leaders in Dublin to summon a convention to apply pressure when the regency came into effect. Perceval stood firm. In response to the idea of a royal veto he wrote an anonymous pamphlet, 'Six Letters on the Subject of Dr. Milner's Explanation' (1809), which reaffirmed his opposition to emancipation. As for the proposed convention, he was anxious to prevent the ardently anti-Catholic lord lieutenant from acting too firmly against it but was saved any embarrassment when the prince himself effectively scuppered its prospects of success by discovering his obligations to the established church. As in the case of winning the parliamentary battle, Perceval's fortunes as prime minister were strongly affected by the whims of the prince of Wales. 
On 11 May 1812 and at the height of his power Perceval was shot dead in the lobby of the House of Commons by John Bellingham, a merchant with an uncontrollable grudge against the British government, which he focused on the prime minister. Stunned, and fearful that the assassination signalled a popular uprising -- as indeed it was seen to be by popular elements in London and the economically hard-pressed midlands -- the Commons met the following day and voted Jane Perceval $2000 p.a. with remainder to her eldest son, a grant of $50,000 to his family, and a monument to her husband in Westminster Abbey. On 16 May Perceval was given a private funeral at his wife's request and was buried in Lord Egmont's family vault at St Luke's, Charlton, near to his birthplace. In the meantime Bellingham was tried and condemned to death, his plea of insanity being rejected. On 18 May he was hanged. 
Assessments of Perceval's personal qualities made at the time of his death have scarcely been altered by subsequent research. The consensus then was that he was the epitome of virtue: loyal and caring to his family and friends, a devout Anglican, incorruptible, hard-working, and straightforward in his dealings with others. Charles Herries, who knew him well, summed him up as 'the model of a high-minded, high-principled, truthful, generous gentleman, sans peur et sans reproche' (Herries, 1.20). Subsequent research has confirmed this judgement. 
Much the same can be said about the fundamental reason why Perceval became the first acknowledged leader of Pitt's friends -- his debating skill. He could not, of course, rival Pitt: as one contemporary (J. W. Ward) commented: 'He wanted Mr Pitt's splendid declamatory eloquence' ('Letters to Ivy', 157). On the other hand he could deal fully with a subject in plain English and, as the same contemporary noted in comparing him with Pitt: 'in quickness and dexterity as a debater he was (I think) hardly inferior to him. On the whole he appeared to me the most powerful man (independently of his situation) that we had had in Parliament since the death of Mr Fox. ('Letters to Ivy', 196)' These are also judgements that have stood the test of research.On the other hand, assessments of Perceval's role as a minister have changed over time. Before the publication of Gray's biography (1963) he was generally judged a reactionary with insufficient ability for the office of prime minister. Since then Gray and others have put his thoughts and actions into context. Evangelicalism, for example, is now regarded as a much more influential and widespread body of ideas than was once thought, and although Perceval was undoubtedly a member of its most conservative wing, his desire to reform the Church of England and to resist Catholic emancipation was not unpopular. Perceval may have been the first evangelical prime minister but he was not unique in his evangelicalism nor in his belief that the confessional state would not survive Catholic emancipation. Moreover the priority he gave as a minister to winning the war is now seen as part of a continuous official and popular commitment which whig historians, following the contemporary apologists for a peace, conveniently ignored. Further, the financial policies he pursued for that purpose, though not in themselves novel, played an important part in the success of the Peninsular campaign and in the subsequent allied victory, as Wellington later acknowledged. 
That said, Perceval's vision was too limited and his outlook too narrow for him to have had a lasting impact on politics. His philosophy was marooned in the alarmism of the 1790s. He knew little at first hand of the world outside London and is said to have travelled no further than Knutsford and then only once. Moreover, though he filled the highest offices he did so more out of a sense of duty than of ambition. This may be the reason why he was unable to meet the needs of his followers by replacing Pittism with a fresh body of ideas. Perhaps the most appropriate final judgement is that of his great adversary on the Catholic question, Henry Grattan: 'He is not a ship of the line, but he carries many guns, is tight-built, and is out in all weathers' (Gray, 468).

Percival, John (d. 1505), Franciscan friar, appears to have been a native of the midlands, since by 1463 he had become a friar in the Franciscan convent at Lichfield, and between that year and 1465 took orders up to the diaconate in that diocese. He had moved to the Cambridge convent by 12 March 1467, when he was ordained priest in the diocese of Ely, and later transferred to Oxford, where in 1482/3 he paid $6 13's'. 4died on his becoming doctor of theology. Some time between 10 February 1490 and 4 February 1498 he was appointed forty-seventh provincial minister of the English Franciscans. He died, still in office, on 16 December 1505, and was buried in the choir of the Greyfriars Church, London.

Perceval, Jean (d. 1561), Carthusian theologian, was a native of Paris who became a Carthusian monk there in 1522. In 1530 he published a theological work, 'Compendium divini amoris', also at Paris. According to John Bale, followed by later British biobibliographers, Perceval studied at English universities before making his profession; Anthony Wood inevitably claimed that he did so specifically at Oxford. No evidence survives to support these assertions, which probably stem from confusion with an older near-contemporary, the English Franciscan John Percival, who studied at both Oxford and Cambridge. Perceval's 'Compendium' is based upon much theological learning, but he would not have needed to attend an English university in order to acquire this. His attacks on the heresies of the Beguines and Beghards, members of a movement of lay spirituality unrecorded in England, his admiring references to Jean Gerson, formerly chancellor of the University of Paris, and his anecdote of how a few years earlier he had himself been told by a woman of Paris of her son's defying his parents in order to become a Carthusian -- all point to a continental and Parisian background. Made prior of the Dijon Charterhouse in 1534, Perceval was appointed a co-visitor of the French Carthusian province in 1546 and sole visitor two years later. He died on 12 September 1561.

Percival, Robert (1765-1826), army officer and writer, became a captain in the 18th Irish regiment and in 1795 sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, then held by the Dutch. Percival disembarked in Simon's Bay, and was entrusted by General Sir James Henry Craig with the tasks of attacking the Dutch in the defile of Muisenberg and in Wynberg. He was successful in both undertakings. Meanwhile a Dutch fleet under Admiral Lucas, which had been sent to save the colony, was captured. Percival was the first to enter Cape Town (16 September 1796), and there he remained until 1797. 
On his return to Britain Percival published a narrative of his journey, 'An account of the Cape of Good Hope, containing an historical view of its original settlement by the Dutch, and a sketch of its geography, productions, the manners and customs of its inhabitants' (1804). This work, though rather thin, was not uninteresting, and was warmly received. His criticisms of the Dutch settlers, especially of their cruelty to the natives, were severe. But he depicted the Cape climate as the finest in the world, and urged the British government, which had just restored the province to the Dutch under the peace of Amiens, to reoccupy it. 
In 1797 Percival travelled to Ceylon, where he seems to have remained for three years; afterwards he published 'An account of... Ceylon... [with] the journal of an embassy to the court of Candy' (1803). In this he described the effects of Portuguese and Dutch rule, citing instances of Dutch cruelty and treachery, and discussing the population, economy and main towns of Ceylon. Sydney Smith declared the work to 'abound with curious and important information'. Percival died in 1826.

Percival, Thomas (1719-1762), antiquary, son of Richard Percival of Royton Hall, near Oldham, Lancashire, was born there on 1 September 1719. He was brought up a Presbyterian, but joined the Church of England; he was a whig in politics, and he welcomed the Hanoverian succession. On 14 March 1738 he married Martha (1714/15-1760), daughter of Major Benjamin Gregge of Chamber Hall, Oldham, at St Mary's, Oldham. 
In 1748 Percival wrote two pamphlets opposing the high-church clergy and the nonjurors of Manchester. In 1758 he took part with some operative weavers in a dispute with their employers about wages; he subsequently published 'A letter to a friend occasioned by the late dispute betwixt the check-makers of Manchester and their weavers; and the check-makers' ill-usage of the author' (1759). On 13 June 1751 Percival read his paper 'Observations on the Roman colonies and stations in Cheshire and Lancashire' to the Royal Society. This prompted William Stukeley to describe him as 'a learned person who lives in the north, and has taken a good deal of pains by travelling to search out the Roman roads and stations mentioned thereabouts' ('Family Memoirs', 2.244); a shorter paper on the same subject was published in 'Archaeologia', volume 1. He discovered that Kinderton was the site of Roman Condate; and his paper entitled 'Account of a double child' was published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' (68, 1752). Some of the plans in John Aikin's 'A Description of the Country... Round Manchester' (1795) were drawn by Percival. He was elected FRS on 25 November 1756, and FSA on 12 June 1760. 
Percival died in December 1762, and was buried in the vault of St Paul's Chapel, Royton, where his wife had been buried in March 1760; she had died aged forty-five. Their only child and heir, Katherine, married Joseph Pickford of Alt Hill, Lancashire. Her husband was later known as Sir Joseph Radcliffe of Milnesbridge, Yorkshire, into whose possession Percival's collection of manuscript pedigrees and other papers passed. Thomas Percival the antiquary should be distinguished from his namesake, Thomas Percival (1740-1804), the physician, with whom he is often confused.

Percival, Thomas (1740-1804), physician, born at Sankey Street, Warrington, Lancashire, on 29 September 1740, was the son of Joseph Percival (1694-1744), a merchant in Warrington, and his wife, Margaret Orred (1704-1744). His grandfather Peter Percival, the younger son in an old Cheshire yeoman family farming an estate they had long held near Thelwall, Latchford, practised physic in Warrington. His parents died in March 1744, a few days apart, when Thomas, the only surviving son, was three; he was left to the care of an elder sister. In 1750, when he was ten, Thomas Percival MD, his father's eldest brother, a physician in the town and district around Warrington, died, and left him a valuable library and modest private means; Percival was educated first at a private seminary, and then at Boteler grammar school in Warrington, with a year at Manchester grammar school, and he resolved to enter the medical profession. 
Percival was a dissenter, and was known in later life as a staunch Unitarian; in 1757 he is said to have been the first student enrolled at the newly established Warrington Academy, which was founded to give a collegiate education to dissenters. On the completion of his course at Warrington he proceeded to the University of Edinburgh, about 1761, where he formed lasting friendships with William Robertson, the historian, David Hume, and other distinguished men. While still a student at Edinburgh he spent a year in London, where he became known to many scientific men, and through the influence of its vice-president, Lord Willoughby de Parham, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 March 1765. It is said that he was the youngest man at that time on whom that honour had been conferred. From Edinburgh he proceeded to Leiden, where he completed his medical studies, and he took his degree on 6 July 1765. For two years he practised his profession in his native town. On 24 March 1766 he married Elizabeth (1747-1822), the only surviving child of Nathaniel Bassnett, merchant, of London. 
In 1767 Percival moved to Manchester, where he immediately made many friends; he abandoned his original intention of going to London, and lived in Manchester for the rest of his life. He soon made a reputation by contributing papers to the 'Philosophical Transactions', and various periodicals, and his essays, medical and experimental, published between 1767 and 1776, attracted wide attention. In 1775 he published the first of three parts of 'A Father's Instructions'; the concluding part was not issued until 1800. This book for children achieved great popularity. In reply to Richard Price's 'Observations on Reversionary Payments' (1771), Percival wrote his 'Proposals for Establishing More Accurate and Comprehensive Bills of Mortality in Manchester' -- a contribution to the growing interest in demography. This appeared in his 'Essays Medical and Experimental' (1773). 
Percival became a central figure in the cultural circles of Enlightenment Manchester. At his house the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society was brought into being in 1781. He was elected a vice-president on its foundation, and, with the exception of one year, he occupied the presidential chair from 1782 until his death. In 1785 Percival aided the removal to Manchester of the Warrington Academy, and he took a great interest in its management. An endeavour on his part and that of his friends to found a college of arts and sciences proved unsuccessful, but the scheme was accomplished half a century later under the will of John Owens. 
Percival served but briefly as a physician to the Manchester Infirmary, but he helped to lead the reformist faction which took over the governance of the infirmary in 1790 and greatly expanded its services. He helped to form a committee to enforce proper sanitation in Manchester, and advocated the establishment of public baths. He may also be considered as the earliest advocate of factory legislation. On 25 January 1796 he addressed the Manchester committee or board of health on certain evils which had arisen from the growth of the factory system, and he recommended legislative interference in the working conditions of those employed in factories. He helped to found the Manchester Fever Hospital in 1796, and his involvement with infirmary politics led to the publication of his 'Medical Ethics' (1803), which was widely influential in Britain and the USA. Percival's charm of manner and wide learning gained him friends and correspondents among the most distinguished men and women of his time, in both Europe and North America. 
Percival died at his house in Mosley Street, Manchester, on 30 August 1804, leaving a widow, three sons, and more than one daughter. He was buried in the church in which he had been baptized, Warrington parish church, on 3 September, where there is an epitaph by his friend Dr Samuel Parr. A memorial tablet was placed above the president's chair in the rooms of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.

Percy, Alan (c.1480-1560), college head, was the third son of Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland (c.1449-1489), and Maud (died in or before 1485), daughter of William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke. He was ordained by 1 May 1513 when he received the prebend of Dunnington, York Minster, which he resigned before 1 November 1517, and on 6 May 1515 was presented to the rectory of St Anne, Aldersgate, in London, which he held until 1518. Percy was formally admitted as master of St John's College, Cambridge, on 29 July 1516, at the public opening of the college; but he received at John Fisher's behest a half-yearly instalment paid for the six months ending at Michaelmas 1516, which suggests that he took office earlier in the year. He was granted a university grace to incept in arts, graduating MA in 1518. During Percy's short mastership he took an active part in the process of annexing Ospringe Hospital, Kent, to St John's. His expenses between August 1516 and February 1517 included riding to supervise lands, reparations, and sound administration there, and for business in London. 
Percy resigned his mastership by an undated document in the autumn of 1518: on 1 November according to Thomas Baker. On 21 November he was granted an annual pension of $10 and use of the master's low parlour and two inner chambers at St John's. This provision reflected his noble status as brother of the earl of Northumberland, Henry Algernon Percy, to which Fisher had referred in the college statutes of 1516 when awarding him the large salary of $20 as master. This was actually no more than had been paid to Robert Shorton, but Shorton had supervised the building of the college. In a letter of 6 April (year uncertain), Nicholas Daryngton, fellow of St John's, reported to the master that he had sent Percy $5 which the latter had begged for several times, being in need. Percy resigned his pension and room rights on 4 February 1521, the king having on 2 April 1520 granted him a house and garden at Stepney, Middlesex. 
On 25 October 1521 Percy became rector of St Mary-at-Hill, London, and in 1526 he was presented by the earl of Rochford to the rectory of Mulbarton-cum-Keningham, Norfolk. He became in 1539 warden of the College of the Holy Trinity at Arundel, Sussex, which he and two fellows surrendered to the king on 12 December 1545. In June 1527 he acted as a trustee for the estate of his brother the earl of Northumberland who had died on 19 May. In 1530 it appears that he owed Cardinal Wolsey's estate $9 for expediting a suit for the union of certain unspecified parishes. In 1547 he was presented by the dean and chapter of St Paul's, London, to the vicarage of Kensworth, Hertfordshire. Percy was a benefactor to Norwich, having given it a messuage in 1534, and his portrait dated 1549 hangs in the guildhall there. The duke of Norfolk presented him to the rectory of Earsham, Norfolk, in 1558. Percy died before 7 May in 1560 and is alleged to have been buried in St John's College chapel, but the site of his tomb has not been identified.

Percy, Algernon, tenth earl of Northumberland (1602-1668), politician, was born on 29 September 1602 at Essex House, London, and baptized on 13 October at St Clement Danes in the City, the third but eldest surviving son of Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564-1632), and Lady Dorothy Perrott (died 1619), widow of Sir Thomas Perrott, and daughter of Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex. His parents married in 1594 and later quarrelled over the ninth earl's belief that his wife had not honoured the marriage contract. Moreover, the Devereux connection turned sour when Dorothy's brother Robert, the second earl of Essex, far from becoming an asset to the family, became a serious liability owing to his disobedience and later rebellion against Elizabeth I. The couple were eventually reconciled and Algernon had two sisters, Dorothy (1598-1659), who married Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester, and Lucy, later countess of Carlisle (1599-1660) ['see 'Hay, Lucy], and a brother, Henry Percy, Baron Percy of Alnwick (c.1604-1659). 
The ninth earl, a domineering father, controlled the education of Algernon even while imprisoned in the Tower of London from 1605 to 1621 for suspected complicity in the Gunpowder Plot. Algernon, who was styled Lord Percy until 1632, frequently visited his father, remaining with him for four or five days consecutively, as the ninth earl strove to limit his wife's influence. His letter to the twelve-year-old's tutor before he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, is characteristic. After explaining 'that many worthy spirits in this kingdom are lost by the neglect and ignorance of fathers', he proceeded to enumerate his son's defects, since his virtues soon would 'plead for themselves if he have any'. These defects fell under the general heading of a pale and sallow complexion and 'abundance of moisture'. He was a phlegmatic youth, more inclined to 'bashfulness' than to lively spirits; in fact, he was unlikely to be 'passionate of anything'. With this unpromising material, the tutor, Daniel Horsmanden, was to produce a sound Latin scholar with a little Greek who could use the terms of the arts, logic, and rhetoric. According to the ninth earl, Algernon would become an 'inward man' with the attributes of a judge (Syon MS P.I. 3x). In 1609 he had written an 'Advice' to his son, instructing him in personal, family, and estate management (Alnwick MS 322. 102). He had learned these lessons through bitter experience, and was at pains to ensure that his son, of whom he seemed not to have a high opinion, would be taught how to conduct his life. 
In Easter term 1615 Algernon matriculated as a fellow-commoner from St John's College, Cambridge, and was admitted to the Middle Temple in London the following August. At Cambridge he was under the tuition of Edward Dowse and was created MA in 1616; in the same year he was created a knight of the Bath. He and Dowse embarked on a continental tour in 1618, and travelled in the Netherlands, Italy, and France. Algernon returned to England in 1624 and is said to have joined his father at court. In January 1629 he married Lady Anne ('bap'. 1612, died 1637), the eldest daughter of William Cecil, second earl of Salisbury. The union was much against the wishes of his father, who blamed the first earl of Salisbury for his imprisonment in the Tower, declaring that the blood of Percy would not mix with the blood of Cecil 'if you poured it in a dish' (De Fonblanque, 2.370). The ninth earl did not, however, prevent the match, believing in his son's right to choose a wife. After his marriage Algernon visited the Percy estates in the north, the family having been prevented from living there since the time of the seventh earl in 1569. Anne died of smallpox on 6 December 1637, having had five daughters, of whom two survived into adulthood. Commenting on Algernon's loss, a friend said that passion had the least outward power on him of any man he knew. 
Percy sat as MP for Sussex in 1624-5 and as member for Chichester in 1625-6. He was summoned to the Lords in his father's barony as Lord Percy, taking his seat in March 1626, and was a leader of the anti-Buckingham faction within the house. In the following November he was appointed joint lord lieutenant of Cumberland, Northumberland, and Westmorland. Upon the death of his father in November 1632 he became the tenth earl of Northumberland. 
The new earl felt the weight of Charles I's policy of 'thorough', having been obliged to pay off relief of $7000 on an estate valued at $12,750 at his accession. Nevertheless, he seized the opportunity to travel with Charles on his coronation trip to Scotland in 1633. Northumberland tried to attach himself to the court, but was fined in June 1634 for living in London against the king's general order of 1632. In fact his sister complained that he was so busy playing the courtier that he had little time left for his family. At the queen's urging, he was admitted to the Order of the Garter in 1635 after at least one earlier rejection. Clearly he was winning acceptance, finally to be rewarded with command of the ship money fleet in March 1636 and again in February 1637. As admiral of the ship money fleet, the king's most effective fighting force, he began to play a major role in Charles's government. Almost immediately he pressed for naval reforms, including 'girdling' leaks, lowering high galleries, replacing rotten cordage, proper victualling procedures, and improved recruitment. Northumberland ran foul of the lords of the admiralty, having submitted his reforms directly to the king and privy council. The man primarily responsible for his admiralty appointment, Thomas, Viscount Wentworth, chided him: 'A very small belief might be persuaded that Commissioners of the Admiralty would not be well pleased with the prosecuting of abuses in the Navy, especially where the complaint went immediately to his Majesty without calling in upon them by the way. (Strafford, 2.43)' The new admiral did succeed in ousting three Catholic officers, having pressed the oath of supremacy on the fleet early in his tenure. Though almost certainly not a puritan, he displayed an anti-Catholic bias throughout his life.Northumberland went to sea with the fleet in the summer of 1636. Its primary mission was to force the sale of licences on Dutch fishing boats in waters claimed by England. Surprised, many Dutch captains purchased the licences along with assurances of protection from Dunkirk pirates. If they refused, their nets were cut. Strongly pro-French, Northumberland was less enthusiastic about transporting Spanish money to the Netherlands in July. The summer campaign of 1637 was much less successful as the Dutch fished in convoys. Six ships of the fleet under the command of Captain Ramsborough did, however, succeed in avenging the raids of Sale pirates, by successfully attacking their stronghold and rescuing 271 English sailors. 
Though Northumberland had begun to make influential enemies at court such as Cottington and Windebank, he also had powerful friends, particularly Thomas Wentworth and Archbishop William Laud. Yielding to their persistent urging, Charles made Northumberland lord admiral on 13 April 1638, the first appointed since the assassination of Buckingham in 1628. It was intended that Northumberland would hold the office until the duke of York's majority. In the event, he held it until his commission was revoked by Charles in late June 1642. The earl became gravely ill from mid-April to July 1638. Recurrent illness hindered his exercise of the many powers conferred on him by Charles. The possibility also exists that he may have claimed illness to avoid abhorrent responsibilities. With his recovery in July, Northumberland was appointed one of the eight members of the important privy council subcommittee for Scotland. This committee was created to determine England's response to the Scots' rebellion against the prayer book. Wentworth, who was in Ireland, was not present for the initial meetings of the committee. However, in a letter of July 1639 he introduced his ideas through his close friend and client, Northumberland. This outlined the Straffordian policy that was to precipitate two wars with Scotland, necessitating the calling of the Long Parliament. Though he was the channel for Wentworth's ideas, Northumberland profoundly disagreed with his belligerent policy toward Scotland. The marcher lord heritage of the Percys had convinced him of the danger of war with the Scots, especially with an under-financed and ill-disciplined army. Moreover, should the Scots invade England, many of his estates in the north would be occupied. Wentworth was convinced that the English people would rally to the king in a war with the Scots; Northumberland was not. This disagreement finally drove a wedge between the two friends, especially as Wentworth had saddled Northumberland with responsibility for prosecuting the second bishops' war, advising the king to appoint him general of the forces in the north in January 1640. Another of Northumberland's illnesses prevented him from joining the army, so he was not directly involved in its defeat. His attitude towards the campaign, however, was entirely defeatist. He was one of two in the committee for Scotland who opposed the dissolution of the Short Parliament on 5 May 1640, for which he earned the disfavour of the king, widening the breach with Wentworth, now earl of Strafford. His disillusionment was expressed after the utter defeat of the ragtag army at Newburn in August: 'Never man hath been so used, as the King our master, in all the counsels that have been given him concerning this war by those persons whose judgments he only trusted for governing of these affairs' (Collins, 2.691). Northumberland had not been an effective general, having been more concerned with the unconstitutional application of martial law than with preparing the army to fight; but he can be credited with clear-sighted assessment of the folly of challenging the Scots with an unpaid army. 
When the Long Parliament met in November 1640 Northumberland was one of the critics of royal policy. In fact he became the highest-ranked member of Charles's government to join parliament in the civil war. He refused the king's request to perjure himself in Strafford's trial, and his depositions both for the prosecution and the defence were damaging. He was ill when the Lords voted on the attainder, but there can be no doubt that he had rejected his friend and benefactor. In the hysteria of the time, he may even have feared prosecution as a Straffordian. 
By the time of Strafford's trial Northumberland had shown signs of his intent to persevere with the king's opponents. In December 1640 he told his brother-in-law, the earl of Leicester, that he could secure from parliament the vacant lord lieutenancy of Ireland for him. He added that soon Charles would be obliged to listen to parliament. Shortly after Strafford's trial he persuaded his brother, Henry, to write a letter revealing a plot to use the army against parliament to rescue Strafford. Northumberland, urged by Pym, allowed Denzil Holles and John Hampden to copy the letter for publication. Clarendon refers to this incident as the first sign of Northumberland's defection. 
In addition to his wealth and prestige as lord admiral, Northumberland's support was a key prize for parliament. In November 1641 he obeyed a parliamentary order to prepare four ships to take arms and ammunition to Ireland. In the same month he wrote that he favoured excluding bishops from the House of Lords, but would not commit himself on the grand remonstrance. In January 1642 he headed the list of lords who protested against the failure to censure the duke of Richmond for breach of privilege when he suggested that parliament be adjourned for six months. In February parliament made him lord lieutenant of Sussex, Northumberland, Pembrokeshire, and Anglesey; and in the same month he enthusiastically voted for the militia bill. Parliament's control of the navy was critical in the defeat of the royalists, and the lord admiral was the primary agent. Too late, on 28 June 1642, Charles revoked Northumberland's commission. Ever the man of honour, he laid it down on 1 July. Three days later, he was appointed to parliament's committee of safety. 
Why did a man so favoured by Charles I rebel? According to Clarendon: 'Of those who were of the King's Council and who stayed and voted with the Parliament, the earl of Northumberland may well be reckoned the chief, in respect of the antiquity and splendor of his family, his great fortune and estate, and the general reputation he had amongst the greatest men, and his great interest by being High Admiral of England. (Clarendon, 'Hist. rebellion', 2.537)' He then enumerates all Northumberland's offices and honours, concluding 'which was such a quick succession of bounties and favours as had rarely befallen any man who had not been attended with the envy of favourite' (ibid., 538). Great men had to make lacerating decisions in the early 1640s and Northumberland's was based primarily on constitutional principle, mixed with family tradition, and fear of being labelled a Straffordian. 
In the manuscripts of Alnwick Castle there is a document entitled: 'Questions made at the holding of a court between the Lord Algernon Percy and Mr. Francis Powlton' (Alnwick MS 521, fols. 41-77). This manuscript, intended for the instruction of the young Algernon, presents the constitutional position of the common lawyers. Asserting the antiquity of the balanced constitution, the dialogue argues strenuously against unfettered royal prerogative in favour of the rule of immemorial law and the requirement of parliament to represent the kingdom's interests. The subsequent behaviour of the earl of Northumberland before and during the civil wars certifies that he assimilated the lessons of this dialogue. Writing to his friend, the attorney-general John Bankes in June 1642, Northumberland said: 'we believe that those persons who are most powerful with the King do endeavour to bring Parliaments to such condition that they shall be instruments to execute the commands of the King, who were established for his greatest and most supreme council... but let us have our laws and liberties and privileges secured to us. (G. Bankes, 'Story of Corfe Castle', 1853, 122-3)' The Percy tradition of rebellion also had its effect. The sixth through to the eighth earls died violently in rebellion against the crown, and the ninth earl suffered a long imprisonment at the hands of James I. Furthermore, Northumberland was the nephew of the rebellious earl of Essex. Religion, on the other hand, was not a powerful factor in his decision. He was certainly anti-Catholic, but there is little evidence that religion had a powerful hold on him. Likewise, the Percy estates had prospered under the Stuarts once the ninth earl attended to their management. The tenth earl, having continued the tradition of sound management, had no reason to feel economically aggrieved under Charles's rule. 
When the war went badly for parliament in 1642-3, however, Northumberland wavered. He hoped that parliament would reward him with reappointment to the admiralty, but its choice, driven by the radicals in the Commons, was the earl of Warwick. Appalled by the reality of war at Edgehill and Turnham Green (where he was probably in arms), he became a leader of the peace party. Never bold, his abhorrence of fratricidal bloodshed was compounded by parliamentary defeats. D'Ewes reports that Northumberland's shift to the peace party was definite in March 1643. The earl led the parliamentary delegation at the Oxford peace negotiations in the following April, where Charles, negotiating from strength, yielded little. On 18 April, the day of his return from Oxford, he struck Henry Marten with a cane because Marten had intercepted and opened a letter from Northumberland's young wife, Lady Elizabeth ('c'.1608-1705), second daughter of Theophilus Howard, second earl of Suffolk, whom he had married on 1 October 1642. This was but one episode in the looming confrontation between the war and peace parties that culminated in physical threats to some lords outside parliament on 5 August, orchestrated by Lord Mayor Pennington in the hope of arresting Northumberland and other leaders of the peace party. 
In June 1643 Northumberland was accused of complicity in the Waller plot, but D'Ewes reports that although Henry Marten pushed to prosecute him, Waller could not substantiate the charges. After the tumult of 5 August, having been unable to persuade his cousin, the third earl of Essex, to support further peace efforts, Northumberland retired to his Sussex estate, Petworth, while other peace lords defected to the royalist headquarters at Oxford. It is clear that he was tempted to follow them, but his nature counselled caution. What he waited on was the outcome of negotiations between parliament and the Scots. Always ambivalent toward Scotland, Northumberland preferred not to invite the Scots into England's war, while recognizing that the best hope for parliamentary victory lay with an alliance. The solemn league and covenant, signed in late September, paved the way for his return to active involvement in parliament. In fact, despite this absence, he was the most regular attendee of Lords' committees from August 1642 until the end of 1644. He took the covenant on 30 October 1643, having already been appointed to the Westminster assembly the previous June. On 18 February 1644 he became the first chairman of the committee of both kingdoms, faithfully participating throughout its life. Baillie may have put his finger on the key to Northumberland's co-operation when he wrote that the earl would be a supporter of the Scots on the committee now that they had occupied his lands in the north. 
Northumberland definitely moved towards the war party in 1644, though he continued to spearhead peace efforts. According to Clarendon: 'the repulse he had formerly received at Oxford upon his addresses thither, and the fair escape he had made afterwards from the jealousy of the Parliament, had wrought so far upon him, that he resolved no more to depend upon the one or to provoke the other, and was willing to see the King's power and authority so much restrained that he might not be able to do him any harm. (Clarendon, 'Hist. rebellion', 3.495)' In April 1645 he broke ranks with the peers, registering one of four Lords' votes for the self-denying ordinance. In the previous month he had signalled his intentions by protesting against the removal of forts and garrisons from Fairfax's command, as well as the inclusion of a clause in Fairfax's orders to protect the king's person. He was a strong supporter of the New Model Army, and in this he was no doubt influenced by his servant, Robert Scawen, who chaired parliament's army committee. On 18 March 1645 Northumberland was given charge of the king's two younger children, the duke of Gloucester and Princess Elizabeth; it was reported that the duke might be made king with the tenth earl as lord protector should Charles refuse further negotiations. This occurred after the failure of the treaty of Uxbridge in February, where Northumberland led the parliamentary delegation to a king whose position was weakening. The earl had managed the preparations for the treaty in both the Lords and the committee of both kingdoms. Failure at Uxbridge solidified Northumberland's alignment with the war party, now known as the Independents. His letters in 1645 and 1646 show an unusually high level of commitment to the parliamentary cause -- though there were limits, as his refusal to vote for the attainder of Laud in January had signalled. 
Northumberland was particularly active in parliament as the first civil war drew to a close. He attended an unusually large number of committees in summer 1646, including the committee to analyse the king's letters taken at Naseby. In October he was appointed to the committee to draw up the ordinance for the sale of bishops' lands, having earlier been added to the committee of the revenue as a reward for his support of the self-denying ordinance and the New Model. He also pursued personal business intensely at this time in an attempt to recover his northern rents. The Percys were not popular with their northern tenants as a result of their long enforced absence and the harsh administration of the ninth earl. Moreover, most of the tenants were royalists. Until February 1647 most of the northern estates were occupied and sometimes looted by the Scots. Northumberland drew his servant, Hugh Potter, from his parliamentary duties (as MP for Plympton in Devon) in 1643 to look after his interests in the north. Two-thirds of the Percy revenues came from their northern estates, mostly in Yorkshire and Northumberland. However, with royalist and Scots occupation annual northern revenues of about $10,000 sank to under $3000 in 1643, recovering only slowly to $8800 by 1646. Discouraged by the difficulty of collecting his northern rents, the tenth earl sold $9000 worth of northern lands in 1647 and a further $7000 in 1648. Additional complications were created by parliament's efforts to collect subsidies once the north came within its orbit, whipsawing tenants between taxes and rents. County committees obviously favoured tax over rent collection. 
Northumberland took advantage of his good standing with parliament to submit a bill for $42,000 in losses from the war, mostly arrears in rent; he was granted $10,000. He also pushed unsuccessfully to have the full allowances paid for his custody of the king's children. After the fall of Oxford in July 1646 the duke of York was added to his charge, and the expenses for all three children greatly exceeded his reimbursements. In February 1648 he asked to be relieved of the king's children, declining responsibility should they escape. In fact the duke of York escaped in April and, after an investigation, the tenth earl was absolved of blame. At his suggestion, in May 1649 the duke of Gloucester and Princess Elizabeth were handed over to Northumberland's sister, the countess of Leicester. 
In January 1647 Northumberland combined with Manchester and the presbyterian peers to draw up proposals that might be acceptable to the king. These were sent to the queen through the French ambassador, Bellievre. In February the earl was nominated to the important committee of Irish affairs. However, as parliament and its army fell out over pay and power, Northumberland sided with the army. He was among the group of nine peers who left parliament for the army after riots in and around Westminster in July, signing an engagement with the army for the restoration of the freedom of both houses on 4 August. The meeting between army officers and lords was held at Northumberland's Syon House and his servant, Scawen, as chair of the army committee, moderated the meeting. This was the apex of the tenth earl's courtship of the army. As one of the commissioners for the four bills, he then made one more effort in December 1647 to treat with the king, but Charles rejected the proposals. 
The general hardening of antagonism towards Charles following the second civil war pushed Northumberland in the opposite direction. He opposed the vote of no further addresses to the king in January 1648, and it was said that no man at the time was so hard to understand as Northumberland. In September and October he was one of fifteen parliamentary commissioners at the Newport treaty, making the opening speech to the king. He, along with Holles and Pierrepoint, stayed into November in a desperate attempt to reach an acceptable accommodation with Charles, but their efforts proved fruitless. On 2 January 1649 Northumberland led the Lords' votes against the ordinance to try the king, as well as the proposition that it was treason for Charles to levy war against parliament. He had become a defender of the king against a Rump Parliament which desecrated his long-held commitment to a balanced constitution, declaring: 'The greatest part (at least twenty to one) of the People of England were not yet satisfied, whether the King levied war against the Houses, or the Houses against Him. And if the King did levy war first against the Houses, we have no Law to make it Treason in Him so to do. And for us to declare Treason by an Ordinance, when the matter of fact is not yet proved, nor any Law extant to judge it by, is very unreasonable. (C. Walker, 'History of Independency', 2, 1650, 55-6)' Northumberland withdrew from public life during the Commonwealth and protectorate. He took the engagement to be loyal to the Commonwealth, but he was not trusted by the military regime. Having been relieved of the charge of the king's children in May 1649, he no longer had official duties. His sister, the countess of Carlisle, had been examined and confined to the Tower in March for her involvement with the earl of Holland in the second civil war. One of Northumberland's prized possessions in the north, Wressel Castle, was destroyed in 1650, having earlier been protected from slighting. In the same year he successfully defended himself against an accusation of delinquency, preventing confiscation of his estates. Throughout the interregnum he was forced to defend himself against a claim from the City companies regarding a loan of $50,000 to Charles I in 1640 for which he and several lords stood surety. In spring and summer 1655 he was under house arrest. Thurloe, whose spies had already intercepted at least one letter to Northumberland, believed that the earl had instructed Hugh Potter to prepare his northern tenants to assist in Penruddock's rising. As a result the tenth earl was reported to have had a three-hour interview with Cromwell. Towards the end of the protectorate Northumberland declined the invitations of both Oliver and Richard Cromwell to sit in the upper house of their parliaments. Expressing once again his cherished constitutional views, he told Richard that, 'till the government was such as his predecessors have served under, he could not in honour do it' ('Clarendon State Papers', 2.432). 
the restoration of Charles II brought fresh hope to Northumberland. He thrust himself into the fluid politics of early 1660 by organizing the Suffolk House cabal, named after the house that came to him through his marriage with Elizabeth in 1642. Meeting in April, the cabal included Manchester, Holles, St John, and Pierrepoint. Northumberland had an earlier meeting with Monck at which he believed he had secured Monck's support. The plan of the cabal was to have those who sat in 1648 constitute the House of Lords and then impose on Charles II the conditions offered to his father at Newport. In so doing Northumberland could realize his constitutional convictions while assuming considerable political power. However, the cabal collapsed when Monck supported the Convention Parliament at the end of April. Charles II arrived in May and Northumberland rushed to secure his favour. He did, however, unsuccessfully support a general act of indemnity, opposing the questioning of those involved in the late king's execution, saying that 'though he had no part in the death of the King, he was against questioning those who had been concerned in that affair; that the example might be more useful to posterity and profitable to future kings, by deterring them from the like exorbitances. ('Ludlow's Memoirs', ed. C. H. Firth, 2 1894, 267-68)' By again asserting his belief in limited monarchy, he did not endear himself to the new king and he was rewarded with mere trappings without any substance of power. Northumberland's condition was aggravated by a report that he attempted to have Hyde (later earl of Clarendon) excepted from an act of indemnity because he was thought to have recommended to Charles I that he should treat with Spain and not with parliament. 
On 31 May 1660 Northumberland was sworn as a privy councillor and in August he was made lord lieutenant of Sussex, to be followed with the lord lieutenancy of Northumberland in September. He was diligent in his county responsibilities, organizing the militias, and in 1662 enforcing the Clarendon code. In April 1661 he was the lord high constable at the coronation of Charles II. However, the earl of Manchester was his only friend at court and, more importantly, Clarendon had good reason to oppose him. Northumberland requited him by voting for his impeachment in November 1667. 
Having failed to secure power Northumberland spent most of his time at Petworth during the 1660s. He continued to discharge his lord lieutenancies, particularly in Sussex; for example, in January 1667 moving to disarm popish recusants while complaining that others were not equally diligent. In country retirement he retained his interest in the navy, compiling documents detailing its condition. He died on 13 October 1668 at Petworth, where he was buried in that month. He was succeeded by his only son of his second marriage, Jocelyn; who died aged twenty-six in 1670. The countess Elizabeth survived until March 1705. In the December following the tenth earl's death, Jocelyn received an impressive testimonial from a former royalist, Sir William Temple, describing Northumberland as a man of truly noble quality who acted with restraint, constancy, honesty, integrity, and compassion, but not familiarness; who did all this in spite of the disadvantage of living in a divided age. Jocelyn also received a touching letter from the duke of York praising the kindness that Northumberland had shown him during his period of custody. 
Clarendon, who knew Northumberland well, but was not unbiased, called him 'the proudest man alive', continuing 'If he had thought the King as much above him as he thought himself above other considerable men, he would have been a good subject... He was in all his deportment a very great man' -- a person who behaved with dignity and independence more characteristic of a feudal baron than a seventeenth-century lord (Clarendon, 'Hist. rebellion', 3.495; 2.538). He was not a man of great abilities, but he enjoyed the reputation and influence of such a person. 'Though his notions were not large or deep, yet his temper, and reservedness in discourse, and his unrashness in speaking, got him the reputation of an able and a wise man; which he made evident in the excellent government of his family, where no man was more absolutely obeyed; and no man had ever fewer idle words to answer for; and in debates of importance he always expressed himself very pertinently. (ibid., 2.538)' Clarendon's assessment in some ways echoes the ninth earl's characterization of young Algernon to his tutor, Daniel Horsmanden. 
In the final analysis, the tenth earl was a man of high principle and dispassionate demeanour, more suited to lead in settled times than the tumult of civil war. As his older sister Dorothy remarked in 1637, he was cold to his friends, 'but there is more truth and fidelity in him than in 1000 Hollands and as many Henry Percys' ('De L'Isle and Dudley MSS', 6.92).

Percy, Algernon, fourth duke of Northumberland (1792-1865), landowner and philanthropist, was born at Syon House, Middlesex, on 15 December 1792, the second son of Hugh Percy, second duke of Northumberland (1742-1817), and his second wife, Frances Julia (1752-1820), third daughter of Peter Burrell of Beckenham, Kent. As a second son in wartime formal education was dispensed with, and he joined the navy at the age of twelve (3 May 1805), serving as midshipman in a succession of frigates in the Mediterranean in Admiral Collingwood's fleet and taking part in the bungled action off Toulon in 1808. Made lieutenant in 1811, he was promoted to commander in 1814, and in the last year of the war was acting captain of the 'Caledonia', Lord Exmouth's flagship. His naval career ended in 1815, when he was only twenty-three, and he went on half pay and did not see active service again; but on the reserve list he became rear-admiral in 1850, vice-admiral in 1857, and admiral in 1862. Although subsequently credited with a distinguished naval career (Burke, 'Peerage'), it seems likely that this was a sycophantic piece of flattery, and that his elevation to the peerage as Baron Prudhoe in 1816 owed more to his father's wealth and position (he was one of the regent's set) than to his own achievements. 
Prudhoe took his seat in the Lords but seldom spoke, and indeed was seldom in the country, his political career, such as it was, coming only some time after his succession to the dukedom in 1847. In the 1820s and 1830s he travelled extensively in Africa, being one of the early English aristocratic explorers of ancient Egypt, bringing back a collection of over 2000 objects, later housed in Alnwick Castle, while in 1834 he helped to finance, and accompanied, the astronomer Sir John Herschel's expedition to Cape Town to observe the southern constellations. This gained him an honorary DCL from Oxford in 1841, and his continuing interest in astronomy led him to meet the costs of the publication, in 1847, of the results of Herschel's Cape observations of double stars and nebulae. A larger commitment to scholarship grew out of his friendship with Edward William Lane, whom he first met in Cairo in 1826, and whose return to Egypt in 1842 to collect materials for his Arabic lexicon was both suggested by, and financed by, Prudhoe; he supported Lane and his work for the next twenty-three years, and the first volume of Lane's 'Lexicon', published in 1863, was dedicated to the duke, 'the originator of this work, and its constant and main supporter' (Lane, 1.ii). In recognition of the importance of his contributions as patron of science and learning he was elected FRS, FSA, and FRGS. After the duke's death his widow continued this patronage of the 'Lexicon', the final volume appearing in 1892, sixteen years after Lane's own death. 
On 25 August 1842 Prudhoe married the 21-year-old Lady Eleanor Grosvenor (1820-1911), eldest daughter of Richard Grosvenor, second marquess of Westminster, whom Peel described as 'homely enough looking, and very short' (GEC, 'Peerage'). It might be thought that marriage into the Grosvenor family would have whiggish effects, but in the event Prudhoe's one venture into high politics was in the high tory interest when (as duke of Northumberland) he accepted office in Derby's 1852 'Who? Who?' ministry as first lord of the Admiralty, although the duke regarded himself as a non-party naval person, and Victoria had remarked of the previous year's abortive negotiations with Derby that 'The Duke of Northumberland was the only person not properly belonging to the Protection Party who had accepted office' ('Letters of Queen Victoria', 2.369). He held office for only ten months and it was an unhappy experience, as he found himself falsely accused by his own parliamentary secretary, Augustus Stafford, of abusing Admiralty patronage by making a key appointment on merit and not on the customary party grounds, when in fact the duke had believed he was appointing 'a sure Tory -- otherwise Captain Lushington is not an officer I should have appointed' (R. Blake, 'Disraeli', 1966, 321). Stafford was zealous in trying to mobilize as much government patronage as possible in the tory interest, and tried to revive party use of dockyard jobs, discontinued in 1849, and his 'electioneering imprudences compromised [the duke] to some extent: he thought his colleagues less forward than they might have been to take up his defence... and on the making up ['sic'; perhaps breaking up?] of Lord Derby's government he withdrew from practical politics' ('Disraeli, Derby and the Conservative Party', 227). In the meantime, as a sailor intent on promoting the interests of the Royal Navy and in particular increasing its steam power, the duke had done his bit to bring down the Derby government by insisting on raising the Admiralty estimate by $800,000, thus blowing a hole in Disraeli's already rickety budget (ibid., 87). 
As a young man Lord Prudhoe, it was said, 'was of a playful disposition... He was tall and fair and wore his hat just a little bit on one side' (Locker-Lampson, 84). If that was so he put childish things behind him on succeeding to the dukedom in February 1847, on his elder brother's death, and quickly assumed, at least in public, the solemn and earnest demeanour of one who took the moral and social responsibilities of his position as Northumberland's chief landowner very seriously. Already in 1852 ministerial colleagues called him the Doge, and although there was a touch of malice in this he was definitely conscious of his own dignity. The Percys were accustomed to being treated as the uncrowned kings of Northumberland, and Algernon the Good, as he came to be called, earned this position by his good works and not simply by his possessions and lineage. He was in the happy position of having a large and growing income from coal royalties, as well as vast landed estates, and his 191,000 acres and income of over $150,000 placed him among the half dozen wealthiest aristocrats of the time. He and his wife had no children to provide for, and without any family constraints on his expenditure he was free to indulge his plans for improvements and embellishments of his inheritance. The detailed application of his ideas for improving the agricultural estate, chiefly by field drainage and by providing modern farm buildings, was the work of Hugh Taylor, previously the estate's colliery agent, whom the duke at once made into the chief commissioner in sole charge of managing the estate. The enabling force, which supplied well over $0.5 million for investment in these things and in cottage building, was the duke's own will, while the more bizarre manifestations of faith in new technologies, such as the creation of the post of his grace's manager of the steam plough and the experiments with raw sewage irrigation through a grid of cast iron pipes, were pure ducal whim. His personal contribution to the welfare of his tenants and workers was most directly expressed in his benefactions, which included ten new churches, as many new schools, half a dozen new vicarages, and a number of new model self-righting lifeboats, the design of which he sponsored. His liberality and hospitality at great dinners for his chief tenants, and even larger but less lavish dinners for their labourers, earned him the genuine affection of many Northumbrians, and at the national level his charitable activities made him president of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Westminster and Middlesex hospitals, the Seamen's Hospital Society, the Westminster General Dispensary, the Royal Institution, and the Royal United Service Institution, and vice-president of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Naval Benevolent Society. 
Of all his works, however, the duke was proudest of the vastly expensive 'restoration' and embellishment of Alnwick Castle, carried out to the designs of Anthony Salvin, the foremost castle architect of the day, at a cost of $320,000. Completed in the last year of his life this enterprise recreated a romantic medieval border fortress which was habitable, tolerably comfortable, and supplied with modern hydraulically powered gadgetry in kitchens and dining rooms. Viewed in the long term this piece of feudal extravagance probably created the Percy family's most valuable and enduring asset. The duke and his duchess, although they gave convincing performances of their feudal role when at Alnwick, preferred living in the original Smithson family seat in the North Riding, Stanwick Hall, where they could keep 'less state', or better still staying in Kielder Castle on the north Tyne, 'where he and the Duchess pass a couple of months with never more than two friends, the house being so small that the dinner-room is also the sitting-room' (Ticknor, 307). It was, however, at Alnwick that the duke died on 12 February 1865, lying in state in the castle for two days while the tenantry and local notables filed past, then going by special train to London for another lying in state in Northumberland House, where admission was by ticket only for the 5000 who attended, before burial in the Percy chapel of Westminster Abbey on 25 February. He was succeeded by his first cousin, the second earl of Beverley. The dowager duchess, Eleanor, was provided with Stanwick Hall and its 5000 acre estate, and lived there until she died in 1911.

Seymour, Elizabeth, duchess of Somerset (1667-1722), courtier and politician, was born on 26 January 1667 at Petworth, Sussex, and baptized there on 29 January. She was the only surviving daughter and heir of Joceline Percy, eleventh earl of Northumberland (1644-1670), and Elizabeth ('c'.1646-1690), youngest daughter and coheir of Thomas Wriothesley, fourth earl of Southampton, lord treasurer of England from 1660 to 1667. She was known as Lady Elizabeth Percy from her father's accession to the earldom in 1668 until her marriage in 1679. At her father's death on 21 May 1670, having survived a brother, Henry, who died in 1669, and a sister, Henrietta, who died soon afterwards, she inherited the vast Percy estates and became one of the most sought-after heiresses in England. Upon the marriage of her mother to her second husband, Ralph Montagu (later first duke of Montagu), in 1673 she was placed under the guardianship of her grandmother, Elizabeth, dowager countess of Northumberland (1622/3-1705), at Petworth. In 1679 the dowager countess arranged a marriage for her twelve-year-old granddaughter with the fifteen-year-old Henry Cavendish, styled earl of Ogle (1663-1680), son and heir of Henry, second duke of Newcastle. Ogle, who appears to have been sickly, died on 1 November the following year. 
In 1681 the dowager countess arranged a contract of marriage for her granddaughter with Thomas Thynne (1647/8-1682) of Longleat, Wiltshire, the wealthy and famous 'Tom of Ten Thousand', worth $10,000 per annum. Lady Elizabeth shrank from living with her much older husband, pleading that 'there may be more sin and shame in people's living together than in parting' ('CSP dom.', '1682', 49). It is unclear whether she fled or was allowed by Thynne to go abroad to the Netherlands in November 1681. There she was sheltered by Sir William Temple, the English ambassador to The Hague, and sought the assistance of her mother and Ralph Montagu to free her from Thynne. There is evidence of legal proceedings to dissolve the marriage on the grounds of a previous commitment to marry on Thynne's part. The marriage was in fact ended by Thynne's murder on 12 February 1682. While riding in his coach down Pall Mall he was set upon and killed by a group of assailants hired by Count Karl Johann Konigsmark. Konigsmark was an adventurer who had become attracted to Lady Elizabeth on a visit to the English court the previous year. While the assailants were soon captured, tried, and executed Konigsmark was acquitted and left England. Lady Elizabeth denied any knowledge of the plot but the scandal would forever cast a shadow on her name. 
Lady Elizabeth returned to England in March 1682. On 30 May, after an initial refusal, she married Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset (1662-1748). The original contract stipulated that he was to take the name Percy but she released him from this obligation upon the attainment of her majority. The marriage was well known to be unhappy, largely because of Somerset's imperious temper and overweening pride; according to William Legge, first earl of Dartmouth, Somerset 'treated her with little gratitude or affection, though he owed all he had, except an empty title, to her' ('Bishop Burnet's History', 6.34n.). Nevertheless, under Queen Anne the Somersets made an effective political team. He was master of the horse and a member of the cabinet; she was named a lady of the bedchamber on 12 May 1702. The duchess seems to have been widely esteemed at court for her gracious disposition and impeccable manners. Dartmouth thought her 'the best bred, as well as the best born lady in England... She maintained her dignity at court, with great respect to the queen and civility to all others' (ibid.). It is remarkable that this testimony comes from a tory but it is not in fact unique. Towards the end of the queen's reign the tory Anne Wentworth, countess of Strafford, remarked 'If the Duchess must be out, she will leave the Court with a very good grace, for everybody is pleased with her good breeding and civility' (De Fonblanque, 507). 
From about mid-reign a genuine friendship developed between the queen and the duchess of Somerset. This was not least because, unlike Sarah Churchill, duchess of Marlborough, and Abigail (later Lady) Masham, the duchess of Somerset 'never press'd the Queen Hard, nothing makes the Queen more Uneasie than that' ('Diary of Sir David Hamilton', 49). Nevertheless Jonathan Swift thought her 'a most insinuating woman' (Swift, 206). Both the Churchill circle and the tories were convinced that the duchess connived with her husband to bring down the Godolphin ministry in 1710 and to thwart the Harley ministry at every opportunity thereafter. Certainly the Somersets' attendance on the queen stepped up from the summer of 1709. The Churchills suspected that the duchess used this contact to point out the frequent absences from court of the duchess of Marlborough. While the duchess of Somerset was not averse to engaging in political intrigue she tended to do so without the clumsiness of her whig rival, whom she supplanted as groom of the stole on 24 January 1711. Rather her very courtliness could be an effective weapon; thus while attending the queen in the House of Lords during the Sacheverell trial both she and Jane, Lady Hyde, stood with ostentatious correctness while the duchess of Marlborough chose to sit down. At the end of 1711 it was the duchess of Somerset who showed Anne a copy of the 'Daily Courant' that contained Johann Kaspar von Bothmer's memorial protesting the preliminary articles of the treaty of Utrecht. As a result Swift thought that the queen's apparent wavering of support for the ministry over 'No Peace without Spain' was 'all your d -- d duchess of Somerset's doings' (Swift, 435). And yet in each case the duchess could claim that she was doing nothing that was improper or overtly political. 
The Oxford ministry was particularly anxious to neutralize the duchess's influence after this debacle. In the winter of 1711-12 there was a concerted ministerial campaign to have her removed from her bedchamber post. Swift seconded this with 'The Windsor Prophecy', which referred none too subtly to the duchess's chequered past: '
Beware of Carrots from Northumberlond. 

Carrots sown Thyn a deep root may get 

If so be they are in Sommer set 

Their Conyngs mark thou, for I have been told, 

They Assassine when young, and Poison when old. 

' The charge was unfair and it redounded to the author's discredit in the queen's eyes. Nevertheless, when the duke of Somerset was dismissed as master of the horse early in 1712 it looked as if tory hopes might be fulfilled, since he sought to force his wife to resign her court appointments as well. It was only after a concentrated effort by Anne, assisted by William, Lord Cowper, and the queen's physician, Sir David Hamilton, that Somerset was persuaded to allow his wife to remain in office, thus maintaining a whig presence around the queen. In late January, upon the completion of these negotiations, Hamilton wrote 'going into the Queen after the Duchess of Somerset came out from Her, I never saw the Queen Look with a more pleasant and Healthful Countenance, saying that Now, it was done' ('Diary of Sir David Hamilton', 40). Despite this outcome, and Hamilton's constant urging that the duchess spend less time at Petworth and more time at court, recent historiography finds that the whigs received little tangible advantage from her proximity to the sovereign. This is hardly surprising, given the duchess's characteristic discretion and Anne's growing aversion to being badgered by her bedchamber attendants. Somewhat ironically this failure to press the queen goes far to explain why Somerset was, according to Dartmouth, 'by much the greatest favourite, when the queen died' ('Bishop Burnet's History', 6.34n.). During the desperate final days of his ministry the earl of Oxford paid tribute to that favour and her reputation for intrigue when he wrote 'Send for the Dchs of Somerset -- no body else can save us' (Holmes, 216). In fact there is no evidence that she would -- or could -- have done so. 
In tribute to her birth and rank the duchess of Somerset was chief mourner at the funerals of Mary II in 1695 and Queen Anne in 1714. She died at home at Northumberland House, London, of breast cancer, on 23 November 1722 and was buried on 13 December in Salisbury Cathedral. She gave birth to at least four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Charles Seymour, styled earl of Hertford, was baptized on 22 March 1683 but died and was buried by the following 26 August. Her second, but first surviving, son was Algernon Seymour ['see under 'Seymour, Charles, sixth duke of Somerset], also styled earl of Hertford in his father's lifetime, Baron Percy from 1722 (the Lords mistakenly assuming that the duchess had held that title), and seventh duke of Somerset from 1748. Her son Percy, MP for Cockermouth from 1718, died in 1721 and her son Charles died in 1711; both had remained unmarried. Her three daughters included Elizabeth (died 1734), who married Henry O'Brien, eighth earl of Thomond (died 1741); Catherine (died 1731), who married Sir William Wyndham, baronet; and Anne (died 1722), who married Peregrine Osborne, third duke of Leeds.

Percy, George (1580-1632/3), colonist in America, was the eighth and youngest son of Henry Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland (c.1532-1585), and his countess, Katherine Neville (1545/6-1596). He was born at Petworth, Sussex, on 4 September 1580, and was educated at Eton College, Gloucester Hall, Oxford, and the Middle Temple. Georgy Percy was a sickly child, apparently troubled in his youth by epilepsy and other ailments. Current medical thinking held that patients in such cases often prospered in warmer climates. Accordingly he embarked in 1602 on a sea voyage to the West Indies. Little is known about this adventure, but he reappears visiting his brother Sir Richard Percy in Ireland in summer 1603. This early experience of the Americas must surely help to explain why a younger son of a prominent English nobleman is found, five years later, among the band of settlers which established the first enduring English colony in the New World, near the mouth of the James River, in what is today the state of Virginia. 
There was another reason. After the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in November 1605 George's brother Henry Percy (1564-1632), the ninth earl, was arrested under suspicion of complicity. Although never shown to have been directly involved, the earl remained a prisoner in the Tower of London for nearly sixteen years, a grievous blow to the fortunes of his family. For a well-travelled younger brother, the prospect of distant horizons and new possibilities must have been welcome. George Percy was almost certainly encouraged in his plans by the earl himself, who collected an impressive geographical library while in the Tower, and retained an abiding interest in exploration. 
At first Percy was carried away with the excitement of his new surroundings. The land appeared fertile, and the Virginian Indians seemed friendly. However, his dream rapidly turned sour. The settlers fell out among themselves, supply ships failed to appear, disease and starvation took hold. Treacherous acts on both sides blighted relations with the Native Americans, and a series of horrific slaughters ensued. On one occasion he writes movingly of his unsuccessful attempts to spare the lives of an American Indian 'queen' and her children in the face of his men's implacable determination that all should be put to the sword. In 1609, as a senior member of the colony's ruling council, he deputized as its president for six months between the departure of Captain John Smith and the arrival of Sir Thomas Gates, and he did so again for just over one month in 1611. But given the colony's continuing misfortunes and his own recurring ill health he then decided to return home, setting sail for England in April 1612. 
Under the terms of a family settlement Percy enjoyed a small annuity derived from rents on lands within the Percy estates in Cumberland and Yorkshire. During his years in America, however, his brother the earl agreed to take this income in return for settling debts which George Percy incurred with London merchants. This was convenient at the time, but the earl was subsequently plagued by opportunists who came to him seeking payment for debts allegedly run up long before. Northumberland's patience with the ostensible creditors eventually wore thin. 'This', he wrote at the foot of one such petition, 'I granted not, for I have too many of this nature brought me every day' (Syon MS X II I, box 21, bundle g). 
Percy, as has been noted, kept some form of journal in America. While the original has been lost, extracts were published by Samuel Purchas under the title 'Observations gathered out of a discourse of the plantation of the southerne colonie in Virginia by the English'. As it comes down to us, this account breaks off in 1608. In the mid-1620s, however, his former commander John Smith published a self-congratulatory memoir. Percy then wrote his own version of events between 1609 and 1612 to counter Smith's 'many untrewthes'. He had sided against Smith in the faction struggles that had engulfed their colony, and his 'Trewe relatyon', which survives in his own hand and remained unpublished for three centuries, is a valuable corrective to Smith's hugely popular book. 
Later years are thinly documented. In 1615 he considered joining one Captain Bud on a voyage to the Amazon delta, not least because, as he put it in his letter seeking support from the earl, 'my fitts here in England are more often, more longe and more greevous, then I have felt them in other parts neerer the lyne [the equator]' (Alnwick MSS, letters and papers, vol. 10, fol. 220). Four years later he assumed the role of his family's champion when one Richard Plumleigh slandered the earl's recently deceased countess. He challenged Plumleigh to a duel, and the privy council was forced to compose the quarrel. Thereafter we are left with little more than family tradition, which has it that he commanded a company when war broke out again in the Low Countries in 1627. From the indirect evidence available, he was alive when the ninth earl died in November 1632, but died during the following winter. 
In a family of eight brothers only the earl produced a male heir, and the young Lord Percy, later the tenth earl, was made much of by both his father and his numerous uncles, each man seeing the boy as the best hope of restoring their family's fortunes. George Percy named a fort on the Chesapeake Algernon's Fort, in the child's honour, and later dedicated the 'Trewe relatyon' to his nephew in very graceful terms. 
There is no contemporary evidence to suggest that George Percy ever married. Again, however, family legend credits him with a wife in Virginia. When the genealogist T. C. Banks visited America in the early 1800s he met two brothers Percy -- landowners in Virginia -- who claimed descent from George. Banks declared that, if what they said was true, they would be 'the right male heirs of the earldom of Northumberland of the 'de novo' creation, the ancient one being suspended in the crown' (Banks, 1.369). The claim was never pursued.

Percy, Sir Henry de (d. 1272), baron, was the eldest son of William de Percy (1191x3-1245) and William's second wife, Elena, daughter of Ingram de Balliol. Early in 1249, while still under age, he made a proffer of $900 to gain control of his lands and marriage. He was knighted before June 1257, the year in which he served in Henry III's army in Wales. In 1259 Percy was listed among the friends and allies of the earl of Gloucester in an agreement with the Lord Edward, indicating that he initially supported the baronial reform movement. However, he afterwards sided with the king, and in 1263 was among those attesting Louis IX's attempted settlement of the dispute between Henry III and the barons in which the French king favoured his fellow monarch. Percy accompanied the king in the siege of Northampton in April 1264 and then helped defend Rochester Castle against Simon de Montfort. He was captured at the battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264 and held prisoner until the battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265. 
Percy married, in September 1268, Eleanor, elder daughter of John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (died 1304), and Alice de Lusignan, half-sister of Henry III. According to later genealogies they had three sons, William, John, and Henry Percy, but contemporary evidence can be found only for the last two. Henry died on 29 August 1272, and was buried at Sallay Abbey, Yorkshire, where his wife was later buried with him. He was eventually succeeded by his son Henry.

Percy, Henry, first Lord Percy (1273-1314), magnate, was the son of Sir Henry de Percy (d. 1272) and his wife, Eleanor. Born after his father's death, at Petworth, Sussex, about 25 March 1273, he had succeeded his elder brother, John, as heir before 11 June 1294. He married Eleanor (died 1328), sister of Sir Richard Arundel, with whom he had two sons, Henry Percy and William (died 1355). 
After taking part in the Welsh expedition of 1294 Percy began a decade of active involvement in the Scottish wars of Edward I. He served during the siege of Berwick and on its capture was knighted by Edward I on 30 March 1296. He fought at the battle of Dunbar on 27 April 1296. From then on he was one of Edward I's leading commanders. In September 1296 he was made warden of Galloway and Ayrshire and justiciar in Dumfries, offices he was to hold during several periods in the years that followed. In July 1297 he was one of the English lords who received the submission of Scottish prelates and nobles. After the defeat of John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (died 1304), at Stirling Bridge in September 1297, together with Robert, Lord Clifford, he raised forces for the invasion planned to restore the English position. In 1298 he was one of six English magnates who furnished 500 heavy cavalry for Scotland, his share being fifty. He took part in the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300. On 5 April 1306 he was appointed the king's lieutenant and captain of all men-at-arms, both horse and foot, in the counties of Lancaster, Westmorland, Cumberland, Ayr, Wigtown, Dumfries, and the whole of Galloway to repulse the rebellion of Robert I. He and his retinue were in the army that Edward I was leading when he died at Burgh-on-Sands on 7 July 1307. 
The record of his services in the Scottish wars demonstrates that Percy was one of Edward I's principal commanders, second only to a few leading earls. His rewards were commensurate with the scale of his services. On 20 February 1299 he was granted all the estates in both England and Scotland that had belonged to Ingelram de Balliol, a cousin, deceased, apparently because the heir was a rebel. Apart from two manors in England, this grant brought Percy the barony of Urr and Red Castle in Angus. In 1304 he received the earldom of Buchan. His tenure of this was short-lived, since the Scottish earl returned to the allegiance of Edward I. Recompense for the loss of Buchan, however, was handsome and also a testimony to the importance of his services. In, perhaps, April 1306 he was granted the earldom of Carrick forfeited by the rebellion of Robert I. According to the contemporary chronicler Walter of Guisborough in February 1307 (or thereabouts) Percy was besieged by Robert in Turnberry Castle until relieved by a force led by Edward I. For a time, therefore, he controlled at least part of his earldom of Carrick. 
Both his status as a leading baron and his involvement in the Scottish ambitions of Edward I meant that Percy was bound to have an active role in the period of crisis that followed the accession of Edward II. At the beginning of the reign he appears to have been on good terms with the king and his favourite, Piers Gaveston. On 16 June 1308 he was one of the small group before whom a number of letters patent to Gaveston's advantage were read out and sealed by the king; these included the grant of the earldom of Cornwall. At some point thereafter he joined the opposition to the court. While not himself one of the lords ordainer, on 5 October 1311 he was one of the group of councillors who announced the ordinances of reform to the people in the churchyard of St Paul's. His motives for supporting the cause of reform can only be conjectured, but it is reasonable to assume that he saw the need for peace in the kingdom in the light of the collapse of the English position in Scotland, a matter in which he had a substantial vested interest. Indeed, unlike most of the magnates who were later allies, he had responded to the king's summons to meet him at Northampton the previous August in order to proceed against Robert I. However, from October 1311 onwards he was a trusted ally of the ordainers, as the grants he received during their period of control demonstrate. On 20 March 1311 he was granted the keepership of the temporalities of the bishopric of Durham. On 2 December 1311 he was made justice of the forests beyond Trent and on 18 December keeper of Bamburgh Castle. 
Percy remained steadfast to the ordainers' cause after Edward II's revocation of the ordinances and his rehabilitation of Gaveston, events that led to his loss of the justiceship of the forests beyond Trent and his replacement by Gaveston. He played an important part in the plan to capture Gaveston, the northern of the four zones into which the kingdom was divided for this purpose being entrusted to him and Roger Clifford. Together with the earls of Pembroke and Surrey he besieged Gaveston in Scarborough Castle and received his surrender on 19 May 1312. He took no part in Gaveston's execution. Although his lands were then seized, he was a beneficiary of the eventual settlement between Edward II and his opponents, being pardoned on 16 October 1313. 
From the point of view of Percy himself, and from that of his family's fortunes in succeeding decades and centuries, the most important event in his career was his acquisition of the castle and barony of Alnwick in Northumberland. This estate was conveyed to Percy by Antony (I) Bek, bishop of Durham (died 1311), by a charter dated 19 November 1309; but the transaction must have been a more complicated one than this grant suggests, since in an agreement of 1 April 1310 the bishop had a right of repurchase until the following Michaelmas. According to a contemporary source Bek held the estate in trust for William, an illegitimate son of William de Vescy (d. 1297), the last Vescy lord of Alnwick, but there is no convincing evidence in support of this story. And there is nothing to suggest that, if fraud did occur, Percy was a party to it. He apparently paid a market price, possibly assisted by a loan from Italian merchants (the Bellardi of Lucca). His acquisition of this estate laid the foundations of his family's position on the borders with Scotland. He himself became the leading landowner, lay or ecclesiastical, in Northumberland. Although there is no direct evidence of his motivation, it is a fair inference from the circumstances of his career that the acquisition of Alnwick resulted from his involvement in the Scottish wars (which must have led to close contacts with Antony Bek). In 1309 the hope of recovering his gains in Scotland must have been a real one. The castle and barony of Alnwick would provide both a staging post between Scotland and his estates in Yorkshire and a base for his involvement in further warfare in Scotland. 
Percy died between 2 and 10 October 1314, within twelve months of the royal pardon for his part in the events that led to the death of Gaveston. It is reasonable to suppose that he was already ill when he received his summons to the campaign that was to end in the defeat at Bannockburn, since there is no evidence of his presence there. He was buried at Fountains Abbey, and was eventually succeeded by his eldest son, Henry.

Percy, Henry, second Lord Percy (1301-1352), soldier and magnate, was born probably in February 1301, the elder son of Henry Percy, first Lord Percy (1273-1314), and Eleanor Arundel (died 1328). Percy was given custody of Alnwick Castle and all his father's lands (except those in Yorkshire) in October 1318. Despite his youth Percy attended the meeting of northern magnates held by Thomas, earl of Lancaster, in May 1321. But he stayed loyal to Edward II. He did homage and received livery of his inheritance on 26 December 1321. He married Idonea (died 1365), daughter of Robert, Lord Clifford. 
He was summoned for service against the Scots under the command of Andrew Harclay, earl of Carlisle, on 26 March 1322, in which year he was also knighted. The following September he was serving in Northumberland under David Strathbogie, earl of Atholl, being enjoined to give sufficient attention to the defence of Alnwick Castle. He was involved in relations with Scotland for the remainder of Edward II's reign; he was, for example, one of the English hostages for the safety of the earl of Moray in April 1323, and one of the commissioners appointed to keep the truce with the Scots in July 1325. 
Percy supported Queen Isabella against the Despensers when she returned to England in October 1326. The change of regime, faced as it was with a raid into Northumberland a few weeks after the coronation of Edward III, led to an especially active involvement in relations with the Scots. On 14 February 1327 the king's council entrusted Percy with the general defence of the north of England. In return for a fee of 1000 marks ($666 13's'. 4died) he was to serve until the following Whitsunday with a force that included 100 men-at-arms and as many of his own men as he chose. This was joined two days later with the custody of the marches of Scotland for the same period. On 23 April 1327 he became one of the ambassadors appointed to negotiate with the Scots. On 5 September 1327 there followed an appointment as chief warden of the marches until the following Christmas, and on 9 October 1327 he was one of the two envoys appointed to negotiate a final peace with Scotland. 
During his stay in Scotland Percy displayed a concern that was to dominate his career for the next six years -- his territorial claims and the opportunities for further gains there. On 28 July 1326 King Robert confirmed to Percy the Scottish lands that had belonged to his father 'by hereditary right or in any just and legitimate manner whatsoever' (Nicholson, 57). The lands in question were the barony of Urr in Galloway and Red Castle in Angus. Percy was one of a number of 'disinherited' who had lost lands held, or claimed, in Scotland. There can be no doubt that he had used his role in the negotiations with the Scottish king to advance his personal interests. His claim was, in fact, legally dubious, since on 3 June 1331 he paid the rightful heir the sum of 200 marks for the surrender of his claims. This, however, suggests that at least for a short time he enjoyed his Scottish inheritance. 
A new turn in England's relations with Scotland occurred with the invasion of Edward Balliol, who was seeking to regain the Scottish throne lost by his father and assisted by some leading disinherited. At first Percy's own conduct was cautious. But, as soon as Edward III abandoned his policy of non-intervention, he became a leading supporter of Balliol. On 9 May 1333 he undertook to serve Balliol within Scotland for life, saving his allegiance to the king of England, with a contingent of either 100 men-at-arms or 30 knights. In return Balliol promised him lands in Scotland worth 2000 marks a year. In less than three months Percy had virtually gained his promised reward. The first instalment on 29 July 1333 occurred shortly after the surrender of Berwick -- the peel of Lochmaben and the valleys of Annandale and Moffatdale. Another grant of 5 September 1333 gave him a collection of forfeited holdings in the Cause of Stirling to the value of $629 16's'. 8died On 20 September 1334 the Vale of Lochmaben grant was increased to 1000 marks a year, bringing the total of Percy's reward to just below the promised amount. 
The importance of Percy's services, especially during the siege of Berwick, may have led Balliol to ignore the claims of another of the disinherited -- Edward de Bohun, a younger son of Humphrey (VII) de Bohun, earl of Hereford, who had received Lochmaben and Annandale from Edward I in 1306. What made possible a settlement of the dispute that flared up between Bohun and Percy was the fact that these lands were within the area of southern Scotland ceded to Edward III in perpetuity by Balliol. On 20 September 1334 Percy surrendered his lands to the English crown. In return he and his heirs received from Edward III a grant worth 1000 marks a year -- the castle, constabulary, and forest of Jedburgh, an annuity of 500 marks a year from the customs of Berwick, and the custody of the castle there. 
Nor was this all that Percy gained from the Scottish wars of the early years of Edward III. At the king's accession he had entered into an indenture of war to serve for life with a company of men-at-arms in return for an annual fee of 500 marks. On 1 March 1328 the crown assigned to Percy, in return for the surrender of this fee, the rights to the reversion of the estates of the Clavering family in Northumberland, which included the castle and barony of Warkworth. When such indentures of war were declared illegal in parliament in 1331, the indenture was surrendered by Percy; but the king, with the assent of parliament, then regranted the estates to Percy. The last Clavering died in 1332; and the reversion of all his holdings in Northumberland to Percy was completed with Clavering's widow's death in 1345. 
By the summer of 1334 rebellion had shattered Balliol's hold on his kingdom. For the next three years Edward was engaged in efforts in his support. His immediate response, made on 3 August 1334, was to appoint Percy and Ralph Neville chief wardens of the marches and of the king's lands in Scotland. In January 1335 Percy defeated a Scottish raid in Redesdale, and in July of the same year he played a leading role in a grand two-pronged offensive, being the leading English commander in a force that Balliol led from Berwick. He accompanied Edward III on expeditions into Scotland in 1336 and 1337. From then on, during years in which the Scottish conflict was absorbed into the wider one with France, Percy, whether or not holding a formal appointment, played an integral role in the defence of the north of England. His importance in this respect achieved recognition on 28 April 1340, when he was appointed one of the councillors who were to advise the young Prince Edward during Edward III's absence overseas. 
Percy's main achievement in the years that followed was the part he played in the defence of the north against the grand invasion launched by David II in 1346. When the English king and his eldest son left for the campaign in France that was to culminate in their victory at Crecy, Percy was made one of the custodians of the kingdom. He was one of the leaders of the army collected to repel the Scots and led the first division in the victory at Nevilles Cross on 17 October 1346. According to the Lanercost chronicle he was too ill to take part in the invasion of Scotland that followed. 
The capture of the Scottish king and the death or capture of leading Scottish magnates at Nevilles Cross created opportunities similar to those of 1333-4. On 26 January 1347 Percy entered into an indenture with Lionel of Antwerp, earl of Ulster, Edward III's second son, who was guardian of England during his father's absence in France, to serve in Scotland for a year with a contingent of 100 men-at-arms and 100 mounted archers. The invading army was under the command of Edward Balliol who led one contingent from Carlisle, Percy leading the other from Berwick. But, presumably because of the pressure of the siege of Calais on English resources, the expedition was not strong enough to effect the reconquest that was necessary if Balliol was to regain his throne. It did, however, regain English holdings in southern Scotland, thus strengthening Percy's control of his Jedburgh estate. 
In the history of the Percy family and that of England the second Percy baron of Alnwick deserves at least an equal place with his father, the first baron. His father had begun the family's involvement in the Scottish wars and given it the leading position in Northumberland. The son did much more than consolidate his father's gains by acquiring the Warkworth estates close to Alnwick. The total failure of Balliol to keep his Scottish throne may have meant that Percy lost for ever the lands that he had been granted in the area of Stirling. But the dispute with Bohun over his other gains at Balliol's hands turned out to his territorial advantage. Added to his holdings in Northumberland, his compensation from the English crown locked him firmly into the defence of England against the Scots and into English ambitions in the northern kingdom, thus giving his heirs very great territorial power that made them an essential part of the English crown's policies towards Scotland. 
Percy died at Warkworth Castle on 26 February 1352. His testament, dated 13 September 1349 (a date that suggests fear of death from plague), enjoined interment at Sawley Abbey; but he was buried at Alnwick Abbey. One of his bequests reveals that while pursuing his territorial ambitions in Scotland and military activity in the north of England he had contemplated going on crusade to the Holy Land. He left the sum of 1000 marks (in Florentine florins), which he had collected for this purpose, to his heir, with the wish that the latter go in his place. 
With his wife, Idonea, he had six sons -- Henry Percy, his heir, Richard, Roger, Robert, Thomas ['see below'], and William -- and four daughters -- Margaret, who married first Robert Umfraville, son and heir of Gilbert, earl of Angus, and second William Ferrers, third Lord Ferrers of Groby (1333-1371) ['see under 'Ferrers family (per. c.1240-1445)], Isabel, who married William, son and heir of Sir Gilbert Aton, Matilda, who married John, Lord Neville of Raby, and Eleanor, who married John, Lord Fitzwalter. 


Despite his privileged background and youth there is nothing to suggest that Thomas Percy was not a competent and conscientious diocesan by the standards of his time. His surviving register (consisting of formal administrative documents) contains no indications to the contrary, and he was benefactor to the fabric of his cathedral. His testament, apart from bequests to close relatives, is notable for the concern it displays for the poor and for the welfare of quite menial members of his household. He did not hold any secular offices, though the explanation may lie in his youth and early death. The available records reveal that he was a trier of petitions in all save one of the parliaments of the years 1363-9. On 1 February 1362 he was present at Westminster at Edward III's confirmation of his treaty with the king of Castile. The main interest of Bishop Percy's career must be seen in its testimony to the position and influence achieved by his father and grandfather, especially in the light of his appointment to a bishopric that lay totally outside the area of Percy power and influence.

Percy, Henry, third Lord Percy (c.1321-1368), magnate, was the eldest son of Henry Percy, second Lord Percy (1301-1352), and his wife, Idonea (died 1365), daughter of Robert, Lord Clifford. During his father's lifetime the younger Percy followed the sort of career in the king's wars expected of the son and heir of a leading baron. His father's constant involvement in the north meant that he could give his energies to campaigning in France. He served under the earl of Arundel in March 1344, and in August 1346 he was at Crecy. He then transferred to service under the earl of Lancaster both in June 1347 and in November 1349, in Gascony. 
Entry into his inheritance in 1352 did not present a continuation of the sort of opportunities that had faced Percy's father. The character of relations between the English crown and Scotland had changed. By the time of the second Lord Percy's death Edward III was to all intents and purposes leaving Edward Balliol to his fate. Instead, he gave his attention to the exploitation of the captivity of David II, king of Scots, so as to secure a settlement that would detach the Scots from the French alliance. It was certainly a policy that made use of Percy, since it also required attention to the defence of the border. 
In July 1352 Percy was joint warden of the marches, and in September 1355 he became keeper of Roxburgh Castle and sheriff of the county for two years. On 30 January 1356 he was one of the witnesses to Edward Balliol's surrender of the kingdom and crown of Scotland to Edward III; and he then took part in the invasion of Scotland that followed. In July 1356 he was once again joint warden of the marches and was then employed in the negotiations that led to the treaty of Berwick of October 1357. But the period of truce that ensued left no opportunity for martial exploits on the border. His role in the affairs of the region became essentially a diplomatic one, involving him in the protracted negotiations over the ransoming of David II and efforts to achieve a permanent settlement between England and Scotland. 
The changed conditions on the border did permit Percy to participate in Edward III's military efforts in France. In September 1355 he was marshal of the royal army at Calais. In 1359-60 he took part in the English king's grand campaign aimed at the capture of Rheims and his coronation as king of France. Percy was one of the English magnates at Calais on 24 October 1360 who swore to observe the terms of the treaty of Bretigny. As in the case of Scotland, however, there were no further opportunities for a military career in France for the remainder of his life. As a leading magnate on 19 October 1364 he witnessed at Dover the treaty for the marriage of Edmund, earl of Cambridge, the king's youngest son, to Marguerite, duchess of Burgundy. 
Percy's contemporary, the chronicler of Alnwick Abbey, summarized his place in his family's history with the judgement that, 'content with the lordship [dominio] left him by his father, he wished to obtain the lands or possessions of no one' (Dickson, 41). But these words contain an element of distortion since they ignore the nature of Anglo-Scottish relations in his time. What territorial gains might have come his way if he had been faced with the sort of opportunities available to his father and grandfather can only be the subject of speculation. Nor could he have been lacking in any kind of territorial ambition, since he chose as his second wife the sole heir to a baronial estate. 
Percy had married first Mary (died 1362), daughter of Henry, third earl of Lancaster, and second Joan (died 1368), daughter and sole heir of John, Lord Orreby. With his first wife he had two sons: Henry Percy, his heir, and Thomas Percy. With his second wife he had a son who died in his father's lifetime and a daughter, Mary, aged two at her father's death. Percy died on about 18 May 1368, probably at his castle of Alnwick, and was buried in Alnwick Abbey.

Percy, Sir Henry (1364-1403), soldier, was born on 20 May 1364 at Alnwick, the eldest son of Henry Percy, first earl of Northumberland (1341-1408), and his first wife, Margaret (died 1372), daughter of Ralph Neville, Lord Neville of Raby (d. 1367). 
Knighted by Edward III in 1377, the young Henry Percy quickly began to make a name for himself as a successful war-captain, 'who above all else desired feats of arms, always the first in the skirmish at the barriers' ('OEuvres de Froissart', 13.210). He was first armed in November 1378, when he assisted his father in recapturing Berwick Castle from a band of Scottish raiders. He married Elizabeth Mortimer (1371-1417), eldest daughter of Edmund (III) Mortimer, third earl of March (died 1381), before December 1379. They had two children: Henry Percy, created earl of Northumberland in 1416; and Elizabeth, who married John, Lord Clifford, and, second, Ralph Neville, second earl of Westmorland (died 1484). Percy served in Ireland with the earl of March in 1380, then travelled and crusaded in Prussia and Asia Minor during 1383. It was on the Scottish border, however, that he made his reputation and acquired his nickname, Hotspur, bestowed on him by the Scots as a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack. In May 1385 Percy was appointed warden of the east march and, in the following month, accompanied Richard II into Scotland with his own company of sixty men-at-arms and sixty archers. He subsequently played an important part in securing the line of the royal army's withdrawal, beating off a series of Scottish attacks. Hotspur relinquished the wardenship in April 1386 and was immediately sent to reinforce the Calais garrison, with a company of 100 men, in the face of a rumoured French attack; characteristically, he took the opportunity to lead several raids into Picardy. Between August and October 1387 he had command of a substantial naval force in the channel and attempted, without success, to relieve the siege of Brest. The appellant regime showed their gratitude for these military endeavours by nominating Percy as a knight of the Garter early in 1388 and reappointing him as warden of the east march for three years in June, at the substantial fee of $12,000 p.a. in time of war and $3000 p.a. in peace. Taken unawares by large-scale Scottish raids through the march the same summer, Hotspur caught up with the force of James, second earl of Douglas, at Otterburn in Redesdale. In the confused engagement that followed -- 'as hard an encounter and as well-fought a battle as there could ever be' ('OEuvres de Froissart', 13.219) -- Douglas was killed and Hotspur captured. It is an indication of the public esteem he already enjoyed that the bulk of his ransom, set at 7000 marks, was met by royal gift and parliamentary subscription. 
At large again by July 1389 Henry Percy was appointed warden of the west march for five years in June 1390. Despite the cessation of open hostilities against the Scots and French, his chivalric reputation continued to grow, fostered by displays of prowess at the jousts of St Inglevert in March 1391 and at Smithfield, during the festivities that followed the king's marriage, in 1396. Hotspur was sent on a diplomatic mission to James, king of Cyprus, in June 1393 before taking up the sensitive post of lieutenant in the duchy of Aquitaine, then in a state of near rebellion against the king's grant of the duchy to his uncle, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. He returned to England in January 1395, joining Richard II's expedition against the Irish, before going back to Aquitaine in the following autumn in order to consult with the Gascon estates over their continued opposition to Lancastrian rule. In 1396 Hotspur spent the summer at Calais, moderating and resolving outstanding ransom disputes between the French and English. Such consistent military and diplomatic employment brought with it growing evidence of royal favour. Richard had retained Hotspur for life in January 1391, at a fee of $100 p.a., and he granted him the chief forestership of Inglewood, with power to nominate a deputy, in May 1393. Percy was appointed warden of the east march, in succession to his father, for the exceptionally long term of ten years, in June 1396 and granted wardship of the extensive Umfraville inheritance in Northumberland, free of rent, in January 1399. 
Despite such tokens of royal favour the Percy family viewed with suspicion Richard II's attempts to dilute their monopoly of border office; the town of Berwick was, for instance, removed from Hotspur's command in January 1399. This was one influence on the Percys' decision to support Henry of Lancaster on his return from exile in June. Joining forces at Doncaster, Hotspur and his father accompanied Lancaster on his march south. While the earl of Northumberland played a crucial role in negotiating Richard's surrender, Hotspur was prominent militarily, beating off an attack by dissident Cheshire forces as the Lancastrian army moved towards London in August. The Percys were lavishly rewarded for their support. Within a year of Henry IV's accession Hotspur had been reappointed as warden of the east march for a further term of ten years, with the garrisons of both Berwick and Roxburgh included within his command, nominated as sheriff of Northumberland, and granted the castle and lordship of Bamburgh. He was also made justiciar of north Wales and Chester, and his authority in the region further underwritten by an extensive series of grants, including the castles of Chester, Flint, Conwy, Caernarfon, and Beaumaris, the shrievalty of Flint, the county and lordship of Anglesey, and the custody of the valuable Mortimer lordship of Denbigh. 
These grants gave Percy a virtual monopoly of civil and military authority on the east march and in north Wales, two areas vital to the security of the new Lancastrian regime. In the north Hotspur was able to translate his augmented powers into military success but, as the rebellion of Owain Glyn Dwr gathered strength, his Welsh commands proved unexpectedly taxing. Early in 1400 he and George Dunbar, earl of March, raided through the Lothians; the following autumn he was stationed at Dunstanburgh in order to protect the east march from retaliatory raids in the wake of Henry IV's campaign in Scotland. At Easter 1401 Conwy, one of the Welsh castles under Hotspur's command, was captured by rebels. After conducting the siege to recapture it at his own expense, and successfully negotiating the rebels' surrender, he remained in north Wales for the rest of the summer, co-ordinating the English forays against Glyn Dwr's forces. The king's continuing confidence in Hotspur's military ability was underlined by his appointment as royal lieutenant in north Wales in March 1402 while, in September, he and Dunbar won a considerable victory over an invading Scottish force at Homildon Hill, capturing the earl of Douglas and many other nobles. 
Building on this success against the Scots, Percy and his father sought to make good a royal grant to themselves of the Douglas estates in southern Scotland by besieging the fortress of Cocklaw, near Hawick, in May 1403. In July, however, Hotspur moved south, 'with a small company, feigning peace' (Galbraith and Clarke, 177). Once in Cheshire he issued proclamations accusing Henry IV of oath breaking and tyrannical government, declared his continuing allegiance to Richard II, and, joined by his uncle, Thomas Percy, earl of Worcester, marched on Shrewsbury in order to engage the forces of Henry, prince of Wales. Arriving outside the town on 21 July, however, Hotspur found that the king was there before him and he was forced to give battle against the superior royal forces. The fighting was exceptionally intense, with heavy casualties sustained on both sides, but the Percy forces broke when Hotspur himself, driving his way towards the royal standard, was struck down and killed. His body was taken for burial at Whitchurch, Shropshire, by Thomas Neville, Lord Furnival, but, on hearing that rumours circulated that Hotspur was still alive, Henry IV had the corpse exhumed and displayed it, propped upright between two millstones, in the market place at Shrewsbury. 
Hotspur's rebellion was the final result of the growing discontent felt by the Percys at their treatment by Henry IV. On the march they believed their legitimate territorial ambitions in southern Scotland were being hampered by the king's failure to pay the wages due to them for their war service sufficiently promptly, while their sense of grievance was further inflamed by the favour Henry showed towards George Dunbar. Hotspur and his father had already expressed the frustration they felt on this issue by refusing to hand over to the king the prisoners taken at Homildon. In Wales the continuing success of Owain Glyn Dwr was an additional source of tension. Frustrated by the king's reluctance to contemplate the negotiated settlement with the Welsh he had sought to promote, Hotspur had been forced to accept a substantial reduction in his regional predominance when a unified military command in the principality was created in April 1403 and vested in Henry, prince of Wales. A further, more personal, grievance was Henry IV's continued refusal to ransom Sir Edmund Mortimer, Hotspur's brother-in-law, after his capture by the Welsh in June 1402. This connection by marriage with the Mortimer family, who possessed a plausible claim to the English crown, may have been the decisive consideration in Hotspur's decision to rebel. In the parley before Shrewsbury Henry accused him of ambitions to rule the kingdom in the right of his wife and, in the heat of the battle itself, Hotspur's soldiers set up the cry 'Henry Percy King'. It was a fittingly grandiose epitaph for the most famous soldier of his day, whose military talents, allied to the shrewd political opportunism of his father, briefly secured for the Percy family a pre-eminent position among the English nobility.

Percy, Henry, first earl of Northumberland (1341-1408), magnate and rebel, was the elder son of Henry Percy, third Lord Percy of Alnwick (c.1321-1368), and his first wife, Mary (died 1362), the daughter of Henry, third earl of Lancaster (c.1280-1345). 
Born on 10 November 1341 Percy spent much of his youth in the royal household and in that of his uncle, Henry, duke of Lancaster. On 12 July 1358 he married Margaret (died 1372), widow of William, Lord Ros of Helmsley, and daughter of Ralph Neville, fourth Lord Neville of Raby. His involvement in the affairs of the Scottish border began in his father's lifetime. Despite his youth he was a warden of the marches in 1362, being appointed to negotiate with the Scottish government. In February 1367 he was entrusted with the supervision of all castles and fortified places in the Scottish marches. When he entered into his inheritance in 1368, however, it was France that provided the obvious outlet for martial ambitions: in August 1369 he took part in the 'chevauchee' led by John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and he joined Edward III's brief and abortive expedition in 1372, and Gaunt's expedition of 1373. He was made knight of the Garter on 29 January 1366. 
During these years Percy showed every sign of following a policy of expanding his family's territorial power and influence in the north. In 1373 he bought from the crown the wardship of lands of David Strathbogie, the last earl of Atholl, together with the wardship and marriage of his two daughters and heirs, who were in due course married to Percy's two younger sons. It was also in these years that he began the negotiations which, on the death of Gilbert Umfraville, earl of Angus, in 1381, brought him a substantial share of the Umfraville inheritance. His gains included the castle and lordship of Prudhoe, thus enlarging his wealth and power in Northumberland. 
The events of the Good Parliament of 1376 propelled Percy into the first rank of the kingdom's politicians. When the Commons through their speaker sought the appointment of a committee of lords to assist them in the discussion of grievances, Percy was one of the four barons and bannerets they requested. It may well be that the leaders of the Commons were aware of a personal grievance on Percy's part against one of the court faction -- Alice Perrers. When Percy's father died in 1368, he left a two-year-old daughter from his second marriage who, on her mother's death in May of the same year, became sole heir to the baronial family of Orreby. As a close kinsman who could not inherit, Percy would have had reasonable expectations of a grant of the wardship of his half-sister's lands. Two decades later, indeed, the terms of her testament suggest a close relationship between her and her half-brother. As it was, in December 1369 her wardship and marriage were granted to Sir Alan Buxhull, who by May of the following year had sold them to Alice Perrers. There is certainly evidence that Percy was interested in his half-sister's wardship, since following Alice Perrers's condemnation in the first parliament of the next reign he succeeded in securing the wardship of the bulk of her lands (20 May 1378), with effect from the date of Perrers's forfeiture. In any event, there can be no doubt that Percy played a leading role in the campaign against the court faction waged by the Good Parliament. According to Thomas Walsingham, it was Percy who accused Lord Latimer of suppressing a letter sent to the king and the imprisoning of its bearer. When in due course the chancellor and treasurer were replaced and Alice Perrers excluded from court, Percy was one of the new council appointed. 
When the Good Parliament's successor met in January 1377, Percy more than acquiesced in its reversal of its predecessor's reforms. He had become an active supporter of the court, now openly led by John of Gaunt. His motives can only be guessed. It may well be that he had hopes of crown patronage, including his half-sister's wardship: it is equally possible that he was concerned about hostile activity on the part of the Scots in the summer and autumn of 1376, and saw advantages to be gained from active support of the government. In December 1376 he had been appointed marshal. He was vigorous both in the performance of his duties and in support of John of Gaunt. He accompanied Gaunt, preceding him in procession, when he appeared in person in support of John Wyclif when the latter was summoned before the assembled bishops at St Paul's on 19 February 1377. Percy's use of force to clear a way for Gaunt and himself led to an angry confrontation with the bishop of London, as also did his request that Wyclif be seated. 
The following day a mob of London citizens rioted in defence of the city's privileges and released a prisoner from the Marshalsea by force. Gaunt and Percy had to flee the city and take refuge with the princess of Wales at her manor of Kennington. These events, however, did not ultimately interfere with the undoing of the work of the Good Parliament. When its successor ended, Gaunt and Percy were firmly in control. Percy's membership of the group that held power in the kingdom was marked on St George's day 1377, when his three sons were knighted in company with the heir to the throne, the king's youngest son, and Gaunt's son and heir. The accession of the new king, Richard II, produced evidence of Percy's increased importance. On 16 July 1377 he was created earl of Northumberland and officiated as marshal at the coronation. 
The new earl's career soon took a change of direction. Northumberland had on 8 May 1377 been appointed captain of Calais. But if this indicated an interest in the French war it was quickly dropped. He also gave up the office of marshal. It is quite likely that he wished to avoid a prolonged dispute with Margaret Brotherton over her family's hereditary claims to the office. Certainly experience had shown him that the office was a risky one in terms of the holder's popularity in London if he decided to take his duties seriously. In any case the truce with Scotland was no longer effective, and it was necessary to attend to his interests on the border. He responded to an attack on Roxburgh by the earl of Dunbar with an invasion of Scotland, laying waste Dunbar itself. In November 1378 a Scottish force seized Berwick and the earl and his son Henry Percy (Hotspur) retook it. 
Shortly after this, however, a rift appears to have developed between Northumberland and the government, dominated by John of Gaunt, over policy towards Scotland. When in the summer of 1380 the Scots invaded Cumberland, pillaging Penrith and threatening Carlisle, the government forbade Northumberland to respond. When he attended the council, despite an outwardly friendly reception, he was told to take his complaints to the next marcher court. The government was following a deliberate policy of maintaining the truce with Scotland, being prepared to overlook the occasional provocation of a border raid. It was realized that the 'ad hoc' arrangements hitherto employed on the border, involving either commissions of local landowners with powers lasting only a few months, or the appointment of individual magnates to raise retinues -- Northumberland himself had been employed in this way in the summer of 1380 -- were inadequate to maintain the government's authority, especially if a truce was to be preserved. The result was the appointment of John of Gaunt as the king's lieutenant in the marches towards Scotland, with responsibility for the defence of the north and the power to make truces with the Scots. 
This led to an open feud between Northumberland and Gaunt, which flared up in the course of the peasants' revolt of 1381. When the revolt broke out, Gaunt was on the border engaged in negotiations with the Scottish government. News of the rebels' deep hostility towards himself led him to take refuge in Scotland for a short time. When he returned and began his journey southwards, he expected to receive hospitality from the earl of Northumberland. Instead, he was refused admission to Alnwick Castle. The earl claimed he was acting in Gaunt's interest. In a letter delivered by two of his retinue to Gaunt within sight of the castle walls he gave advice (in which the bishop of Hereford and earl of Stafford concurred) that Gaunt return to Bamburgh Castle and wait there until he was 'well-informed about the estate of the King and the business of the Commons' (Goodman, 81-2). It may well be, however, that there was also some sort of oral message, since according to both Knighton and the Anonimalle chronicle the earl expressed doubts about the king's intentions towards Gaunt. After Gaunt had taken refuge a second time in Scotland, it became clear that there were no grounds for such doubts. 
For Gaunt, a prince of royal blood, the wealthiest magnate in the realm, and the king's lieutenant, the episode was a public humiliation. On his return to England he refused the protection that Northumberland had been commanded by the king to give him. A very public quarrel ensued. It is possible that Gaunt did not throw down his gauntlet, as Froissart relates. But there can be no doubt that a confrontation occurred at a royal council at Berkhamsted on 19 October 1381, when the earl's language offended the king as well as adding further insult to Gaunt. He was temporarily arrested for 'lese-majeste' and had to appear to answer Gaunt's charges in parliament in November 1381. The upshot was his public apology. 
Gaunt's behaviour in this episode can be explained simply in terms of his need to compel a leading earl to understand that he could not insult the foremost prince of royal blood with impunity. In contrast, Northumberland's motives were much more complicated than simple caution during the crisis of the peasants' revolt and a desire to avoid involvement in Gaunt's unpopularity. As the leading magnate in the border region he may well have resented Gaunt's supreme role as royal lieutenant there. It is, however, possible to detect a motive of potential territorial rivalry behind this concern over Gaunt's authority. Gaunt's son and heir had married one of the two daughters and heirs of the last Bohun earl of Hereford. The inheritance they had to share included the lordship of Annandale and Lochmaben Castle. Northumberland may thus have feared an extension of the territorial power of the house of Lancaster into an area he had come to regard as his sphere of influence. 
Why, however, did the earl act so strongly in the summer of 1381? The explanation must lie in the greatly increased territorial power in the north that he achieved during this very time. Before 15 December 1381 he had married as his second wife Maud (died 1398), the widow of Gilbert Umfraville, the last Umfraville earl of Angus, and daughter of Thomas, Lord Lucy. In addition to her dower in the Umfraville estates she held in her own right the inheritance of the baronial family of Lucy, which included the castle and honour of Cockermouth. How far Northumberland at the time of the marriage had expectations of adding this great estate to his own family's inheritance is not known; but during the life of his wife he was now the leading landowner in Cumberland. His achievement must have made the prospect of Gaunt's power and ambition on the border especially difficult to bear. 
Northumberland's apology in November 1381 did not end tensions between him and Gaunt. On 16 December 1381 the Lancastrian retainer, John Neville, lord of Raby, was appointed sole warden of the east march, the earl receiving the sop of a middle march. The changes then made in this arrangement mirror the tensions between Northumberland and Gaunt. On 14 March 1382 both the earl and Neville were, with others, made wardens of both east and west marches. Within a few months, on 26 June 1382, with Gaunt once more as king's lieutenant, Northumberland's authority as a warden was limited to the middle march and the area of his lordships of Alnwick and Warkworth, an arrangement repeated the following year on 25 July 1383. 
The end of the truce with Scotland, followed by an abortive invasion by Gaunt in April 1384, eventually led to a recognition of the realities of Northumberland's territorial power on both sides of the Pennines. On his return from Scotland, before returning south, Gaunt made an agreement with Northumberland, effectively handing over defence of the north to him from 1 May to 11 June 1384. It had become clear that the territorial power of the Percys was now firmly entrenched in Cumberland as well as Northumberland, since the Lucy inheritance was in the process of being entailed within the Percy family. Even so, the earl's authority in the marches was far from secure. In July 1384 he had to share the marches with lords Neville and Clifford. 
Tensions between Northumberland and Gaunt had by no means disappeared. The latter took advantage of the embarrassing position in which Northumberland found himself when attending parliament in November-December 1384. A band of Scots seized Berwick, of which he held the custody, by bribing his deputy. Gaunt took the lead in accusing him of negligence. Judgment was given against him on 14 December 1384 that, in the event of his failure to recover the town, all his property was to be at the king's pleasure. He took prompt action. Deciding to avoid the risks of a long siege, he paid the Scots to leave. He received a royal pardon on 17 February 1385. When an army under the king's command invaded Scotland in August 1385, Northumberland led the rearguard. 
Northumberland's ambitions had to adjust to changed political circumstances when Gaunt left England to pursue his claims to the kingdom of Castile in July 1386. A source of conflicting ambitions and personal antagonism had been removed. Instead, the policies of the young king and the ambitions of his courtiers became the dominating influences in the kingdom's affairs. Northumberland was bound to play an important role in national politics as well as the affairs of the north. In the struggle between the king and the lords appellant in 1387-8 he followed a policy of caution. He was sent by Richard II to seize the earl of Arundel; but he withdrew when he saw that Reigate Castle was well defended. At a later stage he took on a mediator's role when he assured the king of the loyalty of the duke of Gloucester and his other opponents, urging him to hear their grievances. By doing nothing against the appellants he was protecting his interests on the border, since their policy of war with France was bound to create opportunities in the north. 
The appellants responded to a threatened Scottish invasion in the summer of 1388 by making the earl's son Hotspur warden of the east march for three years and ordering his father and seven other lords to remain on their estates to defend the north. There then occurred one of the most famous episodes in the history of both the Percy family and English chivalry. Hotspur took the field against a diversionary raid into Redesdale by the earl of Douglas, while his father stayed at Alnwick Castle intending to bar the Scots' return home. At Otterburn Douglas was killed, but Hotspur was defeated, and he and his brother Ralph were captured. 
The following year conditions in the kingdom changed with the return of Gaunt and the beginnings of a decline in the position of the appellants. Gaunt was no longer a threat to Northumberland. One of his first acts after his return was to comply with the king's request to renounce any enmity towards the earl; and, in any event, his interests moved to Aquitaine. But what had a decisive effect on the position of Northumberland was the change of direction in government policy that followed the failure of renewed efforts made against France during the regime of the appellants. A truce with France in 1389 was followed later that year by one with Scotland. At the same time the king began to assert his personal authority in the knowledge that more peaceful conditions on the border had reduced his government's need for the power of Northumberland. 
In June 1389 Richard II appointed Thomas (I) Mowbray, earl of Nottingham, warden of the east march, inserting into border society a courtier who had no territorial interests there. There are clear indications of Northumberland's hostility, since when Mowbray requested an extension of his appointment for five years, in October 1389, the earl and other lords voiced strong opposition in the council. Although they failed to prevent the reappointment, a deal was put together: Hotspur became warden of the west march for five years, and his father became captain of Calais. It may well be that the king then concluded that his own interests required more recognition of Percy ambitions. Whatever the reasons, Northumberland and Nottingham switched offices. On 1 June 1391 Northumberland became warden of the east march for five years, his son retaining the west march. 
Thus in 1391 the efforts to secure control of the defences of the border that Northumberland had made, at least since the beginning of Richard II's reign, had achieved success. But it was short-lived. Hotspur was replaced by Lord Beaumont in June 1395. On 1 June he in turn replaced his father in the east march. The family had controlled both marches for no more than four years, and those in a period of truce that offered no opportunities against the Scots. 
From 1395 onwards Northumberland must have become increasingly dissatisfied with the policies of Richard II. Even during the years when he and his son held both wardenships, the king had pursued negotiations with the Scottish government intended to secure some form of permanent peace between the two kingdoms. When Richard II left for Ireland at the end of May 1399, there can be no doubt that Northumberland and his son were ready to rebel if a good opportunity arose. It is, however, difficult to chart in detail their disillusionment with the king. If any credence can be given to a story told by Froissart, there was an open rift when Richard II set sail for Ireland. He describes how the king came to hear of complaints about him on the part of the earl and Hotspur. Richard then sent the earl a special order to attend on him, in addition to the summons he had received for service in Ireland. His refusal to comply led to the banishment of Northumberland and his son. There is nothing to support the details of this story; and there is no record of a summons to service in Ireland. But the story itself, even if inaccurate, may mirror a situation of potential conflict between the king and the earl in the spring and early summer of 1399. Even so, in the preceding two years there had been no indications of open hostility. Northumberland appears to have accepted the king's coup of September 1397 and his revenge against the three leading appellants of a decade earlier. And he was a member of the committee appointed by the Shrewsbury parliament of February 1398 to deal with its remaining business. 
It is possible that Northumberland had anxieties about the increase in the power of the Nevilles at the hands of the crown. In September 1397 Ralph, Lord Neville, was made earl of Westmorland. And on 7 October following he and his wife were granted in tail male Penrith and other lands in Cumberland together with $120 a year from the customs of Newcastle. But the Nevilles had played an important role, often in conjunction with the Percys, in the affairs of the Scottish border since the early years of Edward III; and Northumberland's first wife had been Neville's aunt. It is unlikely that Northumberland regarded Neville as a threat, at least not to the extent of prompting open hostility to the crown. Yet he seized the opportunity to rebel when it came. His main motive lay in the policies that Richard II was following in the north and towards Scotland. He sought to assert his authority by importing into the marcher wardenships courtiers who had no territorial interests in the region, a policy that was part of a larger one of seeking a permanent accommodation with the Scottish crown. The long truce with France made in 1396 was followed by negotiations with Scotland in which Northumberland and his son had no part. Richard II thus planned a future that had no place for the territorial ambitions that were part and parcel of the Percy family's interests and traditions. 
A new phase in Northumberland's career and the fortunes of his family began with the landing of Henry Bolingbroke in Yorkshire in July 1399. Northumberland and his son Hotspur were among the first, if not the first, leading magnates to join him. It is clear that Bolingbroke's successful progress through England, culminating in the seizure of Richard's person, would not have been possible without the Percys' active support. Northumberland seems to have acted as the commander of his forces, and it was Hotspur who quelled resistance in Cheshire. There is no reason not to believe that they were ready participants in those acts in which Bolingbroke acted as a 'de facto' ruler of the kingdom, despite the adherence to his cause of the lieutenant appointed by Richard II, the duke of York. Indeed, one of these acts benefited Northumberland himself: on 2 August 1399 he was appointed warden of the west march under the seal of the duchy of Lancaster, and he and his son thus regained the control of the border which they had lost in 1396. 
Beyond these basic facts, however, it is difficult to achieve certainty about the Percys' conduct and the motives underlying it. The reason lies partly in the weaknesses and contradictions of the narrative sources, but also in the difficulty of discovering the truth of claims made by Northumberland, his son, and his brother Thomas Percy, earl of Worcester, at the time of their rebellion against Henry IV in 1403. In effect, they then denounced Henry IV as a perjured usurper. Shortly after landing in July 1399 he had sworn an oath at Doncaster that he sought only his rightful inheritance as duke of Lancaster, together with the estates that were his due as the husband of his late Bohun wife. It is not certain that this incident occurred, since John Hardyng, who in the second version of his chronicle provides the Percy manifesto of 1403, omits all mention of it in the earlier, 'Lancastrian', version. The origins of the story may simply lie in the Percys' propaganda (the sole other source differs in detail, and places the oath at Bridlington). 
The important issue, however, is whether the Percys were aware, if an oath was sworn, of different intentions on Bolingbroke's part. It is difficult to believe that a man with the earl's political experience -- much more, in fact, than either Bolingbroke himself or his other leading supporter, the earl of Westmorland -- would have played so active a role in the events that led to Bolingbroke's accession without a careful appreciation of the latter's intentions. It must have been obvious that a change of king was at least likely. And the capacity for revenge that Richard II had demonstrated, notably in 1397, made this especially so. When Northumberland accepted the wardenship of the west march under the duchy seal, he was co-operating in Bolingbroke's use of the royal prerogative. It is possible to argue that in so acting Bolingbroke was performing as steward of the kingdom; but there was no emergency that necessitated his performance of this particular duty. 
The most important service that Northumberland performed on Bolingbroke's behalf occurred when he acted as his emissary to Richard II who, after his return from Ireland, had eventually taken refuge in Conwy Castle. There is now a consensus among historians that the most important and reliable account of this episode is that of the French metrical chronicler Jean Creton. Although he was not present at the meetings between the king and the earl, his informant, the earl of Salisbury, was. Northumberland probably arrived at Conwy on 11 August with a small entourage, having placed most of his men some miles away. On meeting the king he made a number of demands for reform on behalf of Bolingbroke. The king was in no position to refuse these. But according to Creton he secured an oath of loyalty from Northumberland, who at the same time gave an assurance about Bolingbroke's own intentions, by swearing that he had heard him swear at Chester that he did not seek the throne. After some hesitation the king agreed to leave the castle on 14 August, Northumberland riding ahead of him. He was then met by Northumberland's main force. According to Creton, Richard, despite his initial anger and distress, was persuaded to accept the escort the earl had planned without his knowledge. It is difficult to see what alternative he had. And it is impossible not to conclude that Northumberland had on Bolingbroke's behalf plotted to secure the person of the king. 
This episode and Northumberland's involvement in it paved the way for the removal of Richard II from his throne. As in the case of earlier events, absolute certainty about the Percys' participation in the events that followed is difficult. According to the account given by Hardyng in the earlier, 'Yorkist', version of his chronicle, and also the manifesto published by the Percys when they rebelled in 1403, they pressed the claim of the boy earl of March who, by the rule of primogeniture, was the heir. In principle it would have been in their interests to do so, since Hotspur was married to March's father's sister, so that the Percys could in the event of his accession look forward to at least a period of dominance in the affairs of the kingdom. It is more than likely that, once the removal of Richard II had been determined, March's claims were debated in some way. In the sermon he preached after Bolingbroke had been accepted as king, Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, referred to the dangers that might face a kingdom ruled by a child. This, and the discussions to which it may have referred, may have given a degree of plausibility to the story in the Percys' manifesto. But there is nothing in Northumberland's conduct between July and September 1399 to give support to it. On the contrary, the earl acted openly as a supporter of the accession of Henry IV. He was one of the two earls on the deputation sent to the Tower of London to receive the abdication of Richard II as part of the procedures followed for his removal from the throne. It was Northumberland who presided over the Lords' discussion of what to do with the former King Richard. At the new king's coronation he stood by Henry's side, carrying Lancaster's sword which had been worn by Bolingbroke when he landed in Yorkshire three months earlier. 
A series of royal grants and appointments then substantially strengthened the position of power that Northumberland had occupied in the preceding three months. On 30 September 1399 he became constable of England for life, the highest military office in the kingdom. His position on the Scottish border was recognized by a fresh appointment as warden of the west march, his son Hotspur retaining the east march, both appointments being for ten years. The most remarkable grant, however, occurred on 19 October 1399 when the earl and his heirs were granted the Isle of Man. The full importance of these gains can be appreciated only in the light of those also made by his son Hotspur and his brother, the earl of Worcester. Hotspur, in addition to the wardenship of the east march, received a number of offices in north Wales, including that of justice of Chester. Worcester became admiral of England for life. Taken together, the gains made by the Percys present two features. First, they now dominated the military and naval leadership of the kingdom. Second, they now extended their power and influence into fresh areas -- Wales and the principality of Chester. In this connection their link by marriage with the house of Mortimer was also recognized. On 17 November 1399 the farm of the greater part of the Mortimer estates during the minority of the young earl of March was given to four persons, of whom Northumberland and his son were two. On 1 October 1401 the farm was transferred to the earl alone. The effect was to increase, if only temporarily, the Percys' new influence in Wales and the marches. 
The Percys' position of dominance in the affairs of the realm was maintained to all appearances during the first three years of the new reign. Northumberland was the leading member of the council, and played an equally important role in the public events of royal diplomacy, being, for example, a joint commissioner to arrange the marriage of the king's daughter to the son of the king of the Romans. But tensions between the king and Northumberland and his family were growing. It is fair to assume that Ralph Neville, earl of Westmorland, felt inadequately rewarded in comparison with the Percys for his support of Henry in July-September 1399; and he was married to the king's half-sister Joan Beaufort, whose brothers were only too ready to undertake roles in government. At the same time, once the immediate needs of the usurpation were over, the new king was bound to rely more and more on nobles and gentry who had risen in the service of his father. 
At first the rise to power of a court faction consisting of these elements was hampered by the government's financial difficulties. In the parliament of 1401 the Commons regarded the earl of Northumberland as an ally in their struggle to restrain royal expenditure. The earl and his brother were members of a sworn and enlarged council, while the latter recovered the stewardship of the royal household which he had held under Richard II. 
A number of developments then produced a rift between the king and the Percys. If any single event can be said to mark an open deterioration in their relations, it occurred in March 1402, when the captaincy of Roxburgh Castle was transferred from Hotspur to the earl of Westmorland, a change that dented the Percys' control of the Scottish border. The cause of the deterioration, however, was a growing realization on the part of the earl, his son, and his brother that they were being increasingly detached from the centre of power. Their dissatisfaction took the form of complaints about the crown's failure to finance adequately the duties they performed on its behalf. In a series of letters the earl and Hotspur complained of their treatment, the first known being from May 1401. Two written by Northumberland himself belong to 30 May and 26 June 1403, the second complaining of the dishonour inflicted on the kingdom and the Percys themselves by the king's unwillingness to meet their financial needs. The earl denied the rumour that he and his son had received $60,000 from the crown since the king's accession, and claimed that $20,000 was owing to them. An analysis of the actual treatment they received, based on the issue and receipt rolls of the exchequer, shows that they were not ill-treated in terms of the financial situation of the crown. They may well have felt some financial strain in performing their duties, but this was a risk implicit in the acceptance of offices that at the same time carried with them benefits in terms of patronage and territorial influence. It is quite clear that these financial disputes with the crown became known outside the immediate circles of government. One of the chroniclers describes a confrontation between Northumberland and the king in which the earl demanded money for the defence of the marches and the king angrily replied, 'Aurum non habeo, aurum non habebis' ('I have no gold, you will have no gold'; 'Eulogium historiarum', 306). It is difficult not to believe that in these disputes over money the earl and his son felt the need for special treatment, at least partly out of a sense that their influence in the kingdom's affairs was diminishing. 
There were other sources of disagreement and tension. Northumberland and his son were not happy about the king's policies in Wales, apparently preferring a policy of negotiation with Owain Glyn Dwr, probably because they wanted resources to be diverted to the war in the north. A more personal dispute occurred as a result of the capture of Hotspur's brother-in-law, Sir Edmund (IV) Mortimer, by the Welsh rebels. The king refused to permit the Percys to arrange his ransom, accusing Mortimer of treason. But the worst dispute occurred as a result of the crushing defeat that the earl and his son inflicted on a Scottish invading force at Homildon Hill on 14 September 1402. The king refused to allow any ransoming of captives without his leave. For the Percys it was a blatant royal interference within an area they controlled. Father and son responded defiantly. The earl in the end surrendered his captives; but Hotspur refused to part with his, the chief of whom was the earl of Douglas. 
Beyond this pattern of events the sources do not provide any glimpse of the discussions that must have occurred between Northumberland, his son, and his brother. The financial records of the exchequer suggest that every effort was made to meet the financial needs of the earl and his son in the late autumn and winter of 1402-3. On 2 March 1403 Northumberland and his heirs were granted a great tract of territory, covering the greater part of the area of southern Scotland claimed by the English crown. This was a resounding recognition of the Percys' dominance of the Scottish border and of a tradition of family aggrandizement that was now a century old. 
Despite this, in the summer of 1403 the Percys rebelled. On 21 July 1403 Hotspur and his uncle the earl of Worcester met Henry IV in battle at Shrewsbury. Their defeat and the death of Hotspur in the battle, followed by the execution of his uncle two days later, ended the rebellion. Even though Northumberland himself was not at the battle, there can be no doubt that he was a full participant in rebellion. He was named with his son and brother both in the manifesto in which, on the eve of the battle, they defied Henry IV. The chronicler Hardyng, who was present at the battle, regarded Northumberland as a fully involved conspirator, describing how he raised troops and began to move south. Equally there can be no doubt that the Percys' intention was the removal of Henry IV from the throne and his replacement by the young earl of March. By this means they intended to retain the gains they had already made and to control the kingdom, at least during the minority of the new king. 
Beyond this, however, there are problems and difficulties arising out of the apparent timing and strategy of the rebellion. It is clear that the Percys were in collusion with the Welsh rebel Owain Glyn Dwr, and also that Hotspur moved from the north via Cheshire, aiming at Shrewsbury, the headquarters of the prince of Wales for his operations against Glyn Dwr. At first sight it is puzzling that the Percys rose in rebellion within a few months of a royal grant that greatly increased their power on the Scottish border. But it is more than likely that they were contemplating rebellion in the autumn of 1402 and deferred action until after the winter. The royal grant of March 1403 may well have upset their plans by presenting a test of their time-honoured territorial ambitions, impelling them to make a visible effort to assert their new rights. Indeed, Hotspur laid siege to the castle of Cocklaw in Teviotdale. 
It is the role of Northumberland himself that presents the most serious difficulties. It is impossible to accept Hardyng's account as a basis for an understanding of events. He wrote in the 'Yorkist' version of his chronicle that: '
His [Hotspur's] father came not out of Northumberland, 

But failed hym foule without witte or rede. 
('Chronicle', ed. Ellis, 361-2)' Northumberland, in fact, did move south, but found his way barred by the earl of Westmorland and the forces he had raised. At that point Northumberland did not know of his son's death. His moving south does suggest, however, that the Percys were following a two-pronged strategy, the intention being that their two armies would later unite. It is more than possible that their timing had gone awry. Hotspur may have been precipitate and moved towards Shrewsbury too fast. Or the earl's departure from Northumberland may have been delayed because of a threat of invasion by the Scots: Hotspur's attempt to exercise his family's rights under the grant of March 1403 had led to mobilization on the part of the Scottish government. 
At any rate the royal victory at Shrewsbury and the earl's withdrawal back into Northumberland left him totally isolated. After some time at Warkworth Castle he went south again, this time to submit to the king at York, on 8 August 1403. He was imprisoned at Baginton (a castle between Kenilworth and Coventry). He had to agree to the placing of royal garrisons in his castles of Alnwick, Warkworth, Prudhoe, and Langley. When his constables refused to admit the royal appointees on the ground that they held their offices for life, the earl was compelled to issue his own commands to his men that they give up their posts (October 1403). But as late as 13 January 1404 his men still controlled Alnwick, Warkworth, and Berwick. 
At this point, when a parliament was about to meet, it must have been clear to Henry IV and his advisers that it was going to be extremely difficult to dislodge Northumberland from the position of power and influence in the north that his family had built up over the preceding century. In any event it would have been impossible to charge him successfully with treason. He was able to deny that he had conspired with his son and brother; and there is no evidence that the crown had information to contradict this. In terms of the law of arms he had never unfurled his banners against the king. Some sort of rehabilitation for him was inevitable. 
On 6 February 1404 Northumberland came before the king, Lords, and Commons in parliament, asking for pardon. The Lords then declared that he was not guilty of treason but of trespass and offences against the 'Statute of Liveries', offences that carried a fine and ransom at the king's pleasure. The earl then took an oath of allegiance and secured a royal pardon. An account of this business, apparently sent to Durham Cathedral priory at the time, indicates that the formal parliamentary record does not give the full facts, since the king had pardoned the earl two days earlier (probably to make it clear that this was a matter for the king, not the Lords). 
Northumberland's rehabilitation was far from total. He was no longer constable of England. His family had lost the wardenships of the marches that it had achieved in 1399, his own west march going to the earl of Westmorland who had forestalled his march south. Apparently there was also a price to pay for his pardon. What pressures were brought to bear in the succeeding months is not known, but on 9 July 1404 Northumberland promised to deliver to royal commissioners between the following 20 July and 1 August the castle of Berwick, the annual revenue of 500 marks from the customs of the town, the castle of Jedburgh, and the Forest of Jedworth. He was promised in exchange lands for himself and his heirs; but he had lost a powerful body of interests in the affairs of the Scottish border secured by his grandfather seventy years before. 
It is fair to assume that Northumberland's feelings were ones of humiliation rather than gratitude for escape from the total consequences of rebellion. Even so, he remained a magnate with considerable territorial power; and the difficulties encountered by the government in its efforts to secure control of his castles had demonstrated the depth of loyalty among leading retainers. He could have chosen to bide his time, seeking to safeguard the interests of his heir, Hotspur's son. Yet he chose to rebel again. 
It is not certain when the planning of another rebellion began. It may have been under way by January 1405. Whether or not he was implicated in a plot to seize the young earl of March, he made excuses for not coming south to attend a meeting of the council that month. One result of his planning was an alliance with Owain Glyn Dwr. Aside from circumstantial indications, this alliance is commemorated in the text of the tripartite indenture between Northumberland, Glyn Dwr, and Sir Edmund Mortimer of February 1405. It is not certain that the details are trustworthy; but it divided England and Wales between the three allies, the earl's share being twelve counties, stretching from the north into the midlands. In terms of the history of Percy ambitions, this is not incredible. The conspiracy also stretched into England. Richard Scrope, archbishop of York, apparently had genuine concerns about the government of the kingdom which, if Hardyng can be trusted, may have involved sympathy with the rebellion of 1403. Thomas (II) Mowbray, earl marshal, nurtured grievances against Henry IV as his late father's enemy, though the motives of Thomas, Lord Bardolf, are not clear. 
Both circumstantial evidence and the comments of the chroniclers leave no doubt that Northumberland was the leader of the rebellion that followed. However, he never brought the forces he had raised to join up with those led by his allies. For him the deciding event in the rebellion was one that resulted from an anxiety to avoid the mistakes of 1403. He attempted to remove the earl of Westmorland as a potential opponent. Early in May 1405 he marched at night with a force of retainers to seize Westmorland when the latter was staying with Sir Ralph Eure at Eure's manor in Durham. When Westmorland, forewarned, made his escape, Northumberland apparently decided that the rebellion was doomed and abandoned the archbishop and the earl marshal to their fate. His decision to do nothing further did not save him. When the king advanced north from York, he and Bardolf fled to Scotland. His attainder and forfeiture followed in the next parliament. 
The rest of Northumberland's career consisted of moves from refuge to refuge and futile efforts to launch further rebellion. His stay in Scotland lasted no more than a year. When he and Bardolf learned of the Scottish government's intention to hand them over to Henry IV, they fled to Owain Glyn Dwr in Wales. A journey to the French court failed to secure the French king's help in replacing Henry IV with the earl of March. By the summer of 1407 the two fugitives were back in Scotland. There followed a desperate attempt at an invasion of England. In February 1408 they reached as far south as Tadcaster in Yorkshire, a Percy manor. At the nearby Bramham Moor they encountered a force raised by the local sheriff. Northumberland was killed in battle on 19 February, his body receiving the customary treatment for a traitor -- decapitation and quartering. His head was set on London Bridge. His remains were eventually brought together and buried in York Minster. 
With his first wife Northumberland had three sons: Henry Percy Hotspur, Thomas, and Ralph. Thomas died in 1387, while serving on John of Gaunt's expedition to Castile. His son and heir, Henry Percy of Athol (so-called because his mother was the elder coheir of the last Strathbogie earl of Atholl) died without male issue in 1432. Ralph Percy fought against the Turks in the battle of Nicopolis in 1396 and died abroad the following year, presumably on his journey home. 
Northumberland's whole career can be divided into two main phases. In the first, ending with the Lancastrian usurpation of 1399, he achieved gains that alone would have secured him a leading position in the history of his family, at least equalling those of his grandfather and great-grandfather. As well as strengthening his territorial power in Northumberland, he secured, in the Lucy inheritance in Cumberland, the most substantial estate on the western side of England's border with Scotland. He played a role in national politics far greater than that of any earlier head of the house of Percy. But this period also revealed a concern, almost obsessive, with maintaining a dominant position on the Scottish border by exploiting the potential rewards of the wardenships of the marches. In the second period, following the accession of Henry IV, this came to the fore, as did an ambition to dominate the affairs of the whole kingdom. In these years it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Percys' very success had isolated them. In 1403 they had no help from other magnates. And in 1405, bereft of his son and brother, Northumberland showed lack of judgement in rebelling without substantial allies. Thereafter his efforts to avenge the failures of 1403 and 1405 were as futile as they were bitter. 
The failure of the rebellions against Henry IV left a permanent mark on the fortunes of the Percy family. In November 1414 Northumberland's grandson and heir, Hotspur's son, was restored to the entailed estates held by his father and grandfather. And in March 1416 he recovered the title of earl of Northumberland. His restoration to the Percy inheritance was, however, far from complete. The taint of the attainders of Henry IV's reign lay over the family until it was removed in 1484; and the recovery of some entailed estates was not immediate. More significant, however, was the permanent loss of two important territorial gains achieved in the course of the fourteenth century. The Isle of Man, granted by a grateful Henry IV in 1399, was lost for ever. Above all, the Jedburgh estate, the revenue from the customs of Berwick, and the hereditary captaincy there had been surrendered to the crown and the promised compensation was never received. Although their dominant territorial position in Northumberland remained, the Percys' claim to total primacy on the eastern march was permanently damaged.

Percy, Henry, second earl of Northumberland (1394-1455), magnate, was the son and heir of Henry Percy (1364-1403), known as Henry Hotspur, who fell at Shrewsbury in 1403 in rebellion against Henry IV, and Elizabeth Mortimer (1371-1417), eldest daughter of Edmund (III) Mortimer, earl of March, and Philippa, granddaughter of Edward III. He was born on 3 February 1394. 
Percy's early years were blighted by the consequences of rebellion, for although his grandfather Henry Percy, the first Percy earl of Northumberland, presented him to Henry IV at Doncaster in June 1404, when the earl fled to Scotland in 1405 young Henry followed him and was detained for ten years by the duke of Albany, who treated the boy honourably. After Henry V's accession Percy was eager to return to England to recover his title and family estates, predominantly in Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Cumberland, with others in the south (including Petworth, Sussex). His rehabilitation may have been encouraged by the king's aunt, Joan Beaufort, countess of Westmorland, who in October 1414 arranged his betrothal to her daughter Eleanor Neville, the widow of Richard, Lord Despenser (died 1414). Their children included Sir Ralph Percy, Thomas Percy, first Baron Egremont, and William Percy, who became bishop of Carlisle. Percy petitioned Henry V for the reversal of his grandfather's attainder, and on 11 November 1414 he was restored in parliament to his entailed estates. Henry V welcomed reconciliation with the Percys, which would help to secure northern England and reduce a Scottish threat should the king embark on war with France. 
The arrangements for Henry Percy's return were complicated. Henry V sought to exchange him for Murdoch Stewart, earl of Fife, the duke of Albany's eldest son and a prisoner in England; Percy agreed to pay the $10,000 ransom required for Stewart. About the same time, however, the Southampton plotters against Henry V, including Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton, a north-country landowner, conceived the idea of seizing Stewart and themselves exchanging him for Percy, who could then bring a Scottish army to help the plotters overthrow Henry V. They seized Stewart on 31 May 1415 while he was being taken north to effect the king's exchange, but he was quickly recaptured, and the episode did not upset Henry V's arrangements to restore Percy, who was innocent of the plot, to a position in England. The final terms of this exchange were agreed on 1 July, and in February 1416 Percy crossed the border; on the way, at Berwick, he married Eleanor Neville. In parliament (April 1416) he did homage for his earldom, though as a new creation, thereby stressing the attainder of his grandfather and the king's act of clemency: Percy was then formally regranted his family's entailed estates and was knighted. In the years that followed, Northumberland tried to recover all the estates, though many had been granted away after their forfeiture. Most were eventually recovered, even if in some cases it took a long time, as with those granted to John, duke of Bedford (died 1435), and his duchess; others were only recovered by his son, the third earl. Northumberland was therefore far from being the richest of English earls, and his additional grants from Henry V and Henry VI were modest. Yet the gross value of his estates at the time of his death in 1455 has been estimated at over $3100, perhaps double the value of twenty years earlier. 
Northumberland's service to Henry V was largely confined to the defence of the Scottish border. Although in July 1416 he went to Normandy on the king's service, he provided only a small contingent for the expeditionary force of 1417. Rather more important was his commission of the wardenship of the east march towards Scotland, to which he was appointed on 11 April 1417, with responsibility for Berwick Castle (of which the duke of Bedford was custodian). During the next seventeen years he negotiated with the Scots, raided southern Scotland, and strove to resist incursions into northern England. His first negotiation was authorized on 7 June 1417: his earlier contacts with Scotland and its politicians were doubtless considered an asset. But on 31 July, just as Henry V was embarking for France, he wrote to the king from Warkworth, one of his castles, to warn that his erstwhile captor, the duke of Albany, was preparing to attack Berwick. Weeks later Albany and the earl of Douglas did invade, attacking Berwick and Roxburgh; Northumberland helped to raise a force, and when the Scots retreated he pursued them across the border. During the king's absence in France, Northumberland supported Bedford in other ways, not least (as in November-December 1417) in persuading parliament and convocation to grant subsidies for the war. When Henry V returned to England with his queen in 1421, Northumberland acted as steward at Catherine's coronation on 24 February, and he witnessed the king's new will at Dover on 10 June. But his most valuable service continued to be in the north. In June 1421 he was reappointed warden with the promise of $2500 per annum in peacetime and $5000 per annum in wartime to maintain his retinue; he had difficulty in securing regular payment from then until the end of his wardenship in 1434, when he surrendered his commission in exasperation. 
Henry V's death meant that Northumberland was required to join the conciliar regime during Henry VI's minority. He was appointed a councillor on 16 November 1422, and frequently attended council meetings when his other responsibilities allowed. For much of the time he seems to have been in Bishop Henry Beaufort's circle, and Beaufort's loans were an important source of finance for the wardenship. A rare venture to the continent may have taken place after he was appointed in 1423 an envoy to the Council of Pavia; but his main preoccupation in the 1420s -- albeit a frustrating one -- was to negotiate with the Scots. He was involved in the discussions of 1423-4 about ransoming the Scottish king, James I, who had been in English custody since 1406, and he accompanied James across the border in March 1424. In the following decade he tried to control cross-border warfare, investigating breaches of truces in 1426 and 1433, and accompanying Bishop (and now Cardinal) Beaufort to Berwick in 1429 to negotiate a new truce with King James. The king's council granted him $50 for his efforts on the border on 18 February 1434; but the fact that in June 1434 he and his burgesses of Alnwick were authorized to build walls round the town after the Scots had burnt it demonstrates that the Scottish problem had not been solved. In 1434 he surrendered his warden's commission; two decades later he was still owed outstanding wages. 
In these years Northumberland's links with the Neville family were amicable enough, and together they shared responsibility for protecting the border. In 1426 Northumberland bought the marriage of the young Ralph Neville, earl of Westmorland (died 1484), and married him to his widowed sister, Elizabeth Percy; by May 1429 he was receiving a life pension from Cardinal Beaufort, the brother of Joan, dowager countess of Westmorland. Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, was equally exasperated at the level of support given to him as warden of the west march; after he surrendered the wardenship, Northumberland and the earl of Huntingdon were jointly appointed wardens of both marches in July 1435, though they served for only one year. Such instability on the English side of the border led to further Scottish incursions. Outright war was in prospect by 1436, encouraged by the Burgundian attack on Calais. Northumberland may have raided into Scotland with Sir Robert Ogle, who was defeated at Piperden in September. James I besieged Roxburgh in August, but he was forced to retire when Northumberland advanced. This time, the government rewarded him with an annual grant of $100 for life, and in 1438 truce negotiations were resumed. 
After Henry VI came of age, Northumberland continued to serve as a royal councillor, and in July 1438 received an annuity of $100 for life for attending council meetings. In 1441 he was on the commission of inquiry into charges of sorcery against the duchess of Gloucester. However, in the 1440s he was much occupied with the claims and franchises of a fellow councillor, Archbishop John Kemp of York, which impinged on Percy lands and rights in Yorkshire. Kemp was a formidable opponent, with the result that the earl was drawn into outbreaks of violence. In 1442 Percy retainers raided the archiepiscopal estates at Ripon and Bishopthorpe, and attacked Kemp's officials. The king's council intervened: Kemp appears to have had Henry VI's sympathy, and on 20 May 1443 Northumberland was ordered to surrender himself at the Tower of London, where he agreed not to travel more than 7 miles from London, unless it were to his manor at Dagenham, Essex; the archbishop's franchises were confirmed in 1444. Northumberland seems to have largely withdrawn from the council in the later 1440s, though he kept in touch with the court and may have spent much time in southern England; from 1443 he was involved in plans for the king's new college at Cambridge. 
By 1450 Northumberland may have sympathized with criticisms levelled at the king's government. After the duke of Suffolk's murder he was appointed constable of England (25 May 1450) when certain governmental changes were made; though his military experience also commended him at this juncture. He was soon embroiled in Cade's rebellion, as one of the king's intermediaries sent to negotiate with the rebels at Blackheath in mid-June. He may also have sympathized with the duke of York's desire for reform in the autumn of 1450; on 11 September he was replaced as constable by the duke of Somerset when the royal courtiers reasserted themselves. Yet there is no sign that Northumberland approved of York's persistent criticism of the regime in the years that followed; in any case, in June 1452 he was commissioned again to treat with the Scots. 
Northumberland's relations with the Nevilles deteriorated sharply in the early 1450s, as a result of the behaviour of younger members of the two families (especially Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, who was Northumberland's second son, and Sir John Neville) and the deepening political divisions at Westminster. By this stage Northumberland was spending an increasing proportion of his estate income on his retinue, while his eldest son, Henry Percy, Lord Poynings, was warden of the east march and Salisbury had returned to the west march. By July 1453 the king was ordering Northumberland and Salisbury to maintain the peace and keep their sons under control, but matters reached a serious pitch with the marriage of Thomas Neville, Salisbury's son, to one of Lord Cromwell's two heiresses at Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire. Cromwell held two rich, former Percy manors -- Wressle, Yorkshire, and Burwell, Lincolnshire -- which might fall to the Nevilles as a result of this marriage. Such an eventuality would seriously hinder Northumberland's recovery of ancestral Percy lands and at the same time enrich his Neville rivals. A month later, on 24 August 1453, while the Nevilles were returning from the marriage, the younger Percys ambushed the wedding party, including Salisbury; a skirmish took place at Heworth, near York, between the earls' sons -- and some of Northumberland's retinue were involved. 
On 8 October Northumberland and Salisbury were summoned to appear before the council and told to end their warlike activities. This was ignored, and Northumberland himself joined the Percy force that converged on Topcliffe to confront Salisbury and the Nevilles in October, though conflict was avoided. This lawlessness was made more serious by the involvement of the duke of Exeter, who claimed some of Lord Cromwell's estates in Bedfordshire and had his own political ambitions. Exeter allied with the Percys, especially when the duke of York, with whom the Nevilles were associated by 1453, was appointed protector of the realm in March 1454 during the king's incapacity. In 1454 Exeter raised his banner against York in the north and made common cause with the Percys. On 10 May 1454 Salisbury and Northumberland were again ordered to attend the council (on 12 June) to implement measures to restore order. Despite efforts to calm matters (including suspending all judicial process against Northumberland in July), little was achieved before the king's recovery at the end of 1454 and the confrontation between Henry VI and York at the battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455. Indeed, the early months of 1455 saw Northumberland identify himself decisively with the king's interests and those of the duke of Somerset, the enemy of York and the Nevilles. The Percy-Neville feud in the north, along with the Somerset-Neville feud in Wales, had been critical in alienating the Nevilles from the Lancastrian regime. Accordingly, at St Albans the Nevilles joined forces with York, and Northumberland was slain in the king's company. This battle seems to have been an arena for settling personal, political, and north-country scores, as well as for attempting to reform the government. Northumberland was buried in the nearby abbey.

Percy, Henry, third earl of Northumberland (1421-1461), magnate, was the son and heir of Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland (1394-1455), and Eleanor, daughter of Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland (d. 1425). He was born on 25 July 1421 at the Percy manor of Leconfield, Yorkshire. With his father a member of Henry VI's minority council, he was knighted on 19 May 1426 along with the young king. The second earl and his kinsman, Cardinal Beaufort, secured for him ('c'.1434) the marriage of Eleanor (1428-1484), granddaughter and heir of Robert Poynings, fourth Baron Poynings. When Poynings died in 1446 Percy acquired (16 November) the baronies of Poynings, Fitzpayn, and Brian, with estates in Kent, Sussex, East Anglia, and Somerset; henceforward he was known as Lord Poynings. On 1 April 1440 he assumed responsibility for the east march towards Scotland (which his father shouldered until 1434) and custody of Berwick, and his commission was periodically renewed until his death. He was assigned substantial fees and wages -- $2500 per annum in peacetime and $5000 per annum in wartime, with an annual sum for Berwick's upkeep (100 marks in peacetime and $200 in wartime) -- though securing payment was not easy. With his father he defended the north against Scottish incursions, and in May 1448 invaded Scotland with Sir Robert Ogle and burnt Dunbar; the Scots retaliated by burning his father's castles at Alnwick and Warkworth. Later that year Henry VI travelled to Durham and dispatched Poynings to Dumfriesshire, but he was forced to retreat and was taken prisoner near the River Sark. On regaining his freedom he was recompensed for his ransom with half the goods of Sir Robert Ogle, now an outlaw. In April and July 1451 he was commissioned to negotiate with the Scots and in August became one of the conservators of a truce. In July 1452 he was granted the fee farm ($80 per annum) of Carlisle for twenty years, but in August 1454 the grant was transferred to Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury. By then Poynings was embroiled in his family's violent dispute with the Nevilles in Yorkshire where, at Topcliffe on 20 October 1453, he and his father assembled a force to confront Salisbury and his family. This seems to have been Poynings's first overt participation in the feud. By February 1454 he was reported to be planning to attend parliament with a strong force, and on 10 May he and his father were summoned to the council probably in an effort to prevent further lawlessness and a rising in Yorkshire by the duke of Exeter and Poynings's younger brother, Thomas Percy, Baron Egremont. 
His father's death at the battle of St Albans in May 1455 meant that Poynings inherited the earldom of Northumberland and, in view of his loyal service to Henry VI, he was allowed to enter his lands without payment of relief. He returned to the north, and in July 1455 foiled James II's attack on Berwick. Indeed, his duties in northern England meant that, later in the year, he was excused from attending parliament. But in January 1456 the delicate political situation that led to the ending of the duke of York's protectorate required his presence in London. A year later he joined the king and his court at Coventry, where he was confirmed as warden of the east march. With a substantial force and accompanied by his brother, Egremont, he attended the great council that assembled in London in January 1458 to reconcile the leading magnates. The Londoners were reluctant to allow large Lancastrian retinues into the city and Northumberland's was refused entry. Nevertheless, he took part in the formal reconciliation on 25 March: the greatest concessions were made by the Nevilles and the duke of York; Northumberland and Egremont concluded a bond with them for $8000. He attended the Coventry parliament in 1459 that accused York of causing the death of Northumberland's father at St Albans; Northumberland himself swore to uphold the Lancastrian dynasty. In the face of continued Scottish threats, efforts were made in the late 1450s to ensure that Northumberland was paid his fees and wages as warden, and as a Lancastrian stalwart he was more successful than Salisbury on the west march in securing payment, including part of his accumulated arrears of $17,000. He also recovered, in November 1459, the Carlisle fee farm after Salisbury was attainted, and received an annuity of 100 marks from York's forfeited lordship of Wakefield, Yorkshire. For his services against the rebels, presumably at Ludford Bridge, he was rewarded, on 22 December 1459, with a life appointment as chief forester north of the Trent and constable of Scarborough Castle. On 30 May 1460 he was nominated to a wide-ranging commission of oyer and terminer to deal with all treasons and insurrections in Northumberland; a few days later he secured a twelve-year lease of Salisbury's estates in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Cambridgeshire. In the last years of his reign Henry VI relied on Northumberland to defend and control northern England, at the expense of York's and the Nevilles' power. Nevertheless, it was costly loyalty, for the Percy estates, especially in the north, had been declining in value for decades, and although the debt to him as warden had been reduced, it still stood at about $12,000 in 1461. 
The Yorkist regime established after Henry VI's capture at Northampton in July 1460 tried to wrest the grants of forfeited property from Northumberland; and in October he was ordered to appear in chancery accused of looting York's and Salisbury's estates; following a meeting with his allies, lords Clifford and Dacre, at York in November 1460, further plundering of these Yorkist lands took place. York himself marched north against Northumberland: at a skirmish near Wakefield on 30 December 1460 the duke and his second son, Rutland, were killed, and Salisbury was beheaded immediately after. Northumberland proceeded to help Queen Margaret to raise an army, and he marched south with her, plundering along the way. They defeated the earl of Warwick and recaptured Henry VI at St Albans on 17 February 1461; but then, having failed to gain immediate entry to London, they retired north to York. Northumberland seems to have been in joint command of the army that then turned to confront the new monarch, Edward IV, at Towton on 29 March. In the battle Northumberland commanded the van, but his archers were blinded by snowstorms. The Lancastrians were defeated and Northumberland was killed in close fighting. He was probably later buried in the church of St Denis, York. In Edward IV's first parliament he was posthumously attainted (4 November). By 1469 the Percys were striving to restore their honour and reassemble their estates, but it was only when his son Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland, petitioned the parliament of 1472 that Northumberland's attainder was reversed.

Percy, Henry, fourth earl of Northumberland (c.1449-1489), magnate, was the only son of Henry Percy, third earl of Northumberland (1421-1461), and his wife, Eleanor, Baroness Poynings (1428-1484). Despite their reputation as the leading northern family, rivalled only by the Nevilles of Middleham, the Percys had still not entirely recovered from the reverses they suffered between 1403 and 1408, when in 1461 the third earl died fighting for the Lancastrians at Towton. He was attainted by the victorious Yorkists, and in 1464 the forfeited earldom and most of the Percy estates were conferred on the earl of Warwick's brother, John Neville, Lord Montagu, in reward for his recent victories over the Lancastrians. Lord Percy, as Henry was called, was then confined in the Fleet, attended by four servants; by 1468 he was the ward of William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke (d. 1469), whose daughter Maud (died in or before 1485) he later married ('c'.1476). Probably only the breach between Edward IV and the Nevilles allowed the future fourth earl to rebuild the fortunes of his family, though the difficulties facing any government that tried to rule the north of England without the Percys were also a significant factor in Henry Percy's recovery of his earldom. Following renewed disturbances in the north, which were accompanied by a demand for his restoration as earl, Henry Percy was released from the Tower of London on 27 October 1469 and did homage to Edward IV at Westminster. During March 1470 the Percy estates in Northumberland were restored to him following their surrender, with the earldom, by John Neville, who was promoted instead to be Marquess Montagu; and on the 25th, after Warwick's flight, Henry Percy was created earl of Northumberland, with custody of his father's estates elsewhere. On 24 June he was appointed to the wardenship of the east and middle marches, an office traditionally held by the Percys. 
Percy retained his earldom during the readeption of Henry VI in 1470-71, though displaced from his warden's office by Montagu, and he played a crucial role in Edward's recovery of his crown. Challenged after his landing at Ravenspur, Edward replied 'that he came thedere by the Erle of Northumberlondes avyse, and schewede the Erles lettere y-send to hym' (Warkworth, 14). The earl then sat still, so doing Edward 'a notable good service', since 'grete partye of [the] noble men and comons in thos parties [which] were towards th'Erle of Northumberland, and would not stire with any [other] lorde' did likewise, despite their Lancastrian loyalties and bitter memories of kinsfolk killed at Towton. ('Historie of the Arrivall', 6-7). The earl's reward, given on 12 June 1471, was restoration as march warden, initially for five years, and appointment as justice of the forests beyond Trent and constable of Bamburgh for life. His father's attainder was reversed in the parliament of 1472, and during 1474 he received life grants of other key border offices, as constable of Newcastle and sheriff of Northumberland, while his election as a knight of the Garter attested his favour at court. In 1475 he accompanied Edward IV to France, serving with 10 knights, 50 esquires, and 350 archers, and was present at Edward's interview with Louis XI at Picquigny. And in 1482 he raised 6000 men and commanded the van in Richard of Gloucester's invasion of Scotland. 
Apart from a few months immediately after Henry Tudor's accession Northumberland controlled the wardenship of the east and middle marches for the rest of his life. The extent and strategic location of the Percy estates explain their central importance to the earl. The terms of his restoration had been generous, giving him a relatively compact lordship initially worth approximately $3200 a year gross, all but $400 coming from Yorkshire and the border counties of Northumberland and Cumberland. Yet border estates also needed defending against Scottish incursions and the depredations of the borderland's reiving clans. In the 1470s the earl appointed itinerant commissioners to tighten estate administration, and he also made intermittent efforts to exploit their mineral resources. The terms on which he held the wardenship gradually deteriorated, but new lands worth almost $800 per annum which he inherited in the south in 1484 and 1488 compensated for this financially, without much altering the geographical balance of his estates. 
Throughout Edward's second reign, however, Northumberland was overshadowed in northern government by the king's younger brother, Richard, duke of Gloucester, warden of the west marches, and inheritor of the Neville interest and estates. Initially the earl attempted to compete by building up his connection, but the threat posed by the duke's superior resources was underlined by Gloucester's retaining of John Widdrington of Chipchase, the earl's master forester of Alnwick, and by his displacement of the earl as justice of the forests beyond Trent in 1472. An unsuccessful attempt at mediation by the king's council in 1473, and the well-known indenture between duke and earl in 1474, seeking to limit their rivalry and safeguard the peace, shows Northumberland on the defensive. In effect Northumberland was obliged in the indenture to become Gloucester's 'faithful servant' (de Fonblanque) in return for assurances that the duke should neither retain any of the earl's servants, nor claim any office or fee which Northumberland had of the king. The agreement was flexibly observed by both parties: the earl was unchallenged in Northumberland, where he continued to fee the leading gentry, and in north Durham too, but in the west he granted no new fees. In Yorkshire the earl dominated the East Riding, where he had most land, while North Riding gentry mostly followed Gloucester. Relations between the two magnates were apparently amicable too, as was attested by their co-operation during the Scottish war of 1480-83. Although Gloucester was appointed king's lieutenant, and so given general precedence in the north, after the recovery of Berwick it was the earl who received command of this key outpost; and initially, too, he had the gift of 600 places in the garrison, at a cost of $438 per month. 
Northumberland's support for Gloucester was crucial in providing the military muscle behind the latter's coup in June 1483. The earl raised troops in his own territory, particularly the East Riding, and had command of the northern army which backed Richard's claim to the throne. He bore the curtana, the blunt sword which was the emblem of royal mercy, at Richard III's coronation; and once Richard was established at Westminster, Northumberland no doubt hoped to take over his role as king's lieutenant in the north. He was to be disappointed. The earl was handsomely rewarded for his support, with the title of great chamberlain of England and probably the most valuable land grant (approximately $1500 per annum) of the reign. But a third of this land (by value) was the Brian estate in the south-west, which the earl claimed through his mother; and in political terms the forfeited Stafford lordship of Holderness merely complemented his existing East Riding possessions. In Northumberland he continued to act as warden, albeit from year to year, but any expansion of Percy influence in the region was checked by Richard's decision to retain direct control of the north through his ducal household and council there, headed successively by his son and his nephew. Moreover, the king's local knowledge, his continuing reliance on his northern affinity, and his more attractive lordship, probably meant that Northumberland's position was now even weaker. Several Percy associates entered the king's household, accounting for about one-eighth of his known knights. 
As in 1471, therefore, circumstances again prompted Northumberland to place personal interests before the loyalties and expectations of his retainers. Perhaps calculating that an inexperienced king without other supporters in the north would allow him the regional hegemony Richard had withheld -- and perhaps also in accordance with an earlier undertaking to Henry Tudor -- Northumberland brought a large army to Bosworth but then once more sat still, so keeping his retainers, and probably many of Richard's northern supporters, out of the battle. In the short term this strategy proved successful. Richard III was defeated and killed, and although Northumberland was briefly imprisoned after Bosworth, lack of support in the north soon forced Henry VII to restore the earl -- albeit, in effect, on probation. The earl lacked connections at the new king's court, but again built up his regional affinity: by 1489 he was retaining eighty-four lords, knights and esquires, and spending $1708 a year (42 per cent of his income) on fees to officials and retainers. And over the next three years he repaid Henry's confidence in him with unswerving loyalty as king's lieutenant in a hostile north. In April 1486 he brought a powerful retinue, including thirty-three knights, to escort the king into York at the time of Lovell's rebellion. In June 1487 he reacted promptly to Lambert Simnel's invasion, organizing York's defence, and raising 6700 men to hold the north-east against the rebels. And in April 1489, upon news of a tax rising in Cleveland, he summoned his retainers to come with 'bowes & arrowes & pryvy harnest' ('Plumpton Letters', no. 74) and set out to enforce collection. 
Yet Northumberland's equivocal conduct at Bosworth was widely seen as treachery; many northerners suffered in the ensuing political reaction against the followers of Richard III; and subsequently the earl's energetic enforcement of Tudor policy in the region marked him as the leading instrument of an unpopular regime. These developments so undermined the earl's standing among his retainers that they failed to protect him, instead leaving him to be killed when he confronted a mob of protesters at South Kilvington, just outside Thirsk, on 28 April. In John Skelton's words: '
Barons, knightis, squyers, one and alle, 

... Turnd ther backis and let ther master fall, 

... Alas his golde, his fee, his annuall rente, 

Upon suche a sort was ille bestowde and spent. 
('John Skelton: the Complete English Poems', 31-2)' Northumberland was buried as he had requested in Beverley Minster, after a lavish funeral costing $1037. His wife had died before 1485, but he was survived by their four sons and three daughters, of whom the eldest son, Henry Algernon Percy, succeeded his father as fifth earl. Their third son, Alan Percy, became master of St John's College, Cambridge.

Percy, Henry Algernon, fifth earl of Northumberland (1478-1527), magnate, sometimes known as the Magnificent, was born on 14 January 1478, the eldest son of Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland (c.1449-1489), and Maud (died in or before 1485), daughter of William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke. Alan Percy, who became master of St John's College, Cambridge, was his younger brother. Northumberland succeeded his father aged eleven when the latter was murdered at Cocklodge, near Thirsk, on 28 April 1489. The young earl was made a knight of the Bath on 21 November 1489 and a knight of the Garter in 1495. He received livery of his estates in 1498. 
Following the overthrow of Richard III, the fourth earl had raised the standing of his family to new heights, essentially through the holding of crown offices. Despite the views of some historians, there is no reason to believe that the fourth earl's death was either contrived by or welcome to Henry VII. The challenge for the fifth earl was to restore this standing after a decade's atrophy. The vacuum in northern government left by his father's death had been filled by a council under the earl of Surrey, acting as lieutenant first to Prince Arthur and then, after 1494, to Prince Henry. But whereas it might have been decided to wind up the northern council on the fifth earl's attaining his majority, the decision was taken to keep it in existence under Thomas Savage, archbishop of York, again as lieutenant to Prince Henry. The earl's frustration at his inability to recover his father's position was acknowledged in loose talk by some of his servants reported in 1509: 'that if their lord had not room in the North as his father had, it should not be long well' ('LP Henry VIII', 1/1, no. 157). 
His efforts to re-create a regional hegemony brought Northumberland into a series of conflicts with Savage and others, especially over Beverley, in his father's day a Percy town. The earl was indicted by Savage for retaining in 1502 and 1504. Then on 23 May 1504, as earl and archbishop were both leaving York with their retinues at about the same time, their parties became entangled at Fulford, south of the city, and a fracas took place in which Northumberland was assaulted. Depositions taken afterwards reveal the antipathy between the two men, and also show the deep hostility between their respective households. Both men were forced to enter bonds with the council in November for their future good conduct. It may be suggested that this unexpected conflict ruined the reputation of both men. Northumberland continued on a career of minor brigandage and was the subject of complaints laid before the council in Star Chamber. In 1505 he was fined $10,000 -- $5000 on a recognizance at the king's pleasure and $5000 to be paid at 1000 marks per annum -- for abducting Elizabeth Hastings, the daughter and heir of Sir John Hastings of Fenwick in Yorkshire; her subsequent death in the earl's custody deprived the crown of her wardship. Northumberland assigned manors to feoffees for the payment of this fine. Edmund Dudley, when clearing his conscience after being arrested in 1509, recalled that the king had intended to demand only $2000, although Dudley thought that even this was excessive for the offence. In fact, $3000 had been paid by the time of the king's death: the outstanding balance was forgiven in 1510. The earl's servants were accused of violence against Sir John Hotham in 1506, and in 1516 he was himself imprisoned in the Fleet for contempt of the council's jurisdiction in private suits, although his exact offence is unrecorded. 
Not only did neither Henry VII nor Henry VIII show any inclination to concede ground to the earl in Yorkshire, they also went out of their way to deny him the border offices which an earl of Northumberland might expect to exercise and was best equipped to fulfil. When the earl was made warden-general of the marches in June 1503, it was merely as a ceremonial post to escort Margaret Tudor into Scotland. Thereafter he never held office on the borders, the middle and east marches falling under the control of Thomas, second Baron Dacre, from 1511 onwards. This was not for any lack of military capability on Northumberland's part. In 1497 he served in the royal army against the Cornish rebels and fought at Blackheath. He led his gentry and their tenants from Northumberland, Cumberland, and Yorkshire to France in 1513. In 1523 he served on the Scottish borders. By 1522 Dacre was urging that Northumberland's eldest son, Henry, be appointed warden in his place, a choice which perhaps recognized that the fifth earl was still unacceptable to Henry VIII. Hall, however, is the sole authority for the statement that Northumberland was offered and accepted the wardenship in the autumn of 1522, but that he subsequently lobbied the council to be discharged, resigning probably early in 1523 in favour of Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey. This cannot be verified, and some have thought it unlikely. 
Perhaps because Northumberland lacked opportunities for military service, most of his public appearances were ceremonial in character. Thus he escorted Queen Margaret of Scotland from York to the border in 1517 (and subsequently complained of the cost). He was among those who attended the king at the Field of Cloth of Gold and was present when Henry met Charles V in 1522. In 1525 he assisted at the ceremony at which Henry Fitzroy was created duke of Richmond. Northumberland died at Wressle on 19 May 1527 and was buried in Beverley Minster, with little ceremony, probably on 6 June. 
Even if, as Hall says, Northumberland's rapid surrender of the wardenship in 1522/3 led to his not being 'regarded of his own tenants which disdained him and his blood and much lamented his folly, and all men esteemed him without heart or love of honour and chivalry' (Hall, 652), he still controlled a considerable force. In the 1530s the Percy estates in Northumberland could raise 1967 men under the command of the constable of Alnwick, the Yorkshire lands 2280 horse and 3953 foot, and the Cumberland estates 1030 horse and 2011 foot. It seems unlikely that a force on such a scale was ever deployed, however: for the earl's retinue drawn from Yorkshire, when it mustered at Newcastle in 1523, totalled 762 men, of whom 170 were drawn from stewardships under his control and not his estate. 
As for his wealth, it is clear that the fifth earl of Northumberland was among the richest peers of his generation. Although he was assessed for the subsidy at $2920 in 1523, it has been suggested that his rental income would have been about $4700, and his clear income after the deduction of fees and other expenses about $3600. There is little compelling evidence that the earl was significantly in debt at the time of his death. While he may be thought to have deserved it, the sobriquet of the Magnificent which is sometimes applied to him dates only from the beginning of the nineteenth century, and probably arises from the impression created by the publication of his household book in 1770. This describes an opulent and well-organized household, which in 1511-12 was financed out of an assignment of $933 6's'. 8died; slightly later it was in receipt of $1000 yearly. In fact the long familiar household book is only the first of a pair -- a second, a volume of chapel and other regulations, was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1962 (now MS Eng. hist. b. 208). The books shed a little light on the earl's intellectual tastes, providing, for instance, that his almoner should be 'a maker of Interludys' (James, 83). Northumberland is also said to have endowed a teacher of grammar and philosophy at Alnwick Abbey, and, in a letter to his son-in-law the first earl of Cumberland, he justified the appointment of a chantry priest to keep a grammar school at Cockermouth as a 'marvelous good and meritorious deed' (Hoyle, 'Letters of the Cliffords', 94-5). The earl's secretary, William Peeris, wrote a verse chronicle of the family, which he presented to his master as a new year's gift. Leland described an impressive library at Wressle which has almost entirely disappeared. 
Northumberland may best be seen as a transitional figure. As a young man he attempted to dominate through the violent exercise of his power. Loose talk by his household servants revealed the scale of his ambitions. His imprisonment in 1516 -- for whatever reason -- shows that he had not lost his capacity to challenge royal authority in the pursuit of his private objectives. Hence he was among those nobles -- the duke of Buckingham being another -- whom in a famously paranoid letter of 1519 or 1520 the king instructed Wolsey to keep watch over. Wolsey himself reassured Northumberland that he was not suspected of collusion with Buckingham after the latter's execution. This did not prevent the cardinal from interfering when the earl's son became emotionally involved with Anne Boleyn some time in the early 1520s. In any case royal suspicion of Northumberland, and the latter's tactless disregard for royal authority, seem to have led him to be excluded from office. Fears of the earl's latent power continued even after his death: Wolsey's interference in the arrangements for the earl's funeral have been read as an example of the cardinal's belief in the incompetence of the sixth earl, but it testifies equally to a determination that the funeral should be a low-key affair and not a demonstration of pro-Percy sentiment. 
One of the few manuscripts known to survive from Northumberland's library contains an emblematic drawing of a Tudor rose representing the sun in which is framed a figure (probably the young Henry VIII). From this sun there fall drops of liquid onto an eye (itself weeping) contained within a crescent moon (a Percy badge). Under this lie verses, the first of which is 'I receyve noo lighte but of thy beames bright' (Dickens, 42): the Percy moon reflected only the rays of the Tudor sun and no longer emitted any light of its own. The proverbs painted in the high chamber at Leconfield also point to an essential pessimism about life and its stability: no hope should be placed in the world, riches, or honour, for all are uncertain or transitory: instead, hope should only be placed in God. 'Trust hym he is moste trewe' and 'is above fortunes fall' (James, 89-90). The weight of his family's history, the circumstances of his father's death, and his own failure to satisfy the expectations placed on him by others may have made Northumberland a melancholic in adverse times. It remains to be resolved why, having been brought up at court, he never established a relationship of trust with Henry VIII. Here it may be suggested that, as a young man, he strove too hard to recapture the authority which had been his father's but which the elder Tudor had determined to keep for himself. Recourse to violence destroyed the possibility of trust. Northumberland's response was to eschew royal office except for the ceremonial which he was required to dignify as a noble: in this there is a clear parallel with the duke of Buckingham, another senior noble who found no role in the inner circle of government. 
Before 1502 Northumberland married Katherine, daughter of Sir Robert Spencer of Spencercombe in Devon. She survived her husband, dying in 1542. They had three sons: Henry Percy, sixth earl of Northumberland (c.1502-1537), Sir Thomas, executed 1537, and Sir Ingelram or Ingram (died 1538); and two daughters, Margaret (died 'c'.1540), who married Henry, Baron Clifford, created earl of Cumberland in 1525, and Maud, who is alleged to have married William, first Baron Conyers (although she does not appear in the Conyers pedigrees).

Percy, Henry Algernon, sixth earl of Northumberland (c.1502-1537), magnate, known by the eighteenth century as 'the Unthrifty Earl', was the eldest son of Henry Algernon Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland (1478-1527), and his wife, Katherine Spencer (died 1542). He had two younger brothers, Thomas and Ingram, with whom his relations were never cordial. In this, and in several other respects, there is much that is enigmatic about his life. 
The young Lord Percy was educated in the household of Cardinal Wolsey, who is known to have had a low opinion of his charge, not least for his lack of financial sense. The cardinal continued to bully Percy even after he had become earl, for instance trying to ensure that all his contacts with the king and court were made through himself. He forbade Percy to attend his father's funeral and tried both to foist a household supervisor on him and to control his domestic expenditure. William Worme, the earl's auditor, seems to have been employed as an informant by Wolsey; some time after 1532 Worme submitted a petition to chancery claiming that he had been detained at Alnwick against his will for five years. 
No later than 1516 there were proposals that Lord Percy should marry a daughter of George Talbot, fourth earl of Shrewsbury (1468-1538). The king gave his approval, but while he was still in Wolsey's household Percy formed a romantic attachment to Anne Boleyn after her return to England at the end of 1521, when she was one of Queen Katherine's maids of honour. The story that the couple entered into some commitment dogged Percy for the rest of his life. According to the cardinal's biographer George Cavendish, Wolsey stopped the courtship because the king had designs on Anne, but the dating makes this impossible. The likely reason for his intervention was the threat to existing plans to marry Percy to Mary Talbot and Anne to James Butler, son of Piers Butler, who was then claiming the earldom of Ormond against Anne's father, Sir Thomas Boleyn. Wolsey summoned Percy's father to court, and he admonished his son sharply for his recklessness. By the end of 1523 the affair was over; Percy married Mary Talbot between 14 January and 8 February 1524. 
Even before his father died, and despite Wolsey's misgivings concerning his capacity, Lord Percy was seen as a plausible candidate for the wardenship of the east march and other offices in the north of England which the king's suspicion had denied to the fifth earl. In 1522 he was made a member of the council of the north and in October deputy warden of the east march. Thomas, second Baron Dacre, the warden-general, canvassed Percy as his possible successor in the east. Nothing came of this, but when war threatened with Scotland that year, Percy and his father were both among the northern lords chosen to advise the king's lieutenant-general, the earl of Shrewsbury. Then on 2 December 1527, less than six months after the death of his father, the new earl of Northumberland was made warden of the east and middle marches. At once he faced the problem of dealing with Sir William Lisle of Felton, whose violence towards his neighbours had led to his being imprisoned at York after a star chamber action. Sir William broke out of prison and took refuge in Scotland, from where he and a band of gentry followers conducted a campaign of raids on the property of his English opponents and even on Wolsey's lordship of Hexham. After Northumberland's appointment as warden Lisle and his supporters surrendered themselves to him at Alnwick on 25 January 1528. Despite his close connections with the Percys -- he had been constable of Alnwick Castle since 25 March 1525 -- the earl was unable to save Lisle from execution. 
While this episode may have damaged Northumberland's reputation in the north-east, he appears to have been an efficient and trusted warden, though he may have taken some time to establish that reputation. On 2 November 1528 he told his friend the twelfth earl of Arundel of his wish to hold Wark and Dunstanburgh castles, as previous wardens had done, but perhaps thanks to Wolsey he was unable to obtain them. However, he was elected to the Order of the Garter in 1531, was considered perfectly competent to manage the war against Scotland which erupted briefly but fiercely at the end of 1532, was 'de facto' president of the council in Yorkshire from 1533, and was granted the shrievalty of Northumberland for life in February 1534. All this implies that Wolsey's assessment of the earl and his persistent meddling in his affairs arose from either a personal dislike or a determined attempt to belittle his former charge; it did not reflect the earl's natural ability. Northumberland may well have enjoyed implementing the king's order to arrest Wolsey at Cawood on 4 November 1530, but even then the cardinal could not take the earl entirely seriously, patronizingly reminding him of 'my old preceptes & Instruccions wche I gave you whan ye ware abydyng wt me in yor youthe' (Cavendish, 155). 
Northumberland is occasionally recorded at Westminster. Thus in October 1529 he was a trier of petitions in parliament and also attended the very full council session held immediately after Wolsey's resignation as chancellor. At almost exactly the same time he was confronting the collapse of his marriage. Countess Mary had given birth to a stillborn child in April that year, but on 3 September the earl wrote to the third duke of Norfolk reporting how he had ordered that she be 'entertained a great deal better than she hath deserved', and how he had told one of Shrewsbury's servants that he was willing to send her back to her father 'with a reasonable finding' ('LP Henry VIII', 4/3, no. 5920). Subsequently they lived apart. In 1532 the countess stated that her husband had claimed that their marriage was invalid because he had been contracted to Anne Boleyn, now increasingly close to Henry VIII. Recognizing the damage that this did to her position (and perhaps also seeing this as a way to secure an annulment), Mary Talbot told her father, who wrote to the duke of Norfolk, Anne's uncle, who in turn broached the claims with his niece. Anne informed the king and insisted that the allegations be investigated. In July 1532 Northumberland was examined by the archbishops of Canterbury and York as to any undertakings between himself and Anne: he then swore that there had never been any contract between them. Nevertheless rumours to the contrary, and even that their relationship had been consummated, circulated throughout their lives. There was nothing uncertain about the earl's relationship with his wife, however: Northumberland clearly loathed her and took pleasure in leaving her unprovided for at his death. 
Northumberland suffered from persisting ill health. In 1529 he reported the return of his 'old disease' and expected to die. He was ill in late 1532 and early 1533 and again in mid-1534. In February 1536 he wrote saying that he had not been outside his chamber at Topcliffe for a year (demonstrably untrue), but a protracted illness is indicated. In November 1536, when warned that he was in danger from the Pilgrimage of Grace, he said that 'he did not care, he should die but once. Let them strike off his head whereby they should rid him of much pain, ever saying he would be dead' ('LP Henry VIII', 12/1, no. 380). The only account of his physical symptoms comes from immediately before his death, when he was reported to be barely able to speak and losing his sight; his stomach was distended and 'his whole body yellow as saffron', but his memory still unimpaired ('LP Henry VIII', 12/2, no. 165). The symptoms suggest liver failure. It is no coincidence that both of Northumberland's doctors, Stephen Thomasson and Thomas Wendy, were rewarded handsomely by the earl, who sought to secure the grant of an abbey for Wendy. 
In July 1534, despite his ill health in that year, Northumberland was able to attend the trial for treason at Westminster of William, third Baron Dacre, an enemy who was also the husband of one of Countess Mary's sisters. In May 1536 he was tangentially caught up in the fall of Queen Anne Boleyn. He was not spared attendance at her trial. Like the other peers he gave his verdict against her, then collapsed after sentence of death had been pronounced. Rumours of Anne's pre-contract to the earl were again rife, possibly circulated in the hope of justifying the king's annulment of his marriage to her, and Northumberland wrote to Cromwell reiterating the denial he had made on oath four years previously. Later that year he was too sick to play any role in the Pilgrimage of Grace. The pilgrims were determined to have his support, and following their first assembly at Doncaster the earl was visited at Wressell on 30 October 1536 by his former secretary Robert Aske, who tried to reconcile him to his brother Sir Thomas, but without success. A further visitor next day found Northumberland in bed, 'weeping, ever wishing himself out of the world' (Dodds, 1.284). On 1 November the earl allowed himself to be sworn to the insurgents, having asked the vicar of Brayton to send 'two gentlemen of worship to take him because he would be taken with no violence' (Hoyle, 'Pilgrimage', 446). He then put Wressell at the disposal of Aske (who made it his headquarters), subsequently justifying his action on the grounds that he had wanted to escape from the commons and secure his evidences on the king's behalf; he left first for York and later for Selby. 
It is against the background of a failed marriage and continuous ill health that Northumberland's breaking up of his patrimony must be seen. In 1528-9 he made extensive grants of his west country manors to Thomas Arundell, who had been his contemporary in Wolsey's household. He made sales of other manors in 1531-2. At least some of these should be viewed as attempts to liquidate debts, probably contracted before he inherited his estates. But he also made grants to three young household intimates, apparently with the aim of raising their social status and military capacity, together with large numbers of disadvantageous leases to household servants, a practice which continued until the eve of his death. By the earl's gifts Thomas Johnson was raised from the status of household servant to gentleman (and may also have been knighted by Northumberland in the Scottish war of 1532-3). Sir Reynold Carnaby had grants of leases from 1530 onwards: the earl tried to obtain an abbey for him, and in 1538 he was granted Hexham. In October 1530 Sir Thomas Wharton (later first Baron Wharton) had the grant of the hereditary lieutenancy of Cockermouth, along with six manors in Cumberland and an annuity from the Percy estates, and he received other lands in Yorkshire in 1531. Johnson appears to have been advanced purely from personal friendship, but the grants to Carnaby and Wharton were probably also intended to enable them to perform military functions on the border which ill health prevented the earl's performing himself. 
In 1532 Northumberland granted the Percy fee in Craven, Yorkshire, to Henry, Lord Clifford (his nephew and later second earl of Cumberland), although conditionally on his death without male issue and with the reservation of the rents to his heirs. These and other grants served to diminish the estate likely to be inherited by Sir Thomas Percy, the earl's next brother, and in particular some of the grants to Carnaby of lands previously assigned to Sir Thomas. The latter complained to Cromwell in July 1535 of the influence which his household servants had over the earl, saying that they had 'caused division between the Earl and his wife, his brethren, and nearest friends' ('LP Henry VIII', 8, no. 1143). When Sir Thomas Clifford, the captain of Berwick and also the earl's brother-in-law, took Sir Thomas's side in an increasingly bitter family dispute in 1535, Northumberland turned against him too. It seems likely that by 1536 the earl was determined to disinherit his younger brothers, referring, in a letter to Cromwell, to the 'debility and unnaturalness of those of my name' ('LP Henry VIII', 8, no. 166). 
The question arises of the crown's attitude to Northumberland's protracted decline and progressive disinheritance of his brothers. By a statute of 1536 the earl's interest in the estates was limited to life and it was ordained that the king would inherit them on his death. There can be no doubt that just before his death the crown moved to seize the estates to prevent them from being further ruined by grants. Moreover, the crown had purchased the honour of Cockermouth from the earl in 1531 and then in 1535 annulled this grant and received the honour of Petworth, Sussex, the manor of Hackney, and other lands in its place. Superficially it would appear that it was always the crown's intention to annex the lands of the earldom and that it exploited the psychological weakness of the earl to do so, but on closer scrutiny the traditional account does not quite hold up. 
First, the crown was interested in the estates because of the failure of an Italian merchant, Antonio Bonvisi, on whose behalf Northumberland had entered bonds. The transfer of Cockermouth in 1531 and, after its return, of the other lands, was for the settlement of Northumberland's exposure to Bonvisi's liabilities. Second, the crown compelled Northumberland to sign covenants in July 1532 whereby he was permitted to sell some further estates to redeem the honour of Cockermouth, but undertook to allow the estates in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Somerset, and Dorset to descend to 'one person bearing the name of Percy and the blood of the said Percys' (Hoyle, 'Henry Percy', 194). These covenants were not honoured by the earl. Third, it was the earl who, by letters of 2 February 1536, announced his intention of disinheriting his brother and making the king his heir, and had articles to this end notarized and sent to London. The statute of 1536 was prompted by the earl. By limiting his rights in the estate, it is likely that the crown hoped to ensure the survival of the earldom. If its lands were vested in the king, they could be transferred to Sir Thomas Percy at some later date. (The assumption that Sir Thomas would inherit the earldom was widespread during the pilgrimage, when he was sometimes -- to his embarrassment -- addressed as Lord Percy, the courtesy title held by the heir to the earldom.) By May 1537, with reports of the earl's continuing generosity to suitors circulating, the decision was made to seize the estates. On 3 June Northumberland offered to make an unconditional and immediate grant to the king, asking only for some income from the estates, but he died on 29 June. 
However, Sir Thomas had himself been executed on 2 June 1537. It has sometimes been argued that the younger Percy brothers took part in the pilgrimage to try to recover the family estates. But although both were said to have expressed anti-Cromwellian sentiments, there is no reason to believe that either saw the pilgrimage as a vehicle for regaining their inheritance. There is no request for the restoration of the earldom in the Pontefract articles drawn up at the beginning of December 1536. Although Sir Thomas had been prominent in the pilgrimage, he was protected by the pardon granted by Norfolk at Doncaster on 4 December 1536. He was tried and executed for contrived offences postdating the pardon, primarily that about Christmas he had received a petition from the monks of Sawley Abbey who sought his advice after the Doncaster settlement. He advised them not to resist any commissioners who came to Sawley from the king, but this was read as aiding the abbey, whose convent had re-entered its lands after its dissolution. In a deposition made by George Lumley of Thwing, who had been caught up in Sir Francis Bigod's failed rising of early 1537 (of which Percy had been ignorant), Lumley referred to Percy as the 'lock, key and wards' of the venture ('LP Henry VIII', 12/1, no. 369). By this he meant that without Sir Thomas the rising was bound to fail; but the implication that Percy could have led a successful rebellion may have prompted fears of a Percy revanche and so ensured his fate. Sir Thomas and his younger brother Sir Ingram were arrested in London in March 1537, and Sir Thomas was tried and then executed in York. He was posthumously attainted in the parliament of 1539. Sir Ingram died in the Tower. Thereafter the earldom went into abeyance until Sir Thomas's elder son, another Thomas Percy, was created seventh earl in 1557. 
Northumberland died at Hackney on 29 June 1537, aged about thirty-five, and was buried on the same day in Hackney parish church, with proper dignity and ceremony. There was a monument, but this had disappeared by 1767. The earl made no provision for his widow. Early in 1536 the countess's father approached Henry VIII, asking him not to approve the bill then before parliament confirming the transfer of lands from Northumberland to the crown until his daughter's rights had been secured, and during the pilgrimage he sent directly to the earl to try to obtain provision for her. Northumberland responded that as Shrewsbury had never paid his daughter's promised dower, he could not himself be expected to pay her an allowance, and he died without doing anything for his wife. Negotiations with the crown continued after the earl's death, and the dowager countess petitioned the king in person in May 1542. Henry is reported to have observed that her father had brought her troubles upon her by failing to pay her portion to the Percys. Only in 1549 did she receive a royal grant in compensation for her jointure. Suspected of harbouring Catholics in 1571, she died between 16 April and 6 June 1572. 
Northumberland made a will in which the king was named supervisor and Edward Fox, bishop of Hereford, and Thomas Cromwell his executors. It does not survive, and partly for that reason little is known of the earl's cultural or religious taste. He maintained a chantry at Topcliffe, where a priest was charged with praying for the souls of the earl's ancestors, and especially his father and mother, and in 1531 appointed another priest, George Lancaster, as chantrist at Warkworth, where he was to pray for 'the good estate of all such noble blood and other personages as be now living and the souls of such men as be departed to the mercy of God out of this present life' whose names were in a parchment delivered to him; Lancaster was also to say a requiem mass for them each week (TNA: PRO, E326/10479). In 1536, moreover, the earl gave an annuity to his father's chaplain, John Bell, to pray at Leconfield for the souls of the earlier Percys, including his parents. However, Fox was a known reformer, and given Northumberland's education in Wolsey's household, and perhaps also his association with Anne Boleyn, it would not be too surprising if Thomas, Baron Darcy, was correct in claiming (under cover of a hostile reference to Lutheranism) that the earl, like others of his generation, inclined towards reform.

Percy, Henry, eighth earl of Northumberland (c.1532-1585), magnate and conspirator, was born at Newburn Manor, Northumberland, the younger son of Sir Thomas Percy (died 1537), landowner and rebel, of Prudhoe, Northumberland, and his wife, Eleanor (died 1567), daughter and coheir of Sir Guischard Harbottle of Beamish, co. Durham; he was aged about five in 1537. He was the younger brother of Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland (1528-1572), magnate and rebel. Their father was executed at Tyburn on 2 June 1537 for his role in the Pilgrimage of Grace. After this, they were removed from their mother's custody and placed under the care of Sir Thomas Tempest of Holmside, co. Durham. 
Thomas and Henry Percy were restored in blood on 14 March 1549. Henry Percy was returned as MP for Morpeth, Northumberland, in 1554 and knighted on 30 April 1557. Thomas was restored to the earldom of Northumberland on 1 May 1557, with the tail male in remainder to Henry, who became deputy warden of the east and middle marches. Henry Percy purchased the captaincy of Norham Castle at the end of 1557. All this was intended to recover family power through acquisition of traditional Percy offices. Elizabeth I initially favoured him. He was appointed to the queen's council in the north in December 1558 and named of the quorum for co. Durham and for Northumberland in 1559. Percy was a commissioner to treat with the lords of the congregation and encouraged rebellion in Scotland, goading James Hamilton, duke of Chatelherault, in February 1559 to take action. The French ambassador in Scotland, Henri Cleutin, seigneur d'Oysel, complained about Percy's interference on 30 July. Percy participated in the Scottish campaign in 1560, commanding a band of horse pistoleers and distinguishing himself, and was appointed governor of Tynemouth Castle, Northumberland, in December as a reward. 
Percy was appointed a commissioner to treat with the French on 25 May 1560. He reported on the newly adopted doctrines of the Scottish church and corresponded with John Knox, who was convinced of his protestantism. Chatelherault believed Percy was protestant in 1559, as did Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, in 1565, but Sir Ralph Sadler was unconvinced. Percy was commissioned on 5 May 1561, along with Thomas Young, archbishop of York, to administer the oath of supremacy to the clergy of the northern province. By 25 January 1562 he married his cousin Katherine (1545/6-1596), first daughter and coheir of John Neville, fourth Baron Latimer, and his wife, Lucy. The couple had eight sons, Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564-1632), Thomas (died 1587), William Percy (1574-1648), Sir Charles Percy (died 1628), Sir Richard Percy (died 1648), Sir Alan Percy (died 1611), Sir Josceline Percy (died 1631), and George Percy (1580-1632/3), and two daughters, Lucy and Eleanor (died 1650). Percy ensured that his children were very well educated. Katherine Neville's younger sister, Dorothy, married Thomas Cecil (1542-1623) on 27 November 1564. Percy was sheriff of Northumberland from 1562 to 1563. He was appointed a commissioner to suppress piracy on 8 November 1565 and to enforce the 'Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy' in the archdiocese of York in 1568. The following year he was named of the quorum for Cumberland and for the North and East ridings of Yorkshire. 
During the northern uprising of 1569-70, while Northumberland played a leading role in supporting Mary, queen of Scots, Percy remained loyal to Elizabeth. He joined the royal forces and held Tynemouth for the queen, who wrote to him in gratitude on 17 November. Although his motivations are unknown, Percy was proud and quarrelsome, yet displayed 'a cautious 'loyalist'' attitude during the rebellion (James, 295). It is possible that the brothers took opposing sides in order to preserve the family estates. When Northumberland escaped to Scotland and was imprisoned there, Percy wrote urging him to confess and appeal to Elizabeth's mercy. Percy was rewarded with the stewardship of the crown property at Tynemouth in 1570. He was returned as MP for Northumberland in 1571, probably to ensure his inheritance. The act for confirmation of attainders of May 1571 contained a clause guaranteeing Percy's rights. He technically succeeded to the earldom when his brother was executed on 22 August 1572. 
Despite his previous loyalty, Percy opened communication with John Leslie, bishop of Ross, at Easter 1571. Again, his motivation for offering to assist Mary to escape as part of the Ridolfi plot is unclear. It is possible that Roberto di Ridolfi's agents contacted Percy, as acting head of the family. Despite Percy's professing Catholicism, Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, did not trust him. Percy was found out and while in the capital was arrested and lodged in the Tower of London on 15 November. He begged Elizabeth for mercy on 23 February 1572, which was granted, but was tried privately in November, having accepted a secret punishment rather than open trial. The queen was angry with him for his ingratitude and dissimulation, while William Cecil, Baron Burghley, was regarded as too partial towards him because of marital ties. In November she renewed her order to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, that Percy be kept in close confinement, his fault being 'as great as any Man's, though it be no hie Treason' (W. Murdin, ed., 'A Collection of State Papers Relating to Affairs in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, from... 1571 to 1596', 1759, 229). Percy was fined $3333 6's'. 8died, which he never paid, and told to stay at his house at Petworth, Sussex. He had been removed from the queen's council of the north in April 1571, and Francis Hastings, second earl of Huntingdon, did not want him restored. Huntingdon wrote to Leicester on 20 January 1573, requesting successfully that the eighth earl of Northumberland remain under house arrest at Petworth. Northumberland was permitted to go to London on 12 July 1573 and set at liberty shortly afterwards. 
Northumberland was unpopular with his tenants, who accused him of being a cruel landlord. He attempted to improve his estates, building a forge and a double furnace in Petworth Great Park, which was probably what upset his tenants. However, Northumberland preferred the court to the country. Writing in the early seventeenth century, William Camden described him as 'a man of lively and active Spirit and Courage' (Camden, 193). Northumberland's exile from court was lifted, and he first took his seat in the House of Lords on 8 February 1576. He began rebuilding Petworth from 1576, and it was his principal residence during the last years of his life. In 1577 he was nominated to be a commissioner to promote the breeding of warhorses in Sussex. After his father-in-law died on 22 April 1577 the countess of Northumberland inherited a quarter of the Latimer estate, including Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire. 
Northumberland continued to dabble in treasonous plots surrounding Mary. He had several of his sons educated in Paris by Charles Paget. Paget was an accomplice of the conspirator Francis Throckmorton, and visited Northumberland at Petworth in September 1583, perhaps hoping to make it the base for his invasion of England but more probably trying to apprise his associates of the current situation, advising them not to support any plots. Certainly Northumberland was sympathetic to Mary, enjoyed intrigue, and had a weakness for indiscreet comments. The government was convinced that he was seriously involved, and in December he was placed under house arrest for assisting Thomas Paget, third Baron Paget, and Charles Arundell to escape to France and for speaking with Charles Paget. He was removed from his governorship and his stewardship. Northumberland was sent to the Tower on 9 January 1584 for denying matters confirmed by witnesses. Sir Francis Walsingham was convinced that he was a Catholic. 
In June 1585 the government considered bringing charges of treason against Northumberland but did not pursue it, although the reason why is unknown. He was found in bed in the Tower on the night of 20-21 June, dead from a shot through the heart inflicted with his own pistol, which was still in his hand. The Star Chamber inquest held on 23 June determined that his death was suicide. He was buried on the same day in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. Some Catholics, however, were convinced that Sir Christopher Hatton, the vice-chamberlain, had the earl murdered on the government's orders. A Latin pamphlet published at Cologne made this claim; it was soon translated into German, Italian, Spanish, and English. If Northumberland had been shot three times in the chest, as some affirmed, this would indeed seem to rule out suicide, but if not, suicide does seem much more probable; it protected his family from confiscations. The popular belief in Hatton's guilt, however, was strong. In a letter of 1601 to Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Ralegh casually referred to Hatton as Northumberland's murderer. The declaration by the crown after Northumberland's death stated that he conveyed Charles Paget and Arundell out of the country after Throckmorton's arrest, because they were the only real witnesses against him. The dowager countess of Northumberland remarried shortly after 5 December 1587, her second husband being Francis Fitton of Binfield in Berkshire, a kinsman of Northumberland who had long been her steward. She died on 28 October 1596 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Percy, Henry, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564-1632), nobleman, was born in April 1564 at Tynemouth Castle, the eldest son of Sir Henry Percy (c.1532-1585), from 1572 eighth earl of Northumberland, and Katherine Neville (1545/6-1596), daughter and coheir of John Neville, Lord Latimer; he was the elder brother of George Percy (1580-1632/3) and William Percy (1574-1648) the playwright was another of his brothers. After early instruction in the protestant faith from the vicar of Egremont, Cumberland, Percy went abroad to complete his education. He was probably in Paris when, on 21 June 1585, he succeeded to the earldom upon the suicide of his father in the Tower of London. In later life the earl confessed that his youth had been profligate, but he outgrew these indiscretions. He embarked upon a series of initiatives to improve returns from his estates, which lay not only in the family's traditional heartland of Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Cumberland, but also scattered right across England and Wales. This process continued over the next forty years. William Camden claims that Northumberland served as a volunteer against the Armada ('The History of the... Princess Elizabeth', 1688, 414). There is no further evidence for this, but the earl did visit the Low Countries in 1588, an experience which stimulated his lifelong interest in siege warfare and military tactics. 
During the 1590s the earl enjoyed a measure of favour at the hands of Queen Elizabeth. Though hardly well disposed to the Percy family, Elizabeth liked to indulge the young men at her court. She restored Northumberland to the eighth earl's governorship of Tynemouth Castle in 1591, and made him a knight of the Garter in 1593. Prudently, the earl avoided giving any offence in the exercise of religion: eschewing the attachment to Catholicism that had so blighted the careers of both his father and his uncle, he remained a lifelong member of the established church. 
In 1594 Northumberland married Lady Dorothy Perrott (died 1619), widow of Sir Thomas Perrott, son of Sir John Perrott, the late lord deputy in Ireland, and sister of Elizabeth's favourite, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex (1565-1601). Their marriage proved tempestuous, the Devereux connection turning sour as Essex's fortunes declined and Northumberland maintained his long-standing friendship with Devereux's adversary, Sir Walter Ralegh. In 1600 the earl again visited the Low Countries and, finding life there congenial, did not return until February 1601. He hurried home only after learning that his brother-in-law had staked and lost everything on rebellion. 
The variety of Northumberland's interests is illustrated by his well-stocked library. Insofar as it can be reconstructed, it consisted principally of books on science, medicine and anatomy, military matters, architecture, travel, and classical texts. At various times the earl was a patron to and friend of some notable scholars, including Walter Warner, Robert Hues and, particularly, Thomas Harriot, associated with the earl from the 1590s. Indeed, his patronage earned him notoriety, as an atheist and dabbler in forbidden knowledge, a 'wizard earl', a man 'who troubled not much himself' about religion (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/116). In addition to three 'Advices' of 'Instructions' to his son, sections of which were variously later published, the earl drafted a substantial work on the art of war and composed two literary conceits, 'Love' and 'Friends and Friendship'. Yet, although he was long troubled by deafness, and was described by one admiring contemporary as 'civill, modest and quyett', both 'inward and reserved' (BL, Hargrave MS 226, fols. 241-3), Northumberland was never the detached scholar. Household accounts provide ample evidence that he lived court life to the full, ready to sit at the gaming table and happy to participate in the ceremonial. 
Northumberland was rather easily led and incapable of keeping a secret, and there is, too, an occasional glimpse of ungovernable temper. In 1587 he was imprisoned for causing a disturbance at his mother's house, while in 1597 and 1602 he was only narrowly prevented from fighting duels with the earl of Southampton and Sir Francis Vere, an antagonist of long standing. In 1599, following the deaths of two infant sons in 1597 and the birth of a daughter, Dorothy (1598-1659), later married to Robert Sidney, earl of Leicester, the earl and his countess separated after a furious row. However, they were eventually reconciled, and further children followed: Lucy (1600-1660), later Lucy Hay, countess of Carlisle, Algernon Percy (1602-1668), later the tenth earl, and Henry Percy (c.1604-1659), later Baron Percy of Alnwick. 
Soon after Essex's downfall Northumberland, along with the queen's secretary, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Ralegh, and other leading courtiers, made secret overtures to James VI of Scotland against the time when Queen Elizabeth should die. As his go-between to Edinburgh the earl selected a trusted cousin and estate officer, Thomas Percy, and through the Catholic Percy he sought toleration for English Catholics. Giving vague assurances, James promised nothing. When, in March 1603, Elizabeth lay dying, Northumberland was among those invited to join the council in their deliberations, and there seems to have been a suggestion, perhaps from Cecil, that the earl should act as protector of the realm while James made his way south to London. 
Nothing came of this, but Northumberland nevertheless reaped an immediate reward in James's new world. He was sworn a member of the privy council in April 1603, and was appointed captain of the gentleman pensioners, the official royal bodyguard, in May. Once again, however, he risked advocating some form of toleration, forwarding a petition from English Catholics at one of his first meetings with James. This did not immediately mar the cordial relations between king and earl, but during the summer that all-important bond began to weaken. The dispatches of the French ambassador, Christophe Harlay, comte de Beaumont, are full of assertions that the English are dissatisfied with their king, and while Beaumont never names his source, the earl, a carefully cultivated friend, is an obvious suspect. Though each authority alone may be considered unreliable, the observations of Beaumont's compatriot, the marquis de Rosny, and the writings of various discontented Englishmen at Madrid and Brussels during the summer of 1603 together suggest that Northumberland was growing increasingly disillusioned with James and his Scottish entourage. 
Just when the council was investigating two linked conspiracies against the king, Northumberland put a foot wrong. On either 12 or 13 July 1603, in front of king and court, he spat in the face of his old adversary, Vere. James was deeply offended. The earl was banished from court to cool his heels in the archbishop of Canterbury's summer palace at Croydon. Vague rumours, almost certainly without foundation despite his friendship with Ralegh, one of the principal conspirators, linked Northumberland's name to the so-called Bye and Main treasons. On this occasion he survived and gradually began to rebuild his position at court. 
Two years later, he was not so fortunate. With the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot it was revealed that one of the ringleaders was none other than the trusty Thomas Percy. Northumberland, it transpired, had not only made Percy a gentleman pensioner, he had dispensed with the oath of supremacy which the king had ordered should be demanded from new members of the band. Still more damning, Percy had visited the earl for dinner on 4 November, the day before the projected destruction of the Lords. Northumberland always insisted that his private discussions with Percy that fateful day had touched on estate business -- nothing more -- but his arguments never quite convinced anyone else. Percy was killed soon afterwards in open rebellion: while he could never now accuse Northumberland of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, he was equally unable to clear him. As the earl put it, 'noen but he can shew me clere as the day, or darke as the night' (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/225). 
James and his council struggled to identify a nobleman sufficiently eminent to serve as protector of the realm had the plot succeeded. That mastermind was never found. The surviving plotters claimed that any decision on the protectorate had been deferred until after the explosion, but, again, their assurances failed to convince. Suspicion against Northumberland grew accordingly; no one could quite credit that Percy would have let him die in the Lords. After a lengthy examination on 23 November Northumberland was dispatched to the Tower on the twenty-seventh. 
Following months of government indecision, the earl was charged with contempt and on 27 June 1606 proceeded against in Star Chamber 'ore tenus', which could in theory only follow upon a confession of guilt by the accused. Northumberland's fellow councillors stripped him of all public offices, fined him $30,000 and condemned him to imprisonment during the king's pleasure. Some admitted that the penalties appeared harsh, but thought it appropriate that James should enjoy scope for clemency. The king, however, was disinclined to be generous. Northumberland remained in the Tower until June 1621, James's suspicions enduring long after the deaths of those councillors who in popular imagination and in the earl's increasingly mordant conceits had conspired to keep him under lock and key. His countess, a loyal and tireless visitor, died in August 1619 and Northumberland's grief at her passing was touchingly genuine. 
Liberation eventually came as part of an amnesty to mark James's fifty-fifth birthday. The earl emerged into a world greatly altered. Determined to improve his son's prospects at court, he cultivated both his son-in-law James Hay and the duke of Buckingham, setting aside his distaste for the parvenu courtier. Northumberland lived on for eleven years of placid retirement, at Petworth, Bath, and London and with his daughter Dorothy Sidney and her husband at Penshurst. He died at Petworth, apparently of a malignant disease, not inappropriately on 5 November 1632, and was buried there within twenty-four hours.

Percy, Henry, Baron Percy of Alnwick (c.1604-1659), royalist army officer, was a younger son of Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564-1632), and his wife, Dorothy (died 1619), daughter of Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex, and widow of Sir John Perrot. Henry was educated at a school in Isleworth under Thomas Willis; he subscribed at Christ Church, Oxford, on 7 December 1624. 
Percy entered politics by representing Marlborough in the parliament of 1628-9. When Charles I embarked upon his period of personal rule Percy naturally turned to the court for advancement. His early attempts to gain a 'place', first as secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer in March 1631 and afterwards to obtain the proprietorial command of a company in Thomas, Viscount Wentworth's, Irish army, both failed, but he did succeed in establishing himself within the circle of courtiers surrounding the queen, Henrietta Maria. As a royal favourite his career then prospered in a most gratifying manner, particularly as he was able to further the interests of his eldest brother, Algernon Percy, now tenth earl of Northumberland, and his brother-in-law Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester. 
In 1639 Percy was named a colonel in the army raised for the abortive war against the Scots. In October that year he also gained the extremely prestigious appointment of master of the horse to the prince of Wales, and in the following year he was appointed captain of the king's life guard. Returned as MP for the borough of Portsmouth in the Short Parliament, he rather more appropriately represented the county of Northumberland in the subsequent Long Parliament, until his progress was abruptly terminated by his involvement in the failed first army plot of March 1641. Unlike his late father James VI and I, Charles I was an enthusiastic but uniformly unsuccessful exponent of armed coups. In this particular case Percy, if not the originator, was certainly a chief conspirator in a scheme to bring the army down from the north into London in order to intimidate parliament, but upon the plot's being discovered he attempted to flee the country. Unfortunately he did not get very far, but was set upon by a mob in Sussex, beaten up, and forced into hiding. Badly frightened, he promptly presented his brother Northumberland with a detailed account of the conspiracy in return for his protection and immunity from prosecution. Percy claimed that he and his colleagues had merely been encouraging the army's officers to subscribe to an innocuous declaration of support for the king's policies. When at the king's instigation they had met Henry Jermyn and Sir John Suckling, whose parallel conspiracy did involve the use of armed force, Percy had opposed the more extreme plan and had reported back to the king who had vetoed it. This confession was enough to confirm parliament's suspicions and at the same time alienate Percy's erstwhile colleagues who unsurprisingly accused him of treachery. It was also, as he had hoped, sufficient to save him from impeachment and his only material punishment was his formal expulsion from the House of Commons on 9 December 1641. 
However, now equally unpopular with both sides, Percy judged it expedient to retire to France. An inveterate schemer, he nevertheless began to make himself useful to the queen, who similarly found herself forced abroad as the political situation worsened, and in a complete reversal of fortune he returned to England as her agent. Rather ironically in the circumstances, the queen wrote 'I think him very faithful and that we may trust him' ('DNB'). Armed with that remarkable endorsement he was appointed general of the ordnance on 22 May 1643 and created Baron Percy of Alnwick on 28 June. He possessed no discernible military qualifications to justify this, apart from his vicarious employment as a colonel in 1639, but the post was actually an administrative one rather than a combat command. The ordnance department was primarily responsible for the procurement, manufacture, storage, transportation, and issue of a wide variety of military hardware including cannon, ammunition of all calibres, muskets, bandoliers, pikes, and even the more mundane items such as spades, pickaxes, duckboards, and buckets. Much of the credit for this onerous job generally goes to his indefatigable deputy, Sir John Heydon, but there is no doubt that Percy did in fact take his duties fairly seriously and once famously grumbled that the train of artillery was a sponge which sucked up money and could never be satisfied. Despite their best efforts Percy and Heydon never managed to keep up with the insatiable demand for ammunition and, on the night of 20 September 1643, Percy reported that the day's fighting in the first Battle of Newbury had consumed no fewer than an astounding eighty barrels of powder and that only ten remained for the artillery and none for the infantry. The royalist army had in effect run out of ammunition in the middle of the battle and thus forfeited the king's only realistic chance of winning the war. 
In a more direct military role Percy had also become colonel of both a regiment of foot and a regiment of horse. The first had originally formed part of the escort to a large ammunition convoy, brought down from the north by Colonel Thomas Pinchbeck. Although most secondary sources state that these men came from Yorkshire, all the officers surviving in 1663 came from Northumberland so it is perhaps unsurprising that Percy should have taken them on. The origins of his regiment of horse are, however, rather more obscure. In 1644 Percy accompanied the king on the campaign which culminated in the victory at Cropredy Bridge on 29 June, and afterwards went with him into the west country, but on 14 August was unexpectedly forced to resign his post as general of the ordnance after being implicated in Lord Wilmot's plot to seek an accommodation with parliament. Initially he appears to have retained his regiments, but finally he lost them when he was arrested on 11 January 1645 on a charge of corresponding with the enemy. There seems no reason to doubt the truth of these charges, for not only was the outlook becoming increasingly bleak for the royalists, but Percy was also subject to conflicting family loyalties. Although, as a courtier, he was himself firmly attached to the queen's party, both his elder brother, Northumberland, and his cousin, Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, were equally committed parliamentarians. It was perhaps in recognition of these difficult circumstances that Percy was released from custody a few weeks later, and having obtained a pass from his cousin, took ship for France where he once again rejoined the queen. 
Despite being a favourite of the queen, he was, not surprisingly, distrusted by many of his fellow exiles. He was, perhaps rather hopefully, reported to have been wounded in a duel with Prince Rupert in March 1648, and was briefly arrested after a quarrel with Lord Colepeper in the following October. Nevertheless in time he mellowed and was appointed lord chamberlain and admitted to Charles II's emigre privy council in 1653. Although this initially aroused considerable resentment in certain quarters he was subsequently reconciled with Edward Hyde (later earl of Clarendon) who dissuaded him from making his peace with the lord protector, Oliver Cromwell. Destined never to see England again, Percy died unmarried in France, probably in Paris, on 26 March 1659. Although Clarendon recorded that during the war 'he was generally unloved as a proud and supercilious person' (Clarendon, 'Hist. rebellion', 3.393), he also praised his economical handling of the exiled king's household, and his tenure as general of the ordnance shows some genuine administrative ability.

Percy, Henry (1785-1825), army officer, fifth son of Algernon Percy, second Baron Lovaine and (from 1790) first earl of Beverley (1750-1830), and his wife, Isabella Susannah (1750-1812), 'nee' Burrell, was born on 14 September 1785; Algernon Percy was the brother of Hugh Percy, bishop of Carlisle, and of Vice-Admiral Josceline Percy. Educated at Eton College, on 16 August 1804 Henry Percy was appointed lieutenant in the 7th fusiliers. He became captain unattached on 9 October 1806 and captain 7th fusiliers on 6 November. He was aide-de-camp to Sir John Moore at Corunna. On 21 June 1810 he transferred as captain to the 14th light dragoons. He was taken prisoner during the retreat from Burgos in 1812, and was detained in France until the peace. He had at least two illegitimate sons, one of whom, with a Frenchwoman, Jeanne Durand, was Henry Marion Durand. 
In 1815 Percy was appointed aide-de-camp to the duke of Wellington. He brought home the Waterloo dispatches, arriving by post-chaise in London on the evening of 20 June with the dispatches and captured eagles, and was next day made CB, and a brevet lieutenant-colonel from 18 June 1815. He retired on half pay in 1821. From 1823 until his death he was MP for Bene Alston, Devon, a burgage borough controlled by his father. Once a dashing, handsome young man, Percy prematurely lost his health. He died at his father's house in Portman Square, London, on 15 April 1825, and was buried in St Marylebone cemetery.

Percy, Lord Henry Hugh Manvers (1817-1877), army officer, third son of George Percy, fifth duke of Northumberland (1778-1867), and his wife, Louisa Harcourt (1781-1848), third daughter of the Hon. James Archibald Stuart-Wortley Mackenzie, was born at Burwood House, Cobham, Surrey, on 22 August 1817, and educated at Eton College (1832-5). He entered the army as ensign in the Grenadier Guards on 1 July 1836, and served during the insurrection in Canada in 1838. As captain and lieutenant-colonel of his regiment he served in the Crimean War, including the battles of the Alma, where he was wounded, Balaklava, Inkerman, where he was again wounded, and the siege of Sevastopol. At the battle of Inkerman, on 5 November 1854, he found himself, with many men of various regiments who had charged too far, nearly surrounded by the Russians, and without ammunition. By his knowledge of the ground, although wounded, he extricated these men, and, passing under a heavy fire from the Russians then in the Sandbag Battery, brought them safe to where ammunition was to be obtained. He thereby saved about fifty men and enabled them to renew the combat. For this act of bravery he was, on 5 May 1857, rewarded with the Victoria Cross. For a short period he held the local rank of brigadier-general in command of the British Italian Legion in the Crimea. From 29 June 1855 to 10 February 1865 he was an aide-de-camp to the queen. During the December 1861 'Trent' crisis he was sent to New Brunswick in command of the 1st battalion, Grenadier Guards. He had been promoted major in 1860 and retired from active service on 3 October 1862. He was Conservative MP for North Northumberland from 19 July 1865 to 11 November 1868. He was appointed colonel of the 89th regiment on 28 May 1874, and was made a general on 1 October 1877. On 24 May 1873 he was made a KCB. He was found dead in his bed at his residence, 40 Eaton Square, London, on 3 December 1877, and was buried in the Northumberland vault in Westminster Abbey on 7 December. He was unmarried.

Percy, Hugh, first duke of Northumberland (bap. 1712, d. 1786), politician, was the only son of Langdale Smithson ('b'. 'c'.1682) and Philadelphia Reveley ('bap'. 1688, died 1764), the daughter of William Reveley. He was baptized on 10 December 1712 at Kirby Wiske, near Northallerton, Yorkshire, and very close to Newby Wiske, which was the home of his mother, whose family had moved there from Northumberland. The Smithsons had made their money as haberdashers in Cheapside; they purchased Stanwick, near Catterick, in 1638, supported the king in the civil war, and obtained a baronetcy from Charles II in 1663. Brought up as a Catholic, Smithson conformed at the time of his father's death in the 1720s. 
Smithson's genealogical luck was phenomenal. His father died early and he inherited the baronetcy from his grandfather Sir Hugh Smithson, third baronet, in 1729, at the age of seventeen. He was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1730. In 1734 his sister Dorothy died, leaving him $10,000. By 1738 he was sheriff of Yorkshire. In 1740, a cousin, Michael Godfrey Smithson, having died, he inherited estates in Middlesex and at Armin, near Goole, from Hugh Smithson MP, his grandfather's first cousin. In the same year he was elected MP for Middlesex (which Hugh Smithson had represented), defeating Henry Barker, a whig, with little difficulty. Meanwhile, in 1739 at Swillington, he had become acquainted with Elizabeth Seymour (1716-1776) ['see 'Percy, Elizabeth], the daughter of Algernon Seymour, seventh duke of Somerset (1684-1750) ['see under 'Seymour, Charles, sixth duke of Somerset], and his wife, Frances Seymour, nee Thynne (1699-1754). Her grandmother, Elizabeth Seymour (1667-1722), had been heir to all the Percy estates in Middlesex and Northumberland, being the only surviving child of Josceline Percy, eleventh earl of Northumberland, who died in 1670. Smithson's estate at this time was said to be worth $4000 per annum, with $3000 per annum more to come by inheritance. Despite opposition from Elizabeth's grandfather, Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset ('the proud duke'), their marriage took place on 16 July 1740. They had two sons and one daughter. In 1744 Elizabeth's brother George Seymour died of smallpox on the grand tour, leaving her sole heir. 
Smithson's political career began in opposition to Walpole, and he voted with the tories against the employment of Hanoverian troops in 1742 and 1744. The Jacobite rising of 1745, during which he displayed zeal for the Hanoverian succession, gave him the chance to transfer to the Pelhamite whigs. He spoke on the government side in April 1747 on the bill to abolish hereditable jursidictions in Scotland and at the general election of 1747 was once more returned for Middlesex, this time as a government candidate. 
Smithson's first objective was to safeguard his wife's inheritance. In 1744 the duke of Somerset asked George II for the earldom of Northumberland, with a special remainder to his grandson Sir Charles Wyndham, thus cutting out his granddaughter. At an audience with the king, Smithson protested successfully on behalf of his father-in-law, Lord Hertford. On Somerset's death in 1748, the seventh duke of Somerset persuaded the king to grant him the earldom of Northumberland, with a special remainder to Smithson and his heirs by Lady Elizabeth. The Wyndhams were bought off with the earldom of Egremont. Smithson succeeded to the title in February 1750 and assumed the name Percy by act of parliament. 'Earl Smithson' was a predictable sneer, yet honours now crowded upon him. He took his seat in the Lords on 1 March 1750 and in January 1751 moved the address to the throne. In January 1753 he was appointed a lord of the bedchamber, in March 1753 he was made lord lieutenant of Northumberland, and in 1756 he was given the Garter. He steered clear of party commitments. During the struggle between Fox, Pitt, and Newcastle in June 1757 he was reported to have said: 'Let who will resign; he would not, but would support whatever minister the king appointed' ('Eighth Report', HMC, 1.225a). 
Northumberland's next task was to build up his political base. The estates of the family, which had been neglected by the sixth duke of Somerset, were taken in hand, and an income of some $8000 per annum was raised to $50,000 per annum, largely by exploiting coal measures. He also bought up advowsons and by the end of his life held more than a dozen. His electoral interest, which was little more than one seat for Northumberland in 1750, was increased to seven seats, mainly by the purchase in the 1770s of three boroughs in Cornwall and Devon with two seats apiece. He overreached himself at the general election of 1774 when an attempt to carry both seats in Northumberland failed, but by the 1780s he commanded one of the largest parliamentary groups. 
Northumberland's progress continued in the next reign. George III at once appointed him a lord of the bedchamber in November 1760. He became lord chamberlain to Queen Charlotte in May 1762, was sworn of the privy council in November, and succeeded Newcastle as lord lieutenant of Middlesex in December 1762. He was on close terms with the king's minister Lord Bute, and his son married Bute's daughter in 1764. In the reorganization that followed Bute's decision to retire in 1763, Northumberland came up as a possible replacement: John Calcraft wrote to Shelburne in March 1763 that, 'with our hold on Lord Northumberland, is it possible to think of placing him as a great lord... at the head of the Treasury, either for some short time, or till you could take it?' (Fitzmaurice, 1.195-6). Fox's proposal was to make him lord privy seal, but in the end George Grenville became first minister and Northumberland went to Ireland as lord lieutenant, arriving on 21 September 1763. 
Northumberland remained in that post from April 1763 until May 1765. His wealth enabled him to entertain lavishly, much to his wife's liking; Horace Walpole called her 'junketaceous' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 38.59). Halifax, the secretary of state, however, was not an easy man to work with, and Northumberland complained of his incivility. The political situation at Dublin was difficult, with Edmund Pery and the patriots pressing for constitutional concessions -- habeas corpus, a septennial act, and restrictions on the Irish pensions list. Ministers at Westminster were irritated at the Irish address on the peace treaty, which was pointedly unenthusiastic. On 10 November, Northumberland wrote urgently for instructions whether he should punish unreliable placemen or 'temporize': Halifax, in reply, though exasperated, recommended mildness and offered some pension concessions. The award of a grand title, vice-admiral of all America, in December 1764 was a sop -- 'a mere feather' in Walpole's phrase (Walpole, 'Corr.', 38.492, 497). 
As early as January 1765 Northumberland was indicating reluctance to continue, pleading ill health. Grenville's suspicions of his Bute connections were reinforced in April 1765 when the king asked him to sound out a change of government, bringing in Pitt and the Rockinghams. Northumberland approached Cumberland, who was to act as broker, at a meeting in the stables at Newmarket. The proposal that Northumberland might act as first lord of the Treasury was raised, but Lord Temple, Pitt's brother-in-law, angrily refused to serve under 'Bute's Lieutenant'. The negotiations broke down, Grenville stayed in office, and Northumberland was replaced as lord lieutenant by Lord Weymouth. 
When Rockingham replaced Grenville in July 1765, the king hoped that a place would be found for Northumberland. At one stage he was considered for the French embassy. But though he remained on friendly terms and voted for the repeal of the 'Stamp Act', the Bute connection held him back. In May 1766, when the king had tired of the Rockinghams, Northumberland was again involved in negotiations to change the ministry. This time he did not emerge empty handed. Pitt agreed to take office. When the lord chamberlainship and the mastership of the horse, which he had wanted, went elsewhere, Northumberland complained that he had received no mark of favour for his Irish exertions. Pitt suggested a step up in the peerage to a marquessate, but Northumberland held out for a dukedom, which the king, plainly disconcerted, granted with some reluctance rather than offend Pitt at the outset. 
Although Northumberland had assured the king that he would not again solicit office, his political aspirations were by no means extinguished. In May 1767, with Chatham mysteriously ill, Walpole reported that opposition hoped Northumberland would be called upon to preside over a ministry of Lord Bute's friends ['see 'King's friends]. A year later, Burke told Rockingham that the Bedfords named the duke 'for a proper person for the Treasury' ('The Correspondence of Edmund Burke', ed. T. W. Copeland and others, 10 vols., 1958-78, 2.5). In October 1769 Rockingham, in another conversation at Newmarket, found the duke 'very hostile to the present administration' (ibid., 2.91). When Grafton and Camden resigned in January 1770, Northumberland moved into opposition, joining in a number of protests over the Middlesex election issue. He fought hard to retain his position in Middlesex and Westminster. The first was lost to the Wilkite radicals, but Westminster, which his eldest son, Hugh Percy, had represented since 1763, was retained in 1768 and 1774. In 1776 Northumberland was joined in the Lords by his son, who succeeded to his mother's barony, becoming Lord Percy. Each of them toyed with opposition, but in February 1778 Northumberland was once more employed by the king to discover whether Chatham would join North's ministry. The negotiation failed, but in December 1778 Northumberland resumed office as master of the horse, though Walpole wrote that he had gout and was too lame to ride, and even the king admitted that he was 'not capable of attending much' ('Correspondence of George III', 4.209, letter no. 2436). He held the post until December 1780, when he retired on grounds of ill health. 
It was no more than an indication of the king's desperation that he should mention Northumberland in March 1783 to head a ministry to save him from the Fox-North coalition. Nothing came of it, but later that year Northumberland had one more card to play. He voted in December against Fox's 'India Bill', as the king wished, and the following month, while Pitt's new ministry faced a hostile House of Commons, his seven votes were at a premium. The price of his 'zeal' was the barony of Lovaine, to descend to his second son, Lord Algernon, raised in 1790 to the earldom of Beverley. Northumberland died at Sion House, Middlesex, on 6 June 1786 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 21 June. 
Northumberland's remarkable rise drew upon him envy and scorn. Walpole maintained a battery of sneers against his pretensions and 'Percy blood'. George III's impression of him was not, at first, very flattering: of the proposal to make him lord chamberlain to the Queen, he wrote to Bute in 1762: 'I think him quite cut out for the nothingness of the employment' (George III, 'Letters... to Lord Bute, 1756-1766', ed. R. Sedgwick, 1939, no. 229). But Northumberland was a handsome man of good presence, his property gave him a certain independence of mind, and he was far from foolish. His position as lord lieutenant of Middlesex brought him considerable unpopularity. During the Wilkite riots of 1769 he was accused of hiring an election mob and threatened with a prosecution. In 1780 the Gordon rioters remembered his family's Catholic origins: he was assaulted and had his pocket picked, and the windows of Northumberland House were broken. His great wealth meant that office was not essential to him and he seems soon to have tired of the routine of attendance and administration. He was FRS, a trustee of the new British Museum, a discerning patron of the arts, and courteous to Johnson, Goldsmith, Thomas Percy, and the botanist John Hill. Northumberland House and Sion House were greatly embellished, and he employed James Paine, Robert Adam, and Capability Brown on a massive rehabilitation of Alnwick Castle. In 1756 he was reported to be 'making fine things there', and in 1768 it was said that 'the old naked castle is now the noblest seat I think in the kingdom' ('Buckinghamshire MSS', 261, 264-5). 
Northumberland's eldest son, Lord Hugh, had a distinguished army career: his second son, Lord Algernon, represented Northumberland from 1774 until 1786 but was in poor health and of a retiring disposition. The duchess, regarded as a peeress in her own right, was prominent in society -- 'constantly wagging' (running around), in George Selwyn's phrase; parts of her journal were published in 1926 as 'The Diaries of a Duchess'. She was a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Charlotte until 1770, when her husband's temporary move into opposition prompted her to resign. One of the duke's illegitimate children, James Smithson (1764-1829), was a chemist and mineralogist and left money to found the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.

Percy, Hugh, second duke of Northumberland (1742-1817), army officer and politician, was born in the parish of St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 14 August 1742. He was the eldest son of Sir Hugh Smithson ('bap'. 1712, died 1786) ['see 'Percy, Hugh, first duke of Northumberland] and Lady Elizabeth Smithson (1716-1776) ['see 'Percy, Elizabeth], who in April 1750 adopted the name Percy in place of Smithson on Sir Hugh's inheriting the title of earl of Northumberland from his wife's father, Algernon Seymour, seventh duke of Somerset. From 1750 until his father became first duke of Northumberland in October 1766, Hugh Percy was styled Lord Warkworth. Thereafter, until he inherited his father's dukedom, he was generally known as Lord or Earl Percy. 
Percy was educated at Eton College from 1753 to 1758, and then at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1760. On 1 May 1759, not yet aged seventeen, he was gazetted ensign in the 24th foot; four months later he exchanged to the 85th with the rank of captain. He may have served at the battle of Minden as a volunteer, and in 1762 he became lieutenant-colonel of the newly raised 111th foot and received a commission as a lieutenant-colonel in the Grenadier Guards. 
In 1763 and again at the 1768 general election, Percy was elected, unopposed, an MP for Westminster. In the Commons he supported the Grenville ministry, and in February 1766 he voted against the repeal of the 'Stamp Act'. He aligned himself with the Chatham administration, and in December 1768 became colonel of the 5th foot. In 1770 Percy and his father went into opposition to the new ministry led by Lord North. Nevertheless, George III threw his electoral weight behind Percy and Lord Thomas Clinton in the 1774 general election, mainly because the alternative candidates for Westminster were Wilkite radicals of whom the king disapproved still more. The decisive factors in Percy's victory, however, were probably the local influence of his father and the direct involvement of his mother, who, according to Walpole (Walpole, 428), 'Sat daily at a window in Covent Garden making interest for her son'. 
Percy himself took no part in the election campaign; he had departed with his regiment in May 1774 for service in North America. He watched with increasing dismay as the situation deteriorated in New England: 'this Country', he told his father on 12 September, 'is now in as open state of Rebellion as Scotland was in the year 45' (Percy papers, vol. L, pt A, fol. 16). When at length hostilities began at Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775 Percy played a crucial role in saving Lieutenant-Colonel Smith's force from destruction as it retreated to Boston. Percy's brigade, together with two field pieces, met Smith's beleaguered column on the road between Menotomy and Lexington. Percy's troops held the enraged Massachusetts militiamen at bay while Smith's men regrouped, and then escorted Smith's battered command back to Boston under heavy fire. His coolness was widely praised, and he became the hero of the hour in besieged Boston. In July 1775 he was appointed major-general in America, and in September major-general in the army. 
In 1776 Percy was involved in the campaign in and around New York. After the British victory on Long Island (27 August 1776) he wrote that the Americans 'will never again stand before us in the Field. Things seem to be over with Them & I flatter myself now that this Campaign will put a total End to the War' ('Letters', 69) -- a misjudgement, but one shared by many of his colleagues. He took part in the storming of Fort Washington on 16 November 1776, and at the beginning of December he went with General Clinton on the expedition to occupy Newport, Rhode Island. In January 1777 Clinton left Rhode Island for England, leaving Percy in charge of the garrison. 
Over the next few weeks Percy's relationship with General Sir William Howe (1729-1814), the British commander-in-chief in America, rapidly deteriorated. Percy complained at Howe's decision to reduce the number of troops under his command in order to reinforce the army operating in New Jersey. He was further aggrieved when Howe pressed him to send a large quantity of forage to New York, which Percy believed could not be spared. When Howe criticized a civil appointment that Percy had made on Rhode Island, then reversed the decision of a court martial over which Percy had presided, and finally implied that he should have taken Providence as well as Newport in the preceding December, Percy decided that he would not allow himself to be 'subject to another such indignity' (Willcox, 127-8). Howe, for his part, regarded Percy as over-sensitive and too status-conscious: 'he thinks I have not treated him according to his rank as an Offr. & 'Heir apparent' to ye Dukedom of Northumberland' (Howe to General James Grant, 18 March 1777, Macpherson Grant papers, bundle 252). Percy returned to England on 5 May, his departure lamented by both the army and the civilian population of Rhode Island, where his humanity and concern for the inhabitants earned him much popularity. Ostensibly, he left America to inherit the Percy barony from his mother, but the real reason for his return home was soon widely known. 
Back in England, Percy was promoted in August 1777 lieutenant-general, but he played no further active part in military operations during the American war. In November 1784 he was appointed colonel of the second troop of Horse Grenadier Guards. He inherited his father's dukedom in June 1786, and was lord lieutenant and vice-admiral of Northumberland in 1786-99 and 1802-17. He was promoted general in October 1793, and was colonel of the Royal Horse Guards from December 1806 to 1812. 
Percy married on 2 July 1764 Lady Anne Stuart ('b'. 1746), third daughter of John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713-1792); they had no children. The fashionable 'Town and Country Magazine' of London alleged in 1772 that Percy was virtually impotent from masturbation at school and frequenting brothels in his youth, and that his wife was a 'notoriously promiscuous adulteress' (Stone, 258). He divorced her by act of parliament (16 March 1779) for criminal conversation with William Bird of Trinity College, Cambridge. Percy then married on 25 May 1779 his sister-in-law Frances Julia (1752-1820), third daughter of Peter Burrell of Langley Park, Beckenham, Kent; they had three sons, including Algernon Percy, and two daughters. He was one of the richest men in England, his wealth increased by mines in Northumberland. According to the 'Gentleman's Magazine' obituary his annual income was estimated at not less than $80,000. He was extravagant and generous. He paid fares home for widows of men of his regiment killed in America. After 1815 when agricultural prices fell he reduced his rents by a quarter; his grateful tenants erected a memorial column in 1816. 
In politics, although at first an admirer of Pitt, Percy veered towards the opposition, was a leader of the 'armed neutrality', during the 1789 regency crisis, and subsequently joined the prince of Wales's circle. When in 1797 he was approached by Lord Moira with a view to reviving the 'armed neutrality', he eventually withheld support, remarking that no ministry could last two whole sessions of parliament against both Pitt and Fox. In 1803 he declined joining on attack on Addington, on the grounds that it would make room for Pitt, whose principles he detested. That year, on the resumption of war with France, he resigned the lord lieutenancy of Northumberland in protest at the military arrangements then put in place. Nevertheless, in view of the threatened invasion he raised at his own expense a volunteer unit from his tenantry. He was also dissatisfied with the 1806 coalition of the Foxite whigs with his hated cousin Lord Grenville. Complaining he had not been consulted, he initially instructed his parliamentary interest (principally his Cornish boroughs) to withhold support from the ministry of all the talents. It took the prince of Wales's intervention to secure Percy's reconciliation with Fox. Percy was a competent soldier but very mediocre politician: his family pride militated against success in either field. 
Percy died of rheumatic gout at Northumberland House, Strand, London, on 10 July 1817 and was buried on 19 July 1817 in the family vault (built in 1776 for his mother) in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Hugh Percy (1785-1847).

Percy, Hugh, third duke of Northumberland (1785-1847), politician and landowner, was born on 20 April 1785, the eldest son of Hugh Percy, second duke (1742-1817), and his second wife, Frances Julia, 'nee' Burrell (1779-1820). He was educated at Eton College and at St John's College, Cambridge, obtaining an MA in 1805 and an LLD in 1809. A tory like his father, but of a more moderate variety, he was elected MP for Buckingham in August 1806 and for Westminster in October the same year, and in May 1807 won a contested election for the county of Northumberland and an uncontested election for Launceston, which he had represented since the previous November, and where the Percys exercised political patronage. He chose to sit for the former, and continued to do so until summoned to the Lords in 1812 as Baron Percy, during his father's lifetime. Percy rarely spoke: his most dramatic, and puzzling, Commons interventions came in 1807 when he first tried to turn the 'Slave Trade Abolition Bill' into a 'Slavery Abolition Bill' by moving an amendment to emancipate every black child born after 1 January 1810. After the 'Slave Trade Abolition Bill' had been passed on 16 March 1807 he moved the next day to introduce a new bill for the gradual abolition of slavery itself through the freeing of all slave children born after a date to be fixed. He may have been an ardent, and impetuous, anti-slaver, as many supposed, but since his move was vehemently opposed by Wilberforce on the tactical grounds that the hostility provoked by pressing the larger measure of total abolition would endanger the chances in the Lords of the lesser measure of abolition of the slave trade, it is just as likely that Percy was indulging in a wrecking ploy. Certainly he was known as a high tory on the Catholic question, and there is no record that he ever spoke on slavery matters again after 1807. His subsequent parliamentary utterances were infrequent and illiberal. In 1819, as lord lieutenant of Northumberland, he strongly supported a bill to prohibit all drilling and training without a licence from a lord lieutenant, citing as fact an alarmist rumour that between the rivers Tyne and Wear there were 100,000 armed men ready to rise, including 16,000 armed colliers. In 1820 he took the government line in the Queen Caroline affair, denouncing her 'most indecent conduct' and the 'adulterous intercourse between her and Bergami' ('Hansard 1', 6 Nov 1820, 1669); his next, and last, speech came in 1832, when he called for the protection of the rights of lords of manors in a bill intended to encourage the employment of agricultural labourers. 
On 29 April 1817 at Northumberland House, London, Percy married Lady Charlotte Florentia Clive (died 1866), second daughter of Edward Clive, first earl of Powis, and granddaughter of Robert Clive, scarcely three months, as it turned out, before he succeeded to the dukedom. It was accounted a successful marriage. Greville thought the duke: 'a very good sort of man, with a very narrow understanding, an eternal talker, and a prodigious bore. The Duchess is a more sensible woman, and amiable and good humoured. He is supposed to be ruled in all things by her advice. ('Greville Memoirs', 1.164)' Mrs Arbuthnot agreed that 'she is excessively good humoured and has very popular manners' and noted that 'he is as rich as Croesus, [and] fond of magnificence' ('Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot', 2.231). He covered his wife with diamonds, but they had no children. An opportunity for public display of his opulence and extravagance came in 1825 when he went to Paris as special ambassador at the coronation of Charles X with a magnificent spread of costumes, liveries, and plate all provided at his own expense. Four years later this outfit came in handy when he was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland with instructions to give Dublin a semi-regal performance: a caravan carrying $90,000 worth of the duke's plate from the Paris mission was seen passing through Staffordshire on its way to Dublin, escorted by a body of soldiers. The previous lord lieutenant, the marquess of Anglesey, was dismissed at the end of 1828 because he was deemed to have gone native in his warmth towards the Catholics, meeting both O'Connell and Lord Clancurry (who had been in the Tower for treason in 1798), and Northumberland was sent to be a firm and dignified governor, aloof from politics. Some contemporaries found it a surprising appointment, considering the duke's political inexperience, and his reputation as 'a stupid, prosing, man' and 'an amazing bore' (ibid., 2.231, 241), and his strong anti-Catholic views. Nevertheless it was, in Peel's view, an inspired choice: when Northumberland resigned along with the Wellington government in November 1830 he described him as 'the best chief Governor who ever presided over her [Ireland's] affairs' (Gash, 654). In its obituary in 1847, however, 'The Times' was lukewarm about his viceroyalty, remarking that 'he possessed neither the talent nor the energy to make himself thoroughly hated' (13 Feb 1847). The duke was stolidly unimaginative, rather than stupid -- a standing joke was that he gave a deputation of distressed weavers an order for a waistcoat -- but unthinking stolidity and unquestioning faith in the duke (Wellington) were exactly what was required in Dublin in 1829-30 to see through the implementation of Catholic emancipation by its previous opponents without encouraging triumphalist behaviour on the part of the Catholic Association, which was suppressed. 
No further public appointments came the duke's way after the Irish viceroyalty, and he retired to Northumberland, with seasonal visits to Northumberland House whose views onto the Thames he defended vigorously against various threats by railway speculators. He became a governor of King's College, London, in 1831, a trustee of the British Museum in 1834, high steward of Cambridge University also in 1834, and chancellor in 1840. He was not popular in Northumberland, where he was regarded as unfriendly, reactionary, and self-important, with some justification. He made continual encroachments on common rights, and he contrived the exclusion of the borough of Alnwick from the 'Municipal Reform Act' of 1835. He persisted in regarding the coalminers, on whom a significant part of his wealth depended, as unruly, disaffected, and potentially rebellious, and was always ready to use force to break strikes; at the height of the 1844 miners' strike he warned the home secretary, Sir James Graham, that 'masses of people may be forwarded by Rail Road and Steamer to a given spot, far beyond the controul ['sic'] of the Civil Power' (Alnwick MSS, third duke's letter-book, August 1844). He spent quite freely on improving the comforts of Alnwick Castle, and while he discussed agricultural improvements with his commissioners (land agents) he never got round to carrying them out, but he supported many local charities. He wrote to Wellington, as master of Trinity House, about Grace Darling's part in rescuing nine people from the wreck of the steamship 'Forfarshire' on Starket Rock, Farne Islands, within days of its happening in September 1838, and was fully appreciative of her heroism. 
On 12 February 1847 Northumberland was found dead in his bed at Alnwick. 'The Times' observed that 'of the House of Lords he was by no means a distinguished member' and that 'he was a man whose intellect and attainments procured for him a very moderate degree of respect' (13 Feb 1847). Nevertheless, his death occasioned county-wide mourning, thousands went to his lying-in-state in Alnwick Castle, the road from Alnwick to Gateshead Station was lined almost throughout for his funeral procession, platforms of stations on the route to London were crowded with people to see the special funeral train pass, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey on 23 February with great pomp. He was succeeded by his brother Algernon, and his widow lived on a jointure of $12,500 a year until her death in 1866.

Percy, Hugh (1784-1856), bishop of Carlisle, the third son of Algernon Percy, first earl of Beverley (1750-1830), and Isabella Susannah (1750-1812), second daughter of Peter Burrell and sister of Lord Gwydyr, was born in London on 29 January 1784. His mother was sister to Frances Julia Burrell, who married Hugh Percy, second duke of Northumberland. Henry Percy and Josceline Percy were his brothers. He was educated at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in December 1802, graduating MA in 1805 and DD in 1825; he was admitted 'ad eundem' at Oxford in 1834. Having taken holy orders, he married, on 19 May 1806, Mary, eldest daughter of Mary and Charles Manners Sutton, archbishop of Canterbury, by whom in 1809 he was collated to the benefices of Bishopsbourne and Ivychurch, Kent. In 1810 he was appointed chancellor and prebendary of Exeter, which appointments he held until 1816. On 21 December 1812 he was installed chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral. In 1816 he was collated by his father-in-law to a prebendal stall at Canterbury Cathedral, and in the same year he received the enormously rich stall of Finsbury at St Paul's, which he held until his death. The income from these livings and stalls was over $6000 p.a. In 1822 he was made archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1825, on the death of Gerrard Andrewes, he was raised to the deanery. Two years later (15 July 1827), on the death of Walker King, he was consecrated bishop of Rochester, from which see, after a few months' tenure, he was translated, on the death of Samuel Goodenough, to that of Carlisle. This was just before his father-in-law's death. This bishopric he held until his death. 
While dean of Canterbury Percy promoted the repair of the interior of the cathedral, 'clearing off the whitewash and removing modern incongruities', personally superintending the work. As a bishop, he was an opponent of the ecclesiastical commission's attempts to reform the church. He became a public enemy of the commissioners when in 1846 they reduced his subsidy from $2000 to $1500 p.a. Despite pressure, he refused to resign his chancellorship or his prebend. Geoffrey Best sees him as one of the 'conspicuous episcopal survivals from the prehistoric Hanoverian church' (Best, 404). Within his diocese Percy was less reactionary, though he was not popular; during the Chartist period bricks were thrown at him in Carlisle and his effigy burned. In 1838 he established a clergy aid society, and in 1855 a diocesan education society. He built thirteen new churches or chapels and rebuilt eighteen. He was first president of the Cumberland Infirmary, on which he spent much effort (a ward in the infirmary was named after him). He found Rose Castle, the episcopal residence, much dilapidated and deformed with incongruous additions. Determined to make it worthy of the see, he called in the Quaker architect Thomas Rickman, under whose directions the house was entirely remodelled without any detriment to its medieval character. The main cost was defrayed out of the episcopal revenues, but Percy is stated to have spent $40,000 of his own money on the gardens, grounds, and outbuildings. A rosary, in which he delighted, was laid out by Sir Joseph Paxton, who also formed the terraced gardens. Percy was a high-churchman, and disliked Tractarians and evangelicals. He 'set not his affection on mediaeval frippery' ('Carlisle Patriot', 9 Feb 1856). He was, Ellen Goodwin recalled, 'a great farmer; he was reputed the best judge of a horse in all the district.... He used to drive his own four horses all the way to London and to say there was no such hill as 'Rose Brow' in all the distance. (Bouch, 387)' Dictatorial and distant from his clergy, he had by the end of his life become a noted local character.Percy's first wife, with whom he had a large family of three sons and eight daughters, died in September 1831. He married, second, on 3 February 1840, Mary, the daughter of Sir William Hope Johnstone. His eldest son, Algernon, married Emily, daughter of Bishop Reginald Heber and heir of her uncle, Richard Heber, and assumed the name of Heber in addition to his own. Percy died at Rose Castle on 5 February 1856, and was buried in the parish churchyard of Dalston.

Percy, James (1619-c.1690), peerage claimant, was born at Harrowden, Northamptonshire, the eldest surviving son of Henry Percy, a servant in the household of Lord Chancellor Francis Bacon, and his wife, Lydia, daughter of Robert Cope of Horton, Northamptonshire. The elder Percy left Bacon's service following the chancellor's fall and moved to Dunnington, Lincolnshire, where in 1626 he deserted his family for London, taking with him a maidservant, with whom he had at least one son. The family, in serious want, relocated to Ireland, where James's uncle, James Percy, had emigrated. The young James took up trunk-making in Dublin, and built up a successful business, eventually setting himself up as a merchant. At an unknown date he married Sarah Sayer (died in or before 1670). Percy's efforts brought him a modest fortune and the self-confidence he needed to pursue his claim to noble blood. After his uncle's death in 1654 he travelled to England, where he presented himself to the tenth earl of Northumberland as the head of the Irish branch of the family. Percy later claimed that both the tenth earl and his son Josceline Percy, the eleventh earl, acknowledged his relationship. 
The eleventh earl died with no male heir at Turin on 21 May 1670. His countess, pregnant at the time, later gave birth to a stillborn child. Shortly afterwards, in February 1671, Percy entered his claim to the title. His faith in his right to the earldom was strong: when it was disputed by the eleventh earl's mother and wife on behalf of the three-year-old heir, Lady Elizabeth Percy, he was at first taken aback, but afterwards determined to triumph over the 'high privilege, policy, and potency of his opponents' ('House of Lords MSS', 1.213), and so he embarked upon a ruinous twenty-year struggle, the final result of which was complete failure. 
Percy could prove his descent from his grandfather, Henry Percy of Pavenham, Buckinghamshire, but establishing his connection to the main line of the family proved far more difficult. Not surprisingly the countess refused to allow him access to the family papers, without which, Percy argued, he could not prove his right. In his first effort he claimed the title as the great-grandson of Sir Richard Percy, a soldier and fifth son of the eighth earl. Unfortunately there were no documents to prove the relationship and, moreover, for it to be true Sir Richard would have to have been a grandfather at sixteen and a great-grandfather at forty-four. But the House of Lords refused to dismiss Percy's case out of hand, and in February 1673 gave both sides a month to gather evidence. In March they appeared at the bar, where testimony regarding Sir Richard's age carried the day. At the motion of the earl of Suffolk, the dowager countess's brother, Percy's petition was rejected. Nothing daunted he continued his struggle against formidable odds. In succeeding years he petitioned the king, the Lords, the Commons, and the duke of York. Further research led him to modify his claim, and in 1677 he identified another younger son of the house of Percy as his great-grandfather: Sir Ingelgram, third son of the fifth earl. Once again there was no written evidence backing his assertion. In fact, Percy's case was a weak one: Sir Ingelgram had very probably died about 1540 leaving only a single illegitimate daughter. Nevertheless, the dowager countess was not prepared to leave the case to mere proofs of evidence. She and her allies exploited their parliamentary privileges, forcing repeated delays in court, and they launched vexatious suits, forcing Percy to defend himself at great expense for years. These set-backs put his claim ever farther out of reach, though they also won him some public sympathy. Further attempts to gain the title, accompanied by a barrage of genealogical charts and printed petitions, came in 1678, 1679, 1680, 1685, and, finally, 1689. In the last case the Lords acted decisively, declaring Percy's claim to be 'groundless, false, and scandalous' (Brenan, 2.366). They ordered a public humiliation of the old man, who would appear in Westminster Hall wearing a paper describing him as the 'False and Impudent Pretender to the Earldom of Northumberland' (ibid.), a sentence which seems never to have been carried out. In the end the weight of the interests ranged against him as well as his own stubborn refusal to admit defeat destroyed James Percy. His fortune lost, he seems to have died shortly after his final humiliation by the Lords.

Percy, John (1817-1889), metallurgist, was born at Nottingham on 23 March 1817, the third son of Henry Percy, a solicitor. He went to a private school at Southampton, and then returned to Nottingham, where he attended chemical lectures by a Mr Grisenthwaite at the local school of medicine. He wished to become a chemist, but yielded to his father's desire that he should graduate in medicine, and in April 1834 was taken by his brother Edmund to Paris to begin his medical studies. While in Paris he attended the lectures of Gay-Lussac and Thenard on chemistry, and of A. de Jussieu on botany. In 1836 he went on a tour in Switzerland and the south of France, and compiled a large collection of mineralogical and botanical specimens. In the same year he went to Edinburgh, where he became a pupil of Sir Charles Bell and a friend of Edward Forbes. In 1838 he graduated MD in the university, and obtained a gold medal for a thesis on the presence of alcohol in the brain after poisoning by that substance. 
In June 1839 Percy married Grace Mary (died 1880), daughter of J. E. Piercy, of Warley Hall, Birmingham. In the same year he was elected physician to the Queen's Hospital, Birmingham, but, having private means, did not practise. The metallurgical works in the neighbourhood excited his interest in metallurgy. In 1846 he worked with David Forbes and William Hallowes Miller on crystallized slags. In 1847 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and served on the council from 1857 to 1859. In 1848 he contributed a paper to the 'Chemist' on a mode of extracting silver from its ores (depending on the solubility of the chloride in sodium thiosulphate), which led to the Von Patera process, used at Joachimsthal, and the Russell process, employed in the western states of America. In 1851 he was elected fellow of the Geological Society, and was appointed lecturer on metallurgy and metallurgist to the museum at the newly founded Metropolitan School of Science in London, under Sir Henry Thomas De la Beche; the post was later made a professorship. 
The influence exerted by Percy, while holding this position, on English metallurgy was of the utmost importance. As he said in his inaugural address, metallurgy was then looked on as an empirical art, and 'experience without scientific knowledge [was thought] more trustworthy than the like experience with it' ('Nature', 206). He was an excellent lecturer and teacher, and most English metallurgists of his time were his pupils. Although the silver process was the only metallurgical one he actually invented, his work suggested many others; the important Thomas-Gilchrist process for making Bessemer steel from iron ores containing phosphorus was an outcome of his work and was discovered by his pupils. In 1851 he undertook to superintend the analysis of a large number of specimens of iron and steel collected by his friend, S. H. Blackwell, that were exhibited at the 1851 exhibition and later displayed at the geological museum in Jermyn Street. His results constituted the first serious attempt at a survey of iron ore deposits in Britain. They were included in the volume 'Iron and Steel' (1864), part of his great 'Treatise on Metallurgy', of which the first volume was published in 1861. This treatise (1861-80), which remained uncompleted, contains over 3500 pages of terse and exact description of metallurgical processes, of minute and scientific discussion of the chemical problems they involve, often based on the author's careful original research, and of suggestions for future investigation. The drawings of plants are remarkably exact. The book, which was translated into French and German, and became a classic, involved an immense amount of labour. 
Percy was appointed lecturer on metallurgy to the artillery officers at Woolwich about 1864, and he retained this post until his death. He was appointed superintendent of ventilation of the houses of parliament on 6 February 1865. He was also a member of the secretary for war's commissions on the application of iron for defensive purposes (1861) and on Gibraltar shields (1867), and of the royal commissions on coal (1871) and the spontaneous combustion of coal in ships (1875). In 1876 he was awarded the Bessemer medal of the Iron and Steel Institute, of which he was an honorary member, serving as president during 1885 and 1886. In December 1879 the government decided to complete the removal of the Royal School of Mines from the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street to South Kensington. Objecting strongly to this course, Percy twice offered to rebuild the metallurgical laboratory in Jermyn Street, but his offer was refused and he resigned in December 1879. He circulated a pamphlet containing his views on the subject. He received the freedom of the Turners' Company in 1883. He was an honorary member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and in 1887 he was awarded a Miller prize. He received the Albert gold medal of the Society of Arts on his deathbed in 1889. He died at his home, 1 Gloucester Crescent, Hyde Park, London, on 19 June 1889. 
Percy was very tall and spare, and had a strong physique and a commanding presence. He frequented the Athenaeum and Garrick clubs, and was of a genial, though at times brusque, temper. He took an interest in social and political questions, on which he wrote many trenchant letters to 'The Times' under the signature 'Y', and he could not refrain from denouncing the home rule movement in his presidential address to the Iron and Steel Institute in 1886. A fair artist himself, he made a valuable collection of watercolour drawings and engravings which were sold in 1890. The manuscript catalogue of the watercolour drawings was bought by the British Museum. Percy's collection of metallurgical specimens was deposited in the museum at South Kensington. The Royal Society's catalogue of scientific papers lists twenty-one papers published by Percy singly, one in conjunction with W. H. Miller, and one with R. Smith.

Percy, Josceline (1784-1856), naval officer, was the fourth son of Algernon Percy, second Baron Lovaine of Alnwick (1750-1830), and afterwards (1790) first earl of Beverley, and grandson of Hugh Percy, first duke of Northumberland. He was born in London on 29 January 1784. His mother was Isabella Susannah (1750-1812), second daughter of Peter Burrell of Beckenham, Kent, and sister of Peter, first Baron Gwydyr. Henry Percy (1785-1825) and Hugh Percy (1784-1856) were his younger and twin brothers respectively. Percy entered the navy in February 1797, on the 'Sanspareil', flagship of Lord Hugh Seymour. In 1801 he was moved into the 'Amphion', in which he went to the Mediterranean in 1803, when he followed Nelson and Hardy to the 'Victory'; in August he was appointed acting lieutenant of the 'Medusa' with Captain (afterwards Sir John) Gore. In her he assisted in the capture of the Spanish treasure ships on 5 October 1804. His commission was confirmed to 30 April 1804. 
In 1806 Percy was in the 'Diadem' with Sir Home Riggs Popham at the capture of Cape Town. He was promoted on 13 January to command the brig 'Espoir', and was posted the same day to the Dutch ship 'Bato', reported to be in Simon's Bay. The 'Bato', however, was found to have been effectually destroyed, and as the 'Espoir' had meantime sailed for England, Percy had to return to the 'Diadem' as a volunteer. On 4 March the French 46-gun frigate 'Volontaire' came into Table Bay, ignorant of the capture of the Cape. She was seized, commissioned by Percy as a British warship, and sent to St Helena, whence she took charge of the convoy to England. Percy's two promotions were confirmed, dating respectively from 22 January and 25 September 1806. 
From 1806 to 1820 Percy was tory MP for his father's pocket borough, Beer Alston, Devon. In 1807 in command of the 'Comus' (22 guns), he assisted, under Sir Samuel Hood, in the occupation of Madeira; and in 1808, then captain of the 'Nymphe' (36 guns), he carried the French commander, Junot, from Portugal to La Rochelle, according to the convention of Cintra, which stipulated that the beaten French forces be returned to France with all arms and equipment. In November 1810 he was appointed to the 36-gun frigate 'Hotspur', which he commanded on the coast of France, and afterwards at Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, for five years, returning to England at the end of 1815. Percy married, on 9 December 1820, Sophia Elizabeth (died 13 Dec 1875), daughter of Moreton Walhouse of Hatherton, Staffordshire; they had one son and three daughters. On 26 September 1831 he was made a CB, and was promoted rear-admiral on 23 November 1841. He commanded at the Cape of Good Hope from November 1841 until spring 1846. He became vice-admiral on 29 April 1851; and from June 1851 to June 1854 was commander-in-chief at Sheerness. He died at his country seat near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, on 19 October 1856.

Percy, Peter (fl. 1486), alchemist, is known only from one tract preserved in two later transcripts in the Ashmole collection at the Bodleian Library. The earliest of these, in Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1423, was made in 1595 by Thomas Mountford, a London doctor, alchemist, and antiquary. The second, in MS Ashmole 1406, was made in 1600, probably by another physician, Simon Forman (died 1611), who had read and written his name into Mountford's copy in 1598. Percy's tract, which bears the date 1486, is a record of alchemical practice, incorporating sixty-two recipes, three in English and the rest in Latin, all making frequent use of the symbolic alphabet of the Hermetic vocabulary. It has none of the theoretical and literary content found in the works of better known fifteenth-century alchemists. The heading of the transcription made in 1600 states that Percy was a 'canon' of the college at Maidstone in Kent. Secular colleges often served as local centres of medical practice and were therefore likely to cultivate alchemy as a related discipline. It is unlikely that Peter Percy was a close relative of the Percy earls of Northumberland. There had been Percys settled in Kent from at least the thirteenth century and in 1456 Robert Percy, a tailor from Erith, led an insurrection against the crown.

Percy, Sir Ralph (1425-1464), soldier, was the son (probably the seventh) of Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland (1394-1455), and Eleanor (died after 1465), widow of Richard Despenser, styled Lord Despenser, and daughter of Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland, and Joan Beaufort. He was born on 11 August 1425 at Leconfield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He spent his life in support of his family and of the house of Lancaster. He was active on commissions in Northumberland, being on the commissions of the peace there in 1447, 1455, and 1460, and on various other commissions in the 1440s and 1450s, including the commission of array in December 1459. He was knighted between July 1448 and April 1449, and was steward of his father's court in Northumberland in 1450. He took a leading part with his brothers in the rivalry between the Nevilles and Percys and was commanded with his eldest brother, Lord Poynings, to appear before the king's council in May 1454 to answer for his part in disturbances in Yorkshire (although this letter was never sent: ('Proceedings... of the Privy Council', 6.179)). With his brother Richard he pledged himself in the sum of 2000 marks for offences against the duke of York and his associates in March 1458. Before this he fought at the first battle of St Albans in May 1455. He also fought at the battle of Wakefield and was afterwards named as one of those responsible for the death of the duke of York. 
Sir Ralph married, before about 1452, Eleanor (died after 1498), daughter of Lawrence Acton, of Acton, Northumberland, and his wife, Matilda. They had three sons, Sir Henry (died 1486), Sir Ralph (died after 1489), and George (died 1500), and probably one daughter, Margaret. 
In 1457 Percy was appointed constable of the castle of Dunstanburgh, although he had apparently been living there as deputy constable, possibly from 1451, and the last few years of his life were spent in and around the castles on the north-east coast. He does not appear to have fought at the battle of Towton, since he was not attainted afterwards. He surrendered Dunstanburgh at Michaelmas 1461 and was allowed to hold it for Edward IV. In October 1462, however, when Margaret of Anjou landed with a small army on the north-east coast, Sir Ralph Percy surrendered Dunstanburgh to her and with others was placed by her in command of Bamburgh Castle. By December, Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh were under siege by the earl of Warwick and on 27 December, Percy reversed his loyalties again and surrendered on condition that if he swore allegiance to Edward IV, he would be given back command of Bamburgh, as was done. To show his trust, on 17 March, Edward further granted Percy authority to receive unattainted repentant rebels into the king's grace, at Percy's discretion. At about the same time Percy reversed his allegiance for the last time and allowed the Scottish and French supporters of Margaret of Anjou to occupy the two castles of Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh. 
By December 1463 Percy had been joined in Bamburgh by the duke of Somerset and Henry VI. In the early months of 1464 Percy and Somerset were raiding in Northumberland and further afield and, having learnt that Lord Montagu, with a small force, was travelling to the Scottish border to escort Scottish ambassadors, attempted to intercept him. Montagu was warned in time to avoid ambush but was attacked at Hedgeley Moor by Percy and his forces on or about 25 April 1464. Percy's force was routed and he himself killed. Traditionally, as he lay dying he cried out that he had 'saved the bird in his bosom' (Hall, 260), said to mean that he had kept his oath to Henry VI -- a rather strange meaning if true, given his disloyalty to both sides. A column called Percy's Cross still stands on the traditional spot where Sir Ralph fell. He was attainted in parliament in 1465.

Percy, Richard de (b. before 1181, d. 1244), baron, was the second son of Agnes (died 'c'.1202), heir of the original Percy family, and Joscelin de Louvain (d. 1180), a younger son of Godefroi, duke of Lower Lorraine, and brother of Queen Adeliza, wife of Henry I. Besides his elder brother Richard de Percy had two brothers and four sisters. He first appears in the pipe rolls in 1181. Some time in or before 1198 Percy's elder brother, Henry, died, leaving a son, William de Percy (1191x3-1245), to whom Joscelin de Louvain's lands passed, but when Agnes de Percy died 'c'.1202, Richard, probably taking advantage of the fact that King John had inherited the kingdom in preference to the son of a dead older brother, was able to claim her lands. He also obtained a small part of the lands of his aunt Matilda, the other heir to the Percy lands, when she died 'c'.1204, although in an apparent compromise between the claims of uncle and nephew the bulk of Matilda's lands went to William de Percy, who in 1214, shortly after he came of age, claimed Richard's lands. This sparked an ongoing legal battle, punctuated by short-lived settlements, that lasted until 1234, when a more permanent settlement was made. 
Richard de Percy served frequently on royal expeditions early in John's reign but he was one of the northern barons who began the struggle which ended in the signing of 'Magna Carta' by refusing to accompany the king to France in 1214. On 7 May 1215 he and some others made an attempt to treat with the king; one of the twenty-five executors of 'Magna Carta', he was excommunicated by Innocent III by name on 26 December ['see also 'Enforcers of Magna Carta]. In 1216 he and other northern barons reduced Yorkshire to the obedience of the dauphin, Louis of France. On 11 May 1217 Henry III granted Percy's lands to his nephew William, but they were restored by the king on Percy's submission on 2 November. 
Percy helped to besiege Ralph de Gaugi in Newark Castle in 1218, and was one of three barons charged with the destruction of Skipton Castle in 1221; he served on campaign with the king in 1224 and 1230. In 1236 he appears among the witnesses of the confirmation of the charters. Percy generally maintained a low political profile in Henry III's reign, but in 1237, when in the parliament the barons prepared to deliberate apart on the king's demands, Gilbert Basset suggested to the king that he should send some of his friends to attend the conference. The words caught the ear of Richard de Percy, and he indignantly cried, 'What did you say, friend Gilbert? Are we foreigners then, and not friends of the king?' (Paris, 3.381-2). 
Percy married first Alice, of unknown parentage; on her death he married Agnes de Neville. He had a son, Henry, who must have been illegitimate since Percy's heir was his nephew William. Percy died in 1244, before 18 August. During his lifetime, he made gifts to the priory of St Lo in Rouen, Sallay Abbey, and Fountains Abbey, to which he gave Litton and Littondale in return for $100 a year for life; if arrangements specified in a grant to Fountains were carried out, he was buried in that house.

Percy, Sidney Richard (1821-1886), landscape painter, was born in Lambeth, London, the fifth son of the landscape painter Edward Williams (1781-1855) and his wife, Ann Hildebrandt ('bap'. 1780, died 1851); their six sons all became successful landscape painters, three of them working under other names to avoid confusion. Henry John Boddington (1811-1865) adopted his wife's surname but Arthur Gilbert (1819-1895) and Percy used their last forename. 
S. R. Percy, as he was known, trained with his father but soon evolved an individual style which was to establish him as one of the most popular landscape artists of the Victorian era. He was best-known for highly finished paintings of dramatic mountain scenes in Wales, Scotland, and the Lake District, executed with a fluent use of colour and a marked sense of design. A view of Llyn-y-Ddinas in north Wales, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1853, was described in the 'Art Journal' of that year as 'A work of very high character, everywhere powerful, leaving nothing to be desired'. His pictures in this manner, with gleaming lakes and watering cattle, achieved such a fashionable vogue that there is an inevitable similarity in many of these scenes. He exhibited over 300 works in London exhibitions, including the Society of British Artists, and also in the provinces and at the Paris Salon. 
In 1846 Percy left central London to join his father at 32 Castelnau Villas (now 92 Castelnau) in the suburban district of Barnes. On 30 June 1857 he married Emily Charlotte Fairlam (1835/6-1904), daughter of a local jeweller, who had stipulated that she would not consider any suitor with less than $2000 a year, a condition which Percy was more than able to meet. After some years at Florence Villa, Inner Park Road, Wimbledon Park, Surrey, the couple moved in 1863 to Hill House, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, where they were neighbours of the watercolourist William Callow, who later remembered Percy as a clever landscape painter, with a gentle and retiring nature. Percy's only visit to the continent was with Callow in 1865. 
The characteristic foreground figures which appear in many of Percy's paintings were directly based on his own photographs of Gypsy girls from the encampments on Barnes and Wimbledon commons; a series of these photographs is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. His obituarist in 'The Athenaeum' later described him as 'The well known and popular landscape painter, founder of the so-called School of Barnes'. There is no evidence for such a movement, which is now thought to have been a light-hearted term, which was subsequently given too much credence. 
Percy returned to the London area in 1873, living at Bickley Lodge, Meadvale, Redhill, Surrey. His final home was at Woodseat, Mulgrave Road, Sutton, Surrey (dem. 1969), where he died, aged sixty-four, on 13 April 1886, following the amputation of a leg. He was buried at Beckenham, Kent. Percy and his wife had four children, but two died young. His surviving son, Herbert Sidney Percy (1863- 'c'.1940), painted landscapes and portraits in a capable technique but with only minor success. His younger daughter wrote novels under the name of Mrs Fred Reynolds. Her elder son, Richard Frederic Reynolds, killed in action in 1918, was a pupil of Stanhope Forbes. The extravagances of his much younger wife had caused Percy to live up to his income and he was therefore only able to leave $712; a studio sale was held at Christies on 27 November 1886. 
Many national and some international collections have landscapes by Percy. 'In Snowdonia' (1853) is held in the Tate collection. 'The Fern Gatherers' (1857), in the Castle Museum, Nottingham, includes the foreground figures typical of his work, as do examples in the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull. Among his works in the Museum and Art Gallery, Salford, is 'Autumn in the Highlands'; and there are also examples in the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath; the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff; Temple Newsam House, Leeds; the Leicestershire Museum and Art Gallery; the Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield; the Sunderland Museum and Art Gallery; the City Art Gallery, York; and the Musee des Beaux-Arts, Montreal, Canada. 'Llyn Dulyn, North Wales', purchased by Prince Albert in 1854 as a present for Queen Victoria, is in the Royal Collection at Osborne House, Isle of Wight.

Thomas Percy (c.1332-1369), bishop of Norwich, was the fifth son of Henry Percy, second Lord Percy. A series of preferments followed rapidly on studies at Oxford, beginning with the canonry and prebend of Chester-le-Street in the diocese of Durham in June 1351. In his nineteenth year he received a papal dispensation to hold a benefice with cure, notwithstanding the canonry and prebend he already held, this being at the request of the queen, the queen mother, and the earls of Lancaster and Arundel, as well as of his father. On 4 February 1355 he was made bishop of Norwich by papal provision. He owed this remarkable appointment to his brother's brother-in-law, Henry, duke of Lancaster, who was present at the papal court in Avignon as the leading English envoy in negotiations there with an embassy from France. Duke Henry seized the opportunity created by the death of his fellow envoy William Bateman, bishop of Norwich, to petition the pope for his relative's promotion, though he was still in his twenty-third year. Thomas Percy received the temporalities on 14 April 1355 and was consecrated bishop on 3 January 1356. He died on 8 August 1369 (the date suggests that he fell victim to plague in that year).

Percy, Thomas, earl of Worcester (c.1343-1403), soldier and diplomat, was the younger son of Henry Percy, third Lord Percy (c.1321-1368), and Mary (died 1362), daughter of Henry of Lancaster, a grandson of Henry III recognized as earl of Lancaster in 1327. Mary's niece, Blanche, married John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and he, Richard II, and Henry IV acknowledged the Percys as kinsmen. Thomas's brother, Henry Percy (1341-1408), was created earl of Northumberland on 16 July 1377. Thomas Percy never married. His father granted him three manors in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Leicestershire for life or term of years in 1364 and 1368, but he spent almost all his life serving as a soldier, commander, diplomat, household officer, and councillor. 
Percy probably began his career as a soldier in Aquitaine in the early 1360s and was certainly in Gascony in 1367. He may have served with Edward, the Black Prince, and Gaunt in Spain and at the battle of Najera in 1367. From 1369 he is frequently mentioned in Froissart's chronicles, and record sources often confirm the facts. Early in 1369 Percy was with the Black Prince in Bordeaux, and in the summer, now seneschal of La Rochelle, he served under Sir John Chandos in Sir Robert Knolles's campaign in the Dordogne and Quercy. He was with Chandos at the siege of the castle of La Roche-sur-Yon in Poitou, which was granted to Gaunt and leased by him to Percy and two others. He was serving under Chandos when the latter was killed at Mortemer on 31 December 1369 and succeeded him as seneschal of Poitou and governor of the Ile d'Oleron. In 1370 and 1371 he served on a number of campaigns including the siege and sack of Limoges in September 1370 under the Black Prince -- who granted him an annuity of $100 and considerable forfeited land in Aquitaine -- and then under the prince's lieutenant, Gaunt. The English suffered a series of defeats in 1372 and in the late summer Percy was captured in a night engagement at Soubise by 'Houwel Flinc', a Welshman serving under Owen of Wales with the Castilian fleet which had defeated the earl of Pembroke's fleet at La Rochelle on 23-24 June. Percy was taken to Paris and on 10 January 1373 Houwel surrendered him to the king of France who permitted him to return to England until Easter to raise a ransom. He was still a prisoner in December, and was given his final release by Jean, duke of Berri, only on 2 October 1374. 
Percy's reputation as a knight was now high and, probably recommended by the Black Prince and Gaunt, he became a king's knight and by April 1376 a Garter knight. In December 1375 he brought a report to Edward III from Gaunt and others negotiating with the French at Bruges and in January 1377 was sent to Flanders to bring a report from Jean, duke of Brittany, who had asked for a council knight and specified Thomas Percy. On 5 November 1376 Edward III granted him an annuity of 100 marks at the exchequer and permitted his brother to grant him another of 100 marks from the 500 marks he received from the customs of Berwick. Richard II confirmed these grants on 1 February 1378, describing Percy as retained for life. Royal pardons were now granted at his request and he served in many ways. For example, he attended his brother at Richard II's coronation; in October 1378 he and another royal knight brought John Wyclif before the Commons in parliament to attack the right of sanctuary; in June 1381 he was one of the group that accompanied Richard to meet the rebel peasants at Mile End, and he took part in the suppression of the revolt in Essex and St Albans. 
Percy rarely served in north-east England and the border, the area of most Percy lands and interests. He was one of the joint keepers of the eastern marches for a few months in 1377 and from 1383 to 1384; a commissioner to negotiate with the Scots in 1378, 1384, and 1398; and keeper of the isolated castle of Roxburgh from 24 June 1377 to 1380 or 1381. He served in Richard II's army in Scotland in 1385 with sixty men-at-arms and sixty archers. He must have seen little of Roxburgh for he served at sea, with large forces of soldiers and sailors, as commander under the earl of Buckingham in 1377-8 and under Gaunt in 1378; as admiral of the north in 1379; and with Sir Baldwin Raddington in 1385. He and Sir Hugh Calveley were joint captains of Brest, leased from the duke of Brittany, from 20 May 1379 until 24 June 1381, when Percy became sole captain until 18 February 1386. 
Percy was out of England during the political upheavals of 1386-8, for on 15 February 1386 he contracted to serve with 80 men-at-arms and 160 archers on Gaunt's expedition to Spain, and about this time he became Gaunt's feed retainer. He was admiral of Gaunt's fleet which sailed from Plymouth on 7 July and fought in the campaign in Galicia and beyond. But his more important role was as a diplomat. He accompanied Gaunt's daughter Philippa to Portugal for her marriage to King Joao and was commissioned on 10 June 1387, with Sir John Trailly, to negotiate a settlement of Gaunt's claims with Castilian envoys at Trancoso in Portugal. By July a draft treaty had been agreed and at the turn of the year Percy returned to England to report it to King Richard. He was back in Bayonne in June 1388 and the treaty -- 'whose sponsor and promoter was lord Thomas Percy' (Thompson, 369) -- was ratified there on 8 July with Percy, styled Gaunt's chamberlain, the first witness. 
Percy remained Gaunt's retainer and served with him on commissions; in February 1398 he was the first-named lay executor of Gaunt's will. But early in 1390 he began to receive commissions, grants, and appointments from Richard II, and became an important courtier. He was under-chamberlain of Richard's household from 22 February 1390 to 22 February 1393 and steward of his household from 24 March 1393 to late August 1399. He accompanied Richard to Ireland in 1395 and 1399. While under-chamberlain Percy often attended the king's council and as steward regularly witnessed royal charters. He served on missions to France (1391-3) and was justiciar of south Wales (1390-99). In the September parliament of 1397, where Richard took revenge on four lords for their part in restricting his authority in 1386-8, Percy was proctor for the clergy to approve the verdicts and sentences. He then shared in the rewards. On 29 September he was created earl of Worcester and received forfeited property valued at $400 a year. Further grants followed, and in October his brother granted him the castle, town, and forest of Jedburgh and now the full annuity of 500 marks that he himself received from Berwick. For the first time he was well endowed. 
Percy accompanied Richard to Ireland in June 1399, and, when Gaunt's son, Henry Bolingbroke, returned from exile and raised an army, returned in late July with the king to south-west Wales. Near Carmarthen, Richard, now aware of the collapse of support for him in England, abandoned his army and rode to Conwy with a few friends. Percy was not one of them, not surprisingly because his brother was Henry's principal supporter. Walsingham reports that Richard released Percy and his household and that Percy broke his steward's rod. In contrast to French writers English sources do not charge him with disloyalty. He joined Henry Bolingbroke at Chester but did not take a prominent part in the deposition of Richard or the accession of Henry IV. Very soon, however, he was active in Henry IV's service. By 12 October as 'our very dear and faithful cousin' he had been appointed to head the delicate negotiations with French envoys about the maintenance of the truce and the restoration of Richard II's queen, Isabella (TNA: PRO, E 404/15/33). These negotiations continued until 1401 and it was Percy himself who delivered Isabella to the count of St Pol on 31 July near Calais. Percy was an active member of the king's council from November 1399 -- a French envoy describes his leading role there in the absence of the king in October 1400. He was again steward of the household from 1 March 1401 until early March 1402; admiral of the north and west from November 1399 until April 1401; and one of those who conducted Joan of Navarre, duchess of Brittany (died 1437), to England in January 1403 to marry Henry IV. In 1399 Percy had been obliged to surrender the forfeited property he had been granted in 1397, but he was compensated by an annuity of 500 marks and his other royal grants were confirmed. 
Percy had received life grants of the lordships and castles of Emelyn in 1390 and Haverfordwest in 1393, and an annuity of 100 marks in south Wales from 1396; although he was no longer justiciar, he retained these grants in 1399 and it was in Wales that he ended his career of service. On 21 October 1401 he was appointed king's lieutenant in south Wales, with particular responsibility for the castles of Cardigan and Aberystwyth, and in November he became governor of Henry, prince of Wales. He could now normally attend the council only in the early months of the year; much of the rest he spent in Wales. He and his nephew, Henry Percy (Hotspur), who had served in north Wales, were frustrated by royal policy in Wales and the failure to pay them on time. His last campaign was in June and July 1403 under Prince Henry in north Wales, for which he provided the largest retinue. In early July, Hotspur came to Chester to mount a rebellion and Thomas Percy joined him with many of his retinue. They were surprised when they reached Shrewsbury on 20 July to find that the king had already joined Prince Henry there. The following morning the king offered negotiations in which Percy played a central role, and Walsingham accuses him of obstructing and misrepresenting them. If true, this was probably because Percy felt that it was too late to draw back. Whatever the case, a fierce battle followed in which Hotspur was killed and Thomas Percy was captured. He was summarily tried and beheaded two days later (23 July) and his head was displayed on London Bridge until December. His body was interred in the abbey church of St Peter in Shrewsbury. The January parliament of 1404 declared his actions to be treasonable but the parliament of 1484 reversed his attainder and forfeiture. Froissart describes Thomas Percy as a gentle, loyal, and valiant knight, and throughout his life others wrote about him in similar terms.

Percy, Thomas, seventh earl of Northumberland (1528-1572), magnate and rebel, was born on 10 June 1528, the elder son of Sir Thomas Percy ('b'. after 1502, died 1537), rebel, and his wife, Eleanor 
(or Alianore; 'b'. in or before 1513, died 1567)
, daughter of Guiscard Harbottal of Beamish, co. Durham. His younger brothers were Henry Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland (c.1532-1585), magnate, and Guiscard Percy, who died in infancy. He had three sisters, Joan (died 1572), Mary (died 1598), and Katherine. Sir Thomas and his brother Ingram Percy were disaffected when they were disinherited by their childless elder brother Henry Algernon Percy, sixth earl of Northumberland (c.1502-1537), magnate, who began alienating land to the crown and others some years before his death. Sir Thomas Percy headed 10,000 Richmondshire and North Riding men during the Pilgrimage of Grace from October 1536. Early the following year his name was invoked to try to start new revolts in the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire. As a result, he was executed at Tyburn on 2 June 1537. Ingram Percy apparently died naturally about the same time, probably in prison. 
The pilgrimage's suppressor, Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, sent Thomas and Sir Thomas Percy's other sons to stay with a member of Henry VIII's council of the north. Initially, they stayed with their kinsman Sir Thomas Tempest (c.1500-1545) ['see under 'Tempest family (per. c.1500-1657)], at Holmside, co. Durham, and then at Tong Hall, Yorkshire. They are also said to have spent time at Liverpool, probably after their mother's second marriage in 1541 to Sir Richard Holland (died 1548) of Denton, Lancashire. Thomas Percy was restored in blood by the 1549 parliament. John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, who was acquiring Percy estates in the north from the early 1550s, made a token gesture by giving the two brothers $66 13's'. 4died per annum from former family property, and later granted Thomas Percy lands worth some $100 per annum around Langley, Northumberland. 
The execution of the duke in 1553 freed the Northumberland title and lands, potentially to return to the Percys. However, Mary I showed little haste to do so until unrest in the north made it advisable. In November 1554 Thomas Percy served as knight of the shire for Westmorland. By 1555 he had secured his father's office of constable of Prudhoe Castle, Northumberland. In another centre of family influence, the North Riding, he distinguished himself in the recapture of Scarborough Castle from Thomas Stafford in April 1557. This led immediately to his knighthood and elevation as Baron Percy on 30 April and as earl of Northumberland the next day. He was then appointed high marshal of the army in the north (30 May) and member of the council of the north. 
Although the Percy landed base had created 'enormous problems of government in the north-east', it was not in the crown's power to reverse fully the sixth earl of Northumberland's dissipation of it (Hoyle, 36). The Cliffords and Thomas Wharton, first Baron Wharton, for example, naturally hung on to the north-western lands he had given them. The seventh earl of Northumberland was restored to a landed revenue of $3077 per annum -- only about three-quarters of his grandfather's patrimony, without considering inflation -- and that derived from depreciated capital resources. The Percys' Northumberland seat of Alnwick -- and presumably also more distant estates -- had been substantially stripped since 1537. The stewardship of the royal honour of Richmond was, however, a valuable resource to the new earl. 
The restoration was made in reward for Thomas Percy's action at Scarborough, but also in hope of useful activity on the Scottish border. Old Percy connections had been disinclined to assist Wharton, who was regarded as a newcomer who had unduly profited from the family's fall and was rewarded with appointment as warden of the middle and east marches as a result. Northumberland took these offices over on August 1557. The privy council expressed to Francis Talbot, fourth earl of Shrewsbury, the hope that thus 'the untowardnes of the Northumberlande men... will be partely reformed' (G. W. Bernard, 'The Power of the Early Tudor Nobility', 1985, 117). Northumberland and his brother Sir Henry Percy defended the border in 1557-8 with some success, assisted by the growing dissension between the Scots and the French. Shrewsbury complained, however, of Northumberland's alarmist reports and premature demands for expensive support. 
Northumberland married on 12 June 1558 Anne (1536-1591) ['see 'Percy, Anne, countess of Northumberland], third daughter of Henry Somerset, second earl of Worcester, and his second wife, Elizabeth. Their only son, Thomas Percy, died in 1560. Their daughters were Elizabeth ('b'. 1559, died in or after 1604), Mary ('bap'. 1560, died before 1564/5?), Lucy ('b'. before 1564/5, died 'c'.1601), Jane ('b'. after 1564/5?, died after 1591), and Mary Percy, who became abbess of the Convent of the Assumption of Our Blessed Lady, Brussels. 
Northumberland was told he could not be spared from the north to attend Elizabeth I's first parliament, and his proxy, Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel, proved inactive as a champion of Roman Catholicism. He was confirmed as warden of the east march on 18 January 1559. Officially in charge of Anglo-Scottish peace negotiations at Norham in February 1559, Northumberland delegated largely to his protestant brother Percy, who was quietly conferring with Scottish protestants on behalf of Sir William Cecil. Sir Ralph Sadler, on an inspection tour of the border in the autumn, recommended replacing both Percys, though Northumberland, as a 'rank papist' was the worse. An overheated dispute erupted when Northumberland tried to insist that his brother-in-law Slingsby, as keeper of Tynedale, be accommodated in Hexham Abbey by Lady Carnaby (probably the widow of Sir Reynold Carnaby, a counsellor of the sixth earl of Northumberland allegedly behind his disinheritance of his brothers). Northumberland would not 'beare the contempte and despite offred unto me'; but he, according to Sadler, wrote 'lettres... the lyke wherof I have not sene wrytten in such a case by any subject' ('State Papers and Letters', 1.426, 443). The outcome was the resignation first of Slingsby and, by the end of the year, of Northumberland. He managed to keep his successor, his wife's uncle, William Grey, thirteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, new warden of the east march, from using Alnwick Castle as his base. The earl's plea that it was unfurnished is confirmed elsewhere, but Grey of Wilton continued to complain of Northumberland's underhand influence and punished some of his men, such as George Clarkson, his deputy steward. 
Despite Sadler's opinion of his religion, Northumberland's local influence had been recognized by making him a member of Elizabeth's ecclesiastical visitation for the northern province. Presumably he did nothing to enhance its efficiency in imposing a protestant settlement, but he had not as yet become an ostentatious recusant. Once free to go to parliament, he did take the opportunity to oppose new measures and attended some 60 per cent of sessions in 1563 and 75 per cent in 1566, acting as the queen's sword-bearer for the 1563 closure and the 1566 opening. However, he was habitually passed over for committees, except ones of inescapable local relevance or needing a muster of major peers (such as the 1566 succession delegations). In 1563 he was said to have warned against punitive enforcement of the oath of supremacy -- 'when they had beheaded the clergy they would claim to do the same to the lay nobles' -- and in 1566 he was one of eleven opposing confirmation of episcopal consecrations ('CSP Spain', '1558-67', 293). 
Elizabeth's government made some minimal gestures of inclusion towards such a major peer, notably nomination to the Order of the Garter on 22 April and installation on 23 May 1563, but Northumberland's disconnection from the court was clear. The 1562 project for Mary, queen of Scots to meet Elizabeth was bound to involve Northumberland as an escort to Newcastle. He obtained assurances that he would not be expected to receive her at Alnwick, stressing his 'unabilitie... much the worse for the service I was lately in, in the northe partes, which as yet is far unrecovered' (Sharp, 337). He was removed from the quorum of the peace in Northumberland and the commissions of the peace in Yorkshire in 1564 in a purge of known Catholics. 
Northumberland had some contact in Yorkshire with Margaret Stewart, countess of Lennox, and was regarded as a key player in her rather overblown reputation for political intrigue. Allegedly he was required at court at Christmas 1561 to keep him away from her: there was a project to marry one of his sisters to the Yorkist claimant Arthur Pole. At the height of English opposition to the marriage in 1565 of Margaret's son Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, to Mary, queen of Scots, the latter's half-brother, James Stewart, earl of Moray, convinced Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in Edinburgh that Northumberland was part of a Lennox plot and should again be kept in London. 
Northumberland's power in the north may have been regarded as a potential threat by the privy council, but he perhaps failed to cultivate and entrench his local power sufficiently during the 1560s. At best, he based himself at Topcliffe in the North Riding or Leconfield in the East Riding and neglected to exercise effective lordship in Northumberland. He never proceeded with his aim of 'continually lying' at Alnwick Castle (Batho, 'Percies and Alnwick', 50). Clarkson complained that the baronial court had also largely collapsed, leaving 'the lorde himselfe in his owne countrie not regarded' and 'tenants... not so much in feare of his lordshipe... as of other gentlemen ther neighbours' (James, 'Society', 296-7). If they wanted a Percy, Sir Henry Percy was close by to divert loyalties from the earl, much as their father and Ingram Percy had from the sixth earl of Northumberland, while Sir John Forster, leading the other gentlemen who had done well out of the Percy forfeiture, had established himself at Alnwick Abbey and had largely taken over even in the Percy heartland. 
The government later presented Northumberland as a spendthrift, this being an aspect of his moral degeneration -- at all events, financial problems were never far away. He was baulked by the crown in his most innovative attempted solution. Admittedly the initiative in starting to mine copper as well as coal on his estate at Newlands, Cumberland, came from crown patentees, but he thought he saw an opportunity to claim at least a share. By 1568 Northumberland's hopes 'to make more yearlye of the mynes of Newland then of all his inherytance' were dashed (TNA: PRO, SP 12/42/39). The exchequer ruled that traces of precious metal in copper made the latter crown property -- a new precedent and, to landowners, a sinister one. By October 1568 Northumberland was sufficiently disgruntled to seek a licence to travel abroad, as he told Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, still insisting that 'most of the best learned' favoured his case ('Pepys MSS', 135). 
When Francis Yaxley was shipwrecked off Northumberland in 1565 with money from Pius IV for Mary, queen of Scots, Northumberland annexed the salvage. Reportedly, though the queen got a share, the earl still acquired over $2000. Supposedly 'the seventh earl had no particular reason to make a grievance of his treatment by the law', but the defeat over mining copper probably rankled (James, 'Society', 302). The incident also showed that Northumberland was more interested in profit than in conciliating the pope or the queen of Scotland. The idea that he gave asylum to the latter's opponents, such as James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, and that they subsequently betrayed him to Elizabeth is, however, over-artistic -- their reception was a matter for the royal officers on the border. 
Hereditary instinct made it difficult to favour Mary while queen of Scotland, but as a Catholic heir within England it was rather different. She landed in May 1568 at Workington, within Northumberland's liberty of Cockermouth. He obtained an order from the council of the north to take charge of her, which they later claimed presupposed he would be first on the scene. However, Sir Richard Lowther had already taken Mary to Carlisle and was unmoved by the earl, telling him he was 'too meane a man to have such charge' and a 'varlett' (Sharp, 340). Northumberland pleaded that 'my credyt be not so much impared in the face of my contrey, as she shuld be taken from me', but unsuccessfully (ibid., 318). Sir Francis Knollys went north on behalf of the privy council to tell him 'he had overshott himself verie muche to the discontentation of her highnes' (ibid., 341). This was the start of Northumberland's interest in alliance with Mary, contradicting his imputed closeness to the Lennox Stewarts, who believed the Scottish queen had murdered Darnley. 
Northumberland flirted with various abortive projects to free Mary, one of which was based on his wife visiting and changing clothes with her. Having been called to Whitehall Palace at the end of 1568 for the hearings on charges against Mary (as spectator rather than commissioner), he took the opportunity to confer with the ambassadors of Philip II and Mary, Guerau de Spes and John Leslie, bishop-elect of Ross, on occasion 'disguised, at four o'clock in the morning' ('CSP Spain', '1568-79', 96). Surreptitious proceedings did not, however, lead to any effective conclusions. By the time the court conspiracy based around Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, had reached a crisis, Northumberland was in the north, communication delays leaving him behind events. Norfolk's submission left Northumberland dangerously implicated but 'out of all hope, of eyther ayd or mayntenance' (Sharp, 203). 
Northumberland also moved towards a religious justification for resistance to Elizabeth. By 1572 at least he was well acquainted with two of Nicholas Sander's works of Catholic controversy, 'The Supper of Our Lord' (1566) and 'The Rock of the Church' (1567). He implied that such reading had cured him of any inclination to religious compromise and that he had been reconciled to the Catholic church about late 1567 or early 1568 by 'one Master Copley', and then started to discuss the legitimacy of rebellion, the general feeling being that it was justifiable only if the prince 'were lawfully excommunicated by the hed of the church' (Sharp, 204). On 8 November 1569 Northumberland and Charles Neville, sixth earl of Westmorland, on the point of rebellion, wrote to Pius V asking him to excommunicate Elizabeth, which elicited the bull 'Regnans in excelsis' (May 1570). 
Northumberland's own account of how he came to rebel in November 1569 certainly contains self-serving elements, but it is broadly confirmed elsewhere. The prime movers were members of the gentry such as the Norton family -- many related to Westmorland to some degree -- while the two earls could not even agree on aims between themselves. Westmorland, Norfolk's brother-in-law, supported the project for the duke's marriage to Mary but demurred at a religious justification for revolt. Northumberland had little interest in supporting Norfolk's marriage, preferring that Mary marry a Catholic -- though when he suggested 'the king, his master' to the Spanish ambassador, the latter merely 'wagged his hed' (Sharp, 190). It was only Westmorland whom Norfolk thought he could dissuade from revolt when he feared 'losing of his hed': Northumberland was to 'do what him list' (ibid., 196). 
Relations with Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, the lord president of the north, remained cordial enough for the earls to hunt with him during the autumn and to confer gravely about the deplorable nature of all the rumours that they were about to revolt. Sussex's attitude changed in early November, when he advised Elizabeth that formally summoning Northumberland and Westmorland to appear at court would precipitate a crisis. She did so nevertheless, so uncharacteristic a piece of brinkmanship that she cannot have believed him. That the consequent revolt was as unco-ordinated and containable as it proved was not predictable. It was the outcome of desperation. Westmorland claimed on 6 November that he dare not appear for fear of enemies, while Northumberland still temporized at Topcliffe, convenient for York if he had been interested in a mooted project to capture Sussex and the council of the north. On 9 November he withdrew suddenly to Westmorland's castle of Brancepeth, co. Durham, after an alarm that Sir Oswald Wilstrop had come to arrest him, an alarm allegedly contrived by co-conspirators to frighten him into action. He and his wife claimed that the queen had ordered Sussex 'to take him and sende him upp moffeled' to court (Sharp, 22). Elizabeth subsequently affirmed, but regretted, that Sussex had not attempted this (Haynes, 553). Northumberland's own account naturally stressed his reluctance, that he 'could not get away', and even that 'some of the others meant me a displeasure' if he attempted it (Sharp, 199-200). Thomas Bishop added that Northumberland was threatened with dags. 
The escalation and changing dynamic of the rebellion certainly neither betrayed Northumberland's influence nor was calculated to exploit it. Different accounts agree that he had only eight men with him at Brancepeth. His inclination, 'being forced to depart my house uppon the soddaine of a false larum [alarm]... to have repayred to Anwick', and later to go 'into Northumberland and provide my force there' and join Westmorland 'about the Water of Tyne' were natural Percy instincts, but his fellows allegedly did not trust him to return (Sharp, 198-9). He could achieve little in co. Durham, though he was doubtless the prime mover in recruiting the 1241 rebels recorded in Richmondshire, where his opposition as steward of the liberty (from 26 July 1557) to new enclosures for which Elizabeth had reproved him might have stood him in good stead. 
Whether thousands would still follow a Percy in Northumberland could not be fully tested because he did little to raise the county. Only eighty to a hundred horse were said to have joined the earl. Efficient recruiting at Westmorland's relatively small Northumberland estates made the Percy effort seem especially deficient. Even his brother-in-law Slingsby, beneficiary of Northumberland's efforts in 1560, preferred to secure his position with an access of loyalism. In Yorkshire, only a minority of Percy tenants turned out, and disproportionately from Topcliffe -- hardly any came even from his other principal estate of Leconfield because he did not make a personal appearance. Cash was also wanted, and with only $130, plus $60 from pawning his Garter collar, Northumberland could not provide it. There was also a half-hearted attempt by Northumberland's men to hold Alnwick and Wark castles. Sir John Forster made the most of his own achievement in obtaining their surrender; with these added to the royal strongholds of Berwick and Newcastle, the rebels lost any chance of junction with Mary's partisans in the Scottish east march. Northumberland's rebellion indeed was a testimony to the decay of the Percy position and a desperate counter-measure against it. 
If his recruiting successes were mixed, Northumberland was prominent in the restoration of mass at Durham and Ripon. It was alleged that he needed periodic encouragement by his wife lest he submit. Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon, wrote that 'the gray mare ys the better horse' (Sharp, 77); Elizabeth supposedly opined that the countess deserved to be burned for treason. None of the rebels, however, adopted a successful strategy. It took a week to move from Durham to the area of York: bypassing the city to the west suggested an incipient strike south to free Mary, but the opportunity for that had long gone. After increasingly aimless movements, the rebels went into Northumberland in the second week of December. This was retreat, not belated Percy enlistment, and on the 16th the earls left their followers to their own devices and fled from Hexham towards the border. 
Leonard Dacre, in a (bootless) attempt to dissociate himself from his former collaborators, turned them away from Naworth in Cumberland. They had to cross the border on 20 December and throw themselves on the mercy of the notorious Armstrongs of Liddesdale. Successive losses of horses and valuables caused Northumberland to leave his wife -- pregnant, and probably tired -- with 'Jock [Armstrong] of the Side' and continue himself to the house of Hector Armstrong of Harlaw in Liddesdale, who was supposed to owe him a favour but helped Martin Elliot capture him on behalf of Moray on Christmas eve. Thomas Kerr of Ferniehurst, however, rescued the countess, who was later accommodated by Alexander Hume, fifth Baron Hume. 
Moray's first instinct was to offer his prisoner to Elizabeth in exchange for Mary; later he mentioned delivering him in conjunction with a request for subsidy, mooting the question of sale even if not as baldly as his successors did. The exchange option was also downgraded from Mary to John Leslie, the troublesome bishop-elect of Ross. Moray's committal of Northumberland to William Douglas at Lochleven Castle, when he found the suggestion of extradition unpopular in Scotland, was meant to buy time. 
Obtaining Northumberland became a significant plank of Elizabethan policy towards a divided Scotland. Negotiations to restore Mary also presupposed delivering him. However, his wife believed she had as much chance as Elizabeth of buying him from Lochleven with funds from Philip and Pius. By the beginning of 1572 the countess had 7000 escudos ($2000) in hand. Unfortunately all funds had come through Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, duke of Alba, governor of the Netherlands, whom she blamed for wasting the previous year -- 'the duke never gave me a flatt denyall, but with fayre words delayed me from tyme to tyme, and all upon a feare lest the money shuld be cast away' (Murdin, 188). It is true that he did not want to spend the pope's money on Northumberland. Greater speed might not have helped: the countess's offer of $2000 only brought an invitation to Elizabeth to match it. On 6 June 1572 Northumberland was sold to England, Scottish face scarcely saved by the pretence that the money was reimbursement for the expense of his imprisonment, which he promptly dismissed with complaints of the cheap food provided. 
Morton, Douglas's cousin, attracted popular odium for Northumberland's surrender, although in fact he seemed to oppose it. It occurred on the authority of the current regent John Erskine, seventeenth or first earl of Mar, who extracted vague and noncommittal statements that Northumberland would be treated clemently. It was alleged that while still at Berwick, Northumberland was hopeful of obtaining leniency. Hunsdon followed the queen's instructions to encourage Northumberland to co-operate but to avoid making definite commitments in her name. Though finding little dignity in the proceedings, it was primarily for jurisdictional reasons that he insisted Forster take Northumberland to York. Prior attainder for treason made a trial redundant. 
The day after Northumberland's old enemy brought him to York, 22 August 1572, the earl was beheaded in the Pavement. His body was buried the same day in the nearby St Crux Church and his head displayed on Micklegate Bar after a period in the Tolbooth on Ousebridge, during which William Tesimond cut off some hairs of the beard as a relic. Sir Thomas Gargrave reported Northumberland's last profession of Catholic faith and refusal to ask the queen's forgiveness: he made a remark variously reported as 'symple Tome must dye to sett up crewell Henry [Percy]' or 'crewell heresy' (Sharp, 335). Northumberland's attainder specifically reserved the rights of his brother Sir Henry Percy to allow him to inherit the title. 
Allegedly manipulated in his lifetime by the countess, who had the distinction of being attainted as a separate individual, Northumberland's posthumous reputation was enhanced by her long survival as a senior Catholic exile. From 1571 she was based at Mechelen. By about 1575 she was at Brussels, nearer the Spanish viceregal government, when English pressure induced it to expel her, but only to the adjacent episcopal territory of Liege. By 1577 she was back in (technically) Spanish territory at Luxembourg, encouraging Don John of Austria to intervene and marry Mary. Cecil (now Baron Burghley) and Robert Persons were in unusual agreement in saying that the frustrations of the dowager countess's position led to madness. She died of smallpox at a Namur convent on 8 or 9 September 1591. She had substantial financial support from Philip (though her monthly pension was said to have shrunk from perhaps $50 to $25) and from other Catholic sources, so she had not only maintained a fair household but left enough for her daughter Jane Percy to be advised to hurry from England to collect it (TNA: PRO, SP 12/240/19). 
Northumberland's daughters had been left at Topcliffe during the rising -- their uncle Sir Henry Percy found them there 'in harde case' in January 1570 (Fonblanque, 2.73). It would seem likely that, after the younger Mary Percy was born at Aberdeen on 11 June 1570, her mother took her overseas. Mary Percy later went to England and was maintained in family property in Blackfriars but returned to the Low Countries after her mother's death, was professed at Brussels in 1600, and became abbess in 1616. Elizabeth and Lucy Percy married into families that showed some evidence of recusancy -- their respective spouses were Richard Woodruffe of Woolley, Yorkshire, and Sir Edward Stanley of Eynsham, Oxfordshire. Jane Percy, less predictably, married Lord Henry Seymour, younger son of Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, and vice-admiral covering the Flemish coast during the Armada campaign. 
The dowager countess's friend Nicholas Sander wrote an account of Northumberland's death, published in John Bridgewater's 'Concertatio ecclesiae Catholicae' (1589). 'The good earle' was named specifically as a martyr in Richard Bristow's 'A Brief Treatise' (1574) (fol. 73'r'). William Allen, after initial doubt, affirmed this in 'A True, Sincere, and Modest Defense of English Catholics' (1584), 'for, what former quarrel or cause of his death soever there was... he was offered his life if he would alter his religion' (Allen, 'Defense', ed. R. M. Kingdon, 1965, 107-8). Such an equivocal figure was not included among the fifty-four martyrs beatified by Leo XIII in 1886. Thomas Percy did in fact appear in Circignano's fresco cycle of martyrs but anonymously, as a nobleman being beheaded. Northumberland was among nine more candidates advanced by the English Catholic bishops and beatified in 1895: his veneration by the Benedictine nuns possibly helped. The grounds were not just his Catholic declaration on the scaffold, but the idea that he was offered a reprieve if he apostatized, which lacks convincing proof. In fact Northumberland performed far better as martyr than as politician or rebel.

Percy, Thomas (1560-1605), conspirator, was a younger son of Edward Percy ('c'.1524-1590) of Beverley and Elizabeth Waterton. His grandfather, Josceline Percy (died 1532), was fourth son of Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland. Little is known of Percy's early life, following matriculation from Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1579. He subsequently forged a career in the service of his cousin the ninth earl of Northumberland. As Northumberland came to trust him more and more, Percy was promoted to the post of constable in the earl's northern stronghold, Alnwick Castle. In 1601 he travelled with his master to the Low Countries, receiving a gift of $200 shortly afterwards. The date of Percy's marriage to Martha Wright, sister of two future co-conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot, is now unknown. 
Percy was a pugnacious character. The Jesuit John Gerard noted that 'for the most part of his youth he had been very wild more than ordinary, and much given to fighting' (Morris, 57). In 1596, during a border affray, Percy killed one James Burne, a Scot. By the 1590s both governments were punishing such lawlessness, and Percy was committed to a London gaol. However, Northumberland's brother-in-law the earl of Essex wrote mitigating the offence, and the prisoner was released. Returning the favour, perhaps, Percy participated enthusiastically in a subsequent conspiracy engineered by Essex to entrap the Scottish warden of the middle marches. 
According to Gerard, conversion to Catholicism reclaimed Percy from manifold vice to sober contemplation and religious virtue, and his comments are supported by those of another Jesuit father acquainted with the man, Oswald Tesimond (Edwards, 58). But the priests' claims were true only up to a point. Percy's enduring ruthlessness and lack of scruple, indeed, appear to have been precisely the traits which recommended him to Northumberland. In 1603 he was appointed receiver of the earl's rents in both Cumberland and Northumberland, a hard job, requiring energy and single-mindedness. Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the usual squabbling among estate officers, the earl's confidence in his capable servant remained unshaken (Nicholls, 150-52). 
Northumberland's trust extended to matters of high politics, with the greatest prizes at stake. When, after Essex's downfall, the earl wanted to open a channel of communication with James VI, he turned to Percy, and it was the man whom Northumberland later called his 'ancient Mercury' who undertook three clandestine missions to the Scottish court (TNA: PRO, SP 14/4/85). James gave some unspecific assurances to requests from either the earl or his messenger that English Catholics might receive kinder treatment under a Stuart king -- promises which Percy magnified for his own purposes after 1603. More immediately, these hugger-mugger services cemented the bond of trust between Northumberland and his officer. When the earl was appointed captain of the gentleman pensioners, early in the new reign, he disregarded James's instructions and dispensed with the oath of supremacy when admitting Percy to this royal bodyguard. This may have been mere oversight or the convenient omission of an oath offensive to a Catholic, but, given Percy's subsequent career, dereliction of duty was held to be as bad as wilful disobedience. 
The full story of Gunpowder Plot is told elsewhere ['see 'Fawkes, Guy]. In conversation with friends, among them Robert Catesby, the conspiracy's organizing genius, Percy bemoaned the weaknesses and futility of Catholic resistance to the new regime: 'Shall wee alwais talk, gentelmen, and never doe any thing?' (Hatfield MS 113/54). Catesby quietly reassured him that drastic action was indeed being contemplated. Sworn into the plot in May 1604, Percy subleased a dwelling adjacent to the House of Lords from Henry Ferrers of Baddesley Clinton, who in turn had leased the property from John Whynniard, keeper of the Old Palace of Westminster. From here the plotters began to drive a tunnel under Parliament House. Early in 1605 it was again Percy who took the lease of a ground-floor vault under the Lords' chamber itself, and it was there that Fawkes, posing as Percy's servant, was eventually arrested, as he prepared to fire over 18 hundredweight of gunpowder. After spending the autumn of 1605 collecting Northumberland's rents, Percy was in London by the evening of 2 November. Pursuing his own scheme of kidnapping the king's younger son, despite the doubts of his colleagues, he studied Prince Charles's daily routine at court. He also bolstered the faltering spirits of fellow conspirators before visiting Northumberland for dinner on 4 November, apparently to check that the plot had not yet been discovered. 
Early on 5 November word spread that Fawkes had been captured. In a proclamation for his arrest issued shortly afterwards Percy is described as a tall, florid man, with a broad beard -- 'the head more white then the beard' -- and stooping shoulders, being also 'long footed, small legged' (Larkin and Hughes, 1.123). He joined in the rebellion which followed, and on the morning of 8 November, in a final stand at Holbeach House, Staffordshire, Percy and Catesby, fighting back to back, were shot and mortally wounded with a single bullet. Percy's body was stripped by what the sheriff of Worcestershire termed the 'baser sort' among his posse (Hatfield MS 113/4). His head was sent to London. A sword which he had commissioned but never collected from the Catholic London cutler John Cradock may survive in the Swiss National Museum, Zurich, as accession LM 3675. 
Percy was apparently estranged from Martha Wright, who, along with their daughter, drew an annuity of $50 paid by Lord Monteagle. Another, unnamed, woman is also described as his wife at the time of Gunpowder Plot. In November 1605 Martha resided in the midlands, while the other 'spouse' lived 'very private' as a schoolteacher in Holborn (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/15, 134). A son, Robert, married Emma Mead at Wiveliscombe, Somerset, on 22 October 1615. Of two known daughters, one is rumoured to have married Catesby's son Robert.

Percy, Thomas (1768-1808), Church of England clergyman, the eldest child of Anthony Percy (1731-1795), merchant, and his wife, Mary Mason (died 1795), was born in Southwark on 13 September 1768. He was the nephew of Bishop Thomas Percy (1729-1811), for whom he was named. He began to write poetry in his early years at Merchant Taylors' School, where he was a pupil from 1775 to 1785. Daines Barrington relates that by the age of nine Percy had composed not only a ballad which was set to music by the composer Samuel Wesley, but also the first canto of an epic poem on Caesar's invasion of Britain. In this work, says Barrington: 'there are strong marks of a most early genius for poetry, which he likewise recites admirably well upon the first stool you may place him. I asked this wonderful boy how many books he intended to divide his Epic Poem into; when he answered, that he could not well bring all his matter into less than twenty-four. (Barrington, 308)' Two short poems written by Percy at the age of nine or ten were published in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' in the years 1778-9. Another of pamphlet length, 'Verses on the Death of Dr. Samuel Johnson' (1785), was printed anonymously at the expense of his uncle, Bishop Percy. His precocity showed itself not only in the private work of composition, but also in his leading role in the organization of a literary society, the 'Council of Parnassus', formed with the aim of reciting and criticizing its members' verses in public. This group's main achievement was the publication, supervised by the fifteen-year-old Percy, of a volume titled 'Poems by a Literary Society' in 1784. 
These juvenile exploits seem to have exhausted Percy's poetic energies: apart from some verses in the 'Poetical Register', this completes the list of his literary publications. He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 27 June 1786, graduated BCL at Oxford in 1792, became a fellow of his college in the same year, and proceeded DCL in 1797, having previously in 1793 been presented to the vicarage of Grays Thurrock in Essex. 
In 1795 Percy was the ostensible editor of the fourth edition of his uncle's 'Reliques of Ancient English Poetry'. Though it is the only achievement for which he is remembered, this editorship was no more than a polite fiction arranged by his uncle, whose collection of ballads and other early English verse had become extremely popular since its first publication in 1764. Created bishop of Dromore in 1782, Percy's uncle felt himself unable to acknowledge his continuing interest in the frivolities of poetry, and unwilling to engage in public controversy over the authenticity of his manuscript texts, even if friends urged him to issue a new edition, and even if his detractors, notably Joseph Ritson, ought to be answered. Perhaps the bishop had also hoped that after the death of his son in 1783 he would find in his nephew a congenial spirit to take over the editing under his guidance. He was eventually disappointed, and the editorial work was evidently undertaken by the bishop himself, as was the composition of a prefatory advertisement for putting his name to which Percy received a share in the book's profits. This dissociated the bishop firmly from a work that, it claimed, 'the original editor had no desire to revive [because] more important pursuits had... engaged his attention' (Percy, 1.ix). The fourth edition was the definitive form of this highly influential collection for over fifty years, and hence the vehicle through which the younger Thomas Percy's name became widely known. 
Although his uncle placed opportunities for other editorial projects in Percy's way around this time, nothing came of them, probably because his interest was lukewarm. Nevertheless, he was installed on 3 December 1796 as rector of one of the bishop's churches, at Magheralin in the diocese of Dromore, Down, and simultaneously as precentor of Dromore Cathedral, a sinecure paying $500 per annum. This appointment served to forestall legal action by his former parishioners at Grays Thurrock, who were about to bring a suit against him for his neglect of the church's fabric; but it prevented his free movement back to England, where he was liable to prosecution. 
Little is known of Percy's last decade, which seems not to have been happy. He died, unmarried, at Ecton, near Northampton, on 14 May 1808, of what the obituary written by his uncle describes as 'a fever, which baffled all medical skill' ('GM').

Percy, Thomas (1729-1811), writer and Church of Ireland bishop of Dromore, was born on 13 April 1729 at The Cartway, Bridgnorth, Shropshire, the son of Arthur Lowe Percy (died 1764), wholesale grocer and tobacconist, and his wife, Jane, 'nee' Nott. The surname appears as Pearcy in the baptismal register at St Leonard's Church, Bridgnorth; Percy himself wrote Piercy until 1756, when he definitively opted for Percy. 
Percy was educated at Bridgnorth Free School (1737-41) and Newport School, Shropshire (1741-6). At the age of seventeen he went to Christ Church, Oxford, as a Careswell exhibitioner. His undergraduate studies were mainly classics, with some Hebrew. After taking his BA (1750) he continued with Hebrew as a part-time postgraduate, adding French and Italian. He obtained his MA in 1753. 
Percy was ordained first as deacon (1751) -- in which capacity he preached in several churches in his home area -- and two years later as priest. Shortly after this Christ Church presented him with the living at Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire. He took up residence at Easton in 1756 and in the same year became rector of Wilby, some 6 miles away. He owed the latter appointment to the earl of Sussex, who also appointed Percy as his personal chaplain. 
As a parson Percy was sincere, but perhaps somewhat worldly, with a liking for sightseeing, shooting, horse-racing, card games, plays, operas, coffee houses, and pleasure gardens. Nevertheless he was a keen and wide-ranging reader. In the early 1750s he began to write verse, some of which shows the possible influence of the ballads in a manuscript collection he had discovered. While visiting Humphrey Pitt at Shifnal, 11 miles from Bridgnorth, probably in 1753, Percy noticed a battered volume 'lying dirty on the floor, under a bureau in the parlour... being used by the maids to light the fire' (Hales and Furnivall, 1.lxiv). It proved to be a seventeenth-century collection, which he persuaded Pitt to reprieve from the flames. In due course it provided the basis for Percy's anthology, 'The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry' (1765), and for his enduring fame. 
On 24 April 1758 Percy married Anne Gutteridge (died 1806) of Desborough, Northamptonshire, who brought a dowry of $2000. Between 1760 and 1772 their long-lasting union produced six children, of whom two died in infancy and two more, including their only son, Henry, predeceased them. Before these grievous losses, Percy in his sixteenth-century vicarage, with bees and fruit trees, wife and first child, pronounced himself (in 1760) the 'happiest of men' (Davis, 69). 
Much though he relished the role of rural parson and patriarch, Percy looked to wider horizons. In 1765 he became chaplain and secretary to Lord Northumberland and tutor to his son, Algernon, in which capacities he often visited Northumberland House in London and also Alnwick Castle. His wife was signally honoured to be appointed (at a salary of $200 a year) wet-nurse to Queen Charlotte's baby son, Edward (the future father of Queen Victoria); she spent eighteen months at Kew and Buckingham House (1767-8), after which she received an annual pension of $100 for life. Percy himself became in 1769 one of the king's chaplains-in-ordinary, a post which required him to preach from time to time before George III. He received DD degrees from Cambridge in 1770 and from his own university twenty-three years later. 
Percy took the opportunity of visiting London to mix in literary and artistic circles, where he made many friends, including Edmund Burke, David Garrick, Oliver Goldsmith, Thomas Gray, David Hume, Samuel Johnson (who made a lengthy visit to Easton in 1764), Elizabeth Montagu, and Joshua Reynolds (who painted his portrait). The first such friend, William Shenstone, Percy met at The Leasowes, the latter's home near Halesowen, Shropshire. The ability to make and retain such friendships reflects well on Percy, who kept up a relentless round of meetings, backed by copious correspondence. 
Percy's first published works were two sonnets printed in a periodical called the 'Universal Visiter' (1756). A further poem of his, simply entitled 'Song' and beginning 'O Nancy, wilt thou go with me?' appeared in a collection of poems published by Robert Dodsley in 1758. This was later set to music by Joseph Baildon and famously described by Robert Burns (in 1792) as 'perhaps the most beautiful Ballad in the English language' ('Letters of Robert Burns', ed. J. D. Ferguson, 1931, 2.126). 
With the apparent gift of sensing a need for the new, while at the same time making use of his linguistic skills, Percy then turned away from his own light verses to translating the exotic, the primitive. He catered to the taste for chinoiserie by translating a Portuguese version of a Chinese novel, the argument of a play, some proverbs, and poems, under the title of 'Hau Kiou Choaun, or, The Pleasing History' (4 vols., 1761), and by editing, the following year, two volumes of 'Miscellaneous Pieces Relating to the Chinese'. 
In 1763 Percy turned to the north, with 'Five Pieces of Runic Poetry', which he translated from the Icelandic with the acknowledged help of a clergyman neighbour, the Revd Edward Lye, a distinguished Anglo-Saxon scholar. Other translations were from Hebrew, French, Latin, and Spanish. His new version of the 'Song of Solomon' appeared in 1764. 'Northern Antiquities' (1770) consisted of Percy's translations both of Paul-Henri Mallet's 'Introduction a l'histoire du Dannemarc' and of Goranson's Latin version of the 'Prose Edda'. From the Spanish, Percy's 'Ancient Songs Chiefly on Moorish Subjects' was ready for the press in 1775 but published only in 1932. 
An original work, 'A Key to the New Testament' (1766), quickly went through four editions. It shows, with 'The Song of Solomon', that Percy was not forgetting his clerical role. Nor did he neglect his patrons, the duke and duchess of Northumberland: in 1768 he published his edition of 'The regulations and establishment of the household of Henry Algernon Percy, the fifth earl of Northumberland... begun anno domini MDXII'. It is possible that a similar motivation lay behind his ballad-style poem in 800 lines, 'The Hermit of Warkworth', begun in 1767 and published four years later. Despite such intense productivity, during the same eventful period Percy conceived, and in some cases started work on, a series of projects which either failed to come to fruition or did so at the hands of others: editions of 'The Guardian', 'Spectator', and 'Tatler'; of Buckingham's 'Rehearsal' and Tottel's 'Miscellany'; and of his own favourite book, 'Don Quixote'. 
Another product of the hectic literary activity at Easton Maudit turned out to be Percy's most important and influential work, the three-volume anthology of which the full title is 'Reliques of ancient English poetry: consisting of old heroic ballads, songs, and other pieces of our earlier poets. (Chiefly of the lyric kind). Together with some few of later date' (1765, published by Robert and James Dodsley). If indeed Percy rescued the original folio manuscript in 1753 it was probably consigned to a cupboard in the Pitt household for several years before he was able to beg it. His mind may have been brought back to it when Shenstone, whom he was visiting in the summer of 1757, read him a version of the ballad 'Gil Morrice'. It was only in November of that year that he wrote to Shenstone that he had 'a very curious old MS. Collection of ancient Ballads' which Johnson had seen and urged him to publish ('Percy Letters', 7.1-3). 
Johnson, despite being somewhat contemptuous of ballads and prone to teasing Percy with parodies of them, had offered to help select and annotate the material, though he did not do so. The task fell to Shenstone, who greatly influenced both Percy's selection of ballads and his editorial policy. Until Shenstone's death in 1763 the two men engaged in sustained correspondence on ballad topics with frequent exchanges of ballad texts. In addition Percy travelled at least twice to Halesowen, taking with him the precious folio. At an early stage he decided not to publish the manuscript in its entirety but to supplement it from other sources. In the end only a quarter of the printed work came from the folio, though the original contents influenced Percy's selection of material: historical ballads, Robin Hood ballads, metrical romances, traditional items, and modern ballad imitations. 
To request possible material and to discuss it Percy wrote to academics such as Thomas Warton of Oxford and Richard Farmer of Cambridge, antiquarians such as the Scots lawyers John McGowan and David Dalrymple (later Lord Hailes), and ballad scholars or collectors such as Evan Evans and David Herd. He went carefully through published anthologies of ballads and consulted unpublished collections held by such bodies as the Society of Antiquaries or preserved in libraries. He went to Magdalene College, Cambridge, to see the Pepys collection, and with the help of amanuenses took copies of a large number of black-letter broadsides. He contacted a contemporary printer, Cluer Dicey, who supplied him with over eighty street ballads issued by his father, William (characterized by Percy as 'the greatest printer of Ballads in the Kingdom'; 'Percy Letters', 7.109). 
The ballad trade was, to say the least, not held in high esteem, and Percy 'could never quite satisfy himself that ballad editing was a suitable employment for a conscientious clergyman' (Davis, 104). Yet he persevered, commenting in 1761: 'I am content to perform the office of scavenger for the public, and as Virgil found 'Gold' among the 'Dung' of 'Ennius', from all this learned Lumber I hope to extract something that shall please the most delicate and correct Taste. (S. H. Harlowe, 'Letters from Dr Percy to T. Astle, esq.', 'N&Q', 4 ser., 3, 1869, 25-7)' To this end, Percy excluded bawdy, as well as almost all politics and protest. He saw himself including 'effusions of Nature' (Hales and Furnivall, 1.1), deriving from the unspoilt childhood of literature and the nation, yet he was happy to collate, patch, and rewrite whenever he deemed it necessary. He planned to dedicate the book to the memory of Shenstone but at a late stage offered the dedication to Elizabeth Percy, countess (later duchess) of Northumberland. When she accepted, Johnson, swallowing his dislike of patrons, agreed to Percy's request that he write a (suitably grovelling) dedication. Percy then went through the whole text again to ensure that the countess's sensibilities could not possibly be offended, excising and bowdlerizing as he did so. In addition the planned volume 3 was brought forward to be volume 1 so as to give prominence to ballads on the Northumberland Percys. 
When the book came out, the 'Gentleman's Magazine' reviewer commented that Percy 'has with great judgement selected such specimens [of ballads] as either shew the gradation of our language, exhibit the progress of popular opinion, display the peculiar manners and customs of former ages, or throw light on our early classical poets', and expressed the view that the work 'well deserves the encouragement of the public' ('GM', 1st ser., 35, 1765, 179, 183). The public duly responded. Within five months 1100 sets of the three elegant volumes (out of 1500 printed) had sold, at half a guinea a time. Percy's editorial policy seemed to be vindicated, with some of the most doctored ballads securing the highest approval. 
One critic, at least, remained unconvinced, the eccentric and choleric Joseph Ritson, who suggested that the 'learned collector has preferred his ingenuity to his fidelity' and alleged that the folio manuscript did not exist at all (J. Ritson, ed., 'Ancient Songs and Ballads', 1792, xix-xxi). He kept up the criticism for many years, accusing Percy of printing scarcely 'a single poem... fairly or honestly' and of practising 'every kind of forgery and imposture' (Ritson, 'Romancees', 1802, cix, cxliii n.). A cartoon of 1803 by James Sayer shows Ritson trampling underfoot 'Dr Percy's ancient ballads', while penning from an inkpot marked 'Gall' a statement including 'Dr Percy a Liar Warton an infamous Liar a pipeer better than a parson' (BM satire 10171). 
Ritson's criticisms, seen to be broadly justified in 1867-8 when the folio manuscript was published, have been largely endorsed by later scholars. But Percy did at least take ballads seriously, annotating them with great care. He treated them as literary phenomena, largely ignoring their music and their links with oral tradition, but a scholar in the late twentieth century made this assessment: 'Percy's work was brilliant and blundering, inspiring both the interest and standards which were later to condemn it. It was, however, a noble experiment and one as remarkable for its failures as for its triumphs' (Knapman, 213). 
Most of Percy's contemporaries welcomed the 'Reliques' as a powerful blast of fresh air. 'Poetry has been absolutely redeemed by it', wrote Wordsworth ('Essay supplementary to the preface', 'Lyrical Ballads', 1815, 3, 75). Several generations of poets felt its influence: Blake, Coleridge, Keats, Rossetti, Morris, Swinburne, and many lesser lights. Scott, both as novelist and ballad-editor, owed a debt to the book, as did figures such as Burger, Herder, and the Grimm brothers in Germany, and by extension European Romanticism in general. 
After the early 1770s Percy wrote little, perhaps burnt out after a prolonged period of frenetic activity. There were verses on the death of Johnson (1785) and a memoir of Goldsmith (1801), together with editions of the works of Buckingham (2 vols., 1806?) and of Surrey and Wyatt (with George Steevens, 2 vols., 1807). A second edition of the 'Reliques' appeared in 1767 and a third in 1775. When a fourth was called for Percy published it (1794) under the ostensible editorship of his nephew and namesake since he felt that the book was not consistent with his position as bishop. 
Percy was appointed dean of Carlisle in 1778, thanks to the patronage of Northumberland. He did not sever his links with Northamptonshire until 1782, when he became bishop of Dromore in northern Ireland. He immersed himself in his pastoral duties in this small town some 60 miles west of Belfast, to the exclusion of much else. After forty-eight years of marriage his wife, Anne, died in December 1806 and was buried in her husband's cathedral. By this time Percy was losing his sight. He died at the bishop's residence, Dromore, more or less blind, on 30 September 1811 at the age of eighty-two, and was buried next to his wife. Several people in northern Ireland were moved to send valedictory poems to the 'Gentleman's Magazine', where an obituarist wrote that Percy: 'constantly resided [at Dromore], promoting the instruction and comfort of the poor with unremitting attention, and superintending the sacred and civil interests of the diocese, with vigilance and assiduity; revered and loved for his piety, liberality, benevolence, and hospitality, by persons of every rank and religious denomination. ('GM', 1st ser., 81, 1811, 483)' Reprints of some of Percy's books continued through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. His 'Key to the New Testament' was republished as late as 1842, 'Northern Antiquities' in 1882, 'The Hermit of Warkworth' in 1883, 'Regulations and Establishment' in 1905, and 'Life of Goldsmith' in 1976. These were far outstripped by the 'Reliques', of which well over a score of reprints or adaptations appeared in the nineteenth century alone. The 'Everyman' edition of 1906 had at least five printings, and as late as 1996 a facsimile of the first edition of the 'Reliques' came out. 
Nine volumes of Percy's correspondence were published between 1944 and 1988. Percy material, published and otherwise, is widely scattered through private collections in Britain and America, New Zealand, and South Africa. The famous folio is in the British Library. Percy's work continues to attract the attention of scholars around the world. Percy not only travelled from grocer's warehouse to bishop's palace but in a parallel literary career produced at least one book, the 'Reliques', long recognized as 'a seminal work of English Romanticism' (Groom, 1.1) and considered a landmark in European literature.

Percy, William de (d. 1096x9), baron and administrator, probably took his name from Percy-en-Auge, Calvados, Normandy. According to the cartulary of Whitby Abbey, he bore the nickname of Asgernuns or Ohtlesgernuns, which may have been in allusion to his moustaches. An untrustworthy late memorandum in the Whitby cartulary claims that William de Percy came to England with Hugh d'Avranches, earl of Chester, and William the Conqueror in 1067. This may have been an invention to support the charter which the Whitby monks had concocted in his name, supposedly giving them the churches of Whitby and Flamborough. It is unlikely that Percy was originally Hugh's man or that he came to England in his company, but in 1086 he was the tenant of Earl Hugh at Whitby and Sneaton, Yorkshire. In Percy's foundation charter for Whitby Abbey, Earl Hugh was described as Percy's lord. 
William de Percy was with the Conqueror on his expedition to Scotland in August 1072, and after his return he superintended the rebuilding of the castle at York under the direction of Hugh fitz Baldric, the sheriff. Soon after 1077 Percy endowed the community of St Peter and St Hilda at Whitby, which had been newly re-established by the hermit Reinfrid, one time monk of Evesham. Shortly afterwards there was a schism within the community, the reasons for which are unknown. Abbot Stephen (died 'c'.1112) and the main body of the convent moved to Lastingham, part of the royal demesne. Prior Reinfrid and the remainder of the Whitby monks later moved to Hackness, with Percy's consent, in order to escape from the assaults of robbers and pirates. It appears that Percy attempted to recover his donations from Abbot Stephen and return them to Reinfrid, whom he had first sponsored at Whitby. The monks went back to Whitby, possibly by 'c'.1090 and certainly before 1096 when Percy issued a charter confirming them in considerable possessions. William Rufus granted and confirmed various privileges and the church of Allsaints, Fishergate, York, to Prior Reinfrid and the monks at Whitby and later liberties, the church of Hackness, and various lands to Percy's brother, Prior Serlo de Percy. 
In 1086 William de Percy was a tenant-in-chief in Yorkshire (where he held the bulk of his lands), in Lindsey, in Nottinghamshire, and in Hampshire. The lands he held as tenant-in-chief in Yorkshire were worth approximately $64 19's'. 'Domesday Book' also records that he was a tenant of the bishop of Durham at Scorbrough, Yorkshire, and in several other locations in the county. Percy's son Alan was to come into conflict with the bishop over holdings at Lund, Holme on the Wold, and Welton in the reign of William Rufus. William de Percy also possessed property in the city of York and the church of St Mary, Castlegate. He was present when William the Conqueror heard a plea relating to the property of the abbey of Fecamp 'c'.1086, and he later witnessed charters of William Rufus in the period 1091-5. He is known to have built castles at Topcliffe, Spofforth, Sneaton, and Hackness, in Yorkshire. 
William de Percy married Emma de Port, a kinswoman of Hugh de Port of Basing, and the marriage brought Hambledon, Hampshire, to the Percy family. Emma herself was a benefactor of Whitby, granting to the abbey lands in Cambridgeshire which had formed part of her dowry; she survived her husband. William de Percy went on the first crusade, in 1096, and died in Palestine, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his son and heir, Alan de Percy (died 1130x36). His other sons were: Walter; William, who may be identical with a certain William de Percy, canon of York; and Richard of Dunsley, who patronized the family foundation at Whitby with his eldest brother. In 1166 William de Percy's grandson and namesake, another William, answered for twenty-eight knights' fees of the old enfeoffment and just over eight fees of the new enfeoffment. Percy's brother Serlo was prior of Whitby Abbey and his nephew William de Percy was later the abbot of the house in the reign of Henry I. Picot de Percy, a Yorkshire tenant of William de Percy in 1086 who witnessed a number of Whitby charters, was probably closely related to William. Another likely kinsman was Ernald de Percy, a tenant of Robert de Brus, who witnessed William's charter for Whitby 'c'.1090-96.

Percy, William de (1191x3-1245), baron, was the eldest son of Henry de Percy (died 'c'.1198) and Isabel de Brus, daughter of Adam de Brus and Juetta d'Arches. He had a younger brother, Henry. From at least 1200 his guardian was William Brewer, a royal favourite. He came of age between 1212 and 1214, whereupon he gained control of the honour of Petworth, which his father, Henry, had inherited from his own father, Joscelin de Louvain, the younger son of Godefroi, duke of Lower Lorraine, and brother of Henry I's second wife, Queen Adeliza. He should also have inherited the Percy estates, which had been divided between his paternal grandmother, Agnes, and her sister Matilda, who died without heirs, but because of a legal technicality he had to share these lands with his uncle Richard de Percy until the latter's death in 1244; this division of lands created a large amount of litigation in the meantime. 
In 1214 William de Percy participated in King John's expedition to Poitou. He was later listed by Matthew Paris as one of the followers of the twenty-five barons of 'Magna Carta', but there is no other evidence that he supported the rebel cause. He was certainly a supporter of the king in the civil war that broke out following the king's repudiation of 'Magna Carta', for in May 1216 King John granted him the lands of his uncle Richard, a prominent rebel and one of the twenty-five barons, and of other rebels, although these grants were revoked when peace was made early in Henry III's reign. Percy served Henry III in the campaign against William, count of Aumale, in 1221 and participated in later campaigns as well, although he paid $100 to avoid the Poitevin campaign of 1242. He was a generous benefactor to the church, for he gave the manor and forest of Gisburn to Sallay Abbey and made gifts to the hospital of Sandon, the nunnery at Stainfield, Coverham Abbey, Shulbrede Priory, and Healaugh Park Priory. 
Percy married first Joan, one of the five daughters of his guardian, William Brewer. They had five daughters of their own who in 1233 (their mother having died) inherited one fifth of the Brewer estates after the death of William Brewer the younger. Percy's second wife, who survived him, was Elena, the daughter of Ingram de Balliol. They had at least six sons, Henry de Percy, William, Walter, Ingram, Alan, and Joscelin; a seventh son, Geoffrey, is mentioned in later genealogies. Percy died not long before 28 July 1245. His body was buried at Sallay Abbey in Yorkshire but his heart was buried with his first wife, Joan, at the hospital of Sandon in Sussex.

Percy, William (1574-1648), poet and playwright, probably born in Tynemouth, was the third son of Henry Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland (c.1532-1585), and Katharine Neville (1545/6-1596). In mid-1583, with two of his brothers, he was sent to Paris where Robert Persons hoped that the children would be 'made firm in the Catholic religion' ('Miscellanea', 99), but the earl insisted they return to England. On 13 June 1589 Percy matriculated from Gloucester Hall, Oxford, where he studied under Dr John Case, 'the great tutor for Roman Catholic scholars' (Wood, MS top. Oxon. C.10.232, interleaf 'v'). Percy studied Italian and Latin but his primary interest was contemporary literature, including the works of Peele, Dekker, Gabriel Harvey, Sidney, and Spenser. 
At Oxford, Percy belonged to a Catholic literary coterie which included Barnaby Barnes, whose 'Parthenophil and Parthenope: Sonnettes, Madrigals, Eligies, and Odes' (1593) was dedicated 'To the right noble and virtuous gentleman' William Percy 'his dearest friend'. Percy published his own collection 'Sonnets to the Fairest Coelia' in 1594. In the preface he promises: 'ere long I will impart unto the world another Poem which shall be both more fruitfull and ponderous'. He includes a sonnet dedicated to Barnes (Parthenophil). Although Percy's sonnets show no real talent, he was favourably reviewed by William Clerke, in 'Polimenteia' (1595), who describes the sweet singers of Oxford as 'Britten, Percie, Willobie, Fraunce, Lodge, Master Davies of L. I., Drayton, Learned M. Prat' (sig. Q3'v'). Percy's circle included Charles Fitzgeoffrey, author of 'Sir Francis Drake' (1596), who, in his 'Caroli Fitzgeoaffridi Affaniae' (1601), praises Percy as a poet. The coterie also included the Mychelbourne brothers, Edward, Lawrence, and Thomas, all of whom feature in Percy's poems. A later member was Thomas Campion, a Cambridge man, who praises Percy in his 'Epigrammatum II' (1619) for his wit. One of Percy's six extant plays, 'The Cuck-Queanes and Cuckolds Errants, or, The Bearing Down the Inn' concerns the adventures of two Oxford undergraduates, has a prologue spoken by Tarlton, and is set in the year of the Armada (1588); it concludes with a panegyric to Sir Francis Drake. 
Percy had moved from Oxford to London by 1595 for on 25 January in that year he, along with the earl of Northumberland, acknowledged a debt to Arthur Medleycote, merchant taylor, for $2400. The debtors were required to repay $1226 by 29 February 1596; by 9 July 1600 Medleycote declared himself satisfied. There is no indication as to how Percy incurred such huge debts. In February 1596 he fought a duel with one Henry Denny, who was wounded 2 inches deep under the chin. Denny seemed to make a full recovery but sickened and died on 19 March. The inquest, however, declared Denny died 'by reason of... sickness and by the visitation of God' (Alnwick Castle, Percy papers, 5, fol. 108'v'). By August 1599 Percy was again in debt in the sum of $50 to one Valentine Browne of Crofte in Lincolnshire. By 5 July 1604, however, this debt was vacated. 
Percy wrote six plays, which he continually revised. He may have produced a version of 'The Faery Pastoral, or, Forest of Elves' for the visit of James I to Syon House on 8 June 1603, but he seems to have most especially aspired to have his plays performed by either or both of the Children of Paul's and the Children of the Revels. All three extant autographs of his plays have modifications to devise suitable variants for performance by children. 'Arabia sitiens, or, A Dreame of a Drye Yeare: a Tragaecomodye' (1601), 'A Country Tragaedye in Vacunium' (1602), and 'The Aphrodysial, or, Sea Feast: a Marinall' (1602) are dedicated 'unto the children of the Revells and of Poules'. At the end of one autograph there is a note: 'to the Master of the Children of Poules. Memorandum, that if any of... these Pastoralls and Comoedyes... shall but over reach in length (the children not to begin before foure, after prayers, and the gates of Pawles shutting at sixe) the tyme of supper, that then in tyme and place convenient, you do let passe some of the songs, and make the consort the shorter, for I suppose these plaies to be somewhat too long for that place. (Reynolds, 259)' A version of these plays could possibly have been played at Paul's in the early phase of their revival (1599-1603). His last play, 'Necromantes, or, The Two Supposed Heds: a Comicall Invention' (1632) is designated 'For Actors onely' (Hillebrand, 401). 
By late 1603 Percy may have been living near Bamber Rape, Sussex, for, at the end of 'The Faery Pastoral' he writes 'Finis 1603 Wolves Hill my Parnassus which is in Sussex' (Hillebrand, 401); by 1611 he was in prison in Oxford for on 12 February 1612 the earl of Northumberland's accounts speak of 'Owing by Mr. Wm. Percy viz. To Mr. Bagwell the keeper of Oxford Castle for the charges of Mr. Percy's diet there $11. 19's'.' (ibid., 399). In 1638 the Reverend Garrard describes Percy living obscurely in Oxford, where he 'drinks nothing but Ale' (G. Radcliffe, 'The Earl of Strafforde's Letters and Dispatches', ed. W. Knowler, 1739, 2.168) and eventually he died 'an aged Bachelor, in Penny Farthing St.... after he had lived a melancholy and retired life many years; and was buried in the Cathedral of Christ Church, near to the grave of Sir Henry Gage, the 28th of May 1648' (Wood, MS top. Oxon. F.4, fol. 83).

William Henry Percy (1788-1855), sixth son of the first earl of Beverley, born on 24 March 1788, entered the navy in May 1801 on the 'Lion' (64 guns), in which he went to China. On his return in November 1802 he joined the 'Medusa', of which his elder brother was shortly afterwards appointed acting lieutenant. He was promoted commander on 2 May 1810, and during 1811 commanded the 'Mermaid', transporting troops to the Iberian peninsula. He was posted on 21 March 1812. In 1814 he commanded the 'Hermes' (20 guns) on the coast of North America; but, on 4 April, having lost fifty men killed and wounded in an unsuccessful attack on Fort Bowyer, Mobile, his ship was set on fire to prevent her falling into enemy hands. After the peace of 1815 he had no further service in the navy, but was for many years a commissioner of excise. From 1818 to 1826 he was tory MP for Stamford, Lincolnshire, returned through the influence of the second marquess of Exeter, stepson of his maternal aunt, the dowager duchess of Hamilton. He became a rear-admiral on the retired list on 1 October 1846, and died, unmarried, at the home of his brother, the second earl of Beverley, 8 Portman Square, London, on 5 October 1855.

Pereira, Jonathan (1804-1853), pharmacologist and physician, was born on 22 May 1804 in Shoreditch, London, the son of Daniel Lopes Pereira, a Lloyd's underwriter of Portuguese-Jewish extraction. He acquired the rudiments of education at one of the small schools in Shoreditch and from the age of ten attended a 'classical academy' in Queen Street, Finsbury, where the master judged him to be a boy of considerable merit. At the age of sixteen Pereira was articled to an apothecary named Latham who had a general medical practice in the City Road but the indentures were cancelled when Latham became mentally ill. In 1821 Pereira became a student at the General Dispensary, Aldersgate Street, and attended courses in chemistry, materia medica, and practical medicine by Henry Clutterbuck, on natural philosophy by George Birkbeck, and on botany by William Lambe. Two months before his nineteenth birthday, on 6 March 1823, he qualified as licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries and was appointed apothecary to the Aldersgate dispensary. He began to study surgery at St Bartholomew's Hospital and qualified as a surgeon in 1825. 
While acting as an apothecary at the dispensary Pereira discovered his vocation as a teacher. He gave private lessons to medical students and prepared texts to assist them in their studies. In 1823 he published 'Synopsis of the Chemical Decomposition that takes place in the Preparations of the London Pharmacopoeia'. In 1824 he published his English translation of the newly revised 'Pharmacopoeia Londinensis' and 'Selectae e praescriptis', a selection of medical prescriptions. There followed 'A Manual for the Use of [Medical] Students' (1826) and 'A General Table of Atomic Numbers with an Introduction to Atomic Theory' (1827). In 1826 he succeeded Clutterbuck as lecturer in chemistry at the Aldersgate dispensary and two years later began to teach the courses in materia medica. About this time he was made a fellow of the Linnean Society and was a member of the Phrenological Society and the Meteorological Society. In the years that followed he achieved considerable success as a teacher and was described as a man of commanding appearance, looking older than his years, who retained the interest of his audience by the novelty of his facts. Attendances at his courses generated a large income, sufficient to enable him to build a new lecture theatre at his own expense. His teaching and duties at the dispensary left him little time for original work and he published only one paper between 1827 and 1835. 
In 1832 Pereira married Louisa Jane Lucas, resigned his office of apothecary at the dispensary and set up in medical practice in Aldersgate Street near his home in Finsbury Square. He was appointed professor of materia medica at the new medical school in Aldersgate Street and lecturer in chemistry at the London Hospital. He declined an invitation to become professor of chemistry and materia medica at St Bartholomew's Hospital because the by-laws required him to relinquish all other posts. His lectures in materia medica, published in the 'Medical Gazette' between 1835 and 1837, were translated into German and republished in India. In 1838 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. 
In 1840 Pereira resolved to leave London and graduate from one of the universities in Scotland but changed his mind when he was told of the prospect of a vacancy in the post of assistant physician to the London Hospital. At short notice he prepared for and passed the licentiate examination of the Royal College of Physicians. He also obtained an MD from Erlangen, and on 3 March 1841 was appointed to the post at the London Hospital. In 1845 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was made a member of the pharmacopoeial committee and curator of the museum. He became full physician at the London Hospital in 1851. 
From 1842 Pereira devoted much of his time and energy to the completion of the third edition of 'The Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics', which was his major work. The first edition based on his published lectures appeared in 1839 and an enlarged second edition followed in 1842. The third revision attempted to resolve problems relating to the identification, action, and use of medicinal substances, and place the knowledge of the action of drugs on an organized and scientific basis. The first volume of this encyclopaedic work was published in 1849 and was devoted to general pharmacology and the inorganic bodies used in therapy. Pereira saw the first part of the second volume through the press in 1850 but the final part was incomplete at the time of his death. It was published in 1853, having been completed by Alfred Swaine Taylor and George Owen Rees. Pereira's treatise, published at a time when pharmacology was evolving into an experimental science, surpassed all other works on materia medica, introducing readers to a detailed scientific and clinical knowledge of each of the medicinal agents then in use. 
At the time that he was revising his book on the materia medica Pereira was closely associated with the newly formed Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. He gave active support to Jacob Bell, whose objective was to raise the status of pharmacy in Britain and promote the advancement of pharmaceutical science. In 1842 Pereira had expressed his opinion that the low state of pharmacy in Britain was due to the want of a scientific education by practising chemists and druggists. His reputation and enthusiasm for the improvement of pharmacy were of great value to the founders of the Pharmaceutical Society in its early years when it was opposed by sections of the medical establishment and from within the trade itself. Pereira became a close friend of Bell and had considerable influence on the editorial policy of the 'Pharmaceutical Journal', contributing numerous articles on the materia medica. He became professor of materia medica at the School of Pharmacy and encouraged Bell to form a committee of leading scientists and pharmacists for the advancement of pharmacology. The object of the committee was to gather and sift information on the natural history and uses of substances employed in medicine. Pereira observed that no country possessed so many facilities for carrying out these enquiries as Great Britain, which governed colonies all over the world. When he resigned as professor of materia medica at the London Hospital in 1851 he presented his collection of specimens to the Pharmaceutical Society. His contributions to their evening meetings became the subjects of two books: 'Lectures on Polarized Light' and 'A Treatise on Food and Diet', both published in 1843. Foodstuffs were discussed in the first editions of the 'Elements of Materia Medica' but the publication of Justus von Liebig's 'Animal Chemistry' in 1842 necessitated a revision, and Pereira, in his treatise, gave an account of the chemical elements of food in addition to the alimentary principles and dietetical treatments of disease. 
Pereira's letters to Jacob Bell reveal him to have been a very hard-working good-humoured man, direct and frank in his manner, tolerant when the occasion demanded. He was charged by some with a want of originality but this had little effect on his widely held reputation which was built upon his qualities as a teacher and his ability to gather, organize, and record the numerous facts and disparate theories relating to the materia medica and the actions of medicines. His thirty-page 'Tabular view of the history and literature of the materia medica' in the third edition of the 'Elements' is an indication of the range of his studies. He made it a rule, whenever possible, to have firsthand experience of the substance or species he was describing in his book. It was for this purpose that he was visiting the Hunterian Museum in December 1852 when he fell on the stairs and ruptured muscles and tendons in both legs. Disabled and in pain he continued to write until 20 January 1853 when he collapsed with severe chest pains and died that same day, at 47 Finsbury Square. He was buried in the cemetery at Kensal Green. He was survived by his wife.

Perigal, Arthur, the elder (1784-1847), painter, was born in London on 10 January 1784, one of the six sons and seven daughters of Francois Perigal (1731-1821) and his wife, Marie Ogier (1744-1824). On 21 January 1808 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, where he studied under Henry Fuseli. After winning a silver medal in 1809, and the gold medal for history painting in 1811 with 'Themistocles Taking Refuge at the Court of King Admetus' (exh. RA, 1812), he embarked on a career as a painter of ambitious subjects from Shakespeare, Scott, Plutarch, English history, and the 'Bible'. He showed nine of these at the Royal Academy and twelve at the British Institution but few found buyers and he turned increasingly to portraiture and landscape painting. On 1 September 1812 he married, in London, Louisa Susanna Pilleau (1780-1861), with whom he had four sons including Arthur Perigal the younger ['see below'] and one daughter. In 1821 he had an address in Sheep Street, Northampton, but in 1823 he lived at 48 George Street, Manchester. There he practised as a portrait painter and art teacher and was active in setting up the Royal Manchester Institution (since 1882, Manchester City Galleries). By 13 December 1828 Perigal had begun work on a large canvas, 'The Manchester Fancy Dress Ball' (City of Salford Museum and Art Gallery), portraying the culminating event of the Manchester music festival of that year. Despite measuring 7 feet by 10 feet this painting is really a 'tour de force' of the miniaturist's art. At a significant point in the growth of 'Cottonopolis', Robert Peel, home secretary, and 400 members of Manchester's merchant elite are portrayed at leisure, all dressed in exotic costumes of the most striking variety. A probable self-portrait is included on the right-hand side. Perigal attended in the costume of 'an old gentleman of George II. d's time' ('Manchester Guardian', 4 Oct 1828). Completed in eighteen months, the picture was praised in the 'Manchester Guardian' (10 July 1830) as 'a faithful representation of the most brilliant scene ever witnessed in Manchester'. Yet it was not a significant popular success, and could not compete with the drama of John Martin's 'Fall of Nineveh' shown in the city some months earlier. It was subsequently raffled and presented to Salford Art Gallery in 1852. Twenty-one related watercolour studies are in Manchester Public Library. Several of the likenesses, executed in tiny hatched strokes, are superior to those in the finished oil painting, but the handling of the drapery is cursory. 
Perigal moved to Edinburgh in 1832 where, assisted by his sons, he set up a 'Drawing Institution', first at 19 Hill Street, then at 21 Hill Street. From 1833 until 1846 he exhibited landscapes, portraits, and miniatures at the Royal Scottish Academy. He also showed some of his early history paintings, which remained unsold after nearly thirty years. On 19 September 1847 he died at his home, 21 Hill Street.

Arthur Perigal the younger (1816-1884), landscape painter, was born in London on 17 August 1816 and baptized at St Mary, St Marylebone Road, on 9 October 1816. He first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1837 and thereafter showed more than 300 landscapes. On 1 September 1847 he married Hannah Stevenson ('b'. 1827), with whom he had nine children. After 1861 he also exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution in London. Working initially with his father, he mainly portrayed scenes in the Scottish highlands and the borders but occasionally also worked in the Lake District and north Wales. After an extended tour of Norway in 1870 and a later visit to Italy he also exhibited views of these countries together with some Swiss scenes. He worked in both oils and watercolours and was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1841 and a full member in 1868. From 1880 to 1884 he served as the academy's treasurer. He died suddenly at his home, 7 Oxford Terrace, Edinburgh, on 5 June 1884 and was buried in the Dean cemetery; his wife survived him. There are examples of his paintings in Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum, Dundee City Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Scotland, and other public collections.

Perkins, Angier March (1799-1881), heating and steam engineer, was born on 21 August 1799, at Old Newburyport, Massachusetts, USA, the second son of the six children of 
In the course of his involvement with coins and banknotes, Jacob Perkins took his family to Philadelphia in 1817, then went to England in 1819 with his elder son, Ebenezer (1797-1842), in pursuit of a contract for engraving banknotes for the Bank of England. They won the contract; Dyer backed Jacob Perkins with $12,500, and machinery and men were brought over for the firm, known initially as Perkins, Fairman, and Heath, to commence printing. Angier Perkins later spoke of his own arrival in England: 'We embarked in the ship 'Electra', 500 tons, about November 1821 and arrived in England in thirty days where we found my father and brother and all our friends. I... went at once into the employment of my father and his partners and was engaged for the next eight years in manufacturing banknotes, dies and plates. During the latter part of the time I taught other parties to do the work I was engaged upon and my services in the firm became unnecessary and I found myself obliged to obtain other business. (Bathe, 91)' The family resided in Fleet Street, in the City of London, above the business premises. 
Jacob Perkins soon left his printing business in the hands of Angier, and then of his son-in-law Joshua Butters Bacon. In 1839 Perkins, Bacon, and Petch (as it was then known) was the firm chosen to print the first engraved adhesive stamps for the new penny post. Meanwhile Jacob Perkins's inventive mind turned to the advantages of high-pressure steam, as applied to locomotives, and to a 'steam-gun' (which the English military establishment spurned though the French were briefly tempted), to refrigeration plant, and to the creation of the Adelaide Gallery of Practical Sciences. This establishment, located at the western end of the Strand, opened in 1832 for the display and demonstration of new inventions and works of art. By the end of the 1840s, having ceased to draw the scientific and mechanically minded, it declined into a mere place of vulgar entertainment. In 1836 Hannah Perkins returned to Newburyport, where she died on 5 October 1837. Jacob Perkins continued to live with his son Angier, being now entirely dependent on him. On 15 July 1849 he took to his bed with what proved to be acute enteritis, and he died on 30 July. He was buried in the family vault at Kensal Green cemetery, which had been constructed for the interment of his daughter Louisa Jane in 1833. 
Angier Perkins established his independent business as a heating and steam engineer in 1828, at Harpur Street, Holborn. In 1831 he married Julia Georgiana Brown and set up house, with his parents and sisters (his brother having returned to America), at 21 Great Coram Street, Bloomsbury. The same year he filed the first of many patents relating to heating apparatus. His first heating system was installed in 1832 at the villa of J. Horsley Palmer (1779-1858), governor of the Bank of England, at Fulham, where it was used for forcing grapes in wintertime. Another plant was erected in the Guardian Fire office in the City of London. At this time he took enlarged premises at Francis Street, off Gray's Inn Road, which he shared with his father, whose inventive mind remained as fertile as ever, despite his lack of business success. 
Shortly after 1843 Perkins moved to 18 Regent Square, a more imposing dwelling, befitting his increasing prosperity. His involvement with steam engineering led him to propose improved methods of manufacturing and smelting iron, and designs for pipe couples and joints. His high-pressure steam heating systems were adapted to industrial use; his mobile baker's oven, exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, was earlier adopted by the British army. 
Perkins's eldest son, Angier Greenleaf (1832-1871), also an engineer, died young; his second son, Loftus Perkins, was apprenticed to his father, probably in 1848. He was taken into partnership in 1866, after which the firm traded as A. M. Perkins & Son. Angier Perkins was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in May 1840, and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts from 1849. He died at his home, 140 Abbey Road, Hampstead, London, on 22 April 1881 and was interred in the family vault at Kensal Green cemetery.
