Warren, John (1796-1852), mathematician, was born on 4 October 1796 at Bangor deanery, the son of John Warren (1766-1838), dean of Bangor, Caernarvonshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Crooke MD, of Preston, Lancashire. Sir Charles Warren (1798-1866), soldier, was his younger brother. Warren was educated at Westminster School and matriculated in 1814 at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1818 and MA in 1821. He held a fellowship at Jesus from 1818 to 1829, was a tutor there, and in 1825 and 1826 served the office of moderator and examiner. Ordained deacon in 1819 and priest in 1820, he was rector of Caldecott, Huntingdonshire, in 1822-52, and of Graveley, Cambridgeshire, in 1828-52. 
In 1828 Warren published a short 'Treatise on the Geometrical Representation of the Square Roots of Negative Quantities', which was well received. The work displayed originality, though Warren was unaware that the topic had been investigated earlier in the century by French mathematicians. He countered objections in two papers delivered the following year at the Royal Society ('PTRS', 119, 1829, 241-54 and 339-59), and concluded that any algebraic quantity may be geometrically represented, both in length and direction, by a line drawn in a given plane from a given point. He was convinced that geometry was superior to algebra when handling expressions involving the square roots of negative quantities, and that it might clarify certain obscure proofs of some of the fundamental rules of algebraic operations. His view was soon advocated, independently, by the great German mathematician C. F. Gauss. Faced with the objection that there is no necessary connection between algebra and geometry, Warren departed from tradition in recognizing that algebra need not have arithmetical numbers as its subject matter. He was elected FRS in 1830. 
Warren was chancellor of the diocese of Bangor and owned the advowson of Caldecott, which as he lived at Gravely had no resident clergyman. He sold the advowson to the patron of the adjacent parish which also had no resident clergyman, and from the proceeds built a parsonage for the united parishes. He married in 1835 his cousin Caroline Elizabeth, daughter of Captain and Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Warren of the 3rd foot guards; there were no children. Warren died at Upper Bangor on 15 August 1852.

Warren, Sir John Borlase, baronet (1753-1822), naval officer, first son of John Borlase Warren (1699-1763) of Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Bridget, daughter of Gervase Rosell or Russell of Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, was born on 2 September 1753 at Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, and baptized there on 5 October. Having been taught by the Revd John Prinsep at Bicester, he entered Winchester College in 1768 and matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1769. 
Entered on the books of the 'Marlborough' guardship as an able seaman in 1771, Warren was discharged in 1772 to the sloop 'Alderney', which was then employed on the east coast. His naval service alternated with residence at Cambridge where he graduated BA in 1773 and proceeded MA in 1776. After discharge from the 'Alderney' in 1774 he was elected on his own interest MP for Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire where his family had long owned property. He was created a baronet on 1 June 1775. Warren, known in his early years as a 'dandy' and 'young buck', was a heavy gambler and amused himself by the purchase of a yacht and Lundy island as a base for sailing in the Bristol Channel. 
During the American War of Independence Warren resumed his naval career and went to America in the frigate 'Venus' as a midshipman. After transferral to the frigate 'Apollo' he was promoted fourth lieutenant of the 'Nonsuch' (64 guns) in July 1778. He returned to England, was appointed first lieutenant of the 'Victory' in March 1779, and in August was commanding the sloop 'Helena'. In September 1781 he was posted to the frigate 'Ariadne', moved to the frigate 'Winchester' in March 1782, and went on half pay at the peace in 1783. On 12 December 1780 he married Caroline (died 1839), daughter of Sir John Clavering; they had three daughters, one of whom, Frances Maria, later married George Charles, fourth Lord Vernon, and two sons, one of whom entered the Coldstream Guards and was killed at Abu Qir in 1801. 
Warren was forced to sell his property at Great Marlow in 1781 following a very expensive re-election contest in 1780, and he did not stand for parliament in 1784. At the beginning of his parliamentary service he voted with Lord North's administration, but his support became uncertain when he did not receive the naval preferment he sought. Although considered a supporter of William Pitt in 1783, he attended the St Alban's tavern meeting of coalitionists in 1784. While out of public life, he maintained his professional interest in naval affairs as vice-president of the Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture. He was also the author in 1791 of 'A View of the Naval Force of Great Britain', which was dedicated to the duke of Clarence in whose household Warren had been a groom of the bedchamber since 1787. In this tract he attacked the excesses of press gangs and advocated the keeping of a register of seamen available for service in wartime which in peace would constitute a reserve force on half pay. 
In the French Revolutionary War Warren was appointed to the frigate 'Flora', flagship of Rear-Admiral John MacBride, in a squadron off Brest and the Channel Islands. Early in 1794 Warren himself commanded a squadron ordered to capture several French frigates off the coast of France that had damaged British trade. On 23 April his squadron captured three of the French frigates, and for this feat Warren was made a knight of the Bath on 30 May. In August his squadron drove on shore south of Brest a French frigate and two corvettes. In addition to these warships Warren's squadron destroyed a large number of vessels engaged in the French coasting trade. In the spring of 1795 he was moved to the 'Pomone' (44 guns), one of the frigates he had captured in April 1794, and was ordered to convoy an expedition of French royalist troops to Quiberon Bay. Although Warren landed the royalists safely and took three of the offshore islands as places of refuge after the royalists were decisively defeated by the republicans, the expedition was abandoned, and Warren returned the survivors to England. Warren's squadron, ordered in 1796 to attack the French coasting trade, destroyed or captured more than 220 vessels, thirty-six of which, including the frigate 'Andromache' (36 guns), were armed. The patriotic fund for this service presented Warren with a sword worth 100 guineas. In 1797 he was appointed to the ship of the line 'Canada' (74 guns) in the Channel Fleet. When a French squadron under Commodore Bompart with 5000 troops bound for Killala Bay in north-west Ireland escaped from Brest in September 1798, Warren was sent in pursuit with three ships of the line, five frigates, and several smaller vessels. Warren's squadron encountered the French squadron off Lough Swilly and engaged in a hard-fought action on 12 October; the flagship 'Hoche' (74 guns) and three of the frigates were captured, five others being subsequently taken. Warren's conduct of this operation, for which he obtained a gold medal, was highly praised, and he received the thanks of both the English and Irish parliaments. After receiving promotion to rear-admiral on 14 February 1799 he hoisted his flag on the 'Temeraire' (98 guns) in the Channel Fleet off Brest from where he was sent on detached service in the Bay of Biscay and off Ferrol. In 1800, while serving under Lord St Vincent off Brest and then under Lord Keith off Cadiz, he received more than $12,000 in prize money. When Keith in 1801 was co-operating with the army in Egypt, Warren was in charge of operations in the western Mediterranean. 
Although Warren was actively engaged in naval service, he had been returned in 1797 as MP for Nottingham, a borough that had often been represented by a member of his family. Frequently absent from the Commons because of his duties at sea, he applied for leave in 1800 to look after affairs in his constituency. Lord St Vincent, his commander-in-chief, uncharitably held that Warren was unable to endure long periods at sea, which, 'looking back to the course of his services and manner of life when ashore, is easily accounted for'. St Vincent nevertheless testified that Warren was a 'good fellow in the presence of an enemy, but runs a little wild when detached' (Corbett and Richmond, 4.14). When re-elected to parliament in 1802, Warren declared when his return was challenged that 'having already supported the public cause to the utmost of my power', he would not spend another $1000 to represent 'that terrible place [Nottingham]' (HoP, 'Commons, 1790-1820', 5.492-3). Following the peace of Amiens in March 1802 Warren was appointed ambassador to Russia after the tsar had requested that a naval officer be named. He was sworn of the privy council on 8 September 1802, and his credentials as ambassador, dated 5 September, were presented in St Petersburg on 10 October. When war with France was renewed in 1803, Warren, hard pressed for money, sought to resume his naval career, but he remained in Russia until 1804. Recognizing the value of an Anglo-Russian alliance for protecting British interests in the Mediterranean, he promoted that goal, though he was careful to let the Russians know that Britain would never sacrifice Malta. Disappointed in his request for an increase in salary as well as in his quest for a peerage, he willingly left St Petersburg in November 1804 when recalled by Pitt. Although there was doubt about whether Warren was loyal to Pitt or Lord Addington, Lord Barham, first lord of the Admiralty, in 1805 offered him a seat on the Admiralty board; but the offer was withdrawn when Warren indicated that he did not want 'a place of confinement'. He did, however, support the Pitt government in the Commons where he presented the petition of the naval orphans' asylum for a parliamentary grant and spoke for the prize agency bill. 
Warren was promoted vice-admiral on 5 November, and returned to naval duty in December 1805 when he was named commander-in-chief of one of the two squadrons sent to hunt down the squadrons of Leissegues and Willaumez that had escaped from Brest. He hoisted his flag on the 'Foudroyant' (80 guns), and sailed from Spithead with six other ships of the line in January 1806. Sailing southwards towards Madeira, he missed the French squadrons from Brest, but south-west of Madeira captured the 'Marengo' (80 guns), flagship of Rear-Admiral Linois, and the 'Belle Poule' (40 guns), returning to France from the East Indies. On his return to Spithead, Warren was ordered in June to scour the western Atlantic for Willaumez's squadron, Leissegue's squadron having been destroyed by Sir John Duckworth off Santo Domingo in February. Warren touched at Barbados in July and reached the Chesapeake in September without encountering Willaumez's squadron, and returned to England in November. But before his return Lord St Vincent of the Channel Fleet once again castigated Warren's conduct, calling him 'a mere partisan, preferring prize money to the public good at all times' ('Selections from the Correspondence of... Markham', 60). Thomas Grenville, first lord of the Admiralty, complained that Warren had 'played the devil' by leaving some of Willaumez's squadron unwatched in the Chesapeake. Holding that the admiral's conduct was 'indefensible' and that he was 'good for nothing but fine weather and easy sailing', Grenville declared that he was not entitled to any 'mark of approbation' (Grenville, 4.91-4, 103-4). But despite Grenville's poor opinion of him, Warren, who had not stood at Nottingham for re-election to parliament in 1806, was elected to fill a vacancy in March 1807 for Buckingham, which was controlled by Grenville's brother, the marquess of Buckingham. Warren's parliamentary career finally ended with the general election of May 1807 when the marquess chose his nephew to stand instead of Warren. 
In October 1807 Warren succeeded Vice-Admiral George C. Berkeley as commander-in-chief of the North American squadron based at Halifax. He sailed in December 1807 from Cawsand Bay in the flagship 'Swiftsure' (74 guns), and reached Bermuda in January 1808 where he took command of the squadron from Berkeley in February. His chief task was to curb the aggressiveness unleashed by his predecessor that had led to a crisis with the United States when HMS 'Leopard' attacked the USS 'Chesapeake' off the Virginia Capes on 22 June 1807. Under Warren the squadron was largely concerned with routine matters, such as the protection of British trade and watching for stray French cruisers, three of which were captured in 1809. He was concerned with the establishment of more clearly defined limits for the North American station, the building of a permanent dockyard at Bermuda, and the protection of British and Spanish interests in East Florida from American filibusterers. As his three-year tour of duty neared an end in 1810 he requested to be relieved for reasons of health. Acceding to his request, the Admiralty promoted him in July 1810 to the rank of full admiral. 
Warren relinquished the North American command in January 1811, returned to England, and was unemployed until the outbreak of the Anglo-American War in 1812. Sent out to America again in August 1812, he was made commander-in-chief of the consolidated North American, Jamaica, and Leeward Islands squadrons. Although Warren had had a good fighting record when younger, he was now less aggressive, and was sent to the American theatre because of his tact and diplomatic experience, which, it was thought, might be useful in negotiating terms of peace. Warren was soon criticized for his slowness in establishing a blockade of the American coast and not giving attention to the Great Lakes. He was not, however, lacking in strategic ideas, for he soon recognized that an offensive against New Orleans and the Gulf coast would relieve American pressure on Canada, and in 1813 he promoted a naval offensive in the Chesapeake region. He also advocated the breakup of the consolidated command, which he regarded as too unwieldy, and this was done in 1813 when he was ordered to return home and relinquish the command to Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochran on the ground that the diminished command did not require the services of a full admiral. 
With his recall, Warren's naval career came to an end, but he received ample recognition of his services. His final promotion to admiral of the white came in June 1814, and in the same month he was made a DCL of the University of Oxford. He became a knight grand cross of the Bath in 1815 and a knight grand cross of Hanover in 1819. Although he received the diplomatic pension he had long sought he never obtained the peerage that he wanted. He died suddenly on 27 February 1822 while visiting Greenwich Hospital, and was buried in the family vault at Stratton Audley in Oxfordshire on 5 March. A tablet to his memory is in Attenborough church in Nottinghamshire. He was survived by his wife, who died on 28 December 1839. 
Fired with a zeal for naval service while still a schoolboy, Warren for nearly three decades was an active and faithful serving officer, though not of the first rank. Although noted as an aggressive and intrepid fighter he appears to have been lacking in practical seamanship; and although strongly motivated by true patriotism he was always eager for prize money to support his extravagant lifestyle. Yet even the demanding St Vincent recognized his abilities and courage as a fighter, and Barham once considered him for a seat on the Admiralty board. Until near the end of his career Warren had little opportunity to demonstrate any ability as an administrator or strategist. But as commander-in-chief of the North American station during the difficult period from 1807 to 1810, he was a capable and tactful administrator and an effective defender of British interests. As a wartime commander-in-chief in America from 1812 to 1814 his strategic insights were sound. Of the British admirals of his period, Warren, with his aristocratic and university background, was one of the most conspicuous, as a man of fashion and elegant manners.

Warren, John Byrne Leicester, third Baron de Tabley (1835-1895), poet, was born on 26 April 1835 at Tabley House, Knutsford, Cheshire, the eldest son of George Warren, second Baron de Tabley (1811-1887), and Catherina Barbara, daughter of Jerome, Count de Salis-Soglio, by his third wife, Henrietta, daughter of William Foster, bishop of Kilmore. The grandson of John Fleming Leicester, first Baron de Tabley (1762-1827), Warren travelled widely with his mother in Italy and Germany during his childhood. 
On his return to England, Warren received his education at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford (matriculating on 20 October 1852, and graduating BA in 1859 and MA the next year). While at Oxford he became good friends with a fellow collegian, George Fortescue, whose death by an accident in 1859 had a powerful effect on him. A short time before this event the friends had jointly published a small volume of 'Poems' under the pseudonym George F. Preston. 'Ballads and Metrical Sketches' (1860), 'The Threshold of Atrides' (1861), and 'Glimpses of Antiquity' (1862) followed under the same pseudonym, but met with no critical success. More power was evinced in 'Praeterita' (1863), 'Eclogues and Monodramas' (1864), and 'Studies in Verse' (1865), all published under the pseudonym William Lancaster. The blank verse poems of which these volumes chiefly consist are Tennysonian in style and substance. 
After leaving Oxford, where he gained a second class in classics and history, and a brief interlude of unpaid diplomatic work under Lord Stratford de Redcliffe at Constantinople, Warren was called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn in 1860, but probably never had any serious intention of following the law. In 1856 he became an officer of the Cheshire yeomanry, and in 1868 unsuccessfully contested Mid-Cheshire as a Liberal. On his father's second marriage in 1871, he took up his residence in London. 
Warren's 'Philoctetes', a tragedy, published anonymously in 1866, was considered by contemporary critics to be the most powerful of his works. It departs from the Greek model in the introduction of a female character and in its pessimism, features which prevented it from being a mere copy of Sophocles. The principal character seems in not a few respects a portrait of the author himself. 'Orestes', published anonymously in 1868, attracted little attention. A volume of poems entitled 'Rehearsals' (1870), the first published under Warren's own name, indicates that the influence of Tennyson, though still strong, was yielding to that of Browning and Swinburne. 'The Strange Parable', however, and 'Nimrod', both written in blank verse, strike an original note. Another miscellaneous collection, 'Searching the Net' (1873), is mainly concerned with the description of nature and the expression of subjective feeling. Warren then unfortunately gave his time to the composition of a very long and entirely undramatic tragedy. Not one copy of 'The Soldier's Fortune' (1876) was sold, and Warren's disappointment paralysed his activity as a poet for a long time. He began to retreat into an increasingly reclusive existence in London, although he retained his regard for many old friends, including Edmund Gosse, Theodore Watts-Dunton, and Sir Mountstuart Grant-Duff. 
Warren's pursuits were many and interesting; he was a skilled numismatist, and by 1863 had written an essay on Greek coins as illustrative of Greek federal history. He was also an enthusiastic botanist, which accounts for much of the minute description observable in his poems, and was one of the earliest amateurs of the pursuit of collecting book-plates, on which he produced a standard work, 'A Guide to the Study of Book Plates (ex-libris)' (1880). His 'Flora of Cheshire' was prepared from two posthumous manuscripts by Spencer Moore, and was published in 1899 with a prefatory memoir by Sir Mountstuart Grant-Duff. He was also a keen ice-skater. 
In 1887 Warren succeeded to the title of Baron de Tabley by the death of his father, and at once found himself immersed in a multitude of business cares which made writing more difficult than ever. An impulse, however, was at hand from an unexpected quarter. In 1891 A. H. Miles published in his 'Poets of the Century' a selection from de Tabley's poems, with an appreciative criticism. De Tabley was then persuaded by Watts-Dunton and John Lane to republish the best of his poems with additions. The volume, entitled 'Poems Dramatic and Lyrical' (1893), obtained full public recognition for one who had seemed entirely forgotten. A succeeding volume, issued in 1895, demonstrated that much might still have been expected from the author if his physical powers had not begun to forsake him. His health undermined by an attack of influenza, he died somewhat suddenly on 22 November 1895 at Sandringham House, Ryde, on the Isle of Wight, where he had gone to recuperate. He was buried at St Oswald's churchyard, Little Peover, Cheshire. He was unmarried, and the peerage became extinct; his baronetcy devolved on a distant cousin.

Warren, John Taylor (1770-1849), military surgeon, born on 10 November 1770, was the son of Thomas Warren of Dunstable, Bedfordshire. He entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1780, and afterwards studied medicine at St George's Hospital, where he became a favourite pupil of John Hunter (1728-1793). In 1792 Warren was appointed assistant surgeon in the 20th dragoons, a regiment raised for service in Jamaica. After serving there for some time he was ordered to St Domingo. In June 1795 he was appointed surgeon to Colonel Keppel's regiment of foot but before joining, owing to the mortality among European officers, he was nominated surgeon to the 23rd infantry or Royal Welch Fusiliers; he was promoted to the post of staff surgeon to the forces in November 1795. In 1797 he returned to England with the wounded and, having distinguished himself by his work, he was stationed at the recruiting depot in Chatham barracks. He subsequently moved to Gosport, and finally to the Isle of Wight, where he became a friend of Sir George Hewett, the commander of the forces stationed there. In 1800 Warren married Jane-Amelia, daughter of Chevalier Bartholomew Ruspini; they had one daughter. 
Warren was appointed deputy inspector of military hospitals in 1805 and was placed in charge of the home department. In 1808 he proceeded to Spain with a detachment of British troops, and, after being present at Vimiera, he accompanied Sir John Moore on his expedition, despite suffering from acute rheumatism which made it necessary for him to be assisted in mounting and dismounting his horse. When the troops embarked at Corunna he was placed in charge of the wounded, and he was the last British officer to leave the shore. In 1816 he was appointed inspector-general of hospitals, succeeding James Borland in the Mediterranean station. He retired from the regular service in 1820. 
For many years Warren acted as vice-president of the Army Medical Benevolent Society for Orphans, and as trustee of the Society for the Widows of Medical Officers. In 1843, in recognition of his services, a silver vase was presented to him by his fellow officers and friends. He died on 6 October 1849 at his house in Marine Parade, Brighton, and he was buried in the family vault at South Warnborough, Hampshire, where his brother, Thomas Alston Warren, was rector. His wife and daughter survived him.

Warren, Joseph (1804-1881), composer and music editor, was born in London on 20 March 1804. He first studied the violin, and then the piano and organ under J. Stone. At an early age he conducted a society of amateurs, for whom he wrote two symphonies and many other vocal and instrumental pieces. In 1834 he was appointed organist of St Mary's Roman Catholic Chapel, Chelsea, and composed several masses and smaller works for the services there, which remained in manuscript. However, some piano pieces of Warren's were published, and in 1840 he entered into an arrangement with the firm of Cocks & Co., and edited or arranged a large quantity of music including collections of chants in 1840 ('A Selection of Cathedral Chants by the Old English Masters'), 1845, and 'c'.1850, harmonizations of Bach's chorales (1842), a 'Chorister's Handbook' ('c'.1850), and very many arrangements of works by prominent composers for the piano, harmonium, and concertina. He also wrote a number of useful short treatises on composition, orchestral writing, organ playing (2nd edn, 'c'.1850), the harmonium (1855), and madrigal singing, and a method for the concertina (1855), which was very successful. Other works include 'The Chanter's Hand-Guide' (1849) and 'Warren's Psalmody' (1853, reissued 'c'.1860). 
Warren took an active part in the revival of early English music, an objective of the Oxford Movement, and in November 1843 began work on a new edition of Boyce's 'Cathedral Music', for which he is chiefly remembered, which was published in 1849. To the original he added a complete organ accompaniment and inserted extra services by Creyghton and Tomkins, movements from services by Blow, Child, and Aldrich, Parsons's burial service from Edward Lowe's 'A Short Direction for the Performance of Cathedrall Service' (1661), anthems by Gibbons, Byrd, Blow, Tallis, and Tomkins, with some chants, and the symphonies to the anthems by Pelham Humfrey and Blow. Biographies of Boyce and the other composers represented are given, along with lists of their works. As an editor, Warren was careful and thorough, and his works were warmly praised by critics. In conjunction with John Bishop of Cheltenham, he also began in 1848 to issue a similar selection of early Italian, German, and Flemish music for the Catholic church, under the title 'Repertorium musicae antiquae', but only two parts appeared. They were equally good models of editing, as was the collection of John Hilton's 'Ayres or Fa Las' (1844-), which Warren edited for the Musical Antiquarian Society from the partbooks in his library. 
Warren was an intimate friend of another pioneer of English musicology, Edward Francis Rimbault, although the two later appear to have become estranged and sneered in their prefaces at each other's publications. Warren fell into poverty late in life, and his valuable library, which included some of the most important early English manuscripts, sale catalogues, and autograph manuscripts of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, among others (his editions of Beethoven's 'Christ at the Mount of Olives' and Rossini's 'Stabat mater' had appeared in 1844), was parted with piece by piece. Around 1872 he became paralysed, and was apparently saved from destitution by the musicologist W. H. Cummings. He died at Bexley, Kent, on 8 March 1881.

Warren, Lemuel (1770-1833), army officer, entered the army as an ensign in the 17th foot on 7 March 1787, obtained his lieutenancy in it on 27 October 1788, and was for some time on Lord Hood's fleet, in which the regiment served as marines. On 12 June 1793 he raised an independent company of foot, of which he was appointed captain; but on 2 January 1794 exchanged to the 27th (Inniskillings), then in Lord Moira's army camped at Southampton. He served with the 27th in Flanders from 1794 to 1796 under the duke of York; he was present at the siege of Nijmegen and at the sortie of 6 November, and commanded the advanced picquet of the garrison. He accompanied the force under Lord Cathcart sent to attack the French army at Bommel, and was present at the action of Geldermalsen in January 1796. 
Warren embarked with the 27th for the West Indies in September 1796, and commanded their grenadiers at the storming of the advanced posts at Morne Fortune, St Lucia; at the conclusion of the operations he was compelled by sickness to return to England. He served in the expedition to the Netherlands in 1799, including the actions of 27 August, 19 September, and 2 and 6 October. He served as a major of the 27th (from 31 December 1799) in the expedition to Ferrol in 1800; and in the Egyptian campaign of 1801, including the operations before Alexandria, receiving the Sultan's medal for the campaign. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the 27th on 16 August 1804. He served in the expedition to Sicily in 1809, and afterwards on the east coast of Spain. He commanded a brigade at the battle of Castalla, and the siege of Tarragona, and was present at the blockade of Barcelona. 
On 4 June 1813 Warren was promoted colonel in the army. He accompanied the division of the British army across the Peninsula to Bayonne, and from there to Bordeaux, where the 27th immediately embarked for North America. He joined the 1st battalion of the Inniskillings before Paris in 1815, a few days before the entry of Louis XVIII. He was promoted major-general on 12 August 1819, and died suddenly in London on 29 October 1833.

Warren, Matthew (bap. 1642, d. 1706), nonconformist minister and tutor, was baptized on 4 December 1642 at Otterford, Somerset, a younger son of John Warren, 'a gentleman of good estate', and his wife, Anne (Calamy, 2.747). He was educated at Crewkerne grammar school and St John's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 3 July 1658. At the Restoration he left Oxford and went to Reading for a year with his tutor but then returned to Otterford and began to preach. He held no benefice but was silenced by the 'Act of Uniformity' in 1662. 
Warren began a school which developed into an academy for training young men for the nonconformist ministry, one of the first to run such an academy (though such institutions had their antecedents in the training of godly ministers before the civil war). When he began to teach is uncertain but his earliest known pupil is John Shower, who joined him in 1671. About twenty of Warren's pupils are known, including Christopher Taylor (in whose ordination at Lyme Regis on 25 August 1687 Warren took part) and Henry Grove, who eventually succeeded Warren as tutor of the academy. After a year or two Warren moved his academy from Otterford to Taunton. In 1672 he was licensed under the declaration of indulgence as a presbyterian minister for the house of John Hill in Withypool, 24 miles away on Exmoor. The following year, on 14 April, he married Martha Rossiter in St Mary Magdalene Church, Taunton. 
In 1687 Warren and Emmanuel Harford were called to be joint ministers of Pauls Meeting Presbyterian Church, built in Taunton in 1672 but closed in the disturbed times leading up to the Monmouth rebellion and opened again under James II's declaration of indulgence. Harford was linked to Warren by marriage. Warren continued to run the academy and the students, lay and ministerial, lived in his house as part of his family, the course normally lasting five years. Warren lectured in Latin, the usual language of converse in the academy. Warren, Harford, and the ministerial students preached in the village chapels in the vicinity, including Bishops Hull, Pitminster, and Hatch. Warren thought that the best system for ministerial training was 'Bible' study but encouraged freedom of thought and the study of contemporary learning. Students seeking a church were issued with a certificate of proficiency signed by both Warren and Harford. Warren preached occasionally at meetings of the Exeter Assembly of presbyterian and congregationalist ministers, which gave bursaries to some of his students, but which in 1695 complained that some of them had Baptist beliefs. 
Warren's son, another Matthew, is recorded in a Pauls Meeting document of 1699 as participating in a pastoral visitation. On 14 April 1692, after Martha's death, Warren married Elizabeth Baker at St Mary Magdalene; they had a son, also called Matthew, who was baptized at Pauls Meeting on 9 July 1704 when Warren was sixty-one, and who is recorded in the register of baptisms that Warren had started in 1699. Warren also took part in the town life of Taunton, acting as a conservator of the River Tone in 1698. 
Warren died on 14 June 1706 at Taunton, and was buried in St Mary Magdalene, where there used to be a memorial to him. In his will he set aside $400 to be put out at interest for the education and maintenance of his son until he reached adulthood; the rest of his estate he left to his widow. John Sprint of Milborne Port preached his funeral sermon which was published with a memoir, thought to be by Christopher Taylor, who also wrote a Latin epitaph for Warren. Calamy, whose account drew heavily on the memoir, wrote that: 'Many young gentlemen that now behave worthily in civil stations, and others that are useful in the ministry, owe their education to him: and all that knew him, own him to have been well qualified for the service he did them, by a good share of useful learning joined with humility, modesty and good humour, which were his distinguishing characters. (Calamy, 2.747)' Harford died two months after Warren, and Sprint also preached his funeral sermon. Warren and Harford began their ministry with a small, fearful congregation but finished with a confident following of almost two thousand. Pauls Meeting in Paul Street became Taunton United Reformed Church in 1972.

Warren, Pelham (1778-1835), physician, born in London on 7 October 1778, was the ninth son of Richard Warren (1731-1797), physician to George III, and his wife, Elizabeth, only daughter of Peter Shaw (1694-1763). Frederick Warren (1775-1848) was his elder brother. He was educated at Dr Thompson's school at Kensington, at Westminster School, and from 1796 at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated MB in 1800 and MD in 1805. 
Warren commenced practice in London immediately after he had taken his first degree in medicine, and on 6 April 1803 he was elected physician to St George's Hospital, an office which he resigned in April 1816, having established a large independent practice. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1805, and a fellow in 1806. He was made censor in 1810, Harveian orator in 1826, and elect on 11 August 1829. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 8 April 1813. He married on 3 May 1814 Penelope, daughter of William Davies Shipley (1745-1826), dean of St Asaph. On 24 July 1830 he was gazetted physician-extraordinary to the king, but he declined the honour. 
Warren enjoyed one of the largest practices in the metropolis. According to his contemporaries he was an accurate and careful observer of disease, and a very sound practical physician. He was an accomplished classical scholar and a strong defender of the character and independence of the medical profession. 'His manners were peculiar and not always pleasing, being sometimes cold and abrupt. He took a prodigious quantity of snuff, and was plain and untidy in his dress, perhaps to affectation' ('Medical Gazette', 405). 
Warren died at his home, Worting House, near Basingstoke, of disease of the liver on 2 December 1835, survived by his wife and seven children. He was buried in Worting church, where there is a tablet with an inscription composed by his friend and schoolfellow Henry Vincent Bayley, canon of Westminster. In 1837 his widow presented his portrait painted and engraved by John Linnell to the Royal College of Physicians.

Warren, Sir Peter (1703/4-1752), naval officer and politician, was the youngest son of Michael Warren of Warrenstown, co. Meath, an officer in the army of James II, and Catherine, only daughter of Sir Christopher Aylmer, baronet, brother of Admiral Matthew Aylmer. Born into a Roman Catholic family, Warren was brought up a protestant so as to enter naval service. He followed his eldest brother, Oliver (died 1724), into the navy, entering at Dublin as an ordinary seaman on the 'Rye' (30 guns) in 1716, under Aylmer's patronage and that of his son-in-law, Admiral Sir John Norris. After serving in Irish waters Warren spent most of his early years either on the coast of west Africa or in the West Indies, hunting pirates and warding off 'guarda-costas'. He was made lieutenant in the 'Guernsey' off the Liberian coast in January 1723, when natives killed one of his brother officers. Placed in command of the 'Falkland' (50 guns) upon the death of his captain in 1726, he earned freight money by carrying bullion owned by the South Sea Company. In 1728 he took post as captain of the 'Grafton' (70 guns) under Norris, then commanding the Baltic fleet. Later that year, in command of the 'Solebay' (20 guns), he carried to Jamaica and Vera Cruz news of the peace treaty and called at South Carolina on his route home, where he met George Anson. In July 1731 Warren married Susannah, daughter of Stephen DeLancey of New York and sister of James DeLancey, later the colony's lieutenant-governor. The couple had six children. 
Between 1730 and 1732 Warren commanded the 'Solebay' on the New York and South Carolina stations. In 1734-5 he served in the 'Leopard' (50 guns) as part of the western squadron commanded by Norris. In 1736-41 he was captain of the 'Squirrel' (20 guns) at Boston, and in 1739 he submitted a report on the state of the Nova Scotia fisheries. Upon the outbreak of war with Spain, Warren served at the 1740 failed siege of St Augustine, under the senior captain, Vincent Pierce. From Florida he sailed for Jamaica to serve under Vernon, who thought him an 'active good officer' for his success in taking Spanish prizes. In January 1742 he was given command of the 'Superbe' (60 guns) and was again appointed to the New York station. That August the Admiralty adopted Warren's suggestion that some of the ships stationed on the North American coast be formed into a squadron to serve in the West Indies during winter months. In this way he came to command the Leeward Islands squadron, which distinguished itself by taking prizes, especially in 1744 when war ensnared France. 
Warren became well known as a result of the 1745 siege of Fortress Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island. In 1741 he had first discussed the idea with William Pepperell, appointed the military commander. In 1743 he told the Admiralty that its capture and that of Canada would prove of great consequence to Britain. In April 1745 he took his squadron (the 'Superbe' and three frigates) north to Canso, where he found a dozen colonial armed vessels escorting the colonial expeditionary force. He effected a close blockade of the Louisbourg harbour, and was rewarded when the 'Vigilant' (64 guns) was taken, and immediately commissioned by the commodore. Naval reinforcements thereafter joined him, so that by mid-June he commanded six ships of the line and five frigates mounting 558 guns with 3585 officers, seamen, and marines. In the face of this naval force and on the eve of a planned frontal assault by the New Englanders, the fortress capitulated on generous terms. 
News of this success caused a great sensation in London. In celebration there were bonfires, the Tower guns were fired, poems and broadsheets were published, loyal greetings drafted, and public houses renamed. Warren's behaviour was contrasted with the unfortunate naval officers implicated in the inglorious affair off Toulon in February 1744, when a Franco-Spanish squadron had escaped the navy. For the first time American affairs commanded widespread attention at home. Warren was promoted rear-admiral. He declined a baronetcy as he had no son. Named first English governor of Cape Breton, he immediately begged to be relieved, pleading ill health with Anson and Sandwich, and his desire to serve at sea with Bedford and Newcastle. His real thoughts were probably on half pay and the governorship of New York, for which he had been negotiating with the governor, Vice-Admiral George Clinton, and where he had acquired important family and financial connections. 
Warren's enthusiasm for Cape Breton was at first almost boundless. In letters home he wrote of Louisbourg as a mere stepping stone to the conquest of Canada, and thus Britain's domination of both fur and fish, while he pressed for an expeditionary force to be mounted in 1746. The politicians were divided. Henry Pelham thought Louisbourg's capture an obstacle to peace. By contrast, lords Newcastle and Hardwicke basked in the reflected glory while John Carteret, William Pitt, and George II spoke warmly of the action. 
Relieved of his governorship in June 1746, Warren spent the summer in Boston concerting plans with Governor William Shirley to secure colonial support for a planned expedition to Canada. The plan, which was only formulated by the ministry in late March, called for a two-pronged attack: one centred on Albany via Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River to Montreal; the other based in Portsmouth involving 4000 regulars, an artillery train, and a large squadron under Warren's command to seize Quebec via the St Lawrence River. The campaign was a fiasco, as the force never left England, and the American troops accomplished nothing north of Saratoga. Without orders, Warren sailed home with a detailed plan for 1747 worked out with Governor Shirley. The Admiralty was now convinced that it had too few ships both to blockade the French in their home ports and also undertake the Canada expedition. At first Warren was given command of an eight-ship squadron planned to reinforce Louisbourg. Plans were altered when news arrived of a French armament, and Warren was named second-in-command to Anson to cruise in the Bay of Biscay. Off Cape Ortegal on May 1747 they caught the French force, under La Jonquiere, and overwhelmed it. Anson was rewarded with a peerage and $62,991 in prize money, Warren with the Order of the Bath and $31,496. In July he was promoted vice-admiral. Yet France still retained formidable naval forces both in her Atlantic ports and in Toulon, while French trade to the Caribbean and Quebec was little hindered. Mastery of the western approaches was established only in October when Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke -- illness having kept Warren ashore -- crushed a French squadron off Cape Finisterre. Warren resumed command of this western squadron in 1748, but no French or Spanish fleet put to sea before peace preliminaries ended the war. 
Warren never again went to sea. In 1747 he had been elected MP for the city of Westminster at the cost of $2200 and, as he then owned no land in England, the purchase of an annuity for $4800 on land from the duke of Bedford. In December 1748, despite Anson's support, he failed in a bid for a vacancy on the Admiralty board. He soon alienated his supporters by leading opposition to one clause of Anson's 1749 naval bill, by which half pay officers became subject to court martial on grounds identical to serving officers. Pamphlets were written and naval officers were summoned to meetings at which Warren and Norris presided. Warren and others addressed the Admiralty board, a most unusual circumstance. Warren's point carried the day, but it cost him his alliance with Bedford, Sandwich, and Anson. In parliament he was active in committees, chairing several and twice carrying bills to the Lords. He was one of the best informed members on American affairs, concerned especially with colonial trade, currency, boundary disputes, and the fisheries. Deeply suspicious of French ambitions, Warren advocated a strong navy and powerful European alliances. He also proposed in 1747 new designs for admirals' and captains' uniforms. 
The war allowed him to garner $127,405 in prize money, the bulk of it in 1745 and 1747. Only Anson perhaps accumulated more. His wealth was invested in land and money-lending in England, Ireland, and the American colonies; he also bought heavily into the national debt. Much of Greenwich Village on Manhattan Island was later erected on his farm, which was sold by his heirs after 1787. He installed his nephew, William Johnson, to superintend his Mohawk valley lands, launching the young man into a celebrated career on that frontier. His Hampshire estate in the Meon valley, conveniently close to Portsmouth, purchased in 1747, remained in the hands of his heirs until the 1860s. In 1747 he also purchased 15 Cavendish Square, in London. Of Warren's six children, two were born in Boston, two in New York, and two in London, to which he summoned his family in 1747. Two of his children, including his only son, died in a 1744 epidemic. His eldest daughter married Charles Fitzroy, later Baron Southampton, while his third daughter, Charlotte, married the earl of Abingdon. Warren died suddenly of a fever in Dublin on 29 July 1752 and was buried in Warrenstown, co. Meath. His widow commissioned Roubiliac to carve his monument, now in Westminster Abbey.

Warren, Sir Ralph (c.1483-1553), merchant and local politician, was apprenticed to William Botary, a prominent member of the London Mercers' Company, of which he became free in 1507. He was already exporting cloth to the Low Countries in 1506, and soon became a leading member of both the Company of Merchant Adventurers and the Staplers' Company. His cloth wholesaling brought him into contact with the royal household, of which he was a major creditor by 1532. His business acumen was often placed at the service of the crown, whose servants in Flanders and Italy he and the Greshams supplied with large sums through the 1540s. Closely associated with the court, he numbered among his friends royal servants such as Thomas Cromwell, for whom he helped secure the lease of the mansion place at Stepney from the Mercers' Company in 1534, and William Paulet, marquess of Winchester, lord treasurer from 1550, whom he described in his will as 'my very good lord' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/36, fol. 114'v'). 
By 1541 Warren's subsidy assessment of $4000 suggests that, after his fellow mercer Sir John Gresham, he was the wealthiest man in the City. He acquired several manors in Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Northamptonshire, and Cambridgeshire, as well as owning an extensive portfolio of property about the capital. At the beginning of his business career he resided in the parish of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, but by 1524 he was living in St Sythe's Lane in the parish of St Benet Sherehog, his London base for the rest of his life. By the time of his death he had acquired suburban residences at both Bethnal Green and Fulham. 
Warren was a committed member of his livery company, serving as warden in 1521-2 and as master in 1530-31, 1542-3, and again briefly (on the death of Sir Richard Gresham in office) in 1549. After the surrender of the hospital of St Thomas Acre on the dissolution of the religious houses in 1538 he was instrumental, with Gresham and other leading mercers, in procuring the purchase by the Mercers' Company of the church and precincts for their hall. In 1542 the buildings were vested with Warren, who then surrendered his interest to the company. He was elected alderman for Aldersgate ward on 18 June 1528 and served the office of sheriff in 1528-9. On 26 October 1531 he moved to the ward of Candlewick, which he continued to serve until his death. His close connections with the court made him a more reliable agent in the troubled months surrounding the Pilgrimage of Grace than the conservative William Holles, whose turn it was to serve the office of lord mayor, and the king wrote to the City on the day of the election, 13 October 1536, to demand that Warren be elected. Although he was 'incontynent chosen', the City registered a formal protest with the crown. Another mark of royal favour was the elaborate procession on 22 December 1536 in which Warren accompanied the king, the queen, and the Lady Mary through the City on their way to Greenwich immediately after the mayor had been knighted in the Great Chamber of Presence. Warren, unusually, served a second term as lord mayor, being elected on 17 April 1544 to succeed Sir William Bowyer, who had died four days previously. 
In spite of his close connections with Cromwell, Warren's religious sympathies seem to have been conservative. In his will, dated 4 July 1552, at the high water mark of the Reformation, he bequeathed his soul according to a conventional Catholic formula, and during his lifetime his gifts to the Mercers' Company included, in 1542, a hearse cloth embroidered with scripture and stained glass for the chapel windows, and, in 1544, a great bell to ring at mass there. He also acted as a commissioner against heretics in 1541. For a man of his wealth his charitable bequests were modest: in 1548 he had given his company a loan stock of $100 to be given to two young men, the interest from which was to pay for a dinner for the livery, but the bequests in his will (spread between St Bartholomew's Hospital, the lazar houses, the London prisons, highway repair, poor maidens' marriages, and poor scholars at the universities) amounted to only about $150. 
Warren married twice. His first wife was Christiana, the daughter of Richard Warcup of Sinnington in Yorkshire, and the widow of Roger North (died 1509), a London merchant. This first marriage appears to have been childless, but his stepchildren were a distinguished pair: Sir Edward North, by the time of Warren's death, was a privy councillor, and Joanne Wilkinson was the Marian exile. Warren's second wife was Joan, probably the daughter of John Trelake, alias Davy, a Cornish gentleman; there were two surviving children at his death, Richard (died 1598) and Joan (died 1572). The latter married Warren's ward Sir Henry Williams (afterwards Cromwell) of Hinchinbrooke, Huntingdonshire, the grandfather of the Lord Protector. Warren himself died of the stone on 11 July 1553 at Bethnal Green, and was buried five days later in the chancel of the church of St Benet Sherehog near the tomb of his first wife, the funeral being followed by what the London undertaker Henry Machyn described as 'a gret dener as I have sene' ('Diary of Henry Machyn', 36). His widow married, on 25 November 1558, alderman Sir Thomas White, the founder of St John's College, Oxford, and died in 1572.

Warren, Richard (1731-1797), physician, born at Cavendish, Suffolk, on 4 December 1731, was the third son of Dr Richard Warren (1681-1748), archdeacon of Suffolk and rector of Cavendish, and his wife, Priscilla (died 1774), daughter of John Fenner. He was the younger brother of John Warren (1730-1800), bishop of Bangor, and, like him, was educated at Cavendish School in Bury St Edmunds. He entered Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1748, shortly after the death of his father, and graduated BA as fourth wrangler in 1752, obtaining in succeeding years the prizes awarded to middle and senior bachelors for proficiency in Latin prose composition. He proceeded MA in 1755 and MD on 3 July 1762. He was a fellow between 1756 and 1759. 
Warren was tutor at Jesus College to the only son of Peter Shaw (1694-1763), physician-in-ordinary to George II and George III. He gained Shaw's esteem, married his daughter Elizabeth in 1759, and in 1763 succeeded to his father-in-law's practice. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1762. 
Shortly after Warren began to practise, Sir Edward Wilmot, physician to the court and son-in-law of Richard Mead, recommended him as a suitable assistant for his attendance on Princess Amelia. When Wilmot retired, Warren continued to act as physician to the princess, and by her influence was appointed physician to George III in 1762, after the resignation of his father-in-law. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 3 March 1763, and delivered the Goulstonian lectures at the college in 1764 and the Harveian oration in 1768. He acted as censor in 1764, 1776, and 1782. On 9 August 1784 he was named an elect. 
On 5 August 1756, having at that time a licence 'ad practicandum' from the University of Cambridge, Warren was elected a physician to the Middlesex Hospital, and on 21 January 1760 he became physician to St George's Hospital. The former appointment he resigned in November 1758, the latter in May 1766. In 1787 he was appointed physician to the prince of Wales, and was the most sought-after society doctor of that time; a pre-eminence which he maintained to the last. Warren's annual income was in excess of anything previously accrued from the practice of medicine in Britain. He is said to have earned $9000 a year from the time of the onset of George III's insanity in 1788, and he bequeathed to his family upwards of $150,000. He had a reputation for exceptional powers of mind and solidity of judgement. 
Warren published two papers in the 'Transactions' of the Royal College of Physicians. His 'Oratio ex Harveii instituto' was published in 1769. 
Warren died at his house in Dover Street, London, on 23 June 1797, leaving a widow, eight sons, and two daughters. He was buried in Kensington church on 30 June 1797. Elizabeth Inchbald, who had a great admiration for him, produced some mourning verses to his memory, addressed to Mrs Warren. Of his sons, Frederick Warren (1775-1848) became a rear-admiral and Pelham Warren (1778-1835) became a physician.

Warren, Richard Augustus (c.1705-1775), Jacobite army officer, was the son of John Warren of Corduff or Courtduffe, co. Dublin, and Mary, 'nee' Jones. The family were recusant gentry. One of three younger sons, two of whom, William and John, had joined Lally's Franco-Irish regiment in the French service, Richard Warren started in business as a merchant at Marseilles. On hearing of the preparations by Prince Charles, the Young Pretender, for an expedition to Scotland in 1744, he wound up his affairs and joined his brothers' regiment as a volunteer. On 10 August 1745 he was transferred as a captain without pay to Rothe's Franco-Irish infantry. In the middle of October he embarked for Scotland and landed at Stonehaven. He joined the prince at Edinburgh, became aide-de-camp to Lord George Murray, was made a colonel at Brampton on 12 November, and took part in the siege of Carlisle. 
After the Young Pretender's retreat from Derby, Warren was sent to raise levies in Atholl, and he collected the fishing boats for the expedition by which Lord Loudoun's force of 1500 men, posted between the Moray and Dornoch firths, was surprised and dispersed. On 18 April 1746 he sailed from Findhorn with dispatches from the marquis d'Eguilles, the French envoy, urging reinforcements. He reached Versailles on the 30th, having been sent for the purpose of inflating the importance of the inconsequential Jacobite victory at the 'route of Moy', in March 1746. In gratitude for the news, and for the safe delivery of several prisoners captured at the battle, the French court awarded him the rank of colonel, and he was made a knight of the order of St Louis. Commissioned to rescue the prince, he embarked under great secrecy on 31 August at Cape Frehel on the frigate 'Heureux' with another ship, the 'Prince de Conti', and arrived at Lochmanuagh, Inverness-shire, on 6 September 1746. After three weeks' search he took the Young Pretender on board, on 30 September at Lochmanuagh, and landed him on 10 October at Roscoff, in Brittany. 
Warren had desired the French title of baron if he succeeded in his task. Instead, James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, made him a Jacobite baronet on 3 November 1746, but he was prohibited from publicly assuming that rank until 1751. He was aide-de-camp to Marshal Saxe until 1748, received the rank of brigadier-general from James Edward in 1750, and was advanced within the royal and military order of St Louis in 1755. He paid a visit to London in 1751 and was included on a list of proposed attainders for rebels in 1752. He had a French pension of 1200 livres, and in 1754 obtained a captaincy in Rothe's regiment. In 1762 he was made a 'marechal-de-camp', was naturalized in 1764, and was appointed commandant of Belle Ile, which post he held until his death on 21 June 1775. Unmarried, he left a will in favour of a young man named MacCarthy, but his debts exceeded the assets. His papers are preserved in the Morbihan archives at Vannes.

Warren, Sir Samuel (1769-1839), naval officer, was born at Sandwich, Kent, on 9 January 1769, entered the navy in January 1782 on board the 'Sampson', with his kinsman Captain John Harvey (1740-1794), and was present at the relief of Gibraltar and the encounter with the allied fleet off Cape Spartel. Promoted lieutenant on 3 November 1790, he was appointed to the 'Ramillies' in 1793 with Captain Henry Harvey, and was present at the battle of 1 June 1794. In 1795 he was in the 'Royal George', flagship of Lord Bridport, in the action off Lorient on 23 June. On 1 March 1797 he was promoted to command the sloop 'Scourge' on the Leeward Islands station, where he made many rich prizes and captured several privateers. In August 1800 he brought the 'Scourge' home. He married, on 27 October 1800, Sarah Moulden Burton, daughter of a clerk of the check at Chatham. They had seven children. 
On 29 April 1802 Warren was advanced to post rank. In 1805 he commanded the 'Glory' (98 guns) as flagship to Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling in the action off Cape Finisterre on 22 July. In 1806-7 he was again with Stirling in the 'Sampson' (64 guns) and in the 'Diadem' (64 guns) during the operations in the Plate River; in 1809 he commanded the 'Bellerophon' (74 guns), one of the squadron in the Baltic, with Sir James Saumarez. In September 1810 he was appointed to the frigate 'President' (44 guns), captured from the French in 1806, and in her took part in the operations resulting in the capture of Java. On 4 June 1815 he was made a CB. After the peace he successively commanded the 'Blenheim' and the 'Bulwark' third rates, and the 'Seringapatam' (46 guns); in the last he took the British ambassador to Sweden in the summer of 1823. In January 1830 he was appointed agent for transports at Deptford. On 3 August 1835 he was made KCH and was knighted by the king; on 10 January 1837 he attained the rank of rear-admiral, and he was made a KCB on 18 April 1839. He died at Southampton (where he was then living) on 15 October 1839.

Warren, Samuel (1781-1862), Wesleyan Methodist minister, was born either in Great Yarmouth or Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, the son of Samuel Warren, a sea captain. In 1806 he married his first wife, Anne (1778-1823), daughter of Richard and Elizabeth Williams; they had a daughter and six sons, the eldest of whom, also Samuel Warren, became a noted novelist. Anne died in 1823; Warren's second wife, Jane, survived him. Warren was an apprentice on his father's ship when it was captured by the French in May 1794. After some eighteen months as a prisoner of war he took up nautical studies in Liverpool. There he became a Wesleyan Methodist in 1800, entering the ministry two years later. He gained the degrees of MA (1818) and LLD (1825) from Glasgow University, produced a standard manual of Methodist law (1827), and commanded respect, if little influence, in the Wesleyan hierarchy. 
In 1834 Warren unexpectedly emerged as the leading figure in a controversy that resulted in a major secession from Wesleyan Methodism and the formation of the Wesleyan Association (designated Wesleyan Methodist Association in 1839). The immediate cause of this division was the proposed establishment of the first Wesleyan Theological Institution. At the Wesleyan conference of 1834 Warren headed the unsuccessful opposition to this proposal and particularly objected to the further concentration of power in the hands of Jabez Bunting, the nominated president of the institution and the dominant Wesleyan figure of this period. Some connexional leaders alleged that Warren was motivated by his failure to secure a teaching post at the institution. The publication of Warren's conference speech (September 1834) and his refusal to defend it at the Manchester special district meeting led to his suspension from ministerial duties as superintendent of the Manchester Oldham Street circuit (22 October 1834). 
These proceedings prompted a widespread protest movement that originated in south Lancashire, where the Grand Central Association, the forerunner of the Wesleyan Association, was formed in Manchester (6 November 1834). Originally known as Warrenites, the protesters also campaigned in defence of the local, lay-dominated Methodist institutions against the central powers of the exclusively ministerial Wesleyan conference. During the ensuing bitter contest, in which the Wesleyan authorities expelled all dissidents, Warren failed in his application to the court of chancery for restoration to the Oldham Street circuit pulpits (March 1835). He was formally expelled from the Wesleyan conference in August 1835. 
The Wesleyan Association, the earliest reported membership of which was 21,275 (1837), elected Warren president at its first annual assembly (August 1836). It quickly became apparent, however, that Warren himself had serious reservations about the democratic character of this new body. He sought to check this tendency by promoting union with the Methodist New Connexion, but he was defeated at the annual assembly of 1837. Shortly afterwards he resigned from the Wesleyan Association (October 1837). The final twist in his public life occurred in the following year when he was ordained in the Church of England. He was inducted into the living of All Souls, Ancoats (December 1840), a languishing cause in a slum parish, where he remained until his death at Polygon Avenue, Ardwick, Manchester, on 23 May 1862.

Warren, Samuel (1807-1877), lawyer and writer, was born on 23 May 1807 near Wrexham, Denbighshire, the elder son of Dr Samuel Warren (1781-1862), clergyman, and his first wife, Anne (1778-1823), daughter of Richard and Elizabeth Williams. Little is known about Samuel Warren's early education except his statement in the preface to 'Passages from the Diary of a Late Physician' that he was for six years before 1827 'actively engaged in the practical study of physic' ('Preface to fifth edition', edn of 1837 'Passages' in Warren, 'Works', 1854-5, vol. 1), perhaps as an apothecary's apprentice. From 1826 to 1828 Warren attended the University of Edinburgh where he studied various subjects and won prizes in comparative jurisprudence and poetry, but did not obtain a degree. His poetry prize led to introductions to Christopher North (John Wilson), and to Thomas De Quincey, two of the leading lights in 'Blackwood's Magazine'. 
Warren was admitted to the Inner Temple, London, in 1828; he studied law and worked as a special pleader there until 1837, when he was called to the bar. In 1831 he had married Eliza Ballinger ('c'.1802-1868); they had two sons and a daughter. This period also saw the serialization in 'Blackwood's Magazine' of the work that made his literary reputation, 'Passages from the Diary of a Late Physician' (1831-7). He later described his views and feelings in writing the book as 'those not of a Novelist, but of a Moralist' whose 'steady purpose... was to exhibit deathbeds' ('Preface', 1854 edn of 'Passages' in Warren, 'Works', 1854-5, vol. 1). The success of the book depended on the sensational and melodramatic atmosphere of the stories which parade the horrors of debauchery, disease, madness, and death with an almost erotic fascination. 
Warren had not restricted his writing to creative efforts during this time; he also published the first edition of 'A Popular Introduction to Law Studies' (1835), a guide for those intending to become law students. In 1837 Warren, with John William Smith, published 'Select Extracts from Blackstone's Commentaries', and he was later to publish a much extended 'Blackstone's' in 1855 and 1856. 
Warren's second novel, published in 'Blackwood's Magazine' from 1839 to 1841, was 'Ten Thousand a-Year'. The novel, which was an immediate best-seller, concerns a firm of attorneys who discover that Tittlebat Titmouse, a poor draper's clerk, may have a claim to the large estate of Yatton. The attorneys commence an action which results in Titmouse displacing the unbelievably pious John Aubrey as the owner of the estate, and its annual income of $10,000. Titmouse revels in his new found wealth, until a new round of litigation is commenced which returns Aubrey to his place as squire of Yatton. Titmouse is disgraced, and ends his life in a lunatic asylum. The narrator repeatedly tells the reader that the English legal system is close to perfection, but the actual workings of the law in 'Ten Thousand a-Year' paint a more negative picture. 
Dickens seems to have read Warren's fiction and non-fiction, and to have borrowed images and ideas. Sir Leicester Dedlock and the solicitor Vholes in 'Bleak House' (1852-3) resemble the earl of Dreddlington and Gammon, Titmouse's principal lawyer, in 'Ten Thousand a-Year'. The striking picture of barristers in court bobbing up and down like hammers in a pianoforte in the first chapter of 'Bleak House' is similar to an image in chapter nine of the second edition of 'A Popular Introduction to Law Studies' (1845). Wemmick's habit of collecting mementos from Jaggers's criminal clients in 'Great Expectations' parallels Quirk's practice in 'Ten Thousand a-Year'. Warren may have returned the favour by using elements of the Bardell v. Pickwick case in 'Ten Thousand a-Year'. 
Warren's third novel, 'Now and then' (1847), tells the story of Adam Ayliffe who is convicted unjustly of murder, although his death sentence is commuted to transportation. The novel leaps forward twenty years to reveal that Adam was innocent of the murder, and we are told by the parish priest, a character apparently incapable of irony, that the wrongful conviction resulted from 'the unavoidably imperfect administration of justice' (ch. 18). Much of the novel is taken up with the struggle by the priest to convince the victim's father, the proud and vengeful earl of Milverstoke, that he should show Christian mercy and forgiveness to Ayliffe. The earl (and the reader) eventually gets the point. The broader religious goal of the novel is to justify God's ways to humanity, but Warren relies on assertion and sermonizing to urge the reader to faith. 
In 1848 Warren published a series of four lectures, originally given to students and young attorneys at the Law Society, as 'The Moral, Social, and Professional Duties of Attorneys and Solicitors' (1848). The book is a mixture of ethical advice, tips on practising law, and assurances that attorneys can, with effort, learn how to behave like gentlemen. Warren assures his audience that attorneys are not inferior to barristers, although he is less egalitarian elsewhere. Other legal publications included the second and third editions of 'Law Studies' (1845, 1863) and two books on election law (1852, 1853). Warren continued to practise law until the mid-1850s and became a queen's counsel in 1851, but found it difficult to attract business. He achieved some success within the Inner Temple where he was elected as a bencher in 1851. 
Warren continued to explore philosophical and religious issues in his creative work, especially in 'The Lily and the Bee: an Apologue of the Crystal Palace of 1851' (1851), 'The Intellectual and Moral Development of the Present Age' (1853), and 'Speculators among the stars' (1854). These texts are interesting as a catalogue of one religious Victorian's terrified vision of a world without Christianity: dark, amoral, determinist, animalistic, despairing, sinful, a charnel house of decayed and decaying opinions, a 'mental and moral shipwreck' ('Intellectual and Moral Development'). 
William Blackwood & Sons published 'Miscellanies: Critical, Imaginative, and Juridical' in 1854, and a collected 'Works' in five volumes in 1854 and 1855. Warren's political fidelity, as well as his writing, were recognized when he was in 1853 made an honorary DCL of the University of Oxford, with Bulwer-Lytton and others, on the occasion of Lord Derby's installation as chancellor of the university. His Conservative political sentiments led him to support the policies of Peel and later Lord Derby in a series of books and articles. In 1856 Warren was elected to the House of Commons for the borough of Midhurst (Sussex). He held the seat until 1859 when he was appointed a master in lunacy 'at a munificent $2,000 a year stipend' (Sutherland, 660). The 'Lunatics Acts' of the mid-nineteenth century empowered the masters in lunacy to make decisions about persons of unsound mind, including the management of their property. Most contemporary observers praised Warren's handling of the mastership. Warren became reader at the Inner Temple in 1865, and treasurer in 1866. He also held the judicial post of recorder of Hull from 1852 to 1874. 
Warren's first marriage had been happy, and he was deeply affected by the loss of his wife on 29 August 1868. Some three years later, on 23 August 1871, he married Louisa Beaumont. Warren died on 29 July 1877 at his home at 16 Manchester Square, London. He was survived by his second wife, and was buried on 3 August 1877 at Christ Church, Esher, Surrey, where his son was rector.

Warren, Thomas (c.1617-1694), Presbyterian minister, matriculated as a sizar from St Catharine's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1634, as of Suffolk, graduated BA in 1638 and proceeded MA in 1641. On 1 January 1647 he was admitted to the rectory of Houghton, Hampshire, though his formal presentation under the great seal took place on 6 February 1651 following its cession by the sequestered rector. From Houghton in April 1654 he issued 'Unbeleevers No Subjects of Justification', directed against the work of William Eyre (died 1670), the curate of St Thomas's, Salisbury, and dedicated to the mayor, aldermen, and common councillors of Salisbury. Following the Restoration, Warren was on 19 July 1660 presented by the crown to the Houghton rectory, and on 22 December he was ordained deacon and priest in Scotland by the bishop of Galloway, Thomas Sydserff. Instituted on 1 February 1661 to his rectory by Bishop Brian Duppa, he was ejected under the 'Act of Uniformity' of 1662 and a successor was collated soon after, on 23 September. According to his papers, Warren was offered a choice of the bishoprics of Salisbury and Winchester if he should conform. 
At an unknown date Warren married Elizabeth, with whom he had three sons and four daughters. She was buried at Romsey, probably the couple's home during the early years of the Restoration. His second marriage, by licence of 10 July 1667, was to Mary Evans, aged forty-five, of St Mary Savoy, London. On 25 July 1672 he was licensed as a presbyterian preacher at the house of Clement Warren of Romsey, probably the mercer of that name later designated an executor. He is reported to have had doubts about taking advantage of James II's declaration of indulgence in 1687. In later years, he became almost blind, and the Common Fund of the Presbyterian and Independent ministers granted him $6 a year between 1690 and 1693. Warren was listed as one of the Hampshire preachers in the winter of 1690-91, 'an ancient and learned man as any in ye county 70 years old' ('Calamy rev.', 512). In his will dated from Romsey on 13 April 1693 and 25 January 1694 Warren mentioned a third wife, Hannah, and disposed of property at Andover. He died on 27 January 1694, aged seventy-seven or in his seventy-seventh year, and was buried at Romsey Abbey.

Warren, William (fl. 1578-1581), poet, was the author of 'A pithie and pleasaunt discourse dialoguewyse betwene a welthie citizen and a miserable souldiour briefelye touchinge the commodyties and discommodyties bothe of warre and peace' (1578). The work was entered in the Stationers' register, licensed to Richard Jones, on 7 November 1578, but no copies are known to have survived. 
Warren is also the author of 'A pleasant new fancie of a fondlings device, intitled and cald the nurcerie of names, wherein is presented (to the order of our alphabet) the brandishing brightnes of our English gentlewomen' (1581). The prefatory matter of the volume consists of some short Latin poems and a euphuistic 'Proaeme to the Gentleman Readers', signed 'W. Warren, Gent.', as well as an 'Address to the Gentlewomen of England'. In the latter Warren speaks of himself as 'your poor Poet and your olde friend'. The body of the work consists of extravagant poems, in fourteen-syllable verse, on women's names. The poem on Elizabeth is an excellent example of the contemporary style of compliment to the queen. Nothing is known of Warren's life. It is possible that he may have been one of the two William Warrens recorded as having matriculated at Oxford University in the 1570s, but this is purely speculative.

Warter, John Wood (1806-1878), Church of England clergyman and antiquary, born on 21 January 1806 in Cruck Meole, Shropshire, was the eldest son of Henry de Grey Warter (1770-1853) of Cruck Meole, who married, on 19 March 1805, Emma Sarah Moore (died 1863), daughter of William Wood of Marsh Hall and Hanwood, Shropshire. Upon leaving Shrewsbury School (under Samuel Butler) Warter matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1824, and graduated BA with third-class honours in classics in 1828, MA in 1834, and BD in 1841. In 1830 he published a translation of the 'Acharnians', 'Knights', 'Wasps', and 'Birds' of Aristophanes. 
Warter was a close friend of Robert Southey, whose eldest surviving daughter, Edith May Southey (1804-1871), he married at Keswick on 15 January 1834. Many letters from Southey to him, beginning on 18 March 1830, are in the sixth volume of 'Southey's Life and Correspondence'. Ordained in 1830, Warter was from 1830 to 1833 chaplain to the British embassy at Copenhagen, and became an honorary member of the Scandinavian and Icelandic literary societies. During these years he travelled through Norway and Sweden, was closely acquainted with the leading scholars of northern Europe, including Professor Rasmus Rask, and was supplied with books from the royal library of Denmark. By this means he became an expert in 'Danish and Swedish lore, and in the exquisitely curious Icelandic sagas', and read 'German literature of all sorts, especially theological'. In 1834, just before his marriage, he had been appointed by the archbishop of Canterbury to the vicarage of West Tarring and Durrington, Sussex, a peculiar of the archbishopric, to which the chapelries of Heene and Patching were then annexed. He remained the vicar of West Tarring from 1834 until his death. For some years to 31 December 1851 he was the rural dean. 
From the date of his appointment to this benefice he devoted his leisure 'to the pleasant task of rescuing from oblivion every fact that had the remotest bearing upon the history of Tarring' (D. G. C. Elwes and C. J. Robinson, 'A History of the Castles, Mansions, and Manors of Western Sussex', 1876, 231). The result was the publication of a valuable antiquarian work, 'Appendicia et pertinentiae: parochial fragments on the parish of West Tarring and the chapelries of Heene and Durrington' (1853), and 'The Seaboard and the Down, or, My Parish in the South, by an Old Vicar' (2 vols., 1860), describing the social life of the parish's inhabitants. Selections from Warter's collections on the history of his native Shropshire appeared in 'An Old Shropshire Oak', edited by Richard Garnett (4 vols., 1886-91). These books displayed his wide reading. 
Warter died at his vicarage on 21 February 1878, and was buried with his wife in West Tarring churchyard (the epitaphs are printed in 'Notes and Queries' (6th ser., 7, 1883, 306, 517). Their second son, John Southey Warter (1840-1866), was a physician. 
Warter was an old-fashioned churchman of the 'high and dry' school, and was frequently in dispute with the ecclesiastical commissioners. He published many tracts and sermons, which reflected his orthodox divinity. Although most of his works concerned religious and antiquarian topics, his greatest service to scholarship has been held to be his collection of material relating to Robert Southey ('Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey', 505-6). Warter edited volumes 6 and 7 of Southey's 'Doctor' and an edition in one volume of the whole work (1848). He also edited Southey's 'Commonplace Book' in four volumes (1849-51), and four volumes of 'Selections from Southey's Letters' (1856). A fierce review of the latter work by Whitwell Elwin appeared in the 'Quarterly Review', March 1856, 456-501. It was probably provoked by Warter's statement that he could draw up 'a most remarkable history' of that periodical, following a dispute over the use of Southey's letters to Lockhart and Murray. Edith Warter had begun in 1824 and continued for some time a collection of sayings. It was taken up by her husband and finally published in 1861 as 'Wise Saws and Modern Instances: Pithy Sentences in Many Languages'. Warter also contributed to the 'English Review'.

Warton, Joseph (bap. 1722, d. 1800), poet and literary critic, elder son of Thomas Warton (1688-1745), clergyman and poet, and his wife, Elizabeth Richardson (1691-1762), was born at Dunsfold, Surrey, and baptized there on 22 April 1722, at the vicarage of his grandfather Joseph Richardson. His younger brother, Thomas Warton, was also a poet and historian of English poetry, while his sister Jane Warton contributed (at Joseph's request) to Samuel Johnson's 'Adventurer' and wrote a novel and a two-volume book of advice for young ladies. His early education was at the grammar school in Basingstoke where his father was headmaster, and Gilbert White a fellow pupil. On 2 August 1736 he was elected a scholar of Winchester College (although he was probably there earlier) and began a near lifelong association with it; from there he published his first poem, 'Sappho's Advice', in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' (1st ser., 9, October 1739, 545). Warton matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 16 January 1740 but did not take up residence until the following September. While at Oxford Warton published his first major piece of poetry: 'Fashion: an Epistolary Satire to a Friend' (1742). 
Warton graduated BA on 13 March 1744, the year when his most important piece of poetic work, 'The Enthusiast, or, The Lover of Nature', was published. According to Warton's publisher Robert Dodsley the work was written in 1740 ('A Collection of Poems in Six Volumes', 1782, 3.104), and certainly it is just such a poem as an undergraduate or recent graduate would write, full of love of nature and feeling, going against the prevailing taste for poetry epitomized by Alexander Pope. It was warmly received and Warton revised and enlarged it for inclusion in later editions of Dodsley's 'Collection of Poems'. 
Upon leaving Oxford, Warton took holy orders and became his father's curate in Basingstoke until he received the charge of Chelsea in February 1746. But after a disagreement with some parishioners and a bout of smallpox he left Chelsea and took the curacies of Droxford and Chawton in Hampshire. During this time he published a number of poems in Dodsley's 'Museum' and in 1746 contemplated a project with William Collins to publish their odes together. The project never materialized as Dodsley refused Collins's poems, but he published Warton's 'Odes on Various Subjects' in 1746. The 'Ode to Fancy' became something of a contemporary favourite. In 1754 a writer in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' (1st ser., 24, 592) felt that 'Fancy' was proof that Warton 'ought not to be confined to the drudgery of translation' and William Shenstone considered it the best of the odes inspired by Milton's 'Il penseroso'. 
In the second edition of the 'Odes' is a poem by Thomas Warton the younger. The process of borrowing from and revising each other's work, begun in the 'Odes', was carried on and enlarged while the brothers were editing their father's poems. Thomas Warton the elder died on 10 September 1745, and to obtain money Joseph proposed putting together a number of his father's poems and selling them by subscription. The volume, 'Poems on Several Occasions, by the Reverend Mr. Thomas Warton', did not, however, include poems only by their father. Both Thomas and Joseph contributed to it in their father's name and in many cases they (particularly Joseph) heavily edited many of the remaining poems. 
On 21 September 1747 Warton married Mary Daman (died 1772), with whom he eventually had six children. In the next year Charles Paulet, third duke of Bolton, granted the living of Winslade to Warton and he continued his literary career with 'Ranelagh House: a Satire in Prose: in the Manner of Monsieur Le Sage'. Three years later Warton made his only trip to the continent when he accompanied the duke, who was travelling with his mistress, Lavinia Fenton, universally known as Polly Peachum for the role she had made famous in Gay's 'Beggar's Opera'. The duke needed a member of the clergy to marry him to Miss Fenton should the duchess's expected death occur while he was on the continent. However, Warton left the duke's party before the duchess's death and returned home without performing the ceremony. The experience did provide him with the subject for another poem, 'Verses Written at Montaubon' ('London Magazine', 24, April 1755, 183-4). 
Warton continued his literary endeavours as he worked on a translation of Virgil which was published (in both Latin and English) in four volumes in 1753. Although using Christopher Pitt's translation of the 'Aeneid', he himself translated the 'Eclogues' and the 'Georgics'. About this time he made the friendship of Johnson who invited him to contribute to 'The Adventurer', Warton eventually writing nineteen or twenty of the papers signed 'Z', including five on Shakespeare. 
In 1754 Warton became rector of Tunworth, but despairing of further advancement in the church accepted the position of usher, or second master, at his old school, Winchester, on 3 December 1755. Here he remained until his retirement in 1793, becoming headmaster in 1766. On 23 June 1759 Oxford conferred upon him the degree of MA by diploma. On 15 January 1768 he proceeded at Oxford to the degrees of BD and DD. 
Warton's major contribution to scholarship was 'An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope' (1756; second volume, 1782; in subsequent editions the title was 'Genius and Writings'). As Pope had died only twelve years earlier, it was anticipated that the work might arouse some controversy so it was published anonymously and Dodsley's name did not appear on the title-page until the second issue of the second edition (merely a reprinting of the title-page of the second edition) in 1762. The dedication to Edward Young acts somewhat as a manifesto for Warton's views. He writes in the dedication: 'No love of singularity, no affection of paradoxical opinions, gave rise to the following work. I revere the memory of Pope, I respect and honour his abilities; but I do not think him at the head of his profession. In other words, in that species of poetry wherein Pope excelled, he is superior to all mankind: and I only say, that this species of poetry is not the most excellent one of the art. (pp. iii-iv)' Warton divided poets into four classes. Into the first, those who are 'sublime and pathetic', he placed Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton (and curiously 'at proper intervals, Otway and Lee'). In the second class were poets who 'possessed the true poetical genius, in a more moderate degree, but had noble talents for moral and ethical poesy'. The third class were 'men of wit, of elegant taste and some fancy in describing familiar life'. The fourth class were 'mere versifiers, however smooth and mellifluous some of them may be thought' (pp. xi-xii). Warton, whose name did not appear on the title-page until the posthumous edition of 1806, placed Pope at the head of the second class of poets. The work was favourably reviewed by Johnson and went into several reprints. It also aroused some opposition -- most notably from Owen Ruffhead ('The Life of Alexander Pope', 1769), and Percival Stockdale ('An Enquiry into the Nature and Genuine Laws of Poetry', 1778). But most critics seemed to agree with the review in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' which described the 'Essay' as 'a most interesting and useful miscellany of literary knowledge and candid criticism containing censure without acrimony, and praise without flattery'. Johnson, writing in the 'Literary Magazine', called it 'a just specimen of literary moderation'. Later, in the 'Lives of the Poets' where Johnson criticized the 'Essay' and defended Pope more explicitly than he had done earlier, he still said of the 'Essay' that it is 'a book which teaches how the brow of Criticism may be smoothed, and how she may be enabled, with all her severity, to attract and to delight'. 
Warton's personality and effusive nature were well known among his friends: 'But it was a particular Felicity to meet Jo: Warton at Oxford, we had a great Joy in the meeting; He is the same ardent Creature he always was, and when we parted it had like to have cost me the Bone-setting of my right Hand. (R. Holt-White, 'Life and Letters of Gilbert White', 1901, 1 June 1757, I.121)' In June 1785 Hannah More found him 'as usual, very enthusiastic and very agreeable' and later labelled him 'that delightful enthusiast' (W. Roberts, 'Memoirs of Hannah More', 1835). 
While Warton's 'enthusiasm' was popular with many, it was not with Johnson, who called Warton 'an enthusiast by rule', although there seems to have been a close friendship between them earlier. Wooll claims an incident at Sir Joshua Reynolds's house was the cause of the coolness between them. Apparently a dispute arose to which Wooll has recorded the conclusion: '
Johnson: 'Sir, I am not used to be[ing] contradicted.' 

Warton: 'Better for yourself and your friends, Sir, if you were; our admiration could not be increased, but our love might.' 
(Wooll, 98n.)' Wooll does not give a date to this incident but some change in the relationship had occurred by 22 January 1766 when Warton wrote to his brother: 'I only dined with Johnson, who seemed cold and indifferent, and scarce said any thing to me; perhaps he has heard what I said of his Shakespeare, or rather was offended at what I wrote to him -- as he pleases.' It was probably a difference of personal style which caused the friendship to fade. Johnson, for all his reputation for gruffness, was, nevertheless, 'heard to lament, with tears in his eyes, that the Wartons had not called upon him for the last four years' (Boswell, 'Life', 1.270, n.1). And he wrote to Warton concerning Charles Burney's youngest son, Richard, and accompanied the boy and his father to Winchester. 
Perhaps Warton's comments on Johnson in his edition of Dryden came closest to the truth about Warton's attitude: 'A love of paradox and contradiction, at the bottom of which was vanity, gave an unpleasant tincture to his manners, and made his conversation boisterous and offensive. I often used to tell the mild and sensible Sir Joshua Reynolds, that he and his friends had contributed to spoil Johnson, by constantly and cowardly assenting to all he advanced on any subject. Mr. Burke only kept him in order, as did Mr. Beauclerc, sometimes by his playful wit. It was a great pleasure for Beauclerc to lay traps for him to induce him to oppose and contradict one day what he had maintained on a former. (p. 151n.)' While at Winchester, Warton corresponded with Walpole, Gibbon, Burney, Colman, Malone, Percy, Spence, and John Wilkes, as well as with numerous minor writers and booksellers. And he kept up his correspondence with his old friends Reynolds, Garrick, and Johnson. Walpole sent him the gift of 'The Castle of Otranto'. Gerald Hamilton thanked him for recommending to him an unknown secretary named Edmund Burke. Reynolds proposed Warton's name for membership of the Literary Club on 10 January 1777 and he attended his first meeting one week later. He was used as an intermediary when John Oglander, warden of New College, Oxford, wanted Reynolds to design a window for the ante-chapel at the college. The king visited Winchester College and heard a speech written by Warton, who was given a new living (Thorley in Hertfordshire) and a prebend in St Paul's (1782). His literary work consisted of the second volume of his 'Essay on Pope' (1782) and a combined edition of two famous works of literary criticism, 'Sir Philip Sydney's defence of poetry and observations on poetry and eloquence, from the Discoveries of Ben Jonson' (1787). 
The time was not without its sadder moments. Warton's mother died in April 1762 and his ten-year-old daughter, Ann, died after being inoculated against smallpox. The loss of his wife in October 1772 was a severe blow. She was universally liked and admired, and seems to have played no small part in Warton's success at Winchester. On 18 December 1773 he married Charlotte Nicholas ('c'.1742-1809), a descendant of a former warden of Winchester College. They had one child, Harriet Elizabeth. His daughter Molly married Colonel James Morgan in December 1774 and left with her husband soon after to spend ten years in India. Joseph's son Thomas, who was in holy orders, died in his father's study after college prayers in 1787, and his brother Thomas died at Trinity College, Oxford, in May 1790. Warton's other sons, Joseph ('b'. 1750) and John ('b'. 1756), also took holy orders. 
Nevertheless the Winchester years were generally happy, as evinced by the letters. Poets and writers who attended the school wrote back to Warton and he took delight in receiving their works. He usually managed to spend Christmas in London visiting friends and attending the theatre. Bishop Lowth, a friend, appointed him prebendary of London in 1782, and presented to him the vicarage of Chorley, Hertfordshire, which he exchanged for that of Wickham, in Hampshire. And William Pitt, the prime minister, conferred on him a prebendal stall at Winchester in 1788. In 1790 Warton was presented with the rectory of Easton in Hampshire which he exchanged for Upham in the same county. The livings of Upham and Wickham he held for life and retired to Wickham after his resignation at Winchester in 1793. 
Although Warton's letters indicate that he had been long contemplating retirement, it was the boys' rebellion in 1793 which occasioned it. Warton's role in this insurrection, and the minor one of 1774, has been misinterpreted. He has been accused of being a lax disciplinarian and his 'enthusiastic' character perhaps did not lend itself to the kind of authoritarian rule which the Victorians later expected from their schoolmasters. There is, however, another reason for the accusation and the understanding of it goes back to the insurrection of 1774. The incident for which it is mostly remembered concerns the boys' hissing of Warton and his retort: 'So, gentlemen; What? Are you metamorphosed into serpents!' Warton had stopped the boys from mimicking a hunchbacked servant. It was this imposition of discipline which brought forth the real demands of the boys, namely that the assistant master, George Isaac Huntingford, be dismissed. 
The rebellion of 1793 was far more serious and it involved more than just the commoners. And again Huntingford played an important part. He had been appointed warden in 1789 and in 1793 had declared the Close out of bounds for the boys. When one boy was found there he punished the whole school, causing a general disturbance which was quieted only after he promised a general amnesty, which he broke once order was restored. The boys had agreed that if any were punished all would leave the college and this they did. Warton's role in the rebellion was minor. As headmaster he was nominally responsible. However, his only role in the affair seems to have been that of messenger between the boys and Huntingford as he was the only member of the governing body the boys trusted. No doubt Warton was not a strict disciplinarian in the mould of Huntingford, but it seems that his responsibility for the student rebellions in both 1774 and 1793 has been greatly exaggerated. 
The years after Warton's resignation, spent in Wickham, were devoted to literary pursuits. An edition of Pope, originally proposed to him by John Wilkes in 1792, was finally published in 1797. In it he incorporated, as notes, much of his 'Essay', a move for which he was criticized. He also used the opportunity to 'give hard blows to the marvellous absurdities of Warburton' and to attack Johnson for his life of Pope -- and perhaps also for Boswell's portrayal of Warton. Indeed, many of the comments in the notes are aimed directly at Warburton and Johnson. This caused another controversy involving Warton's former pupil, the poet William Lisle Bowles, who published a poorly edited version of Pope's works in which he acted, somewhat condescendingly, as a judge between Warton, Johnson, and Warburton. Warton did not live to see the edition, as it appeared in 1806. Towards the end of his life he began work on an edition of Dryden which was completed by his son John. Warton died on 23 February 1800 and was buried in Winchester Cathedral. 
Warton's poetry, with a few exceptions, is undistinguished, and typical of the mid-century. He is best remembered, and rightly so, as a critic, the first to reassess Pope. He was also a friend of the great and near great and, as with many schoolteachers, had an influence far beyond his immediate circle.

Warton, Robert (d. 1557), bishop of Hereford, is of obscure origins. He composed his will as Robert Perfey and made bequests in it to a brother, a sister, and several kinsfolk with the same surname. But he is first recorded on 1 September 1525 as Robert Warton, a Cluniac monk who was chosen as his successor by the retiring prior of Bermondsey. In the same year Warton is said to have taken the degree of BTh at Cambridge, and he may also have studied at Gloucester College, Oxford. In the Canterbury convocations of 1533 and 1534 he supported the king against papal authority, which makes it less surprising that on 8 June 1536 he should have been elected bishop of St Asaph. The royal assent was given on 24 June, he was consecrated by Archbishop Cranmer eight days later, and the temporalities were restored on 21 July. The see was extremely poor, and Warton retained his abbacy 'in commendam'. When Bermondsey was dissolved at the beginning of 1538, Warton received the substantial pension of $333 6's'. 8died, no doubt to enable him to fulfil his episcopal duties. 
Warton's predecessor as bishop had been the committed evangelical William Barlow, but Barlow was not at St Asaph for long enough to make much impact on the legacy of the conservative Henry Standish, who held the see from 1518 to 1535. Warton seems to have begun his episcopate by taking a reformist line, expelling a priest from the diocese 'for not rasing the bishop of Rome's name and other crimes' ('LP Henry VIII', 10, no. 446), but his commitment to reform soon faltered. He appears to have been more interested in administration than doctrine, securing the support of a number of suffragans and recommending the removal of his see first to Wrexham and then to Denbigh, where he also showed a concern for education by proposing the establishment of a grammar school. Warton also had to contend with the rapacity of the locally powerful Salisbury family. Later allegations that he impoverished his see by making long leases of all its lands are probably exaggerated, but his recorded leases include one to Richard Salisbury for sixty years and one to the younger John Salisbury for eighty. 
Although Warton certainly visited his diocese, staying at Denbigh or Wrexham rather than St Asaph, he was frequently employed outside it. He attended important court events like the baptism of Prince Edward and the funeral of Queen Jane Seymour in 1537, and the marriage of Henry VIII to Anne of Cleves in 1540. In 1537 he was a signatory to the 'Bishops' Book', and two years later was consulted about the 'Act of Six Articles'. He several times attended parliament in the 1540s. Meanwhile he retained an interest in Surrey, as a JP and property-owner -- in 1542 he was licensed to acquire nine messuages in Bermondsey. By 1542 Warton was also coming to be employed in the secular government of Wales and its marches. In that year he was made a JP for Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, and he was later named to the peace commissions for Shropshire, Herefordshire, Chester, and Staffordshire, while on 22 April 1543 he was appointed to the council in the marches of Wales. 
Following the death of Henry VIII, Warton accommodated himself without difficulty to the governments of the dukes of Somerset and Northumberland. In 1547 he voted in favour of holy communion being administered in both kinds, and seems to have supported the 'Book of Common Prayer' of 1549. In April 1551 he was again named to the council in the marches of Wales. But following the death of Edward VI he found it equally easy to adapt to a more conservative religious regime. Appointed on 13 March 1554 to the commission to deprive Archbishop Holgate and four other bishops, he was formally absolved of error and schism by Cardinal Pole on the 17th, and nominated on the same day for translation to the see of Hereford; he was enthroned on 9 May. Little can be said of his second episcopate, except that he acted as the government required to deprive married clergy. 
In his will, which he drew up on 30 June 1555, Warton showed his concern for his cathedral by leaving to it his mitre, crozier, and a number of fine vestments, and making bequests to all the prebendaries, vicars-choral, choristers, and officers who should be present at his funeral mass. He also remembered his chaplains, household servants, and numerous kinsmen, making individual cash bequests totalling over $450. $20 were to be distributed to the poor at his burial, another $20 at his month's mind. His bequest of his soul, to the glorious Trinity, was surprisingly lacking in specifically Catholic commitment for a Marian bishop, but it is probably significant that his nephew John Perfey, whom he named as his executor, later fled overseas to escape the Elizabethan settlement. Warton died on 22 September 1557. Little remains of his monumental effigy in the north-east transept of Hereford Cathedral, and he may be more worthily commemorated by an embroidered orphrey bearing his arms which survives at St Michael's Church, Abergavenny.

Warton, Thomas (1688-1745), Church of England clergyman and poet, was born in 1688 in Godalming, Surrey, where he was baptized on 3 February 1688, the son of the Revd Anthony Warton (1650-1715), and his wife, Mary. He matriculated from Hart Hall, Oxford, on 9 April 1706, but shortly after migrated to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a demy from 1706 to 1717, and a fellow from 1717 to 1724. He proceeded BA (1710), MA (1712), BD (1725), and was elected professor of poetry in succession to Joseph Trapp on 17 July 1718, a post he held until 1728, having been re-elected in July 1723 for a second five-year term. He is chiefly remembered at Oxford for his Jacobite sympathies, engendered initially when he circulated a number of his poems -- most notably 'The Turnip Hoer', a satire on George I's suggestion of turning St James's Park into a turnip patch. His boldest act, however, was delivering a Jacobite sermon on 29 May 1719 at the university church. In it he spoke of the evil in dethroning a rightful king and setting up a usurper. Even though the sermon used Charles I and Cromwell as reference points, George I and the Stuart Pretender were clearly intended and taken as such by the audience who waved their caps as Warton left the church and 'his health was the toast of the night' ('Remarks', 7.15). 
On 2 February 1721 Warton married Elizabeth (1691-1762), second daughter of the Revd Joseph Richardson, rector of Dunsfold, Surrey, and Elizabeth Peebles. In 1723 when Magdalen College presented Warton with the living of Basingstoke in Hampshire, he left Oxford for Basingstoke where he also became master of the grammar school. Among his pupils was the naturalist Gilbert White. He remained at Basingstoke until his death and held successively with the living the vicarages of Framfield, Sussex (1726), Woking, Surrey (1727-30), and Chobham, Surrey (1730-45). Two of Warton's children were born in Basingstoke: Jane Warton in 1724 and Thomas Warton in 1728, while Joseph Warton was baptized at Dunsfold, Surrey, in 1722. In 1738 Warton was elected to a lectureship in Basingstoke that had been established for the 'maintenance of a good and learned preacher', who was to 'instruct the people in the principles of religion' (Baigent and Millard, 403). The honorarium was $50. Warton was a friend of Elijah Fenton, Edward Young, and was introduced to Alexander Pope, to whom he gave his copy of 'Gorboduc', by Pope's friend the Hon. Robert Digby. 
Warton died at Basingstoke on 10 September 1745 and was buried in Basingstoke church. A memorial erected in the church by his family was displaced during renovations and a new memorial was subsequently erected by Victorian descendants of Joseph Warton. As a way of paying off the debts owed by his father at his death, Joseph Warton proposed publishing a volume of his father's poems by subscription. This volume, 'Poems on Several Occasions', appeared in March 1748 and increased Warton's reputation as a poet. It was subsequently praised as a transitional volume containing poems typical of the early part of the century and some which appeared to anticipate later poets. However, modern scholarship has determined that many of the poems previously thought to be somewhat forward reaching were, in fact, written by Warton's sons, Joseph and Thomas, or heavily edited by them.

Warton, Thomas (1728-1790), poet and historian, was born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 9 January 1728, and baptized there on the 25th. He was the younger son of Thomas Warton (1688-1745), vicar of Basingstoke, and Elizabeth (1691-1762), daughter of Joseph Richardson, rector of Dunsfold, Surrey, and younger brother of Joseph Warton and Jane Warton. Warton was educated at home by his father until 16 March 1744, when he entered Trinity College, Oxford, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He graduated BA (1747) and MA (1750), and was elected a probationary fellow of Trinity on 25 May 1752 and perpetual fellow on 6 June 1753. 
Warton's poetic career began while he was an undergraduate at Trinity. 'Five Pastoral Eclogues' was published anonymously by Dodsley in 1745. His first poem for Dodsley's 'Museum', 'Inscription in a Grotto', appeared on 11 October 1746. In April 1747 Dodsley published Warton's first major poem, 'The Pleasures of Melancholy' (although the poem had been written two years earlier). When Joseph Warton published his 'Odes on Various Subjects' (1746) the volume contained two poems by Thomas, 'To a Fountain' and 'To a Gentleman upon his Travels thro' Italy'. This borrowing early illustrated the brothers' practice of helping each other with their work, a practice which culminated in 1748 when Thomas Warton the elder's 'Poems on Several Occasions' was published. Thomas Warton the elder had died on 10 September 1745 and, in an attempt to raise money to cover debts which he had left, Joseph suggested putting together a volume of their father's poems and selling them by subscription. Both sons, however, contributed poems (anonymously) and both edited heavily (Joseph particularly) many of the remaining poems by Thomas Warton the elder. The volume, which many considered to be indicative of the nature and style of poetry to come, established a reputation for Thomas Warton the elder which was undeserved. All the forward-reaching poems were by the brothers. Thomas Warton changed style and adumbrated a different aspect of his later work when he published 'Newmarket, a Satire' (1751), and contributed to (under the pseudonym of 'a Gentleman from Aberdeen') and edited 'The Union, or, Select Scots and English Poems' (1753), a miscellany containing works by William Collins, Thomas Gray, Warton's brother Joseph, Mark Akenside, and Samuel Johnson. 
As early as June 1753 Warton committed himself to writing a critical work on Spenser. 'Observations on the 'Fairy Queen' of Spenser' was published by Dodsley in March 1754 and was well received. 'You have shown', Johnson wrote to Warton on 16 July 1754, 'to all who shall hereafter attempt the study of our ancient authours the way to success, by directing them to the perusal of the books which those authours had read' (Oxford, Trinity College, archives). The work was not universally admired. William Huggins took exception to what Warton said about Ariosto and published (anonymously) 'The Observer Observ'd, or, Remarks on... Observations of the 'Faerie Queene' of Spenser' (1756). But this was the exception. In the second edition (2 vols., 1762) Warton added commentaries on Gothic architecture, medieval poets, and romances, and on the historical method of criticizing Spenser. The quality and influence of the work was such that a critic in 1911 called it 'the best book ever written about Spenser' (H. E. Cory, 'The Critics of Spenser', 1911). 
As a response to William Mason's poem 'Isis: an Elegy' (1749) Warton published 'The Triumph of Isis' (1750), a poem praising Oxford's architecture, graduates, and history. The poem soon went into three editions and gained for the young author some early fame and status in the university. For the Encaenia of July 1751 Warton wrote an ode which William Hayes set to music. 
While he was a serious scholar and poet, there was another side to Warton, that of the humorist and satirist. Early on in his time at Trinity he had been elected laureate of the bachelors' common room and in this role had written 'Verses on Miss C -- s [Cotes] and Miss W -- t [Wilmot]', published anonymously in July 1749 but written previously as separate poems. He further illustrated this aspect of his personality with 'A Panegyric on Oxford Ale' and 'The Pleasures of being out of Debt' which appeared on 31 March 1750 in 'The Student', an Oxford miscellany that appeared between 31 January 1750 and 3 July 1751. Both of these poems seem to have been inspired by personal experience. Warton published various other pieces of this ilk, including a number in 'Jackson's Oxford Journal', where he contributed 'The Oxford Newsman's Verses, 1760', and where he also wrote the annual verses for 1767, 1768, 1770, and 1771. In addition Warton wrote further items for 'The Student'. His satire on Oxford guidebooks, 'A companion to the guide and a guide to the companion, being a complete supplement to all the accounts of Oxford hitherto published', appeared in 1760. Feeling a need to collect works by Oxford wits, Warton also contributed to and edited (anonymously) the amusing 'The Oxford Sausage, or, Select Poetical Pieces Written by the Most Celebrated Wits of the University of Oxford' (1764). 
Although much of Warton's writing about Oxford was satiric and humorous, he did write a number of more scholarly works on the subject, most notably biographies of men associated with Trinity College: Ralph Bathurst, a president of Trinity who was responsible for increasing the college's reputation and the building of the college chapel, and Sir Thomas Pope, the founder of the college, the latter piece originating in an article Warton wrote for 'Biographia Britannica' (1760). In 1757 Warton was unanimously elected professor of poetry at Oxford, a post he held for two successive terms of five years each. Only one of his lectures, 'De poesi Graecorum bucolica', was printed and this was included in Warton's edition of Theocritus (1770). He did, though, publish other such works, including metrical inscriptions in Latin, 'Inscriptionum Romanarum metricarum delectus' (1758) and similar inscriptions in Greek (with a Latin preface), 'Anthologae Graecae' (1766). 
Some time in the early 1750s Warton met Samuel Johnson, probably through his brother Joseph, and in 1754 Johnson stayed at Kettell Hall, Trinity College. He and Warton visited some local ruins and Warton introduced Johnson to a number of his friends, including Francis Wise, the Radclivian librarian. Altogether Warton and Johnson spent five weeks together and developed a lifelong friendship. Subsequently Warton helped in the campaign to get an MA degree for Johnson. The friendship stayed relatively strong until Johnson's death; there were however periods of coolness, perhaps resulting from Johnson's mockery of Warton's poetry, although hints of the coolness and its causes can be seen much earlier. Thomas wrote to Joseph in April 1755 about Johnson's dictionary: 'you may plainly perceive strokes of laxity and indolence. They are two most unwieldy volumes... I fear his preface will disgust, by the expression of consciousness of superiority, and of his contempt of patronage' (Wooll, 230-31). Johnson was aware of Warton's feelings. 'Professors forget their friends', he wrote to Warton, partially as a tease in reference to Warton's new professorship, but partially it seems from a sense that it was true (21 June 1757, Oxford, Trinity College, archives). Johnson asked Warton to provide some notes for his Shakespeare and nineteen of these appeared in the appendix to the 1765 edition. Forty-nine appeared in the Oxford edition of 1770-71. Later editors, including Steevens and Malone, used these notes in their editions. However, Warton was unhappy with Johnson's 'Lives' where Johnson criticized Milton and Gray and the tradition of historical criticism which Warton stood for. 
On 7 December 1767 Warton took the degree of BD. In 1771 he was elected a fellow of the London Society of Antiquaries, and that year he was appointed to the small living of Kiddington, Oxfordshire; he later wrote a history of the parish. After his brother was appointed usher (assistant master) at Winchester College, and especially after Joseph became headmaster in 1766, Warton spent time there each year, studying the landscape and enjoying rambles to various local attractions. His sense of humour displayed itself often when he joined in pranks with the schoolboys (occasionally writing their exercises with just enough errors to avoid suspicion), behaviour which some thought rather below an Oxford don. 
Warton probably started thinking in the early 1750s about what was to become his greatest project, but the serious writing of 'The history of English poetry, from the close of the eleventh to the commencement of the eighteenth century' did not begin until 1769. Volume 1 appeared in 1774; volume 2 in 1778, and volume 3 in 1781. Warton decided on a chronological method in looking at the history of poetry. The work is, at times, obscure, and turgid. Warton's lists of manuscripts, his digressions, and his frequent quotations from long-lost poets often make the reading of the 'History' heavy going. However, many of these quotations provided readers with the only accessible text of the poems and as such proved invaluable in creating an interest in the poetry of the past. Most contemporaries had great respect for the 'History', but not all. Joseph Ritson published a rather eccentric criticism of the work in 1782. His 'Observations of the First Three Volumes of the 'History of English Poetry'' points out many errors of fact, misinterpretations, and other 'falsehoods'. But Ritson's views were in the minority. Most agreed with the writer in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' who wrote, commenting on volume 3: 'This volume, like the former, does equal credit to Mr. Warton's taste, judgment, and erudition, and makes us impatiently desirous of more' ('GM', 1st ser., 51, 1781, 230). The 'more' never appeared although Warton did begin work on volume 4. Why volume 4 never appeared has not been determined. It may be because at this time Warton became interested in producing an edition of Milton, but a comment by Samuel Deane in 1794 may provide a more accurate reason and also some insight into Warton's personality: 'Often have I regretted that the late Mr. Warton was too indolent to complete his proposed 'History'... I have always understood that he wanted a spur to take pen in hand' (Nicholls, 'Illustrations', 6.633-4). Although by later standards of accuracy and inclusion the work would be considered unacceptable, it really is remarkable considering the time of its creation and the materials Warton had to work with. And the 'History' has had far-reaching effects. Early in the next century Sir Walter Scott called it an 'immense commonplace book... from the perusal of which we rise, our fancy delighted with beautiful imagery, and with the happy analysis of ancient tale and song' ('Edinburgh Review', 7 April 1804, 153). The 'History', despite its density and its digressions, cleared the way for later historians and gave legitimacy both to the study of early English poetry and to the historical method of doing so. 
In 1777 Thomas Tyrwhitt's edition of the poems of Thomas Rowley began a controversy which, because of its concern with the authenticity of poems allegedly from the fifteenth century, naturally drew in the historian of English poetry. Initially Warton had felt that the poems were spurious and said so in a letter to Percy (25 January 1776) 'I owe, I lean to the side of the forgery' (BL, Add. MS 32329, fols. 83-4). In his 'History' (2.139-64) Warton concluded, after examining internal evidence, spelling, and diction, that the poems were not from the fifteenth century. 'It is with regret that I find myself obligated to pronounce the Rowlie poems to be spurious' (2.164). He enlarged on this opinion later in 'An Enquiry into the Authenticity of the Poems Attributed to Thomas Rowley' (1782). In this he admitted that he had made some errors in the 'History', but he concluded, firmly and convincingly, that the poems were forgeries; his opinion was taken as the final word and as accurate, and was corroborated by W. W. Skeat's edition of Chatterton which appeared in 1871. 
In 1785 Warton issued an edition of Milton's shorter poems which received praises in the 'Critical Review', the 'Monthly Review', and the 'Gentleman's Magazine'. Warton contemplated a second edition which was to include 'Paradise Regained' and 'Samson Agonistes' and by 1789 had revised the 1785 edition with hopes that volume 2 would be out by April 1790. All the notes for the second volume were lost after Warton's death, so that all that appeared was the revised edition of volume 1 in 1791. The edition is considered by many to be the best eighteenth-century edition of Milton and some of Warton's comments give an indication of his beliefs. He censured Milton for his politics and believed that Milton lost his sight and wasted his poetic genius working for the parliamentary cause. It is nevertheless clear that Warton admired Milton's work, even to the point of defending him against the strictures of his old friend Johnson. In a letter to Richard Hurd after Johnson's death, Warton says that Milton 'has been depreciated by Dr. Johnson, a specious and popular writer, without taste' (6 April 1785, Hartlebury Castle, Hurd Library, bound MSS V, Warton 9). 
Although he had spent much of his time writing criticism, Warton continued to write poetry and his first volume of collected poems was published in 1777. The volume was quite popular and went into a number of editions. Warton's 'Verses on Sir Joshua Reynolds's Painted Window at New College' (1782) was much admired by Reynolds and other contemporaries. Warton the poet reflected the many facets of Warton the man. Many of his poems, especially 'The Pleasures of Melancholy', show the influence of Milton, while many others demonstrate Warton's love of nature ('The First of April', 'On the Approach of Summer') and of the past ('The Grave of King Arthur'). His revival of the sonnet form was particularly important and had a lasting effect, while his satire and humorous pieces may still be read with pleasure. His poetry, written over many years, is some of the best of the period 1745-90. He had a particular influence over a number of old Wykehamists who studied at Trinity College. William Lisle Bowles, Henry Headley, and Thomas Russell all became poets after the Warton fashion. Bowles in particular was influenced by Warton and his 1789 volume of sonnets had in turn a great influence on Coleridge, Southey, and Wordsworth (S. T. Coleridge, 'Biographia literaria', 1817, chap. 1). Southey commented in 1825: 'If any man may be called the father of the present race, it is Thomas Warton' ('Quarterly Review', 31, 1824-5, 289). 
Largely through the influence and intercession of Reynolds, Warton was made poet laureate upon the death of William Whitehead in 1785. Warton's first official poem as laureate, an ode on the king's birthday, was somewhat hurried and perhaps his weakest work as laureate, and occasioned a satirical look at the laureateship, the 'Probationary Odes'. This was a volume of poems written by a number of supposed candidates for the laureateship. As part of the satire, included in the volume were actual poems by Warton. He nevertheless took the incident in good part and did not feel any rancour towards the perpetrators, allegedly Richard Tickell and Joseph Richardson. 
On 5 March 1782 Warton was admitted into the Literary Club, and although it is not certain how many meetings he was able to attend in London, he was a popular, and respected, member. He had, however, already known and corresponded with many of the members including Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Percy, and Edmond Malone. In 1785 Warton was elected Camden professor of history at Oxford; his inaugural lecture was printed by his biographer, Richard Mant. During his lifetime Warton held a number of preferments after being ordained a priest on 10 March 1754. On 27 April 1755 he became curate of Woodstock, Oxfordshire, a post he held until 3 April 1774. He was appointed chaplain to the Royal Lancashire regiment, stationed in Winchester, on 24 July 1762. Lord Lichfield gave him the living of Kiddington, Oxfordshire, in October 1771, and Trinity College gave him the perpetual curacy of Hill Farrance, Somerset, in August 1782. 
Warton generally enjoyed good health, but gout forced him to spend some time in Bath during 1788. In the winter of 1789-90 Warton and brother Joseph attended meetings of the Literary Club in London but at the beginning of May Thomas suffered a small stroke which affected one of his hands and on 20 May he suffered a paralytic stroke in the senior common room at Trinity College, Oxford, and died the following day. He was unmarried. Warton was buried in the ante-chapel of Trinity on 27 May. The chair in which he is said to have been taken ill is preserved in the old library of the college. At his death all his effects, including his papers, were passed to his brother Joseph who kept them until his own death in 1800. 
Jane Warton was to defend Thomas's character from some of what she perceived as criticism in Mant's memoir prefixed to his edition of Warton's poems. 'That Mr. Warton was totally free from pride, is certain; and that he might occasionally have drunk ale with inferior persons is possible; but, in my long acquaintance with him, I never knew that he was fond of, or kept low company.' She defends what others had criticized earlier: 'Mr. Warton was above the middle size, well made, stout, but never large, till latter in life, with a most pleasing countenance.' Concerning his manner of speaking she says: 'There was, indeed, sometimes a quickness in his manner, from the fulness of his mind; but I never heard it was thought a defect' ('GM', 1st ser., 1803, 329-32, 396). 
One modern critic has called the years from 1740 to 1790 more truly the 'Age of Warton than the Age of Johnson' (Fairer, 'Correspondence', xix). This is an accurate assessment. Warton's literary work really involved three kinds of literary history, beginning with his edition of Spenser, followed by his 'History of English Poetry', and culminating in his edition of Milton. All these, each in its own way, was a new examining of English poetry and provided a new validation for it. His indirect yet important contributions to Shakespearian scholarship changed that discipline for ever. His poetry, particularly the sonnets, influenced later generations. His antiquarianism, demonstrated in various digressions and other works, lent a credibility to that area of study. All of this makes Thomas Warton a difficult character to assess. He was more at ease with Oxford bargemen or drinking ale in a public tavern than he was as poet laureate or attending meetings of the Literary Club or in the palaces of the great, where he was often shy and retiring. He was a serious scholar whose critical methods and serious analysis of Spenser, Milton, and early English poetry were influential and admired, but at the same time he was a poet and writer of humour and satire. He enjoyed and revelled in the study and writing of history, yet he embarrassed his brother at Winchester by playing pranks with the boys. A multifaceted personality whose large amount of work and whose character were influential in his time and later, Warton was a writer whose importance was truly recognized only well after his death. An annual lecture on English poetry, given in tribute to Warton, has been organized by the British Academy since 1910.

Warwick, Sir Philip (1609-1683), politician and historian, was born in the parish of St Margaret, Westminster, on 24 December 1609, and baptized the same day. He was the only son of Thomas Warwick ('fl'. 1580-1620), organist of Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal, and Elizabeth Somerville of Aston Somerville, Warwickshire. He was educated at Eton College, which he entered about 1623, after which he may have attended Pembroke College, Cambridge, and he then spent time travelling in France and Switzerland. It seems that in 1634 he also had some practice with the pike in the Netherlands. While he was abroad, by a contract dated 2 April 1634, it was arranged that he would marry Dorothy (died 1644), daughter of Matthew Hutton of Marske, Yorkshire. On his return Warwick became secretary to his distant relative Lord Goring, and it was through Goring's influence that he became secretary to William Juxon on the latter's appointment as lord treasurer in March 1636. Warwick was admitted to Gray's Inn on 12 February 1638, and on 11 April that year was created LLB by Oxford University. A few months later, on 13 November, he became a clerk of the signet, an office he held until 1646. 
In 1640 Warwick was elected to sit for both Radnor borough and New Romney, Kent, in the Long Parliament, and chose to serve for the former. He was one of the fifty-nine 'Straffordians' who voted against Strafford's attainder, and the following year he rallied to Charles I. In his 'Memoires of the Reign of King Charles I' (1701) Warwick blamed the outbreak of the civil war on 'an envy unto the regall prerogative', and 'the irreconcileable and never to be satisfied appetite unto a change in government in the Long Parliament' (pp. 8, 75). He fought as a volunteer at Edgehill, and in 1643 he acted as the king's emissary in two unsuccessful attempts to persuade the earl of Newcastle to bring his army southwards. In January 1644 he was among those who assembled at the Oxford parliament, whereupon he was deprived of his seat at Westminster on 5 February. At Oxford he lodged in rooms at University College, and he later helped to negotiate the terms of the city's surrender in June 1646. Warwick's first wife had died in August 1644, and in 1647 he married Joan, 'nee' Fanshawe, widow of Sir William Boteler. She is not mentioned in his will, and probably predeceased him. 
In the autumn of 1647 Warwick was allowed to attend Charles at Hampton Court as one of his secretaries, and he served the king in a similar capacity a year later at the treaty of Newport. In his 'Memoires' Warwick subsequently left a firsthand account of the king's final months. Charles trusted him greatly, and in the evenings dictated to him dispatches on the progress of the treaty that were then sent to the prince of Wales. Warwick recorded that in private one day Charles warned, prophetically, that the parliamentarian commissioners 'will ask so much, and use it so ill, that the people of England will be one day glad to relodge the power they had taken from the Crown, where it is due' (Warwick, 'Memoires', 1701, 328). Warwick also described the only occasion when, late in the Newport talks, he saw the king shed tears and then compose himself with characteristic self-control: 'they were the biggest drops that ever I saw fall from an eye; but he recollected himselfe, and soon stifled them' (ibid., 326). In January 1649 Warwick was appalled when 'this good Prince was most barbarously and traiterously murdered by his owne subjects' (ibid., 8). 
On 28 July 1644 the committee for the advance of money had imposed a fine of $1000 on Warwick, though it seems that no proceedings were taken on this. On 6 August 1646 Warwick begged to compound under the Oxford articles, and the following December he was fined at the rate of one-tenth of his estate (a sum of $477 18's'.). However, in January 1649 he begged a review, having paid half his fine and compounded for a debt of $2500 which he was likely to lose. The following month, after review, the fine was reduced to $241, and later that year the Rump Parliament accepted his composition and granted him a pardon. 
By compounding, Warwick was able to remain in England during the interregnum. Although he was imprisoned on suspicion in 1655 and detained for several weeks, he avoided any involvement in royalist conspiracy. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that royalist leaders trusted his loyalty. In January 1660 Warwick was employed to negotiate with Lambert and to look after 'a very considerable sum of many thousand pounds' that had been collected 'for the advancement of the King's service' (Scrope and Monkhouse, 3.649). Hyde wrote that 'the King knows very well Mr Warwick's affection and zeal to his service and his abilities to promote it' (ibid.). It was reported that Warwick was sympathetic to the presbyterians, but at the Restoration he helped to thwart their attempts to exclude from the Lords those younger royalist peers who had gained their titles since 1642. 
Charles II expressed his gratitude to Warwick by knighting him in 1660, reappointing him as clerk of the signet, and also making him secretary to the Treasury. The earl of Southampton became lord treasurer in September 1660, but according to Gilbert Burnet he 'left the business of the Treasury wholly in the hands' of Warwick ('Bishop Burnet's History', 1.174). In 1661 Warwick was returned for Westminster and became an active member of the Cavalier Parliament: between then and 1678 he made a total of 49 recorded speeches and was appointed to 258 committees. Throughout he remained consistent in his loyalty to the crown and to the church. In the early 1660s he was appointed to all the committees that framed the Clarendon code, and chaired the committees that drafted the bills for the security of the king's person and against tumultuous petitioning. 
Warwick's role as secretary to the Treasury ensured that he regularly acted as an official spokesman on financial matters in the Commons. In June 1661 he reported that the crown's revenue amounted to only $265,000 out of an expected $1,200,000, and he was promptly appointed to a committee to consider ways in which it could be augmented. In 1663 he announced that revenues had increased to $978,000, but the Commons rejected his request for additional supply to bridge the remaining gap, on the grounds that further economies and efficiency savings would solve the problem. However, in 1665 he succeeded in persuading the Commons to grant a new tax of $70,000 a month for the duration of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, and was appointed chairman of the committee to revise county tax assessments for this 'royal aid'. In September 1666 he presented a full statement of public accounts to the Commons. 
When Southampton died in May 1667, the Treasury was put into commission. Warwick was not among the commissioners, and Sir George Downing took over his position as secretary. Gilbert Burnet thought Warwick 'an incorrupt man, and during seven years management of the Treasury made but an ordinary fortune out of it' ('Bishop Burnet's History', 1.174). It is likely that he had gained about $2000 a year from the post. That and the permission in 1663 to build a house on the road between Charing Cross and St James's Palace, together with the reversion of the office of customer and collector of customs on woollen cloth in the port of London (worth $277 a year), appear to have been the only material benefits that he derived from his office. After 1667 he remained active in the Commons, where he was widely regarded as a court supporter and usually took a sympathetic line towards the crown's policies and advisers. This was evident, for example, in his denial that Clarendon had usurped the functions of the lord treasurer, and in his defence in 1669 of the former treasurer of the navy Sir George Carteret against charges of corruption. 
Only very occasionally did Warwick deviate from the prevailing court line. His commitment to the established church led him to oppose greater toleration for either Catholics or protestant nonconformists. In 1670 he was among those appointed to consider the renewal of the 'Conventicles Act', and two years later he opposed Charles II's declaration of indulgence. However, he was soon won over by the king's conciliatory response in February 1673, even though it defended the royal suspending power and did not actually withdraw the declaration. He remained hostile to relief for protestant dissenters, and moved on 7 March that 'there may be a test upon persons to sit in this House, that the Church may not be destroyed' (Grey, 2.89). In April 1675 he was named to the committees for bills to suppress popery and to disable Catholics from sitting in either house. During the long prorogation of parliament from November 1675 to February 1677, Warwick wrote his 'Memoires', which was published posthumously in 1701. 
Warwick was included on lists of government speakers, though Sir Richard Wiseman wrote to Danby: 'I wish your lordship would think of some way to make this gentleman industrious and hearty in the service' (HoP, 'Commons, 1660-90', 3.676). Shaftesbury had no doubt as to where Warwick's loyalties lay, and when parliament reconvened in February 1677 he marked Warwick as 'thrice vile' (ibid.). Nevertheless, Warwick's fear of popery was such that he spoke out against Charles II's policy of 'rapprochement' with France. He told the Commons on 14 March 1678 that he had 'feared this greatness of the French King these forty years; and in my last Master's time, they had great correspondence in Court, and found casements to look in at' (Grey, 5.230). On 2 May he declared: 'I believe that if ever the nation was in danger, it is now... I believe all the powers in Christendom will stand by us, if we enter into a war with the King of France' (ibid., 5.300). In the autumn of 1678 he naturally believed the revelations of Titus Oates and Israel Tonge about the Popish Plot, and on 4 November denounced popery as 'a confederacy against God, and against the kingdom' (ibid., 6.147). He was among those appointed to search the cellars of the Palace of Westminster amid fears of another Catholic plot to blow up parliament. Although he was listed as a court supporter, the logic of his horror of 'popery and arbitrary government' led him to vote for the impeachment of Danby. 
During 1678 Warwick wrote 'A Discourse on Government', published posthumously in 1694. In this treatise he argued that the monarchs of England 'remain absolute though limited', and that the king was 'an absolute, though not an arbitrary monarch' (pp. 20, 41). He regarded England as 'a limited and mixt monarchy' (Warwick, 'Discourse', 185), but this did not imply that the crown, Lords, and Commons exercised co-ordinate powers. Indeed, Warwick denounced the doctrine of co-ordination as 'like to prove the mother of a civil war' (ibid., 19), and detested that 'destructive torrent of populacy' (ibid., 184) that had led the houses to take up arms against the king in 1642. His loyalty to the memory of Charles I remained beyond question, and in January 1678 he was appointed to chair a committee to consider the solemn reburial of the king's remains, though no legislation resulted from this. 
After the Cavalier Parliament was dissolved in January 1679, Warwick did not stand for parliament again. He had sold his Westminster house in the mid-1670s, and henceforth lived quietly at his home at Chislehurst in Kent. He died on 15 January 1683, probably at Chislehurst, and was buried in Chislehurst church. His only son by his first wife, also named Philip Warwick (bap. 1640, d. 1683), was appointed envoy to Sweden in 1680; he died shortly afterwards at Newmarket on 12 March 1683, after journeying home to take leave of his father. 
Warwick's contemporaries varied widely in their assessment of him. Samuel Pepys regarded him as 'a very able and right honest man', whose exposition of the government's financial problems showed him to be 'a most exact and methodical man, and of great industry' (Pepys, 29 Feb 1664, 5.70; 24 Nov 1666, 7.382). By contrast, Andrew Marvell wrote that Warwick 'never lyes more than when he professes to speak the sincerity of his heart' ('A Seasonable Argument to Perswade All the Grand Juries in England to Petition for a New Parliament', [1677], 12). There is, however, no evidence to support Marvell's further claim that Warwick 'got artificially from the Treasurer Southampton and the King $40,000'. A less vituperative but still fairly critical account was penned by Gilbert Burnet, who thought Warwick 'an honest but a weak man', who 'understood the common road of the Treasury; but, though he pretended to wit and politics, he was not cut out for that, and least of all for writing of history' ('Bishop Burnet's History', 1.174). It is, however, worth noting that both Burnet and Marvell embraced whig principles that placed them out of sympathy with Warwick's consistent allegiance to crown and church.

Warwick, Philip (bap. 1640, d. 1683), diplomat, was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 7 December 1640, the only son of Sir Philip Warwick (1609-1683), politician and historian, and his first wife, Dorothy (died 1644), daughter of Matthew Hutton of Marske, Yorkshire. It may have been he, rather than his father (who had already been admitted to Gray's Inn), who in the year 1656 was admitted to the Inner Temple, London. Nothing else is known of his early life. In 1680 Warwick was appointed 'envoye extraordinaire' on a mission to the Swedish king, Karl XI, to renew the Anglo-Swedish alliance of 1664. This was to be both a commercial and a defensive alliance. Warwick took leave of Charles II in July 1680 and is noted to have arrived in Stockholm with his secretary, John Robinson, on 29 August. Although he did not obtain an audience with the Swedish king until a couple of months later, his time in Sweden was initially taken up by other commercial issues. Warwick's regular correspondence with the British secretary of state, Sir Leoline Jenkins, not only illuminates the mission but also confirms that Warwick's role extended beyond the commercial sphere. Indeed, Warwick's duties included interceding on behalf of British merchants who fell foul of Swedish and other foreign authorities in the Baltic region. By the end of November 1680 at least five of Warwick's letters had been read out before Charles II and the committee of foreign affairs in London. 
Early in this correspondence Jenkins warned Warwick of the malicious rumours he would encounter about Britain and its government, and instructed him to refute such allegations. Jenkins also kept Warwick up to date on negotiations between Sweden and France in Germany regarding troops in Pomerania. As Jenkins had himself served as an envoy to the Swedish court in 1679 he could suggest important Swedish contacts who might help Warwick to maintain a healthy relationship between Britain and Sweden. The Swedish chancellor in particular, Bengt Oxenstierna, proved an honest and sincere man who supported Warwick's mission, and Warwick finally obtained an audience with the Swedish king on 15 November. Although it is not known exactly what was discussed, a letter to Karl XI detailing Warwick's instructions reveals that Charles II was keen to maintain and cultivate friendly and commercial relations between the two kingdoms, and it invited a Swedish envoy at his court to discuss the renewal of the lapsed treaty of 1664. 
Warwick seems to have handled effectively the affair of the Tobacco and Tar Company, closed at Jenkins's suggestion after difficulties over payment to London merchants. However, although Warwick's letters were replete with information on tolls and customs as well as shipping lists, Jenkins expressed dissatisfaction with the poor response he had received from some merchants to Warwick's work in Sweden. Their lack of interest was blamed on a preoccupation with domestic issues. This did not deter Warwick from supporting both English and Scottish merchants in Sweden, as when he sought compensation for Joseph Newcome, who had lost goods to the Swedes to the value of 400 riksdaler. 
By January 1681, along with continued hopes of ratifying a new treaty, the main issue had re-emerged: obtaining the Swedish king's interest in reviving the 1664 commercial alliance between the two kingdoms. The conditions included granting reciprocal trade privileges: for Sweden in Portsmouth, and for Stuart subjects in Goteborg. Although the Swedes did not seem overly enthusiastic about these proposals, Jenkins twice reassured Warwick that his work in Sweden was highly valued in England. Warwick also appeared to have formed a trusted relationship with Swedish secretary of state Olivencrantz, using the latter as an intermediary in order to protect his correspondence. 
As many of his letters to Karl XI show, Warwick continued his defence mostly of English merchants in their difficulties with local authorities over such issues as long overdue payment; in some cases these dated from the 1670s, unresolved in previous exchanges between Charles II and the Swedish king. This was the case with Richard Daniel, a merchant based at Riga (then a Swedish possession), who had complained in 1677 that he was being forced into becoming a burgess of the town -- and therefore liable to local taxes -- after marrying a Swedish woman there. However, Warwick was in Sweden to represent not only the English interest but that of all Stuart subjects, be it English, Irish, or Scottish. He therefore entered into correspondence over land disputes also in Livonia on behalf of Major James Bennet, a Scottish soldier who claimed the land by right of inheritance through marriage. 
Warwick's ultimate aim was to re-create and strengthen the commercial ties between Britain and Sweden. He had already been informed in October 1681 of a defensive alliance being negotiated between the Netherlands and Sweden. British participation had also been sought, but only financially -- to fund Swedish-Dutch relations. Warwick wanted to promote a purely British-Swedish connection, though Jenkins expressed the possibility of other European powers joining these negotiations. It was particularly feared that France would take any opportunity to destroy British trade. In a letter to Chancellor Oxenstierna in June 1682, Warwick clarified some of the British concerns when he passed on Charles II's desire totally to separate the issue of a friendly confederation between Sweden and Britain from that of a commercial alliance between the two kingdoms. Warwick's mission was bolstered by the arrival in July of an additional envoy who had been authorized specifically to discuss such an alliance. 
By January 1683 Warwick had informed the Swedish court and government that he had obtained Charles's permission to return home to England in order to deal with a family matter; he fully intended to return to his duties in Sweden as soon as he could. In the meantime Warwick's secretary, John Robinson, continued to work towards the formation of a British-Swedish alliance. However, Warwick died at Newmarket, Suffolk, on 12 March 1683, and Robinson assumed his role as official Stuart envoy to Sweden.

Wase, Christopher (1627-1690), schoolmaster and classical scholar, was born in Hackney, Middlesex, and baptized on 6 January 1627, the son of John Wase of London (died in or after 1670) and his wife, Susan, daughter of Richard Welby of London, merchant. He entered Eton College about 1639 and matriculated as a scholar from King's College, Cambridge, in Michaelmas 1645. A gifted polyglot and prolific scholar, while still an undergraduate he prepared a Greek translation of Hugo Grotius's 'Baptizatorium puerorum institutio', which was first published in 1647. He may have been the Christopher Wase, 'son of John Wase of Cambridge', admitted to Gray's Inn on 1 March that year. In 1648 he was elected to a fellowship at King's, from where he graduated BA in 1649. His translation of Sophocles' 'Electra', published the same year, was dedicated to Charles I's daughter Elizabeth, and in 1650 he was ejected from King's following his failure to take the engagement. He then travelled in France and the Low Countries. Captured at sea carrying letters to France for the royalists, he escaped and served as a soldier in Flanders. In 1652 he returned to England with financial assistance from John Evelyn the diarist and then became tutor to William Herbert ('b'. 1640), eldest son of the earl of Pembroke. Wase's translation of Faliscus Gratius's hunting poem 'Cynegeticon' appeared in 1654. The following year he finally proceeded MA from Cambridge. 
For the next thirteen years Wase gained his livelihood as a headmaster, from 1655 to 1662 at Dedham Royal Free School, Essex, and from 1662 to 1668 at Tonbridge School, Kent. By 1662, when his son Christopher was born, he had married Elizabeth, daughter of Gilbert Rayney, rector of St Mary-at-Stoke, Ipswich. In 1660 he published a celebration of the Restoration, 'In mirabilem Caroli II', and a dictionary, 'Methodi practicae specimen; an Essay of a Practical Grammar'; another dictionary, 'Dictionarium minus' (1662), followed. Convinced that Wase's talents were wasted and his salary of $40 a year was inadequate, Evelyn recommended him for the post of historiographer in the office of Joseph Williamson, secretary of state. Wase was 'of a most innocent, sincere, humble and sedulous mind', with a 'style nervous and material but quick', and in the diarist's opinion he lacked nothing 'to qualify him equal to the ablest writer of this age, but his Majesty's favour' ('CSP dom.', '1668-9', 65). Wase was given his appointment in April 1669. 
Office gave Wase the opportunity to help his relatives and advance his scholarly interests. In 1671 he published two translations into English -- one of Cicero's orations against Cataline, the other 'The History of France under the Ministry of Cardinal Mazarine' -- and, in response to criticisms that the growth of free schools had threatened established social distinctions and (allegedly) contributed to the dissension that led to the civil wars, undertook a pioneer investigation of the nation's grammar schools. His work was interrupted, however, when, arriving in Oxford on Eton College business in October 1671, he found that he had been elected by the university as a supervisor of the press and bedell in civil law. Avowing to Williamson on 15 October that it was done in his absence and without his knowledge, he anticipated trouble, and, via 'Dr Wren', enlisted the support of Archbishop Sheldon. Dean John Fell of Christ Church, delegate of the press, had indeed written to Sir Leoline Jenkins expressing his disgust at the choice of 'a Cambridge man, who I hear is crazed in his head and void of all judgement' ('CSP dom.', '1671', 523), but by 17 October Wase was able to write to Williamson that, 'the complete kindness of the university has defeated my fears and suspicions' (ibid., 529). 
Wase's 'Considerations Concerning Free Schools as Settled in England' was finally published in Oxford in 1678. 'Miserable is the face of any nation', he declared, 'where neither schools nor universities be frequented: no law, no safe commerce, a general ignorance and a neglect of duty both to God and man' (p. 34). He therefore proposed to increase rather than to limit the number of free schools in England and Wales, and concluded that adequate instruction should be provided for petty scholars in every parish in the land. This, he maintained, would be both socially and economically advantageous to the nation. The papers he had collected on the subject were consulted by Anthony Wood. 
Wase's later publications included another dictionary, two further works on Cicero, 'Aelfredi magni' (1678) -- a Latin version of John Spelman's life of Alfred -- and 'Senarius, sive, De legibus et licentia veterum poetarum' (1687), a treatise on Greek and Latin metrics and rhythmics. Altogether his scholarship in the classical languages established him, according to John Loveday, as 'one of the most eminent Philologers which England could boast of in the last age' (Allibone, 'Dict.', 3.2595). Wase died in Oxford on 29 August 1690, and was buried in St Mary's, Oxford.

From 1687 to 1690 he was vicar of Preston, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire. He returned in 1691 to Corpus Christi, serving as proctor in that year. He proceeded BD in 1694.

His father, a member of a family long connected with the Unitarian chapel in Gloucester, was a bookseller there in Westgate Street; born on 13 February 1761, he was mistakenly identified in the 'Dictionary of National Biography' as the compiler of 'Bibliotheca Glocestrensis: a collection of scarce and curious tracts relating to the county and city of Gloucester illustrative of and published during the Civil War', published in Gloucester. The second part appeared first in 1823, but the first part, containing a historical introduction by John Webb, did not appear until 1825. This compilation was made, as the editorial preface stated, by 'John Washbourn, jun.'.

Washbourn, Thomas (1607/8-1687), Church of England clergyman and poet, was the eldest son of John Washbourn esquire (1548/9-1634), local politician and magistrate of Wichenford, Worcestershire, and his second wife, Elenor, daughter of Richard Lygon (died 1584) of Madresfield and Margaret ('nee' Talbot) of Salwarpe, both in the same county. He had a younger brother and sister, five half-sisters, and five half-brothers. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, as a commoner in 1622, graduated BA in 1626, proceeded MA in 1628, was incorporated at Cambridge in 1631, and proceeded BD in 1636. 
In 1639 Washbourn was presented by Charles I to the rectory of Loddington, Northamptonshire, probably through the influence either of Bishop John Towers of Peterborough, father of a close friend, William Towers, or of Dr Samuel Fell, dean of Christ Church, Oxford, whose daughter Dorothy he married at Sunningwell, Berkshire, on 14 January that year. A son, Charles, was born to them at Loddington. In 1640 he resigned, and the following year was presented to Dumbleton rectory, Gloucestershire, probably by the lord of the manor. In 1643 he was nominated a prebendary of Gloucester Cathedral, and reportedly installed by night since the city was for parliament. 
Washbourn escaped sequestration despite the fact that he was an ardent monarchist, describing Charles I's execution as 'a most inhuman unparallel'd Parricide, Regicide, I had almost said Deicide, for Kings are earths Deities, Gods pictures in a lesser form' (Washbourn, 'Repairer', 19). He deplored what he saw as the arbitrary regime and unelected legislature of the Commonwealth. Thus in 1650 he agonized over taking the second engagement, especially as, he stated, he had five or six small children. He sent a messenger in midwinter to Dr Robert Sanderson in Lincolnshire to ask his advice about whether he was breaking his oath of allegiance if he signed, determined 'not to put the world in one scale, when my soul is in the other' ('Poems', 38). He accepted Sanderson's argument that he might interpret it as demanding the least of him, for he remained at Dumbleton throughout the interregnum. He was deeply dismayed at the breakdown of the parochial system, but saw hardship as beneficial: '
The Bush, the Church, 

Affliction is the fire 

Which serves not to destroy, but search 

And try her gold, raising the value higher. 
('The bush burning', 'Poems', 73)' He wrote many, mainly devotional, poems in the metaphysical style, circulated to his friends, which Mary, Lady Vere, persuaded him to publish as 'Divine Poems' in 1654. The best show considerable merit. He did not hesitate to express his views on the current religious situation in some, with an outspokenness also evident in 'A Sermon Preached at the Funerall of Charles Cocks' (1655), the lord of the manor, naively published to dispel talk that it attacked him. 
Loyalty to crown and church was rewarded when, in 1660, Washbourn was formally installed in his prebend and also created a DD of Oxford University by chancellor's letters. He responded with 'The Repairer of the Breach' (1661) preached at Gloucester Cathedral on 29 May that year to mark the king's birthday and the first anniversary of his return. From 1660 to 1668 he was vicar of St Mary de Lode, Gloucester. He died on 6 May 1687, in his eightieth year, and was buried in Gloucester Cathedral with an epitaph which, at his own insistence, described him as the greatest of sinners and the least of ministers of God.

Washington, John (1800-1863), naval officer and hydrographer, entered the navy in May 1812 on the frigate 'Juno', in which he served on the operations in the Chesapeake. In October 1813 he was moved into the 'Sybille', then in November 1814 he joined the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, from which he passed out in May 1816 with the gold medal for mathematics. He then served for three years in the 'Forth' on the North American station, and afterwards in the 'Vengeur' and the 'Superb' on the South American station, where he was promoted lieutenant on 1 January 1821. He was then at Valparaiso, and gained permission to return to England by an adventurous journey across the Andes and the pampas to Buenos Aires. 
In February 1823 Washington was appointed to the sloop 'Parthian' in the West Indies, after which he was for two years on half pay, and travelled in France, Spain, and Italy, improving his knowledge of their languages. In May 1827 he was appointed to the 'Weazle' in the Mediterranean, and in December was moved to the frigate 'Dartmouth', returning to England in the following spring. During this time he obtained leave, and travelled in Morocco with Edward William Auriol Drummond-Hay, and determined several positions by astronomical observations. From 1830 to 1833 he was flag lieutenant to Sir John Poo Beresford, commander-in-chief at the Nore, and on 14 August 1833 was promoted commander. On 3 September 1833 he married Eleonora, youngest daughter of the Revd H. Askew, rector of Greystoke, Cumberland. They had three sons. 
From 1836 to 1841 Washington was secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, of which he was one of the original members. With one clerk, he did the whole work of the society, the early success of which was largely due to his energy. In March 1841 he was appointed to the steamer 'Shearwater', for surveying work on the east coast of England, and in January 1842 was temporarily lent to the yacht 'Black Eagle', appointed to bring the king of Prussia to England. In compliment to the king, Washington was made captain on 16 March. In January 1843 he was moved to the steamer 'Blazer', in which he continued the survey of the east coast until 1847. In January 1845 he was also appointed a commissioner for inquiring into the state of the rivers, shores, and harbours of the United Kingdom, and in February was elected FRS. Afterwards he was employed in the railway and harbour department of the Admiralty; in 1853, making a visit to Denmark, Sweden, and Russia to investigate a new type of lifeboat, he was directed by Sir James Graham, then first lord of the Admiralty, to obtain information on the Russian Baltic fleet and the defences of Kronstadt, Reval, and Sveaborg. Surprisingly, he was given full facilities by the Russians, including witnessing their fleet manoeuvres, and returned impressed by the strength of the Russian defences. He became assistant to Sir Francis Beaufort the hydrographer in 1854, and on Beaufort's resignation in 1855 Washington was appointed his successor. He held this office until his death, having been promoted to the rank of rear-admiral on 12 April 1862. 
Under the pressure of the Crimean War, Washington managed to gain necessary increases in staff in the hydrographic office. He was less successful in moving the office from the unsalubrious attics of the Admiralty, and his recommendation to abolish the separate class of masters was unpopular ashore and afloat. Several ship casualties attributed, wrongly except in one case, to shortcomings in the hydrographer's department preyed on his sensitive nature. The last straw came when his second son, on return from the China station, was almost immediately sent abroad again despite Washington's pleas to the contrary. Washington became seriously ill and, on his way home from a short visit to Switzerland, died of 'nervous ailments' on 16 September 1863 at Le Havre; he was buried on 19 September in the protestant cemetery there. His wife survived him.

Wasse, Joseph (bap. 1671, d. 1738), Church of England clergyman and classical scholar, was baptized on 19 March 1671 at Hawnby, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Wasse. He entered Queens' College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1691, and graduated BA in 1694. Thereafter he became a clerk, scholar, and fellow of the college, and graduated MA (1698) and BD (1707). He assisted Ludolph Kuster in his edition of 'Suidas' (1705), and in 1710 published a critical edition of Sallust, based on an examination of nearly eighty manuscripts. In 1711 he was presented to the rectory of Aynho, Northamptonshire, by Thomas Cartwright, with whom he was on intimate terms. He passed most of his time in his library at Aynho, and, according to William Whiston, Richard Bentley pronounced him the second scholar in England. 
Wasse contributed extensively to Samuel Jebb's 'Bibliotheca literaria'; according to the printer William Bowyer the elder, the length of Wasse's articles ruined that venture. He became a proselyte to Samuel Clarke's Arian opinions, and in 1719 published 'Reformed Devotions', dedicated to Thomas Cartwright and his wife. In 1731 there appeared at Amsterdam a fine edition of Thucydides by Wasse and Charles Andrew Duker; this was reprinted at Glasgow in 1759 with the Latin version by Robert and Andrew Foulis. The original notes contained in the book are not of great value, and compare unfavourably with the Sallust. In addition to his classical scholarship Wasse contributed scientific articles to the Royal Society's 'Philosophical Transactions'. 
Joseph Wasse died unmarried on 19 November 1738. In his will, proved on 6 June 1739, he left the majority of his possessions to his only brother, Matthew. Part of his library was acquired by his successor at Aynho, Francis Yarborough, afterwards principal of Brasenose College, Oxford. The books, which contain a great number of manuscript notes by Wasse, were given by Yarborough's heirs to the college. Wasse's copy of Thucydides, with many manuscript notes, is now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

Wastell, Simon (d. 1632), schoolmaster, was from a family originating from Wasdale, Cumberland. He entered Queen's College, Oxford, about 1580, and graduated BA on 15 March 1585. Before 18 June 1592, when his son John was baptized at All Saints' Church, Northampton, he was appointed headmaster of the free school in that town. There he acquired considerable reputation as a teacher. 
In 1623 Wastell published a work based on John Shaw's 'Biblii summula' (1621), entitled 'A True Christians Daily Delight' (1623), dedicated to Robert Spencer, first Baron Spencer of Wormleighton (died 1627). It was a short summary in verse of the contents of the 'Bible', intended for children to commit to memory. To make the task easier the stanzas began with the successive letters of the alphabet. The first edition was reprinted in 1683 under the title 'The Divine Art of Memory', with a preface by T. B., and Wastell himself issued a second enlarged edition in 1629 entitled 'Microbiblion, or, The Bibles Epitome in Verse', dedicated to Spencer's son, Sir William Spencer. The summary of the 'Old Testament' was entirely recast, but the summary of the 'New Testament' was merely reprinted. 
On 1 July 1626 Wastell's first wife, Elizabeth, with whom he had eleven children between 1592 and 1611, was buried, and he subsequently married another Elizabeth (died 1639). In 1631 Wastell, or more probably his son, also Simon Wastell ('b'. 1602), was vicar of Daventry in Northamptonshire, but resigned the living before 22 September of that year. In his will, drawn up on 19 August 1631, Wastell left a house in Gold Street, Northampton, to trustees who included the physician and author Dr James Hart, to be sold for the benefit of his surviving children, Samuel ('b'. 1599), Simon, Hannah ('b'. 1609), and Mary ('b'. 1611). He died at Northampton, and was buried at All Saints' Church there on 31 January 1632. Probate was granted to his widow and son Simon on 27 February.

Waterhouse, Sir Edward (1535-1591), administrator, was born at Helmstedbury, Hertfordshire, the youngest son of John Waterhouse, administrator, of Whitechurch, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Henry Turner of Blunt's Hall, Suffolk. His father was auditor to Henry VIII, and according to family tradition the king, when visiting him one day, was particularly impressed with Edward, foretelling that he would be a man of great honour and wisdom, fit for the service of princes. Waterhouse went to Oxford University when he was twelve, 'where for some years he glistered in the oratorick and poetick sphere, until he addicted himself to conversation and observance of state affairs'. 
Waterhouse spent several years at court under the patronage of Sir Henry Sidney. Sidney revived the practice of employing a personal secretary when appointed lord deputy of Ireland in 1565, and chose Waterhouse for the office. This proved an excellent decision and Waterhouse became a mainstay of the Dublin administration. He was devoted to Sidney, who sent him on missions to London, and corresponded regularly with Sir William Cecil and Sir Francis Walsingham. He was made clerk of the castle chamber on 1 February 1566, and about the same time received a grant of a lease of the manor of Evan, co. Kildare, together with the corn tithes of Dunboyne, co. Meath. 
In 1568 Waterhouse accompanied Sidney on his tour of Ireland. The lord deputy left him in charge of Carrickfergus, co. Antrim, and he was instrumental in obtaining a charter for the town in 1570, as a result of which he was created a freeman and nominated to represent it in parliament, which he did in 1585. He surrendered his office of clerk in October 1569, and when Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex, embarked on a scheme for the plantation of co. Antrim in 1573 Waterhouse wrote seeking employment. His self-confident letter did not set out his qualifications for the post, but rather listed the many services he could perform for the earl. Essex employed him as his secretary, sending him on frequent missions to England in connection with the sale of his property and supplying his army with provisions. Waterhouse earned Essex's gratitude by his discretion and devotion. He was present during Essex's last illness, and the earl died in his arms on 22 September 1576. 
The failure of Essex's enterprise left Waterhouse unemployed, but he obtained a grant on 25 April 1576 of an annual pension of $182 10's'., which was confirmed for life on 26 June 1579. Again, Sidney appointed him as his secretary, and he was sent to England with Philip Sidney to plead the lord deputy's case in 1576-9 over the matter of the cess, including government impositions such as purveyance, levied on the inhabitants of the pale. Waterhouse's first marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of George Villiers, broke down during this time and the couple divorced in 1578. Waterhouse was appointed to the commission to inquire into concealed and forfeited lands in 1578. On 5 February 1579 he obtained a grant of the collectorship of customs on wine in Ireland, on 27 June he was appointed exchequer commissioner of the army, on 7 July receiver-general in the exchequer, and on 25 July receiver of all casual profits falling to the crown. He was present in Munster from August to November, while the army under Sir William Drury was there, and during the rebellion of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald and Sir John Desmond, adding to his other duties that of overseeing victualling. At the end of October he was sworn of the Irish privy council. The outbreak of the rebellion of Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, in November saw Waterhouse recalled to his post with the army in Munster, and for the next two years his time was fully taken up as secretary, exchequer commissioner, and overseer of the commissariat. On 17 June 1580 he obtained a grant of the office of overseer and water bailiff of the River Shannon, with valuable perquisites. He was appointed a commissioner for ecclesiastical causes on 10 April 1581, and on 22 July was granted a lease for twenty-one years of the lands of Hilltown, co. Meath. Waterhouse served the lord deputies Arthur Grey, fourteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, and Sir John Perrot with the same faithfulness that he had shown towards Essex and Sidney, seemed to have no enemies, and everyone who came in contact with him had a good word to say of him. Despite his 'weak body', he fulfilled his numerous duties assiduously. He obtained a grant of the castle and lands of Doonass, co. Clare, on 26 August, to be held in fealty, by the service of providing the lord deputy with a pair of gloves whenever he visited the castle. He had by this time accumulated numerous perquisites, and while they may not have amounted to a large income, they aroused Elizabeth I's jealousy, especially over the positions of water bailiff and custodian of the boats at Athlone, co. Westmeath. He was ordered over to England in the autumn. Waterhouse's modest behaviour and the warm commendations he brought from Ireland won over Cecil (now Lord Burghley), and his offer to surrender his patent of water bailiff mollified the queen, although she insisted on having a list made out of all patents, fees, and other perquisites granted to him during the previous seven years. 
Waterhouse returned to Ireland in April 1583. In March 1584 he was required, along with Sir Geoffrey Fenton, to carry out, according to Burghley's instructions, the unpleasant task of torturing Dermot O'Hurley, titular archbishop of Cashel, by toasting his feet before the fire. Waterhouse was knighted by Perrot in Christ Church, Dublin, on 20 June 1584, the lord deputy giving the reason for the promotion as the fact that Waterhouse spent more than 1000 marks a year in carrying out his duties. While Perrot's expedition against the Antrim Scots was greeted with general disapproval, Waterhouse spoke out in his favour. He had already given up his office of secretary to please Fenton; in November he surrendered his patent as water bailiff, and, shortly afterwards, in order to gratify Sir Henry Wallop, relinquished his receivership of casualties. He acted as peacemaker in the quarrel between Perrot and Adam Loftus, archbishop of Dublin, without forfeiting the respect of either. Perrot granted Waterhouse leave, 'having been long sick and in great danger', to go to England to plead his own case, and he urged Burghley to intercede for the restoration of his patent as water bailiff, as some reward for his long and faithful service. Waterhouse presented a detailed account of all his offices and rewards, and explained that, far from profiting by them, he had been obliged to sell land in England worth over $4000. He evidently persuaded Elizabeth, since on 19 October 1586 he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer and of the green wax in Ireland. The green wax was a legal process for recovering debts due to the crown for which the chancellor was responsible. He surrendered the office to George Clive in October 1589, having by that time received a grant (7 July 1588), in consideration 'of his sufficiency and painful good service', of the office of overseer, water bailiff, and keeper of the River Shannon for life ('Irish Fiants', nos. 3641, 5231-2). He left Ireland in January 1591, retired to his estate of Woodchurch, Kent, and died there on 13 October. His second wife was Margaret Spilman of Kent. His last wife, who survived him, was Deborah, widow of a Master Harlackenden of Woodchurch. He had no children. Edward Waterhouse ['see below'] was probably his nephew. The heraldic writer Edward Waterhouse (1619-1670) was his grandnephew.

Edward Waterhouse (fl. 1622), colonist in Virginia, was the son of Thomas Waterhouse of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. He was secretary of the Virginia Company and author of 'A declaration of the state of the colony in Virginia. With a relation of the barbarous massacre...' (1622), with a preface dated 22 August 1622. Waterhouse was the principal spokesman for the colonists after the American Indian insurrection of spring 1622. It is clear that the colonists felt that this violent resistance by the native population liberated them from the constraints of their original moral justification for their occupation, that of 'civilizing' the indigenous population, a change of attitude that had its parallel in Ireland when Sir Edward Waterhouse served Essex in Ulster at the time of the massacre of the Clandeboye O'Neills.

Waterhouse, Edward (1619-1670), heraldic writer, was born in Greenford, Middlesex, the son of Francis Waterhouse, fishmonger, of Greenford and London, and Bridget, daughter of Morgan Powell; Edward was a great-nephew of Sir Edward Waterhouse, chancellor of the exchequer in Ireland (1535-91). Francis Waterhouse had at one time been chosen chamberlain of London, but his appointment had been stopped, according to his son, 'by one of those orders that then were in date, to exclude those whom that power termed disaffected' (Waterhouse, 'A Short Narrative of the Late Dreadful Fire in London', 1667, 186). The younger Waterhouse was admitted fellow commoner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 30 June 1635 but appears not to have taken a degree (Venn, 'Alum. Cant.', 1.4, col. 344), though in 1668 he gained the degree of LLD 'per literas regias'. During the interregnum he lived in Oxford, 'for the sake of the public library', according to Wood (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.': 'Fasti', 2.163). By 1660, however, he had returned to London, where he resided at Sion College; he was still dwelling there for at least part of the year by 5 February 1665, the date on which he signed the dedication to his work 'The Gentleman's Monitor'. He also had a house at Mile End Green and an estate at Greenford. Waterhouse married Mary, daughter and heir of Robert and Magdalen Smith, alias Carrington. After her death, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard and Christiana Bateman of Hartington, Derbyshire, and London. He outlived his second wife, with whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth and Bridget, and a son, Edward, who also predeceased him about 1659. In later life he was persuaded by Archbishop Sheldon to take holy orders, being ordained by faculty on 7 April 1668. He continued to reside at Greenford and London, where he became a 'fantastical preacher' (ibid.). He died in London on 30 May 1670 and was buried on 2 June at Greenford. 
Although never a member of the College of Arms, Waterhouse had heraldic and historical interests, which are reflected in many of his works, such as 'A Discours and Defense of Arms and Armory' (1660). His earliest work was 'An Humble Apologie for Learning and Learned Men' (1653), in which he provided a historical survey of the contribution of learned men to human affairs, stressing the role of knowledge and reason in the workings of statecraft and the defence of true religion. These books reveal him as strongly influenced by Neoplatonic thought -- God was a 'divine and architectonick artist' ('Humble Apologie', 10) -- as well as by neo-Stoicism. In the same year his 'Two Brief Meditations' provide a sign of his future religiosity, as does 'A Modest Discourse of the Piety, Charity and Policy of Elder Times and Christians' (1655). The majority of his writings, however, pertained to the history and fortunes of great families. A firm supporter of social distinction, Waterhouse was fascinated by distinguished ancestry, and in particular by the mutability of fortunes. His remarks on the vicissitudes of rank and prosperity have sometimes been seen as insightful sociological analysis in the tradition of the Tudor writer Sir Thomas Smith and of the Restoration political economists such as William Davenant, John Graunt, and Gregory King. More recent commentators have been less kind, seeing his work mainly as the pessimistic outpouring of a middle-aged man, beset by grief for his second wife and fixated on the impending extinction of his own direct line after the death of his son. On the other hand, Wood's contemporary assessment of Waterhouse as a 'cock-brain'd man' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.': 'Fasti', 2.164) of small ability seems unduly harsh. Contemporaries such as John Wilkins thought highly enough of Waterhouse to propose him in 1663 for fellowship of the Royal Society, in which body Waterhouse was mildly active until 1664, paying his subscription until 1666. In that year occurred the great fire, which occasioned his last outpouring on the subject of impermanence, 'A Short Narrative of the Late Dreadful Fire in London' (1667). This work, which described the fire as a divine judgment on London, and a sign of the impermanence even of buildings, also placed the conflagration in the context of other fires through history. He dedicated it to his kinsman and friend Sir Edward Turnor (1617-1676), then speaker of the House of Commons. 
Waterhouse was credited by Dugdale, who was almost certainly mistaken, with whole authorship of 'The Sphere of Gentry' (1661) by the herald-painter Sylvanus Morgan, a peculiar work to which he doubtless contributed some parts, including the history of his family and its arms (Morgan, 2.67). He also wrote a life of his great-uncle and namesake, the Elizabethan official, for David Lloyd's 'State Worthies' (1670, 537). But Waterhouse's two most significant works were without question 'Fortescutus illustratus' (1663), a learned commentary on the fifteenth-century jurist Sir John Fortescue's 'De laudibus legum Angliae' (a text most recently studied by the great Selden) and 'The gentleman's monitor, or, A sober inspection into the virtues, vices and ordinary means of the rise and decay of men and families' (1665), on which his modern reputation as an acute social theorist largely rests. The former work was approved for publication by several leading jurists, including Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Orlando Bridgeman. The latter work, dedicated to Sheldon, offers an analysis of social mobility within the more conventional medium of a critique of vices such as prodigal spending and the irresponsibility of heirs in preserving their family's fortunes.

Waterhouse, George (d. 1602), musician, is of unknown parentage and education. The record of his admission as a gentleman of Elizabeth I's Chapel Royal in July 1588 noted that he was 'from Lincoln'. His erstwhile occupation there is unknown; he was not associated with the music or choir of the cathedral. On 7 July 1592 he supplicated the University of Oxford for admission to the degree of bachelor of music; there is no record of its having been conferred. His stated qualification for this award lay in his having spent many years in the study of theoretical and practical music. 
The only surviving example of Waterhouse's composition is an extraordinary collection of canons upon the plainsong antiphon 'Miserere mihi, domine', occupying over 400 pages of closely written manuscript and numbered as 1163 individual pieces. Almost all are composed two parts in one above their subject, whose twenty-six-note theme is laid out at diverse pitches in notional semibreves. As well as plain canon they employ, in various permutations, the conventional techniques of inversion, augmentation, and equalization, and engage a robust diversity of intervals between the canonic voices; there are also quasi-mensuration canons and 'enigma' canons. The performance method envisaged was vocalization. 
In moderation such exercises were a commonplace of musical education, and though Waterhouse's excess may seem 'a useless monument of patience and ingenuity' ('DNB'), it was regarded with admiration in its day. His Chapel Royal 'friend and fellow' Thomas Morley knew well 'those never enough praised travailes of master Waterhouse', wherein he 'for varietie surpassed all who ever laboured in that kinde of studie'. Waterhouse's industry and resourcefulness were indeed remarkable, and there can be little dispute with Morley's judgement that the composer's efforts were 'sufficient to quench the thirst of the most insaciate scholler whatsoever' (Morley, 115, 183). In 1636 two manuscript copies of the canons were bequeathed by one Henry Bury to the universities; that destined for Cambridge, in a late sixteenth-century hand, was placed in the university library. Still a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, Waterhouse died on 18 February 1602.

Waterhouse, George Robert (1810-1888), zoologist, was born on 6 March 1810 at Somers Town, London, the son of James Edward Waterhouse, a solicitor's clerk and amateur lepidopterist, and his wife, Mary Newman. Waterhouse loathed his education at a school in Koekelberg, near Brussels (1821-4), and returned to England to be articled to an architect. He practised between 1831 and 1835, designing the Hampstead garden of the publisher Charles Knight. However, the capture of a pair of poplar hawkmoths while a schoolboy had fired him for a different career; the draughtsman turned to illustrating insect structure, and he became a gifted entomologist. Self-taught, like so many, he transformed an avocation into an occupation. He was among the founders (and was honorary curator) of the Entomological Society in 1833, an informal enthusiasts' club. Partly he financed his career move by writing on insects, fish, and mammals for Knight's 'Penny Cyclopedia'. In 1834 he married Elizabeth Ann Griesbach, sister of fellow Entomological Society officer the Revd A. W. Griesbach. The couple had three sons and three daughters. Appointment to a museum curatorship at the Royal Institution at Liverpool in 1835 brought some security. However, Waterhouse returned to London the following year; when John Gould, the superintendent of the ornithological collections of the Zoological Society of London's museum, went on half pay, Waterhouse was appointed the museum's first curator in 1836 at $120 per annum. Newly located in John Hunter's Leicester Square house, the Zoological Society's museum was wealthy at first, with an annual budget of $1000 and bulging shelves. Within a year Waterhouse had completed his 'Catalogue of the Mammalia' (1838), which listed all 665 mammals, though its publication was delayed because of his nomenclatural disagreements with the society's quinarians. 
Waterhouse was a prolific describer of the world's Coleoptera (beetles), rodents, and marsupials, publishing 120 papers between 1833 and 1866. The species he enumerated told of Britain's imperial march: from scarab beetles to Australian butterflies, African giant rats to Indian squirrels. He first described the Australian numbat 'Myrmecobius' in 1836. That year HMS 'Beagle' returned, and Waterhouse examined Darwin's South American mice, recognizing nineteen new species and one new genus in February 1837. His findings -- which came just as Gould was diagnosing Darwin's supposedly disparate Galapagos birds as representative species of finch -- helped to convince Darwin that representative species were common, and that islands could evolve new races. Waterhouse contributed the volume 'Mammalia' to Darwin's five-part 'Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Beagle' in 1839. He also described Darwin's insects, again showing that the Galapagos species were largely unique to each island. Classification was then part of zoology's 'raison d'etre', but Waterhouse's quinarian arrangement of mammals in 1843 had Darwin insisting (in a rare admission of his private views) that true classification should reflect 'descent from common stocks' ('Correspondence', 2.376). 
In 1843 the Zoological Society ended Waterhouse's appointment, evidently as an economy measure, and he became an assistant in the mineralogical branch of the department of natural history at the British Museum. His 'Natural History of the Mammalia' (1846-8) stopped at two volumes (on marsupials and rodents) when the publisher Bailliere was affected by the revolution in France. Waterhouse was president of the Entomological Society in 1849-50, and vice-president of the Zoological Society in 1862-3. His brother F. G. Waterhouse, who lived in South Australia from 1852, sent Waterhouse canisters of live Coleoptera, enabling him to become an expert on the Australian Curculionidae (weevils), and to monograph the family Amycterinae. His 'Catalogue of British Coleoptera' (1858) cleared up the synonymy of many species. 
In 1851 Waterhouse succeeded Charles Konig as keeper of the mineralogical branch, which was shortly renamed the mineralogical and geological branch. It became the department of geology and mineralogy in 1856, with Waterhouse its keeper; on its division into two departments in 1857, Waterhouse became keeper of geology. Richard Owen, the new superintendent of the natural history department, dispatched Waterhouse to Germany in 1862 to assess Karl Haberlein's Solenhofen fossils, especially the reptilian bird 'Archaeopteryx' (or 'Gryphosaurus' as Owen was set to call it, and as it appears in the trustees' minutes). Waterhouse negotiated the British Museum's purchase of 107 fossils and 53 counterparts of Solenhofen reptiles and fish, including 'Archaeopteryx', for $450 in November 1862. He bought a further 1595 fossils from Haberlein in 1863. He added numerous collections from the mid-1860s, when he purchased J. S. Bowerbank's Mesozoic invertebrates, until 1880, when he acquired 50,000 non-British fossils from the Museum of Practical Geology. As a keeper and erstwhile architect, Waterhouse helped to design the galleries of the new Natural History Museum in South Kensington, but he blocked moves (suggested by T. H. Huxley) to build a lecture theatre and research galleries. Waterhouse retired in 1880, a year before the museum opened. He nevertheless saw his son Charles Owen Waterhouse (whose godfathers were Charles Darwin and Richard Owen) continue as an assistant in the zoology department. Waterhouse never entirely recovered from a stroke in 1885 and he died at his home, Curton Lodge, Werter Road, Putney, on 21 January 1888.

Waterland, Daniel (1683-1740), theologian, second son of Henry Waterland, rector of Walesby and Flixborough, Lincolnshire, and his second wife, was born at Walesby on 14 February 1683. He was educated at the free school in Lincoln and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was admitted on 30 March 1699, elected scholar on 26 December 1702, and fellow on 13 February 1704. He graduated BA in 1703 and BD in 1714, and proceeded MA in 1706 and DD in 1717. On 8 May 1724 he was incorporated DD at Oxford University. He married in 1719 Theodosia (died 1761), daughter of John Tregonwell of Anderton, Dorset. 
A dedicated teacher and an able administrator, Waterland devoted his considerable energies to his college and his university. In February 1714 he was appointed master of Magdalene by the visitor, Lord Suffolk and Bindon, whose son he had tutored as an undergraduate, succeeding another Lincolnshire man, Gabriel Quadring, in the office; he was also presented to the living of Ellingham, Norfolk. He was a vigorous and very successful master of Magdalene, the college of his father and grandfather. This family connection was strengthened when he brought in his brother Theodore from Clare College as, successively, a foundation fellow, dean, and, by 1718, president of the college. On 14 November 1715 Waterland succeeded Thomas Sherlock as vice-chancellor of the university. On 7 June 1716 he preached a sermon on the occasion of the university's public thanksgiving for the suppression of the Jacobite rising, and on 22 October he presented to the prince of Wales, at Hampton Court, a congratulatory address that he had devised with Richard Bentley, the master of Trinity College; this entailed the beginning of an enmity with the not inconsiderable Jacobite elements in Cambridge. In 1717 Waterland became a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king; he received no further promotion at Cambridge and was especially disappointed never to have been offered either the Lady Margaret or the regius chair in divinity. 
Waterland and Bentley were the leading moderate whigs in early Hanoverian Cambridge and their acceptance of Bishop Moore's library, from George I, was symbolic of the good relations they successfully sought to have with whig politicians. Waterland was responsible for the arrangements in accepting and organizing this considerable gift of books. His relationship with Bentley cooled somewhat as a result of his involvement in the censure passed by heads of houses, in January 1721, on Bentley's libel on John Colbatch (1664-1748); Bentley had attacked Colbatch, a professorial fellow of Trinity, for writing a tract (in fact the work of Conyers Middleton) which was critical of Bentley's conduct during the 1717 ceremony for the presentation of DDs, at which Waterland had received his own degree. Waterland was a member of the syndicate appointed on 26 September 1723 to take such steps as might be advisable for the purpose of defeating or delaying Bentley's restoration to office in the university, which they eventually granted him in March 1724. 
It was widely felt that Waterland studied too hard at great long-term cost to his health. He drew up a detailed programme of reading for undergraduates in the 1710s, which he first published as 'Advice to a Young Student' in 1730; it reached a third edition in 1760. In this work he recommended much of the new learning, especially the mathematical works of Newton and his expositors; he also recommended a reading of Locke's 'Essay', though he alerted his readers to what he considered to be dangerous elements in that work. He advised that strictly theological study be left until after intensive study of the classics and philosophy for the BA degree. It was, however, in the study of theology that he was to make his own mark. He quickly took up the orthodox cause in the engagement over the doctrine of the Trinity, which began in earnest when Arianism began to be promoted by Samuel Clarke and his Cambridge followers. At the public commencement at Cambridge in 1714 Waterland held a much admired disputation with Sherlock on the question of Arian subscription to the 'Thirty-Nine Articles', which was then being discussed as a result of the Arian tendency of Clarke's controversial 'Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity' (1712). John Jackson (1686-1763), an Arian-inclined disciple of Clarke, subsequently published the correspondence that he had had with Waterland on the matter, without Waterland's permission, leading Waterland to respond with a public attack on the Arianism of Clarke and of Daniel Whitby (an influential clerical critic of the doctrine of the Trinity) in a learned tract, 'A Vindication of Christ's Divinity' (1719). In the course of this work Waterland attacked Clarke's motivation in pleading, as a human infirmity, the right of Arians to subscribe to Trinitarian formulas in the 'Thirty-Nine Articles'; to Waterland this was pure dishonesty, an argument which he reaffirmed when he replied, in an 'Answer' (1720), to Whitby's critique of the 'Vindication'. In his own reply, 'The Modest Plea, &c. Continued' (1720), Clarke indicted Waterland for relying on the testimony of the church fathers and tradition in making the Trinitarian case, stating that he himself preferred to argue about points of doctrine on purely scriptural grounds. The appeal to the fathers (principally as interpreters of scripture) to church history and to modern philosophy had become marked features of Waterland's style of thought very early in his publishing career, and in this he revealed his moderate high-churchmanship and his own preference for the considered results of theological learning over direct and simple appeal to scripture. He once again strongly condemned Clarke-inspired attempts at opening up the meaning of the articles away from orthodox interpretation, which he defined as the sense which the church intended, in a stinging rebuke, 'The Case of Arian Subscription Consider'd' (1721). He continued on the orthodox offensive with the publication of 'The Scriptures and the Arians, Compared in their Accounts of God the Father and God the Son' (1722), which tried to meet Clarke on his home ground of scriptural authority, and in two further supplemental works which also contained replies to his other critics, 'A Second Vindication of Christ's Divinity' (1723) and 'A Farther Vindication of Christ's Divinity' (1724). He had returned to the fray over subscriptions in 'A Supplement to the Case of Arian Subscription Considered' (1722), in which he developed his strongly Arminian reading of the articles. His firmly liturgical sense of the Anglican tradition informed his final major engagement with Clarke's Arianism, 'Remarks upon Dr. Clarke's Exposition of the Church Catechism' (1730). Waterland similarly replied to Arianizing tendencies among dissenters in 'An Answer to some Queries Printed at Exon' (1721). He reaffirmed the importance of antiquity as a means of defending the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity in his last major work on the subject, 'The Importance of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity Asserted' (1734). 
Waterland's learning and acumen impressed Bishop Robinson of London, who consequently appointed him as the first lecturer on the Lady Moyer foundation (1719-20). The sermons that he preached on the foundation at St Paul's Cathedral restated, in a more polemical tone, his anti-Arian argument that the authority of antiquity and scripture vindicated the orthodox interpretation of Christ's divine nature. They were published as 'Eight Sermons in Defence of the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ' (1720) and enjoyed a wide circulation; they were the most immediately influential of his works. Following the success of his Lady Moyer lectures Waterland was presented by the dean and chapter of St Paul's to the London rectory of St Augustine with St Faith. On 21 December 1722 he was appointed chancellor of the archdiocese of York by Archbishop Dawes. He was made a canon of Windsor on 27 September 1727 and he became archdeacon of Middlesex on 13 August 1730; he was also presented to the vicarage of Twickenham in October 1730, whereupon he resigned his London rectory. In 1723 he published another major defence of theological orthodoxy, his 'Critical History of the Athanasian Creed'. This acted as a farther bulwark against Clarke's Arianism since the creed contained the most explicit formulation of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. In an exhaustive review of the evidence Waterland assigned composition of the Athanasian creed to the years 426-30 and attributed its authorship to St Hilary of Arles. He justified writing such a learned work in English by pointing to the obvious need to obviate the potentially dangerous effects of heterodox argument on this matter. Its importance was immediately recognized and a second edition was issued in 1728. He also actively engaged in the controversy about deism, producing 'Scripture Vindicated' (1730-32), a reply to Matthew Tindal's 'Christianity as Old as the Creation', in three parts. This developed his method of interpreting the scriptures, which demonstrated that since their teaching was often parabolic and mystical in form then they could not be easily and simplistically condemned in the manner promoted by Tindal. Scripture was also, Waterland argued, a vital record of historical truth. He denied that natural religion was enough for humanity by emphasizing how only revealed religion contained the essential doctrines of the reward of eternal life and the status of Christ as mediator. A more sophisticated critique of Waterland's reading of scripture, a 'Letter to Dr. Waterland Containing some Remarks on his Vindication of Scripture', appeared in 1731. This was the work of Conyers Middleton, who had begun to enjoy something of a rivalrous relationship with Waterland at Cambridge. Middleton urged that many of the stories of the 'Old Testament' could only make sense to rational people if they were understood allegorically, thus compromising Waterland's emphasis on other, more direct modes of exegesis; Waterland's vexed response to this work can be seen in his heavily annotated copy of the text, which is now in the Bodleian Library (8o Rawlinson, 437). These exchanges led, in the early 1730s, to something of a pamphlet war concerning deism. Waterland also rather conventionally attacked deism, as a morally corrupting system of ideas, in a charge to the archdeaconry of Middlesex, which he published in 1732 as 'Christianity Vindicated Against Infidelity'. 
Waterland's continuing efforts at countering the influence of Clarke's metaphysics on religious orthodoxy led him to contribute 'A Dissertation on the Argument a priori for Proving the Existence of a First Cause' as an anonymous appendix, 'the work of a learned hand', to Edmund Law's 'Enquiry into the Ideas of Space, Time, Immensity, and Eternity' (1734). In this largely historical as well as philosophical work Waterland objected to Clarke's use of the ontological argument; he was supported in this endeavour not only by Law but also by Joseph Clarke, a young fellow of Magdalene, who would later edit Waterland's sermons for the press. This was a major element of a significant rearguard action against Clarke's version of Newton's physico-theology that occurred in Cambridge, hitherto the centre of such reasoning, in the 1720s and 1730s. Some of Waterland's correspondence in the British Library reveals his deep suspicion of Newton's Arianism, the influence of which at Cambridge he saw it as his duty to counteract (BL, Add. MS 5831, fols. 172-3, 173-5; BL, Add. MS 6396, fol. 14). Law dedicated his translation of Archbishop King's 'The Origin of Evil' (1731) to Waterland, who had acted as his patron at the outset of his career. 
Waterland also contributed to the debate on the eucharist that had been inaugurated by Bishop Hoadly's 'Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper' (1735) by producing a very detailed and scholarly 'Review of the Doctrine of the Eucharist as Laid Down in Scripture and Antiquity' (1737). This work retained its status as a vigorous statement of Anglican doctrine until well into the nineteenth century. Waterland maintained that the sacraments were a major support of central elements of Christian teaching, not least because they emphasized Christ's divine nature. The eucharist was explained as a material and spiritual symbol of Christ's sacrifice; it could not then be merely the service of commemoration which the low-church Hoadly insisted it was. In the plethora of writings on the subject produced at this time Waterland's words were to prove the most influential. In making his argument he once again appealed to patristic authority and to the testimony of antiquity and tradition. He had been concerned with such matters some time before Hoadly went into print on the matter, having already produced a work entitled 'The Nature, Obligation, and Efficacy of the Christian Sacraments Considered' in 1730. In common with so many of his fellow churchmen Waterland was also a critic of enthusiasm, as can be seen in his tract on the rite of baptism, 'Regeneration Stated and Explained According to Scripture and Antiquity' (1740), which denounced the Methodists and the doctrine of the new birth. For Waterland baptism was a once-only event, the beginning of the Christian life, and any subsequent renewal was simply the maturing of that life, not some new salvific event. Regeneration was not, then, a distinct new birth but a continuing process of spiritual maturation. These considerations were extended in a posthumously published study, 'An Inquiry Concerning the Antiquity and Practice of Infant Communion', which discussed the history and doctrine that informed the proper time for the incorporation of young people into the church. The attack on Whitefield and Wesley was also continued in another posthumously published tract, 'A Summary View of the Doctrine of Justification' (1742). Waterland was afraid that Methodist faith in justification would prove a stimulus to antinomianism and he wanted to emphasize the centrality of a moral life which is implied in the orthodox view of justification as the incorporation of the individual believer within the church. Waterland denounced any belief in the primacy of salvation by faith alone; he stressed instead the need for good works and a strenuous moral life in achieving salvation. 
Although popular with his fellow clergy as a succinct defender of theological orthodoxy Waterland declined the office of prolocutor in the lower house of convocation in 1734; he also refused the see of Llandaff in 1738 and in 1740. Indeed his beliefs were closer to those of the lower clergy than they were to those of the latitudinarians, who tended to enjoy higher preferments in the church, which led his friend the antiquary William Cole to claim that 'Dr Waterland was long talked of for a Bishopric... tho' his 'Church notions' did not exactly square with the fashionable Opinions' (BL, Add. MS 5831, fol. 171). He was a deeply and unusually learned man and his researches encompassed a wide area of theological and historical enquiry. In common with a number of his clerical contemporaries he was a scholar of Old English; he also corresponded with the clerical historian John Lewis on the subject of Reginald Pecock, the controversial fifteenth-century theologian. Waterland died on 23 December 1740 and was buried in the south transept of St George's Chapel, Windsor. A fine funeral sermon was preached for him by his Middlesex colleague Jeremiah Seed, a fellow of the Queen's College, Oxford. His 'Sermons' were published posthumously under the editorship of Joseph Clarke in 1742. 
Waterland was one of the most able and influential theologians in the eighteenth-century Church of England. A firm opponent of the Arianism that had grown up in Cambridge as a legacy of Newton's and of Clarke's theologies, he helped to keep theological heterodoxy at bay in the first half of the eighteenth century. An able controversialist, he was suspicious of both mysticism and metaphysics, looking instead to history and external evidence, often of a textual kind, in making the orthodox case. He belonged to the Anglican patristic tradition championed by George Bull, to whom he became a natural successor in the theological debates of the first half of the eighteenth century. His theology remained influential into the early nineteenth century and he was championed both by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who thought it the duty of all Anglican clergy to make themselves familiar with Waterland's writings, and by William van Mildert, who produced a major edition of Waterland's works, in ten volumes, at the Clarendon Press in 1823. Mark Pattison, in his important essay 'Tendencies of religious thought in England, 1688-1750', first published in 'Essays and Reviews' in 1860, noted the continued importance of Waterland for high-church thinking and saw in him the one figure in the eighteenth-century church to whom appeal could be made by 'the genuine Anglican', who, in 'constructing his 'Catena patrum'... closes his list with Waterland or Brett, and leaps at once to 1833, when the 'Tracts for the Times' commenced -- as Charles II dated his reign from his father's death' (M. Pattison, 'Essays', ed. H. Nettleship, 1889, 2.49). He was one of the most learned divines of his age and he used his considered erudition against such equally learned, but considerably less orthodox, Cambridge contemporaries as Clarke, Whitby, Whiston, and Middleton, as well as against deists such as Tindal, low-churchmen such as Hoadly, and Methodists such as Whitefield and Wesley. As a controversialist Waterland took on an unusually varied group of often extremely talented adversaries in engagements in which he invariably came out rather well. His writings are absolutely central to any appreciation of the religious life of eighteenth-century England, and they mark a degree of continuity in Anglican thinking from the close of the seventeenth century, in the tradition championed by George Bull, to the high-church revival that followed in the wake of the Oxford Movement. 
The last volume of van Mildert's edition of the 'Works' is largely taken up with letters, to which may be added 'Fourteen Letters to Zachary Pearce' (ed. E. Churton, 1868), which covers a range of theological matters, and 'Five Letters to William Staunton', appended to Staunton's 'Reason and Revelation Stated' (1722). There are also important letters in the British Library and the Bodleian Library.

Waters, Sir John (1773/4-1842), army officer, was born at Ty-fry, near Welsh St Donats, Glamorgan. His grandfather, Edward Waters of Pittcott, was high sheriff of Glamorgan in 1754. His father, name unknown, died young, leaving a large family. The marquess of Bute obtained a commission for the son in the 1st (Royal Scots) foot on 2 August 1797. He joined the 2nd battalion in Portugal, and served with it in the expeditions to The Helder in 1799, and to Egypt in 1801. He had become lieutenant on 15 February 1799, and in reward for his conduct during a mutiny at Gibraltar in 1802 the duke of Kent obtained a company for him in the York rangers on 24 September 1803. He remained, however, with the 1st, and went with them to the West Indies. On 28 February 1805 he was promoted captain in the 1st, to which two new battalions had been added, and soon afterwards returned to England. 
In August 1808, owing to the duke of Kent's recommendation, he was made aide-de-camp to Brigadier Charles William Stewart (afterwards third marquess of Londonderry). He went with him to Portugal, and served in Moore's campaign. Sent out to obtain intelligence of the French movements in December, he bought from the Spaniards at Valdestillas an intercepted dispatch from Berthier to Soult, which gave Moore most important information, and at once altered his plans. He was promoted major on 16 February 1809, and was attached to the Portuguese army (with the local rank of lieutenant-colonel), but employed on intelligence duties, for which he was praised by Wellington, who wanted him definitely placed on his staff. The most conspicuous instance of Waters's usefulness was at the passage of the Douro on 12 May. The French had broken the bridge and removed the boats, and had 10,000 men on the opposite bank. Waters discovered a poor barber who had crossed the river with a small skiff the previous night; and they, joined by the prior of Amarante, crossed the river undetected, and returned with three large barges, in which the first troops crossed. 
On 3 April 1811, before the action of Sabugal began, Waters was made prisoner, after he had crossed the Coa to reconnoitre. 'He had rendered very important services upon many occasions in the last two years, and his loss is sensibly felt' (Wellington to Lord Liverpool, 9 April 1911; 'Selections from the Dispatches', 7.433). He refused parole, and was sent to Salamanca with a guard of four gendarmes. Better mounted than they, he awaited his opportunity, and put spurs to his horse. He was on a wide plain, with French troops before and behind him; as he rode along their flank some encouraged, others fired at him. Passing between two columns he reached a wooded hollow, and evaded his pursuers. Two days later he reached British headquarters, 'where Lord Wellington, knowing his resolute, subtle character, had caused his baggage to be brought, observing that he would not be long absent' (Napier, bk 12, chap. 5). On 15 April Wellington appointed him (subject to confirmation) an assistant adjutant-general, and on 30 May he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel. 
Waters served throughout the war, being present at Talavera, Busaco, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vitoria, the battles of the Pyrenees (during which he was wounded while speaking to Wellington), the Nivelle and Nive, Orthez and Toulouse. At Badajoz and Salamanca he acted as adjutant-general. He received the gold cross with four clasps, and was made CB in 1815. He was at Waterloo, and again acted as adjutant-general after Sir Edward Barnes was wounded, and signed the returns of the battle, though he was himself wounded also. He received the Russian order of St Anne (2nd class). After a time on half pay, he became captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards on 15 May 1817. He was promoted colonel on 19 July 1821, and was again placed on half pay on 15 February 1827. He became major-general on 22 July 1830, was made captain of Yarmouth Castle, Isle of Wight, on 22 April 1831, and KCB on 1 March 1832. He was made colonel of the 81st foot on 15 June 1840, and promoted lieutenant-general on 23 November 1841. He died at Park Place, St James's, London, on 21 November 1842, at the age of sixty-eight, and was buried at Kensal Green.

Waterton, Charles (1782-1865), naturalist, was born on 3 June 1782, at the family seat of Walton Hall, Sandal Magna, near Wakefield, the eldest son of the six children of Thomas Waterton (died 1805), and his wife, Anne (died 1819), a daughter of Edward Bedingfeld and his wife, Mary. Waterton's father, who had inherited Walton Hall in 1767, was a direct descendant of Sir Thomas More, chancellor to Henry VIII. The family had a long history in northern England: it was mentioned in Shakespeare ('Richard II', II.1), distinguished at Agincourt, and a staunch royalist supporter at Marston Moor. 
Waterton was educated as a Roman Catholic, and in 1792 was sent to a small preparatory school at Tudhoe, near Durham. Four years later he went to Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, where it was said he became a fanatical rat-catcher. In 1798 he made a promise (on the advice of his master, Father Clifford) never to drink wine or spirits -- a promise he kept for the rest of his life. He remained at Stonyhurst until 1801 and spent the following year at home, hunting with Lord Darlington. 
In November 1802 Waterton sailed for Spain with his younger brother Christopher on the brig 'Industry'. They visited Cadiz, before travelling to Malaga to stay with two maternal uncles, who were naturalized Spaniards. A year after Waterton's arrival, there was an outbreak of 'black vomit' (plague) in Malaga. He fell seriously ill and one of his uncles died. Nevertheless, both the Waterton brothers managed to escape from the quarantined city and returned to England in 1803. Waterton then enjoyed a season's hunting in Yorkshire, but his health was still not good, and he decided to sample the warmer climes of the family estates at Demerara. 
On 29 November 1804 Waterton sailed from Portsmouth on board the 'Fame', and after a voyage of six weeks landed at Stabroek (later Georgetown). He managed four large plantations at Demerara, owned by his uncle Christopher Waterton, along with several hundred enslaved people attached to the estates. While in Demerara he took in the opportunity to pursue his natural history studies. On the death of his father in 1805, he inherited Walton Hall, and returned home. About 1806 or 1807 he returned to Demerara where he continued to manage the family estates, and travel extensively. In 1807 he received a commission as lieutenant in the 2nd regiment of the Demerara militia, a position which provided him with the opportunity to explore the Orinoco. On 2 August 1808 he departed from Demerara in the 'Levina', on behalf of the British government, to convey dispatches from Admiral Collingwood to the Spanish captain-general of the Orinoco, Don Felipe de Ynciarte. Furthermore, Waterton was granted permission to enter Dutch Guiana by Governor Carmichael. 
Waterton relinquished responsibility for the family plantations in 1812 and in that April, at the beginning of the wet season, set out on an expedition into the Demerara forests. His primary aim for this expedition was to acquire samples of curare poison (or 'wourali'), thought at the time to be a possible remedy for rabies. He was also keen to visit Lake Parima, in search of the elusive golden city of El Dorado of the Amerindians. During the expedition he paddled up the Demerara River to the rock of Seba. Several weeks later, on reaching a settlement of Macusi Indians, he was successful in obtaining samples of curare. (His research into the anaesthetic properties of the drug brought curare to the attention of a wide audience and contributed to its later widespread use.) He journeyed on to the Essequibo and Burro Burro rivers, the savannahs on the Brazil frontier, and from the Pirara River he travelled by canoe on to the fort of Sao Joachim. However, four months after beginning his expedition, he fell ill and was forced to quit his journey. In 1813, probably sick with malaria, he sailed home to England on the 'Fame', docking at Liverpool in the spring of that year. Owing to his lingering illness, he was forced to decline an exploration of Madagascar, for which venture he had been personally recommended by Governor Carmichael to Lord Bathurst. He spent the next three years at Walton Hall, which stood on an island in a lake of about 30 acres, surrounded by a well-wooded park. In the autumn of 1814 Waterton was badly injured while loading a gun; he attended to the wound himself, and then bled himself using his lancet. He had been introduced to the practice of bloodletting by Dr John Marshall, in Guiana, and Waterton was a firm advocate of its beneficial use. 
On 19 March 1816 Waterton sailed from Liverpool on board the 'Indian' to embark on his second 'wandering' in South America. He landed in April at Pernambuco (Recife), Brazil, where he collected a number of birds, before proceeding on a Portuguese brig to Cayenne, French Guiana, using a hen-coop on deck as his bed. He then sailed on a Yankee brig to Paramaribo, Surinam, New Amsterdam, and Georgetown. He spent six months in the forest collecting more than 200 specimens, and searching for the 'feathered tribe'. In 1817 he returned home, on board the 'Dee', with his numerous specimens. Waterton, a skilled taxidermist, had developed an alternative method for preserving specimens: skins were soaked in a solution of alcohol and bichloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate) for several hours, dried, and then modelled into shape from the interior -- rendering internal stuffing unnecessary. A scarlet ibis was believed to be the earliest specimen preserved by this technique in 1810. His preserved specimens were often arranged on the staircase at Walton Hall. In later years John Edmonston, a freed slave Waterton had brought back from Guiana, taught Charles Darwin how to stuff birds, having been taught himself by Waterton. 
In October 1817 Waterton visited Italy where he passed the winter of 1817-18. In Rome, accompanied by Captain Edwin Jones, his friend from Tudhoe School, he displayed his increasing eccentricity: placing a glove on top of the lightning conductor above the cross of St Peter's and standing on one leg on the head of the guardian angel which surmounted the castle of St Angelo. In 1818 he made another visit to Rome, this time accompanied by his old Stonyhurst friends, seeking an audience with a Vatican official. He returned to England on 19 February 1818. 
In February 1820 Waterton set sail from the Clyde in the 'Glenbervie' for his third 'wandering' in South America. He arrived back in Georgetown, where yellow fever had become epidemic, and by June that year he was himself ill with fever. He prepared his own cure, which consisted of cinchona bark, laudanum, calomel, and jalap, in addition to his routine bloodletting. During this trip to Demerara he ventured into the interior by way of the Essequibo River. He remained in the forest for eleven months, and collected 230 birds, 2 land tortoises, 5 armadillos, 2 large snakes, a sloth (his favourite subject), a giant anteater, and a cayman. On his return to Liverpool in the 'Dee', in 1821, he was met by excisemen who withheld his collection for several weeks until the duty was assessed. 
After his return Waterton decided to surround the park at Walton Hall with a 9 foot wall which was completed in the summer of 1826. Within the enclosed park he banned the use of guns, and the area was transformed into what was probably the country's first nature reserve and bird sanctuary. Alexander Wilson's 'Ornithology of the United States' inspired Waterton to visit America, and in the early summer of 1824, he sailed on board the 'John Wells' to New York, and commenced his fourth 'wandering'. He travelled in Canada and the United States, where he was introduced to the ornithologist George Ord (1781-1866), with whom he regularly corresponded. In the autumn of 1824 Waterton sailed from New York to the West Indies, and passed on to Demerara. Here he proceeded to the forests of the interior, journeyed some 200 miles up-river, and studied jacamars, red grosbeaks, sunbirds, tinamous, and humming-birds, as well as 'vampires', sloths, and monkeys. In January 1825 he completed his final tour of Guiana, and sailed back to Southampton. 
In August 1825 Waterton published his account of the four journeys in a quarto volume, 'Wanderings in South America, the north-west of the United States, and the Antilles in the years 1812, 1816, 1820, and 1824'. The work was reprinted several times, and edited with illustrations and some alterations, by J. G. Wood, in 1879. Details of the 'Waterton method' for preserving natural history specimens were also appended to his travel observations -- the frontispiece of his book represented a human face based on that of a red monkey, which had been modelled using his method. 
In the chapel of the canonesses of St Augustine (an English convent), on the rue des Carmes, Bruges, at 5.30 a.m. on 18 May 1829, Waterton married Anne Mary (1812-1830), second of six children of Charles Edmonstone (died 1827) of Cardross Park, Dumbarton, and his wife, Helen, daughter of William Reid, a timber cutter, and his wife, 'Princess Minda', an Arawak Indian. Waterton had often stayed at Charles Edmonstone's home, Warrows Place, Mibiri Creek, during his visits to Demerara. It was believed that Waterton had vowed, as he attended Anne Mary's baptism some seventeen years earlier, that he would some day marry the child. However, the marriage was short: Anne Mary died on 27 April 1830, the result of puerperal sepsis following the birth of their only child, Edmund. She was buried three days later, in the Waterton family vault at Sandal Magna church (St Helen's). Waterton placed a picture of St Catharine of Alexandria, which resembled his wife, over a mantelpiece at Walton Hall, and to the end of his life often fixed his eyes on it as he sat by the fire. His wife's sisters, Eliza Edmonstone (1807-1870) and Helen Edmonstone (1813-1879), took over the running of the house for him until he died. Eliza and Helen died at Ostend and Bruges, respectively; both were unmarried. 
In 1830 Waterton travelled on the continent. During these travels he bought a collection of paintings from a Herr Berwind at Wurzburg, and also revisited Bruges on his way home. In the summer of 1833 he paid another visit to Belgium, accompanied by his sisters-in-law, son, and two servants. In 1838 he published the first series of his 'Essays in Natural History', which were followed in 1844 by a second series, and in 1857 by a third series. Several of the essays first appeared in John Claudius Loudon's 'Magazine of Natural History' and Waterton gave the proceeds from his second series to Mrs Loudon following her husband's sudden death in 1843. Each series of essays was preceded by a portion of autobiography, and while a few essays focused on tropical subjects, the majority examined English birds and wild animals. His 'Essays', including thirty-six of his letters, and a biography written by his close friend Sir Norman Moore (1847-1922) were published in 1870. 
Waterton again travelled on the continent in 1840. However, on this occasion he was joined at Cologne by his friend Alexander Fletcher (1808-1888), with whom he journeyed to Rome. Waterton spent the winter of 1840-41 in Rome, where he attended mass at four o'clock every morning in the church of the Gesu, made many ornithological observations, and collected specimens of local birds. He started back to England on 10 June 1841, but was shipwrecked in the 'Pollux' near Elba on the night of 17 June 1841, and returned to Italy. He departed for England from Rome for a second time, on 20 July 1841, visiting many places 'en route', including Aix-la-Chapelle. In later years he often visited Aix-la-Chapelle in addition to trips to Scarborough in the autumn and Stonyhurst College at Christmas. 
In 1844 Waterton made another journey across continental Europe, in particular to Austria and Italy. The following year he was awarded the knighthood of the supreme order of Christ from Dom Miguel, exiled king of Portugal. He returned home in June 1845, and in November that year accompanied his sisters-in-law to Madeira, where he stayed until January the next year. During this period he made numerous improvements at Walton Hall, including a new garden and a pigeon-cot, and in 1855 he improved the drainage of the lake. 
Waterton lived on good terms with his neighbours, and at Walton Hall he exercised a continuous and genial hospitality. As penance, following the death of his wife, he slept on the bare floor of a small room at the top of the house, using a wooden block as a pillow, and a military cloak or blanket for a covering. He rose at three, lit his fire, and lay down for half an hour while it burned up. He then dressed, spending from four to five in the morning in his chapel. He then read a chapter on the life of St Francis Xavier, and one on Don Quixote, both in Spanish, and wrote letters or stuffed birds until eight, when he breakfasted. He dined at half-past one and had tea at six and spent a great part of the day in his park. He kept his hair very short, indoors he wore an old-fashioned swallow-tailed coat, refusing to adopt the formal fashion of his day, and also wore shoes several sizes too large. Until very late in life he continued to climb trees, and was said to impress friends by scratching the back of his head with his big toe. 
On 25 May 1865 Waterton tripped and fell; the accident resulted in considerable internal injuries, from which he died at Walton Hall two days later. He was buried on 3 June 1865 (his birthday), between two old oaks, on the lake-shore in his park, under a stone cross which he had erected in the previous year, and which bore the epitaph 'Orate pro anima: Caroli Waterton: cujus fessa juxta hanc crucem sepeliuntur ossa' ('Pray for the soul of Charles Waterton, whose wearied bones lie beneath this cross'). A permanent display was dedicated to Waterton at the Wakefield Museum. 
Waterton's only child, 
Having run up large debts, Edmund Waterton sold Walton Hall (which later became Waterton Park Hotel) in 1876 (although his father's natural history collection was preserved at Alston Hall, near Preston). In 1879 he purchased Deeping Waterton Hall, Market Deeping, Lincolnshire, which later became the Old Manor House, and all except the chapel became the property of the Xaverian brothers. On 15 November 1881 he married his second wife, Ellen, only child of John Mercer of Alston Hall; they had two daughters. 
Edmund Waterton wrote several essays on the devotion to the Blessed Virgin in England, formed a collection of rings, many of which went to the British Museum at South Kensington, and collected editions, printed and manuscript, of the 'De imitatione Christi'. He also published a brief description of some of his rings. When abroad he would use the obsolete title of twenty-seventh lord of Walton on his visiting cards. 
In 1858, like his father before him, Waterton was admitted as knight of the supreme order of Christ. He was also a knight of Malta, papal privy chamberlain, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He died after a long illness, on 22 July 1887, and was buried in the Waterton chapel, in Deeping Waterton, with his first wife. He was survived by his second wife, who died on 10 January 1909; she was buried in the Mercer family vault at Alston Lane.

Edmund Waterton (1830-1887), antiquary, was born on 7 April 1830, at Walton Hall. In September 1841 he was sent to be educated, like his father, at Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1850. Throughout his life he was a devout Roman Catholic. He married twice. His first wife, whom he married on 20 August 1862, while his father and aunts, Eliza and Helen, were abroad at Aix-la-Chapelle, was Josephine Margaret Alicia (died 1879), second daughter of Sir John Ennis, of Ballinahown Court, co. Westmeath. The couple had two sons and four daughters.

Waterworth, William (1811-1882), Jesuit and historian, was born at St Helens, Lancashire, on 22 June 1811. He was educated at the Jesuit college at Stonyhurst in Lancashire, where he was admitted to the Society of Jesus on 26 March 1829. In 1833 he was appointed master of the grammar school opened by the society in London. After starting his theological training at Stonyhurst seminary, he was ordained priest there in 1836; he completed his studies at the Collegio Romano in Rome, where he passed his 'examen ad gradum' in theology. From December 1838 to 5 January 1841 he was professor of dogmatic theology at Stonyhurst. He professed the four vows on 2 July 1850. 
Waterworth served as a priest in Hereford until 1854, where he wrote a number of historical and apologetic works. In 1852 his 'The Jesuits, or, An examination of the origin, progress, principles and practices of the Society of Jesus' was published in London, and in 1854 he brought out 'England and Rome, or, The history of the religious connexion between England and the Holy See, from... 179 to the... Anglican Reformation in 1534', 'Origin and Developments of Anglicanism', and 'On the Gradual Absorption of Early Anglicanism by Popedom'. In 1854 he became rector of the church of the Immaculate Conception in Farm Street, London. Three years later he was sent to the mission at Worcester, and appointed superior of the College of St George, where he remained until 1878. During this period he published 'The Church of St Patrick... a History of the... Ancient Church of Ireland' (1869) and 'Queen Elizabeth versus the lord chancellor... a history of the prayer book of the Church of England' (1871). He was appointed spiritual father of the College of St Ignatius in London in September 1879, and in November 1880 he was appointed to the mission at Bournemouth, where he died on 17 March 1882. He was buried at Stapehill, near Wimborne, Dorset.

Wath, Michael (d. 1350), administrator, probably belonged to a family that came originally from Wath upon Dearne in Yorkshire. He first appears in 1314 as an attorney and won his first ecclesiastical patronage from the crown in 1316. By 1323 he was described as 'constantly attendant on the king's service in chancery' ('CPR', '1321-4', 337), and was clerk to Henry Cliffe, keeper of the rolls of chancery, by 5 May 1329. On 3 February 1330 he received, by papal provision, a canonry and prebend of Southwell in addition to his rectorship of Wath, and to them was added a canonry and prebend at St John's, Howden, in March 1331. He maintained close links with his home county, being appointed to assess a tallage in Yorkshire on 25 June 1332, and serving as supervisor of the taxes of a ninth and fifteenth there in 1340. Wath became keeper of the rolls on 20 January 1334, and on 17 April was presented to the living of Foston in Yorkshire. He surrendered the office of keeper of the rolls on 28 April 1337, and served as keeper of the great seal between 8 December 1339 and 16 February 1340. In December 1340 he was removed from his post in the chancery by Edward III, with other clerks and judges, and imprisoned on a charge of maladministration, but was afterwards released. Although not reappointed to the chancery, he continued to serve on various royal commissions in the 1340s. He died in 1350.

Wathen, James (bap. 1752, d. 1828), artist and pedestrian, was baptized on 1 July 1752 in the parish church of All Saints, Hereford, the son of Thomas Wathen (died 1779), a glover of the city, and his wife, Dorothy Taylor (died 1801) of Bristol. According to the Revd Richard Warner's 'Literary Recollections', Wathen's education was 'humble' but based upon 'considerable English reading' (1.383). Wathen worked in the trade of gloving until his middle years, but at an early age became 'an ardent admirer of Nature, and all her wild and picturesque scenery' (ibid.), making frequent excursions into the Herefordshire countryside with his sketchbook. With a pencil and simple washes it was said that he could produce up to twenty views a day. These sketches, which were often dated and were frequently framed in coloured paper, were presented to his friends, who knew him as Jemmy Sketch; certainly naive, they have the freshness of the work of a self-taught primitivist. Wathen painted everyday scenes and took a particular delight in vernacular architecture, recording virtually all the timber-framed buildings of his native city. His earliest sketch in a public collection is dated 1779, but his most prolific period in Herefordshire was the 1790s. 
Wathen appears to have offered his services as a guide to artists and tourists who wished to make expeditions down the River Wye, making a 'minute delineation of the course of the river, its picturesque points and the objects of curiosity in the neighbourhood' (R. Warner, 'A Walk through Wales, August 1797', 1799, 213). On these trips he frequently obtained paintings and sketches from notable artists and thus assembled his own collection of topographical art. His work became well known to the general public via the 'Gentleman's Magazine'. Two sketches were published in June 1787 that depicted the collapsed west end of Hereford Cathedral and these were followed by four views of the cathedral, engraved by S. Middiman and F. Jukes, 'before, during and after the collapse' ('Hereford Journal', 19 Sept 1787). These were highly regarded and were recommended to John Britton for his 'History and Antiquities of the Cathedral Church of Hereford' (1831), although they were not used. During his lifetime Wathen provided many sketches for guidebooks to Wales and the marches, and his contributions to the 'Gentleman's Magazine' included accounts and engravings of Aconbury chapel, Kilpeck church, Marden church, Burghope House, Longworth chapel, White Cross (Hereford), Dore Abbey, and Putley Cross. 
In 1801 Wathen inherited Aconbury Court from his uncle and namesake, James Wathen, which enabled him to buy a fine property -- Aylestone Hill House -- in the suburbs of Hereford, where he lived until his death. Emancipated from gloving, he embarked upon a series of long-distance walking tours: sketchbooks survive for a northern tour to Scotland in 1808 and a south-western tour in 1825. His stamina on these tours became legendary. He could travel 32 miles a day and outpace the horses upon which his companions travelled. The horses required 'two hours to bait, whereas Mr. W wanted only an hour' ('GM', 282). He was a vegetarian and never drank wine, beer, or spirits; tea was his principal refreshment. 
In 1811 Wathen sailed with an old school friend, Captain James Prendergast, to India and China, and he published in 1814 'Journal of a Voyage to India and China' in two volumes, illustrated with twenty-four coloured prints from drawings by the author. It was well reviewed by the 'Gentleman's Magazine' as 'a plain unvarnished tale' (Warner, 1.387). Wathen also intended to publish an account of his European tour on which he was cordially received by Byron but his numerous sketches for this remain, unpublished, in Hereford City Library. In 1821 he capitalized on Napoleon's exile to St Helena by publishing 'A Series of Views Illustrative of the Island of St Helena', which he had compiled on his return journey from the east in 1812. The book's frontispiece was a print of a portrait of Wathen painted by A. J. Oliver (1774-1842). Wathen made a trip to Heligoland in 1827 and in the following spring he completed his fortieth walk to London. He returned to Hereford and died at his home there on 20 August 1828 in his seventy-sixth year. The 'Gentleman's Magazine' ran a long obituary which began: 'The loss of this ingenious and worthy gentleman will be deeply regretted by a most numerous acquaintance in all parts of the United Kingdom; for in all parts of the country was he known by his talents as a Draftsman, and his pleasant and social manners as a friend. ('GM', 281)' His will revealed the extent of his art collection and he made numerous bequests to his friends, including the artist David Cox, of works by artists including Thomas Gainsborough, Alfred Nicholson, John 'Warwick' Smith, Nicholas Pocock, and John Glover. His executors were requested to present sixty or seventy of Wathen's drawings to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, where they can still be seen. The most substantial collection of his works is in Hereford City Library; Hereford Record Office and the bishop's library, Hereford, also have collections.

Watkin, William Thompson (1836-1888), archaeologist, born at Salford on 15 October 1836, was the son of John Watkin of Salford. His mother, Mary Hamilton, daughter of Benjamin Brierley, was born at Portsmouth, USA. He received his education at private schools, and afterwards became a merchant in Liverpool, where his family had connections: he was the second cousin of Sir Edward William Watkin (1819-1901), the great railway promoter and entrepreneur. From early life, however, Watkin was very interested in archaeology and particularly in the Roman period in north-west England. From 1884 he was a council member and from 1885 honorary librarian of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, and also an active council member of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society from its foundation in 1883. 
Watkin was a very prolific writer on archaeological and antiquarian subjects, and published no fewer than 123 books and articles between 1871 and 1888. Most of these were concerned with the Roman occupation, his interests extending beyond the north-west to include Yorkshire and Northumbria, but his most important works were the twin volumes on 'Roman Lancashire' (1883) and 'Roman Cheshire' (1886), both of which are still widely used and cited. He was a most careful observer, not given to speculation or assumption, and for this reason his notes and writings are regarded as more reliable and trustworthy than those of most of his contemporaries. Valuable unpublished notes on Roman remains in north Wales and in various English counties and other manuscripts were purchased by subscription after Watkin's death and presented to Chetham's Library, Manchester. 
On 6 July 1871 Watkin, who was already a widower, married Amelia Runcorn, a widow, daughter of William Broome, a brick merchant, and in 1872 they had a son, William, but Amelia died shortly afterwards and he then married, on 19 June 1876, Marion Smart, daughter of Henry Beeston, a stationer. With his third wife he had two sons and two daughters. He died on 23 March 1888 at his home, 55 Prescot Street, Liverpool, and was buried at Anfield cemetery. His third wife survived him.

Watkins, Charles (d. 1808), lawyer and legal writer, was the youngest son of Revd William Watkins of Gelli in Llanwytherine parish, Monmouthshire. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 10 June 1803. However, he practised from 1799 as a certificated conveyancer until his death. 
During his lifetime Watkins was author of some able treatises on aspects of the law. These included an account of the powers of the king, as guardian of the duchy of Cornwall, as well as a study of the law of descents (1793). His 'Reflections on Government in General' appeared in 1796. Watkins also edited the introduction (on the feudal system) for the fourth edition of Sir Geoffrey Gilbert's 'Law of Tenures' (1796). Two further works no doubt arose from his professional practice. These were 'A Treatise on Copyholds' (2 vols., 1797-9) and also 'Principles of Conveyancing, Designed for the Use of Students' (1800). This work went into at least nine editions by 1845, and was regarded as 'a masterly and practical sketch' (Allibone, 'Dict.', 3.2602). Watkins died at Gloucester on 15 January 1808.

Watkins, Charles Frederick (1795-1873), writer and Church of England clergyman, was born on 16 January 1795 at Corsley, Wiltshire, the youngest son of the Revd William R. Watkins of Court Coleman and rector of Port Eynon, Glamorgan. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, London, and in 1810 he joined the frigate 'Hotspur' as midshipman and was engaged in teaching the midshipmen mathematics and natural science, but left the service at the peace of 1815. He entered Christ's College, Cambridge, as a 'ten-year man' on 29 January 1818 and was ordained as a literate; although he was admitted for holy orders, he never took the BD degree. After serving curacies at Downton, Wiltshire (1818-19), and Windsor (1820-21), he was appointed in 1822 as warden of Farley Hospital, Salisbury, where he stayed until 1832. During this time (1822-32) he also held the post of curate at West Grimstead and Plaitford, Wiltshire. 
Watkins was interested in geology and formed a collection of cretaceous fossils, some of which are in museums at Oxford and Cambridge and in the British Museum, London. In April 1832 he became vicar of Brixworth, Northamptonshire, and held this office until his death. While living there he communicated to the Royal Society an 'Account of Aurora borealis of 17 Nov 1848' ('PRS', 5 1843-50, 809). In keeping with his scientific interests he also wrote 'A Treatise on the Leading Causes of Pleasure and Delight in the Human Mind' (1841) and 'A Scientific and General Vindication of the Mosaic History of the Creation' (1867). He also demonstrated an attention to social issues and published various prose pamphlets, including 'An address to the labouring population, on the folly and wickedness of burning agricultural property' (1831). His works of poetry include 'Sacred Poems' (1829), 'The Human Hand, and other Poems' (1852), and 'The Twins of Fame, or, Wellington and Buonaparte: a National Poem' (1854). Watkins died at Brixworth on 15 July 1873 and was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and at least one son, Justinian Charles Secundus Watkins ('b'. 1845).

Watkins, John (fl. c.1786-1831), writer, born in Devon, was educated at Bristol for the nonconformist ministry. Becoming dissatisfied, he joined the Church of England about 1786 with his friend Samuel Badcock (1747-1788) and for some years ran an academy in Devon. His first independent publication appeared in 1792, entitled 'An Essay towards the History of Bideford'. The work was of great local interest, containing among other things an account of the depositions in a trial for witchcraft held at Exeter on 14 August 1682. In 1796 he published 'The Peeper: a Collection of Essays, Moral, Biographical, and Literary', which was dedicated to Hannah More. Watkins showed great interest in biography, even compiling a 'Universal Biographical and Historical Dictionary', which appeared in 1800. It went through several editions by 1827, and was translated into French, with additions, in 1803 by Jean Baptiste L'Ecuy of Paris. Among similar compilations are 'Characteristic Anecdotes of Men of Learning and Genius' (1808) and 'Boydell's heads of illustrious and celebrated persons, from the reign of Queen Elizabeth to William III, with biographical memoirs' (1812). Watkins's 'Memoirs of Sheridan' (1816) was the first life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan to be published. Other memoirs published by him were 'Memoirs of Queen Sophia Charlotte' (1819); 'Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Lord Byron' (1822), translated into German in 1825; 'A Biographical Memoir of... Frederick, Duke of York and Albany' (1827); and 'The Life and Times of 'England's Patriot King', William IV' (1831). He also translated from the Latin George Buchanan's 'History of Scotland', adding a continuation (1827), and wrote a memoir of Hugh Latimer, prefixed to his 'Sermons' (1824). On the title pages of his later publications, Watkins is described as LLD but from where he obtained the degree is unknown. So is the date of his death, the last that is known of him being a preface dated 30 May 1831. He moved to London soon after beginning his literary work, about 1794, and it is possible that he died there.

Watkins, Morgan (d. in or after 1672), Quaker preacher, was of Wigmore Grange, then Eyton, Herefordshire, though little else is known of his early life and background. On 7 May 1653 he was one of the signatories to a 'Letter from the People of Herefordshire to the Lord General Cromwell', expressing allegiance to the protector and pledging to 'attend' him with their 'persons, petitions, purses, lives and all that is dear to us' (Nickolls, 92). 
Watkins was evidently a Quaker by 1657, for in that year George Fox met him at a meeting in Radnorshire and noted that he had become 'loving to Friends' ('Journal of George Fox', 1.274). About 1658 he defended the Quaker notion of perfection at a disputation with the Baptist Vavasour Powell, details of which are given in 'The Perfect Life of the Son of God Vindicated' (1658). In this Watkins protested that 'they that live in sin, and plead for it term of life, are all blind' (p. 4). 
In 1660 Watkins was a prisoner in St Albans gaol, during which time he wrote 'Swearing Denied in the New Covenant' [1660] which concerned the Quaker rejection of oaths. By July 1663 he was preaching in London at the Quaker meeting in Pall Mall and elsewhere. On 12 March 1665 he was sent to Newgate from the Bull and Mouth meeting, St Martin's-le-Grand. Two other imprisonments followed during the year, one at Westmorland, after a meeting at Elizabeth Strong's house, and another of about three months' duration at the Gatehouse prison, near Westminster Abbey, on a warrant of 9 August from the duke of Albemarle for attendance at a meeting with nine others. His letters to Mary Penington vividly describe the visitation of the plague both inside and outside prisons. On 18 September 1665 he wrote to her saying, 'the miseries that are upon many here are hardly to be uttered' (Barclay, 149). A later letter written on 5 December revealed that he had experienced 'several battles with death' while imprisoned in London (ibid., 156). 
Afterwards Watkins preached and was imprisoned in Buckinghamshire, details of which are given in Thomas Ellwood's 'Life' (1714). In 1666 he was accused by Justice Ambrose Bennett of being a Jesuit, for 'in his Preaching' the latter felt 'he trolled over his Latin as fluently as ever he heard anyone', though Ellwood states that Watkins was 'better Versed in Welch, than in Latin' (p. 249). Watkins and five others were committed to Aylesbury gaol, but owing to the plague were sent to the High Wycombe house of correction, where they were kept from 13 March to 7 June 1666. They refused to be bound over for their appearance at the next assizes and were sent back to the gaol until 25 June, when they were released by proclamation. Ellwood notes that while in prison he made 'Nets for Kitchin-Service, to boil Herbs, &c. in; which Trade I learned of Morgan Watkins' (ibid., 251). He also related that they 'kept a fair and Brotherly Correspondence, as became Friends, Prison-fellows and Bed-fellows' (ibid., 252). By 1670, some time after his incarceration, Watkins appears to have returned to Herefordshire when cattle and goods were distrained from his farm. 
Watkins wrote a few more tracts in addition to those listed above, for example 'The Children of Abraham's Faith', written with Francis Gawler in 1663, of interest for its discussion of Quaker burials and in which Friends' practice was compared with that of the holy men of former ages. Other works include 'A Lamentation over England' (1664), regarding persecution of Quakers, and 'The Marks of the True Church' (1675). 
Watkins died at some point after 20 June 1672, at which time he attended Somerset quarterly meeting at Ilchester.

Alexander Watson (1815/16-1865), Church of England clergyman, a son of Joseph Watson, was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1837 and MA in 1840. After proceeding to Durham University, he passed as a licentiate in theology and was ordained as curate of St Andrew's, Ancoats, Manchester. In 1840 he took charge of St John's, Cheltenham, where he established schools. He published a number of devotional works of a high-Anglican type, including 'The Devout Churchman, or, Daily Meditations' (2 vols., 1847). In 1851 he became vicar of St Mary Church-with-Coffinswell, Devon. He was married and had at least one son, born in 1853. On moving to the rectory of Bridestow and Sourton, near Oakhampton, Devon, in 1855, he borrowed money which led to the sequestration of the living and to his quitting it at the end of two years for the incumbency of Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury, London. He was involved in a chancery suit concerning the chapel, became insolvent, and was declared bankrupt on 11 January 1862, but was discharged on 21 February 1862. During 1863-4 he assisted the ritualist clergyman John Charles Chambers at St Mary's, Soho, and in 1864 took charge of Middleton on the Wolds, near Beverley, Yorkshire. He died at Middleton on 1 February 1865.

Watson, James (1739/40?-1790), engraver, was born in Dublin of unknown parentage and received his early training in the schools of the Dublin Society. He went to London as a young man, probably as a pupil to his fellow Irishman James Macardell. He became a very fine engraver in mezzotint, his plates delicate and carefully finished. He exhibited with the Society of Artists from 1762 until 1775, and during those two decades was regarded as a leading master. He was a fellow of the society and a director in 1770. After 1765 he inherited Macardell's role as principal engraver to Joshua Reynolds, and interpreted fifty-six of his paintings in sixty plates. His work included notable portraits of friends of Reynolds such as Edmund Burke and Samuel Johnson, as well as expensive, full-length society portraits. He also scraped many excellent mezzotints from pictures by Gainsborough, Cotes, Catherine Read, Van Dyck, Metsu, Schalken, Rubens, and others. Most early plates were published by major printsellers such as Ryland and Bryer, Bowles, Sayer, and Parker and Bakewell, but Watson began to publish some of his own work about 1762, at first from the Golden Head, in Craven Buildings, off Drury Lane. By 1766 he was at 45 Little Queen Anne Street, from which he moved in 1775 to no. 64. He had done well enough by 1778 to be living in semi-retirement. Among his last work was six plates for Boydell's 'Houghton Gallery'. In a working life of thirty years he scraped 200 plates, the vast majority being portraits. Goodwin writes: 'these are notable achievements, brilliant in their lights, luminous in their shadows, delicate in the modelling of the flesh, rich in the draperies' (Goodwin, 73). 
Watson's marriage to Mary ('b. c.'1740), daughter of Reuben Judkins, produced a daughter, Caroline Watson (1760/61-1814), who studied under her father and achieved fame in her own right, and a son, James Edmund Watson, who became a lawyer. Mary predeceased him; at the time of his death, probably in Fitzroy Street, London, on 20 or 22 May 1790, Watson was still paying interest on the sum of $200 that he had borrowed from his sister-in-law Elizabeth Judkins; this loan was transferred to Caroline, the remainder of his estate being divided between his children. He was buried in St Marylebone cemetery.

Watson, James (1766-1838), radical, was born on 15 May 1766 at Kirton, near Boston, Lincolnshire. He claimed to be a surgeon by profession, but financial security seems to have eluded him in a succession of surgeon-apothecary shops in London and the provinces. He married Ann Milner on 4 February 1790 in London and had ten children, born in London, Yorkshire, Norfolk, and Staffordshire. Family circumstances deteriorated when the Watsons finally settled in London around 1808, having quit an ailing business in Cheadle, Staffordshire. In 1810 one of Watson's daughters died 'for want of nourishment... while ill, the bed that was under her was seized for rent... This was too much when the affluent were wallowing in riches' (TNA: PRO, TS11/200/869). Then his wife departed, taking the four youngest, and allegedly mistreated, children. Abandoning sobriety and political conservatism, Watson formed a 'connection' with his neighbour Thomas Evans, founder of the Society of Spencean Philanthropists. As expounded by Evans in the London taverns, Thomas Spence's 'plan' for political equality and social welfare through parish ownership of land held out the promise of respectability and independent self-sufficiency for marginal middle-class professionals such as Watson. As war with Napoleonic France gave way to peace without plenty, Watson sought to carry the message beyond tavern debating clubs, to transform popular discontent into mass political insurgency. Through his efforts to mobilize what he called 'ragged radicals', Watson emerged as the leader of London ultra-radicalism. 
Having joined Thomas Preston and Arthur Thistlewood in insurrectionary planning in autumn 1816, Watson combed alehouses to enlist navvies, demobilized soldiers, dock workers, gangs of roughs, the unemployed, and other physically intimidating groups, while his eldest son, also called James, put his recent seafaring experience to good use in recruiting discharged sailors. As a well-attended public meeting was regarded as the best springboard for action, all the leading reform celebrities were invited to a meeting of 'Distressed Manufacturers, Mariners, Artisans and others' at Spa Fields on 15 November 1816. Henry Hunt alone accepted, having satisfied himself that he was not being drawn into a revolutionary Spencean plot to abolish private property in land. 
In a private interview with Watson, Hunt dictated terms: no reference to Spencean principles and no incitement to riot. The meeting would be strictly 'constitutional', enrolling the distressed masses in an extra-parliamentary campaign for universal suffrage, annual parliaments, and the ballot. In acceding, Watson formed a working agreement with Hunt which was to facilitate the remarkable expansion of political agitation in the post-war years. The establishment of this radical mass platform, however, revealed ideological, tactical, social, and cultural tensions in metropolitan ultra-radicalism. While Evans withdrew into refined and respectable circles to uphold the ideological integrity of the Spencean formulary, other ultra-radicals, heirs to the traditional 'putsch' strategy of Colonel Despard and the wartime underground, wanted immediate action. Denied this opportunity on 15 November, Thistlewood and the young Watson ensured that a second meeting was called so that they could go ahead with their original plan to inflame the assembled crowd and then storm the Bank of England and Tower of London. Unable to control his son, who had been treated in Bath for insanity, Watson was drawn into the scheme. To Thistlewood's fury, however, Watson was not to the fore in the actual attempt, on 2 December 1816. He took off in a separate direction as the small section of the crowd, detached by Thistlewood and the young Watson before Hunt had arrived at Spa Fields, looted its way across London until fleeing in the face of troops at the Tower. The ignominious failure of precipitate insurrectionism reinforced Watson's commitment to cumulative mass platform agitation to mobilize the people before decisive confrontation. 
Watson's son escaped to the United States, leaving his father to face a charge of high treason. Aided by recent press revelations about Oliver the spy, Watson was acquitted in June 1817, when one of his own recruits, John Castle, was revealed as a government informer with a previous unsavoury record of brothel-keeping, bigamy, forgery, and blood money. Thereafter Watson's position was consolidated by close co-operation with Hunt in the Westminster election of 1818, and in the absence of Thistlewood, who was imprisoned for challenging Lord Sidmouth to a duel. As undisputed leader of the ultra-radicals, Watson channelled his energies into the Universal Union Fund of the Non-Represented People of Great Britain and Ireland, a penny-a-week subscription scheme to provide the necessary means -- funds, organization, and rapid communication -- to mobilize the labouring poor in readiness for confrontation and a national convention. Important links were forged with provincial radicals, trade unionists, and Irish immigrants, but the promotion of the scheme in pamphlets and in the short-lived 'Shamrock, Thistle and Rose', a twopenny monthly, overstretched Watson's limited resources, leading to his brief imprisonment for debt in December 1818. 
On release, Watson worked closely with Hunt in the great platform campaign of 1819, an attempt to overawe the government by an overwhelming but orderly display of popular support. He organized mass meetings, introduced a new parish-based system of organization among the non-represented, strengthened links with the Irish immigrant community, drafted resolutions for meetings in the north, and even prevailed upon Thistlewood, on his release, to abandon armed conspiracy in favour of the forcible intimidation of the mass platform. The success of Hunt's August meeting in Manchester, planned as the climax of provincial support, was essential to the strategy. After Hunt set off for Lancashire, Watson kept him informed by post of traps and rumours, but most of his time was spent on plans for a monster 'final meeting' in London on Hunt's return. When news reached London of the Peterloo massacre, Watson was briefly drawn towards a broad reform alliance, joining 'respectable' radicals in planning a suitable reception for Hunt on his return to London. In a mixture of vanity and political calculation, however, Hunt used the dinner after his triumphal entry to dissociate himself from any suggestion of Spenceanism or levelling. Outraged by this deliberate snub, Watson engaged in an unseemly polemic with Hunt, a sorry end to their working alliance. 
Beneath the obloquy there was a fundamental disagreement. Looking to the courts and public opinion, Hunt wanted to rest the radical case on Peterloo itself, eschewing any further platform agitation which might sully the moral victory gained at Manchester. Watson, by contrast, sought to exploit popular anger at the massacre through immediate escalation of platform agitation, combining the various tactics of ultra-radicalism, armed simultaneous meetings, tax refusal, and a national convention. Undermined by Hunt, these proposals were abandoned in favour of traditional conspiratorial ways and means. Soon after the introduction of the repressive 'Six Acts', Thistlewood was entrapped by an 'agent provocateur' in the Cato Street conspiracy, a plot to assassinate the cabinet at dinner ['see 'Cato Street conspirators (act. 1820)]. Watson was not involved, as he was again imprisoned for debt, this time for non-payment of Hunt's dinner bill! However, he drew up an address to soldiers and a proclamation to the people to be issued once the blow was struck. 
Thereafter little is known of Watson's political career, although he briefly returned to prominence in the later stages of the Queen Caroline affair, by heading the funeral procession for the two workmen killed by troops escorting the queen's cortege. In the late 1820s he was a regular speaker at the 'Liberals', a debating-cum-literary group which attracted old Jacobins, Spenceans, and ultra-radicals. Some time afterwards he left for America, possibly to join his son. Watson died a pauper in New York on 12 February 1838.

Watson, James (1799-1874), radical and publisher, was born at Malton, Yorkshire, on 21 September 1799. His father died when he was barely a year old. His mother, 'a Sunday school teacher', taught him to read and write. About 1811 she returned to domestic service in the family of a clergyman who had paid for James's schooling for a period. The boy became under-gardener, stable-help, and house servant, and acquired a strong taste for reading over the kitchen fire in winter evenings. About 1817 the parson's household was broken up, and Watson accompanied his mother to Leeds, where he became a warehouseman. Two years later he was converted to free thought and radicalism by public readings from Cobbett and Richard Carlile. For the next few years he took an active part in disseminating advanced literature and in getting up a subscription on behalf of Carlile. 
After Carlile was sentenced in 1821 to three years' imprisonment for blasphemy, Watson went to London in September 1822 to serve as a volunteer assistant in his Water Lane bookshop. In January 1823 Carlile's wife, having completed her term of imprisonment, took a new shop at 210 Strand. Watson moved there, still in the capacity of salesman. The occupation was a perilous one, and, despite all the precautions taken, salesman after salesman was arrested. This fate overtook Watson at the end of February 1823. He was charged with 'maliciously' selling a copy of Palmer's 'Principles of Nature' to a police agent, and, having made an eloquent speech in his own defence, was sent to Coldbath Fields prison for a year. There he read Hume, Gibbon, and Mosheim's 'Ecclesiastical History', and was strongly confirmed in his anti-Christian and republican opinions. During 1825 he became a compositor, and was employed in printing Carlile's 'Republican', and for some time in conducting his business. In the intervals of work he suffered privation, and in 1826 was struck down by cholera. When he recovered, he became a convert to the co-operative schemes of Robert Owen, and in 1828 he was storekeeper of the First Co-operative Trading Association in London in Red Lion Square and was a member of the British Association for the Promotion of Co-operation (1829-35) and the National Union of the Working Classes (1831-8). He became a bookseller in 1830 and worked with Hetherington, Cleave, and Lovett in the production and the distribution of the 'Poor Man's Guardian'. In December 1832 he launched the 'Working Man's Friend and Political Magazine', an influential journal advocating factory legislation, universal suffrage, and repeal of both the newspaper duty and the union with Ireland. 
In 1831 Watson set up as a printer and publisher, and the following year he was arrested and narrowly escaped imprisonment for organizing a procession and a feast on the day the government had ordained 'a general fast' on account of the ravages of the cholera. In February 1833 he was summoned at Bow Street for selling Hetherington's 'Poor Man's Guardian', and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment at Clerkenwell. His championship of the right to free expression of opinion had won him admirers, and one of these, Julian Hibbert, on his death in January 1834, left Watson 450 guineas, with which sum he promptly enlarged his printing plant. He made a bold start by printing the life and works of Tom Paine, and these volumes were followed by Mirabaud's 'System of Nature' and Volney's 'Ruins of Empires'. Later he printed Byron's 'Cain' and 'Vision of Judgment', Shelley's 'Queen Mab' and 'Masque of Anarchy', and Clark on the miracles of Christ. All these were printed, corrected, folded, and sewn by Watson himself, and issued at 1's'. or less per volume. His shop near Bunhill Fields (from where he removed first to the City Road, and in 1843 to 5 Paul's Alley) was well known to all the leading radicals of the day, and he had 'pleasant and informing words for all who sought his wares'. 
Watson married Eleanor Byerley on 3 June 1834, and two months later was arrested and imprisoned for six months for having circulated Hetherington's unstamped paper, the ironically entitled 'Conservative'. He had a little earlier come under government surveillance as a leader in the great April meeting of trade unions in support of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. He bore imprisonment with resignation: 'I love privacy', he wrote to his wife. This was his last imprisonment, though he continued without intermission to issue books upon the government 'index'. 
In 1836 Watson helped to found the Working Men's Association, and in June 1837 he was on the committee appointed to draw up the 'People's Charter'. He opposed both physical force and the overtures made to whig partisans, whom he consistently denounced for their selfishness. He remained constant in his demands for 'the charter, the whole charter, and nothing but the charter'. In 1848 he was one of the conveners of the first public meeting to celebrate the French revolution of that year. In 1847 he had given his adherence to the People's International League founded by his friend and correspondent Mazzini. 
Frugal, severe, and self-denying in his habits, Watson was a thin, haggard, thoughtful man, with an intellectual face and a grave yet gentle manner. He was a publicist and organizer rather than an editor or leader. He lost money through his publishing, his object being profitable reading for uneducated people rather than personal gain. Yet he cared for the correctness and decent appearance of his books, even the cheapest. 'They were his children, he had none other.' An unstamped and absolutely free press became the practical object of his later years, and he led the Newspaper Stamp Abolition Committee in 1849. 
About 1870 anxiety about the health of his wife induced a serious decline of Watson's own powers. He died at his home, Burns Cottage, Hamilton Road, Lower Norwood, London, on 29 November 1874, and was buried in Norwood cemetery, where a grey granite obelisk erected by friends commemorated his 'brave efforts to secure the rights of free speech'.

Watson, John (d. 1537), college head, was educated at Eton College from about 1479 until 1483, when he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge. He was elected a fellow of King's in 1486, was ordained priest in 1489, and became a fellow of Peterhouse at about the time that the humanist Henry Hornby was appointed master in 1501. He served as junior proctor of the university in 1504 and was made a Lady Margaret preacher in the following year. He was admitted BTh in 1511. He is remembered chiefly as a Cambridge friend and correspondent of Erasmus, who considered Watson a distinguished theologian and consulted him on his edition of the 'Greek Testament'. Erasmus described Watson's character as being 'devout without bigotry, sociable without triviality and strict but not severe' ('Correspondence', 4.181). In 1516 Watson travelled to Venice and the Holy Land in the company of John Reston, recording aspects of life on board ship with other friends of Erasmus. He was admitted rector of Elsworth, Cambridgeshire, on 30 March of the same year, resigning his fellowship at Peterhouse on 6 December. 
In 1517 Watson graduated DTh and was instituted master of Christ's College. In that year he declared in a letter to Erasmus that he had formed 'a solemn resolution to devote the rest of my life exclusively to biblical and sacred studies' ('Correspondence', 4.343). He served as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1518-20 and 1530-32. On 30 April 1523 he was instituted rector of St Mary Woolnoth, London, and on 17 September 1523 became prebendary of Norwell-tertia-pars in the church of Southwell. In 1529 he was one of nearly 200 divines selected to answer, for Cambridge University, Henry VIII's questions about his divorce; he is not listed as one of those favourable to the king. In May 1530 he was one of twenty-four divines selected to examine certain English books feared to contain contentious material on the chief points and articles of religion. One of his fellow examiners was Hugh Latimer who had formerly been Watson's scholar. As master of Christ's, Watson was one of those who opposed Latimer at King's College in 1530. In May 1531, after censuring points made in a sermon by Nicholas Shaxton on Ash Wednesday, Watson, as vice-chancellor, attempted to ensure religious conformity in the university by issuing a decree which imposed an oath on scholars proceeding to degrees in divinity. The list of controversial issues covered by the oath included communion in both kinds, fasting, clerical celibacy, and the authority of the church. The decree was dropped by the next vice-chancellor, Simon Heynes. 
Watson retired to King's College after ceasing to be master of Christ's in 1531 (he was replaced by Cromwell's client, Henry Lockwood). In 1536 he became rector of White Notley, Essex, where probably he died, unmarried, in March of the following year.

Watson, John (c.1520-1584), bishop of Winchester, was born in Evesham, Worcestershire, son of Thomas Watson and his wife, Agnes, 'nee' Weekes. He had three surviving brothers, William, Thomas, and Robert, and six sisters. The family was of some means as he bequeathed silver plate left to him by his father and a house in Bengeworth, near Evesham. Watson was educated at Oxford, graduating BA in June 1539. Admitted a fellow of All Souls in 1540 he incepted MA in February 1545. On 9 December 1551 he received letters patent for the eleventh prebend in Winchester Cathedral. In April 1554 he was admitted to the rectories of Kelsall, Hertfordshire, and Winchfield, Hampshire, and may have been the man who matriculated at the University of Louvain in June that year. He did not take orders until 1557. On 12 June that year he was ordained to minor orders and as subdeacon, as of Worcester diocese, by Thomas Chetham, bishop of Sidon, suffragan of London, using his parish of Winchfield as his title. Following letters dimissory to take higher orders, issued on 28 August 1557 by Bishop Richard Pates of Worcester, he was ordained deacon in London on 24 September 1558 as of All Souls, although now stated to be of Gloucester diocese. Meanwhile, on 7 February 1558, he had been collated by Edmund Bonner, bishop of London, to the chancellorship of St Paul's, a post he retained until his consecration. Later that year he vacated his Winchester prebend. 
Watson accommodated himself to the Elizabethan settlement and was granted letters patent for the hospital of St Cross, near Winchester, on 17 August 1559, and for the first prebend at Winchester at about the same time. That same month he was one of the few members of the St Paul's chapter to accept the oath of supremacy. Thereafter his rise was surprisingly rapid for one whose career had been actively promoted by Bonner. Becoming archdeacon of Surrey, also by letters patent, on 7 November 1559 he was, perhaps predictably, found on the conservative wing in the convocation of 1562-3. In 1568 he was admitted to the rectory of South Warnborough, Hampshire, and in February 1573 received letters patent for the deanery of Winchester, resigning his archdeaconry and his prebend. On 27 July 1575 he proceeded doctor of medicine at Oxford. 
Watson was evidently on good terms with his bishop, Robert Horne, being named one of the four executors of Horne's will in June 1579. He was elected Horne's successor on 29 June 1580 and consecrated on 18 September, having discovered in the interim that he was expected to pay a substantially higher figure for his first fruits than Horne had negotiated in 1561. Perhaps as a form of compensation he was on 2 December 1580 granted the right to hold the hospital of St Cross for a further three years. 
In November 1580 he began his primary visitation of the diocese but was interrupted by the parliamentary session that ended in March 1581. During this parliament and convocation Watson, along with bishops John Aylmer of London, John Whitgift of Worcester, John Piers of Salisbury, and Thomas Cooper of Lincoln, was ordered by the privy council to investigate the religious sect known as the Family of Love. The government was also much concerned to clamp down on recusancy at this time. In October 1580 Watson had been directed to hold the husbands of women recusants responsible for their wives' conformity, through fines if necessary. On 22 November he responded that it was surely unreasonable to punish men 'for their wives' faults' (TNA: PRO, SP 12/144/36). 
It was perhaps for that reason, and because of his own Marian past, that he was suspected of leniency towards recusants. The charge would appear to be unjust since the evidence of his brief tenure of Winchester is largely concerned with the suppression of Catholicism. In 1580 he interrogated Elizabeth Sander, sister of Dr Nicholas Sander, and in August 1582 the seminary priest John Chapman. In 1583 two local schoolmasters, John Slade and John Body, were condemned at Winchester assizes and executed on 30 October and 2 November 1583 respectively. During the following month Watson and the mayor conducted a house-to-house search, which resulted in the discovery in Lady West's house of a trunk containing all the items necessary for conducting mass. Nothing else is known of his brief episcopate beyond the fact that he seems to have granted a lavish number of episcopal leases and, according to his successor, Thomas Cooper, left the episcopal manors poorly stocked and in a state of decay. 
The unmarried incumbent of a still rich see, Watson was in a position to prove a generous benefactor. In 1582 he contributed $60, his dean and chapter adding $40, to endow the city of Winchester with a fund that would provide interest-free loans to needy freemen. His will, drawn up on 23 October 1583, contained a stream of impressive bequests. He left $40 to All Souls, $20 to Oxford University, 100 marks to the use of the university's poor scholars, and 'exhibitions' of $4 per annum payable over five years to five poor scholars appointed at the discretion of his executors. The poor of Winchester received $20; those of Evesham $10; and those of Bengeworth $5. A stock of $40 was to be set up for the poor of Evesham and of $10 for those of Bengeworth. He also remembered the thirteen poor brothers of St Cross, left $40 for the purchase of books to Winchester Cathedral Library, and bequeathed a horse to his principal overseer, Sir Francis Walsingham. Altogether his monetary legacies to his siblings and their numerous offspring, to proteges and to good causes amounted to about $1000. He left his medical books to a cousin, Simon Tripp. 
Codicils to the will are dated 22 and 23 January 1584 and Watson died at Winchester on the latter day. On 17 February he was buried in his cathedral, as directed in his will, which was proved on 22 June 1584. Thereafter Bishop Cooper managed to extract $530 from his executors towards the repair of the episcopal manors.

Watson, John (1725-1783), Church of England clergyman and antiquary, was born on 26 March 1725 at Lyme Handley in Prestbury, Cheshire, the son of Legh Watson and his wife, Hester, daughter of John Yates of Swinton, Lancashire. He was educated at the grammar schools in Eccles, Wigan, and Manchester before matriculating at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 8 April 1742. He graduated BA in 1745 and MA in 1748, having been elected to a Cheshire fellowship of the college in June 1746. He was ordained deacon in December 1746 and served the curacy of Runcorn for a few months before moving to Ardwick, Manchester, where he also acted as tutor to the family of Samuel Birch. Ordained priest in 1749, he was curate of Halifax from 1750 until September 1754, when he was presented to the perpetual curacy of Ripponden, a chapelry of Halifax parish, where he rebuilt the incumbent's residence at his own expense. 
He married first on 1 June 1752 Susanna Allon (died 1757), daughter of Samuel Allon, vicar of Sandbach, Cheshire, with whom he had a son. After her death he married on 11 July 1761 Ann Jacques, daughter of James Jacques of Leeds; they had a son, who also went to Brasenose, and a daughter. 
Watson's antiquarian activities, particularly on Roman antiquities but also on the barrows of the Halifax area, which he referred to as druidical remains, led to his election as FSA in 1759. He continued these researches, but his time at Ripponden was chiefly occupied in writing a history of Halifax, published in 1775, which became a standard source. His determined whig principles made him unable to read the order of service set out for 30 January in memory of Charles I, though he preached on that anniversary publishing two of his sermons, in 1754 and 1755, in which he set out his views. He also wrote a pamphlet in 1756 critical of the Moravian hymnbook, detailing its non-scriptural elements and regretting what he saw as its emotional, or non-rational, emphasis; however, he ended his critique by wishing the congregation well. At Ripponden he embarked on research at the behest of Sir George Warren of Poynton Lodge, Cheshire, in order to prove that Sir George was the legitimate heir to the earldom of Warenne and Surrey. His 'Memoirs of the Ancient Earls of Warren and Surrey and their Descendants' was published in a limited edition of six copies in 1776, with a second edition of fifteen copies following in 1779, and a third, larger, edition in 1782. Despite Watson's claim in the preface to the work, his researches were unable to establish Warren's right to the title, but this did not deter Sir George from pursuing that claim vigorously, if unsuccessfully, over the next twenty years. 
It was through his whig connections and the patronage of Warren that Watson secured further advancement, first to the rectory of Miningsby, Lincolnshire, in 1766 and then to the valuable living of Stockport, Cheshire, in 1769. There, he continued his antiquarian researches, which now focused on his native county. His extensive papers, deposited at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, John Rylands Library, Manchester, and York Minster Library, have been much used by subsequent writers. A fresh edition of his Halifax history was embarked upon by F. A. Leyland in 1869, but only the first part was published. His interests extended to the collection of literary remains, and he was a noted writer and collector of songs. 
Watson died at Stockport on 14 March 1783, possibly as a consequence of injuries received from a kick by a horse. He was survived by his wife and all three children, and his will was proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury in May of that year.

Watson, John Dawson (1832-1892), painter and illustrator, was born on 20 May 1832 in Sedbergh, Yorkshire, the eldest son of Dawson Watson, a wealthy solicitor, and his wife, Mary Bragg. Watson was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Sedbergh (1842-7), and at the Manchester School of Design between 1847 and 1851, later studying in the London studio of Alexander Davis Cooper and at the Royal Academy Schools. He returned to Manchester in 1852. His first exhibit was 'The Wounded Cavalier' at the Manchester Institution in 1851, followed by 'An Artist's Studio' (which contained portraits of himself, Cooper, and Cooper's family) at the Royal Academy in 1853. 
Watson was predominantly a narrative figure painter, who worked in oils and watercolour and also produced very fluent line drawings. In 1856 he sold a number of works to the Liverpool merchant and art collector John Miller; these pictures attracted the attention of the Pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown, who invited Watson to exhibit at his house in London. Watson was a member of the literary and artistic Letherbrow Club in Manchester from 1857, and over the next two years contributed twelve papers and numerous pen-and-ink drawings to the club's volumes. On 23 November 1858, at Giggleswick, Yorkshire, he married his cousin, Jane Dawson Edmondson ('b'. 'c'.1831), the daughter of Christopher Edmondson, solicitor of Settle, Yorkshire, with whom he had two sons and three daughters. His elder son, Dawson Watson, was a pupil of the Royal Academician Mark Fisher. 
In 1860 Watson settled in London where, a year later, he was commissioned by Routledge to execute 110 black and white drawings, engraved by the Dalziel brothers, for a new edition of 'The Pilgrim's Progress'. These were pronounced by the 'Art Journal' to be of 'uniform excellence' (1861, 46), and made Watson's name in the field of illustration. 'Robinson Crusoe' followed in 1864 as a companion volume. Illustrations by Watson appeared regularly in 'Good Words' (1861-3), 'London Society' (1862-7), 'The Graphic' (1870-77), and other similar periodicals. He was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1864, with full membership in 1869, when he exhibited 'Carrying in the Peacock', which the 'Art Journal' considered 'brilliant as Veronese... Mr. Watson bids fair to become one of our first artists' (1869, 173). A version of this medieval theme was painted as a fresco for the Surrey home of Birket Foster, who had married Watson's sister, Frances, in 1864. 'Raising the Maypole' for another room was never finished, although Watson was living near by in the village of Milford from 1865. 
Early success was said to have made Watson somewhat lazy, and critics were often disappointed with later work. Certainly he did not fully exploit his talent as a theatrical designer. In 1871 he organized an amateur performance of 'Twelfth Night' at Newcastle in aid of victims of the Franco-Prussian War, for which he designed and cut out fifty costumes, and in 1872 he executed sixty-five costume designs in watercolour for a professional production of 'Henry V' at the Princes Theatre, Manchester. Meticulous observation of historical dress was a feature of his work, as in the Elizabethan setting for 'The Poisoned Cup' (exh. RA, 1866), which was awarded a medal at the Vienna International Exhibition in 1873. Watson also painted portraits and contemporary domestic genre scenes, many examples of which were set in and around Cullercoats, Northumberland, and depicted the local fishing community. 'Saved', a sea rescue scene (exh. RA, 1871), achieved exceptional popularity as a print. He was elected an honorary member of the Royal Watercolour Society of Belgium in 1876. 
In 1877 Watson returned to London, from Milford, before settling in Conwy, Caernarvonshire, in 1884, where he was a founder member of the Royal Cambrian Academy. He maintained links with Manchester throughout his life, culminating in a retrospective exhibition at the Brazenose Club in 1877. Exhibits included a new oil painting, 'The Yeoman's Wedding', which was also shown at the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition that year. Works in public collections include 'Sancho Panza' at the Victoria and Albert Museum and 'Bubbles' (a characteristic study of children) at the Cecil Higgins Gallery, Bedford. There are examples in Manchester City Galleries and holdings at Conwy, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Norwich, and Worcester. More than sixty of Watson's works remain, many on public view, at the Castle Hotel, Conwy, together with a bust of Watson by Edward E. Geflowski. 
Watson was regarded as a kind, liberal-minded man and had many interests, including riding to hounds and amateur theatricals. He died at his home, Plas Uchaf, Lancaster Square, Conwy, on 3 January 1892 of a respiratory complaint and was buried on the 7th of that month at St Agnes cemetery, Conwy.

Watson, John Forbes (1827-1892), physician and expert on India, was baptized on 20 June 1827, at Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, the son of George Watson, a farmer, and his wife, Jean McHardy. He was educated at the University of Aberdeen and graduated MA and MD in 1847. He continued his medical training at Guy's Hospital, London, and in Paris. In 1850 he was appointed assistant surgeon to the Bombay Army Medical Service. His Indian experience included medical service to the artillery at Ahmednagar; to the Sind horse at Kangur; to the Jamsetjee Hospital, where he was assistant surgeon; and to Grant Medical College, where he lectured on physiology and clinical medicine. After returning to England on sick leave in 1853, he studied the sanitary uses of charcoal for the Royal School of Mines in London, and published a pamphlet on the subject in 1855. He then returned to his interests in India, cataloguing and investigating its useful plants at the behest of the India Office's court of directors; he published his index in 1868. He was named director of the India Museum in London in 1858. From the mid-1850s his Indian interests largely supplanted his medical practice. 
Watson selected the materials and wrote the catalogue for the Indian department of the London International Exhibition of 1862. This brought him into the circle, led by Henry Cole, that had been central to the shaping of London's South Kensington Museum; to international exhibitions on the site (as well as British contributions to foreign exhibitions); and to the reshaping of the Schools of Design according to principles of industrial art. In Cole's view the future of English industrialism depended on training manufacturers and workers as well as the consuming public on the proper principles of design. 
The influence of such thinking was clear in Watson's next major project, 'The Textile Manufactures and the Costumes of the People of India' (1866). The project, simultaneously an ethnographic catalogue and a brief for increased commerce with India, included a text by Watson detailing the cultural uses of specific costumes by Indians and twenty sets of an eighteen-volume collection of samples of Indian textiles, each including some 700 samples. Watson, terming the volumes 'industrial museums' ('Textile Manufactures', 1), arranged for their distribution to twelve English cities and seven sites in India (with one copy retained by the India Museum). The distribution of these catalogues and samples to industrial cities in Great Britain and key craft centres in India was intended to acquaint British producers with the forms and styles of Indian costume, while preserving Indian craft traditions. The catalogue employed photographs to illustrate the proper wearing of Indian clothing. 
Watson sought to encourage commerce between the countries, especially by training English manufacturers in the needs of the Indian people. 'India is in a position to become a magnificent customer', Watson wrote, but only if 'we endeavour to make the articles which we know will be liked and needed' ('Textile Manufactures', 2). Watson insisted that the development of widened commerce between Britain and India would benefit both partners, especially as wider knowledge led to a demand for Indian handicrafts in Britain. 
The same central principles of encouraging broader trade through education in the principles of Indian design shaped Watson's reorganization of the India Museum in 1870. Watson continued, too, to be actively engaged in selecting and cataloguing Indian works for international exhibitions, including those in Paris (1867), Vienna (1873), and Philadelphia (1876), as well as the annual international exhibitions in South Kensington from 1871 to 1874. Reviewing these, the 'Art Journal' singled out Watson's 'power of organization, and clear method of imparting information' ('Indian court', 208). 
Meanwhile, Watson's broader interests in promoting commerce between Britain and India led him to investigate a wide range of Indian products. He called for a comprehensive survey of Indian goods and products in a pamphlet of 1872. He published works on Indian tobacco (1871), tea cultivation (1872), rheea fibre (1875), and wheat (1879), as well as on the applicability of cotton gins to Indian cotton (1879). He expanded his 'industrial museums' of samples of Indian textiles with a new multi-volume set in 1872-4. 
Watson continued to pioneer photography as a method of illustrating works, establishing a photographic department in the India Office in 1865. He collaborated with J. K. Kaye to produce an ethnographic survey of India ('Peoples of India', 8 vols., 1868-75), and with James Fergusson he documented the Indian classical architecture (displayed at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867 and published in 1869). Watson also proposed the reorganization of the India Museum and its libraries in 1874, paving the way for its reconsolidation in South Kensington in 1879. 
Watson retired from the India Office soon after the relocation of the museum, in 1880. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1889. He died at his home, 56 Belvedere Road, Upper Norwood, Surrey, on 29 July 1892. He was survived by his widow, Amelia Mary Anne Watson.

Watson, John Selby (bap. 1804, d. 1884), scholar and murderer, baptized at Crayford church on 30 December 1804, is stated to have been the son of humble parents in Scotland. He was educated at first by his grandfather, and then at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1838, being one of the gold medallists in classics, and proceeded MA in 1844. On 30 March 1854 he was admitted 'ad eundem' at Oxford. He was ordained deacon in 1839 by the bishop of Ely, and priest in 1840 by the bishop of Bath and Wells, and from 1839 to 1841 he served the curacy of Langport in Somerset. 
Watson continued his classical studies, and began a lifelong habit of writing. From 1844 he was headmaster of the Stockwell grammar school in the London suburbs. Watson continued to publish classical and other works. He translated many Latin authors for 'Bohn's Classical Library' and wrote several biographies, including those of George Fox (1860), Richard Porson (1861), William Wallace (1861), and Bishop Warburton (1863), and Wilkes and Cobbett (1870). He wrote on the reasoning power of animals (1867) and prepared several other works, including a history of the papacy to 1530. He expected pupils to match his level of erudition. Not surprisingly, the number of pupils in his school declined and he was dismissed as headmaster in September 1870. 
Watson lived from 1865 at 28 St Martin's Road, Stockwell, and there, in a fit of passion, he killed his wife on 8 October 1871. Her skull was fractured, probably by a horse-pistol in Watson's possession. She was an Irishwoman named Anne Armstrong, to whom he was married at St Mark's Church, Dublin, in January 1845. Three days after the murder he attempted to commit suicide by taking prussic acid, purchased a year earlier. He wrote a long suicide note, admitting his crime and giving instructions for the publication of his literary remnants. He claimed the loss of his post as 'the principal cause' of his melancholy. Watson was tried for murder at the Old Bailey and found guilty, but recommended to mercy, and the sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life. The 'Stockwell murder' and Watson's condition attracted much curiosity. 'Watson, ein unglucklicher Ehemann. Psychologische Studien uber die Ehe' was published at Berlin in 1875. Watson died at Parkhurst prison in the Isle of Wight on 6 July 1884 after a fall from his hammock, and was buried in Carisbrooke cemetery.

Watson, Joseph (1764/5-1829), teacher of deaf people, was educated at a school in Mare Street, Hackney, run by his uncle, Thomas Braidwood, the pioneer teacher of deaf mute children. In 1784 he decided to follow his uncle's profession and was involved in the foundation in 1792, by public subscription, of the asylum for deaf and deaf mute children which opened in Grange Road, Bermondsey. He was principal of the new institution which, after further fund-raising, moved in 1809 to premises in Kent Road. His main object, shared by many of the asylum's promoters, who included the evangelicals Henry Cox Mason, Henry Thornton, and John Townsend, was religious instruction. The practical methods used by Braidwood were not publicized until after his death, when Watson published 'Instruction of the deaf and dumb, or, A theoretical and practical view of the means by which they are taught to speak and understand a language' (2 vols., 1809). By then he held the degree of LLD but it was not specified from which university. He had a correspondence about the asylum with the French teacher the Abbe Sicard, who was interested in its work. While numbers of pupils in the asylum grew from 70 in 1810 to 200 in 1820, Watson took a decreasing part in the ordinary teaching, which he left to assistant teachers while he concentrated on his private pupils. Watson died at the deaf and dumb asylum, Kent Road, London, on 23 November 1829, and was buried at Bermondsey. One of his sons, Thomas James Watson (probably the individual of that name who matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1822), was director of the institution until 1857, when he was succeeded by his own son, Watson's grandson, James Harrison Watson (1827-1888).

Watson, Joshua (1771-1855), wine merchant and Anglican philanthropist, was born on 9 May 1771 at Tower Hill, City of London, the second son of John Watson (died 1821), a wine merchant of Tower Hill, and of Dorothy Robson, a cousin of the watercolour painter George Fennel Robson and sister of the Revd James Robson, master of Sherburn Hospital, co. Durham. He was educated, from the age of ten, under the private tuition of Mr Crawford at Newington Butts, and from thirteen to fifteen at a commercial school run by Mr Eaton in the City of London. He also attended schools at Bromfield and Maidstone. In 1786 he was taken into his father's counting-house, which at that time moved within the City of London from Tower Hill to Mincing Lane. In 1792, aged twenty-one, he was admitted as a partner in his father's business. In 1797 he married Mary Sikes (died 1831), daughter of Thomas Sikes, a banker in Mansion House Street, City of London. Mary's uncle, Charles Daubeny (afterwards archdeacon of Sarum), and her brother, Thomas Sikes (1766-1834), rector of Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, who had been at Oxford with Joshua's elder brother, the Revd John James Watson (1767-1839), were among the most prominent churchmen of the day. Joshua and Mary Watson had two daughters; the first died unmarried, but the second, Mary (died 1840), married Henry Michell Wagner (1792-1870), vicar of Brighton (from 1824), in 1838. 
As a wine merchant Watson was part of the commercial world, but his heart was always in the church work to which as a young layman he dedicated his life. His early friends and advisers included notable high-churchmen of the preceding generation: William Stevens (1732-1807), hosier, treasurer of Queen Anne's Bounty and founder of the Club of Nobody's Friends (1800), of which Watson was an original member; William Jones (1726-1800), vicar of Nayland; Jonathan Boucher (1738-1804), vicar of Epsom (where John James Watson served his first curacy); and Sir John Richardson (afterwards a judge in the court of common pleas). Joshua Watson formed close friendships with numerous like-minded contemporaries who formed the nucleus of the high-church coterie known as the Hackney Phalanx, so called from the residence of some of its members in that locality. Apart from Watson himself, the most prominent members of the Hackney Phalanx included: Henry Handley Norris (1771-1850), perpetual curate (later rector) of South Hackney, with whom he maintained an unbroken friendship of nearly sixty years; William Van Mildert (1765-1836), rector of St Mary le Bow, City of London (afterwards bishop of Llandaff and Durham); and Christopher Wordsworth (1774-1846), master of Trinity College, Cambridge. 
The two Watson brothers and Norris worked closely together in masterminding the various religious, educational, missionary, and philanthropic activities of the Hackney Phalanx. Watson and his friends responded to the need to provide elementary education on Christian principles in the industrial towns and to meet the challenge of the schools founded by Joseph Lancaster which rejected church control. In 1811 the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church was founded at a meeting at Watson's house in Clapton. Watson became the National Society's first treasurer, holding this office until his resignation in 1842. He was largely responsible for the raising of $16,000 in subscriptions by May 1812. The appointment of the archbishop of Canterbury as president, and the other bishops as vice-presidents, ensured that the National Society conformed to Watson's model of the church acting in its corporate capacity and was not a mere private pressure group. The society encouraged parishes to open their own schools, but Watson insisted on instruction in the liturgy and catechism, attendance at church, and the use of no books except those published by SPCK before authorizing the payment of grants. 
Watson supported various literary ventures on behalf of the church. Along with Norris and Van Mildert he published a literary series called 'The Churchman's Remembrancer', which appeared in three instalments between 1807 and 1810. At the end of 1811 Watson and Norris purchased the 'British Critic', originally founded as an organ of Anglican orthodoxy in 1793 by Jones of Nayland, but which in subsequent years had somewhat diverged from its original character; after 1814 the 'British Critic' once more became an effective mouthpiece of high-church principles. In 1818 Watson and Norris induced the Revd Frederick Iremonger to start another high-church periodical, the 'Christian Remembrancer'; there is evidence to suggest that they had a financial concern in the 'Remembrancer' and were influential in appointing its editors. 
In 1814 Watson retired from business in order to devote himself exclusively to charitable activities and to the service of the Church of England. His voluntary efforts were not deflected by the ridicule heaped upon him by his former friend William Cobbett, in a vitriolic attack in his 'History of the Protestant Reformation' (1822). He was treasurer of the Clergy Orphan Society, a governor of the London Fever Hospital, and subscribed in all to fourteen societies, including the Philanthropic Society, founded with the aim of reforming juvenile criminals. He became secretary of the relief fund set up in 1814 for German refugees from the Napoleonic wars. On account of this charitable work he received presents from the kings of Prussia and Saxony, was granted a diploma of honour at the University of Hamburg, and was elected a member of the Hamburg Patriotic Society for the Encouragement of the Liberal and Useful Arts. Although he never personally crossed the English Channel, Watson assumed that the Anglican church throughout the world was his concern. For many years he held leading positions in both of the oldest church societies connected with missionary work, the SPCK and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG). In 1814 he was appointed joint treasurer of the SPCK and helped link the society more closely to the SPG. His financial ability and integrity were legendary. He transformed the SPG into an effective missionary society; its total annual income increased from just over $8100 in 1814 to more than $82,000 by the time of his death in 1855. 
Watson also encouraged the bishops to take a more active interest in missionary work. His deep interest in the colonial churches and beginnings of what later became known as the Anglican communion was reflected in his role in the creation of new colonial bishoprics. It was at Watson's house in Westminster that 'was first fostered the good design of sending bishops to the British colonies' (Churton, 18-19). Several of his intimate friends were appointed to these bishoprics: T. F. Middleton (Calcutta, 1822), John Inglis (Nova Scotia, 1832), William George Broughton (Australia, 1829), and George Selwyn (New Zealand, 1838). These bishops remained in regular correspondence with Watson, who offered practical advice and support. In 1841 he supported the foundation of the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, and in 1848 he became one of the founders and a member of the council of the new Missionary College of St Augustine, Canterbury. Watson's work for the overseas church was animated by his staunch high-church principles -- he was determined to support the building up of churches linked organically to the Church of England. 
Watson was no less attentive to the practical concerns of the church at home. He was largely instrumental in the foundation and drawing up of the original resolutions of the Church Building Society in 1817. He became a member of the royal commission for church building set up under Lord Liverpool's government, managed expenditure of the $1,500,000 parliamentary grant, and raised further large sums from voluntary sources over the next twenty years. In 1823 he took a house at 6 Park Street, Westminster, where he lived for the next sixteen years in order to be near the commission's headquarters. To aid the commission's revival of the church in industrial areas, the Church Pastoral Aid Society was founded in 1836. High-churchmen like Watson, however, objected to its evangelical ethos and use of lay assistants. In 1837, along with his friends Benjamin Harrison (1808-1887), later archdeacon of Canterbury, and Sir Robert Inglis, MP for Oxford University, Watson founded the Additional Curates Society, pledged to work through the bishops and to respect ministerial order. Watson himself donated money and also acted as joint honorary treasurer. 
In 1828 Watson played a prominent part in the Anglican foundation of King's College, London. This brought him into contact with a leading figure in the incipient Anglo-Catholic revival, Hugh James Rose (1795-1838), with whom he became close friends. Watson opposed Roman Catholic emancipation on both religious and political grounds, and deplored the passing of the 'Reform Bill'. In 1833 he was instrumental in the drawing up of a lay declaration and in supporting a clerical address to the archbishop of Canterbury in defence of the embattled Church of England; an involvement which, through his link with Rose, first brought him to contact with the leading figures in the emergent Oxford Movement, Newman, Keble, Froude, and, later, Pusey. Watson's withdrawal from the ruling committee of the SPCK in 1833, however, marked the end of an era of Hackney ascendancy in the counsels of church and state, with the initiative in galvanizing opposition to the forces of liberalism and dissent passing to the younger Tractarians. 
Although nicknamed the Archtreasurer, Watson was no mere ecclesiastical and financial bureaucrat: through his exhaustive reading and study he could claim to be an accomplished lay theologian. His favourite divine was the eighteenth-century orthodox churchman Daniel Waterland (1683-1740), and he was steeped in the high-church principles of the Caroline divines and later eighteenth-century high-churchmen. As a high-churchman Watson disapproved of both evangelicalism and the sort of latitudinarianism espoused by Thomas Arnold, as different but equally false manifestations of a 'Christianity of men above ordinances'. He was implacable in opposition to protestant dissent and objected to the SPCK's sale of books written by nonconformists such as Isaac Watts and Philip Doddridge, and even Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress'. However, unlike some tory high-churchmen, he supported several evangelical-dominated moral and philanthropic ventures, such as William Wilberforce's Society for the Suppression of Vice. Watson came to be widely consulted on doctrinal as well as practical matters, and his learning as well as practical attainments were recognized by the University of Oxford when he was awarded an honorary DCL on 14 June 1820. When the Oxford Movement emerged after 1833, the eagerness with which individual Tractarians sought Watson's benediction for their efforts is testimony to the value which they placed upon his judgement. 
Watson's relationship with the Oxford Movement was ambivalent. Like other members of the Hackney Phalanx he initially welcomed the Tractarians as allies in the cause of Anglican orthodoxy. Keble's 'Christian Year' (1827) was one of his favourite works, and he delighted Newman by his 'munificent subscription' to his new chapel at Littlemore in 1836. Watson warmly praised Newman's work advocating suffragan bishops in 1835, and had the highest regard for Newman's sermons. The evidence of Newman's published letters and diaries contradicts the assertion of Watson's biographer, Edward Churton, that Newman and Watson were never in the same room and that no correspondence passed between them. 
Watson was happy to enlist Tractarian contributors to the ailing 'British Critic' in 1836, and sympathized with Newman's objections to the liberal line being pursued by the then editor, J. S. Boone. He developed a sincere regard for some of the younger disciples of Newman in London, notably John William Bowden, James Robert Hope-Scott, and Samuel Francis Wood. In 1840 Watson handed over much of the business of the various church societies, which he had managed for over three decades, to Samuel Wood. He welcomed the energetic activities of Wood and other Tractarians on the council of the National Society who organized strong resistance to the government's proposals concerning lay state inspection of church schools in 1839. He was more committed than the Tractarians to establishment and the union of church and state, but was no less opposed than they were to state encroachment on the church's educational prerogatives. 
Watson always hoped that Tractarian individualism might be curbed and harnessed by deference to the counsels of his own generation of high-churchmen, and at an early stage supported attempts to have the 'Tracts for the Times' submitted to the editorial supervision of a committee. In this he failed; Newman and Froude resisted such moves and jettisoned Hackney caution. Whereas the ideal of ecclesiastical action preferred by Watson was later derided by Newman as being that of 'a board of safe, sound, sensible men' ('Apologia pro vita sua'), the Oxford Movement represented a voyage of discovery for many of its followers. The publication of Hurrell Froude's iconoclastic 'Remains' (1838), with its strictures on the English reformers and Reformation, was a source of private dismay for Watson. Newman's 'Tract 90' (1841) and the increasingly 'romanizing' character of the 'British Critic' heightened his private alarm over the apparent direction of the Oxford Movement. Watson deprecated the party spirit of the Tractarians, and compared Newman with the evangelical Charles Simeon as partisan leaders who equally strayed from the orthodox mainstream. He sympathized with most of the official academical and episcopal attempts to curb the Tractarians in the 1840s, such as the suspension of Pusey from preaching by the Oxford University authorities in 1843. 
There were strict limits, however, to Watson's negative appraisal of Tractarianism: he was more reluctant than many of his Hackney friends, such as Norris, to make his profound misgivings public, and more ready than they to make allowances for what he regarded essentially as misplaced zeal and youthful excess. He assumed that Newman was being carried along unwillingly by his younger disciples, and restricted himself to private expressions of unease. He also supported the restatement of classical high Anglican principles enshrined in Christopher Wordsworth junior's (1807-1885) 'Theophilus Anglicanus' (1843), the proofs of which he helped to correct. Newman's conversion to Rome in 1845 came as a shock, but Watson remained convinced that the Oxford Movement represented gain as well as loss for the Church of England. His own generation of high-churchmen had concentrated on church policy and parliamentary manoeuvrings, but with the collapse of the old constitutional order in church and state Watson rightly sensed that the old high-church party needed the rejuvenating intellectual and religious force provided by Tractarian Oxford in order to respond to new challenges. He regretted the need to caution his younger Oxford friends and referred to himself as 'the wet blanket'. Although his own sacramental views fell short of those propagated by the Tractarians, he welcomed Newman's attempt to recreate an Anglican form of semi-religious life at Littlemore based on retirement and self-denial. 
The Tractarian leaders for long remained anxious to shelter under Watson's mantle. In September 1839 Watson and Pusey had an amicable interview at Brighton, after which Pusey told Newman that Watson's teaching was the same as their own, and that the older man linked them with past generations of high-churchmen. Most old high-churchmen of Watson's generation were more conscious of the discontinuities between the Tractarians and themselves, and Pusey may have exaggerated the extent of Watson's approval of Tractarian endeavours in order to gain credibility. Watson was clearly embarrassed by Tractarian attempts to link his name with the movement, and deprecated attempts to attach too much importance to 'the movement of 1833' (Webster, 29). He dealt, however, with the problem of Tractarian use of his name with characteristic delicacy and courtesy. In 1840 he gracefully declined Newman's offer to dedicate the fifth volume of his 'Plain and Parochial Sermons' to himself. After much agonizing and apparent reluctance Newman went ahead anyway, making an unsanctioned and somewhat stilted dedication. Newman remained devoted to Watson's memory, being 'greatly struck with him' (W. Copeland to E. B. Pusey, 16 March 1855, Oxford, Pusey House, LBV). 
In his last years Watson acted as a calming influence on more extreme high-churchmen, who were more troubled than himself by contemporary events. He counselled against a high-church overreaction to the Gorham judgment (1850), arguing that the verdict involved no new heresy, and did not touch or undermine the church's teaching on baptism as enshrined in her formularies. He deprecated the party spirit manifested by the formation of church unions. He was no less opposed to Arnoldian liberalism than were the Tractarians, but unlike the Tractarians pleaded for the toleration of differing opinions within the church so long as credal fundamentals were not endangered. 
Although a city man and Londoner, Watson was an ardent Wordsworthian, with an intense love of nature. His piety was deep but unobtrusive; his favourite spiritual writer was Jeremy Taylor, in whose work he found a welcome scope for the imaginative faculty in devotion. Watson was too diffident to publish anything on his own account, but in 1825 he edited Hele's 'Sacred Offices', an eighteenth-century book of devotions based on the 'Bible' and 'Book of Common Prayer', which he regularly used. He also printed several selections from Jeremy Taylor's shorter devotional manuals. He was instrumental, in the pre-Tractarian era, in helping restore the print of the communion office in the 'Book of Common Prayer' to large, bold type. 
Watson's later years were beset by domestic sorrows. His wife, Mary, died in 1831, and brother, Archdeacon Watson, in 1839. These losses, along with that of his daughter, Mary, in 1840, led him to sell his Westminster house in 1840 and to live during his remaining years with his late wife's sister and family at Clapton, and with his sister-in-law, Mrs J. J. Watson, 'nee' Caroline Powell (1775-1865), and her two daughters at Daventry. He also made regular visits to his friend the Revd Edward Churton (1800-1874), his later biographer, at Crayke, near York. 
A shy, reserved, and self-effacing man, Watson yet had a great gift for gaining and retaining friendships. His friends found him a conversationalist of wit and charm, never short of amusing stories and anecdotes, especially relating to his favourite author, Dr Samuel Johnson. He remained active until the end of his life. He died at Clapton on 30 January 1855 and was buried on 7 February in the family vault at Hackney.

Watson, Justly (c.1710-1757), military engineer, was the son of Colonel 
Justly Watson entered the ordnance train as a cadet gunner about 1726 and served under his father at the siege of Gibraltar. He was appointed practitioner-engineer on 13 June 1732, and promoted sub-engineer on 1 November 1734. By then he had married, on 15 November 1733, Susan Curtis, at Pagham, Sussex. He received a commission as ensign in Harrison's foot on 3 February 1740 and in June was appointed to the ordnance train of the expedition to the West Indies. He sailed on 26 October and arrived at Jamaica on 9 January 1741. His father was killed at the subsequent siege of Cartagena, but he had made his will before he left England, and bequeathed Justly his books, maps, and 'instruments relating to the affairs of artillery'. Justly Watson took part in the assault on Fort St Louis on 25 March and the assault on Fort Lazar on 9 April, and following this he was promoted lieutenant in Harrison's regiment of foot. 
Watson returned to Jamaica on 19 May 1741, and was appointed engineer-extraordinary on 11 August, when he was serving in the expedition to Cuba. He returned again to Jamaica in November, and in March 1742 he joined in the abortive expedition to attack Panama. In September he was back in Jamaica as chief engineer. In 1743 he visited Darien and Florida to make surveys and reports. He returned to Jamaica and was promoted engineer in ordinary on 8 March 1744. He returned to England in the autumn of 1744, and was promoted captain-lieutenant in Harrison's regiment on 24 December 1745. On 30 April he joined the expedition under Admiral Richard Lestock and Lieutenant-General James St Clair originally intended for North America, but which attacked the coast of Brittany. He took part in the siege of Lorient (20-27 September), the attack on Quiberon, and the capture of forts Houat and Heydie. Back in England again, he was promoted sub-director of engineers on 2 January 1748, and was appointed chief engineer in the Medway division which included Gravesend, Tilbury, Sheerness, Harwich, and Landguard. 
Watson was promoted director of engineers on 17 December 1754, and was sent to Annapolis Royal as chief engineer of Nova Scotia and of settlements in Newfoundland. However, he was soon moved to serve on the west coast of Africa, arriving before December 1755. He returned to England in summer 1756, his reports on the military stations in Africa resulting in the House of Commons granting money to carry out his proposals for improved fortifications. After examining Rye harbour in October and November 1756 he was sent at the end of the year to Annapolis Royal to resume his duties in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. On 14 May 1757 he was commissioned lieutenant-colonel of Royal Engineers. He died at St John's, Newfoundland in the summer of 1757 from the effects of poison administered in his coffee, probably by a female servant. His will was proved by his widow on 4 August 1757, and she was granted a pension of $40 p.a. from 1 January 1758. His daughter Miriam (died 1782) married Watson's sometime assistant Sir William Green (1725-1811). Several of his plans and surveys are in the British Library.

Watson, Lewis, first Baron Rockingham (bap. 1584, d. 1653), landowner, eldest son of Sir Edward Watson (died 1617) and his wife, Anne (died 1612), daughter of Kenelm Digby of Stoke Dry, Rutland, was born at Rockingham, Northamptonshire, and baptized there on 14 July 1584. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 24 May 1599, but did not graduate. He was admitted to the Middle Temple as a student in 1601. He was constantly at the court of James VI and I over the following years and was knighted on 19 August 1608. He was associated with George Villiers, later earl and then duke of Buckingham. He had succeeded his father on 1 March 1617; on 21 July 1619 he received by patent the fee simple of Rockingham Castle which he had previously held by knight service. On 23 June 1621 he was created a baronet. He married twice. His first wife was Catherine (died 1611), daughter of Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby. They married in 1609 but she died in childbirth. His second wife, whom he married on 3 October 1620, was Eleanor Manners (died 1679), daughter of Sir George Manners of Haddon Hall, Derbyshire. They had six children, a son and five daughters. 
Watson sat for Lincoln in the Addled Parliament of 1614 and in the parliaments of 1621 and 1624. In his own county he was a commissioner for martial law and oyer and terminer in 1628, and in 1632-3 served as high sheriff. He was master of the royal buckhounds from 1634 and verderer of Rockingham Forest from 1638. He failed to provide a horse for a muster at Huntingdon during the second bishops' war, for which he was summoned by the privy council. 
Watson was a nominal royalist who at the outset of the civil war was appointed commissioner of array for Northamptonshire, on 4 July 1642. He was also ordered to garrison Rockingham Castle. Before he did so, the parliamentarian commander of the east midland association, Lord Grey of Groby, seized the castle on 19 March 1643 and installed a garrison himself. The role of Watson in this is unclear. There were claims in the royalist press that he had facilitated the surrender of the castle and that he was living under parliamentarian protection at Stoke Park in Northampton after Rockingham had been garrisoned. Some time in early June 1643 the royalist regional commander Henry Hastings had Watson arrested and imprisoned at the garrison at Belvoir Castle and for this he was thanked in an anonymous letter by 'certain inhabitants of the counties of Northampton, Rutland and Leicester' ('Hastings MSS', 2.102). The garrison at Rockingham served as a base for part of the Northamptonshire county committee and the garrison was able to infiltrate royalist territory in the east midlands throughout the war. The castle was used to imprison some royalist captives after the battle of Naseby (14 June 1645). 
Watson petitioned the king for his freedom in June 1643 and Hastings was asked to send 'whatsoever shall be objected against him' by Secretary Edward Nicholas on 13 June ('Hastings MSS', 2.103). By the beginning of 1645 Watson had not only cleared his name, but on 29 January Charles I ennobled him as Baron Rockingham of Rockingham. He was resident at Oxford until the garrison surrendered in June 1646. The defeat of the royalists left Watson facing a composition levy of $5000 for his delinquency. He died on 5 January 1653 and was buried in Rockingham church a week later. His widow died in London on 23 October 1679 and was buried with her husband at Rockingham on 8 November.

Watson, Musgrave Lewthwaite (1804-1847), sculptor, was born at Hawksdale Hall, near Carlisle, on 24 January 1804. He was one of six children of Thomas Watson (1754-1823), a farmer and ironmonger, and his wife, Mary Lewthwaite ('c'.1770-1829). Although he showed early artistic promise, at his parents' insistence Watson spent two reluctant years (1821-3) training as a solicitor in Carlisle following his attendance at Raughton Head School, Cumberland. Immediately after his father's death in 1823 he abandoned his legal career and went to London, where he visited John Flaxman. Following Flaxman's advice, Watson briefly studied at the Royal Academy Schools which he entered on 31 March 1825 when his age was given in the register as nineteen and also worked in the studio of the sculptor Robert Sievier. Watson then spent almost three years in Italy (1825-8) where he worked as a cameo engraver, etcher, and watercolourist as well as a sculptor. On his return he showed six works at the Carlisle Exhibition (1828) and carved two significant church monuments in the locality. The relief commemorating his father (St Mary's, Sebergham) was regarded by Nikolaus Pevsner as 'one of the most effective monuments of the 1820s in all England' (Pevsner, 'Cumberland', 36). It reflects the strong influence of the romantic classicism of Henry Fuseli's painting 'The Three Witches' (1783; Royal Shakespeare Museum, Stratford upon Avon). A more pensive note is struck by Watson's monument to his schoolmaster and mentor, the Revd Robert Monkhouse (Raughton Head parish church). 
Watson returned to London in 1829. With characteristic pride, he initially refused to work for anyone, but by 1833 poverty had forced him to approach the leading portrait sculptor of the period, Sir Francis Chantrey. Shortly afterwards he received an offer from Chantrey's main rival, Sir Richard Westmacott, and for a while evidently put in sixteen-hour working days assisting them both. Although Chantrey admired Watson's abilities as a modeller, he refused to raise his wages. Watson angrily handed in his notice, but in the process he earned the respect of Allan Cunningham, Chantrey's chief assistant. Watson subsequently assisted the sculptors William Behnes and Edward Hodges Baily, and for two years worked as a modeller in terracotta at the Lambeth factory of William Croggan. 
Although Watson first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1829, it was several years before his work became known to a wide public. Lack of encouragement -- and of private means -- often meant that his sculpture did not progress beyond the plaster model stage. Two such examples are a wittily realistic statuette of the inebriated 'Jolly (or Crutched) Friars' and the more lyrical and elegant relief 'Sleep Bearing off the Body of Sarpedon' (1844) (both Carlisle Museum and Art Gallery). Watson's belated breakthrough came in 1842 with his frieze for the Royal Exchange building, Threadneedle Street, City of London (later relocated to Napier Street, Islington). This work successfully fused classical traditionalism with contemporary references to commerce and was admired by the architect C. R. Cockerell. 
Following Chantrey's sudden death in 1841, Cunningham helped to secure Watson the commission for the colossal seated marble group of the brothers Lord Eldon and Lord Stowell (1842-54; University College, Oxford). Unfinished at the time of Watson's death, the statue was completed by George Nelson and this perhaps explains Pevsner's terse verdict: 'very cold' (Pevsner, 'Oxfordshire', 212). Watson's most prominently located work was also posthumously completed, the bronze 'Battle of St Vincent', for the Nelson memorial in Trafalgar Square, London (1850). One of four reliefs, it reveals Watson's emergence from dependence on Flaxman's neo-classicism into a more robust realism. In this respect it anticipates the work of the leading mid-Victorian sculptor John Henry Foley. At the time of his death, Watson had almost finished a seated marble sculpture of Flaxman (1843-7; University College, London), foregoing proper payment for the work, generosity that he could ill afford. 
Watson died of tuberculosis and heart failure at his home, 13 Upper Gloucester Place, Marylebone, Middlesex, on 28 October 1847 and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He was unmarried, but there is some evidence that he lived with a woman possibly called Helen, a publican's daughter, as his common-law wife, and that they had a child (Lonsdale, 38, 51-2, 89-90). Physically he was slightly built and his delicate constitution was strained by overwork in the damp and draughty conditions of a sculptor's studio. He also suffered from what may today be diagnosed as bulimia nervosa and depression. In a mood of self-criticism shortly before his death, he destroyed many of his studio models despite the protests of friends. As with many artists, critical recognition and major commissions came too late for Watson to appreciate them. Echoing Watson's contemporaries, Rupert Gunnis believed that 'had he lived he would assuredly have been one of the greater sculptors of the nineteenth century' (Gunnis, 415). The sensitively written and well-documented biography by Watson's fellow Cumbrian, Henry Lonsdale, 'The Life and Works of Musgrave Lewthwaite Watson, Sculptor' (1866), rescued him from obscurity and helped to establish his art-historical status.

Watson, Peter William (bap. 1761, d. 1830), botanist, was born at Hull and baptized at Holy Trinity Church there on 26 August 1761. He was educated at the grammar school under Joseph Milner (1744-1797), and occupied in early life in trade; he was an enthusiastic student of botany, entomology, chemistry, and mineralogy, and a skilful landscape painter. In 1812 he took an active part in the establishment of the Hull Botanic Garden. In his 'Dendrologia Britannica, or, Trees and shrubs that will live in the open air of Britain throughout the year', published in twenty-four parts in 1824-5, he alludes (pt 1, p. xii) to his 'own endeavours to furnish the institution with many indigenous plants, which I collected at considerable expense and labour, by traversing the whole East Riding... in my gig, with proper apparatus for cutting up roots, collecting seeds, &c. of the rarer sorts, whose habitats had been rendered familiar to me from numerous previous herborisations.' 
'Dendrologia Britannica' was described by John Claudius Loudon in his 'Arboretum Britannicum' of 1833 (p. 188) as 'the most scientific work devoted exclusively to trees which has hitherto been published in England'. It contained an introduction to descriptive botany, occupying seventy-two pages, and 172 coloured plates of exotic trees and shrubs, each accompanied by a page of technical description. 
Watson was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1824. He died at Cottingham, near Hull, on 1 September 1830.

Watson, Richard (1611/12-1685), Church of England clergyman, was born in the parish of St Katharine Cree, London, and was probably the son of William Watson, citizen and mercer (died 'c'.1634), and his wife, Ursula Pearce. Although there were other London merchants of the same name this parentage is suggested by Richard Watson's attendance for five years at Mercers' School, under Mr Auger, prior to his admission, aged sixteen, to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 22 December 1628. Watson graduated BA in 1633, and MA in 1636, and from 1636 to 1644 was fellow of the college, acting as Greek lecturer (1642) and Hebrew lecturer (1643), as well as being master of the Perse School, Cambridge (1636-41). He was almost certainly aligned with the Arminians in the university, and joined Richard Crashaw, Bishop William Juxon, and Bishop Matthew Wren in penning verses which prefaced Robert Shelford's 'Five Pious and Learned Discourses' (1635). 
Upon the outbreak of civil war Watson demonstrated his allegiance to the royalist cause with a provocative lecture at the university church of Great St Mary's, published as 'A Sermon Touching Schisme'. He was inevitably ejected from the college by the parliamentarian visitation in April 1644, but by then he had already joined the royalist army as chaplain to Lord Hopton, with whom he probably remained in the field during the remainder of the first civil war. After the defeat of the royalist army at Truro in March 1646 Watson went with Hopton into exile, attending Prince Charles in Jersey in 1646 before joining the exiled court at St Germain by December 1647. By 1649 he was in The Hague, where he preached a sermon after the execution of Charles I which was published as 'Regicidium judaicum', with a dedication to Hopton. During the months that followed, Watson, like Hopton, formed part of the constitutional royalist faction at court which opposed negotiations with the Scots. In April 1649 Watson described the Scots as 'brazen-fac'd rebels and barbarous brutes' ('Clarendon State Papers', 2.53). This stance led to both men being alienated from the prevailing mood at court, and they subsequently moved to Wesel, where Watson continued to rail against the Scottish presbyterians, whom he described as the 'veriest villains the king hath for his enemies' (Scrope and Monkhouse, 2.491). During 1650 and 1651 he corresponded with other exiles such as Robert Creighton and William Edgeman about a response to Robert Baillie's reply to John Bramhall's attack upon presbyterianism; Watson's intervention appeared as ''Akolouthos', or, A Second Faire Warning', dedicated to Hopton against 'these bloody Presbyters'. Watson spent most of 1652 with Hopton at Bruges, insistent that he would not return to England under the 'Act of Oblivion', but alienated from those royalists, such as the duke of Buckingham, who sought to work with John Lilburne, whom Watson refused to consider as anything other than an 'agent provocateur'. 
After Hopton's death in September 1652 Watson remained in exile, in Wesel and Brussels, adamant that the royalists could expect little assistance from the Dutch, and trenchant in his opposition to the presbyterians, against whom he continued to favour a model of the Church of England closer to Laudians such as Richard Montague and John Cosin than strict Calvinists such as Thomas Morton or Ralph Brownrigge. In 1656 Watson published Isaac Basire's 'De antiqua ecclesiae Britannicae libertate', which he had found in Hopton's papers, and which he later translated into English. He later moved to Caen, from where he dedicated his 'Historicall Collections of Ecclesiastick Affairs in Scotland' to John Warner, bishop of Rochester, by whom he had been ordained. Watson's aim was to 'confirm all pious and humble hearts in the preferring the ancient and universal successive government of the Christian church before the new Genevatising bloody discipline of some heady Scots' (Watson, sig. A5). He also entered into print against the poet Edmund Waller, whom he described as a 'vassall' for writing a panegyric on the protector's death, and wrote a preface for Eleazor Duncon's 'De adoratione Dei' (1660). His greatest friend and ally during these years appears to have been Richard Browne, the royalist diplomat in Paris. 
Watson remained in Caen until after the Restoration, and returned to England only in 1661 to reclaim his college fellowship, although he felt compelled to issue a petition for confirmation of a grant made by Charles I for an annuity of $30 from his college, and for his restoration as a senior rather than a junior fellow. Watson displayed his allegiance in 1661 with a flurry of publications including 'Epistolaris diatribe', 'Effata regalia', 'The Prudential Advice and Observations', and 'Icon animae basilicae', the last three containing ideas and observations culled from the writings of Charles I. Watson was rewarded in 1662 with a doctorate in divinity at Oxford, a chaplaincy to the duke of York, and the rectory of Pewsey in Wiltshire. He subsequently became prebendary at Salisbury Cathedral of Warminster (1666), which he exchanged for that of Bitton in 1671, and master of Heytesbury Hospital (1671). He remained active as a scholar and author, publishing 'Aquilae cruso' (1665), and writing 'An Answer to Elymas the Sorcerer' (1682), and 'A Fuller Answer to Elimas the Sorcerer' (1683), in which he replied to allegations regarding the Popish Plot. He also published some of his own correspondence with John Cosin from 1646, as 'The Right Reverend Doctor John Cosin... his Opinion' (1684). Nevertheless, Watson's last years appear to have been far from happy. He was repeatedly troubled by serious allegations over tithe payments at Pewsey, and on at least one occasion, in 1665, was taken into custody. He also felt that he had received insufficient reward for his loyalty, and that he had been passed over for preferment in favour of younger less capable men. It was such attitudes which led Anthony Wood to conclude that Watson was 'a good scholar but vain and conceited' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.': 'Fasti', 2.264). Watson died on 13 January 1685 and was buried at Pewsey.

Watson, Richard (1737-1816), bishop of Llandaff, was born at Heversham, Westmorland, in August 1737, the third surviving child of Thomas Watson (1672-1753), Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster at Heversham, and his wife, Agnes Newton. He was educated at his father's grammar school but never became fully proficient in either Latin or Greek -- a severe handicap at Cambridge University, where he referred to his 'barbarous Latin' ('Anecdotes', 8). 
Watson was admitted sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 2 November 1754; there his tutor was William Backhouse. Cambridge offered him both an escape from rural-provincial life and an opportunity for self-advancement. He avoided the idle rich sons of the gentry, retained his north-country accent and plain clothes, and worked hard. He took his BA in January 1759 as second wrangler, was elected fellow of his college in October 1760, and became assistant tutor in November 1760. He proceeded MA in 1762 and was moderator for Trinity in 1762, 1763, and 1765, and for Christ's College in 1764. He was senior tutor at Trinity from 1764 to 1771 and junior dean from 1769 to 1771. 
Watson was appointed professor of chemistry in 1764 and held the post until 1773. Hitherto the chair had not been valued, since it carried neither a stipend nor a requirement to read lectures, but Watson perceived it as a way to advance his career and offered to deliver a course of chemistry lectures, though he admitted 'I knew nothing at all of Chemistry, had never read a syllable on the subject; nor seen a single experiment in it; but I was tired with mathematics and natural philosophy' ('Anecdotes', 28-9). He acquired an operator from Paris, studied the topic fully, and in fourteen months gave the first of five courses of lectures. In 1767 an unsuccessful experiment led to an explosion that caused considerable damage to his house. He contributed short articles to the transactions of the Royal Society, of which he was elected a fellow in 1769, and later he published his 'Chemical Essays' in five volumes (1781-7). These are intelligent and lucid but derivative, revealing Watson as an intelligent layman not a research scientist. They show a particular interest in applying science to manufacturing processes and a belief that chemistry could help to realize Britain's industrial potential. Watson worked on the efficiency of gunpowder and discovered that a thermometer in which the bulb was painted with black ink gave a higher reading than an ordinary thermometer. His account of the lime processes used in tar and lead smelting and his work on pit coal shows a particular interest in metallurgy. He saw a need to bridge the gap between academic chemists and the artisans of industry: 'a man must blacken his own hands with charcoal, he must sweat over the furnace, and inhale many a noxious vapour, before he can become a chemist' (R. Watson, 'Chemical Essays', 1, 1781, 40). Watson saw of course no conflict between science and religion: 'the books of Nature and Revelation... are both written by the finger of the one incomprehensible God' (ibid., 1.vii). 
In October 1771 Watson was elected regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, which he admitted 'had long been the secret object of my ambition' ('Anecdotes', 35). Lacking the necessary qualification of a doctorate in divinity he rushed to London to obtain one by royal mandate. He admitted to knowing as little about the subject as he had about chemistry and gave no lectures in divinity, suggesting that the obligatory Latin would deter the students. He held a number of university offices, sat on senate committees (the syndicates), and preached and published university sermons. He supported reform of the university examination system and refused bribes while moderator; on one occasion he rejected $1000 and insisted that William Paley should be senior wrangler. In 1787 ill health and a newly acquired fortune led him to retire from academic life, although he retained the regius chair of divinity until his death, paying Thomas Kipling an annual stipend of $200 to act as his deputy. 
Watson was ordained priest on 28 February 1768. The duke of Grafton, chancellor of Cambridge University, used his influence to get him a sinecure rectory in north Wales, which he exchanged for the second prebendal stall at Ely in 1774; he became archdeacon of Ely in 1779. He was rector of Northwold from 1779 to 1781 and of Knaptoft from 1781. He entered the national political arena on 29 May 1776, when he preached the Restoration day sermon at Cambridge, entitled 'The Principles of the Revolution Vindicated'. In other years this would have been seen as an unexceptionable restatement of Locke's whig doctrine, but with the Americans on the brink of declaring independence it was perceived by many as a bold support of the rebels. Five months later he restated those whig principles in the university accession sermon on 25 October 1776. He had already corresponded on scientific topics with the marquess of Rockingham, and in November 1775 he assured Rockingham that he had 'ever considered [him] as the head of the Whig Interest in this kingdom' ('Anecdotes', 57). In a fast sermon of February 1780 he supported economic reform and condemned the American War of Independence; his support for his old pupil Charles Manners, duke of Rutland, was evident. The fall of the North administration in the wake of defeat in America brought Watson's friends Grafton, Rutland, and Rockingham, to the edge of power. Shelburne, seeking to draw Rutland closer to his administration, offered Watson the see of Llandaff. Watson accepted but understood the reason, observing that he had: 'no great reason to be proud of the promotion; for I think I owed it not to any regard which he who gave it to me had to the zeal and industry with which I had for many years discharged the functions and fulfilled the duties of an academic life. (ibid., 94)' Llandaff was not a great prize in itself but was the first rung on the ladder of episcopal preferment. Worth only $500 a year it was normally occupied for an extremely brief period but Watson languished there from 1782 until his death thirty-four years later. His friends were no longer men of influence; Shelburne left office in 1783, Rutland died in 1787, and Rockingham was dead even before Watson's elevation. The new men, Pitt and Dundas, had no reason to trust or advance this 'ageing radical whose vote could not be relied on' (Brain, 29-30). As bishop of Llandaff, Watson was mostly non-resident but he did not neglect the diocese entirely, making an annual ordination visit and extensive triennial visitations, which he combined with confirmations of the laity. Time and again he was overlooked in episcopal reshuffles, despite considerable efforts on his part to be translated to a better see. His desire for advancement was undermined by a streak of independence that made it difficult for him constantly to please his patrons or to commit himself entirely to one man; if, as his critics alleged, he was a cynical time-server, his thirty-four years at Llandaff show him to have been a remarkably ineffective one. 
Watson's contemporaries regarded his politics as inconstant and ascribed their changes to his ambition and hopes of advancement; historians see a greater degree of consistency. In the 1770s conservatives perceived him as a dangerous radical; in the 1790s radicals denounced him as an apostate. His views in both decades were those of a thorough-going whig who hardly deviated from the classic principles of John Locke. In 1782 he defended Locke against the theoretical criticisms of Soame Jenyns but normally he was more interested in political practice than abstract theory. Ignoring the work of David Hume he defended Locke's concept of an original compact as well as his views on the strictly limited possibilities of revolution. The application of those principles to the dispute with the American colonies in the 1770s, in the Restoration day and accession day sermons of 1776, earned Watson a reputation as a radical, though he was doing little more than restating Locke's views at a time when others were abandoning them. He stopped short of outright support of the colonists; he argued that men had an abstract right to rebel against unjust government, not that the Americans were justified in doing so at that juncture. He was less concerned with America than with what he perceived to be the increasing power of the crown in Britain. In the 1780s he interested himself more in the question of economic reform than in the final settlement of American independence. He supported the Cambridgeshire petition but did not argue as strongly for the reform of parliament as he had earlier. After his elevation to the House of Lords in 1782 he spoke and voted as an independent whig and abstained on the crucial vote that brought down the Fox-North coalition. At first he welcomed the younger Pitt but in 1787-9 he opposed him on three issues: the commercial treaty with France, the repeal of the 'Test and Corporation Acts', and the regency crises. 
Having retired from Cambridge to the Lake District in 1787 Watson remained politically active. He kept his London house in Great George Street until 1803 and appeared regularly in the House of Lords, speaking in the debates on the regency in 1789 and the union with Ireland; he made one of his final appearances in March 1807 to support the abolition of the slave trade. The French Revolution dominated political controversy in these years and, like many Englishmen, Watson first welcomed and later denounced it. Its early stages appeared consistent with Lockean principles, and in October 1791 Watson insisted that the rights of man 'are founded in nature; they exist antecedent to and independent of civil society; and the French constitution is the only one in the world which has deliberately asserted these rights and supported them in their full extent' ('Anecdotes', 256). But the French Revolution changed significantly in 1792, and after the execution of Louis XVI in January 1793 Watson could no longer support it. In 1793 he lamented the king's death and the abandonment of a balanced constitution; he denounced republican government as 'the most oppressive to the bulk of the people: they are deceived in it, with the show of liberty; but they live in it, under the most odious of all tyrannies, the tyranny of their equals' (R. Watson, 'Miscellaneous Tracts on Religious, Political, and Agricultural Subjects', 2 vols., 1815, 1.475). Watson's immutable Lockean principles at this time look distinctly old-fashioned, left behind both by Burke's conservative idea of the gradual organic growth of society and by the English Jacobins' radicalism. Wordsworth wrote 'A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff by a Republican', in which he indicted Watson as 'an enemy lurking in our ranks' (W. Wordsworth, 'Poetry and Prose', 1955, 81). In summer 1795 Watson argued in two sermons and a charge that it was French atheism, not military might, that posed the real threat to British stability. His support for the government's conduct of the war in 'An Address to the People of Great Britain' (1798) was the subject of bitter attacks by the Unitarians and radicals Gilbert Wakefield and Benjamin Flower. These led to their trial and imprisonment, which Watson regretted but did nothing to prevent. In 1798 he reiterated his belief that the political principles 'on which the Revolution [of 1688-9] was founded... are in my judgement, principles best calculated to protect the liberty and property of the subject, and to secure the honour and happiness of the sovereign' (R. Watson, 'A Charge... to the Clergy of the Diocese of Llandaff', 1798, 2). Far from changing his principles Watson could be criticized for persisting in rigid Lockean concepts that were outdated both philosophically and politically. 
A student of mathematics before he turned his hand to chemistry, Watson came fresh to the study of religion on his appointment as regius professor of divinity in 1771. He then applied himself not to theology or patristics but to biblical study of the 'New Testament'. Like his mentor Edmund Law he soon established his latitudinarian credentials and was critical of the unreformed constitution in the church. He refused to support the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, arguing that it aimed to convert dissenters to Anglicanism not heathens to Christianity. In 1772 he gave some support to the Feathers tavern petition to relieve clergy and graduates of the universities of the need to subscribe to more than a statement of belief in the scriptures but he did so under the pseudonym of 'a Christian Whig' and his own trinitarian beliefs were never in doubt. He was more orthodox in his theology than many imagined. He steered 'an epistemological 'via media'' (Searby, 293) and had 'a becoming modesty about the possibility of theological knowledge' (Waterman, 'Via media', 427), which led him to tolerate all varieties of protestantism. In his six volumes of 'Theological Tracts' (1785), which reprinted twenty-four extracts from nineteen writers for 'young persons of every denomination' (1.v), he included works by a number of dissenters, even some Unitarians, insisting that he 'did not at all consider the quarter from whence the matter was taken, but whether it was good, and suited to my purpose' (1.xix). His aim was to establish the truth of Christianity and defend his young readers 'from that contagion of Infidelity which is the disgrace of the age' (1.ix); his target was deists not dissenters. He insisted: 'I do not conceive it to be any man's duty to anathematize those who cannot subscribe to 'his' catalogue of fundamental Christian verities. That man is not to be esteemed an 'Atheist', who acknowledges the existence of God the Creator of the universe... nor is he to be esteemed a 'Deist', who acknowledges that Jesus of Nazareth 'is indeed the' 'Christ'', the Saviour of the world', though he cannot assent to all the 'truths' of revealed religion which 'other' men may think themselves warranted in deducing from thence. (1.xv)' Watson was careful however to use only those arguments of these writers that were consonant with the beliefs of the Church of England; the extracts relate mainly to the 'Bible' and never discuss the doctrine of the Trinity. The views expressed, if not their authors, were orthodox. 
Watson recognized the need for an established church and was anxious not to undermine the constitution in church and state but he believed that the religious establishment needed reformation. After his elevation to the bench of bishops he proposed to Shelburne reforms in the church involving an equalization of episcopal revenues and increased provision for the lower clergy. Shelburne ignored the advice and Watson published the proposal in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury in 1783. In 1790 he suggested a revision of the liturgy and articles, which included the abolition of the Athanasian creed. Like many of his fellow bishops he recognized the need for the provision of new church buildings to accommodate the rapidly increasing population, and in April 1800 he suggested to Wilberforce a scheme for twenty new churches in London. As a disciple of Locke he was an advocate of religious toleration, supporting the attempt to repeal the 'Test and Corporation Acts' in 1787 and praising the religious toleration of the French national assembly in 1791. Originally hostile to the measure, in 1804 he supported Catholic emancipation. Twice in his career he came forward as a defender of the Christian faith: in 1776 his 'Apology for Christianity' addressed Gibbon's sceptical account of the growth of Christianity in 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'; twenty years later his 'Apology for the Bible' (1796) responded to the second part of Thomas Paine's deist 'Age of Reason', published in 1795. While his rejoinder to Gibbon was relaxed and courteous that to Paine was urgent and anxious; the debate was no longer an intellectual exercise but a crucial defence of the political and social order. 
At Lancaster on 21 December 1773 Watson married Dorothy (1750-1831), daughter of Edward Wilson of Dallam Tower, Milnthorpe, Westmorland. The Wilsons were one of the most important families in Watson's home county and benefactors of the grammar school at Heversham. Although the Watsons had six children and appeared conventionally happy Dorothy is hardly mentioned in her husband's 'Anecdotes' and, as his biographer acutely observes, 'women do not appear to have played a very significant part in Watson's life' (Brain, 15). His thirty-year-long close friendship with his fellow student John Luther appears to have been of much greater emotional importance to Watson. When in 1764 Luther left his wife Watson borrowed the money to rush to Paris to support and rescue his friend: 'I crossed the channel four times, and travelled twelve hundred miles in very bad weather in a fortnight, I brought my friend back to this country' ('Anecdotes', 28). Watson, who had named his eldest son Charles Luther Watson, was at his friend's bedside when he died on 13 January 1786. The childless Luther left him his large Sussex estate, which Watson sold for the huge sum of $23,500. This gave him the financial independence that hitherto he had lacked and enabled him to retire from Cambridge and, in 1788, buy Calgarth, a large estate on the shores of Windermere, between Ambleside and Bowness. In the early 1790s he built a new house, Calgarth Park, where house-guests included Wilberforce, Coleridge, Walter Scott, and the duke of Orleans, later Louis XVIII of France. Watson became 'the leading person about the Lakes... a joyous, jovial and cordial host... pleasant and kind in his manners... overbearing and arrogant in argument' (De Quincey, 83-6). Watson claimed that he had not wasted his time at Calgarth but had spent it 'principally in building farm-houses, blasting rocks, enclosing wastes, in making bad land good, in planting larches' ('Anecdotes', 240). A friend of Arthur Young, he was soon a keen and knowledgeable landowner and an improving farmer; in 1793 he became one of the first members of the newly founded board of agriculture. 
Watson was no genius but an able man whose relatively humble origins required him to make his own fortune. He successfully turned his hand to chemistry and divinity and ecclesiastical politics when his career demanded it and happily abandoned them when that need disappeared. His friend's generosity permitted him to become a landowner and improving farmer and it was as such that he found contentment. But he was perhaps less important than his reputation suggested. The legend of the radical bishop who supported revolution and later turned apostate concealed the duller reality of a consistent, independent-minded but rather old-fashioned whig. Watson had a habit of destroying his papers when he had no more use for them: in 1786 he announced that he had destroyed all his chemical manuscripts; in 1811 his papers on divinity went the same way. It is probable that about 1814, having constructed his own version of his life in the 'Anecdotes' (a version that frankly exposed his ambition, disappointment, and bitterness), he destroyed all the personal and political papers in his possession; none appears to have survived. In July 1781 he fell gravely ill with a 'paralysis of the stomach' ('Anecdotes', 87) from which he never fully recovered; in 1804 he complained that 'the original disorder, which seized me twenty-four years ago, is not removed' (ibid., 395). He suffered paralytic strokes in October 1809 and April 1811 and endured increasing ill health until his death at Calgarth Park on 4 July 1816. He was buried on 13 July in the graveyard of his local parish church of St Martin at Bowness. He is commemorated in a stone memorial by John Flaxman, depicting his mitre and crozier and five of his published works, in the church's rose room.

Watson, Richard (1781-1833), Wesleyan Methodist minister and theologian, was born on 22 February 1781 at Barton-on-Humber, Lincolnshire, the seventh of the eighteen children of Thomas Watson (1741/2-1812), a saddler, and his wife, Ann Watson. Though early connected with Methodism, Thomas became a Calvinistic dissenter and gave Richard a religious upbringing among dissenters and the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion. He had a good classical education, beginning Latin at the age of six, entering Lincoln grammar school in 1791, and eagerly acquiring literary and general knowledge. In 1795 he was apprenticed to a joiner in Lincoln. After being somewhat careless about religion, attendance at a Wesleyan chapel to learn arguments against Calvinism led to his conversion in 1794. Speaking in public prayer meetings led to his first sermon on 23 February 1796 aged fifteen, then to preaching in villages, sometimes in the open air. His master having released him from apprenticeship, he assisted the Wesleyan preacher at Newark, and was received as an itinerant preacher on trial in 1796 and into full connection in 1801. In 1800 he published 'An Apology for the Methodists' in answer to a local Anglican attack. 
In 1801, however, Watson's theological and philosophical reading and love of argument led to suspicions that he had denied the full divinity of Christ. Though the charge was apparently unjust and not formally presented, Watson took offence and left the Wesleyan ministry. After a failure in business, he married in 1801 Mary Henslow of Castle Donington, Leicestershire, the daughter of a Methodist New Connexion local preacher. This led him to join that denomination as a local, then as an itinerant, preacher on probation (1803) and in full connection (1807). His abilities were recognized by his appointment as assistant secretary of conference in 1805 and secretary in 1807. Meanwhile, during stationing in Liverpool (1806-8) with time for study and literary work, he published a popular guide to Liverpool and expounded conservative politics as editor of the 'Liverpool Courier' (1808). Poor health forced him to become a supernumerary in 1809, but he resumed his active ministry and secretaryship of conference in 1810. Meanwhile he became dissatisfied with the Methodist New Connexion's subordination of the ministry to the laity, became friendly with the leading Wesleyan Jabez Bunting, and wrote against the 1811 attempt to restrict the 'Toleration Act'. He then resigned from the Methodist New Connexion, was soon accepted as a local preacher by the Wesleyans, and in 1812 was reinstated as a Wesleyan itinerant. 
Wesleyans had worked overseas for many years without a formal missionary society. Stimulated by competition from existing societies, in 1813 they began forming local missionary societies and Watson became deeply involved. In 1816 he was made a connectional missionary secretary responsible for home correspondence, reports, and publications. In 1817 he drew up a plan for a national Wesleyan missionary society, accepted by the conference in 1818. He became the leading advocate and most successful speaker and fund-raiser for Wesleyan missions. His annual reports, with their persistently optimistic and triumphalist tone, did much to shape policy. From 1821 to 1827 and again in 1832 he became a full-time missionary secretary in London. His missionary concerns led him to write his 'Defence of the Wesleyan Methodist Missions in the West Indies' (1817) and to support the anti-slavery campaign. He drafted the resolution in favour of emancipation adopted by the missionary committee in 1825 and by the conference in 1830. He claimed that 'Christianity will not snap the chains of the slave but it will melt them' (Stevenson, 566). In 1826 he was elected president of conference for that year. 
Watson, along with Jabez Bunting and Robert Newton, was credited with introducing more style and refinement into Wesleyan pulpit oratory, his sermons being characterized by measured eloquence and a poetic use of language. A keen naturalist, he liked to descant on the beauty and harmony to be found between the natural and moral worlds. 
Watson's theological ability was first shown in his 'Remarks on the Eternal Sonship and the Use of Reason in Matters of Religion' (1818), in which (perhaps sensitive to the old charge of Arianism) he defended the traditional doctrine of the eternal sonship of Christ against Adam Clarke's denial of it. He also firmly subordinated reason to revelation, and his attack on Clarke probably helped to antagonize Clarke's admirers in later disputes. His 'Theological Institutes' (1823-8) was the first systematic theology by a Wesleyan, covering the evidence, doctrines, morals, and institutions of Christianity 'adapted to the use of young ministers and students in divinity', 'neither Calvinistic on the one hand nor Pelagian on the other' ('Theological Institutes', preface). As an exposition of evangelical Arminianism it was certainly 'Wesleyan', yet it contained few references to Wesley's writings despite defending Wesley's doctrines of assurance and perfection as scriptural. These findings were, however, absorbed into an evangelical version of scholastic protestant theology, upheld by the stock 'evidences' of miracle and prophecy. He rejected any compromise between 'Genesis' and geology. He defended Wesley's teaching that perfection can be both a process and an instantaneous experience; but, unlike Adam Clarke, he preferred to see it as a gradual development. 
In his 'Observations on Southey's Life of Wesley' (1820) Watson, while recognizing Southey's literary qualities and superiority to most of Wesley's critics, attacked him severely for charging Wesley with ambition and credulity. He saw Southey as undermining Christianity as well as Methodism by his failure to understand salvation doctrine and his naturalistic explanations of religious phenomena. Though some thought his strictures overdone, the prince regent is said to have remarked that 'Mr Watson has the advantage of my laureate' (Jackson, 326). In his own 'Life of Wesley' (1831) Watson aimed to produce a biography for general readers, though with some original material. He saw Wesley's theology as being permanently settled in terms of justification by faith after his 1738 conversion, thereby failing to recognize Wesley's later emphasis on sanctification and perfection. He offered some cautious criticisms of the Wesley brothers, but his claim that Wesley had effectively ordained all his lay preachers (and not simply those on whom he formally laid hands) reflected later Wesleyan disputes and Anglican criticisms. 
Though Watson was not hostile to the Church of England and liked the Anglican liturgy, he was convinced that Wesleyan Methodism was now an independent church and he upheld Wesleyan ministerial authority. Adumbrated in his 'Institutes', this authority was hammered home in his 'Affectionate Address' (1829) to the protestant Methodists who favoured greater lay control. While arguing that Wesleyan rules offered safeguards against abuse of ministerial power, Watson asserted that the duties given by God to 'the office of a Christian pastor' for oversight and discipline of the people meant that 'the powers needed to fulfil these [duties] are therefore of right, inalienable right, belonging to his office' ('Affectionate Address', 7). 
Watson's comprehensive 'Theological and Biblical Dictionary' (1831) was largely a compilation from conservative authorities. The supplement to the Wesleyan hymnbook (1831) was mainly selected by him. (He favoured congregational singing rather than choirs though he cautiously allowed for organs.) He also contributed solid reviews to the 'Wesleyan Methodist Magazine'. Despite some criticisms by the admirers of Adam Clarke, the conference bought his surviving manuscripts for $2000. 
Watson had stood 6 feet 2 inches since the age of fourteen. He was extremely slender, with a lofty forehead, dark brown hair, piercing eyes, and a dignified bearing. Though lively when young, in later years his emaciated appearance and reputation for coldness and reserve, especially in mixed company, were probably aggravated if not actually caused by ill health. A clear and mellow voice added force to his preaching. His biographer Thomas Jackson complained that much could not be known about Watson's inner life because he destroyed his private papers. 
With Jabez Bunting and Robert Newton, Watson stood among the dominant figures of his generation in Wesleyan Methodism. Though prominent as a preacher and as an upholder of the high-Wesleyan view of the ministry, he was especially significant for his theology and culture. His only intellectual rival was Adam Clarke, who was more of a polymath but theologically less focused and more eccentric. Clarke was a hero to revivalist and reforming Wesleyans, and he and Watson were often seen as leaders of rival parties, apparently to Watson's regret. 
Watson died in London on 8 January 1833 from a long-standing gall bladder and liver condition, and was buried behind City Road Chapel, London, on 15 January. His marriage to Mary, who survived him, produced two children, Thomas and Mary (who married James Dixon).

Watson, Robert (d. 1559), lawyer and evangelical preacher, was born in the city of Norwich. He was admitted BCL at Oxford on 1 July 1528. Nothing else is known about Watson before 1539. On 23 February that year, Bishop William Rugge preached a sermon at Norwich arguing that good works played a qualified role in the attainment of salvation. Watson called on the bishop the next day and vigorously criticized the sermon, denying that humans had free will. Rumours about the encounter circulated, the matter escalated, and Rugge, intimidated by the number of Watson's supporters, denounced his critic to the authorities. This manoeuvre backfired. Thomas Cromwell summoned Watson to London and interrogated him about the incident. Cromwell was so impressed with Watson that he wrote to the mayor and aldermen of Norwich, recommending that Watson be given a municipal office. The Norwich civic leaders wrote back to Cromwell declaring that, because they knew Watson to be learned in both scripture and law, they would make him town clerk. Watson, however, never took the post, probably because even greater opportunities were available elsewhere. 
It is likely that Cromwell had recommended Watson to Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, as well as to the city fathers of Norwich. John Bale claimed that Watson became Cranmer's steward. There is no corroboration for this and Watson seems to have spent a considerable amount of time away from Cranmer's household. But Bale's statement cannot be lightly dismissed. He and Watson shared a close friend in John Barrett, a former Carmelite and popular evangelical preacher in Norwich, so Bale would have been well informed about Watson. Furthermore, Watson was described in a document of 1550 as a priest in Cranmer's household. In any case, Watson had unmistakable official support in building a career in the church, despite having never been ordained. Early in Edward VI's reign he was granted a national preaching licence, in which he was inaccurately styled 'Professor of Divinity' (TNA: PRO, SP 10/2/34, fol. 116'r'). Then on 26 May 1549 he received a prebend in Norwich Cathedral despite his not being a priest and despite (as the letters patent for the living noted) his having been married twice. This benefice suggests that, whatever his connection to Cranmer's household, Watson remained active in his native Norwich. In 1548 a member of the confraternity of St George in Norwich was stripped of his civic privileges for refusing, on religious grounds, to provide the annual feast for the members of the confraternity. Watson not only used his legal skills to defend the man, he also had the case brought before the privy council. Protector Somerset ordered that Watson's client have his privileges restored. 
Watson was also prominent in the early stages of the most momentous event in the history of Tudor Norwich: Kett's rebellion. He preached to the rebels and was one of a trio of leading Norwich residents (including the mayor) elected as nominal leaders of the rising. As protest escalated into overt rebellion and events spun out of control, the trio fell out with Kett and were imprisoned by the rebels. None of this harmed Watson's relationship with Cranmer; in the following year, 1550, he received one of the plum livings in the archbishop's gift, the rectory of Saltwood, in Kent. 
Mary's accession to the throne deprived Watson of his patron and his livings, but worse was to follow. Early in 1554 Henry Crook, the mayor of Norwich, questioned Watson about his failure to attend mass; Watson answered that attending mass was against his conscience and refused ever to be present when it was celebrated. He was arrested and formally examined by the civic authorities, and then imprisoned while they wrote to the privy council for instructions. The council ordered that Watson be sent to London. This time, instead of meeting an appreciative Cromwell, Watson faced a blistering interrogation by Stephen Gardiner. He refused to submit, and in February 1554 was returned to Norwich, where on the council's order he was placed in the custody of Miles Spencer, the chancellor of the diocese. Watson was confined in the episcopal palace, and by his own account was well treated, although he was denied visitors. 
In spring 1555 John Barrett, now a loyal Catholic, wrote to Watson urging him to recant and trying to persuade him of the truth of the real presence in the sacrament. More ominously, John Christopherson, the dean of Norwich, visited Watson and debated eucharistic theology with him. Eventually Watson was given a statement to sign, declaring his unqualified belief in transubstantiation. Watson signed the document but not before adding the crucial proviso: 'I assent to all these [doctrines] in so far as they are based on the Word of God and in the sense in which they are understood by the catholic Church and by the holy fathers' (Watson, 'Aetiologia', sig. G3'r'- 'v'). The document was witnessed by Christopherson, Spencer, Barrett, Thomas Pecock (a prebendary of Norwich Cathedral), and Alexander Mather, a Norwich alderman who had been active in persecuting Watson. The document was seized upon by the authorities; it was read aloud in St Peter Mancroft, one of Norwich's leading churches, during services. 
Yet subscribing to the document did not end Watson's troubles. He was detained in prison for another five weeks before being released in late spring 1555. John Young, the vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, objected that Watson's signed statement was not sufficient and demanded that Watson sign an unqualified declaration of belief in transubstantiation. Orders were given that Watson be rearrested but he went into hiding. Although two Norwich aldermen, Thomas Codde and Thomas Marsham, zealously pursued the fugitive, Watson's friends successfully threw them off his trail and concealed him. He soon fled overseas to Emden. 
From this haven Watson wrote an account of his Marian ordeals, the 'Aetiologia', which was designed to demonstrate that he had emerged from them 'unharmed in body and undiminished in conscience' (Watson, 'Aetiologia', title-page). The book was finished by November 1555 and published (only in Latin) in Emden in 1556. Beyond this little is known of Watson's activities in exile, although he and John Scory apparently debated the subject of free will with Wouter Delenus, a leading member of the Emden reformed community. The wheel had come full circle: Watson sprang into prominence championing predestination and his last known public activity was to defend the doctrine in disputation. Having returned to England, Watson died in 1559, when his will was proved.

Watson, Robert (fl. 1581-1611), almanac maker, matriculated as a sizar of Queens' College, Cambridge, on 22 November 1581 and graduated BA from Clare College in 1585. He had returned to Queens' College by 1589, in which year he was licensed by the university to practise physic. He lived at Braintree, Essex, where he combined the study of medicine with that of astrology. He published for several years an almanac containing a forecast for the year. The earliest surviving example is for the year 1594, the latest for 1611. 
John Mott of Braintree, who had been with the earl of Essex on the expedition to Cadiz in 1596, has recently been identified as the author of a 30,000 line Jacobean poem by J.M. (now BL, Add. MSS 14824-14826) of which book 8, composed about 1621-5, consists of a series of Chaucerian tales told by the ship's crew on the return voyage. The ship's cook recounts the story of Mott's Braintree neighbour 'Nostaw', (the name disguised by inversion of its letters). The poem begins '
Nostaw sometimes skild in Astronomie' 

mongst th' Country Medices held he soveraigntie 

for both those Arts he certainly profest... 

Quod gratis grate was his motto still 

wch wth his practice suited very ill 

his Lying-bookes at highest rate he sold 

he could not give his physicke though he would 

Eger & Indiges evermore did knock 
(BL, Add. MS 14825, fol. 171'r'- 'v')' The poem runs on with the increasingly scurrilous tale of Watson's seduction of one of his patients, of his being afflicted with the pox, trying to keep this fact from his wife, and ultimately dying of this disease. 
Nothing is known of Watson's later years nor of his date of death.

Watson, Robert (1730?-1781), historian and rhetorician, was born in St Andrews, the son of Andrew Watson, an apothecary and brewer. Nothing is known of his early years, though records show he studied at St Andrews University from 1744 to 1748, receiving his MA degree on 6 May 1748. He subsequently spent time in Glasgow and Edinburgh, perhaps taking some classes at their respective universities. While in Edinburgh he probably attended the rhetoric lectures given by Adam Smith in 1748-9, and at the same time he is said to have 'secured the countenance, approbation, and friendship of Lord Kames, Mr Hume, and other eminent men of that day' (Anderson, 740). When Smith left Edinburgh in 1751 to assume the chair of logic at Glasgow, Kames recruited Watson to continue the series of rhetoric lectures. Watson's exact dates of lecturing are not known, but they must have been some time between 1751 and 1756, when, having been licensed by the presbytery of St Andrews, he applied for a vacancy in a St Andrews parish. Although denied that position, he then sought to replace the retiring Henry Rymer as professor of logic, rhetoric, and metaphysics at St Andrews. Watson received the appointment on 18 June 1756. 
After a year in his academic appointment Watson married Margaret Shaw, the daughter of the professor of divinity in St Mary's College, on 29 June 1757; they subsequently had five daughters. He taught courses in rhetoric and 'belles-lettres' and in logic; various sets of student notes survive for both courses as they were delivered between 1756 and 1778. He does not appear to have taught a separate course in metaphysics. His lectures clearly reflect the new trends in rhetoric and logic developed by the Scottish Enlightenment. In logic he gave a prominent place to Locke, as did Thomas Reid at Aberdeen, John Stevenson at Edinburgh, and James Clow at Glasgow. In rhetoric he joined figures such as Adam Smith, Hugh Blair, and George Campbell in rethinking rhetoric in terms of human nature, thus linking rhetoric, through psychology, to ethics, aesthetics, and criticism. In neither logic nor rhetoric, however, was Watson a strongly original thinker; instead, his work is valuable in offering 'a general contribution to our understanding of the scope, method, and role of rhetoric in the Scottish university curriculum in the eighteenth century' (Bator, 104). 
Watson was also active in university business outside the classroom. He was instrumental in having honorary degrees conferred on Hugh Blair (1757) and Benjamin Franklin (1759), but perhaps his most important assignment was the expansion of the university library, which included both gathering library materials and overseeing the construction of improved facilities. These concerns for the university helped prepare him for more important administrative assignments. From the time of his rhetoric lectures in Edinburgh he had maintained close ties with the moderate party leadership in the church. Thus, on 9 January 1778 -- following a plan formed several years earlier by the earl of Kinnoul and moderate colleagues such as William Robertson -- Watson was named principal of St Andrews University, and, later that year, rector of the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard in the University of St Andrews, succeeding Thomas Tullidelph, who had died after years of failing health in November 1777. Watson was a genial, scholarly representative of the university. When James Boswell and Samuel Johnson visited St Andrews in 1773 they found him to be 'a well-informed man, of very amiable manners', and they spent some time discussing Watson's 'favourite topick' of composition (Boswell, 66-8). The United College -- the main buildings of which Watson had actually purchased in 1772 to house his family -- 'seemed quite academical; and we found in his house very comfortable and genteel accommodation' (ibid., 58). Johnson, who later edited Watson's two histories, observed that Watson's 'easy civility quickly made us forget that we were strangers; and in the whole time of our stay we were gratified by every mode of kindness, and entertained with all the elegance of lettered hospitality' (Johnson, 'Journey', 5). 
Despite Watson's work in rhetoric and education, he remains best known for his two histories. 'The History of the Reign of Philip the Second, King of Spain' was published in two volumes in London by Strahan and Cadell in 1777, with six further editions appearing between 1778 and 1812. 'The History of the Reign of Philip the Third, King of Spain' was left incomplete at his death. The first four books of this were transcribed directly from Watson's manuscripts, the last two were added by William Thomson, and the whole published in 1783 by Robinson. Both histories form a sequel to William Robertson's 'History of the Reign of Charles V' (1769), being generally modelled on that earlier work in terms of structure and style as well as their broad conception of Philip II's character. Like Robertson, Watson faced the problem of unifying his subject around the life and career of his central figure, with the result that there is a constant tension between the great dispersion of events in the Habsburg empire and the biography of the ruler. As a rhetorician, however, Watson was very sensitive to the importance of unity in history, and his ability to create smooth transitions among events was praised by reviewers. Watson also wore his learning very lightly, having none of the heavier annotation or learned appendices of Hume or Robertson. He did not often cite manuscript or archival sources in his histories, though at the time of his death he was in possession of some of the earl of Hardwicke's manuscripts that he was consulting in his research for 'Philip the Third'. Instead Watson seems even more insistent than his fellow historians in aiming for a polite audience, one more interested in moral education than in the details of historical interpretation. Both histories may, in fact, be read as illustrations of the dangers of narrow education and 'illiberal superstition' ('History of... Philip the Second', 1.2). Watson attributed the bloody struggles of Philip II's reign to Philip's narrow Catholic education in which he 'had imbibed, in all its virulence, that spirit of bigotry and persecution, which gave birth to the inquisition' (ibid., 1.93). Watson thought Philip III an even greater failure, combining his father's 'bigotted ['sic'] attachment to the superstition of the church of Rome' with a strong aversion 'to almost every species of manly exertion and activity' ('History of... Philip the Third', 3rd edn, 1808, 1.1-2). In contrast Watson describes Philip II's arch-rival, the prince of Orange, as the embodiment of moderate-party educational ideals: flexible, adaptable, polite, and possessed of 'a peculiar dexterity in governing the inclinations of men, and in conciliating and preserving their affections' ('History of... Philip the Second', 2.166). 
Watson died unexpectedly on 31 March 1781 in St Andrews. Almost immediately the wheels were set in motion through Robertson for another well-established moderate, Joseph MacCormick, to succeed as principal. Watson's cousin Hugh Blair was asked by John Davidson, the executor of the estate, to be responsible for handling Watson's papers dealing with history and literary-financial affairs. In a sermon of 1793 Alexander Carlyle included Watson in his retrospective list of moderate-party clergymen who he felt had brought particular lustre to the Scottish church through their accomplishments in polite learning. Watson thus takes his place as a fine example of a liberally educated Presbyterian clergyman, the unique creation of the Scottish Enlightenment.

Watson, Robert (1746?-1838), revolutionary and adventurer, was born in Elgin. A Robert Watson, son of a horse hirer, Robert Watson, and his wife, Catherine Demster, was baptized there on 29 June 1746, but at his death in 1838 Watson was described as eighty-eight years old. Throughout his life Watson confused and embroidered details of his career. The credence hitherto given to 1746 as his birth date rests mainly on accepting unverified claims that he had fought with the American army during the American War of Independence (and had achieved the rank of colonel, been wounded, and in recompense been granted land). These claims, made to the artist who painted his portrait in 1817, seem not to have been made elsewhere. Moreover by 1780 Watson was living in London and working as the private secretary to Lord George Gordon. Shortly before his death Watson claimed to have been deeply implicated in the riots of 1780. This is more plausible but, like the medical degree from a Scottish university of which he boasted, cannot be verified. 
However, in August 1794 Watson did help foment a riot in London against coercive recruiting and was sentenced to two years in Newgate for circulating a handbill attacking the 'Militia Act' and magistracy. While in prison he wrote a 'Life of Lord George Gordon' which 'inter alia' welcomed the fall of the Bastille as 'a step to universal emancipation' (p. 91). Watson also attacked continental Catholic clergy for their opposition to the French Revolution in the 'Moral and Political Magazine' (March 1796) of the London Corresponding Society, which he had joined in 1792. Once released from Newgate, Watson was soon predicting the people would swiftly have 'recourse to steel' ('Moral and Political Magazine', March 1797). A member of the society's executive, he was one of two delegates it sent to consult with the leaders of the Spithead naval mutiny in 1797. They were accompanied, perhaps without the executive's sanction, by a representative of the United Irishmen. How far the society's subsequent repudiation of Watson reflected a loss of nerve or was meant to obscure its complicity in revolutionary conspiracy is debatable. Watson was now communicating with the French agent at Hamburg about Britain's readiness for revolution, claiming that 50,000 Scots and 200,000 English were waiting on a French invasion as their cue for rising. In April 1798, on hearing a warrant had been issued for his arrest, Watson fled abroad. After travelling through Scandinavia and Germany he arrived in Paris in September. 
For a brief period Watson was the principal English republican envoy in France. He issued a grandiloquent 'Address to the people of Great Britain' ('Moniteur', 4 frimaire, an VII [24 Nov 1798]). In July 1799, in a memorial to the governing directory, he claimed (falsely) to be president of the London Corresponding Society and disclosed plans for provincial British radicals to greet a French invasion with a series of uprisings to force the dispersal of troops away from London and the south coast. Watson claimed briefly to have been English tutor to Napoleon, who appointed him to the presidency (1800-06) of the Scottish College in Paris, a secular revival of the medieval foundation dispossessed at the revolution. He also travelled to Italy where (in an effort to support the beleaguered Napoleonic economy) he tried unsuccessfully to cultivate cotton on the Pontine marshes. In 1817 he became involved in a dispute with the Vatican over the ownership of papers that had belonged to Cardinal York, the Jacobite pretender Henry IX. Watson was instrumental in their acquisition by the British government, for which he was financially rewarded (inadequately he vehemently claimed) and the arrest warrant of 1798 annulled. Watson was also connected, possibly through marriage, to the aide-de-camp to the Young Pretender (Charles Edward Stuart), James Johnstone, the manuscript of whose history of the 1745 rising he sold to Longmans on returning to Britain in 1820. 
Details of the later years of Watson's life are as opaque as the earliest. He spent some time in Greece but seems to have lived mainly in France. In 1825 he was writing from Paris begging for money needed, he said, to recover various possessions including the missal of Mary, queen of Scots, and the Constantinople 'Bible'. By early 1838 he was living once again in London, at the Blue Anchor tavern, Thames Street, St Mary-at-Hill. There, on 19 November, he strangled himself by twisting his silk cravat with a poker as tourniquet. A 'little lame man', his body was found to bear the scars of nineteen previous wounds. The 'Gentleman's Magazine' reported that 'the body of the wretched old man was conveyed to the grave as that of a pauper, at the expense of the parish' ('GM', 2nd ser., 11/1, 1839, 328). 
Watson's Jacobitism represents a significant strand in British radicalism. His continued attachment to Jacobinism may be reasonably inferred from the identity of the friend who arranged his affairs after his death: Colonel Francis Macerone, sometime Italian revolutionary and aide-de-camp to Murat, whose writings on street fighting had been circulating among English ultra-radicals since the reform crisis.

Watson, Rundle Burges (1809-1860), naval officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson (1772-1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted lieutenant on 7 October 1829. He served on the coast of Portugal and on the North American station, until in November 1837 he was appointed to the frigate 'Calliope' (26 guns), with Captain Thomas Herbert (1793-1861). After two years on the coast of Brazil the 'Calliope' was sent to China, where she was actively employed during the First Opium War. On 6 May 1841 Watson was promoted commander, and was moved with Herbert to the 'Blenheim' (72 guns), and while in her was repeatedly engaged with the enemy, in command of either boats or landing parties. On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and on 24 December was made a CB. 
On 1 February 1845 Watson married Helen, second daughter of John Bettington of Pittville; and they had a large family. From February 1846 to October 1849 he commanded the small frigate 'Brilliant' (20 guns) on the Cape of Good Hope station; and in December 1852 was appointed to the new steam frigate 'Imperieuse' (50 guns), then, and for some years later, considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The 'Imperieuse' continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service, Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and leadership. After the peace the 'Imperieuse' was sent to the North American station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856 until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July 1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great sailing-ship captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam era.

Watson, Samuel (bap. 1662, d. 1715), sculptor, was born at Heanor in Derbyshire, the son of Ralph Watson (died 1713), husbandman of Heanor, and his wife, Bridget Townsend (died 1718); he was baptized there on 2 December 1662. Little is known of his early life until he was apprenticed to Charles Oakey, a carver of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. He probably worked under Oakey about 1683 as a woodcarver on the first duke of Beaufort's house at Badminton and is known to have worked under another London carver, Thomas Young, for the earl of Exeter at Burghley House, and briefly for George Vernan at Sudbury Hall. Grinling Gibbons, who also worked at Badminton, Burghley, and Sudbury, had a great influence on Watson's subsequent work. 
The earl of Exeter passed on Young and Watson to his brother-in-law the fourth earl (first duke in 1694) of Devonshire, and they arrived at Chatsworth in 1690-91. In 1692 Watson became the principal carver there when, following a dispute over their wages, the earl dismissed his architect, John Talman, and most of the London and foreign craftsmen. He retained Watson until 1711, and the carver became an assistant to Sir Christopher Wren in his independent valuation of the work done by Talman's team. His outstanding carvings at Chatsworth, especially in the chapel, are in limewood, stone, alabaster, and marble and his skill was praised by his contemporary George Vertue who described him as 'a most engenious artist' ('Walpole Society', 20, 1931-2). Watson also executed commissions for other clients, including vases for the gardens at Melbourne Hall and an unidentified monument for the duke of Newcastle. 
Watson's work at Chatsworth has traditionally been attributed to Grinling Gibbons; this theory, first advanced by the earl of Egmont in 1744 and by Horace Walpole in 1760, is still current among contemporary commentators. The myth has prevailed despite the fact that many payments to Watson are recorded in the accounts at Chatsworth and his various preparatory drawings survive there. Among the latter are drawings by Watson of work by Gibbons, which have confused scholars; Gibbons himself was certainly never at Chatsworth. 
Most prominent among Watson's works at Chatsworth are the famous limewood cravat and the portrait medallion in a glass case, first claimed as Gibbons's work by Horace Walpole. The medallion is of special interest, as it may well bear the only surviving likeness of the carver. Watson was married to Katherine Greensmith ('c'.1679-1739) of Pilsley, a Chatsworth estate village, and they retired to Heanor, where he died of a stroke; he was buried at Heanor on 31 March 1715. He left two sons, Henry (1714-1786), and the posthumous Samuel the younger (1715-1778). Both were trained as carvers, as too was Samuel the younger's son White Watson (1760-1835), who designed his grandfather's monument in Heanor church. Drawings by Watson are held in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and at Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, but the main collections of his designs are at Chatsworth, and the Derbyshire Record Office at Matlock.

Watson, Thomas (1513-1584), bishop of Lincoln, was born in 1513 in the diocese of Durham, probably at Nunstainton near Sedgefield. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1533. The humanist training he received there was to permeate all his later thought. Roger Ascham, his contemporary at St John's, refers to Watson in his 'Scholemaster' as one of the best scholars ever bred by that college, and writes admiringly of his tragedy 'Absolom'. Watson is also recorded as producing a translation of the 'Odyssey', now lost, and a version of a sermon of St Cyprian. In his time he was known for his good humour as well as for his scholarship and other merits; it would appear that his posthumous reputation for being morose and sullen, as propounded by writers like Burnet and Strype, is unfounded in fact. 
Watson became a fellow of St John's in 1533, and proceeded MA in 1536. He received his degree in theology in 1543, the year in which he became domestic chaplain to Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, who collated him to two benefices in his patronage. In 1547 he added the vicarage of Buckminster, Leicestershire. He assisted Gardiner in opposing many of the changes of religion taking place in the early part of Edward VI's reign. On one occasion in that reign he preached a sermon in the north of England that almost led to his arrest and prosecution for treason. He was saved by the intervention of John Rough, formerly a Dominican and now a noted protestant preacher in Hull. When in December 1557 Rough was brought before the bishop of London charged with heresy, Watson did not return the favour. Rough appealed to Watson for clemency on the basis of their encounter in the previous reign, only to be stigmatized by him as a pestilent heretic who had done much hurt in the north; Rough was burnt at Smithfield. As chaplain to Gardiner, Watson was confined with him in the Fleet during 1550 and 1551, and was called as a witness at the bishop's trial, though in December 1551 he is found taking part in private discussions on the sacraments at the house of Sir Richard Morison. 
After the accession of Mary, Watson continued to be an active promoter of the old faith. Throughout the reign he was a noted preacher and controversialist. On 20 August 1553, he gave a sermon at Paul's Cross in London before the mayor and aldermen, with the guilds in their livery, as well as several members of the council who had been sent by the queen to keep order. It was feared that the serious disorder that had accompanied the previous Sunday's sermon would be repeated, so Sir John Jerningham was dispatched with a guard of 200 men with bills and halberds, who stood around the pulpit and in the churchyard. Mary's bishop of London, Edmund Bonner, watched the proceedings from a window. 
On 25 September 1553 Watson was sent by Gardiner, then chancellor of the University of Cambridge, to the vice-chancellor and senate of the university to act on his behalf in restoring the old religion, and to report back to him on the state of the colleges. On arrival Watson was admitted as master of St John's, and soon afterwards received his doctorate in theology. By 18 October, he was back in London, where he was a proctor at the meeting of convocation at St Paul's, as a firm advocate of the Catholic cause. Further ecclesiastical preferment followed, when on 18 November he became dean of Durham. His note as a preacher led to his being called in the following year to give two of the Lenten sermons before the queen on the third and fourth Fridays, in support of the traditional teaching about the real presence of Christ in the eucharist and the sacrificial nature of the mass (these were published as 'Twoo notable sermons... concerninge the reall presence of Christes body and bloude in the blessed sacrament; also the masse, which is the sacrifice of the Newe Testament', London, 1554; STC 25115). 
Watson resigned the mastership of St John's in May 1554. He became actively involved in the prosecution of heresy, and took part in proceedings against John Hooper and others. In December 1556 he was appointed to the bishopric of Lincoln; his election by the cathedral chapter took place on 7 January 1557. Between his election and consecration he received a commission from Cardinal Pole to carry out a visitation of the University of Cambridge. Arriving there on 9 January 1557, he preached a sermon on Sunday 31 January in King's College against the doctrines of Martin Bucer, and promoting the restoration of certain ceremonies, referring particularly to the traditional usage of candles in procession on Candlemas (2 February). On the following Saturday (6 February), he preached at some length in Great St Mary's Church against the 'wyckedness and heretycall doctryn' (Cooper, 'Ath. Cantab.', 1.492) of Martin Bucer (whose remains were interred there) and his fellow Cambridge reformer Paul Fagius, who was buried in St Michael's Church. Later that day the remains of Bucer and Fagius were disinterred and burnt publicly in the market place. 
Over the next few months Watson is noted by the diarist Henry Machyn as preaching in London on a number of occasions: on 27 March before the queen, on 4 April at All Hallows-the-Great, 'wher was grett audyens of pepull', and on 22 April 'a godly sermon' at St Mary Spital ('Diary of Henry Machyn', 131). The papal bull providing him to Lincoln was issued on 24 or 25 March, and in May he was given licence by Cardinal Pole to hold the deanery of Durham 'in commendam' with his bishopric. He was consecrated bishop at Chiswick on 15 August by Archbishop Nicholas Heath of York (acting under commission from Pole), assisted by Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and William Glynn, bishop of Bangor. Watson's enthronement in his cathedral took place by proxy on 10 October, and in person on 15-16 October. After his appointment he was active in restoring property to his cathedral church, including vestments, plate, and other furniture, and on 9 November obtained by letters patent a grant of some estates alienated ten years previously along with the patronage of a number of benefices in his diocese which had belonged to religious houses before the Henrician dissolutions. As bishop he continued his active preaching, and is recorded as giving 'a godly sermon' at Paul's Cross in London on 20 February 1558 before the lord mayor, aldermen, ten bishops, judges and lawyers, and a great audience. He also produced a book of sermons, 'Holsome and catholyke doctryne concerninge the seven sacramentes... set forth in maner of shorte sermons' (1558; STC 25112 ff.), for use in parish churches where the parish priest was not able or qualified to preach; this was one of a number of responses to the drive by Cardinal Pole to reform and revive the English church in the Catholic faith by the provision of educational material for the laity. 
Watson's career was curtailed by the death of Queen Mary on 17 November of that year, and the accession of Elizabeth. He was one of the bishops appointed to dispute with a number of reformers at Westminster Abbey on 3 April 1559. The proceedings broke down when the bishops failed to produce the questions for their opponents that had been required of them. That night Watson, along with John White, bishop of Winchester, was sent by water to the Tower. The bishops were each allowed one of their own servants, and their own bedding and furniture. It is at this point that the sickness, which was to plague Watson for the rest of his life, first became apparent. The council instructed the lieutenant of the Tower to treat the bishops well, 'specially the Bysshopp of Lyncolne, for that he is syck' ('APC', '1558-70', 78). Watson was permitted to join the lieutenant at his table 'for the better relief of his quartayne ague' (ibid., 93-4). 
On 25 July Watson was deprived of his bishopric, and the next day released from confinement. A year later, on 26 June 1560, he was again sent to the Tower, whence he was discharged into the custody of Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, then to Edmund Guest (or Gheast) of Rochester, and finally to Richard Cox of Ely. According to Brady there is a paper in the Vatican archives that appears from internal evidence to have been written in 1560 with a view to making changes in the English hierarchy and filling vacant sees, on the basis that (as far as the Holy See was concerned) the remaining Catholic bishops were still in legal possession of their sees. The document suggests that the archbishop of York, Nicholas Heath, should be translated to Canterbury, and that Watson (who, it was noted, was at the time in prison) should become archbishop of York. This document, which reflects the ultimately unfounded hopes felt in some quarters in Rome and elsewhere at the time that Elizabeth might eventually settle on a restoration of Catholicism, also gives an indication of the esteem felt in the upper echelons of the church in Rome for the bishop of Lincoln. 
Watson appears to have remained in the custody of Cox until January 1565, when he was once again sent to the Tower. After the publication in 1570 of the papal bull excommunicating Elizabeth, Watson and other leading Catholic prisoners were examined. His answers appear to have been moderate, showing due allegiance to the sovereign. None the less, he is noted as being in the Tower in March 1571; there he remained until 5 July 1574, when he was released by the privy council into the custody of his brother John. His health at this time was very poor, and he seems to have been half blind and disabled. A condition of his release was that he should place sureties with the archbishop of Canterbury that he would not act contrary to the laws of the established religion, nor seek to induce others to any such contrary act or opinion. He was not to leave his brother's house without licence of the council, and was to see only those visitors who had legitimate business with his brother. It appears that he failed to meet these conditions of his bail. On 24 June 1577 the council complained to the bishop of London that Watson, John Feckenham, the former abbot of Westminster, and others, had abused their bail and consorted with 'certen of her Majesties evill disposed subjectes... whom they have perverted in Religion' ('APC', '1558-70', 371). Evidence corroborating Watson's part in such illegal activity is found in documents relating to the imprisonment in 1577 of Francis Tregian and his indictment for recusancy. Among the papers is a letter from William Wigges to Cuthbert Mayne, stating that he had sent to Mayne 'all his stuff' (his portable mass set and vestments) which had been hallowed by the bishop of Lincoln (Watson), indicating that he continued to exercise episcopal functions even after his deprivation and confinement (Morris, 85). 
The council responded to such activity by requiring new bonds of their keepers that they would not allow their charges to have any further contact with anyone on matters of religion. In Watson's case the council found this to be insufficient and on 28 July 1577 committed him to the custody of Robert Horne, bishop of Winchester. A letter of the council to Horne dated 11 August permitted Watson to have the use of one of his own servants; while reluctant to allow him to be served by one of his own religion, the council considered this less dangerous than providing him with a 'sound person' whom he might corrupt. By the beginning of 1578 Horne was in poor health, and requested that he be allowed to be discharged of Watson's custody so that he might go to London to recover his health; the council replied on 16 January that he should come to London and bring his prisoner with him, as Watson too was in poor health and wished to go to London. Shortly afterwards, however, Horne was granted his request and on 19 February his charge was transferred to John Young, the newly appointed bishop of Rochester. Young was to attempt to bring Watson to conform, and to ensure that he was unable to corrupt anyone further in matters of religion. 
The attempts of the council to prevent Watson, Feckenham, and others from influencing others in matters of religion was proving difficult to enforce. The beginning of the Jesuit mission to England, as well as the continuing influx of secular priests, was further complicating the situation. In 1580 a solution was offered by Richard Cox, namely that the recalcitrant clergy should be sent to a former palace of the bishops of Ely, which was suitable for use as a prison. Wisbech Castle had been rebuilt in brick between 1478 and 1483 by John Morton, then bishop of Ely, to be an episcopal residence. It stood on a high terrace surrounded by a moat. Possibly because of its location in the fens of East Anglia, later bishops allowed it to fall into disrepair, and by 1580 it was in a ruinous and dilapidated condition, as well as in what the Jesuit Robert Persons described as 'a most unhealthy spot' (Hicks, 79). Preparations were soon under way, undertaken on behalf of the bishop of Ely by two engineers and merchant adventurers, George Carleton and Humfrey Michell, who had been undertaking the draining of the fens. The two men notified the council of the completion of their preparations, and of the arrival of Feckenham and Watson, in a letter of 11 August. By October six more prisoners had joined them, and Carleton and Michell were seeking advice from the council as to whether the prisoners were to be allowed their own servants, and to take meals in common as had become their practice, despite the council's original insistence that Feckenham, at least, should be kept in solitary confinement. It seems that the prisoners were allowed no books other than a 'Bible', and were not permitted any writing instruments. The bishop of Ely had appointed a preacher to them, but they refused to listen to him or to attend Anglican services. Watson died in prison in Wisbech Castle in September 1584. He was buried in the church of St Peter and St Paul, just outside the castle, on 27 September.

Watson, Thomas (1555/6-1592), poet and translator, has been identified as the boy who entered Winchester College in 1567, aged eleven (Eccles, 'Brief Lives', 130). This Thomas Watson was born in the city of London parish of St Helen, Bishopsgate, according to the school admissions register. It is not known who his parents were; several Watson families lived in London at the time. 
After acquiring a reliable facility in classical languages and literature, Watson seems to have attended Oxford University briefly (without obtaining a degree) in the early 1570s. His friends at Oxford included the poets John Lyly and George Peele, the antiquarian William Camden, William Beale, a preacher of Westminster, and others who were about the university at that time. Wood says that he neglected his proper studies for 'poetry and romance' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 3rd edn, 3.601), a habit continued during the next seven years while travelling in France and Italy; there, Watson says, although he was supposed to be studying law, he visited the camps of Apollo and the Muses whenever he could. He absorbed the culture and language of both countries thoroughly, making contact with poets, and writing and translating poetry; but neither this nor the French religious wars in which he was sometimes caught up prevented him achieving proficiency in civil and canon law, as he was pleased to advertise. Opportunities for travel were no doubt helped by his acquaintance with Sir Francis Walsingham, from whose Paris embassy he would have embarked on his long tour, and from where he seems finally to have left for England in August 1581, carrying official letters from the secretary to William Cecil. Four entries in the diary of the English College at Douai, and witness statements made in 1587 (Eccles, 'Christopher Marlowe in London', 128-44, 151) may possibly indicate earlier journeys home. After Walsingham's death he expressed his gratitude to him for offering comfort in some unspecified sadness which affected him at this time. 
Although still in his early twenties, Watson had translated Petrarch's 'Canzoniere' into Latin and written two Latin poems (all these only surviving as excerpts in other of his works), and fashioned what was probably the first Latin translation available to the Tudor reader of Sophocles's 'Antigone', printed in London in the summer of 1581 by John Wolfe, who became his regular printer. The dedication (to Philip Howard, first earl of Arundel) provides information on Watson's travels, and the preparatory material includes support in verse from his Oxford friends, and encouragement from the German jurist Stefan Broellmann. The work itself establishes what became Watson's lifelong intention -- to inform and instruct as well as enlighten. A prologue presents the moral arguments, and added after Sophocles's text are original dramatic sections called 'pompae' and 'themata' which examine the issues further. This is an edition appropriate for acting in the university or the inns of court, and Camden's line 'tu pompis Latiis nostra theatra quatis' ('your Latin pomps make our audience tremble') suggests a previous staging. The work was much approved by Gabriel Harvey. 
Back in London in 1581 Watson took up lodgings again in St Helen's. At this time English lyric poetry writing was quite impoverished, a fact emphasized by several later writers, and strong puritan factions attacked the activity; little was being published except anthologies. The two poets who had made genuine attempts to incorporate in their verse the lessons of the long traditions of Italian and French literature, Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, were dead long since, and the only significant lyric poet of recent times, George Gascoigne, was of a decidedly English inspiration. 
Watson, however, was keen to present the fruits of his foreign experiences in concentrated form, and to the general reader (rather than to a limited group of elite admirers). As a Latinist marching into the field of English lyric verse he was being bold and showed some apprehension, but he received much encouragement, this time from a literary coterie based around John Lyly in Holborne. 'The 'Hekatompathia', or, Passionate Century of Love' was printed in the spring of 1582, and in dedicating it to Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford, who had already seen a manuscript (BL, Harley MS 3277), the author modestly apologizes for his temerity in offering English verse, for the 'trifling' nature of its subject, and for his own lack of skill. It became his best-known and most quoted English work and Watson was hailed as a Petrarch who had brought the Muses to live in England, enriching his native tongue (as Harvey noted) and giving intellectual respectability to love poetry. Each 'sonnet' (of eighteen lines) is provided with a heading which explains the nature of the poem, points out rhetorical devices, narrates mythological references (mainly from Homer, Ovid, and Propertius), and acknowledges, or quotes, literary sources (altogether some thirty-two classical authors and twenty-five from Renaissance Italy and France). Each poem confronts an aspect of a lover's suffering, and although Watson says it is merely imagined on his part, he shows considerable insight and humour, and some depth, and deals efficiently with metrical and structural aspects. In the opening protrepticon he imagines the volume's reception at the court, and several of the poems appear to be addressed to Elizabeth herself. The later poems examine feelings once 'love is past'. 
Watson thought of himself primarily as a Latin writer, and his next three works were in this language. The first, a prose treatise, called in manuscript 'Artificiosae memoriae libellus' (1583; BL, Sloane MS 3731) and in print 'Compendium memoriae localis' (1585), is a simple exposition of the theory and practice of the classical art of memory training. Interest in the subject was current due to the presence in London of Giordano Bruno, a champion of the magical element in memory systems, and a contender in the controversy raging in the universities over the replacement of Aristotelian methods with those of the French philosopher Pierre Ramus (died 1572). Watson intended his manuscript for Albert Lasko, a visiting prince of Poland and another hermeticist, who was specially invited to the reader's banquet in the Middle Temple hall, but it seems that he did not turn up for the event. So two years later the published 'Compendium' was dedicated to Henry Noel, one of Elizabeth's gentleman pensioners and a close friend. 
Watson's next work (and eventually his most famous) was a set of eleven Latin verse lamentations called 'Amyntas' (1585), dedicated again to Noel, in which an Arcadian shepherd mourns the death of his companion, Phillis, on the banks of the Thames. There is much rustic sentiment and earthy nostalgia, but the laments become more intense as the eleven days progress, the final day culminating in the shepherd's suicide, the only way in which he can rejoin his lover. His corpse is metamorphosed into an amaranthus plant, and Amor (Cupid) gives it the property of staunching bleeding, an ironic twist since it was Cupid's arrow which first injured his heart. But fame did not come for this work until Abraham Fraunce's unacknowledged translation of it into 'high-witted' English hexameters (1587), made for his patron, Mary Herbert, countess of Pembroke, as an offering of consolation on the death of her brother (Sir Philip Sidney). Later Fraunce published a different edition in which the translation (now acknowledged) was joined on to another, Tasso's 'Aminta', his 'Sylvia' changing her name to Watson's 'Phillis' to preserve continuity. 
Last in this group is a translation (1586) of the fifth century Greek poem of Paris and Helen by Colluthus, which Watson made for Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland. That he may have been an intimate of the earl's group is suggested by the fact that he also dedicated to him a treatise on the collection and preservation of fresh water for domestic purposes (formerly a Petworth MS, now Harvard, Houghton English 707), translated from the French of Bernard Palissy, the Huguenot potter. Much work was being done on the gardens of Petworth House at this time. 
About 1587 Watson moved lodgings to Norton Folegate, in which year he is described as 'a man very well learned' being 'late of St Helen's' (BL, Lansdowne MS 53/79, 162-3). The thrust of new theatrical activity was happening in these 'liberties' outside Bishopsgate, and among the playwrights were Watson's friends Lyly and Peele, as well as the youngsters Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, and Robert Greene. Watson addressed a commendatory hexasticon to Greene in 1589, and in September of that year he intervened in a brawl in Hog Lane (now Curtain Road), Finsbury, between Marlowe and William Bradley, who was attacking Marlowe with sword and dagger, apparently over a money problem. Earlier Bradley had petitioned for an injunction against Watson and John Alleyn, an actor, to keep the peace. Watson suffered serious injury to his thigh before killing Bradley in self-defence; the trial gave a verdict of manslaughter and Watson was kept in Newgate prison until pardon the following February. Although no plays by Watson are extant, his employer William Cornwallis wrote later that devising 'twenty fictions and knaveryes in a play' was his 'daily practyse and his living' (Hall, 256), and in 'A Knight's Conjuring' (1607) Thomas Dekker imagines the actor John Bentley in heaven near Watson and Kyd, because 'he had bene a Player molded out of their pennes'. There is also textual evidence to suggest that Watson may have written some speeches for the entertainment given to Elizabeth by Sir Edward Seymour in 1591. 
Before his imprisonment Watson made the acquaintance of both William Byrd, the composer, and Thomas Este, his music printer, in 1589 writing a lyric for a vocal piece by Byrd, published on broadsides. This extolled the virtues of the Oxford divine John Case, who had recently been railing in print against the ill effects of the puritan ethic on music, church music particularly; Byrd had often suffered from such restricting invasions. Watson's introduction to Este had far-reaching consequences, for following on from the success of Este's production in 1588 of an anthology of (mostly) Italian madrigals with lyrics translated into English, the idea was conceived of Watson writing English lyrics to some newer Italian madrigals, so as to demonstrate more effectively that the madrigal form relied on the very instant interdependence of words and music. Watson had shown his sensitivity to music in earlier poems, and he perceived (with his eye set again on instruction) that as yet neither England's composers nor her poets had applied themselves to understanding the Italian method completely. 
The result was 'The first sett of Italian madrigalls Englished, not to the sense of the originall dittie, but after the affection of the noate' (1590), in which was printed the music of twenty-six madrigals in four, five, and six parts, mostly by Luca Marenzio, whose music was already a favourite with English singing-groups through illegally imported foreign prints and home-made copies (often without words), and the earlier anthology. Watson's lyrics show hardly any translations, the new content being determined by the flow of the melodies and harmonies, and by the overall spirit of the original. Byrd himself illustrated the method with two examples of his own. 
The way in which the book for the 'medius' part is collated suggests that at first there were to be only twenty-four madrigals, all in five parts, but that the death of Watson's mentor Sir Francis Walsingham in April 1590 necessitated a rearrangement to include several lyrics praising his life and regretting his death, set to the greater sonority of six vocal parts; included in these is also an account of his imagined astral meeting with his son-in-law, Sidney. This anthology and its predecessor soon involved native composers in active participation in madrigal writing, the first of the eventual large school being Thomas Morley in 1593. 
Watson further marked the secretary of state's death with a pastoral eclogue in Latin, dedicated to Thomas Walsingham, Sir Francis's first cousin, of Scadbury Manor in Kent, whom (as he notes in the poem) Watson had known since their youthful days together in the Paris embassy ('Meliboeus Thomae Watsoni', 1590). An English version soon followed ('An Eglogue upon the Death of... Sir Francis Walsingham', 1590), dedicated to Lady Frances Sidney, the secretary of state's daughter, which Watson translated himself in order to avoid what happened to his earlier epic. The poem is in the form of a conversation (Latin, 445 lines; English, 426) between the poet and Thomas Walsingham in which they rehearse the virtues and achievements of Sir Francis (called Meliboeus, the title of the Latin version), invoke angry responses from the universe around (which here is still Ptolemy's), pity his abandoned country, and console the family. Watson seems to present himself as a sort of national laureate in this, for Elizabeth's sadness is also imagined, and her favourite poet, Spenser, is invoked to remind her of all those devoted state servants who are still in office. 
From time to time Watson may have been used by Sir Francis Walsingham as a political agent; perhaps even his position with William Cornwallis, as tutor to the son, was organized so that he could be Walsingham's ears during the official inquiries into the recusancy of the father, Sir Thomas Cornwallis of Brome in Suffolk, who was under surveillance from 1587. It was about this time that Watson took up his duties at Fisher's Folly opposite St Botolph without Bishopsgate, which the Cornwallises had just taken over from the earl of Oxford; John, aged fifteen, was soon to enter the then openly Catholic Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. 
One of Watson's colleagues in the household was Thomas Swift, a Norwich-born musician, sheltered in the family since boyhood. Watson had married his older sister, Anne ('b'. 1564), at St Antholin, Budge Row, London, on 6 September 1585. About 1589 Swift conceived the notion that William Cornwallis had been 'miserable towards him', and, 'by the advice of the said Watson, whom he... confessed the plot-layer of this matter' (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 97, fol. 29), he began a blackmail worthy of presentation at a nearby playhouse. The scheme was to lend ten gold angels to Cornwallis's fourteen-year-old daughter, Frances (not an unusual event, for Swift was 'in love' with her, and it was a miser's house), in return for her signature to a document which promised repayment with interest on her wedding day. The signing was hurriedly effected before morning lessons in front of witnesses, but the document (drawn up by Swift's brother, the attorney Hugh Swift) actually concealed a contract to marry the musician. Watson doubtless thought that he would never dare use it, and attempted later to get it away from him; but use it he did on Frances's betrothal, setting a blackmail price. Cornwallis's fury at this calumny and his daughter's besmirchment knew no bounds, and as a relative of Burghley through his wife, he managed to get a hearing in the Star Chamber in 1593, at which (the late) Watson's involvement was exposed by John, Frances's honour restored, and Swift very severely punished. 
Watson wrote two other significant works, both published posthumously. In the ambitious (and speedily written) 2000-line Latin pastoral 'Amintae gaudia' (which Marlowe saw through the press in November 1592) he narrates the earlier relationship of his lovers, Phillis now alive and so virtuously addressed that it seems almost that she is the dedicatee, Mary Herbert. The epistolary form is derived from Propertius, there are several well-crafted erotic incidents of an Ovidian nature, and a long epyllion narrates the installation by the immortal gods of Sidney on his star. Also included is a description, based on Virgil, of the defeat of the Armada, and several episodes of an apparently autobiographical nature. 
The second work, a sixty-sonnet sequence printed in 1593, was no doubt intended by its publisher to take advantage of the current fashion of sonnet sequences, many of which, though stimulated by the publication of 'Astrophil and Stella' (1591), reflected Watson's direct style more than Sidney's subtleties. The author of 'The Tears of Fancie' is shown only by the initials T. W., but Watson is a strong candidate, for the poems exhibit characteristics of his style (but less Petrarchan) and cover similar amatory concerns, and there is a final line to sonnet 59 which balances the final couplet of 'Hekatompathia'; sonnet 60 has been shown to be by the earl of Oxford. The sonnets are frequently based on Gascoigne and seem to be tentative experiments in the English quatorzain form (14 lines, resembling a sonnet), perhaps not for publication; only one badly printed and mutilated copy is extant (Hunt. 32085). 
Throughout his poetry Watson creates a sort of imaginary universe, and many repeated references to subjects, characters, and events, fictional and autobiographical and national, lead to an appreciation of his sense of the unity of things, and a clearer understanding of his pioneering efforts in improving the language, and of his intellectual control of form and content, tempered often by a humorous detachment, even self-parody. 'One can only wonder what he would have achieved, had his life not been cut short at a relatively young age' ('Complete Works', 2.192). 
Watson's burial, during the plague year of 1592, is registered at St Bartholomew-the-Less inside the purlieus of the hospital, under 26 September, ten days before that of Hugh Swift in the same place. Through references to him by many authors (usually by the name Amyntas or to the amaranthus plant), through the praises of critics, and through reprintings of his poems in anthologies (some of which, however, are mere bogus copies of his style), his considerable reputation remained for a decade after his death.

Watson, Thomas (d. 1686), ejected minister, was recorded as 'of Yorkshire' when he matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1635; no more can be said of his background and early years. At Cambridge he was noted for being a 'hard student' ('Nonconformist's Memorial', 1.188). He graduated BA in 1639 and MA in 1642, acting after this as a chaplain to the puritan Lady Vere. In 1646 he was at the City church of St Stephen Walbrook, probably as a lecturer. In 1649 he signed the 'Vindication', disclaiming implication in the king's execution. In 1651 he was involved with several others in Love's plot to recall Charles II; he was imprisoned but returned to St Stephen's in 1652. Watson married Abigail Beadle ('b'. 1627), daughter of the Essex puritan minister John Beadle. Between 1648 and 1660 the baptisms of five sons and two daughters are recorded at St Stephen's, to be followed by the melancholy toll of four burials. After his ejection a further daughter was buried at St Stephen's in 1672 (and also a son at Enfield), and at St Stephen's, it seems, his wife was buried in 1692. 
At the beginning of Watson's time at St Stephen's, Ralph Robinson was the rector, and represented the classis in the London provincial assembly in 1652 and 1653, becoming moderator in November 1654. Watson was meanwhile an assessor of the provincial assembly and scribe of the third classis. On 3 November 1656, however, Watson was returned to the provincial assembly representing the third London classis. He attended sporadically and on 1 August 1660 was present at the penultimate meeting. The likelihood, therefore, is that Watson became rector of St Stephen Walbrook in the place of Robinson in 1655 or 1656. In 1662 he was ejected from the rectory of St Stephen. In 1665 he was reported by an informer as holding a conventicle at his house in the Minories. Nevertheless, he continued his ministry in London at various conventicles, including a well-equipped meeting-house in Bishopsgate. In 1671 and 1677 Mary, countess of Warwick, heard him preach in Essex. Under the declaration of indulgence he was licensed to preach at his house in Dowgate; his congregation later moved to Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate. In November 1681 Watson was one of several London ministers prosecuted and fined for holding conventicles, and he was presented again in April 1683. Another aspect of his ministry was that he kept a school at Bethnal Green, whose students wrote to Baxter of their reverence for him. 
Watson died in 1686 and was buried on 28 July at Barnston, Essex, in the same grave as his father-in-law, John Beadle, the ejected minister there. According to Henry Newcome he 'died poor' ('Autobiography', 2.276). This is borne out by the fact that in 1684 Baxter paid him $2 out of the $50 fund he had been given by the earl of Bedford to distribute to poor ministers (Keeble and Nuttall, letter 1128). 
Watson was a prolific writer whose work went into many editions in his own century and later. His early literary output was exhortatory and devotional rather than didactic; even when the occasion arose for a topical sermon, as at the Restoration, he rejected it. His 'Discourses' was addressed to the godly and does not, for the most part, concern itself with doubts or threats. It is primarily meditational, at times even mystical, and often expressed in ecstatic language. 'The Christian's Charter' (1652) is a paean on the privileges and delights of the Christian; 'inter alia' it describes the Christian's resurrection body as 'enamelled with glory' (Watson, 'Discourses', 1.79). This leads logically to 'A Christian on the Mount, or, A Treatise on Meditation' described as 'the chamber of delight... the soul's retiring on itself... the wing of the soul' (ibid., 1.199). 'Christ's Loveliness' of 1657 was Watson's own meditation on the 'Canticles': 'the whole book is bespangled with the praises of Christ' (ibid., 1.295). The same year saw a long treatise, 'The Character of a Godly Man', which included sections on 'helps to perseverance', and 'an answer to those that doubt their salvation'. Lastly, the longest discourse was on Christ's sermon on the mount, seen as an exemplar of the minister's preaching: 'when ministers are upon the mount, let them not be on the rocks' (ibid., 2.35). 
Watson's 'magnum opus' was published posthumously in 1692. This was 'A Body of Practical Divinity', sermons on the shorter catechism of the Westminster assembly, a massive work of some 880 quarto pages. Unlike many puritan writings which started as a sermon and expanded into a book, these bear the marks of being sermons. They are short, oratorical in style, and exhibit a happy turn of phrase. Each starts with a tabulated exposition, amply supported from scripture, of the passage from the catechism, followed by a number of 'uses' -- the application of the doctrine. These are interspersed with 'objections' to clarify difficult points or move the argument forward. There are recurring passages which show Watson's priorities and the typical emphases and problems of Calvinist belief. There is a forthright statement of God's election to salvation: 'they were not elected because they believed, but believed because they were elected... The book of God's decree hath no errata in it, no blottings out, once justified never unjustified' (Watson, 'Body of Practical Divinity', 42). This position is often repeated, but equally often Watson addresses the problem of assurance and answers the questions of those who doubt their salvation: 'I fear the kingdom of grace is not yet come into my heart... I fear the plough of the law hath not yet gone deep enough, therefore I have not grace'. Watson's recurring counter to these doubts is that 'a weak faith is not to be despised'; a weak faith is still true faith and may be growing. He is wont to offer advice strange in the context of election: 'let us above all things labour for forgiveness of sins'; 'let them labour to find grace... take pains for it' (ibid., 128, 152, 387). In practice this meant the formula of frequent prayer, meditation, and reading of scripture, coupled with attendance at the 'ordinances' of the church. Here one can see the pastor in Watson seeking to square the circle of a fixed belief in double predestination and the doubts and troubles of his flock. A recurring concern is the sufferings of the elect. These are to 'expectorate and purge our sins' (ibid., 445ff.); as such they are 'love tokens' (ibid., 529) from God. In general Watson has an apocalyptic view of his world: 'we live in the dregs of time... England has a kachexy; it is all over disease' (ibid., 371). The picture which emerges is that of a godly man, devoted to his pastoral ministry. Calamy has a story which partly encapsulates this summary: 'once on a lecture day Bishop Richardson came to hear him, who was much pleased with his sermon, but especially with the prayer after it, so that he followed him home to give him thanks, and earnestly desired a copy of it. 'Alas (said Mr Watson) that is what I cannot give, for I do not use to pen my prayers; it was no studied thing, but uttered 'pro re nata', as God enabled me, from the abundance of my heart and affections'. Upon which the good bishop went away wondering that any man could pray in that manner extempore. ('Nonconformist's Memorial', 1.189)'

Watson, Thomas (1637-1717), bishop of St David's, was born on 1 March 1637 at North Ferriby, near Hull, the son of John Watson, a seaman. He was educated at Hull grammar school and entered St John's College, Cambridge, on 25 May 1655, graduating BA in 1659 and proceeding MA in 1662. He was ordained a deacon and priest in the diocese of Ely on 22 December 1667 and proceeded BD and became a fellow of St John's in 1669. He was presented to the rectory of Burrough Green, Cambridgeshire, in 1672 and made a DD in 1675. In 1678-9 he supported the tory candidates at the county election in Cambridgeshire. 
Watson continued to hold Burrough Green 'in commendam' with the bishopric of St David's, to which he was consecrated on 26 June 1687, apparently upon the recommendation of Henry Jermyn, Lord Dover, a Roman Catholic with Cambridgeshire connections. Watson was a committed supporter of James II and in November 1687 he was expected to support repeal of the 'Test Acts' should James II call a new parliament. Unlike the seven bishops he was an advocate of the Anglican clergy reading the second declaration of indulgence from their pulpits, and made efforts to ensure that they complied in his diocese. In December 1688 such was his unpopularity that 'the rabble in Cambridge' attacked St John's and imprisoned Watson 'with a halter around his neck' ('Le Fleming MSS', 230), but he was rescued by the college fellows. This may account for his absence from London during the revolution. He attended the Convention and opposed the motion declaring that James II had abdicated, and supported the proposal for a regency in January and February 1689. After initially refusing to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to William and Mary he took them on 31 March 1690. However, he was still omitted from the 'Act of Grace', which pardoned all but a handful for their actions committed in the previous reigns, in May. Watson's survival as bishop is to be explained by the king's desire not to drive even more of the episcopal bench into nonjuring. Thereafter Watson opposed the government of the day, most notably in supporting the place bill in January 1693, refusing the oath of Association in February 1696 (which in threatening action against his enemies in the wake of the assassination plot declared William king 'de jure' as well as 'de facto') and opposing the bill of attainder against the Jacobite Sir John Fenwick in November 1696. 
Watson seems to have been in conflict with some of his clergy from the very onset of his episcopate. He blamed the tenure of Bishop Robert Lucy for much bad practice among the clergy, and in his visitation of 1691 set about remedying their faults. He may have targeted whig clergy, and certainly was at odds with his chancellor, Robert Lucy, the son of Bishop Lucy. However, his clergy fought back, accusing Watson of simony and extortion, and one Jeremiah Griffith brought a case to the assizes at Brecon in 1693 which found the bishop guilty of taking excessive fees. In 1694 Watson announced that his chancellor, residentiary canons, and beneficed clergy should be resident, a further salvo in his battle with his whig clergy. Lucy responded with a petition to Archbishop Tillotson to inquire into the charges against the bishop. Thus, on 24 July 1694 commissioners were appointed to visit the diocese and on 21 August Watson was suspended. 
The death of Archbishop Tillotson saw Watson petition his successor, Thomas Tenison, for the suspension to be lifted, which it duly was in February 1695. However, Watson continued to pursue Lucy, who responded by issuing a series of charges against Watson. These included simony, the taking of excessive fees at ordinations, institutions, and visitations, and of conferring orders without administering the oaths, yet certifying that he had done so. Watson was called before Archbishop Tenison on 24 October but after the charges were read he claimed parliamentary privilege. Lucy petitioned the House of Lords on 7 March 1696, praying that the case be allowed to go forward, and Watson waived his privilege on 20 March after the petition was dropped. Various hearings were held during 1696-9, and on 3 August 1699 judgment was given by Tenison, assisted by five bishops, and Watson was found guilty and sentenced to deprivation, although Thomas Sprat, bishop of Rochester, dissented from the sentence and did not attend the final hearing. Watson appealed against the sentence to the court of delegates, arguing that the archbishop did not have that power, and then resumed his privilege, taking his seat again in the Lords on 18 November 1699. However, after hearing counsel the Lords decided on 6 December that Watson should not be allowed to resume his privilege. He last sat in the Lords on 22 December 1699. An attempt to use the court of king's bench to force the court of delegates to admit more evidence also failed, and on 22 February 1700 the delegates confirmed the sentence of deprivation. On 3 March 1700 Watson failed in an attempt to get the king's bench to reverse its earlier decision. Problems then arose on how to eject Watson from the temporalities of his see, and on 8 March the Lords petitioned the crown not to fill the vacancy 'for some convenient time'. 
Watson refused to accept the sentence as confirmed by the delegates and refused to pay the costs of the suit, now over $600. For the second offence he was excommunicated, and in June 1702 he was imprisoned in Newgate for not paying his fees, remaining in custody until October. On 9 October he petitioned the queen for 'a commission of review' (Carpenter, 226) nominated by the crown. In reply the crown merely claimed the bishop's lands as he was suspended, but Watson continued to maintain that he was still bishop. The crown proceeded against Watson in the court of exchequer on 15 June 1703, and having lost his case Watson appealed to the exchequer chamber, which ruled against him on 24 November 1704. Finally Watson brought a writ of error before the Lords, but lost by forty-nine votes to twenty. George Bull was consecrated as Watson's successor on 5 March 1705. 
Henceforth Watson retired to Great Wilbraham in Cambridgeshire, where he died 'very rich' ('Remarks', 6.65) on 3 June 1717. As an excommunicant he was buried privately the following evening at Great Wilbraham. Although at least one document appears to refer to his wife, Joanna, that was also the name of the wife of his brother, William, who proved his will.

Watson, Thomas (d. 1744), naval officer, may have served as a midshipman with Edward Vernon, though it is also possible that he entered the navy from the merchant service. In any event he became first lieutenant of the 'Antelope' in 1733, and rose to become her captain on 7 October 1737. 
On 10 July 1739 Watson was appointed to the 'Burford' as Vernon's flag-captain, and he acted in that capacity at the reduction of Porto Bello. He moved with Vernon to the 'Princess Caroline' in January 1741, was flag-captain during the abortive attack on Cartagena, and in June 1741 moved again with Vernon to the 'Boyne', in which he returned to England in December 1742. In September 1743 he was appointed to the 'Northumberland' (70 guns), which in the following spring was one of the fleet sent to Lisbon under the command of Sir Charles Hardy the elder. On the homeward voyage at daybreak on 8 May the 'Northumberland', looking out ahead, was ordered by signal to chase a strange sail seen to the northward. She did not come up with it, and did not obey her recall, which was made about two o'clock. The weather deteriorated and she lost sight of the fleet, then of the chase; but about four o'clock she sighted three ships to the leeward, the wind being westerly. The 'Northumberland' ran down towards these strangers. They lay-to to wait for her; it was seen that they were French, two of 64 guns and the third a frigate of 26 guns. One of the 64-gun ships, the 'Content', was about a mile to windward of her consort, the 'Mars'. Had Watson engaged her, he might possibly have disabled her before the 'Mars' could come to her support. It was probably Watson's best option, if he refused to accept the advice offered by the master and endeavour to lead the Frenchmen back to Hardy's fleet. 
But Watson was in no mood to follow advice which smacked of caution. It was said that his skull had been fractured in a fall, 'and a small matter of liquor rendered him quite out of order -- which was his unhappy fate that day' ('A True and Authentick Narrative of the Action between the Northumberland and Three French Men of War', 7). According to the anonymous author of the account, 'We bore down on them so precipitately that our small sails were not stowed nor top-gallant sails furled before the enemy began to fire on us, and at the same time had the cabins to clear away; the hammocks were not stowed as they should be; in short, we had nothing in order as we should before action. (ibid., 3)' About five o'clock the 'Northumberland' closed with the 'Content' and received her fire, but, without replying to it, ran down to the 'Mars'. The 'Content' followed, as did the frigate. The 'Northumberland' was a target for the three of them. The men at the wheel were killed, and nobody thought of sending others to take their place. Watson was wounded, and before the first lieutenant could get on deck, the master struck the colours, and the ship was captured. Watson died in France on 4 June 1744. By his will, dated 8 May 1744 -- the day of the 'Northumberland''s fateful battle -- Watson left all his possessions to his uncle Captain John Roberts, of Reading, who himself died early in the following year. The master, tried by court martial on 1 February 1745, was sentenced to imprisonment in the Marshalsea for life; he was spared capital punishment on the ground that he had given good advice to his captain before the action.

Watson, Thomas (1750-1781), engraver, was born in London, the son of Thomas Watson (died 1791), printseller, and his wife, Esther. Nothing is known of his training but he rapidly matured as a fine engraver in mezzotint and in stipple. He exhibited with the Society of Artists between 1773 and 1776, showing a series of fine mezzotints. Most of his early prints were published by himself (or more probably by his father) from Broad Street, London, in alliance with the book and printsellers Samuel Hooper and Walter Shropshire. He took Francis Haward apprentice in 1774 for a $75 premium. He engraved portraits and fancy subjects with equal dexterity and interpreted a number of artists, notably Sir Joshua Reynolds and Daniel Gardner. In January 1779 Watson and Shropshire published a fine set of six 'Windsor Beauties', portraits of ladies of the court of Charles II after paintings by Sir Peter Lely now at Hampton Court. About that time Watson went into partnership with William Dickinson, a fellow engraver in stipple and mezzotint and another favourite engraver of Reynolds. Thomas Watson senior and Dickinson insured the contents of a brick dwelling at 158 New Bond Street on 2 February 1779, with over $2000 cover allowed for the joint stock of prints. From then until 1781 Watson junior engraved or supervised the making of some twenty-eight plates that went under his own name and contributed to the establishment of a thriving business. Early in the summer of 1781 Thomas Watson junior died suddenly at Westminster, and he was buried probably at St George's, Hanover Square. The insurance policies show that his father moved from Bond Street to Carnaby Street in 1781 and the next year to 33 Strand. He continued to sell his son's prints and, apparently, to support Dickinson, who managed the Bond Street business until the elder Watson's death in 1791. A sale of 'Mr Watson's plates and prints' took place in January 1792.

Watson, Sir Thomas, first baronet (1792-1882), physician, eldest son of Joseph Watson (died 1813) of Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Catton, was born at Montrath House, Broadhembury, Cullompton, Devon, on 7 March 1792. He was educated at the grammar school, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where Charles James Blomfield, afterwards bishop of London, was his contemporary; they continued friends throughout life. Watson entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1811, and graduated BA as tenth wrangler in 1815. He was elected a fellow in 1816, retiring in 1826, and in 1818 graduated MA. He studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital under John Abernethy in 1819. After spending the session of 1820-21 at Edinburgh, he returned to Cambridge, obtained the university licence in medicine in 1822, was junior proctor in 1823-4, and graduated MD in 1825. 
On 15 September 1825 he married Sarah (died 1830), daughter of Edward Jones of Brackley, Northamptonshire, and took a house in Henrietta Street, London, establishing a practice in a nearby house. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1826, and in May 1827 physician to the Middlesex Hospital, which was then connected with London University. He was professor of clinical medicine, and lectured from 1828 to 1831. In 1831 he became lecturer on forensic medicine at King's College, London, and in 1835 professor of forensic medicine, an office which he held until 1840. He continued to be physician to the Middlesex Hospital until 1843. In that year he published his famous 'Lectures on the Principles and Practice of Physic' (2 vols.), which had first been printed week by week in the 'Medical Times and Gazette' between 1840 and 1842. It was for thirty years the chief English textbook of medicine; based upon sound clinical observations, it gave a complete view of English medicine of its period, and was remarkable for its good literary style. 
At the Royal College of Physicians Watson gave the Goulstonian lectures in 1827, the Lumleian lectures on haemorrhage in 1831, and was a censor in 1828, 1837, and 1838. In 1862 he was elected president, and was re-elected for five successive years. He was elected FRS in 1859, and in 1864 was made an honorary LLD at Cambridge. In 1857 he became president of the Pathological Society, and in 1868 of the Clinical Society. Watson's practice as a physician was large, and in 1859 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to the queen, and in 1870 physician-in-ordinary. He was one of the physicians who attended Albert, prince consort, in his last illness. He was created a baronet on 27 June 1866. He retired from practice soon after 1870. At the last meeting he attended at the Royal College of Physicians in March 1882 all the fellows present rose when he entered the room, a rare mark of respect, and the highest honour which the college can bestow on one of its fellows who has ceased to hold office. 
Watson died on 11 December 1882 at Reigate Lodge, Reigate, Surrey, the house of his son, Sir Arthur Townley Watson QC (1830-1907). A daughter, Margaret Catherine Watson, also survived him. Watson died 'full of years and honours... and, withal, he was modest and unassuming, as becomes a truly great and wise man' ('The Lancet', 1040). He was buried at Reigate on 16 December.

Watson, Walter (1780-1854), poet, was born at Chryston, in the parish of Calder, Lanarkshire, on 29 March 1780, one of the three sons and four daughters of William Watson, hand-loom weaver. At the age of eight he became a herd, and attended the village school during winter. From eleven he worked as a weaver, and after a couple of years worked as a farmhand at home and as a sawyer in Glasgow. He enlisted in the Scots Greys in May 1799 but saw nothing more serious than drills and parades. He was discharged at the peace of Amiens, 1802. In March 1803 he married Margaret, daughter of Alexander Wilson of Hill Farm, near Chryston. They were to have eight sons and two daughters; however, only four children survived Watson. 
From 1803 to 1820 Watson worked as a weaver in Chryston. He began writing poetry but was reprimanded by the village teacher for his lack of grammar. In 1808 he published a small volume of his poems. This was a troubled period in the weaving industry and Watson was periodically obliged to find employment as sawyer, stonecutter, and printer as the family moved around Stirlingshire, Lanarkshire, and Dunbartonshire. Another volume of poems was published in 1823 and yet another in 1843. In 1849 he settled at Duntiblae, near Kirkintilloch, Dunbartonshire, where he worked as a weaver. His 'Poems and Songs, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect' was published in 1853. He died on 12 September 1854 at Duntiblae and was buried in Calder churchyard where a granite monument was erected in 1875.

Watson, William (1559?-1603), Roman Catholic priest and conspirator, was born, by his own calculation, on 23 April 1559. Apart from the fact that he hailed from co. Durham nothing is known of his family. According to his never entirely trustworthy autobiographical note, apparently written for Sir Edward Coke while Watson was a prisoner in the Gatehouse in April 1599, he was 'brought up in learning', and 'sent to Oxforde at 10 years of age', but his name does not appear among the surviving records. By his own account he cannot be the 'William Watson of Durham' who matriculated aged twenty-six from All Souls on 28 November 1581, and who graduated BA the following February. According to the hostile testimony of Robert Persons, Watson attended the university merely as servant to John Boste. There can be no doubt, however, that he was well read. In his own words Watson's studies up to the age of eighteen 'were in the 7 liberall sciences intermixte withe the tongues, phisicke, common lawe & especially histories all my life time for recreacon', while in the following three years he absorbed 'the lawes canon & civil withe positive divinitie & perfecting of my metaphisicke and philosophie' (Law, 1.212-13). 
Independent sources record that Watson was confirmed at Rheims on 25 March 1581, and that he received minor orders on 23 September 1583, and was ordained deacon on 22 March and priest at Laon on 5 April 1586. He was sent into England on 16 June in the same year, 'broughte of the sea in mariners apparell' (Law, 1.211-12). Like so many of his colleagues on the English mission Watson was soon arrested. He was in the Marshalsea by October 1586. By his own account he was released on the understanding that he would leave the realm, was rearrested before the time allowed him expired, and was subsequently ill treated by Richard Topcliffe in the Bridewell prison: 'all the plagues & torments of that place', he writes, were 'inflicted upon me (whereof fewe I think were lefte oute, & some I dare say unknowen to her majesty or councell that ever I suffered, as whipping, grinding in the milne, withe the like)' (ibid.; TNA: PRO, SP 12/202/61). Watson, however, managed to escape, in March 1588, thanks to the good offices of Margaret Ward, who smuggled a rope to him past lax security. Ward was put to death for this offence later in the year. 
Again relying on Watson's own account he spent the next couple of years at Liege, returning to England in the autumn of 1590. One spy report suggests that he visited Ireland with Simon Fennel in 1593. There followed further imprisonments in Bridewell and the Gatehouse, and further escapes, first on 18 May 1597, and then on 24 June 1599. It was during the latter incarceration that he wrote his autobiographical memoir. This long-winded self-justification includes an interesting summary of the contents of his library: 'lawe bookes Machiavels werkes, tragedies, cronicles, coleccions of Doleman, Philopater, Leycesters commonwealthe (all 3 one man as is said) the bishop of Londons Genevian platforme, the discovery of the originall cause & begining of our dislike of the Jesuites & their procedings: and many other notes colleccions & breifes of prophecies, genealogies, discents of hunting, hawking & the like. (Law, 1.213)' Once again Watson was arrested. He was in Wisbech Castle in 1600 and was later moved to the Clink, but upon being surprised when about to say mass for forty poor Catholics he was transferred to the much stricter confines of the King's Bench prison in April 1602. He was, though, soon released. Watson had, by then, emerged as one of the most vociferous of the so-called appellant Catholic priests, a grouping of those opposed to the introduction of an archpriest to administer the English church. While at Wisbech in November 1600 he signed the appeal made by the secular priests against Blackwell's appointment, and about this time he set out thirty reasons why he and his colleagues could not 'in conscience, policie, nor equitie admitt of Mr Blackwell archepresbiterie' (Law, 90-98). The secular priests all shared a distrust of the Jesuits, who enthusiastically supported government by archpriest; but Watson's hatred and, indeed, fear of the society, sharpened by worries that the Jesuits favoured a Habsburg over a Stuart succession after Elizabeth I's death, verged on paranoia. His single solo published contribution to the archpriest controversy, the so-called 'Quodlibets, or, Decacordon of Ten Quodlibeticall Questions Concerning Religion and State' (1602), is characterized by the extremity of its opinions and the eccentric intemperance with which these are expressed. The 'Decacordon', and other works in a similar vein, were countered by Robert Persons in his 'A Manifestation of the Great Folly', also published in 1602. Persons set on record his contempt for Watson, heaping personal abuse upon his opponent. He recalled that Watson had come to Rheims 'a poor little begging boy', had made his way through taking on menial tasks, and had entertained fellow students by tumbling and other demeaning tricks, 'for which his body was fitly made' (fols. 83-4). So the unedifying debate rumbled on. 
Elizabeth's government was prepared to be lenient towards the secular priests, realizing that in so doing they helped divide English Catholics and isolate the extremists bent on foreign intervention to reinstate the old religion. Following negotiations with Richard Bancroft, bishop of London, Watson and other seculars took an oath of allegiance in November 1602, specially fashioned to draw moderate Catholics apart from the intransigent recusant community. Those taking the oath were subsequently set at liberty. These contacts seem to have turned Watson's head, sharpening at the same time a taste for diplomacy and negotiation. Determined to forestall supposed Jesuit plots in favour of a Spanish successor to Elizabeth, he travelled to Edinburgh in the months prior to the queen's death. There, in return for pledging his loyalty to the Stuart cause, he received from James VI and his ministers vague but encouraging assurances of future toleration for Catholics in England. Such assurances were readily given -- to the earl of Northumberland and to the future gunpowder plotter Thomas Percy, among others -- but Watson, characteristically, built up this predictable molehill of platitudes into a mountain of promises guaranteeing an improvement in the lot of Catholic Englishmen. Like Thomas Percy he undoubtedly felt betrayed when no immediate toleration was forthcoming after March 1603. This consideration, combined with fears based on little evidence that the Jesuits were planning some form of coup before James's coronation, prompted Watson to participate in an enterprise which would oblige the new king to honour his supposed obligations. 
The so-called Bye plot which followed proved a ludicrous fiasco. The principal conspirators hoped to recruit a band of Catholic gentlemen who would surprise the court at Greenwich on midsummer night in 1603, kidnap the king, seize the Tower of London, and hold James there as a hostage for toleration of Catholic religion -- to be guaranteed by secure strongholds and important prisoners -- and the removal from office and incarceration of ministers identified with the old, repressive, Elizabethan ways. Officially, no blood was to have been shed, but even the optimistic Watson accepted that Robert Cecil and other leading privy councillors might be prosecuted on the highest charges. When Watson and his chief confederate, the Catholic gentleman Sir Griffin Markham, discussed these matters Sir Griffin 'answered that, for his part, he carried no bloody mind; but he feared, when it came to it, they should be constrained, for safety of their own lives, to take away some of theirs' (Tierney, 4, appx, xli). 
Markham's and Watson's colleagues -- another secular priest named William Clark, George Brooke (the discontented protestant younger brother of Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham), and the Catholic gentleman poet Anthony Copley -- eagerly discussed all the changes that they would like to see. Watson himself earmarked the office of lord chancellor, albeit ostensibly on a caretaker basis. Still more absurd, he undertook to convert James to Catholicism by working upon the king's known inclination for theological debate. Here, as elsewhere in this conspiracy, optimistic expectation far outran good sense. Copley confessed that on another occasion he, Watson, and another fellow conspirator, Nicholas Kendall, discussed the project over a meal. 'What our discourse was', he declared, 'and how vain and variable all that supper time, I blush to remember: being wholly of tumult, without head or foot' (Tierney, 4, appx, iv). The principal plotters failed entirely to secure any show of support from their supposed backers. While Watson talked airily of supporters numbered in the thousands, he and his colleagues never seem to have discussed their plans with more than fifty or so possible recruits. Brooke and Markham tried to enlist support from the protestant peer Lord Grey of Wilton -- an experienced military commander thoroughly disenchanted with the new regime and, in particular, with the favour shown his enemy the earl of Southampton. But Grey, flatly opposed to Catholic toleration, distrusted Watson and Markham just as, when the test was made, they distrusted him. Midsummer day came and went. Watson lost heart and fled into the west country. Their hopes now dashed, the plotters who remained in London busily engaged in a round of recriminations. 
Then their world began to fall apart. Copley was betrayed to Bancroft by the archpriest, George Blackwell, and by Henry Garnett, the Jesuit superior. Upon interrogation the unfortunate prisoner disclosed everything, or, at least, everything he knew. There were limits to Copley's knowledge, for he had been recruited by Watson and Markham at a fairly late stage. But it is Copley who, recalling Watson's discourses, puts the famous words into King James's mouth: 'Na Na, gud fayth, wee's not need the papists now!' (TNA: PRO, SP 14/2/51). A proclamation was issued for the arrest of the fugitive conspirators, Watson being described as 'a man of the lowest sort', about the age of thirty-six, 'his hair betwixt abram and flaxen, he looketh asquint, and is very purblind' ('Stuart Royal Proclamations', 1.43). 
Watson remained at large until early in August. According to John Aubrey he was captured 'in a field by the Hay in Herefordshire (or Brecknockshire)' by the magistrate Henry Vaughan. Aubrey, inevitably, could not resist an old tale in which the captor suffered alongside his quarry: ''Twas observed', he wrote, 'that Mr Vaughan did never prosper afterwards' ('Brief Lives', 161). Watson was imprisoned in the Tower on 10 August 1603. In a series of highly detailed confessions, readily given, he provided the council with a colourful picture of his treason, professing penitence and regret for his actions. Unfortunately he added further insinuations that the king had gone back on promises to the English Catholics. At his trial at Winchester on 15 November he pleaded not guilty and persisted in this fatal line. Equally futile was his argument that a king uncrowned did not exercise full royal authority, and that in the interim between accession and coronation men might seek redress for particular grievances. Naturally, no observer had a good word to write about his stubbornness. We are told that Watson's 'absurd' speeches, 'without grace, or utterance, or good deliverance', left spectators embarrassed and contemptuous rather than sympathetic ('State trials', 2.61-5). 
Sentenced to death, Watson and Clark were hanged, drawn, and quartered in the market place at Winchester on 29 November. Brooke was beheaded within a week, but both Copley and Markham were reprieved. Watson died well, asking forgiveness of the king, the Jesuits, and any others whom he might have offended. The executions were clumsily handled, Clark in particular being cut down from the gallows when still conscious. Robert Hobart, without advancing any evidence to support his theory, argued that the sentences were carried out on his own initiative by the lord chief justice, Sir John Popham, a fierce opponent of priests who is supposed to have feared that both men might be pardoned. It is, however, extremely unlikely that either priest would have been spared.

Watson, Sir William (1715-1787), physician and natural philosopher, was born in St John's Street, Smithfield, London, on 3 April 1715, the son of William Watson, a corn chandler. He entered the Merchant Taylors' School in 1726 and on 6 April 1731 was apprenticed to an apothecary, Thomas Richardson. A keen student of pharmacy and botany during the eight years of his apprenticeship, Watson won a prize that included a copy of John Ray's 'Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum', awarded annually by the Society of Apothecaries for identifying plants during country excursions from the Chelsea Physic Garden. During the summer of 1738 Watson married, purchased his freedom from the society ten months before completing his apprenticeship, and set up as an apothecary in Aldersgate, London. 
Watson began attending the Royal Society in March 1738, first as a guest of the Cambridge botany professor John Martyn, then under the patronage of the president, Hans Sloane. Watson was elected a fellow on 9 April 1741 and regularly joined both the society's public meetings and its private club, founded in 1743, at The Mitre in Fleet Street, and later at the Crown and Anchor in the Strand. He sat on many of the society's committees, and after 1772 served as its vice-president. He also belonged to the Monday Club, which met at the George and Vulture Coffee House, Cornhill, from at least the 1760s; and he was an ally both of the whig magnate Philip Yorke, Lord Hardwicke, for whom he acted as physician, and of John Pringle, the society's president in the 1770s. He was a sociable and energetic member of London's learned world, hard-working, an early riser, and endowed with a remarkable memory. His initial publications concerned the means and importance of correct plant identification. In December 1744 he wrote on the previously undescribed star puffball, attracting interest from European botanists. He produced several accounts of accidental poisoning by hemlock and henbane, and in 1754 argued for the polygamous character of holly. Much of his work as a naturalist involved reviews of foreign studies, such as a 1742 paper on Albrecht von Haller's list of Swiss plants and a paper of May 1752 on the hitherto neglected French report that corals were animal, not vegetable. In the spring of 1748 Per Kalm, a pupil of the great Swedish naturalist Linnaeus, stayed with Watson before a botanical survey in America. The history and the reform of English botany were among Watson's concerns. In 1749 he re-examined the ruins of the Tradescants' garden at Lambeth, and in 1752 accompanied the Swiss naturalist Abraham Trembley to investigate the vegetable origin of coal deposits in Sussex. The first English account of Linnaeus's 'Species plantarum' (1753) was a laudatory and detailed review Watson published, with Linnaeus's approval, at the end of 1754 in the 'Gentleman's Magazine'. When the British Museum was founded in 1756 Watson, named a trustee by Sloane, arranged its gardens at Montague House. Unimpressed by the staffing arrangements, Watson strongly backed the appointment of specialist naturalists to maintain the museum's natural history collections. In 1760 he made a pilgrimage to the Essex house and grave of John Ray, whom he viewed as English natural history's patriarch. Richard Pulteney, chief English campaigner for Linnaean taxonomy, and Watson's eulogist, judged Watson himself 'the living lexicon of botany' (Pulteney, 337). 
From late 1744 Watson initiated experimental work on electricity, based first on reports from the Leipzig professor Johann Winkler that warm alcohol in a spoon could be ignited by an electric spark. As yet unfamiliar with electrical lore, the apothecary Watson saw chemical significance in the effect. In March and April 1745 he reported that many volatile liquids could also be fired electrically, and distinguished between firing into an earthed spoon and what he called 'repulsive' firing when the spark was passed over the surface of an electrified one. During 1745 Watson developed his electrical expertise, showing the weakening of successive electrical shocks between insulated experimenters and the varying behaviours of glass, metal, and cork when held by an electrified man standing on an insulating wax cake. These trials, which took place with the assistance of the society's new president, Martin Folkes, were witnessed by the prince of Wales and the duke of Cumberland. On Sloane's nomination the trials won Watson the Royal Society's Copley medal in 1745 and were described in a pamphlet first published that year, 'Experiments and Observations Tending to Illustrate the Nature and Properties of Electricity', which in a new version had four reprints during 1746. 
In February 1746 Watson matched this success with experiments linking electrical effluvia with the active fire described by the Dutch medical chemist Hermann Boerhaave. Watson considered electricity a particulate, elastic, and subtle fluid which moved objects by impact and would naturally seek to restore any temporary imbalance in its distribution. It flowed in straight lines away from a rubbed tube, was refracted through conductors, but must reach a certain strength as it soaked into a conductor before then being able to penetrate glass. He showed that sparks could be drawn from a metal conductor attached to a frictional electrical machine only if the operator of the machine, or else the conductor itself, were grounded. During the rest of 1746 he established that such machines would work better if their operators were not insulated but earthed, and reckoned these devices should be understood as pumps, drawing the fluid up from the ground. Watson's theory of pumping, which he compared with the prestigious fluid theory of the French natural philosopher Jean Nollet, became significant when in early 1746 the Royal Society learned of the invention of the Leyden jar, a glass bottle which gave huge shocks if a grounded experimenter simultaneously touched its outer surface and a metal conductor linked to the inside surface of the bottle. On the suggestion of the London physician John Bevis, Watson increased the jar's effect by covering both sides of the glass with lead and making the glass thin. He designed tricks to convey the jar's shock unawares to his victims, then argued at the society in late October 1746 that his fluid theory perfectly explained its effects. The electric fire flowed out from the experimenter's body to the jar and to the conductor, and was resupplied to the experimenter from the ground. Watson's work was again released as a pamphlet before the end of the year. 
Early in 1747 Watson revised this initial electrical theory. Bevis reported that if an insulated man touched a rotating globe worked by an insulated operator, both became electrified though cut off from the ground. Watson explained the phenomenon as a redistribution of electrical fluid across zones of different fluid density, preserving aspects of his model of equilibrium and pumping. Later in 1747, in collaboration with Folkes, Bevis, James Bradley, and Charles Cavendish, Watson spent several weeks trying to measure electricity's speed by laying a wire from a Leyden jar across Westminster Bridge, then passing the fluid back through the Thames and their own bodies. Similar trials were conducted at Highbury and Shooter's Hill. They judged the fluid's speed was too fast to measure. Just as he acted as reviewer of natural history, so Watson made himself the expositor of electrical doctrines of colleagues such as the clockmaker John Ellicott and the painter Benjamin Wilson, who also designed competing theories of the electrical fluid. Charles Cavendish forwarded to Watson a letter from Benjamin Franklin, written in June 1747 in Philadelphia, which also proffered a theory of the jar's action. On 21 January 1748 Watson read to the society extracts from Franklin's letter and claimed that his own density theory and Franklin's apparently novel doctrine of electrical atmospheres and positive and negative charges were to all intents identical. Watson's role as the Royal Society's reviewer, in such fields as thermometry, industry, or chemistry, also brought him news about electricity. In 1749 he criticized claims by Venetian experimenters and Winkler that medically active fluids could allegedly be transmitted from the interior of sealed electrified glass tubes, and he revealed the recipe for various German tricks involving the electrical discharge from metal hidden beneath a performer's clothes. In 1752 he reported on trials done with Charles Cavendish of electric discharge in vacua, which he compared with the phenomena of the northern lights. Cavendish provided Watson with a remarkable mercurial tube which made a vacuum and electrical flow simultaneously. When the Quaker physician John Fothergill, a friend of Watson, arranged the publication of Franklin's letters on electricity in 1751, Watson reviewed them for the Royal Society rather favourably, though he denied that the electrification of the jar took place entirely within the glass; in 1752 he failed to draw electricity during a thunderstorm. By the later 1750s Watson had become an ally of Franklin in natural philosophy and in politics. They both joined the reformist Society of Honest Whigs; in December 1762 Watson petitioned the first lord of the Admiralty, Lord Anson, for the installation of Franklin's designs for lightning rods at Purfleet arsenal, and published a pamphlet on the rods in 1764. In 1772 Watson joined Franklin on a Royal Society committee which decisively recommended such a strategy for the defence of Purfleet. 
Watson's pharmaceutical skills and interest in aerial activity helped to prompt his subsequent medical work. As early as 1742 he published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' on ways of extracting foul air from ships, and from the 1750s set out to establish himself in medical practice. He wrote on public welfare, including advice in 1757 on preventing the freezing of lead water pipes by means of pairs of taps rather than by covering the pipes with horse manure. On 6 September 1757 Watson was created a doctor of physic at Halle, and may also have got similar degrees from Wittenberg and Edinburgh. At the end of that year he was disfranchised from the Apothecaries' Society for a fee of $50. Watson had employed several apprentice apothecaries, including William Jordan (from 1740) and Rudolph Hobbes (from 1745): one of them, Timothy Lane, took over Watson's apothecary's business and continued his electrical studies into the 1760s. Watson was eventually admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1759. 
After moving to Lincoln's Inn Fields, Watson became physician for the Foundling Hospital, a central institution of whig philanthropy, in October 1762. He published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' on the influenza and dysentery epidemics of that year and in 1763 used his electrical expertise to describe cures of muscular rigidity in tetanus by the application of shocks. In 1768 Watson published an influential pamphlet on smallpox inoculation, arguing on the basis of his major work at the Foundling Hospital against treating children less than three years old, and recommending abstinence from meat and heating liquors. After violent attacks by licentiates on the Royal College establishment in 1767-8, Watson joined the Society of Collegiate Physicians' campaign, backed by allies such as Fothergill and William Heberden, to force the college to admit fellows from outside the English universities. Watson contributed papers on putrid measles to Fothergill's reformist 'Medical Observations', and in 1771 Heberden tried unsuccessfully to get both Fothergill and Watson elected fellows of the Royal College, a status Watson gained only on 30 September 1784. He was made censor in 1785-6 and was knighted on 6 October 1786. Many of Watson's circle, such as the Cavendish clan, Heberden, and Pringle, shared his engagement in enlightened reform and some of his sympathy for dissent. In his last years Watson rose to a central place in the genteel world of metropolitan philosophical society. He died at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 10 May 1787, leaving a son, and a daughter who was married to Edward Beadon, rector of North Stoneham, Hampshire, brother of Richard Beadon (1737-1824), bishop of Bath and Wells.

Sir William Watson (1744-1824), was, like his father, a physician and naturalist. He was born in London in early September 1744 and educated at Charterhouse before entering Queens' College, Cambridge, as pensioner on 17 February 1761, whence he migrated to Gonville and Caius College on 26 April 1762. Watson obtained his MB in 1766 and was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 10 December 1767. A resident of Bedford Square in London, he graduated MD in 1771, then practised medicine in Bath. About 1772 Watson married Christiana Freame, 'nee' Barclay ('c'.1739-1796); she was the mother of Priscilla Hannah Gurney. In 1778 he published on the blue shark in the 'Philosophical Transactions', and maintained considerable interest in botany and mineralogy. In December 1779 he joined the new Bath Philosophical Society, and was instrumental in introducing William Herschel, then a Bath musician, to the society's membership. Watson became Herschel's close friend and correspondent. They discussed problems in natural history and astronomy and collaborated on measures of the heights of the hills round Bath, the results being published in 1810 in Joseph Wilson's 'History of Mountains'. Watson supplied Herschel with a valuable nebular catalogue in late 1781, successfully lobbied for Herschel's royal pension in 1782, produced important drawings of Herschel's 7 foot telescope in 1783, and in 1784 advised on the proper depiction of Uranus on Josiah Wedgwood's portrait medallion of Herschel. In January 1785 Watson suggested to Herschel that the regular distribution of stars in space might resemble the patterns of mutually repulsive particles of powdered resin on the surface of an electrically charged wax and turpentine cake. The same year Watson published 'A Treatise on Time', a philosophical essay dedicated to Herschel and heavily indebted to Joseph Priestley, another member of the Bath Society. Watson was linked by marriage with some members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, including Samuel Galton. He was knighted on 6 March 1796, joined a revived Philosophical Society in Bath in 1799, and became the city's mayor in 1801. Watson died in Bath on 15 November 1824.

Watson, William, Baron Watson (1827-1899), judge, the elder son and second of the six children of Thomas Watson (1794-1864), minister of the Church of Scotland, and his wife, Eleonora (died 1887), daughter of David McHaffie of Eastwood and Overton, was born on 25 August 1827, at the manse, Covington, Lanarkshire. His parents were both Scottish and, like them, he became a member of the Church of Scotland. He was educated at the universities of Glasgow (1842-3) and Edinburgh (1843-7). Both later conferred on him the degree of LLD, the latter in 1875 and the former in 1879. He was admitted advocate on 8 March 1851, but had almost no practice until the 1860s. On 6 August 1868, then residing at 6 St Colme Street, Edinburgh, Watson married Margaret Bannatyne (1846-3 March 1898), youngest daughter of Dugald John Bannatyne (1805-1863), writer and solicitor, and his wife, Janet Bogle. They set up house in Dublin Street. Before moving to London on his promotion in 1880, they were living at 34 Moray Place. They had seven children -- six sons and one daughter. Their second son predeceased them in 1891. All their surviving sons became lawyers. The second and most distinguished of these, William Watson, became a lord of appeal in ordinary, in 1929, as Lord Thankerton of Thankerton. 
In July 1865 Watson appeared for the defence in the 'cause celebre' of Dr Edward Pritchard, the poisoner. Thereafter his practice grew steadily. In July 1874, when he was well established, Disraeli rewarded his Conservatism, then exceptional at the Scottish bar, with the office of solicitor-general for Scotland. On 6 November 1875 he was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates. In 1876 he succeeded Edward Strathearn Gordon as lord advocate and as member of parliament for the universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen. On 26 March 1878 he was sworn of the privy council, and on 2 April he was placed on the committee of the council for education in Scotland. In 1879 as lord advocate he successfully conducted the prosecution of the fraudulent directors of the City of Glasgow Bank, and he appeared in several civil actions which followed the bank's failure. On 28 April 1880 he was appointed a lord of appeal in ordinary, in place of Lord Gordon, who had died in August 1879. He was created a life peer by the title of Baron Watson of Thankerton, Lanarkshire, taking his seat on 7 May 1880. 
With his limited experience Watson might well have occupied himself mainly with Scottish cases but he was, it seems, determined to make his mark as neither of his Scottish predecessors, the lords Colonsay and Gordon, had done. Almost from the outset he grappled with the multifarious, intricate, and frequently recondite legal problems then facing the House of Lords and the privy council, which exercised a much wider territorial jurisdiction than subsequently. Watson's natural acumen and assiduity gave soundness and solidity to his decisions. In later life he was reputed the most profound lawyer in the three kingdoms, and his influence was commensurate. His familiarity with the civil law, which he owed to his Scottish training, stood him in good stead in dealing with appeals from civil law systems (see 'Gera v. Ciantar', 1887), but where such aid failed him, as in vexed questions of domicile (see 'Le Mesurier v. Le Mesurier', 1895) or French or Indian custom, his judgments were no less able. The part he took in determining the policy and practice of the privy council in Canadian appeals was of capital constitutional importance, and his mastery of English law, if less conspicuous, was hardly less consummate; the English bench and bar came to look on him as one of their own. 
Watson's authority in Scots law was immense and he showed himself sedulous to preserve its purity where he saw no cause to follow English precedent (see 'Royal Bank of Scotland v. Commercial Bank of Scotland', 1882). Both on the bench and in the legislature, however, Watson was ready to work for its assimilation to English law where he thought it was justified. At times he carried this policy too far, as in 'Mayor of Bradford v. Pickles' (1895), when he denied the existence in Scots law of an action in respect of malicious exercise of a right in order to prejudice a neighbour. 
Watson was homely in appearance and unassuming in manner, though a merciless dissector of bad argument and famous for interrupting counsel in the course of argument in his anxiety to examine every aspect of the case before him. He never lost his broad Scottish accent or acquired niceties of English style. His judgments are distinguished by methodical arrangement rather than elegance. His 'Address on the repression of crime', delivered by him in 1877 before the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, is printed in the association's 'Transactions'. Watson was a keen sportsman -- an angler, an excellent shot, and a curler -- but was otherwise somewhat indolent. He would probably have been happier living a quiet country life than dispensing justice in the most august tribunals of the British empire. 
In London Watson lived at 20 Queen's Gate, but he kept up a Scottish residence. At the time of his death it was Sunlaws House, Kelso, Roxburghshire, where he died on 14 September 1899 from an enlarged prostate and cystitis. His funeral took place in Edinburgh on 19 September 1899.

Watson, Sir William Henry (1796-1860), judge and legal writer, was born at Nottingham on 1 July 1796, son of John Watson, captain in the 76th foot, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Grey of Bamburgh, Northumberland. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Marlow, commissioned as cornet in the 1st (Royal) Dragoons by the duke of York on 14 November 1811, and promoted lieutenant on 7 May 1812 while serving in the Spanish peninsula. The 1st dragoons were reduced in 1814, and in April 1815 Watson exchanged into the 6th (Inniskilling) dragoons. He served with the regiment in Belgium and France, sharing in the Waterloo prize money in the process, and being present at the entry of the allied armies into Paris. 
Placed on half pay on 25 March 1816, Watson entered Lincoln's Inn as a student on 19 June 1817. By hard work he soon became competent to practise as a special pleader, and continued to do so until 1832, when he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn. He joined the northern circuit, where he found work and became popular, taking silk and becoming a bencher of his inn in 1843. His advocacy was honest and earnest rather than eloquent, but he was a sound lawyer and author of two (for a time) standard professional works, one on arbitration and award (1825; 3rd edn, 1846), and the other on the office of sheriff (1827; 2nd edn, 1848, by William Newland Welsby). 
On 17 August 1826 Watson married Anne (died 1828), only daughter of William Armstrong of Newcastle upon Tyne, and sister of Lord Armstrong. After Anne's death he married Mary, daughter of Anthony Capron (later Hollist) of Midhurst, Sussex, in August 1831. Each marriage produced one son. 
Watson entered the House of Commons in 1841 as Liberal member for Kinsale, retaining his seat until 1847. His Liberal candidacy for Newcastle upon Tyne in July 1852 was unsuccessful, but in 1854 he was elected member for Hull, and sat as such until his appointment to the exchequer bench on 5 November 1856 in succession to Sir Thomas Platt. Watson was knighted on 28 November 1856. He had a clear head and a strong mind, but his judicial career was cut short when at the conclusion of his charge to the grand jury at Welshpool on 12 March 1860 he was seized with apoplexy. He died the next day, and was buried at the new church in Welshpool.

Wentworth, Charles Watson-, second marquess of Rockingham (1730-1782), prime minister, was born on 13 May 1730 at Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, the fifth but only surviving son (and eighth but third surviving child) of Thomas Watson-Wentworth, first marquess of Rockingham (1693-1750), politician, and his wife, Mary (1701-1761), the daughter of Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham and seventh earl of Winchilsea, politician, and his second wife, Anne, the daughter of Christopher, first Viscount Hatton. On his father's side he was descended from Edward Watson, second Baron Rockingham (1630-1689), of Rockingham Castle, Northamptonshire, who married Anne, the daughter of the royalist politician Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford, of Wentworth Woodhouse. Their second son, Thomas (1665-1723), assumed the additional name of Wentworth on succeeding to the West Riding estates of his uncle, the second earl of Strafford, in 1695. His only son was Charles Watson-Wentworth's father, who married on 22 September 1716. He was MP for Malton (1715-27) and Yorkshire (1727-8) and lord lieutenant of the West Riding (from 1733); a staunch ally of the court whigs, he was created a knight of the Bath (27 May 1725), Baron Malton (28 May 1728), and earl of Malton (19 November 1734), and, having succeeded his kinsman as sixth Baron Rockingham (26 February 1746), was awarded a marquessate (19 April 1746). 
Charles Watson-Wentworth, who entered Westminster School in April 1738, was styled Viscount Higham from 1739 to 1746 and earl of Malton from 1746. In October 1745, aged fifteen, he was appointed colonel of a regiment of volunteers raised against Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender. That winter he slipped away under a false name and, having reached Carlisle, offered his services to the commander-in-chief, William, duke of Cumberland, a gesture for which he received the congratulations of an amused court. From 1746 to 1748 he pursued a desultory course of study under George Quarme in Geneva, and for the next two years he lived in Italy under Major James Forrester; he returned to England, via Austria, Prussia, Hanover, and Brunswick, in 1750. Although he had had several childhood illnesses, it may also have been in Italy, through at least one sexual liaison, that he contracted what was probably a persistent problem in his urogenitary system. His 'old complaint', as he called it, caused him frequently recurring bouts of debilitating sickness and may have made him impotent, though some contemporaries regarded him as a hypochondriac. 
Watson-Wentworth was created earl of Malton in the Irish peerage on 17 September 1750, and succeeded his father as second marquess of Rockingham on 14 December that year, becoming one of the wealthiest peers in Britain. In addition to extensive properties in Northamptonshire and co. Wicklow, and a London town house at 4 Grosvenor Square, he inherited the princely estates centred on the palatial family home of Wentworth House (as it was then known). He is estimated to have received an annual income of over $20,000 in 1751, which probably at least doubled over the following thirty years. On 26 February 1752 he married his childhood fiancee, Mary Bright ('bap'. 1735, died 1804) ['see 'Wentworth, Mary Watson-], at the house of her stepfather, Sir John Ramsden, third baronet, in Golden Square, St James's, Piccadilly. She was the daughter and heir, with a fortune of $60,000, of Thomas Bright of Badsworth, near Pontefract, the son of John Bright, formerly Liddell, MP for Pontefract (1698-1701), and his wife, Margaret, the daughter of William Norton of Sawley, near Ripon. Rockingham's social prestige was enhanced by the fact that for many years he was the only nobleman to hold the rank of a British marquessate as his principal title, so that, to his friends, he was simply 'the Marquess'. 
Like his father before him, Rockingham was highly esteemed by Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, the northern secretary of state, and his early political connections were naturally with Henry Pelham's court whig ministry. On 18 July 1751 he was appointed lord lieutenant and 'custos rotulorum' of the West Riding of Yorkshire and of the county of the city of York, and 'custos rotulorum' of the North Riding, and on the same day he became a lord of the bedchamber to George II. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 21 May 1751, and made his maiden speech on 17 March 1752, in defence of the government's bill to confiscate the lands of Scottish Jacobite rebels, but he declined to move the address in late 1753, and for a long time he was inactive in parliament. He took a close interest in the fortunes of the Yorkshire woollen manufacturers, on which subject a pamphlet was addressed to him in 1752. He largely baulked at the programme of political education prepared for him by his uncle William Murray, later Lord Mansfield, the solicitor-general, and in the early 1750s displayed a youthful naivety and an occasionally headstrong element -- which he never entirely lost -- in what was otherwise a placid temperament. 
Rockingham made a precipitate attempt to promote the candidacy of his friend Sir George Savile, an archetypal independent country gentleman, for the representation of Yorkshire at a county meeting in York on 16 July 1753, but withdrew without trying his strength. His embarrassment arose from having dared to oppose the two sitting ministerialist whig MPs and at finding that his appeal to the freeholders had raised their hackles against overt aristocratic interference. Nevertheless, although the representation was unchanged at the general election of 1754, Savile was elected unopposed on a vacancy in January 1759, and thereafter Rockingham, who had learned the necessity of endeavouring to lead public opinion by appearing to follow it, had the most important influence in county affairs. At the large freeman borough of York, where in December 1753 the Whig Club was renamed after him, he gained control of one seat in 1754 and of the other by 1768. He was patron of the rotten boroughs of Malton and Higham Ferrers, disposed of a seat at Hull from 1766, when he became its high steward (7 April), and had influence at Beverley, Hedon, and Scarborough. He also had an interest in co. Wicklow elections to the Irish parliament. 
Rockingham was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1751 and of the Society of Antiquaries in 1752; he became a member of White's, the Jockey Club, and the Society of Dilettanti in the 1750s; and in 1763 he was appointed a trustee of Westminster School and a governor of Charterhouse. He applied himself to the improvement of his estates, which included the encouragement of mining and canal developments, and was praised for his efforts by the agriculturist Arthur Young. He also completed the work begun by his father on Wentworth House, erected several monuments in the grounds, and built a lavish stable block. This reflected his predominating interests in racing and gambling, and he was one of the foremost patrons of the turf, being responsible, for example, for naming the St Leger at Doncaster after his friend Colonel Anthony St Leger. An art collector, one of his commissions was Stubbs's magnificent canvas of his horse Whistlejacket (now in the National Gallery). He was knowledgeable on the coins of the Roman empire. 
Rockingham, who was appointed vice-admiral of Yorkshire on 27 February 1755, gained a reputation for acting with initiative and moderation in county matters. He restored peace after the food riots in Sheffield in 1756 without resorting to the use of force, and, despite local disturbances, successfully raised three militia regiments the following year. Remaining loyal to Newcastle, he declined the offer of becoming master of horse to the prince of Wales in late 1756, and showed a determination to resign his household office, which did not in the end prove necessary, during the ministerial crisis in June 1757, when George II had to appoint a court whig ministry led by Newcastle and William Pitt. In recognition of his potential political influence, he was nominated a knight of the Garter on 4 February 1760, and was installed on 6 May. He continued to hold the office of lord of the bedchamber on the accession of George III that year, and assisted at the coronation on 26 September 1761. 
Rockingham showed an early distaste for the complexion of the new court and disliked the appointment of the king's favourite, John Stuart, third earl of Bute, as northern secretary of state in March 1761. His aversion was increased by the ministerialist opposition he experienced in Yorkshire at the general election that year and by the growing disrespect with which Newcastle was treated in matters of patronage and policy. He began to believe that the new reign would mark a displacement of the old whig families who had created the Hanoverian settlement, and on 9 May 1762 wrote to Newcastle: 'I must look and ever shall upon you and your connections as the solid foundations on which every good, which has happened to this country since the Revolution, have been erected' (BL, Add. MS 32938, fol. 123). He therefore supported his chief's resignation that month, and, although, like him, he initially eschewed the idea of formal opposition, he was involved in organizing what proved to be a disastrous attack on the popular peace preliminaries at the opening of parliament (9 December 1762). After the king's petulant dismissal of William Cavendish, fourth duke of Devonshire, the lord chamberlain, Rockingham took a lead in resigning from the bedchamber on 3 November, and, punished along with other 'Pelhamite innocents', he was removed from his lord lieutenancies in December 1762. 
Not alone in thinking that circumstances would soon provide the opening for humiliating the king into taking back a strengthened court whig ministry, Rockingham divided steadily but silently with the opposition whigs and began to play an increasingly prominent part in their activities over the following three years. He maintained close relations with Newcastle and Devonshire, as well as Cumberland, the king's uncle, who provided a royal focus for the connection. He had an important role in liaising with Pitt, a difficult but almost indispensable ally, so that, while he had no sympathy with the licentiousness of John Wilkes, he supported the campaign against general warrants. To encourage opposition whig MPs, he helped organize their conduct in the Commons, urging them, for example, to attack the cider tax in March 1763 and countenancing the establishment in February 1764 of an opposition club, Wildman's. He bridged the age gap between the enthusiastic 'young friends' of Newcastle and the elderly grandees, but sometimes despaired of achieving power with an unorganized and ineffectual faction. However, by mid-1765 George III was determined to replace George Grenville as prime minister. At a meeting of opposition leaders at Newcastle's house on 30 June, Rockingham concurred in his friends' decision to accept office and voted in the majority of twelve to six to do so without Pitt. 
Rockingham, who, during former negotiations, had been suggested as a possible first lord of the Admiralty, lord chamberlain, or lord lieutenant of Ireland, had held no ministerial office of any rank before he was sworn of the privy council (10 July 1765) and became first lord of the Treasury (13 July). The following month he was reappointed to his lord lieutenancies. That he should have been promoted to the nominal headship of the ministry was a reflection of his enhanced status within the recent opposition, but it was also due partly to the absence of other candidates -- Devonshire having died in 1764 and Newcastle, who instead became lord privy seal, too old and, in any case, unacceptable to Pitt. Rockingham's administration was a coalition, in which some of the king's former ministers were retained, such as Robert Henley, first earl of Northington, the lord chancellor, and John Perceval, second earl of Egmont, first lord of the Admiralty. Although they could not all be accommodated, several of his and Newcastle's supporters were given junior offices, and Augustus Henry Fitzroy, duke of Grafton, and Henry Seymour Conway were made secretaries of state. The old tory William Dowdeswell was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, and the young Edmund Burke became Rockingham's private secretary. As the administration had been formed under Cumberland's auspices, his death on 31 October further elevated the role of Rockingham, who quickly assumed the authority of prime minister. 
The ministry was dominated by the American 'Stamp Act' crisis, and Rockingham, whose initial concern to enforce the act soon gave way to a spirit of compromise, nevertheless always maintained that the imperial parliament had the power to tax the colonies. Since he was closely connected with a number of leading merchants whose affairs were endangered by the American embargo, his was one of the voices in a divided cabinet in favour of repealing the act on the grounds of commercial necessity. He was anxious to restore the peace of mind of the Americans by acting with moderation and integrity, thus to win the grateful obedience of the colonies by the benevolence of the 'mother country'. Although the ministry was plagued by internal instability, the way was paved for the 'Stamp Act Repeal Bill' by Pitt's declaration in its favour, and, partly to please the hardliners, a 'Declaratory Act' was also introduced to assert Britain's parliamentary supremacy. The passage of the repeal bill was, however, disrupted by the opposition of the Bedfords and Grenvilles, and by several of the 'king's friends', office-holders who were not disciplined by the king for their hostile votes. Such misunderstandings diminished Rockingham's limited credit with George III, so that, for example, when Lord Strange announced that the king would prefer modification of the 'Stamp Act' (10 February 1766), Rockingham had to extract an embarrassing reiteration of his former statement supporting repeal. 
Among the essentially backward-looking and self-justificatory measures passed by the government, however, were the liberalization of commercial relations with the West Indian colonies, the repeal of the cider tax, and the condemnation of general warrants. But Rockingham showed his administrative inexperience, and his parliamentary management was poor. In the Lords, where he spoke only once or twice, his performance was abysmal, leading Granville Leveson-Gower, second Earl Gower, jokingly to reprove John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich: 'how could you worry the poor dumb creature so!' (Walpole, 'Memoirs of... George III', 2.317). Relations with George III, who treated Rockingham honestly, if not loyally, continued to deteriorate, notably over Rockingham's refusal to accept the admission of Buteites to office, the appointment in May 1766 of Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond, as Grafton's replacement, and his ineptness in failing to make parliamentary provision for the princes. Having decided to turn to Pitt, the king used a disagreement over the government of Canada as a pretext to remove Rockingham, who was surprised, but greatly relieved, to leave office on 30 July 1766. 
Rockingham, who was at first supportive of the new ministry, in which many of his friends remained under the earl of Chatham (as Pitt had become), received several congratulatory addresses on returning to Yorkshire in August 1766. His premiership had given him a strong claim to the leadership, and Newcastle complained to William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, third duke of Portland, on 1 October that Rockingham, 'who takes upon himself to be the head of the party, is full as dry, as uncommunicative to me, out of power, as he was, when he was in it' (Portland MS PwF 7516). The dismissal of Lord Edgcumbe, the treasurer of the household, later that year, an alarm which signalled the resignation of a few close supporters, enhanced his role as leader of a small but distinct group in opposition. He co-operated with John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, and George Grenville in harrying the ministry during the spring and summer of 1767, advocating a more conciliatory policy towards America and defending the chartered rights of the East India Company. He was doubtful about the merits of factious opportunism, as when the Rockinghams, as they were increasingly known, forced a reduction in the land tax in the Commons on 27 February 1767. 
Through his private connections and personal charm, Rockingham began to set a tone of moral resolution, consistency, and self-righteousness for his party's conduct, which precluded opposition for its own sake. Rebuffing an approach from another parliamentary group, he recorded on 8 January 1767: 'I acknowledged that I thought the state of us and our friends viewed through political glasses would appear a forlorn hope and that no immediate success could be expected, but that on the other hand we were not in an uncomfortable situation, because every dictate of honour and principle encouraged us to persevere on the same plan which we had done for years.(Rockingham MS R1-743; Albemarle, 2.32)' He broke up the promising negotiations with the Bedfords on 20 July 1767 over his wish to retain Conway and suspicions that the hardline views on America of Bedford's ally Grenville might come to prevail. He presumably endorsed Dowdeswell's 'memorandum' (Rockingham MS R1-842), which defended the virtuous exclusiveness of his party, and stressed the need for it to take the directing role in any future administration. Though a court whig in origin, he was by temperament much more of a country whig, and he brought to his party such attributes as distrust of the executive and the desire to protect individual liberties. 
Rockingham could count on the loyalty of a number of mainly northern magnates and their electoral followings, and on a group of diverse independents, so that, after the general election of 1768, there were about sixty MPs and thirty peers in the Rockingham whig party. Although his following shrank over the next decade and was largely ineffectual in parliament, it remained a distinct element in both houses and claimed the occasional success, as in the passage of the 'Nullum Tempus Bill' in 1769, a response to Portland's recent electoral struggles. It was in defence of the rights of electors, though with no wish to agitate the wider issues of radical participatory politics with which the affair was enmeshed, that Rockingham added his support to the cause of Wilkes, MP for Middlesex, who had been unseated by the Commons. At a 'conciliabulum', or meeting of party leaders, at Wentworth in September 1769, he reluctantly agreed to sanction a Yorkshire county meeting, which he chose not to attend, provided it was confined to addressing the king for a dissolution. In parliament he went further, personally advocating measures of 'economical reform', such as alteration of the civil list in March 1769. In his own thinking, personal resentment of Bute -- who was blamed for his friends' dismissals in 1762 -- had by now been transformed into a coherent, albeit warped, theory of 'secret influence', an ideology encapsulated by Edmund Burke in his party manifesto 'The Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents' (1770). Indeed, Burke played a crucial role in the development of Rockingham's political character, for not only was he a capable 'man of business' who constantly cajoled Rockingham into greater activity, but he expounded a generalized understanding of the political ills of the state and vindicated virtuous party opposition as the instrument for its rehabilitation. Furthermore, no doubt because he was frustrated by his leader's usual lack of urgency, the insistent and compelling tone of his letters had the effect of drawing forth from Rockingham just the sort of innate sense of aristocratic responsibility which Burke most sought to inculcate in him. 
It was nervousness that made Rockingham such a poor public speaker. Of one debate, he reported to Portland on 3 March 1769: 'I was from beginning to end, in a most violent agitation and was obliged to 'speak' notwithstanding, 'three' times. I got a good draft of Madeira before I went to the House, and had a comfortable breathing of a vein, by Mr Adair's lancet afterwards. (Portland MS PwF 9016)' He made his first major recorded speech on 22 January 1770, when, moving for an inquiry into the state of the nation, he demonstrated how the 'principle of prerogative' lay behind each incident and issue which had arisen since George III's accession. From then onwards he not only voted frequently, but also spoke often enough and sufficiently well to explain his party's position in parliament. 
Prey to illness, idleness, or country distractions, and being a lazy correspondent, Rockingham was not always an active politician, but he made periodic attempts to organize the party. Pamphlets were issued intermittently, and, though little use was made of newspapers, he encouraged the composition and publication of Lords' protests, most of which he signed. He called pre-sessional meetings, compiled lists of party members in both houses, held proxies for friends in the Lords, sometimes attended debates in the Commons, and usually summoned his supporters and informally co-ordinated their parliamentary tactics. The extent and importance of his authority was revealed by the problems experienced in his absence during the winter of 1770-71, with his sick wife at Bath, and of 1772-3, when he was ill himself. As his deputy, Richmond, wrote to him on 16 February 1771: 'the want of you to keep people together, particularly the House of Commons gentlemen, is too apparent. There are many of them who will upon most occasions vote with us, but want to be spoke to... and the thing that influences them is the personal regard they have for you, which will make them do for your speaking what they will not do for another man's. (Rockingham MS R1-1363)' In 1769 and 1770 Rockingham worked warily with the more radically inclined Chatham in a 'united opposition' that centred on the Middlesex election, about which he introduced a motion of censure on 2 February 1770. On 18 May he made a significant intervention in the Lords in favour of moderation towards America. He used the Falkland Islands crisis to exploit the lack of ministerial preparations on 22 November, and protested against the exclusion of strangers from both houses for bogus reasons of national security on 10 December. He gained credit in the City by ostentatiously visiting in the Tower on 30 March 1771 the magistrates Crosby and Oliver, who had been imprisoned by the Commons for upholding the freedom of the press. In 1772 and 1773 he lent support to measures for extending toleration to dissenters. He spoke against the 'Royal Marriages Bill' on 20 February and 2 March 1772, and in mid-1773 he again defended the East India Company, in which he was a proprietor, in both cases opposing the surreptitious extension of the influence of the crown. In the autumn of 1773 he led a successful non-partisan but self-interested lobby against the imposition of a tax on Irish absentee landowners. 
Rockingham, who blamed the North government for provoking American resistance, nevertheless condemned the Boston Tea Party and other outrages, and in this respect did not differ from the rest of the British establishment in his attitude to the colonies. Moreover, he was hampered by his commitment to his own 'Declaratory Act', and was accused of having worsened the situation by his capitulation to American pressure in 1766, which was said to have taught the colonies to use violence to attain their ends. Yet, influenced by a number of American correspondents, he still believed that moderation and trade concessions, such as abolition of the tea duty, would restore peace and prosperity, and he persisted in leading the Rockinghamite opposition during a period of exceptional difficulty. He presented an American petition against government legislation to reform the administration of Massachusetts (11 May 1774), advocated conciliation (18 May), and opposed the 'Quebec Bill' (17 June). He gave some support to Chatham's imperial proposals on 20 January 1775. On 7 February he rose at the same time as the colonial secretary, William Legge, second earl of Dartmouth, but failed in his attempt to bring up an American merchants' petition before the main business of addressing the king to enforce British legislative authority was considered. He presented other petitions on the dire commercial implications of antagonizing America on 15 March, and the following day pointed out the arbitrary nature of the proposed measures. He moved an amendment to the address of thanks to re-establish peaceful relations on 26 November 1775, and four days later, with widespread support, defeated a bill to indemnify the employment of foreign troops. 
At the time of the general election of 1774 Rockingham had expressed his dismay at the state of politics, and although in late 1775 he could write of the 'conscientious satisfaction' (Rockingham MS R1-1610) of maintaining a principled opposition to the popular war with America, he recognized that his position would be hopeless as long as he was seen as appeasing or aiding the enemy's cause. After the poor party showing in early 1776, he supported the idea of a remonstrance against the whole conduct of the government, but this did not materialize. The planned secession of his parliamentary supporters, during the 1776-7 session, failed to make a great impression because it was too often broken, not least by Rockingham himself, who moved an amendment to the address (31 October 1776) and attacked the use of the civil list to promote secret influence (16 April 1777). Beguiled, as he was most summers, by the pleasures of life away from politics, he was forced by his despair at the eclipse of the nation's guiding constitutional principles to continue his efforts. He wrote to Portland, on 5 November 1777, that he felt: 'most strongly that there is a duty which 'I' perhaps most particularly owe to the 'persons' of those, who not only encouraged and incited me, but also, whose principles deserve a better fate, than to be buried in the ruins of their country. I confess I feel a solicitude even for myself, I could wish to have it to say, and I could wish to have it remembered and recorded, that to the last moment 'we' struggled in behalf of this poor infatuated country. (Portland MS PwF 9117)' He was active in the united opposition campaign of early 1778, making interventions on 6 February and 23 and 30 March, and he was present at Chatham's last fatal appearance in the Lords on 7 April. Critical of the management of the war, he was by now reluctantly prepared to concede independence to America, especially given the additional security dangers posed by the outbreak of war against France. He made a major speech in condemnation of the peace commissioners on 7 December 1778, declaring that their threat to desolate the colonies was 'repugnant to the principles of Christianity' (Rockingham MS R81-105). 
Rockingham sponsored Savile's 'Catholic Relief Bill', reporting from the Lords committee on it on 25 May 1778. He was active in the defence of the whig admiral Augustus Keppel, whose court martial at Portsmouth he attended, and after the latter's acquittal he moved a vote of thanks to him in the Lords on 16 February 1779. On 5 May he had an audience with the king to appraise him of the dangerous situation of Ireland, and in parliament, on 11 May, he moved an address for the relief of distress there and the liberalization of trade. He criticized Sandwich's handling of the navy on 25 June, in a speech in which he justified the course of his own career. Later that year Rockingham, who had been reappointed to the office of vice-admiral of Yorkshire in December 1776, acted decisively to defend Hull from the pirate John Paul Jones. He was thanked by the king, though his conduct was a part of the patriotic reaction of the governing elite at a time of national emergency. 
Yet, at the same time, Rockingham continued to hope that the delusions of the people would be shattered, and that the declining ministry would be brought down. He called for the dismissal of ministers on 25 November, condemned the lack of measures to pacify Ireland on 1 December, and advocated alteration of the civil list on 7 December. The reduction of public expenditure and the abolition of places and pensions served both financial and constitutional purposes, which were at the heart of his attitude to the crown. However, he objected to the ideas of parliamentary reform which were promoted by Christopher Wyvill's association movement that winter. Although he attended a Yorkshire county meeting on 30 December 1779, he was relieved that the petition avoided such 'crude propositions' as increased county representation or tests for parliamentary candidates. He declined to attend another meeting in 1780, and the only concession he made was to agree with the reduction of the duration of parliament to three years, that being the period fixed after the revolution of 1688. In a detailed speech on the public accounts on 8 February, he linked developments in America, India, and Ireland with the undue weight of monarchical influence, and he criticized ministers on 21 February and 1 and 6 March 1780. 
While support was accruing to the opposition, internal divisions were becoming more marked, so that Rockingham's refusal to countenance parliamentary reform risked alienating Chatham's just as independently minded successor, William Petty, second earl of Shelburne. The two men differed, too, in their reactions to the Gordon riots, after which Rockingham attended the privy council to approve measures to restore law and order (7 June 1780). Later that month Rockingham was approached with a proposal to strengthen the ministry, but he set three unacceptable preconditions: that the king would not veto American independence, but would allow certain items of economical reform, and would appoint leading Rockinghamites to office. Caught by surprise at the dissolution of parliament that year, he managed to preserve his electoral influence, saving face in Yorkshire by countenancing the unopposed return, with Savile, of Henry Duncombe, a member of Wyvill's association. In the Lords he objected to the extension of hostilities against the Dutch states (25 January 1781), made a statistical speech against the burdensome nature of the loan (21 March), opposed the address (27 November), and presented a comprehensive account of the calamitous state of the nation (19 December). Although he led the largest portion of the opposition, when, in March 1782, the defeat of the British forces at Yorktown finally destroyed Lord North's administration, it was Shelburne who took the initiative in negotiating for the appointment of a new ministry. 
Rockingham returned to the Treasury on 30 March 1782 without the full trust of George III and in such a poor state of health that he had little authority or strength to settle the quarrels over patronage and policy which beset his second ministry. The offices of the two (reduced from three) secretaryships of state were shared between the two sides of the former opposition. Charles James Fox, who was a leading proponent of American independence, became foreign secretary, but disagreed frequently with Shelburne, whose responsibilities covered home and colonial affairs, and who favoured holding back the offer of independence as a bargaining counter. Not only the peace negotiations, but also the demands for parliamentary reform made by Richmond, who went to the Ordnance as master-general, threatened to split the cabinet, which again had the appearance of an uneasy coalition. The lord chancellor, Lord Thurlow, was retained, and the former Chathamites were represented by Lord Camden, the lord president, and Grafton, the privy seal. Of the other Rockinghamites, Keppel (now a viscount) was made first lord of the Admiralty and Lord John Cavendish was appointed chancellor of the exchequer. 
The first government to implement in office the programme which it had formulated in opposition, the second Rockingham administration made some striking short-term changes, which, however, were of little long-term significance. The war was brought to an end, but virtually no progress was made in securing what could be salvaged of Britain's imperial possessions and naval supremacy. Portland, the lord lieutenant of Ireland, oversaw the hurried implementation of legislative independence, but the repeal of the 'Declaratory Act' and the modification of Poynings' law failed to resolve the problem of how Ireland was to be governed. Though considerably watered down, unprecedented economical reforms were none the less made, by the exclusion from the Commons of revenue officers ('Crewe's Act') and government contractors ('Clerke's Act'), and by the controls on state expenditure introduced by Burke, the paymaster of the forces, in his 'Civil Establishment Act'. Yet little was done to gain the confidence of the king, who was already secretly negotiating to replace Rockingham, when Rockingham's death, on 1 July 1782 at his home in Wimbledon, Surrey, brought the ministry to an end. Shelburne became prime minister, and a few days later the Rockingham whigs split, with Fox leading a band of supporters back into opposition. 
Rockingham, whose death, although attributed to influenza, was almost certainly due to his lifelong illness, was buried in York Minster on 20 July 1782. He and his wife had no children, and all his titles became extinct. By his will, dated 4 September 1764, and several codicils, for which administration was granted in London on 5 June 1784, he made bequests to members of his family, including the children of his sister Henrietta Alicia and her Irish groom, William Sturgeon. Rockingham's affectionate and drily humorous wife, who acted as a political secretary and was a source of moral support, received $5000 and lived at Hillingdon House, near Uxbridge, Middlesex, until her death, on 19 December 1804. The estates, and about half the personalty of $84,400, were inherited by Rockingham's nephew, his sister Anne's son, William Fitzwilliam, second Earl Fitzwilliam (the fourth Earl Fitzwilliam in the Irish peerage). It was Fitzwilliam who, in 1826, as its patron, had the local Swinton pottery works renamed after his uncle, who is therefore commemorated in the china known as Rockingham ware. 
Rockingham, a tall and dignified man, was almost universally admired for his unimpeachable private virtue, his immense personal charm, and his calm and temperate manner. He was most likeable when at ease at Wentworth, and once admitted to Richmond (in June 1769): 'I often think, that I could set down here, attend and watch on the wants and necessities of those who are near to me, be of use and assistance to many, and finally secure to myself the comfort of thinking, that I have done some good. (Rockingham MS R1-1199)' Yet unfulfilled personal ambition, a quietly stubborn streak, and an all-pervading sense of duty to the public ceaselessly drew him back to the unrewarding field of politics. In a sense he personified a form of suffering nobility, and the notion of an aristocratic trusteeship over the true constitutional virtues of Britain, at a time when an ill-advised king presided over a diseased body politic, suffused the whole of his public conduct. 
As a statesman, however, Rockingham was wholly inadequate, and it was his rank and fortune alone, combined with luck, that propelled him to prominence. Horace Walpole, a severe critic, was only doing him justice when he wrote, on the day of his death: 'his parts were by no means great; he was nervous, and mere necessity alone made him at all a speaker in Parliament, where, though he spoke good sense, neither flattery nor partiality could admire or applaud. He was rather trifling and dilatory in business than indolent. Virtues and amiability he must have possessed, for his party esteemed him highly, and his friends loved him with an unalterable attachment. In the excess of faction that we have seen, he was never abused, and no man in public life, I believe, had ever fewer enemies. (Walpole, 'Corr.', 25.288)' Rockingham's ministries achieved little, and, at least in national politics, he was rarely successful in the causes he espoused, while to a certain extent his connection itself, like his electoral interest, barely outlived him. His guiding principle, that there was a powerful system of secret influence, controlled first by Bute and later by others, was essentially false. It provided an explanation of failure and a motivation for continued opposition, but was otherwise barren -- although it may have had a significance in the contribution it made to the revolutionary American misunderstanding of monarchical tyranny in Britain. 
But, if Rockingham was palpably unfitted for the career of a politician, his close friendships, consistently held principles, and steady political stance were the means of binding together the party which bore his name. As he showed from the early 1760s, his personal charm enabled him to mediate between the conflicting personalities and competing opinions of his colleagues and working partners, and by the 1770s his higher public profile and improved organizational abilities ensured that he led what was effectively the only political party in existence. Throughout the period of his leadership he attempted to advance the same principles: at home, the defence of individual liberties, chartered rights, and private property; and abroad, the promotion of commerce, just colonial relations, and peace in Europe. Above all, he sought to restore the purity of the revolution constitution, not only by implementing a programme of economical reform, but by insisting, in the course of several abortive negotiations for entering office, on the creation of a stable and independent government, in which his most trusted friends would hold the dominant positions. Although he did not live long enough to benefit from it, the very emphasis that he placed on virtue, principle, and consistency itself gave a momentum to the fortunes of the Rockingham whig party, whose coherence was in a sense strengthened by its limited size and exclusive nature. His untimely death, therefore, immediately secured him a place in the pantheon of whig heroes, which was confirmed by Fitzwilliam's erection at Wentworth of a classical mausoleum designed by John Carr. Its grandiloquent inscription, written by Burke, commended him for his establishment of a permanent means of safeguarding the constitution: 'for it was his aim through life to convert party connection and personal friendship (which others had rendered subservient only to temporary views and the purposes of ambition) into a lasting depository of his principles, that their energy should not depend upon his life, nor fluctuate with the intrigues of a court, or with the capricious fashions amongst the people. (Albemarle, 2.486-7)' Rockingham was never an unequivocal 'friend of America'. Neither were his principles the foundation of nineteenth-century liberalism or his party the precursor of a system of alternating two-party politics, as whig historians of the Victorian era imagined. Recent scholarship, assisted by the opening of the Wentworth Woodhouse muniments to public access in the 1950s, has rightly delineated the personal and political failings of Rockingham and his friends. Yet he can nevertheless be credited with the leadership of a unique, albeit small and rudimentary, parliamentary party, which in the mid- to late eighteenth century claimed back the label 'whig', and which therefore earned its place in the broad continuum of whiggery from Walpole to Grey.

James Watt (1698-1782), merchant, and his wife, Agnes Muirhead (1703-1755), whom he married about 1728. His family were prominent citizens of Greenock, and his grandfather, Thomas Watt (1642-1734), was a well-known teacher there of mathematics, surveying, and navigation. The elder James Watt was also described at various times as a shipwright, chandler, carpenter and joiner, and shipowner; and he served as chief magistrate (or bailie) of Greenock in 1751. His wife was said to be a woman of forceful character and intellect. James and Agnes were buried in the churchyard of Greenock's West Church, and in 1808 their son had a tombstone erected in memory of his 'revered parents'. The inscription on it, written by the younger James, praised his father as: 'A benevolent and ingenious man and a zealous promoter of the improvements of the town' (Williamson, 188).

Watt, James (1736-1819), engineer and scientist, was born on 19 January 1736 in Greenock, Renfrewshire, the eldest surviving child of the eight children, five of whom died in infancy, of 
James Watt was a delicate child and suffered from frequent headaches during his childhood and adult life. He was taught at home by his mother at first, then was sent to M'Adam's school in Greenock. He later went to Greenock grammar school where he learned Latin and some Greek but was considered to be slow. However, on being introduced to mathematics, he showed both interest and ability. He helped in his father's workshops and began work there on leaving school. He made models at the bench and it is likely that his father intended James to follow him in his business. However, some of the elder Watt's commercial speculations having failed, both James and his brother had to find employment as soon as possible and it was decided that James should go to Glasgow to learn the trade of mathematical instrument maker. 
On his arrival in Glasgow in June 1754 Watt stayed with his mother's family. He had brought some carpentry tools and a quadrant with him to Glasgow, which were presumably intended for his first workshop. Through his mother's relative George Muirhead he came into contact in this university city with a number of men who profoundly influenced him. Muirhead had recently moved from the chair of oriental languages to the chair of humanity at Glasgow University. He, John Anderson, and Robert Dick, as well as Joseph Black and Gilbert Hamilton, were all members of the Literary Society of Glasgow. Dr Robert Dick, who became one of Watt's closest friends, had succeeded his father as professor of natural philosophy. It was he who advised Watt to go to London to obtain better tuition in instrument making than could be obtained in Scotland, and he gave him an introduction to James Short, a mathematician and well-known telescope maker of Scottish origin. Watt was now in his twentieth year and, never having served an apprenticeship, could not rank as journeyman; moreover, in order to lessen any financial burden on his father, he needed to learn the greatest amount in the shortest time possible. He arrived in London in June 1755 and had some difficulty in finding a tutor. He spent a short time with a Mr Neale, a watchmaker, but Short introduced Watt to John Morgan, a mathematical instrument maker of Cornhill, and Morgan undertook to instruct Watt for one year in return for 20 guineas and Watt's labour. Watt told his father that Morgan 'can teach me most branches of the business such as rules, scales, quadrants etc.' ('Origin and Progress', 1.xxv) and within a month he was making the brass part of Hadley's quadrants. He described his master as: 'as good a character, both for accuracy in his business and good morals, as any in his way in London' (ibid., 1.xxiv). 
Watt lived in considerable poverty in London. Anxious to cost his father as little as possible, it is believed he lodged with his master, though not receiving board. But the draughty workshop, poor food, long hours, and painstaking work made him ill. By the year's end he noted: 'I am now able to work as well as most journeymen' ('Origin and Progress', 1.xxvi), and, purchasing the bare necessities of materials and tools, he returned to Scotland in August 1756. After a few months' recuperation he went back to Glasgow, where he was given quarters in the university; he apparently found difficulty in establishing himself in the city, as he was neither the son of a burgess nor had served a full apprenticeship. Watt assisted Robert Dick to unpack and to renovate a valuable collection of astronomical instruments, formerly the property of Alexander Macfarlane, which had arrived from Jamaica. He was permitted to open a workshop in the university and to call himself mathematical instrument maker to the university. 
Through his interest in natural philosophy Watt came to the attention of Dr Joseph Black, who by 1757 was professor of the practice of medicine. He made various instruments for Black's experimental work, including an organ (built in 1761) and a perspective machine which became the prototype for some fifty to eighty made subsequently. Black described Watt as: 'a young man possessing most uncommon talents for mechanical knowledge and practice' ('Origin and Progress', 1.xxxv). Black later wrote that Watt was as 'remarkable for the goodness of his heart and the candour and simplicity of his mind, as for the acuteness of his genius and understanding' (ibid., 1.xxxvi). In 1758 Watt met John Robison, who succeeded Black as lecturer on chemistry in Glasgow and later became professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh. Both Robison and Black became lifelong friends, testifying, forty years later, on behalf of Watt and his partner Matthew Boulton during the lawsuits against engine patent infringers in 1796-7. 
Robison described a visit to Watt's workshop in the university: 'I saw a workman... but was surprised to find a philosopher as young as myself and always ready to instruct me' ('Origin and Progress', 1.xliii). Robison relates how Watt thrived on solving problems and was consulted by many of the young men with scientific interests in and around Glasgow: 'everything became to him a subject of new and serious study. Everything became science in his hands' (ibid., 1.xlvi). Watt learned German in order to read J. Leupold's 'Theatrum machinarum' (1727), and he also learned Italian, sharing his enthusiasm for knowledge with his friends. 
As Watt had made little money in his first year he decided that the best opportunity lay in making Hadley's quadrants. He believed that he would need to travel to Liverpool and London to sell them (he did go to London), though he also found some demand in Glasgow. In order to expand his business he required capital, and this was achieved by entering into partnership with John Craig, said to have been an architect. Watt was to receive $35 p.a. in wages and an equal share of the profits. The partners took premises in Saltmarket in Glasgow in 1759. An inventory drawn up at the time shows Watt to have been selling quadrants, compasses, burning-glasses, and microscopes, among other goods. By 1763 the business was prospering, and Watt employed several journeymen and took on apprentices. He moved to Trongate, one of the main streets in Glasgow, and announced in a newspaper advertisement that besides mathematical and musical instruments he offered a variety of 'toys and other goods' for sale (Dickinson, 28). These were the steel ornaments made in Birmingham by a number of manufacturers, including Watt's future business partner, Matthew Boulton. In 1763 Watt acquired a financial interest in the Delftfield Pottery Company in Glasgow. Porcelain manufacture had not long been introduced to Britain and manufacturers were keen to improve the quality. Watt took an active scientific interest in the Delftfield concern, advising on clays, flint-grinding mills, and furnace construction, and eventually he came to have a considerable financial share in the concern. During his canal work he improved the surveying level and produced a new micrometer and a dividing engine. He also devised a drawing machine, though this did not meet his expectations. 
Watt's interest in steam engines dates from about 1759, when John Robison suggested that he consider the application of steam power to road carriages and mining. But the idea was not developed further and, on Robison's departure from Glasgow, the project was abandoned. In the early 1760s Watt began some experiments on the force of steam in a Papin's digester and 'formed [a model of] a species of steam engine' ('Origin and Progress', 1.lxvii); but he abandoned the idea due to pressure of other work and in the belief that an engine on the principle employed might suffer the same drawbacks as Thomas Savery's engine -- namely, the danger that the boiler might burst, the difficulty of making the joints sufficiently tight, and the loss of much of the power of the steam on the downward stroke of the piston. Nevertheless, he was to describe this mechanism in his 1769 and 1784 patents. 
In the winter of 1763-4 Watt was asked to repair the model of a Newcomen engine which belonged to the natural philosophy class at Glasgow University. At this time his knowledge of steam engines was largely derived from J. T. Desaguliers's 'A Course of Mechanical and Experimental Philosophy' (1734) and B. F. De Belidor's 'Architecture hydraulique' (1753). He set about repairing the model engine 'as a mere mechanician' ('Origin and Progress', 1.lxix) but found that the boiler could not supply it with steam. Watt identified several problems, of which the wastage of steam during the ascent of the engine piston and the method of vacuum formation in which the system was cooled were two of the most fundamental. He therefore made a new model, slightly larger than the original, and conducted many experiments on it. This led him to his well-known tea kettle experiment in which he discovered the latent heat of steam while not understanding the scientific principle, though he subsequently learned the explanation from Joseph Black. 
The theory of latent heat underpinned Watt's experiments on the separate condenser, in which the steam cylinder remained hot while a separate condensing vessel was cold. He is said to have had the inspiration for this device while walking in the environs of Glasgow one spring afternoon in 1765. Writing more than forty years later, he stated that, once the separate condenser was conceived, 'all... improvements followed as corollaries in quick succession, so that in the course of one or two days the invention was thus far complete in my mind, and I immediately set about an experiment to verify it practically' ('Origin and Progress', 1.lxxvi). While in a general sense this was probably true, many practical problems remained to be solved -- not all of them by Watt. 
In 1765 and 1766 Watt erected several atmospheric engines in Scotland, probably incorporating parts made to his own designs. Work on steam engines was displaced for over a year by civil engineering engagements, but in 1768 he recommenced trials on model engines and in the autumn of 1768 began designing a colliery engine, incorporating a separate condenser and air-pump, for Dr John Roebuck at Kinneil. Roebuck, having studied medicine at Edinburgh and Leiden, had initially settled in Birmingham to practise as a doctor. His interest in chemistry led to a number of discoveries in the refining of precious metals and, together with Samuel Garbett, a member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, he developed the lead chamber process of sulphuric acid manufacture which permitted large-scale production for the first time. Factories for the production of sulphuric acid were established in Birmingham as well as at Prestonpans in Scotland and, both being highly profitable, Roebuck, who was now settled in Scotland, turned his attention to the large-scale manufacture of iron at Carron. The partners in Carron ironworks were advised on a number of issues by the engineer John Smeaton. The coke-smelting process of cast-iron manufacture was employed and it was this that led Roebuck to take leases of extensive mines on the estate of the duke of Hamilton. It was in the exploitation of these coalmines that Roebuck was to overstretch himself financially. 
Roebuck was probably introduced to Watt by Dr Black. It is likely that he quickly recognized the potential that Watt's engine improvements might have for his own industrial interests, but neither he nor Watt anticipated the time that would elapse before the Watt engine was sufficiently developed for manufacture. Watt's first patent for 'A new method of lessening the consumption of steam and fuel in fire-engines' (no. 913) was obtained in January 1769. Roebuck was assigned two-thirds of the invention by Watt in consideration of meeting Watt's debts of almost $1000 (which comprised those incurred during the development of the engine plus the costs of obtaining the patent). Roebuck's financial situation was, however, precarious. Improvements to the Kinneil engine were undertaken 'in situ' under Watt's direction, but in June 1770 Roebuck was declared bankrupt and further development was postponed. 
Watt married his cousin Margaret Miller (died 1773) of Glasgow on 16 July 1764. Probably in anticipation of this, he left his rooms in the university and took up residence in the city. Needing to provide for his wife and himself, he took an office in King Street and began to undertake surveying work in the summer of 1766, while retaining the instrument-making business. In October 1766 he began a survey for a projected canal between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde, together with another surveyor, Robert Mackell. He attended parliament in connection with the 'Canal Bill', remarking: 'I think I shall not long to have anything to do with the House of Commons again -- I never saw so many wrong-headed people on all sides gathered together' (Watt to Margaret Watt, 5 April 1767, Boulton and Watt MSS). On the journey to London, in connection with the promotion of the parliamentary bill, he visited Birmingham but did not see Matthew Boulton. 
In 1769 Watt was involved in a survey of the River Clyde. He also acted as engineer for a projected canal between Monkland and Glasgow, for which he received a salary of $200 per year, as engineer to the canal, until 1772 when the undertaking faltered through lack of capital. While engaged in these projects he was concerned to improve levelling instruments. But in 1770 he was beginning to experience the tension of conflicting demands -- surveying, which was bringing in an income on the one hand, and the urging of Roebuck, his partner, to develop the engine on the other. He told the physician and natural philosopher William Small that the remainder of his time was 'taken up partly by headaches & other bad health & partly by consultation on various subjects of which I can have more than I am able to answer & people pay me pretty well' (Dickinson, 72). He was involved in 1770 in the Strathmore canal survey and in the following year he reported on improvements to the harbour of Ayr and surveyed routes for canals through the isthmuses of Crinan and Tarbet. In 1772 he undertook to survey for a water supply to his native town of Greenock. Surveys for several canals and navigations were undertaken in 1773, including a canal for coal in the Mull of Kintyre, a canal from Hurtet to Paisley, the Forth Navigation, and the Water of Leven. He also undertook a survey of Glasgow docks and harbours. 
The last and most significant civil engineering project of Watt's was a survey and estimate for a canal between Fort William and Inverness. He carried this out in 1773 and the canal -- later named the Caledonian Canal -- was to be successfully constructed in the early nineteenth century. Towards the end of 1784 Watt was approached by James McGrigor, father of his second wife, Anne, to become engineer to the project, but the proposal came to nothing and the canal was finally constructed under Thomas Telford from 1802. Telford acknowledged the quality of Watt's work: 'If I can accomplish this [drawing the utility of the scheme to public attention] I shall have done my duty: and if the project is not executed now, some future period will see it done, and I shall have the satisfaction of having followed you in promoting its success' ('Origin and Progress', 1.cxxvi). Having completed his part of the Inverness Canal project by April 1774 Watt was able to turn his mind to Birmingham. 
In 1767 Watt and his wife had a daughter, Margaret; she married James Miller in 1791 and died in June 1796 (Robinson and McKie, 227). A son, James Watt, was born in 1769; he died, unmarried, in 1848. It was on 26 September 1773, when Watt was surveying for a projected canal in the highlands, that he heard that his wife, who was expecting their third child, was dangerously ill. He started immediately for home, only to hear that the child had been stillborn and that his wife had died on 24 September. He was left a widower with two children, the elder of whom was six. In Margaret, he wrote: 'I lost the comfort of my life, a dear friend and a faithful wife' (Dickinson, 82). In 1776 he married for a second time. His new wife was Anne McGrigor (died 1832), daughter of James McGrigor, a dyer of Glasgow. Anne's father agreed to the marriage but requested that Watt show him the partnership contract between Watt and Boulton. However, no document existed and Watt feared that if he admitted this his prudence would be doubted. He therefore asked Boulton to draw one up: 'I have been obliged to allow him to suppose such a deed did exist but was simple, so what you send must pass for a duplicate'. Watt continued: 'whether a man of the world such as you look upon my present love as the folly of youth or the dotage of age -- I find myself in no humour to lay it aside'. Fearing Boulton's ability to be discreet, he chided 'you are a very bad confidant in love affairs, you look upon them as too good things to be kept to yourself' (Watt to Boulton, 3 July 1776, Boulton and Watt MSS). Five days later Watt asked Boulton to come to Glasgow for, though agreements on the marriage had been reached, 'I am afraid I shall otherwise make a very bad bargain in money matters' (Watt to Boulton, 8 July 1776, Boulton and Watt MSS). Watt and his second wife had two children: Gregory (1777-1804) and Janet 
(Jessy; 1779-1794)
; both died, unmarried, of consumption. 
On his journey to London in 1767 to attend the House of Commons committee on the 'Forth and Clyde Canal Bill', Watt had passed through Birmingham, intending to see Samuel Garbett, Roebuck's partner. On his return journey he called at Lichfield to see Dr Erasmus Darwin, to whom he revealed his invention of the separate condenser, which, with the air-pump, was the unique element of his fuel-saving improvements to the steam engine. Roebuck was sufficiently sanguine of the potential of Watt's engine to agree to become a partner and, in return for a two-thirds interest in the project, took over Watt's indebtedness to Black, undertaking to pay the cost of a patent. 
In 1768 Watt visited Boulton's Soho Manufactory in Birmingham after going to London on business in connection with his intended patent. This time he met Boulton and afterwards wrote: 'I explained to him my invention of the steam engine, and several other schemes of which my head was then full, in the success of which he expressed a friendly interest' ('Origin and Progress', 1.cxlvii). Watt would have been impressed by the scale and organization of the factory and in Boulton he met not only an able entrepreneur but also an innovator. Boulton was the first to mechanize the laps for polishing steel, he developed a shaking box for scouring button blanks (a version of which continued to be used into the twentieth century), and later he developed the first flow-production system (key elements of which were mechanized) for the manufacture of coinage and medals. Watt stayed with Boulton for two weeks and on his return to Glasgow in October 1768 suggested that Boulton be offered a one-third share in the patent, possibly with Dr Small. Watt wrote to Boulton, referring to Boulton's wish to be concerned in an engine partnership (a point made clear during Watt's recent visit to him) and setting out the situation with regard to Roebuck. 
Roebuck initially responded positively to Boulton's proposed involvement, but then recognizing the potential value of the patent proposed offering Boulton a licence to manufacture Watt's engine in the midlands only. Boulton declined, drawing attention to the need for capital, accurate workmanship, and effective control 'to keep the executive part out of the hands of the multitude of empirical engineers, who from ignorance, want of experience and want of necessary convenience, would be very liable to produce bad and inaccurate workmanship'. He added, 'It would not be worth my while to make for three counties only, but I find it very worth my while to make for all the world' (Dickinson, 54). Roebuck travelled south in September 1769 and Watt expected that a 'proper offer' would be made (Watt to Small, 20 Sept 1769, Boulton and Watt MSS), adding: 'As to the Doctor, he has been to me a most sincere generous friend and is a truly worthy man' (ibid.). Watt experienced a tension between a desire to satisfy Roebuck and himself in the successful completion of the Kinneil engine and the need to earn a living in civil engineering. 'Nothing', he wrote, 'is more contrary to my disposition than hustling and bargaining with mankind, yet that is the life I now constantly lead' (Dickinson, 72). 
The period of indecision concerning the steam engine was exacerbated by a number of bank and business failures in 1772-3. Watt reported that Roebuck was now willing to part with his share of the engine on terms which, under better trading conditions, he believed Boulton would have had no difficulty in accepting. By March 1773 Roebuck could no longer meet his financial obligations and had not paid the costs additional to the original $1000 as agreed. Watt discharged these in return for the Kinneil engine, which was dismantled and dispatched to Birmingham. 
Yet Roebuck still owned two-thirds of the patent. Boulton, however, was one of Roebuck's creditors. Rather than press for settlement, Boulton postponed negotiating for the patent until he could acquire it from the trustees of Roebuck's estate. This was achieved in August 1773. The death of Watt's first wife in September 1773, occurring in a year of small profit for Watt, and Small's subsequent urging that he go to Birmingham led Watt to decide to leave Scotland and join Boulton at Soho. He arrived in Birmingham in May 1774. 
Boulton proposed seeking a parliamentary bill to extend the term of Watt's patent and in May 1775 the act was passed, extending the patent for a further twenty-five years (15 Geo. III c.61). The partnership between Boulton and Watt commenced a month later. 
Watt recorded the terms of his partnership with Boulton at the time of his second marriage, in 1776. From this it is clear that Boulton was to bear the financial risk for the expense of the 1775 act and the costs of future experiments, and be responsible for the stock-in-trade as well as the keeping of the accounts, all in return for two-thirds of the property of the invention. Watt was to make drawings, give directions, and make surveys. 
On his arrival in Birmingham, Watt lived in Boulton's former house in New Hall Walk but in 1777 he and his family moved to Regents Place, Harpers Hill, a substantial but plain house conveniently near Soho. The Watts maintained an establishment of two maids and a manservant at Regents Place, where Watt did his drawings, correspondence, and calculations, and where his assistants also worked. However, in 1790 he commenced the building in Handsworth of Heathfield, a larger, attractive two-storey house, to the designs of Samuel Wyatt, the architect who had remodelled Boulton's Soho House. He had a garret built over the kitchen to be used as a workshop, while in the yard below there was a forge. As land became available on the heath after enclosure, Watt acquired some and continued to add to it until he owned about 40 acres. He laid out the grounds, built a walled kitchen garden, and erected hothouses and lodges. The house was demolished in the 1920s. 
At the beginning of their partnership Boulton and Watt made few engine parts. The engine workshop at Boulton's Soho Manufactory was small and there was no very clear demarcation between those people employed in Boulton's various enterprises and those employed by Boulton and Watt. Materials and parts for engines were obtained from the best rather than the nearest suppliers. Swedish iron was obtained from Birmingham merchants, tubes from Izons of West Bromwich, and piston rods, sometimes, from Jukes Coulson of Rotherhithe. But, above all, the partners depended heavily on the ironmaster John Wilkinson, for it was he who was capable of boring engine cylinders with greater accuracy than any other iron-founder. Even after other iron-founders had installed boring machines similar to those of Wilkinson, they seemed unable to produce goods of such consistent quality as his. In the early years of the Boulton and Watt partnership Wilkinson's advice was sought as well as sometimes given unsolicited. His interests were both as a manufacturer in the supply-chain and also as a customer for Boulton and Watt engines. Indeed, he was one of the largest single customers, installing eleven engines at his Bradley ironworks by the 1790s and at least seven elsewhere. The Coalbrookdale Company, too, was both an important customer and supplier of engine parts. It had been to Coalbrookdale that William Small had looked when seeking parts for the Kinneil engine before Watt had moved to Birmingham, and this company and its associates became Wilkinson's chief rival in the supply of engine parts. Even when the customer for a particular engine was as eminent an ironfounding company as the Walkers of Rotherham, Watt was cautious about permitting them to cast all their own engine parts. In general, Boulton and Watt subcontracted the manufacture of parts to firms of their own choice, most of them in the midlands region. Only piston rods seem to have been forged as far afield as Whitehaven, Workington, and Rotherhithe. 
During the 1780s and early 1790s, while continuing to depend on subcontractors for many engine parts, Boulton and Watt increased both the range of operations and the capacity of their engine workshop at Soho Manufactory and by 1793 were making over 50 per cent by value of their engine parts. The reasons for this move towards the production of complete engines may have been partly financial, the partners wishing to secure to themselves the profits of forger and founder as well as those of consulting engineer. They claimed to make no profit on the parts made by other founders and, while they probably did not add a percentage to Wilkinson's castings, Boulton was certainly of the view that the partners should receive commission on all parts made by subcontractors. The main reason, however, for extending the production of engine parts at Soho Manufactory was probably an acceptance of the considerable organizational problems with subcontracting in the late eighteenth century. The unpredictability of completion time for an engine was a major difficulty, as were problems of transporting large castings by canal. Moreover, quality control was a prime concern. While standardization was only slowly introduced by Watt to engine production during the 1780s, and while a lack of it constrained output and increased costs, this drawback was at least partly offset by ensuring that all parts were made to the tolerances demanded by Boulton and Watt. There were often advantages in subcontracting, notably the smaller capital base from which the partners were able to operate. Moreover, Watt could continue experimental work while subcontractors bore a larger proportion of manufacturing risks. For the first few years each engine manufactured was largely custom-built. Sizes were relatively standardized but improvements were incorporated as developments were made by Watt and suggestions made by employees as well as some friends and customers. 
Watt's role was largely that of development, design, and drawing, as well as working on patent specifications. He also visited customers, notably in Cornwall. The partners employed a small group of itinerant mechanics who were responsible for the erection of engines for their British customers. Skilled mechanics were in short supply and were not above exploiting their scarcity value. It was partly in order to protect the reputation of the firm that Boulton and Watt initiated a protocol of customer visits: when either of the partners or a senior employee visited an area in which they had several customers, attempts were made to inspect each engine and to offer maintenance guidance. 
For the term of the extended patent a significant contribution to Boulton and Watt profits was derived from the royalty imposed on users of the Watt engine. For reciprocating engines this was computed at one-third of the savings in fuel effected by Watt's engine in comparison with a Newcomen engine capable of performing an equivalent amount of work. Premiums on rotative engines were charged at $5 per horse power per year in the provinces and $6 in London. Towards the end of the term of their patent the partners usually commuted the annual royalty to a lump sum payable upon purchase of the engine. 
A shortage of capital inhibited Boulton in his desire to establish a separate engine factory, which had been his stated intention on first meeting Watt and conducting negotiations with him. But the discovery that Wilkinson had been pirating Watt's patent, together with the knowledge that the patent had only five and a half more years to run, and coupled with the fact that the partners had already extended their own repertory of engine parts, led to their making a quick decision in 1795 to establish a separate engine foundry. Watt seems to have played little part in the design of the foundry, which was built adjoining the Birmingham Canal near to adequate supplies of coal. It was intended that cylinders, pumps, and all other engine parts would be made there. It was also acknowledged that the partners would aim to make improvements to the engines, a task which had been more difficult while they depended on subcontracting much of the foundry work. They perceived further advantages in being able to make engines more cheaply and in a shorter time, as well as in keeping engines in stock. Thus, Soho Foundry was opened in 1796. Watt gradually withdrew from active participation in the business, and it was managed by his son, James Watt, and Matthew Robinson Boulton. The elder Watt retired in 1800. 
The engine manufacturer who could solve the problem of rotary power generation other than by means of a water-wheel in the early years of the industrial revolution was likely to reap considerable financial reward. As early as 1765-9 Watt had devised a steam wheel to generate rotary motion. Both he and, later, Boulton had in mind a hollow annular chamber mounted on a shaft, and in 1774-5 Watt laid drawings of one before a committee of the House of Commons. 
It is clear that a steam wheel was made and set to work at Soho in 1774, and a year later Boulton reported that another one was being developed. But in the early years of the partnership Watt was kept busy with reciprocating engines, and plans for rotary power were laid aside. Yet Boulton continued to draw attention to the opportunities, pointing out in 1776 that he could dispose of a hundred wheel engines, were they available. 
The opportunities were also perceived by others. Robert Cameron, an employee who later became an independent engineer, approached Boulton with an idea. Watt discouraged Boulton, and Cameron's ideas were not proceeded with. But as early as 1779 a Newcomen engine had been fitted with rotary motion at a Birmingham flour mill owned by James Pickard, who in 1780 replaced the ratchet-and-pawl mechanism with a crank patented in the same year (no. 1263). 
It has been alleged that the idea of the crank had been stolen from Watt and there is evidence to substantiate this, though Watt's stated reason for not patenting or developing rotary power at this time -- pressure of work -- was weak. It is more likely that he still needed to be persuaded of the usefulness of rotative power. However, under increasing pressure from Boulton he was persuaded to do so and, probably not wishing to contest the crank patent, developed, instead, 'sun and planet motion', which was patented in 1781 (no. 1306). The firm used this mechanism on all its rotative engines until 1794, when Pickard's patent expired, and in some cases for several years afterwards, after which time it also employed the crank, which was a far more effective way of generating rotative power. 
In 1782 Watt was granted a patent for several major improvements to his engine (no. 1321). Of greatest significance was rotative motion. Other improvements included the use of the expansive principle and the double-acting engine, as well as a means of connecting the piston rod and beam for use in double-acting engines. Of these improvements it was the double-acting engine that had potential application, fuel savings in the expansive engine being found, in practice, to be too small to warrant development. The rack-and-sector connection for the double-acting engine was superseded by parallel motion, which was patented by Watt in 1784 (no. 1432) together with various other improvements, including the application of steam engines to wheel carriages. Of all his inventions it was parallel motion that appears most to have pleased James Watt. 
Boulton and Watt were a natural target for industrial espionage. Employees talked or were bribed, and over-curious visitors would make drawings when possible. In turn the partners were vigilant in tracking down patent infringers. Friends described new engine installations around the country, while faithful employees such as William Murdock reported on anything suspicious, particularly in Cornwall. The partners sought patent protection and privileges overseas, some form of privilege being obtained in France, Spain, and the Netherlands. Discussions were also initiated regarding patents in the United States and the Austrian empire but none was granted. 
Estimates for the number of engines manufactured by Boulton and Watt for the British market during the term of their patent have varied considerably, ranging from 318 to 512. While the smaller figure is a considerable underestimate, the latter includes a number of double counts; the most likely figure is 449 engines. Demand for the Watt engine was low at first but so too was the company's capacity to produce the requisite drawings and patterns for the subcontracting of parts. Until 1783 all the engines built were reciprocating ones, but thereafter rotative engines appear in the orderbooks. These were smaller engines and up to eighteen rotative engines per year were produced before the opening of Soho Foundry. From the opening of the foundry in 1796 the number of rotative engines manufactured increased markedly, fulfilling Boulton's expectations of a rapidly increased rate of engine production. 
While some writers have alleged that no steam engine manufacturer was capable of supplying workable engines with a nominal rating of over 100 hp until the nineteenth century, when reciprocating engines are converted to a horsepower equivalent it is clear that some of the largest double-acting pumping and blowing engines were generating over 100 hp equivalent. By the end of 1800 Boulton and Watt engines totalling approximately 11,205 hp had been erected in Britain at an average size of just under 25 hp per engine. 
A large proportion of the pumping engines sold by Boulton and Watt during the first ten years or so of their partnership was supplied to the Cornish copper and tin mines. The Cornish activities of the partners are significant for several reasons: first, for the sheer scale of their operations, both in the number and size of engines supplied to the region as well as the proportion of the partners' total profit contributed by Cornish engines; and second, because Boulton and Watt became large investors in Cornish mines to enhance demand for its engines at a period when the Cornish copper industry was subject to considerable fluctuation. The demand for the Boulton and Watt engine in Cornwall was enhanced by the fact that the mines had reached a depth from which neither water engines nor the Newcomen engine could extract water adequately and consequently the mines were in danger of being flooded out. Moreover, Newcomen engines consumed greater quantities of coal than the Watt engine. Thus Cornwall provided an ideal setting for a demonstration of the considerable savings in coal that Watt's engine would effect over a Newcomen engine of comparable power. Between 1777 and 1801 forty-nine Boulton and Watt engines were erected in Cornwall. During the early 1780s the proportion of Boulton and Watt's engine business accounted for by Cornwall ranged from as low as 5 per cent to as much as 80 per cent in any one year. 
Until 1784 all the Watt engines erected on the Cornish mines were single-acting, but in that year both the double-acting pumping engine and the rotative engine were introduced to Cornwall. In all cases rotative engines were of a lower horsepower equivalent than the pumping engines. A distinguishing feature of the partners' Cornish business was the extent to which engines were moved. While engine moving was not unique to the Boulton and Watt engine (for it had been a regular occurrence with its Newcomen predecessors), in no other region were nearly as many of these engines moved. Out of the total of forty-nine recorded Boulton and Watt engines in Cornwall, only thirteen appear not to have been moved. Some engines were moved three times or more. 
A significant aspect of Boulton and Watt's marketing strategy was the identification of key innovating entrepreneurs in different industries. Some, such as Richard Arkwright, were approached by a partner intent on selling an engine. Other manufacturers approached Boulton and Watt. The result was that in a number of key industries prospective customers could be encouraged to follow a precedent already set by the larger innovators. 
The great market for rotative power was, as Boulton had anticipated, the textile industry -- in particular, cotton. While Arkwright, patentee of the water frame, was not among the first customers for Watt engines in cotton spinning (though in time he was), other leading entrepreneurs in water frame spinning provided the impetus, and with the introduction of mule spinning the number of orders escalated. The application of steam power to the wool textile industry was slower. Steam power was applied to worsted spinning relatively soon after the invention of the water frame, since a modified form of the frame could be applied to the longer filaments employed in this sector of wool textile manufacture. In woollen manufacture steam power was applied to carding and roving first, the diffusion of steam power in this sector of the wool textile industry being assisted by the early adoption of a Boulton and Watt steam engine by a leading Yorkshire innovating entrepreneur, Benjamin Gott. In both the cotton and wool textile industries a by-process of the use of steam engines was the employment of steam from the boilers to heat dying and bleaching vats. 
The application of the Watt engine to manufacturing industry was assisted in two sectors by the direct financial interest the partners took in these sectors severally or together. Among the various business enterprises run by Boulton at Soho Manufactory was the Soho Mint. Besides supplying British and overseas customers with coin, he used the mint as a laboratory for the design of a flow-production system for minting, employing steam power in several of the processes. Within a few years he was accepting orders for complete mints to be supplied to various overseas customers as well as to the Royal Mint, and the steam engines would be supplied by Boulton and Watt. An experimental corn mill, driven by steam power, was set up at Soho Manufactory and this formed the prototype for the Albion steam corn mill at Blackfriars in London, in which both Boulton and Watt, besides others, were shareholders. This, driven by two Boulton and Watt engines, was the largest steam-driven corn mill in the world at that time. It was seen by a number of British visitors and those from overseas, some of whom ordered engines for steam corn mills; on several occasions they ordered a total package -- the milling machinery to be supplied by John Rennie, the London-based engineer who had been, for a while, a Boulton and Watt employee. 
In addition to the home market, Boulton and Watt supplied engines to a number of overseas customers. The first foreign order was received as early as 1778, only three years after the partnership had commenced. Two further engines were ordered in 1779 and then there was a six-year interval before any further orders were obtained. Between 1785 and 1799 twenty-one engines were ordered, which made a total of twenty-four, comprising approximately 773 hp, at the expiry of Watt's patent, of which six engines were countermanded. The majority of the orders were from countries in western Europe: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, and Sweden. Two engines were ordered for Russia and one (later countermanded) for India. The applications ranged from sawmilling, flour milling, coalmining, land drainage, and minting to town water supply. 
One of the consequences of the extension of Watt's 1769 patent for a term of twenty-five years from 1775 was that it hindered, at least in principle, developments in steam power technology for a total of thirty-one years during a period of accelerated economic growth and technological change. While Watt was granted other patents subsequently, they all concerned refinements and additions to his basic engine principle patented in 1769. So all-embracing were the terms of his 1769 patent that almost any modification, patented or not, which was incorporated in an engine of another make and which had any contrivance that operated in lieu of a separate condenser and air-pump, could be deemed an infringement. There was an increase in the number of patents taken out for steam engines in the period covered by Watt's patent. Some may have been taken out with the intention of bypassing Watt's. Others were for improvements and modifications which, had they been made widely available, might have made significant advances to steam engine technology. For the first few years of the Boulton and Watt partnership the partners took little notice of other engine patentees, but by 1790 piracy had increased to the extent that Boulton directed a legal friend to obtain copies of drawings and specifications of all the patents for steam engines taken out since the beginning of that year. It was only after considerable deliberation that the partners decided to contest significant pirates, being prepared ultimately to pursue them to the highest British courts. While their anti-piracy campaign did not commence in earnest until the early 1790s, earlier reports of the activities of two competitors had prompted investigation and discussion of possible legal action in the 1780s. The largest single pirate was John Wilkinson, the ironmaster responsible for casting the early Watt engine cylinders. The extent of his piracy was divulged by his brother William after a quarrel. The other pirate of whom Boulton and Watt had most to fear was Jonathan Hornblower jun., who had designed a double-cylinder engine and was directing his efforts particularly towards the Cornish mine adventurers. In the face of overwhelming evidence of his piracy John Wilkinson capitulated, as did most of the other pirates. One partnership, J. C. Hornblower (elder brother of Jonathan Hornblower jun.) and J. A. Mabberley, then manufacturing engines in London, was pursued relentlessly through the courts, and it was not until 1799 that the court of king's bench upheld Watt's patent and the partners were able to collect the unpaid premiums owed to them. 
While Watt was undoubtedly a craftsman of the highest order he was also a philosopher and scientist. As an instrument maker he had a remarkable diversity of scientific interests, from building an organ and mastering the theory of harmonics from a book, to investigating new methods for the manufacture of alkali from common salt; and he nearly anticipated Henry Cavendish and Antoine Lavoisier in identifying the composition of water. He earned honours in international circles in Russia, the Netherlands, and France, and was elected to the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh. He conducted a voluminous scientific correspondence. Dr Joseph Black of Glasgow and Edinburgh universities was one of the most outstanding scientists of his day -- someone who believed that chemistry was not an art but a science which had both philosophical and utilitarian objects. Black did not inhabit an intellectual ivory tower but recognized the usefulness of his work to practical ends, acting as adviser to a number of industrial concerns. Watt corresponded extensively with him on the subject of the latent heat of steam, as well as on the development of synthetic soda manufacture, ceramics firing, mineralogy, and scientific instruments -- all intermixed with domestic details. 
Watt's relationship with Dr John Robison was, perhaps, partly influenced by the fact that both men were of similar ages. Robison had intended to have a naval career, but after having been present at the capture of Quebec, he returned to academic life. Like Black, he was close to industrialists and gave them advice on chemical or engineering matters. He was described as 'one of the greatest mathematical philosophers of his age' (Dickinson and Jenkins, 16), and he suggested to Watt that a textbook should be written for mechanics to enable them to advance in their careers: 'the running text should be intirely ['sic'] practical, containing no science, but only the results of scientific investigation' (Musson and Robinson, 183). Robison, like Black, was indefatigable in his support for Watt, searching in libraries for materials on steam engines when Watt was based in Glasgow. On Robison's death in 1805 Watt wrote: 'He was a man of the clearest head and the most science of anybody I have ever known' (Dickinson and Jenkins, 75). 
Someone else who influenced Watt was Dr James Hutton, the Scottish geologist, who had studied medicine at Edinburgh, Paris, and Leiden. In 1756 he established a sal ammoniac factory in Edinburgh and published various works on geology. In their partnership Boulton and Watt shared interests in chemistry and mineralogy as well as steam engines. To depict the engine partnership as one in which Watt provided the science and Boulton the finance and business acumen would be to stereotype both partners inappropriately. Boulton did much work on the engine in Watt's absence and conversely Watt could be decisive in financial matters. 
Besides the attraction of partnership with Boulton in Birmingham, Watt was attracted by the circle of scientifically minded friends that Boulton had gathered around him at Soho. The Lunar Society, probably the most important (though informal) provincial philosophical society, was established in 1766. Boulton, Erasmus Darwin, James Keir, and William Small met for dinner on the Monday nearest to the full moon. Watt became a member on his arrival in Birmingham and the membership eventually increased to fourteen, a number of whom were to become fellows of the Royal Society. 
While there were many literary and philosophical societies in the provinces during the early years of the industrial revolution, its informality set the Lunar Society of Birmingham apart. The conviction that conversation was a fertile source of self-improvement drew men together in clubs. The scientific interests of the members ranged broadly across the natural and physical sciences as well as engineering. In addition, many of the members shared interests in education and some had interests in the arts. Three members of the Lunar Society, including Watt, were Scotsmen and three others had been educated at Scottish universities. Watt maintained particularly close links with science in Scotland through both kinship and friendship. He began to prosper in the engine partnership with Boulton, and as his fame grew it was to his Scottish friends that he turned for help in the defence of his patents-at-law. 
Of all the interests of the Lunar Society members it was perhaps instrumentation for measurement that drew the largest number of members together. Watt, with his interest in the theory of latent heat and its practical application in steam engines, was interested in the measurement of heat and the expansive properties of steam. Linear measurement was also a subject of interest to Watt through his previous career in surveying. It was their discussions on advances in instrumentation that led to a particularly close relationship between Watt and Dr William Small. 
One of the most significant examples of the Lunar Society members' activities in support of applied research was in the field of medicine. The driving force was that of consumption. Watt's daughter Janet (Jessy) died of consumption in 1794 at the age of fifteen and his son Gregory died of the same disease in 1804. William Withering, one of the members of the Lunar Society, suffered from it, as did the wife and daughter of Richard Lovell Edgeworth, another member. Members of the society supported the proposal of Dr Thomas Beddoes for a pneumatic medical institute in 1793. It was proposed to establish a laboratory and hospital where newly discovered gases could be clinically tested to assess their curative properties, particularly in relation to consumption. But by the time the institute was opened in 1799 belief in the curative powers of gases had begun to decline and, though the plans continued, Humphry Davy being recommended by Gregory Watt as assistant for the laboratory, the direction of the focus of the institute's activities became one of preventative medicine rather than curative. James Watt had other interests in health, notably in the relief of atmospheric pollution in industrial towns. He patented a smoke-consuming furnace in 1785 which attracted the attention of leading members of the community in rapidly industrializing towns such as Liverpool. 
The large amount of correspondence occasioned by Watt's business and scientific interests and the laborious method of making handwritten copies of all important letters prompted him to invent a mechanical method of letter-copying which was patented in 1781. A gelatinous ink was used for writing, and, on completion of a letter, a sheet of damp, unsized paper was placed on the original and even pressure was applied until the ink came through. The press was employed extensively by Boulton and Watt, not only for letters but also for drawings. J. Watt & Co. was established to manufacture and sell the copying press. Watt held a 50 per cent share in the business and Boulton and James Keir 25 per cent each. A number of Lunar Society members were interested in the mechanism, including Erasmus Darwin and Joseph Priestley. The copying-press business was directed by Keir for a year or so before he left to establish an alkali manufacturing plant. J. H. Magellan was agent for continental sales of copying presses as well as steam engines. 
In 1798 Watt had purchased a property with a farmhouse at Doldowlod, near Rhayader in Radnorshire. The farmhouse was converted into a comfortable country house where he quite frequently spent the summer months. His retirement was clouded by the loss of his son Gregory in 1804, a young man who seemed 'to have all the genius of his father with a great deal of animation and ardour, which is all his own' (Dickinson and Jenkins, 73). Watt wrote 'We... cannot help feeling a terrible blank in our family' ('Origin and Progress', 2.247). 
In retirement Watt and his wife travelled a good deal. In 1802 they journeyed up the Rhine to Frankfurt and on to Strasbourg, returning to England via Paris. He visited Scotland frequently, and was particularly fond of Edinburgh. His dry humour, and the Scots accent that he never lost, made him welcome north of the border. 
A number of Watt's friends died at the turn of the century. Josiah Wedgwood had died in 1795, Black in 1799, Erasmus Darwin in 1802, and Joseph Priestley in 1804. John Robison died in 1805. But a greater loss was that of his partner, Matthew Boulton, who died in 1809 at the age of eighty-one. Watt well knew the debt he owed to Boulton: 'few men have had his abilities and still fewer have extended them as he has done' (Watt to M. R. Boulton, 23 Aug 1809, Boulton and Watt MSS). 
Watt deeply felt the loss of some of his friends from the Lunar Society. And he is said to have been haunted by the fear that his mental faculties were failing. There is much evidence to the contrary: he was consulted by the Glasgow Waterworks Company in 1811 and took pleasure in inventing as a hobby rather than a business. The problem which concerned the directors of Glasgow Waterworks was how to convey the filtered water across the River Clyde to the company's pumping station at Dalmarnock. Watt supplied a drawing for a flexible water main on the analogy of a lobster's tail. The installation was successful, and when Watt declined to accept any payment for his services the directors of the waterworks presented him with a service of silver plate. Further evidence of his continued inventive powers in his old age is the sculpturing machine copying irregularly shaped three-dimensional objects such as busts. He spent a great deal of his spare time in the garret workshop at Heathfield. By April 1809 he had made considerable progress and claimed that he could do two or more copies at once. He appears to have received much friendly assistance from William Murdock of the Soho works. Experiments continued and in 1814 he considered taking out a patent for the invention. He drafted a concise specification but does not appear to have taken the matter any further. At his death in 1819 he was still continuing to develop two machines -- a proportional sculpturing machine and an equal sculpturing machine. A baronetcy was offered to him but he declined the honour. He was also asked to be high sheriff of Staffordshire and later Radnor but declined these as well. 
In appearance Watt was somewhat above medium height, with a spare figure and a pronounced stoop of the shoulders. His eyes were grey and his hair turned white early in life. It is known that he was not an early riser and required ten hours' sleep each night. For much of his life he suffered from severe headaches; and he took snuff and smoked tobacco. In his portraits he is shown as a serious man deep in thought; he was also cautious and modest, with a tendency to be self-deprecatory. 
Watt's correspondence shows him to have been a man assailed by self-doubt, whose strengths lay in radical and elegant solutions to specific scientific and engineering problems. He was far less focused on business opportunities or wider issues. His reluctance to develop the rotative engine, for instance, cost the partners the opportunity to use the crank before the 1790s. Watt was greatly supported by his Scottish friends, though the support appeared to be one-way on occasion. He was, however, always generous in sharing scientific ideas while being an emphatic protector of his patented intellectual property. Nevertheless, his partner, Boulton, bore the financial risks of the business. As a father, he was less liberal than Boulton, though he was clearly devoted to his children, and was devastated by the deaths of Jessy and Gregory. 
Watt died at Heathfield in Handsworth, Birmingham, on 25 August 1819 and was buried beside Matthew Boulton in St Mary's Church, Handsworth, on 2 September. His wife, Anne, and son James were appointed executors of his estate. In his will he requested that he might 'be interred in the most private manner without show or parade as soon after my decease as may be proper' (Dickinson and Jenkins, 79). He left his wife $1400 p.a. and Heathfield for life, and to his son the residue of the estate which included all documents, drawings, and tools. The will was proved on 13 October for a sum in excess of $60,000. In 1824 Lord Liverpool initiated a public subscription for a memorial sculpture by Francis Chantrey in Westminster Abbey. It additionally had an inscription, written by Henry Brougham, which read: 'James Watt... enlarged the resources of his country, increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place amongst the most illustrious followers of science and the real benefactors of the world.' The coat of arms with the motto 'Ingenio et labore', borne by the Watt family and shown on many of the monuments erected to Watt's memory, was granted in 1826. 
Between 1775 and 1825 the Watt engine was adopted by many of the most eminent leaders of the manufacturing industry and canal transport. To Victorian and later writers the steam engine was almost synonymous with industrial growth and progress. Watt's near contemporary, the engineer John Farey, thus argued that the engine was the most important invention 'in the history of the arts' (Farey, 473). In his seminal essay, 'The Industrial Revolution, 1760-1830', T. S. Ashton in 1948 accorded a similar role to the engines produced by Boulton and Watt: 'The new forms of power, and no less, the new transmitting mechanisms by which this was made to do work previously done by hand and muscle, were the pivot on which industry swung into the modern age' (Ashton, 58). 
Although the exclusive nature of the 1769 patent and its extension for twenty-five years undoubtedly hindered other developments, steam power was not the most widely employed prime mover until well into the nineteenth century. The cultural impact of the Watt engine far exceeded its economic impact. Indeed, it has been estimated that the saving effected by the Watt engine by 1880 was no more than 0.11 per cent of current national income, or, to put it another way, without the engine the industrial revolution would have been held up by no more than one month. 
Watt, a modest man, would not have approved of the role in which he was cast by his son James and others from the late 1820s onwards -- namely, the inventor as hero. He was included in the hall of Scottish heroes in the Wallace monument erected near Stirling in the 1860s, and his name became a byword for Scottish ingenuity and assiduity. The Watt Institution and School of Arts in Edinburgh was in 1852 named after him; this was later amalgamated with the George Heriot Trust and subsequently became Heriot-Watt University. His life, as depicted by Samuel Smiles and later writers, became a paradigm of mechanical genius. 
Although his steam engine may not have triggered off industrialization in the manner traditionally stated, it was still of profound cultural and economic significance and has to be viewed against the backdrop of the Scottish Enlightenment. And of Watt's humanity and of his genius as an engineer there can be little doubt.

Watt, James (1769-1848), engineer and manufacturer, was born on 5 February 1769 at Glasgow, the son of the engineer James Watt (1736-1819) and his first wife and cousin, Margaret Miller, who died in 1773. The younger James had difficulties with his father and his father's second wife, Anne McGrigor (died 1832), almost from the age of six. 
Like Matthew Robinson Boulton, with whom he later took over the direction of Boulton and Watt, James Watt first went to the Revd Henry Pickering's school at Winson Green, Birmingham. In 1780 his father wrote to a schoolmaster, perhaps the Revd Deane of Shifnal, Shropshire, saying that he had received complaints about young James's 'insolence, sauciness and disobedience' (J. Watt, 5 Aug 1780, Doldowlod MSS). His father wanted him disciplined for this and for his slovenliness. Yet, at twelve years of age, Watt was reading Caesar and Virgil as well as extracting cube roots. His father wanted him to continue in writing, drawing, Latin, arithmetic, and Euclidean geometry, and to begin French and dancing. At fifteen he was then steered towards a practical education at John Wilkinson's ironworks at Bersham, near Wrexham. There, for a year, he studied bookkeeping, geometry, and algebra in his leisure-hours and spent three hours every day in the carpenter's shop. His father asked about his progress in carpentry and requested a drawing of a furnace from him. He was then sent off to France 'en route' to Geneva. 
James Watt senior insisted upon a 'punctual and regular correspondence' from his son, constantly complaining about his handwriting and telling him that 'he succeeds best who writes like a correct Speaker in common conversation' (J. Watt, letter, 13 July 1784, Doldowlod MSS). The great engineer's own letters can be compared only to 'Lord Chesterfield's Letters to his Son'. In Geneva young Watt was to study the classics, history, science, mathematics, drawing, and French. His father watched his morals and manners. He was not to curse, gossip, drink, or gamble but he was to show respect, pay his share of the reckoning, and not to read novels or frequent the theatre. He was to learn to fence. In Switzerland he was under the roof of the chemist Nicolas-Theodore de Saussure and was introduced to a number of other Swiss natural scientists, including J. A. de Luc and M. A. Pictet. 
By July 1785 Watt's father was thinking of sending him to a merchant's counting-house in Germany or to Gottingen University 'to pursue the study of usefull science' (J. Watt, letter, 17 July 1785, Doldowlod MSS). In August, at the home of one Reinhard, at Eisenach in Saxony, Watt settled down to study German, after which he might go to the miners' school at Freiburg to study 'Mechanicks mathematicks & metallurgy' (ibid.). If this plan failed, he could go on to a counting-house in Leipzig. 
Watt returned to England in 1788 and joined the firm of Taylor and Maxwell, fustian manufacturers, in Manchester. (Charles Taylor was later to become the secretary of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Commerce, and Manufactures.) His father had at last realized that the future of the steam engine lay with Lancashire rather than Cornwall. Besides learning his business and acting as an agent for steam engines, Watt quickly entered into the intellectual life of Manchester, consorting with Dr Thomas Percival, Thomas Henry and his sons, Thomas Cooper MD, Joseph Baker, Dr John Ferriar, Joseph Priestley junior, Thomas and Richard Walker, and others. With Ferriar, he became co-secretary of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society (known as the Lit. and Phil.) and submitted two papers, one on 'a Mine in which the Aerated Barytes is found' ('Memoirs', 598) and the other on the effects of 'terra ponderosa' given to animals. These were published in the 'Memoirs' of the society in 1790. He also attended lectures by Thomas Henry and Charles White at the College of Arts and Sciences. He read extracts from his translation of a work by Jacob Joseph Winterl to the Lit. and Phil. and was encouraged by James Keir to translate a work by Christoph Meiners. He assisted Keir with the article on bleaching in Keir's 'Dictionary of Chemistry' (1789), a book to which Charles Taylor contributed articles on dyeing and calico printing. Watt secured Lorenz Crell as a corresponding member of the Lit. and Phil. and gained subscribers to Crell's 'Annalen'. In these years he was close to the 'young Turks' at Boulton and Watt -- Peter Ewart, John Southern, and James Lawson -- who favoured the French Revolution. 
Through Thomas Cooper, Watt joined the Manchester Constitutional Society, which met at Thomas Walker's house. He tried to drum up a message of sympathy to Joseph Priestley after the riots in 1791. Joining the firm of Richard and Thomas Walker, he planned a sales trip to France, intending also to sell Watt copying machines. On 4 March 1792 he arrived in St Omer with Cooper, proceeded to Paris, and met Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and other leading scientific figures; but the talk was of politics not chemistry. On 22 March 1792 he wrote to his father that Cooper and he had presented an address from the Manchester Constitutional Society to the Club des Jacobins. Thomas Walker, Cooper, and he were immediately denounced in the Commons by Edmund Burke as traitors. His father wrote to Dr Joseph Black: 'My son James's conduct has given me much uneasiness, though I have nothing to accuse him of except being a violent Jacobin, that is bad enough in my eyes, who abhor democracy, as much as I do Tyranny, being in fact another sort of it. (J. Watt to Dr J. Black, 17 July 1798, Doldowlod MSS)' Watt witnessed the massacres of 10 August in France, still a revolutionary. In 1792 or 1793 he met William Wordsworth in Paris and long remained a friend. Watt may have been denounced as an English spy and forced to flee to Italy. Despite the 'Traitorous Correspondence Act' of 1793 he returned safely to England in 1794. 
From that time forward Watt became increasingly useful to Boulton and Watt. With M. R. Boulton, he investigated and prosecuted pirates of his father's patents, he promoted the copying machine, he introduced the principle of 'rationalization' into the construction of Soho foundry in 1796, he recruited founders from Wilkinson's works, and he took over the main direction of the steam-engine company. In assessing the contribution of the second generation of Boulton and Watt, a useful distinction describes the parents as 'builders' and the sons as 'organisers' (Roll, 270). Nevertheless, it is clear that Watt earned his father's respect, and was able to carve out an independent career. 
In 1817 Watt purchased Bell's steamship 'Caledonia' and, refitting her with two 14 hp Boulton and Watt engines, took her to the Netherlands and ascended the Rhine as far as Koblenz. It is claimed that this was the first steam crossing of the channel. On the way home the ship visited Antwerp and Rotterdam, returning to the Thames in the spring of 1818. As a result of this and other experiments, the manufacture of marine engines increased in his firm, culminating perhaps in HMS 'James Watt' (1853), fitted with Soho engines. Watt finished his days in grand style at Aston Hall, having become a pillar of society as well as something of a dandy. Unmarried, he died at Aston Hall, Birmingham, on 2 June 1848.

Watt, James Henry (1799-1867), line engraver, born in London, was probably the elder brother of the portrait engraver William Henry Watt ('b'. 1804). He was educated at Mensall's academy, Kentish Town, and at the age of eighteen became a pupil of the engraver Charles Heath (1785-1848). Watt engraved many beautiful vignettes for 'The Amulet', the 'Literary Souvenir', and similar productions from designs by Robert Smirke, Richard Westall, and others, as well as several plates for the official publication 'Ancient Marbles in the British Museum'. His larger works were mostly executed in pure line on copper, and include 'The Flitch of Bacon', after T. Stothard (1832), 'May Day in the Time of Queen Elizabeth', after C. R. Leslie (1836), 'Highland Drovers' Departure' and 'Courtyard in the Olden Time', both after E. Landseer, and 'Christ Blessing Little Children', after C. L. Eastlake (1859). The last named was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1859. Watt suffered ill health for a number of years, and as a consequence of that and domestic problems he was said to have been something of a recluse. He died in London on 18 May 1867.

Watt, Robert (bap. 1774, d. 1819), physician and bibliographer, was baptized on 1 May 1774 in Stewarton parish church, Stewarton, Ayrshire, the youngest of the three sons of John Watt, farmer, of Bonnyton, Ayrshire, and his wife, Jean Calderwood. Watt's early years were spent on his father's small farm. At the age of six he was sent to the local parish school, where he was an able pupil whose intellectual abilities aroused the jealousy of his contemporaries. He remained at this school until he was twelve, when he became a jobbing ploughman around the neighbourhood of his father's farm. While still in his teens he travelled to Dumfriesshire as a member of a road mending gang. While there he spent some time at Ellisland, the farm of the Scottish poet Robert Burns. Burns allowed Watt to borrow from his library, and this intellectual contact and encouragement appear to have whetted Watt's appetite for learning. 
In 1791, at the age of seventeen, Watt was apprenticed to his brother as a cabinet-maker. During his apprenticeship Watt had a chance meeting with a Glasgow University student and from him 'I received marvellous accounts of what mighty things were to be learned, what wonders to be seen, about a University; and I imbibed an unquenchable desire to follow his course' (Finlayson, 8). The following year he began to receive tuition in Latin and Greek from Duncan MacFarlane, schoolmaster in Stewarton. In 1793 Watt matriculated at Glasgow University, and in that session won a prize for Greek. In session 1794-5 he studied Greek and logic. The following session his subjects were moral and natural philosophy. In the summer of 1795 he taught in a private school in Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, following which he enrolled at Edinburgh University as a student of anatomy and divinity. He was again a prizewinner at Edinburgh, earning $10 for his essay 'Regeneration', of which Professor Andrew Hunter, professor of divinity at Edinburgh University from 1779 to 1809, remarked 'that it was not only the best essay, but the first time, under him, that a student of the first year's standing attempted so well and so deservedly' (Finlayson, 10). Watt returned to Ayrshire in 1797 and was the master of the parochial school at Symington until 1798. During that session he was enrolled again as a divinity student at Edinburgh University, winning a prize of $8 for an essay on prayer. He subsequently withdrew from his divinity studies and completed his education with a course in medicine at Glasgow University in 1798-9. 
Having acquired the licence of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 1799 Watt set up practice as a general practitioner in Paisley. On 14 September 1800 he married Marion Burns (died 1856); they had nine children. In 1802 he entered partnership with John Muir, who had been a fellow student in Edinburgh. Watt published a number of articles on medical subjects during his time in Paisley. His main contribution to the medical profession during this period, however, was as one of the founder members of the Paisley Medical Society, which held its first meeting on 19 September 1806. On 5 January 1807 he was elected a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, thereby entering the local medical elite. His medical status was raised further when he gained the MD of King's College, Aberdeen, in 1810. Thereafter he set himself up in practice as a physician in Glasgow, and he also lectured on medicine. As an adjunct to his medical lectures he established a library of some thousand books which he made available to his students. He published a catalogue of the library in 1812, which was prefaced by 'An address to medical students on the best means of prosecuting their studies'. The catalogue also notes that the library contained about a thousand theses not listed there. 
Watt was active in medical and intellectual circles in the period 1810-17. His enhanced status as a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow enabled him to hold office in that body, and he was president from 1814 to 1816. In 1814 he was a founder member of the Glasgow Medical Society and its first president. That same year he was elected physician to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, holding the post until 1817. In 1816 he became president of the Glasgow Philosophical Society. 
In 1813 Watt published a treatise on whooping cough, in which he included an epidemiological study comparing the number of deaths among children under ten in Glasgow before and after the introduction of smallpox vaccination. This was an important early study which concluded that deaths from smallpox had fallen steeply since the introduction of vaccination, but that the total number of deaths of children remained the same, measles and other diseases accounting for the deaths of vaccinated children who had not contracted smallpox. 
Watt gave up practice in 1817 through a combination of ill health and a desire to see published a work he had been undertaking since about 1799. This work was his massive bibliography, 'Bibliotheca Britannica', the aim of which was to list by author and subject the works of all authors from Britain, or the British dominions at the time. He also included what he termed 'a copious selection from the writings of the most distinguished authors of all ages and nations' (Goodall and Gibson, 45). He retired to Campvale, then a village to the south of Glasgow, later part of the city, where, assisted by his sons, the poet William Motherwell, and Alexander Whitelaw, he began to bring the work to fruition. 'Bibliotheca Britannica' was initially published in nine parts, parts 1-4 appearing from 1819 to 1820 in Glasgow, and parts 5-9 appearing between 1821 and 1824 in Edinburgh. A four volume printing of the work by Constable appeared in Edinburgh in 1824. The first two volumes consist of an alphabetical author index, in which each author's work is arranged chronologically. Volumes 3 and 4 are a subject index, again with each work arranged chronologically. Each author entry has an alphanumeric mark, which is used in the subject index, to refer the reader from the subject entry for the book to the bibliographically more complete author entry. Watt also indexed a number of leading periodicals, increasing the value of the work as a bibliographical tool. Its value is further enhanced by biographical notes on many of the authors. 
Watt saw only the first few sheets of his 'magnum opus' off the press. He died on 12 March 1819, and was buried in Glasgow Cathedral churchyard. The burial register states the cause of his death as consumption. Watt's widow received no money for the 'Bibliotheca', as the publisher went bankrupt shortly after the work was published.

Watts, Alaric Alexander (1797-1864), journalist and poet, was born in London on 16 March 1797, the youngest son of John Mosley Watts, of an old Leicestershire and Northamptonshire family, and his wife, Sarah, the daughter of Samuel Bolton, of Fair Mile, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. His parents separated, apparently in his infancy, owing to his father's disreputable conduct, and were consequently involved in a lengthy chancery suit. His mother, an able and cultivated woman, did all that she could to bring up her children and to see that they were properly educated. In 1808 Watts went to Wye College Grammar School, Kent, where his eldest brother was an assistant master and where he spent a happy year or two. When he and his brother moved in 1810 to an academy at Ashford, Kent, kept by the Revd Alexander Power, he had a more miserable time, but acquired a good knowledge of French from an emigre teacher, which stood him in good stead in later years. At the same time, a new imaginative world was opened to him when he read John Bell's 109-volume collection of 'The Poets of Great Britain' (1782), Shakespeare, Fielding, Smollett, and Goldsmith. 
After leaving the academy in 1812, Watts held a variety of posts. He was an usher in a school in Fulham, Middlesex, kept by the Revd George Crabb and then a private tutor in the family of Bartholomew Ruspini, the prince regent's dentist. In the latter employment he met George Cruikshank and Byron, among others. In 1816 he became a clerk in the office of the controller of army accounts but very soon afterwards moved to Runcorn, Cheshire, as an assistant teacher in a boys' boarding-school. When the school changed ownership he was employed as a tutor to the son of a Manchester manufacturer. With his heart set on a literary career, he was beginning to have poems published in periodicals. From January to June 1819, when he was only twenty-two years old, he edited the 'New Monthly Magazine'. At about this time he met the Revd Charles Maturin (author of 'Melmoth the Wanderer'), who asked him to superintend the production at Covent Garden in May 1819 of his tragedy, 'Fredolfo'. Although the actors included Charles Kemble and William Macready, the performance was a failure. 
On 16 September 1821, at Woburn, Bedfordshire, Watts married Priscilla Maden Wiffen (1799-1873), always known as Zillah, who belonged to a prominent Quaker family. The Society of Friends disowned her, however, upon her marriage. A son, who died in infancy, was born to them on 23 August 1822. Another son, Alaric Alfred, was born on 18 February 1825 and a daughter, Zillah, on Christmas day 1831. Alaric Alfred married Anna Maria Howitt, the elder daughter of William and Mary Howitt, in 1859. Watts had expressive and mobile features, thick, silky hair, and a sallow complexion. His occasional irritability and hot temper were liable to lead him into quarrels and litigation which sometimes had unfortunate consequences, but he found comfort in a secure domestic life. An extravagant man, he filled his places of residence with books, pictures, and 'objets d'art', many of which he had not fully paid for. 
Thanks to his association with William Jerdan, Watts regularly contributed to the 'Literary Gazette' in the early 1820s, including a series of papers (24 February - 17 March 1821), 'Lord Byron's plagiarisms', in which he juxtaposed passages from Byron with passages from other poets. 'An Austrian army awfully arrayed', a piece popular with anthologists of light verse, appeared in the 'Literary Gazette' on 23 December 1820 (826-7) in an article on alliteration and is sometimes attributed to Watts. He contributed to other periodicals, including the 'Gentleman's Magazine' and possibly 'Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine', and brought out a volume, 'Poetical Sketches', in 1822 (with further editions in 1823 and 1824). These poems, conventionally Romantic in content and form, have long been forgotten, but Lamb and Wordsworth, among others, seem to have admired them. At the end of 1822 he became the editor of the 'Leeds Intelligencer' at a salary of $300 a year. After a controversial beginning, in which he attacked the factory owners' treatment of their workers and hence lost subscribers, he eventually made the paper successful. But in 1825 he moved to Manchester, where he established the 'Manchester Courier', remaining its editor for about a year. 
Watts claimed that between 1827 and 1847 he established or assisted in establishing upwards of twenty conservative periodicals. With Charles Baldwin and Stanley Lees Giffard he founded 'The Standard', a right-wing newspaper, in 1827. From 1833 to 1841 he published and edited the 'United Services Gazette'. Although he aimed in the 'Gazette' to criticize patronage and other abuses in the armed forces, he broadly supported the 'status quo' because of his tory sympathies. 
For literary historians Watts's main achievement is his editorship and later proprietorship of two annuals, the 'Literary Souvenir' (1824-35) and its successor, the 'Cabinet of Modern Art' (1836-7). Annuals, elegantly produced volumes of selected prose, verse, and engravings on sale at Christmas, were fashionable at the time, with over sixty appearing in 1832, for example. Among the most popular were 'Forget-me-not', 'Friendship's Offering', and 'The Keepsake'. Zillah Watts, who often associated herself with her husband's work, also edited an annual, the 'New Year's Gift' (1829-36). Among the contributors to Watts's early numbers were Scott, Coleridge, Southey, Campbell, and Felicia Hemans. The engravings were mostly of pictures by minor artists, though Turner was represented, and, as a result of yearly excursions he made to Paris from 1828 to 1831, Watts was also able to include engravings of French pictures. He used work by contributors to the 'Literary Souvenir' in the 'Literary Magnet', which he owned between 1825 and 1828. In addition to his involvement in journalism he published a collection of contemporary verse, 'Fugitive Poetry' (2 vols., 1828-9). 
A feud which had developed between Watts and William Maginn and others on 'Fraser's Magazine' culminated in Watts's depiction as Alaric Attila Watts in the 'Gallery of illustrious literary characters' ('Fraser's Magazine' 11, June 1835, 652; repr. in W. Bates's edition of the 'Gallery' 1873, 161-3). Watts thought that Daniel Maclise's drawing and Maginn's accompanying description made some scurrilous imputations concerning his honour and honesty. He therefore brought an action for libel on 5 December 1835, winning damages of $150 but later claiming that the attacks helped to bring about the decline of the 'Literary Souvenir'. 
In the 1840s Watts, who had seldom been free from debt, increasingly found himself in financial difficulties, which were exacerbated by lawsuits which absorbed much of his energy over seven years. He severed all connection with the press in 1847 and was made a bankrupt in 1849 (but was discharged on 13 August 1850). In 1851, however, his 'Lyrics of the Heart' appeared, and in 1853 his biographical sketch of Turner was prefixed to 'Liber fluviorum', a volume of engravings of some of the painter's work. 
The days of Watts's multifarious literary and journalistic activities were over. In 1853 he became a clerk in the Inland Revenue office at Somerset House in London, where his son was employed in a senior position. On 7 January 1854 he was awarded a civil-list pension of $100 a year in consideration of services rendered by him to literature and art. He edited the 1857 edition of 'Men of the Time', the biographical compendium, and included a lengthy autobiographical entry. His life became comfortable and uneventful and he delighted in re-reading and annotating at leisure the poetry of Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, and Dryden. After suffering a stroke Watts died on 5 April 1864 at his home in Blenheim Crescent, Notting Hill, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery in London. He was survived by his wife.

Watts, Gilbert (d. 1657), Church of England clergyman and translator, was born, reportedly, at Rotherham, Yorkshire, the second son of Richard Watts and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Arthur Alcock of St Martin Vintry, London, and widow of Richard's cousin Thomas Scott of Barnes Hall, Ecclesfield, Yorkshire. From about 1607 Watts kept some terms at Cambridge and after moving to Lincoln College, Oxford, was allowed, on 10 October 1610, to count them towards his BA, taken on 28 January 1611. As founder's kin to Thomas Rotherham he was elected a fellow of Lincoln on 9 November 1611, proceeding MA on 7 July 1614 and BD on 10 July 1623. Watts was put out of commons for six months on 6 May 1625 for 'being sixe severall nights in the towne'; on 19 December 1629 part of a book he wrote 'redounding to the scandal and discredit of the College' was ordered to be burnt; he was 'divers times distempered in drink' and in chapel told the rector he 'spake like a mouse in a cheese' (Green, 184). 
Watts was, however, a notable scholar and 'a Master of so smooth a Pen, whether in 'Lat.' or 'English', that no Man of his time exceeded him' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2.212). His English version, published in 1640, of Bacon's 'De augmentis scientiarum' had several printings. Unfortunately a rival translation of Davila's history of the French civil wars prevented his being published. He catalogued Charles I's works (including proclamations), as groundwork for a projected book called 'Imperiale politiques' (Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 326). 
When Charles was visiting Oxford, on 1 November 1642, Watts was created DD. His rectory of Willingdale Doe, Essex, held since 1621, was sequestered some time before 9 October 1646. He petitioned the committee for plundered ministers, which on 11 August 1647 asked the county committee to certify the cause of sequestration. Watts lost his suit against the next incumbent but, having pleaded great poverty, was recommended on 26 September 1649 to be discharged without paying fees. In 1653 Lincoln gave him leave of absence because of his 'age and poverty' (Green, 185). Watts died at Eynsham, Oxfordshire, on 9 September 1657, while returning from Bath, 'where he had overcome his antient Body by too much sweating' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2.213); he was buried in Lincoln's chancel of All Saints' Church, Oxford. His will, dated 5 September that year, left Lincoln 'soe many Bookes as cost mee Threescore pounds', each fellow one book, and his brother Abraham the residue of his estate (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/270, fols. 81'r'- 'v').

Watts, Henry (1815-1884), chemist, was born in London on 20 January 1815, the son of William Watts. He went to a private school, and was articled at the age of fifteen as an architect and surveyor but, finding himself unsuited for this profession, supported himself by teaching, chiefly mathematics. He attended lectures at University College, London, and in 1841 graduated BA (London). He was a competent mathematician and a good classical scholar and also had a sound knowledge of French and German (and later of Italian and Swedish). He was also interested in botany and in the fine arts, becoming skilled in sketching plants in watercolours. 
As assistant to University College's professor of practical chemistry, George Fownes, from 1846, Watts directed students' laboratory work in the college's new Birkbeck Chemical Laboratory. After Fownes's death in 1849 he continued these duties (until 1857) under Professor Alexander William Williamson. Owing to an incurable impediment in speech he was unable to obtain a professorship, and instead devoted himself to the literature of chemistry. In 1847 he was elected fellow of the Chemical Society. The following year he was engaged by the Cavendish Society to translate and enlarge Leopold Gmelin's classical 'Handbuch der Chemie', a work which occupied much of his time until 1872, when the last of its eighteen volumes appeared. 
On 17 December 1849 Watts was elected editor of the 'Journal of the Chemical Society' and in 1860 he also became librarian to the society, holding both posts until his death. On 1 August 1854 he married Sophie, second daughter of Henri Hanhart, a grocer of Mulhouse, Alsace; the couple had eight sons and two daughters. 
In 1858 Watts brought out a revised and enlarged second edition of Thomas Graham's 'Chemistry' and he was also engaged by Longmans to prepare a new edition of Andrew Ure's 'Dictionary of Chemistry and Mineralogy'. However, he soon decided that Ure's work was so far out of date that he could not revise it satisfactorily and instead began to compile a new 'Dictionary of Chemistry and the Allied Branches of other Sciences', assisted by a team of distinguished contributors. This work in five volumes was completed in 1868, but additions were required to keep up with the rapid advances in chemistry, and three supplementary volumes were issued, in 1872, 1875, and 1879-81. Watts's 'Dictionary' contained sound summaries of the facts and theories of chemistry, and was highly commended by his contemporaries. 
With H. Bence Jones Watts brought out two editions of Fownes's 'Manual of Chemistry' between 1868 and 1872; he completed the twelfth edition in 1877. By his revisions Watts almost entirely rewrote the book. He was engaged on the thirteenth edition with W. A. Tilden at the time of his death. 
Early in 1871 the Chemical Society decided to print abstracts in its 'Journal' of all papers on chemistry appearing in full elsewhere. A committee was appointed to superintend the publication of the 'Journal' and these summaries, but when the scheme proved unworkable, the revision of the abstracts was left entirely to Watts. The abstracts in the 'Journal' may be regarded as models, and the success of this scheme must be attributed to Watts alone. 
In 1866 Watts was elected FRS; on 19 June 1876 he was granted a civil-list pension of $100 a year and in 1879 he was elected fellow of the Physical Society. He was also an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society and a life governor of University College, London. He died of heart failure on 30 June 1884 at his home, 151 King Henry's Road, Primrose Hill, South Hampstead, London, after a short illness.

Watts, Hugh (1582/3-1643), bell-founder, was born at Leicester, the second son of Francis Watts (died 1600), bell-founder, and his wife, Mary. His grandfather may have been the Hew Wat who in 1563 cast a bell for South Luffenham, Rutland. In 1600 Watts cast for Evington in Leicestershire a bell bearing for the first time his own name as founder, with the device of three bells that his father had employed. The same device had been borne by Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire bells made by a William Watts, and in 1450 by Richard Brayser of Norwich, to whom the first member of the Watts family to enter the trade may have been apprenticed. 
In 1611 Watts was admitted to the chapmans' or merchants' guild; and he probably married soon afterwards. His wife, Mary, sons Hugh (1611-1656) and Francis, and daughters Frances and Ellen survived him. In 1620-21 Watts was elected chamberlain of the borough, and in 1633-4 he became mayor of Leicester, for which he received the customary allowance of $3 6's'. 8died During his mayoralty Charles I and his queen passed through Leicester, their reception costing the city over $200. Watts accumulated considerable wealth and he lent generously to the corporation of Leicester in times of difficulty, $400 being repaid to him in the period 1637-9. He contributed again when Prince Rupert called on Leicester for money in 1641-2. 
Watts's younger son, Francis, was made free in the chapmans' guild in 1636. The Revd Philip Hackett recounted how Francis had asked his father to go to London to hear the best tenor bell, and while Hugh was there Francis wrote instructing him to return at a given hour on a set day. Francis meanwhile succeeded in casting, at the second attempt, a very fine bell, which was then hung. As his father drew within earshot of Leicester the sound of the purity and tone of this bell gladdened his heart (Nichols, 358). 
In 1876, when T. North was writing, nearly 200 of Watts's bells remained in Leicestershire, including several complete rings that were admired for the beauty of their tone -- the peal of ten bells for St Margaret's, Leicester, was said to be the finest in England (North). Many of the bells bore inscriptions -- Watts's favourite being 'J.H.S.: Nazareus: rex: Iudeorum: Fili: Dei: miserere: Mei' -- these came to be known as Watts's Nazarenes. He worked his foundry until his death in Leicester, aged sixty, in February or March 1643; he was buried in St Mary's Church, Leicester. His son Hugh inherited his bell-metal and tools, and he married Jane, daughter of Sir Thomas Burton, bt of Stockerston, Leicestershire. However, soon after 1643 the business was wound up and partly taken over by Nottingham founders.

Watts, Isaac (1674-1748), Independent minister and writer, was born on 17 July 1674 in Southampton, the eldest of the eight children of Isaac Watts (1650-1737), clothier, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Richard Tanton (Taunton), who was of Huguenot descent. In a note to an elegy on his paternal grandmother (died 1693) in 'Horae lyricae', Watts said that his grandfather Thomas Watts, commander of a ship in 1656, was drowned when the ship was blown up in the Dutch war ('Works', 7.288). Isaac Watts senior was imprisoned for nonconformity in 1674, 1678, and 1683; his son noted of the last experience, 'my father Persecuted & imprisond for Nonconformity 6 months. after that forced to leave his family & live privately in London for 2 years' ('Coincidents', appended to Hood). During this absence he sent his children at the request of the eldest a long letter of religious advice (21 May 1685, Milner, 36-44). The Independent meeting to which he belonged was organized in 1688 into the Above Bar Congregational Church; he was its secretary and deacon, and according to Thomas Gibbons, Watts's friend and first biographer, he became master of a successful boarding school (Gibbons, 1). He had begun to teach his son Latin in 1678. He wrote some religious poetry, identified as his by Gibbons and included in Milner (pp. 47-53). He lived to see the son who had imbibed his religious and educational principles in the period of persecution become the leading figure among English protestant dissenters. 
From 1680 to 1690 Watts was educated at the free grammar school in Southampton by a Church of England cleric, John Pinhorne, rector of All Saints', Southampton, and holder of other benefices. In addition to Latin Pinhorne taught the boy Greek, French, and Hebrew ('Memorable affairs in my life', appended to Hood); Watts expressed his gratitude in a Latin Pindaric ode written in 1694 and included in 'Horae lyricae' (English translation in Gibbons, 11-18). Because of his evident precocity a local doctor, John Speed, offered to send him to university; acceptance would have obliged him to conform to the Church of England, but Watts chose to remain a dissenter. From 1690 to 1694 he was a student at the dissenting academy run by Thomas Rowe in succession to Theophilus Gale. Gale's academy was based at Stoke Newington, then a village north-east of London with an established and prosperous dissenting community. Rowe moved the academy to Little Britain in the City of London a few years before Watts's arrival; it is unlikely that Watts's education was at Newington, though this is often stated. The influence of Rowe on Watts's intellectual and religious development was considerable. Watts later wrote an ode to 'the Director of my youthful Studies' subtitled 'Free philosophy': Rowe is thanked for his 'gentle influence' which '
bids our thoughts like rivers flow, 

And choose the channels where they run. 
('Horae', 'Works', 7.259)' Under his direction Watts read widely in a range of subjects including classical and modern philosophy as well as divinity, wrote Latin and English theses (some are in Gibbons, 21-58), and made abridgements of standard works such as Burgersdicius's 'Institutiones logicae' (Watts's brother Enoch gave Gibbons his manuscript volumes). He told Philip Doddridge approvingly in 1725 that 'plain easy books of Divinity [were] recommended to the pupills to be read in their own Closets on Saturdays, from the very beginning of their Studies' (DWL, MS 24.180). He also acquired the habit of interleaving books and adding comments. His interleaved and annotated copy of John Wilkins's 'Ecclesiastes' (7th edn, 1693, in DWL) provides a very useful guide to Rowe's teaching and Watts's reading in the 1690s and early 1700s. His annotations to Martin Clifford's 'Treatise of Humane Reason' were printed by Palmer ('Life... by... Johnson', appx 1). Student friends at the academy included the poet John Hughes, Samuel Say, who became a dissenting minister and successor to Edmund Calamy, and Josiah Hort, who conformed to the Church of England and became archbishop of Tuam. In December 1693, towards the end of his time with Rowe, Watts was admitted a member of the Independent church at Girdlers' Hall of which his tutor was minister (Gibbons later held the post for many years after the church had moved to Haberdashers' Hall). 
In June 1694, according to his 'Memorable affairs', Watts returned to his father's house in Southampton for two and a quarter years; here he continued reading intensively and writing regularly, both in verse and prose. This seclusion was unusual -- young dissenters trained for the ministry frequently began work straight after leaving their academies. On 9 March 1696 the minutes of the Congregational Fund Board recorded that an endeavour should be made 'that Mr. Watts do go out to the Ministry' ('Congregational Historical Society Transactions', 5, 1911-12, 139). On 15 October 1696 he went to live in Newington as tutor to Sir John Hartopp's son, also named John, to whom he later dedicated his 'Logick' (1725). He remained for six years with the Hartopps, who had inherited the house of Elisabeth Hartopp's father, the Cromwellian general Charles Fleetwood. In 'Memorable affairs' Watts noted that he began to preach on 17 July 1698 (his twenty-fourth birthday), after eight years of university studies (presumably including the period in Southampton and at the Hartopps). By February 1699 he was appointed assistant to Isaac Chauncy, minister of the Independent church which met at Mark Lane, London; his association with this church, despite his own initial reluctance, was to last for the rest of his life. The church had a famous history and membership. It was begun by Joseph Caryl following the 'Act of Uniformity' of 1662; after Caryl's death in 1673 the congregation united with that of the Independent leader John Owen. Owen was succeeded in turn by David Clarkson, Isaac Loeffs, and in 1687 by Chauncy. Many of Oliver Cromwell's wealthy descendants and connections such as the Fleetwoods and the Hartopps were members of the congregation (a full list is provided in the church book; see Crippen, 27-30). 
Chauncy proved a very unpopular minister; the church which had flourished under his predecessors was losing members, and on 15 April 1701 Chauncy resigned. The church was much exercised for several months by the problem of replacing him. Watts was considered, but his poor health was a serious obstacle. As he recorded in 'Memorable affairs', he became ill immediately after becoming Chauncy's assistant, and for long periods of time from 1699 to 1701 he was away recuperating at Southampton, Bath, and Tunbridge. On 23 November 1701 he resumed preaching; on 14 January 1702 the church members agreed to call him to the office of minister. On 8 February Watts wrote them an important letter, preserved in the church book, giving as requested an account of his principles of church discipline, in which he set out his view of the respective roles of pastor and people; on 15 February he gave them a letter of dismission from Rowe's church and recommendation to Mark Lane; on 8 March, the day of William III's death, he accepted the call, and on 18 March he was ordained. The ordination sermon was preached by his former tutor Rowe (Crippen, 31-6). 
Despite his recurrent ill health, the previously declining Mark Lane Church flourished under Watts (numbers are recorded in the church book; see Crippen, 29-30). 'Though his Stature was low, and 'his bodily Presence but weak', yet 'his Preaching was Weighty and Powerful'' (Jennings, 32). In 1704 the church moved its meeting place temporarily to Pinners' Hall, and then in 1708 to a new purpose-built meeting-house in Duke's Place, Bury Street, St Mary Axe. Details of the building plans, the funding, and the disposing of pews and places survive ('Congregational Historical Society Transactions', 3, 1907-8, 117-25). The Bury Street Church under Watts's guidance was to become an important centre of the evangelical wing of dissent in the first half of the eighteenth century; the best guide to its theological and pastoral concerns is the collection of lectures known as the Bury Street sermons, 'Faith and Practice Represented in Fifty-Four Sermons... Preached at Berry-Street 1733', by Watts, Daniel Neal, John Guyse, Samuel Price, David Jennings, and John Hubbard, which was supported by the Independent philanthropist William Coward. 
Watts was unable to manage the duties of pastor single-handed; Samuel Price (uncle of the philosopher Richard Price) became his assistant in 1703 and his co-pastor in 1713, when a complete breakdown, lasting from September 1712 to October 1716, prevented Watts from performing his public duties. He described the experience in a series of blank verse poems, 'Sickness and recovery' ('Reliquiae juveniles', no. 47). In the course of his ministerial and authorial career he was very much indebted to the services of others to enable him to work. In December 1703 he noted in 'Memorable affairs', 'after having intermitted in a great measure a method of study and pursuit of Learning, 4 years, by reason of my great indispositions... (except w: was of absolute necessity for my Constant preaching)... I took a boy to read to me and write for me, whereby my studies are much assisted'. This was his practice for the rest of his life; his last amanuensis, Joseph Parker, who used Watts's system of shorthand, remained with him for over twenty-one years. 
A succession of generous friends took Watts into their houses. In late 1702 he moved from the Hartopps at Newington to Thomas Hollis senior, the philanthropist, in the Minories, City of London; at the end of 1710 he moved to a Mr Bowes; and then about 1712 the prominent dissenting whig Sir Thomas Abney invited him for what was initially a week's stay. Watts was to spend the rest of his life in considerable comfort with the Abneys, at Lime Street in the City and at Theobalds in Hertfordshire, and then, after Sir Thomas's death (1722), at Abney Park, Stoke Newington, where he moved 'c'.1733 with Lady Abney and her two surviving daughters. They represented for him the ideal dissenting household. Watts thanked Lady Abney in the dedication to 'Divine Songs' (1715): 'It is to her unwearied Tenderness, and many kind Offices by Night and Day, in the more violent Seasons of my Indisposition, that (under God) I own my Life, and Power to write or think.' Jennings urged that 'wheresoever Dr. WATTS's Works are read, or his Name remembered, that of Abney ought not to be forgotton' (Jennings, 26). Watts acted as tutor to the children -- 'Divine Songs' and 'The Art of Reading and Writing English' (1721) were dedicated to them -- and continued whenever possible his pastoral duties, but the greater part of his time was spent on his prolific and increasingly successful literary work. 
In the first half of his literary career Watts published four verse collections: 'Horae lyricae' (in two books, 1706; much enlarged and reorganized in three books, 1709); 'Hymns and Spiritual Songs' (1707, enlarged 1709); 'Divine Songs Attempted in Easy Language, for the Use of Children' (1715); and 'The Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament' (1719). He also included some hymns in his 'Sermons on Various Subjects' (1721) and some early poems in 'Reliquiae juveniles: Miscellaneous Thoughts in Prose and Verse' (1734); a handful of poems appeared at the beginning of the posthumously published 'Remnants of Time' (1753). As part of these collections he published some very important manifestos: the enlarged preface to 'Horae' (1709); 'A short essay toward the improvement of psalmody', which followed the text of 'Hymns' (1707), but which was not republished in his lifetime; and the prefaces to 'Hymns' and 'Psalms' (the last incorporating some material from the 'Essay'). 
Watts had begun writing poetry as a child; in 1691, at seventeen, he wrote a Latin poem to his brother Enoch ('Horae', book 2) and Pindaric elegies for the deaths of his infant sisters ('Divine Songs', appx 3). A few of the poems in 'Horae' were dated 1694 and 1695, the year after he left Rowe's academy, and it was also during this period that he composed most of his hymns. Watts told Gibbons that he thought it better to send his lyric poems into the world before his hymns -- if the former were accepted then the hymns would be more likely to be so, and if not then it would be prudent to withhold the latter, 'in which, in condescension to the plainest capacities, he had purposely reduced his poetry to a lower strain' (Gibbons, 255). In the preface of 1706 to 'Horae lyricae' (that is, 'Lyric hours', so called to show that 'Poesy is not the Business of my Life') he said that the devotional poems in that collection were a small part of 200 hymns ready for public use ('Divine Songs', appx 1, 103-4). The topics of the three-book version of 'Horae', in which there is much experimentation with verse form, were 'Devotion and Piety', 'Virtue, Honour and Friendship', and 'The Memory of the Dead'; most of the poems in the last two books are addressed to friends in his dissenting circle, several of them Cromwell connections, but they also include poems in praise of John Locke, William III, and Queen Anne (in 1721 Watts added a note retracting his optimistic picture of her reign: Watts, 'Works', 7.253). 
Watts essentially regarded poetry as a divine gift which should be dedicated to God but which had been profaned. In the revised preface to 'Horae' he invoked the example of the 'Old Testament' poets and associated himself with the principles and practice of John Dennis, Abraham Cowley, Richard Blackmore, John Norris, and John Milton, arguing that the Christian preacher could find abundant aid from the poet. His hymns and psalms clearly illustrated this principle. According to Gibbons (the story originated with Watts's co-pastor Price), Watts complained about the quality of the hymns sung at the meeting at Southampton (perhaps by William Barton), and his father told him to mend the matter, which he did with great success (Gibbons, 254). His brother Enoch in a letter of March 1700 criticizing existing hymns and versions of the psalms urged him to publish his own (Milner, 176-9); the success of 'Horae' evidently encouraged him to do so. 
Watts divided his 'Hymns' into three books, the first paraphrases of biblical texts, the second on general divine subjects, and the third designed for the Lord's supper. In the preface he said that he had sunk the metaphors 'to the level of vulgar capacities', though he hoped 'not to give disgust to persons of richer sense, and nicer education' ('Works', 7.122). His work on the hymns and psalms was closely related: the 1706 edition of 'Horae' and the early editions of the 'Hymns' contained several psalms, which he moved to the collected 'Psalms' in 1719. 'Psalm 114' appeared in 'The Spectator' (no. 461, 19 August 1712). In a note to 'Sickness and recovery' (Watts, 'Works', 7.364) he explained that he had written only half by 1712-13 and after his recovery applied himself to finishing them. His version of the 'Psalms' was not intended as a translation: as the title made clear, they were 'Imitated in the Language of the 'New Testament' and applied to the Christian State and Worship'. This meant bringing David up to date, and substituting Jesus for Jehovah and Britain for Israel. One of Watts's best-known hymns, 'Jesus shall reign where'er the sun', is an imitation of 'Psalm' 72, part 2; another, 'Our God our help in ages past', is based on 'Psalm' 90: 1-5 (it was later altered by John Wesley to 'O God our help'). From 'Hymns' the best-known are 'Come let us join our cheerful songs' (1.62, based on 'Revelation' 5: 11-13) and 'When I survey the wondrous cross' (3.7). Watts was unequivocal about the value of his religious poetry and the revolution he had brought about in congregational worship: in a note dated 3 March 1720 in the seventh edition of 'Hymns' he said of his two books of hymns and psalms: 'if an Author's own Opinion may be taken, he esteems it the greatest Work that ever he has publish'd, or ever hopes to do for the Use of the Churches' (Escott, 136). 
As an educational writer Watts had an extraordinary capacity to address a very wide range of audiences, from infants and schoolchildren to students in academies and universities, while as a philosopher he engaged in a number of pressing contemporary debates. 'Every man', observed Samuel Johnson, 'acquainted with the common principles of human action will look with veneration on the writer who is at one time combating Locke, and at another making a catechism for children in their fourth year' ('Lives of the English Poets', ed. G. B. Hill, 1905, 3.308). Watts's works for children were both secular and religious. The first category included 'The Art of Reading and Writing English' (1721), cast in what was to become a favourite question-and-answer form. Religious works included the 'Catechisms' (1730), written in response to 'a multitude of requests' (letter to Samuel Say, 11 April 1728, Milner, 458) and dedicated to the parents belonging to the Bury Street congregation; this was prefaced by 'A discourse on the way of instruction by catechisms', and included a catechism for a three- or four-year-old as well as an explication of the Westminster assembly's shorter catechism for twelve- or thirteen-year-olds. Several of the short texts which composed 'Catechisms' were sold separately (Green, 738-9). A work designed for a wider audience was the substantial 'Short View of the Whole Scripture History' (1732), also cast in question-and-answer form, which was written for 'persons of younger years, and the common rank of mankind' ('Works', 4.345). 
Watts gave a great deal of thought to the principles and methods of education; his most important works on the subject for students and teachers are 'Logick: or the Right Use of Reason in the Enquiry after Truth' (1725) and its sequel, 'The Improvement of the Mind' (1741, with a second part published posthumously in 1751). These works provide helpful advice, from an evangelical perspective, on reading, writing, and interpretation, and are designed to combat dogmatism and foster the rational testing of ideas. The long-lasting success of 'Logick' as a textbook is attested by the increasing number of editions in the later eighteenth century and the first decade of the nineteenth. 'A Discourse on the Education of Children and Youth' (published posthumously in 1753) is an interesting attempt to reconcile the traditional values of the dissenting community with liberty of thought. In philosophy Watts described as 'a favourite employment of my thoughts' the relation between soul and body and the function of the sensations, appetites, and passions (preface to 'Philosophical Essays on Various Subjects', 1733; 'Works', 6.481). His most important works on these topics, in addition to the 'Philosophical Essays', are 'The Doctrine of the Passions' and 'Discourses of the Love of God, and the Use and Abuse of the Passions in Religion' (1729), and 'Self-Love and Virtue Reconciled Only by Religion' (1739). Watts objected to Locke's attack on innate ideas and supported the existence of the moral sense, provided it was regarded as 'reason exercising itself' ('Works', 6.526), but for religious reasons he strongly disapproved of Shaftesbury. His interest in the passions was closely related to his concern with the ways in which the preacher might work on them for religious ends. 
Watts's religious writings were aimed at a range of audiences, from his Bury Street congregation and other dissenting churches to protestants in general and doubting and heterodox Christians; they included sermons and other exhortatory works, defences of the political status of dissent, and explorations of Christianity's most difficult doctrines. His standing was recognized by the award of the DD in 1728 by the universities of Edinburgh and Aberdeen. As a dissenting minister he was concerned with the growing breach between the evangelical and rational wings of dissent, epitomized in the Salters' Hall debates of 1719 over the principle of demanding subscription to orthodox trinitarian doctrine; Watts voted against subscription not because his views about the Trinity were doubtfully orthodox but because he espoused the Lockian principle of freedom of religious worship (set out fully in the last work he published, 'The Rational Foundation of a Christian Church, and the Terms of Christian Communion', 1747). He was also exercised by the problem of the decay of the dissenting interest, addressed in 1730 in a provocative essay by Strickland Gough; Watts's reply, 'An Humble Attempt towards the Revival of Practical Religion among Christians' (1731), emphasized that the essence of religion as the dissenters' puritan fathers had known it lay in the proper relationship between minister and congregation. He recommended to preachers John Jennings's 'Two Discourses' (1723, for which he wrote a preface), in which the puritans are held up as models for their skill in moving the passions. Watts's ideal minister Ergates in 'The Improvement of the Mind' 'makes the nature of his subject, and the necessity of his hearers, the great rule to direct him what method he shall choose in every sermon, that he may the better enlighten, convince and persuade' ('Works', 6.336). Whereas in his view the preachers of the established church and the rational wing of dissent delivered moral essays in their pulpits, Watts in his 'Sermons on Various Subjects' (1721, 1723, 1729), 'The World to Come' (1739, 1745), and 'Evangelical Discourses' (1747) preached an experimental and affectionate religion but with a rational framework that would defend him against the charge of enthusiasm. 
In his letter to the Mark Lane Church of 8 February 1702, Watts reminded them that 'When You first called me to minister the Word of God among you, I took the freedom to acquaint you That, in the chief Doctrines of Christianity, I was of the same mind wth your former Revd Pastor Dr Jno. Owen' (Crippen, 32). In the course of his preaching career of over forty-eight years, Watts modified his position of Calvinist orthodoxy. In 'Orthodoxy and Charity United' (1745, but written twenty or thirty years earlier) he identified orthodoxy as consisting of the doctrines of the fall, sanctifying grace, the atonement, repentance of sins, justifying faith, obedience, and the resurrection, and he addressed himself to the differences between men of moderation, distancing himself from the high-flyers on either side ('Works', 2.403, 433). He knew that such a stance provoked hostility: 'a moderator must expect to be boxed on both ears' (Gibbons, 146). In a number of works, from 'The Christian Doctrine of the Trinity' (1722) to the late 'The Glory of Christ as God-Man Displayed' (1746) and the posthumously published 'The author's solemn address to the great and ever-blessed God', the last work in 'Remnants of Time' (1753), he struggled to find a way of explicating the doctrine of the Trinity that would keep him within the bounds of orthodoxy, but these attempts aroused the suspicions of the rigidly orthodox, including William Coward, and long after his death encouraged Unitarians to think erroneously that he had joined them. 
Despite his sheltered and sickly life, Watts had a wide range of friends and visitors and a large and important correspondence, among members of the established church as well as dissenters, and in New England and Germany as well as at home. He was a close friend of Elizabeth Rowe ('nee' Singer), whom he is thought to have courted unsuccessfully; she married instead the nephew of his tutor Thomas Rowe. He included an ode in 'Horae' in praise of the poems of Philomela; in turn, she wrote a commendatory poem for the 1709 edition under that name, and she left him the manuscript of her 'Devout Exercises of the Heart', which he published in 1737 with a preface treating her religious transports with some caution. He dedicated 'Reliquiae juveniles' (1734) to her Anglican friend the countess of Hertford (who refused the dedication of 'Devout Exercises'), and included some of the countess's poems under the name Eusebia (no. 63, 'Piety in a court. -- To Philomela'). 
Watts's most important dissenting friend and correspondent was Philip Doddridge, in whose Northampton academy he took great interest from its inception at Harborough onwards, and whose immensely popular 'The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul' (1745) was written at Watts's request. He was known to or corresponded with most of the principal Anglican figures in the evangelical revival, including John Wesley, George Whitefield, James Hervey, and the countess of Huntingdon, though he had doubts about aspects of Methodism. His mainstream Church of England correspondents included Thomas Secker, who had started out a dissenter, and for whom he found a place at Samuel Jones's academy at Gloucester (Milner, 232-7); Watts regularly sent him his books in later years, and as bishop of Oxford Secker thanked him for 'The Improvement of the Mind', 'which is peculiarly well adapted for the direction and improvement of students in the university, where your Logic is by no means the only piece of yours that is read with high esteem' (19 June 1741, Milner, 664-5). Watts similarly sent books to Edmund Gibson, bishop of London: his anti-deist 'The Strength and Weakness of Human Reason' (1731) chimed with Gibson's 'Second Pastoral Letter' of 1730 ('Works', 2.7-8; Milner, 490-91), and at the other end of the religious spectrum he shared Gibson's doubts about Whitefield (Milner, 638). 
Watts also played an important role in religious developments in New England. He corresponded with a number of American ministers and educators, including Cotton Mather (who disapproved of his views on the Trinity), Elisha Williams, Thomas Prince, and especially Benjamin Colman. He made gifts of forty-nine of his books to Yale, where many still survive; an appreciative reader of his 'Philosophical Essays' wrote in it, 'the man that Liketh not this Book is a Whippleswick' (Pratt, 25). In turn Mather, Colman, Prince, and others sent him copies of their sermons, many of which survive in Dr Williams's Library. Through Colman, Watts followed Whitefield's transatlantic evangelizing with some misgivings. A significant outcome of this correspondence was that Watts and John Guyse published a cautiously edited version of Jonathan Edwards's account of the beginning of the revival in New England, 'A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God' (1737), after receiving the manuscript from Colman. A similar pattern of reciprocal influence in Germany resulted from Watts's friendship with Anton Wilhelm Boehm (characterized as Bohemus in 'Reliquiae juveniles', no. 52), translator of works by the pietist A. H. Francke. Francke arranged for Watts's 'Death and Heaven' (his funeral discourses for the Hartopps) to be translated into German with a preface by J. J. Rambach; in 1736 a new English edition included this preface ('Works', 2.139). A collection that brought together the writing and interests of English, German, and New England pietists and evangelicals was 'Instructions to Ministers' (1744), which contained John Jennings's 'Discourses', with Watts's preface, Francke on preaching, translated by David Jennings, and the life of Cotton Mather, abridged by David Jennings with a recommendation by Watts. 
Though he was widely loved, Watts's later years were at times difficult: he was on bad terms with some members of his family, quarrelled with his former ministerial friend Thomas Bradbury, and became increasingly ill. He died at Abney Park on 25 November 1748 'without a struggle or a groan', as his amanuensis Joseph Parker told his brother Enoch (Gibbons, 318). He was buried on 5 December in Bunhill Fields in the City of London, attended at his request by two ministers from each of the three dissenting denominations, Independent, Presbyterian, and Baptist. He wrote his own inscription for his grave, defining himself as pastor and successor to Caryl, Owen, Clarkson, and Chauncy (Gibbons, 345). Nathaniel Neal, one of his executors, sold the copyright of his works in 1749 for $600 (Nuttall, 'Calendar', no. 1549); Watts sold that of the 'Hymns' for $10 in 1709 (Wilson, 1.300-01). He left his manuscripts to David Jennings and Doddridge; in due course they published the second part of 'The Improvement of the Mind' (1751) and included some new material in his 'Works' in six volumes (1753, following Doddridge's own death in 1751). Among subscribers to the 'Works', in addition to prominent dissenters, were Archbishop Secker, the countess of Huntingdon, and the president of New Jersey College. 
In his funeral sermon David Jennings said that 'there is no Man now living of whose Works so many have been dispersed, both at Home and Abroad, that are in such constant Use, and translated into such a Variety of Languages' (Jennings, 28). In the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries there was considerable interest in Watts's theology, with recurring disputes over his views on the Trinity and attempts to capture him for rival camps. On the evangelical side, William Cowper wrote in 1766, 'I know no greater names in Divinity than Watts and Doddridge' ('Letters and Prose Writings', ed. J. King and C. Ryskamp, 1979, 1.143). John Wesley, who in 'The Doctrine of Original Sin' (1757) defended Watts's 'The Ruin and Recovery of Mankind' (1740) against the Arian John Taylor, warned in 1788 against Watts's dangerous speculations on the glorified humanity of Christ ('Letters', ed. J. Telford, 1931, 89-90). The Unitarian Joseph Priestley published Watts's 'Historical Catechisms' (1783) with the Calvinist principles altered. The Independent Samuel Palmer was the first to attempt to clarify his views on the Trinity and the nature of his surviving manuscripts ('Life... by... Johnson', appx 3), and in 'Dr Watts No Socinian' (1813) he defended Watts from appropriation by the Unitarian Thomas Belsham. 
It was as poet and hymn-writer that Watts made his most lasting impact. In 1779, on Samuel Johnson's recommendation, 'Horae lyricae' and 'Divine Songs... for Children' appeared as volume 46 of 'Works of the English Poets', followed by the life in volume 8 of Johnson's 'Prefaces' (1781). In Watts's lifetime the success of his hymns and psalms was partly owing to the Methodists. John Wesley included a large number (with modifications) in his first hymnbook, 'A Collection of Psalms and Hymns' (1737), and Watts's hymns kept their central place in several later collections by Independents, Methodists, and Anglicans, often described as supplements to Watts. James Montgomery in the introductory essay to 'The Christian Psalmist' (1825) explained why Christians found Watts's combined collection, 'Psalms and Hymns', so powerful: they 'include and illustrate every truth of revelation, throw light upon every secret movement of the human heart' (1828 edn, xix). The sales of 'Psalms and Hymns' in the English-speaking world in the late eighteenth century and nineteenth century were phenomenal, and in the same period the 'Divine Songs', imitated and parodied in very different ways by William Blake in 'Songs of Innocence' (1789) and Lewis Carroll in 'Alice in Wonderland' (1865), reached the height of their fame. Watts's extraordinary success is in some ways paradoxical. As an early eighteenth-century Independent he belonged to an exclusive minority: '
We are a garden wall'd around, 

Chosen and made peculiar ground, 

' he wrote in Hymn 1.74 (based on the 'Song of Solomon', 4 and 5; 'Works', 7.137), and in his cool, rational approach to the psychology of religion he distrusted emotional indiscipline, yet his warm, affectionate, practical writings were a powerful impetus to the evangelical revival of the eighteenth century and continued to shape the growing evangelicalism of the nineteenth.

Watts, Sir John (c.1550-1616), merchant and privateer, was the son of Thomas Watts of Buntingford in Hertfordshire, where he was born. He married Margaret Hawes, daughter of Sir James Hawes, who was lord mayor of London from 1574 to 1575. They had eight children, four sons and four daughters. 
During his early career Watts developed extensive trading interests with Spain, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. He was a founder member of the ill-fated Spanish Company of 1577, in which he served as an assistant and chief councillor. The development of these interests was cut short by the outbreak of the war with Spain in 1585; thereafter Watts turned his attention to privateering. He had ships at sea on voyages of reprisal throughout the war years, becoming the most important merchant-promoter of privateering in England. He sent squadrons of privateers to the Caribbean in 1588, 1590, 1591, 1592, 1594, and 1597. Four of his vessels were employed on Sir Francis Drake's voyage to the West Indies in 1595. In addition he contributed six vessels to the earl of Cumberland's Caribbean venture of 1598. He was an investor in several other important expeditions, including Drake's voyages to Spain and Portugal in 1587 and 1589, James Lancaster's voyage to Pernambuco in 1595, and John Chidley's abortive voyage to the South Seas in 1589. During the armada campaign of 1588 he served as a volunteer aboard his own ship, the 'Margaret and John' of 200 tons, and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting off Calais. In 1597 he was also one of the promoters of an ambitious, but abortive, attempt to take over the Magdalen Islands at the mouth of the St Lawrence and establish English control over the walrus fishery. 
Although Watts's Caribbean venture of 1590 was linked with the relief of the English colony at Roanoke, his main interests throughout the 1580s and 1590s were focused on privateering. The renown he earned in the business is confirmed by the Spanish ambassador's description of him, in 1607, as 'the greatest Pirate that has ever been in this Kingdom' (Brown, 1.99). Though unfair, there is no doubt that Watts, and the captains he employed on his ships, were often prepared to resort to unscrupulous methods in the search for plunder. Indeed, the seizure of neutral ships or cargoes involved him in several long-running and potentially expensive suits. Nevertheless, Watts reaped a rich reward from privateering. The 1591 expedition returned with prize goods that Watts estimated to be worth $31,380, although their real value was probably nearer $40,000. Not all of his ventures were as successful as this, but Watts was one of the few promoters to make a profit from privateering. By 1603 he was a wealthy man, with capital to spare for other commercial or colonial interests. 
Despite his privateering interests, Watts never abandoned trade entirely. He became a member of the Levant Company in 1592. He was a member of the East India Company in 1600, and served as its second governor from 1601 to 1602. He also played a prominent role in the re-establishment of the Spanish Company in 1604. He became an active member of the Virginia Company of London, serving as a member of its council in 1609. In 1615 he was a founder member of the Somers Island Company. 
Commercial success enabled Watts to become a prominent figure in the City corporation of London. A freeman of the Clothworkers' Company, he was an alderman from 1594 to 1616: representing Aldersgate ward from 1594 to 1601, Tower ward from 1601 to 1605, Aldersgate from 1605 to 1606, and Langbourn from 1606 to 1616. He served as sheriff from 1596 to 1597. In the later 1590s he was involved in the collection of money in the City for the redemption of English captives in Algiers. Although caught up in the earl of Essex's attempted uprising in the City in 1601 and removed to the Tower, there is no evidence to suggest that he was a party to the conspiracy. He was knighted on 26 July 1603, shortly after the coronation of James I. He was mayor of London from 1606 to 1607, and in that capacity entertained the king to dinner on 12 June 1607. In the last year of his life he was appointed colonel of the north regiment of trained bands, following their division into four regiments. 
Watts died early in September 1616 and was buried at Ware, in Hertfordshire, on the 7th. He left the manor of Mardocks in Hertfordshire to his eldest son, John, and various bequests for the relief of the poor in his native village of Buntingford, as well as $10 to Christ's and $20 to St Thomas's hospitals in London. His son John followed him into the East India Company, becoming a 'seaman of great note' ('CSP col.', 1.97), who served in the naval expeditions to Cadiz in 1625 and the Ile de Re in 1627.
