Rossy, Thomas (d. 1397x1406), theologian and bishop of Whithorn, is first recorded in 1371 as a Scottish Franciscan, whom Pope Gregory XI ordered the chancellor of Paris to allow to study for the degree of BTh. He was already an experienced scholar and had spent seven years in England when in 1373 he lectured at Paris on the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary; his lectures survive and show him to have been possessed of considerable theological and canonistic learning. In 1375 he was appointed vicar-general of the Franciscan order in Scotland and in 1378 (by now with the degree of DTh) papal penitentiary for the English and Irish tongues. Sent as an envoy to Scotland by the Avignon pope Clement VII on 15 July 1379, he was provided to the see of Whithorn on the same day -- the only Franciscan to become a Scottish bishop. Although he was probably consecrated in 1380, he had to overcome the resistance of the prior of Glenluce (who had been elected by the Whithorn chapter), but in October 1381 he paid some of his services into the papal chamber and was secure in his see thereafter. 
Rossy became closely involved in both papal and national politics. He was an ardent advocate of the Clementist cause in the schism which began in 1378 -- no doubt this was the subject of the sermon he delivered before Robert II on 2 February 1380, as well as of other sermons which he preached at the heart of the kingdom and on the Anglo-Scottish marches. These addresses formed the basis of his highly partisan treatise on the schism, completed in the late 1380s. It was accompanied by an open letter to the English bishops, in which he offered to debate with them on the border or even, in response to a challenge reportedly made to him by an English priest, to settle the matter by single combat. No response is known to have been forthcoming. Rossy had apparently not lost his theological interests, however, for he was described as having preached at Scone on 16 August 1390, two days after the coronation of Robert III, in the character of a 'theolog solempne'. Little is known about him as a diocesan, but on 16 July 1381 he appropriated Buittle church by charter to Sweetheart Abbey, and as bishop of Whithorn he presented a long roll of petitions to Clement VII in December of the same year. He is also reported to have been at Whithorn in 1387. Back at Avignon in 1395, he was licensed to visit his diocese for three years by deputy; on 6 September 1397 he was still at Avignon. It is not known whether he returned to Scotland or when he died. His successor at Whithorn was appointed on 28 May 1406.

Ruthven, William, of that ilk, first Lord Ruthven (b. in or before 1448, d. 1528), landowner and administrator, was the only son and heir of Sir Patrick Ruthven of that ilk and his wife, a daughter of Sir Thomas Cranstoun of that ilk. He had succeeded his father as head of this important east Perthshire family by 12 July 1480, when he resigned his lands of Ruthven to his own son and heir, William. By 1484 the older William's local status had been recognized in his appointment as chamberlain of the royal lordship of Methven and as a conservator of the three-year truce with England. He was also a knight by this date. Loyal to James III in the crises of 1482 and 1488, he was created Lord Ruthven in parliament on 29 January 1488, probably as a royalist counter to the Perthshire rebel Laurence, Lord Oliphant, and to Ruthven's equally disaffected neighbour in west Angus, Andrew, second Lord Gray (died 1514). In May 1488, after a confrontation at Blackness, James III, who may have passed through Ruthven's lands on his way south from Aberdeen, surrendered Ruthven as one of four hostages to the rebels. Ruthven was ransomed for $1000, a sum for which he was pursued in 1488-9 by Lord Oliphant, who also took Ruthven's sheriffdom of Perth. 
But in 1501 Ruthven's heir, William, was sheriff of Perth, a post which Ruthven himself later occupied (after his son died at the battle of Flodden in 1513) and which involved him in much litigation, notably with the burgh of Perth. In favour with both James IV and James V, Ruthven received royal grants of the lands of Strathbraen (1500), Rait (1506), Kynnard (1512), and the barony of Innernity (1528) in Perthshire, and the land of Strathmiglo in Fife (1522). 
Ruthven's liaison with Isabel Livingston of Saltcoats (widow of Walter Lindsay of Beaufort), whom he married about July 1480, produced two sons, William and John, who were legitimated in 1480; a daughter, Isabel, was born after their marriage. Following his first wife's death Ruthven married Christian, daughter of William, third Lord Forbes. They had a son, William, the ancestor of the earls of Forth, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who married twice. Ruthven died an octogenarian in 1528. His heir was another William Ruthven, his grandson from his eldest son's second marriage.

Sempill, John, first Lord Sempill (d. 1513), landowner and administrator, was the eldest son and heir of Sir Thomas Sempill of Elliston in Renfrewshire and Elizabeth, daughter of John, first Lord Ross. Sir Thomas died at the battle of Sauchieburn (11 June 1488), fighting for James III. John retained his father's lands, but lost the sheriffdom of Renfrew to his local rivals Robert, first Lord Lyle (with whom Thomas Sempill had been at feud in 1483), John Stewart, earl of Lennox (died 1495), and Lennox's son Matthew (died 1513). These three, dissatisfied with their share of the spoils after James III's death, were among the rebels of 1489-90 and used their shrieval jurisdiction to attack the lands of former supporters of James III, including Sempill. Consequently, on 13 September 1489 Sempill received a lieutenancy as sheriff of Renfrew from James IV's regime so that he could act against the rebellious Lord Lyle and Matthew Stewart, master of Lennox. Sempill had reduced Lyle's castle of Duchal with the king's artillery by July 1489, but the 1489-90 rebellion ended in political compromise, with Lyle restored to the government, and on 16 March 1491 James IV obliged Sempill and the Lennox Stewarts to end their feud. 
However, Sempill continued to enjoy royal favour. He was styled knight on 20 June 1492, but was a lord of parliament by 1493, probably as a regional counterbalance to Lyle and the Lennox Stewarts on the crown's behalf. In 1492 he was among the ambassadors to England, and personally received $20 from Henry VII. He was given royal conveyances of Lochwinnoch (1501), Henderstoun Wester (1502), and Eliotstoun, Southannan, Glassford, Cassiltoun, and other lands (1503-5) in Renfrewshire and Ayrshire, which were confirmed by James IV in 1505-6 and 1508. By 1505 he was bailie of Cunningham, and he had a royal grant of Paidyeauch in Ayrshire on 8 June 1512. On 21 April 1504 he founded a collegiate church at Lochwinnoch. 
By 9 September 1501 Sempill was married to Margaret (died before 21 April 1504), daughter of Sir Robert Colville of Ochiltree, Ayrshire. They had three sons and two daughters, including the eldest, William, who became second Lord Sempill and before 1517 married Margaret, daughter of Hugh Montgomery, first earl of Eglintoun. John Sempill had remarried by 16 February 1506; he and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of James Crichton of Ruthvendenny, had no children. He was killed at the battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, and it seems likely that he was buried in the church he had founded at Lochwinnoch.

Seton family (per. c.1300-c.1510), nobility, had its territorial base in Lothian, where Seton and Winton, east of Edinburgh, were united with Winchburgh, on the west of the town, by William the Lion to make one knight's fee for Philip of Seton.

Margaret Seton (fl. 1347) was her grandfather's heir. The chronicler Andrew Wyntoun relates the story of Margaret Seton's forcible abduction in 1347 by Alan Wyntoun (an ancestor of his), who may have been her distant relative as the Setons held the lands of Winton; and Bower embellishes the story with the consequent complaint brought before the king's court by her relatives, in settlement of which David II offered Margaret the choice of marrying Wyntoun or having him executed. Although Margaret chose marriage, her husband took the cross not long afterwards, according to Andrew Wyntoun in response to the continuing hostility of the Seton family, and died in the Holy Land. Their son, William, bore the name of Seton, being recorded as such on a charter of 'c'.1367. According to Bower, he also went on crusade, but had returned to Scotland by 14 September 1402, when he fought at the battle of Homildon Hill, following which he was captured and imprisoned. He married Janet Fleming, elder daughter of Sir David Fleming of Biggar, with whom he had John, Alexander, and Janet. In 1408 his second son, Alexander Seton ['see under 'Seton, Alexander, first earl of Huntly (d. 1470)], married Elizabeth, the daughter and heir of Adam, lord of Gordon, from whom the earls of Huntly were descended ['see 'Gordon family]. 
John Seton had succeeded his father by 1407, serving in that year as a hostage for the return from English captivity of Archibald, fourth earl of Douglas. On 24 March 1411 he received a charter from Robert Stewart, duke of Albany, the governor of Scotland, confirming him in the baronies of Seton and Tranent, and the lands of Winchburgh. He was appointed a commissioner to treat for the release of James I, and served briefly as a hostage for the king in 1424, his estates being valued at 600 marks, although he was released from his obligation in March 1424 as one of the men exchanged for other hostages. His subsequent service in the king's council underlines the reliance placed by James I at this time on support from prominent members of the Douglas affinity. Seton was dead by 1434. His son William had been killed at the battle of Verneuil in 1424, and so he was succeeded by his grandson.

George Seton, second Lord Seton (d. 1507/8), succeeded his grandfather. He had studied at the universities of St Andrews and Paris, and undertook diplomatic duties in 1497 and 1499. In addition to his political and administrative activities, there is evidence that he engaged in trade, the Edinburgh customs returns for 1486-7 showing that he exported salt. In response to a plea for assistance from King Hans of Denmark, James IV attempted a naval expedition in 1502, for which Seton offered his ship, the 'Eagle'. The royal treasury paid him an advance of $400 to have the ship ready for sea by 8 May 1502, but work on it was still going on at Inverkeithing when the king came to check on progress on 27 May. On 9 September the lords of council censured Seton for defaulting on his commitment, and he was ordered to repay the king's outlay on the ship, amounting to $1853 13's'. 10died, and to forfeit the 'Eagle'. A final settlement, agreed on 17 September, allowed for the restoration of the ship to Seton in return for payment of $952. Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington, in his history of the Seton family, describes the second lord as well educated and an accomplished musician, and draws a flamboyant character sketch of him. He certainly employed a minstrel, whom he sent to entertain the king in 1502 during strained relations over the preparation of the 'Eagle', but Maitland none the less censures Seton for having been overly given to the pursuit of pleasure and bad company. He died between June 1507 and April 1508, and was buried in Seton church, originally parochial, but erected into a college by papal sanction granted on 22 December 1492 in response to Lord Seton's petition. By 23 April 1475 Seton had married Marion, daughter of Colin Campbell, first earl of Argyll, and they had a son, George, subsequently third Lord Seton.

Sinclair family (per. 1280-c.1500), nobility, has a particular importance because of its acquisition of the ancient Norwegian earldom of Orkney in 1379. By the time that the family lost the earldom 100 years later, many individual Sinclair branches had established themselves throughout the Orkney and Shetland islands. The ancient earldom of Caithness (conjoint with the earldom of Orkney from saga times) was not, however, given to the Sinclairs in 1379, but was none the less acquired by the last Sinclair earl in 1455; thereafter many branches of the family similarly sprang up on earldom lands throughout the north mainland of Scotland. This has resulted in the name of Sinclair being one of the most common surnames in northern Scotland and the northern isles today. 
The first Sinclairs to be recorded in Scotland were based south of Forth in Midlothian, where the lands and barony of Roslin were granted to Sir William Sinclair on 14 September 1280. Cousland, Roslin, and Pentland were named together as the baronies of the Sinclair family in 1325 but Roslin became the most important seat, and Earl Henry called himself lord of Roslin when granted his Orkney earldom title in the late fourteenth century. It was there that the family's main fortified residence was constructed above the gorge of the River North Esk. Sir William was active in political life under Alexander III and King John, and he and his sons Sir Henry Sinclair ['see under 'Sinclair, Sir William (d. 1299x1303)] and Bishop William Sinclair all supported Robert I in the wars of Scottish independence. In 1321 Sir Henry appears as royal bailiff in Caithness, a rather surprising move north which anticipates the future role which the Sinclairs were to play in the Scandinavian parts of Scotland. It may have had something to do with his marriage to Alice Fenton, a northern heiress with lands in Ross. He was predeceased by his heir,

Somerville, William, first Lord Somerville (c.1400-1456), courtier, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Somerville of Carnwath ('c'.1370- 'c'.1440), a valued servant of James I, and probably his first wife, Janet Stewart ('fl'. 1391- 'c'.1405). William was apparently knighted at the baptism of the future James II in October 1430. His estates lay in Lanarkshire, Roxburghshire, Stirlingshire, and Haddingtonshire. They were extensive enough for him to rank as one of the more important Scottish barons of the early fifteenth century and to justify his assumption of a peerage title, as first Lord Somerville, in mid-1445 (at the same time as a number of other prominent Scottish nobles). He was seldom at court during its domination by the Livingston faction, but after its fall in late 1449 he is normally found as a witness to crown charters. Following in his father's footsteps, Somerville served the crown briefly as justiciar in the early 1450s and also as one of the king's council or auditors of causes in parliament to whom legal disputes were referred. On 14 March 1452 he witnessed a charter issued by James II at Stirling, shortly after the killing of the eighth earl of Douglas. James II created Carnwath a free burgh of barony for him in 1451. No later than 1456 the conditions on which the Somervilles held Carnwath included that of presenting a pair of red stockings to the winner of a race from the east end of the town to the Cawlo Cross. The eccentric, but detailed, late seventeenth-century family account 'Memorie of the Somervilles' asserts that Somerville married Janet, daughter of Sir John Mowat of Stenhouse, 'c'.1428, though a contemporary source shows that in 1438 he was married to Elizabeth (surname unknown). The 'Memorie' also states that he died at Cowthally, his principal castle, of a surfeit of fruit on 20 August 1456; the service of his heir, however, has the date of death as 3 July 1456. He was apparently buried in the college aisle of Carnwath church, as was Janet on her death about two years later. They had three sons and two daughters.

John Somerville, second Lord Somerville (c.1430-1491), fought among the successful Scottish forces against the English at the battle of Sark on 23 October 1449. He was seldom at court after he succeeded his father, but he took part in the abduction of the young James III from Linlithgow to Edinburgh on 9 July 1466, for which he, Robert, Lord Boyd (died 1482), and others were pardoned later that year. He regularly attended parliament, served occasionally on the king's council or as an auditor of causes, like his father, and was himself a frequent litigant there. He married first Helen, daughter of Sir Adam Hepburn of Hailes, on 10 July 1446. They had probably two daughters and a son, William, who married Marjory Montgomery, sister of Hugh Montgomery, earl of Eglinton; William predeceased his father in 1491, and his sons John and Hugh succeeded as third and fourth lords Somerville. The second Lord Somerville married again in March 1456, and he and his second wife, Marion ('fl'. 1456-1506), daughter of Sir William Baillie of Lamington, had at least one son and two daughters. Somerville had one further daughter, but it is not known whether Helen or Marion was her mother. He died in November 1491 and was also buried at Carnwath. Marion outlived him and about 1496 married John Ross, first Lord Ross of Hawkhead, from whom she obtained a divorce; she was still alive in January 1506.

Sir William Soulis (d. 1320/21), was probably sympathetic to the patriotic cause, but still young when received to Edward I's peace in 1304. He was knighted by 1312. From 1306 he served in the English interest, and was rewarded in 1312 with the lands of Sir Robert Keith, but after Bannockburn and the threat of forfeiture he adhered to Robert I. It was probably he, not John as the Lanercost chronicle says, who accompanied Edward Bruce and James Douglas in a great raid into northern England in August 1314, for William had a grant of Wark in Tynedale from King Robert before 1315. Yet not until the very end of 1319 does he appear in a royal act, being sent as negotiator of the truce made in December of that year. Early in 1320, as a witness to a royal charter, he is described as butler of Scotland, and he also has that designation in the declaration of Arbroath on 6 May 1320.

Stewart, David, first earl of Strathearn and first earl of Caithness (b. in or after 1357?, d. 1386?), magnate, was the elder son of Robert II (1316-1390), son of Walter Stewart ['see under 'Stewart family (per. c.1110-c.1350)], and his second wife, Euphemia Ross (d. before 1399) ['see under 'Ross family]. His parents had received a papal dispensation allowing their marriage in 1355, and although David's date of birth is unknown, the choice of Christian name for him may indicate that he was born after his royal namesake, David II, had returned to the kingdom in 1357 following a period of captivity in England. On his father's accession to the throne in 1371 David became earl of Strathearn, a title which had been held by his father since 1357. Robert II was still styled earl of Strathearn on the day of his coronation, 27 March 1371, but had apparently resigned the earldom in favour of David by the following day. David received further formal grants of Strathearn on 3 July 1371 and 19 October 1372 which elevated the earldom into a regality. The fact that he and his younger brother, Walter Stewart, were produced in a canonically legitimate marriage, whereas the offspring of Robert II's first marriage required a retrospective legitimation in 1347, gave rise to speculation in fifteenth-century chronicles that David and Walter regarded themselves as the king's real heirs. The 'dynastic ambitions' of David and Walter would seem to have been exaggerated in order to provide a suitably dishonourable explanation of Walter's much later involvement in the assassination of his nephew James I in 1437. Any doubt over the succession had been removed by entails approved by the three estates in 1371 and 1373, which ordained that the crown should descend to the male heirs of Robert II's sons by his two marriages in order of seniority. 
Strathearn was part of a great territorial endowment in the north of the kingdom settled on David by his father after 1371. On 30 March 1371 David was given a reversionary interest in the lordship of Badenoch granted to his elder half-brother Alexander Stewart on that date. On 19 June of the same year David received a grant of the strategically vital castle and barony of Urquhart on Loch Ness, which dominated the land and water routes along the Great Glen between Inverness and Loch Linnhe, as well as a major routeway to Wester Ross and Skye. Because of his minority Urquhart was leased to Alexander, an arrangement which gave rise to considerable problems in the 1380s. On 21 March 1375 David secured a grant of the castle of Braal and various lands in Caithness following the resignation of his kinsman Alexander Ard, a grandson of David's uncle Malise, who had been earl of Strathearn and of Caithness. By 28 December 1377 David himself had been created earl palatine of Strathearn and earl of Caithness. He also obtained interests outside the central and northern highlands, most notably through his father's gift in 1381 of Lochleven Castle and the lands of Kinross. 
During the 1380s David became embroiled in a dispute with his half-brother Alexander, and presented a complaint over Alexander's continued occupation of the castle and barony of Urquhart before a general council of April 1385. But this is the last record of the young earl, who died some time between the council of April 1385 and 5 March 1390, when his daughter, Euphemia, was styled countess of Strathearn. A later addition to a manuscript of Bower's 'Scotichronicon' claimed that he died in March 1385. As David was alive in April 1385, the likelihood is that this report, if accurate, indicates a death date in March 1386. 
Overall, David seems to have played little or no part in national politics or administration in comparison with his elder half-brothers, although his early death may partly account for his relative anonymity. Events in the central highlands after his death suggest that, at the local level, he may have acted as a significant counter-weight to the influence of his half-brother Alexander, who was earl of Buchan and lord of Ross and Badenoch. 
David Stewart married a daughter of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Glen Esk and the couple had one child, Euphemia. The link to the Lindsays was twofold, since David was also Alexander Lindsay's brother-in-law. The Lindsays had a reputation as one of the great chivalric families of fourteenth-century Scotland, and David's purchase of tournament armour in 1381 might indicate that the earl shared these interests. 
David's daughter, Euphemia, was countess of Strathearn by March 1390 and in the care of her uncles Walter Stewart and David Lindsay of Glen Esk. Before 1402 she resigned the earldom of Caithness in favour of Walter (later earl of Atholl). By August 1406 she had married Patrick Graham of Dundaff, who became earl of Strathearn, but on 10 August 1413 Patrick was killed in an ambush near Crieff by Sir John Drummond of Concraig. Thereafter the title to the earldom descended to the son of Patrick and Euphemia, Malise, whose tutor was his great-uncle Atholl. On 22 July 1427, however, James I gave over to Atholl, as his political ally, the liferent of Strathearn. In compensation for the loss of his rights in Strathearn, Malise was given the title earl of Menteith, although only the portion of the earldom's lands around Aberfoyle came into his possession.

Stewart, James, earl of Buchan (1441/2?-1499/1500), magnate, was the second son of Sir James Stewart of Lorne and Joan (Beaufort), widow of James I, and was thus a half-brother of James II and half-uncle of James III. James Stewart's parents married in 1439 and he was probably born in the period 1441-2 since his younger brother Andrew seems to have been born in 1443. The marriage provoked considerable opposition within Scotland, and after Joan's death (15 July 1445) Sir James made arrangements to leave the kingdom. On 20 November 1447 and in August 1451 the younger James Stewart was included in safe conducts obtained from the English crown by his father; the latter was killed at sea by Flemish pirates some time after August 1451. 
James Stewart had returned to Scotland by 13 September 1456, when he was a member of James II's household. Although he had no place in the royal succession, he undoubtedly enjoyed a high social status in Scotland as a close kinsman of James II and James III, and his links with the royal dynasty ensured that he was an influential and sometimes disruptive figure in the politics of the Scottish kingdom for the remainder of the fifteenth century. Moreover, attempts to provide him with a territorial settlement suitable for the half-brother and half-uncle of successive kings of Scots involved him in a number of serious disputes with other members of the Scottish aristocracy. His relationship to James II and James III, combined with his kinship with the Beaufort family in England, was reflected in his later career as an active and wide-ranging diplomat in the service of the Scottish crown, employed particularly in Anglo-Scottish negotiations with Lancastrian regimes. Stewart's attachment to the Lancastrian cause in England may in fact have heavily influenced his behaviour and standing in Scotland. 
In the final years of his reign James II (who died in 1460) evidently regarded his uterine brother as a useful and trustworthy ally. On 19 April 1457 the king granted 'his dearest brother' the lands of Trabeath in Ayrshire. In 1459, although relatively young, Stewart seems to have been employed by the king as an envoy to Burgundy and the Low Countries. It may have been as reward for these activities that James II arranged his half-brother's lucrative marriage, shortly before 27 March 1459, to Margaret Ogilvy, daughter and heir of Sir Alexander Ogilvy of Auchterhouse, hereditary sheriff of Angus. The marriage brought Stewart claims to Ogilvy's extensive estates and offices, including the sheriffdoms of Angus and Banff, but also involved him in a long-running feud with his father-in-law's relatives, including David Lindsay, fifth earl of Crawford, who also claimed the sheriffdom of Angus. By 23 February 1461 Stewart was styling himself James Stewart of Auchterhouse. 
In 1469, after the fall of the regime headed by Lord Boyd which had dominated James III's minority government since 1466, Stewart began to take a more prominent role in the governance of the realm on behalf of his young nephew. He became royal chamberlain in 1469 and between April and 17 September 1470 was created earl of Buchan. On a date before 10 June 1474 he was appointed warden of the middle march and assigned a 200 merk pension for his labours in that office. Besides these duties, Buchan also acted as a royal diplomat during the 1470s. 
The governance of Buchan's nephew James III was increasingly disliked as a result of the king's clashes with his younger brothers Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany, and John Stewart, earl of Mar, who were both imprisoned on the king's orders in 1478-9. Although Albany subsequently escaped from custody and fled into exile, the young earl of Mar died in suspicious circumstances. The treatment of Albany and Mar, combined with the king's unpopular pro-English foreign policy and a general economic deterioration, undermined support for James III's kingship. Buchan and his brother John Stewart, earl of Atholl, were left as the king's closest adult male relatives inside Scotland. Their quasi-royal status may well have encouraged others to view them as figureheads for legitimate resistance to the regime. On 22 July 1482 Buchan and Atholl arrested James III at Lauder as he mustered a host to intercept an English army which was heading north with the apparent intention of supporting the exiled duke of Albany in a bid to seize the crown. They imprisoned the king in Edinburgh Castle, but he was soon released and slowly tried to recover his control of royal government. In response, Buchan became involved in another plot to capture King James, this time in conjunction with the duke of Albany. The attempt to seize the king on 2 January 1483 was unsuccessful. After the failure of the conspiracy James III, under the terms of a settlement imposed on Albany and his supporters on 19 March, forced Buchan to resign the chamberlainship and the wardenship of the middle march along with his other royal offices. In addition, it was stipulated that Buchan should live outside the realms of Scotland and England for the next three years. 
Buchan went into exile in the summer of 1483, although where he spent the next three years is unknown. He apparently returned to Scotland before 21 March 1487, and in October 1487 was involved in a serious armed confrontation in Edinburgh with Robert, Lord Lyle, and his supporters. The long-running feud may have had its origins in the persecution of Lord Lyle by Buchan in the months after Lauder Bridge, when the latter was highly influential in royal government. 
In February 1488 a new rebellion broke out against James III headed by the king's own son, Prince James (the future James IV). In contrast to his behaviour in 1482-3 Buchan remained loyal to James III, and seems to have been sent to England to seek assistance for the king about March 1488. His rapid return to a position of influence in James III's government may partly reflect his renewed usefulness to the king in conducting negotiations with the new English king, Henry VII, who was the son of Buchan's cousin Margaret Beaufort. In May 1488 the forces of James III and Prince James faced each other at Blackness. The king retreated from the stand-off, but Buchan was one of the hostages given over to the prince to ensure that James III would abide by the terms of earlier agreements. Buchan's status as a hostage meant that he did not take part in the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488, which saw the death of James III. 
The new king's government summoned Buchan on charges of treason in August 1488. Despite the fact that he received a royal remission on 9 October 1488, he was still liable for some heavy financial penalties. He was a participant in the initial stages of a plot against James IV's government, which also involved Alexander Gordon, master of Huntly, and the English crown, in the early months of 1489, but Buchan switched his allegiance when his long-standing adversary Lord Lyle joined Gordon's insurrection. 
After 1489 Buchan retained close ties with his kinsman Henry VII of England, and was involved in planning a number of improbable kidnap schemes. In 1491, for example, he and his associates had money from the English king to support their plan to deliver James IV and his brother into King Henry's hands. In September 1496 it was proposed that Buchan would kidnap the pretender to the English throne, Perkin Warbeck, who was then maintained at the Scottish court, and deliver him to Henry VII. 
Buchan probably died in 1499 and was certainly dead by 23 January 1500. His wife, Margaret Ogilvy, survived him, and their son, Alexander, succeeded to the title. Buchan also had several children in a relationship with one Margaret Murray. On 20 February 1489 one of these children, James, received letters of legitimation and became the ancestor of the earls of Traquair.

Stewart, John, first earl of Angus (d. 1331), magnate, was the son of Alexander Stewart of Bunkle, north-east Berwickshire (died in or before 1319), grandson of Alexander, the steward of Scotland, who had played a prominent part in the politics of the reign of Alexander III; his mother's name may have been Christian. John Stewart's grandfather, also John Stewart of Bunkle, was an auditor for Bruce during the Great Cause, supported Wallace's rising in 1297, and died at the battle of Falkirk in 1298. The younger John Stewart's family allegiances notwithstanding (his father was forfeited of his English lands in 1314 for adherence to Robert I), he seems to have been neither prominent nor particularly favoured until the final year of the reign of Robert I. Alexander died before the end of 1319, but it is possible that John was still a minor at that time, since he makes almost no appearance in the record of Robert I's reign. (One act, dated 1315, was witnessed by a John Stewart, but this may well have been a different man.) 
The promotion which Stewart came to enjoy in the late 1320s was presumably the result of his close kinship with Walter Stewart, King Robert's son-in-law. Indeed, following Walter's death in 1327, leaving an infant heir, John was the senior member of the Stewart lineage. On 24 October 1328 a papal dispensation licensed his marriage to Margaret (died 'c'.1370), daughter of Alexander Abernethy, who was a considerable heiress, with estates centred on Abernethy, Perthshire, on the south side of the Tay. (The date of the marriage may also be evidence of his youth.) Stewart was styled merely lord of Bunkle in the dispensation, and his name is conspicuously absent from the list of signatories to the treaty of Edinburgh of 17 March 1328. A charter of June 1329, however, gives him the title of earl of Angus. The earldom had been in the hands of the Umfravilles since the middle of the previous century, and although the family had been resolutely pro-English for most of the Anglo-Scottish war, it seems that it was not until the last year of his reign that Robert I eventually forfeited the earldom, granting it to John Stewart. He was knighted by David II (again perhaps a sign of only recently having gained his majority) at the king's coronation on 24 November 1331, but died of an unknown cause two weeks later, on 9 December. 
Stewart left a son, 
Angus seems to have been less favoured on the return of King David in 1357. Only once thereafter, in 1360, does he appear as a witness to a royal act, and it may be that his imprisonment in 1361 was the culmination of a period in which the king had been suspicious of him. He was accused of involvement in the murder of Katherine Mortimer, the king's mistress, as well as 'disturbances and damaging actions perpetrated by him against the community' (Bower, 7.318-21), and imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle, where he died of plague the following year. 
Angus and his wife, Margaret, had two daughters, Margaret and Elizabeth, who were his coheirs. Margaret married Thomas, earl of Mar, and after his death in 1377 became the mistress of William Douglas, first earl of Douglas, to whom she bore a son, George. Since Douglas's wife was Margaret's sister-in-law, the relationship was technically incestuous. Elizabeth resigned her rights in her father's inheritance to Margaret in 1379, so leaving the way clear for Margaret to transfer the earldom of Angus to George ten years later. A woman of strong personality, Margaret is recorded as defying attempts made in the king's name to dislodge her from Tantallon Castle, Haddingtonshire, in 1388. She may have lived until 1418.

Thomas Stewart, second earl of Angus (c.1330-1362), who succeeded to the earldom as a very young child. That the petition for the dispensation for his marriage to Margaret, daughter of William Sinclair of Roslin, was seconded by the king of France in 1353 had been taken as evidence that he may have spent at least part of his youth in France. It should be noted, though, that he begins to appear in Scottish record some three years earlier, a fact attributable to his close kinship to Robert Stewart, the king's lieutenant; indeed, he was Robert's closest kinsman except for David II himself. He was a witness to various 'acta' between 1350 and 1357, and in 1354 was described as lieutenant in Angus and the Mearns. According to Walter Bower, in November 1355 he was the prime mover in the seaborne attack on Berwick which briefly captured the town from the English. Chamberlain for nearly two years from June 1356, he was also named in October 1357 as one of the high-ranking hostages offered to the English king as surety for the payment of the ransom for David II's release from captivity.

John Stewart (d. c.1469), remained in France and succeeded his father as seigneur d'Aubigny. He and his descendants were to be unusually successful in retaining grants obtained from the French crown, perhaps partly due to the determination of the elder John Stewart's widow, Elizabeth, but also to the standing Stewart had achieved in France. The younger John Stewart, who in 1446 married Beatrice Apchier, daughter of Berault, seigneur d'Apchier, like his father was a soldier in French royal armies, and was created a knight of Louis XI's order of St Michel. His son, Berault Stuart [Bernard Stewart], would in turn establish a formidable international military reputation at the turn of the fifteenth century.

Strathbogie, David, styled tenth earl of Atholl (d. 1326), magnate and soldier, was the son and heir of John of Strathbogie, ninth earl of Atholl (c.1260-1306), and Marjory, daughter of Donald, sixth earl of Mar (d. in or after 1297). He was the nephew of Robert Bruce, whose first wife, Isabel, was Marjory's sister. Earl John was executed in 1306 for supporting Bruce; the earldom was granted by Edward I to his son-in-law, Ralph de Monthermer, who was at that time earl of Gloucester. However, the young Strathbogie, who was married to Joan, the daughter of the John Comyn of Badenoch slain by Bruce in 1306, recovered his patrimony, for 10,000 marks, when he submitted to Edward in May 1307. He was then involved in the hunt for his uncle, reputedly hiding on the west coast of Scotland, from the English base at Ayr. His good service was noted by Edward II in 1308, contrary to Barbour's assertion that Atholl remained in King Robert's service. By Christmas 1307 he had left Ayr to join his wife's relative the earl of Buchan and Sir John Mowbray, as they prepared to meet Bruce's army in the north-east. This eventually resulted in the defeat of Buchan's force at Inverurie in the spring of 1308; the Comyns were now effectively expelled from Scotland for good. 
In 1311 Atholl was sent to relieve the English garrison holding Robert's own castle of Loch Doon, which was under pressure from the Scots. He then moved up to Dundee. In 1312 he went to Roxburgh on Edward II's affairs, but may have made overtures to his uncle. While in August that year he attended a parliament in London, three months later he was present at another parliament in Inverness, witnessing the confirmation of the Scottish-Norwegian treaty. King Robert's acceptance of his nephew extended so far as to make Atholl constable of Scotland in place of one of his most loyal supporters, Sir Gilbert Hay of Erroll. The earl initially repaid this trust and played a distinguished part in the capture of Perth. According to Barbour, though, Atholl fell out badly with the king's brother Edward, who allegedly seduced the earl's sister, Isabel, but refused to marry her. If so, Atholl exacted a very full revenge, attacking the Scottish store at Cambuskenneth immediately before Bannockburn, and killing its commander, Sir William Airth. He thus became the first Scottish earl to be forfeited since the twelfth century; the lands of the earldom were given to Sir Neil Campbell, who married the king's sister Mary on her release from English prison later that year. Malcolm, earl of Lennox, and Sir Adam Gordon (died 1328) also benefited from Atholl's defection, as did Sir Gilbert Hay, who was restored to the constableship. 
Back in England, Sir David Strathbogie was 'rewarded' with three manors in Norfolk; he also regained the castle of Chilham, Kent, which had belonged to his father, in 1321 for his good service on the borders. He moved higher in Edward II's service in 1325, when he was sent on a mission to Aquitaine. On his return he was given his wife's share of the inheritance of her uncle Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke. Strathbogie died about 28 December 1326, predeceased by his wife, Joan Comyn, before 24 July 1326. Their eldest son, David, succeeded as the exiled earl of Atholl. The couple had another three children, Aymer, Isabella, and Maria. 


As one of the 'disinherited' Strathbogie played a key role, with Sir Henry de Beaumont, in Edward III's seizure of power in 1330 from Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. He was thus part of the young king's inner circle. Though his claims in Scotland were not officially recognized by the English government, he was allowed to pay court to Edward Balliol when the latter arrived in England in 1331, and he took part in Balliol's invasion of Scotland in 1332. He and Beaumont effectively acted as Edward III's agents with Balliol, particularly in the matter of the transfer of the counties of southern Scotland to the English king agreed in 1333 and enacted on 12 June 1334. Strathbogie was well rewarded by Balliol for his constant service, receiving Robert Stewart's lands and office. However, relations between the disinherited leaders and the Scottish king disintegrated during Balliol's parliament of February 1334 over the claim of Sir Alexander Moubray to the inheritance of his brother Philip. The quarrel came to an end only when Moubray deserted Balliol. 
Having made great efforts to win over Stewart's men in the west, Strathbogie then went north to claim his inheritance there. John Randolph, earl of Moray, pursued him into Lochaber and eventually forced him and his men to swear allegiance to David II. That done, Strathbogie was allowed to serve as King David's lieutenant in the north, which office he performed faithfully; but a dispute arose over the control of former Comyn lands, and Strathbogie, by winning over the young Robert Stewart, caused so much dissension between Stewart and Randolph (both of whom were guardians) that a parliament in April 1335 achieved nothing. With the arrival of an English army at Perth in August Strathbogie changed sides again, still retaining his office of lieutenant. In October Balliol appointed him guardian of Scotland north of the Forth, and he acted in that office with growing ruthlessness, in his determination to root out the supporters of David II. His siege of Kildrummy Castle in Mar, held by Christian Bruce, attracted the attention of her husband, the new guardian, Sir Andrew Murray. Murray brought a force north to relieve the castle, and Strathbogie moved into the forest of Culblean to meet him. A surprise attack from the rear on 30 November 1335 brought victory to Murray, and Strathbogie was killed, fighting to the end. Strathbogie married Katherine, daughter of Sir Henry de Beaumont. She was left stranded in Lochindorb after her husband's death, but defended herself successfully against the Scots until 1336 when Edward III himself brought an English force to her rescue. She died in 1368. The couple had one son, David, who was aged three at his father's death.

David Strathbogie, styled eleventh earl of Atholl (1309-1335), was born on 1 February 1309 and baptized in the church of St Nicholas in Newcastle. Edward III allowed him entry to his inheritance in July 1327, when only eighteen, and he took part in the Weardale campaign of that year. He had considerable estates in England, as well as a claim to the Scottish earldom of Atholl and half of the lands of his maternal grandfather, John Comyn of Badenoch. In 1330 he was also granted the castle and manor of Odogh in Ireland, inherited from his great-uncle Aymer de Valence.

Sutherland family (per. c.1200-c.1510), nobility, were descended from Hugh Freskin, who obtained the lands of Sutherland from William the Lion in 1196. Nineteenth-century scholarship, probably misled by the researches of Sir Robert Gordon (completed in 1630, published in 1813 as 'A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland') seriously confused the identities and numbers of the earls. Hugh's son William succeeded his father as lord of Sutherland, after 1214, and was created earl of Sutherland at some point between 1223 and 1245. He is said to have died in 1248. William's son, also William, had been infeft as second earl of Sutherland by 1263. He attended the convention at Birgham on 14 March 1290, and in July 1291 was nominated by Edward I to receive fealties to the English king at Inverness. Later he appears to have been actively hostile to the claims of Robert Bruce, possibly preferring the Balliol claim and regarding Bruce as a usurper, and he maintained this position until his death some time between April 1306 and September 1307.

Kenneth Sutherland, fourth earl of Sutherland (d. 1333), was styled earl on 7 December 1330, when he granted a writ to Reginald Moray of Culbin, renouncing all claim to Moray's possessions within the earldom of Sutherland. This agreement formed part of a formal alliance between the two families, which was sealed by the marriage of Reginald Moray's son, Gilbert, to Sutherland's daughter, Eustachia. After the death of Thomas Randolph, regent of Scotland, in 1332, Sutherland may have become active in opposing the following year's English invasion, for he was killed at the battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. He was married to Lady Mary, daughter of Donald, sixth earl of Mar.

John Sutherland, eighth earl of Sutherland (d. 1508), was accused by Sir Robert Gordon, in his history of the family, of using his mother and relatives with great cruelty. He seems to have suffered from a form of mental illness, and in 1494 a brieve of idiotry was issued by James IV, which resulted in a declaration of Sutherland's inability to manage his affairs. He was placed under the tutelage of Sir James Dunbar of Cumnock, and died in 1508, when he was succeeded by his son John, who was to suffer from the same mental affliction. John was the son of the first of the eighth earl's three marriages; his mother may have been the daughter of Alexander Macdonald, lord of the Isles. There were no children of the eighth earl's two later marriages, to Fingole, widow of John Munro of Foulis (which probably ended in divorce), and to Catherine (surname unknown), who outlived him.

Whitelaw, Archibald (1415/16-1498), ecclesiastic and administrator, was born in the second decade of the fifteenth century: in a supplication to the papacy of 5 July 1475 he described himself as in his sixtieth year of age. He entered the University of St Andrews in the 1430s and emerged as a licentiate in arts in 1439; having subsequently reappeared in Cologne as a teacher -- an influential one, for among his students was Duncan Bunch, later vice-chancellor of Glasgow University -- he returned to teach at his alma mater in the 1450s. Whitelaw's presence on the faculty of arts at St Andrews in the early 1450s may have provided him with the opportunity to come to the notice of James II, whose eldest son, the future James III, was born in St Andrews Castle (late May 1452). By 1459 Whitelaw was certainly in royal service, employed as a diplomat, to conclude a treaty with Richard, duke of York, and as tutor to the heir to the throne. 
Whitelaw's blossoming career continued apace after James II's early death (3 August 1460). Under the regency government of the king's widow, Mary of Gueldres, he was clerk register during 1461-2, and by August 1462 he was already acting as royal secretary, a post which he was to retain for an astonishing thirty-one years. During that time he was regular in attending council meetings and in witnessing royal charters. He also carried on his work as a diplomat, and in 1474 was one of the commissioners who negotiated a treaty with England. Not surprisingly, from the late 1460s onwards he held important ecclesiastical livings: the archdeaconry of Moray (1463-7), the archdeaconry of Lothian (1470-98), and the subdeanery of Glasgow (1482-98). 
Whitelaw was one of fifteenth-century Scotland's most notable humanists, and the surviving evidence reveals many facets of his classical scholarship -- as a teacher at Cologne and St Andrews; as the collector of a fine library, including volumes by Lucan, Horace, Appianus, Sallust, Asconius, and Albertus Magnus; perhaps above all as the senior diplomat on the Scottish embassy to meet Richard III at Nottingham in September 1484, when Whitelaw delivered an elegant Latin oration at the outset of negotiations for an Anglo-Scottish truce. This 'Oratio', which praises Richard III for his martial exploits in spite of his small stature, is liberally endowed with cleverly phrased references to Cicero, Statius, Virgil, Seneca, Sallust, and Livy, and has long been admired as the work of a Christian humanist. Behind the elegant rhetoric, however, lies the tough diplomatic message that the beleaguered English king needed peace more than the Scots; and, as Dunbar and Berwick were still in English hands, there may be an implied rebuke to King Richard in the statement that every prince should be content within the bounds of his own kingdom. 
Whitelaw resigned from the secretaryship shortly before Christmas 1493, when he was already in his late seventies. In his time he had been the survivor of more political crises than any other royal servant, remaining in office both when James III was placed under constraint by his subjects in 1482-3 and after that king was overthrown in 1488. He had served three kings, and he may eventually have found the rude transition from James III's static kingship in Edinburgh to the young James IV's hectic itineraries, embracing sea voyages to Dunstaffnage and pilgrimages to Whithorn and Tain, too much for him. He died, possibly at Glasgow, on 23 October 1498. 
Whitelaw's reputation as a classical scholar and diplomat is secure, though it would probably be going much too far, on the strength of the 1484 'Oratio' alone, to suggest that he was the forerunner of those sixteenth-century writers, beginning with John Mair in 1521, who preached the virtues of Anglo-Scottish union. As a politician and a person, he remains something of an enigma. His tuition of the young James III does not seem to have made him a close familiar of the adult king; nor, so far as is known, did he exercise the influence over the king as royal secretary that Patrick Paniter was to achieve with James IV. Whitelaw was, perhaps, essentially the indispensable civil servant, at home with any administration. In any event he appears to have failed to pass on the secrets of effective royal government to his pupil James III.

Newlands, John Alexander Reina (1837-1898), chemist, was born on 26 November 1837 in Southwark, London, the second son of the Revd William Newlands, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Mary Sarah Reina. His early education came chiefly from his father. In 1856 he enrolled at the Royal College of Chemistry and studied for a year under A. W. von Hofmann, before becoming assistant chemist to J. T. Way at the Royal Agricultural Society. He energetically supported various social reforms in England, and in 1860 he spent several months with British volunteers fighting for Garibaldi in the Risorgimento (his mother was of Italian descent). 
On 1 June 1862 Newlands married Jane Rickings, daughter of James Rickings, a farmer. From 1864 he was a consulting analytical chemist in London; he also taught at St Saviour's Grammar School, the School of Medicine for Women, and the City of London College. In 1868 he became chief chemist in a sugar refinery at the Victoria docks, owned by James Duncan, with whom he devised and patented several technical improvements. The business eventually declined, and in 1886 he returned to private practice, in partnership with his brother Benjamin ['see below']. The connection with sugar continued, as the brothers, with C. G. W. Lock, published 'Sugar: a Handbook for Planters and Refiners' (1888), based on an earlier work by Lock and others. 
Despite his marginal position in the academic world, Newlands earned a place in chemical history by his partial anticipation of D. I. Mendeleyev's periodic law, developed in several papers in the 'Chemical News' between 1863 and 1866, and republished in his 'On the Discovery of the Periodic Law' (1884). Though unaware of A. E. Beguyer de Chancourtois's general classification of the elements, Newlands knew that J. B. Dumas had identified 'families' of similar elements and noted numerical relationships among their atomic weights. On listing all the known elements in order of ascending atomic weight, Newlands noticed that elements with similar properties occurred at regular intervals. In 1864 he asserted that 'the eighth element starting from a given one is a kind of repetition of the first, like the eighth note of an octave in music' ('Chemical News', 20 Aug 1864, 94), and in 1865 he formalized this relationship as the 'law of octaves'. His proposal met with opposition and even ridicule -- G. C. Foster suggested ironically that he should arrange the elements in alphabetical order -- and the Chemical Society refused to publish his ideas in its 'Journal'. Newlands's tables did contain errors and anomalies, but after 1869, when more accurate and comprehensive studies by Mendeleyev and J. Lothar Meyer began to appear, he argued for recognition of his priority. When the Royal Society awarded Mendeleyev and Lother Meyer its Davy medal for the discovery of the periodic law, Newlands renewed his campaign; he eventually received the Davy medal in 1887, but was never elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Newlands died on 29 July 1898 at his home, 1 Mildenhall Road, Lower Clapton, London, survived by his wife, daughter, and a son. 

Benjamin Edward Reina Newlands (1842-1912), chemist, was born on 23 January 1842 in Southwark, the son of William Newlands and Mary Sarah Reina. He was the younger brother and business partner of John Alexander Reina Newlands. Like his elder brother he studied at the Royal College of Chemistry, and also worked under J. T. Way at the Royal Agricultural Society. From 1863 he was chemist to J. Gibbs & Co., leaving to join his brother at Duncans in 1873. He was a council member of the Society of Chemical Industry, and he published a paper on the manufacture of aluminium sulphate from bauxite in its 'Journal' in 1882. He was married, and had a daughter, Mary. After his brother's death he continued with their chemical consultancy business for a number of years. He died of Bright's disease at Summerville, Eastoke, Hayling Island, Hampshire, on 7 August 1912.

Prince, Mary (b. c.1788), freed slave, was born at Brackish Pond, Devonshire parish, Bermuda. She was the daughter of slaves: her mother was a house-servant, her father, named Prince, was a sawyer. Mary (or Molly) Prince was the first black British woman to 'walk away' from slavery, claim her freedom, and chronicle her experiences. Her narrative, entitled 'The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave', was published in London in 1831. The book catalogues Mary Prince's struggle to survive in Bermuda, Turks Island, Antigua, and finally in England. 
Sold in front of her mother and siblings at the age of ten, Mary Prince was passed around a succession of sadistic masters, beginning with Captain and Mrs I --. On Turks Island she worked up to her waist in salt ponds all day, plagued by boils; she endured sexual abuse at the whim of another master, Mr D --. She returned to Bermuda in 1810 and then was sold at her own request to Mr and Mrs John Wood. They ill-treated her in Bermuda, Antigua, and London, but perversely refused to sell her or to allow her to purchase her own freedom. She was converted to Moravianism in Antigua, where she also married a free black carpenter, Daniel James, about December 1826. She remained in slavery in Antigua until the Woods took her to England in 1828. 
Slavery was outlawed in Britain (although not her colonies) by this time, and in London, Mary Prince decided not to endure the cruelty of the Woods any longer, and walked quietly to freedom. She made her way to the headquarters of the Anti-Slavery Society, and ended up working for Mary and Thomas Pringle. Thomas Pringle was secretary of the society, and it was he who submitted her unsuccessful petition to parliament to be emancipated in 1829. (Formal manumission was essential if a former slave wished to return to the West Indies without reverting to slavery.) Effectively trapped in England, Mary Prince narrated her experiences as a slave to Susannah Moodie, a sister of the historian Agnes Strickland; this was published as 'The History of Mary Prince' (1831). Edited by Thomas Pringle, it ran to three editions in the first year, later editions additionally containing testimonials on her behalf and an appendix describing 'the marks of former ill-usage on Mary Prince's body'. 
The 'History' was highly controversial: an attack by the pro-slavery editor, James MacQueen, of 'Blackwood's Magazine' (November 1831) led Pringle to sue the publisher, Thomas Cadell, and the Woods to counter-sue Pringle. On both occasions Mary Prince appeared in court to give evidence. The 'History of Mary Prince' became a valuable document in the struggle for the abolition of slavery; the fate of its author remains unknown. After 1833 Mary Prince disappears from the record, and it is not known whether she died or succeeded in rejoining her husband in Antigua.

Hapgood, Edris Albert (1908-1973), footballer, was born on 24 September 1908 at 4 Clark's Buildings, Union Road, Bristol, the ninth of the ten children of Henry Charles Hapgood (1869-1939) and his wife, Emily Clark (1870-1945). Both parents were from humble west country families. For some fifteen years Henry Hapgood had worked in Wales as a miner, before returning to Bristol shortly before the birth of Edris Albert. 
Eddie Hapgood was educated at the Emmanuel and (later) Hannah More schools in Bristol. From the age of fourteen he worked as a milkman at his brother-in-law's dairy, playing football in local leagues. Rejected by Bristol Rovers, in 1926 he joined Kettering Town of the southern league, at that time a 'nursery' club for Arsenal Football Club. The following season he signed for Arsenal, a club which, under the managership of Herbert Chapman, was emerging as a leading force in English football. Arsenal's success in the 1930s, which brought five league championships and three cup final appearances, was based on Chapman's strategy of sound defence and rapid counter-attack. Hapgood, as left full-back, played a key role in this system. Of average height and medium build, a non-smoker and teetotaller, he relied upon exceptional speed, precision in the tackle, excellent positional sense, and, despite his height, outstanding heading ability. He always strove for a high level of physical fitness, encouraged by Arsenal's advanced training methods. In the Arsenal defensive formation the full-backs provided cover for the 'stopper' centre-half, and in this role Hapgood shaped a new style of full-back play which contrasted with the crude physical methods employed by many full-backs of his day. His technique was to manoeuvre his opponent away from dangerous positions, dispossess with a well-timed tackle or interception, and set up an attack with a shrewdly placed, often short, pass. He rarely used the shoulder charge. His method was acknowledged by his most redoubtable opponent, the Stoke City and England right-winger Stanley Matthews, whose threat Hapgood contained more effectively than most: '[Hapgood] could give and take a pass; a classic player, one of the first footballing full-backs' (Miller, 35). His method became the benchmark by which future generations of full-backs set their standard. 
Hapgood possessed a strong self-belief which shaped both his domestic and professional life. On 16 November 1929 he married the twenty-year-old Margaret Ada (Mig), daughter of William Henry Althorpe, a works foreman, whom he had met in Kettering. They established a comfortable middle-class home in Finchley, where they brought up four children, to whom Hapgood was devoted. Encouraged by Mig's concern for financial security, he capitalized on his fame, supplementing his footballer's maximum wage by advertising chocolate bars and gentlemen's fashions. Socially he rarely mixed with fellow footballers. Chapman had perceived leadership qualities in him from an early stage, and made him captain of Arsenal in 1930, the season in which the club won its first league championship. He retained the post after Chapman's death in 1934, despite cool relations with the new manager, George Allison. 
In 1933 Hapgood was selected for England and in November 1934 the Football Association (FA) appointed him captain of the national team. In his sportsmanship, moral probity, and dignified demeanour he exhibited much of the old amateur ethos still favoured by the FA. His first game as captain was the 'battle of Highbury', an ill-tempered match against the world champions, Italy, which tested his strength of character. A broken nose forced his temporary withdrawal from the field but, in the era before substitutions, he returned to lead his team to victory. He remained England's captain throughout the 1930s, and played thirty times. Stanley Rous, the secretary of the FA, wrote: 'When talking to those who join the ranks of the professionals -- an honourable calling -- I always stress that they should strive to behave on and off the field as a model on which young players can mould their play and conduct. That Eddie Hapgood has done. (Hapgood, 8)' None the less, he was a man of principle, not given to subservience. In the politically sensitive match against Germany in Munich in 1938, when the FA was prevailed upon by the Foreign Office to require the England players, as a mark of goodwill to Germany, to give the Nazi salute before the kick-off, Hapgood expressed his opposition on the grounds that English teams should not be expected to participate in local political customs. Overruled, he consoled himself with his team's crushing 6-3 win. 
Though Hapgood continued to play in club, international, and services football during the war, when the league resumed in 1946-7 he felt he had reached retirement age. In any event, Arsenal's failure to pay the full long-service benefit he considered was owed to him led to his leaving the club. At a time of limited career prospects for professional footballers he moved into club management, first with Blackburn Rovers, then (after a brief resumption as a player with Shrewsbury Town) with Watford and Bath City. Each club enjoyed some success under his leadership but his achievements as a manager fell far below his success as a player. He refused to comply with some of the established practices at his clubs and he made enemies, especially among directors. His leaving of Bath City in 1956, amid acrimony and litigation, marked the end of his managerial career. 
In 1944 Hapgood published his memoirs, 'Football Ambassador', which sold well and went into a second edition in 1951. However, without independent means or a job in middle age he took employment as warden of a YMCA hostel for apprentices at the atomic energy research establishment, Harwell. He was deeply grateful to the organization for this post, but nevertheless considered it less than his due, and resented being unable to continue in football. He enjoyed excellent health throughout his life but at the age of sixty developed heart trouble which forced an early retirement to Leamington Spa. He suffered a fatal heart attack while attending a sports forum at Honiley Hall, Warwickshire, on 20 April 1973.

Broom, Christina (1862-1939), photographer, was born on 28 December 1862 at 8 King's Road, Chelsea, seventh of the eight children of Alexander Livingston (1812-1875), a master bootmaker, and his wife, Margaret, 'nee' Fair (1826-1884). Both parents were Scottish, her father from Muiravonside, Stirling, and her mother from Edinburgh. Christina was always small, but a sturdy, independent child who enjoyed family holidays at Margate, in Kent, and went to school there, boarding at Miss Searle's Claremont Academy. She excelled in swimming, rifle-shooting, and angling and enjoyed the open air and especially fishing all her life. Margate became a second home, and she joined both Margate and the Dolphins fishing clubs. 
On 15 August 1889 Christina Livingston married Albert Edward Broom (1864-1912), who worked in the family ironmongery business at Brompton. They lived with his parents in Cheyne Row, Chelsea, and when Winifred, their only child, was born they moved to Napier Avenue, in Fulham. Albert's sport was cricket and he became captain of Battersea Cricket club. In 1896 he was hit by a cricket ball and suffered serious disablement. At about the same time the family business failed and Albert and Christina invested in a stationery and toy shop in Streatham; Albert's trade card described him as an 'accountant and auditor, specialising in laundry accounts'. By 1903, however, the shop had failed to thrive. 
Completely untrained, Christina Broom borrowed a small box camera and experimented. Her first photograph was of the prince and princess of Wales opening the Holborn to Tooting tramway. Then came a portrait of the Derby winner Rock Sand and local street views. In the contemporary craze for postcards these sold well, so she progressed to a larger, secondhand camera, moved her family to Burnfoot Avenue, and began to photograph in earnest. The gas-lit coal cellar became her darkroom; Winifred left school in order to help, mass orders were encouraged, and Christina once printed 1000 postcards overnight. Albert did the neat labelling on the early cards, but his condition worsened and in 1912 he died. Mother and daughter moved again -- to 92 Munster Road, Fulham, their final home -- and set to work again. Christina became known professionally as Mrs Albert Broom. 
While producing postcards Mrs Broom had become an established press photographer, though necessarily of a static kind. In 1904, while getting to know her camera, she had photographed the Scots Guards' sports in Chelsea and had sent copies to their colonel. He approved of these, and from 1904 to 1939, unusually for a woman, Christina Broom became official photographer to the household brigade, with a darkroom in Chelsea barracks. She sold the prints to the soldiers at 2died each, which included an envelope for writing home, and this led Lord Roberts, then commander of the Irish Guards, to pronounce that she had increased recruitment, which had diminished after the South African War, and that she should take official army portraits. This she did, mainly of traditional hierarchical groups but also of less formal, off-duty moments. In one, for example, three privates lounge and smoke, while in others soldiers are saying farewell to families before embarkation. From 1904 to 1930 Mrs Broom ran a stall in the royal mews. Although forbidden to do so she attempted to photograph Edward VII's charger Kildare being trained. Reprimanded, she sent in her card to the king; he recognized her name and commanded that she be allowed to take and sell pictures of royal postillions, coachmen, coaches, and the stables. Sadly, unfortunate criticism by her of a customer ended the enterprise. 
Because she lived near the Thames, Christina Broom also became the regular photographer of the annual Oxford and Cambridge boat race. Her most memorable pictures, however, are probably those of the women's suffrage movement taken between 1908 and 1913, which comprise a virtually unique record of the less flamboyant moments of their campaign. These include photographs of Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst, and Louisa Garrett Anderson in the Women's Sunday procession and meeting in Hyde Park on 21 June 1908, in which a quarter of a million women took part, and of Christabel Pankhurst at the International Suffragette Fair, 1912 (both Museum of London collection). 
At an earlier date Mrs Broom had become acquainted with Ernest Brooks, an official photographer to the royal family at Windsor. In 1920 Brooks was disgraced for publishing unsuitable pictures of the young prince of Wales in a 'crossing the line' ceremony but he sold Christina many of his negatives, mainly royal portraits; it is not always evident, therefore, whose negatives she used in producing prints. Brooks also introduced her to David Wilson (1873-1935), a cartoonist, from whom she commissioned political lampoons of subjects that included tariff reform and the Russo-Japanese War, as well as political personalities. These she had reproduced by lithography and contact print and sold as postcards. 
Christina Broom continued to flourish throughout the 1920s and 1930s, publishing, for example, in the 'Illustrated London News', 'The Tatler', 'The Sphere', and 'Country Life', and covering most important London events. During the late 1930s she became chronically ill, and on 5 June 1939 she died, at home in Fulham, after a fishing trip at her beloved Margate; she was buried on 9 June in Fulham old cemetery. Considering her tiny stature and the heavy equipment that she and her daughter, her only assistant, had to manage, the consistently high quality of her work is remarkable. In the early 1960s Winifred Broom gave most of her collection of her mother's work to the Imperial War Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Museum of London. Collections of Mrs Broom's glass negatives are held at Maidstone Art Gallery, Kent, the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, and the Royal Maritime Museum, Greenwich. Collections of her prints are also held at the Guards Museum, London; the Gernsheim Collection, University of Texas at Austin, Texas; the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Local Studies Library; the Hammersmith and Fulham Archive; the National Army Museum; and the Imperial War Museum, London.

Edis, (Mary) Olive (1876-1955), photographer, was born on 3 September 1876 at 22 Wimpole Street, London, the home of her parents, Mary, 'nee' Murray (1853-1931), from Aberdeen, and Arthur Wellesley Edis FRCP (1840-1893), obstetrician and gynaecologist. In 1880 her twin sisters, Emmeline and Katherine, were born, and these three girls completed the family. Olive went to Baker Street high school, London; the Cliff boarding-school, Eastbourne; and King's College, London. However, when she was seventeen her father died unexpectedly and she had to earn her own living. Her aunt Caroline, daughter of Surgeon-General John Murray (1809-1898), a well-known photographer in India, had already given her a camera and she had photographed Caroline successfully. It was, as she wrote on the back 'My very first attempt at a portrait which turned my fate in 1900' (print, NPG). 
Self-taught and determined, Olive made a studio at the top of 34 Colville Terrace, Notting Hill, a large flat on three floors to which she, her mother, and her sisters had moved. By 1905 she also had, with Katherine, a smaller studio -- again with living space -- in Church Street, Sheringham, a popular middle-class seaside resort in Norfolk. Other studios appeared briefly, in Cromer and in Farnham, Surrey, but Sheringham and Colville Terrace were Olive Edis's work places for almost all her working life, and long after Katherine's marriage and departure in 1907. In Sheringham she started with local postcard views but soon turned to portraits, both studio and 'at home', of local and visiting celebrities, and also of the photogenic but notoriously camera-shy Norfolk fishermen. This latter achievement highlights her persuasive persistence, but sometimes she overpainted the images with oils. In London she took mainly portraits, pursuing well-known people to sit for her. She commuted regularly between the two studios in her tiny car, burdened with heavy glass plates and often with punctures. In Sheringham two local women assisted with processing. 
By 1912 Olive Edis had become one of the first women to use autochromes (introduced in 1907), responding sensitively to their rich colours and inventing her own viewer. She won a medal with an autochrome, 'Portrait Study', at the Royal Photographic Society's 1913 exhibition, became a fellow of the society the next year, and exhibited regularly for many years. In 1918 the Imperial War Museum commissioned her to record war work by the British women's services in France and Flanders. As the only official woman photographer, and with a specially designed uniform, she travelled 2000 wintry miles in March 1919, testing her stamina, ingenuity, and three cameras to the limit, and brought back unique and poignant pictures. Many are still in the museum's collection with the diary that she kept. One shows six WAACs at Etaples in 1919, tending rows of war graves bearing temporary numbered wooden crosses, a bleak, snow-covered and wooded hill in the background. In 1920 she was commissioned to make 'colour plates... of the Rockies' for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and she extended her travels to visit Washington, DC, and to learn to film. The commissioned photographs were exhibited in London later, but sadly none has been traced. 
On 27 June 1928 Olive married Edwin Henry Galsworthy, solicitor, a cousin of the writer John Galsworthy. Now she became known as Olive Edis-Galsworthy, and Edwin moved into the Colville Terrace flat. After her mother's death Olive and her husband moved to 32 Ladbroke Square. She gave up the Church Street studio in Sheringham and moved to South Street, where she built a replica studio in the garden, although after her marriage she carried out fewer commissions. Following her husband's death in 1948 she annotated some of her best portraits and presented them to the National Portrait Gallery. She also made a scrapbook 'to hold some autographs and some notes of interesting days' (Edis, MS scrapbook, priv. coll.). Her exhibition in Cambridge in February 1920 included a representative sample of her work: portraits of six members of the royal family, various generals, bishops, university dignitaries, politicians, and titled people that were reasonably flattering and reassuringly conventional representations. Her style, with or without colour, showed great naturalism and changed very little over the years; her favourite medium was the 10 inch by 8 inch platinotype, with its velvety, deep-brown effect, used with natural light wherever possible. 
Olive Edis-Galsworthy died on 28 December 1955 at her Ladbroke Square flat. She was cremated at Golders Green on 2 January 1956 and her ashes interred in the Weybourne Road cemetery, Sheringham, beside her husband, on 5 January.

Wilding, Dorothy Frances Edith (1893-1976), photographer, was born on 10 January 1893 at 5 Westfield Terrace, Longford, Gloucestershire, the youngest of nine children of Richard Wilding, a commercial traveller, and his second wife, Mary Martha Edwards ('b'. 1866). She was sent to live, aged four, with her childless aunt and uncle Thomas and Fanny Hayter in Cheltenham. Extrovert in character, her early ambitions were to be an actress or a painter. 
Through an early interest in picture postcards Wilding, aged only sixteen, bought her first camera and tripod. She moved to London in 1910 and after an apprenticeship with the retoucher Ernest Chandler, who was associated with the fashionable portrait photographer H. Walter Barnett, she managed to save $60 by the time she was twenty-one. With this money she opened her first studio at 67 George Square, just off Portman Square, in 1914. 
Building on early success, Wilding moved to a top-floor studio at 264 Regent Street in 1918, employing seven staff to cope with the steadily growing demand for her work. Her loyal and talented staff (almost always women) were to grow in number throughout her career and number nearly forty at her peak during the 1930s. The idiosyncratic Wilding style was adopted by many who worked for her and assistants would be responsible for many famous portraits attributed to her. 
A Dorothy Wilding portrait is distinctive not only in style but also in presentation. The photograph, mounted on different layers of tinted card, was interlaced with tissue paper; a thick crayon outline surrounded the photograph which was embellished by her characteristic signature. The Wilding art nouveau logo was printed on the back. On 28 July 1920 Wilding married the leather merchant Walter Oscar Portham ('b'. 1867); it was a seemingly loveless marriage which ended in divorce eleven years later. On 4 June 1932, aged thirty-nine, she married the interior decorator Thomas (Rufus) Leighton Pearce (1882/3-1940) who was responsible for much of the modernist and striking design in her Bond Street studio. 
From 1923 onwards Wilding began to show her work both in Britain and abroad and became involved in commercial work including for the Condor Hat Company. She also began to supply leading periodicals with images of leading actresses -- defining the iconography of Tallulah Bankhead and Gladys Cooper. Wilding's portraits made her subjects beautiful, striking, and modern but also classical and sensual in a quintessential art deco style. Bright lighting, dramatic retouching, distinctive props, and her strict rules for posing, such as folding of hands and double profiles, characterized her style of iconic and idealized portraiture. 
Prosperity was guaranteed by a series of royal sittings starting in 1928 with Prince George, later duke of Kent, and followed by the official engagement portrait of the duke and Princess Marina in 1934. These led to the official coronation portraits of George VI (1937; NPG) and Elizabeth II (1952; NPG). Her coronation portrait of Elizabeth II, made at a sitting on 15 April 1952, was the basis for the design that appeared on British definitive postage stamps between 1952 and 1967 and became known as Wildings. In 1937 Wilding opened a second studio in New York. Her Bond Street studio was bombed in the blitz in 1940, which destroyed almost all the early negatives, prints, and records. Wilding continued to work in New York, and her American subjects such as Yul Brynner (1951; NPG) and Harry Belafonte (1954; NPG) inspired some of her best later work. The duke and duchess of Windsor became regular clients. 
Wilding's style of studio portraiture became less fashionable by the late 1950s and she exhibited her work for the last time at the London Salon of Photography in 1957. The following year her autobiography, 'In Pursuit of Perfection', was published and she sold her business for $3000 to one of her assistants, Tom Hustler, who kept the studio going until 1973. 
Wilding died on 9 February 1976 of heart failure at 1 Knaresborough Place, Kensington, London, leaving an estate of $54,000 with bequests to many of her long-serving assistants. The National Portrait Gallery holds over 900 of her original negatives and prints. Her work is also represented in, among other places, the Royal Photographic Society collection at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford.

Deakin, John (1912-1972), photographer, was born on the Wirral peninsula at 64 Beaconsfield Road, Lower Bebington, Cheshire, on 8 May 1912, the elder son of John Henry Deakin, a factory checker and later machine minder for Lever Brothers at nearby Port Sunlight, and his wife, Elsie Mary Bond. In 1923 he entered Calday Grange grammar school, West Kirby, where he excelled at swimming and diving, and remained there until 1928. About 1930 he left the Wirral for Ireland and in Dublin took various jobs, including one as a window dresser for a display company. He travelled to Spain to paint its landscape, but returned to Britain in the early 1930s and settled in London. An introduction to Arthur Jeffress, a wealthy American art collector (and later gallery owner), ensured that, as his companion, he could travel the world and paint. He exhibited at the Mayor Gallery, London, during November 1933 to some critical acclaim. 
Deakin first picked up a camera in Paris in 1939 -- it had been left behind in an apartment after a party -- and exposed a few frames. 'It was a cheap camera and he'd never taken a picture before', wrote his friend, the poet Elizabeth Smart, 'but his tyrannical eyes took over' (Smart). He took photographs for a living for the next two decades before abandoning it in favour of painting again. His most prolific years -- and probably his most creative -- were spent as a staff photographer for 'Vogue' magazine in the mid-1950s. He enjoyed two periods under contract to the magazine and remains the only photographer in its history to be hired and fired twice by the same editor. 
Deakin shot mostly portraits, though he was also obliged to shoot fashion (at which he proved to be mediocre). His subjects were the writers, artists, poets, actors, and popular entertainers of the early post-war years: among them David Lean, John Huston, Yves Montand, Pablo Picasso, Maria Callas, and Dylan Thomas. His best portraits, however, were those of his friends, most of whom inhabited the pubs and clubs of Soho, London's bohemian quarter, the lure of which, in time, led him away from 'Vogue'; the Colony Room in Dean Street was a favourite haunt of his until he was barred. These sitters included the painters John Minton and Francis Bacon and the 'two Roberts', Colquhoun and MacBryde, the poets W. S. Graham and Paul Potts, and the formidable proprietor of the Colony Room, Muriel Belcher. His photographs -- typically tightly cropped head shots often greater than life-size -- made no concessions to vanity: after pushing the contrast in his prints to its maximum, every pore and blemish was exposed in intimate close-up. His friend Daniel Farson described them as 'prison mugshots taken by a real artist' (Bernard and Noble, 12), and they were frequently found to be too unflattering for 'Vogue' to publish. The frontality of his composition and his very lack of 'style' set him apart from his contemporaries and anticipated by at least ten years the fashionable starkness of the portraiture of Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus. 
A substantial part of Deakin's 'oeuvre' was recovered from the floor of Francis Bacon's studio. Dog-eared and splattered with paint, these were portraits of subjects Bacon himself wished to depict; he commissioned from Deakin photographs of Henrietta Moraes, Isabel Rawsthorne, and George Dyer, among others, as 'aides-memoires', since he was unwilling to paint their likenesses from life. 
Before giving up photography in the 1960s, Deakin had completed a book of photographs, 'London Today' (1949), and the plate section to Christopher Kininmonth's 'Rome Alive' (1951). He had also contributed to 'Who Only England Know' (1943) by John Pudney, a book about Malta (where Deakin spent much of the war years as a sergeant in the army film and photography unit), and completed sample pages for a book on a steelworks and tyre factory in Genoa and one on Paris, which developed out of an exhibition held at David Archer's bookshop in Soho. He had written the text and completed the photographs for an unpublished book, 'Eight Portraits'. In addition, he had photographed examples of children's street art and urban graffiti for two uncompleted projects, 'London Walls' and 'Paris Walls'. A confirmed bachelor, he married in Milan in 1961 not for love but for convenience. In return for citizenship papers, Anna, a stateless Hungarian refugee, financed a replacement for a misplaced Rolleiflex camera. 
After his death from heart failure on 25 May 1972 at the Old Ship Hotel, Brighton, Deakin's life's work was retrieved from under his bed in Soho by Bruce Bernard, who later curated a small show of his work, 'John Deakin: the salvage of a photographer', at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1984. At a larger exhibition, 'John Deakin photographs', at the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 1996, many of his rediscovered pictures for 'Vogue' were shown and, for the first time, the photographs from the floor of Bacon's studio. He was the subject of a television documentary, 'The Salvage of a Soho Photographer' (1991), and appears as a character in the film 'Love is the Devil' (1997), played by the actor Karl Johnson. Deakin was also the subject of several character sketches in contemporary fiction, notably Colin Wilson's 'Ritual in the Dark' (1960) and Elaine Dundy's 'The Old Man and Me' (1964), mostly vitriolic portrayals, for when drunk he was a monster. Barbara Hutton, the Woolworths' heir, called him the 'second nastiest little man she had met in forty years' (Farson, 'Sacred Monsters', 63), but to his peers he was a true original, his professionalism behind the lens, for the most part, unimpeachable.

Houghton, Joseph Henry (1876-1949), trade unionist, was born at Northampton on 27 March 1876, the second son of Joseph Houghton, riveter, and his wife, Emma, 'nee' Trusler. By the age of fifteen he had followed his father into the shoe industry, working as a clicker in Northampton, and by 1901 he had moved to Scotland, where he was working as a clicker in Kilmarnock. He married, in Kilmarnock on 31 December 1902, Elizabeth Martha (1884/5-1921), daughter of Henry Simcoe, manager in a boot factory. 
Houghton worked in the leather industry in the manufacture of footwear and represented the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives as delegate to Glasgow Trades Council (GTC), and the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC). Houghton was to become a leading political activist within the council; he was elected to the parliamentary committee of the GTC in 1907 and to the trades disputes committee the following year. As an active trade unionist he argued continually for workers' rights. As an active socialist he tirelessly promoted any campaign which would challenge the conditions of poverty experienced by the working classes on Clydeside and elsewhere. 
In 1910 -- still representing the boot and shoe operatives -- Houghton denounced the 'scandalous sentences' passed against the former dockers' organizer Jim Larkin, of the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL). Larkin had been accused by James Sexton, leader of the NUDL, of attempting to defraud the union. Houghton testified to Larkin's honesty and integrity but he was nevertheless found guilty and imprisoned for twelve months. When shortly afterwards the Glasgow dockers finally decided to leave the NUDL, James Kessack approached the GTC for assistance in encouraging men 'back into the union', and in December 1910 a ten-man committee, which included Joseph Houghton, was set up to help reform Glasgow dockers. By January 1911, however, the Glasgow docks branch of the NUDL was closed down and within six months the men were reorganized into a new union, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers (SUDL). Houghton played a leading role in this development and in 1911 was elected general secretary of the SUDL. 
During the labour unrest between 1910 and 1914 Houghton was to become closely associated with the London activists Tom Mann and Ben Tillett, the French syndicalist Madame Sorgue of the Confederation Generale du Travail, and Captain Edward Tupper of the seamen's union, as well as other socialist and industrial activists in Scotland, including Kessack and James Keir Hardie. By 1916 Houghton was a member of the parliamentary committee of the STUC and was office bearer on that committee between 1917 and 1919. He was the Clyde district secretary and executive council member to the National Transport Workers' Federation (NTWF) and a fervent supporter of the Triple Industrial Alliance. He served on several wartime governmental bodies, and in 1919 gave evidence on behalf of the Glasgow dockers to the transport workers' court of inquiry -- where he worked closely with Ernest Bevin. It was at this inquiry that he stated he was the only Englishman among the Scots and Irish who made up the dock labour force at Glasgow. 
Houghton remained leader of the SUDL until the membership (reluctantly) transferred to the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) in 1923. During that time he witnessed the membership of the SUDL double from 5000 to 10,000 and extended to cover other workers -- most notably female munitions workers at Nobel's chemical factory at Ardeer in Ayrshire. In 1923 Houghton became docks secretary of the TGWU in Scotland, a position he held until his retirement in 1941. During that time he remained active in Scotland and represented the TGWU at the Trades Union Congress. He was brought out of retirement briefly in 1942. Following the death of his first wife he married, in Glasgow on 14 November 1930, Elizabeth Mair ('b'. 1891/2), a laundrymaid, daughter of Archibald Mair, police constable. Latterly they lived at Carbeth, Blanefield, Stirlingshire. Houghton died at the Killearn Hospital on 9 June 1949.

Kessack, James O'Connor (1879-1916), trade unionist, was born on 19 October 1879 at 1 Castle Terrace, Aberdeen, the second of nine children of James O'Connor Kessack, a baker, and his wife, Isabella 'nee' Davidson, a farmer's daughter. An unskilled labourer, he moved to Glasgow after his mother's death to seek more regular work. Following his father's death he supported the younger members of the family in Glasgow. A religious man and regular churchgoer, Kessack began to embrace socialism in the early 1900s, having hitherto rejected it. Thereafter his conversion to socialism was swift, as was his rise within the labour movement. 
As a committed socialist, Kessack regularly addressed political meetings on behalf of the Independent Labour Party. He wrote various articles and in 1907 published his lecture to the Glasgow Clarion Scouts as 'The Early Struggles for Political Freedom in Scotland'. Under pressure of work he developed a serious throat infection in 1908 and the ILP financed his visit to Arizona in search of a cure. On return he was adopted as a Labour candidate in various municipal and parliamentary divisions in the Glasgow area between 1909 and 1911. Political success eluded him, however, and thereafter he concentrated on trade union activities. 
Kessack became national organizer for the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) in 1909, following James Larkin's dismissal the previous year. He enjoyed some success along the east coast of Scotland, but failed to win over the Clyde dockers and the Glasgow dockers in particular. The reasons behind these failures may have had more to do with his close connections with James Sexton, leader of the NUDL, than any lack of commitment to dock trade unionism on his part. He never laboured as a docker, however, and this could have worked against him as Glasgow had in the past rejected men who had no practical knowledge of dock work. 
It would seem more likely that it was Sexton's quarrels with James Larkin that hampered Kessack's work at Glasgow. The conflict between Sexton and Larkin sent shock waves through trade union circles after Larkin was arrested, tried, and found guilty of attempting to defraud the NUDL. Indeed, Sexton gave evidence against Larkin. The Glasgow Trades Council backed a resolution, moved by Joseph Houghton, 'denouncing the attempt to crush Mr Jim Larkin' (Glasgow Trades Council minutes, 29 June 1910), and pronounced him innocent, which echoed the sentiments of the Glasgow dockers. Kessack had in his own words 'nursed the Glasgow branch like a tender baby' (Taplin, 78), but despite his undoubted popularity he could not win over a Glasgow dock labour force which actively protested against Sexton's authoritarian style of leadership. 
Kessack initially resigned over the issue, but reconsidered after Sexton's personal intervention. In late December 1910 he sought the assistance of Glasgow Trades Council in his attempt to reorganize the Glasgow dockers. The trades council agreed and assigned a ten-man committee to this task. It was to no avail. In January 1911 Sexton officially closed down the Glasgow branch. Six months later the Glasgow dockers were reorganized under the auspices of the recently formed Scottish Union of Dock Labourers (SUDL). Joseph Houghton was elected the first general secretary of the SUDL. 
Kessack continued with the NUDL up to 1914 and saw some considerable success, despite losing the dockers of the Clyde ports of west Scotland and Dundee and Bo'ness on the east coast to the SUDL. He reorganized the Aberdeen branch of the NUDL and set up branches in England where Ben Tillett's Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union had failed to attract support. His greatest contribution was in setting up NUDL branches at Hull, which hitherto had been the headquarters of William Collison's National Association of Free Labour and considered the epicentre of 'blacklegism' within the port transport industry. 
Kessack enlisted in 1914 and rose swiftly to the rank of captain by March 1916, but he died in France at the battle of the Ancre on 13 November of that year leaving a widow and two children resident in Glasgow. Despite his earlier problems with the Glasgow dockers, and for a time the SUDL leadership, he never wavered from his commitment to socialism or dock trade unionism.

Kebell, Thomas (c.1439-1500), lawyer, was the third son of Walter Kebell and his second wife, Agnes, daughter of John Folville of Rearsby in Leicestershire. His father's background is hazy but from at least 1420 Walter was steward of the honour of Abergavenny, the dower of Joan Beauchamp, Lady Bergavenny. He later served the lord treasurer, Richard, Lord Cromwell, but it was probably the Beauchamp connection that secured his marriage to Agnes, the daughter of the royal coroner for Leicestershire, and eventually half the estates of her long-established county family. About 1454 Thomas Kebell entered the Inner Temple, and his name came to figure prominently in records connected with the educational work of the inn. He became a bencher, and a partial text of what is probably his second law reading exists in the British Library (BL, Hargrave MS 87, fols. 302-8). Kebell built a highly successful midlands practice upon service to the locally dominant Hastings retinue, as both attorney-general to the family and as the counsel of choice to the Hastings affinity. He remained a client of the Hastings family until his death. 
From 1477 Kebell was retained by the duchy of Lancaster. In 1483, probably through the influence of William, Lord Hastings, Kebell replaced Richard Empson as duchy attorney-general but was promoted serjeant-at-law in 1486 to allow Empson to be restored to office. Commissioned as justice of assize on the northern circuit from February 1494, Kebell became second justice at Lancaster in 1495. In June of that year he took the oath as a royal counsellor and in November became a king's serjeant, sitting in the Lords in that capacity in 1497. In 1499 he was appointed justice at Chester. 
Inheriting no land himself, Thomas Kebell was the fortunate beneficiary of a gift in the late 1460s of a sizeable estate in and around Great Stretton near Leicester. The donor was a distant relative, Richard Hotoft, esquire, of Humberstone, who may already have financed Kebell's training at the Inner Temple, and it was probably this new status (in addition to the support of William, Lord Hastings) that accounted for his appointment as a Leicestershire JP in 1474. Thereafter by careful investment of his 'winnings' from the law -- and shrewd if not sharp speculation -- Thomas Kebell built up a substantial estate in some twenty villages in the county, with possibly other property outside. In 1476 or 1477 he purchased the Hotoft manor and house at Humberstone near Leicester which he made his home, a substantial two-storied building of fourteen rooms, with offices. Much of his estate was devoted to sheep farming and after his death his flock was inventoried at over 3500. 
Although never a judge at Westminster, Kebell is of unique interest among late medieval common lawyers because of the comprehensive documentation that has survived about him. As well as the law reading, this includes his will, inventory, inquisition post mortem and a very large number of his law opinions which throw considerable light on contemporary legal ideas and practice; Kebell is, indeed, the most reported serjeant-at-law of his day. In court he showed a boundless confidence coupled with a style aggressive and humorous, and in the year-books he comes over as well educated and of real intellectual strength. He was fluent in French and Latin, expert in rhetoric, and his inventory, which details his farming and his affluent lifestyle, also lists thirty-six books, both manuscript and print, an impressive collection covering religion, general knowledge, the classics, literature, and a little law. 
Thomas Kebell married three times. Margery Palmer probably belonged to a Northamptonshire legal family. His second wife and the mother of his minor heir, Walter, was Agnes Flower, 'nee' Saltbie, the widowed daughter-in-law of Roger Flower, four times speaker of the House of Commons; they were married in 1483. Kebell died on 26 June 1500. Despite his planning, the crown established a claim to the wardship of the heir, but although this was then purchased by Kebell's patron, Lady Mary Hastings, and Walter later made two advantageous marriages, he died young leaving a two-year-old son in royal wardship and an estate encumbered with charges. One of these was to the serjeant's third wife, Margaret Basset (whom he had married in 1498), the heir of Ralph Basset of Blore in Staffordshire, who continued to collect a jointure of $40 for thirty-four years, despite having married Sir Ralph Egerton of Ridley in Cheshire, Henry VIII's standard-bearer; she died in 1534. The death of Walter's own son was followed by a third minority and more encumbrances, and by the time his male line died out in 1571 most of the serjeant's estate had been liquidated. A memorial tomb in Humberstone church with Kebell's effigy in robes was destroyed between 1638 and 1795.

Thorburn, Robert Forrester (1821-1898), merchant, the only son of George Thorburn ('c'.1795-1871), a tea merchant, and Anne, 'nee' Forrester, was born at 5 Fyfe Place, Leith, on 13 April 1821. Nothing is known of his education but in February 1847 he was listed as a clerk in Canton (Guangzhou), employed by Maclean, Dearie & Co., and he spent the best part of the next fifty years on the China coast. From 1850 he worked in Shanghai for Turner & Co., but left them at the end of December 1860. On 11 April 1861, probably on his return from a trip to Britain, he began, with the Revd W. R. Beach, the Revd Samuel W. Bonney, and Dr W. Dickson, what was then a singular and possibly dangerous overland trip from Canton to Hankou. The travellers intended to take advantage of the new treaty, which afforded the right to travel in the Chinese interior, and were keen to explore the possibilities of the route as a possible conduit for the tea trade. Canton itself was still under British occupation, and more than once the travellers were met by crowds shouting 'Sha' ('kill'), but on the whole the 41-day journey was smooth and the crowds just intensely curious. Bonney rhapsodized about the potential for railway development along the route, but Thorburn left no record of his impressions, and instead of going on with the missionaries to Nanking (Nanjing), then controlled by the Taiping insurgents, he stayed briefly in the newly opened treaty port of Hankou. 
In 1878, after several years as an independent merchant in Shanghai, Thorburn was appointed secretary of the Shanghai municipal council (SMC). The climax of his quiet but firm custodianship of the council was the jubilee celebration in November 1893, which marked the fiftieth anniversary of the settlement. From its shaky start in 1843 the British-dominated settlement had grown to encompass the heart of the growing metropolis of Shanghai. 'In what region of the earth is not Shanghai known?' asked the banners strung across the settlement's streets during the celebration and, more menacingly, 'Shanghai guards its own' ('Jubilee of Shanghai', 44). The secretary headed the administration that did this guarding for the smug settler oligarchy, which in turn provided the elected councillors and which made immense fortunes from land speculation in and around the international settlement. Thorburn was unusual among long-term residents in not profiting so well out of land, and the secretaryship might well have been an act of charity for the owner of an ailing merchant house. 
In 1897 Thorburn resigned owing to ill health, on a generous pension of $500 per annum. He returned to his native Leith, where he died of chronic diarrhoea at his home, 12 Hermitage Place, on 17 September 1898, leaving his estate to his four unmarried sisters. He was buried in South Leith parish churchyard on 22 September. A memorial stained-glass window was ordered from Britain by the SMC and placed in the south aisle of Holy Trinity Cathedral, Shanghai. 
Thorburn's successor, J. O. P. Bland, was a more bellicose and self-conscious agent of British imperialism in China, but such forward policies were either unsuccessful -- China coast lobbyists (the 'China hands') failed to secure a Yangtze (Yangzi) protectorate -- or else they provoked violent responses from the Chinese population of Shanghai, such as the 1905 'Mixed Court riot'. Shanghai's rise to international prominence was rooted in the previous decades of basic stability after the turmoil of the Taiping uprising (1850-65). Under the quiet handling of Alex Thorburn, as he was familiarly known, the SMC, the principal agency of British settler power in China, had grown greatly year by year in strength, capability, and ambition.

Dane, Sir Richard Morris (1854-1940), administrator in India, was born on 21 May 1854, the third of four surviving sons of an Anglo-Irish family that was prominent in service in imperial India. His father was Richard Martin Dane (1813-1901) of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who served in India and eventually became inspector-general of hospitals; his mother, Sophia Eliza, 'nee' Griffiths, came from a family long connected with India. His brother Sir Louis William Dane was also to serve in India, and his own son, also Richard, served in the 1st Punjab cavalry. The bulk of Dane's career was spent in the Indian Civil Service, and it was here that he made a name for himself as an administrator of boundless confidence and exceptional vigour, who was painstaking in attention to detail, and unusual in his effectiveness. 
Dane was educated at Dr Stackpole's school, Kingstown, Dublin, before passing the Indian Civil Service examination in 1872 ['see 'competition wallahs]. After a probationary period he went out to Punjab province. While Dane was briefly attached to the foreign department of the government of India, his right eye was seriously injured in a polo match at Lahore. The lingering effects of the injury rendered his later accomplishments that much more impressive: although the eye was saved, he could not read for long periods without strain, and in order to continue shooting he taught himself to shoot from the left shoulder. While in England for medical attention following the accident he married, on 24 June 1880, Emily (1861/2-1928), third daughter of Sir Edward Leeds, third baronet, a colonel in the Indian army. They had a son and two daughters, one of whom did not survive infancy. Dane divorced his wife in 1901 and she remarried in the following year. 
Throughout the 1870s and 1880s Dane's career advanced with appointments that included under secretary to the government of the Punjab, boundary settlement officer in central India, and assistant commissioner at Ajmer. In 1890 he was promoted to commissioner of excise; from then on his most significant achievements were in the realm of tax, particularly salt tax, administration. He attracted wider attention, not all of it positive, when he aided Lord Brassey's royal commission on opium and contributed two lengthy historical appendices on the production of opium and the opium trade between India and China to the commission's final report (1895). These were an important component of the report, which found that the claims of the then quite vociferous anti-opium lobby were overstated, and that in any case the Indian government could not abolish the trade without instituting new and unpopular taxes in its stead. For his contribution to the final report Dane earned the opprobrium of the anti-opiumists, and was denounced in the House of Commons. 
Dane was made CIE in 1896 and continued his administrative career with appointments as secretary in the finance and commerce department, commissioner for salt revenue in north India in 1898, and eventually as the first inspector-general of excise and salt in 1907. During these years he developed and first attempted to implement his ideas on salt tax and administration. He believed that, in the realm of colonial finance, an indirect tax was always more popular than a direct tax, and that with unification of control, rationalization of administration, and the prevention of smuggling, a large revenue to the state and a lower tax on the people could be achieved simultaneously. 
Although active as an administrator, and incessant in touring remote areas of India, Dane retired from the Indian Civil Service in 1909, in order to get in some years of hunting while his health remained good. He was made KCIE in the same year. Retirement was short lived. In 1913 the fledgeling post-imperial Chinese government and a consortium of banks then in the process of extending a controversially large loan (the 'reorganization loan') to the Chinese government invited Dane to China to reorganize the salt gabelle and put it on an administrative basis sound enough to service the ensuing annual loan debt. Knowing not a word of Chinese, but a good deal about rationalizing the salt tax administration, Dane arrived in China in 1913. Without preliminaries, he wrested for his newly created salt inspectorate an impressive degree of autonomy and set up a joint Sino-foreign administration that was organized on strict civil service principles of entry by examination and promotion by seniority. The Sino-foreign salt inspectorate was, from the very beginning, so untainted by corruption and so successful in terms of efficient tax collection that even after the reorganization loan debt service was paid, its annual surpluses continued to provide the second highest and most reliable source of tax to the Chinese government long after Dane departed from China in 1919. Indeed, the salt inspectorate, along with the customs administration formed by Sir Robert Hart in the previous century, embodied a set of principles that provided a working model of efficient, effective, and depoliticized administration. As such, it attracted a great deal of admiration from administrative reformers who wished to emulate it, and opprobrium from Chinese nationalists for whom the organization's links to the group banks reeked of imperialism. The salt inspectorate was taken into the nationalist government of Chaing Kai-shek in 1928, and continued to operate successfully along the principles originally articulated by Dane until some years after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War of 1937. Dane was rewarded by the Chinese government with the first class of the order of the Excellent Crop (1915) and of the Striped Tiger (1918). 
After Dane left China he wrote an affectionate memoir of his hunting expeditions entitled 'Sport in Asia and Africa' (1921); he retired to Herefordshire, where he remained active in salmon fishing into his eighties. He died at his home, Morney Cross, Fownhope, Herefordshire, on 13 February 1940.

Campbell, James Duncan (1833-1907), customs official, was born on 9 February 1833 at 7 Warriston Crescent, Edinburgh, the first child of Major Robert Campbell (1799-1874), of Craignish, Argyll, an officer in the 46th regiment, and his first wife, Louisa, 'nee' Baillie (died 1870). After studying at Cheltenham College (from Easter 1844 to October 1850), at Boulogne, and at university in Paris (1851-2) and Heidelberg (1853) Campbell worked briefly at his uncle's firm in Calcutta from 1853 to 1854. After his uncle's death, the then somewhat aimless young man returned to Britain contemplating the army and the Indian Civil Service as careers. Eventually, however, he joined the British Civil Service, where he spent six years in the Treasury and Audit Office from 1856 to 1862. Campbell was by now seen as something of a high-flyer, and was appointed secretary to the chief of the Treasury; he was also a prominent member of the volunteer movement, and musketry-inspector to the Civil Service Volunteers. 
The Treasury's rising star was poached by the nascent Chinese maritime customs service in 1862. This service was born in the chaos of the Taiping uprising in China (1850-65), at a time when the breakdown of effective Chinese administration in Shanghai threatened to undo the system of Sino-foreign trade and diplomacy founded on the treaty of Nanjing (1842). Foreign inspectors were appointed to oversee the collection of customs dues from foreign traders for the Chinese authorities. This 'Shanghai system' grew into a national service which, despite being an arm of the Chinese state, was controlled and staffed by foreign personnel. In this way China used foreign experts to mediate with foreign traders, and -- effectively -- to lobby and negotiate for China in the new world of state-to-state diplomacy that Chinese officials were entering after the mid-century wars with Britain and France. The service became in time the prime revenue-collection service of the Chinese state and the security on which foreign loans were raised. Its first inspector-general, Horatio Nelson Lay, was appointed in May 1859 to establish the service at all treaty ports, and Campbell was appointed by Lay as chief secretary and auditor; he sailed for China in March 1863. 
Lay's was, however, a false start for the service, and it was effectively refounded after his dismissal in November 1863, by a firmer hand. Ulsterman Sir Robert Hart (1835-1911) had been Lay's deputy since 1860, and he took over the service and controlled it until his death. Lay was arrogant, and attempted to assume powers well beyond those acceptable to the Chinese. Hart was an altogether smoother figure; although he ruled the service like an autocrat he subordinated himself properly to Chinese control. Campbell had been taken on to help establish an accounting system for the service but after 1870 he found himself mostly based in Britain on various missions, and Hart decided that it would be more useful to have him formally based in London as non-resident secretary from 1873 onwards. 
If the Chinese maritime customs service developed around the figure of Hart in Peking (Beijing) -- and Hart became a dominant and dominating figure in Sino-British relations -- it would certainly have been a very different organization without the effort and dedication of Campbell in London. Campbell was a hard-working man of solidly fixed habits, who in later life looked very much like -- and was often taken for -- Lord Salisbury. He established the London office in 1874 -- which was funded by quarterly subventions from the customs administration in Peking -- and it became the nursery for some of the service's finest recruits. It also served as the examination centre for the service, as its supply department, and as an information bureau. The London office, at 8 Storey's Gate, also facilitated the visit of Chinese embassies, such as that of Guo Songtao in 1877-8, and at times rivalled the Chinese legation as the arm of the Chinese government in London. However, Hart was always careful to make sure that Campbell remained his own private representative and that he acquired no official diplomatic office (such as a consulship). Campbell also negotiated with Jules Ferry the 1885 peace treaty which ended the Franco-Chinese War of 1884-5, and the Sino-Portuguese commercial treaty of 1887, the 'protocol of Lisbon', which fixed the status of Macau. More importantly, in many ways he was Robert Hart's personal fixer in London. His duties ranged from negotiating with the Foreign Office on behalf of the service, to supplying Hart with new shoes and suits, violin music, and instruments for the brass band he formed in Peking to provide entertainment at soirees, or disbursing handouts to Hart's 'wards' -- the three children of Sir Robert's liaison with a Chinese woman, Ayaou, who were educated and then worked in Britain before emigrating to Canada. Campbell became best-known not for his own contribution to the activities of the customs service, but rather for his absence from China and as Sir Robert Hart's London muse and London agent. Though the two men met in person only two or three times their correspondence was full and vigorous, lasting from 1868 to 1907 and affording an invaluable guide to the life and thoughts of that important and enigmatic figure, Hart, and also to the development of the service. 
Campbell had married in Brighton, on 22 September 1870, Ellen Mary Lewis, daughter of T. R. Lewis, and they had five sons and two daughters. He never revisited China after 1870 and never met Hart after 1878. Campbell's eldest son, James Baillie Campbell, joined the service -- its administrative ethos and structures were well-oiled by nepotism -- but he died of typhoid in Peking in 1892 within a year of arriving in China. That year provided a further blow when Campbell lost some $80,000 in the Colman and May collapse. The customs service aside, the main preoccupation of Campbell's later years was attempting to prove himself the rightful heir to the Craignish succession. 
Campbell died at his home, 18 Clanricarde Gardens, Hyde Park, London, on 3 December 1907, following complications after a bowel operation, and was buried on 6 December in Kensal Green cemetery, London. Hart lasted little longer in China and in 1908 left for England, where he died three years later. Campbell was much honoured over the years -- as CMG (1885), as commander of the Legion d'honneur and of the Portuguese order of the Conception, and as a member of the imperial order of the Double Dragon -- but Hart stole all the glory for the successes of the customs service, as was his wont. Campbell deserves much credit, however, for his contributions to the development of one of China's most important and influential modern institutions.

Morse, Hosea Ballou (1855-1934), customs official and historian of China, was born on 18 July 1855 in South Brookfield, Queens county, Nova Scotia, the first of the four children of Albert David Morse (1832-1900) and his wife, 'nee' Mercey Dexter Park ('c'.1830- 'c'.1900). A fifth-generation Nova Scotian, whose earlier ancestors had emigrated from England to Massachusetts Bay in 1635, Hosea lived in South Brookfield and then in Halifax, before moving with his parents to Medford, Massachusetts, near Boston, in 1865. 
As a young boy Morse had an active imagination, but he reportedly 'preferred books to play'. His father, a struggling but determined shoe merchant, decided to send him to the prestigious Boston Latin school, which he attended from 1866 to 1870; Hosea excelled in his studies, particularly foreign languages. In 1869 both he and his father became naturalized United States citizens. The next year Hosea entered Harvard College, graduating with highest honours in 1874. At that time he accepted an offer from an influential Harvard alumnus to join the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs Service under its renowned inspector-general Robert Hart. 
From a lowly clerk during the mid-1870s, when he began learning Chinese with the assistance of a Chinese tutor, who worked with him each day for an hour before breakfast, Morse gradually rose in the ranks to become a full commissioner in 1898 and statistical secretary in the early 1900s. During this period he served in nearly a dozen places, from the vibrant metropolitan centres of Peking (Beijing), Tientsin (Tianjin), and Shanghai to such lonely backwater ports as Kiungchow (Qiongshan), Pakhoi (Beihai), and Lungchow (Longzhou). He married Annie (Nan) Josephine Welsford (1853-1940) on 8 February 1881. 
Like many other customs personnel in late nineteenth-century China, Morse undertook a number of non-customs assignments with Hart's encouragement. For example, he distributed relief during the great famine of 1876-8, taught English in the Peking Interpreters' College during 1878-9, served as a Chinese-language interpreter in Peking, Tientsin, and London from 1879 to 1882, superintended the exchange of prisoners after the Sino-French War of 1884-5, and advised the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company from 1885 to 1887. 
During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-5 Morse became deeply involved in delicate diplomatic negotiations, and in 1899 he handled the sensitive and dangerous opening of the port of Yochow (Yeuzhou) in Hunan province. After an offer from President William Howard Taft to become the United States minister to China (which Morse refused on grounds of poor health) and official retirement in 1909, he continued to assist the Chinese government. In 1920, for instance, he travelled to Brussels as an adviser to the Chinese delegation to the Economics and Financial Conference of the League of Nations, for which he received the order of the Excellent Crop. 
Morse enjoyed a distinguished career as a historian following his departure from China in 1907. In the early stages of the First World War (1915) -- and after nearly a decade of residence in England -- he applied to become a British citizen again, moved by Great Britain's heroic war effort. In 1924 he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Harvard University. Among Morse's most famous and influential works on China were 'The Trade and Administration of the Chinese Empire' (1908), 'The International Relations of the Chinese Empire' (3 vols., 1910-18), and 'The Chronicles of the East India Company Trading to China, 1635-1834' (5 vols., 1926-9). He also wrote a fascinating historical novel based on the military exploits of Frederick Townsend Ward and Charles G. Gordon during the Taiping uprising (1850-64), entitled 'In the Days of the Taipings' (1927). 
On 13 February 1934 Morse died of pneumonia at his home, Arden, Grange Road, Camberley, Surrey, where he had lived since 1914. His remains were cremated and buried at Brookwood on 16 February. His devoted wife, Nan, died six years later. Although childless, they cared for the two children of Hosea's brother, Albert Morse ('b'. 1864), after the death of Albert's wife in 1893.

Gutzlaff, Karl Friedrich August (1803-1851), missionary and civil servant, son of Johann Jakob Gutzlaff (1767-1825), a tailor, and Maria Elisabeth Gutzlaff, 'nee' Behneken (1767-1807), was born in Pyritz, province of Pomerania, Prussia, on 8 July 1803. Having attended Pyritz municipal school from 1811 to 1816, he was apprenticed to a brazier in Stettin. However, finding foreign evangelistic work more attractive, he entered Janicke's Missionary School in Berlin in 1821. After further training in Rotterdam, he was ordained in 1826 and sent to the Dutch East Indies as an agent of the Netherlands Missionary Society. After a brief spell in Batavia with William Henry Medhurst, Gutzlaff set out on 8 April 1827 to convert the Chinese settlers in the Riau archipelago. A year later he embarked on independent missionary work among the Chinese of Bangkok, Siam. On 26 November 1829, during a visit to Malacca, Gutzlaff married Maria Newell ('c'.1794-1831) of the London Missionary Society. 
Being a restless spirit with seemingly boundless energy, Gutzlaff next turned up on the China coast. As a result of his trip to Tientsin (Tianjin) in a Chinese junk in 1831, British traders began to make use of his extraordinary linguistic talents in their efforts to find new markets. Although he was later criticized for having associated with opium smugglers to propagate Christianity, Gutzlaff regarded these trips as unique opportunities to preach and distribute Christian literature beyond the confines of Canton (Guangzhou). Moreover, his 'Journal of Three Voyages Along the Coast of China in 1831, 1832, 1833' (1834) generated considerable interest in China in Western political, commercial, and religious circles, as did his 'Sketch of Chinese history, ancient and modern, comprising a retrospect of the foreign intercourse and trade with China' (1834) and the more controversial 'China opened, or, A display of the topography, history, customs, manners, etc. of the Chinese empire' (1838). All three were written in English. At the same time, Gutzlaff sought to create greater awareness among the Chinese of Western achievements through religious and secular publications such as his serial 'Dong-Xi yang kao meiyue tongji zhuan' (the 'East-West monthly magazine'), which between 1833 and 1839 contained contributions on Western science, geography, government, and history. During these busy and adventurous years, he still found time on 6 May 1834 to marry the independent missionary Mary Wanstall (1799-1849) at Malacca. 
In 1835 Gutzlaff entered British government service as an assistant interpreter and Chinese secretary to the chief superintendent of trade in China. During the First Opium War (1839-42) he was appointed civil administrator at Tinghai (Dinghai; July 1840 - February 1841) at the time of the first British occupation of Chushan Island, and subsequently at Ningpo (Ningbo; October 1841 - May 1842). During the intervening military campaigns he was interpreter to the commander of the British expeditionary force and was present as indispensable interpreter-negotiator at the conclusion of the treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) on 29 August 1842. He spent a further eleven months (September 1842 - August 1843) as civil magistrate on Chushan Island during the second British occupation. Having failed to secure a consulship on account of his alien status, Gutzlaff succeeded John Robert Morrison as first Chinese secretary to her majesty's government in Hong Kong in 1843. 
Although a civil servant, Gutzlaff did not neglect his missionary work. During the First Opium War he had come to realize that 'China can be evangelised only by the Chinese'. To this end, in 1844 he formed the controversial Chinese Union of indigenous colporteurs and evangelists to carry the gospel to all parts of the Chinese empire. Foreign missionaries, living in Chinese style, were to provide only initial training and guidance. 
In September 1849 Gutzlaff left for Europe to garner support for the Chinese Union. Yet while he was enthusiastically welcomed in several European countries, the fraudulent activities of his unscrupulous Chinese associates were exposed by less credulous Hong Kong missionaries. When Gutzlaff returned to the colony in early 1851 his Chinese Union was on the point of collapse. Disappointed and worn out by overexertion, he died from dropsy on 9 August 1851 and was buried in Happy Valley cemetery, Hong Kong, leaving a widow, Dorothy Gabriel (1821-1888), whom he had married in Bristol on 17 September 1850. 
History has not been kind to Karl Gutzlaff. One scholar calls him 'a cross between parson and pirate, charlatan and genius, philanthropist and crook' (A. Waley, 'The Opium War through Chinese Eyes', 1958, 233). He was a missionary enthusiast with progressive ideas, yet also a poor judge of men and lacking in organizational skills. Still, his career of 'missionary-diplomat' has to be seen in its proper historical context. At a time when China remained a closed country, his role as cultural mediator between East and West was not without merit. Moreover, Gutzlaff's vital government service during and after the First Opium War was fully recognized by the British authorities.

Little, Alicia Ellen Neve (1845-1926), author and campaigner against foot-binding, was born in Madeira, the youngest of the three daughters and three sons of Calverley Bewicke (1816-1864), a landowner, of Hallaton Hall, Leicestershire, and his wife, Mary Amelia, youngest daughter of the Revd Nathaniel John Hollingworth. She was educated at home in Madeira (1850-65). For twenty years, until 1886, she lived in England, but she travelled widely. Her novels, written in her twenties and thirties, reveal her impatience with the marriage market of the English 'season'. 'Miss Standish' (1883), about a feminist spinster with passionate humanitarian convictions who finally achieves a marriage of true minds, seems clearly autobiographical and over a century later is still of interest to students of nineteenth-century British women's history. She also wrote a story, 'Mother Darling' (1885), in support of the 'Married Women's Property Act', out of indignation at a woman's vulnerability in law if a blackguard husband sought to take their children and her property away. Allegedly she was fired by the plight of her own eldest sister. 
On 2 November 1886 Alicia Bewicke married the merchant, Sinologist, and practical dreamer Archibald John Little (1838-1908), who first opened the waters of the Yangtze (Yangzi) River to steam navigation; he was the son of William John Little, physician. Together they went to live in the far west of China at Chungking (Chongqing) in Szechwan (Sichuan) province. After dogged persistence Alicia Little managed to out-face the crowd's astonishment at the sight of a European woman and to walk the streets of Chungking unmolested. But travelling in the wilds was more difficult; both she and her husband were sometimes pelted by foreigner-hating locals and at other times she had to try to pass for a male to be allowed shelter overnight. In 1900 they succeeded in reaching the frontier of Tibet. 
Alicia Little was admiring of many aspects of Chinese culture, although deeply upset by the extreme poverty of the people. The routine infliction of torture to induce false confessions, she wrote, 'made one's blood boil' (Little, 'The Land of the Blue Gown', 193). What she found intolerable, however, was the continued, widespread foot-binding of Chinese girls as the traditional symbol of the girl's desire to please a future husband. She saw countless lame girls hobbling with sticks, dark lines under their sad eyes, their pale faces rouged to look healthy; she heard many gruesome accounts of gangrenous limbs, mortification, and amputations; she saw ladies having to be helped by their (unbound) women slaves to cross a room; she saw women carried on the backs of men like sacks because they could not walk, and knew that many died or committed suicide in civil wars because they could not flee; she learned from doctors of the lifelong injury done to Chinese women's internal organs from the necessity to throw the balance of their whole bodies on to their heels; and in the west of China she noted how poor women even tracked boats: 'with bound, hoof-like feet, besides carrying water, whilst in the north the unfortunate working women do field work, often kneeling on the heavy clay soil, because they are incapable of standing. It is only at Canton that bound feet are in any sense a mark of gentility, though in Shanghai and many other parts they are a sign of respectability. (ibid., 343)' Alicia Little knew that a few missionaries had already campaigned against foot-binding, forbidding the practice to their own schoolgirls and even finding husbands willing to have them. But she also knew that this handful of Christians could have little influence on Confucian China, and that any reform movement she started must be quite separate from religious evangelizing. Therefore, in April 1895 she started the Tianzuhui or Natural Feet Society, first asking European ladies in Shanghai -- the wives of consuls and merchants -- for support. Full of trepidation -- for 'what were we to fight against centuries and millions?' (Little, 'Intimate China', 151) -- they published poems on the subject by two Chinese ladies and then medical tracts. They then reprinted and circulated the influential Suifu appeal by an eminent Chinese official: 'no pain [is] more injurious than the breaking of the bones and sinews... It makes the daughters cry day and night, aching with pain... I do not think much of such respect for ancestors'. Other learned, scholarly tracts followed in classical Chinese with great authority, including one by a descendant of Confucius himself, and were posted as placards by her society all over China (ibid., 154-60). 
With the moral support of her husband and his invaluable Chinese network of important contacts, including viceroys, Alicia Little then braced herself to make personal lecture tours throughout the cities of southern China as well as in Hong Kong and Macau. She used the recently invented Rontgen X-ray slides as well as medical photographs to prove the crippling damage done to girls' growing bones. She spoke to businessmen, high officials, women's drawing-room meetings (with many hundreds of girls and women present), and assemblies of secondary-school boys -- who pledged themselves only to marry an unbound girl. She was immensely heartened by the founding of the first girls' high school in China in 1898 -- all of whose pupils had to be unbound -- and she did not disdain the influence of a supportive inscription on her fan by the aged and much feared viceroy of Canton (Guangzhou), Lord Li Hongzhang. 
For ten years (1896-1906) Alicia Little was the vigorous and eloquent leader of the anti-foot-binding movement. She 'played a more active public role than any of her European contemporaries' (Croll, 23), and 'she, more than any one person, was responsible for the abolition of foot-binding in China' (Hoe, 19). She was even called the second Chinese goddess of mercy by the 'taotai' of Foochow (Fuzhou). After her departure Chinese men and women carried on the movement and eventually it triumphed over the whole of China. She returned to England in 1908, after her husband's death, and lived first at Falmouth, Cornwall, and from 1909 in London. There she supported the British women's suffrage movement, which she had earlier championed in 'Miss Standish'. Her written records and photographs of China at the end of the nineteenth century became a historical source for Western students of Chinese history. She died a childless but beloved, eccentric aunt at her home, 34 Stamford Road, Kensington, London, on 31 July 1926.

Andrews, William (1835-1914), industrial designer, entrepreneur, and politician, was born in Coventry on 17 March 1835, the only son of three children of James and Isabella Andrews. His father was a Scot, a former regular soldier, and small businessman of Coventry. Andrews attended Mr Mander's day school, studying mathematics, astronomy, and land surveying. He was apprenticed in 1848 to Messrs Bray in the designing department. Continuing his studies at the Coventry Schools of Art and Design, he won national prizes including visits to the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Paris Exhibition of 1855. He was appointed manager by Messrs Cash and showed skill in design. As a buyer, he resisted the demands of workers for a price list which would guarantee skilled workers a fair wage in the silk industry. 
During the slump and strike of 1860, which followed the Cobden trade treaty, Andrews went abroad to gather information about the designs and work practices of continental competitors. He worked mainly in Basel, in Switzerland, overcoming initial suspicion about his motives and supplementing his income by teaching English. He travelled the alpine regions mainly on foot, gaining an extensive knowledge of the terrain and the people and improving his linguistic skills in French, German, and Italian. He returned to Coventry in December 1861 with a cosmopolitan outlook and information on modern design and technical improvements in the silk industry, including the power loom. He subsequently maintained that only the ruthless efficiency of the factory system could save the industry. 
Andrews began business on his own account in 1866, using his own capital and his London and continental contacts. Thomas Burbidge joined him, and was a partner 1868-74. Andrews never married, but lived with his sister and her daughter. He was president of the chamber of commerce 1876-7, when a new trade treaty was being negotiated with France, and took part in a delegation of silk manufacturers in their representations to the government. In 1890 he gave up the business, declaring it solvent but unprofitable. 
During a comfortable retirement of twenty-four years, Andrews supported the tory party, opposing Chamberlain's Unionists as too radical. He served on Coventry council 1877-95. After local government reorganization, and standing as an independent candidate, Andrews topped the local election poll in 1890, the other five successful candidates being Liberals. Forthright and amusing, his campaign for efficiency was seen as beneficial and economical by the people. He saved public money by the reorganization of the city's debts, and campaigned successfully for a better water supply, irrigation, and sewage, and for the installation of gas supply and road widening. He used his knowledge of geology, archaeology, and natural habitat to modernize a medieval city handicapped by its past. To the fury of his opponents, his criticism of a new and expensive water supply as open to contamination was vindicated. He was refused office as alderman and magistrate until 1896 by the Liberals. Although he was later offered the office of mayor, he declined it. His support for gas rather than electricity and his opposition to government-funded technical education was regarded as regressive. 
In youth a Congregationalist, Andrews returned to Anglicanism and organized the restoration of the bells and steeple of St Michael's (later Coventry Cathedral). In laying the foundation-stone (1886) he evinced unusual idealism. A fellow of the Geological Society, Andrews contributed numerous articles on historical, archaeological, and geological topics to Coventry newspapers and the 'Journal of the Warwickshire Naturalists and Archaeologists Field Club', of which he was president 1901-4. These included 'Medieval Coventry', 'Ancient earth-works', 'The ribbon trade and French treaties', 'Coal in north east Warwickshire', and 'Chalky boulder clay in central Warwickshire'. His skill as a photographer was recognized when examples of his work were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1890 at the request of the Department of Science and Art. In 1894 he served as General Municipal Charities trustee. Andrews died on 14 May 1914 at his home, Steeplecroft, Daventry Road, Coventry, and was buried at St Michael's. He was regarded as an honest, if unfeeling, master, magistrate, and politician, who used his considerable intelligence and skills to benefit the people of Coventry in an age of improvement.

Gutteridge, Joseph (1816-1899), silk weaver and naturalist, was born on 23 March 1816 in Coventry, the eldest of the three sons of Joseph Gutteridge, a recruiting sergeant, and his first wife, Sarah Shaw. Educated from 1821 in two schools, run by a Quaker woman and Wesleyan preacher respectively, he then went to Berkswell, where his uncle was a schoolmaster. There he made swift progress, particularly in natural science. After further study at Baker, Billing, and Crowe's charity school, where discipline was harsh, he was apprenticed to learn the craft of ribbon weaving about 1829. He found work at the Jacquard loom tiring, but continued to gain intense pleasure from observation of birds and plant life as well as geology and entomology. His invalid mother died and a tyrannical stepmother added to the misery of slumps in trade and riots against the introduction of steam power. However, by this time he was already known as a talented weaver who could also repair clocks and watches (he later made furniture, musical instruments, and even a microscope). He formed a botanical collection, classified according to Dr Withering (1776) and on Linnaean lines. 
Still in indentures, Gutteridge married Sara Bate (died 1855), a poor freethinker, on 5 January 1835 at St John the Baptist Church; they had five children. About this time Gutteridge acquired atheistical opinions from the discussions of the Coventry Mutual Improvement Class, and socialist principles from Robert Owen. During the slumps of 1838-45 his growing family suffered severe privations from unemployment and illness, but he was refused help from a local charity by a clergyman on the grounds of his unbelief. His pride and independence of judgement also alienated him from the trade-union movement. Kindly neighbours saved the family from the workhouse or starvation, and the Manchester Oddfellows helped him to bury his fourth child, who died from smallpox. 
In spite of industrial injury and unorthodox views, Gutteridge made progress in his trade, becoming a foreman and then working at home on an 'a la bar' loom. A visit to the Great Exhibition of 1851 revived his interest in the applied arts and in natural science, particularly foreign botanical specimens. His wife's death from tuberculosis in December 1855 drew him to spiritualism: on 17 May 1857 Gutteridge married his second wife, Mary Hendon, a Wesleyan, at Bedworth. With an employer he worked on improvements to the Jacquard loom for the manufacture of brocaded ribbons, but received no benefit from the patent. He took a minor but active part in the strike and lock-out of 1860-61 which followed the Cobden trade treaty: he hated the factory system which ensued, but soon adopted firm Liberal views. 
Gutteridge was a pioneer of silk brocades in five colours for exhibition, and of portraits and views in silk. In September 1867 he was delegated as a working man to visit the Paris Exhibition and Switzerland for the Society of Arts, publishing an account in the society's 'Reports of Artisans... Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867' (1867, 141-3). He then worked for Thomas Stevens, celebrated for bookmarks and pictures in silk, giving exhibitions of his craft in Yorkshire in August 1870. Gutteridge was held in respect and gave evidence during a legal dispute over the needle-loom patent in 1874. 
Old age and a decline in the Coventry silk industry brought Gutteridge close to destitution by 1891, when John Cox of the 'Coventry Herald' encouraged him to co-operate in a series of autobiographical articles, based on a diary which was also the source of his autobiography, 'Lights and Shadows in the Life of an Artisan' (1893). A copy was presented to W. E. Gladstone, and there were favourable reviews. A gift from the royal bounty fund and the provision of an annuity by friends followed. Having regained his religious faith through a study of natural science, he presented his extensive and well-catalogued natural history collection to his native city in 1896. 
Gutteridge died at his home, 18 Yardley Street, Coventry, on 4 November 1899, following a stroke. A memorial service in the Great Meeting-House stressed his example to the young. His autobiography remains an impressive source for the history of the silk industry, working-class life, and urban development during the industrial revolution.

Hawkins, Benjamin Waterhouse (1807-1894), natural history artist and sculptor, was born on 8 February 1807 in Devonshire Street, London, the son of Thomas Hawkins (1777/8-1811), artist, and his wife, Louisa Anna ('b'. 1781/2), daughter of William Waterhouse, plantation owner in Jamaica. Educated at St Aloysius College, he studied sculpture under William Behnes. On 4 July 1826 he married, at St John's, Hampstead, Mary Selina (1804-1880), daughter of Thomas William Green; they had four daughters and a son. On 23 April 1836, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, he bigamously married Frances Louisa (1811-1884), daughter of John Keenan, artist; they had two daughters. He remarried her, in a civil ceremony, on 17 May 1883. His second wife was a portrait painter who exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1839 and 1868. 
Hawkins (who styled himself Waterhouse Hawkins or B. Waterhouse Hawkins) specialized in natural history subjects and displayed a number of paintings of animals at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, and elsewhere from 1832 to 1849. He had access to the collections of the Zoological Society of London, the Hunterian Museum of Comparative Anatomy, and the Natural History department of the British Museum. His earliest known scientific commission was to prepare the plates for 'Illustrations of Indian Zoology' (1830-35), edited by John Edward Gray. He contributed forty-nine plates, illustrating fish and reptiles, to Charles Darwin's 'The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Beagle' (pts 4 and 5, 1838-43). In 1842-7 he produced a series of studies of living animals from the menagerie of the earl of Derby at Knowsley. He was also responsible for the plates of birds and animals for 'The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Sulphur' (1843-4), edited by Richard Brinsley Hinds, and for 'Graphic Illustrations of Animals Showing their Utility to Man', published by Thomas Varty about 1845. Elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1847, a member of the Society of Arts in 1848, and a fellow of the Geological Society in 1854, he was an assistant superintendent and exhibitor at the 1851 Great Exhibition. 
In September 1852 Hawkins was appointed director of the fossil department of the Crystal Palace, under reconstruction at Sydenham, south London, and in collaboration with Richard Owen began to construct the first major public display of the progression of life on earth, comprising life-sized iron and stone models of fourteen genera of extinct animals, together with reconstructions of fossil plants and geological strata. He held a dinner party on 31 December 1853 in the mould of the largest model, of the dinosaur 'Iguanodon'. The Crystal Palace work was terminated in the summer of 1855, with the display incomplete, but it made a significant contribution to popular understanding of the nature of the development of life on earth and now provides an important insight into palaeontological knowledge in the mid-1850s. 
Hawkins next undertook a variety of freelance commissions including animal sculptures for the gardens of James Bateman at Biddulph Grange, Staffordshire (1859-62), educational wall charts for the Department of Science and Art, drawings of ape and human skeletons for the frontispiece to T. H. Huxley's 'Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature' (1863), works on the artistic anatomy of the horse (1865), cattle and sheep (1867), and the dog and deer (1868), as well as contributions to the 'Journal of the Royal Society of Arts' on techniques of art reproduction. He also gave popular lectures on natural history. 
Hawkins travelled to the United States in 1868 and was commissioned to create a similar display of models of extinct animals in Central Park, New York. He travelled to Philadelphia to work on the latest fossil discoveries at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, where he moulded fossil bones of the dinosaur 'Hadrosaurus foulkii' to create a mounted facsimile for display. This was 'the first fully articulated dinosaur skeleton display in the world' (Bramwell and Peck, 79), and on being put on display in Philadelphia in November 1868 it attracted nearly 100,000 visitors. By early 1871 he had completed numerous moulds and some finished models. The New York project was abandoned, however, following the destruction of the work in May 1871 on the orders of a new, corrupt, city administration. He then undertook lecture tours in the USA, promoting anti-Darwinian views. In 1873 the geologist Arnold Guyot arranged for him to lecture at the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University), which awarded him an honorary degree in June 1874. After visiting Britain he returned to the USA early in 1875 and began a series of seventeen oil paintings of prehistoric scenes, based on fossil evidence, for display at Princeton. A further mould of the hadrosaurus was created for the American Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1875, and in 1879 was transferred to the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh. 
Hawkins returned to Britain permanently in April 1879, and lived in relative obscurity, his membership of learned societies having lapsed. For the last five years of his life he suffered from the effects of a stroke. He died from a combination of that and gangrene of the feet, at 60 Erpingham Road, Putney, London, on 27 January 1894 and was buried at Putney Lower Common cemetery. His dinosaur models at Crystal Palace were restored in 2002.

Buckley, Arabella Burton (1840-1929), popularizer of science and writer, was born on 24 October 1840 in Brighton, the daughter of John Wall Buckley, vicar of St Mary's, Paddington Green, and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1889), daughter of Thomas Burton; Henry Burton Buckley, first Baron Wrenbury (1845-1935), was her brother. Little is known of her education and early life. An authoritative popularizer of science, and from 1864 to 1875 secretary to Sir Charles Lyell (for whose entry in the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica' she wrote the expert's addendum), she was personally familiar with the leading scientists and scientific theories of her day. She lectured on natural science from 1876 until 1888, was editor of Mary Somerville's 'Connexion of the Physical Sciences' (1877) and Heinrich Leutemann's 'Animals from Life' (1887), and produced a set of botanical tables for the use of junior students (1876). In her own first book, 'A Short History of Natural Science' (1876), she recalled that she 'often felt very forcibly how many important facts and generalizations of science, which are of great value... in giving a true estimate of life and its conditions, [were] totally unknown to the majority of otherwise well-educated persons' (pp. vii-viii). Her 'Short History' was intended 'to supply that modest amount of scientific information which everyone ought to possess, while, at the same time... form a useful groundwork for those who wish afterwards to study any special branch of science' (p. viii) and as such was praised by Charles Darwin. On 6 March 1884 she married Thomas Fisher MD (1819/20-1895), a widower twenty years her senior. 
Although Arabella Buckley also wrote a 'History of England for Beginners' (1887), traditional history never gave full scope to her distinctive penchant for narrative, which was better exercised in her books retelling the story of evolution. Grounded in evolutionary theory and in all aspects of the new geology, she re-created this knowledge in two popular books whose narratives are highly imaginative, 'Life and her Children' (1881) and 'Winners in Life's Race' (1883). In them Buckley presented seven divisions of life: 'Life and her Children' covers the first six, from the amoebas to the insects, and 'Winners in Life's Race' is entirely devoted to the seventh, the 'great backboned family'. 
Buckley was one of a small number of nineteenth-century Darwinians who realized the deficiencies in Darwin's thinking with regard to the development of moral qualities in the animal kingdom, set out in his discussion of 'social instincts' in 'The Descent of Man' (1871). Darwin had observed the competitive advantage species can gain from a well-developed social instinct but had difficulty in explaining its evolution, particularly with respect to parental affections for their offspring. Far from being daunted by this aspect of evolution, Buckley made parents' care for their offspring central to her books on evolution and continued Darwin's observations with far greater emphasis on mutuality. For her the 'raison d'etre' for evolution was not just the preservation of life, but the development of altruism as well. 
Buckley's work is concurrent with Karl Kessler's 'On the law of mutual aid' (1880), the lecture which stimulated Peter Kropotkin to re-examine Darwin. Kessler died in 1881, the year that saw the publication of Buckley's 'Life and her Children'; it then took Kropotkin ten years to challenge Thomas Henry Huxley over the importance of mutual aid in the pages of 'Nineteenth Century', and another ten to formulate his classic 'Mutual Aid: a Factor in Evolution' (1902). Meanwhile, Buckley's last book, 'Moral Teachings of Science' (1891), was devoted to this idea and written to unite science and philosophy -- to study morality from 'within outward' and 'without inward' (p. 4). For Buckley, 'these [were] not really two, but only different methods of arriving at one result, namely, the knowledge of laws by which we and all the rest of nature are governed' (p. 5). 
Buckley was deeply aware of the nature of science writing and realized that science, though based in fact or experiment, was transmitted as a literary construction. Two other books, 'The Fairy-Land of Science' (1879, reissued in a number of late nineteenth-century editions) and its sequel, 'Through Magic Glasses' (1890), demonstrate her skill at telling the stories of science. In 'Fairy-Land' Buckley generated interest in her scientific subjects by borrowing the language of fairy stories and wizardry to reinforce her ultimate belief that the wonders of science not only paralleled but surpassed the wonders of fairyland. In its sequel, 'Through Magic Glasses', she focused more closely on what childlike eyes can see, calling on the help of the telescope, stereoscope, photographic camera, and microscope, and a fictional guide, a magician into whose chamber the reader immediately enters and through whose eyes the world is viewed. Her last work showed the same concern with vision and the visible and was written for Cassell's series 'Eyes and No Eyes' (1901-24). Buckley died of influenza at her home, 3 Boburg Terrace, Sidmouth, Devon, on 9 February 1929.

Ackermann, George (1803-1891), publisher and artist, was born in London on 29 January 1803, the second surviving son of Rudolph Ackermann (1764-1834) and Martha, 'nee' Massey (1769-1811). By nature quiet, gentle, and something of a dreamer, he was nevertheless an obedient son and began a long and active business career by joining his father's business as publisher of books and prints at 101 Strand in London. Shortly after his twenty-third birthday he was sent to Mexico City where he established an outlet for the sale of Ackermann publications in Spanish. Two of his watercolour views of the city were published as aquatints in 1826. He travelled to Guatemala where he opened another outlet, and it was here that he fell in love in 1828 with Jeanette (Netty) Haefkins (1812-1899), the sixteen-year-old daughter of the Dutch consul. Together they climbed the 13,000 foot Volcan de Agua, where Ackermann carved Netty's name on the summit. When, however, he was summoned home in 1829 because of his father's poor health, Netty's father refused them permission to exchange letters. On her return to Europe in 1832 they met again, and they were married in Leerdam, the Netherlands, in 1835. They had seven children, and their family homes in the London area were at various times in Camberwell, Brixton, and Paddington. 
In the meantime, upon his return from Guatemala, Ackermann had brought with him an important collection of plants which he presented to the botanic garden in Sloane Street, Chelsea, one new specimen being named by the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew 'Epiphyllum Ackermanii'. On his father's retirement in 1832 he formed a partnership with two of his younger brothers at 96 Strand. Ackermann & Co. published prints of the early railways, botanical and sporting subjects, games, embossed maps, panoramas, travel books with lithographed illustrations, drawing books, and the popular annual 'Forget-me-Not'. The company received the royal appointment as 'Book and Printsellers to HM Queen Victoria and HRH Prince Albert'. In 1839 it published the first manual of photography, 'Ackermann's Photogenic Drawing Apparatus'; in 1841 the classic 'Art of Engraving' by T. H. Fielding; and in 1843 two prints of a remarkable prototype 'ariel carriage' designed by the pioneers of flight Henson and Stringfellow. A short-lived financial crisis in 1843, however, required the planned publication of the magnificent 'Orchidaceae of Mexico and Guatemala', which contained several of Ackermann's drawings, to be brought out by another publisher. Ackermann & Co. later published two hundred marine prints and two important colour-plate books of costume: 'Travels in North America' (1843-4), portraying Native American tribal clothing, and 'The Clans of Scotland' (1845-7), fixing the tartan image of the clans. In 1851 Ackermann & Co. took a stand at the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London, and published what have become the definitive views of the Crystal Palace after Brannon and McNevin. In 1855, however, the brothers agreed to end their partnership, though George continued to trade as Ackermann & Co. at 106 Strand until 1861. 
In 1862, at the age of fifty-nine, Ackermann emigrated to North America with Netty and their four youngest children. Initially bound for Portland, Maine, their ship was driven by a storm up the St Lawrence River and the family disembarked at Quebec. Ackermann bought a small homestead in the pioneer settlement of Madoc in Upper Canada (Ontario), though he quickly abandoned farming to teach drawing in a succession of small towns in Ontario, including Belleville where he developed a special concern for the hearing impaired. Soon after his arrival in Canada he set himself the task of illustrating a classification of the wild flowers of Upper Canada, drawn up by the Harvard botanist Asa Gray. In search of new specimens he left the Great Lakes to move to the Atlantic maritime province of Prince Edward Island in 1876. In all, he painted over four hundred botanical studies and, in addition, twenty topographical views of early Canadian townships which have proved to be of historical interest. These Canadian paintings came to light only in 1994 in Saskatchewan. Ackermann left Prince Edward Island in 1887 to live with his son in Chicago and it was there he died, on 22 August 1891, at the Marine Hospital, Lake View. He was survived by his wife and five children.

Gray, Elizabeth (1831-1924), fossil collector, was born on 21 February 1831 at the Burns Arms inn, Alloway, near Ayr, the second child of Thomas Anderson, innkeeper, and his wife, Mary Hamilton Young. She began her education at a small private school in Girvan, after her father moved to Enoch to become a farmer. At the age of fifteen, she was sent to a boarding-school in Glasgow for a year, before returning home in order to help look after her six younger brothers. Her father, a keen naturalist and collector known to Scottish geologists, encouraged her interest in the local Girvan fossils. 
At the age of twenty-four Elizabeth met Robert Gray (1825-1887), a Glasgow bank inspector, on an ornithological visit to the Ayrshire coast. They were married on 8 April 1856, and continued to make excursions to Girvan each summer, recording the results in the journals of the Natural History Society of Glasgow. Collecting the rich Ayrshire Palaeozoic assemblages became an absorbing family pursuit that was continued every year despite the growing number of children. In 1874 the family moved to Edinburgh when Robert Gray accepted a new post, and Elizabeth Gray then began her co-operation with the many palaeontologists who described her Ordovician fossils. 
Throughout her life Elizabeth Gray preferred to devote her energies to discovering fossils and later her objective became the extension of faunal lists. She trained all her family in the practical methods of collecting and documenting specimens. Her successive collections were acquired by the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow (1866); the Royal Scottish Museum (1889); the Geological Survey ('c'.1890); the Sedgwick Museum (1907-10); and the British Museum (Natural History), London; together they form a unique resource of Palaeozoic fossils. 
In 1900 Elizabeth Gray was made an honorary member of the Geological Society of Glasgow for the contribution her collections had made to geological literature. The Murchison geological fund was awarded to her in 1903 in recognition of her skilful services to geological science. A woman of considerable character, determination, and resourcefulness, with a phenomenally retentive memory, she was renowned for her extensive collecting in the Girvan district, which she carried on until the autumn of 1923. She died of heart failure at 59 George Street, her Edinburgh home, on 11 February 1924, after packing a batch of fossils the previous day. An obituarist, J. Horne, described her as 'one of the most successful fossil collectors in Scottish geology'.

Townsend, John (1760-1832), Bow Street runner, was born in the Middlesex Hospital and educated at St Clement Danes school, to both of which charitable institutions he later became a subscriber. As a young man he frequented the Bow Street court, making notes on the cases, and Sir John Fielding, the chief magistrate, appointed him an officer of the court in 1781. In addition to attendance on the magistrates, he was responsible for the serving of writs and for criminal investigations and arrests within the metropolitan area. He was responsible for the first detachment of prisoners to be sent to Botany Bay in 1789, and he recorded that in 1786 he travelled to Dunkirk to arrest four men who were later hanged. As he also told the parliamentary committee on the state of the police of the metropolis in 1816, it was he who arrested the famous highwayman Jerry Abershaw in 1795 and also Broughton, who had robbed the York mail in 1794. His services as detective and security man were also in demand by private hire within and beyond London. He found regular employment at places as diverse as the Bank of England and Vauxhall Gardens, and built up a reputation for efficiency based on a detailed knowledge of the criminal fraternity and for his discretion and loyalty to his employers. 
In 1792, following an attack on George III, Townsend was given responsibility for the security of the royal family during their public engagements, and for these services, which he continued to perform until 1831, he received $200 per annum. He became a favourite of George III and of the prince of Wales, later George IV, whom he attended at Carlton House and accompanied to Brighton for many years. He enjoyed what was evidently a licensed familiarity with both monarchs, and his last public employment was to attend William IV on his coronation in September 1831. He provided protection for Lord Eldon, the lord chancellor, during the corn law riots of 1815, and Eldon's testimony to his qualities was one of several records in contemporary memoirs. 
Townsend was a principal witness before the parliamentary select committee inquiring into policing in the metropolis in 1816, and his distinctive character is evident in his testimony, in which he clearly enjoyed expatiating on his successes, and his familiarity with those he called 'the first people of the nation'. In his evidence he told the committee that in his early days 'we never had an execution where we did not grace the unfortunate gibbet with between ten and forty criminals'. He expressed firm opposition to the system of blood money, whereby police officers were paid $40 for a successful capital conviction, because he believed it made juries unwilling to convict; he argued that police officers should be remunerated only by increased salaries. Short and corpulent, he had a powerful personality which, it is evident, made a strong impression on both the criminal classes and the ruling classes. He became known as a 'public character' early in his career, and appeared in caricatures over a period of forty years, frequently identified by his smart dress with a characteristic wide-brimmed hat, in a style favoured by his master, the prince of Wales, and by his addiction to the flash or cant slang of the criminal and sporting classes. He remained an officer of Bow Street for over fifty years. He lived in the Strand for a number of years, but it was at his home in Pimlico that he died on 10 July 1832. He was survived by his wife, Ann.

Chilton, William (1815-1855), printer and freethinker, was baptized in the parish of St Philip and St Jacob, Bristol, on 2 July 1815, the son of William Chilton, a tin-plate worker, and Mary Ann Chilton, a dressmaker. From 1829 to 1836 he was apprenticed to a printer, William Henry Somerton; in 1841 he returned to live with his sixty-year-old widowed mother (his father having died some time before 1829). Chilton worked on the reformist 'Bristol Mercury' all his life, first as a compositor and eventually as a reader. 
Chilton was a doctrinaire atheist; indeed G. J. Holyoake considered him 'the only absolute atheist I have known' ('Sixty Years', 1.142). A member of the Bristol branch of the Owenite movement, Chilton abhorred the attempt of the Central Board of the Association of All Classes of All Nations to register the Owenites as 'Rational Religionists' and play 'the 'whore' with the priests' (Chilton to G. J. Holyoake, 26 Dec 1841, Holyoake Collection no. 22, Co-operative Union, Manchester). Accordingly he resigned from the movement and stopped lecturing in the Hall of Science in Bristol. In 1841 he and Charles Southwell founded the inflammatory penny weekly 'Oracle of Reason' (1841-3), which refuted God's existence and undermined the spiritual props of the undemocratic state. As libelling the scriptures was tantamount to sedition, Southwell was gaoled for blasphemy. Chilton, remaining as sub-editor, invited Holyoake to become the figurehead editor, and became editor himself only in June 1843 after Holyoake and his successor Thomas Paterson had been imprisoned. The 'Oracle''s scurrilous tone had even the veteran agitator Richard Carlile denouncing the 'blackguard' Southwell and pronouncing Chilton 'no better' (Carlile to Paterson, 11 Dec 1842, Holyoake Collection no. 88, Co-operative Union, Manchester). 
Chilton accused the clergy and gentry of perverting science to support the 'status quo', and in the 'Oracle' he turned zoology and geology into street weaponry. Attacking the 'Genesis' myth of creation was 'de rigueur' in ultra-radical prints, but Chilton's series entitled 'Theory of regular gradation' (meaning the progressive 'evolution' of life) took this to extremes. The 48-part series (begun by Southwell, but principally by Chilton) moved in a ramshackle way from planetary formation and the chemical origin of life to a monkey ancestry for mankind. Chilton saw life's development as a 'modification through circumstance' in line with the Owenites' environmental determinism. His materials were necessarily cannibalized, partly from Robert Chambers's miscellanies and Charles Lyell's refutation of Lamarckism in 'Principles of Geology'. 
Chilton's campaigns for gaoled atheist and Chartist friends, and his publication of Strauss's 'Life of Jesus' and other subversive literature, had equally to be squeezed around his ten-hour working day as a compositor. He would camp in his works for weeks on end, with no 'time to eat, to sleep, and certainly not to think' ('The Reasoner', 3, 1847, 608). 'Oracle' articles were set up in type without copy, and their scorching tone told of an activist who thought on his feet. His reductionist biology was laced with cynicism, but his propagandist use of transmutation set the trend for militant atheists from Emma Martin to John Watts. 
Part of Chilton's meagre earnings went to support his mother. During Holyoake's trial Chilton met a cooper's daughter, Mary Ann Morris ('b'. 1819/20); they married on 26 September 1843 and had two children, Kate ('b'. 1846) and Lucy ('b'. 1848). 
Chilton muted his approach on switching to Holyoake's less blustery 'Movement' in 1844. Becoming more familiar with middle-class literature, he turned Lyell's geochronology to anti-scriptural ends and dissected the biblical glossing of geology attempted by Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland. In 'The Movement' and 'The Reasoner' (a paper he part managed) Chilton noted that the anonymous 'Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation' (1844) reworked similar evolutionary ground, although its higher design was far removed from his necessitarian materialism. About this time he began republishing rationalist books in penny numbers in his 'Library of Reason'; twenty-three volumes appeared in all, the costs being defrayed by J. W. Birch and the publisher Henry Hetherington. 
Such activism did not preclude Chilton's being made a freeman of the city of Bristol in 1848, for which he was eligible as a former apprentice serving a trade. He co-ordinated Holyoake's free-thought lecture tour in 1847-8 and in 1852 sat on the central council at the conference of secularists at Manchester. However, his health had deteriorated, and he died, probably of an arterial aneurysm, at Bristol on 28 May 1855, aged only forty; he was buried there on 2 June.

Skeaping, John Rattenbury (1901-1980), sculptor and teacher of sculpture, was born on 9 June 1901 at South Woodford, Essex, the second son of Kenneth Mathieson Skeaping (1856-1946), a painter and book illustrator, and his wife, Sarah Ann, 'nee' Rattenbury ('b'. 1867). When he was thirteen he studied sculpture for a year at Blackheath School of Art, London, then from 1915 to 1917 attended the school of art at Goldsmiths' College; thereafter he attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts (1917-19) and the Royal Academy Schools (1919-20). 'In the two years I was there I won every prize that was open to sculpture students' (J. Skeaping, 46). In 1920 he won the Royal Academy gold medal and travelling scholarship, which enabled him to visit Rome, Siena, and Florence. Four years later he won the 'prix de Rome' for sculpture and returned to Rome, where he learned marble carving from Giovanni Ardini, a professional mason. In Italy, Skeaping met Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975), who had been runner-up for the 'prix de Rome', and they were married at the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, on 13 May 1925. In his autobiography he recalled: 'Barbara had a strong influence on me. She was a great admirer of Henry Moore and all things modern. I started to change the style of my own work' (ibid., 71). 
The couple returned to England at the end of 1926 and took rented accommodation in St Anne's Terrace, St John's Wood, London. Skeaping and Hepworth held a joint exhibition of their recent carvings and drawings in their St John's Wood studio in December 1927, and then at Tooth's Gallery, Bond Street, London, and the Alex Reid and Lefevre Gallery, Glasgow, in spring 1928. Both shows sold out and improved their financial situations. Skeaping and Hepworth were early exponents of direct carving, and Skeaping was probably the first sculptor in Britain to pierce a hole through a stone carving ('c'.1930). His sculpture at this time included animal and figure subjects influenced by non-European traditions. Wedgwood commissioned Skeaping in 1927 to produce a series of ten small animal groups for a fee of $10 per animal, to be cast in glazed coloured ceramics; he produced 'Deer', 'Kangaroo', 'Buffalo', 'Sea Lion', 'Monkeys', 'Antelope', 'Bison', 'Duiker', 'Polar Bear', and 'Tiger and Buck', which were commercially very successful and popular. 
Early in 1928 Skeaping and Hepworth moved to 7 The Mall Studios, Parkhill Road, Hampstead, close to Henry Moore, where they became part of a group of avant-garde British artists. Their son, Paul, was born in August 1929. Skeaping was a member of the London Group from 1928 to 1934 and of the Seven & Five Society in 1932, and he taught at the Central School of Arts from 1930 to 1939. He separated from Hepworth in 1931 and they were divorced in 1933. In the early 1930s Skeaping befriended Julian Huxley, secretary to the Zoological Society of London, who asked the artist to paint a fresco of animals on the walls of the new restaurant there. Huxley was also responsible for placing a large carved wooden horse by Skeaping at Whipsnade Zoo (now in the Tate collection). In 1933 Skeaping provided the illustrations for 'The Whipsnade Animal Book', and this reinforced his reputation as an animalier. 
Skeaping married Morwenna Ward on 7 April 1934, and they had three sons -- twins Colin and Christopher ('b'. 1944) and Nicholas ('b'. 1947). Skeaping and his wife left London and went to live on Dartmoor; this allowed him to combine his love of animals with carving the local stone, granite. From 1940 to 1945 Skeaping served in the intelligence corps as an official war artist and spent a short spell with the SAS: 'Even in the army, the style with which he wore his beret was distinctive and at first sight made him look more like a handsome Basque gypsy than a soldier. His irreverence was profound, and of course a great tonic to his colleagues. (Sir John Astor, memorial service address, 24 April 1980)' He taught sculpture at the Royal College of Art from 1948 and was professor of sculpture at the college from 1953 to 1959. During 1949-50 he worked in Mexico, where he studied the pottery techniques of the ancient Mexicans. He was made an associate of the Royal Academy in 1950 and Royal Academician in 1960. In 1959 he left Britain to live in the Camargue, where he was surrounded by horses. His marriage to Morwenna was dissolved in 1969, and on 6 June that year he married Margery Scott in Marseilles. 
Skeaping wrote several instructional books, beginning with 'Animal Drawing' in 1936; this was followed by 'How to Draw Horses' in 1941 and 'How to Draw Dogs' in 1961. His more personal writings were 'The Big Tree of Mexico' (1952) and his autobiography, 'Drawn from Life' (1977). In the 1930s and 1940s he concentrated on animal and figure sculpture, and only later focused on equine subject matter. During the 1960s and 1970s Skeaping was much in demand making bronze portraits of champion racehorses -- for example, 'Hyperion' for Lord Derby in 1961 and 'Brigadier Gerard' for John Hislop in 1972. His sculpture may also be found in a variety of architectural settings; examples include stone corbels (1933) for Ashmore church, Dorset; wooden relief panels (1953) for the United Nations building, New York; and a black limestone relief (1958) over the main entrance of the New College of Science, Kensington, London. 
Skeaping was given a retrospective exhibition of bronzes at Arthur Ackermann's Gallery, London, in 1979, and this show travelled to the National Museum of Racing, Saratoga, New York. Skeaping died in London on 5 March 1980, and the Ackermann Gallery mounted a scholarly retrospective exhibition in 1991 which helped to restore his reputation as a pioneer of direct carving. His work may be found in many public collections, among them the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the British Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Tate collection. The Hon. J. J. Astor, a long-standing friend of the artist, described Skeaping as 'unconventional... ubiquitous... and basically elusive. He was the best of companions: enthusiastic, sensitive, observant, sharp without being malicious, and his judgments were always worth hearing. Convention meant little to him, and never dictated his way of life. He seemed to be sustained and motivated by some inner vitality and gaiety, which both protected him and adapted him for many backgrounds. He was equally at home with primitive Mexican Indians, working with trainers at Newmarket or with herdsmen in France. (Skeaping and Hely-Hutchinson, 70)'

Southwell, Charles (1814-1860), freethinker and journalist, was born in London, the thirty-third (and last) child of a piano maker, William Southwell ('c'.1758-1825/6), and the only child of Fanny, his former servant and third wife, who was at least thirty years his junior. William Southwell had taken out early patents in the search for a small upright piano suitable for domestic use. At school Charles was rebellious and intractable but read widely. After his father's death, the eleven year old became a piano finisher at Broadwood & Sons, having rejected the more genteel occupation of a tuner which his brothers had arranged for him. A copy of Timothy Dwight's 'Sermons' (1828), lent by a pious fellow workman, led Southwell to follow his father in repudiating Christianity. 
Southwell abandoned factory work during the reform crisis of the early 1830s. He opened an ultra-radical bookshop in Westminster, where he participated in opening a 'rational school' and defended the seditious press from clerical attacks. His youthful marriage to Mary Seaford around 1832 was marked by separation and mutual infidelity (on Southwell's side with his wife's aunt, in a relationship which raised accusations of bigamy). Unhappily reunited, the couple ran the shop, which failed after two years when Mary became terminally ill. Following her wishes, when she died ('c'.1835) Southwell watched a surgeon open her body to ensure that she was dead and remove her heart as an anatomical specimen. Only the intervention of the police prevented a riot. 
Hoping to make a new start, Southwell joined the British Legion in 1835 to fight as a royalist mercenary in Spain against the Carlists. He returned two years later, half-starved and nearly penniless, to work once more at Broadwoods. Attracted to radical debate rather than making pianos, Southwell created a sensation with his open-air addresses on Kennington Common. In 1840 the central board of the Association of All Classes of All Nations (AACAN) confirmed him as a socialist missionary, first in London, then in Birmingham. However, Southwell chafed at Robert Owen's attempts to curb uninhibited attacks on theology, and he resigned in 1841, soon after bringing the campaign to Bristol. Together with William Chilton and John Field, Southwell began the 'Oracle of Reason', a penny weekly advocating atheism. Aggressively confrontational, the 'Oracle' featured a pro-evolutionary series (begun by Southwell, continued by Chilton) using science to prove the bestial origins of the human race. Southwell's antisemitic diatribe against the 'Bible', 'The Jew book', led to his arrest in 1842. In one of the most celebrated blasphemy trials of the century he was fined $100 and sentenced to a year in prison. 
After his release Southwell refused to resume the 'Oracle' editorship, much to the annoyance of his associates, launching instead the more temperate (but short-lived) 'Investigator'. He campaigned for free thought in Edinburgh and especially in London, where in 1844 he opened the Paragon Hall and Coffee House in Lambeth. The dampness of the rooms, combined with Southwell's ambitions as an actor, led him to sell up in 1848 and take a lease on the Canterbury Theatre. This failed almost immediately, and Southwell returned to London where he managed a lecture hall at Blackfriars. 
Throughout this period, Southwell lived with a Mrs Gordon (formerly Mrs Rowen), a married woman who managed his finances. Deeply affected by her death from uterine cancer in 1849, and harassed by the Inland Revenue which fined him $150 for serving alcohol without a licence, Southwell prepared to sail for the United States. However, freethinkers in Manchester convinced him to take over their Hall of Science, which he did with great (though temporary) success, baiting evangelicals, organizing displays of religious idolatry and issuing the weekly 'Lancashire Beacon'. After this 'vain attempt to revolutionize Lancashire' (Southwell, 98), he returned in 1850 to London, where he lectured on theological and literary subjects. He became convinced of the futility of debating abstract questions such as the existence of a deity, although he continued to denounce Christianity and the church. 
Southwell was a brilliant platform speaker, free thought's most electrifying and entertaining advocate in the 1830s and 1840s. Reckless and impulsive, he drew huge working- and lower-middle-class crowds with his verbal pyrotechnics and outrageous vulgarity. He published dozens of pamphlets, including an attack on marriage (1840), and revealing 'Confessions' (1850), written to counter scurrilous diatribes by former associate and fellow blasphemer Thomas Paterson. Southwell also worked with William Chilton, Robert Cooper, Walter Cooper, George Jacob Holyoake, and Lloyd Jones, but quarrelled with all of them and hated ties with any organized movement. As radicals sought respectability and institutional security after 1848, Southwell's racy individualism looked increasingly out of place. 
In 1855 Southwell emigrated to Melbourne, where he lectured, engaged in radical politics, and acted in his favourite role, Shylock. In the following year he went on a theatrical tour, first to Sydney and then to Auckland, where he began lecturing after the company folded. Southwell ridiculed missionary attempts to protect the lands and rights of Aboriginal peoples, whom he dismissed as racially inferior barbarians. In 1856 he started a weekly newspaper, the 'Auckland Examiner', which ran for four years before closing through financial difficulties. Once again penniless, Southwell died of consumption on 7 August 1860 at Wynyardton Villa, Symonds Street, Auckland, leaving a widow, and was buried in the Symonds Street cemetery in Auckland.

Buckman, Sydney Savory (1860-1929), geologist and palaeontologist, was born on 3 April 1860 at Dollar Street, Cirencester, the eldest son of James Buckman (1814-1884), naturalist, and his wife, Julia, 'nee' Savory (1834-1865). After his father lost his job as professor of botany and geology at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, in 1863, the family moved to Bradford Abbas, Dorset, one of the most richly fossiliferous districts in the world. His mother died two years later; thus Buckman's main influences were his naturalist father and Dorset's palaeontological riches. 
Between 1871 and 1879 Buckman attended Sherborne School. In 1877, while still at Sherborne, he read a paper on fossil 'Astarte (Bivalvia)' to the Dorset Field Club. The paper was awarded the club's prize, and was published in 1878. First intentions were that Buckman should enter the church, but with the encouragement of his grandfather John Savory (1800-1871), a London pharmaceutical chemist, Buckman set off in 1879 to study at the Chemischen Laboratoriums, run by the Fresenius family in Wiesbaden, Germany. However, the following year Buckman returned to England, where he spent the next two years studying to become a land agent under one of his father's former students, Robert Holland (1829-1893), estate agent of Norton Hill and Mobberley, Cheshire. The two years were also spent courting Holland's daughter, Maude Mary (1860-1946), whom Buckman married on 14 June 1882. 
In 1881 Buckman published his first paper in the 'Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society'. In it he disagreed with his father's views about the age of sands at Yeovil and the value of fossil 'zones' in dating such rocks. The following year he was elected fellow of the Geological Society. It was also in 1882 that Buckman began farming at Upper Hampden, Gloucestershire, a profession he abandoned in March 1886 after being defeated by the great agricultural depression. He now started a new, but precarious, career as a novelist, commercial writer, and dealer in fossils, in order to support his scientific work on Jurassic rocks. 
Buckman started work on a Palaeontographical Society monograph on the ammonites of the Inferior Oolite in 1887. In 1889 the first of his critically important papers was published, demonstrating that southern English sands of Toarcian to Aalenian age were diachronous. It remains the classic demonstration of this phenomenon, where identical strata distinguished by their fossil assemblages differ in age from place to place. In 1893 his paper on the subdivision and detailed dating of the Inferior Oolite of Dorset followed. This broke new ground in showing how precisely such condensed and eroded rocks could be subdivided, and how necessary it was to separate the stratal record from the chronological. Buckman was the first to show how precisely time could be revealed from fossils. The first of his pioneering studies of homeomorphy in brachiopods followed in 1901. 
In 1904 Buckman suffered a breakdown in health, caused by over-exertion as a cycling geologist. He moved to Thame, Oxfordshire, in order to be closer to scientists based in London and Oxford. However, the move brought a loss of contact with the fieldwork which had been so critical to the quality of his work earlier. This, and the ever-increasing multiplicity of names he was giving to ammonites, caused the council of the Palaeontographical Society to abandon his monograph in 1907. In 1909 he commenced publication of 'Type Ammonites', initially those from Yorkshire, as a private venture without interference from referees. The work reached seven volumes by the time of his death. 
Buckman's scientific work before 1904 was of a quality quite unequalled for its time, but its worth has only recently become clear. His later work, as an early and 'consultant palaeontologist' largely outside government or academic circles, was done in too much isolation from other professional scientists. Buckman was a man of extraordinary breadth, a good linguist, and much interested in political and social reform, having been an advocate of 'rational dress' for women cyclists. In 1910 he published his minor, if forgotten, classic, 'Marriage, Mating and the Status of Women'. 
Buckman's work polarized geological opinion, but he was awarded the Lyell medal of the London Geological Society in 1913. In 1914, now busy as a consultant, he was offered a post with the Geological Survey of Canada, but the First World War prevented his appointment. Buckman died at his home, Southfield, Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, on 26 February 1929. He left only $1474 and asked to be cremated, with no religious service of any kind. In 1930 his widow was awarded a civil-list pension for his services to geology. In 1933 his ashes were spread over Thorncombe Beacon, Dorset.

Vevers, (Henry) Gwynne (1916-1988), marine biologist and intelligence officer, was born on 13 November 1916 at Girvan, Ayrshire, the elder son of Geoffrey Marr Vevers and Catherine Rigby, 'nee' Andrews, from Ayrshire. Gwynne Vevers's zoological and popularizing bent were dictated by his education and by his father's interests. Geoffrey Marr Vevers (1890-1970) was a helminthologist at the London School of Tropical Medicine and an honorary parasitologist at London Zoo from 1919; as superintendent of the zoo in 1921 he was instrumental in the acquisition of Whipsnade. As an avowed popularizer and as a communist fellow-traveller -- he raised medical aid for the USSR during the Second World War and founded and edited the 'Anglo-Soviet Journal' -- Geoffrey Marr Vevers saw the distribution of knowledge as a duty. He was one of the first BBC television educators at Alexandra Palace and a contributor to 'Children's Hour' in 1946-7. 
Gwynne Vevers was a scholar at St Paul's School, where his collections of butterflies, mosses, and fossil brachiopods won him three Smee prizes. He gained a Kitchener scholarship and college exhibition to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was tutored by J. Z. Young and Solly Zuckerman. In 1936, as an undergraduate, he collaborated with James Fisher on a paper announcing a method for estimating the gannet population on the Scottish island of Ailsa Craig. He travelled to Greenland with the Oxford University Exploration Club in 1936 and to the Faeroes in 1937 to collect mouse and gannet statistics. From the Faeroes and Iceland in 1937-9 he reported to the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty on the German ships which were charting deep-water channels. So began Vevers's covert intelligence gathering, which was to last for several decades. His roving life as a zoologist proved perfect cover; even as late as 1970 he was being debriefed after a zoological trip to Rangoon. 
From 1940 Vevers carried out wartime intelligence work for the RAF. He used aerial reconnaissance of the ice floes to determine the deep-water channels. When the German battleship 'Bismarck' broke out of Bergen Fjord in May 1941 and sank HMS 'Hood' off Iceland, Vevers predicted her position from his charts, and she was intercepted and sunk off Brest. For his work he was made a military MBE. He switched in 1943 to the Air Ministry, where with another zoologist, Wing Commander Frederick S. Russell, he assessed and distributed 'Ultra' ciphers after the British broke the encryptions of the German coding device Enigma. Towards the war's end he was in Germany, hunting down Reichsminister Rust, who committed suicide a few hours before Vevers caught up with him. Vevers was a gifted linguist: by 1945 he could deliver a speech in Russian to former prisoners of war. He spoke Norwegian and all the Scandinavian languages including Faeroese, and used his far-north posting to perfect his Icelandic at Reykjavik University. 
After the war Russell became director of the Marine Biological Laboratory at Plymouth and brought Vevers in as bursar. Here from 1945 to 1955 he studied starfish and published on invertebrate pigments with Gilbert Kennedy. In 1949 he completed his Oxford DPhil on the effect of the female sex hormone oestrone; in this he showed that the plumage of the Amherst pheasant was a secondary sexual characteristic under hormonal control. At Plymouth, Vevers developed an underwater camera, which proved as useful in recording marine life around the Eddystone lighthouse as in searches for lost submarines by the US Navy. In 1954 came his first book, 'The British Seashore'. Made assistant director of science in charge of the aquarium at London Zoo in 1955, he worked with Norman Millot on the pigmented eye-spots of echinoderms. This fascination with the hormonal and histochemical control of coloration led him to join up with his Savile Club friend Harold Munro Fox to write 'The Nature of Animal Colours' (1960). 
Amiable and unflappable, Vevers became a mainstay of Zoological Society meetings. He edited the 'Journal of Zoology' and the 'Zoological Record', and as curator of the aquarium he introduced several novel exhibits, including the spectacular sea urchin 'Diadema'. His administrative talents were in demand elsewhere: as zoological secretary and vice-president of the Linnean Society; on the Biological Council; at the Marine Biological Association and the Freshwater Biological Association; and as a trustee of the Savile Club. 
Vevers was a very private person, yet he was also the perfect raconteur and this, with his interest in photography and sea life, made him an ideal natural-history presenter for the BBC unit in Bristol, which began its outside broadcasts in the early 1950s. He served on the science selection committee of the National Film Archive for over thirty years, and he appeared on Desmond Morris's 'Zoo Time'. Vevers himself preferred the radio, and became a familiar wireless voice to the post-war generation. 
Vevers's family life was very private indeed, and largely unknown to colleagues. He had four wives: he married Mary Brandt in 1942 (James Fisher, 1912-1970, was best man); (Pamela) Joyce Brigstocke on 9 September 1950 (he had with her a son, Geoffrey, in 1952); Winwood Reade in April 1969; and Barbara Oliver on 23 December 1974. He greatly enjoyed the company of women and there were a number of other, less formal liaisons. 
Vevers was the oldest member of the Royal Society expedition to the Solomon Islands in 1965, and to the Cook Islands in 1969, to celebrate the bicentenary of Captain Cook's voyage. During the latter expedition he made a pidgin-English speech to the people of Aitutaku. 
Vevers's writing was prolific: he produced nearly one hundred books and translations (from eight European languages). Most were popular: on birds, eggs, tracks, fish, animals of the Arctic and of Russia, the human body, the London Zoo, and aquariums. Twenty-four publishers kept him in commissions for thirty years, and he kept the natural world in sight for an increasingly urbanized population. Ultimately his children's books made him known worldwide. But he never would write his wartime memoirs, nor disclose his intelligence activity, despite the cajoling of publishers. He retired from the zoo in 1981 to his home, Wood's House, Bampton, Oxfordshire, where he died on 24 July 1988: he was cremated at Oxford on 1 August.

Calvert, Albert Frederick (1872?-1946), traveller and author, was the son of John Frederick (Fred) Calvert, a mining engineer, and his wife, Grace Easley. There is doubt about the date and place of his birth. Some sources make him Australian, born in New South Wales on 20 July 1869, a date consistent with Calvert's own claim to have written about Western Australia in 1889, when he would have been twenty, and a statement in 'Vanity Fair' (no. 635, November 1895) that 'he was born in New South Wales some seven and twenty years ago'. On the other hand none of the 190 laudatory fragments of reviews to ten of his books, appended to 'My Fourth Tour in Western Australia' (1897), refers to him as an Australian, when they had every occasion to do so. On a birth certificate his birth was registered as having taken place at St Pancras, Kentish Town, London, on 20 July 1872. His grandfather, John Calvert (1814-1897), a goldmining expert, was mainly responsible for his upbringing. 
In the 1890s Calvert achieved eminence as an authority on Australia, on the basis of his expeditions, and the accounts he wrote of them and of other aspects of Australian life and mores. In April 1890, partly in the company of his grandfather and perhaps his father, he set out from London under the auspices of the General Exploration Company on his first gold-seeking trip to Australia. It was unsuccessful, and a second expedition, sponsored by the same body, spanned spring 1891 and summer 1892 and encompassed a route of about 500 miles into the north-west of Western Australia. Subsequently he incorporated a detour to the pearl fisheries, described in his 'Pearls: their Origin and Formation' (1892). For his third 'tour' his destination was again Roebourne, Western Australia. He set out in December 1892, on this occasion financed by the British Australian Exploration Company, inspecting mines in the goldfields. On his return to London Calvert founded the 'Western Australian Review', with the avowed intention of 'promoting the interests' of that colony, and published 'Western Australia: its History and Progress' (1894) and 'The Exploration of Australia' (2 vols., 1895; 2nd edn, 1901). Simultaneously he was involved in floating mining enterprises on the stock exchange, acting as managing director for two, and as consultant for others. On 28 March 1894, in Kentish Town, he married Florence, daughter of James Holcombe, solicitor; they had five sons, one of whom, probably the eldest, was killed in action in France in 1915. Calvert was now at the apex of his business career, and was a celebrity. 
Before undertaking his next expedition Calvert was guest at a farewell dinner given in his honour by the lord mayor of London in October 1895. His ensuing publication, 'My Fourth Tour in Western Australia' (1897), listed the fellowships that he held at that time, including those of the Royal Geographical Society, the Geological Society of Edinburgh, the Scottish Geographical Society, the Geographical Society of Australia, the Royal Society of Australia, the Colonial Institute, and the Imperial Institute. The profuse illustrations, comprising photographs and sketches by the artist Walker Hodgson together with a special map of the western region, were a hallmark of his publications. In 1898 this period of prestige and prosperity came to an end when he sued for bankruptcy, claiming losses on his journal in London and the failure of certain Western Australian mining companies as the causes. His speculative investments in goldmining enterprises appear to have ceased at this time, when the whole course of his life changed. 
For the next twenty or so years Calvert turned his attention primarily to Spain and to things Spanish. Within ten years he became such an expert on Spain that he was made a knight grand cross of the royal order of Isabel the Catholic, and made commander of the royal order of Alfonso XII. These honours superseded all others and he used them after his name on most of his publications after 1909. He was the self-styled 'editor' of the 'Spanish Series' which was to consist of nineteen volumes brought out between 1907 and 1921. They were published by John Lane at the Bodley Head, were uniformly bound in distinctive crimson cloth with gilt decoration, and were characterized by an unvarying presentation: a historical or background survey of the city or subject under discussion, followed by the plates, normally photographic and invariably exceeding by far the quantity of pages taken up by the text. At the turn of the twentieth century, and before 1903, he travelled extensively throughout the Peninsula, establishing a large number of 'contacts' in the process. Before launching his 'Spanish Series' he tested the water with 'Impressions of Spain' (1903), the first of his publications on that country. This is a perceptive and informed account, with a sensitive appraisal of Spanish character, and an extensive final section on mining in the Peninsula. 'The Alhambra' (1906) and its companion volume, 'Moorish Remains in Spain' (1906), dedicated to Alfonso XIII, are book productions of the highest quality, embellished with an abundance of colour plates drawn from nineteenth-century works on the architectural legacy of Islam in Spain, notably by Owen Jones, to whose masterpiece on the design of the Alhambra Calvert's publications are particularly indebted. Also noteworthy are his volumes on the painters Murillo (1907), Velazquez, written in collaboration with C. Gasquoine Hartley (1908), and Goya (with 612 'reproductions', also 1908), as well as 'The Life of Cervantes' (1905). This last study is subtitled 'the tercentenary edition' to commemorate the year of publication of the first part of 'Don Quijote', and is a spirited biography. 
All Calvert's works on Spain were written in London, with the preface indicating his home address of Royston, Eton Avenue, Hampstead (or, occasionally, Swiss Cottage), and many are dedicated to Spanish grandees of his acquaintance, notably the marques de Villalobar, minister for Spain in London. The majority of Calvert's books on Spanish topics were published before the outbreak of the First World War. Subsequently his only work on a Spanish subject appears to have been 'The Spanish Royal Tapestries' (1921), the last in the series. 
In 1902 Calvert had contributed to the controversy on the authorship of Shakespeare's works with 'Bacon and Shakespeare', an erudite coverage of the theories and an impassioned defence of Shakespeare's authorship, with appropriate illustrations, including a reproduction of the singular 'wheel' 'used by Dr Owen in deciphering Sir Francis Bacon's cipher writings'. That he never entirely neglected his training as a mineralogist is testified by his 'Nigeria and its Tin Fields' (1910) -- 'compiled in haste, but care has been taken to verify the facts'. A second edition was published in 1912, followed by the substantial 'Nigerian Mining Manual' (1913). There is no evidence that he visited Nigeria nor that he ever went to Brazil, the location for his 'Mineral Resources of Minas Geraes (Brazil)' (1915), for which he stated that he 'searched official records and read all the available literature that has been published on the subject in English, French, and Portuguese'. He also consulted 'geologists and mining men' who had been to Brazil, and clearly set great store by his sources in his quest to provide as full and up-to-date a picture as possible. He also had an interest in salt, which led to his 'Salt in Cheshire' (1915), to his political study 'A History of the Salt Union' (1913), and his 'Salt and the Salt Industry' for Pitman's series 'Common Commodities and Industries', published after the First World War. Before 1918 he brought out five books on German African colonies, a subject he investigated in depth, and the product of political concerns at the time. A freemason since 1894 he was renowned as an authority on the history of freemasonry, some sixteen publications on the subject being attributed to him, including 'The Grand Lodge of England, 1717-1917' (1917). His last publication of note demonstrated another aspect of his versatility: 'Daffodil Growing for Pleasure and Profit' (1929). This consists of eighteen chapters by Calvert, an equal number by sundry authors, and photographs of over two hundred classes of daffodil. The inclusion of two photographs of 'daffodils growing in one of R. F. Calvert's fields at Coverack, Cornwall' suggests that the Calvert mentioned might have been a relation, perhaps one of his four surviving sons. 
In 1923 Calvert was involved in a curious lawsuit in which he did not give evidence; damages of $10,000 were awarded against him and in favour of a sister of the tsar of Russia who had implicated him in scheming to deprive her of the proceeds from the sale of her jewels. The tone of the proceedings suggests that he was no longer a person of note, and that his earlier reputation had not been durable. Thirty petitions of bankruptcy had been filed against him, the last in 1921, but he had never been 'adjudicated bankrupt'. After 1929 little is known of his life. Seemingly there were no further publications, and there is some evidence that he received assistance from the masons before his death, at Archway Hospital, Islington, London, on 27 June 1946. His wife survived him. Part of his notable collection of masonic material was acquired for the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, Cheshire, before 1926. There has been a revival of interest in Calvert's 'Australian' years, while his substantial contribution to Hispanism is awaiting reassessment.

Agnes Lancecrona (fl. 1382-1388), a lady of the royal household. Little is known about her origins. Walsingham believes that she was a saddler's daughter, but it has been suggested on the basis of her name that she belonged to a German (or possibly Netherlandish) noble family called Landskron. She had come to England with Queen Anne in 1382, and is described by the Monk of Westminster as a 'woman of the queen's chamber' ('Westminster Chronicle', 188-9). She may indeed have been of German rather than Czech origin, but such a distinction would probably not have appeared significant at the English court in the 1380s. From the point of view of the English nobles and their wives, her lowly status, and her membership of a group of Bohemians around the queen who were generally unpopular, were quite sufficient for de Vere's affair with her to cause grave offence. His first wife was Edward III's granddaughter, and her royal uncles, notably Gloucester, were strongly protective of her and, later, sought to shield her from the consequences of her husband's disgrace and exile.

Alice Lacy, 'suo jure' countess of Lincoln, and countess of Lancaster and Leicester (1281-1348), by Earl Warenne was only one episode in what was an adventurous career. Probably born at her father's castle of Denbigh, Alice played no discernible part in Thomas of Lancaster's life and, like many medieval women, came into her own only after her husband's death. According to the Meaux chronicle, her abduction by Warenne was carried through, not from lust, but merely to spite her husband, who had stood with the royal council in 1314 in attempting to prevent Warenne from divorcing his wife, Joan de Bar, in order to marry his mistress, Maud Nerford. Alice's separation from Lancaster, however, did not protect her from the consequences of his death in opposition to the king in 1322. After his fall both she and her mother were imprisoned at York. There Alice was threatened with burning by the two Hugh Despensers, father and son -- a characteristic instance of their casual brutality -- until she surrendered to their will. She lost her great inherited lordship of Denbigh (which she never regained) and most of her other estates, but she was allowed to keep her title of countess of Salisbury and Lincoln, together with a life interest in lands worth 500 marks.

Anne of York (1439-1476), eldest daughter of Richard, duke of York, born at Fotheringhay on 10 August 1439, married Henry Holland in January 1446. Only one daughter was born of the union. Following the duke's attainder in 1461 the duchess was initially provided for, like the wives of other attainted Lancastrians, by the settlement of her jointure on feoffees to her use, to ensure that nothing passed to her husband. Very soon, however, she convinced her brother Edward IV of her loyalty and commitment, and enjoyed the favour and influence appropriate to the king's sister. In 1462 she was granted her husband's goods, his whole Exeter inheritance for life, Rochford and other forfeited lands in Exeter, Hadleigh, Essex, and other forfeitures in 1465. In 1464 she was entrusted with the custody of the young Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham. She contracted her daughter Anne, first to George Neville, infant son of the earl of Northumberland and male heir of Richard Neville, earl of Warwick (the Kingmaker), then to the queen's son Thomas Grey, later marquess of Dorset, and settled lands on Grey and Anne jointly: they were married in October 1466 but she had died by February 1474, when Dorset remarried. Anne of York's titles to her Exeter lands were repeatedly amended to ensure her estate for life, the performance of her will (1467), the inheritance of her daughter (1465), remainders to any further children born to the duchess herself (1467), and to the queen (1469). Such provisions suggest a new sexual liaison long before her divorce on 12 November 1472. She married Thomas St Leger, and the couple had a daughter, also called Anne, in 1475. The duchess died in January 1476 and was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor. The sixteen-week-old Anne St Leger was regarded as the Exeter heir: in 1483 the inheritance was divided by act of parliament between the queen's younger son, Richard Grey, and Anne herself, who was contracted to Dorset's own son.

Their eldest son, Edward Stafford, was born in 1478, and they had a second son, Henry, and perhaps a third, Humphrey, who died young, and also two daughters, Elizabeth and Anne. Given her husband's violence against the Woodville clan in 1483, it is unsurprising that Katherine did not attend the coronation of Richard III. She accompanied Buckingham from Brecon to Weobley in October 1483, leaving her daughters at Brecon. When the duke fled, the duchess and her younger son Henry were taken and brought to London. Edward, the heir, had been consigned to safe keeping. In December 1483 the duchess had licence to bring her children and servants from Wales to London. Deprived of dower or jointure, she was eventually awarded an annuity of 200 marks by Richard III.

On 31 May 1803 he married Phoebe, the daughter of his influential landlord, William Willcocks, formerly mayor of Cork. He had already been admitted to the bar, and had been licensed to practise law in the previous month.

William Collins (1789-1853), who was born at Pollokshaws, near Glasgow, on 12 October 1789. The identity of his parents is not known, although his father may have been Edward Collins, an Englishman who arrived in Glasgow in 1746 and is known to have founded the Collins paper mill at Dalmuir, near Glasgow. William Collins was educated at the local parish school, where he did well; he left about 1800, and went to work at the loom at Pollokshaws. Some six years later he became a clerk in John Monteith's cotton mill. By now an active, ambitious, and devout Christian, he offered on Sundays religious instruction and on weekday evenings lessons in English, writing, and arithmetic. 
On 14 March 1807 Collins married Jean Barclay (died 1846), the daughter of a Paisley engineer. He left the mill in 1813 to open a private school in Campbell Street, Glasgow, and within four years his income from the school had tripled. He founded a Sunday school in 1815 and over the next two years established a chain of Sunday schools throughout Glasgow. He became an elder of the kirk at the Tron Church in 1814, and a year later arranged for the translation to that church of Dr Thomas Chalmers. This inspirational preacher became the most influential figure in his life, his spiritual mentor who was not averse to combining religion with business. 
In 1819 Collins closed his school and established himself in the Candleriggs as William Collins & Co., printers, and (in partnership with Chalmers's brother Charles) as Chalmers and Collins, booksellers and stationers. Their first book, Dr Chalmers's 'The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns', was published on 23 September 1819, and despite growing social unrest Collins managed to establish his business on a firm footing during 1820. In December that year he was caught up in a quarrel between Dr Chalmers and the Glasgow publisher John Smith over a booklet originally published by Lesslie of Dundee, a quarrel (outcome unknown) which lasted for over two years and revealed Chalmers's formidable pride, temper, and obstinacy. 
The character of the early Collins list -- a character which was to endure for well over a hundred years, particularly in the Glasgow publishing departments -- was built on evangelical preaching and awareness of the next world: educational, instructive, edifying, above all Christian. It featured collections of sermons, schoolbooks, and a body of rather fearsome children's fiction written to glorify the covenanters. Collins was an outspoken opponent of slavery, and arranged meetings with William Wilberforce and Zachary Macaulay on his first journey south to sell his new books to the English book trade. In 1822 he started to publish his 'Select Library of Christian Authors', designed to make theological classics accessible to the rapidly growing reading public. By 1829 there were almost fifty volumes in print. The first of so many Collins best-sellers, 'The Christian Philosopher' by Thomas Dick, appeared in 1823 and was regularly reprinted for over half a century. 
Collins found another best-seller in 1825, 'The Christian Psalmist', an anthology edited by James Montgomery, which was to be reprinted four times within the next twelve months; but 1825 also saw a sudden recession in retail bookselling, which ruined Archibald Constable and threatened the survival of every under-capitalized publisher. Not only was Collins under-capitalized (even though he printed most of the books he published himself, as his successors continued to do for the next century and a half), but his energetic expansion of his list also left him particularly vulnerable to bad debts and dwindling orders. Collins solved the immediate problem by borrowing enough from his brothers-in-law to buy out the Chalmers family's interest in the retail business, which had been losing money, and close it down. Remarkably, he achieved this on terms which avoided any serious breach with his mentor, Thomas Chalmers, but the climate of their relationship remained changeable. Thunder and lightning could be expected whenever Chalmers felt himself taken for granted or otherwise ill-treated. Thus he placed more blame upon his publisher for the disappointing critical reception of his 'Political Economy' (1832) than could reasonably have been expected. 
By now Collins had thrown himself with characteristic fervour into the temperance movement. At the height of the cholera epidemic in 1829 he founded Britain's first temperance society, and wore himself out with journeys to other great cities and passionate speeches to packed meetings; in 1831 he founded the London Temperance Society. Temperance speeches, tracts, and magazines poured from the Collins printing works. In 1834 he took up yet another crusade and founded the Glasgow Church Building Society with the aim of constructing no fewer than twenty new churches in that city -- a target which was reached within seven years, a direct result of Collins's relentless drive. 
In 1835 Collins published Nathaniel Paterson's 'The Manse Garden', 'Leitch's Practical and Economical Readers' -- of which one and a half million copies were sold within fifteen years -- and the first of the twenty-five volumes of the collected works of Thomas Chalmers. In the same year he joined with other evangelicals in urging state aid for church extension, appearing on platforms and printing lectures. In 1837 he was accompanied by his son William ['see below'] on a visit to London in pursuit of this aim. Returning to London in 1838, he met the archbishop of Canterbury, the duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, and the young W. E. Gladstone. 
Every publisher has on his list an author who feels that he is neglected and bitterly resents any attention paid to another author. Dr Chalmers played this part in the life of William Collins. Feeling entitled to greater sales and greater critical esteem, and yearning for a London publisher who might be expected to achieve this for him, he was quick to complain about trifles and tried from time to time to interfere with Collins's arrangements with the retail trade. The final storm arose as a consequence of the Disruption of the Church of Scotland and the establishment of the Free Church of Scotland in 1843: both men supported the new church, and Chalmers became its first moderator. In 1844 Collins undertook extensive printing work for the Free Church. In the same year the Free Church authorities determined to distribute many thousands of copies of the 'History of the Reformation' by the Swiss historian Merle d'Aubigne among their flock. Three volumes of this work had already been published in Britain by three publishers including Collins. The right to publish the fourth volume was won by Oliver and Boyd of Edinburgh. Chaos ensued. In 1846 Chalmers suddenly transferred his literary interests to Oliver and Boyd. In 1847 'the most illustrious Scottish churchman since John Knox' (said Lord Rosebery) died. 
Growing pressure for the termination of the monopoly in 'Bible' printing enjoyed by successive king's and queen's printers for Scotland since 1580 was rewarded in 1839, when all Scottish printers were given the right to print the scriptures 'under bond and caution' (to ensure that their work contained no errors). Collins printed his first 'New Testament' in 1841. By the end of 1843 he had completed three bibles, thus establishing a tradition which continued as long as the company maintained its own printing works. 
William Collins died in simple lodgings in Rothesay, Buteshire, on 2 January 1853, and was buried in the Necropolis, Glasgow. He left many memorials; the 'Scottish Guardian' praised 'the strength and simplicity of his faith... his burning zeal... his liberality... his readiness for every good work'. To this we may add praise for his vision, drive, and Calvinistic rectitude in commercial matters. Jean Collins had died in 1846; his sole surviving son, William, inherited a well-established printing, publishing, and bookselling business.

Educated partly at Roedean School, in 1930 she became secretary -- initially paid 30's'. a week -- to Sir James Hamet Dunn, first baronet (1874-1956), a London-based Canadian financier, who bought his baronetcy via the Lloyd George political fund. He returned to Canada and in 1935 took charge of the Algoma Steel Corporation of Ontario (gaining full control in 1944); she followed and became its assistant secretary. After his second wife divorced him, and after she had nursed him through a near fatal illness, he married her on 7 June 1942. Following his death, on 1 January 1956, she inherited half his fortune (estimated at nearly C$70 million). She gave a science block and endowed law scholarships at Dalhousie University, New Brunswick, of which Dunn had been a graduate. Grief-stricken, she talked of entering a convent. Instead she became the constant companion of Lord Beaverbrook, a friend of Dunn since boyhood. He used her diary in writing his memoir of Dunn, 'Courage' (1961), which she disliked. Reportedly she and Beaverbrook secretly plighted their troth at the church at Torphichen, West Lothian, in 1961. On 7 June 1963 he married her at Epsom register office. He repeatedly said that she was richer than he was, and it was conjectured that he hoped -- though in vain -- that she might divert funds to his Beaverbrook foundation at the University of New Brunswick. She became a trustee of the Beaverbrook foundations and was put on the board of Beaverbrook newspapers. On 9 June 1964 Beaverbrook died in her arms. She was bequeathed none of his fortune.

He married in 1936 Elizabeth Mary, daughter of Frederick James Dundas of Cawthorne, Yorkshire; they had five sons and two daughters. Under his chairmanship from 1961 to 1975 Finlays divested itself of most of its Indian estates, retaining those in the adjacent subcontinent, and diversified into merchant banking and oil.

The businesses operated by the Finlays and Muirs were on the whole extremely successful. The first Sir John Muir saw the colonial possibilities of primary crop production and revolutionized the tea industry by his integrated management of the various stages from plant to pot. The Muir family were paternalistic, stern, but respected employers, sustaining Victorian standards of probity and commanding loyalty and hard work from their vast workforce. Under the second Sir John Muir, Finlays was still an international company, mainly concerned with tea, though cotton textiles had been replaced by interests in North Sea oil; it remained, as it had been in the 1880s, the largest Scottish employer of overseas labour.

Samuel Enderby (1717x20-1797), son of Daniel Enderby (1681-1766), tanner, of Bermondsey, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Cook. Little is recorded of Samuel's early life. He married Mary Buxton, possibly related to a business acquaintance, John Buxton. They reared seven children: Charles (1753-1819), Daniel ('b'. 1756), Samuel (1756-1829) ['see below'], Mary ('b'. 1757), Hannah ('b'. 1759), Elizabeth ('b'. 1761), and George ('b'. 1762). As early as 2 January 1742 the elder Samuel Enderby's name appears among the freedom admissions to the Coopers' Company. By 1773 or 1774 he had become concerned with the northern whale fishery in Arctic waters. More significant was the firm's involvement with the American whalers of Massachusetts and Nantucket Island, suppliers of sperm whale oil and the spermaceti wax essential at that period for industrial and domestic use, but this lucrative trade ceased with the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 in which Enderby ships came to prominence, being those in which the famous shipment of tea rached Boston in 1777. Enderby reacted by sending whaling vessels, manned largely by experienced Nantucketers, to the newly developing southern whale fishery south of lat. 44 degree N, where sperm whales were to be found in abundance. The confirmation by the College of Arms in 1778 of the Enderby armorial ensigns was perhaps a reflection of the family's growing prosperity and influence in the City of London and in government circles. 
In subsequent years the elder Samuel Enderby appeared as a frequent and persuasive petitioner before the committee for trade, seeking, along with other leading merchants, an extension to the fishery limits imposed by the East India Company. These views tended to coincide with those of government, whose policy was to achieve British supremacy in the southern whale fishery. A measure of the firm's success was the rounding of Cape Horn in 1788-9 by the Enderby vessel 'Emilia', the first British whaler to enter the Pacific, returning in 1790 with a highly profitable catch of oil. The colonization of New South Wales in 1788 gave the firm further opportunities to expand its business in whale and seal oil and to compete fairly with foreign competitors. By 1791 Enderby had opened an office in Port Jackson (Sydney), and his whalers were transporting convicts on their outward voyages to the whaling grounds. In his latter years he continued to lobby government for legislation beneficial to the whaling industry. As the boundaries of the fisheries expanded so did the need for more favourable premiums for British whalers, for permission to revictual in certain foreign ports, and for the freedom for the whaling crews from arbitrary impressment by the navy. 
The elder Samuel Enderby died on 12 September 1797 and was succeeded as senior partner by the younger

Samuel Enderby (1756-1829), partnered by his brothers Charles and George, all three of whom were freemen of the Coopers' Company. (The younger Samuel was indentured with the company in 1771 and became a freeman on 1 April 1783.) Samuel was seemingly his father's natural successor; as early as 1783, at the time of the peace treaty concluded with the former American colonies, he had been deputed to visit Boston, Massachusetts, for the purpose of gathering information on the state of the whale fishery and to engage Nantucket whalers to serve on Enderby vessels. Under his leadership the firm continued to pursue the expansionist policies of his father, the founder. In 1802 an act of parliament permitted fishing without licence throughout the Pacific, and a whale fishery with New Zealand was established. Enderby vessels were to find themselves engaged in discovery as well as hunting. In 1806 the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands were discovered by their vessel the 'Ocean', and in 1808 Bouvet Island (Bouvet- 'o'ya) was rediscovered by the 'Swan' and 'Otter' and rediscovered again in 1825 by the 'Sprightly' and 'Lively' when it was claimed for the crown. 
Enderby died in 1829 at Crooms Hill House, Crooms Hill, Blackheath, Kent, and was survived by his widow, Mary Enderby 'nee' Goodwyn (died 1846), and nine children. One of their daughters, Elizabeth (1794-1873), married Lieutenant-General Henry William Gordon (1785/6-1865) and became the mother of Charles George Gordon RA (1833-1885), the hero of Khartoum. The firm continued to trade under the name of Enderby Bros., headed by the younger Samuel Enderby's second son, Charles ['see below'], and partnered by two of his brothers, Henry and George. After 1832 the office was moved from Paul's Wharf, Thames Street, to 15 Great St Helen's, Bishopsgate Street, London.

Alpin (d. 840), son of Eochaid, son of Aed Find. Alpin is not mentioned in the annals, except later as father of Kenneth (or Cinaed) I, but he has a place in the genealogy of kings of the Scots and the Irish synchronisms. 
Alpin has been confused with the eighth-century king of the same name. For medieval users of the Latin lists the confusion was easy. The original Latin list virtually ended at Fergus (died 781). Its three latest kings (Muredach, Aed Find, and Fergus) became displaced so that they stood before Selbach instead of after; and all the kings after Fergus were dropped. So the list came to end at Alpin son of Eochaid, with a reign of three years (733-6), understood by a later editor or copyist to be Kenneth's father, after whose death 'the kingdom of Scots was transferred to the kingdom of Picts' (Anderson, 'Early Sources', 1.270). 
Kenneth's father seems in fact to have reigned for only one year (839-40). He was said to have been killed in warfare against the Picts, and this may well have been true. The late thirteenth-century chronicle of Huntingdon dates his death exactly on 13 Kal. Aug. (20 July), possibly copied from an early source; but the year, 834, was almost certainly arrived at by counting back reign lengths in a faulty regnal list. 

Kenneth I, the son of Alpin, is said by the Scottish chronicle to have become king of the Dal Riata two years before he 'came to Pictavia'. It was perhaps in these two years (840-42) that he arranged to borrow reinforcements from the Airgialla, as noted by the annals of the four masters. Their date, 835, may have been arrived at by the same method as the chronicle of Huntingdon's date for the death of Alpin. Kenneth was king for sixteen years in the east (842-58) and died in Forteviot, in modern Perthshire. For the first six years he was perhaps occupied in eliminating a remnant Pictish kingdom. In 848 or 849 he brought relics of St Columba to Dunkeld. 
The name Dal Riata, for land or people, continued in occasional use, but the title king of Dal Riata is not used in the annals of Ulster after the 790s. Kenneth and his brother and sons are each described at their deaths as 'rex Pictorum'.

Connad Cerr (d. c.629), whose epithet means 'crooked' or 'left-handed'. On the evidence of the Irish synchronisms, Connad Cerr is usually thought to have been Eochaid Buide's son. A genealogical section in the 'Miniugud senchasa fher nAlban' ('Explanation of the genealogy of the men of Scotland') names Connad Cerr in a list of Eochaid's sons. This text, however, is not to be depended on; in the same sentence Domnall Dond, Eochaid's grandson who died 'c'.696, is included among Eochaid's sons. In the Latin lists Connad Cerr is a 'son of Conal', and it would appear that in the synchronisms the phrase 'his son' ('a mac') has been displaced. A difficulty in accepting the reading of the Latin lists was pointed out by Bannerman: the only possible known Conal is Comgall's son, the king who died in 574, and a son of his would seem too old to be made king about 629. 
Connad Cerr died in the same year in which he became king, in a battle at Fid Eoin in Ireland, an internal quarrel of the Dal nAraidi, southern neighbours of the Irish Dal Riata. His successor was Domnall Brecc, Eochaid Buide's son. Domnall had an unlucky reign. In 637 he chose to side with Congal Caech, overking of the Ulaid, against Domnall, Aed's son, head of the Cenel Conaill branch of the northern Ui Neill. (Legend said that Congal was a nephew of Domnall Brecc.) Domnall's connection with the battle of Moira (in Down), in which Congal lost his life, is known, not from the annals, but from Cummene, the seventh abbot of Iona, author of a work on Columba. A passage from the book, copied into an early manuscript of Adomnan's life of the saint, quotes a prophecy of the evil consequences to any of King Aedan's descendants who shall fail in loyalty to the Cenel Conaill, Columba's kindred. Cummene (who died in 669) adds that the prophecy had been fulfilled 'in our time' in the battle of Moira, when Domnall Brecc without provocation wasted the province of Domnall, son of Aed. Domnall Brecc is not said to have been present in the battle. 
No more is heard of Domnall Brecc in Ireland. It may be that the Irish Dal Riata no longer acknowledged his kingship. A severance of the two Dal Riatas would account for the warning attributed to Columba, that Aedan's descendants might 'lose the sceptre of this kingdom from their hands' (Anderson, 'Early Sources', 1.160). There was a second sense in which Domnall might be said to have lost the sceptre. He was still apparently king in 642 or 643, at his death in battle against Owen, king of the Strathclyde Britons; but it seems that he no longer reigned alone. Reign lengths suggest that from 637 until his death the kingship was shared between him and

Domangart (d. 673), a son of Domnall Brecc, became sole king. It was perhaps towards the end of the joint reign that Scots in Britain, as well as Picts, became tributary to Oswiu, king of Northumbria (died 670). When Cummene, writing in his own person, says that since the day of the battle of Moira the descendants of Aedan have been held down by 'extranei' ('strangers' or 'outsiders'), he is probably referring to, and lamenting, their subjection to Northumbria, which was to continue long after Cummene's death. 
Domangart died in 673 by violence of some kind ('jugulatio'). He was one of the very few kings to whom contemporary annalists attached the label 'king of Dal Riata'. He was followed by two sons of his uncle Conall Crandomna, who reigned in succession: Maelduin (or Mael Duin), who died peacefully in 688 or 689, and Domnall Dond, who met a violent death, perhaps in 696. In 685, towards the end of Maelduin's life, Scots as well as Picts were freed from Northumbrian dominion by the Pictish victory at Dunnichen and the death of King Ecgfrith. 
It may be that the violent deaths of Domangart (673) and Domnall Dond (696?) reflect antagonism between the two branches of Eochaid Buide's descendants through his sons Domnall Brecc and Conall Crandomna, but nothing is known of the circumstances. The king-lists at this period are corrupt and defective. One piece of list evidence that cannot be ignored is the twenty-one-year reign of

Dungal (d. c.736). In 726, when Dungal was thrown 'de regno', the overkingship returned to the old ruling family in the person of Eochaid, son of Eochaid (son of Domangart, son of Domnall Brecc). In the next year Selbach came out of retirement to fight a battle with adversaries who are described as the 'familia' of Eochaid, grandson of Domnall. No doubt Eochaid, son of Eochaid, was involved, but it is not recorded that he was actually present in the battle. Selbach died in 730. 
In 733 Eochaid, son of Eochaid, died. It is not known whether he was still alive when Flaithbertach, a great-grandson of Domnall, son of Aed, and the last of the Cenel Conaill to be counted as a high-king of Ireland, brought a fleet of the Dal Riata to Ireland to assist him against his rivals. The campaign was a failure; in the following year Flaithbertach was forced to abdicate. 
In 733 also Dungal of Lorne was active off the north Irish coast, and he profaned the monastery in Tory Island by forcibly removing Brude, son of the Pictish king Oengus mac Forgusso (Onuist son of Uurguist), who had taken sanctuary there. The origin of the enmity that certainly existed from this time between Dungal and Oengus is obscure. In this same year Dungal's cousin

Fiannamail (d. 700), Dunchad's grandson, described as 'king of Dal Riata' at his death. It is supposed that his grandfather was the Dunchad, Duban's son, who had held part of the overkingship in the 650s. Fiannamail's ability to remove his predecessor to Ireland prompts the question whether he belonged to a royal family of Irish Dal Riata. But the available evidence is unsatisfactory. That the guarantors of Adomnan's law (697) include both Fiannamail 'grandson of Dunchad', with no title, and 'Eochu grandson of Domnall' (that is, Eochaid, son of Domangart), with the title 'ri', 'king', tells very little about Fiannamail's status. A 'king of Kintyre' called Dunchad Becc is noticed by the annals in 721; his name suggests that he may have been of the same family as Fiannamail. The absence of Fiannamail from the genealogical section of the 'Miniugud senchasa fher nAlban' is not relevant; this text brings its lists in general no further down than Aedan's grandsons. But though Fiannamail is not in the king-lists of the Dal Riata, there is a strong possibility that he was present in the original list. If, owing to a scribal dislocation, his name, mistaken for an epithet, was attached to the name of Eochaid, son of Domangart, that would account both for Fiannamail's apparent absence and for Eochaid's unexplained epithet Rianamhail. 
Fiannamail himself was killed in 700, and

Muredach (d. 771), son of Ainfcellach, 'assumed the kingship of the tribe of Lorne'. In the next year Dungal was overtaken by Oengus's avenging anger. Dungal's fortress was destroyed, and he was wounded and fled to Ireland. 
After the death of Eochaid the overkingship was perhaps divided between Muredach of Lorne and an Alpin whom the Irish synchronisms, not very dependably, call a 'son of Eochaid'. If that is true, he was most likely a half-brother of the king who had just died. It has been suggested that Alpin was the man of that name (not very common among the Scots) who had made himself overking of the Picts from 726 to 728 and had then been forced into flight by Oengus. 
In 736 Oengus made a determined incursion into territory of the Dal Riata, accompanied by his brother Talorgan. He took Dunadd, and his brother routed an opposing army led by Muredach. Dungal and his brother Feradach were captured, and Dungal is not heard of again. It is pleasant to conjecture that Feradach became the father of the Pictish king Ciniod, son of Uuredech, who reigned from 763 to 768. 
Little is known about relations of the Dal Riata with the Picts following Oengus's conquest. Iona ceases to be a source of contemporary annal information about 740. The conquest should probably be seen as a chiefly personal one, a matter of tribute and hostages. There is nothing in writing to suggest that Oengus himself assumed the status of a king of the Dal Riata, though some evidence may yet be extracted from rock carvings on Dunadd. There is no record of Muredach, son of Ainfcellach, after 736 until his death in 771, noticed in the seventeenth-century annals of the four masters. Alpin is not mentioned in annals at all, either before or after 736. The first king after Muredach in the original list of the Dal Riata was

Drust (d. 729), who was possibly his nephew and natural heir; but his action was perhaps not voluntary, for two years later Drust imprisoned him. The notice of the imprisonment, written when Nechtan was no longer king, is the one place where the annals of Ulster identify him as Derile's son. 
In this same year (726) Drust was driven from the kingship by Alpin (perhaps his brother). In 728 Alpin's forces were twice routed by a newcomer, Oengus mac Forgusso (Onuist son of Uurguist). On the second occasion, according to the late English annals of Clonmacnoise, 'Eolbeck the son of Moydan, and the rest of the nobles and people of the Picts, turned their backs to Alpin and did receive Nechtan, the son of Derile, as king into the kingdom again' (Anderson, 'Early Sources', 1.224). It could be said that Oengus had come to the aid of a pro-Nechtan faction. Yet, in the next year (729, recorded in the annals of Ulster only) Oengus's people clashed with Nechtan's people and beat them. Nechtan himself is mentioned no more until his death in 732, and there is no evidence of his having taken any personal part in these events. 
The last battle of the series was fought in July or August 729, between Oengus and Drust who, it is to be supposed, had never relinquished his claim to the kingship, and Drust was killed. There is some reason to think that Alpin later became a king of the Dal Riata. Annalists referred to Drust, Alpin (in his Pictish context), and, in Nechtan's lifetime, to Oengus, without patronymic or other mark of identity. There is no substantial evidence to support Skene's belief that Oengus was unrelated to his predecessors and established a new family on the Pictish throne. If nomenclature is anything to go by, Oengus might have been a great-nephew of Brude mac Bile, who had died as king of Fortriu in 693. Oengus had a brother and a son called Brude, and a brother Talorgan. 
Oengus is said to have reigned for thirty years. If this round number is correct, his reign was counted from 731. Bede, writing in that year, reported that Picts and Angles (Northumbrians) were now at peace with one another. The peace seems to have held for the rest of the decade while Oengus dealt vigorously with internal enemies and their allies. A

Drust (d. c.848), has a note: 'He was killed at Forteviot, according to others, at Scone' (Anderson, 'Early Sources', 1.cxxviii), alluding, it must be supposed, to the legendary 'Treachery of Scone' in which Picts were slaughtered by Scots. 
Whether Drust's end was brought about directly by Kenneth or not, it is likely that during his first six years in the country Kenneth had to contend with an opposition centred on the successors of Urad. The topographical centre of opposition may have been in north-eastern Fortriu. A St Andrews foundation text, written in the twelfth century, connected Uurad ('Pherath son of Bergeth') with Meigle in the extreme east of modern Perthshire. Kenneth died (in 858) at Forteviot, south of the Earn, and his son held an important council there. The earliest mention of Scone as a place of royal importance is in the reign of Kenneth's grandson Constantine. 
Kenneth, son of Alpin, his brother Donald 
(or Domnall; died 862)
, and two of Kenneth's sons, Constantine (or Causantin; r. 862-77) and Aed ('r'. 877-8), are all designated 'rex Pictorum' in the annals of Ulster. Constantine's son Donald (or Domnall; r. 899-900) ['see under 'Constantine II] is the first to be called 'king of Alba'. With his accession, if not before, the royal line of Fortriu must surely have been deemed extinct.

Eoganan (d. 839), perhaps the potential founder of a patrilineal dynasty and a united kingdom. But in 839 he and his brother Bran, with many men of Fortriu, died in a battle against 'pagans'; the first recorded encounter between Picts and Scandinavians. 
A catalogue of kings and other notables in the 'Liber vitae' of Durham includes Custantin (no. 80) and Uoenan (no. 100), believed to be Constantine, son of Fergus, and his nephew Eoganan. Unust (no. 43) is thought to be Oengus I. 
After Eoganan the Pictish lists enter Urad (Ferat), son of Bargoit (Badoc or the like), with a reign of three years (839-42); and after him Bred (Brude) for one year or one month. (Brude is said to be a son of Ferat.) It must have been Urad (Ferat) who opposed Eoganan's successor as overking of the Dal Riata, Alpin ['see under 'Dal Riata, kings of], Eochaid's son, and a grandson of Aed Find. Alpin is said to have died after a year (in 840) in warfare against the Picts. 

Kenneth (Cinaed), son of Alpin, seems to have waited for two years before entering Pictland to continue his father's warfare. In that year (842) Urad ended his reign, if not his life. After the short reign of Bred, one group of lists add a further three reigns totalling six years. The first and last of the three kings were Urad's sons. The second king's father was called Fochel, a possible scribal corruption of Eochaid; he may have been a kinsman of Kenneth. The last of the three,

Oengus (d. 834) in both the kingships. Oengus, often referred to by modern writers as Oengus II, died as king of Fortriu. The figures in the lists suggest that he may have resigned both kingships in 832. The building of the church of Kilrymont (St Andrews in modern Fife) is attributed to him by a note in the Q lists. The foundation legends name the founder as a Pictish king, (H)ungus, but it is impossible to be sure which king, Oengus I or II, the authors had in mind. 
In the four years after Oengus the two kingships were again separate. The Pictish kingship was held jointly by a son of Constantine with the Pictish name of Drest, and a Talorgan, son of Uuthoil. In 836, by what means is unknown, the kingships of Pictland and Dal Riata were both, apparently, taken over by a son of Oengus called

Talorgen (d. 657), whose father, Enfret, was identified by W. F. Skene as Eanfrith, son of AEthelfrith. It is a fair conjecture that Talorgen's mother was a sister of the sons of Uid. 
Eanfrith was killed in 634 after a one-year reign in Northumbria. His brother Oswald, who succeeded him, during his eight-year reign received into subjection, Bede reports, all the peoples of Britain, including the Picts. Their submission, which may have been no more than a formal recognition of lordship, would have been made by Brude, the second of Uid's sons. This Brude's reign (635-41) and Oswald's almost coincided. Oswald's brother Oswiu ('r'. 642-70) required more than a formal submission. Bede says that he made the greater part of the Pictish people subject to the Angles, exacting tribute, at least for the last dozen years of his life, perhaps not during the reign of his nephew Talorgen, son of Eanfrith. After Talorgen two brothers, Gartnait and Drust, sons of Donuel, reigned in succession. Their father's name was perhaps British, or even Pictish, but could be a translation of Irish Domnall. 
Oswiu died in February of (probably) 670, leaving his son Ecgfrith as heir to his dominions. Early in the new reign an uprising of Picts was countered with great slaughter by a Northumbrian army. Bede does not mention the affair, which is known from a highly coloured account in Stephen of Ripon's life of Bishop Wilfrid. In 671 or 672 Drust was driven from his kingship ('de regno') and died six years later. It is unknown whether he was expelled by Ecgfrith on account of the revolt, or by his own people because the revolt had failed, or whether his successor Brude mac Bile (Bridei son of Beli), whose reign was apparently counted from 672, had taken an active part in the expulsion. 
There are three scraps of evidence on the ancestry of Brude mac Bile. The first consists of verses quoted in an Irish life of Adomnan referring to Brude as son of a king of Dumbarton (chief fortress of the British kingdom of Strathclyde). Two kings in the Strathclyde genealogy are called Bile, the one a great-grandson of the other. The elder Bile, son of Neithon, was the father of that Owen who, as king, defeated and killed Domnall Brecc 'c'.642. A son of Owen died 'c'.694, a year after Brude, Bile's son, who would have been his uncle and, presumably, an old man. The later Bile, son of Elfin, died in 722. If he was Brude's father, Brude must have been very young when he became king and not much over forty when he died. 
The second piece of evidence is that a comment on the 'Historia Brittonum' notes that Ecgfrith was Brude's cousin ('fratruelis'). This has been variously explained. It may be seen as simply an assertion that Brude was descended, through his mother, from AEthelfrith, Ecgfrith's grandfather. The implication is that she was either a sister, or a sister's daughter, of the Pictish Talorgen, son of Eanfrith. That she was Talorgen's sister seems to be ruled out by the third piece of information. 
Verses quoted by the seventeenth-century Duald MacFirbis say that when Brude made his stand against Ecgfrith at Dunnichen (near Forfar) in 685, he was fighting for ('im[m]', perhaps 'in, around') the heritage of his grandfather. If the heritage was the overkingship or the kingdom of Fortriu or the land of the Picts, the clause needs a good deal of explaining. But if it was the place where Brude's men stood and fought, in the province of Circhenn, there is a simple explanation: that Brude's mother had been the wife of a king of Circhenn, or a lord of Dunnichen. She was a daughter of Talorgen's sister; if she had been herself Talorgen's sister, Brude's maternal grandfather would have been Eanfrith, whose heritage no doubt lay in Northumbria. However, other models for understanding Brude's ancestry have also been posited. 
In the first half of Brude's reign the annals name him only once, when he attacked Orkney in 682. Perhaps, as H. M. Chadwick suggested, he was responding to a siege of the coastal fortress of Dunnottar (near Stonehaven) the year before. A siege of Dunadd (in Scottish territory) and one of Dundurn (in Pictish) in 683 suggest a conflict with the Dal Riata, but Brude is not mentioned in connection with either. Ecgfrith's invasion of Pictland in May 685 is represented as unprovoked, but it cannot have been totally unforeseen. The Picts evidently did not try to pre-empt it, but when it came Brude was able to carry out the strategic withdrawal that ended in Ecgfrith's death and the total defeat of his army. Brude mac Bile was the first to be described by the annalists as 'king of Fortriu', at his death in 693, and probably in the original entry on the battle of Dunnichen. 
Brude's successor, Tarain, son of Ainftech, was expelled 'de regno' in 697, after which the kingship was held for nearly thirty years by two brothers, sons of Derile. In the same year as Tarain's expulsion the annals record the promulgation in Ireland of Adomnan's law of the innocents. Last in a long list of lay guarantors of the law, in the work known as 'Cain Adamnain', is Brude (or Bridei), Derile's son, king of the Cruithentuath (the Irish name of the Picts). In the following year (698) Picts and Northumbrians fought a battle which resulted in the death of the Northumbrian leader Berctred. This was their first recorded conflict since 685. 
Brude, son of Derile, died in 706. The lists name his successor as Nechtan mac Derile with a reign of fifteen years, or Necton (Brude's brother) with eighteen (706-24). The annals first mention Nechtan (without his parent's name) at 713. In that year 'Talorg, Drostan's son, was bound by his brother, king Nechtan' (Anderson, 'Early Sources', 1.214). This has been taken to show that Nechtan's father was called Drostan. In that case, either Derile was Nechtan's mother (perhaps uniquely in the records of Pictish kings) or, as has been conjectured, the Nechtan of 713 was not the same person as the Nechtan, Derile's son, of the 720s. (The name Derile -- Derelei, Derilei, and so on -- a genitive, has not been explained, may be non-Celtic, and could be of either gender.) A simple alternative is that Nechtan's father was not Drostan, but that Nechtan and Talorg were half-brothers with the same mother and different fathers. 
Nechtan's exceptional concern with ecclesiastical matters brought him within the range of interest of his contemporary, Bede. It was to Bede's own abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow that Nechtan applied for advice on converting his realm to Roman observances. 
A struggle for the Pictish overkingship from 724 until 729 was recorded by annalists in unusual detail, though some explanatory clauses in the Tigernach version can be read as insertions made by a Clonmacnoise editor with the aid of a king-list. In 724 Nechtan is said to have adopted clerical or monastic garb. It appears that he was abdicating in favour of

Talorgan mac Drostan (d. 739), were put to death by drowning, apparently on Oengus's orders. Drostan's son is described as king of Atholl at his death. Both men, it may be supposed, had been a threat to Oengus's kingship. 
In 736 Oengus (on this occasion given his patronymic for the first time) entered territory of the Dal Riata in strength, along with his brother Talorgan. Dungal of Lorne and his brother Feradach were captured. Oengus took the great fortress of Dunadd, and his brother routed an army led by Muredach, Dungal's cousin. Oengus's son Brude died in the same year, but apparently not by violence. 
Oengus no doubt took tribute and hostages from the Dal Riata after his campaign of 736. In 740 he is recorded as fighting the king of Northumbria. But it is not known what the Ulster annalist was referring to in 741: 'Smiting of Dalriada by Oengus' ('Ann. Ulster', 194-5). 
In 750 Oengus's brother Talorgan was killed leading an army against the Strathclyde Britons. In the same year the annals of Ulster enter, in Irish, 'Ebbing of the sovereignty of Oengus' (Anderson, 'Early Sources', 1.240; 'Ann. Ulster', 204-5). The allusion must be, partly at least, to his hold on the Dal Riata (and it should be noted that the reign of their famous king Aed (Aed) Find, who died in 778, was reckoned to have begun in 748). However, in 756 Oengus had an army at his command when he joined the Northumbrian king in a successful attack on the British stronghold of Dumbarton. His name may appear, in the form Unust, in a Northumbrian commemoration book, the 'Liber vitae' of Durham, with the names of later Pictish kings. 
Oengus died in 761. His brother Brude died two years later as king of Fortriu. The next king, Ciniod (Cinaed), son of Feradach, fought against Aed Find in 768. Since the battle was in Fortriu, it looks as if Aed was the aggressor. 
Ciniod died in 775. Four short reigns followed, of kings with Pictish names and seemingly Pictish fathers. The last one, Talorgan, son of Onuist, may have been the first Pictish king whose father also had been king. He, or his predecessor, Talorgan, son of Drostan, may be the Dubthalorc, king of Picts 'this side' (presumably the south side) of the Mounth, who died in 782. The description seems to imply that it had not been usual for the Picts north and south of the Grampians to have separate overkingships. There follows the short reign of a man who appears in the annals twice as Conall, son of Tadg (both Irish names). The lists call him Canaul. The battle in which he was beaten by Constantine in 789 is said to be 'between Picts' (Anderson, 'Early Sources', 1.254). Conall escaped, and later appears as king of the Dal Riata.

Jane Bianchi (1776-1858), the widow of Francesco Bianchi (1752-1810), an Italian opera composer and the teacher of Henry Bishop. She was the daughter of John Jackson, an apothecary in Sloane Street, Chelsea, London, and had married Bianchi in 1800. Like Lacy, she was a well-known singer; she had made her debut in London on 25 April 1798, and performed at the Concerts of Ancient Music in 1800. As Mrs Bianchi she often sang at Windsor in the presence of George III and Queen Charlotte, and was considered one of the finest exponents of Handel's music, though in 1809 the 'Morning Chronicle' considered that 'her unaffectedness, her propriety of action, and her good taste' compensated for 'the defects of a very bad voice' ('BDA'). With Lacy she took part in the concerts given by Elizabeth Billington, Giuseppe Naldi, and John Braham at Willis's Rooms on 1 March 1809, and at the Vocal Concerts in the Hanover Square Rooms on 2 March 1810.

Arthur Hill-Trevor, first Viscount Dungannon (d. 1771), of Belvoir, co. Down, and Brynkinalt, Denbighshire, was the second son of Michael Hill of Hillsborough, and Anne, the daughter and heir of Sir John Trevor (1637-1717). He inherited the Trevor property from his father's half-brother, Marcus Hill (died 1751), who was son of William Hill and Mary, daughter of Marcus Trevor, first Viscount Dungannon of the first creation. He was chancellor of the Irish exchequer in 1754-5. On 17 February 1766 he was created Viscount Dungannon and Baron Hill of Olderfleet. He died in Dublin on 30 January 1771, and was buried at Belvoir. His second wife, whom he married in January 1737, was Anne, (1715-1799), daughter and heir of Edmund Francis Stafford of Brownstown, co. Meath. She died on 13 January 1799. Their daughter, Anne, married in February 1759 the earl of Mornington, and was mother of the first duke of Wellington and of Marquess Wellesley. There were two other daughters and a son, Arthur, who was father, with Letitia, eldest daughter of Hervey, first Viscount Mountmorres, of Arthur Hill-Trevor, second Viscount Dungannon; he succeeded his grandfather in the title, and died at Brynkinalt on 14 December 1837.

Ulick Canning de Burgh, Lord Dunkellin (1827-1867), politician, known throughout his life as Lord Dunkellin (from a subsidiary title of his father's), was born at St James's Square, London, on 12 July 1827. Educated at Eton College, he became an ensign in the Coldstream Guards in 1846, and held the rank of lieutenant-colonel from 1854 to 1860. He fought in the Crimea (being captured at Sevastopol), was military secretary to his uncle Lord Canning in India in 1856, and served on the staff of Sir James Outram during the Persian expedition of 1856-7. He was Liberal MP for Galway City, 1857-65, and for co. Galway, 1865-7. An Adullamite, he moved the famous amendment on the rating franchise during the committee stage of the 'Parliamentary Reform Bill', on 18 June 1866, which caused the resignation of Earl Russell's government later that month. Dunkellin, who was unmarried, suffered from prolonged ill health, and died at his father's home, 17 Stratton Street, London, on 16 August 1867. His grieving father erected a bronze statue of him in Galway, in 1874, but it was removed and destroyed, as a symbol of landlord tyranny, in 1922. His elder sister, Emily Charlotte de Burgh, later Lady Cork (1828-1912), long remembered her brother's role in bringing down Russell's administration ('The Times', 11 Oct 1912, 9).

Christabel Rose Coleridge (1843-1921), writer, was born on 25 May 1843 at St Mark's College, Chelsea, London, the second of Derwent Coleridge's three surviving children. As a young woman she helped in her brother Ernest's school, but she wished to be a writer and subsequently had at least fifteen novels published, including 'Lady Betty' (1869), 'An English Squire' (1881), 'A Near Relation' (1886), and 'The Prophet's Mantle' (1897). Many of her works were published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. From 1890 she helped to edit the magazines the 'Monthly Packet' and 'Friendly Leaves'. Christabel held conservative views on 'the woman question' and produced 'The Daughters who have not Revolted', a collection of essays, in 1894. She was a close friend of her distant cousin, the novelist Charlotte Mary Yonge, and they collaborated in the writing of 'Strolling Players' (1893). After Charlotte's death in 1901 Christabel published 'Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters' (1903), an authoritative arrangement of autobiographical and bibliographical material, interleaved with letters and comment. She died, unmarried, on 14 November 1921 at Cheyne, Bridge Road, Torquay, Devon.

Sir Alfred Lane Beit, second baronet (1903-1994), politician, philanthropist, and art collector, was born in London on 19 January 1903. Educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, he succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1930. As Beit trustee from 1930 to 1994 he ensured that the trust became a major source for the development of Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. In 1939 he married Clementine Mabel Kitty Mitford (1915-2005), second daughter of Major the Honourable Clement Mitford and cousin of the famous Mitford sisters. He was the Conservative member of parliament for South-East St Pancras from 1931 to 1945, and served as parliamentary private secretary to the secretary of state for the colonies (1944-5), but lost his seat in the 1945 election.

Eccles, Charlotte O'Conor (1863-1911), journalist and novelist, was born in Roscommon, Ireland, on 1 November 1863, the elder surviving daughter of Alexander O'Conor-Eccles of Ballinagard, near Roscommon. She was educated in Catholic convents at Upton Hall, near Birkenhead, and in Paris and Germany. Her European education was probably the source of her good knowledge of continental languages. A lecturer in Ireland for the board of agriculture and technical instruction, she was particularly interested in housing for the poor, and collaborated with Horace Plunkett in schemes for rural regeneration. In politics she was a supporter of home rule for Ireland. 
On taking up residence in London, probably in late 1890 or early 1891, Charlotte O'Conor Eccles sought work as a newspaper journalist, which she preferred to work on magazines, which she felt to be irregular and precarious. She had previous newspaper experience in Dublin, helping to sub-edit an evening newspaper, for which she undertook translations from American, Australian, French, and German periodicals, corrected proof, did general reporting, and conducted a ladies' column. Her article 'The experience of a woman journalist' (Eccles) describes vividly the difficulty she encountered in finding employment. In it she commented 'One is horribly handicapped in being a woman'. Her first big break came when she was hired by the London office of the 'New York Herald', where she was put on the staff at a salary of 3 guineas per week. The 'Herald' had a short life (2 February 1889 to 31 May 1891); she worked during the last six months of its existence and gained valuable experience. Thereafter, as she mastered the technicalities of the London newspaper world, she worked variously as sub-editor of a woman's paper, for weeklies, as London correspondent to provincial papers, and as a freelance. Other articles identified as hers include 'Irish housekeeping and customs in the last century' ('Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine', December 1888), 'A royal elopement' ('Dublin Review', 3rd ser., no. 48, 1890, 302-18), and 'Hospital where plague broke out' ('Nineteenth Century', no. 272, 1899, 591-602). Others have yet to be identified. She was on the staffs of the 'Daily Chronicle' and 'The Star'. 
As a novelist Charlotte O'Conor Eccles published 'The Rejuvenation of Miss Semaphore' (1897), using the pseudonym Hal Godfrey, and 'The Matrimonial Lottery' (1906). She translated from the Polish a novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz, a Nobel laureate, which was published in America in 1899 as 'Peasants of the West' and in England as 'Aliens of the West' (1904). She was a fellow of the Institute of Journalists and a member of the Writers', Lyceum, and Ladies' Park clubs in London. She died unmarried on 14 June 1911, at the age of forty-six at her home, 139A Alexandra Road, St John's Wood, London, of cerebral thrombosis.

Fyffe, William (1885-1947), comedian and actor, was born on 16 February 1885 at 36 Ferry Road, Dundee, the eldest child of John Fyffe (1864-1928), ship's carpenter, and Janet Rhynd Cunningham (1858-1949), music teacher. Shortly after Will was born his father left his job to form a touring company of actors who performed in a portable wooden theatre, called a geggy, which was assembled and dismantled at every venue. Will Fyffe started playing Little Willie in the stage version of Mrs Henry Wood's 'East Lynne' but soon graduated to adult roles, appearing as Polonius when just fifteen. Geggy actors had to be versatile and quick learners because programmes changed nightly and in later life Will Fyffe attributed much of his success, especially in films, to this early training. He married Lily Wilcock ('c'.1884-1917?), an actress, on 13 November 1905; they had two daughters. Fyffe left his father's company to gain experience in companies touring England and Wales but, as live theatre lost out to touring moving picture shows, decided to switch to the variety stage. His act followed the pattern set by earlier Scottish performers with songs in character interspersed with comic patter, and the years spent in England ensured that he was as readily understood there as he was in Scotland. 
About 1920 Fyffe offered his most famous song, 'I belong to Glasgow', to Harry Lauder, and when Lauder turned it down Fyffe performed it himself at the Glasgow Pavilion. It was a huge success and led to a booking at the London Palladium. By 1921 he was topping the bill in London and in 1922 appeared in the first of his five royal command performances. His first wife had died in a shipping tragedy, and on 23 February that year he married the singer Emmeline Eugenie Pooley (1896-1979); they had a daughter and son. In 1927 he made the first of many successful visits to North America and tours of Australia and South Africa followed. Not since Harry Lauder more than twenty years earlier had a Scottish comedian gained such acclaim; Fyffe and Lauder never performed together, but were friendly off-stage with shared passions for fishing and golf. Fyffe added quality of material and meticulous attention to detail to his flair for characterization. His widow wrote of his 'genius for living all his characters... which was shared by his genius for make up and dress to which he gave a lot of thought and attention' (Fyffe, 20 June 1955). 
A young simpleton, Daft Sandy, was Fyffe's greatest creation, in whom he combined comedy and pathos to telling effect. His characters such as the drunk working man were drawn from life and it was a habit of his to go incognito into public places just to observe his fellow men. He was also a supreme pantomimist and co-starred with Harry Gordon in a series of productions at the Glasgow Alhambra in the 1940s which are considered classics of their kind. Fyffe was the main comic lead, always named Willie, while Gordon took the part of the dame. Throughout his career Fyffe took pride in the fact that his material could never be considered suggestive or offensive and famously walked out of a production on New York's Broadway after the first night because it was 'a dirty show' (House, 'Music Hall Memories', 46). 
Fyffe made a number of films of which 'Owd Bob' (1938), 'The Brothers' (1947), and 'Rulers of the Sea' (1939) are perhaps the pick. He completed the last in Hollywood and turned down a number of lucrative offers to remain in America in order to return to Britain at the outbreak of the Second World War. By December 1939 he was entertaining troops in France; he was appointed CBE in 1942 for his war work and efforts for charities over many years. 
After an operation on his right ear in December 1947 Fyffe went to recuperate at the hotel he had bought in St Andrews. On 14 December he fell from the window of his suite and died in the local cottage hospital from the shock and injuries received. He was buried at the Western Necropolis in Glasgow on Wednesday 17 December 1947.

Jay, Edith Katherine Spicer (1847-1901), writer and philanthropist, was born on 6 March 1847 at 11 Norfolk Street, Park Lane, London, the daughter of Samuel Jay (1800/01-1881), barrister, and his wife, Elizabeth Maria Jane Spicer. Both sides of Jay's family had army connections. On her father's side she was the great-niece of Major Alexander Livingston of the 12th dragoons, a decorated hero in the Peninsular War; on her mother's side she was the granddaughter of Colonel Spicer of the 2nd Life Guards and lieutenant-colonel in the Queen's Bays. Jay was also related to Lord Farnborough and to Sir George Prescott, bt, of Theobald's Park, Hertfordshire. 
When Jay started publishing her books -- mostly fiction with military settings -- her pen-name, E. Livingston Prescott, paid allegiance to two of her forebears. The name also concealed her sex -- she was, after all, entering the indubitably masculine world of Kipling's poetry and fiction -- and reviewers tended to assume she was a man. Jay published at least eighteen books, several of them posthumously, between 1896 and 1904. Most were novels or collections of tales. Representative titles suggest some of Jay's fictional interests: 'The Rip's Redemption: a Trooper's Story' (1897); 'Scarlet and Steel: some Modern Military Episodes' (1897); 'Red-Coat Romances' (1898). Her plots often turn on the reformation of characters whose flaws include drunkenness and abuse of authority. She was especially exercised by the practice of flogging military prisoners. Reviewers' assessments of her fiction range from 'very cleverly written' ('New York Times', 17 May 1896) to 'these books do violence to every principle of good novel-writing' ('The Dial', 93). 
Jay's involvement with the army went beyond her family and her fiction. She served as honourable lady superintendent of the London Soldiers' Home and Guards' Home until her health failed. When in hopes of alleviating her health problems she moved to Sandgate on the Kent coast, Jay made her home available to the troopers stationed at nearby Shorncliffe camp at what she called 'Cavalry Circle'. She also appointed army men as two of the three executors of her will. 
Jay's commitment to worthy causes testifies to the generosity of her spirit. In addition to her work for the London Soldiers' Home and Guards' Home, she willed pictures and the royalties from her books after her death to the Home for Incurables, Streatham Common. She left bequests to the Bridge of Hope Mission, London, to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Not forgetting her army friends, she willed legacies to the Papillon Soldiers' Institute, Sandgate, and to the Soldiers' Christian Association. She was also associated with the Religious Tract Society, which published two of her books after her death, and with the Willow Dene Mission in Clapham. 
For over ten years Jay suffered from rheumatoid arthritis; she finally died from renal and cardiac arrest at her home, Channel Bower, Riviera, Sandgate, on 3 December 1901. So moved by her death were the soldiers of Shorncliffe camp that extraordinary arrangements were made for her to be buried on 9 December in the military cemetery there. Her coffin, draped in the union jack, was carried from her home to the burial-grounds accompanied by Sandgate coastguards and soldiers of the 3rd provisional regiment of dragoons. Shopkeepers along the route of the procession drew their blinds. According to her wish, a 'Bible' was placed in her grave.

Macrae, (John) Duncan Graham (1905-1967), actor, was born on 20 August 1905 at 118 Kirkland Street, Maryhill, Glasgow, the fourth of the six children of James Macrae (1871-1945), a sergeant in the Glasgow police force, and his wife, Catherine Graham (1869-1938). He grew up in a strict Presbyterian background, rooted in the highland traditions of his grandparents, but in his later years religion only figured peripherally. Educated at Allan Glen's School, he matriculated in the engineering faculty at Glasgow University in 1923-4, but did not graduate. He trained as a teacher at Jordanhill College of Education from 1925 to 1927, and taught until 1943. 
During the 1930s Macrae moved freely in Glasgow's left-wing intellectual and artistic circles. He became involved with its flourishing amateur theatre movement, where the influence of K. S. Stanislavsky's dramatic theories encouraged productions of Maksim Gorky, Henrik Ibsen, and Anton Chekhov. He headed the Project Company in 1934, then directed with the Glasgow Arts Theatre Group. He created the title role in Robert McLellan's 'Jamie the Saxt' for the Curtain company in 1937, and was the club's leading actor until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. As a conscientious objector, he was granted exemption from military service. He joined Molly Urquhart's company MSU in 1942-3, and played leading roles in plays by J. M. Barrie, J. Bridie, and J. B. Priestley. He married Margaret (Peggy) Scott (1907-1971), a teacher, in Glasgow in 1943. They had two daughters, Ann, born in 1945, and Christine, in 1948. 
Encouraged by James Bridie and Alastair Sim, Macrae turned professional in 1943. An original member of the newly founded Glasgow Citizens' Theatre Company, he gradually rose to prominence as a leading player. In a repertory which encompassed Shakespeare, Ibsen, Shaw, and Bridie, his most notable roles were Donald MacAlpine in Bridie's 'The Forrigan Reel' (1944), Inspector Goole in Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls' (1947), Quince in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', Flatterie/Pardoner in Robert Kemp's 'The Three Estates' (an adaptation of David Lindsay's sixteenth-century morality play) at the Edinburgh Festival (1948), Harry Magog in Bridie's 'Gog and Magog', the Dame in 'The Tintock Cup' (1949; also by Bridie, under the pseudonym A. P. Kellock), and the title role in Moliere's 'Tartuffe' (1951). The shift to pantomime at the Glasgow Alhambra in 1950-51 marked the beginning of a run of eight pantomimes, Christmas revues, and many other variety engagements, including 'white heather' tours to America (1960), Canada (1961), and Australia and New Zealand (1962), and '1045 and a' that', at the Edinburgh Festival (1966). He transferred effortlessly from legitimate stage to variety and back. 
Between 1952 and 1955, financially secure as a result of pantomime, Macrae formed the company Scottishshows in partnership with the playwright Tim Watson. Macrae as actor-manager toured Scotland with a different Scottish play each year. In 1956 he headed one of two repertory companies -- the second was led by Stanley Baxter -- formed by Henry Sherek to alternate between the King's, Glasgow, and the Lyceum, Edinburgh. Between 1957 and 1959 he appeared for the Citizens', Perth Theatre Company, Edinburgh Gateway, Dundee Repertory, and Jimmy Logan's Metropole in a varied selection of plays, including 'The Flouers o' Edinburgh' by R. M. McLellan, and 'Dr Angelus' and 'Let Wives Tak Tent' (both by Bridie). His London appearances included roles in Bridie's 'The Forrigan Reel' at Sadler's Wells (1945), 'Let Wives Tak Tent' at the Embassy (1949), Bridie's 'Mr Bolfry' at the Aldwych (1956), Ionesco's 'Rhinoceros' at the Royal Court and the Strand (1960), and Moliere's 'L'avare' at the Mermaid (1966). He toured in Joe Orton's 'Loot' (1965). His last stage performance was in Aristophanes' 'The Burdies' at the Edinburgh Festival in 1966. 
In 1946 Macrae took the leading role in his first film, 'The Brothers'. He went on to appear in a further fifteen films, mainly in supporting roles, including 'Whisky Galore' (1948), 'Greyfriars Bobby' (1960), and 'Tunes of Glory' (1960). His major success was as the grandfather in 'The Kidnappers' (1953). In the earlier part of his career Macrae broadcast regularly in radio drama productions, panel games, and variety shows. From 1958, adding to impressive critical and popular acclaim in both legitimate theatre and variety, he worked increasingly in television. In 1959 he created the title role in the 'Para Handy' series. The recitation 'The Wee Cock Sparra', on the BBC Hogmanay party in the same year, confirmed his celebrity. He became familiar in 'The Avengers', 'The Prisoner', 'Dr Finlay's Casebook', revues and chat shows such as 'Better Late', and in one particularly popular porridge advert. Songs, poems, and play extracts were commercially recorded by Scottish Records and released by EMI. 
Duncan Macrae figured significantly in the history of Scottish theatre, championing the national drama cause, improving the profession's working conditions, and fearlessly challenging the establishment. He was appointed first chairman of Scottish Equity in 1953, a position he held until his death. He wrote many articles and was in constant demand as a speaker. His pamphlet 'Be Not Too Tame Neither', on the state of the arts in Scotland, was published in November 1965 by the Federation of Theatre Unions. Most of his recommendations were adopted. Despite some notoriety over allegedly selfish practices on stage, and although lacking in technical training, his instinctive acting, coupled with an acknowledged genius for comedy, produced a provocative but mesmeric style that influenced a generation of actors. 
Macrae's strikingly tall, lean figure, angular face, and voice bearing traces of his Gaelic ancestry matched a singular if eccentric personality. He was devoted to his family, healthy exercise, Scotland, and the theatre. He died from a brain tumour on 23 March 1967 at the Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow. He was cremated at Linn crematorium, Glasgow, on 30 March. Two weeks later, the ashes were buried at Kippen, Stirlingshire.

Currie, (William) Finlay (1878-1968), actor, was born on 20 January 1878, at 35 Cumberland Street, Edinburgh, son of Annie Currie, Post Office clerk (his birth certificate states he was illegitimate and names no father). He completed his education at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and began his adult working life as an organist and choirmaster. However, he was attracted to the theatre and he began what turned out to be a successful career on the variety stage with an inauspicious appearance as a courtier in W. H. Murray's 'Cramond Brig' at the Pavilion, Edinburgh, in 1898. He then joined Adeler and Sutton's Pierrots, touring Scotland in concert parties. With his own act sufficiently developed Currie made his independent London debut in June 1902 at the South London Music-Hall, billed as 'Harry Colvo, the double-voiced vocalist'. By 1906 he was well enough established on the variety stage to undertake an American tour that included New York, where he played at Tony Pastor's renowned Vaudeville theatre on 14th Street. This success was followed by a period of over ten years working in Australia as the principal comedian in the company managed by Sir Benjamin Fuller. Finlay Currie's variety career is reported to have been encouraged by Harry Lauder. Currie returned to London in 1930 and pursued a career on the legitimate stage which tended to be overshadowed by his subsequent relatively high film profile. He appeared in more than twenty West End plays between 1930 and 1950, including Edgar Wallace's 'The Case of the Frightened Lady' at Wyndham's Theatre in 1931; 'Magnolia Street' by Golding and Rawlinson at the Adelphi in 1934; 'Duet in Floodlight' by J. B. Priestley at the Apollo in 1935; Ivor Novello's 'Crest of the Wave' at Drury Lane in 1937; and Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman' at the Phoenix in 1949. During this time he acted with various companies such as the Venturers, the Repertory Players, and the Stage Society. It was, however, on screen that Finlay Currie was destined to gain wide and lasting recognition as a talented and thoroughly professional character actor. In the film world he enjoyed the reputation of being willing to work in the most exacting circumstances, often travelling far to fulfil an engagement. His first film, 'The Case of the Frightened Lady' (1932), marked the beginning of a long and successful career. Halliwell's 'Filmgoer's Companion' (1977) described him as 'a welcome screen face well into his eighties'. In fact, increasing age, a portly physique, and craggy features framed by a mane of white hair made him a much sought after actor in biblical and historical epics, including 'Quo Vadis' (1951), 'Ivanhoe' (1952), 'Rob Roy' (1953), 'Ben Hur' (1959), and 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' (1964). He was instantly recognizable on screen, with the soft Scottish accent that he never completely disguised. His film credits, impressive in their diversity, include also 'Rome Express' (1932), 'The Edge of the World' (1938), 'The Brothers' (1946), 'The History of Mr Polly' (1949), 'Billy Liar' (1963), and 'Bunny Lake is Missing' (1965). While the nature of character acting often confines the actor to supporting roles, it does not inhibit the possibility of fine performances, and in 1951 Currie's portrayal of Queen Victoria's highland servant John Brown in 'The Mudlark' earned him high praise. But he gave possibly his most memorable performance as the convict Magwitch in the David Lean version of 'Great Expectations' in 1946. 
Currie continued to accept stage and television roles regardless of advancing years. The year 1965 saw him celebrating his eighty-seventh birthday by opening in a play in Connecticut in the USA, and at eighty-nine he played the bishop in the BBC television version of 'Les miserables', confirming his stamina and enduring appeal. A quiet man, in his private life he took his recreation in book collecting; maintaining his Scottish connections, he particularly favoured the work of Robert Burns. Finlay Currie was married to the American variety actress Maud Courtney (1884-1959), who first appeared on the London stage in 1901. She was the original performer of the song 'The Honeysuckle and the Bee'. They worked together for a time with Currie billed as 'Mr C' in 'Sketches at the Piano'. They had two children, George and Marion. Finlay Currie died from kidney and heart failure on 10 May 1968, at Chalfont and Gerrards Cross Hospital in Buckinghamshire.

Wallace, Nellie (1870-1948), music-hall entertainer, was born in Glasgow on 18 March 1870 to parents who both worked in the music-hall: her father gave 'lectures', and her mother played the piano. By the age of twelve she had made her own debut as a clog dancer at the Steam Clock Music-Hall, Birmingham, and she subsequently worked solo as La Petite Nellie, and as one of the Three Sisters Wallace in pantomime and in music-hall. About 1892 she married actor and manager William J. Liddy and attempted to establish a career in the legitimate theatre for herself; she found, however, that as the doomed Little Willie in Alfred Kempe's version of 'East Lynne' she tended to elicit laughter rather than tears, and she liked to claim that she abandoned her acting career after being sneezed off her horse while playing Joan of Arc. In 1894 Nellie Wallace returned to pantomime as second girl and understudy to the star, Ada Reeve, in 'Jack and Jill' at the Comedy Theatre, Manchester, where the cast included the young George Robey. On 9 March 1895 Reeve left the show to have a child, and Wallace took over as principal girl. Her music-hall career blossomed, and her appearance at the London Palladium in 1910 confirmed the success of the image she had established, as the 'essence of eccentricity'. While there were other performers who adopted the old-maid persona expressed in songs such as 'Blasted Oak' and 'I've been jilted by the baker, Mister White', Wallace gave it a new dimension. Along with 'the wife's mother', the old maid was a staple topic for jokes that represented woman as a threat while continuing to endorse a conservative ideology of the family. Wallace, however, completely eschewed the predatory aspect of the persona: when she narrated her search for a man ('Crossed in love?', asked her stooge. 'No', she replied, 'I've been run over'), the effect was of a vitality so powerful that she would wear out an ordinary man in a couple of hours. At the same time she exempted members of the audience from her search. Rather than potential mates they became members of her own family, listening to the confidences of a much-loved spinster aunt, at a time when aunts were a vital part of the family unit, contributing both earnings and caring skills in households struggling to cope with recession and often deprived by war of their main breadwinners. 
Wallace's stage spinsterhood liberated her into anarchy, what 'The Times' called her 'saving touch of the devil' (25 Nov 1948). The true focus of her act was her enjoyment of her power as a performer. One of her songs had a chorus that ran 'It's excitement, all excitement -- if you're after anything tasty, what price me?' As Wilson Disher commented, 'Just to be let loose on the stage gives her so much joy that she performs an 'entrechat' in each corner' (Green, 287). She had a weird beauty, a face of aquiline elegance, marred only by buck teeth, which she transformed into a clownish mask with elaborately arched black brows. Her clothes were a parody of middle-class respectability, with elastic-sided boots, a sensible tartan skirt (that occasionally revealed enormous red flannel bloomers), and a moth-eaten fur tippet ('my little bit of vermin'). She sometimes varied it with an evening dress of impossible extravagance, its skirt so tight that her efforts to pick up a dropped fan involved outrageous contortions. Her songs were charged with energy, erupting into high-spirited yodelling and arguments with the orchestra; her sketches tipped the balance from the merely eccentric to the surreal: in one, which captivated the young Alec Guinness, she deconstructed one of the archetypal images of spinsterhood, the nurse assisting the noble (male) doctor: 'Nellie stood by looking very prim, but every now and then she would dive under the sheet and extract with glee and a shout of triumph quite impossible articles -- a hot water bottle, a live chicken... Finally she inserted, with many wicked looks, a long rubber tube which she blew down. The body inflated rapidly to huge proportions and then, covered in its sheet, took slowly to the air. (Guinness, 10)' With the decline of variety Wallace took to revue, notably in Albert de Courulles' 'Whirl of the World', which ran for 627 performances at the London Palladium in 1924, and in George Black's 'crazy' shows between 1931 and 1934. She was also associated with the comedian with whom she shared her pantomime debut, George Robey: one of the few female pantomime dames, she replaced him as Dame Trot at the London Hippodrome in 1922, and in March 1925 she opened with him in the London Palladium revue 'Sky High', which ran for 309 performances. 
During the Second World War Wallace toured with the Entertainments National Service Association, her surreal humour in tune with the popular radio comedies of the day. In February 1948 she began touring with Don Ross's company in 'Thanks for the Memory'. The cast were invited to appear at that year's royal variety performance at the London Palladium on 1 November. Wallace sang 'A Boy's Best Friend is his Mother', and then collapsed. She rallied to finish the show, but was admitted to hospital and died three weeks later at the Bethanie Nursing Home, 12 Hornsey Lane, Upper Holloway, London, on 24 November 1948. She had been a widow for many years, and her only daughter had died in March 1948.

Sichel, Edith Helen (1862-1914), historian and philanthropist, was born on 13 December 1862 at 25 Princes Gardens, London, the daughter of Michael Sichel (1819-1884), a cotton merchant, and his wife, Helena Reiss (1833-1888); her parents were Christians, but of German Jewish descent. She was well educated, becoming proficient in French, German, and Latin. In 1876 she met and formed a close friendship with Mary Elizabeth Coleridge (1861-1907), with whom she went to read Greek classics with William Johnson Cory (1823-1892), the poet and former master at Eton. She also attended Professor John Wesley Hales's lectures on Elizabethan and Jacobean drama in 1880. 
At the age of twenty-three Edith Sichel joined the Whitechapel branch of the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants. Through her work here she met Canon Samuel Barnett and his wife Henrietta, and also Emily Ritchie, who became her closest friend. Her philanthropy, informed by her deep Christian faith, was essentially conservative and individualistic: accepting as God-given the class system of Victorian society, she held that the core of her mission was the creation and development of personal friendships, and had little interest in administrative and committee work which resulted from the growth of institutional social work. 
Sichel's faith in personal initiative in philanthropic work was evidenced by her private projects, pursued after bad health had forced her to abandon her work in the East End in 1891. In 1889 she and Emily Ritchie established a nursery for East End workhouse children in Chiddingfold near Witley, where they were renting a cottage. When they moved to The Hurst, Hambledon, in 1891 they started a home for Whitechapel girls, where they intended to train them for domestic service. In 'The confessions of an amateur philanthropist' (reprinted posthumously in 'Old and New', 1917) Edith Sichel gave an amusing description of her endeavours with her protegees: working with about six girls at a time, she combined domestic training in housework and cookery (a laundry proved unsuccessful) with outdoor rambles, intended to improve their health and -- with the aid of poetry and botany -- widen their minds. A similar project for older girls proved unsuccessful, but the original home was still thriving when Sichel died. She was also treasurer of a boys' home in Islington for twenty-two years, and from 1893 to 1905 she was manager of the Ashburnham and Park Walk Schools in Chelsea. Subsequently she assisted school-leavers seeking employment. 
However, Edith Sichel's leading interest from the 1890s was her literary career. Her first published work, the tale of a Wapping girl entitled 'Jenny', which appeared in the 'Cornhill Magazine' in 1887, was inspired by her East End work. She became a steady contributor to journals and magazines, including 'The Pilot', the 'Monthly Review', the 'Times Literary Supplement', and the 'Quarterly Review', revealing herself to be an enthusiastic, perceptive, and generous reviewer of histories, biographies, and memoirs. In 1893 she published 'Worthington Junior', an undistinguished novel, before turning to the more congenial pursuit of French history. 'The Story of Two Salons' (1895) described the salons of the Suards and Pauline de Beaumont, while 'The Household of the Lafayettes' (1897) dealt with the pre- and post-Revolution history of a prominent French family. In 1903, with G. W. E. Russell, she published 'Mr Woodhouse's Correspondence', a collection of comic correspondence (which had originally appeared in 'The Pilot') between the family and associates of the imaginary Algernon Wentworth-Woodhouse, a rich, miserly, and valetudinarian egotist. This was followed in 1906 by 'The Life and Letters of Alfred Ainger', a tribute to a close friend. Another such tribute appeared in 1910, when she contributed a memoir to 'Gathered Leaves', a posthumous collection of pieces by Mary Coleridge, whose death in 1907 was a considerable blow. 'Women and Men of the French Renaissance' (1901) foreshadowed more directly her 'magnum opus', a two-volume account of the life and career of Catherine de' Medici, published as 'Catherine de'Medici and the French Reformation' (1905) and 'The Later Years of Catherine de'Medici' (1908). 'The Renaissance', written for H. A. L. Fisher's 'Home University Library of Modern Knowledge' series, and 'Michel de Montaigne', both published in 1911, were the last of her works to appear in her lifetime. In humorous self-deprecation, Sichel described herself as 'only a gossiping lady's maid who curls the hair of History'. In fact her histories were well researched in primary as well as secondary sources, and she believed that a woman historian could have a distinctive and serious role in exploring the more personal and domestic aspects of history. Vivid, impressionistic portraits of many leading figures in French courts and salons bear witness to her appropriately Renaissance belief that history was 'human life remembered' (Ritchie, 147, 45). 
In 1911 Edith Sichel began to hold classes for female prisoners at Holloway Prison, where her sister was already a visitor. She became deeply interested in the 1914 'Prison Reform Bill', drawing up a report for the commissioners of prisons and attending police courts to examine sentencing. This additional work may have contributed to her unexpected death, on the night of 13 August 1914, while visiting friends at Borwick Hall, near Carnforth, Lancashire. 
Edith Sichel was remembered by her contemporaries as a woman of great charm, witty, cultivated, and cheerful, with a genius for friendship. Both her books and her letters reveal an attractive and vivacious personality. While her poetry is generally third rate and laboured, her prose is elegant, absorbing, and seasoned with epigrams. Her appearance was striking rather than handsome -- photographs show a large-featured, dark-haired woman, a sort of beautified George Eliot -- but observers commented on her expressive face, 'full of mobility, vigour and refinement' (Cornish, 217).

Vynne, Eleanora Mary Susanna (1857-1914), journalist and political activist, was born at 2 Caroline Cottages, St Ann's Road, Kennington, Surrey, on 31 October 1857, the youngest of three daughters of Charles Vynne (1826/7-1881), accountant, and his wife, Sarah Anne, 'nee' Clarke (1831/2-1896). The Vynnes were an old Norfolk family, corn merchants based around Swaffham and Narborough, many of whom became active members of the Baptist church. They joined forces with another local Baptist family, the Everetts, and Vynne and Everett became a major agricultural supplier in the area. 
During her childhood Nora's family moved to Rickerby, Cumberland, where her father managed a company that manufactured fertilizer. She was educated at home and her youthful artistic talent won her prizes, but she started her working life as a teacher in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire. When her father died she moved to London and immediately started contributing to a variety of newspapers and magazines, including 'The Speaker', 'Sketch', 'Gentlewoman', and 'Winter's Weekly'. She published her first volume of short stories at the age of twenty-three. 'The Blind Artist's Pictures' (1893) was dedicated to John Strange Winter, a pseudonym for Mrs Arthur Stannard (Henrietta Stannard), founding editor of 'Winter's Weekly', 'to whose kindly help and encouragement' Vynne said she owed much. Winter, who was the influential president of the Writer's Club in Fleet Street, published Vynne's stories in her first issues, including one on the front cover with a portrait of the author. 
This book was an immediate success and won Vynne excellent reviews. J. M. Barrie described the short stories as the best he had ever read. A year later she published a second collection, 'Honey of Aloes and Other Stories', and in 1895 brought out her first full-length novel, 'A Man and his Womankind', a story of three women, including a journalist, who sacrifice their own lives to protect one man. 
In September 1896 Vynne initiated a postal school of journalism, which ran until January 1898, in the columns of 'Atalanta'. For 10's'. a year subscribers were entitled to compete in monthly competitions and have their efforts criticized by Miss Vynne, who directed their studies and gave practical advice and counselling. This included a warning to women against 'indulging your own emotion instead of rousing the emotion of your readers'. But she also advised 'spelling need not trouble you, compositors can all spell'. Prize winners of the school were awarded an Oxford scholarship of $20. 
By 1900 Vynne was contributing articles to a variety of journals and giving lectures, and her growing reputation as a feminist and political writer led to her being invited in 1903 by the Committee of the Freedom of Labour Defence to write, with Helen Blackburn, 'Women under the Factory Act'. In it she advised women to stick to the law in case employers decided to hire fewer women, but added: 'lest their obedience to law should be mistaken for approval of it, let all women who find restrictions cause them loss or inconvenience and all women who claim to enjoy the liberty men would certainly refuse to give up -- namely the liberty to earn extra money -- consult with each other and lodge protests.' Vynne worked for the weekly tabloid 'Women's Tribune' from its first issue in May 1906, writing chiefly about homeworking and the sweated industries, until it folded later that year. Within two months she had resurrected the paper under a new title -- 'Women and Progress' -- and become joint editor with Lady Frances Balfour. Both papers were based on the assumption that all intelligent, tax-paying women desired equal rights of citizenship with male citizens, but they were not primarily suffrage journals: housing reform, temperance reform, and poor-law reform were all considered urgent needs as well. Vynne urged moderation in demanding the suffrage, arguing that an age limit was acceptable as long as it was the same for both sexes. Girls who should forfeit the right to vote included those 'who have been found guilty of any fraud or dishonesty, cruelty, or neglect of responsibilities voluntarily undertaken' ('Women and Progress', 2 Nov 1906). Vynne herself described the paper as 'a high-class women's journal dealing with all the questions of the day and chronicling, impartially, all women's movements'. It lasted until June 1914, when it ran out of funds, ironically just as circulation was rising, advertisements coming in, and many of her readers promising to help by becoming shareholders. 
Vynne wrote a number of other books: 'The Pieces of Silver' (1911); a light romance entitled 'So it is with the Damsel' (1913); 'The Priest's Marriage' (1899; repr. 1911); and a series of one-act plays which were put on in the provinces, as well as a five-act play produced by the Play Actors. She was a member of the Institute of Journalists and the Society of Women Journalists as well as the Writer's Club, where on one occasion a fellow member described her short stories as 'brilliant' (White). She never married. As she became established as a writer she considerably understated her age, and was wrongly believed to be forty-four at the time of her death, which took place on 18 February 1914 at 3 Cambridge Lodge Villas, Mare Street, Hackney, London, from breast cancer.

Willard, Frances Elizabeth (1839-1898), social activist and suffragist, was born on 28 September 1839 in Churchville, New York, the fourth of five children (only three of whom survived infancy) of Mary Thompson Hill (1805-1892), a teacher, and Josiah Flint Willard (1805-1868), a gentleman farmer and businessman. Willard, by all accounts plain in appearance, possessed a strong mind, a quick wit, and enormous personal charm, which won her many friends and admirers but few suitors. Her only serious romance, with Methodist minister and future president of Northwestern University Charles Fowler, ended in 1862 when Willard broke off their eight-month engagement. With this gesture Willard opted for a life of independence, work, and female companionship; her most intimate friendships were to be with women who provided her with the emotional, intellectual, and often financial support to pursue her reform work. 
Descended on both sides from English puritans who emigrated to Massachusetts in the seventeenth century, Willard lived nearly all of her life in the mid-west (Oberlin, Ohio, 1841-6; Janesville, Wisconsin, 1846-58; Evanston, Illinois, 1858-98), and fully imbibed the Methodism and Free Soil republicanism of her parents and neighbours. The monotony of life on the frontier sharpened Willard's awareness of the restrictions that gender placed on her activity and contributed to her intense desire for education and for 'useful' intercourse with the world. Taught by her mother and by private tutors until she was sixteen, she eagerly attended the local schoolhouse in 1856, Milwaukee Female College in 1857, and North Western Female College in Evanston, Illinois, from which she graduated valedictorian in 1859. Her reading of John Stuart Mill and Margaret Fuller, together with an extended trip to Europe and the Middle East (1868-70), cemented her commitment to the woman movement. 
In 1870, after teaching for ten years at various secondary schools and women's colleges, Willard became president of the Evanston College for Ladies. When the school was merged with Northwestern University in 1873, however, Willard was demoted to dean by her former fiance. Her autonomy seriously diminished, she resigned the following year and turned her considerable talents to the temperance crusade. Having served simultaneously as president of the Chicago Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and corresponding secretary of the National WCTU from 1874 to 1877, Willard was voted president of the latter in 1879, a position she held until her death. Her interest in temperance was an extension of her ongoing involvement in the woman movement. A member of Sorosis and the American Suffrage Association, Willard helped found the Association for the Advancement of Women (1873) and the International Council of Women (1888), and served as the first president of the National Council of Women. Irreproachably feminine, Willard avoided the taint of 'militancy' and 'mannishness' that plagued many suffragists by couching her pleas for the franchise in the language of domesticity. Under the banner of 'home protection' Willard won respectability for the WCTU while subtly moving it away from the female realm of moral suasion and into the masculine world of politics. Willard prompted the WCTU to endorse a wide range of legislative reforms, including women's suffrage, and brought it into close co-operation with both the prohibition and the populist parties, though she failed in her efforts to fuse the two into a single, broad-based reform party. A gifted orator and a skilled organizer, Willard dramatically increased the size and strength of the WCTU. In 1891 she was elected president of the World WCTU. This position, along with her new-found friendship with Lady Henry Somerset, head of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA), brought her growing influence in British reform circles. 
Between 1892 and 1897 Willard spent more than half her time in Britain, residing with Lady Henry at Eastnor Castle. In England Willard's conversion to Christian socialism (begun years earlier) was made complete. She joined the Fabian Society in 1893 and redoubled her commitment to state-sponsored reform. Though she continued to run both the National (American) and World WCTUs, Willard now also served as corresponding editor of the 'Woman's Signal' and vice-president of the BWTA. In her efforts to assist Lady Henry move the BWTA away from its single-issue focus and toward the American 'do everything' policy, Willard accompanied her on extended speaking tours, addressing large, enthusiastic crowds throughout Great Britain in support of temperance and other reform causes. Willard continued to be politically active in England: elected vice-president of the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1893, she worked closely with the Women's Liberal Federation and campaigned for temperance candidates of the Liberal Party in the 1895 elections. That same year she and Somerset took up yet another cause -- the plight of Armenian Christians. In May both women were on hand for a mass rally at London's St James's Hall, and that summer, while vacationing in France, they personally arranged for the medical treatment and resettlement of refugees they encountered in Marseilles. 
Frances Willard died at the Royal Empire Hotel in New York on 17 February 1898, the victim of chronic pernicious anaemia; her remains were cremated in Chicago on 9 April. At the time of her death she was probably the best-known woman in America and had written twelve books (of which her autobiography, 'Glimpses of Fifty Years', 1889, is the most important) as well as numerous newspaper columns, and given thousands of speeches. Though generally revered by the English and American reform communities, Willard was often criticized by both the conservative and radical factions thereof. For the latter group, as for some scholars, Willard's reputation as a reformer had been tainted by her equivocal stand on racial equality, her support of immigration restriction, and her use of nativist language. But to her many friends and admirers she was an icon for reform; in 1905 the state of Illinois put her statue in the Capitol building at Washington, 'a tribute to the progress of women, as well as to her own greatness' (Strachey, 295).
