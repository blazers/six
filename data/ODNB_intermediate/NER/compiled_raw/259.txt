(Edward) Morland Lewis (1903-1943) was born on 25 May 1903 at Morfa House, Carmarthen, youngest of the ten sons of Benjamin Archibald Lewis (1857-1946), gas engineer, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Fuller. He studied (like Gosse some twenty years before) at the St John's Wood School of Art and the Royal Academy Schools before joining Sickert's class in 1927. He painted landscapes and townscapes in England and France, adapting the lessons of Sickert, for instance the use of underpaintings, to produce rich-toned and lively records of the everyday scenes around him. He painted the streets of London and Paris and landscapes in Ireland and around Ferryside, a fishing village near his native Carmarthen. He exhibited with the London Group from 1929 (member 1932). On 20 May 1940 he married another member of the London Group, the painter Kathleen Margaret Godfrey-Faussett-Osborne ('b'. 1911), daughter of Henry Bryan Godfrey Godfrey-Faussett-Osborne, a retired civil servant. During the Second World War he served as a camouflage officer in north Africa where he died of malaria on 4 August 1943. Paintings by Lewis are in the Tate collection, London, the Government Art Collection, and the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff.

William Coppin (1805-1895). William Coppin was born on 9 October 1805 and was a surveyor for ships and engines of the Board of Trade and of the Londonderry emigration board. An important figure in the River Foyle shipbuilding industry, in the mid-nineteenth century he employed 500-700 men. His most significant construction was the steamer 'Great Northern' (1842), ahead of its time in being screw-propeller driven; but despite conversion to naval specifications, it failed to win a government contract. Although he subsequently built several smaller vessels, after a disastrous dockyard fire in 1846 Coppin turned his attention to salvage. In the same year he failed to refloat SS 'Great Britain', which had run aground off Dundrum Bay, co. Down. Nevertheless, he successfully raised more than 140 ships. Between 1857 and 1886 he also lodged several patents for effective maritime and rail inventions.

Henry Harries (bap. 1821, d. 1849), it has been suggested, was born on 30 June 1816, though the Caeo parish baptismal entry for Harry, the eldest son of John and Lettice Harries of Pant-Coi, was recorded on 7 November 1821. He was described in later life as having 'a pale face, very dark hair, hanging down in ringlets over his narrow shoulders, grey eyes, and a very high narrow forehead.... His health was very delicate, owing to a weak chest' (Price, 56). Henry followed his father's footsteps and was educated at The Cowings and at Haverfordwest grammar school before attending London University. Between 1839 and 1842 Henry lived with his mother at Aberdar, a house on their estate, while Pant-Coi was being rebuilt. During this period he met Hannah Marsden, a teacher at Caeo, and the daughter of a workman on the Pant-Coi estate, and on 4 November 1842 they were married at Caeo church. The marriage, however, was viewed with horror by Henry's family as it was felt that he had married beneath his social status, and allegedly the marriage turned out to be an unhappy one. Harries nevertheless accepted his fate and stated, 'I cannot help it. I must marry her. I dare not cross my planet' (NL Wales, MS 11119B). They had three children: Victoria Letitia, born in March 1843; John, born in March 1844; and Henry Harri Harries, born in April 1846.

He toured the mining region of Leadhills, examining the process of extracting the lead, which was mainly sent to Holland for use in lead glaze, and also its by-product, silver. He visited several great houses on the way to St Andrews, noting forestry and plantings. At Leith he visited salt works, sugar boilers, and soap manufactories. He took in a coalmine near Kinghorn, and at Dryden saw working one of the earliest Newcomen engines to reach Scotland. Kalmeter also toured England; in Bristol he called on Nehemiah Champion (1649-1722) ['see under 'Champion family (per. c.1670-1794)], who allowed him to look over his brass-foundry. Kalmeter wrote two important works on the iron industry, parts of which were incorporated with Emanuel Swedenborg's 'Opera philosophica and mineralia' (1734). Swedenborg (1688-1722) was better known as a philosopher, but he travelled in England in 1710-12 before being appointed to the Bergskollegium in 1716.

Reinhold Rutker Angerstein (1718-1760), ironmaster, a member of Jernkontoret, the Swedish ironmasters' association, founded in 1747. Its purpose was to find a solution to the difficulties then besetting the Swedish iron industry, principally poor demand and low prices. As chemical and technical learning advanced, the Swedes realized that they should concentrate on high quality. When English ironmasters discovered how to use coal in the manufacture of wrought iron the Swedes were eager to inspect the process. Between 1753 and 1755 Angerstein was welcomed by Champion in Bristol; he also looked at the manufacture of steel, tinplate, and glass, and the process of desilvering lead. He traversed England and left voluminous notes on prices, wages, and conditions of commerce and industry, with comments on London's Swedish colony.

John Ludwig Robsahm (fl. 1760-1761) extended spying techniques because he was eager to obtain all sorts of secret information. He arrived in 1760 and stayed for a year. He was in Bristol in 1761 and visited Champion's works after dark, although Champion was one of the few industrialists to keep relatively open house for foreign visitors. Robsahm managed to see Benjamin Huntsman's famous steel casting works, but did not fully comprehend the secret process; he also investigated a zinc works near Bristol. Huntsman's secret was finally uncovered by Benkt Qvist Andersson, a mining engineer who was in England in 1766-7. He set up near Stockholm the first cast-steel works outside England.

Morton Waern (fl. 1754-1756) was in England to learn about crown glass manufacture, the first project proposed by the Konglige Allernaadigst Octrojerade Norske Compagnie, set up to exploit Norway's natural resources. He travelled to Newcastle upon Tyne, then the centre of the industry, and also to Leith, Hull, Bristol, Liverpool, and Yarmouth, obtaining drawings of furnaces and information on the composition of the glass and sending home reports and samples of raw materials. All his correspondence went through intermediaries so as to prevent detection. His most important task was to persuade skilled men to move to Norway, and he tried to recruit a team consisting of master, gatherer, blower, and finisher from the same glasshouse, so that they could work well together. But suspicion was aroused when he tried to suborn workmen; he was arrested and imprisoned in Newgate. Granted bail, he fled the country, taking his notes and papers with him. He had earlier succeeded in recruiting men in Newcastle and Liverpool, and they set up the first crown glass factory at Hurdal, 80 kilometres north of Christiania.

Jons Mathias Ljungberg (1748-1812), a Swede by birth who became professor of mathematics and astronomy at Kiel and a Danish civil servant. He asked for six months' leave to travel abroad in order to study mathematics and astronomy and to purchase instruments. His first visit to Britain in 1777 was uneventful, but when he made another request in 1778 he was seen as the ideal person to bring back a spinning-machine and associated equipment. He failed to acquire the machine, but brought sufficient information to allow one to be constructed in Copenhagen. In 1780 he severed his association with Kiel and moved to Kommercekollegiet. In 1787 Ljungberg was arrested in London just as he was loading three years' harvest of technical espionage onto a ship bound for Denmark. The customs inspectors uncovered patented machinery, scientific instruments, models, drawings, and notebooks. The haul included items from the Wedgwood potteries at Etruria and also containers of cobalt, lead, and manganese ores. His notes indicated visits to Staffordshire, Cornwall, Birmingham, Coalbrookdale, Derby, Manchester, Leeds, Matlock, and Nottingham. Ljungberg had earlier been caught bribing workmen to bring him measurements of kilns and other equipment. Before the government could arrange for his notes to be translated and encourage manufacturers to bring charges, the Danish legation put up the $300 bail set, and he was freed and fled; furthermore, the legation bought his confiscated goods at auction, and eventually most of his plunder was returned to him. He went back to Kommercekollegiet, and the fruits of this expedition gradually appeared in the pottery and porcelain manufactories of Denmark. In 1793 he was back in England, this time studying the canal system.

Nikolay Ivanovich Korsakov (1749-1788) was sent by the Petersburg Engineering Corps to study canal building. He arrived in London in April 1775, studied in Oxford for a year, and set out the following May for Scotland, bearing letters of introduction to John Smeaton, who recommended that he look first at the Forth and Clyde Canal. Throughout his tour Korsakov took copious detailed notes of canals, mills, foundries, manufactories, and machines, concerning not just their construction, but also their adoption and development, not omitting the patent system. He managed to get into a number of otherwise closed places by providing himself with letters of introduction, and thus at Newcastle saw a machine for gun boring. At the Carron ironworks he was not permitted to see the gun boring machinery and could make only general sketches. He spent three months in Glasgow, was made a freeman of the city, and visited Glasgow and Edinburgh universities. On his way south he spent time on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and on the Bridgewater, the latter with its aqueduct over the River Irwell being a famous sight. He called on Josiah Wedgwood, then hurried on to the Soho works of Matthew Boulton and John Fothergill. While these two men were eager to publicize their products with a view to entering the Russian market, there was always a reluctance to admit foreigners freely to the works. Fothergill went to Russia in 1776; James Watt, who had been invited to settle there in 1771, was hoping to sell engines to Russia, but Korsakov, while admiring Watt, did not realize the full potential of Watt engines and advised his masters to keep to Newcomen engines if Watt's charges seemed high. 
Korsakov was also invited to John Wilkinson's foundries at Bilston and Broseley, where he saw a blowing machine for coke smelting of iron ore and lesser machines. He next visited Southampton and Portsmouth before returning to Leeds, where at last he was able to meet Smeaton in person. His last six months were spent in Oxford drawing up his canal plans. Korsakov was impressed by what he saw, noting it with an observant and critical eye and appreciating both craft skills and the university education which he sampled. He spent two years in France and Italy before returning to Russia. He was not employed on canals but went to the newly annexed Crimea, where he built the city that became Sevastopol. He died in an accident during the Turkish War in 1788.

He failed in this task, but was able to see a screw cutting lathe for the Royal Mint, a lead drawing machine for the Admiralty, dies for coining, gear cutting machinery, a boring machine, and a silver and gold sheet rolling mill. He also discovered the secret of steel smelting, which made possible the casting of hollow steel cylinders for lathe chucks.

Charles Albert (b. 1767, d. in or after 1834), originally from Strasbourg, had previously spent a year in Manchester when in 1790 he was approached by two acquaintances who intended to set up a cotton mill in Toulouse. They asked him to go to England to examine textile machinery and recruit workmen for the Toulouse mill. Albert settled again in Manchester and found an accomplice, with whose help he set about his tasks. He was in London in November 1791 to meet the two men he had recruited, but one failed to appear and Albert heard that the man planned to denounce him. Albert sent his recruit to France with the notes and drawings and returned to Manchester, where he was arrested in December. Offered his freedom in exchange for helping to extradite the man who was in France, Albert refused for the patriotic reason that France needed skilled men. 
Albert was sent to Lancaster Castle to await trial; meanwhile the French envoy and the acquaintances who had sent him to England pledged support and raised $500 for his bail. However, at Newgate three charges were laid against him with bail set at $500 on each, and as this sum was not forthcoming Albert was returned to Lancaster. In August 1792 he was found guilty, sentenced to a year in prison, and fined $500. When his term expired no money was produced, and he spent another four years in prison as a debtor. Meanwhile the Toulouse mill prospered, especially as the French Revolution had increased the need for military uniforms. 
Eventually John Higgin, the prison governor, petitioned for Albert's release. Albert was befriended by the Johnson family of Bolton-le-Sands, and on his release in December 1796 he married their daughter Elizabeth (died 1834) and left England with instructions not to return unless the fine was paid. He sought to recover the promised money from his acquaintances, but they had no time for him; at length he took them to court, won his case, and later still was reimbursed for his pains. He settled in Strasbourg as an engineer and inventor. His years in England were not wasted; in the Paris Exhibition of 1806 he won a gold medal and 6000 francs for his invention of spinning and weaving machinery and a small steam engine. After his wife's death in 1834 Albert sent to her family medals commemorating her birth, marriage, and death and a precis of his story.

Gabriel Jars (1732-1769) was the son of an owner of copper mines in the Lyonnais, where he was trained before coming to the attention of Trudaine, minister of commerce, under whose patronage he visited mines in central Europe. His brief was to learn about minerals, metallurgy, and dyestuffs derived from minerals. In July 1764 he was sent to Britain, ostensibly on a scientific and educational tour but in fact with detailed instructions to discover many aspects of industry and manufacture. Jars went first to Newcastle where he learned English. He then examined coalmines in that district and in lowland Scotland, looking at the regulations, the prices, and the uses of the various types of coal, including that for coke, a substance not known in France. He then looked at the lead-silver mines and their management and the Cornish tin mines with their stannary laws, calling in on any copper mines which happened to lie on his route. He was also commanded to investigate the iron smelting practices, steel making, and the source of iron ore for cementation, and he was to obtain drawings of the machinery for imparting a high polish to steel and copper artefacts. He was to discover how English files were cut and tempered to make them harder than those manufactured in Germany. Besides this exhaustive set of demands, Jars was to look at sulphuric acid production and the manufacture of earthenware, pottery, and paper, and to investigate the breeding of English sheep and to enquire whether it was possible to obtain any of these animals. 
Before he left France, Jars asked the expatriate Englishman John Holker to recommend a trustworthy agent, and on arrival he contacted the marquis de Blosset, intelligence adviser at the French embassy. On his northern tour he was able to compile detailed reports on the Newcastle mines, coke works in Cumberland, the use of coal in glasshouses, and the various practices of forging and casting. He visited the famous Carron ironworks in southern Scotland where 800 workers were employed mining coal and iron ore, making coke, smelting, and casting. He also visited the alum mines of Whitby and the salt mines in Northwich. 
On the manufacturing side, Jars reported on earthenware manufacture in the north-east, in Staffordshire and at Liverpool, and also on porcelain and the invention of printing on pottery. He examined the process of file manufacture at Newcastle and at Sheffield. He visited the briefly important copper mines in Yorkshire and Staffordshire, and smelting works near Derby, Bristol, and Hayle in Cornwall, although at Derby and at the brass making works at Cheadle he was prevented from seeing as much as he wished. He was able to see over the lead mines and to compare the technology with that in Europe. On his way back to London he visited a sulphuric works in Wandsworth, but could only glance round the laboratory, which the owner had staffed with Welsh women whose limited English prevented them from disclosing the secrets of manufacture. On his return, Jars was rewarded with government and academic favours, and he was later sent on further strenuous tours within Europe. He died from sunstroke in the Auvergne in August 1769.

Le Camus de Limare (b. 1736), a Louviers industrialist, went to England in 1781 at the height of the war against France (part of the American War of Independence) to examine the production of copper sheathing for warships and to recruit workmen for its manufacture. As a good English speaker, he was able to travel in England. His route is not known, but may have taken in Thomas Williams's works at Holywell in Flintshire and on the Thames at Marlow and Wraysbury. He managed to find workmen to operate a plant which he set up at Romilly, using water power and emulating the English manufacture of regularly rolled copper plates and nails of a better shape than those previously used in French vessels. 
The problem with sheathing was that catalytic corrosion took place in sea water when copper sheets were fastened by iron nails, and this could leave the hull literally leaking like a sieve. The solution was first found in Britain with the manufacture of hardened copper bolts. French scientists were eager to learn about this, and when the war ended a party consisting of one of the de Wendel family of ironmakers and other French officers called on several iron and copper masters, including Wilkinson's Ravenhead smelter. While their visits were open, care was taken to prevent the party from seeing more than they already knew, except at Ravenhead, since the Parys mine which supplied it was already negotiating for contracts with the French navy.

Geikie, 2 vols., 1907), visited Britain in the guise of a mineralogist with an interest in allied technical matters. He was attached to the French inspectorate concerned with converting French industries to coal fuel, and this naturally led him to visit Wedgwood's potteries and the Newcastle glassworks, both of which were coal-fuelled and in some respects superior to similar establishments in France which were wood-fuelled. As a foreigner he was presumably suspect, for at Prestonpans, seeking to visit a sulphuric acid works, he could do no more than describe the walls surrounding the plant, so high that not even the tall chimneys were visible, while other walls surrounded the port so that the ships delivering sulphur and taking the acid away could not be seen. At the Carron ironworks he was told that although he would be taken round, there were several processes he would not see. In his supposed role as an innocent visitor he felt unable to take notes and thus had to memorize everything until he could write his reports at night.

He had travelled in Russia and Sweden on naval business and had held various colonial administrative posts. Their visit was not entirely successful. They arrived in the short days of early winter, the daylight hours were further reduced by bad weather, and Forfait was ill for much of the time. They found the navy yards closed to them, but this was not a handicap as they were freely admitted to the yards building vessels for the Greenland and East India trades. The men in these yards, which also built for the navy in times of war, had technical knowledge and skills equal to those in the royal dockyards. The Frenchmen also found easy access to navy and contractors' gun parks. They paid considerable attention to the process of coppering and took back samples of the new cast-iron pulleys running on copper bearings. Forfait's report remained in manuscript; plans for a possibly more secret and important mission were abandoned when Forfait was appointed to the legislative assembly.

Lieven Bauwens (1769-1822), of a noble Belgian family who engaged in industry and commerce, was sent to England at the age of seventeen to spend three years at the tannery of Underhall and Fox. Three years later he built a large tannery in Ghent, and, after the annexation of Belgium by France, another in Paris. Bauwens had relations in England and also in Hamburg, where his brother had a banking house. He was therefore able to mask his espionage behind genuine mercantile activities, and before he was twenty-nine he had made over thirty journeys to England. In 1797 he and Francois de Pauw, who was a relation and business associate, went to London and there recruited Saul Harding, whom they sent to Manchester to buy textile machines. Bauwens also bought machines and a small Boulton and Watt steam engine, and recruited a machine maker, a turner, and a factory manager. The first consignment consisted of machines which had been dismantled and concealed in bales of colonial goods and put on a Danish ship, but they were noticed by customs officials, who impounded the ship and cargo and fined the master. Bauwens hastily left the country, but returned when a second shipment was successfully effected. He recruited more workmen, took delivery of more machines, and with de Pauw and Harding prepared to sail from Gravesend in November 1798. They were exposed, however, when Harding's wife noisily objected to being left behind with her children, magistrates were alerted, and cover stories had to be concocted. Some of the men were taken to Yarmouth and reached Hamburg. Others deserted and informed. Harding and his men were seized and were each sentenced to a fine of $500 and a year in prison. Besides the considerable loss from the seizure of his goods, a deposit of 250,000 francs lodged with an agent was also stolen. Bauwens was condemned by Lord Erskine in the House of Lords for his transfers of knowledge first of tanning and later of the cotton machinery -- he had smuggled out large mules and ancillary textile equipment, calico printing machinery, and fly-shuttle looms -- and for the suborning of workmen. He subsequently built large steam-powered textile works at Passy in 1798 and at Ghent in 1799, eventually employing some three thousand people. His high-quality products earned him major prizes at the French industrial exhibitions at the turn of the century, and some of his British workmen also earned prizes for their skills. He married Mary Kenyon, daughter of the head of the Manchester workshop which had sold him the first mules. Two sons were established as industrialists in Paris and London. The Frenchman Francois Antoine Jecker spent some time in the workshop of Jesse Ramsden (1735-1800), the noted scientific instrument maker, before returning to his father's instrument workshop in Paris and there building a replica of Ramsden's straight-line dividing engine.

Jorge Juan y Santacilla (1713-1773), was sent in 1748 with two colleagues on a secret mission to London with wide-ranging instructions to examine every aspect of shipbuilding and outfitting, to send home plans of each type of ship, and to note any new techniques and apparatus likely to be of value to the Spanish navy, and to acquire new books and scientific instruments relating to navigation. They were also to seek to persuade some of the master shipbuilders, skilled riggers, and sailmakers to emigrate to Spain. 
The ostensible purpose of the visit was to contact members of the Royal Society (Juan was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in November 1749) with a view to improving their mathematics, and they were to enter the dockyards in the guise of simple sightseers. Juan was given a cipher for communicating with Richard Wall, the Spanish minister in London. Juan had no difficulty in purchasing scientific and medical instruments. As well as on aspects of naval science, he reported on printing and other techniques. An Irishman, Patrick Lahey, explained that Irish sailcloth was judged the best, and he agreed to go to Spain with his wife, some workmen, and a loom on which this superior cloth was produced. Juan managed to send in addition three shipbuilders and a rigging master, with their workmen and families, to Spain. He too, however, was betrayed by the wife of a shipbuilder; word passed to the man's employer and to the duke of Bedford, and Juan was obliged to flee in disguise on a Spanish ship. Despite being stopped and searched several times while going downriver, they were not arrested and reached France safely, where Juan bought some more books before returning to Cadiz. Under the auspices of the Sociedade Real Maritima, Gaspar Jose Marquez and Joao Maria Pedroso were apprenticed to the scientific instrument maker Jesse Ramsden for a considerably larger fee than was usual. 
It is likely that other nationals, including diplomats and chaplains, were able to take home industrial and technical information of a secret nature. The Swiss for example had an interest in textiles, and the cook at the Austrian embassy was apparently a conduit for recruiting workmen to that country. The extent and value of such activities remains undiscovered, though current research on industrial espionage is bringing home its extent, the ingenuity of the individuals concerned, and the amount of official involvement in the practice.

In 1944 she returned to France, to the Creuse and Haute Loire, having trained privately as a wireless operator, working for the American Office of Strategic Services.

Conchobhar Mac an Bhaird (d. 1641) -- can be firmly linked to the poetic family. Probably a member of the Donegal family, he volunteered in 1624, with other Franciscans (and with the authority of Aodh Mac an Bhaird among others), to take part in a mission to the highlands of Scotland, where Catholics had had few, if any, Gaelic-speaking priests since the Reformation (in 1560). He came to Muckairn, Argyll, and the published English summary of his Latin report to Rome reads: 'Campbell of Calder was laird; Calder was a man of great importance, but a heretic; it was very difficult to gain access to him; knowing, however, that Calder held poets in high regard, Ward, having composed a poem in praise of Calder, disguised himself as an Irish poet; then, accompanied by a singer, carrying a harp, he presented himself before Calder ['mox cum uno cytharoeda, et cantore (ut moris erat) ingredior'], and was graciously received; Ward continued in the guise of a poet for three days, and then disclosed to Calder who he actually was;... later,... the latter became a catholic. (Giblin, 53-4)' Whatever may be meant by the word 'disguised', Mac an Bhaird clearly knew what was involved in being a professional 'file'. He was imprisoned at the Gatehouse in London between 1630 and 1632, and remained on the Scottish mission until it ended in 1637. He then returned to Ireland, where he died in 1641. 
The practice of composing syllabic praise poems for patrons did not end with English conquest, but hung on, in places, even into the 1690s. A good example is

Diarmaid mac Laoisigh Mhic an Bhaird (fl. 1675-1695), who left nine poems, six of them in praise of Mac Mathghamhna (MacMahon) leaders in co. Monaghan. A modern scholar calls him 'one of the last fully-trained classical poets practising his art in this country' (Hughes, 1987, 67). Little is known about his life, but he can safely be regarded as a late representative of the Oriel family, although some sources say that he belonged to co. Down. 
Diarmaid also took part in the last, almost laughably late, poetic 'iomarbhagh' or 'contention', of which the four extant component poems are in the 'Book of Clanranald' (in the National Museum of Scotland), probably written in the 1680s. The contention is about the heraldic right to the symbol of the Red Hand, which Diarmaid claims for the Mac Aonghusa family of co. Down; Eoghan O Donnghaile disputes this and claims it for the O Neill family, and the Scottish poet Niall Mac Muireadhaigh ('c'.1637-1726) writes a reply to each of the Irish poets, claiming the Red Hand for Clann Domhnaill (the MacDonalds). This 'iomarbhagh' echoes the much larger poetic contention in which, early in the seventeenth century, numerous Irish poets squabbled learnedly about the relative merits of the north and south of Ireland, just as the English conquest was in the process of destroying their old Gaelic world forever, following the battle of Kinsale. If that earlier 'iomarbhagh' exemplified the unreal ivory tower world of the learned poets, the Red Hand contention shows that nothing much had changed in the run-up to the battle of the Boyne.

Eoghan Mac an Bhaird (fl. 1420), Gofraidh's father. It may be to this Eoghan that a seventeenth-century poet of the family refers when he claims to belong to 'Sliocht Eoghain mhoir Mhic an Bhaird' (descendants of the great Eoghan Mac an Bhaird) (Mhag Craith, 1.120). Poets of the Donegal family are fairly well documented, both in the annals and in their poetic works, for the next two centuries. Another 'ollamh', Aodh, was killed in 1522. 
Conchobhar Ruadh died in 1541 as 'ollamh' to O Donnell, and he was apparently author of an extant poem of 1505 on the death of the O Donnell chief. His brother Cormac (died 1534) was also a poet. Conchobhar's son Cu Uladh and grandson Maol Muire (died 1597) were both learned poets, as were Cormac's sons Flann and Uilliam Og (died 1576). Uilliam Og was 'ollamh' to O Donnell, and had two sons who were poets,

Eoghan Ruadh Mac an Bhaird (b. c.1570, d. after 1625) and a second Uilliam Og, who was still composing in 1641. He seems also to have had a third son, Fearghal, whose son Somhairle flourished as a poet about 1649. An unbroken poetic line can thus be identified from Cormac in the early sixteenth century to his great-grandson, Somhairle, about 1649. 
Eoghan Ruadh may have been regarded as 'ollamh' to O Donnell about the turn of the seventeenth century, and his life and verse are both closely tied to the varying political fortunes of the O Donnell family. He accompanied his chief in the historic 'flight of the earls' in 1607, when Gaelic rule in Ulster was effectively ended. He was living in Flanders when O Donnell died in 1608, and he later went on to Rome; but his poems continue to show his central concern with the misfortunes and hopes of the O Donnells and Ireland. A volume of his work was edited in 1930 (O Raghallaigh). Walsh's verdict on it is that it is 'very indifferent' (Walsh, 204); none the less Eoghan Ruadh was one of the two most prolific and important poets of the Donegal family. In 1612 Eoghan Ruadh received a pension from Philip III of Spain, and he seems to have died in Rome some time after 1625. 
Quite possibly a son of Eoghan Ruadh (though there is no overwhelming evidence to that effect) was Aodh Buidhe Mac an Bhaird, Father Hugh Ward (1592-1635), who was born in co. Donegal, became a Franciscan, and went to the Irish College at Louvain in 1622 as professor of philosophy. 
The other most important Mac an Bhaird poet is

doc= 72771


Fearghal Og Mac an Bhaird (d. 1618x30), who lived about the same time as Eoghan Ruadh but belonged to a different kin within the Donegal family. His father, who died in 1550, is named in the annals as Fearghal, 'mac domhnaill ruaidh saoi fhirdhana, 7 oide sccol' (which has been translated as 'a learned poet, a master of schools'), and both Fearghal's sons were poets. One, Eoghan Ruadh, was hanged in 1572. Fearghal Og may have been born in the 1540s and in 1581 he was in Scotland, where he may even have had King James VI among his patrons, and where he reports his distress, clearly amounting to 'culture-shock' (O Machain, 56), at the effects of the Reformation there. He may also have been something of a rebel among Irish poets, for he seems to be the subject of a poem (O. Bergin, 'Irish Bardic Poetry', 1970, 118) by another professional chiding him for composing poetry while out riding his horse: true 'filidheacht' should be composed indoors, in the dark, and involve serious brainstorming. Fearghal also once threw a goblet of wine in the face of Mag Uidhir (the Maguire chief), and apologized poetically for it. Later in life he lived for a while on the continent, and there are a few unhappy poems from there. He is known to have visited Louvain after 1618 and then to have returned to Ireland, where he died before 1630, but beyond these facts little is known of his life. 
Fearghal Og left more of his work than any other Mac an Bhaird poet, about sixty poems, his patrons being aristocrats in all parts of the northern half of Ireland, but of course principally the O Donnell leadership; however, primacy as O Donnell poet about 1600 seems to have gone to Eoghan Ruadh (mac Uilliam Oig). One critic thought that Fearghal Og 'was a voluminous composer of simple, if not very distinguished verse' (E. Knott, 'An Introduction to Irish Syllabic Poetry of the Period 1200-1600', 1928, 82). Bergin's opinion is more enthusiastic: 'many of Fearghal Og's poems have a natural grace and charm beyond the miracles of technique admired and imitated in the schools' (O. Bergin, 'Irish Bardic Poetry', 1970, 118). It has been suggested that a specimen of Fearghal Og's handwriting is extant in the National Library of Scotland's manuscript Adv. 72.1.1, which he may have owned at one point. 
It is becoming clear that these conservative professional poets, like their masters, were quite willing to collaborate fully, when necessary, with the new English world being imposed by King James. The leading Donegal poets Eoghan Ruadh and Fearghal Og have been classed among the great 'innovators' of the 1600 period because of the willingness evidenced in their poetry to face up to the grim reality of life under the new masters (Caball, 4, 12). In 1603 Eoghan Ruadh was a member of an official 'inquisition' in Donegal, looking into the extent of the O Donnell lands. In 1922 Eleanor Knott wrote as follows of the introduction of new political themes to professional verse: 'Towards the end of the 16th century we find Eoghan Ruadh Mhac an Bhaird attempting to express a more intellectual outlook in verses which reflect a faint gleam of the humanizing influence which was beginning -- too late -- to rise over the schools. (Knott, 'Bardic Poems', 2.xxxiv)' Despite the central importance of the Donegal family, the Oriel branch of Clann an Bhaird is also worthy of note. In the sixteenth century Laoiseach Mac an Bhaird, probably a member of the Oriel family and still living in co. Monaghan in 1601, scolds a neighbour (in technically perfect 'deibhidhe' metre, of course) for following 'English ways' of dress and hairstyle (O. Bergin, 'Irish Bardic Poetry', 1970, 49); but he is perhaps also the author of two 'courtly' love poems that have survived. Gofraidh mac Briain Mhic an Bhaird, of the Oriel family, is an important figure in early seventeenth-century verse, with fifteen professional poems extant, to O Donnell leaders and other Ulster and Connaught figures, as well as religious verse. Gofraidh Og Mac an Bhaird (whose father Gofraidh was also a poet, perhaps the same Gofraidh mac Briain) left a poem lamenting an O Donnell chief who died in 1655. Later there is a Padraig Og Mac an Bhaird (whose 'floruit' date has been given as 'c'.1690, but whose family links are unknown) and his son, another Fearghal Og, producing poetry.

Daniel de Mendi Macmillan (1886-1965), the eldest son of Maurice Crawford Macmillan and his wife, Helen Artie (Nellie) Tarleton, 'nee' Belles. Daniel de Mendi Macmillan was born on 1 February 1886 at Middleton House, Wandle Road, Wandsworth, London. He was educated at Eton College (where he was Newcastle scholar) and Balliol College, Oxford (1904-8). He joined the army in 1914, and was invalided the following year; towards the end of the war, on 5 April 1918, he married Margaret (1889/90-1957), the daughter of Louis Matthews (they were to have no children). He returned to publishing soon after, and acted as chairman of the company from 1936 to 1965. His brother, (Maurice) Harold Macmillan, later earl of Stockton (1894-1986), entered the firm in 1920 as a director, and continued except for times when serving as a government minister; he was deputy chairman from 1936 to 1940, and from 1945 to 1951. He served as the British prime minister from 1957 to 1963, but after his term of office was concluded he succeeded his brother as chairman. William, a musician and director of Stainer and Bell, was a good classical scholar and a historian; Daniel, also a classical scholar, continued development of the Indian branch and the educational lists and supervised the continuity of the firm's publications. Mention must also be made of Thomas Mark Macmillan, who joined the firm in 1913 as secretary to the board and became a director in 1944. 
Despite the obvious difficulties and hardships posed in the years of the First World War, the Macmillan partners struggled to prevent any major disruption of the firm's publishing schedule. Many books dealt directly with the wartime situation. Some of these were Owen Wister's 'The Pentecost of Calamity' (1915), F. S. Oliver's 'Ordeal by Battle' (1915), Mabel Dearmer's 'Letters from a Field Hospital' (1915), Winston Churchill's 'The Fighting Line' (1916), and Edith Wharton's 'The Marne' (1918); and three volumes from Kipling, 'France at War', 'The New Army in Training', and 'Fringes of the Fleet', all in 1915. Others emphasized the 'business as usual' philosophy, in order to divert people's minds, with titles such as Henry Clay's 'Economics: an Introduction for the General Reader' (1916), Morley's 'Recollections' (1917), Edmund Gosse's 'Life of Charles Algernon Swinburne' (1917), and Saintsbury's 'History of the French Novel' (1917-19). The cousins also recognized that spiritual topics were important in wartime, hence William Temple's 'Studies in the Spirit and Truth of Christianity' (1914), J. R. Illingsworth's 'The Gospel Miracles' (1915), H. B. Swete's 'The Holy Catholic Church' (1915), and Hensley Henson's 'Christian Liberty' (1918). Important works of scholarship also found a place: P. M. Sykes's 'History of Persia' (1915), Thomas Watts Eden's and C. H. J. Lockyer's 'New System of Gynaecology', and Frazer's 'Folk-Lore in the Old Testament' (1918). Some room was found, even in wartime, for literary works: there were two collections of Hardy's poetry, 'Satires of Circumstance' (1914) and 'Moments of Vision and Miscellaneous Verse' (1917); and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt's 'Poetical Works' (1914). 
An infusion of new blood from William and Daniel de Mendi Macmillan brought change to the manuscript selection process. The venerable John Morley was replaced as senior reader in favour of Charles Whibley, a younger man of more modern tastes and outlook. An immediate consequence of this move was a marked increase in the recognition of Irish writers. James Stephens, an engaging writer of Irish fantasy, published his first novel, 'The Charwoman's Daughter' (1912), with the firm, and remained with it for four more: 'The Crock of Gold' (1912), 'The Demi-Gods' (1914), 'Songs from the Clay' (1915), and 'The Adventures of Seumas Beg' (1915). A. E. (George William Russell), a leader in the Irish literary renaissance, came at roughly the same time, and Macmillan published his collected verse over the next twenty years: 'Gods of War' (1915), 'Candle of Vision' (1918), 'Voices of the Stones' (1925), 'Vale and other Poems' (1931), 'The House of Titans and other Poems' (1934), and 'Selected Poems' (1935). In a reader's report for 1900 John Morley had said of William Butler Yeats: 'The work does not please the ear, nor kindle the imagination' (Morgan, 221). By 1916 Macmillan thinking was so changed that the firm published his 'Responsibilities' and 'Reveries over Childhood': in the same year company executives acquired, through failure of Yeats's publisher, A. H. Bullen, thirteen volumes published earlier, and Yeats remained a Macmillan author until his death in 1939. Yeats supervised revision of two volumes published posthumously, and delayed by the Second World War: 'The Poems of W. B. Yeats' (1949) and 'The Collected Plays of W. B. Yeats', a revision and expansion of the collection of 1934. 
By securing Yeats the third-generation Macmillans opened the floodgates of Irish literature over the next twenty-five years. Padraic Colum published 'The King of Ireland's Son' (1916) and during the next ten years fifteen more titles. Sean O'Casey brought two plays in 1925, 'Juno and the Paycock' and 'The Shadow of a Gunman', and henceforth Macmillan published all his plays. In addition, they published a collection of his articles on theatre, 'The Flying Wasp' (1937), six volumes of his autobiography between 1939 and 1963, and two editions of his collected plays (1939 and 1951). A veritable parade of Irish literati now published with Macmillan: Alice Stopford Green ('History of the Irish State to 1914', 1925); Eimar O'Duffy (his satire 'King Goshawk and the Birds', 1926); F. R. Higgins ('The Dark Bread', 1927, and 'Gap of Brightness', 1940). Esme Stuart Lennox Robinson, for nearly fifty years a playwright, manager, and director connected with Dublin's Abbey Theatre, published his collected plays in 1928. 'Collected Poems' (1930) by Katharine Tynan and George Shiels's 'Two Irish Plays' (1930), remained on the list for the next fifteen years; Frank O'Connor (Michael O'Donovan) published many collections of his short stories, including 'Guests of the Nation' (1931); John Eglinton (pseudonym for William Kirkpatrick Magee) offered 'Irish Literary Portraits' (1935) and 'Memoir of A. E.' (1937); Paul Vincent Carroll published his important play 'Shadow and Substance' (1938), and Joseph Hone's biography 'W. B. Yeats' was issued in 1942. 
At the close of the First World War, with third-generation Macmillans William and Daniel de Mendi firmly in control of the company and cousin Harold about to join it (1920), they set about consolidating their list over the next twenty years. A series of collected editions was planned: the thirty-seven volume 'Mellstock' edition of Thomas Hardy's works (1919-20); John Morley's collected work in fifteen volumes (1921); W. E. Henley in five (1921); and Henry James in thirty-five volumes (1922-33). (James had first come to Macmillan with a volume of essays, 'French Poets and Novelists', published in 1877. Although not a profitable author for the firm, it nevertheless published most of his subsequent books as well as the New York edition of his novels.) Aside from the Hardy set, these were not financially successful. Apparently the public, while strong book buyers, wanted eclectic choice rather than collections. 
Macmillan titles in history and science proved more popular. John Fortescue, the military historian, published his monumental thirteen-volume 'History of the British Army' (1899-1930), as well as 'The Correspondence of George III' (1927) which sold well, as did 'The Greville Memoirs' (1938), edited by Lytton Strachey and Roger Fulford. Lewis Namier, the distinguished historian, brought to the company 'The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III' (1929) and 'England in the Age of the American Revolution' (1930). J. L. Garvin's 'The Life of Joseph Chamberlain' appeared in 1932, and Emily Anderson edited 'The Letters of Mozart and his Family' (1938). 
During the 1920s and 1930s the younger Macmillans saw the need to revise and update the firm's very successful teaching tools, something which had become a strong part of the business. The 'Modern French' and the 'Modern German' texts appeared, along with the 'Modern Classic' series as an addition to the 'Elementary Classics'. E. J. S. Lay produced 'Teaching in Practice for Infant Schools: Projects and Pictures' (1934-7), which addressed contemporary concerns about the methodology of teaching. It was a predominant text in its field for the next thirty years, providing a complete teaching programme for infant schools as well as suggestions for primary and secondary syllabuses. 
Early in the period following the First World War the young Macmillans had begun to develop an especially strong list of economic and political titles. John Maynard Keynes, the noted economist, and Daniel de Mendi began at Eton what was to be a lifelong friendship, so it was natural that the firm should publish his 'Economic Consequences of Peace' (1919), written in strong opposition to the provisions of the Versailles peace conference, which he attended as a representative of the government, accompanied by Daniel. 'A Treatise of Probability' (1921) followed soon after, and later his two great works 'A Treatise on Money' (1930) and 'General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money' (1936); in 1940 he published 'How to Pay for the War'. Keynes served as Daniel's adviser on other economic works, including Alfred Marshall's 'Industry and Trade' (1919), Arthur C. Pigou's 'Economics of Welfare' (1920), and E. H. Carr's 'International Relations since the Peace Treaties' (1937) and 'The Twenty Years' Crisis, 1919-1939' (1939). He also edited the 'Economic Journal' for Macmillan from 1912 to 1945. Because of Keynes's reputation many other economists came to the firm, including G. D. H. Cole, George Peel, Norman Crump, Paul Einzig, Colin Clark, Sir Cecil Kisch, Lord Stamp, Lionel Robbins, and Joan Robinson. 
Fiction was one highly successful venture for Macmillan in the twenty years between the world wars. Hugh Walpole first came to the firm in 1918 and by the thirties had developed the 'Herries Chronicle', a four-novel sequence set in Cumberland: 'Rogue Herries' (1930); 'Judith Paris' (1931); 'The Fortress' (1932); and 'Vanessa' (1933). This was a strong commercial success, with 'Judith Paris' selling 20,000 copies in the first two weeks. Another popular novelist of the era was Mazo de la Roche, whose publications 'Jalna' (1927), transferred from Little, Brown, and 'Whiteoaks' (1929) combined to produce the 'Jalna/Whiteoaks' series of sixteen novels, similar in popularity to the 'Herries' volumes. In the late 1920s and early 1930s Macmillan also acquired novels from E. M. Delafield, Richard Crompton, Edward Shanks, John Collier, Edward Thompson, A. G. Macdonell, Charles Morgan, and Naomi Royde Smith. Vera Brittain came to the firm with 'Testament of Friendship' (1940). 
It remained, however, for one British man and one American woman to provide Macmillan with two runaway best-sellers in the space of a little over a decade. James Hilton's 'Lost Horizon' (1933), an evocative novel set in Shangri-La, a Tibetan lamasery where inhabitants never grow old, was a great success in both Britain and America, winning the Hawthornden prize in 1934. Hilton subsequently became a fiction reader for the firm. In 1936 Margaret Mitchell surprised everyone with her blockbuster 'Gone with the Wind'. The Macmillan partners misjudged its appeal to the public, initially printing only 3000 copies; soon they needed 30,000, and ultimately they printed in runs of 100,000. Clearly, the investment made by the third-generation Macmillan cousins in fiction was a shrewd move. 
In 1936 the Macmillan family and the Macmillan business suffered sad losses in the deaths of the three senior partners, George on 3 March, Maurice on 30 March, and Frederick on 1 June 1936. As in the past, the transfer of power had already been made and the family members were in place to ensure no outward confusion or interruption to the routine of business. Will retired, and Daniel de Mendi and Harold now assumed the major leadership roles, with Daniel as chairman and Harold as his deputy. 
The Sitwell family became Macmillan authors with Osbert's 'Penny Foolish' (1935), a volume of essays, and a volume of lectures by all three, Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell, 'Trio' (1938). Such well-known poets as Sturge Moore, Edward Shanks, and Edmund Blunden came to Macmillan in the 1930s and early 1940s, after having first published elsewhere. For Lawrence Binyon the firm published several volumes of poetry and then his 'Collected Poems' (1931). 
With the advent of the Second World War the Macmillan family faced a crucial decision: should they move the firm's stock and offices out of London to avoid damage from bombing, or should they sit tight and tough it out? Harold Macmillan was credited with making the decision to stay put, based on the security and deep basement of the company's building. Careful preparations were made for gas masks, drills were conducted, and the structure was fitted out in case of a long siege. It withstood whatever assault the Germans mounted and at the war's end had the proud record that no one had been injured at Macmillan, and business had been conducted as usual. 
At the conclusion of the war Macmillan, in common with other British publishers, faced a severe paper shortage; the question was whether to expend its short supplies on new works, or to attempt to restore the existing list to normality. The Macmillan family decided on the latter course, in keeping with their long-standing policy of treating authors fairly. Texts, for both school and university, had top priority. Classics in their field, such as 'The Golden Bough', were continued. Living authors, and the estates of deceased writers which relied on royalties for income, also had priority. Even the opportunity to publish such a potentially important and profitable work as Winston Churchill's war memoirs was sacrificed in light of this policy. 
As publishing conditions improved, four new series were inaugurated: the 'Casebook' series, providing critical commentary on general authors for undergraduates; the 'Companion' series, providing critical commentary for the general reader; and the 'Master' series, supplying textbooks directly to students. By far the biggest seller, however, was the 'Macmillan Crime Fiction' series, which published forty to fifty titles each year. 
In the decades following 1945 many important novelists, poets, critics, historians, and other scholars were added to the Macmillan list. The philosopher A. J. Ayer, Leon Edel, Rumer Godden, Rupert Hart-Davis, Frank O'Connor, A. L. Rowse, C. P. Snow and his wife, Pamela Hansford Johnson, Muriel Spark, Hugh Trevor-Roper, and J. W. Wheeler-Bennett were but a few of these new Macmillan authors. The year 1951 saw the sale of the New York branch of the firm, while St Martin's Press became the focus of Macmillan interests in the United States. 
Always strong in reference works, the modern Macmillan list included such major works as 'The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians' (1980); 'The New Palgrave: a Dictionary of Economics' (1987); and 'The Dictionary of Art' (1996). 'The Macmillan Encyclopedia' (annually since 1980) was praised by Harold Macmillan for containing 'ideas which we need to understand in order to appreciate the intellectual currents of our time'. Other reference works included 'The Macmillan Nautical Almanac' (annually since 1980); 'British Archives' (1982), a useful location list of British manuscript archives; the 'Macmillan Literary Companions' (from 1968); and 'The Macmillan Dictionary of Women's Biography' (1989), a pioneering work in its field. 
In the years following the retirement of Harold Macmillan from the premiership in 1963, his energies were redirected towards publishing. He took over as chairman from his brother Daniel in 1963, and the company embarked on a period of rapid expansion, with the opening of overseas offices, mainly in African and Asian countries, and the development of educational publishing on a much more ambitious scale than ever before. Daniel de Mendi Macmillan died of heart failure at his home, 3 Grosvenor Square, Westminster, London, on 6 December 1965. 
The Macmillan family's active participation in the company continued. Maurice Victor Macmillan (1921-1984), Harold's only son, an MP for many years and a minister in the Douglas-Home government, divided his time between publishing and politics, and was one of the founding fathers of Pan Books, the pioneer of quality paperback publishing in the post-war era. His eldest son, Alexander ('b'. 1943), abandoned a successful career in journalism to join the company. In 1986, upon the death of Harold Macmillan, by this time the first earl of Stockton, management of the publishing interests had largely passed to non-family directors. Following the disposal by the family trusts of the majority of the shares to Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck in 1995, Alexander Macmillan, now the second earl, had embraced a challenging career as a member of the European parliament. 
As one looks back over the one and a half centuries of the Macmillan family as publishers, one sees that each incarnation of the family brought its own individual qualities to ensure the firm's growth and success. Daniel Macmillan, although cut off in his prime, had the dream and the vision to foresee success in a publishing venture. He brought the traditionally Scottish traits of honesty, hard work, and fair dealing with authors. He was also shrewd in developing the Cambridge connection in the early days of the business. 
When the responsibility fell on Alexander Macmillan, he saw the need for steady growth and innovation. His contributions were enormous, when one considers that he moved the business to London, conceived the idea of publishing in series, and then inaugurated one important idea after another: the 'Golden Treasury'; the 'Globe'; the 'English Men of Letters'. He founded a magazine, 'Macmillan's', that prospered for almost fifty years, and another, 'Nature', which is still a respected publication today; he founded the American branch; he published significant scholarly journals; he launched a musical dictionary that remains a valued source in its revised edition. Perhaps most remarkable, with only the education a village school, plus wide reading, could provide, he moved on terms of equality and respect among the foremost men of his time; and he had an uncanny ability to sense what would prove popular with the general public. 
The second generation, in particular through the work of Sir Frederick Orridge Macmillan, provided continued growth and established Macmillan unquestionably as one of the world's leading publishing houses. But possibly, for long-term impact, the most important accomplishment was the establishment of the Macmillan presence overseas. That would result in the 1990s in the firm having offices, not only in the United States and Canada, but also in most of the world's capitals. 
The third generation moved the company from the Victorian era to the modern age. New, contemporary authors were added to the list, reflecting changes in the literary climate. Books on the science of economics became a major commitment. This generation had to survive the two world wars, while doing business as nearly normally as possible. Clearly, each generation of the Macmillan family has made its own significant contribution to the leadership, prosperity, and success of the company.

James Gillow (b. c.1732) was the second of six sons and one daughter of George [i] Gillow (died 'c'.1759), a yeoman farmer of Great Singleton, near Kirkham, Lancashire, and his wife, Alice. He was apprenticed on 8 September 1746 to his uncle, Robert [i] Gillow, and after completing his apprenticeship he continued to work for Gillows as a journeyman in Lancaster; however, by January 1759 he was working in London. He lodged in St Martin's Lane, in the same area as eminent cabinet-makers such as Thomas Chippendale, William Vile & Co., and John Cobb. James Gillow's employer is unknown, but letters from his cousin Richard [ii] Gillow show that he was used as an errand-boy for the Lancaster firm and procured materials unobtainable in Lancaster. He suffered from ill health and returned to Lancashire, where he had been offered 'light work' by his cousins during the summer of 1759. On his return to London, Richard [ii] requested that James send him furniture designs and published design books such as 'Chippendale's additional number' (GA, 344/164, 5-7-1760). He was last mentioned in Gillow correspondence in November 1765, when he was newly married. He was almost certainly the Roman Catholic cabinet-maker of that name who was living in Marlborough, Wiltshire, with his wife, Hannah, in August 1767. After the death of his brother Thomas, he may have returned to London to help his cousin Robert [ii] Gillow run the Oxford Street shop, since between 1781 and 1785 the firm was listed in some directories as Robert, Richard, and James Gillow (Beard and Gilbert, 341).

Thomas Gillow (c.1736-1779) was the third of the seven children of George [i] Gillow and his wife, Alice. By 1748 he was, like his brother James, also living with his uncle Robert [i] Gillow to whom he was apprenticed in November 1750. He worked as a journeyman for Robert [i] Gillow but by July 1760 he had moved to Liverpool. It may be no coincidence that by January 1766, shortly after his brother James moved from London to Marlborough, Thomas was working in the capital, and living in Marshall Street, Carnaby Market. Thomas played a similar role to his brother in supplying his cousins in Lancaster with materials. His neighbours were the celebrated cabinet-makers William Ince and John Mayhew, whose book 'The Universal System of Household Furniture' was published in parts from 1759 to 1761. In April 1769 Richard Gillow wrote to Thomas that he 'was glad to find by what you hinted that you intend beginning for yourself in London' (GA, 344/166, 16-4-1769). He went into partnership with William Taylor (died 1775), another Lancaster cabinet-maker, and they became the first London partners of the firm in Oxford Street known as Gillows and Taylor, and Richard and Robert Gillow entered into an agreement to supply them with cabinet wares, including billiard tables. In January 1771 Thomas married Ann Cannon, at St James, Westminster. Taylor died in the autumn of 1775, and Thomas's cousin Robert [ii] Gillow joined him to run the London shop in January 1776. Thomas Gillow, like his brother James, suffered from ill health; he made his will in April 1778, and it was proved in July 1779. He had no children and left his estate to his 'beloved wife Ann' (will).

Edward Gillow was the brother of Robert [i] Gillow. John [ii] Gillow was apprenticed to his cousins Richard [ii] and Robert [ii] Gillow in Lancaster from 19 March 1770 for seven years, and worked as a journeyman for the firm before becoming a cabinet-maker in Liverpool from about 1784 to 1794.

Robert [iv] Gillow (1771x4-1798) was the son of Robert [ii] Gillow and his first wife, Jane Shaw. His date of birth is unknown but it must have been between 1771 and before 1775 when his sister Jane was born. By January 1796 (a few months after his father's death) he had joined his cousins George [ii] Gillow and Richard [iii] Gillow as a London partner. However, Robert [iv] Gillow died unexpectedly at the English College, Lisbon, Portugal, on 10 March 1798, having outlived his father by less than three years. 
Gillow furniture originally graced a vast number of town and country houses owned by the artistocracy and gentry; some collections still remain in private ownership today, although most commissions have inevitably been dispersed over the centuries. The number of provenanced or marked Gillow examples to be seen in country houses open to the public today vary considerably from one or two, to over 150 pieces at Tatton Park, near Knutsford, Cheshire. Broughton Hall, near Skipton, Yorkshire, has probably the largest private collection, and Leighton Hall, near Carnforth, home of Richard [iii] Gillow, naturally has a good collection of furniture by the family firm. Many other houses and institutions in north-west England have mainly smaller but notable collections, or a few pieces by the firm including: Sizergh Castle, Cumbria; Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal; Levens Hall, near Kendal; Dalemain, near Penrith; Mirehouse, near Kendal; the Judge's Lodgings Museum; Lancaster Castle; Lancaster City Museums; Lancaster Town Hall, Lancaster; Browesholme, Lancashire; and Tabley House, Cheshire. Houses outside the north-west region with some Gillow furniture in their collections include: Ardgowan, Renfrewshire, Scotland (open to special interest groups by arrangement); Berrington Hall, Hertfordshire; Dyrham Park, Gloucestershire; Raby Castle, near Darlington; Normanby Hall, near Scunthorpe; Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire; Stonor Park, near High Wycombe; Belton House, Lincolnshire; and Erddig Park, near Wrexham, north Wales. Over the three generations that Gillows were involved in the cabinet-making trade, they changed from artisan craftsmen to entrepreneurial manufacturing upholsterers and cabinet-makers employing a large workforce with prestigious showrooms in London and Lancaster. The firm were enabled to develop, expand, and probably to help finance their furniture making ventures, by becoming, from the 1740s, West Indies and European import and export merchants. Indeed their furniture rarely accounted for more than a small proportion of their exports, because it took up too much space on board ship in proportion to the profits to be made out of it. Therefore their furniture was also used as storage space for more profitable small British manufactured goods such as jewellery, brass and iron wares, textiles, shoes, and felt hats; and other perishable provisions for the colonies were also exported by the firm. Imports varied according to the state of the British markets but sugar, cotton, rum, and fine wines as well as mahogany and other timber were often included. Gillows promoted their furniture at every opportunity, and constantly sought new markets both at home and abroad. The Gillow family's contribution to furniture history remains to be fully evaluated. However, Gillows's designs were aimed at the gentry and growing upper middle classes; they occupied the middle ground between fashionable whimsy and boring conservatism. The firm adapted the latest London designs to suit their customers' taste, as well as creating some ingenious designs of their own, which they were anxious not to let other cabinet-makers copy. Research has also indicated that Gillows were making some furniture styles years before similar designs were published in design books by, for example, A. Heppelwhite & Co. and Thomas Sheraton. In 1817 Gillows work was described as 'all the fashion in the houses of the first Nobility and Gentry in England' and 'Mr. Gillow at Lancaster' as 'the first Upholsterer in the Kingdom' (D. McInnis and R. A. Leath, pp. 137-74, ref. p. 142). The success of the Gillow family firm was mainly due to sound business management and the manufacture of good quality practical furniture made from the best wood, by competent workmen, at the cheapest prices. It was, in essence, as the firm wrote to a customer in 1797, made to stand 'the test' of time (GA, 344/173, 20-9-1797).

He was in Carlisle from 1810 to 1811, but otherwise shared the family home in London until 1826 when he exhibited for the last time. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1827 and called to the bar in 1832. In 1842 he married Lady Heslerigg, daughter of Lord Wodehouse and widow of Sir T. M. Heslerigg.

He was possibly the son of Patrick Bisset of Lessendrum who died in battle at Corrichie under the Catholic earl of Huntly in 1562. Probably an arts graduate of Aberdeen University, Bisset was received as a burgess in Edinburgh in 1549. On 22 September 1554 he is recorded as a merchant visiting Paris, where he bought books from the publisher Michel de Vascosan. In that same year he is found selling wine from Anjou in Edinburgh, where he furnished wine to the English ambassador in 1565. In 1557 he entered into obligations with Timotheo Cagnioli, an Italian banker in Edinburgh, along with Leslie of Balquhair and Menzies, provost of Aberdeen. In 1574 he occupied the house of Sebastien Davelourt, a Frenchman who had been a member of Queen Mary's household, and was witness to a deed at Gight in 1577, after which date he disappears from record.

Mary Ann Williams (b. c.1788) was a genre painter and illustrator as well as an engraver. She worked with her brothers on numerous commissions, while independently she engraved plates for several books, including Leigh Hunt's 'The Palfry' (1842) and S. C. Hall's 'Ireland' (1841). Most notably she produced woodcuts for Sir Henry Cole's (pseudonym Felix Summerly) guidebooks to Hampton Court (1841) and Westminster Abbey (1842), which, employing only female wood-engravers, did much to promote their cause. She signed her engravings 'M. A. WILLIAMS, sc', 'MARY ANN WILLIAMS SC'.

Emma Williams (bap. 1832) -- were all baptized at the Old Church, St Pancras, London, on 2 October 1832, when their mother's name was recorded as Emma (Amy). All practised wood-engraving at some time. Quite often they collaborated with their father, for instance, Joseph helped his father on the Revd Thomas Scott's 'Bible' (1833-4) and 'The Solace of Song' (1836), while both he and his sister assisted with S. C. Hall's 'Book of British Ballads' (1842). Both Joseph and Alfred produced woodcuts for the 'Illustrated London News'. Among Joseph's most prominent efforts for this periodical were his drawing and engraving of the Christmas illustration 'Bring in the Boar's Head, Queen's College, Oxford' ('ILN', 26 December 1846), and a double-page spread, 'Funeral of the Late Duke of Wellington' ('ILN', 11 December 1852), while one of Alfred's was an engraving after J. Murray's 'The Minton Testimonial Museum' ('ILN', 11 February 1860). For the same journal, Alfred seems also to have worked with his brother John as John and Alfred Williams (who between 1853 and 1858 signed their plates 'J. & A. W.' or 'J. & A. Williams'), producing numerous plates, including 'The Sultan's New Palace of Dolmabaghdsche' for the issue of 22 October 1853. They worked from 6 Palsgrave Place, Strand, while other addresses are known for Alfred alone: 5 Gloucester Place, Regent's Park (1855), and 50 Carey Street, London (1872-5). Joseph Lionel exhibited historical and genre paintings at the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists between 1834 and 1874; he died in London in 1877.

Walter John Bayes (1869-1956), born in north-west London on 31 May 1869, was the son of Alfred Walter Bayes (1832-1909), a painter and etcher, and his wife, Emily Ann, 'nee' Fielden ('fl'. 'c'.1840- 'c'.1910). His younger brother was the sculptor Gilbert Bayes, and his sister Jessie Bayes (1878-1970) was also a painter. Following his early education at a Quaker school in Saffron Walden, Essex, and University College School, London, he had been drawn into the Fitzroy Street circle in 1908 when the scale and competence of the decorative paintings he had submitted to the first exhibition of the non-jury Allied Artists' Association (AAA) caught Sickert's attention. Despite having had work accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy since his student days at Westminster School of Art (1900-02), Bayes had enjoyed little commercial success. His rhythmic sense of composition, his gift for synthesis and simplification, and his idiosyncratic humour won admiration from critics but scant attention from collectors. He was equally at home working on a huge scale -- for example, his commissioned war paintings (IWM) -- or a small -- such as his direct oil sketches of figures, often his wife, Kitty (he married Katherine Teller in 1904), and one or other of their two sons on the beach (public collections with good examples include the Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield, and the art galleries of Aberdeen, Bradford, and Bury). He earned his living as an art critic (at this period of 'The Athenaeum') and in later life as a distinguished teacher (he was headmaster of the Westminster School of Art, 1918-34, and of the Lancaster School of Arts and Crafts, 1944-9). He died at his home, 54 Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, on 21 January 1956. 
Just as Sickert introduced Bayes to Fitzroy Street because he liked his work, so recruitment to the Camden Town Group was unsystematic, guided more by personal preference than communal ideology. Wyndham Lewis, his style already touched by the angularity of cubism, was introduced by Gilman or Gore, both of whom he had known since his days at the Slade School of Fine Art. Henry Lamb, a neighbour in Fitzroy Street, and Augustus John, already an artist of wide prestige and repute, sometimes joined the circle at Fitzroy Street on Saturday afternoons. John's membership of the Camden Town Group was a gesture of endorsement rather than personal involvement in the collective effort. The two slight sketches of Wales he sent to the first exhibition were unlikely to divert attention from his lesser-known colleagues. Lamb, on the other hand, treated the Camden Town Group exhibitions as a useful means of widening the audience for his art. 
John's Welsh compatriot, James Dickson Innes (1887-1914), was another irregular visitor to the Saturday afternoon gatherings. Innes was born in Llanelli on 27 February 1887. He studied at the Slade School from 1906 to 1908 and had his work accepted for exhibition at the NEAC from 1907 onwards. He travelled extensively. From 1910 to 1912 he frequently returned, sometimes with John, to their native Wales, where both created intense and colourful small-scale landscapes (most public collections in the United Kingdom have paintings by Innes, the greatest number being in the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff). Many of Innes's paintings featured Mount Arenig, the personification of his unrequited love for Euphemia Lamb (the ubiquitous 'femme fatale' and wife of Henry Lamb). He is said to have buried her letters in a silver casket on its summit. His fragile connection with the Fitzroy Street and Camden Town groups was severed in 1912 when deteriorating health led him to seek the sun in southern Spain and in north Africa and the Canary Islands. He died in Kent of consumption on 22 August 1914. 
According to Bayes, it was Gore who proposed the precocious draughtsman

Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot (1886-1911). Lightfoot, born in Granby Street, Liverpool, on 19 July 1886, was the son of William Henry Lightfoot (1852/3-1898), an insurance agent, commercial traveller, and pawnbroker, and his wife, Maxwell Gordon Lindsay (1858/9-1946). After studying at Chester Art School (1901-2) and taking evening classes at Sandon Studios, Liverpool (1905-7), Lightfoot moved to London in 1907 to continue his studies, until December 1909, at the Slade School. During his time there he carried off many of the most coveted prizes. His refined technique, exquisite sense of tone, tender sentiment, and fastidious temperament would have set him apart from most contemporary cliques. The inspiration of the two tender figure paintings ('Mother and Child' and 'Boy with a Hoop, Frank', both priv. coll.) contributed by Lightfoot to the first exhibition of the Camden Town Group in June 1911 was removed from the twentieth century: 'Frank' harked back through Whistler to Velazquez; the tondo 'Mother and Child' had its roots in fifteenth-century Florence. Both paintings stood out as totally different from anything else in the show. Lightfoot regretted joining the Camden Town Group and resigned immediately after the exhibition. On 27 September 1911, aged twenty-five, he cut his throat and died at his home, 13 Fitzroy Road, Primrose Hill. 
The art of Lewis, Bayes, Lightfoot, Lamb, John, and Innes was barely touched by association with the Camden Town and Fitzroy Street groups. However, communion with the inner core of Camden Town painters was the mainspring of the artistic development of two other new recruits, Drummond and Ratcliffe.

John Doman Turner (1871/2-1938), who worked in pencil, charcoal, chalk, and watercolour, but not in oils. Born in Lambeth, London, the son of Edmund Turner, a builder, and his wife, Sarah Ann, Turner married Frances Elizabeth, the daughter of George Birch, a carpenter, in Norwich on 25 November 1893, when his address was recorded as 61 Kings Road, Peckham. He lived most of his adult life -- certainly from 1900 onwards -- in Streatham, where he earned his living as a stockbroker's clerk. He was deaf. These facts, together with his unusual training as an artist through a sequence of some thirty letters from Gore offering constructive criticism on the drawings Turner sent to him over the period 1908-13, suggest he was an amateur. So he was in the literal sense, but the quality of his work and his dedication were professional (Southampton City Art Gallery and the University of Hull own drawings by Turner). His extant drawings of Ilfracombe, Tenby, Walberswick, Eastbourne, and Folkestone probably reflect holidays in these seaside towns. In London he studied contemporary life, including theatre and music-hall interiors and fairground scenes on Mitcham Common. After the death of Gore in March 1914, Turner rarely exhibited his work. He died from pneumonia at his home, 63 Downton Avenue, Streatham, on 3 January 1938. 
Once a finite membership of sixteen was achieved, Sickert persuaded Arthur Clifton of the Carfax Gallery in Bury Street, St James's, to lend his basement premises in June 1911 for their first exhibition. Each of the members was entitled to show four works, to be hung together rather than mixed on the walls. In fact at the first exhibition only fifty-five instead of sixty-four pictures were shown; Innes did not exhibit, while Lamb with three and Lewis and John with two pictures each did not take their full quota. Sickert's four contributions included two related figure subjects given the Camden Town murder title -- probably for publicity reasons. Lewis contributed two angular pen-and-ink drawings of a man's head which excited much derision. Otherwise, there was little to offend the critics: fresh urban and rural landscapes, Camden Town figures in interiors, two cab-yard scenes by Bevan, two music-halls by Gore. John's presence was reassuring, and every critic could recognize the qualities of design and draughtsmanship and the technical fluency of Lightfoot and Lamb. 
The second exhibition of the group was held at the Carfax Gallery in December 1911, when fifty-three pictures were shown. Duncan Grant, elected to replace Lightfoot, contributed one picture; John did not exhibit; Bayes and Lewis with three pictures each and Lamb with two explain the shortfall. At a meeting attended by all members except Grant, Innes, and John, the idea of expanding the group was first debated but finally voted down. However, a motion that new and larger premises be sought for their exhibitions was carried unanimously and effectively delayed active consideration of their next exhibition, which did not take place until December 1912. 
At the third and last Camden Town Group exhibition, held yet again at the Carfax Gallery because larger premises had not been found, thirteen of the sixteen members showed a total of forty-five pictures. Grant, John, and Innes abstained. Each, having closer artistic and commercial allegiances to rival societies and galleries, had exhibited only once with the group. Their absence meant that the overall character of the paintings on view was more cohesive than in 1911. Only Bayes, Lamb, and Lewis remained to represent styles developed outside the influence of the original nucleus of Fitzroy Street painters. The year between shows had allowed time for the talents of less experienced exhibitors to mature, and this third exhibition included Drummond's 'St James's Park' (Southampton City Art Gallery) and Ratcliffe's 'Clarence Gardens' (Tate collection). Ginner also showed a painting of central London, 'Piccadilly Circus' (Tate collection), one of his earliest brilliantly coloured and tautly constructed cityscapes. Bevan showed his first London horse-sale paintings. Three artists exhibiting with the Camden Town Group -- Lewis, Lamb, and Gore -- were also invited by Roger Fry to contribute to his second post-impressionist exhibition at the Grafton Gallery, which opened in October 1912 and was extended in December, thus overlapping the Carfax Gallery offering. The coincidence of these two exhibitions tended to polarize their respective characters in the eyes of critics and public. The viability of the Camden Town Group was threatened when it was relegated to a neutral position between the radicalism of Fry's selection and the conservatism of the NEAC. 
During 1913, as in 1912, Arthur Clifton continued to sponsor the work of individual members of the Camden Town Group by offering them separate exhibitions at the Carfax Gallery. The gatherings chaired by Sickert at 19 Fitzroy Street remained a focus where members of the Camden Town Group were joined by visitors drawn from a wider compass. Some -- for instance, Jacob Epstein in April 1913 -- became members of the parent society. Radical art politics were in a state of constant flux during this year as rival factions formed, overlapped, and re-formed. In the autumn, when the Fitzroy Street Group reassembled after a summer recess to face decisions about expansion of the Camden Town Group, it was resolved that a new society be formed by amalgamating the two groups. Thus was the more broadly based London Group born. 
The Camden Town Group has no clear death date: it petered out after less than three years' independent existence. Its last gesture as a corporate body was to respond to the invitation to select an exhibition of 'English Post-Impressionists, Cubists and Others' held at the Brighton Art Gallery from December 1913 until January 1914. 
The Camden Town Group brought together a group of painters each in his own way gifted with a desire to explore and to innovate within the boundaries of figurative art. At a time of unprecedented ferment in the arts, when all the traditional canons were being cast aside, Sickert and his colleagues negotiated a path between the ultimately sterile working of tired styles from the past and the wilder shores of experimentation to which technically and intellectually they were not willing to respond. The lasting achievement of the Fitzroy Street Group and its Camden Town satellite was not to shelter a belated flowering of English impressionism but to offer a milieu where iconoclasm was not demanded as a proof of modernity, where the patient effort to present objective records of urban life was not anachronistic, and where the craft of painting was respected. Over twenty years later, when the jazz and the machine ages had passed, the Euston Road School drew inspiration from its north-west London forebears. The legacy endures.

Charles Stokes Dudley (1780-1862), administrator and writer, was born on 18 September 1780 at Clonmel, co. Tipperary. He was educated at Ballitore School, co. Kildare, under Abraham Shackleton, and in 1798, aged seventeen, he was entrusted with the care of his four sisters and desperately ill mother, on their journey to Bristol. While there he found employment in a large commercial house and also met Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, and others to whom he was attracted by his literary tastes. When the rest of the family returned to Ireland in 1800 he went to London and then, or a little later, set up in business as a provision merchant. In 1802 he married Hester (1777-1803), daughter of Joseph Savory (1745-1821), a London goldsmith, and Anna, 'nee' Bellamy (1745?-1785). His wife's death in 1803, along with that of their child, prompted Charles Lamb's poem 'When maidens such as Hester die'.

Thomas Page (bap. 1680?, d. 1733), nautical publisher, referred to by Mount in his will as 'brother Page'. Both men came from Kent (where a Thomas Page was baptized in St Nicholas's Church, Rochester, on 12 December 1680, the son of Alexander and Mary Page), and there were connections between their families. Page was not among the half-dozen apprentices formally bound to Mount and when he was made free of the Stationers' Company in 1716 was described as Mount's servant. There is no evidence of the nature of Page's contribution to the partnership, and he does not appear to have had a share in the ownership of many of the firm's books, but his arrival marked the beginning of nearly a century of successful association between the families of the two men. After the death of John Thornton's son, Samuel, in 1715, the firm of Mount and Page acquired Thornton's 'English Pilot' plates and stock, which made them sole owners of all parts of the 'Pilot'. They also acquired the plates of Collins's 'Great Britain's Coasting Pilot' and published a new edition just after Mount's death. With these new acquisitions Richard Mount achieved a near monopoly of English nautical publishing for his firm. Mount regularly brought out new titles and the firm now controlled not only the best selling navigation books but also both the only important English maritime atlases. The firm had its own printing works and printed for several naval departments, including the Navy Office, parts of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, and the transport board, and for Trinity House, a link which was maintained into the twentieth century by Mount's successors. Outside the maritime world its customers included St Thomas's Hospital and the South Sea Company.

She attended St James's School, West Malvern, and finishing schools in Paris and Florence, and was presented at court. Rebelling against her father's conservatism, in 1936 she greeted the Jarrow marchers on their arrival in London. While holidaying in Spain the same year she met Uhlman. Her father strongly disapproved of their marriage. They helped the republican Spanish cause and she was joint secretary of the Artists' Refugee Committee, which helped artists from Germany and central Europe, including Oskar Kokoschka. From 1947 to 1957 she was secretary and administrator of the Artists' International Association, a Soho gallery which helped the careers of Edward Ardizzone and David Gentleman, among others.

Lorna Cecilia Wishart (1911-2000), was born on 11 January 1911 at Black Hall, King's Pyon, Herefordshire, the youngest child in the family of seven daughters and two sons of Walter Chancellor Garman (died 1923), a wealthy doctor. Released from boarding-school on the death of her father, she led a carefree teenage life, 'roaring about on the back of boys' motorbikes' ('The Independent'). Her two eldest sisters had by then already moved to London, Kathleen becoming the mistress and later wife of the sculptor Jacob Epstein, and Mary marrying the poet Roy Campbell. Lorna herself soon followed. She married Ernest Wishart at the age of sixteen, having been introduced by her elder brother Douglas. By the age of twenty-one she was the mother of their two sons, Michael ['see 'Wishart, (John) Michael Garman] and Luke. She first met the poet Laurence Edward Alan (Laurie) Lee (1914-1997) in 1937 while she was holidaying with her husband and sons at Gunwalloe, Cornwall. She lived with Lee from February 1938 to May 1939, and in March 1939 gave birth to his daughter, Yasmin. Though Lorna Wishart returned to her husband -- who agreed to bring up Yasmin as his own daughter -- the affair continued until 1943, when she transferred her affections to the young painter Lucian Freud (1922-2011), leaving Lee desolate. Freud painted her in 'Girl with daffodil' (1943) and 'Woman with a tulip' (1945). He, too, was left broken-hearted when she returned to her husband and embraced Roman Catholicism. Both Lee and Freud went on to marry her nieces. Described in her youth as a woman of exceptional beauty, Lorna Wishart was, in her daughter's words, 'savage, wild, romantic and completely without guilt' ('Daily Telegraph'). Following her conversion to Roman Catholicism she destroyed all her letters from Lee and Freud, devoted herself to supporting her husband, and led a blameless, though eccentric, life at their house at Binsted in the Sussex downs, where she created a notable garden. She died at Walberton Place Nursing Home, Walberton, West Sussex, on 12 January 2000, of bronchopneumonia and cerebral arteriosclerosis, survived by her son Luke and daughter Yasmin, her son Michael having predeceased her.

Elisabeth Ward Collins (1904-2000), painter and sculptor, was born on 31 October 1904 in Halifax, Yorkshire, the eldest child of Clifford Ramsden, editor and proprietor of the 'Halifax Courier and Guardian', and his wife, Nellie, 'nee' Ward, an amateur concert pianist from Charleston, West Virginia. Despite initial parental reluctance -- she later said that she had 'had a terrible row with my family -- they had expected me to stay at home and do the flowers!' (Collins, Hyman, and Lane) -- she trained at Leeds School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London. After her marriage to Collins she devoted much of her life to encouraging and supporting him, but she also continued to paint, initially exhibiting her gouache paintings under the name Belmont to keep her work independent of Collins's growing reputation. Radiant, friendly, spontaneous, and enthusiastic, Elisabeth Collins was tall, slender, latterly frail, and elegant in an old-fashioned quasi-Bohemian style with big hats and flowing dresses and scarves. Her art, influenced by Redon and Chagall, was magical, visionary, and charming, depicting a colourful dreamlike world described by one critic as from 'the Eastern European fairy-tale province of her imagination' ('Independent', 8 Feb 2000). After Collins's death she used his studio and produced a substantial number of small gouache paintings. Her exhibition at England & Co. in 1996 led to the Tate's acquiring four of her paintings. Although she told interviewers in 1999 that she would never describe herself as a Christian, latterly she was drawn to the rites of the Russian Orthodox church. She died on 17 January 2000 in London, and her funeral was at the Orthodox church in Knightsbridge, London.

Margaret Erskine (d. 1572), daughter of John Erskine, fifth Lord Erskine (died 1555), was more than a brief dalliance. She appears in a 'flyting' of Sir David Lindsay, in which the king is castigated for his loose morals, as 'the lady that luffit yow best' ('Works of Sir David Lindsay', 1.104), and was the model for Dame Sensualitie in Lindsay's 'Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'. In 1536 James appealed to the pope to have her marriage annulled so that he could wed her himself. Had he been successful, then James [ii] could conceivably have been legitimized by the subsequent marriage of his parents and Scottish history would have taken a very different turn. Margaret Erskine was said in later years to have borne ill will against Queen Mary for this reason, though her part in the imprisonment of the queen in her husband's castle of Lochleven in 1567/8 is a matter of dispute. She was a somewhat forbidding companion to the queen during that episode, but is said to have responded to the queen's famous charm.

Annie Carline (1862-1945) never knew her father, John Smith, or her mother. She was adopted by a relative and was employed as a housemaid when George Carline met her. She was a forceful personality, and her matriarchal role became more pronounced after his sudden death on 28 November 1920 in Assisi, during a prolonged family painting expedition to Italy. (His ashes were buried in Sunningwell, near Abingdon, on 14 December 1920.) Thus Annie Carline is the hub of the composition of Richard Carline's ambitious group portrait of family members and artist-friends, 'Gathering on the Terrace' (1925; Ferens Art Gallery, Kingston upon Hull), and the subject of some compelling individual portraits by her children, notably Hilda Carline's brooding 'Portrait of the Artist's Mother' (1930; priv. coll.). In 1927 she took up painting in watercolour herself and proved to have an innate talent. Her sharply observed landscapes and figure scenes delighted the artists who foregathered in the Carlines' home, and she was persuaded to exhibit them publicly, mainly with the London Group and the Artists' International Association. The cult of naive painting was at a height in the 1930s and in 1939, on the initiative of the cubist painter and theorist Andre Lhote, she held an exhibition at the Galerie Pittoresque in Paris. Until her death on 20 October 1945 she was still active as a painter. She was buried in Sunningwell cemetery. 
The Carlines were indefatigable, knowledgeable, and adventurous sightseers: annual painting holidays both in the English countryside and abroad were a fixed family tradition, which Richard and Nancy Carline kept up into the 1970s. Sometimes they were joined by painter-friends, as when Stanley Spencer accompanied them to Bosnia in 1922. In this manner bonds were reinforced, and so was the family commitment to painting and drawing on the spot. The family houses in Hampstead (first at 47 Downshire Hill, and from 1936 onwards at 17 Pond Street) reflected these practices: every available wall, kitchen included, was densely hung with paintings of all periods by all the members of the family and their friends, as well as with numerous artefacts from different cultures collected on their travels abroad. A 'museum' of curiosities was installed in the basement. In this stimulating (but never luxurious or chic) setting, the Carlines and their friends met to discuss art, religion, and politics, for discussion was another fixture of their daily lives. In the 1920s and 1930s the Carline family home in Hampstead became a noted meeting place for artists, writers, and intellectuals of independent and radical tendencies, to the extent that the Carlines themselves tend to be remembered for their relationships with more prominent artists, such as Stanley Spencer, William Roberts, and Charles Ginner, rather than for their own achievements. 
In 1898 George Carline had suffered severe financial losses through a disastrous speculation, and he at first tried to dissuade his son

He married Mary, daughter of Randal Moore and granddaughter of Charles, second Viscount Moore of Drogheda, in or before 1679. Sir John Ponsonby, a minor Cumberland gentleman, had followed Cromwell to Ireland in 1649 as colonel of a regiment of horse. William followed his father's military precedent. He distinguished himself greatly as commander of the protestant garrison during the siege of Londonderry in 1689-90. He inherited the Irish estates of the family from his brother Henry in the 1690s. He held a commission, as lieutenant-colonel in Lord Ikersin's regiment of horse, raised in Ireland in 1706. He left the regiment on 24 December 1710. The regiment was disbanded in 1713. He was a member of the Irish parliament for co. Kilkenny in 1692-3, 1695-9, and 1703-21. His wife died on 26 May 1713, a little before his political career bore fruit. He was called to the privy council in 1715, and was raised to the peerage of Ireland as Baron Bessborough in 1721, the patent citing his conduct during the siege of Londonderry. He was made Viscount Duncannon in 1723, and died on 17 November 1724; he was buried in Fiddown church, co. Kilkenny. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Brabazon.

Frank Berni (1903-2000), restaurateur, had also been born in Bardi, on 30 October 1903. Louis Berni was certainly settled in Wales, but in an interview he gave in 1990 Aldo Berni claimed that his grandfather John (in some versions a member of an old Parma family whose forebears had been circus owners) had emigrated from Bardi to Merthyr Tudful in 1862. He said the family 'had long been caterers and are direct descendants of several of the kingpins behind the once vast network of Italian cafes, still known as the 'bracchi', throughout the Welsh mining valleys' ('The Independent').

Maire O'Neill (1887-1952) was born Mary Agnes Allgood on 12 January 1887 in Dublin. The younger sister of Sara Allgood, she was known as Molly; she invented an Irish professional name in order to be distinct from Sally. In 1905 she joined the Irish National Theatre Society. A bewitching, rebellious, mischievous young woman, there was 'a fascination about her that commands attention' (Byrne, 91). She was engaged to John Millington Synge, whose obvious affection for her scandalized Miss Horniman, and met disapproval from her sister and from the other directors of the Abbey Theatre. An unequal partnership, with continuous quarrels, it stimulated some of Synge's best writing: ''Playboy' is radiant with the triumph of winning her, 'Deirdre' poignant with the anguish of losing her' (Coxhead, 194). Although Synge had already found elements of Pegeen Mike, Molly gave him the real impetus for the part that became her first major triumph when 'The Playboy of the Western World' opened on 26 January 1907. Synge was writing 'Deirdre' for Molly when he died in 1908; she collaborated with Yeats and Lady Gregory to finish the play. Critical responses to the production in 1910 suggest that it was too reverential, though Molly acted with pathos and beauty.

Hugh Albert O'Donnell, styled second earl of Tyrconnell (1606-1642), army officer in the Austrian service, was born in Kildare Castle about October 1606. The blood of the earls of Tyrconnell, Kildare, Nottingham, and Argyll ran in his veins, but O'Donnell was his proudest title. Left behind at Louvain when in 1608 his father departed for Rome, he succeeded as titular earl of Tyrconnell at his father's death. In 1611 his aunt Nuala came from Rome, but her efforts to persuade James I to restore Hugh to his estates were in vain. Archduke Albert of Austria was sponsor at his confirmation, and he added Albert to his name. At the archducal court from 1613, he enrolled at Louvain University in 1621 and in May 1625 was made knight of Alcantara. The following November he was commissioned captain of a cavalry company and he was on garrison duty in Sichem between 1627 and 1630. He fought during the costly campaign in which Frederick Henry of Orange won Bois-le-Duc, was at the entry into Bruges, and in 1632 helped to repel the Dutch there; alongside John O'Neill, conde de Tiron, he also sought to keep control of episcopal appointments by Rome in Ulster and Connaught, with limited success.

Thomas [i] Seddon (bap. 1761, d. 1804) was baptized on 21 June 1761 and bound apprentice in the Joiners' Company in 1775.

George [ii] Seddon (bap. 1763, d. 1815) was baptized on 16 October 1763, and bound apprentice in 1777; he trained as an upholsterer. As liveryman in 1757 and later master, their father was influential in the Joiners' Company. In 1785 George [i] Seddon took both sons into partnership, and from about 1790 or 1791 they were joined by the upholsterer Thomas Shackleton, who had married their sister Mary. Some of the furniture supplied by Seddon, Sons and Shackleton survives in private collections and gives a good indication of their finest late eighteenth-century creations. Among the pieces the partnership delivered to D. Tupper of Hauteville House, St Peter Port, Guernsey, described in M. Harris & Sons, 'Old English Furniture' (1935, 62-3), and for R. Clarke of Bridwell House, Dorset, some of which was sold at auction at Bearnes, Torquay, Devon, on 14 October 1992, was elegant satinwood furniture with painted decoration. 
It is not known how the Seddon house style was created, but it appears that the firm followed the latest fashions, even if their own creative talents were somewhat limited and conservative. George [i] Seddon subscribed to Thomas Chippendale's 'Director' (1754), Thomas [i] Seddon subscribed to Thomas Sheraton's 'Drawing Book' (1792) and, in 1826, Thomas [ii] Seddon and George [iii] Seddon ['see below'] signed a prefatory recommendation to 'Practical Cabinet Maker' by P. Nicholson and M. A. Nicholson. Much of Seddons late eighteenth-century production, in mahogany or satinwood, is of a type familiar from the publications of George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton. In common with other late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century cabinet-makers, Seddons were alive to the commercial prospects of patent and mechanical furniture. About 1780 Seddons invented a writing-table and filing cabinet for Sir Herbert Croft known as a Croft; in 1798 they produced a desk with a rising section of drawers and pigeon-holes controlled by a mechanism patented by Day Gunby; and, at the same period, a patent architect's table. 
When George [i] Seddon retired in 1798, the firm passed to his two sons, Thomas [i] Seddon and George [ii] Seddon, with financial provision being made for himself and his three daughters. After his wife, Lydia, had died on 27 March 1788, George [i] Seddon married Jane and he provided in his will for her, his sons, and his daughters. He died at Hampstead on 25 November 1801 and was buried there the following day in the old churchyard. The firm did not prosper, but none the less struggled on during the next two decades, despite a period of bankruptcy. In 1804, the year that Thomas [i] Seddon died, the brothers both served as officers in the volunteer army -- Thomas as a lieutenant-colonel and George as a captain of the London (Loyal) 11th regiment. On 26 May 1787 Thomas [i] Seddon had married Mary, daughter of John Pollard, who had earlier lent George [i] Seddon $10,000 to invest in his business. Thomas and Mary had at least eight children, including

Lady Mary Fenwick (c.1646/1650-1708)], eldest daughter of Charles Howard, first earl of Carlisle (d. 1685), and Anne Howard (died 1703), daughter of Edward, first Baron Howard of Escrick. Carlisle's non-royalist past, like that of Fenwick's father, encouraged the couple's reaction into extreme loyalism. Sir William embezzled and wasted Lady Mary's dowry of $5000; most of the family's financial troubles, publicly blamed on Sir John, were his father's fault. When alleged to be enjoying a lavish lifestyle in London, they were actually struggling on $200 a year. Nevertheless, according to Thomas Bruce, second earl of Ailesbury, 'neither he nor she taking any care of their affairs... they burned their candles at both ends' ('Memoirs of... Ailesbury', 1.389). Though Ailesbury, who would save his own life at Fenwick's expense, always denigrated him, Lady Mary herself admitted that he 'never saw his estate in many years but when he went to choose a Parliament man' (Hampson). They lived in the new West End, with a house in St James's Street from 1682 to 1693. Their three sons and daughter died young.

Margareta Burkill (1896-1984)]. They had a son and two daughters. A hint of the part that she was to play in his life is evident in the fact that from their marriage and at her insistence he was always known as Charles; hitherto he had been Charlie in the family, John outside it. In contrast to his completely English origins and upbringing, her background was comprehensively European. She was born on 1 December 1896, in Germany; her grandfather was an Austrian railway engineer, her father, Adolf Braun, a journalist in Germany, her mother a Russian, her mother's second husband an Englishman. Her schooling reflected this diversity: first in Germany and Russia, then at Harrogate Ladies' College and Newnham College, Cambridge (1917-20), where she read modern languages and economics. Her experiences at school in Nuremberg, where she was exposed to persecution because of her father's left-wing politics, bred in her a lasting sympathy with the underdog. This manifested itself both in her work for prisoners and refugees and later in the Burkills' joint efforts to improve the lot of those they saw as the underprivileged sections of Cambridge academic society, graduate students and visiting scholars. From 1933 onwards she helped to bring out of Germany and settle in England many hundreds of refugee children, and the Burkills themselves took into their family and assumed responsibility for the education of a German and an Austrian boy, who both went on to achieve positions in university departments of mathematics: (Gerd Edzard) Harry Reuter at Manchester, Durham, and Imperial College, London; Harry Burkill at Sheffield. Several other children became for a time in effect members of the Burkill family while being helped to build new lives.

Cuthbert Cunningham, second earl of Glencairn (c.1470-1540/41). When he was of age Cuthbert married, about 24 June 1492, Marion Douglas (died in or after 1511), daughter of Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus (c.1449-1513), and his first wife, Elizabeth. The marriage helped to secure his family's position and the earldom of Glencairn was revived in his favour on 15 August 1503, on the occasion of James's marriage to Margaret Tudor. Cuthbert aided the attempt of John Stewart, twelfth earl of Lennox, to liberate James V from the Douglases and was wounded fighting in this cause at Linlithgow on 4 September 1526, when Lennox was killed. For most of Glencairn's lifetime the Cunninghams were at feud with the Montgomerys, vying for jurisdictional control of the Cunningham bailiary. Cuthbert's son, William Cunningham, master and later third earl of Glencairn (d. 1548), burnt Eglinton Castle, the principal seat of the Montgomerys, in 1528, but the feud was eventually, if only temporarily, pacified in 1536. Cuthbert had died by May 1541. 
William Cunningham, the third earl, married before 1509 Katherine (died 1528x36), second daughter of William Borthwick, third Lord Borthwick. He was briefly treasurer in 1526 and after January 1536 he married Elizabeth, daughter of John Campbell of West Loudon. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Solway Moss in 1542. Ransomed shortly afterwards, he supported the English during the 'rough wooing' until defeated by James Hamilton, second earl of Arran, outside Glasgow in May 1544. His son Alexander Cunningham, fourth earl of Glencairn (d. 1574/5), was in matters of religion a prominent reformer and a supporter of the king's party during the Marian civil war. Although the Cunninghams broadly shared their chief's enthusiasm for protestant reform, they were less inclined to support his political activities. Only the laird of Cunninghamhead joined Glencairn in the so-called chaseabout raid of 1565, directed against Queen Mary's marriage to Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, while John Cunningham of Drumquhassill with other kinsmen held Dumbarton for the queen in 1568. Alexander was married first, about 1526, to Janet (Jane), daughter of James Hamilton, first earl of Arran, and then, after their divorce in 1545, to Jane (died in or after 1575), daughter of Sir John Cunningham of Caprington. 
Tensions between the Cunninghams and the Montgomerys resurfaced in 1571, when the fourth earl's son of his second marriage, Alexander Cunningham of Montgreenan, was appointed commendator of Kilwinning Abbey and contested the right of Hugh Montgomery, third earl of Eglinton, to act as bailie of the abbey's regality. However,

William Cunningham, fifth earl of Glencairn (b. c.1526, d. in or before 1580), who was probably of age by 1547, showed little interest in his half-brother's dispute. He first attended the privy council in 1569, having married Janet (died 1596), daughter of John Gordon of Lochinvar and his wife, Margaret, about 20 August 1547. He had died by 24 February 1580. In 1577 the Cunninghams were described as composed of 'men of fayre landes and of greate power of their owne surname' (Rodgers, 10) Their cadet branches included the lairds of Glengarnock, Cunninghamhead, Robertland, Aiket, Auchenharvie, Montgreenan, and Caprington, all in Ayrshire, although the earls of Glencairn also held lands in Renfrewshire, where their main seat at Finlaystone Castle lay near the River Clyde, and in Dumfriesshire and Dunbartonshire.
