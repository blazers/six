Townshend, Hayward (c.1577-1603x21), parliamentary diarist, was the eldest son of Sir Henry Townshend (1537?-1621), second justice of Chester and a member of the council in the marches of Wales, and his wife, Susan (died 1592), daughter of the prominent Londoner Sir Rowland Hayward. He was educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1595, and he studied at Lincoln's Inn, being called to the bar in 1601. When he was elected to parliament in 1597 he became one of the youngest men to sit in the Elizabethan Commons. Then and in the 1601 parliament Townshend sat as MP for Bishop's Castle, Shropshire. Criticism of the royal granting of monopolies was voiced in both these parliaments. In 1601 Townshend proposed that the Commons petition the queen for permission to proceed against monopolies by statute, a suggestion that earned him the praise of Sir Francis Bacon. Townshend was an active participant in this parliament, offering his own, ultimately unsuccessful, measures on solicitors and perjury. He spoke eloquently and, on his own report, decisively, in favour of the Painter-Stainers' Company, which was seeking protection against encroachment of their trade by the Plasterers in 1601. 
However, it is as a parliamentary diarist that Townshend has earned his reputation. He kept a relatively thin diary for 1597-8, but any previous parliamentary journal is incomparable both in length and substance to his for 1601. The young MP was impressed by the opening and closing ceremonies and was particularly moved to record procedural discussions and matters of privilege. He was also a keen observer of detail, as in 1597 when he noticed that the clerk of the crown received the subsidy bill and 'laid it on a little table standing before the Speaker betwixt ii great wax candles one a plaine greene carpet' (Hartley, 3.241). Townshend often described bills fully and he recorded debates on a wide range of matters. However, it is his joy in the workings of the institution and his fascination with the persons around him that contributes much to modern understanding of an Elizabethan House of Commons. In 1597-8 Townshend refers to those 'in the rebellioues corner in the right hand of the Howse' (ibid., 238) and to how MPs, having waited for thirty minutes to gain access to the closing ceremonies, rushed in with 'the greatest thrust and most disorder that ever I sawe' (ibid., 240-41). Through Townshend it is known that one MP was upset in 1601 because a gentleman usher told those MPs standing outside the door of the House of Lords, trying to hear the lord keeper's speech, that 'yf they ware not quyett they should be sett in the stockes' (ibid., 310); that the house considered ordering a page, who had harassed an MP, to be taken to a barber to have his excessively long hair cut before being discharged, and that one morning, while waiting for the speaker's arrival, older MPs discussed how, in earlier days, special scaffolding had been required to accommodate fashionable breeches. Townshend gives important insights into the processes of lobbying, recording that one town 'openlie in the Howse canvased for voices and procured councellors to speake in the behalfe' of their case in 1597-8 (ibid., 240), and he reported that lists of monopolies circulated while the house debated the matter in 1601. His diary reveals the eloquence and influence of men such as Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Robert Cecil, and Sir Walter Ralegh. 
Townshend was certainly dead by 2 April 1621, when his father drew up his own will, and it has been suggested that he died as early as 1603, on the grounds that such an active MP would hardly have failed to seek a seat for the 1604 parliament (HoP, 'Commons, 1558-1603', 517). He married Francasina (or Francelliana), illegitimate daughter of Edmund Neville, claimant to the earldom of Westmorland, and Franceline (or Francelliana), daughter of John Townshend of Dereham Abbey, Norfolk. Townshend's 'Historical collections, or, An exact account of the proceedings of the four last parliaments of Queen Elizabeth of famous memory' was published in 1680.

Townshend, Horatio, first Viscount Townshend (bap. 1630, d. 1687), politician, was baptized on 16 December 1630 at Stiffkey, Norfolk, the second son of Sir Roger Townshend, first baronet (1595-1637), of Raynham, Norfolk, and his wife, Lady Mary ('c'.1611-1669), daughter and coheir of Horace Vere, Baron Vere of Tilbury. His mother remarried on 21 June 1638, her new husband being Mildmay Fane, second earl of Westmorland. Townshend and his elder brother, Roger (1628-1648), matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, on 9 November 1644 and graduated MA on 27 November 1645. On 16 December 1646 they received leave from parliament to travel abroad for three years. After they had visited France, and with a visit to Rome planned, Roger died in Geneva some time before 13 July 1648. Townshend returned home as the third baronet and shortly after was married (articles, 22 October 1649) to Mary (1634-1673), daughter and sole heir of Edward Lewkenor, of Denham, Suffolk. They had no children. 
Townshend began to play a small role in local government, being nominated to parliamentary commissions in 1649 and serving as a JP from 1652. He sat in the protectorate parliaments of 1656 and 1659, but by the latter date he was working in favour of a restoration of the monarchy. Clarendon later recalled that he was 'a gentleman of the greatest interest and credit' in Norfolk, and was 'liable to no reproach or jealousy' because he had been too young to fight in the civil wars (Rosenheim, 19). He seems to have been ready to raise the county in 1659 if there was a successful royalist landing nearby. He was appointed to the council of state on 17 May 1659, but only after receiving royal permission to do so, and never actually took his seat. He played a vital role in ensuring that Lord Fairfax came out in support of General Monck, and on 28 January 1660 he delivered to the Rump an address from Norfolk in favour of a free parliament, which he subsequently presented in February to Monck. He was duly elected to the Convention Parliament for Norfolk in April 1660, and was one of the twelve representatives from the Commons sent to escort Charles II from Breda. 
Townshend did not stand at the general election of April 1661, probably because he knew that he would shortly be raised to the peerage (20 April) as Baron Townshend of Lynn Regis. Having been a militia colonel since October 1660, he was made lord lieutenant of Norfolk in August 1661. Other local offices soon followed, including the vice-admiralty of Norfolk, and the high stewardship of King's Lynn. Another reward for his services was the farm of the coal duties, which he was granted by the crown in 1664. In politics he seems not to have been close to the old Presbyterian leadership, and he was a supporter of the lord chancellor, the earl of Clarendon. He may have voted against the 'Corporation Act', but he then proceeded against conventicles if they seemed a threat to order. He was forecast by Lord Wharton in July 1663 as likely to oppose the motion to impeach Clarendon, and he promoted some measures, such as militia legislation, which the government favoured in the Lords. He was particularly active in the militia during the Second Anglo-Dutch War when invasion threatened the east coast of England. 
Townshend buried his first wife on 22 May 1673, and on 27 November 1673 he married Mary (1652/3-1685), daughter of Sir Joseph Ashe, first baronet, of Twickenham, Middlesex. They had three sons. The birth of a male heir in 1675 seems to have changed Townshend's outlook on life and he became concerned to leave his estate in good order, his early years having led to increased indebtedness as he wrestled with outgoings for jointures, portions for his sisters, and the completion of Raynham Hall. 
Townshend's position in Norfolk politics changed in the early 1670s when a series of by-elections caused divisions within the county. Townshend supported the candidature of Sir John Hobart, third baronet, in the Norfolk by-election of 1673, which angered the old cavaliers, and in 1675 he opposed the candidate of Lord Treasurer Danby in another by-election at King's Lynn and when the county also faced a contested by-election. At Westminster he was seen as an opponent in April-June 1675 of Danby's proposal for a non-resisting test act, and on 20 November 1675 he voted for an address to Charles II in favour of a dissolution. As a consequence of this opposition to Danby's ministry, he lost his lord lieutenancy on 25 February 1676. For the next few years Townshend was associated with the country party in opposition to Danby and the Court. In 1677 he left his proxy with the earl of Shaftesbury, and was even briefly a supporter of exclusion. 
However, Townshend was essentially a moderate figure, and the more extreme Norfolk whigs caused him to draw back towards the court. In January 1682 he disowned the whig county MPs he had helped to get elected. His reward was a step up in the peerage: on 2 December 1682 he was created Viscount Townshend. In August 1683 he signed the loyal address in the wake of the Rye House plot. His political stance in the late 1670s, however, meant that he was never in favour with James II. He spent his last years improving his estates and preparing for the likelihood that his son would succeed him as a minor. Townshend's second wife predeceased him, dying of smallpox on 17 December 1685. Townshend himself died in late November or early December 1687, after making a codicil to his will on 26 November. He was buried on 10 December 1687 at East Raynham, and was succeeded as second viscount by his eldest son, Charles Townshend.

Townsend, Horace (1750-1837), writer and Church of Ireland clergyman, was born in Ross Carbery, co. Cork on 5 November 1750, the fourth (and youngest surviving) of the seven sons of Philip Townshend (1700-1786) of Derry, Ross Carbery, co. Cork, army officer, and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Hungerford, of The Island, Co. Cork. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1765. He graduated BA in 1770 and MA in 1776. He was incorporated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 15 April 1776. Townsend was ordained deacon by the bishop of Cork on 21 September 1770, and priest on 29 September 1770. He immediately became curate of Abbeystrewry in the diocese of Ross. In 1780 he moved to become vicar of St Michael's, Cork, and curate of Carrigaline. In May 1785 he married Helena Meade (1760-1786), fourth daughter of Robert Meade, of Ballintober, co. Cork, rector of Dunderrow. They had one daughter. Following his first wife's death, in October 1787 Townsend married Katherine Corker (died 1811), daugher of Chambre Corker, of Lota, co. Cork, archdeacon of Ardagh. They had thirteen children, of whom three sons and eight daughters survived to adulthood. 
Townsend supported his family in part through the accumulation of livings. While he retained his posts at Cork and Carrigaline, he was rector of Dungavney from 1785 to 1786, vicar of Kilgariff and Desert from 1786 to 1829, and vicar of Kilkerranmore and Castleventry from 1786 to 1837. He was also employed as a tutor, and subsequently as an agent, by Richard Boyle second earl of Shannon, who installed him as sovereign of Clonakilty, co. Cork, and gave him the use of a house at Courtmacsherry in 1786. There he gained practical experience of agricultural improvement. In 1803 he gave up the living of St Michael's, Cork, on becoming rector of Carrigaline. 
Townsend is reported to have taken his clerical duties seriously, combining a sense of humour with a benevolence that won him the description 'Friend of the poor' (Townsend, 259). His speech from the pulpit in the Roman Catholic church at Clonakilty on 24 June 1798 was credited by his descendant Richard Baxter Townshend with having averted a rising in the district, but it has also been presented more accurately as an 'eloquent condemnation' of the rising following its defeat. Townsend urged the Catholic congregation to accept that they should have no role in the government of their country, and to 'Reflect with remorse on the sanguinary designs for which you forged so many abominable pikes' (Tuipear). 
Townsend was a writer of some local fame, not to say notoriety. He wrote much verse and occasional articles for 'Blackwood's Magazine' under the name Senex, and for 'Bolster's Cork Magazine' between 1828 and 1831. His most famous publication was 'A Statistical Survey of the County of Cork, with Observations on the Means for Improvement' (1810). The work was drawn up under the auspices of the Dublin Society. It was not a quantitative survey, but a prose description of the county. Townsend systematically described the geology, physical geography, inhabitants, antiquities, and the state of the church and agriculture in the first part of the book, following it with a topographical description barony by barony. Finally came addenda which were lists of miscellaneous items such as observations on bees and eggs. 
Townsend in his 'Survey' proved a systematic and industrious compiler and could show sympathy towards those whom he observed. He found the local people engaging in some respects and could describe them wittily, comparing for example Englishmen in an inn who would barely exchange one word over their drink with a similar gathering of Irishmen where 'the difficulty is to find a listener' (p. 75). He also wrote sympathetically about the alleged thievish tendencies of the Irish, ascribing these largely to poverty. He perceptively observed that underemployment stemmed from overpopulation in Irish rural districts, and identified the ease with which potatoes could provide for a family as the key to early marriage and further population growth in such districts. 
Townsend's survey did, however, show the conventional prejudices of his class and time. In comparing English and Irish peasantry, he proclaimed 'the superiority of the English in cleanliness, decorum, the order and decencies of life' (p. 74). He described the violent attacks among Irish peasants and attributed them to the persistence of their ancient tribal quarrels. What the 'Survey' became most immediately known for, however, was its comment, repeated in the second edition of the work, entitled 'A General and Statistical Survey of the County of Cork' (1815), on the state of the Roman Catholic clergy in the county. His remarks, particularly criticisms of the clergy's role in education, led to a bitter and protracted correspondence with the Dublin Society and in the Cork press. Townsend's anti-Catholicism became manifest also in his 'Observations on the Catholic Claims' (1812), in which he argued against Catholic emancipation chiefly on the grounds that Roman Catholics were claiming a right to freedom of conscience which they denied their own members. While such arguments dominated the immediate and local reception of his work, later readers have valued his detailed and often perceptive descriptions of the county, not least because his was one of the earliest such surveys in Ireland. In 1810 or after Townsend and his second brother, Thomas ('b'. 1737), bought the family property at Derry from his eldest brother, Richard (1733-1817), where he built a new house. His sight was impaired in later life following an accidental explosion. Townsend died on 26 March 1837 and was buried in St Fachtna's Church, Ross Carbery, where he is commemorated by a memorial in the form of a relief of the Good Samaritan by the noted sculptor Thomas Kirk.

Townshend, Sir John (1567/8-1603), landowner and local politician, was the elder son of Sir Roger Townshend (c.1544-1590), courtier, and his second wife, Jane ('c'.1547-1618), the eldest daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope of Shelford, Nottinghamshire. In childhood Sir Roger had inherited a house in Stoke Newington, Middlesex; property and land in Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Middlesex, and Essex; and twenty manors around Raynham, Norfolk, acquired by the family at the dissolution of the monasteries. As London agent, first of Thomas, fourth duke of Norfolk (executed in 1572), and then of his son Philip, earl of Arundel (imprisoned in 1585), Roger enjoyed Howard patronage, a determining factor in his son's life. 
John Townshend matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, aged thirteen, on 24 November 1581, then transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where his father and his uncle Michael Stanhope had been; in 1591 Townshend presented Cambridge University with a formidable staff for its senior proctor. Townshend, unexceptionally for a gentleman, never graduated, leaving university for foreign travel. He probably served with his father in July 1588 on the fleet sent against the Armada under Charles Howard, Lord Howard of Effingham, subsequently fighting under Sir Francis Vere in the Netherlands. He took residence at Raynham following his father's death in 1590. His widowed mother in 1598 married Henry Berkeley, seventh Lord Berkeley. Townshend had himself married, in December 1593, Anne (1573-1622) ['see 'Townshend, Anne], eldest of the three daughters of Nathaniel Bacon of Stiffkey, near Raynham, a man of wealth, puritan leanings, and considerable local influence, who was sheriff of Norfolk in 1599 and was knighted in 1604. 
Townshend was returned for Castle Rising, Norfolk, to the parliament that met on 19 February 1593. Thereafter he became increasingly active in local affairs, where power struggles tended to reflect court faction. As a Howard client, like his father, his father's friend Sir Edward Coke, and his father-in-law, Townshend opposed the royal favourite, the earl of Essex, supported in Norfolk by Sir Arthur Heveningham. In 1596 Townshend accompanied Lord Thomas Howard on the Cadiz venture, being knighted by him for valour. The following year, in opposition to Heveningham, Townshend was elected to parliament for Norfolk as knight of the shire, and in 1601, again rebuffing Essex partisans, he was returned for Orford, Suffolk, probably through the influence of Coke, the borough's recorder, and of his uncle Michael Stanhope. As his name does not appear in the journals of the House of Commons his parliamentary participation remains conjectural. 
Local struggles for power were bitter, bringing violence and instability to the county. About 1598 Townshend became a justice of the peace, but within two years he was dismissed from the bench for quarrelling with Heveningham's supporter Sir Christopher Heydon, a relation of his father's first wife. In 1597 Townshend's appointment to the Norfolk musters commission was successfully blocked by Heveningham, so he was unable to participate until December 1598, thereon frustrating Heveningham's ambitions to increase Norfolk's small number of very large foot companies to thirty-three small ones; about then his father-in-law obtained for him a captaincy of the foot company for the hundreds of Gallow and Brothercross. In 1600 Heydon challenged Townshend to a duel, averted by the privy council, Coke promising surety for Townshend's keeping the peace. Even so, seemingly Townshend was debarred by Heydon from the Norfolk musters commission until July 1601, when the privy council ordered his reinstatement. That same year Theophilus Finche was involved in a serious dispute with Townshend, Sir Robert Cecil acting as peacemaker. Townshend died, possibly at his home at Stoke Newington, on 2 August 1603 from a wound received the previous day in a duel fought on horseback on Hounslow Heath. His opponent, a relative on his father's side, Sir Matthew Browne, was killed on the spot. Browne, the member of parliament for Gatton, Surrey, was also a client of Lord Thomas Howard, which may suggest his quarrel with Townshend was personal. Townshend died intestate, letters of administration being granted the day following his death. His estate passed to Roger, his seven-year-old son, created a baronet in 1617; his younger son, Stanhope, died in London of wounds received duelling in the Netherlands; his daughter, Anne, married John Spelman. His widow, with the children, took residence at her father's house at Stiffkey, and died there in early November 1622, a few days before her father's death.

Townshend, John (1789-1845), army officer, was the eldest surviving son of Richard Boyle Townshend, high sheriff for co. Cork and MP in the Irish House of Commons, and his wife, Henrietta, daughter of John Newenham of Maryborough. He was born at Castletownshend on 11 June 1789, and on 24 January 1805 was appointed cornet in the 14th light dragoons. He became lieutenant on 8 March 1806, by purchase, and captain on 6 June, without purchase. On 16 December 1808 he sailed from Falmouth with his regiment for Portugal. He served in the Peninsular War, in Portugal and Spain, from 1809 to 1813, and was repeatedly in action, serving at the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo (December 1811 and January 1812) and Badajoz (March-April 1812), and the battles of Salamanca (22 July 1812) and Vitoria (21 June 1813). On 24 June 1813 he took part in the taking of the enemy's last gun near Pamplona, under the command of Major Brotherton of the same regiment, and was constantly engaged with the enemy until the battle of Orthez on 27 February 1814. On 8 March he was made prisoner of war in an encounter with the enemy near the city of Pau, but was quickly released. He was subsequently present at the battle of New Orleans (8 January 1815). 
Townshend was made: brevet major on 21 January 1819, as a reward for his services during the Peninsular War; major in the regiment, by purchase, on 13 September 1821; lieutenant-colonel, by purchase, on 16 April 1829; and aide-de-camp to the queen and colonel in the army on 23 November 1841. In 1827, on the death of his father, he succeeded to the family estates at Castletownshend. In 1831 he was one of the board of officers appointed by the general commanding in chief, under Lord Edward Somerset, for revising the formations and movements of cavalry. He served with his regiment in India for some years, but embarked at Bombay for England in November 1844. He landed in England in January 1845, and died unmarried at Castletownshend on 22 April 1845; he was buried there. A monument was erected to his memory in the church of Castletownshend by the officers of his regiment. He was succeeded in his estates by his brother, the Revd Maurice Fitzgerald Stephens-Townshend.

Townshend, Sir Roger (c.1430-1493), justice and law reporter, was the son of John Townshend (died 1466), a prosperous yeoman farmer of Raynham in Norfolk, and his wife, Agnes. He was probably born in the early 1430s, since he entered Lincoln's Inn in 1454. Within six years he was treasurer of the inn, and he probably gave his first reading around 1462; his second was in 1468 and his third in 1475. During the 1460s he built his practice at the bar, and in the year-books for 1467 we find him confidently disputing with Chief Justice Markham in the king's bench. He was acting as legal adviser to the Paston family by 1465, when he assisted them in the Fastolf will dispute and in a king's bench case reported in the year-books; at the same period he was assisting the duke of Norfolk. His services extended to moneylending, and an unredeemed Paston mortgage brought him the manor of East Beckham in 1470. Townshend served as a justice of the peace for Norfolk from 1466 until his death, and he was twice elected to parliament: first for Bramber in 1466, through the duke of Norfolk's influence, and then for Calne in 1472. By the 1470s he was sufficiently eminent in the law to act for the duke of Buckingham and the queen mother, and on 24 June 1478 he was created serjeant-at-law. Three years later he was appointed a king's serjeant, and he was reappointed to the office by Richard III. He began sitting as an assize judge in the last year of Edward IV's reign, going on the northern circuit until 1488, when he changed to the less arduous home circuit. His appointment as a justice of the common pleas came on 20 September 1485, and he sat in that court until the term in which he died, receiving his knighthood at Whitsun 1486. 
In 1467 or 1468, Townshend married Eleanor (died 1499), daughter of William Lunsford of Lunsford, Sussex. Their eldest son, Roger, grandsons Robert and Giles, and great-grandson Henry all made careers in the law and became benchers of Lincoln's Inn. By the time of his death, on 9 November 1493, he had spent around $3800 on land purchases, and was a major sheep farmer, owning 12,000 sheep in 1490 (in a famous judgment of 1487 he held a shepherd liable for negligence in losing a flock of sheep). His worldly success had carried the family into the gentry class; the hall, parlour, and chapel at Raynham were soon filled with armorial glass, and the visitation books garnished with bogus pedigrees. The justice expressed a wish to be buried in St Katherine's Chapel, Raynham, or in the Whitefriars if he died in London. Stow recorded an inscription in the Whitefriars to a Sir Thomas Townshend, which is probably an error for Roger. Roger's widow desired a tomb to be made for herself and her husband's bones at Raynham; the tomb chest survives, but even in the seventeenth century it bore no inscription. 
Townshend had some obscure connection with the organization of a library in Lincoln's Inn, and kept over forty books at his home, besides the law library which he must have had in London. His name is remembered by legal historians as that of the first known reporter of cases, discounting the considerably more obscure figure of John Bryt in 1410. The year-books '1-2 Edward IV' were printed by Pynson with the explicit 'secundum Townsend', and there are other references to reports under his name from the years 1458, 1460, and 1486. It is clear, therefore, that Townshend started keeping reports soon after joining Lincoln's Inn, and was still doing so as a justice nearly thirty years later. In view of this continuity, it seems highly likely that many of the other year-books during this period were written by him. Only a few personal jottings on circuit survive, in an autograph notebook at Raynham, and it is not clear whether the year-books which formed part of his estate, including a 'boke in papyr of dyverse yeres', were of his own making.

Townshend, Sir Roger (c.1544-1590), courtier, was the eldest son of Richard Townshend (died before 1551), landowner, of Brampton, Suffolk, and Katherine, daughter and coheir of Sir Humphrey Browne, justice of the common pleas. In 1551 he inherited more than twenty manors in the vicinity of Raynham, Norfolk, and other property from his great-grandfather Sir Roger Townshend that was worth $630 per annum in 1546, making him one of the wealthiest gentlemen in East Anglia. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1553 but did not graduate. A special commission declared him of age to enter into his estates in February 1565, and he received a licence to do so in May. He subsequently followed his grandfather into the service of the Howard family, becoming man of business to Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk. This service kept him predominantly in London, but he strengthened his ties to his county by marrying Ursula (died before 1564), daughter of Sir Christopher Heydon, one of Norfolk's leading gentlemen. Heydon was protestant and was not a Howard client. In 1563 Townshend was elected MP for Norfolk at a by-election. The duke used his influence effectively but bluntly by virtually ordering the sheriff to oversee the return of Howard clients. 
Following his wife's death without children, Townshend married Jane ('c'.1547-1618), daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope of Shelford, Nottinghamshire, and Anne, daughter of Nicholas Rawson of Aveley, Essex. They had two sons, Sir John Townshend (1567/8-1603) and Sir Robert Townshend ('b'. 1580). Townshend continued in the service of the Howards, taking charge of the affairs of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, after the execution of his father in 1572. Although Arundel complained about Townshend's zealousness in carrying out his duties, including prudently getting him away from a street brawl in 1582, and they had their differences at various times in the 1580s, the earl remembered his servant in his will with the generous gift of a large gilt bowl (though Townshend predeceased his master). He continued to court protestant families too. He leased the former Robsart estate in Norfolk from Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, from 1579 and owed him $500 at the latter's death in 1588. Between 1576 and 1584 Townshend appeared with his wife on the list of donors of new year's gifts to Elizabeth I -- they may both have held office at court. Following Arundel's imprisonment, Townshend appears to have spent a short period in custody himself. His settlement of his estate through the writing of a will in December 1587 may indicate the transfer of his service to Arundel's half-brother Lord Thomas Howard, a member of the council of war of his kinsman Charles Howard, Baron Howard of Effingham and later earl of Nottingham. He certainly played an active part in the defeat of the Armada, being knighted at sea by Effingham, now lord admiral, on 26 July 1588. 
Townshend died at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, a property he had purchased from Thomas Sutton, the founder of Charterhouse, London, on 30 June 1590 and was buried at St Giles Cripplegate. His extensive lands in Norfolk, along with property in Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Middlesex, and Essex left his widow and two sons well provided for. In 1597 she made an advantageous match with Henry Berkeley, seventh Baron Berkeley, whose first wife, Katherine, had been the sister of Townshend's first patron. Lord Thomas Howard was one of Jane Townshend's representatives in the financial settlement of this marriage, reinforcing the Howard connection.

Roger Townshend (1708-1760), an army officer and politician, was born on 15 June 1708. He joined the army as a cavalry officer and served as governor of Great Yarmouth garrison (1744-5) and as an aide-de-camp to George II at the battle of Dettingen (1743). He was by then MP for Great Yarmouth, having been elected in 1737. In 1747 he transferred to represent Lord Cornwallis's pocket borough of Eye. In the following year he left the Commons, having taken up the position of receiver of customs, which he held until his death, on 7 August 1760. He was unmarried.

Thomas Townshend (1701-1780), politician, was born on 2 June 1701. He entered Eton College in 1718 and King's College, Cambridge, in 1720, graduating MA in 1727, and served as MP for Winchelsea from 1722 to 1727 and for Cambridge University between 1727 and 1774. During the early part of his political career he regularly attended parliament and spoke often on behalf of his constituents. A man of great charm, he acted as his father's secretary before serving as under-secretary of state (1724-30), teller of the exchequer (1727-80), and secretary to the duke of Devonshire, lord lieutenant of Ireland (1739-45). On 2 May 1730 he married Albinia (died 1739), the daughter of John Selwyn, of Matson; the couple had three sons and two daughters before Albinia's death on 7 September 1739. Thomas died on 21 May 1780.

Townshend, Thomas, first Viscount Sydney (1733-1800), politician, was born in London on 24 February 1733, the eldest son of three sons and two daughters of Thomas Townshend (1701-1780), politician ['see under 'Townshend, Charles, second Viscount Townshend], and Albinia (1713/14-1739), daughter of Colonel John Selwyn. He was educated at Eton College (1748) and at Clare College, Cambridge (1750-53), from where he graduated MA in 1753. 
A member of the well-connected Townshend family, with familial links to the Selwyns, Walpoles, and Pelhams, Tommy Townshend was marked out for a political career. His grandfather had been secretary of state under Walpole, the duke of Newcastle was his great-uncle, and his cousin was the brilliant Charles Townshend. He became MP for Whitchurch, in Hampshire, on his father's interest in 1754. With both father and son initially attached to their influential kinsman Newcastle, Tommy was made a clerk to the household of the prince of Wales in 1756. Upon George III's accession in 1760 he was raised to the sinecure of clerk of the board of green cloth. He married, on 19 May 1760, Elizabeth (1736-1826), eldest daughter and coheir of Richard Powys of Hintlesham, Suffolk, and his wife, Mary Brudenell. They had six sons and six daughters. Elizabeth Townshend later served as lady of the bedchamber to Queen Charlotte. 
Newcastle resigned in opposition to the king's favourite, Bute, in May 1762, and in November the king dismissed Newcastle's ally the duke of Devonshire. Unlike most Pelhamite officeholders Townshend decided to stay in place. But as a 'young friend' of Newcastle, eager for systematic opposition, he was notable in speaking and voting against the ministry's peace preliminaries after the Seven Years' War. He was ousted in the 'Massacre of the Pelhamite Innocents' in December 1762. George III thought he could not 'be too soon dismissed, that will frighten others' ('Letters... to Lord Bute', 174). 
Townshend remained close to the Newcastle-Rockingham faction, though he was gravitating towards William Pitt. In December 1762 he acted as intermediary in discussions between the two parties. Rockingham brought him back into office as a lord of the Treasury on 12 July 1765. However, Townshend kept a foot in Pitt's camp and again, during the 'Stamp Act' crisis in January 1766, was commissioned to sound out the great man. When Pitt (now earl of Chatham) formed a ministry in July, with Rockingham replaced by the duke of Grafton at the Treasury, Townshend remained in place; indeed he informed Newcastle that he would not resign. On 23 December 1767 he was rewarded with a share of the potentially lucrative position of paymaster-general of the forces and was sworn of the privy council. By the general election of 1768 it seemed that he had completely drifted away from the Rockinghams; neither Newcastle nor Rockingham now counted him as a supporter. 
In 1768 this second phase of Townshend's courtly career came to a premature end. Grafton wanted him to make way for Richard Rigby at the pay office in order to gain support for his ministry from the duke of Bedford's group. But Townshend was not prepared to settle for the second-best of Rigby's vice-treasurership of Ireland (though it was of similar status and value), and, as Rigby reported, was 'obstinately bent to carry his folly so far as to go out of employment' ('Correspondence of John, Fourth Duke of Bedford', 3.401). On 10 June 1768 he left office and was to remain in opposition for the next fourteen years. 
Rockingham eagerly excused Townshend's earlier behaviour once he had come back into the opposition fold. He told Newcastle 'I have always had a partiality towards Tommy Townshend' and justified his flouncing out of government as a result of 'his never having been quite so satisfied in his own mind since he separated from us'. Townshend himself claimed his actions 'had not arose from any bickering about this or that office' but from a political decision to oppose the Bedfordites (BL, Add. MS 32990, fols. 206-7, 216-18). 
Townshend's attachments, however, were never clear-cut in this period and his loyalties were apparently flexible. He never fully re-entered the Rockingham orbit. His father controlled the two parliamentary seats at Whitchurch and his uncle George Selwyn nominated those at Ludgershall; upon their deaths, in 1780 and 1791 respectively, Townshend had control of all four seats. With his family and 'parliamentary interest', as well as his 'very independent fortune', he had the ability to act freely ('Memoirs of... Wraxall', 2.45). There are reports of him being variously 'a great admirer' of George Grenville, influenced by Lord George Germain (for whom he acted as second in his duel of December 1770; 'Correspondence of Edmund Burke', 3.407), and connected to the king's estranged brother, the duke of Gloucester (Horace Walpole regarded him as Gloucester's only 'sensible' friend; 'Last Journals', 1.165). His most consistent flirtation, though, was with Pitt; never an out-and-out Chathamite he rather hovered between him and the Rockinghams -- and always he hoped for conciliation between the two. 
In 1769 Townshend was talking optimistically to Edmund Burke about a 'union of the parties', specifically referring to a conversation with Chatham. Burke, now at the heart of Rockinghamite thinking, considered Townshend a 'very honest and safe man'; Rockingham countered that 'our friend' Townshend was 'naive' ('Correspondence of Edmund Burke', 3.88-90). Four years later, in January 1773, Burke wondered where Townshend's loyalties lay when he was missing on an important vote against the ministry's East Indian measures. He implied that Townshend might have been led astray by Chatham on this occasion, as he 'is disposed to a great deference to the opinions of those, who are at most but allies'. Burke reassured Rockingham, however, that it was their own party that 'he loves by far the best' ('Correspondence of Edmund Burke', 3.406-7). 
Once in opposition Townshend aimed to show what a nuisance he could be. He was notable in opposing the expulsion of Wilkes in 1769 and became one of the most prominent MPs in opposition to North's ministry; he was the opposition candidate for speaker in 1770. It has been calculated that he spoke 380 times during the 1768-74 parliament; only the Rockinghamite spokesmen Burke and Dowdeswell and the prime minister himself spoke more frequently. 
The growing crisis in America eclipsed all other issues in this period. Townshend's position was equivocal at first. With the Rockinghams and the Pittites he had opposed the passing of the 'Stamp Act' in 1765 and was in favour of its repeal the following year. However, he had not opposed Charles Townshend's duties on America in 1767, when he was a junior member of the Treasury; he later claimed that if there had been a division he would have done so. In February 1769 he sought to justify his cousin's duties: 'it was not the opinion of one man... It had pervaded the nation that it was absolutely necessary to do something... He desired taxes agreeable to the Americans themselves' (BL, Egerton MS 217, fols. 267-8). 
Townshend was later wrong-footed by events in America in 1774. Like many contemporaries he was horrified by the Boston Tea Party. He supported the ministry's 'Boston Port Bill', the 'Massachusetts Government Bill', and the 'Massachusetts Justice Bill', as he believed the Americans should be punished; he only started to question government measures for quelling the problems when no conciliatory measure was announced. He believed that the tea duty on America should be reviewed. With the introduction of the 'Quebec Bill', Townshend's hostility to the government was on firmer ground, for he found it easy to attack this as a threat to English liberty. After this point he was in line with opposition thinking on America, though he wavered between the Rockinghamite and Chathamite strains. With the Rockinghams he bemoaned the worsening news from America up to the outbreak of war in 1775, while the Chathamites rejoiced, seeing it as a positive opportunity. By 1778 he was with the Chathamites in opposing the acceptance of outright independence, whereas the Rockinghams now reluctantly admitted the reality of the situation. 
Townshend was one of the most vociferous opponents of North, who in the debate of 3 June 1774 on the 'Quebec Bill' reportedly 'rose in a terrible passion' (Cobbett, 'Parl. hist.', 17, 1774, 1390) and declared that he did not care what Townshend thought of him, for he was a 'passionate and prejudiced man' (BL, Egerton MS 261, fol. 406). 
Townshend was at the centre of opposition thinking and was consulted on matters of parliamentary tactics. What he hoped for most of all was reconciliation between Rockingham and Chatham. In November 1777, when the ministry was reeling from ill success in America, he 'never saw so fair... [a] prospect of union among those in opposition'. He expressed satisfaction that Chatham would not only be consulted but 'referred to for his absolute decision' ('Rutland MSS', 2.11). Walpole thought Townshend had always been 'chiefly connected' with Chatham ('Last Journals', 2.491). Townshend did weep openly in the Commons on the announcement of Chatham's death in 1778 and, with outright Chathamites and Rockinghams, was a pallbearer at Chatham's funeral. He appears, however, to have remained independent of the Chatham-Shelburne connection down to the end of North's ministry. 
Townshend tied his fortunes to the Rockinghams and their allies as long as North was in power. The aim was to bring down the government, and he, like them, waited on events in America. Failure in the war meant that by 1780 cracks had started to appear in the ministry. In the economical reform debates in March the opposition hoped for success, and there are reports of Townshend and Charles James Fox vying for who should take the pay office upon a ministerial change. Townshend's debating skills had put him in the running for significant office. By July 1780, with negotiations between the ministry and opposition, even the king accepted that men like Townshend would be a positive acquisition to his government. 
North's ministry was finally overturned in March 1782 and Rockingham returned to power. Townshend's uncle George Selwyn reported that his nephew had 'a situation fixed in his own mind, as adequate to his consequence' ('Carlisle MSS', 595). On 27 March he was made secretary at war, and Selwyn believed that 'this was what he hoped for' (ibid., 608). Yet Townshend's cherished whig unity was soon tested with the death of Rockingham just three months later. Shelburne succeeded him and consequently Fox and most of the Rockinghams left office. While others went out with Fox in 1782 Townshend never entertained the idea; echoing Chatham's perennial maxim of 'measures not men' he condemned Fox's 'quitting if measures are right because they cannot fill offices to their wish' ('Later Correspondence of George III', 6). Walpole considered that Townshend had 'addicted himself' to Shelburne ('Last Journals', 2.491). More likely, first with the smashing of North's solid ministry and then with Rockingham's death, Townshend felt that the situation was fluid again and that he himself was a free agent. Most of the cabinet having deserted, on 10 July 1782 he replaced Shelburne at the Home Office. Shelburne's ministry soldiered on despite constant opposition from the Rockingham whigs. Townshend played his part, strenuously defending in the Commons the peace with America. But in April 1783 he was ousted, with the Shelburne ministry, as the Fox-North coalition forced themselves into government. Shelburne's parting request to the king was to reward Townshend with a peerage for his parliamentary services to the ministry. He was created Baron Sydney on 6 March. 
Sydney's latest exclusion from office was of very short duration. By December 1783 the king had expelled the coalition and placed the young William Pitt at the head of his ministry. With a lack of senior politicians willing to serve with him Sydney was brought back as home secretary on 23 December. Apparently he had 'volunteered', though he 'very much disliked the employment' and hoped for a less taxing position in future (Fitzmaurice, 2.280-81). 
As early as 1784 Pitt considered replacing Sydney at the Home department. On agreeing to dissolve parliament in March 1784 he wanted to add something to the king's speech about parliamentary reform; Sydney and most of the cabinet notably overruled this. Sydney thought of parliamentary reform for Ireland as 'ruinous' and a 'crude and undigested... proposal' ('Rutland MSS', 3.78). It appears that he had the same view on reform in England, for when the opposition accused Pitt of being lukewarm on the proposal Sydney confessed 'I could, from my heart, forgive him that crime' (ibid., 81). In May, after success in the general election, Pitt asked Richmond to replace Sydney, who would have taken the privy seal, but Richmond declined. 
Now in late middle age, Sydney was fairly conservative. The king confided in this like-minded cabinet ally that he disapproved of Pitt's espousal of parliamentary reform in January 1785. George III had 'unalterable sentiments' about changing the constitution but wanted to deal diplomatically with Pitt's proposals ('Later Correspondence of George III', 3.119). In March he again sought the advice of Sydney, who confessed to 'lamenting extremely that the subject of a Parliamentary Reform should come into discussion' (ibid., 142) at this difficult time. Though the king had promised Pitt that he would not discuss his views on reform with anyone else Sydney was certainly party to his hostility. He gave only half-hearted support to penal reform and, with Lord Chancellor Thurlow, spoke in opposition to the abolition of the slave trade in June 1788. On this occasion Pitt threatened that if they would not support him on this then he could no longer work with them in cabinet. Anti-abolitionism was obviously strongly felt by Sydney, for he opposed measures to abolish the slave trade in the Lords until as late as July 1799. 
By 1789 Pitt felt that the time was right to rid himself of Sydney, who was more expendable for the king than was Thurlow and in June 'received from Mr Pitt your Majesty's gracious determinations regarding me' ('Later Correspondence of George III', 3.421). Sydney handed over the seals of office on 5 June and was created Viscount Sydney six days later. It was during his period as home secretary, however, that he created for himself his lasting memorial. He had concerned himself with the affairs of the new colony of New South Wales. In particular he had supported the establishment of a penal colony at Botany Bay; in 1788 the settlement was named Sydney in honour of him. 
Sydney's removal from office was sweetened with the sinecure of the chief justiceship in eyre, south of the Trent, which was worth $2500 a year; he was also made deputy lieutenant of Kent in 1793. The income from his various offices added to the considerable wealth that he had inherited on the death of his father in 1780, together with the family estate of Frognal, near Chislehurst, in Kent; he was further enriched when he succeeded to the landed estates of his uncle Selwyn on his death in 1791. He appears to have benefited also from the death of the tenth earl of Exeter, in December 1793, for Exeter's late wife had left $70,000 to her husband for his life, with a subsequent reversion to Townshend. 
Sydney died at his estate at Frognal on 30 June 1800, of a cerebral haemorrhage, and was buried on 3 July in Chislehurst church. His estate and title passed to his eldest son, John Thomas. For a man who held high office for six years Sydney is an overlooked figure. Even his obituaries were more concerned with the manner of his death than with his achievements in life. Most contemporary commentators seemed to consider him not hugely talented. Storer damned him with the faint praise that he had 'surpassed everybody's expectation in his political career' ('Carlisle MSS', 376). Wraxall too was convinced that 'his abilities, though respectable, scarcely rose above mediocrity' ('Memoirs of... Wraxall', 2.45). This view of his worth is echoed by modern historians, in particular Pitt's biographers. Rose was certainly over-generalizing, in relation to Sydney, when he stated that only Pitt and Thurlow in the 1784 ministry 'could make a tolerable speech' (Barnes, 74). Ehrman, while admitting that he was 'assiduous' and 'a fair debater', concluded that he was 'an average politician of the second rank' who was 'seldom impressive' (Ehrman, 2.184-5; 3.125). These judgements are a little harsh. The initial enthusiasm of the principled 'young friend' of Newcastle does seem to have waned first into vocal independence and then settled merely into a desire for office and honours. In this last respect Sydney was successful, and he certainly avoided the permanent, barren opposition of many of his contemporaries. 
What can be said is that Sydney was perhaps mistaken in accepting a peerage and thus losing much of the influence that came from being a Commons' man. He had been appointed by Rockingham -- and retained by Shelburne and Pitt -- for his debating skills, which were notable. His administrative skills, once in high office, were not so readily apparent. Wraxall pronounced: 'the reputation that he had acquired while seated on the opposition bench... he did not preserve or sustain after his elevation to the peerage... Tommy Townshend displayed very considerable talents. Lord Sydney, when removed to the Upper House of Parliament, seemed to have sunk into an ordinary man. ('Memoirs of... Wraxall', 4.5)'

William Townshend (1702-1738), also a politician, was born on 9 June 1702 and sat as MP for Great Yarmouth from 1723 until 1738. In addition in 1729 he was appointed groom of the bedchamber by Frederick, prince of Wales, with whom he enjoyed a close friendship. On 29 May 1725 William married Henrietta (died 1755), the daughter of Lord William Powlett; they had one son and two daughters. William also served as usher of the exchequer from 1730 until his death, several months before his father, on 29 January 1738. The second viscount's fourth son, the Hon.

Townson, Robert (bap. 1576, d. 1621), bishop of Salisbury, was born in Cambridge and baptized in St Botolph's Church there on 8 January 1576, as son of Renould or Renold Toulnesson. Admitted to Queens' College, Cambridge, as sizar on 28 December 1587, he graduated BA in 1592 and proceeded MA in 1595. He became a fellow of his college in September 1597 and took his BD in 1602. He preached at Paul's Cross on 28 November of that year. On 29 March 1604 he was instituted vicar of Wellingborough, Northamptonshire; on 17 June he married Margaret, daughter of John Davenant and widow of William Townley. Townson became vicar of Old, Northamptonshire, on 16 February 1607. In 1613 he proceeded DD. 
Townson's 'comely carriage, courteous nature' and fine preaching, later recalled by his nephew Thomas Fuller (Fuller, 'Church History', 3.294), evidently contributed to his preferment, by 1617, as a royal chaplain. Appointed dean of Westminster on 16 December of that year, he was strict in enforcing a dress code for the abbey congregation. He attended Sir Walter Ralegh before and at his execution on 28 October 1618, writing to Sir John Isham on 9 November that the event was already 'almost forgotten' (Hearne, 1.clxxxvi). Townson was expected to replace Harsnett at Chichester, but was elected bishop of Salisbury on 24 March 1620, being consecrated on 9 July. In his subsequent visitation, he was the first to adopt Bishop Overall's articles for Norwich (1619), which included recommendation of auricular confession as preparation for receiving communion. 
Townson died (from smallpox by one account, from late-night study by another) on 15 May 1621, and was buried next day by St Edmund's Chapel in Westminster Abbey. His brother-in-law John Davenant (bap. 1572, d. 1641) succeeded to the bishopric of Salisbury, allegedly providing for Townson's many children; of these, Robert became prebendary of Salisbury in 1632. Townson's widow died aged forty-nine on 29 October 1634 and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral.

Townson, Robert (1762-1827), natural historian and traveller, was born early in 1762 at Spring Grove, Marshgate, Richmond, Surrey, the youngest child of London merchant and insurer John Townson (1721-1773) and Sarah Shewell (1731-1805), daughter of James Shewell (1708-1786) and Sarah Smith (died 1748). The Shewells were partners in the brewery trade with Samuel Whitbread and the publishing business with Thomas Longman. Sarah Shewell was the wife of Charles Aldcroft (died 1774), a London haberdasher, with whom she had one child, James Aldcroft (1752-1796), who later took the name Townson. This was because John Townson and Sarah Shewell had carried on a concealed 'criminal conversation' since about 1753 which yielded three other children -- Mary (1754-1822), Ann (1756-1811), and John (1760-1835) -- in addition to Robert before they married in 1766. John Townson died in 1773 at Hackney. A neighbour there, John Witts (1750-1816), who married Robert's sister Ann in 1774, was inducted vicar of Cardington, Shropshire, in 1777, whereon the Townson family took up residence beneath the Lawley, in beautiful countryside which was greatly to influence Robert's later career. 
From about 1777 to 1783 Townson was apprenticed in Manchester but finding his interests were not mercantile, he set off to travel, largely on foot, through France and Italy to Sicily. In 1787, on his way home, he studied chemistry and assaying under Balthasar Georges Sage (1740-1824) at the Ecole des Mines in Paris. In 1788 he enrolled as a student of medicine and chemistry, and later of botany, at Edinburgh University. He planned a career in surgery, but Edinburgh soon showed him he should instead become a natural historian. In 1790 he was duly elected president of the student Edinburgh Natural History Society and in 1791 a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, proposed by James Hutton, the geologist. 
In 1791 Townson unsuccessfully applied to become government naturalist to the colony of Upper Canada. In 1792, after he had left Edinburgh without graduating, his paper 'Observations against the perceptivity of plants' was read to the Linnean Society in London. His travel plans having failed, he enrolled late in 1791 as a student of natural history at the University of Gottingen, going there by way of Uppsala and Copenhagen. While in Gottingen he took a year off to travel to Vienna and throughout Austrian Habsburg lands. He returned to Gottingen and published his first works, on reptilian physiology, in 1794 and 1795. He returned home in 1795 and was awarded the degree of LLD in 1796 by Edinburgh University. He settled again in Shropshire where his 'Travels in Hungary' (1797) was written. This contained pioneering botanical, entomological, and petrographic observations and spirited descriptions of his exploits, including those in the Tatra Mountains and in Slovakian caves. 
Townson then sought the patronage of the East India Company to undertake mineralogical surveys in India, convinced, by his experiences in Germany, of the need for proper encouragement of such science. But this too was unsuccessful, as was a similar 1797 application to the Sierra Leone Company, which it was thought might distract attention from agriculture there. So Townson stayed in Shropshire and wrote his significant 'Philosophy of Mineralogy' (1798), 'A Poor Man's Moralist' (1798; five editions up to 1804), and 'Tracts and Observations in Natural History' (1799). This last was the most important work. It completed the description of his pioneering experiments in reptilian physiology and gave a remarkable account of the geology of Shropshire. 
Disillusioned by his failures to obtain patronage, Townson started travelling again, in England and in Europe. Between 1802 and 1805 he spent much time compiling a 'History of Yorkshire', a planned major county history abandoned only through lack of subscribers. In May 1805 his mother died and he decided to follow his Royal Marines officer brother John to Australia. With all his natural history collections gathered in Shropshire, but his manuscripts burnt, he set off in December 1806. Despite promises by the British government of land, and assurances that he was the type of settler most needed, on his arrival he found the governor, William Bligh (1754-1817), of a completely different opinion. Promises made in London were not kept and Townson became one of the 'rum rebels' who helped depose Bligh in 1808. In 1811 he was at last granted land and settled at Varro Ville, near Sydney; but his scientific aspirations to explore Australia had been thwarted by Bligh and the primitive state of democracy in the colony. His attempts to investigate the novel natural history of his new country were equally frustrated. 
At Varro Ville Townson became a successful farmer and wine producer, using the scientific methods which had proved so uninteresting to his contemporaries. He was still trying to return to Britain in 1820 but, finding the disposal of his estates impossible, he remained, somewhat embittered, until his death there on 27 June 1827. He was buried in St John's churchyard, Parramatta, on 3 July. He left goods worth under $10,000.

Townson, Thomas (1715-1792), Church of England clergyman and religious writer, was born at Much Lees, Essex, where he was baptized on 17 April 1715. He was the eldest son of John Townson (died 1734), rector of Much Lees, and his wife, Lucretia (1683-1760), daughter of Edward Wiltshire, rector of Kirk Andrews upon Esk. He was educated first by Henry Nott, vicar of Terling in Essex, and then at Felsted School. He matriculated as a commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, on 13 March 1733. He was elected a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in July 1735, and a probationary fellow in 1737. During his time at Magdalen he wrote several hexameters. He graduated BA on 20 October 1736 and MA on 20 June 1739. He was ordained deacon on 20 December 1741 and priest on 19 September 1742; three days later he embarked on a tour of France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands in the company of William Francis Drake and Edward Holdsworth, and on his return in 1745 resumed tutorial work in Oxford. On 25 August 1746 he was instituted to the vicarage of Hatfield Peverel in Essex. He was junior dean of arts in 1748 and 1749, and in the latter year resigned the living of Hatfield. On 6 June 1749 he became senior proctor of the university, and on 29 August he was presented to the rectory of Blithfield in Staffordshire. On 15 June 1750, soon after the end of his term as proctor, he graduated BD, and served as bursar of Magdalen. 
Townson was said to be second only to Robert Lowth in scholarship at Oxford. Though he was reluctant to leave the university he did so on 9 December 1751, preparatory to his institution to the lower mediety of Malpas, Cheshire. He took up residence there on 2 January 1752, resigning his fellowship at about the same time, and lived there until his death. He turned down an exchange of livings in Whitechapel in 1756, and after spending some years dividing his time between his two parishes, he resigned Blithfield in February 1759, on receiving a bequest of $8000 from an old friend, William Barcroft, rector of Fairstead and vicar of Kelvedon, Essex. Townson then applied himself more especially to literary pursuits, publishing, in 1767, two works on Francis Blackburne's 'The Confessional'. In September 1768 he virtually repeated his European tour of 1742, returning in October 1769 to a joyful welcome from his parishioners. 
Townson subsequently published numerous articles in the 'Gentleman's Magazine'. In 1778 his 'Discourses on the Four Gospels' appeared, which Lowth called a 'capital performance' and which was translated into German (Allibone, 'Dict.', 3.2442). On 30 October 1781 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Richmond in Yorkshire, a position to which was attached a prebendal stall in Chester. In 1783 he was offered the regius professorship of divinity at Oxford, which he declined on account of his age, yet, at seventy-five, he was still capable of writing Latin poetry for his friend William Drake. In 1790, however, he began to suffer a painful disease of the lungs, which eventually killed him. He died, unmarried, at Malpas on 15 April 1792, with his friend and biographer archdeacon Ralph Churton present, and was buried near the north wall of the churchyard on 23 April. His younger brother John Townson, of Gray's Inn, erected a tablet to his memory in the chancel. 
In 1793 Townson's 'Discourse on Evangelical History' appeared, edited by the Revd Thomas Bagshaw; Ralph Churton published a memoir of Townson, together with his 'Works', in 1810. Bishop John Jebb edited Townson's 'Practical Discourses' (1830), which he says 'were admired and valued by the brightest ornaments of the last age' (Allibone, 'Dict.', 3.2442).

Towry, George Henry (1767-1809), naval officer, born on 4 March 1767, one of a family which for several generations had served in or been connected with the navy, was the son of George Philipps Towry, for many years a commissioner of victualling. His grandfather Henry John Philipps Towry (died 1762), a naval captain, was the nephew of Captain John Towry (died 1757), sometime commissioner of the navy at Port Mahon, and took the name of Towry on succeeding to his uncle's property in 1760. George Henry Towry was for some time at Eton College while his name was on the books of various ships. In June 1782 he joined the 'Alexander' as captain's servant with Lord Longford, and was present at the relief of Gibraltar under Lord Howe and the encounter with the allied fleet off Cape Spartel. He afterwards served in the 'Carnatic' with Captain Molloy, in the yacht 'Royal Charlotte' with Captain William Cornwallis, and in the 'Europa'. From October 1784 to March 1786 he was in the 'Hebe' with Captain Edward Thornbrough, in which ship Prince William Henry (later William IV) was a lieutenant, and from March 1786 to December 1787 was in the 'Pegasus', with Prince William as captain. On 6 February 1788 Towry passed his examination and on 23 October 1790 was promoted lieutenant. Early in 1793, at Lord Hood's request, he was appointed to the 'Victory', in which he went to the Mediterranean, where on 14 September 1793 he was made commander. On 18 June 1794 he was posted to the frigate 'Dido' (28 guns). 
On 24 June 1795, with the 'Lowestoft' (32 guns), on her way from Minorca to look into Toulon, the 'Dido' met two French frigates, the 'Minerve' (40 guns) and the 'Artemise' (36 guns), both of them larger, heavier, and more heavily armed than the British ships; the 'Minerve' alone was superior in broadside weight of shot to the 'Dido' and 'Lowestoft' together. Seeing this great apparent superiority, the French ships sailed towards the British, the 'Minerve' leading. The 'Dido' led the British ships and brought the 'Minerve' to close action. The 'Minerve', being twice the weight of the 'Dido', attempted to run her down, but the 'Dido', swerving at the critical moment, received the blow obliquely and caught the 'Minerve's' bowsprit in her mizen rigging. The heavy swell broke off the 'Minerve''s bowsprit and the 'Dido''s mizenmast, and the two ships lay by to clear away the wreck, when the 'Lowestoft', coming to the 'Dido''s support, completely dismasted the 'Minerve'. On this the 'Artemise', which had been firing distant broadsides at the British ships, fled. Towry, seeing that the 'Minerve' could not escape, signalled the 'Lowestoft' to chase, but recalled her an hour and a half later, seeing that pursuit was hopeless. When the 'Lowestoft' again closed with the 'Minerve', and the 'Dido', having repaired her damages, came up, the Frenchman surrendered. The British success was due largely to the misconduct of the 'Artemise''s captain, but the capture of such a ship as the 'Minerve' was a brilliant achievement and was praised by Nelson, who wrote to his wife: 'Thank God the superiority of the British navy remains, and I hope ever will: I feel quite delighted at the event' ('Dispatches and Letters', 2.48). 
The 'Minerve' was brought into the service and Towry was appointed to command her, but in April 1796 he was moved by Sir John Jervis (afterwards the earl of St Vincent) to the 'Diadem' (64 guns). During the year he was detached in the 'Diadem' under the orders of Commodore Nelson, who for part of the time hoisted his broad pennant on board her, notably at the evacuation of Corsica in October ('Dispatches and Letters', 2.300-02). Off Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797 the 'Diadem', still commanded by Towry, closed the line, but had no very prominent part in the battle. Towards the end of the year she was sent to England. In December 1798 Towry was appointed to command the frigate 'Uranie' (38 guns), in which, and afterwards in the 'Cambrian', he continued until the peace. In July 1803 he was appointed to the 'Tribune', which he commanded in the channel during the early months of the winter. Under the severity of the work his health gave way, and in January 1804 he was obliged to take sick leave. From May 1804 to June 1806 he commanded the yacht 'Royal Charlotte', and was afterwards one of the commissioners for the transport service. He married in 1802 a Miss or Mrs Chamberlayne (died 'c'.1806); of their children a son and a daughter survived. Towry died in his father's house in Somerset Place, London, on 9 April 1809, and was buried on 17 April at St Marylebone.

Towson, John Thomas (1804-1881), scientist and photographer, the son of John Gay Towson (1769-1857) and his wife, Elizabeth Thomas, was born at Fore Street, Devonport, on 8 April 1804, and educated at Stoke classical school. He initially followed his father's trade as a maker of chronometers and watches. When the daguerreotype process was introduced in 1839 he and Robert Hunt (1807-1887) devoted considerable attention to it; it was with the help of Towson's work, published in the 'Philosophical Magazine' (November 1839) and entitled 'On the proper focus for the daguerreotype', that the American John William Draper took the first sunlight picture of a human face in 1840. Towson was the first to devise the means of taking a photographic picture on glass and of using the reflecting camera; and, with Hunt, he produced highly sensitive photographic papers, for the sale of which they appointed agents in London and elsewhere. On 19 November 1840 he married at Stoke Demerel church, Devonport, Margaret, daughter of William Braddon, sailmaker, of Devonport. At this time Towson described himself as 'watchmaker'. 
About 1846 Towson turned his attention to navigation, in which he instructed young men in the naval yard. His investigations led to the suggestion that the quickest route across the Atlantic would be by sailing on the great circle. Sir John Herschel drew the attention of the Admiralty to Towson's discovery, and that department subsequently published Towson's 'Tables for Facilitating the Practice of Great Circle Sailing', and his 'Tables for the Reduction of ex-Meridian Altitudes' (1849). The works proved of particular value to the merchant marine. In 1850 he moved to Liverpool on being appointed scientific examiner of masters and mates there; he held the post until 1873, when he retired, still holding an appointment as chief examiner in compasses. In 1853 he brought before the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society the subject of the deviation of the compass on board iron ships, and in 1854 he helped William Scoresby (1789-1857) to draw the attention of the British Association to the matter. The result of the discussion was the formation of the Liverpool compass committee, whose three reports, subsequently presented to both houses of parliament, were largely produced by Towson. In recognition of his services to navigation he was on 9 January 1857 presented by the shipowners of Liverpool with a dock bond for $1000 and a gratuity of more than $100. In 1863 he was instructed by the Board of Trade to prepare a manual which was published as 'Practical Information on the Deviation of the Compass... [on] Iron Ships'. In 1870 he prepared a syllabus, adopted by the Board of Trade, for examinations in compass deviations. Towson died at his home, 47 Upper Parliament Street, Liverpool, on 3 January 1881, leaving a widow. 
Towson wrote prolifically on geography, photography, and history, but it was his works on navigation, which reached several editions and were translated into various languages, for which he is best remembered.

Toy, Humphrey (b. in or before 1537, d. 1577), bookseller, was the son of the London bookseller 
Robert's son Humphrey matriculated as a sizar from Queens' College, Cambridge, at Michaelmas 1551, but there is no record of his obtaining a degree. Robert died between 5 February 1556, the date of his will, and 12 February, when Elizabeth rewarded the Stationers' Company for 'commynge to the buryall of hyr husbonde' (Arber, 'Regs. Stationers', 1.35). At his death Robert had property interests throughout St Paul's Churchyard and the nearby Paternoster Row, and left his shop to Elizabeth, his executor, with a reversion to Humphrey upon her death. Other bequests included the Stationers' Company and the poor of the parish of Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, where Robert's brother Edward Toy (or Troy) had been vicar since 1551. Elizabeth carried on the bookselling business until at least 1558, most notably entering more than thirty ballad titles with John Walley in the company's register. 
On 11 March 1558 Humphrey, who then must have been at least twenty-one, was freed by patrimony into the Stationers' Company. He entered his first work in the company's registers in August 1560, and was admitted to the livery in summer 1561. He served as a renter warden of the company for successive years for 1561-2 and 1562-3, and was living at his shop at the sign of the Helmet in St Paul's Churchyard (probably opposite the great north door of the cathedral) from 1562 until 1574. In 1564 he brought an action in chancery against Robert Leche, chancellor of West Chester, over money owed for copies of the second book of 'Homilies'. Toy's stepmother died in 1565, leaving him most of her estate. Humphrey was evidently married by this time, as Elizabeth's will named Elizabeth and Joan as his children. He was married to Margaret or Margery (died after 1577), daughter of James Revell, surveyor of the works, but neither the date of marriage nor whether she was the mother of these children is known. Toy rose further in the Stationers' Company, serving as under-warden for two terms between 1571 and 1573. In the summer of 1575 he was involved, with three other members of the book trade, in a dispute with the queen's printer, Richard Jugge, over the right to print bibles. 
Only about thirty works bearing Toy's imprint survive, including an edition of Grafton's 'Chronicle'. Toy was a 'deare Friend' of the Welsh scholar William Salesbury, and in 1567 he published Salesbury's translations of the 'Bible' and the 'Book of Common Prayer' as well as his guide to Welsh pronunciation (Salesbury, sig. A2'r'). Toy's business also had an important international dimension. Between at least 1566 and 1569 he had links with the printer Christopher Plantin in Antwerp: during the first half of 1568, for example, he received thirty-five reams of books from Antwerp, while a surviving list of 159 books sent to him by Plantin, apparently just after Toy's death, showed that he was using Plantin as an agent to purchase protestant works from across Europe. 
Toy may have had Bristol connections as, following his death on 16 October 1577, he was buried in All Saints' Church in that city, where his widow set up a funeral monument. The administration of his estate was granted to Margaret on 26 November and his shop passed to his former apprentice, Thomas Chard. Toy is to be distinguished from a contemporary namesake in the Merchant Taylors' Company who was active in 1583.

Toy, John (1608x11-1663), Church of England clergyman and headmaster, was born in Worcester, the son of John Toy, mercer, of Worcester, sometime clerk of the parish of St Swithun in the city; he had married Fortune Burton, widow, in 1608. Toy was educated at the King's School, Worcester, as a non-foundationer. On 27 April 1627 he received an exhibition of 40's'. per annum from the dean and chapter to support three years' further study. He was admitted to Pembroke College, Oxford, the same year (when he was said to be sixteen) as a servitor or batteler. He matriculated on 23 May 1628, graduated BA on 27 January 1631, and proceeded MA on 2 July 1634. 
Toy subsequently became chaplain to the bishop of Hereford. In 1638 he published 'Worcester's Elegie and Eulogie', an account of the epidemic which killed 1500 people in the city between June 1637 and 1638. Toy ascribed the plague to God's anger at the citizens' failure to take heed of His (and Toy's) previous warnings, though he conceded that Worcester was no more wicked than the average cathedral city. At Michaelmas 1638 he became gospeller of the cathedral. In the following year of account he was listed as a minor canon. On 22 October 1641 he was instituted to the rectory of Stoke Prior, Worcestershire. A week later he received a lease of a house in the cathedral precinct for the term of his ministry there. He published a sermon given at the funeral in February 1642 of Alice, wife of the cathedral organist, Thomas Tomkins. 
At about this time Toy became master of the city school. He moved to the headmastership of the King's School, probably in the summer of 1644. Along with the rest of the collegiate body, he was deprived after the city's surrender to parliament in July 1646. He retired to his vicarage, but was sequestrated from that also in 1649. In the course of this year he sent to the press his 'Grammaticae Graecae Enchiridion in usum scholae collegialis Wigorniae', published the following year, which possibly helped to secure his appointment to the headmastership of Queen Mary's School, Walsall, in 1650. One of his pupils there, Dr Philip Fouke, later commended Toy's teaching as successful 'even among triumphing rebels' ('inter perduelles triumphantes') and without resort to lashings and scourgings ('flagris et verberibus'; inscription in British Library copy of Toy's 'Quisquillae poeticae', 1662; transcribed with translation in Macdonald, 135). 
Toy was restored to the headmastership of the King's School in September 1660 and he also regained his living. One of his pupils during his second term at Worcester may have been the future Lord Chancellor Somers. Toy died on 28 December 1663 and was buried two days later in the south transept of the cathedral. His widow, Martha, died on 10 April 1677, aged sixty-nine, and was buried at Stoke Prior.

Robert Toy (d. 1556) and his first wife (died in or before 1546); the couple also had a daughter, Rose, who married the London stationer Arthur Pepwell (died 1568/9). The 'Dictionary of National Biography' suggested that Robert was originally Welsh -- a speculation supported by the bequest by Robert's second wife to another Robert, 'the son of Humfrie Toye of Carmarthen', in 1565 and Humphrey's activities as a publisher of Welsh works (Plomer, 15). Robert was probably freed by the Stationers' Company before 1537 and was assessed at $20 in St Faith's parish, London, in 1541. He was publishing from premises in St Paul's Churchyard probably from 1542 onwards; from 1545 he was operating under the sign of the Bell. On 22 January 1546 he married Elizabeth Scampion (died 1565) of St Margaret's, Westminster. 'STC' associates him with the publication of more than forty titles, mostly religious and theological, including two works by Stephen Gardiner, one title by Foxe, and, in 1551, an edition of the Matthew 'Bible'. He also co-published Chaucer's works and two Skelton texts, 'Phyllyp Sparowe' and 'Why Come ye Nat to Courte'.

Toynbee, Arnold (1852-1883), social reformer and political economist, was born at 18 Savile Row, London, on 23 August 1852, the second son of Joseph Toynbee (1815-1866), an eminent aural surgeon, and his wife, Harriet Holmes. Toynbee owed much in his early years to the influence of his father, who, though he died when his son was only fourteen, had already inspired him with a love of literature and with the foundations of those social ideals which were afterwards the main interest of his life. Toynbee began his education at a preparatory school at Blackheath. 
At the age of thirteen or fourteen a fall from his pony resulted in a severe concussion and recurring headaches, which were to plague him especially when he was under strain. Hence, rather than go to Rugby School as planned, Toynbee went to the Revd J. M. Brackenbury's school in Wimbledon, and following his father's death in 1866, spent two unfruitful years in an army preparatory school reading for the military academy at Woolwich. Strained relations with his mother and the lack of a clear sense of purpose meant that he spent the next few years attending some classes at King's College, London, and reading on his own at home and in various lodgings. Finally he came into a small inheritance from his father, enabling him to go to Oxford in 1873. He had a sharp intellect and strongly independent character, which enabled him to acquire an amount of knowledge in certain fields of study, and to develop a strength and originality of opinion very unusual at so early an age. However, according to his friend F. C. Montague, Toynbee at this stage 'imagined himself to have gone deeper and further than was really the case' (Montague, 10). 
In January 1873 Toynbee matriculated as a commoner at Pembroke College, Oxford. In November of that year he competed for the Brackenbury (history) scholarship at Balliol. Though he was not successful, his work made a great impression on the examiners, and Benjamin Jowett of Balliol offered him rooms. Toynbee was keen to take up this offer, but the master of Pembroke raised objections. Following Jowett's advice, Toynbee left Pembroke and ceased to be a member of the university, though still residing at Oxford. In January 1875 he matriculated afresh, this time as a commoner at Balliol, though he had to abandon his plan to sit for Greats (the final examination in philosophy and ancient history) and instead read for an ordinary pass degree. As an undergraduate he was a considerable influence among his Balliol contemporaries. 
Toynbee came at first under the influence of Ruskin, who may have stimulated Toynbee's initial interest in political economy. He joined with enthusiasm the North Hinksey diggers' project, where Ruskin hoped to teach Oxford men the value of labour in the service of the community. But he soon became an ardent disciple of T. H. Green and adopted Green's gospel of civic duty, which led to Toynbee's joining some of his Balliol contemporaries in tutoring the teacher-trainees of the Oxford Wesleyan Boys' School. Toynbee resolved a crisis of faith through Green's broad-church views, whereby duty replaced dogma as the main expression of faith. This, in turn, resulted in Toynbee's involvement with the Church Reform Union's campaign to strengthen the national character of the established church and democratize its government, especially at the parish level. The desire to assist in raising the material and moral condition of the mass of the population grew more and more to be the absorbing passion of his life, and it was in order to direct his own and others' efforts in this direction that he threw himself with great energy into the study of economics, and especially of economic history. In spite of his poor health, which caused frequent and serious interruption to his studies, Toynbee obtained such a mastery of economics that immediately after taking his degree (1878) he was appointed a tutor at Balliol in charge of the candidates for the Indian Civil Service. In the following year he married (26 June 1879) Charlotte Maria (1841-1931), daughter of William Duncombe Atwood ['see 'Toynbee, Charlotte Maria], who was eleven years his senior. 
Toynbee's Oxford lectures, primarily intended for his pupils but soon attracting a wider circle of hearers, dealt with the principles of economics and contemporary economic history. His main interest was the history of the great changes which had come over the industrial system of Great Britain between the middle of the eighteenth century and his own time. Keen to apply the new liberal principles of Green, he took part in charity organization (he was a poor-law guardian from 1881), co-operation, and adult education. He gave public lectures on the industrial problems of the day, which were attended by large working-class audiences in Bradford, Newcastle, Bolton, Leicester, and London. 
The posthumously published volume of his works entitled 'The Industrial Revolution' (1884) reveals the nature of Toynbee's interests. The first part of it, 'The industrial revolution' proper, consists of the notes of his lectures delivered at Balliol on the industrial history of Great Britain from 1760, a subject on which he was collecting materials at the time of his death. Despite its fragmentary character and occasional inconsistencies, 'The Industrial Revolution' is full of valuable research and acute observation. In effect, Toynbee made in his lectures a strong case for the study of economic and social history as deserving specialization in addition to the traditional political and constitutional history. Toynbee has been widely credited with having established the term 'industrial revolution' as a proper historical concept. However, his intention was to extend the application of the whig argument contrasting the peaceful and gradual reformism of the 'English revolution' with the violence of the French Revolution. Toynbee had adopted the positivist view of progress as encompassing all spheres of human activity and tried to show how industrialization had carried with it progressive political change, thereby rejecting the need for revolutionary politics. The popular addresses, including 'Wages and natural law' and 'Industry and democracy', which compose the second half of the volume, are chiefly of interest as illustrations of Toynbee's character and aims as a social missionary. The eloquence, the religious fervour, the enthusiasm for the better organization of industrial society, and the genuine but not uncritical sympathy with working-class aspirations which were characteristic of him, are traceable even in the fragmentary remains of these lectures, which were largely extempore, and could in some instances only be pieced together after his death, from notes or from the reports of provincial newspapers. But the chief source of Toynbee's influence lay in the charm of his personality. His striking appearance, 'a face of almost Greek regularity of feature' (Milner, xiv), winning manners, and great power of expression aided by a melodious voice, above all his transparent sincerity and high-mindedness, won the respect and affection of all with whom he came into contact, whether as pupil, teacher, or fellow worker in social causes. 
Since his undergraduate days Toynbee had been a friend of Jowett, master of Balliol. He was also closely associated with T. H. Green and Richard Lewis Nettleship. Following a brief stay in the summer of 1875 in east London, he was also associated with Canon Barnett, vicar of St Jude's, Whitechapel, and became a founder of the first university settlement, Toynbee Hall, which was established soon after Toynbee's death and named after him. 
Toynbee belonged to the first generation of new Liberals who strove to preserve the political alliance between labour and Liberalism by means of producing a new mix of updated Liberal ideology. They combined the traditional values of free trade and self-help with Green's advocacy of greater intervention by the state in ensuring its citizens' welfare and with practical reform schemes which were to compete with radical socialism. Following Green's example, Toynbee entered municipal politics in 1882, when he stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate for Oxford's north ward, where Green had held a seat until his death. He was opposed to the extreme individualism of some of the earlier English economists, and he came to reject the validity and utility of classical economics. He believed strongly in the power of free corporate effort, such as that of co-operative and friendly societies and of trade unions, to raise the standard of life among the mass of the people, and in the duty of the state to assist such effort by free education, by the regulation of the conditions of labour, and by contributing to voluntary insurance funds intended to provide for the labourer in sickness and old age. 
In the last year of his life Toynbee was deeply interested in the agitation that was provoked by Henry George's book on 'Progress and Poverty' (1880) and his lectures in the British Isles. Convinced of the one-sidedness of that remarkable work, and alarmed by what he considered the bad and misleading influence which it was exercising upon the leaders of working-class opinion, he did his best to combat the doctrine of land nationalization by speech and writing. Two lectures which he delivered on the subject, first in Oxford and then at St Andrew's Hall, Newman Street, London, were his last efforts as a teacher on social questions. For some time he had been greatly overworked, and the physical and mental strain of delivering the lectures in London to hostile audiences were held to have contributed to the complete breakdown of his health. He contracted meningitis and died at 3 Thornton Hill, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 9 March 1883 and was buried in Wimbledon churchyard. At the time of his death Toynbee, who had been made bursar of Balliol in 1881, was just about to be appointed a fellow of that college. Following his untimely death he was widely hailed as a modern martyr who had given his life in the service of the masses. In retrospect he is best remembered for having established the academic usage of the term 'Industrial Revolution', and as one of the leaders of early new Liberalism.

Toynbee, Joseph (1815-1866), ear surgeon, was born at Heckington, Lincolnshire, on 30 December 1815, the second son of George Toynbee, a landowner and large tenant farmer. Educated at King's Lynn grammar school, at the age of seventeen he was apprenticed to William Wade of the Westminster General Dispensary in Gerrard Street, Soho, London. He studied anatomy under George Derby Dermott at the Great Windmill Street school of medicine, and gained a reputation for dissection. He subsequently studied at St George's and University College hospitals, and was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, in 1838. Study of the ear attracted him even during his student life. He was spurred on by the activity of the 'aurists', among whom was John Harrison Curtis, whose claim that one of the commonest causes of deafness was a deficiency of cerumen caused him to take issue in correspondence to 'The Lancet' in 1838 under the initials 'J. T.'. In the same year he gained an appointment at the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons under Richard Owen. Among his research activities, using the microscope, was a paper entitled 'On the non-vascularity of articular cartilage, the cornea, crystalline lens and vitreous humour, and of the epidermoid appendages', which secured him election to the Royal Society in 1842 at the age of twenty-six. He was appointed in 1843 as surgeon to the St George's and St James's Dispensary and later in the year was elected one of the first fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. 
Toynbee realized that the failure to study pathology was the main reason for the disrepute into which aural surgery had fallen, and that the only rational approach to the understanding and treatment of aural disease lay in dissection of temporal bones. Over a period of twenty years he amassed a collection of over 2000 specimens, many of which came as a result of appointments as aural surgeon to the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in the Old Kent Road, and to the Asylum for Idiots at Earlswood, Surrey, and others which were derived from patients he had examined. In 1857 he published 'A Descriptive Catalogue of Preparations Illustrative of the Diseases of the Ear in the Museum of Joseph Toynbee'. The collection attracted the young Adam Politzer (1835-1920) and was viewed by many, including Anton von Troltsch (1829-1890). On Toynbee's death the collection was given to the Hunterian Museum, but was destroyed in the Second World War. 
In 1853 Toynbee invented his artificial tympanic membrane, which consisted of a disc of gutta-percha to which was attached a fine silver wire; he published his results in a book entitled 'On the Use of Artificial Membrana tympani in Cases of Deafness'. There was some rivalry between Toynbee and James Yearsley over the various merits of their respective artificial eardrums. Toynbee's 'Diseases of the Ear: their Nature, Diagnosis and Treatment' (1860) was the most advanced and comprehensive textbook of its kind. It was dedicated to the governors of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, who in 1851 had had the foresight to appoint him as aural surgeon and to set aside the first beds in a general hospital for diseases of the ear. He resigned from this appointment in 1864. Toynbee noted that the Eustachian tube opened only in swallowing and yawning, and blew air up the tube with a catheter. He practised myringotomy and described osteomata, 'molluscous' tumour (cholesteatoma) and ankylosis of the stapes, which he incorrectly attributed to a 'rheumatic arthritis'. This was later shown by Politzer to be due to otosclerosis. He recognized intracranial spread of otogenic infection, but did not perform mastoidectomy. 
Initially living at 12 Argyll Place, St James's, Toynbee moved in 1850 to 18 Savile Row and there conducted a very successful practice. In 1854 he took a country house at Parkside, Wimbledon. Much of his life was devoted to philanthropic work. He started a Samaritan Fund to assist the sick poor of Wimbledon and later a Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Working Classes. In Wimbledon he endowed a village hall and a small museum and published 'Hints on the Formation of Local Museums' (1863) and 'Wimbledon Museum Notes'. A fountain erected to the memory of Joseph Toynbee by the Working Men's Club still stands. He married, on 4 August 1846, Harriet, daughter of Nathaniel Reynolds Holmes and niece of the antiquary John Holmes; together they had nine children. Their second son, Arnold Toynbee (1852-1883), shared his father's interest in social welfare and devoted his short life to it. Two years after Arnold Toynbee's death the first University Settlement was founded in Whitechapel by Canon Barnett, and was named Toynbee Hall. The third of the Toynbees' four sons was the Dante scholar Paget Jackson Toynbee (1855-1932); their daughter Grace Coleridge Frankland was a bacteriologist. 
Joseph Toynbee's life was described by his daughter Gertrude in her books 'Joseph Toynbee' (1909) and 'Reminiscences and Letters of Joseph and Arnold Toynbee' (1910) as outwardly quiet, uneventful, and hard-working. His inner life, though, showed intensity of love and sympathy, lofty idealism, undying trust, and aspiration. He had a fine bearing and gracious manners and to his children was father, mother, brother, friend, and teacher all in one. Toynbee was devoted to Gothic and Norman architecture and to literature, particularly that of William Wordsworth, John Ruskin, and Samuel Coleridge. He also collected watercolours, especially those of D. G. Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, James Holland, and Samuel Palmer -- most of whom were his friends. Botanical specimens prepared by him are still in the Kew Gardens collection. Toynbee's secret was not to encumber himself with petty worries but to be free to absorb new experiences and to seek the truth. 
Toynbee died at his home in Savile Row on 7 July 1866 as he had lived -- enquiring. Believing that tinnitus might be relieved by the inhalation of the vapours of hydrocyanic acid and chloroform, with a subsequent Valsalva insufflation, he fatally subjected himself to the test. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Wimbledon, and at the time of his death was president of the Quekett Microscopical Society and treasurer of the Medical Benevolent Fund. He was survived by his wife.

Tozer, Aaron (1788-1854), naval officer, entered the navy in June 1801 on the 'Phoebe', with Captain Thomas Baker, on the Irish station. He afterwards served in the East Indies and on the home station, and, again with Baker, in the 'Phoenix', in which on 10 August 1805 he was present at the capture of the French frigate 'Didon', which was carrying important dispatches from Villeneuve at Ferrol to Rochefort. Tozer was dangerously wounded in the shoulder, and, after passing his examination, was specially promoted lieutenant on 11 August 1807. After serving in the 'York' (74 guns) at the capture of Madeira and in the West Indies, he was appointed, in December 1808, to the 'Victorious', in which he took part in the Walcheren expedition in July and August 1809. The 'Victorious' was in the Mediterranean, in the defence of Sicily, from June to September 1810, during which time Tozer was repeatedly engaged in actions between the boats and the vessels of Murat's flotilla, and on 22 February 1812 was at the capture of the 'Rivoli'. In February 1813 Tozer was appointed to the 'Undaunted', and during the following months repeatedly commanded her boats in storming the enemy's batteries or cutting out trading and armed vessels from under their protection. On 18 August 1813, in an attack, in force, on the batteries of Cassis, when the citadel battery was carried by escalade and three gunboats and twenty-four merchant vessels were brought out, Tozer was severely wounded by a canister shot in the groin and by a musket shot in the left hand, in consequence of which he was invalided out. On 15 July 1814 he was promoted commander, and in December 1815 was awarded a pension of $150 a year. From 1818 to 1822 he commanded the 'Cyrene' (20 guns) in the West Indies and in 1829 the yacht 'William and Mary'. He married, on 5 June 1827, Mary, the eldest daughter of Henry Hutton of Lincoln; they had one son, the Revd Henry Fanshawe Tozer, fellow of Exeter College, Oxford. On 14 January 1830 Tozer was promoted to post rank, but had no further employment, and died at Plymouth, where he was living, on 21 February 1854. 
Tozer had an amphibious career, distinguished by bravery and exceptional in intensity, but not untypical of a period of unquestioned British supremacy at sea.

Tozer, Henry (c.1601-1650), Church of England clergyman, was born in North Tawton, Devon, to unknown parents. Having matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 3 May 1621, when he was said to have been aged twenty, he graduated BA on 18 June 1623, and that year became a fellow of the college. He proceeded MA on 28 April 1626 and was ordained. Two years later he published the very conventional 'Directions for a Godly Life: Especially for Communicating at the Lord's Table' (1628), dedicated to Viscount Falkland's son Lorenzo Cary, whose tutor he was, but by May 1630 he had been reported to the vice-chancellor as having discussed the differences disturbing the peace of the church. On 21 October 1632 he was appointed lecturer at St Martin's, Carfax, Oxford, where his sermons were especially frequented by those deemed puritans and he himself gained the reputation of a 'precise puritan'; according to Anthony Wood, Tozer also preached at St Giles, to the north of the city (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 3.273-4). Even so, his second publication, 'A Christian Amendment' (1633), originally a St Martin's sermon, was an equally uncontroversial exhortation to holiness, dedicated to his former student Sir Walter Pye the younger of Hereford. On 28 July 1636 Tozer proceeded BD. 
Like his college head, John Prideaux, whom he assisted as bursar and sub-rector, Tozer apparently remained a convinced Calvinist and he retained over the next decade his popularity among those keen for 'primitive religion'. However, qualities that could simultaneously gain him acceptance from the Laudian establishment are evident in his 'Christian Wisdome' (1639), based on a sermon delivered at the university church of St Mary's in November 1638. Dedicated to Robert Ker, earl of Ancrum, a courtier and apparently a patron of long standing, it located true wisdom -- the wisdom of Solomon -- in striving to be like God, not in spending time in such activities as 'the curious ordering of thy haire' ('Christian Wisdome', 7). It firmly rejected 'Romanists, monks and friars' (ibid., 86-7) who locked up, or steered men away from, wisdom, but condemned those who sought Solomons of their own in 'a Parlour, an Anabaptisticall Convention' (ibid., 100). If an incumbent were non-resident, or otherwise unsatisfactory, God would 'put in a better Solomon', but in the meantime it was preferable to stay put than to journey to seek a better, and better to attend the parish church than to read 'in your closet' (ibid., 104). 
Tozer was approved by the House of Commons on 25 April 1642 as representative for Glamorgan in the Westminster assembly, but had not attended by 25 October 1643 when he was ordered to do so, and he never complied. In 1644 he became vicar of Yarnton, Oxfordshire, an Exeter College living, but he apparently continued to live in Oxford, where in 1646 he refused a DD degree. In the absence of Exeter's new rector, George Hakewill, Tozer managed the college and was prominent among opponents of the parliamentary visitation of the university. On 21 March 1648 he was called before the commission on a charge of reinstating the use of the 'Book of Common Prayer' in Exeter chapel. On refusing to surrender prayer books and college keys he was expelled from his fellowship in May, and at the end of June, having been forcibly ejected from his pulpit at Carfax by soldiers of the garrison for preaching defiance, was briefly imprisoned in the Boccardo. He was allowed to retain his chamber at Exeter, and was then given permission to travel. 
Tozer went to Rotterdam, where he became minister to the Company of Merchant Adventurers. There on 27 August 1650, 'weake in bodie', he made his will, leaving his friend Thomas Marshall and his servant Henry Parr between them French, Spanish, and Italian dictionaries and bibles, 'all my musical instruments' and manuscripts there, and the works of Henry Ainsworth, the leader of English separatists at Rotterdam (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/215, p. 84). His former colleague William Standard, who had eventually submitted to the parliamentary visitors, and Exeter College itself also benefited from bequests, including Tozer's manuscripts at Exeter and $50 due from land in Exeter Castle. Tozer died in Rotterdam on 11 September 1650, reportedly aged forty-eight, and was buried locally in the English church. Probate was granted on 6 January 1651 to his executor, George Potter, mercer and mayor of Oxford, who received the residue of the estate.

Tracy, Richard (b. before 1501, d. 1569), religious activist, was the fourth of five children of William Tracy of Toddington, Gloucestershire (died 1530), and his wife, Margaret, 'nee' Throckmorton (1462-1530/1), of Coughton, Warwickshire. Before 1547 he married Barbara, daughter of Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote (died 1525); they had three sons, Paul, Nathaniel, and Samuel, and three daughters, Hester, Susan, and Judith. He was admitted BA at Oxford on 27 June 1515, and was admitted to the Inner Temple on 6 July 1519; he remained an active member of the Inner Temple, and was governor in 1549-50. In 1529 he was returned to parliament for Wootton Bassett, perhaps as a client of Sir Edward Baynton or of Sir John Bridges; he probably sat for the same borough in the parliament of 1536, and may have done in 1539 and 1542. 
The Tracys were one of the leading families of northern Gloucestershire, and during the 1520s they and some others in their circle became associated with early protestantism: the reformist martyr James Bainham was Richard's cousin. Richard himself first came to prominence through the affair of his father's will. William Tracy died on 10 October 1530, leaving a will which was a lengthy, uncompromising, and polemical exposition of his protestant understanding of justification. He was posthumously convicted of heresy by the convocation of Canterbury, and the chancellor of Worcester was ordered to exhume the body. He did so, but he also had the body burnt, and since there was no writ of 'de haeretico comburendo', this was illegal. Richard Tracy and his mother were the sole heirs and executors of the will (no mention is made of the elder son, also William), and Richard took up the cudgels on his father's behalf. In addition to his understandable outrage at the 'greate & abhominable worldly shame don unto his kyndred in burnyng his roten bones' (TNA: PRO, SP 1/74, fol. 36'r'), he probably already shared his father's beliefs. He succeeded in having a fine of $300 imposed on the over-zealous chancellor, and, perhaps more significantly, he seems in the process to have caught the eye of Thomas Cromwell. 
In 1533 Cromwell granted Tracy Tewkesbury Abbey's manor of Stanway, Gloucestershire, against the express wishes of the abbot. Stanway was to form the core of the holdings which Tracy accumulated over the next eighteen years, of which the most important was to be a major part of the lands of Clifford Priory. He sat on the commission of the peace for Worcestershire from 1537 to 1547, and for Gloucestershire in 1547-8; in 1539 he was shortlisted for, but not pricked, sheriff of Worcestershire. He worked closely with Bishop Latimer in the dissolution of the local monasteries, and when the blood of Hailes was declared to be fraudulent in 1538 the relic was left in Tracy's custody. Latimer wrote to Cromwell that he wished there were many more like Tracy. 
Tracy's prosperity did not prevent his maintaining a genuine commitment to evangelical reform. One of the most public signs of this was the scriptural names that he chose for his children; his daughters' names in particular betray a distinctively reformist respect for the heroines of the 'Old Testament'. More practically he supported the zealous young Zwinglian Bartholomew Traheron through university after Traheron was orphaned, urging him 'to forsake the puddels of sophisters and to fetche water from the pure fountaynes of the scripture' (Vigo, sig. +2'v'). In 1540 he published a translation of a Latin work by John Frith, and in 1543 a pamphlet of his own on justification by faith. His 'Supplycacion' of 1544, too controversial to be printed in England, combined a demand for doctrinal reform with one for the reform of the Commonwealth; these were themes he had first explored in an unpublished tract in the 1530s. In 1546 Tracy sent a message of encouragement to the imprisoned reformer Edward Crome, although John Foxe noted sourly that Tracy gave no help to the messenger when he was caught and tortured. After the death of Henry VIII, Tracy became more outspoken, publishing two tracts against the mass during 1548. However, his relationship with Edward VI's protectorate regimes was uncomfortable. Although he sat on the 'Chantries Act' commission for Gloucestershire, he was removed from the commission of the peace in 1548, and from May 1551 to November 1552 he was imprisoned in the Tower, after an obscure incident in which he sent a 'seditious lettre and a lewde message' -- presumably one derogatory to the duke of Northumberland -- to his friend Robert Keilway, MP for Bristol. In Mary's reign he remained in England, and although he was summoned before the privy council twice in 1555 for having 'behaved himself verye stubburnely' in religious matters, both times he submitted ('APC', '1554-6', 181). In January 1556 he was troubled again, for objecting to the forced loan. 
Tracy's fortunes revived with Elizabeth's accession. From 1559 to his death he sat on the commission of the peace for Gloucestershire, and he was sheriff in 1560-61. However, his commitment to religious reform could still be obstinate. He preached weekly in Stanway church for a year early in the reign, in violation of the rubrics; in April 1565 he wrote to Cecil, warning brusquely that if the queen did not refrain from the use of images she courted 'great perrel off goddes wrath & dyspleasure' (TNA: PRO, SP 12/36, fol. 77'r'). He died on 8 March 1569 at Stanway.

Tracy, Robert (1655-1735), judge, was born at Toddington, Gloucestershire, the fifth son of Robert Tracy, second Viscount Tracy of Rathcoole ('c'.1592-1662), but the first son with his second wife, Dorothy ('bap'. 1630, died 1685), daughter of Thomas Cocks of Castleditch, Herefordshire. Tracy matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 29 October 1672, aged seventeen, and entered the Middle Temple on 15 April 1673. He was called to the bar on 21 May 1680. He married on 29 August 1683 Anne ('bap'. 1659, died 1714), daughter of William Dowdeswell of Pull Court, Worcestershire. They had three sons and two daughters. 
In July 1699 Tracy was appointed second justice of the Irish king's bench. In November 1700 he was made a serjeant-at-law in order that on the 15th he could transfer to the court of exchequer in England. Despite a little concern expressed to Robert Harley over his future, following the death of William III, Tracy was transferred to the court of common pleas on 23 June 1702. In July 1705 he was perceived as Harley's candidate to succeed Nathan Wright as lord keeper. In 1706 he was one of only two puisne judges appointed by the House of Lords to the law (defects) committee. He presided over the trials of those indicted for riot during the Sacheverell trial in 1710, and in the hiatus that followed Lord Cowper's resignation of the seals in September 1710 Tracy was one of three men given temporary custody of the great seal, and was again considered a possible lord keeper or even lord chancellor, though the posts had never before gone to a puisne judge. 
Tracy was reappointed to common pleas in November 1714 following the accession of George I. In December 1716 he tried the Scottish Jacobite rebels in Carlisle, giving 'a very handsome charge' ('Eight Letters', 523) to the court. In January 1718 he was one of three judges who gave their opinion against the king having the right to educate his grandchildren. He was again one of three judges made temporary commissioners of the great seal that year. He presided at the trial of Edward Arnold in 1724 for 'feloniously, maliciously and wilfully assaulting and discharging a loaded gun' (Baker, 'Mr Justice Tracy', 193) and thereby wounding Lord Onslow, 'against the form' of the 'Waltham Black Act' of 1723. Mention of the act made the shooting of Onslow potentially a capital offence. Arnold's defence rested on insanity and that the shooting could not be prosecuted within the terms of the 'Black Act', as he had not been disguised. Tracy left the first defence to the jury, who convicted Arnold on the basis that he was sane; but on the interpretation of the act he had consulted his colleagues and ruled that the clause in the act relating to malicious shooting was not related to the former clause concerning disguise. Tracy has been accused thereby of ensuring that the 'Black Act' was divorced from its origins in an emergency and became part of 'the general armoury of repressive law' (Thompson, 210) but it has been argued in his defence that the statute was unambiguous in distinguishing its later provisions from those relating to disguise, and that Tracy was careful to interpret statute law and not overturn it. 
In May 1725 Tracy was being talked of for promotion to lord chief baron or lord chief justice, but by December of that year it was rumoured that he would surrender his place in return for a pension. This duly occurred on 26 October 1726 with a pension of $1500 p.a. He was then the youngest judge to be allowed to retire in this way. Tracy died at his 'new built house' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/673/217) at Coscomb, Gloucestershire, on 11 September 1735, and was buried in the local church at Didbrook. His two adult sons having predeceased him, in his will Tracy left his estate to his grandson Robert Tracy, remainder to his daughter Anne, the wife of Thomas Wylde MP, for life, then to his grandson Robert Pratt, the son of his daughter Dorothy and her husband, Sir John Pratt, the former lord chief justice. 
Upon Tracy's death the 'Gentleman's Magazine' described him as 'a complete gentleman and a good lawyer; of a clear head and an honest heart, and delivered his opinion with that genteel affability and integrity that even those who lost a cause, were charmed with his behaviour'. Dudley Ryder, on the other hand, confided to his diary his distaste for some of Tracy's judicial methods and for favouring certain attorneys that appeared before him.

Tracy, William de (d. in or before 1174), one of the murderers of Thomas Becket, was probably the son of Turgis de Tracy, a member of a Norman family with strong connections with Maine, where another Turgis, probably William's grandfather, had been William the Conqueror's seneschal in the 1070s. The family seems to have taken its name from the hamlet of Tracy, near Vire in Normandy. William de Tracy was married and although the identity of his wife is uncertain she was probably English rather than a Norman heiress. He had a son named Henry, known as 'the Hunchback'. 
William de Tracy was a man of considerable property. Lord of at least part of the Devon manor of Bradninch, the 'Domesday' fief of William Capra, which had almost certainly come to the Tracy family during Stephen's reign, he also held Moreton Hampstead, west of Exeter, where the dedication of the parish church was later changed to 'St Thomas Becket'. Moreover he had significant estates in Normandy, where in 1172 he held one fee to himself and the service of a further five in the lordship of Passais. The extent of his holdings is indicated by the knight service he owed. In 1165 he answered for scutage on thirty knights. In his return to the Inquest of Knight Service in 1166 he responded as holding 253/4 knights' fees of the old enfeoffment and 21/2 in demesne, and later scutages were charged on 25-6 knights' fees. 
Although, therefore, Tracy was a man of considerable substance, there is no sign of his having taken an active role in royal service, beyond being described as a courtier and chamber knight. He acted as a witness to at least six royal charters, including Henry II's confirmation of 1155 to St Martin of Troarn, made at Worcester, when the other witnesses, mostly of the highest rank, included the present and future archbishops of Canterbury, Theobald and Thomas Becket. Tracy also made charitable grants on his own account. One such can be assigned to the period before the murder of Becket, by the wording of the charter itself, which refers to a grant of all the churches on his land to Alan de Tracy, clerk, by William de Tracy 'before his crime against St. Thomas'. Another benefaction which probably, though not certainly, antedates the murder is the founding of a leper hospital at Couesmes-en-Froulay near Ambrieres in Maine. An entry in the cartulary of St Etienne de Plessis-Grimoult, executed by Guillaume, bishop of Le Mans (1154-87), records this endowment, and the building of the leper hostel by Tracy. However, the project was evidently of short duration, since by 1187 at the latest the house had been empty for some time, and its revenues had been assigned by Henry II to Alan the Clerk, William de Tracy's brother, who in turn requested that they should be given to the church at Yvrandes, where there was a hermitage linked with Plessis-Grimoult. 
There are slight indications, however, that Tracy had earned and enjoyed royal favour in the years before 1170. He is described as having often performed bravely in military action, and presumably this ability was displayed on the king's behalf. On two occasions, in 1165 and 1168, he received pardons by royal writ for payments for scutage and for the aid for marrying the king's daughter amounting to $37 10's'., the full amount of his debts. 
Tracy was certainly at Henry II's court at Bur-le-Roi, near Bayeux, at Christmas 1170, where Becket's conduct, and above all his excommunication of the bishops who had crowned Henry, the Young King, earlier that year, was angrily discussed. The king's famous outburst, 'What miserable drones and traitors have I nourished and promoted in my household, who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk' (Robertson and Sheppard, 2.429), which later oral tradition renders simply, 'Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?' (Lyttelton, pt 4, 353), prompted the departure of Tracy with Reginald Fitzurse, Hugh de Morville, and Richard Brito on their ill-conceived journey to Canterbury. Fitzurse (in whose article the confrontation with Becket is described more fully) took the lead in the initial interview with the archbishop on 29 December, in which Tracy uttered not a word. Unlike the other three knights Tracy did not put on armour before the frenzied pursuit of Becket into the cathedral, but throughout the murder wore a green cloak and a particoloured tunic. So, as he was less encumbered than the others, they tried at one point to hoist Becket onto his back, to carry him out of the cathedral itself, and in the tussle which followed, the archbishop nearly felled him. It has been claimed that both he and Reginald Fitzurse struck the first blow, and nearly cut off the arm of Becket's attendant, Edward Grim -- Tracy certainly claimed responsibility for this, in conversation the evening after the murder at Saltwood Castle, though he believed that the wounded man was John of Salisbury. Tracy and the other murderers left the cathedral immediately after completing their pillage of the archiepiscopal palace, and retired that night to Saltwood Castle, Kent. They eventually took refuge at the royal castle of Knaresborough, Yorkshire, then in the custody of Morville. 
Tracy seems to have been the first to come to his senses: in a confession to Bartholomew, bishop of Exeter, apparently made in Devon shortly after the murder, he said that his heart sank and he feared that the earth might open up and swallow him. Mythical stories about the fate of all four of the knights involved in Becket's murder appeared rapidly, but especially in the case of Tracy. The most famous of these is that Tracy, on his way to the Holy Land to do penance for the murder, was turned back by adverse winds. Another local legend had it that he spent many years in a hermitage on the Devon coast, expiating his offence. However, an extremely, and apparently deliberately, cryptic letter from Becket's former chaplain, Herbert of Bosham, makes it clear that he had made his way to the papal curia by the latter months of 1171, 'at the time when King Henry went into Ireland' (Robertson and Sheppard, 7.511-12). According to Herbert, Tracy had obtained secret information about the legates Albert and Theodwin, so secret that it should have been known only to the king of England. It is not clear what use Herbert expected Tracy to make of this, but in any case, according to the author of the life of Becket in the Lansdowne manuscript, he was ordered by the pope to continue his journey to the Holy Land. The last certainly established action of his life took place at Cosenza in southern Italy, presumably on his way there, where he executed a charter conferring on the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, the sum of 100's'. a year, to support a monk praying day and night for the living and the dead, from his manor of Daccombe in Devon. This charter was witnessed by the abbot of St Euphemia, where, according to Herbert of Bosham, Tracy lay dying. Herbert gives horrific details of Tracy's death, and although there is an alternative tradition that he did reach the Holy Land, his account of events is to be preferred. The charter making the grant of Daccombe was confirmed by Henry II between July and October 1174, and this confirmation therefore constitutes an extreme 'terminus ante quem' for Tracy's death. 
Although William de Tracy left a legitimate heir in Henry the Hunchback, the latter did not immediately succeed to his father's lands. Indeed William's tenants later claimed that their lord's Devon lands had escheated to the crown after Becket's death. Certainly when they were restored to the Tracy family, after the accession of Richard I in 1189, the recipient was not Henry but William's nephew, Hugh de Couterne. Ten years later Henry did regain them briefly, through some chicanery on King John's part, but they were then returned to Hugh. Despite the claims of some historians to the contrary, it would appear that his part in the archbishop's murder did cause William de Tracy a significant loss of royal favour.

Tracy, William (d. 1530), landowner and religious radical, was the son of Sir Henry Tracy (died 'c'.1506) of Toddington, Gloucestershire, and Alice Baldington, daughter and coheir of Thomas Baldington of Oxfordshire. He was married to Margaret or Margery Throckmorton, daughter of Thomas Throckmorton (1462-1530/31) of Coughton, Warwickshire, and Margaret 'nee' Olney; his sister-in-law, Elizabeth (died 1547), was the last abbess of Denny, near Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire. William Tracy's sister, also Elizabeth, was married to Sir Alexander Bainham of Westbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire, a very prominent member of the county's gentry; their youngest son, James, would be burnt at Smithfield for his evangelical beliefs in 1532. William Tracy was an active member of the Gloucestershire elite, serving as sheriff in 1513 and on numerous commissions of the peace. He was also connected to other prominent families in the county, not only serving as a feoffee of the estate of Sir Alexander Bainham and as an executor of Elizabeth Bainham's will, but also as one of the executors of the will of Dame Joan Huddleston, widow of Sir John, daughter of Sir Miles Stapleton of Norfolk, and granddaughter of Sir Thomas de la Pole. 
Although nothing is known concerning Tracy's education, he was learned, and by the time of his death had developed a clearly evangelical theology. In the 1520s, while carrying out his duties as a JP, he had become acquainted with William Tyndale, the evangelical biblical scholar who was then residing in the county. Tyndale later described him as 'a learned man and better sene in the workes of Sainct Austine... than ever I knew doctoure in Englande' ('Testament'). Tracy's learning, and more particularly his theology, may well have been influenced by his contact with Tyndale, and he in turn may have influenced his nephew, James Bainham. The nature of Tracy's beliefs became most apparent after he died at Toddington, on 10 October 1530, when his remarkable will began to circulate all over England. This will, in which he proclaimed his complete assurance in the salvation of his soul and eschewed all works and prayers as means of salvation, was circulating in London by 1531, made available by an unknown hand. That same year it was refused probate by the prerogative court of Canterbury and condemned by convocation; Tracy was declared a heretic and orders were given to remove his body from consecrated soil. The chancellor of the diocese of Worcester had the body exhumed, but overstepped his authority by having it burnt, and was subsequently fined $300 for his actions. 
However, William Tracy's words could not be silenced by official or semi-official action. Four years after he was declared a heretic and his body was burnt, his will was published in Antwerp with commentaries by William Tyndale and John Frith, and its influence was soon visible in the religious portions of the wills of others. In 1537 William Shepard, of Mendlesham in Suffolk, incorporated Tracy's will in its entirety into his own, adding explanatory passages and paragraphs to clarify his understanding of its content. New editions of the will were then published in 1546 and 1548, and their influence can be seen in a number of wills written all over England between 1548 and 1640. These appropriated portions of Tracy's will and modified them to create their own distinctive but recognizable evangelical religious preambles. William Tracy thus provided a model of evangelical or protestant rhetoric for those crafting religious statements for their wills, a model that outlived him by over 100 years.

Tradescant, John, the elder (d. 1638), gardener and collector, is thought to have been born in England, perhaps in the 1570s. His antecedents are unrecorded but he seems to have had family connections in East Anglia: possible candidates for his parents have been identified at Corton, while his son John Tradescant (bap. 1608, d. 1662) was to leave legacies to 'namesakes' (described by his wife as 'kinsmen') at Walberswick, both villages lying on the Suffolk coast. Anthony Wood's often-quoted reference to 'a famous Gardener called Joh. Tredescaut a Dutchman' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2, col. 888) is misconceived, since it refers to Tradescant's indisputably English-born son. 
The earliest detail known of Tradescant's life is the record of his marriage on 18 June 1607 at Meopham in Kent to Elizabeth Day, daughter of the late vicar of the parish. From two years later there survives a letter written by Tradescant to William Trumbull, British resident in Brussels, outlining difficulties he has encountered on a passage to Flushing -- a journey which suggests (although no reason is given for the visit) that he may already have found a wealthy patron who might send him to the continent in search of garden specimens. 
Such is the conclusion encouraged by Tradescant's subsequent experience in the service of his first known employer, Robert Cecil, first earl of Salisbury, at Hatfield House. In 1611, at Salisbury's behest, Tradescant travelled on an extended trip through the Low Countries and Flanders to Paris, buying trees, flowering shrubs, vines, and bulbs for the gardens at Hatfield. The relevant bills, detailing in addition to their purchase prices arrangements for the transport of the specimens to Hatfield, survive in the Salisbury archives. Following the death of the first earl in 1612, Tradescant remained in the employment of the second earl, on whose behalf he again visited France, before transferring his allegiance (by midsummer 1615) to Edward, first Baron Wotton, who then occupied the former monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. 
During the period of his engagement at Canterbury, where his success in growing melons, mandrakes, and other exotics attracted admiring comment from Sir Henry Mainwaring and others, Tradescant was released to accompany an embassy to Tsar Michael Feodorovich, led by Sir Dudley Digges. Tradescant's diary of this 'Viag of Ambusad' via the North Cape to Archangel, written in a rude hand and style, survives among the Ashmole manuscripts in the Bodleian Library; its significance was first recognized by Hamel about 1854 and it has been republished with commentaries by Konovalov and by Leith-Ross. Tradescant's official duties evidently were of a negligible nature and while the ambassadorial party set off for the imperial court he was left to pursue three weeks of uninterrupted fieldwork among the coastal flora, noting the characteristics of plants and other wildlife -- the first such investigations recorded on Russian soil -- and gathering specimens for shipment back to England. Parkinson ('Paradisi', 346; 'Theatrum', 705) identifies white hellebores, purple cranesbill, and other plants among those brought to England on that occasion by 'that worthy, curious and diligent searcher and preserver of all natures rarities and varieties, my very good friend, John Tradescante', and the list of introductions is extended by Boulger. The 'Rosa Moscovita' later recorded at Lambeth was probably introduced on the same occasion. 
Another exotic, the 'Algiers apricot', evidently was a trophy from another expedition, on which Tradescant accompanied the fleet sent in 1620-21 under the command of Sir Robert Mansell to quell the Barbary pirates who were proving an increasing hazard to English shipping. He sailed as a gentleman volunteer on the pinnace 'Mercury', under the command of Captain Phineas Pett, and whatever action he may have seen at sea Tradescant took care to collect such specimens as he could on land, when circumstances permitted: of various 'corne flagges', he later related to Parkinson that he had seen 'many acres of ground in Barbary spread over with them' (Parkinson, 'Paradisi', 190); a variety of starry-headed clover is said to have been collected by him during that same voyage at Formentera and, again according to Parkinson, the wild pomegranate 'was never seene in England, before John Tradescante... brought it from parts beyond the Seas, and planted it in his Lords Garden at Canterbury' (ibid., 430). 
In 1623 Tradescant entered the service of George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, on whose account he again visited the Low Countries and Flanders, buying trees and other plants. In 1625, when the duke was sent to France to provide an escort for Charles I's bride, Henrietta Maria, on her introductory journey to England, Tradescant followed in his wake with 'my Lords stuff and Trunkes &c' (BL, Add. MS 12528, fol. 21, no. 19) and took the opportunity to acquire further specimens for the duke's gardens at New Hall in Essex. Two years later he accompanied the duke again to France in less congenial circumstances when Buckingham mounted his ill-conceived attempt to bring relief to the besieged protestants of La Rochelle, a mission that foundered when Buckingham's army was decimated on the Ile de Re. 
Following Buckingham's assassination in 1628 Tradescant installed his family in the then relatively undeveloped environs of South Lambeth in Surrey; the original site of the house and garden that were to become so famously associated with 'Tradescant's Ark' and his gardens, marked approximately by the present-day Tradescant Road and Walberswick Road, has been precisely located (Sturdy). There Tradescant established many of the exotics he had personally imported as well as others which arrived more indirectly. Among the latter was the plant with which his name is most closely linked, 'Tradescantia virginiana', of which Parkinson was to write: 'This Spider-Wort is of late knowledge, and for it the Christian world is indebted unto that painfull industrious searcher, and lover of all natures varieties, John Tradescant... who first received it of a friend, that brought it out of Virginia. (Parkinson, 'Paradisi', 152)' While the house provided a settled base for Tradescant for the remainder of his life, he was to be favoured with two further appointments. The first of these came in 1630 when he was chosen by the king as 'Keeper of our gardens, Vines and Silke-wormes' at Oatlands Palace in Surrey (a property which was by this time settled on the queen). Among other duties he carried out there was the laying-out of a new bowling green and the provision of sheltered accommodation for 200 orange trees. His gardening career was crowned in 1637 with his appointment as custodian of the Oxford Physic Garden. The post is likely to have been of an advisory nature and there is little or no evidence of any impact he may have made there; in any case he died within a year of his appointment. 
The museum which he was to establish at Lambeth brought fame to Tradescant in equal measure to his gardening activities, although without the latter he could hardly have achieved so much. Early inspiration may have been provided by Sir Walter Cope (died 1614), whose extensive cabinet was described by the Swiss Thomas Platter in 1599 and on whose behalf Tradescant bought plants to the value of $38 on his visit to the Netherlands in 1611. The same occasion would have provided him with opportunities to visit the well-known collections housed in the botanic gardens and the anatomy school of Leiden University and he was also on intimate terms with the Morin family in Paris, possessors of a 'rare collection of shells, Flowers and Insects' (Evelyn, 'Diary', 'c'.1-6 April, 1644). The greatest impetus to his collecting career undoubtedly came during his years of service to the duke of Buckingham. A letter of 1625, written by Tradescant in Buckingham's name and addressed to Edward Nicholas, then secretary to the navy, exhorts sea captains, ambassadors, and overseas merchants to furnish the duke with all manner of natural and artificial curiosities. The full significance of this letter is difficult to establish: Buckingham's primary interests as a collector lay in the realms of fine art and classical antiquities rather than curiosities, and it is hard to decide whether he merely allowed his gardener to make use of his influential name or whether it reveals a new area of interest on the part of the duke, the everyday administration of which may have been placed in Tradescant's hands. Similarly, Charles I had no recorded interest in curiosities yet a letter of 1633, sent by the secretary of state, Francis Windbank, to the court of the East India Company, desires the company to 'write for such varieties as are expressed in a paper thereinclosed, and being returned to deliver them to John Tradescant to be reserved by him for His Majesties Service' (Leith-Ross, 97). Here again, Tradescant may conceivably have played a curatorial role in this little-known area of the king's interests. 
By 1634 Tradescant's own museum was sufficiently well established for a visitor (Peter Mundy) to spend 'a whole day in peruseing, and that superficially, such as hee had gathered together' (R. C. Temple, ed. 'The Travels of Peter Mundy in Europe and Asia, 1608-1667', Hakluyt Society, ser. 2, vols. 45-6, 1919, 1-3). A description of the collection from 1638 includes the earliest mention of its most famous surviving treasure, 'the robe of the King of Virginia', better known as 'Powhatan's Mantle'. The later history of the collection is discussed in relation to John Tradescant the younger, to whom it passed on his father's death. 
The best-known portrait of Tradescant is that by Cornelis de Neve (a relative of Hester Pooks, who was to marry the younger Tradescant shortly after his father's death): it shows a self-assured, keen-eyed figure with a well-tended beard and with a gold ring in his ear. While appealing as an image, it is thought to have been painted posthumously and at second hand, based on a further posthumous portrait by Emanuel de Critz (another kinsman of Hester's), although the fact that both artists were potentially well acquainted with Tradescant before his death encourages the view that they may have produced reasonably accurate likenesses. 
Tradescant was buried at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, on 17 April 1638; the churchwardens' accounts record a charge of 5's'. 4died for 'the gret bell and black cloth'. In his will, proved on 2 May of that year, he left the lease of the Lambeth property to his son John, along with another lease held at Woodham Walter, Essex; his grandchildren shared leases on further properties in Long Acre and Covent Garden, as well as $150 then held by Lord Goring. Tradescant's wife predeceased him; she was buried at St Mary's on 1 June 1635. The specimens taken home by Tradescant from his extensive travels, and his skill at raising exotic plants in England, considerably increased the number of foreign edible and decorative species henceforth regularly cultivated in English gardens.

Tradescant, John, the younger (bap. 1608, d. 1662), gardener and collector, son of John Tradescant the elder (d. 1638) and his wife, Elizabeth Day, was born at Meopham, Kent, and baptized there on 4 August 1608. He was educated between 1619 and 1623 at the King's School, Canterbury, while his father was in the service of Lord Wotton. 
On 29 February 1628 the younger Tradescant married Jane Hurte (died 1635), who bore him a daughter, Frances ('c'.1628- 'c'.1667), and a son, John (1633-1652). No record survives of his having been indentured, the Gardeners' Company records for the relevant period largely having been destroyed, but in 1634 he was admitted a freeman of the company. Three years later he made the first of three recorded visits to Virginia, when it was noted that 'In 1637 John Tradescant was in the colony, to gather all rarities of flowers, plants, shells, &c' ('CSP col.', 1, no. 11). The presence of this record among the 'State Papers' has been taken to imply that Tradescant's visit to Virginia was undertaken at the instigation of Charles I, a contentious conclusion but one supported by a statement by John Morris, master of the watermills, that he was there under the auspices of the king. The latter author mentions that Tradescant brought back with him 'a couple of hundred plants hitherto unknown to our world'. Parkinson's 'Theatrum botanicum' lists several species of these plants (burr reed, columbine, jasmine, cypress, and possibly the Virginian locust tree, as well as a variety of fern) 'which Mr. John Tradescant the younger, brought home with him from Virginia, this present yeare, 1638, presently after the death of his father' (Parkinson, 1045). 
Thereafter Tradescant was appointed to his father's former position as gardener at the royal palace of Oatlands, while continuing to develop the garden associated with the family property at Lambeth. Estimates of the son's prowess are more difficult to find than for his father, but Morris accords him the highest honours in this field, describing him as 'most experienced in gardening matters' (Leith-Ross, 103) and delighting in exotic plants, while Hartlib, in his 'Universal Husbandry Improved' (1650, p. 72), records that Tradescant 'daily raiseth new and curious things'. Morris goes so far as to bracket Tradescant's name with those of Thomas Johnson and John Parkinson as 'those three great men of our native botanists' -- an estimate to which due weight should be given since Morris had no very high opinion of Tradescant at a personal level (Bekkers, 117). 
In 1642, on the eve of England's collapse into civil war, Tradescant again took ship for Virginia, this time on his own account. The length of his stay is not known but was probably months rather than years. He continued to carry out his duties at Oatlands, perhaps up until the sale for demolition of the palace in 1650: in a bill dated 12 April 1648, now in the Ashmolean Library, he claims $40 'for work to be don for amending the Walks in the Vineyard Garden & for repairing the Bowling Greene there'. In 1653-4 he made the round trip to Virginia for a third and final time. 
Throughout this period Tradescant continued to support his family from the proceeds of his gardening activities as well as from income from the museum established by his father at Lambeth. Three years after the death of his wife Jane in 1635, on 1 October 1638, Tradescant married Hester Pooks: an incidental benefit of this match was the series of portraits of all three generations of Tradescants that survives in the Ashmolean Museum, mostly attributed to the brothers Emanuel and Thomas de Critz and to Cornelis de Neve, to all of whom Hester was related. In 1645 the eighteen-year-old Frances Tradescant was to marry Alexander Norman, a widower of fifty-six. Norman's first wife had been a sister of Frances's grandmother and in his capacity as cooper to the ordnance Norman had supplied Buckingham's expedition to the Ile de Re on which his new wife's grandfather had served. Norman's death is recorded in 1657 and Frances is thought to have died ten years later. Tradescant the younger's son John evidently followed in the footsteps of his elders -- Hartlib says that he was 'brought up to looke to the Botanical Garden and plants' -- but in 1649 Hartlib records that his father was offering to part with the rarities in the museum in return for an annuity of $100, the value of the collection being estimated at ten times that sum. When the youngest John Tradescant died at the age of nineteen in 1652, however, the collection remained unsold. 
It is difficult to detect much in the way of tangible contributions made by the younger Tradescant to the museum, beyond a supposed leg-bone of the Hertfordshire giant Jack o' Legs and a fragment of the True Cross (which 'casually had been broken from' a larger relic variously said to have belonged to Charles I or to Henrietta Maria, while it was in Tradescant's care). Tradescant himself, however, was proud to refer to the collection as 'those Rarities and Curiosities which my Father had scedulously collected, and my selfe with continued diligence have augmented, & hitherto preserved together'. The quotation comes from the preface to his 'Musaeum Tradescantianum', a 183-page octavo volume published in 1656 -- the first museum catalogue to appear in England. The initiative for this volume (and also the funding for it) came from Elias Ashmole, whose influence looms large in later perceptions of the Tradescants' importance. Both Ashmole and Dr Thomas Wharton (who collaborated in the venture) evidently contributed considerably to the text of the catalogue, which bears a dedication to the president and fellows of the College of Physicians. Interestingly, in 1649 Hartlib recorded in his 'Ephemerides' that the physician George Bate offered to endow a physic garden for the college, one possibility being that its basis would be formed by Tradescant's garden. The plant list included in 'Musaeum Tradescantianum' contains a significantly greater proportion of medicinal plants than was grown by the elder Tradescant; however, no formal association with the college was to develop. The presence of significant numbers of food plants in the list may also hint at a degree of purposefulness on Tradescant's part, a conclusion reinforced by his persuasion by the arguments of his collaborators and voiced in the preface to 'Musaeum Tradescantianum', that the catalogue would be 'an honour to our Nation, and a benefit to such ingenious persons as would become further enquirers into the various modes of Natures admirable workes, and the curious Imitators thereof', sentiments which were to have their apotheosis when the collection formed the foundation of the Ashmolean Museum some years later. 
The transfer of the Tradescant collection to Oxford was not a straightforward matter. Deprived of his male heir and indebted to Ashmole for the large part he had played in publishing the catalogue of the museum (which was to be reprinted with a new dedication to Charles II in the year of the Restoration), Tradescant drew up in 1659 a deed of gift by which he left the museum collection to Ashmole; Hester was to retain a lifetime's interest in the collection. Almost immediately, it seems, Hester prevailed upon her husband to change his mind in this matter, as a result of which he drew up first one will, in which the collection was to be bequeathed to the king, and then another in which it was to go instead to the University of Oxford or of Cambridge, at the discretion of Hester, his executrix. These documents, whose existence was kept secret from Ashmole, were inevitably to become a source of bitter disagreement following Tradescant's death at Lambeth on 22 April 1662. (He was buried at St Mary's, Lambeth, on 25 April.) 
Within a month Ashmole had preferred a bill of complaint in chancery, alleging that Hester was attempting to frustrate the terms laid out in the deed of gift drawn up in his favour; Hester vigorously resisted, citing the subsequent will and declaring her intention that the collection should go to Oxford. In May 1664 the case finally came before the lord chancellor, the earl of Clarendon, who found in favour of Ashmole, decreeing that he should 'have and enjoy all and singular these Bookes, Coynes, Medalls, Stones, Pictures, Mechanicks, Antiquities and all and every other the Raryties and Curiosities of what sort or kind soever' (TNA: PRO Chancery Proceedings L33/221/774; Josten, 1966, vol. 3, 987-8). Thereafter the collection remained in Hester's possession and relations seem for a while to have warmed between her and Ashmole, until in 1674 he decided to buy the property adjoining the Tradescant house, after which matters turned sour again with Hester accusing Ashmole of harassment and he ultimately demanding a written retraction of various alleged slanders. Subsequently Hester prevailed on him to take some parts of the collection into his own property and following her death by drowning in her garden pond on 4 April 1678 Ashmole took possession of the remainder. Thus it was through Ashmole that the collection was donated to Oxford (which intention he had signalled some eight years earlier) where, in 1683, the purpose-built Ashmolean Museum was formally inaugurated. 
It has been held by later writers that in founding the institution in which his own name is commemorated, 'the name of Tradescant became unjustly sunk in that of Ashmole'. There can be little doubt, however, that if the collection had passed directly to the university under the terms of Tradescant's second will and without the benefit of the terms Ashmole was able to exact for the provision of new premises and the institution of tightly drafted regulations of his own composition, the benefaction would have proved ephemeral in the extreme in its new environment. However much to the chagrin of the shades of Tradescant and his wife, Ashmole's intervention in their lives contributed not a little to the immortality of their name.

Trahaearn ap Caradog (d. 1081), ruler in Wales, was, according to the genealogies, the son of Caradog ap Gwyn ap Gollwyn. One textually corrupt genealogy states that he was also the son of Angharad, daughter of Maredudd ab Owain (died 999). It has alternatively been suggested that his mother was a daughter of Gwerystan ap Gwaithfoed of Powys. Originally lord of Arwystli (the region around Llanidloes), he became in 1075, on the death of his first cousin Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, ruler of the greater part of north Wales. His claim was at once contested by Gruffudd ap Cynan, representing the old line of Gwynedd, who is said to have defeated Trahaearn at Gwaederw in the region of Meirionydd, but appears to have been beaten at Bron-yr-Erw later in the year and forced to return to Ireland. In 1078, at Pwllgwdig, Trahaearn defeated Rhys ab Owain of south Wales, who was soon afterwards slain. His power brought about a coalition between Gruffudd ap Cynan and Rhys ap Tewdwr of Deheubarth, who in 1081 led a joint expedition against him from St David's, and defeated him and his allies, Caradog ap Gruffudd and Meilyr ap Rhiwallon, at 'Mynydd Carn' (probably in south Cardiganshire), where Trahaearn fell. The battle is commemorated in a poem by Meilyr Brydydd. Robert of Rhuddlan's epitaph attributed to him a victory over 'Trehellum'. Trahaearn left four sons: Meurig and Griffri, both slain in 1106; Llywarch ('fl'. 1124), lord of Arwystli, and Owain. The descendants continued to rule in Arwystli and Cedewain until the thirteenth century.

Traherne, John Montgomery (1788-1860), antiquary, born at Coedrhiglan, St George's-super-Ely, Glamorgan, on 5 October 1788, was the eldest child (of four) and only son of Llewelyn Traherne (1766-1841) and his first wife, Charlotte (died 1796), daughter of John Edmonds and his wife, Charlotte Dive, of St Hilary, Cowbridge, Glamorgan. The Trahernes traced descent on the female side from the Herberts of Swansea, progenitors of the earls of Pembroke and Powis, and on the male from the Treharnes of Castellau, Llantrisant, Glamorgan. Shrewd marriages had transformed the family from minor gentry to one of the major and best-connected county families by the late eighteenth century. Traherne was educated at private schools in Hammersmith (1800) and Lodiers, near Bridport, Dorset (1801-06), where he first acquired a taste for antiquities. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 11 December 1806, proceeding BA in 1810 and MA in 1813. He was ordained deacon in 1811 and priest in 1812, but he served for only six months at St Hilary before ill health forced his resignation. On 21 March 1844 he was installed chancellor of the diocese of Llandaff, his only ecclesiastical office and an appointment which he retained until 1851. 
At Oxford, showing no aptitude for classics or mathematics, Traherne was advised to follow lectures in botany, chemistry, and anatomy. He published some scientific work anonymously and pseudonymously and he was elected fellow of the Linnean Society on 21 December 1813, of the Geological Society in 1817, and of the Royal Society on 29 May 1823. He became one of the chief authorities of his time on the genealogies, history, and archaeology of Glamorgan. In 1822 he published 'Lists of the Knights of the Shire for Glamorgan and of Members for the Boroughs' and 'Abstract of Pamphlets Relative to Cardiff Castle in the Reign of Charles I'. In 1840 he edited 'Historical notices of Sir Matthew Cradock, knt., of Swansea, in the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII' and also 'Stradling correspondence: a series of letters written in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, with notices of the family of Stradling of St Donat's Castle'. The bulk of the letters in this collection were addressed to Sir Edward Stradling (1529-1609), an Elizabethan scholar and literary patron. Traherne was an active member of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, contributing notes and papers to 'Archaeologia Cambrensis', and he was a corresponding member of the Welsh Manuscript Society. Among his acquaintances and correspondents were a number of leading literary and scientific figures as well as most contemporary Welsh scholars, and his assistance was frequently acknowledged by other workers in the same field. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 15 February 1838, and he was also an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries, Newcastle upon Tyne, and of the Society of Antiquaries, Copenhagen. He also played a part in local cultural life, acting as a trustee of the Cowbridge lending library and of the town hall building committee, and as a governor of Howell's School, Llandaff. 
Traherne married, on 23 April 1830, Charlotte Louisa (died 1880), third daughter of Thomas Mansel Talbot of Margam, who was an antiquary and artist in her own right. They had no children. He died on 6 February 1860 at Coedrhiglan, where he had resided most of his life, and which he rebuilt in 1820-23 after taking down the older house of 1767; but he spent the last months of his life at St Hilary, near Cowbridge, Glamorgan, and it was here that he was buried. Traherne's collections of manuscripts contain a great deal of late medieval poetry relating to Glamorgan, histories, records, and genealogies of the county, the papers of the eighteenth-century lexicographer John Walters, numerous transcripts, and his correspondence. A manuscript autobiography to 'c'.1830 is in private hands. A few manuscripts passed on his death to his friend Sir Thomas Phillipps, and are at the central library in Cardiff, but the greater part of the collections, including the papers of William Davies (1756-1823) of Cringell, purchased by Traherne but presented by him to the Neath Philosophical Society Library in 1844, are at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth.

Traheron, Bartholomew (c.1510-1558?), protestant writer and reformer, is of uncertain origins, although he is thought to have been of Cornish stock. The chronology of his university career suggests that he was born about 1510. He was possibly the son of George Traheron, a Herefordshire JP in 1523 who died soon after that year. Bartholomew was then brought up by Richard Tracy of Gloucestershire (son of the famous protestant William Tracy, whose will was commented upon by both William Tyndale and John Frith) under whose tutelage he almost certainly came into contact with evangelical ideas in his early life. He studied at Oxford, possibly at Exeter College or Hart Hall, and was persecuted there by John London, warden of New College. After Oxford he moved to Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1533. It was at some point after this that he travelled abroad, especially in Italy and Germany, and kept company with John Butler, Nicholas Eliot, and Nicholas Partridge. He met Heinrich Bullinger at Zurich in September 1537, and from there went to Strasbourg in 1538, where he published a treatise exhorting his brother Thomas to convert to the reformed faith. 
By March 1539 at the latest, Traheron had entered the service of Thomas Cromwell, but he withdrew from political life after the latter's fall in 1540. Some time about 1542 he married the daughter of a man who 'followed godly doctrine'; she was so poor that her husband was rumoured to have been forced to take up school teaching (Robinson, 'Original Letters', 626). In 1543 he published a translation of an Italian book on surgery, entitled 'The most excelent worckes of chirurgery made and set forth by maister John Vigon, head chirurgien of our tyme in Italy, translated into Englishe by Barth. Traheron, whereunto is added an exposition of straunge termes and unknowen symples, belongynge unto the arte' ('ESTC', no. 24720). Shortly before fleeing once again to the continent in 1546, he was granted three rectories in St Asaph diocese on the recommendation of Lord Chancellor Wriothesley. While he was abroad Traheron stayed in Geneva, where he met Calvin and developed the distinctive views on predestination which were shortly to win him some notoriety. With the accession of Edward VI in 1547 he was summoned back to England and from 22 April 1547 to 1 December 1549 was writer to the great seal and examiner of letters patent. He was elected MP for Barnstaple in 1547, and during the first session of the new parliament campaigned vigorously for the reform of doctrine. In the second session, which began in November 1548, he made a name for himself as one who argued for an unambiguously sacramentarian policy in the reformation of the eucharist. From 14 December 1549 to 22 October 1553 he was keeper of the king's library with a salary of 20 marks, while in February 1550 he was appointed a tutor to the young Henry Brandon, second duke of Suffolk. 
At about this time Traheron engaged in a vigorous dispute with John Hooper over the nature of predestination, where his Genevan background set him in opposition to Hooper's eclectic approach which drew on the work of Bullinger and Melanchthon. Their struggle was a conflict between former exiles and reflected differences which existed between various continental protestants. Traheron argued strongly for a double-predestinarian approach, while Hooper tended more towards the synergistic position of Melanchthon, even borrowing significant passages from Melanchthon's writings in order to strengthen his arguments. Traheron is almost certainly one of the unnamed Calvinists whom Hooper excoriates in the preface to the second edition of his 'A Declaration of the Ten Holy Commandments'. The debate provoked John ab Ulmis to write to Bullinger on 30 April 1550, marvelling at how far the two men disagreed over predestination. Later that same year, on 31 December, ab Ulmis again wrote to Bullinger about the rough treatment which Traheron thought he was receiving at Hooper's hands. 
After Suffolk died on 14 July 1551 Traheron moved once more to the country for a life of quiet scholarship. He contributed to the volume of epigrams published on the death of Bucer in 1551. In September of that year, however, William Cecil proposed that he be made dean of Chichester, and he was nominated to this position on 29 September, though it was not until 8 January 1552 that he was finally elected. In the meantime, on 11 November 1551, he was nominated to the committee for the reform of church law. The chapter at Chichester apparently resented the intrusion of a layman and was consistently obstructive during his tenure. As a result he resigned about the end of 1552 to take up a canonry at Windsor which had been arranged for him in September by the council. He proved himself to be something of a nuisance in this position as well, and this, together with a tendency towards outspokenness which made him few friends in high places, helped ensure that he was not elected to the second parliament of the reign, which began on 1 March 1553. At this point, moreover, he seems once again to have become embroiled in a debate over predestination, writing to Bullinger to canvas Zurich opinion on the issue in order to provide himself with ammunition against a Melanchthonian party (possibly Hooper once again) which was gaining influence. Bullinger's reply was far too equivocal on key issues for Traheron, who made his position clear in a further letter indicating the Calvinistic bent of his thinking: 'I cannot altogether think as you do. For you so state that God permits certain things, that you seem to take away from him the power of acting. We say that God permits many things, when he does not renew men by his Spirit, but gives them up to the dominion of their own lusts. And though God does not himself create in us evil desires, which are born with us; we maintain nevertheless that he determines the place, time, and mode, so that nothing can happen otherwise than as he has before determined it should happen. (Robinson, 'Original Letters', 326)' On Mary's accession, Traheron, like many other protestants, resigned his appointments and went into exile on the continent. He was a firm supporter of Richard Cox during the latter's brief conflict with John Knox and William Whittingham over the use of the 'Book of Common Prayer' in the English church at Frankfurt am Main. Here he was one of the signatories to the famous letter which Cox wrote to Calvin on 20 September 1555 which justified the 'Book of Common Prayer' and the treatment of Knox, claiming in classic 'post hoc'- 'propter hoc' style that the Scotsman's 'Admonition to England' was so vitriolic as to require his removal: 'We can assure you, that that insane pamphlet of Knox's added much oil to the flame of persecution in England. For before the pamphlet was published, not one of our brethren had suffered death; and we are sure that you know how many excellent men perished in the flames as soon as it came out. (Robinson, 'Original Letters', 762)' After Knox's expulsion Traheron appears to have briefly held a theological lectureship in the congregation at Frankfurt before leaving for Wesel, where he published expositions of part of 'John's gospel' and of the book of 'Revelation', as well as engaging in a small amount of anti-Catholic polemicizing. His treatise 'A Warning to England to Repente, by the Terrible Exemple of Calice, Given the 7 of March 1558', indicates that he was still alive at that date, but he is not recorded thereafter, and probably died at Wesel during that year. He certainly never returned to England.

Trail, Robert (1642-1716), Presbyterian minister, was born in May 1642 at Elie in Fife, the second son of Robert Trail (1603-1678), minister of Elie and then Old Greyfriars, Edinburgh, and Jean (died 1680), daughter of Alexander Annand of Auchterallan in Aberdeenshire. He lived in Elie until his father's transference to Edinburgh in 1648, but little is known of his early education with the notable exception that it was closely supervised by his father in the family home. Although the exact dates are unknown, he matriculated and graduated in the late 1650s at the University of Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself in literary and theological studies. He shared his father's resolute presbyterian convictions and sided with the protester party in the Church of Scotland, which was committed to the precepts and principles laid down in the national covenant. He was intimate with William Guthrie of Fenwick and accompanied his father's friend, James Guthrie, minister of Stirling, to his place of execution in the capital in May 1661. Little is known about his whereabouts or activities between then and 1666 but an entry in the Scottish privy council records of 9 October 1667 reveals that he was 'sometyme chaplane to Scotstarvet' ('Reg. PCS', 2. 347-8). The Scotstarvit in question was probably the house of Scot of Scotstarvit in Fife. After his father's banishment from Scotland early in 1663 for reminding Charles II of his obligations to the covenant, Trail became increasingly associated with the covenanter and itinerant preacher John Welsh of Irongray. Trail was back living in Edinburgh at some point in 1666, for he was forced to flee along with his mother and elder brother, William, after a copy of John Brown of Wamphray's proscribed work 'An apologeticall relation of the particular sufferings of the faithfull ministers & professours of the Church of Scotland, since 1660' was discovered during a raid on the family home by the civil authorities. He was declared a rebel and a traitor by the privy council on 4 December 1666 for taking part in the Pentland rising the previous month. 
Early in 1667 Trail joined his father in the Netherlands, where he continued to study theology and distinguished himself in assisting Nethenus, the professor of divinity at the University of Utrecht, in the preparation of Samuel Rutherford's 'Examen Arminianismi' (1668) for republication. Nethenus described him as 'a pious, prudent, learned, and industrious young man' ('Works', 1.v). In his absence the Scottish privy council exempted him from the 'Act of Indemnity' in October 1667. It was probably for this reason that he settled in England in 1669 and was ordained to the ministry by presbyterian ministers in London the following year and called and inducted to a nonconformist presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent. On 14 December 1676 an official complaint was registered against him by the Scottish privy council after it was discovered that he was among those who 'did preach and exercise the functions of the ministry' on the English side of the border with Scotland ('Reg. PCS', 5.79). He is also known to have crossed into Scotland where he preached and officiated at conventicles with John Welsh. He was in Edinburgh in May 1677 and was apprehended by the civil authorities in July. He appeared before the privy council on the 19th of that same month. During his interrogation he admitted to preaching at house conventicles and to assisting John Welsh on the English side of the border, but refused to perjure himself on oath by confessing to preaching at open-air gatherings. The council ordered him detained on the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth until further notice. On 5 October he petitioned the council to be freed from his incarceration, which plea was granted on 1 November on pain of 2000 merks and re-imprisonment on the Bass if he re-offended. He returned to Cranbrook and remained there for an indefinite period before settling in London. After the Revolution of 1688 he accepted a call to be co-pastor with Nathaniel Mather of an Independent church which met in Paved Alley, Lime Street. After Mather's death in 1697 he is known to have been pastor to another congregation in the city for the remainder of his life. 
Trail was an evangelical writer and biblical expositor of some distinction. His exposition of '1 Timothy' 4:16 was first published in 1682 under the title 'By What Means can Ministers Best Win Souls?' He made a notable contribution in the Neonomian controversy that followed the publication of the works of Dr Tobias Crisp in 1690. His 'A vindication of the protestant doctrine concerning justification and of its preachers and professors from the unjust charge of antinomianism' (1692) was a judicious and pertinent defence of the Reformed doctrine of grace against antinomianism, Arminianism, and neonomianism. He also wrote a biographical sketch on William Guthrie and penned an endorsement of Walter Marshall's 'Gospel-Mystery of Sanctification' (1692). By far the bulk of his published works consisted of series of sermons. His thirteen sermons on 'Hebrews' 4: 16 were published under the title 'The Throne of Grace' (1696), which was later greatly prized by Ebenezer Erskine and was the inspiration for his 'The Full Assurance of Faith' from the same text. Trail's sixteen sermons on 'John' 17: 24 entitled 'Concerning the Lord's Prayer'; twenty-one on 'Hebrews' 10: 20-24, which were collectively published as a 'Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith'; eleven sermons on '1 Peter' 1: 1-4; and six on 'Galatians' 2: 21 which were printed as the 'Righteousness of Christ', were all published posthumously. It was testimony to his ongoing popularity as a writer that the first edition of his collective works appeared in 1745 to be followed by further editions in 1776, 1795, 1806, 1810, and 1845. The Banner of Truth Trust published a definitive edition of his works in 1975. He died unmarried on 16 May 1716 in London at the age of seventy-four.

Trail, Walter (b. before 1345?, d. 1401), bishop of St Andrews, is of unknown origins. Although one version of Walter Bower's 'Scotichronicon' claims that he was almost seventy when he died in 1401, Trail's appearance as a student in Paris in the mid-1360s suggests a date of birth shortly before 1345. He was educated at the universities of Paris and Orleans, where his studies in arts and law extended through much of the 1360s and 1370s. In this period he obtained an MA degree and became a doctor of both civil and canon law. He spent the early part of his ecclesiastical career in the papal curia. Before 26 February 1379 Trail had been appointed auditor of the sacred apostolic palace, and between 25 June and 31 October 1383 he became a referendary in the papal chancery. As a result of his services he obtained a number of papal grants to benefices in his native Scotland, although many of these were never realized. 
On 29 November 1385, shortly after the death of William Landel, Trail was papally provided (at Avignon) to the see of St Andrews. The cathedral chapter had elected the prior of St Andrews, Stephen Pa, as Landel's successor, but Pa was captured by English pirates on his way to seek papal confirmation of his election and died in captivity at Alnwick on 2 March 1386. Trail appears to have been consecrated as bishop between 27 January and 15 February 1386. He continued to enjoy considerable papal favour, including a grant of the right to judge first appeals from Scottish diocesan courts to the papacy. In addition, before 1 December 1394, he was appointed papal collector in Scotland. 
Trail drew praise from the near contemporary chroniclers Andrew Wyntoun and Walter Bower for his high moral standards and for his role in the governance of the kingdom. Bower describes him as 'a very solid pillar of the church, a vehicle for eloquence, a repository of knowledge and defender of the church' (Bower, 8.37). From about October 1387 he became a regular witness to royal charters under the great seal and, as the premier Scottish bishop, took the leading role in public ceremonies such as the funeral of Robert II and the coronation of his successor, Robert III, in August 1390. Trail was also active as a diplomat, visiting the French court in 1391-2 and taking part in Anglo-Scottish truce negotiations during the 1390s. He may have played a significant role in the easing of strained relations within the royal dynasty in the 1390s. His death in 1401, combined with the near simultaneous demise of Queen Annabella and Archibald, third earl of Douglas, was held to be responsible for the outbreak of hostilities between Robert, duke of Albany, and his nephew David, duke of Rothesay, in 1401-2. Bower asserts that with the deaths of Trail, Annabella, and Douglas 'dignity departed, honour withdrew and the integrity of Scotland died away' (ibid.). 
Apart from his role in the political and social life of the kingdom, Trail was said to have been an active and severe diocesan bishop, and to have been responsible for the building of the episcopal castle in St Andrews. He is last recorded on 5 March 1401, as a witness to a royal charter, and was certainly dead by 1 July 1401 when the St Andrews Cathedral chapter met to elect his successor. According to Bower, Trail was buried close to the high altar of St Andrews Cathedral.

Traill, Henry Duff (1842-1900), satirist and journalist, was born at Morden Hill, Blackheath, on 14 August 1842, the sixth son of James Traill, a magistrate of Greenwich and Woolwich, and his wife, Caroline, 'nee' Whateley, of Handsworth, Staffordshire. His uncle, George Traill, was Liberal MP for Orkney and Caithness until 1869. Traill was educated from April 1853 at Merchant Taylors' School, London, where he was good at both classics and mathematics and came top of the school. He was elected to St John's College, Oxford, in 1861, as one of the last holders of a fellowship reserved for former pupils of Merchant Taylors' School. Although he gained a first class in classical moderations in 1863, he graduated BA with a second class degree in natural science in 1865. In 1868 he was awarded a BCL degree, and in 1873 the honorary degree of DCL. He relinquished his fellowship on his marriage in 1879 to Emily ('b'. 1848/9), daughter of Henry George Mitchell, tradesman. 
Traill was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1869 and in 1871 he was appointed an inspector of returns under the education office. But journalism particularly attracted him, and he soon found work on the 'Yorkshire Post'. After settling in London he contributed to several newspapers, including 'The Observer', and in 1873 joined the staff of the 'Pall Mall Gazette', edited by Frederick Greenwood. When the 'St James's Gazette' was founded in 1880 he left the 'Pall Mall Gazette' to join the staff of the new journal, and also wrote literary reviews, essays, and leading articles for the 'Saturday Review'. He also wrote mainly satirical verses, some of which were republished as 'Recaptured Rhymes' (1882) and 'Saturday Songs' (1890). His gift for parody can be seen at its best, perhaps, in the pamphlet 'The Israelitish Question and the Comments of the Canaan Journals Thereon' (which he published anonymously in 1876), in which the style of the leading London newspapers was cleverly caricatured. 
In 1882 Traill left the 'St James's Gazette' to join the 'Daily Telegraph', where he acted as chief political leader writer until 1897. He continued to contribute to the 'Saturday Review', and after 1888 again wrote for the 'St James's'. Between 1889 and 1891 he was editor of 'The Observer'. In 1897 on its foundation, he became the editor of 'Literature', a post he held until his death. 
Traill also published books on a wide variety of subjects. In 1881 he wrote a short account in the 'English Citizen' series, of the British constitution. He also contributed short lives of Sterne (1882) and Coleridge (1884) for the 'English Men of Letters' series, as well as full-scale biographies of Shaftesbury (1886), William III (1888), Strafford (1889), the marquess of Salisbury (1891), and Lord Cromer (1897). A more elaborate and deeply researched biography was his 'Life of Sir John Franklin' (1896), the Arctic explorer, which drew on personal documents placed at his disposal by Franklin's family. Between 1893 and 1897 he was editor of an ambitious project, 'Social England', which aimed to give a historical account of the social, industrial, and political development of the nation. 
Traill's satirical gifts are exhibited in the collections of his literary and miscellaneous essays, 'Number Twenty' (1892) and 'The New Fiction' (1897), and particularly in 'The New Lucian', published in 1884. He also used his experience of writing and acting in school and university plays to write for the stage. His 'Glaucus: a Tale of a Fish' was performed at the Olympic Theatre in 1865 with the popular burlesque actress Ellen Farren in the title role. His most ambitious play was 'The Medicine Man', written in collaboration with Robert Hichens and produced by Sir Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in May 1898. 
Traill was fond of travel, especially to the Mediterranean, and in 1893 and in 1895 he visited Egypt, describing the second journey in animated letters to the 'Daily Telegraph', which were afterwards republished as 'From Cairo to the Soudan Frontier' (1896). His last book, an account of recent north-eastern African history, was published posthumously as 'England, Egypt, and the Soudan' (1900). Traill died at the Great Western Hotel, Paddington, London, on 21 February 1900 from a wholly unsuspected disease of the heart. He was buried on 26 February 1900 in the Paddington old cemetery, Kilburn. His widow was granted a civil-list pension.

Traill, Thomas Stewart (1781-1862), physician and specialist in medical jurisprudence, was born at Kirkwall, Orkney, on 29 October 1781, the only son of Reverend Thomas Traill (died 1782), of Tirlet, Orkney, and his wife, Lucia, daughter of James Traill, of Westray, Orkney. Traill's father died soon after his birth and he was educated privately in Orkney by his uncle, Reverend Robert Yule, tutor to the sons of Thomas Balfour, sheriff-substitute for Orkney. Traill took his MA at Edinburgh and graduated MD, Edinburgh, in 1802. 
Though Traill expressed a wish to practise medicine in Scotland unknown circumstances led him to set up in general practice in Liverpool in 1804 where, over the next twenty-seven years, he built up a prosperous practice. Liverpool's burgeoning cultural scene offered Traill many opportunities to pursue his keen literary and scientific interests. His ability to absorb and store factual material on diverse subjects helps to account for his prolific output of articles and papers. He became part of the 'Roscoe group' of influential doctors and businessmen devoted to the furtherance of arts and the sciences ['see 'Roscoe, William (1753-1831)], and was a founder member and first secretary of the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society (1812). He was also a prime mover in the foundation of the Liverpool Royal Institution (1817) where he lectured as titular professor of chemistry and became one of the institute's first presidents. On 26 July 1811 Traill married Christian (died 1842), second daughter of Dr Henry Robertson, parish minister of Kiltearn, Ross-shire. There were two sons and three daughters of the marriage. 
In 1829 Traill was appointed physician to Liverpool Infirmary and joined the staff of the Ophthalmic Infirmary. In 1831 he became one of four doctors entrusted by Liverpool town council with combating cholera. However, Traill left Liverpool in 1832 to become regius professor of medical jurisprudence in the University of Edinburgh, a position achieved by direct political patronage, a not uncommon way of acquiring regius medical chairs. Traill originally applied for the vacant chair of materia medica, but Edinburgh town council and magistrates elected Robert Christison, then professor of medical jurisprudence. 
Traill was an avowed whig and friend of Henry Brougham from university days, and in 1812 had supported Brougham's failed campaign against Canning to become a member of parliament for Liverpool. Traill's vigorous support lost him many tory patients, and income. Among the many notable names in Traill's testimonials were Brougham, then lord chancellor, and Francis Jeffrey, lord advocate for Scotland. Traill wrote immediately to the home secretary, Lord Melbourne, for Christison's vacant chair, which lay within the gift of the crown, stressing that 'I have the honour to be personally known to the Lord Chancellor Brougham and the Lord Advocate' (Traill to Lord Melbourne, 20 June 1832, NA Scot., HH5/7). Within weeks his warrant for the chair of medical jurisprudence was prepared. Thus, at the age of fifty, Traill returned to Scotland and held the chair until his death in 1862. 
Traill reintroduced the chair's tandem subject, medical police (public health), discarded by Christison in 1822. An amiable man with a retentive memory, Traill was an able teacher, and never missed a single lecture. His 'Outlines of a Course of Lectures on Medical Jurisprudence', published in 1836, reached a third edition in 1857. Together with Christison and James Syme, Traill produced the standard work on post-mortem procedure in Scotland, 'The Medico-Legal Examination of Dead Bodies', published in 1839 by request of the lord advocate. The principles expounded are still current practice. Overshadowed by Christison's expertise in toxicology, Traill did not achieve eminence as a medical witness. He was editor of the eighth edition of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica', contributing some hundreds of articles but, through ill health, much of the editing of the twenty-one volumes was done by others. 
Traill remained an Orkney man to the last. It is reported that he never took a class fee from an Orkney student and often revisited his birthplace to deliver chemistry lectures, the fees from which he donated to the islands' poor. Traill was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1819 and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1833, becoming president from 1852 to 1854. Traill was not averse to the principle of admitting women to the medical profession. In 1862 he supported Elizabeth Garrett's (unsuccessful) petition to be admitted to the college's preliminary examination and registration. Traill died at Edinburgh on 30 July 1862.

Train, Joseph (1779-1852), exciseman and antiquary, was born on 6 November 1779 at Gilminscroft in the parish of Sorn, Ayrshire, where his father was land steward. In 1787 the family moved to Ayr, where Train's father became a day labourer. His own schooling was limited. At an early age he was apprenticed to a weaver in Ayr, but he persevered with private study, taking a particular interest in antiquarian and traditional lore. 
Train joined the ranks of the 7th North British regiment of militia in June 1798. For almost four years he served as a private at barracks and camps in various parts of Scotland, until the regiment was run down during the peace of Amiens. He then returned to the loom in Ayr, and on 30 April 1803 married Mary ('b'. 1780), daughter of Robert Wilson, a gardener in that town. The couple had five children. 
In 1806 Train published his 'Poetical Reveries', the first fruit of his scholarly and literary pursuits. One of the subscribers was his former company commander, Sir David Hunter Blair. Two years later Blair secured Train an appointment in the Scottish excise, and he entered as an assistant officer. A transfer in 1810 from Ayr to Balnaguard, in Perthshire, pitted him against the whisky bootleggers for a year, after which he was posted back to Ayrshire, as an officer. A period of more stability ensued after he was moved in 1813 from Largs to Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire. His work now ranged over much of Galloway and Carrick, and he began to gather materials for a history of the region. He also turned into verse some of the tales and traditions that he had collected. When these were printed by Ballantyne in 1814, under the title 'Strains of the Mountain Muse', they caught the eye of Walter Scott (an anecdote in the collection eventually provided the outline of Scott's 'Wandering Willie's Tale', in 'Redgauntlet'). At this time Scott was working on 'The Lord of the Isles' and he asked Train for information about Turnberry Castle, where Bruce landed on his return from Ireland. From then on Train willingly subordinated his pursuits to Scott's interests and was soon sending him pages crammed with antiquarian material. One of the stories that he forwarded was of an astrologer wandering in the wilds of Galloway who predicted the future of a new-born child, and this was woven into the opening chapters of 'Guy Mannering'. In the course of their long friendship Train was just as assiduous in finding curiosities for Scott's museum, including Rob Roy's pouch, which was the germ of the novel featuring that outlaw. 
Scott did what he could to further Train's career. He passed on to the chairman of the Scottish excise board a paper that Train had produced on the control of distillation of spirits, and the proposals were implemented. In 1816 Train made the first of several visits to Scott in Edinburgh. On this occasion he fired Scott's imagination with his accounts of Robert Paterson -- 'Old Mortality' -- thus suggesting the theme of the novel of that name. Scott's melodrama 'The Doom of Devorgoil', completed in 1817, was based on another of Train's stories. 'The Heart of Midlothian', published in the following year, was indebted to Train for information about the prototype of Madge Wildfire, a figure known as Feckless Fannie who formerly wandered through Ayrshire and Galloway. Other beneficiaries of Train's researches at this time included George Chalmers, who sought his assistance for sections of his bulky historical and topographical work 'Caledonia'. 
Scott's efforts on Train's behalf bore further fruit in 1820. He was placed on the list for promotion to the grade of supervisor, leading to another succession of postings, to Cupar in Fife, to Kirkintilloch, to Queensferry, and to Falkirk. In September 1823 a single board was created to manage the excise in the United Kingdom as a whole, and Scott turned his attention southwards. In 1824 he recommended his protege to Peel, the home secretary, who drew in Lord Liverpool, the prime minister, and a 'whisper' was conveyed to the new board. But all did not go smoothly. Many Scottish officers were convinced that they were discriminated against by English officials who occupied some of the key posts in Edinburgh. Train, for one, was found guilty of negligence, on flimsy grounds, and was removed from Falkirk to Wigtown at the end of 1824; he did, however, succeed in an application for a more congenial vacancy in Dumfries a few months later. Robert Burns, who had briefly officiated there as supervisor, described the job as 'an incessant drudgery, and would be nearly a compleat bar to every species of literary pursuit' ('Complete Letters of Robert Burns', 1987, 715). Train made the best of it. He was able to recover stories of Burns and passed them on to Lockhart when he was working on his life of Burns, while presenting other documents to Scott. He also still found time for visits to Edinburgh and Abbotsford. On one of these he related the story that formed the basis of 'The Surgeon's Daughter' in the first series of 'Chronicles of the Canongate'. Scott's introduction (1827) to these chronicles complemented his recent public acknowledgement of authorship of the 'Waverley' novels with a tribute to those who had supplied 'hints of subjects and legends'. He gave pride of place to Train's 'unremitting kindness' and 'unwearied industry'. 
If Train was as diligent in his official duties as he was in searching for antiquarian lore, he well deserved Scott's lobbying. Once more, however, he met with disapproval on account of a supposed negligence, and was reduced from the rank of supervisor. On appeal he regained his former grade, but at the same time was posted to Castle Douglas late in 1827. Before long Scott's preparations for his 'magnum opus' edition of the 'Waverley' novels stimulated a new cycle of activity, and Train began supplying a variety of fresh information, utilized in Scott's introductions and notes. Further recognition came in November 1829, when Train was admitted fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Scott's death in 1832 left a great blank, but Train's interest in his old studies endured. Having retired from the excise on health grounds in 1836, with an annual pension of $112, he remained in Castle Douglas, free to return to authorship on his own account. Scott had long before urged him to undertake a history of the Isle of Man. Train now produced his substantial 'Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man', published in Douglas in four parts in 1842-5. It was followed in 1846 by 'The Buchanites from First to Last', chronicling a peculiar religious sect that had had a following in south-west Scotland. He also kept up an extensive correspondence with a circle of scholarly friends, and among those who applied to him for help was Agnes Strickland, seeking materials for a life of Mary, queen of Scots. 
James Hannay visited Train towards the end of 1852, afterwards describing him as 'a tall old man, with an autumnal red in his face, hale-looking, and of simple, quaint manners' (Hannay, 476). The little parlour in Lochvale Cottage, on the banks of Carlingwark Loch, Castle Douglas, was full of antiquities and specimens of ancient furniture, which Train proudly displayed to his visitor. A few weeks later, on 7 December 1852, after a short illness, he died peacefully at his cottage, in his seventy-fourth year.

Trant, Nicholas (1769-1839), army officer, was the son of Thomas Trant and his wife, the daughter of James Trant. His mother and father were probably cousins, living in Dingle, co. Kerry, and his forebears were of Danish origin. His grandfather Dominick Trant, also of Dingle, wrote a tract, 'Considerations on the Present disturbance in Munster' (1787). 
Trant was educated at a military college in France, but when the Revolutionary War broke out he entered the British army, and on 31 May 1794 he was commissioned lieutenant in the 84th foot. He served with the 84th at Flushing, and went with it to the Cape of Good Hope in 1795. After his return to England he received command of a company in one of the regiments of the Irish brigade. His regiment was sent to Portugal, and he took part in the expedition under Sir Charles Stuart which resulted in the capture of Minorca in November 1798. There Trant was appointed agent-general for prizes, and helped to organize the Minorca regiment, in which he was made major on 17 January 1799. This was the year in which Trant married Sarah Georgina Horsington, an Englishwoman with evangelical connections. A daughter, Clarissa Trant ['see below'], was born to the couple in 1800, and a son, Thomas Abercrombie, in 1805. Sarah died shortly after Thomas's birth. Thomas was commissioned in the 38th foot in 1820, and was captain in the 28th foot when he died, aged twenty-seven, on 13 March 1832. 
Trant served in the expedition to Egypt, and his regiment supported the 42nd and 28th in the battle of Alexandria. It was disbanded after the peace of Amiens, and Trant left the army; but he soon made a fresh start in it, and was commissioned ensign in the Royal Staff Corps on 25 December 1803. He was promoted lieutenant on 28 November 1805, and was sent to Portugal as a military agent in 1808. Because British officers usually received advanced rank in the Portuguese service he was appointed lieutenant-colonel. When Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the duke of Wellington) advanced from the Mondego in August the Portuguese general Bernardin Freire remained behind, but he allowed Trant to accompany Wellesley with a Portuguese corps of 1500 foot and 250 horse. At Rolica his assignment was to turn the French left. His inexperienced troops became jammed in a narrow gorge, however, and did not fully achieve their objective. At Vimeiro he was in reserve with Craufurd's British brigade. 
Trant returned to England after the convention of Cintra, but went back to Portugal early in 1809 as part of the quartermaster-general's contingent to arrange details of the evacuation then planned. However, later in the year another British force began landing, and Trant raised a corps from the students of Coimbra University. After the Portuguese defeat at Braga and the French capture of Porto, fresh recruits flocked to him. With about 3000 men he boldly maintained himself on the Vouga until May. He took part in the advance of Wellesley's army to the Douro, and was made governor of Porto when it was recovered. 
Trant was promoted captain in the staff corps on 1 June 1809, but soon afterwards was told that he would be removed from it unless he gave up his Portuguese employment. The situation was saved by Wellington, who intervened to write, on 9 May 1810, that there was no officer the loss of whose services in Portugal would be more felt. By this time Trant held the rank of brigadier-general. 
In the autumn of 1810, while Wellington was falling back on Torres Vedras, Trant twice showed his 'activity and prudent enterprise', as Beresford described it. On 20 September, with a squadron of cavalry and 2000 militia, he surprised the French artillery train in a defile. His men became alarmed, and he had to fall back; but he took 100 prisoners, and caused Massena to lose two vital days in his advance. On 7 October he marched suddenly upon Coimbra, where Massena had left his sick and wounded with only a small guard. He met with little or no resistance, and carried off 5000 prisoners to Porto. Napier described it as the most daring enterprise by any partisan force during the entire war. Some of the French officers who were taken prisoner prepared a letter, printed in an appendix by Napier, in which they defended his humanitarian treatment of the prisoners despite some atrocities committed by a few of his men. 
In some respects Trant was ideally suited to lead the Portuguese troops. He was given to derring-do, but he was a steadying influence on his troops, who continued to improve under his guidance despite the handicap that he was always short of money. He seemed to exercise more authority over his troops than the Portuguese officers. In October 1811 the Portuguese government conferred on him the title of knight commander of the Tower and Sword. Both Fortescue and Oman included substantial references to his frequent brilliant accomplishments. In April 1812 he executed a ruse that prevented two French divisions from storming Almeida. He dressed many of his men in red coats, made them visible around the fortress, and at night built many bivouac fires to simulate bodies of British troops. This was convincing enough to cause Marmont to withdraw his forces for a time. On 13 April he was at Guarda with 6000 militia, and had a plan for surprising Marmont in his quarters at Sabugal; but on that night he himself narrowly escaped being surprised by Marmont in Guarda. Wellington, while praising his action in the emergency, warned him not to be too venturesome with such troops as his. 
In 1813 fresh difficulties were raised about his drawing pay as a staff corps officer while in the Portuguese service. He obtained leave to go to England, and Wellington wrote strongly in support of his claim, expressing once more his appreciation of Trant's services and merits, and stating that he had been employed in a most important situation for the expenses of which his allowances were by no means adequate. He seems to have had no further part in the war. He had a bullet in his side, from which he suffered much for the rest of his life. He was transferred from the staff corps to the Portuguese service list on 25 October 1814, and received a brevet majority on 6 June 1815: scant reward for services so often praised. He was placed on half pay on 25 December 1816, and he resigned his half pay and left the army altogether in 1825. In May 1818, in financial difficulties, he had asked Wellington to write on his behalf to the king of Portugal; but Wellington replied to Beresford that it would be an indelicacy. Trant died on 16 October 1839 at Great Baddow, Essex, where his son-in-law, John Bramston, was vicar.

Trapp, John (1601-1669), Church of England clergyman and writer on theology, was born at Croome d'Abitot, Worcestershire, on 5 June 1601, the son of Nicholas Trapp, yeoman of Kemsey. He was educated at the free school in Worcester and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 15 October 1619 and graduated BA in 1622. John Ley, later a colleague in Warwickshire, was one of his tutors. On graduation Trapp became usher of the free school in Stratford upon Avon (where an older kinsman, Simon Trapp, was already curate), succeeding as headmaster in April 1624. Having proceeded MA on 17 June, twelve days later he married Mary Gibbard at Holy Trinity, Stratford; the couple had a large family of at least ten children. 
Trapp was preacher at the Stratford chapelry of Luddington in the early 1630s with a salary provided by Edward Conway, second Lord Conway, and in 1636 was presented to the vicarage of Weston-on-Avon, Gloucestershire (2 miles from Stratford), by Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex. His first publication, 'God's Love Tokens and the Afflicted Man's Lessons' (1637), was a funeral sermon for Cranfield's daughter. Trapp was active in south Warwickshire puritan circles in the 1630s, discussing sermons and exchanging manuscripts with Samuel Clarke, Thomas Dugard, and others. He joined in the petitioning against the Laudian innovations in 1640, and acted as a chaplain to the parliamentary garrison in Warwick Castle under Colonel John Bridges from 1644 to 1646. In May 1646 he claimed in a letter to friends in New England that he had been held to ransom by royalists in the summer of 1643 and threatened again in the following year. He was contemptuous of his beleaguered royalist patron, denouncing Middlesex from the pulpit of another Cranfield living, Welford-on-Avon, where Trapp had replaced the royalist incumbent. But Trapp was no radical: rather he was committed to a reformed national church and signed the Warwickshire ministers' 'Testimony' against sectarianism and religious liberty in 1648. In 1654-5 he was among the Warwickshire ministers who operated a semi-formal classis centred on Kenilworth. 
Trapp's supreme achievement as a writer was his commentaries on all the books of the 'Bible', issued in parts and then combined editions from the mid-1640s to the 1660s. 'A Brief Commentary upon the Gospel According to St John' inaugurated the series in 1646, while 'Annotations upon the Old and New Testament' (five volumes in one) completed it in 1662. The many surviving copies suggest that this voluminous and mostly uncontroversial work was a useful reference tool for contemporary clergy in particular. Its topical references to writings against sectarianism and other mid-century polemic did not prevent several reprints being issued in the later seventeenth century and a further edition in the mid-nineteenth. 
Trapp was one of the alternative candidates suggested by Richard Baxter when he turned down a bishopric in 1660. Although he lost the Welford living when the previous incumbent returned at the Restoration, Trapp conformed in 1662 and continued to serve at Weston and Stratford. He seems to have accommodated himself to the religious changes of his life with little difficulty, changing the dedicatees in the various editions of his published works to chime with the vagaries of power: he honoured Cranfield before the civil war, Bridges in the 1640s and 1650s, and royalist gentry in the 1660s. Trapp died on 17 October 1669 and was buried at Weston. He was described by his neighbour John Hall, who treated him for melancholy in 1635, as being 'for his piety and learning second to none' (Lane, 344). To his friend Thomas Dugard, in a commendatory verse to Trapp's 'Commentary on the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses', he was 'One of this Age's Greatest Little Men': small in stature, yet an imposing religious writer.

Trapp, Joseph (1679-1747), Church of England clergyman and writer, was born at Cherrington, Gloucestershire, in November 1679, the second son of Joseph Trapp (1638-1698), rector of Cherrington from 1662, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was the grandson of John Trapp (1601-1669), a parliamentary chaplain. One of six surviving children he was baptized on 18 December 1679 at Cherrington. Educated at first by his father and later at New College School in Oxford, he matriculated on 14 July 1695 at Wadham College, Oxford, where he held a Goodridge exhibition from 1695 to 1700. Elected to a scholarship in 1696 he graduated BA on 22 April 1699 and MA on 19 May 1702. He became a fellow of Wadham in 1703. His early reputation was that of a minor poet: some Latin hexameters, 'Fraus nummi Anglicani' (1696), appeared in the 'Musae Anglicanae' (2.211), and his work was included in Oxford verse collections commemorating the duke of Gloucester (died 1700) and William III (died 1702). During this time Trapp developed a connection with the London theatre world; his anonymous 'Prologue to the University of Oxford', delivered at the Act in July 1703, was spoken by Thomas Betterton, and his Turkish tragedy, 'Abramule, or, Love and Empire', which was first performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1704, secured lasting critical acclaim. In 1708 he became the first professor of poetry at Oxford and in 1709 he served as pro-proctor. His appointment to the poetry chair, which he held until 1718, gave 'great satisfaction [to] the whole university', according to Thomas Hearne, the diarist, who regarded him as 'a most ingenious honest gent. and every ways deserving' ('Remarks', 2.120). Opinion was divided on the merit of Trapp's lectures, which were mainly concerned with the classical poets, particularly those of Rome. Hearne thought that the first lecture, delivered in January 1711, displayed 'much conceit' but others found Trapp's criticisms 'sound and clear' ('N&Q', 2nd ser., 11.194). The lectures were well attended and their original Latin text, 'Praelectiones poeticae' (3 vols., 1711-19), was reissued in translation, with additional notes, in 1742. However, Trapp's greatest literary endeavour, a translation into blank verse of the complete works of Virgil (1731), was less successful. Accurate but dull it deserved Dr Johnson's verdict that it 'may continue its existence as long as it is the clandestine refuge of schoolboys' (Johnson, 1.453), although the merit of its explanatory notes and critical observations brought the work to a fourth edition in 1737. Another epic undertaking, 'Paradisus amissus Latine redditus', published by Trapp at his own expense, in two volumes (1741-4), proved a costly failure. 
Among his contemporaries Trapp was noted less for his literary endeavours than as a political writer and as a churchman. From an early age he manifested combative high-church qualities inherited from his father, whose epitaph at Cherrington recorded him thus: '
schismaticis... insensus 

Disciplinae fideique ecclesiae Anglicanae tenax. 
('GM', 381)' In 1701 he dedicated a flattering poem, 'Aedes Badmintoniae', to the high tory Henry Somerset, second duke of Beaufort, and at about the same time he became a friend of the high-church champion Dr Henry Sacheverell. This association endured for many years. Trapp acted as a manager for Sacheverell during his celebrated trial before the House of Lords in Westminster Hall in March 1710 and afterwards succeeded him in his lectureship in the parish of Newington, Surrey. Trapp used his talent as a pamphleteer on Sacheverell's behalf more than once with, for example, 'An Ordinary Journey No Progress, or, A Man doing his Own Business No mover of Sedition' (1710) and 'The case of the patron and rector of St Andrew's, Houlbourn, in answer to a pamphlet entitled, The case of the erectors of a chapel... in the said parish' (1722). When Sacheverell died, in 1724, Trapp inherited the greater part of his library, together with a legacy of $200 and instructions to destroy most of his papers. 
Trapp's polemical energies were frequently employed on behalf of the tory administration that came to power in 1710, following Sacheverell's trial. Pamphlets, such as 'Most Faults on One Side' (1710) and 'The True Genuine Tory-Address, and the True Genuine Whig-Address, Set Against one another' (1710), drew responses. As chaplain to the new lord chancellor of Ireland, Sir Constantine Phipps, the leading counsel for Dr Sacheverell at his trial, Trapp followed him to Dublin in 1711, where he generated controversy with a high-flying sermon on Restoration day, 29 May. In the same year he addressed a poem 'To Mr Harley, on his First Appearing in Publick, after the Wound Given him by Guiscard', and published a satirical pamphlet, 'The Character and Principles of the Present Set of Whigs'. Although Swift thought this 'a very scurvy piece' (Swift, 269), it reached a third edition in 1712, by which time Swift was claiming credit for having secured the post of chaplain to Viscount Bolingbroke for Trapp, who was said to be 'mighty happy and thankfull for it' (ibid., 550). In 1713 Bolingbroke received the dedication of Trapp's poem 'Peace'. This partisan celebration of the treaty of Utrecht served primarily as a vehicle for a collection of eulogistic portraits of the tory leaders; Swift thought it 'dull' (ibid., 650n.). 
Trapp shared his party's disappointment at the accession of George I. He played a leading part in the tory counter-demonstration at Oxford on coronation day, 20 October 1714, when he presented Sir Constantine Phipps, his former patron, for the honorary degree of DCL, but afterwards concentrated on his ecclesiastical career. Having failed to become a lecturer in the high-church parish of St Clement Danes, London, in November 1712, he became lecturer of St Olave Jewry and of St Martin, Ironmonger Lane, in 1714, and lecturer of St Martin-in-the-Fields in 1715. He was presented by the earl of Peterborough to the rectory of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, in 1714, and exchanged this for the London parishes of Christ Church Greyfriars and St Leonard, Foster Lane, in 1722 on the presentation of the high tory governors of St Bartholomew's Hospital. He held this appointment until his death, in 1747, adding to it, in 1733, the rectory of Harlington, Middlesex, a living in the gift of Lord Bolingbroke. 
Trapp was a devout and energetic minister. He officiated unfailingly at public daily prayers and was noted for his strict adherence to correct standards of clerical dress. As 'little Parson 'Dapper'' his accomplished pulpit manner earned him an honourable mention in 'The Tatler' (1.457) and he was frequently invited to preach on major occasions, such as before the lord mayor, the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy, and the charity schools of London and Westminster. He dedicated a tract, entitled 'Duties of Private, Domestic, and Public Devotion', to his parishioners at Dauntsey, and presented every member of his London congregations with a copy of 'Thoughts upon the Four Last Things: Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell, a Poem' (1734-5; 3rd edn, 1749). In this latter work Trapp indicated the sense of urgency with which he had come to regard his pastoral vocation and commented: 'I have lived in six reigns, but for about twenty years past, the English nation has been so prodigiously debauched that I am almost a foreigner in my own country' ('Advertisement'). His epitaph included the arresting lines: '
Death! Judgment! Heaven! Hell! think, Christian, think! 

You stand on vast Eternity's dread Brink! 

' and concluded with the earnest hope that his flock might 'Hear me at least, oh! hear me from my grave'. After his death a selection of Trapp's parochial sermons were published in a two-volume edition (1752), which afforded further evidence of his efforts to guard his flock against the enticements of both overt and concealed infidelity. Anxious in particular to repudiate deistical claims that a mere 'religion of Nature' furnished a sufficient guide for conduct Trapp condemned the 'absurd presumption' of 'our new 'Philosophers'', whose 'short-sighted 'Reason'' blinded them to the 'Glory of God in his Works of Creation and Providence' (Trapp, 'Sermons', 1.xi-xii). He also wrote sadly about those who 'make no other Use of Flowers, Herbs, Fruits and Animals, than to see, smell, and eat them; when, if due Reflection were made upon them, they would serve to the noblest Purposes of... Morality' (ibid., 266). In 1729 and 1730 he gave the lectures on Lady Moyer's foundation, published as 'The Doctrine of the most Holy, and Ever-Blessed Trinity, Briefly Stated and Proved', and his 'Explanatory Notes upon the Four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles' (2 vols., 1747-8) were reprinted in 1775 and 1805. 
Throughout his life Trapp remained a strong high-churchman who exemplified all the characteristics of his party. Ever mindful of the experience of the church during the civil war, and the Commonwealth and protectorate that followed, he revered the memory of Charles I and deplored his 'most horrid Murder and Parricide' (Trapp, 'Sermons', 22). He sympathized with some of the nonjurors, particularly Roger Laurence, author of 'Lay Baptism Invalid', whom he presented at Oxford for an honorary MA in 1713 ('Remarks', 4.212). Believing that the Church of England was a divinely commissioned part of the church catholic Trapp repudiated the Erastian doctrines advanced by Benjamin Hoadly, bishop of Bangor, and noted pointedly that 'in the Primitive Church some of the most noted Heresiarchs were Bishops' ('The Real Nature of the Church or Kingdom of Christ', 1717, 5). Using texts such as 'Numbers' 16 and 'Hebrews' 5: 4 he maintained a high notion of the divine authority of the regularly constituted ministry and lamented that the 'temporal condition of Spiritual Persons, and of their families... is, upon the whole, very hard and unequal'. This he believed was a consequence of 'unconscionable pillage' during the Reformation ('The Dignity and Benefit of the Priesthood', 1721, 28, 43). He regarded the dissenters, who had no regular ministerial succession, as dangerous schismatics and attacked plans to comprehend them within the Church of England as 'absurd' and 'wicked' ('A Preservative Against Unsettled Notions, and Want of Principles in Religion', 1715, xix). In the late 1730s, predictably, Trapp was deeply alarmed by the emergence of the Methodists, whom he likened to the Puritans of the 1640s. In his best-remembered work, 'The Nature, Folly, Sin and Danger, of being Righteous over-much', which went through four editions in 1739, Trapp attacked the mortifications practised by the followers of George Whitefield, who responded, along with others, including William Law and the anonymous author of the satirical 'Dr Trapp Vindicated from the Imputation of being a Christian'. Trapp was undeterred and returned to the charge. In an assize sermon preached at Oxford, entitled 'The Nature, Usefulness and Regulation of Religious Zeal' (1739), he glanced slightingly at Law: 'to eat nothing but bread and herbs, and drink nothing but water, unless there be a particular reason for it, is folly at best' (p. 7). This sermon was received with marked respect by the vice-chancellor, Dr Theophilus Leigh, who 'stood up all the time of his preaching... to manifest his high sense of so respectable a character' ('GM', 660). A further piece, 'The true spirit of the Methodists and their allies (whether other enthusiasts, papists, deists, Quakers, or atheists) fully laid open' (1740), provided a comprehensive response to Trapp's antagonists, including Whitefield, who was accused of 'Quakerism, Enthusiastic Madness and Malice' (26), and Law, whose 'Grounds and Reasons of Christian Regeneration' was dismissed as an 'Enthusiastical Rhapsody' (p. 38). In common with other high-churchmen Trapp was also a decided critic of the Roman Catholic church. He published 'Popery Truly Stated, and Briefly Confuted' (1726; 3rd edn, 1745) in response to 'the late unusual Growth of Popery' (p. 2); it rehearsed familiar arguments in favour of private judgement, as guided by scripture, and against papal supremacy, novel doctrines, and superstitious practices. This work, together with 'The Church of England defended against the calumnies and false reasonings of the church of Rome' (1727), a response to 'England's Conversion and Reformation Compar'd' by the Catholic controversialist Robert Manning, secured for Trapp the degree of DD by diploma at Oxford in February 1728. 
In person Trapp was 'of a middle stature, slender habit, olive complexion, and a countenance of uncommon openness and animation' ('GM', 383). The three-quarter-length portrait presented to the Bodleian Library in 1755 was considered an excellent likeness. He was naturally irascible but made efforts to control his temper when provoked, 'compressing his lips as he retired, like a true Christian philosopher'. Although it was said that he 'studied harder than any man in England' he could be diverted in convivial company; one memorialist recalled 'his giving us the good old song of 'Celebrate this Festival & c', for which, even in an advanced age, he was not ill-qualified, by the possession of an agreeable tenor-base voice' (ibid., 384). He married, on 7 December 1714, 'Mrs White, a young Girl of about 18 years of age, Daughter of a Widdow in Oxford' ('Remarks', 5.4), with whom he had two sons. The first, Henry, for whom Lord Bolingbroke stood godfather, died in infancy. The second, Joseph (died 1769), became a fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1734 and rector of Stratfield Saye in Hampshire. 
Trapp died at Harlington, of pleurisy, on 22 November 1747 and was buried in the parish church there, at the north side of the entry into the chancel, where he is commemorated by a monument. Another monument, engraved as the frontispiece to the second volume of his 'Sermons' (1752), was erected on the east wall of the chancel of Christ Church Greyfriars and paid for by the parishioners.

Travers, Benjamin (1783-1858), surgeon, was born on 3 April 1783, the son of Benjamin Travers and his wife, Mary, a daughter of the Revd Francis Spilsbury. After receiving a classical education at the grammar school of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, he was taught privately until at the age of sixteen he was placed in his father's counting-house. He soon found commerce uncongenial, and, as his father frequently attended the lectures of the surgeons Henry Cline and Astley Paston Cooper, Travers was articled to Cooper in August 1800 for a term of six years, as his first pupil, residing in his house. During the last year of his apprenticeship Travers gave occasional private demonstrations on anatomy to his fellow pupils and established a clinical society, meeting weekly, of which he was the secretary. 
Travers was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1806 and spent the following session at Edinburgh. He returned to London at the end of 1807, and settled at New Court, St Swithin's Lane. He was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at Guy's Hospital, and, with his father's business in decline, he obtained the appointment in 1809 of surgeon to the East India Company's warehouses and brigade; he retained the post until 1814. Also in 1809 he married Sarah, daughter of William Morgan (1750-1833), actuary. Following her death, he married in 1813 Caroline Millet, whose father was an East India Company director. 
Travers succeeded Astley Cooper at the London Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye (later Moorfields Eye Hospital), developing its resources as a teaching institution centre, with many students from England and abroad. Travers was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1813, and he was elected surgeon to St Thomas's Hospital, London, in 1815. He retained the post of surgeon to the eye infirmary until 1816. Astley Cooper moved, in the same year, and Travers took over his house at 3 New Broad Street and soon acquired a fair share of practice. At this time Travers suffered so much from palpitation of the heart that he discontinued his clinical lectures, and in 1819 he resigned his joint lectureship on surgery with Astley Cooper, though he again began to lecture upon surgery in 1834 in conjunction with Frederick Tyrell, at St Thomas's Hospital. Travers was chosen president of the Hunterian Society in 1827, and in the same year he acted as president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. His third marriage, in 1831, was to Mary Poulett, youngest daughter of Colonel Stevens of Somerset. 
Travers filled all the important offices at the Royal College of Surgeons. He was elected a member of the council in 1830; Hunterian orator in 1838; examiner in surgery from 1841 to 1858; chairman of the board of midwifery examiners in 1855; vice-president in the years 1845, 1846, 1854, and 1855; and president in 1847 and 1856. He was a member of the veterinary examining committee in 1833. He was appointed surgeon to Queen Victoria in 1837 and to Prince Albert in 1840. 
Travers followed other leading surgeons of the day in adopting the technique of cataract surgery by lens extraction, devised by Jacques Deviel in 1745. These men raised the status of optical surgery from the condition of quackery to which untrained oculists and quacks had brought it. Travers's 'Synopsis of the Diseases of the Eye and their Treatment' (1820), one of the earliest systematic treatises in English, went through three English editions, an Italian translation in 1823, and an American edition in 1825. Travers was also a good pathologist, inheriting the best traditions of the Hunterian school, for he worked upon an experimental basis. He died at his house in Green Street, Grosvenor Square, London, on 6 March 1858, and was buried at Hendon in Middlesex. Travers had a large family and his eldest son, Benjamin Travers, followed him in the medical profession.

Travers, Sir Eaton Stannard (1782-1858), naval officer, was the third son of John Travers of Hethyfield Grange, co. Cork, Ireland (where he was born) and his wife, Mehetabel, the only daughter of John Colthurst of Dripsey Castle, co. Cork. He entered the navy in September 1798 on the 'Juno' in the North Sea, where during the following year he was on boat service along the Netherlands coast. He was similarly employed in the West Indies during 1800-01. In March 1802 he was moved to the 'Elephant', and in October 1803 to the 'Hercule', the flagship of Sir John Thomas Duckworth. In November, while Duckworth remained at Jamaica, the 'Hercule' was attached to the squadron under Commodore Loring blockading Cap Francais. On 30 November, when the French ships agreed to surrender, Travers was with Lieutenant Nisbet Josiah Willoughby in the launch which took possession of the 'Clorinde' after she had got on shore, and claimed to have been the chief agent in saving the ship by swimming to the shore and so making fast a hawser, by which the frigate was hauled off the rocks. In January and February 1804 he was again with Willoughby in the advance battery at the siege of Curacao, and was afterwards publicly thanked by the admiral for his bravery. On 23 September 1804 Travers was promoted lieutenant and to command the schooner 'Ballahou', but in February 1805, on her being ordered to Newfoundland, he was appointed to the 'Surveillante', in which again he saw sharp boat service on the Spanish main. 
In 1806 the 'Hercule' returned to England, and in December Travers was appointed to the frigate 'Alcmene' off the coast of France, until she was wrecked off the mouth of the Loire on 29 April 1809. He was afterwards in the 'Imperieuse', on the Walcheren expedition, and in 1810 in the Mediterranean, where for the next four years he was engaged in minor operations against the coasting vessels and coast batteries along the shores of France and Italy. He was repeatedly recommended by his captains and the commander-in-chief for his zeal, activity, and gallantry, but it was not until 15 June 1814 that he received the often-earned promotion to commander. He is said to have been upwards of 100 times engaged with the enemy; to have been in command at the blowing up and destruction of eight batteries and three Martello towers; and to have taken part in the capture of about sixty vessels, eighteen or twenty of them armed, and several cut out from under batteries. 
The 'Imperieuse' was paid off in September 1814. In April 1815 Travers married Anne Palmer, the eldest daughter of William Steward of Great Yarmouth; they had five sons and two daughters. He remained unemployed until the summer of 1828, when he was appointed to command the 'Rose' (18 guns). From her he was advanced to post rank on 19 November 1829, mainly, it would seem, at the desire of the duke of Clarence. The latter, who knew of his long and active war service, later, as William IV, made him a KH (4 February 1834) and knighted him on 5 March 1834. Travers had no further employment afloat; he became rear-admiral on the retired list on 9 July 1855, and died at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 4 March 1858. He was a brave and resourceful amphibious officer who achieved belated recognition.

Travers, James (1820-1884), army officer, was born in Cork on 6 October 1820, the third son of Major-General Sir Robert Travers KCMG CB (died 1834) of the 10th foot. After Addiscombe College he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Bengal infantry on 11 June 1838. He arrived at Fort William, Calcutta, on 12 January 1839, and served with the 57th native infantry at Barrackpore until posted to the 2nd native infantry at Ferozepore on 12 April 1839. 
Travers served with his regiment in the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1841 and 1842, was repeatedly in action, and was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted first lieutenant on 7 June 1841. He served with Nott's army and returned to Ferozepore on 23 December 1842. For his war service he was recommended for a brevet majority on attaining the rank of captain. 
Travers returned to regimental duty in March 1843, and was appointed adjutant of the Bhopal contingent on 15 March. He was promoted captain on 7 January 1846, and brevet major the following day. In the same month he joined the army of the Sutlej. He commanded a Masiri battalion of Gurkhas in Sir Harry Smith's division at the battle of Sobraon on 10 February 1846, and was mentioned in dispatches. On 24 March 1846 he was appointed second in command of the Bhopal contingent. On 19 November 1849 he married, in India, Mary Isabella (1829/30-1933), daughter of Donald Macintyre, founder of the Macintyre merchant firm in Calcutta. She was the sister of General Donald Macintyre VC; her elder sister married William Brydon, the only survivor of the retreat from Kabul in 1842. 
On 13 February 1850 Travers became postmaster at Sehore, on 20 June 1854 he was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel, on 22 August 1855 was appointed officiating commandant, and on 15 February 1856 commandant, of the Bhopal contingent. In this year he commanded a force in the field against Sankar Sing, and received the thanks of government. On 6 December 1856 he was promoted colonel. 
After the outbreak of the Indian mutiny in 1857 Travers moved in the middle of June from Bhopal to Indore, where Colonel Henry Marion Durand was the resident, and assumed command of the forces there. On 1 July some of Holkar's troops mutinied, and thirty-nine people were massacred. Travers, uncertain of his own men, nevertheless no sooner heard the guns than he formed up the picket where they could most advantageously charge the guns of the mutineers, and at once ordered them to advance. Gallantly leading them, he drove away the gunners, wounded Saadat Khan, the inciter of the mutiny, and for a few moments had the guns in his possession. But he found only five men had followed him, and, as they were completely exposed to a galling infantry fire, he was obliged to retire. The charge, however, by creating a favourable diversion, not only enabled Durand to place the residency guns in position and to make some hurried arrangements for defence, but allowed many persons to escape to the residency. Travers opened fire from the residency guns, but his cavalry were leaving him, and his efforts to induce his infantry to charge were unavailing. The women and children were therefore placed on gun-carriages, and, covered by the cavalry -- which, though willing to follow Travers, would not fight for him -- the little band moved out of the residency, and arrived at Sehore on 4 July. For his bravery in charging the guns on 1 July, which Durand brought to notice in his dispatches, Travers was awarded the Victoria Cross on 1 March 1861. 
Travers returned to duty with his old regiment, the 2nd native infantry, in 1858. On 8 September 1860 he was appointed commandant of the Central India horse, on 25 October 1861 brigadier-general commanding Saugor district, on 23 July 1865 he was promoted major-general, and the same year received a good-service pension. He was given the command of the Meerut division on 5 August 1869, was promoted lieutenant-general on 5 February 1873, and was made a CB, military division, on 24 May 1873. Travers was permitted on 3 July 1874 to reside out of India. He was promoted to be general on 1 October 1877, and was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list on 1 July 1881. He published in 1876 'The Evacuation of Indore', to refute statements in J. W. Kaye's 'History of the Sepoy War'. He died at Pallanza, Lago Maggiore, Italy, on 1 April 1884. His widow survived to the age of 103.

John Travers (1549/50-1620). John became a demy at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1567, aged seventeen, and was a fellow of the college from 1569 to 1585. He graduated BA there on 23 October 1570 and proceeded MA on 19 May 1574. Like his elder brother he took orders, though apparently in a more orthodox manner, and also like him was frequently at odds with the church establishment. In 1575 he was involved in disputes over the election of a new college president, while in 1578 he was summoned before the high commission. He became friendly with the second earl of Bedford, being granted six months' leave of absence from Magdalen in April 1576 in order to stay with the earl. Bedford was a pillar of the godly in the south-west, and it was doubtless through his influence that Travers became active in the diocese of Exeter. In 1585 he was suspended for proclaiming unauthorized fasts there, and in 1600 he was among the ministers denounced by Bishop Cotton for their puritan tendencies. Cotton's complaint implies that Travers had no benefice; in 1601, however, he was vicar of Landrake in Cornwall. Four years later he was a leading figure in the resistance to Archbishop Bancroft's drive for conformity. John Travers died in 1620 as rector of Farringdon in Devon. He had married Alice, sister of Richard Hooker, and they had four sons, all of whom took orders.

Travers, John (1703?-1758), organist and composer, was the son of Joseph Travers, shoemaker, of Windsor. He probably sang in the choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor, and in 1719 was apprenticed to the organist and composer Maurice Greene. He also studied with John Christopher Pepusch, whose friend he became and to part of whose musical library he succeeded on Pepusch's death in 1752 (the music has not been traced since it was sold in 1766). On 24 November 1726 Travers was appointed organist of St Paul's, Covent Garden, and was later also organist of Fulham church. On 10 May 1737 he succeeded Jonathan Martin as one of the organists of the Chapel Royal. His pupils included William Jackson of Exeter. He wrote much church music, including 'The Whole Book of Psalms' ('c'.1750). His anthem 'Ascribe unto the Lord' was much anthologized and remained in use throughout the nineteenth century. His secular compositions included 'Eighteen Canzonets' which enjoyed much popularity in their day. Travers died in London in June 1758, when William Boyce succeeded to his post at the Chapel Royal.

Travers, Rebecca (c.1609-1688), Quaker preacher and writer, was the daughter of a Baptist. She married William Travers, a tobacconist at the Three Feathers, Watling Street, London, who died in 1664. She had been 'a reader of the Scriptures from a child of six' (Sewel, 2.329). Attending the Baptist church in Broad Street, where James Nayler, the Quaker leader, was holding a dispute, she was astonished to see 'the Countryman [who] stood up on a Form over against the Baptists and they were so far from getting victory that she could hear his words smote them' (Travers, 18). She was converted to the Quakers by Nayler after a dinner party where she was moved by his attack on 'forbidden knowledge', and she later claimed to renounce all intellectual pretensions. After Nayler's punishment and humiliation she dressed his wounds, and at his release from prison in 1659 he stayed at her house; she wrote a 'certificate' on his behalf to parliament. 
Travers became a leading woman preacher in London, sometimes preaching in the streets and suffering several imprisonments -- often for defending Quaker prisoners in her role as prison visitor in London and Ipswich. She acted both as host and minister at the 'six weeks meetings' held at her own house. The leader of the Quakers' women's meeting in London, she issued 'A Woman's Paper for Order' to stop gossip and backbiting. She attended at the 'second day morning meeting', the editorial board for Quaker publications. The conducting of Quaker marriages and care for poor Friends were also part of her duties. In her 'unsuitable great house' Travers hosted visiting preachers such as George Whitehead, the Quaker leader, in 1664, and also George Fox: 'I was never better pleased with my house then when hee was in it' (Swarthmore MSS, 1.395). 
Travers was the author of ten separate pamphlets as well as some postscripts and testimonies attached to others' writings: 'One Rebecca Trewish in Watling streit is a wryter of books and gets them prented by Widow Dover' ('CSP dom.', '1664-5', 148). Adept equally at polemics and theology, she wrote for those both within and outside Quaker society. She directed her quill especially against apostate brethren; in 'The Harlot's Vail Rent' (1669) she accused Elizabeth Atkinson of betrayal for inverting Quaker language to attack her former colleagues. Others were attacked for interfering with Friends or denying their principles ('For those that... Worship at... John Evangelist', 1659). In 'A Testimony Concerning the Life and Light of Jesus' (1663) she expounded the Quaker concern for 'inner' life and preached renunciation of earthly power and conflict. Often she rebutted other pamphleteers, but she also took on the government for enforcing the 'Conformity Act' ('This is for All... that Resist the Spirit', 1664). Later in life she wrote 'testimonies' for Quakers such as William Bayly (1676), Susanne Whitrow (1677), Alice Curwen (1680), and Anne Whitehead (1686). 
Travers tried to reconcile the factions that developed between the followers of Fox and John Perrot, an antinomian, who denied all forms of worship. Her own sister Mary Booth became an adherent of Perrot. Travers wrote using feminine imagery: 'My dear Brethren and Sisters... all drawing from the one Breast the milk of the Word... for the Coat of the Lord is seamless' ('Testimony', 10). Later she assured Fox that she wished only for unity among the Quakers. She wrote to him to clear herself of having worked to 'strengthen that Spirit of Gainsaying' (Travers to Fox, 17 Aug 1676, Gibson MS 8ii.335/119). 
Throughout, Travers believed in the primacy of faith over institutions, but she worked within those institutions for unity among Friends. Accused of self-aggrandizement -- 'being a Great Mother and Governess' -- she presented herself instead as 'a servant to this people' (Mack, 320) and defended Fox's party to maintain unity in the face of persecution. 
Travers died, aged about seventy-nine, on 15 June 1688 in London. She was survived by a son, Matthew, and at least one daughter. Her funeral sermon was preached by William Penn in 1688.

Travers, Walter (1548?-1635), religious activist and college head, was born in Nottingham, the eldest child of Walter, a goldsmith, and his wife, Anne, who also had three younger sons and a daughter. His father's will suggests that he was both well off, and (assuming that he wrote the will himself) a committed protestant. The oldest of Walter's brothers, Robert, became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, published theological works, and died in Geneva in 1575; his two youngest brothers, John ['see below'] and Humfrey, both became ministers in the Church of England. Like Robert, Walter was educated at Cambridge, matriculating as a member of Christ's College in 1560, but soon transferring to Trinity, where he was chosen, along with Thomas Cartwright, who was a fellow, to present a formal address to Queen Elizabeth on her famous visit to the university in 1564. Travers graduated BA in 1565-6, was elected a junior fellow of Trinity in 1567, proceeded MA on 25 March 1569, and in the same year was made a senior fellow. 
At this stage Travers seemed set for further academic honours, ordination, and a clerical career. But in 1570 he gave up his fellowship and left England for Geneva, driven out because of his puritan views. John Whitgift, appointed master of Trinity in 1567 to restore order there, commented that he had forced Travers to leave Cambridge by repeated disciplinary procedures, 'other wise he should have been expelled for his want of conformity towards the house and for his pertinancy' (Strype, 3.507). 
As with John Knox and countless other religious immigrants, Geneva provided Travers with both a refuge and a model for the ideal Christian polity. Joined there by his brother Robert and by Thomas Cartwright, who shared their puritan views, he became a friend of Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor as leader of the Genevan reformation. And it was in Geneva that he wrote his major work, 'Ecclesiasticae disciplinae et Anglicanae ecclesiae ab illa aberrationis, plena e verbo Dei, et dilucida explicatio'. In 1574 this was published anonymously and under a false imprint by Cartwright, who was then at Heidelberg, with a preface by him endorsing its contents. An English translation was published in the same year, also at Heidelberg. The book was closely based on Calvin's system of ecclesiastical government: for both Calvin and Travers, the church of the 'New Testament' was normative; the duty of the theologian was merely to identify its structure and apply it to contemporary circumstances. It was in this last respect that Travers's originality lay, for he subtly adapted Calvin's biblical model to an English context. In order to undermine the diocesan episcopate of the English church, Travers started off with an examination of the role of bishops in the 'New Testament', showing that they were not part of a separate hierarchy with authority over other clergy, but merely ministers of local congregations. He also differed from Calvin in identifying elders as a type of deacon, rather than a separate kind of minister. Significantly, in view of the later travails of the presbyterians under Elizabeth, Travers did not deal with the crucial issue of the relationship between a presbyterian church and a hostile state. 
After the publication of his account of ecclesiastical discipline Travers tested the waters in England again in 1576, returning to have his degree of MA incorporated in Oxford University. But preferment in England was not forthcoming and he had to follow the familiar puritan path to the Netherlands, where in April 1578 he secured a position as chaplain to the English Merchant Adventurers at Antwerp. It was here that he was ordained, not episcopally but according to the presbyterian fashion of the Dutch Calvinist church, by the laying on of hands by twelve ministers. The church in which he served had a wholly presbyterian structure and discipline, and Travers did not use the 'Book of Common Prayer', an omission challenged by the English governor of the Merchant Adventurers, Nicholas Loddington. The response, a severe reprimand for the governor by Sir Francis Walsingham and a further rebuke from William Davison, the English ambassador to the Netherlands, demonstrated what was to become a notable feature of Travers's career -- his close ties to influential courtiers of a Calvinist inclination. 
In July 1580 Travers again returned to England, to be succeeded in his post in Antwerp by Cartwright. He turned down the offer of a professorship in St Andrews from the Scottish presbyterian leader (and fellow Genevan exile) Andrew Melville, and became instead chaplain to Elizabeth's principal minister, Lord Burghley, and tutor to his son, Robert Cecil, later earl of Salisbury. This marked the beginning of a highly important relationship for Travers, as Burghley, always sympathetic to those of a more radical religious bent than himself, repeatedly used his influence to try to protect Travers. The question, of course, was how could an avowedly presbyterian minister find a niche in the episcopal Church of England? The answer was provided by Burghley who steered Travers towards the Temple Church, that curious foundation of the knights templar which served the spiritual needs of the barristers and students of the Inner and Middle Temples in London. In 1581 Travers secured the position of deputy to the frail master, Richard Alvey. Alvey and Travers got on well, sharing as they did similarly precise religious views, and Travers felt able to introduce some audacious changes, including not kneeling (or even sitting) but ambulatory communion, and an attempt to turn collectors and sidesmen into deacons and elders after the manner of Geneva. The benchers, however, proved far from enthusiastic about the innovations, and Travers had to moderate his ambitions. In 1583 he took the familiar path of puritan scholars anxious to ingratiate themselves with the authorities, by taking up anti-Catholic polemic, publishing 'An Answere to a Supplicatorie Epistle', a detailed attack upon a recent piece of Roman Catholic propaganda, replete with extensive scriptural references to prove that the Church of Rome was a false and heretical church. 
The appointment of Whitgift as archbishop of Canterbury in 1583 marked a decisive turning point for English puritans in general and Travers in particular. Determined to weed out nonconformists, Whitgift promulgated a set of fifteen articles with which he confronted the godly, offering them an impossible choice between subscription and suspension. The puritans used their influence at court to secure a two-day debate with Whitgift on the issue in December 1584, and Travers was selected as one of their two spokesmen. Unsurprisingly it achieved nothing. The archbishop's continuing dislike of Travers and his opinions was underlined in 1584, when on the death of Alvey Whitgift wrote to the queen to ensure that Burghley failed in his efforts to secure the succession for Travers: 'Travers hath been and is one of the chief and principal authors of dissension in this church, a contemner of the Book of Prayers, and of other orders by authority established; an earnest seeker of innovation; and either in no degree of the ministry at all, or else ordered beyond the seas... Whose placing in that room... would greatly animate the rest of that faction, and do very much harm in sundry respects. (Knox, 67)' The choice of Richard Hooker as master of the Temple in 1585 paved the way for a set-piece confrontation between the two wings of the English Reformation. In Fuller's much quoted words, 'the pulpit spake pure Canterbury in the morning and Geneva in the afternoon' (Fuller, 'Worthies', 1.264), although Richard Bauckham has argued that the main issue at stake, the status of the Church of Rome, did not in fact neatly fit into any simplistic distinction between puritanism and what would become Anglicanism. Finally in March 1586 Whitgift intervened, banning Travers from preaching. When Travers again sought to enlist Burghley's support, Whitgift reiterated his complaint that Travers's lack of episcopal ordination made him unfit for preferment in the Church of England. Travers, for his part, determinedly fought to regain his right to preach, continuing to live in the Temple until late 1586, and publishing in that year a self-justifying account of his dispute with Hooker, 'A Supplication Made to the Council'. 
Disappointed in their efforts to move the queen, Travers and his fellow puritan leaders decided in 1584-5 to change tactics and turned to direct action, seeking to establish a presbyterian structure within the Church of England as a kind of Trojan horse. It was a dangerous policy: not only did it inevitably arouse the deep hostility of Elizabeth, it also required the puritans to reach a consensus about a major issue on which they had so far proved unable to agree -- the precise form that presbyterian church discipline and government should take in England. It was to Travers that they turned to produce an agreed formula. It took a considerable time, but finally in 1587 there appeared 'Disciplina ecclesiae Dei verbo descripta', generally known as the 'Book of Discipline'. A relatively short constitution for an English presbyterian church, this was sent out to all the classes -- assemblies of ministers -- in England. 
Written or maybe just drafted by Travers, the book was divided into two parts, the first of which engaged in the familiar puritan task of ransacking the 'Bible' and outlining all the references it contained to church polity. The second and longer section set down more detailed rules for liturgy, worship, and church organization, based upon the models of the Scottish and mainland European presbyterian churches. The 'Book of Discipline' provided an alternative form of church government for England, with local classes choosing representatives for provincial synods, which would in turn select the men who would constitute the national synod. Travers published another self-explanatory title in 1588, a 'Defence of the Ecclesiastical Discipline'. In March 1588, after the death of John Field, the organizing genius of the presbyterian movement, Travers took over as corresponding secretary of the presbyterians in London. It was a difficult moment, for the authorities, led by Whitgift, were now determined to take action against the presbyterians, who had been weakened by the death in September of that crucial puritan patron the earl of Leicester. Finally in 1590 the presbyterian ringleaders were brought successively before the high commission and the Star Chamber and charged with seditiously attempting to undermine the queen's supreme authority in the church. Though held and questioned closely during 1591, the government released the presbyterian leaders after 1592, confident now that it had broken the presbyterian movement. 
It is mysterious that Travers was never arrested and imprisoned. He is known to have been in London in 1590, and Whitgift was certainly aware of his leading role in the movement, yet he remained at large. Clearly, however, he could not remain long in London. As the presbyterian leaders scattered to the remote corners of the land following their release, Travers again turned to Burghley for one last favour, and was again obliged. Burghley may have been powerless to protect the presbyterians from the Star Chamber in London, but he was still highly influential in Ireland, and he found sanctuary there for Travers in the newly founded university of Trinity College, Dublin. Burghley had been instrumental in establishing the college, and his client, Archbishop Adam Loftus of Dublin, had been its first, albeit temporary, provost. He was succeeded on 5 June 1594 by Travers. 
Travers, who had strong views on the religious role of universities, surrounded himself in Trinity by such like-minded puritans as Humphrey Fen, and decisively shaped the new university's theology -- and probably the theological education of its most notable early graduate, James Ussher -- in a Calvinist way. It would be wrong, though, to see Travers as constructing another presbyterian Trojan horse in Dublin: in an address to the new provost Loftus had publicly warned him against introducing dangerous dissensions into the Irish church. Apart from teaching, much of Travers's time was taken up with securing sufficient money to ensure Trinity's survival, a task made especially difficult by the intensification of the Nine Years' War (1594-1603). In October 1598, with the situation in both the college and the country looking increasingly bleak, he gave up the provostship and departed for England. 
Travers must have had hopes of further preferment, since he secured a letter of recommendation from the Dublin authorities praising his efforts as provost and pointedly emphasizing that he had avoided religious contention during his time in Dublin and was worthy of being allowed to resume his ministry in England. But it was not to be. Though he lived on into the reign of Charles I, Travers never gained another post. Instead he passed the remainder of his life in retirement, appearing occasionally in puritan circles, as in 1604 when his name was mentioned as a possible representative at the Hampton Court conference, or in 1610 when he was noted as preaching without a licence at All Saints' Church, Hereford. His last public statement was his book 'Vindiciae ecclesiae Anglicanae', which appeared in 1630 and sought to defend the protestant church of England against the Roman Catholic threat. Travers died in 1635, some time between making his will on 14 January and its being proved ten days later. In it he distributed his assets in cash (amounting to $351) among his nieces and nephews, along with bequests to support students at Trinity College, Dublin, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and to pay for a preacher at Sion College, London. 
Among the beneficiaries of Walter Travers's will were the sons of his younger brother 
Although Walter Travers exerted a considerable influence on the development of English presbyterianism, decisively tying the movement to the strict position that their Calvinist framework was the sole biblical church polity, and seeking to Anglicize the presbyterian system of church government, he signally failed in his major aim -- to create an established presbyterian church in England. Indeed, his main achievement was probably, and ironically, his role as the irritant that may have stimulated Hooker to produce one of the few great works of English theology, the 'Treatise on the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity'.

Travis, George (bap. 1741, d. 1797), Church of England clergyman, was baptized on 13 December 1741 at Shaw, Lancashire, the only son of John Travis of Heyside and his wife, Hannah. He was educated by his uncle Benjamin Travis, incumbent of Royton, Lancashire. He entered Manchester grammar school in January 1756 and St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar, on 17 April 1761, where he matriculated that Michaelmas. He was also admitted at the Middle Temple on 4 May 1761. Having graduated BA in 1765 (fifth senior optime and chancellor's classical medallist) he was ordained deacon on 3 March of that year and priest on 22 December; he commenced MA in 1768. He married, on 29 July 1766 at Manchester collegiate church, Ann Stringfellow, daughter and coheir of James Stringfellow of Whitfield, Derbyshire; they had no children. 
Travis's preferments were all in Cheshire: he was vicar of Eastham (1766-97), perpetual curate of Bromborough (1767-97), and rector of Handley (1787-97). Having spent some $2000 on legal actions to secure and augment the emoluments of Eastham and Bromborough he was not surprisingly 'familiarly acquainted with the law of tithes' ('GM', 433). He was appointed prebendary of Chester on 9 February 1783 and archdeacon on 27 September 1786. The title-page of his 'Letters to Edward Gibbon, Esq.' (1784) describes him also as chaplain to the dowager viscountess -- and 'ci-devant' socialite -- Etheldreda Townshend. The second edition (1785) omits this detail. 
Travis's 'Letters', three of which the 'Gentleman's Magazine' first published in 1782, attacked Gibbon for discrediting the 'three heavenly witnesses' ('1 John' 5: 7). This disputed verse, commonly accepted as a matter of Christian faith, was indefensible on manuscript evidence, as Travis, if so disposed, could have learned from Wettstein, Michaelis, or Griesbach. 
It was Travis's misfortune to be answered by Richard Porson, in his subsequently reprinted letters to the 'Gentleman's Magazine' (1788-90), and later by Herbert Marsh. Travis's scholarship was derivative and careless, his manner overweening. Porson made a fool of him. But he persevered; on 3 May 1791 Porson wrote, 'Mr. Travis is gone to Paris to examine Greek MSS. for the use, I suppose, of his third Edition' (R. Porson, 'Correspondence', ed. H. R. Luard, 1867, 49). After Travis's return that edition was delayed until 1794 -- so the preface mysteriously ends -- by ''another employment, different in its kind, yet important in its nature and consequences''. Travis died on 24 February 1797 at Hampstead, where he had moved for its healthy air, and was buried there on 6 March. There is a monument to him in Chester Cathedral.

Treby, Sir George (bap. 1644, d. 1700), judge and politician, was baptized at Plympton St Mary, Devon, on 1 January 1644, the eldest son of Peter Treby (died in or after 1663), an attorney of common pleas, and his wife, Joan, daughter of John Snelling of Chaddlewood. Treby studied at Plympton School before entering Exeter College, Oxford, in June 1660. He left Oxford without a degree, and on 24 October 1663 he was admitted to the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar on 2 June 1671. He became a bencher of his inn on 28 January 1681 and a reader in 1686, and was treasurer in 1689-90. During the 1670s much of Treby's legal work came from his native county. On 15 November 1675 he married Anna Blount, a London widow; she was the daughter of Colonel Edward Grosvenor, with whom Treby remained on close terms after Anna's death, at some time before September 1677. 
In March 1677 Treby was elected member of parliament for Plympton. His rival Richard Strode petitioned against the result, claiming that Treby had resorted to 'foul means' (Crossette and Henning). None the less, Treby kept his seat. There are signs in this period of Treby's support of nonconformists and their sympathizers in Plympton and elsewhere. He provided legal counsel to John Starkey, a bookseller whose publications were seized from Treby's Middle Temple chambers in late 1677; Starkey's shop would later become a gathering place for the whiggish Green Ribbon Club, with which Treby was associated. Despite Treby's apparent anti-court leanings, Plympton's corporation underscored their support of him when they named him their recorder and when they re-elected him to both parliaments of 1679. 
In parliament Treby took the lead in matters concerned with the wool trade and other issues of importance in Devon. He sought wider responsibilities, but failed to win the chair of the committee of elections and privileges early in 1679. However, in November 1678 Titus Oates had revealed details of the Popish Plot, and the house named Treby to lead the committee of secrecy charged with its investigation. In May he reported the committee's evidence concerning James, duke of York, which gave courage to those, like Treby, who supported York's exclusion from the succession to the crown. Talk arose in June 1679 that Treby might be named the new speaker of the Commons. Nothing came of this, 'because being so short sighted, he cannot see to distinguish members in the house' ('Seventh Report', HMC, 473). 
When Charles II convened parliament in October 1680, Treby was named to the committee investigating those who had promoted the 'abhorrences' of petitions to the king for summoning parliament. He also gained the chair of the elections committee, which he used to benefit those who shared his view of 'popery' and the duke of York, and he continued to lead the committee investigating the Popish Plot. Treby again reported their findings to the Commons and then moved for the preparation of the second 'Exclusion Bill'. He opposed any expedients by which York might be allowed to sit on the throne: 'not to make an utter exclusion of a popish successor is in plain English to have our throats cut' (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 72, fol. 466). 
In early December 1680 Treby was among the eminent lawyers prosecuting William Howard, Viscount Stafford, the first of the so-called 'popish lords' tried in the House of Lords. At the same time he was appointed recorder of London after Sir George Jeffreys resigned. He was knighted on 20 January 1681; the next month the king commissioned him a justice of the peace for London and for his native Devon. 
Plympton returned Treby to the third Exclusion Parliament in April 1681, where he helped to bring in the third 'Exclusion Bill'. More sensationally, he reported to the Commons the information he had received from Edward Fitzharris about the plot. Treby and others hoped that by impeaching Fitzharris they might gain further testimony demonstrating the involvement of Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby, and the duke of York. Once the third Exclusion parliament had been dissolved, and thus any impeachment proceeding that might embarrass the king and his allies had been halted, Fitzharris was charged with treason. Treby joined Sir Francis Winnington and Henry Pollexfen to protect their most important witness from destruction. Treby tried to convince king's bench that it could not hear the case since Fitzharris still had an impeachment pending against him in parliament: for king's bench to take the case would be to remove the matter from a higher court into a lower one. These arguments failed to persuade the justices, who ruled that since parliament had been dissolved, the impeachment proceedings had ended. Fitzharris was tried, convicted, and executed in short order. Not long thereafter Francis Hawkins, chaplain of the Tower of London, published Fitzharris's purported confession, in which he alleged that Treby and others had tried to pressure him into giving false testimony. Treby is assumed to be the author of 'Truth Vindicated', in which he vigorously defended himself and others from 'so vain, so unlikely, and so foolish a slander' (Treby, 'Truth Vindicated', 23). 
On 12 April 1681, within days of his return from the failed parliament at Oxford, Treby had made his second marriage, to Rachel (died before December 1684), daughter of James Standish of Hatton Garden. Throughout this period he was active with the Green Ribbon Club, where he allegedly promoted a 'free state' ('CSP dom.', '1680-81', 232) and suggested that James Scott, duke of Monmouth, the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II, should be king. In May 1681 Treby presented to the king an address from London requesting another parliament. The king bridled at this advice, remarking that the City meddled in business that did not belong to it. 
In part owing to the City's pressure to summon parliament, Charles's legal advisers decided to attack London's charter by 'quo warranto'. Treby, perhaps hoping to earn the king's favour for the City, made a most loyal speech when he presented London's new sheriffs at court in September 1682. But the 'quo warranto' went on, and in February 1683 Treby 'argued very learnedly' (Luttrell, 1.249) in king's bench on the City's behalf. The heart of his case was that if a wrong had been done, it could only have been done by individuals, not by the corporation itself; such individuals, not the City, should be sued and punished. More creatively, Treby noted that the 'quo warranto' was brought against the corporation by name yet charged that the corporation had been destroyed by the illegal acts it had done. He pointed to the logical contradiction of bringing a suit against a body which the same suit said did not exist. The judges brushed this complaint aside, observing that the corporation would only die when judgment was entered against it. 
Judgment was indeed given against the City, though the court delayed entering it on record in hopes that London might be convinced to surrender its charter to the king. Some lawyers advised surrender, but Treby counselled the City to fight on, telling City leaders that surrender would violate their oaths to uphold the City's rights and that it would lead to worse legal trouble than enrolment of the judgment. Treby also believed that, given the City's good behaviour, the king would not press for surrender, but judgment against the charter was entered in October 1683 and the City's corporation ceased to exist. Treby thereby lost his recordership and was soon removed as well from the various county benches on which he served. In 1684, faced with 'quo warranto' proceedings and seeing London's example, Plympton surrendered its charter and received a new one that left Treby out of the recordership there as well. 
In 1683 Treby had worked unsuccessfully with Pollexfen and William Williams to defend the former London lord mayor Sir Patience Ward on charges that he perjured himself when he gave evidence supporting Sir Thomas Pilkington from the 'scandalum magnatum' brought against him by the duke of York. In 1685 Treby joined another group of whiggish lawyers arguing on behalf of Thomas Sandys, sued by the East India Company for a breach of their trade monopoly. He argued, 'The prerogative is great; but it has this general and just limitation, that nothing is to be done thereby that is mischievous or injurious to the subject' ('State trials', 10.386). Treby reasoned that though the king could create a trading company, he could not grant it exclusive commercial powers. Once again Treby's arguments limiting the king's authority over corporations failed to convince king's bench. These cases aside, Treby did not appear in as many of the politically sensitive trials of the early 1680s as other great lawyer-MPs such as Williams, Pollexfen, and Winnington. 
The one bright spot in this period was Treby's third marriage, on 14 December 1684, to Dorothy, daughter of Ralph Grainge of the Inner Temple. Together they had two children, a son, George, and a daughter, Maria, who died in infancy. Dorothy, however, died within a few years of their marriage. On 6 January 1693 Treby married Mary Brinley ('b'. 'c'.1663), who reportedly brought a $10,000 portion. A second surviving son, Brinley, was born in 1698. 
In elections to parliament in 1685 Treby again stood at Plympton against Strode, though this time Strode prevailed, in part because Plympton's 1684 charter had remodelled the corporation and thus destroyed Treby's political base. By then Titus Oates had been charged with perjury for the testimony he had given in the Popish Plot trials. Treby was initially assigned as Oates's counsel, and though Oates wrote pitiful letters pleading for his advice, he finally decided not to help the darling of the whig cause. He also refused, in 1686, to appear in the great test case of the king's claimed power to dispense with the penal laws, 'Godden v. Hale'. But in 1688 he agreed to join many of England's most prominent lawyers to defend the seven bishops who had opposed James II's policy of religious toleration. Later that year, as the toleration effort unravelled, James sought to reconstitute London's corporation in its pre-surrender form in hopes of winning back lost political support. Twice James offered Treby his old recorder's office, and twice he refused. 
The arrival of William of Orange changed Treby's stance, and on 10 December he resumed his place as the City's recorder. The next day he was among those consulted by the provisional government about what should be done in the wake of James II's departure. At a meeting of London's aldermen on 16 December he was chiefly responsible for the defeat of a motion congratulating James II on his return to London, saying it would be inconsistent with the welcome extended to William. Four days later he led a City delegation to the prince of Orange and gave an obsequious oration to the man who, 'led by the hand of heaven, and called by the voice of the people, has preserved our dearest interests' -- chiefly law and the protestant religion -- 'which is primitive Christianity restored' ('Speech to the Prince of Orange'). 
Plympton, its old corporation revived, returned Treby to the Convention Parliament in January 1689. In the debate on the state of the crown he lashed out at James for his promotion of Catholics and his destruction of the corporations, adding that James had renounced the kingdom and could not be trusted. Only William, 'who under God, is our only remedy', could now take the throne (Jones, 244). William named Treby solicitor-general in early March, and on 6 May 1689 he promoted him to attorney-general. In the Commons, Treby reported the new form of the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, helped to prepare the 'Bill of Rights', and was among those appointed to bring in a bill for reversing the judgment in the London 'quo warranto'. More controversially, he joined the whigs who favoured the clause in the abortive 'Corporations Restoration Bill' that would have barred most urban tories from local office. In March 1690 it first appeared that he had been defeated at Plympton's parliamentary election by his old foe Strode, but the Commons voided that return; he won the second vote two weeks later. 
On 30 April 1692 Treby was installed as chief justice of common pleas and thereupon resigned the recordership and his seat in the Commons. In 1693 he presided in the trial of William Anderton for seditious libel, and in 1695 and 1696 he was among the justices who tried the association plotters. Treby gave his most important judicial opinion, in the widely watched bankers' case, in June 1695, in which he recommended reversing the exchequer decree for the bankers. He suggested that the court of exchequer had no power to compensate the bankers by ordering payments out of the Treasury. He was joined in this view by Lord Keeper Somers, who reversed the exchequer judgment. But in January 1700 the House of Lords took up the matter. When they consulted the judges, Treby again gave his opinion against the initial decree, but he and Somers were overruled as the Lords restored the original judgment. Throughout these years Treby often presided in the Lords as speaker when the lord keeper was absent or ill. In May 1700 he was among those briefly commissioned to hold the great seal itself after Lord Somers's removal. 
In early December 1700 Treby, feeling ill, moved to Kensington for better air. He died there on 13 December, survived by his fourth wife and two sons. He was quietly buried in the Temple Church in an evening ceremony three days later. Sir John Holt, chief justice of king's bench, along with some of the other justices, served as his executor and as trustee for his sons. Treby left his wife and children with extensive properties in Devon, Cornwall, and Lincolnshire, large amounts of cash out on loan, and a house at Hatton Garden. The aldermen of Plympton, the town that gave him his start in law and politics, received rings from their late recorder. 
Treby did not prevail in the major cases he argued during the 1680s, but this did not lead contemporaries to doubt his powers as a lawyer. Nahum Tate waxed lyrical on his abilities: '
For law, that does a boundless ocean seem, 

Is coasted all, and fathomed all by him... 

His judgments he from Truth's clear fountain draws, 

Respecting not the party, but the cause... 

' Evelyn too called him 'a learned man' (Evelyn, 5.438), with good cause. Treby's arguments in the London 'quo warranto' and the East India Company cases were notable for their creativity and precision, even if they did not succeed in law. His erudition was equally apparent in his annotations of Dyer's 'Reports' and in his words from the bench, which showed his attention to procedural propriety and to logical rigour. His widow erected a monument to his finer qualities in the Temple Church. Unsurprisingly, the tory biographer Roger North did not care much for Treby, who he said 'was no fanatic; but, of the fanatic party, true as steel. His genius lay to free-thinking, and, conformably to his fellows at that time, made the scriptures and Christianity, or rather all religion, a jest...' (North, 2.9). Treby's support of foreign protestants as well as English ones suggests that North was probably right about his sympathy for nonconformists. He showed a consistent commitment to whig political goals in the 1680s. His anti-Catholic bigotry made him more credulous in accepting the evidence of a 'popish' plot than his otherwise careful mind might have allowed; his abandonment of Oates in his hour of need points to his sense of political expediency if not to his personal loyalty to one whose wild allegations had fuelled Treby's rise to prominence.

Tredenham, John (bap. 1668, d. 1710), politician, was baptized on 28 March 1668 at St Ewe, Cornwall, the second (but first surviving) son of Sir Joseph Tredenham (1641/2-1707), politician, of Tregonan, St Ewe, and Elizabeth Seymour ('c'.1635-1731), daughter of Sir Edward Seymour, third baronet, of Berry Pomeroy, Devon. Little is known about Tredenham's early life, although he received a conventional education at the Inner Temple (1682) and Christ Church, Oxford (1684). At Oxford he was reputed to have contributed to the collection of verses celebrating the accession of James II. 
Tredenham's tory contacts were formidable, not least his uncle, Sir Edward Seymour, fourth baronet. This may explain his early venture into the electoral arena, close to his twenty-first birthday, when he was defeated at Truro for a seat in the Convention Parliament of 1689. On 1 February 1690 he married Anne ('b'. 1671/2), daughter and coheir of Sir John Lloyd, second baronet ('c'.1651?-1674), of Carmarthenshire, and Mary, daughter of the Revd Matthew Smallwood; they had one daughter, who predeceased her father. According to Sir Joseph, the marriage was not a success owing to the personality of Lady Lloyd who (among other things) intercepted letters between father and son. On 9 April 1690 Tredenham entered parliament in a by-election for St Mawes, following his uncle Henry Seymour's decision to sit elsewhere. Although a tory, Tredenham made little impact during his early years in the Commons, being overshadowed by his father. He did, however, refuse to sign the voluntary Association in 1696, although there is no evidence of his ever supporting the Jacobite cause. 
Tredenham achieved considerable notoriety following a dinner on 23 September 1701 at the Blue Posts tavern in the Haymarket, London. His companions that night were his fellow tory MPs Anthony Hammond and Charles Davenant; the Spanish envoy, Navarra; and the French charge d'affaires, Jean Baptiste Poussin. Unfortunately, orders had been issued to expel Poussin from England that day, in response to Louis XIV's recognition of James III (James Francis Edward Stuart). When this was discovered the whigs exploited it to the full, accusing the tories of Jacobitism, and at the subsequent general election appending the label 'Pousineer' to those who had opposed preparations for war with France. A pamphlet war ensued, and both Davenant and Hammond lost their seats. Ironically Tredenham, who was widely blamed for the debacle and who had reportedly left the tavern with Poussin, was re-elected for his family borough of St Mawes. 
Tredenham continued to sit as a tory under Queen Anne, but there is evidence that he was trimming his sails in the pursuit of office. Both he and his father appear to have sneaked off to avoid voting on the tack of the 'Occasional Conformity Bill' in November 1704. Lampooned as 'poet-laureat to Monsieur Poussin' in 1705 he did not stand at the general election of that year, preferring to solicit Robert Harley for a diplomatic posting. In support of his pretensions he wrote 'I may with confidence pretend to understand the Latin tongue and that I'm no stranger to the French', although he laid most stress on his 'fidelity to her Majesty' (Tredenham to Harley, 13 July 1705, BL, Add. MS 70207). Despite reports in October that he would be posted to Denmark, no office was forthcoming, so he took the opportunity to return to the Commons after the death of his father in 1707. He continued to sit as a tory, and played a full part in the convocation of tinners in 1710, taking over the chair when the speaker fell ill. Tredenham died on 25 December 1710, either 'by a fall from his coach box' (Le Neve, 3.210) or, as one newsletter described it, 'suffocated with excessive fatness and too plentiful a dinner' (Strathmore MSS, box 74, bundle 10). In noticing his death, Abel Boyer pronounced him as 'one of the leading men of the Church party' before referring to his enduring fame as a 'Pousineer' (Boyer, 53).

Tredgold, Thomas (1788-1829), engineer, was born at Brandon, near the city of Durham, on 22 August 1788. After receiving a basic elementary education at the village school he was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to a cabinet-maker at Durham. Tredgold remained with him six years, studying mathematics and architecture in his spare time, and taking advantage of the holidays granted on race days to acquire a knowledge of perspective. Following the completion of his apprenticeship in 1808 he went to Scotland where he worked five years as a joiner and journeyman carpenter. His zeal for self-improvement by intensive study affected his health, particularly through lack of sleep and relaxation. He left Scotland to work in the London office of his uncle, William Atkinson, architect to the ordnance, with whom he lived for six years. Continuing to work for Atkinson he maintained his abiding interest in engineering construction. He taught himself French to broaden his technical reading, striving to master the latest literature on engineering and architecture. He also avidly read chemistry, mineralogy, and geology, and sought to improve his knowledge of the higher branches of mathematics. 
In 1820 Tredgold published 'Elementary Principles of Carpentry', in which he considered the problems connected with the resistance of timber in relation to making floors, roofs, bridges, and other structures. This work was intended to show clearly the principles of construction. He was conscious of the need to write plainly, avoiding, where possible, esoteric technical language. He also wrote an essay on the nature and properties of timber. With the exception of Barlow's 'Essay on the Strength of Timber and other Materials' (1817) Tredgold's work was the first serious attempt in England to determine practically and scientifically the data of resistance, rather than relying on formulae calculated in the previous century. Several editions of Tredgold's work were published after his death; the latest edition appeared in 1919. This work was followed in 1822 by 'A Practical Essay on the Strength of Cast Iron and other Metals'. Though they were long the standard textbooks of English engineers, the scientific value of both these works was seriously impaired by Tredgold's insufficient mathematical training, and particularly by his ignorance of the theory of elasticity, which often led him into error and rendered his reasoning obscure. 
In 1823 the increase of business and his commitment to his studies led Tredgold to resign his position in Atkinson's office and to set up on his own account. Confident in his all-round abilities as a writer on technical subjects, he also submitted to the Edinburgh publisher Napier in 1823 an article on steel-engraving 'as far as it relates to printing', adding that it was 'not in my line of pursuits' (BL, Marvey Napier MSS). In the same year Tredgold put forward a criticism of Perkins's steam engine, arguing that it would never produce the same effect as the common condensing engine. In the last five years of his life Tredgold published numerous technical articles, in addition to several books and contributions to the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica'. 
Tredgold died, exhausted by study, on 28 January 1829, and was buried in St John's Wood chapel cemetery. He left an estate valued at under $800 to his widow, Sally, three daughters, and son Thomas, who held the post of engineer in the office of stamps of the East India Company at Calcutta, where he died on 4 May 1853.

Tredway, Letice (1593-1677), abbess of the Convent of Our Blessed Lady of Syon, Paris, was baptized Letice or Letitia Tredway, and was the daughter of Sir Walter Tredway (died 1604) of Beaconsfield and his wife, Elizabeth Weyman. After the premature deaths within ten years of both her father and her brother she inherited rights to the family property. By the time of her brother's death in 1615 she had already converted to Catholicism and had entered a Flemish Augustinian convent near Douai, where she remained for some years. At the time there were no English houses in France, although a number had been founded in Flanders. With Thomas Carre, a priest at the English College at Douai, she decided to found the first English house in France. At first, the plan was to open a convent in Douai, but by 1632 she had fixed firmly on Paris as the site of the new house. In spite of a lack of contacts in Paris, in 1633 she obtained letters patent from Louis XIII for the founding of the new house under the direction of English secular clergy, subject to the authority of the archbishop of Paris. However, there were objections, not least because she lacked a foundation fund and had only one professed nun, Margaret de Bury, a Walloon, as a committed supporter. The dowries of five postulants, newly arrived from England, would not contribute financially to the house until they were paid a year later on profession. Mary Tredway settled $3000 from family sources to support the new convent financially and by 1635 the first postulants were professed. 
From the beginning the main burden of organization rested on Mary Tredway. However, the reputation of the new convent spread and attracted other entrants from England. By 1640 there were nineteen choir nuns, five lay sisters and three novices; new premises which became the convent's home for the next 220 years had been bought and a school for English girls had been established. Within five years the building programme was completed and she turned her full attention to the spiritual and liturgical life of the convent. She had brought St Augustine's rule with her from Douai and this she applied carefully. By the 1640s the convent of Our Blessed Lady of Syon was a flourishing community which had earned a reputation for excellent music and discipline. 
The civil wars in England and France deprived the house of both income and recruits, but its reputation secured financial assistance from Seguier, the chancellor of France, which enabled the convent to survive. In spite of the financial difficulties of this period Mary Tredway and Thomas Carre co-operated in the foundation of a small college, St Gregory's, where English secular priests could stay while they studied at the Sorbonne. Mary Tredway included them in as much of the convent life as she was able to. From the first recruits she found a successor to Thomas Carre, who had acted as financial adviser as well as confessor to the convent. Edward Lutton was an excellent choice, able to sort out a number of serious financial problems for them. 
Mary Tredway celebrated her jubilee in 1664 with ceremonies that included special services and music, presentations by the boarders from the school, and dinner with most of the English Catholics in Paris. In old age ill health prevented her carrying out her duties as abbess as she wished and, aged over eighty, she suffered a bad fall in 1672 which left her virtually bedridden for the last five years of her life. Lutton was able to negotiate new constitutions which allowed the election of a new abbess every four years and Mary Tredway resigned after forty years as abbess, spending her last years reading the prayers and devotions of St Thomas a Kempis. She died on 13 October 1677 and was buried in the convent chapel (demolished in 1860). 
At her death Mary Tredway left a convent with forty-three choir nuns and ten lay sisters. She had created and led a community which would prove strong enough to survive the French Revolution, giving the veil to eighty postulants. The convent had a high reputation as a centre of discipline and musical excellence and for its school, which attracted pupils from a wide area.

Tregellas, Walter Hawken (1831-1894), writer, born at Truro, Cornwall, on 10 July 1831, was the eldest son of John Tabois Tregellas (1792-1863), merchant at Truro, purser of Cornish mines, and author of the popular 'Cornish Tales' (1860). His mother was Anne (1801-1867), second daughter of Richard Hawken. He was educated by his uncle, John Hawken, at Trevarth School, Gwennap, from 1838 to 1845, and from 1845 to 1847 at the grammar school of Truro. 
Tregellas was fond of drawing from an early age, and won prizes as an artist at the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society at Falmouth between 1846 and 1848. He began his career as a draughtsman in the War Office on 10 July 1855, was promoted second draughtsman in February 1860, rose to be chief draughtsman in May 1866, and retained the post until August 1893. Tregellas married at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, on 2 November 1861, Zoe Wilson ('b'. 1840), third daughter of Charles Lucas (1808-1869) and his wife, Frances. 
Tregellas was also a keen writer, publishing many works including 'China, the Country, History and People' (1867) and 'The Horse Guards Memoranda' (1880). His interest in military matters was further illustrated in his 'Historical Sketch of the Defences of Malta', printed for the Royal Engineers' Institute at Chatham in 1879, and in a similar study of the coastal defences of England, which was published in 1887, having originally appeared in the engineers' occasional papers series. He contributed several articles to the 'Archaeological Journal' (1864-6) and the 'Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall' (1883, 1891). Many of his publications were inspired by his native county, including 'Cornish Worthies' (1884) and his 'Tourist Guide to Cornwall' (1878), which reached a seventh edition in 1895. He also wrote many of the articles on Cornish people in the first thirteen volumes of the 'Dictionary of National Biography'. His principal work, a history of the Tower of London, was left unpublished after his death. 
Tregellas died at Stanley House, Prince of Wales Terrace, Deal, on 28 May 1894, and was buried in Deal cemetery on 30 May. He had no children, and his wife survived him.

Tregelles, Edwin Octavius (1806-1886), ironmaster and Quaker minister, was born on 19 October 1806 at Falmouth, the youngest of the seventeen children (eight being twins) of Samuel Tregelles (1766-1831), merchant and rope maker, and Rebecca (1766-1811), daughter of Thomas Smith (1725-1792), London silversmith and member of the Quaker banking firm of Smith, Wright, and Gray. His mother's surviving sister had married Thomas Fox (1747/8-1821), a woollen manufacturer and banker at Wellington, Somerset. By 1827, when Tregelles attained his majority, his forty first cousins were nearly all intellectually vigorous as well as active in commerce or industry -- including such scientists as Robert Were Fox (1789-1877) and Charles Fox (1797-1878). 
Samuel Tregelles had been one of the twelve partners (mainly of the Fox family) in the Perran foundry, near Falmouth, from its establishment in 1791. The following year the partners had leased the Neath Abbey ironworks and in 1820 Edwin Tregelles was apprenticed to his cousin Joseph Tregelles Price (1784-1854) who had succeeded his father, Peter Price, as managing partner of the Neath Abbey Iron Company, as it was called from 1818. Tregelles was joined there by his brother Nathaniel (1803-1887) who remained until 1847. Edwin himself was a man of conscientious -- some in the family thought over-conscientious -- scruple and in 1831, rather than be a party to supplying machinery for a Newport brewery, he resigned his position. 
Tregelles's work for Neath Abbey had involved extensive travelling and at Youghal, co. Cork, he had seen much of Abraham Fisher, a Quaker miller whose daughter Jenepher (1808-1844) he married on 5 July 1832: there were three children. He had meanwhile set up in business on his own account as a civil engineer, superintending the introduction of gas lighting to many towns in the south of England. He was appointed (1835) engineer of the Southampton and Salisbury Railway; he was engaged in surveying for the West Cornwall Railway; and he reported (1849) on the water supply and sewerage of Barnstaple and Bideford. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 5 March 1850, but resigned in 1861. 
By the time of his election Tregelles had become a tinplate manufacturer at Shotley Bridge, co. Durham. On 4 December 1850 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Richardson (1813-1878): there were no children. Her brother Jonathan Richardson (1802-1871) founded in 1841 the Derwent Iron Company of which her brother-in-law Jonathan Priestman (1825-1888) was later managing director. Tregelles also involved himself in the family's coal interests but in 1853 retired from business and devoted himself entirely to Quaker and philanthropic work. He had begun to speak in Quaker meetings about 1828, his spiritual life by then being much affected by the deaths of seven of his brothers and sisters. His gift in the ministry was recorded by South Wales monthly meeting in 1837. His early travels in the ministry included the Isles of Scilly; Ireland (1839) with Robert Were Fox; the West Indies (1843-4) with James Jesup (1796-1868); and Norway (1846) with Isaac Sharp (1806-1897) and John Budge (1787-1864). 
Tregelles's interest in temperance developed into advocacy of total abstinence and he served on the council of the United Kingdom Alliance. He was active in 1855 in the relief of distress in the Hebrides and was engaged, often accompanied by his wife, in numerous journeys in the ministry in Scotland and the north of England. Throughout his life he had a particular concern for the children in Friends' schools: his sister Rachel (1805-1874) was from 1853 to 1862 superintendent of the Quaker York Quarterly Meeting Girls' School, supervising its removal in 1857 from Castlegate to The Mount. 
From 1837 Tregelles suffered indifferent health and following the death of his second wife he suffered severe illness, but was able to spend the winter of 1882 visiting the small groups of French Quakers at Nismes and Congenies. Short attacks of illness continued, however, and he died of 'natural decay [and] cardiac degeneration' on 16 September 1886 at the home of his elder daughter and son-in-law, Gertrude M. (1833-1932) and Charles (1830-1895) Gillett, Wood Green, Neithrop, Banbury, where he had been living: his body was interred in the Quaker burial-ground, Sibford Gower, Oxfordshire, five days later.

Tregelles, Samuel Prideaux (1813-1875), biblical scholar, son of Samuel Tregelles (1789-1828), merchant, of Falmouth, and his wife, Dorothy (1790-1873), daughter of George Prideaux of Kingsbridge, was born at Wodehouse Place, Falmouth, on 30 January 1813. He was the nephew of Edwin Octavius Tregelles. He was educated at Falmouth classical school from 1825 to 1828 and showed early promise. From 1829 to 1835 he was employed at the Neath Abbey ironworks in Glamorgan, and he devoted his spare time to learning Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. He also mastered Welsh, and sometimes preached and published in that language. Finding his work uncongenial he returned to Falmouth in 1835, and supported himself by taking pupils. Although both his parents were Quakers he joined the Plymouth Brethren, but later in life he became a Presbyterian. On 12 March 1839 he married his cousin, Sarah Anna (1807-1882), eldest daughter of Walter Prideaux, banker, of Plymouth. They had no children. 
Tregelles's first book was 'Passages in the Revelation Connected with the Old Testament' (1836). In 1837, having obtained work from publishers, he settled in London. He superintended the publication of the 'Englishman's Greek Concordance to the New Testament' (1839) and the 'Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance to the Old Testament' (1843). In 1841 he wrote 'An historical account of the English translations of the scriptures' for Samuel Bagster's 'English Hexapla'. 
In 1838 Tregelles took up the critical study of the 'New Testament' and decided to publish a new version of the Greek text. This plan resulted from his discovery that the 'textus receptus' did not rest on ancient authority and that existing collations were inconsistent and inaccurate. He aimed to produce a text based entirely on ancient manuscripts compared with early versions and patristic citations to the time of Eusebius, and to state clearly the authorities for the readings. Tregelles was for many years unaware that he was working on the same lines as the German philologist and textual critic, Karl Lachmann. Like Lachmann he minimized the importance of cursive manuscripts, dating from the ninth century onwards, thereby differing from his fellow critic F. H. A. Scrivener. 
Tregelles first became generally known through his 'Book of Revelation in Greek Edited from Ancient Authorities' (1844). This contained the announcement of his intention to prepare a Greek 'New Testament'. He began by collating the 'Codex Augiensis' (F 010) at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1845 he went to Rome with the intention of collating codex B 03 in the Vatican, but, though he spent five months there, he was not allowed to copy the manuscript. He nevertheless managed to note some important readings. From Rome he went to Florence, Modena, Venice, Munich, and Basel, reading and collating all relevant manuscripts. He returned to England in November 1846 and settled at Plymouth, and he continued collating manuscripts in the British Museum. In 1849 he went to Paris, but an attack of cholera drove him home. He returned in 1850, finished the laborious task of collating the damaged 'Cyprius' (K 017), and then collated other manuscripts including the minuscule no. 33, 'Queen of the cursives'. Tregelles subsequently went to Hamburg, and from there travelled to Berlin, where he met Lachmann. He also visited Leipzig, where he collaborated with Constantin Tischendorf, Dresden, Wolfenbuttel, and Utrecht, and he returned home in 1851. Until 1857 he was employed collating manuscripts in England. In 1853 he restored and deciphered the uncial palimpsest Z 035 of 'Matthew's gospel' at Dublin. 
In 1854 Tregelles published 'An Account of the Printed Text of the Greek New Testament'. In 1856 he rewrote for T. H. Horne's 'Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures' the section on textual criticism in volume 4, and in 1860 he contributed a postscript, 'Additions'. These publications provide details about the principles on which his subsequent textual work was based. 
The first part of the Greek 'New Testament', 'St Matthew' and 'St Mark', was published to subscribers in 1857, but proved unremunerative. Tregelles went abroad for his health, and stayed at Geneva and Milan. At Milan he made a facsimile tracing of the Muratorian fragment ('Codex Muratorianus'), but he was unable to publish it until 1867. On the return journey he visited Christian Bunsen at Heidelberg. In 1860 he went on a tour through Spain, where he showed much interest in the protestant community. The second part of the Greek 'New Testament' -- 'St Luke' and 'St John' -- appeared in 1861. In 1862 Tregelles went to Leipzig to examine the 'Codex Sinaiticus', then in Tischendorf's keeping, and from there he travelled to Halle and Erlangen. Tregelles's editions of 'Acts' and the catholic epistles were issued in 1865 (by which date Tischendorf's facsimile of 'Codex Sinaiticus' was available), and the 'Pauline epistles' up to '2 Thessalonians' were published in 1869. He was revising the last chapters of 'Revelation' in 1870 when he had a stroke of paralysis, after which he never walked. He continued to work in bed. The remainder of the epistles were published in 1870, but the book of 'Revelation' (the text of which differs about 230 places from that which he published in 1844) was edited from his papers by S. J. B. Bloxsidge and B. W. Newton in 1872. It lacked the long-expected prolegomena, but in 1879 F. J. A. Hort published an appendix containing the materials for the prolegomena that Tregelles's notes supplied, with additions (especially readings from 'Codex Sinaiticus' and 'Codex Vaticanus' in the gospels) and corrections by A. W. Streane. Tregelles's collations and his edition of a Greek 'New Testament' based on the oldest manuscripts available were remarkable achievements and they paved the way for the Greek edition of Westcott and Hort in 1881 and for the Revised Version of the English 'Bible' of the same year. 
Tregelles received the degree of LLD from St Andrews in 1850, and in 1862 he was awarded a civil-list pension of $100, which was doubled in 1870. He was a member of the New Testament Revision Company but was unable to attend its meetings. He died at his home, 6 Portland Square, Plymouth, on 24 April 1875, and was buried five days later in Plymouth cemetery. His wife survived him until 1882, receiving half of his civil-list pension. Among Tregelles's other works, his 'Collation of the texts of Griesbach, Scholz, Lachmann, and Tischendorf, with that in common use' (1854) and his 'Codex Zacynthius, Fragments of St Luke' (1861) have proved to be of enduring value.

Tregian, Francis (1548-1608), recusant gentleman, was born in 1548 at Golden Manor, near Probus, Cornwall, the son of John Tregian (1520-1575) and his wife, Katherine ('c'.1520- 'c'.1580), eldest daughter of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne and his wife, Elizabeth. He received his early education at home before spending the years 1560-72 on the continent. About 1570 he married Mary ('c'.1550- 'c'.1620), eldest daughter of Charles, seventh Lord Stourton, and Anne, daughter of Edward, earl of Derby. 
At the age of twenty-four Tregian returned from the continent to serve at the court of Elizabeth I. His zeal for the Catholic faith and his refusal to accept awards and advances from the queen led to his dismissal from court. On his return to Golden Manor he sought to strengthen the faith of his fellow Catholics by engaging a seminary priest, Cuthbert Mayne. Mayne had been recently ordained at the English College in Douai founded by William Allen. The queen summoned Sir George Carey, the knight marshal, to proceed against Tregian. Orders were sent to Richard Grenville, sheriff of Cornwall, who surrounded Golden with more than one hundred armed men on the feast of Corpus Christi, 8 June 1577. Tregian, Mayne, and thirty-one other Cornish recusants were arrested. The grateful queen bestowed a knighthood on Grenville for the way he had dealt with this 'matter of religion' (Bushnell, 121). Cuthbert Mayne was put to death on 30 November 1577 as a 'terror to the papists' (Anstruther, 226). Initially charged at Launceston on 16 September 1577 Tregian suffered many trials and was eventually found guilty in 1579 of aiding and abetting Cuthbert Mayne. By a sentence of 'praemunire' he became the first Catholic under Elizabeth to forfeit all his lands and goods and was ordered to remain in prison for life. From Launceston he was taken to London, and was held at Marshalsea prison in Southwark, the queen's bench, and lastly in the Fleet prison, Ludgate. His wife was able to visit him in prison and altogether there were twelve children of the marriage. After appeals Tregian was given leave to go on parole in Chelsea in 1601. 
In 1603, on the accession of James I, Tregian left once again for the continent, visiting the college at Douai in 1603. In Brussels he saw his son Francis again, and on his arrival in Madrid the king of Spain, Philip III, arranged a triumphant procession for him in the royal coach. He lived on a pension of sixty cruzados a month. He died in the Jesuit hospital at St Roque, Lisbon, on 25 September 1608, and was buried in the floor of St Roque church. On 25 April 1625 his grave was opened. According to Ignatius Stafford his body was found perfect and he was re-buried one year later, by English Catholics, standing up in the marble pulpit of the same church to honour the way he had stood up to Elizabeth. The inscription on the tomb describes 'Dom Francisco Tregian', an 'illustrious English gentleman who died in the city of Lisbon with great fame and saintliness'. 
Francis Tregian (1574-1617), his eldest son, was born at Golden Manor, and was educated at Eu, Douai, and Rome, where he was described as 'very noble, twenty years old, a happy and natural genius extremely proficient in philosophy, music and the Latin language' (Knox, 356). He worked for Cardinal Allen in Rome and delivered his funeral address there in 1594. He also worked for Albert, archduke of the Spanish Netherlands, and these facts were held against him when he returned to England. When his attempt to regain Golden Manor failed he was imprisoned in the Fleet in 1614. While there he was known to have been working on an important book for two years. Scholars are agreed that he was transcribing and arranging the music for the collection known as the Fitzwilliam virginal book, now kept in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. This important document contains works by William Byrd, who wrote the work 'Tregian's Ground' for the family. Tregian was buried in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, on 11 August 1617.

Tregonwell, Sir John (c.1498-1565), lawyer and ecclesiastical administrator, may have been born of yeoman stock at Tregonnell in the parish of Manaccan in Cornwall; he had a sister, Alice, who married John Southcote. His first wife's maiden name was Kelway; his second wife, Elizabeth Martin, 'nee' Bruce (died 1581/2), bore him a son, Thomas, and other children, who all appear to have predeceased him. Tregonwell may have been educated at Crantock College, Cornwall. He certainly attended Broadgates Hall, Oxford, obtaining his BCL on 30 June 1516 and his DCL on 21 July 1522. Before about 1527 he was principal of Vine Hall, Oxford, also known as Peckwaters Inn. Tregonwell practised at the court of arches, being admitted to the College of Advocates on 9 December 1522. By 1527 he is identified as a judge of the admiralty. 
Evidently Tregonwell demonstrated considerable legal skill because in 1529 King Henry VIII 'called him from the Arches' to assist in the royal divorce from Katherine of Aragon ('LP Henry VIII', vol. 14/2, appendix 35). Tregonwell appeared as one of the king's proctors at the hearing before Cardinal Campeggi at Blackfriars in June 1529, and in 1530 accompanied Thomas Cranmer and others to dispute the validity of the king's marriage abroad. As a master of chancery, Tregonwell appeared on behalf of the king on 5 April 1533, demanding that the convocation of Canterbury came to a conclusion regarding the king's divorce. On 8 May 1533 he accompanied Cranmer and others to Dunstable as a councillor in law 'for the King's part' and on 23 May 1533 was present when Cranmer declared the king's marriage as 'against the law of God' ('LP Henry VIII', vol. 6, nos. 661, 525). As a reward for his part in these events he obtained a $40 annuity for life. 
Tregonwell was also involved in diplomatic negotiations. In April and May 1532 he accompanied William Knight, archdeacon of Richmond, and John Hackett to Burborough, where mercantile grievances between the Merchant Adventurers and the Netherlands were discussed. In 1534 he was appointed a commissioner in the two treaties of peace with Scotland which he also signed; in the commission he is described as the principal judge of the admiralty. In October 1545 he was appointed, along with Tunstal and Paget, to treat with King Francois I of France for peace. Illness prevented him from being appointed an ambassador to Flanders in 1546. His status with the king is reflected in his appointment as one of the council remaining at Westminster during Henry's discussions with Francois at the end of 1532. However, a setback in Tregonwell's career is revealed in May 1534 when, in a letter to Thomas Cromwell, he states that Cromwell had 'announced that the King has granted me master of the rolls' ('LP Henry VIII', vol. 7, no. 743); in the event Cromwell obtained the position when it fell vacant in October 1534. 
Tregonwell is best-known for his role as monastic visitor and commissioner. In a draft commission for the visitation of the entire English ecclesiastical establishment, dated either the end of November or early December 1534, Tregonwell is named as one of the three vicegerents. However, in January 1535 Cromwell became vicar-general and Tregonwell later was commissioned as a monastic visitor. He is first clearly identified accompanying Richard Layton at the visitation of Oxford University in the second week of September, issuing injunctions 'for the increase of learning there' and ensuring that every scholar took the oath of supremacy ('LP Henry VIII', vol. 9, no. 351). After Oxford, Tregonwell parted from Layton and continued the visitation in the southern part of Lincolnshire diocese. By 9 November he had visited Athelney, Cleeve, and other Somerset houses and was about to enter Devon. In the monastic visitation he is last identified in early January 1536 at Salisbury Cathedral. Later in the summer he was probably involved with suppressing smaller houses in the west country. In November 1536 Tregonwell, along with Bedyll and Petre, were commissioned to receive from ecclesiastical institutions the bulls, briefs, and faculties previously issued by the papacy. 
Early in 1538 Tregonwell had a commission for dissolving certain greater abbeys, including Abingdon. The pressure on abbeys to surrender increased at the end of 1538 and in December he was sent to Shaftesbury Abbey to encourage its submission. From January to March 1539 he was engaged in taking large numbers of monastic surrenders in the south-west and confirming pension arrangements for the redundant religious. In April 1539 he was one of three canon-law experts appointed by the king and Cromwell to frame the 'Act of Six Articles'. From November 1539 to January 1540 he was principally in Lincolnshire diocese during the final tranche of surrenders and dissolutions. 
Tregonwell complained to Cromwell in August 1539 that he had been 'a long suitor' for monastic spoils but 'nothing would fall to my lot' ('LP Henry VIII', vol. 14/2, appendix 35). He had in 1536 pleaded with Cromwell for the lease of a monastic house 'whereby he may have some help toward his living and funding of his wife and children' ('LP Henry VIII', vol. 10, no. 388). On 23 February 1540 Tregonwell and his nephew John Southcote were granted in fee simple for $1000 the house, site, and lands of the Benedictine abbey of Milton Abbas, Dorset, which a year previously he had suppressed. 
Tregonwell was involved with other key events in King Henry's reign. In the first half of 1535 he was present when two Carthusian priests and Sir Thomas More were questioned for rejecting the king's supreme headship of the church. In May 1536 he participated in the proceedings against Anne Boleyn. After the northern risings of 1536-7 he was involved with examining the abbot of Barlings, the abbot of Jervaulx, George Lumley, and others. In the inquiry into the validity of the king's marriage to Anne of Cleves, Tregonwell was a member of the working party which, in July 1540, pronounced its nullity. He was often given legal commissions by the privy council: in 1541, for example, he was sent to Plymouth to untangle the legal complexity of the wreck of a Portuguese ship. However, the summit of his legal skill is reflected in a commission to determine matters in chancery in the absence of the lord chancellor, dated October 1544; in 1547, 1550, and 1555 he had similar commissions. He was also a receiver of petitions to the House of Lords at parliaments in 1536, 1539, and 1541. 
During Edward VI's reign, Tregonwell was still active in legal affairs and as a justice of the peace in Dorset. His name appears on a shortlist of three from which the sheriff of Dorset and Somerset was pricked. His career appears to have been revitalized in Mary's reign: on her accession he was one of the first to be knighted (on 2 October 1553), he was MP for Scarborough in her first parliament, a member of the commission examining Bishop Bonner's appeal against deprivation in Edward's reign, sheriff of Dorset and Somerset in 1554, and a House of Lords receiver of petitions in four parliaments. In February 1554 he was sworn one of the king and queen's council. Tregonwell's social position is exemplified by the licence he received to retain thirty gentlemen or yeomen in his household. 
It is probably Tregonwell's conservative religious sympathies that account for his absence from important office after Elizabeth's accession, although he continued as a justice of the peace in Dorset. He made his will in December 1563, with an invocation for the prayers of the 'most glorious and blessed Virgin Mary', and, after apparently a lengthy illness, died at Milton Abbas on 13 January 1565, where he was buried in the old abbey church. His grandson John Tregonwell, son of his deceased son Thomas, was heir and had licence to enter the inheritance in July 1571.

Tregury, Michael (c.1399-1471), archbishop of Dublin, was born at St Wenn in Cornwall and was educated at Oxford (BA by 1426, BTh by 1439, and DTh by 1444). From 1422 to 1427 he was fellow of Exeter College and in 1434-5 he was senior proctor of the university. Henry VI appointed Tregury first rector of the University of Caen in October 1439, a position he had resigned by March 1440. 
John Bale attributed to Tregury the authorship of three works, apparently lectures delivered at Caen: 'Lectura sententiarum', 'De origine illius studii' (perhaps referring to the University of Caen), and 'Ordinariae quaestiones'. None of them is known to have been printed or to be extant. Tregury was said to have been principal of various halls connected with Exeter College in the 1420s and 1430s. He was ordained priest in March 1427 and held a number of different benefices, particularly in the diocese of Exeter, between 1429 and his promotion to the archbishopric of Dublin in 1449; these included canonries of Crediton, Devon (1447-9); of St Martin le Grand, London (1447-9); of Exeter (resigned 1449); and also the archdeaconry of Barnstaple (1445-9). He was appointed chaplain to Henry VI and Queen Margaret of Anjou. About 1447 the latter wrote recommending Tregury's appointment to the vicarage of Corfe Castle or the bishopric of Lisieux. Neither suggestion seems to have been adopted. 
On the death of Richard Talbot, archbishop of Dublin, in 1449, Tregury was papally provided to that see; he was suspended by the pope in 1453 for being consecrated before receiving the bull of provision and without taking an oath of fealty. As archbishop he was a member of the Irish privy council, in which capacity he received an annual salary of $20 but he did not hold other governmental positions. He was in Ireland by late 1451 having been shipwrecked 'en route'. He had royal licence to be absent from Ireland for three years from 1458 and again for one year in 1461. His tenure of the archbishopric, which lasted twenty-two years, was marked by an active policy of ecclesiastical visitations and disputes with the archbishop of Armagh over the claims to primacy. His predecessor, Talbot, had apparently much depleted the revenues of his see and, finding the metropolitan cross in pawn and much of the archiepiscopal demesne alienated, Tregury obtained a papal indult to hold other benefices to a total value of not more than $200. In 1462 he was violently assaulted and imprisoned in Dublin by some Irishmen, who were excommunicated for the offence. His claims to lands and jurisdiction were resented by Anglo-Irish and Gaelic Irish. In 1465 he was indicted for assault; he subsequently cleared himself, claiming that there was a conspiracy against him. 
Tregury died at his manor house of Tallaght, near Dublin, on 21 December 1471 and was buried near St Stephen's altar in St Patrick's Cathedral. The monument erected over his tomb was afterwards buried under the rubbish in St Stephen's Chapel, where it was discovered by Dean Swift in 1730 and re-erected on the wall to the left of the west gate. By his will, which is dated 10 December 1471, Tregury bequeathed to St Patrick's Cathedral his 'pair of organs' and two silver salt-cellars to be made into chalices; he also directed that oblations should be made on his behalf to St Michael's Mount, Cornwall.

Trelawney, Charles (1653-1731), army officer, was the fourth but second surviving son of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, second baronet ('c'.1623-1681), of Trelawne, Pelynt, Cornwall, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Edward Seymour of Berry Pomeroy, near Totnes, Devon. He was the brother of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, third baronet (1650-1721), bishop of Winchester, Henry ('c'.1658-1702), and John ('c'.1646-1680). Commissioned in 1672 into the duke of Monmouth's royal English regiment, an auxiliary formation in the French army, Trelawney served during the invasion of the Dutch republic and at the siege of Maastricht in 1673. On 16 March 1674 he transferred as captain into the 2nd battalion of the royal English, commanded by Bevil Skelton. He probably saw action at the battle of Enzheim in 1674, and was certainly involved at Altenheim in 1675. He returned to England in 1677 and was commissioned captain-lieutenant of the old battalion of Monmouth's Foot in 1678, and promoted major on 1 November. On 13 July 1680 he was appointed major of the earl of Plymouth's infantry regiment raised for Tangier. Promotion to lieutenant-colonel of Plymouth's followed on 27 November 1680, when Percy Kirke became colonel, and colonel on 23 April 1682. On the evacuation of Tangier in 1684 he sailed to England, and part of his regiment fought at Sedgemoor in 1685. A leading member of the army conspiracy against James II, he deserted to William of Orange from Warminster in November 1688 accompanied by his lieutenant-colonel, Charles Churchill, a number of officers, and 200 men. James immediately dismissed him, but he was reinstated by William of Orange on 31 December 1688. Promoted brigadier-general on 6 March 1689, he served in Ireland leading a brigade across the river at Slanebridge to turn the Jacobite left during the battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690. During September he took part in Marlborough's operations against Cork and Kinsale and was promoted to major-general on 2 December 1690. A lifelong tory -- he was elected tory MP for East Looe from 1685 until 1695 and for Plymouth from 1698 to 1710 -- he resigned his colonelcy on 1 January 1692 to his brother Henry in protest at William's favouring of Dutch and German general officers. His decision was made easier by his acquisition of the Hengar estate through marriage on 1 May 1690 to Anne Morice (died 1691), daughter and heiress of Richard Lower MD of Covent Garden, Westminster, and widow of William Morice of Werrington, Devon ('c'.1660-1688). When Thomas Tollemache died following the Brest expedition in 1694, there was a rumour that Trelawney might succeed him as colonel of the Coldstream Guards but this was opposed by the whigs, John Cutts receiving the appointment. In 1696 Trelawney was made governor of Plymouth, a post he held until 1722. He married, on 25 June 1699, Elizabeth Mitchell, daughter of Thomas Mitchell, rector of Notgrove, Gloucestershire, from 1665 until 1686. They had one daughter. He died at Hengar on 24 September 1731 and was buried at Pelynt.

Trelawny, Edward (bap. 1699, d. 1754), colonial governor, was baptized on 9 July 1699 at Trelawne, near Looe, Cornwall, the fourth son of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, third baronet (1650-1721), bishop of Winchester, and his wife, Rebecca Hele (1670-1710), daughter of Thomas Hele of Babcombe, Devon. He was educated at Westminster School, where he was a queen's scholar, from 1713, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 27 June 1717, but did not take a degree. His father had consolidated and extended the Trelawny family's electoral influence in Cornwall, and in 1723 he was returned to parliament as member for West Looe, one of the family boroughs. He supported Sir Robert Walpole's ministry, and was commissioner of victualling from 21 October 1725 until 1732. After Walpole appointed him a commissioner of customs at Edinburgh, he vacated his parliamentary seat in December 1732. He held the Edinburgh position until 1737, but in 1734 he left Scotland to join the British army's campaigns against the French in the War of the Polish Succession. In his absence he was elected MP for East and West Looe, but was disqualified because of his customs position. The next year his brother Sir John Trelawny, bt (1691-1756), transferred the family estates to him in return for Trelawny taking over his brother's debts. To pay the sum Trelawny had to mortgage the Cornish estates to Sir Charles Wager. Details of his first marriage are unknown. His second marriage, on 8 November 1737, was to Amoretta, daughter of John Crawford, with whom he had one son, who died in infancy and was buried with his mother in St Catherine's Church, Jamaica, in November 1741. 
In August 1736 Trelawny was offered the position of governor of Jamaica; he was formally appointed in June 1737, and assumed office on 30 April 1738. Involved in the War of Jenkins's Ear and the War of the Austrian Succession, Trelawny favoured attacks on the Spanish 'guarda-costas' to counter their depredations on English shipping. He raised Jamaican independent companies and slaves for the ill-starred attack on Cartagena in 1741. He accompanied Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon and Brigadier-General Thomas Wentworth in the attack on Panama in 1742, a scheme he backed. In the same year he quarrelled with Rear-Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle over methods of pressing seamen at Jamaica. In 1743 Trelawny was appointed colonel and captain of the 49th regiment of foot in Jamaica. In 1748 he joined Admiral Sir Charles Knowles in the capture of Fort St Louis on Hispaniola. 
Trelawny was a successful governor of Jamaica; even though he had little prior administrative experience, he proved to be a tactful, moderate negotiator with various political factions on the island. He consolidated his governorship as early as 1739, when he agreed a settlement with the maroons that helped to secure internal peace in Jamaica. He avoided serious clashes with the planter-dominated assembly, and usually supported them in their disputes with the judiciary and the council. But he considered that the assembly held too much power and advocated changes to imperial governance, notably that parliament should intervene to resolve squabbles between governors and assemblies. Metropolitan authorities did not pursue this suggestion. 
In 1751 Trelawny asked to be relieved of his governorship on grounds of ill health. He was by this time a wealthy man. He had paid off the mortgage on the Cornish estates by 1744, and in addition to his salary as governor and the revenues of the estates enjoyed payments from the Pelham ministry, whose candidates he regularly returned at East and West Looe. His financial situation was still further improved when he married, on 2 February 1752, Catherine Penny, 'nee' Douce, widow of the former Jamaican attorney-general Robert Penny, from whom she had inherited a fortune estimated at between $30,000 and $40,000 in Jamaican currency. Retirement could now follow. In September 1752 his successor, Charles Knowles, arrived and Trelawny left Jamaica on 25 November. He took with him the gratitude of the house of assembly for his sound administration in Jamaica. Delayed in his homecoming by being shipwrecked off the Isle of Wight, he arrived in London on 28 April 1753. He died at Hungerford Park on 16 January 1754. He bequeathed his Cornwall properties for life to his brother Sir John, and afterwards to Harry Trelawny, his cousin and brother-in-law, who eventually succeeded as fifth baronet.

Trelawny, Edward John (1792-1881), writer and adventurer, was born on 13 November 1792 probably at his grandfather's house at 9 Soho Square, London. His father was Charles Trelawny (1757-1820), formerly a lieutenant colonel in the Coldstream Guards, later MP for Mitchell, who was made rich by the death of a cousin in 1798, and his wife, Mary (or Maria), 'nee' Hawkins (1759-1852). Trelawny later described his father as an oafish brute, but he seems to have been fond of his mother. He had one elder brother, Harry, and four younger sisters. In 'Adventures of a Younger Son' (see below) he reports how, at the age of five, assisted by Harry, he killed, taking some time over the deed, a clip-winged raven, his father's pet, which had scared a small female friend of his. Both boys were sent to the Royal Fort Boarding School, run by the Revd Samuel Seyer in Bristol, from which (as he reports in 'Adventures') Trelawny was expelled for attacking both an under-master and the headmaster, and for attempting to burn the place down, in revenge for the continuous floggings he had received. 
In October 1805 Trelawny joined the navy, in 1806 attended Dr Burney's Navigation School at Gosport (where he was taught no more than he had been in Bristol), and, in various ships, circumnavigated the globe. He took in Mauritius (assisting at its capture from the French), India, Ceylon, the East Indies, Cape Horn, the River Plate, and St Helena. He was wounded in the knee and face in the English attack on Java in August 1811. A musket ball remained in his knee until 1844, when Robert Browning witnessed its removal. He was transferred from ship to ship, guilty (by his own later account) of frequent assaults on his superior officers. He was invalided out of the navy in 1812, a midshipman still, not having been offered a commission. His father gave him an allowance of $300 a year. 
In May 1813 Trelawny married Caroline Julia Addison ('b'. 1794), the nineteen-year-old daughter of an East India merchant. They had two daughters, Maria Julia and Eliza, but in 1816 Caroline left him for her lover, the much older Captain Coleman, and Trelawny divorced her in proceedings which lasted from 1817 to 19 May 1819, and involved much humiliating publicity. Once rid of both unfaithful wife and blighted naval career, he started to read books for the first time, Lord Byron and Shakespeare especially. Byron's heroes fascinated him, as more charismatic and successful versions of himself. 
In autumn 1819 Trelawny accompanied his mother and sisters to Paris. The ladies returned, but he moved on to Geneva, which bored him. He made friends with the retired naval captain Daniel Roberts, who shared his keenness for hunting and fishing. At Ouchy he first read Percy Bysshe Shelley, with whose politics, as revealed in 'Queen Mab', he could identify. At the house of Sir John St Aubyn near Geneva he met Edward Ellerker Williams, and Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin. Very briefly, he encountered the Wordsworths. His father's death in 1820 left him no better off. He returned to England, but was soon back hunting with Roberts in the Alps. 
In 1822, at the invitation of Williams, Trelawny left Geneva for Pisa (he arrived on 14 January), where he met Shelley and Byron, and the two legendary episodes in his life began. Byron liked him both despite, and because of, the fact that he seemed to model his physical image and his doubtful autobiographical tales on those of Conrad, protagonist of Byron's 'Corsair' -- a copy of which he was rumoured to keep beneath his pillow. Trelawny was in fact more attracted to the idealistic Shelley than to the satirical Byron: in Shelley's more overt anti-establishment attitudes he found a theoretical justification for his own juvenile rebelliousness. He became -- retroactively -- a democrat and a republican (one of his great heroes had always been John Paul Jones). 
In the aborted Pisan circle production of 'Othello', Trelawny was to have taken the lead, with Byron as Iago. Mary Shelley found his company delightful, and he escorted her to balls and carnivals. He was present at the Pisan affray on 24 March 1822, when Sergeant-Major Masi knocked Shelley off his horse, though he played no important part in it. (In his old age he would show off a dagger which, he said, a blind beggar had given him to defend himself against Masi.) Byron saw through his fantasizing with ease and amusement: 'Trelawny could not even to save his life tell the truth', he said. However, he admired Trelawny's practical skills. Trelawny arranged, via Daniel Roberts, for the building of the 'Don Juan' (in which Shelley, Williams, and Charles Vivian were to drown) and of Byron's schooner the 'Bolivar'. Byron employed him as its captain. 
Trelawny writes that he was, through his spyglass, the last person to see Shelley and Williams disappear into the squall off Leghorn on 8 July 1822. He took personal charge of the search for their bodies, and planned and carried through the pagan rites in which the disintegrated corpses were cremated, on the shore of Tuscany and at Viareggio, on 15 and 16 August 1822. It was he who snatched Shelley's unburnt heart from the flames. Both Mary Shelley and Jane Williams found him a great comforter at this terrible time. He would sit with them for hours, speaking in praise of their husbands. In April 1823 he organized the removal of Shelley's ashes to the pyramid of Caius Cestius in the protestant cemetery at Rome, the planting of ten trees next to them, and the addition of three lines from Ariel's song in 'The Tempest' ('Nothing of him that doth fade...') to the inscription. 
Trelawny had, on first meeting her on 22 February 1822, fallen in love with Claire Clairmont, Mary Shelley's half-stepsister, the mother of Byron's deceased daughter Allegra. He also had a casual affair with Gabrielle Wright, wife of the 'Bolivar''s designer; but Claire meant much more to him. However, though they may briefly have been lovers, Claire would not marry him, and she left Italy for Austria and then Russia. 
When Byron started on his own terminal Greek adventure, Trelawny was happy to answer the poet's request to go with him. Byron wrote, 'I shall like your company of all things.' They sailed from Genoa on 21 July 1823. Though Trelawny boxed, fenced, and swam with Byron, he would not wear the pretentious Homeric helmet the poet had had designed for him. Once they had arrived in the Ionian Islands, Byron's unwillingness to move annoyed Trelawny, and with James Hamilton Browne he crossed to the mainland on 6 September 1823, with letters of introduction from Byron, to visit the 'seat of Greek government' at Tripolitsa, to investigate the situation as Byron's agent. He was never to see Byron again alive. 
Wearing Greek, not western clothes, he arrived at Tripolitsa, where he met the occidentally-clad Alexander Mavrocordato, whom he at once despised, and the Greek-clad Theodore Colocotrones, whom he admired. Passing through to Corinth, he noted the horrible remains of the victims -- human and animal -- of Colocotrones' victory over the Turks the previous year in the gorge at Dervenakia. Hamilton Browne departed for London to assist in the raising of a loan; at Athens, Trelawny purchased fifteen or so women, and set up a harem, with which, however, he was soon bored. He became an associate of the Greek warlord Odysseus Androutses, whom he was alone in describing as 'a glorious being', and soon became a leader of 'klephts' himself, helping Androutses to storm the Turkish fort at Negroponte (Euboea) without success, and burning several Greek villages without conscience. His capacity for endurance, and indifference to discomfort, endeared him to his men. 
When Byron's death was announced, Trelawny hurried to Missolonghi, to take care of the funeral arrangements again, and was disappointed by the decision to send the poet's remains home. But he did (as he reports) take the opportunity to look into the coffin at Byron's withered limb (or limbs -- he wrote conflicting accounts of what he saw), and wrote letters about his own vital part in the Greek expedition, explaining that it had been he who suggested that Byron should renounce his quiet life in Italy, and go there in the first place. 
After the drama of Byron's death had died down, Trelawny affected to despise his memory. Byron had been 'weak and ignoble', where he, Trelawny, had been decisive and active. He now tried to take control of the Greek situation as he thought Byron ought to have, but only succeeded in making himself unpopular and ridiculous, and soon drifted back into the service of Androutses, even though Androutses was now planning to go over to the Turks. In the well-fortified Mavre Troupa ('Black Hole') cave, high on Parnassus, he married Androutses's half-sister Tersitza, whose age was probably thirteen. Bride and groom had no language in common. 
Androutses was, however, arrested and imprisoned in the Venetian tower on the Acropolis. Trelawny was now in command, though only of the Black Hole. But he was not safe there. On 11 June 1825, one of two of Mavrocordato's agents, William Whitcombe, shot him twice at point blank range, but missed all vital organs. The gun of the other agent, Thomas Fenton, failed to go off. Trelawny's jaw was shattered and his mouth immobilized, but he refused all medical treatment and insisted that nature be allowed to take her course. His body cured itself in five weeks, assisted by small helpings of water and egg yolk. Fenton had been shot dead on the spot; once Trelawny realized he was going to survive, he magnanimously let Whitcombe go. The dead body of Androutses was found soon after at the foot of the Acropolis. 
Emaciated, with his right arm paralysed and three teeth missing, Trelawny left the cave, and was shipped -- with a free passage from Mavrocordato, but without the blessing of the Foreign Office -- back to the Ionian Islands. Tersitza, now pregnant, went with him. On Cefalonia, in June 1826, she bore a daughter, Zella, but on the conception of another child left him to go into a convent. The second child died, and the seventeen-year-old Tersitza managed to divorce Trelawny. He recovered the full use of his right arm, and only a slight hunch remained to tell of what had happened. 
In 1828 Trelawny returned to England, where he proposed marriage to Mary Shelley, who refused him. Also in 1828 he met Claire Clairmont, and proposed to her again, with the same result. In 1829 he decided to go to Florence, where he was joined by all three of his daughters, although Eliza died. He stayed with John Keats's friend Charles Armitage Brown, and met Walter Savage Landor, who put him and Tersitza into one of his 'Imaginary Conversations'. Between 1828 and 1831 he called himself John Edward Trelawny. 
In 1831 Trelawny published, anonymously, his 'autobiography', 'Adventures of a Younger Son', in the style, spelling, and moral editing of which he was assisted by Armitage Brown, Landor, and Mary Shelley. The title was chosen by Mary Shelley and the publisher, Colburn. Each chapter has an epigraph from either Byron, Shelley, or Keats. The book is as imaginative as any poem by Byron (though the early chapters seem trustworthy). There are echoes of 'Don Juan', especially of Canto 2. Trelawny tells of his adventures in the East, and of his 'renegado' career as a French-backed anti-British privateer, led by a Dutch-American, Shakespeare-reading buccaneer called De Ruyter. There are cruel pranks, sea fights, land raids, a shipboard orgy, and a tiger hunt from which only the elephants emerge with credit. Though the protagonist advertises himself as a foe to oppressors, selective oppression is what he excels at. Scotsmen, surgeons, and other human annoyances exist only to be beaten up or dropped into pits of offal, buildings exist only to be burnt or pulled down, and animals only to be hamstrung, shot, or eaten. Remorse is occasionally expressed for the destruction thus caused. There is a teenage heroine called Zela, whom Trelawny marries, and who learns to take violent initiatives by his side. Very little of the material is verifiable or otherwise, and, almost certainly, none of it is true, though Trelawny might have been thrown off balance had such a thing been pointed out at the time. As a self-portrait it is disagreeable; but the book was a great success, and made Trelawny famous at last; it was said that Byron had modelled Conrad, and even Manfred, on him. 
In January 1832 Trelawny sailed to America, in search of adventure, but found none. He met Fenimore Cooper, and John Philip and Fanny Kemble, with whom he visited Niagara, where he swam the rapids, in emulation of Byron's more numerous swimming feats. He became very fond of Fanny Kemble, but she was engaged already. He also met and admired the great engineer Christian Detmold. He visited New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston, but despite the celebrity status he enjoyed, became bored and disillusioned, and returned to England early in 1835. 
Back in England Trelawny found no role. His fame continued, although his dabbling in chic radical politics did him no good. He was friendly with Bulwer, Brougham, and Mrs Jameson, frequented Lady Blessington's dinners, and figures as the Byronic story-telling bore Captain Sumph in William Makepeace Thackeray's 'Pendennis', and as the heroic Borromeo in William Godwin's 'Cloudesley'. When Mary Shelley brought out her first edition of her husband's poems in 1839, Trelawny was outraged at the cuts she made -- especially in the notes for 'Queen Mab' -- and their friendship ceased. 
In 1839 Trelawny retired from society and lived in Putney, a self-proclaimed vegetarian, teetotaller, and eschewer of both underwear and overcoats. He had in 1838 started the longest relationship of his life, with Augusta, the separated wife of Harry, the future Lord Goring. She was a friend of Mary Shelley. On 5 August 1839 she bore him a son, Edgar (called, to avoid scandal, John Granby). Harry Goring obtained a divorce in 1841. Trelawny and Augusta married, a daughter, Laetitia, was born, and they moved to Usk in Monmouthshire, where Trelawny first built a house and then bought a nearby farm, which he worked with skill and industry, becoming a valued member of the community. Another son, Frank, was born. His Greek daughter Zella, now Mrs Olguin, sometimes came over from Italy. The family lived happily together until 1858, when Trelawny started a liaison with a teenage girl whose identity seems irrecoverable (she was known as Miss B). Augusta left him and went to Italy, and Trelawny took Miss B to London, where she was to be replaced in turn by another young woman called Emma Taylor. 
In 1858 Trelawny published 'Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron', and in 1878 a rewritten version, the more confidently entitled 'Records of Shelley, Byron and the Author'. In the earlier work he gives Byron two clubbed feet, but in the later, just one shrivelled Achilles tendon. However, these narratives brought him fame all over again, and made him a favourite among the Victorians, who found in him a link to the mighty dead whose early reputations for freethinking and free living they had sanitized. His portrait of Shelley, especially, was recognized as more accurate than the cleaned-up versions produced by the colleagues of Lady Shelley, daughter-in-law to Percy Bysshe. Both his books of reminiscence may, with cross-checking, be used as reliable and vivid first-hand accounts. Trelawny's insistence on Shelley's republicanism and atheism was accepted with tolerance. He was introduced to Benjamin Disraeli. 'Adventures of a Younger Son' had been reprinted, to acclaim, its confession of Trelawny's 'desertion' from the navy ignored. Even his most readily disprovable assertion -- that he had known Keats -- went unchallenged. The positive reading of his character, which made his eccentricity evidence of his sincerity and strength, won the day. Like Teresa Guiccioli (Byron's last mistress), he had come to believe his own fabricated version of the past, but, unlike Teresa Guiccioli, he persuaded the world to believe it too. 
Trelawny's last years were spent at 7 Pelham Crescent, Brompton, and in a house at Sompting, near Worthing. He died at Sompting on 13 August 1881. In accordance with his wishes, his corpse was transported to Gotha, Germany, where it was cremated, and his ashes were taken by Emma Taylor to Rome, where they were buried in the protestant cemetery in the plot, next to Shelley's, which he had purchased in 1823. 
Trelawny had an imposing, 6 foot physical presence, with dark piercing eyes, tanned Arab features (according to Mary Shelley's description), a long, curling moustache, a deep and gentle though monotonous voice, and an extremely powerful constitution. Robert Browning reports that he endured the extraction of the bullet from his knee with all the equanimity of a man having his hair cut. His sense of humour was rough, not sophisticated. Irony both eluded and defeated him. To both accurate spelling and personal hygiene he was a stranger. In Greece especially, he saw tolerance of dirt and lice as a manly thing, and, although mild dyslexia may be suspected (he often spelt his own name Jhon), his supposed orthographical incompetence may in later years have formed part of a calculated image. His egotism was huge, as was his capacity for revengeful violence, of which he was proud. He despised those who endured suffering meekly. But he was capable of great generosity. 
There are portraits of Trelawny by W. E. West and Joseph Severn, and sketches by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, E. Duppa, Count d'Orsay, Severn, and Seymour Kirkup. Trelawny figures in 'The Cremation of Shelley's Body' by Fournier and Gerome (he assisted the painters with detailed notes, which they mostly ignored), and as the old man in 'The North-West Passage' by Millais. Several photographs were taken in his old age. 
Edward John Trelawny was his own worst enemy in the story of the English Romantic movement. If he had not embroidered his role in such confused and dubious ways, he would be known correctly for what he was: one of its most significant and colourful ancillaries.

Trelawny, Sir John (d. 1433x47), landowner and soldier, was the son of John Trelawny of Trelawny, Cornwall, and his wife, Maud, daughter of Robert Menwenick. It is not easy to distinguish the son from either the father or another, junior, John Trelawny, who may in fact have been the second John's younger brother. All three were members of parliament for Cornish constituencies, the father representing Bodmin in 1397, and the youngest John sitting for Liskeard in 1421 and for Lostwithiel in 1449. But the second John Trelawny was twice knight of the shire for Cornwall in 1421, and probably also in 1413, and by the end of 1414 had been elected coroner in that county. He also served in France, in 1415 (when he probably fought at Agincourt) in the retinue of Edward, Lord Courtenay, and in 1417 under the duke of Exeter. On 27 September 1419, no longer coroner, but with the style of 'king's knight', he was granted an annuity of $20 per annum by Henry V, later confirmed by Henry VI. He added three oak or laurel leaves to his arms, while the figure of Henry V, which once stood over the west gate of Launceston, is said to have had at its feet the inscription: 'He that will do aught for mee, Let hym love well Sir John Tirlawnee' (Polsue, 3.89). Sir John was still receiving his annuity in 1432, and in the following year made arrangements for the descent of some of his Cornish lands. With his wife Agnes, daughter of Robert Tregoddick, he had perhaps two sons, and also two daughters. He was dead by 1447, while his presumed younger brother and namesake lived until at least 1465.

Trelawny, Sir Jonathan, third baronet (1650-1721), bishop of Winchester, was the second of the six surviving sons of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, second baronet (died 1681) and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Edward Seymour of Berry Pomeroy, Devon. He was born on 24 March 1650 at Trelawne, Pelynt, Cornwall, and baptized in Pelynt parish church on 26 April. 
Both Trelawny's father and paternal grandfather had been royalists in arms in the first civil war, a commitment which cost the family dear in the long run. They compounded for their estates but were additionally charged with paying compensation to the parliamentarian Buller family to the tune of $1200. The family were burdened with debts not only during their lives but also after Jonathan Trelawny succeeded to the title of third baronet in 1681. His father was also imprisoned several times during the interregnum but kept up a correspondence with Charles II in exile. 
Immediate royal favour at the Restoration began to repair the family's fortunes: Trelawny's father became a gentleman of the privy chamber on 5 June 1660, four years before he inherited the baronetcy. Financial embarrassment did not prevent Trelawny from receiving a good education: he went to Westminster School in 1663 and on to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1668. At the latter he came under the influence of Dr William Jane, with whom he would remain close, an uncompromising defender of the restored Church of England. Trelawny graduated BA on 22 June 1672 and MA on 29 April 1675. 
The Trelawnys emerged as a military gentry family with clear Yorkist affiliations, and Trelawny was the only one among his brothers not to choose a career in the army or the navy. His father was comptroller of the duke of York's household between 1670 and 1674 and served as lieutenant-colonel in the duke of York's regiment of horse until it was disbanded in 1679. His family's dependence on York's favour must have been a complicating factor for Trelawny personally when loyalties became divided after 1685, but in the short term the connection with York promised well for his career prospects. He was appointed a royal chaplain-extraordinary in 1677, less than a year after his ordination as a priest on Christmas eve 1676. Charles II hurried to grant him the living of Calstock in Cornwall, only to discover that it had already been granted to someone else. Instead he was given the rectory of St Ive on 22 September 1677 and his father presented him to the family living of South Hill, to which Bishop Lamplugh instituted him on 4 October. Unfortunately the parsonages of both were in ruins and in need of rebuilding: young Trelawny lived at the family seat of Trelawne, more than 10 miles away from both, and irritated the bishop by seeking a third living -- that of Dartington -- to make up for the deficiencies of the first two. His plea was refused. Instead, he took on the role of chaplain to Lord Conway. 
Much of the next eight years would be taken up with a futile search for further preferment, a search made more urgent when Trelawny inherited his father's debts along with his title in March 1681, following his elder brother's death in October 1680. He lapsed into self-pity and self-dramatization, writing to John Ellis in August 1682: 'the King hath not a gentleman he can entirely confide in but myself, & yet he gives me neither money nor preferment to bear up with against my debts (contracted in the service of the crown)' (Smith, 18). Instead of devoting his energies to the church, an increasing amount of Trelawny's time was spent in the secular government of Cornwall, inspecting his father's old militia troop and succeeding him in his role of vice-admiral of south Cornwall in February 1682, as well as being named on the commission of the peace. He comes across more in this period as a gentry governor of his shire than as any sort of spiritual leader. With his unashamed swearing, his love of good living, and his lack of serious scholarship, it is little wonder that his career in a church led by Archbishop Sancroft was slow to progress. On 31 March 1684, he married the fourteen-year-old Rebecca Hele (1670-1710), daughter of Thomas Hele of Babcombe, Devon, with whom he had a large family. Among their sons was Edward Trelawny, governor of Jamaica. 
Trelawny's fortunes only began to improve after his family's erstwhile patron, the duke of York, succeeded to the throne as James II in February 1685. Trelawny was not slow to demonstrate his loyalty, soliciting Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys for nominations for seats in parliament, over which he had an influence, even before he was asked; and when Monmouth's rebellion broke out he was notably efficient in mobilizing the Cornish militia, with the help of only one other deputy lieutenant (the rest proving recalcitrant), for which the earl of Sunderland wrote to congratulate him. However, his reward, when it came, fell far below his expectations -- the poor bishopric of Bristol. He made no attempt to hide his disappointment, even begging Sunderland to influence the king to change his mind. But it was to no avail and he was consecrated at Lambeth on 8 November 1685, by two archbishops and six bishops then in London to attend parliament. 
Despite his misgivings about his new appointment Trelawny was keen to prove himself both as an effective diocesan and as a loyal servant of the king. He achieved the first objective, holding a successful visitation of Bristol Cathedral in January-February 1686, winning over the dean, William Lovett. His primary visitation of Dorset at Easter also went well, gaining Sancroft's warm approval for his injunctions, and his demand that communion tables be set 'altar-wise' at the east end and railed off seems to have been enforced even in Dorchester, despite its long puritan and nonconformist tradition. He also, at this stage, managed to stay in step with royal policy, emphasizing the ill consequences of anti-popish preaching in his visitation charge. However, by 1687 this particular balancing act was proving much harder to sustain and Trelawny found himself increasingly drawn into the episcopal opposition to the king's policies. When called upon by Sunderland to sign an address of thanks for the declaration of indulgence granting toleration to dissenters and Roman Catholics in April 1687, and to promote it among his clergy, his response was equivocal and ultimately disingenuous. Having done nothing for three weeks he communicated to his Bristol clergy, via Dr Jane, that he would not sign the address personally; but when, at a meeting with them, they followed his lead and also demurred, he wrote to Sunderland, claiming that it was their reluctance which had prompted him to refrain from signing. Of the Dorset clergy, only two signed. The king was furious at the disobedience. 
Gradually Trelawny became more courageous in his opposition, giving a living to one of the fellows ejected from Magdalen College, Oxford, in December 1687, in clear defiance of the ecclesiastical commissioners' express order. And finally in May 1688 he supported the petition of Sancroft and five other bishops against the order to read the declaration of indulgence in churches and so found himself one of the famous seven bishops who were prosecuted by the angry king. In their tense interview with James II, when he charged them with issuing a trumpet of rebellion, Trelawny fell to his knees and made a self-justifying speech. James found this merely saucy but Trelawny's behaviour sounds more like the 'cri de coeur' of a man facing an unbearable tension between his family's traditional royalism and his own commitment to the Church of England. His acquittal along with the others must have been a huge relief and Trelawny responded by paying more than his fair share of the legal costs. 
That summer was in many ways Trelawny's finest hour: a moment of moral courage and heroism in a life otherwise marked by self-seeking and conformity. He had every reason to believe that his opposition to the king's policy would be costly to him personally, and he had no way of anticipating the course events would subsequently take. However, a number of myths have grown up around his role in 1688. The 'Song of the Western Men' in support of him at the time of the trial (which Macaulay quotes: 'And shall Trelawney die') probably had nothing to do with him and allegations of his complicity with William of Orange at this time are also, almost certainly, false. James II was probably right to believe as late as mid-November, when he appointed him bishop of Exeter, that Trelawny was still basically loyal to him. On 25 November, when Trelawny's brother Charles, a senior army officer, defected to the prince, Trelawny sent an assurance of his own loyalty to the king, via Bishop Francis Turner, which may well have been sincere. 
Military and political realities, however, soon supervened. On 5 December, while Trelawny was at Bristol, the earl of Shrewsbury arrived with a regiment of foot and a letter from the prince of Orange. Trelawny replied cautiously to the latter, expressing approval for the steps taken to secure the protestant religion and the laws and liberties of England. James's flight and in particular his jettisoning of the great seal sabotaged, at least temporarily, Trelawny's translation to Exeter, but he resisted the direction in which political events inexorably moved thereafter. On 31 January and early in February 1689 he voted against the notion that James II had abdicated and against the offer of the crown to William and Mary. However, he stopped short of rejecting the subsequent settlement, took the oaths, and reflected afterwards: 'we thought ourselves obliged to accept the deliverance brought us' (Smith, 58). He seems to have assumed that James II would be implacable to him personally and on that basis was consistently hostile to Jacobitism. Nevertheless, preaching at a thanksgiving service before Queen Anne and both houses of parliament in 1702, in a sermon focusing on national deliverances, he mentioned the Restoration but not the revolution. A reference to 'eighty-eight' turns out to be alluding to the defeat of the Spanish armada in 1588, rather than more contentious events a hundred years later (Trelawny, 30). 
Perhaps somewhat surprisingly the new sovereigns endorsed and expedited Trelawny's translation to Exeter and he was down in the diocese conducting his primary visitation by August 1689. If Trelawny had been a somewhat incongruous member of the episcopal bench in the Sancroft era, he hardly fitted any better into that of Tillotson and Tenison, although for different reasons. Though appointed to the commission to revise the liturgy in the interests of comprehension in 1689, he took no part in its proceedings and later opposed informal moves designed to placate dissent. He was a staunch defender of church courts and episcopal discipline: in 1704, he wanted convocation (whose revival he fully supported) to censure bishops for neglecting their disciplinary powers. He jealously guarded his episcopal rights, going to law lengthily and expensively several times in the course of the 1690s, especially to uphold his right to regulate education in a number of different spheres. And he was implacably opposed to new developments such as the societies for the reformation of manners, which seemed to undermine the Church of England's status as the guardian of the nation's morals. 
Trelawny has gone down in history as a time-server, promoted through the episcopate to the highest level for political services to his masters. This is partly attributable to an acid comment from Gilbert Burnet, a long-standing rival and enemy, that his promotion to the bishopric of Winchester in 1706 was due in part to the electoral interest which he had in west country boroughs. It was certainly remarkable to see an unreconstructed high-church bishop like Trelawny, patron of Atterbury and the convocation movement as he was, becoming a diehard adherent of the increasingly whiggish Marlborough-Godolphin ministry right down to its fall in 1710. But a purely cynical interpretation of this development needs to be put into some sort of context. For one thing, Trelawny was a long-standing friend of the Churchills and of Godolphin before their rise to power. For another, he was genuinely committed to their central policy of energetically prosecuting the war with France, as he showed by the hawkish tone of his thanksgiving sermon of 1702, for all its apparent lack of enthusiasm for the revolution itself ('A Sermon Preach'd before the Queen'). As bishop of Exeter he had a good record of working with whig clergy across party lines for the good of the church. And, ironically, the move to Winchester made it more difficult for Trelawny to maintain his electoral interest in Cornwall. Beyond this, he did not make his peace with the new tory ministry led by Harley until 1712, quite a long delay for a supposed vicar of Bray, and his subsequent commitment to the Hanoverian succession has all the hallmarks of sincerity. 
Nevertheless, Trelawny's status as a borough-monger is not in doubt. He built on his existing family interest and in 1702 boasted, not implausibly, to have had a hand in the return of eleven MPs. Nor can it be doubted that Trelawny could be quite ruthless in defence of his interest, using not only his role as a diocesan but also family connections to extend it. In 1716 he even forced his reluctant daughter Rebecca to marry the disfigured John Buller, in order to extend his influence to the borough of Saltash. 
Trelawny's reputation for time-serving has undoubtedly been enhanced by the tone of his correspondence with those in power, which tended to be effusive to the point of flattery. It can be traced as far back as a letter to the earl of Rochester in 1683 and remained a feature of his surviving letters to the end of his life. That it was not purely self-seeking may be inferred from the fact that it was applied equally to long-standing friends and colleagues, like Marlborough and Archbishop Wake, as well as to powerful men with whom he was not previously acquainted. But it certainly sounds craven. 
The demands of maintaining a large electoral interest, in a time of frequent polls and spiralling electoral costs, may in part provide the answer to another puzzle about Trelawny: that the proceeds of the enormously lucrative see of Winchester failed to solve his family's financial problems. In the 1690s Trelawny had been financially too embarrassed to incur the additional cost of attending parliament on a regular basis; in 1710 he was still known to be in difficulties, and in 1713 he was compelled to remortgage all his family estates for $9000. He died intestate and after his death nearly $16,000 had to be raised from the sale of Trelawny estates to pay off debts. Yet in his last eight years at Winchester it has been estimated that he must have netted some $25,000, which was brought in by the systematic exploitation of the proceeds of the bishopric, seriously alienating the bulk of its customary tenants. His business manager, Charles Heron, had made a significant start in this area before 1713 and his successor, Edward Forbes, merely continued as Heron had begun. 
Again the context of Trelawny's action provides some excuse. The resources of the bishopric had been notably under-exploited, even spoiled, in the final years of his predecessor, Peter Mews, in the opening years of the eighteenth century. And by the time of Trelawny's death at least, other bishops and capitular bodies were beginning to exploit their possessions in a similar way. Maintaining his electoral interest was not the only financial burden on Trelawny at this time. He had a large family to provide for -- thirteen children, of whom eleven survived. He did his best for several of them, using the offices which were in his gift as bishop, a nepotism different only in scale from that practised by episcopal colleagues. 
Looked at positively, Trelawny could be generous to a fault: his paying more than his share of the legal costs arising from the seven bishops' trial in 1688 was typical, as was his offer to pay for the fitting out of the interior of the meeting-place for the lower house of convocation, though in the latter case, the offer was declined. Negatively, Trelawny could be a spendthrift, building a new chapel at Trelawne, laying out new gardens at his palace at Winchester, and installing a huge episcopal throne in the cathedral there. 
No early portrait of Trelawny survives, but a late one (post-1706) is, in its way, quite revealing. He wears the robes of a prelate of the Garter (a role he fulfilled 'ex officio' as bishop of Winchester), trappings which he had been particularly keen to acquire on his translation. His nose is straight, the mouth generous but not over-large. Regarding the viewer with a somewhat superior gaze, he has all the air of a gentleman about town, rather than a minister of the church. There was throughout his life a certain incongruity between Trelawny's personal style and the spiritual offices he held, an incongruity felt even during his lifetime. It was savagely satirized in a work called 'The Tribe of Levi', which dubbed him 'Fighting Joshua' and dismissed him as a 'spiritual dragoon' (Strickland, 384). This work focuses on his role in the suppression of Monmouth's rebellion but it could equally have picked out other distinctly unclerical aspects of his life and career, such as his bluntness in speech and in letter writing. His high theology of the apostolic succession sat rather oddly with his very pragmatic attitude to the exploitation of the proceeds of ecclesiastical office for both laudable and questionable purposes. 
It is too simple to see Trelawny as a conservative overtaken by changing times; he was in many ways 'sui generis' even as a bishop under James II and later as bishop of Winchester he was somewhat ahead of his time, in terms of the vigour with which he exploited the resources of his see and challenged the customary rights of his tenants. His churchmanship and theological views were certainly backward-looking, lifelong campaigner for Laudian-style altars and traditional orthodoxy as he was. He was nevertheless every inch an eighteenth-century borough-monger. 
Trelawny died suddenly at his residence in Chelsea on 19 July 1721. His body was moved with great pomp on Thursday 3 August down to Cornwall for interment in the family vault at Pelynt church (where he had been baptized) on 10 August 1721.

Sir William Trelawny, sixth baronet (1722/3-1772), colonial governor and naval officer, was the first son of Captain William Trelawny, Edward Trelawny's first cousin, and his wife, Mary, eldest daughter of William Bisset of Westminster. Educated at Westminster School, where he was admitted in 1733 aged ten, William married his cousin Laetitia (died 1772), daughter and heir of Sir Harry Trelawny, at some time in or before 1755. They had two children, Harry Trelawny (bap. 1756, d. 1834) and Laetitia Anne (died 1845), who married Paul Trehy Ourry MP. William joined the navy early in life, and was appointed lieutenant in 1743, master and commander in 1754, and post captain in 1756. He served in the navy during the Seven Years' War, and was MP for East and West Looe from 16 May 1757 until June 1767. He succeeded Sir Harry Trelawny as baronet in 1762. As head of the Trelawny interest he uneasily co-operated with his cousin James Buller, whose influence in the Looe seats was increasing. In the Commons he usually supported the government of the day. He vacated his seat on being appointed governor of Jamaica, a position he held from 1768 to 1772. Though he knew little about Jamaica before taking up his appointment, he earned the respect of the creole elite in that island for steering a sensible political course at a time when the assembly and council of Jamaica were frequently at loggerheads. He died at Spanish Town from a fever on 11 December 1772, a few months after his wife, who had died on 24 August; the assembly voted him a public funeral at a cost of 1000 guineas, which took place on 13 December 1772 in Spanish Town. The Jamaican parish of Trelawny was named after him.

Tremayne, Edmund (c.1525-1582), administrator and conspirator, was the second son of Thomas Tremayne, gentleman, of Collacombe, Devon, and Philippa, daughter of Roger Grenville of Stow. Nothing is known of his early life. Late in 1553 he entered the service of Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, and was sent to the Tower in February or March of 1554 on suspicion of involvement in Wyatt's rebellion. Despite torture, he refused to provide evidence against either Courtenay or the Princess Elizabeth. Released on 18 January 1555 on payment of a fine of $40, he followed Courtenay to the continent where the earl established a household in Venice by mid-January 1556. Tremayne, however, left Courtenay's service soon after, probably as a consequence of his master's refusal to enter more actively into the conspiracies against Mary organized from France by Sir Henry Dudley. Tremayne's brother Nicholas was deeply involved in the conspiracy and had carried proposals from Dudley to Courtenay in Italy, meeting the earl in Ferrara on 21 March 1556, together with Francis Russell, earl of Bedford. However, Courtenay would not commit irrevocably to the conspiracy by joining the rebels. 
It is likely that Edmund Tremayne returned with his brother to Paris, where he is recorded by 13 July 1556, but soon after departed for the English rebel camp at Rouen. Despite their adherence to the rebels and their presence in Paris in April 1557 in the company of Christopher Assheton, a leader in the Dudley conspiracy, and the Staffords, neither Edmund nor his brothers followed Thomas Stafford in his assault on Scarborough Castle later that month. Almost simultaneously, the betrayal of the Dudley conspiracy (April 1557) resulted in the dissolution of the rebel faction in France. It is likely that it was at this time that Edmund Tremayne joined the household of the earl of Bedford, who is documented in Calais on 26 July 1557. 
The accession of Elizabeth brought Tremayne quick preferment from both Bedford and the queen. He was returned to parliament in 1559 for Tavistock, and appointed deputy butler for Devon in 1561 through the patronage of Bedford who had been named lord lieutenant. Between 1561 and 1574 he served as receiver in nine counties for the duchy of Lancaster, in which office his deputy was Humphrey Michell; Michell, a former servant to Edward Courtenay and a servant to Francis Russell, earl of Bedford, also sat several times in the Commons. William Cecil sent Tremayne to report on Ireland in 1569, and he subsequently wrote a report entitled 'Causes why Ireland is not Reformed'. In May 1571 he was sworn clerk of the privy council. In 1572 he was returned MP for Plymouth, and on 13 March he inherited his family's estates on the death of his elder brother Roger. He remained interested in the Irish situation, visiting the island again in 1573; and in 1574 he was granted by the city of Exeter the reversion of Sir Gawen Carew's pension of $40, and was serving as receiver of exchequer revenues for Devon. In that year he also undertook substantial renovations to his house at Collacombe. 
Tremayne married in September 1576 Eulalia, daughter of Sir John St Leger ('c'.1516-1593x6) of Annery, Devon; she outlived him. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, and a son, Francis (died 1582), named for his patron, Bedford. In religion Edmund was an adherent of the west-country puritan faction. Much of his political activity was directed towards local issues. He was in 1576 involved in a parliamentary committee on ports, and was appointed piracy commissioner for Devon in 1577. In 1580 he was made a freeman of Plymouth. The close connection between Tremayne and his cousin Sir Francis Drake is reflected in the queen's instructions to Tremayne to register the treasure unloaded from the 'Golden Hind' in October 1580. Charged to investigate the allegations of cruelty made against Drake by the Spanish ambassador, Tremayne found his cousin innocent. 
Tremayne died in September 1582, at Collacombe, just weeks before his son. The earl of Bedford oversaw his will. His estates passed to his brother Degory, who erected a monument to five of his brothers, Roger, Edmund, Richard ['see below'], and the twins Andrew and Nicholas. Both the latter had been involved in conspiracy against Mary, and Andrew was implicated with Sir Peter Carew and Sir Anthony Kingston; both brothers were killed at Newhaven in 1563. Edmund's effigy provides an image of the man late in life. 


Named archdeacon of Chichester in April 1559, that summer Tremayne accompanied James Hamilton, third earl of Arran, in secrecy to England from Geneva. In October 1559 he was restored to his fellowship at Oxford, and in January 1560 Bishop Grindal of London ordained him deacon; the following month he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. In addition he held several church livings in Cornwall and Devon. His continued absence from Oxford resulted in his losing his fellowship at Exeter College, and in February 1565 he migrated to Broadgates Hall. One year later, on 15 February 1566, he took the degree of BTh, followed on 26 April by that of DTh. On 19 September 1569 Tremayne married Joanna, daughter of Sir Piers Courtenay of Ugbrooke, who outlived him. They had a daughter, Mary, who became wife of Thomas Henslowe. 
Richard Tremayne, like his brother Edmund, was a client of the earl of Bedford, who in 1570 recommended him unsuccessfully for the see of Exeter. He sat in convocation for Exeter and endorsed the 'Thirty-Nine Articles', speaking in favour of substantial revision to the prayer book, reflecting his puritan commitment. He had troubled relations with his bishop, William Bradbridge, over the licensing of an unfit puritan preacher and accusations of nepotism. Richard Tremayne was buried on 30 November 1584 at Lamerton.

Tremayne, Sir John (bap. 1647, d. 1694), lawyer and politician, was baptized at Mevagissey, Cornwall, on 16 September 1647, the eldest son of Colonel Lewis Tremayne ('bap'. 1619, died 1685) of Heligan, St Ewe, Cornwall, and Mary (died 1701/2), daughter and coheir of John Carew of Penwarne, Mevagissey. He entered the Inner Temple on 8 December 1666, transferring to the Middle Temple on 30 October 1669, and being called to the bar on 9 May 1673. He must have quickly built up an impressive legal practice because in 1680 he was one of the leading king's bench barristers. No doubt this legal success allowed him to marry, on 13 April 1680, Frances ('bap'. 1655, died 1683), daughter of William Davie, a barrister, of Creedy, Devon, a union which produced one son who died young. It also explains a volume of 'entries, declarations, and pleadings' from the reigns of Charles II and James II which he collected (BL, Lansdowne MS 1142). In 1685 Tremayne succeeded his father to Heligan, and over the next few years embarked on a building programme which saw a new house erected on the site. Later generations of the family were responsible for developing the gardens at Heligan, which are now a notable attraction ['see 'Tremayne family]. 
The revolution of 1688 gave a further boost to Tremayne's career. On 4 May 1689 he was made a king's serjeant, which increased his legal practice, and he appeared frequently as a counsel before the House of Lords between 1689 and 1693. In May 1689 he was also made a serjeant-at-law, and he was knighted on 31 October. In 1690 he was elected to parliament as a whig for Tregony, but this served only to enhance his legal reputation, as he combined speech-making in the Commons with advocacy in Westminster Hall. He acted as counsel for Richard Graham, Viscount Preston, and others, on trial for treason in January 1691, and for Sir John Germaine in the action for damages brought by the duke of Norfolk; and he prosecuted Lord Mohun for the murder of William Mountfort, the actor, in January 1693. In June 1692 he failed in an attempt to be elected recorder of London, but in the following year he petitioned for, and was granted, the stewardships of several hundred courts in Cornwall. 
The exact date of Tremayne's death has not been ascertained, but he made his will on 10 February 1694 and his death was noted on the 20th by Narcissus Luttrell. He was buried in the Temple Church, London, on the 23rd. In 1723 his 'Placita coronae, or, Pleas of the Crown in Matters Criminal and Civil' was published, 'digested and revised by the late John Rice of Furnival's Inn'. An English translation by Thomas Vickers in two volumes was published in Dublin in 1793.

Richard Tremayne (c.1530-1584), Church of England clergyman, was born in Devon, the fourth son of Thomas Tremayne and his wife, Philippa Grenville. He graduated BA from Exeter College, Oxford, in 1548 and was elected a fellow on 28 March 1553, proceeding MA on 17 July of that year. The accession of Mary drove Tremayne to flee to Louvain with his pupil, the son of Sir Nicholas Arnold. Early in 1556 he returned to England where he appears to have acted as an agent for the Dudley conspiracy, together with his brother Nicholas. Although discovered, both men escaped to France where they were joined by their elder brother Edmund. Soon afterwards Richard set out for Strasbourg, perhaps as an agent with Arthur Saule to try to convince John Brett to remain on the continent and not perform the queen's commission of searching out the exiles. Failing in that mission, Tremayne returned to France until the reign of Elizabeth.

Tremellius, (Joannes) Immanuel (1510-1580), Hebrew and biblical scholar, was born in Ferrara, Italy, in 1510. His parents were Jews, and he had at least one brother. In Ferrara he received a traditional Jewish education as well as a humanist training in Latin and Greek, and, when he was twenty, proceeded to the University of Padua. There he met Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (the future Pope Paul III), who had him to stay in Rome and visited his father's house in Ferrara. In Padua too he made the acquaintance of Cardinal Reginald Pole and his circle, and was attracted by their beliefs which have come to be known as evangelism. Although Pole remained loyal to the papacy, he and his friends had marked sympathies with the doctrine of justification by faith which had been propagated by Luther. To this seemingly conciliatory form of Catholicism Tremellius converted. He was baptized in Pole's house in Padua in 1540, with Pole himself as his godfather. 
The man who was to play the most important part in Tremellius's life was not Pole but a member of his circle, Pietro Martire Vermigli (Peter Martyr), to whom Tremellius may have given Hebrew lessons in Padua. In the summer of 1541 Vermigli, who had in the meantime become prior of the Augustinian canons in Lucca, invited Tremellius to join him and teach Hebrew at the monastic school he had just reorganized. In the society of Vermigli and a number of other distinguished citizens of Lucca, Tremellius moved steadily closer to protestantism. He also issued his first scholarly work, the 'Meditamenta', published in Wittenberg in 1541. In August 1542, after Pope Paul III had introduced the inquisition, Vermigli fled. He subsequently accepted the hospitality of the reformer Martin Bucer in Strasbourg and was soon joined by Tremellius. At this point both men had converted to Reformed protestantism, to which Tremellius was to remain uncompromisingly loyal until his death. 
Later Tremellius looked back on his first Strasbourg years as one of the happiest times of his life. He taught Hebrew grammar at the high school founded by Jacob Sturm, with Vermigli as his colleague for 'Old Testament' history. After the traditional trial period of one year he received a permanent appointment. He also met some of the leading reformers. He remained devoted to Bucer, and in the summer of 1543 was introduced to Calvin and Guillaume Farel, two more men who were to be his friends for the rest of their lives. In October 1544 he married a member of the French community, Elisabeth de Grimecieux, a widow from Metz. She already had one daughter from her marriage with Grimecieux, and with Tremellius she was to have a further daughter and a son. 
In April 1547 the situation in Strasbourg started to change with the defeat of the protestant forces, the Schmalkaldic League, by the emperor, Charles V. It now appeared that Catholicism might be reimposed in Germany, and Tremellius again looked for a job elsewhere. Backed by Calvin and Farel, he sought employment in Switzerland in November 1547, but could find nothing. Shortly after, however, Tremellius, like Vermigli, received an invitation to England from the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer. Before the year was out they were both staying with their respective families at Lambeth Palace in Surrey. 
Tremellius's memories of his stay with Cranmer were just as fond as those of Strasbourg. In April 1549 he was joined by two other refugees from Strasbourg, Bucer and the Hebraist Paul Fagius, and he described the archbishop's court as 'a school, or an arena, of piety and learning' (Tremellius, 6). There he started to write his commentary on the book of 'Hosea' (which he would complete and publish many years later). But his main ambition was an academic post. Late in 1549, while Vermigli was sent to Oxford and created regius professor of divinity, Tremellius, with Bucer and Fagius, was dispatched to Cambridge. He succeeded Fagius as 'king's reader of Hebrew' after Fagius's death on 13 November. 
At Cambridge Tremellius made the acquaintance of Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, and developed a lifelong friendship with her two tutors, Matthew Parker, to whose third son he acted as godfather, and her French tutor, a protestant immigrant from Normandy, Anthony Chevallier. Chevallier, who married Elisabeth de Grimecieux, Tremellius's stepdaughter, on 1 December 1550, started on his own distinguished career as a teacher of Hebrew by assisting his father-in-law in his lectures. Tremellius taught with enthusiasm, prepared even to provide tuition free of charge, and it was while he was at Cambridge that he translated the Geneva catechism into Hebrew in the hope of converting other Jews to Christianity. On 24 October 1552 he was granted a prebend in the diocese of Carlisle. 
The accession of Queen Mary in July 1553 put an end to the aspirations of Tremellius and his fellow refugees in England. Together with his family, which now included Anthony Chevallier, Tremellius returned to the continent. He stopped in Brussels, hoping to enlist the support of his former protector and godfather Reginald Pole, but the cardinal had no time for apostates. Again like Vermigli, Tremellius returned to Strasbourg. Here, however, the confessional circumstances had altered. Lutheranism was strong, and acceptance of the Augsburg confession a condition for an academic post. Tremellius refused. He then fell back on the support of Calvin, but discovered once more how strong opposition to Calvin and his proteges could be. Having failed to keep a post in Bern or even to obtain one in Lausanne (where he also had the backing of Beza and Viret), Tremellius repaired to Geneva in September 1554 to stay with Calvin. He there received an offer of employment: at the suggestion of his councillor, the jurist Ulrich Sitzinger, the Count Palatine Wolfgang, duke of Zweibrucken, invited him to Germany to act as tutor to his children. Tremellius reached Zweibrucken in November 1554. 
The duke, an admirer of Melanchthon, soon regarded Tremellius as indispensable. He refused to let him go when Calvin tried to appoint him professor of 'Old Testament' at the newly founded academy of Geneva, and in December 1558 dispatched him to Hornbach in the hope of turning the former convent school into a high school resembling Sturm's foundation in Strasbourg. Despite his dissatisfaction with the job, Tremellius remained headmaster until 7 March 1561. Shortly before his departure, in January he was sent to Orleans to take part in negotiations concerning the rights of the Huguenots in Metz. 
On 4 March 1561 Tremellius had received a summons from the Calvinist elector palatine Frederick III to the University of Heidelberg. First he was entrusted with another mission to France, and it was not until the summer that he could start working at the university. He matriculated on 23 June 1561 after receiving a doctorate in divinity, and was enrolled a member of the academic senate on 9 July. His career at Heidelberg was glorious. He was twice rector; his lectures on Hebrew were enthusiastically attended (his pupils included the French scholar Philippe du Plessis Mornay); and he at last had time to devote himself to scholarship. In 1562 he edited Bucer's lectures which he had heard and copied out in England. In 1563 he published the commentary on 'Hosea' he had started in England. After spending six months with Matthew Parker, now archbishop of Canterbury, in London in 1565, when the University of Heidelberg was closed on account of the plague, he returned to the Palatinate to publish his Latin translation of the 'Targum Jonathan' on the twelve minor prophets in 1567. This was followed in 1569 by an Aramaic and Syriac grammar, in which he made an important distinction between the two languages, and a literal Latin translation and edition of the Syriac 'New Testament' (the second to appear in the sixteenth century), dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. Because of the lack of Syriac types in the workshop of the printer Henri Etienne, however, both the grammar and the 'New Testament' were published in Hebrew characters. Then, with the support of the elector palatine, Tremellius embarked on his major project of translating the 'Old Testament' into Latin, a task which he undertook together with a scholarly Reformed minister of French origin, Francois du Jon (Franciscus Junius the elder). Junius's contribution was mainly limited to the translation of the 'Apocrypha'. 
The work was finally published in Frankfurt in five volumes between 1575 and 1579. It was an important addition to the study of the 'Old Testament'. As the Italian Hebraist Sanctes Pagninus had done before him, Tremellius, in his efforts to produce a Latin translation of the 'Bible' superior to the 'Vulgate', frequently relied on rabbinic interpretations of difficult words and passages. In doing so he improved on the work of his predecessors and the result of his labours, much admired in the protestant world and even sanctioned, albeit with alterations, at the Catholic universities of Douai and Louvain, had a considerable influence on the English Authorized Version of 1611. 
On 5 December 1577 Tremellius relinquished his chair in Heidelberg. Frederick III had died on 26 October 1576. His successor, Louis VI, was a Lutheran who gradually ousted his father's Reformed proteges. Tremellius thus welcomed a call to act as professor of Hebrew at the academy of Sedan, recently founded by Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, duke of Bouillon. Sedan was to have one of the finest schools of oriental languages in Reformed Europe, and Tremellius did much to contribute to its prestige. He died in Sedan on 9 October 1580.

Tremenheere, Hugh Seymour (1804-1893), civil servant, was born at Wootton House, Gloucestershire, on 22 January 1804, the eldest son of Walter Tremenheere and his wife, Frances, daughter of Thomas Apperley. 


Hugh Seymour Tremenheere was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford (BA 1827, MA 1832), and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1834. Appointed a revising barrister on the western circuit in 1838, he inspected schools for the education department (1839-43), and mines (1843-59) and other industries (1855-71) for the Home Office. He was a fellow of New College from 1824 until his marriage, on 2 April 1856, to Lucy Bernal, third daughter of Ralph Bernal MP, and widow of Vicesimus Knox. 
Tremenheere's interest in working-class education began with his membership of the Central Society of Education, a body that published papers on teaching methods and child psychology and lobbied for state-run schools on the Irish model (which kept religious and secular training separate). When the new education committee of the privy council filled its posts in 1839, Tremenheere was appointed to inspect schools of the nonconformist-dominated British and Foreign School Society. His appointment came through the influence of B. F. Duppa, the Central Society's secretary, who knew the lord president of the council Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, marquess of Lansdowne. A moderate Anglican whig, Tremenheere was not likely to alienate the society. His first mission, to Monmouthshire and Herefordshire in December 1839, officially to survey the state of education, involved an inquiry into the causes of John Frost's Newport rising. 
Tremenheere co-operated with the education department's permanent secretary, James Kay-Shuttleworth, in promoting efficient education to teach working-class children their place in society, and aligned himself with non-sectarianism against 'our opponents the High Churchmen & the Newmanites' (Paz, 109). The British and Foreign School Society, however, resented the negative tone of his reports, which criticized its use of the monitorial teaching method. It also felt aggrieved because, unlike the Church of England and the Church of Scotland, it had no control over the appointment of the inspector of its schools. After the defeat of the Peel ministry's 'Factory Bill' in 1843, the government was forced to settle the dispute with the British and Foreign School Society over inspection, and did so by transferring Tremenheere to the Home Office at the end of the year. 
At the Home Office Tremenheere was appointed by Sir James Graham as inspector under the 'Mines Act', 1842. In his annual reports on the mining districts he advocated education to teach obedience, free-market economics, and the evils of trade unions. Education would 'fortify the mind [of the pitmen's children] against attempts at misdirection' from 'agitators of their own class', and promote 'the growth of morality and social order' (Colls, 92). Tremenheere encouraged colliery owners to build schools, and discouraged working-class self-education and schools outside the control of other agencies. Although he interviewed workers and union leaders, his sympathies were on the side of the employers. He saw his main task as the reporting of social conditions in the mining regions, rather than the enforcing of safety regulations. He visited Belgium, France, and Germany to study mining laws and underground inspection in those countries, and recommended that Britain adopt underground inspection. The 'Mines Act', 1850, of which Tremenheere was the architect, provided for the appointment of inspectors with technical qualifications who would use their expertise to advise colliery managers and encourage them to emulate one another, rather than to force improvements. He was however, energetic in reducing the incidence of the truck system in mining, and the payment of miners' wages in public houses. 
The Home Office gave Tremenheere additional tasks in the 1850s and 1860s. He investigated bleaching works (1855), lace works (1861), and bakehouses; he served on royal commissions on the employment of children and young persons in both industry (1862-7) and agriculture (1867-71). In these activities he continued to express his opposition to trade unions, and his beliefs that the state should cajole rather than coerce employers, and that ideologically correct education should be provided to the working classes. He retired from government service in 1871, receiving a CB. 
In retirement Tremenheere opposed Irish home rule and church disestablishment, and addressed political pamphlets to a working-class audience, which were published by the Christian Knowledge Society and the Liberal Unionist Association. A contributor to the 'Edinburgh Review' (1837-9), 'Fortnightly Review' (1881), and 'Nineteenth Century' (1880), his other publications included a comparison of the constitutions of Great Britain and the USA (1854), following a tour of North America in 1852, and in 'The Political Expertise of the Ancients, in its Bearing upon Modern Times' (1852). He died at Silverdale, Alexandra Road, Farnborough, Hampshire, on 16 September 1893.

Walter Tremenheere (1761-1855), naval officer, was born at Penzance on 10 September 1761, and saw action in the American, French revolutionary, and Napoleonic wars. He was lieutenant-governor of Curacao, colonel-commandant of the Chatham division of the Royal Marines, and briefly aide-de-camp to William IV, for which last he was appointed KH in 1832. He was known for his Cornish landscape drawings. He died at 33 Somerset Street, Portman Square, London, on 7 August 1855. Two of his sons soldiered in India. George Borlase Tremenheere (1809-1896), lieutenant-colonel of the Bengal Engineers, served in the First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars; in retirement he commanded the western battalion of the Duke of Cornwall's volunteers and was president of the Indian Mutiny Relief Fund. Charles William Tremenheere (1813-1898), major-general of the Bombay Engineers, fought in the Indian mutiny (for which he was made CB), was commandant at Aden, and wrote 'Missions in India: the System of Education in Government and Mission Schools Contrasted' (1876). Another son, John Henry Tremenheere (1807-1880), was a prolific contributor to periodical literature.

Trench, Francis Chenevix (1805-1886), Church of England clergyman and author, was the eldest son of Richard Trench (1774-1860), barrister, and his wife, Melesina Trench. Richard Chenevix Trench was his younger brother. 
Trench entered Harrow School early in 1818, and matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 12 November 1824, graduating BA in 1834 and MA in 1859. On 4 June 1829 he entered Lincoln's Inn to study law, but in 1834 he was ordained deacon and became curate of St Giles, Reading. The next year he was ordained priest, and on 13 September 1837 he was appointed perpetual curate of St John's, Reading. He married, on 6 December 1837, Mary Caroline, daughter of William Marsh, the evangelical. They had one son, Richard William Francis (1849-1860), and two daughters, Mary Melesina and Maria Marcia Fanny. From 1857 until 1875, when he retired to London, he was rector of Islip, Oxfordshire. He added the name 'Chenevix' in 1873. Mary Caroline Chenevix Trench died on 4 March 1886 and her husband the next month, on 3 April, in Bursledon, Hampshire. 
Trench was a scholarly parson, publishing many sermons, theological works, and travel books, such as 'Diary of Travels in France and Spain' (1845), 'Scotland: its Faith and Features' (1846), 'A Walk around Mont Blanc' (1847), and 'A Ride in Sicily, by Oxoniensis' (1851). He contributed to 'Macmillan's Magazine' and 'Notes and Queries', published a series of papers as 'Islipiana' (1869-70), and wrote 'A Few Notes from Past Life' (1862), which includes interesting autobiographical 'memorabilia'.

Trench, Sir Frederick William (c.1777-1859), army officer and politician, was the elder son of Michael Frederick Trench (1746-1836) of Heywood, Ballynakill, Queen's county, and his wife, Anne Helena, daughter and heir of Patrick Stewart of Killymoon, co. Tyrone. Richard Le Poer Trench, second earl of Clancarty, was his third cousin. After attending school in Drogheda, Trench entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1793; he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, aged nineteen, in 1797, when he also enrolled at Lincoln's Inn. 
Commissioned an ensign and lieutenant in the 1st foot guards on 12 November 1803, Trench became lieutenant and captain on 12 November 1807. In the 1806 general election he was returned as member for Mitchell, Cornwall; the patron of the seat, Sir Christopher Hawkins, having sold this and other seats to men pledged to the Grenville administration. Trench vacated his seat, however, in January 1807, and was appointed to the quartermaster-general's staff in Sicily. He also served in the Walcheren expedition in 1809, and at Cadiz, June-August 1811, under Lieutenant-General Thomas Graham; but after being appointed assistant quartermaster-general in the Kent district, and promoted major, he returned to England. 
On 21 February 1812 Lord Roden brought Trench into parliament for Dundalk, on the death of the sitting member, but a series of votes by Trench against the administration and his support for Catholic emancipation caused Roden to drop him at the general election in October, whereupon Trench vainly sought Lord Grenville's assistance. On 23 November 1813 he was made deputy quartermaster-general to the expeditionary force sent to the Netherlands under Graham, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel; this was another speedy promotion, but in 1814, when the war ended, he was placed on half pay. 
Trench enjoyed the 'most affectionate' friendship of the fifth duke of Rutland over a period of fifty-five years, 'uninterrupted by one moment of coolness' (will), until the duke's death in 1857. It was the duke who brought him into the Commons again, on a vacancy at Cambridge in November 1819. He retained the seat until 1832. During this period he appears to have been involved in the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. On 27 May 1825 he was promoted colonel and appointed aide-de-camp to the king. In May 1829 Wellington made him storekeeper of the ordnance in the ministerial reshuffle after Huskisson's resignation, an appointment Mrs Arbuthnot regarded as 'so very Tory' (Bamford and Wellesley, 2.277). He was made KCH in 1832, and was automatically promoted major-general on 10 January 1837, lieutenant-general on 9 November 1846, and general on 25 June 1854. 
Although Trench was unsuccessful in contesting Scarborough on the Rutland interest in 1832 Peel, whose 'disinterested, and devoted supporter' he avowedly was (BL, Add. MS 40597, fol. 393, 30 Dec 1846), named him secretary to the master-general of the ordnance in his short-lived administration of 1834-5. Trench secured Scarborough in the ensuing general election, held it until 1847, and returned to the Ordnance under Peel's second ministry (1842-6). In the 1842 recess he visited Rome, and in 1845 he toured Spain and Portugal. 
Though assiduous in promoting the interests of his Cambridge electors Trench seldom spoke in the Commons and then usually on Irish questions. On 6 April 1827, having performed a 'volte face', he opposed Catholic emancipation: having been 'for years... a daily witness of the evils which arose from the system pursued by the Irish Catholics' ('Hansard 2', 17.274), he put forward a policy for Ireland that included the employment of the poor by government, measures for improving agriculture and education, paying the Catholic clergy, and widening the franchise; but he was groaned down. It was, he believed, 'the infinite subdivision of land' (ibid., 18.1421) that caused Ireland's ills. But when in March 1829 Peel and Wellington introduced a Roman Catholic relief bill, Trench's devotion to them compelled him to turn again, and give a reluctant consent. (Similarly in 1844 he supported Peel's Maynooth seminary grant.) Opposing the 'Reform Bill' in 1831 as 'rash, improvident, and revolutionary', he defended the character of his Cambridge electors as 'persons of opulence and independence' ('Hansard 3', 4.743-6). 
Trench made his mark, however, as a self-appointed expert on public architecture, a 'Gentleman who fancies Himself a Man of Taste' (BL, Add. MS 38380, fol. 271). Already in 1815 he had proposed a vast pyramidal monument to British naval and military victories over France (designed by Philip and Matthew Cotes Wyatt) on the site that later became Trafalgar Square. In July 1824 he launched a project for a quay or embankment on the north side of the Thames from Westminster to Blackfriars (again drawn out by Philip Wyatt); despite much criticism in March 1825 he introduced a bill to authorize its construction, but he was checkmated by riverine interests. As a member of a select committee on the design of the new law courts at Westminster early in 1824, Trench employed Philip Wyatt yet again to put on paper his idea, 'far more beautiful and extensive' than that of John Soane, the official architect (Trench). On another committee for the improvement of the Commons' accommodation later in that session he vainly urged a sweeping general plan, but he did secure minor improvements in a revised plan the following year. 
Trench was active in Hume's committee for a more commodious Commons in 1831, promoting Benjamin Wyatt's rebuilding proposals. During the same period he joined in the barrage of criticism of Nash's rebuilding of Buckingham Palace, which he proposed converting to a national gallery of art. His hostility to Nash's design had begun in 1825 when he had urged George IV to build, in Hyde Park, a scheme (drawn by Philip Wyatt) that Mrs Arbuthnot (wife of the minister responsible for the crown estate) described as 'the worst plan of a house I ever saw, & quite colossal... It is the most ridiculous plan I ever saw for, added to it, is the idea of a street '200 feet' 'wide' extending from the end of Hyde Park opposite the New Palace to St Paul's!!' (Bamford and Wellesley, 1.420). The king expressed his 'warmest approbation' (BL, Add. MS 38380, fol. 172), but the prime minister rebuffed Trench very sharply. 
Trench's hour of triumph came some two decades later and was preceded by two further rebuffs. In 1841, when metropolitan improvement was again being debated, he revived his Thames quay scheme, into which he introduced a railway, in an open 'Letter to Lord Duncannon', the public works minister; he again urged it on the royal commission of 1844, but with complete lack of success. Likewise his projects for improving Piccadilly and the National Gallery in the early 1840s were stillborn. But his long-maturing design for mounting a giant equestrian statue of the duke of Wellington, sculpted by his old friend Matthew Cotes Wyatt, on the Constitution Hill arch (opposite Apsley House), was (thanks to Lord Melbourne's carelessness and the queen's reluctance to embarrass Wellington) carried out in 1846 with the duke of Rutland's support, despite the opposition of 'Punch' and the government; there it remained until 1883. Wellington himself, who thought 'that it was the damnedest job from the beginning', was regarded as 'a mere cat's-paw of that impudent Irish pretender' ('Greville Memoirs', 1.106). 
Trench died unmarried, at 81 Marine Parade, Brighton, on 6 December 1859, about a month after making a will bequeathing his Irish property to the eldest of his four sisters, and over $11,000 in 3 per cent consols to his other relatives; he advised his executors to dispose of his letters 'as they may think best, I believe there is no disposal more judicious than the fire' (will).

Trench, Melesina (1768-1827), diarist and letter-writer, was born in Dublin on 22 March 1768, the daughter of Philip Chenevix and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Archdeacon Gervais; she was the granddaughter of Richard Chenevix (1696/7-1779), bishop of Waterford, who owed his see to the patronage of Lord Chesterfield, lord lieutenant of Ireland from 1745 to 1746. After the death of her parents Melesina was brought up by her grandfather Bishop Chenevix and her relative Lady Lifford. After the bishop's death in 1779, she went to live with her maternal grandfather, Archdeacon Gervais, through whose library she rambled at large, and from which, with precocious taste and intelligence, she selected as her favourites Shakespeare, Moliere, and Sterne. She developed great personal beauty, and on 31 October 1786 she married Colonel Richard St George of Carrick-on-Shannon and Hatley Manor, co. Leitrim; they had one child before his death in Portugal only two years after the marriage. 
For ten years Melesina St George lived in seclusion with her child, and it is not until 1798 that her interesting journal commences. During 1799 and 1800 she travelled in Germany, mixing in the very best society, and noting many items of historical interest. From Berlin and Dresden she proceeded to Vienna, and at Dresden, on her return journey, she met Nelson and Lady Hamilton, of whose lack of refinement some unpleasant instances are afforded. In Germany she also met Rivarol, Lucien Bonaparte, and John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. An account of this tour was privately issued by her son, Richard, in 1861; it was then incorporated in the 'Remains' of 1862. 
In July 1802, after a short stay in England, Melesina St George landed from Dover at Calais, on what proved a five years' sojourn in France; she also began exchanging letters with Mary Leadbeater in 1802. In Paris on 3 March 1803 she married Richard Trench (1774-1860), the sixth son of Frederick Trench of Moate, co. Galway. Her husband's eldest brother, Frederic, was created Lord Ashtown in 1800. From his ancestor, Frederick Trench (died 1669) of Garbally, co. Galway, Richard Le Poer Trench, second earl of Clancarty (1767-1837), also descended. Both Chenevixes and Trenches were of Huguenot origin. 
After this time Melesina Trench's journal writing gave way to a charming correspondence with her husband and her old friends in England and Ireland. After the rupture of the peace of Amiens her husband was detained in France by Napoleon, and was confined to the Loire district. She made repeated visits to Paris to urge his release, and in August 1805 she delivered in person a petition to Napoleon for a passport for her husband; but it was not until 1807 that the requisite document was obtained and they were enabled to make their way to Rotterdam, whence, after a stormy passage, they reached England. 
At Dublin, in November, Melesina met her old friend and correspondent, Mary Leadbeater, whom she had employed as almoner among her husband's tenants in Ireland. During a summer visit to the Leadbeaters it is related how she was discovered in the scullery surrounded by a small class of peasant children. The same charm made her much sought after in society, but the frivolities of a 'modish' life became more and more repugnant to her; and her letters become more personal and introspective, lacking external facts and detail. There are, however, some interesting touches respecting Wellington, Jekyll, Hester Piozzi (Mrs Thrale), Mrs Fry, and Lord John Russell, but the references to the political society with which she mixed at Paris under the first empire are tantalizingly brief. No mean judge, Edward Fitzgerald, to whom her son, Richard, submitted her letters and papers in manuscript, classes her letters with those of Walpole and Southey, praising them especially for their 'natural taste and good breeding' (letter dated 3 July 1861). 
Apart from the 'Remains', including the journal and correspondence, of which two editions appeared in 1862 under the editorship of Richard Chenevix Trench, then dean of Westminster, Melesina Trench's writings comprise: 'Mary Queen of Scots, an Historical Ballad, and other Poems' (n.d., privately issued), 'Campaspe, an Historical Tale, and other Poems' (1815), and 'Laura's Dream, or, The Moonlanders' (1816). All these were issued anonymously, and show the influence of Byron, Rogers, and especially Thomson, whose 'Seasons' she greatly admired. Her 'Thoughts of a Parent on Education, by the Late Mrs Richard Trench' (1837) appeared posthumously. 
Melesina Trench died at Malvern on 27 May 1827. Her husband survived her many years, dying at Botley Hill, Hampshire, aged eighty-six on 16 April 1860. At that date three of their nine children were still alive: Francis Chenevix Trench (1805-1886), Richard Chenevix Trench (1807-1886), afterwards archbishop of Dublin, and Philip Charles (1810-1888) of Botley.

Trench, Power Le Poer (1770-1839), Church of Ireland archbishop of Tuam, was of Huguenot ancestry, being the third son of William Power Keating Trench, first earl of Clancarty, of the second creation (1741-1805), and Anne, the eldest daughter of the Rt Hon. Charles Gardiner of Dublin. Born in Sackville Street, Dublin, on 10 June 1770, he was educated first at Mr Cormick's school in Wandsworth and Putney, and subsequently, after a few years at Harrow School (1780-84), he attended Mr Ralph's academy in Castlebar, co. Mayo (1784-7). After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, in July 1791, he was ordained deacon in November and received priest's orders in June 1792. He was immediately appointed to the family benefice of Creagh (Ballinasloe) and in the following year he was authorized to hold this in plurality with the benefice of Rawdenstown, co. Meath. He also acted as his father's business agent on the family's Galway estate. On 29 January 1795 he married his cousin Anne, the daughter of Walter Taylor of Castle Taylor, Galway, with whom he had two sons and six daughters. Initially they took up residence at Raford, near Ballinasloe. Trench was an accomplished horseman; during the uprising of 1798 he was a captain in the local yeomanry raised by his father to resist the French invading army. 
In 1802 Trench was consecrated as bishop of Waterford, though family commitments may have contributed to the delay in his removal to the episcopal palace two years later. In 1810 his translation to the see of Elphin brought him back to the vicinity of his family. He was a gifted preacher, noted for his charity, and his diocesan reforms included church and rectory building, diaconal appointments, and administrative improvement. 
Unlike his brother the second earl of Clancarty and his sisters Lady Rathdowne and Lady Emily La Touche, Trench was at this stage unsympathetic to the progress of the evangelical movement in Ireland, though he was impressed by the serenity of Lady Emily when he ministered to her at the time of her death in 1816. In the same year, although he valued the work of the evangelical ministers in his diocese, his visitation sermon condemned their doctrines as erroneous. However, a courteously reasoned reply in a letter from Archdeacon William Digby was instrumental in Trench's subsequent identification with the evangelical cause. In 1819 he was advanced to the archdiocese of Tuam but, before this, he had publicly committed himself to support evangelicalism 'by my influence, by my patronage and by my personal countenance' (Sirr, 46). 
Although for a time Trench's association with the evangelical societies was somewhat diffident, he made clear to his clergy at their first clerical meeting that in matters of preferment spiritual zeal would be as important a factor as talent. Following his public defence, in 1822, of the Hibernian Bible Society, which had recently lost the support of the Irish primate, Lord John Beresford, Trench became the acknowledged leader of Irish evangelicalism, though this role was not allowed to hinder the vigorous performance of his archiepiscopal duties. Clerical inadequacy which had resulted in some defections to the Roman communion was an immediate cause for concern. Societies for the furtherance of evangelism and education were founded and new churches were established. During the famine of 1822 'he was virtually a proconsul' (Acheson, 1119) in Connaught, where his representations to the government and the relief agencies in London for the distribution of emergency supplies earned him gratitude from protestant and Catholic alike. 
Of the evangelical initiatives associated with Trench's archiepiscopacy, Edward Nangle's Achill mission was probably the most celebrated, but not an isolated, example. By establishing his own diocesan branch of the Established Church Home Missionary Society, Trench was able to require his clergy not to obstruct active evangelism among the Catholics in his diocese. The archbishop's unabashed statement in 1827, 'We are proselytisers. We plead guilty to this terrific and unpardonable charge' (Sirr, 487), reflects his sincere commitment to the evangelism of the Bible Society as well as his forceful, uncompromising manner. But such statements were liable to alienate Catholics who had once appreciated his conciliatory spirit. Justly or otherwise, the Catholic 'Freeman's Journal' (1824) claimed that when peasants in Trench's archdiocese were forgiven their arrears of rent 'part of the condition is that the tenantry should send their children to the 'Bible' schools; and this is the 'questio vexata' between the tenantry and his grace' (Bowen, 73). 
The 'Irish Church Temporalities Act' of 1834 (by which, on Trench's death, Tuam became a simple bishopric) resulted in the incorporation of the dioceses of Killala and Achonry into Trench's charge, but the sexagenarian archbishop continued to travel extensively on horseback to discharge these additional responsibilities. He died on 26 March 1839 at his archiepiscopal residence in Tuam, and was buried with his ancestors at Creagh, near Ballinasloe. His wife survived him.

Trench, Richard Chenevix (1807-1886), Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin, was born on 9 September 1807 at North Frederick Street, Dublin, the third son of Richard Trench (1774-1860), barrister-at-law (brother of Frederic Trench, first Baron Ashtown) and Melesina Trench (1768-1827), granddaughter of Richard Chenevix, bishop of Waterford. His childhood was spent at Elm Lodge, Burlesdon, near Southampton, purchased by his father in 1810. He attended Twyford School (1816-19) and Harrow School (1819-25), proceeding to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1825. He took pride in his membership of the Apostles there, and came under the influence of F. D. Maurice and a distinguished group of undergraduates that included Tennyson and Arthur Hallam. While at Trinity he edited and printed a periodical, 'The Translator'. He graduated BA in 1829, and proceeded MA in 1833 and BD in 1850. 
Trench spent the period immediately following graduation travelling in Europe, much of it in Spain, for whose literature he had developed a passion. He returned home in mid-1830, only to return to Spain within months as part of the somewhat quixotic Torrijos expedition, a group of idealistic volunteers who set out to attack Cadiz in support of the ill-conceived and ineptly executed liberal revolution of Jose Torrijos, and from which Trench returned unscathed if somewhat embarrassed. 
By 1831 his father had taken up residence at Bockley Park, near Stradbally, in Queen's county (co. Laois), where Trench spent much time. On 31 May 1832 he married his cousin Frances Mary Trench (1809-1890), daughter of Francis Trench of Sopwell Hall in co. Tipperary and Mary, daughter of Henry Mason of Shrewsbury. They had seven sons and five daughters. 
Trench was ordained deacon in Norwich Cathedral on 7 October 1832, and in 1833 took up the curacy of Hadleigh in Suffolk, under the Tractarian Hugh James Rose, expressing himself glad 'to be quit of Ireland', which was experiencing a period of particular turbulence, largely to do with popular resistance to the payment of tithes to the established church. None the less, in 1847, when the great Irish famine was at its worst, he joined his cousin Frederic Fitzwilliam Trench, rector of Cloughjordan, in relief work, succumbing to fever immediately on his return to England. Years later, as archbishop of Dublin, he was to show himself equally compassionate and energetic during an economic crisis caused by the harvest failure of 1879-80. During the time of Trench's curacy, the Hadleigh conference took place in the parish, attended by Froude and other Tractarian clergy, and convened by Rose to consider the threat that he perceived to lie in the '(Irish) Church Temporalities Bill', famously condemned in Keble's 'assize sermon' of 1833. 
Rose left that same year for the professorship of divinity at the newly founded University of Durham, and some months later (1834) Trench became curate of St Peter's, Colchester. Ill health soon compelled him to resign. He, his wife, and their daughter (Melesina Mary, who later married Cholmeley Austen-Leigh and was the mother of the printer Richard Austen-Leigh) spent much of 1834-5 in Italy. His health restored, he returned to England and was ordained priest on 5 July 1835 and in September was made perpetual curate of the newly instituted parish of Curbridge (Winchester). 
Trench's six years at Curbridge (his house had once been William Cobbett's) saw the growth of his reputation as a scholar and, equally significant, the development of his friendship with Samuel Wilberforce. His first theological work, 'Notes on the Parables of Our Lord' (1841) was a substantial work of exegesis, 467 pages in all. It was well received and, running to fourteen revised editions, his most popular work. It was claimed by his biographer to mark the beginning of 'that other 'Cambridge Movement' which reached its zenith and glory in the work of the great 'New Testament' scholars Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort' (Bromley, 70). These years also saw the publication of volumes of poetry that included 'Sabbation; Honor Neale; and other Poems' (1838). 'Elegiac Poems' (1843) was much influenced by the death of his eight-year-old son, Francis William, in 1841: '
in my hand I feel the grasp 

of that small hand, whose tender clasp 

I shall not feel, oh! any more. 

' In 1841 Trench was appointed curate to Wilberforce at Alverstoke and although three years later he moved to be rector of Itchen Stoke (1844), Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford from 1845, made him his examining chaplain. He continued to publish theology and poetry and was special preacher at Cambridge (1843) and Hulsean lecturer (1845 and 1846). Evincing a considerable interest in philology, he delivered a series of lectures which he published (1851) as 'Study of Words', which ran into many editions. He followed this with 'English Past and Present' (1855) and 'A Select Glossary' (1859). These works constituted an important impetus toward the study of the English language. In 1857 he joined the Philological Society, energetically championing the cause of producing a new English dictionary. He read papers on the subject to the society, published as 'On some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries' (1857, 2nd edn 1860) and a resolution of his, put to the society on 7 January 1858, is commonly regarded as having provided the impetus that, the Clarendon Press having been interested in the enterprise, led to the 'Oxford English Dictionary'. His seminal role is recorded in the 'Historical introduction' to the work. His reputation was further enhanced by the publication of his second major book, 'Notes on the Miracles of Our Lord', in 1846. In the following year he was appointed professor of divinity at King's College, London, a chair that he held until 1856, when he became dean of Westminster. 
Trench was responsible for some innovations, including a Sunday evening service, of which the sermon was a popular component. In 1860 he published his 'Sermons Preached in Westminster Abbey' (as in 1873 he would publish 'Sermons Preached for the most Part in Ireland'), but he was not regarded as an especially accomplished preacher. It was during his time at Westminster that two of his sons died abroad, Arthur in 1860 and Richard in 1861. 
Trench was appointed, not without opposition, in 1863 to succeed Richard Whately as archbishop of Dublin, his consecration taking place on 1 January 1864. His friend F. D. Maurice described the move as 'an awful thing', and indeed the new archbishop came to a church that was entering a particularly turbulent period in its history, in which he was to play a vital, and frequently uncongenial, part. The Established Church of Ireland had already, in the early decades of the century, experienced considerable administrative reform, and continued to be the object of public scrutiny, partly because of its relative wealth, partly because of its minority position. The census of 1861 revealed that of an Irish population of some four and a quarter million, less than three-quarters of a million belonged to the established church. Gladstone identified the Irish church establishment as a major Irish grievance and, in the face of fierce resistance and non-co-operation from its leadership, effected disendowment and disestablishment by the 'Irish Church Act' (1869). None had been more intransigent opponents than Trench, described by the prime minister as 'a dreamer of dreams' (Gladstone, 7.14-15), who 'talks of negotiating at a time when all negotiation will have gone by', though some years later Gladstone's sense of justice caused him to dub Trench 'this excellent man' (Gladstone, 9.264). 
It was in the immediate aftermath of disestablishment, when controversy raged about the formulation of a constitution for the Church of Ireland and prayer book revision, that Trench proved to be a highly significant figure. He feared for the catholicity of the newly disestablished church, and that either by its form of government or by liturgical change (the motivation for which had a strongly protestant and anti-ritualist strand) it might cut itself off from the wider Anglican world, or be torn by schism. 
In the general convention that met in 1870 to draw up a constitution, Trench argued (successfully) for the bishops to have what amounted to a veto in the general synod. In matters doctrinal and liturgical he had already given opponents in his diocese occasion to attack 'Puseyite Trench', and he fought tenaciously, if not always tactfully -- he has been described by a modern though sympathetic commentator as 'the figure who most exacerbated the situation' (Clarke, 284) -- in the face of bitter and sometimes ill-informed criticism, for what he believed vital to the survival of the Church of Ireland as part of catholic Christendom. Though an awkward ally at times, he was a key figure among those who ensured that the Irish 'Book of Common Prayer' of 1878 to all intents and purposes retained the integrity of its predecessors. 
It can be said with some conviction that Trench's work in Dublin has been more enduring than his theological writing and his poetry, neither of which, however highly rated in their day, can be said to have stood the test of time (though several lines of his kept their place in the second edition of 'The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations', and one survived to the third). But his 'On the Study of Words' came out in the 'Everyman Library' in 1927, and in 1994 was included in the series 'History of Linguistics: British Linguistics in the Nineteenth Century', Trench being described in the introduction to this edition as 'father of the world's best dictionary' and 'one of the foremost advocates of 'scientific' [historical] lexicography in Victorian England' (p. ix). 
Also of lasting importance was the archbishop's active support for the founding of Alexandra College, Dublin (1866), which pioneered in Ireland the education of women, not only for university courses, but also, from 1880 to 1904, for the degrees of the Royal University of Ireland. 
The years of disestablishment and liturgical revision were, for Trench, a time of spiritual and intellectual anguish. To this was added physical suffering when he broke both his legs in a fall on board ship in 1875 when returning from one of his many visits to England. He felt compelled by failing health to resign in November 1884 (waiving his pension rights), and died on 28 March 1886 at 23 Eaton Square, London, where he had spent the winter. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 2 April, his epitaph composed by Dean Church.

Trench, Richard Le Poer, second earl of Clancarty (1767-1837), diplomatist, born on 18 May 1767, was the eldest surviving son of William Power Keating Trench, first earl of Clancarty (1741-1805), and his wife, Anne (died 1829), daughter of the Rt Hon. Charles Gardiner MP, of Dublin. His father, who was connected through his mother, Frances Power of Corheen, with Donough Maccarthy, fourth earl of Clancarty of the first creation, was born in 1741. He sat in the Irish parliament from 1769 to 1797 for the county of Galway, in which his seat, Garbally, was situated. On 29 November 1783 he supported Flood's motion for leave to bring in a reform bill, and on 12 August 1785 he opposed Pitt's commercial propositions when brought forward by Orde; but in 1791 he was attacked by George Ponsonby for supporting the government, in order to preserve its majority ('Irish Parliamentary Debates', 2nd edn, 11.321-3). He was created an Irish peer on 25 November 1797, with the title of Baron Kilconnel of Garbally; on the occasion of the union and on his son's prompting to Castlereagh, he was further advanced as Viscount Dunlo on 3 January 1801, and earl of Clancarty on 12 February 1803. He died on 27 April 1805. 
Richard Trench was called to the Irish bar, and in 1796 entered the Irish parliament as the member for Newtownlimavady. On 9 February that year he married Henrietta Margaret (died 1847), daughter of the Rt Hon. John Staples and his first wife, Harriet, daughter of the Rt Hon. William Connolly of Castletown. His wife was 'an excellent, head-aching woman, with none of the representation or insolance of an Ambassadress' (GEC, 'Peerage'). They had three sons and four daughters. In 1798 Trench was returned to the Irish parliament for Galway county, which he continued to represent until the union. On 27 June 1798 he seconded the address to the crown; but both he and his brother Charles voted against the proposed union when first brought forward the following year. They were, however, induced to support it in 1800, when Richard was persuaded by Castlereagh, and Charles was appointed by Cornwallis to the new office of commissioner of inland revenue; their father's advance in the peerage was doubtless their reward. Richard Trench was elected to the first parliament of the United Kindom for Galway county as a supporter of Pitt, and on 23 November 1802 moved the address, dwelling in the course of his speech on the beneficial effects of the union. On 21 May 1804 (by which time he had become known as Viscount Dunlo) he was appointed a commissioner for the affairs of India. In the next parliament he sat (after his father's death) as earl of Clancarty for the borough of Rye, but on 16 December 1808 he was chosen a representative peer for Ireland. On 13 May 1807 he was sworn of the British, and on 26 December 1808 of the Irish, privy council; and in May 1807 he was appointed postmaster-general in Ireland. He further received the offices of master of the Royal Mint (1812-14) and president of the Board of Trade (September 1812 to January 1818), and joint postmaster-general (1814-16). Between 1810 and 1812 he was a frequent speaker in the House of Lords. On 6 June 1810 he expressed modified approval of the Catholic claims, but criticized severely the attitude adopted by the Irish Catholic hierarchy since 1808. When the question was raised by Lord Wellesley two years later, he declared against unqualified concession, but was in favour of a thorough examination. On 4 January 1811 Clancarty, in a closely reasoned speech, defended the resolutions restricting the powers of the regent. 
In November 1813 Clancarty accompanied the prince of Orange to The Hague, and was accredited to him as British ambassador when he was proclaimed William I of the Netherlands. On 13 December he wrote to Castlereagh: 'What with correspondence with two admirals, four generals, British and allied, and your lordship, I am kept so well employed that I have scarcely time to eat or sleep'. On the 14th he wrote urgently demanding the immediate dispatch of Thomas Graham (Lord Lynedoch) with reinforcements to the Netherlands. Early in 1814 he was in communication with Lord Liverpool, the prime minister, on the subject of the Dutch finances. Clancarty was energetic in urging on the prince of Orange the necessary military measures, and succeeded in persuading him to resign the command of the allied forces in the Netherlands to the prince royal of Sweden, Bernadotte. In the succeeding months he was chiefly engaged in formulating a plan for the incorporation of the Belgian and Dutch provinces into the proposed new state of the Netherlands (cf. Yonge, 1.514). Other difficulties were the adjustment of financial relations and the claims of the Belgian clergy and nobility. During the summer months of 1814 his attention was also directed towards the opening up of a reciprocal colonial trade between Britain and the Netherlands, and to the resumption of negotiations for a marriage between Princess Charlotte of England and the hereditary prince of Orange. 
Meanwhile Clancarty had kept himself fully informed of the general situation of European affairs. On 11 August he was named one of the four British plenipotentiaries to the congress of Vienna. Talleyrand, in a letter of 28 December to Louis XVIII, spoke of his zeal, firmness, and uprightness. When Wellington left Vienna for Belgium in March 1815, Clancarty became the senior British plenipotentiary. He was the British representative on the various commissions respectively appointed to delimit the Polish frontier and to adjust the affairs of Saxony (October 1814); to mediate between Sardinia and Genoa; to regulate the affairs of Tuscany and Parma, and to draw up a preliminary convention (8 February 1815). On 11 March 1815, in an interesting dispatch to Castlereagh, he described the consternation of the royalty of Europe at the news of Napoleon's escape from Elba, but thought it desirable to encourage their fears with the view of bringing to an end the business of the congress. After the peace, on 4 August 1815, he was created Baron Trench of Garbally in the peerage of the United Kingdom. 
At the end of the year Clancarty went to Frankfurt am Main, and was engaged in resolving the disputes between Bavaria and Baden. On 22 May 1816 he was appointed ambassador to the new kingdom of the Netherlands, but was detained at Frankfurt through the summer. During his second embassy to the Netherlands Clancarty was at first mainly occupied in urging the king to take sufficiently strong measures against the French refugees in the Netherlands, who were plotting against the recent settlement of the country. Subsequently Clancarty devoted his attention to negotiations between Great Britain and the Netherlands for the suppression of the slave trade. During the remainder of the year he was chiefly occupied in negotiations with Prussia relating to frontier disputes and to the evacuation of the Netherlands by Prussian troops. During 1821 he was involved in contradicting Dutch claims that the slave-trade convention of 1818 had been confined to Africa. 
In December 1823 Clancarty reluctantly resigned his post in the Netherlands. In 1818 he had received a pension of $2000, and had also been created markies van Heusden by the king of the Netherlands. On retiring from The Hague he was made on 8 December 1823 Viscount Clancarty of co. Cork. He spent most of his retirement on his estates in Ireland, where he was lord lieutenant of co. Galway and vice-admiral of Connaught. On 8 March 1827, speaking in the House of Lords, he censured the negligence of the law officers in Ireland, and declared his opinion that no exceptional measures were necessary for repressing the Catholic Association; but in 1829 he opposed Catholic emancipation on account of the conduct of the Catholics. He said that, like Pitt, he would have granted relief on condition of their good behaviour. In the course of a correspondence with Wellington at this period, Clancarty complained of the lack of support given by the government to the cause of order in Ireland (7 July). Wellington, in reply, charged Clancarty with obstructing the emancipation bill. 
Clancarty died at Kinnegad, co. Westmeath, on 24 November 1837, and his wife died on 30 December 1847 at Garbally. Their eldest son, William Thomas Le Poer Trench (1803-1872), succeeded to his father's titles. Clancarty was an important member of Castlereagh's diplomatic team, 'hard-working, if opinionated and reactionary' (Webster, 2.40).

Trench, (Richard) William Steuart (1808-1872), land agent and writer, was born on 16 November 1808 at Bellegrove, near Portarlington, Queen's county, Ireland, the fourth son of Thomas Trench (1761-1834), dean of Kildare (brother of Frederic Trench, first Lord Ashtown, and brother-in-law of Melesina Trench), and his wife, Mary, eldest daughter of Walter Weldon of Rahinderry, MP for Athy in 1745. Trench was educated at the Royal School, Armagh, and was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin in 1826, though he does not appear to have taken a degree. In April 1832 he married Elizabeth Susannah (died 1887), daughter of J. Sealy Townsend, master of chancery in Ireland. They had two sons and one daughter. 
Trench spent some years preparing to become a land agent, and in 1841 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Agricultural Society for his essay, 'Reclamation'. After holding some subordinate positions he was appointed agent to the Shirley estate in co. Monaghan in April 1843. He resigned this post in April 1845. In December 1849 Trench was appointed agent to the extensive estates of the marquess of Lansdowne in co. Kerry, and, in addition to these, he took charge of the property of the marquess of Bath in Monaghan in 1851, and that of Lord Digby in the King's county in 1856. He held these appointments until his death. 
Trench's experience of the land management in Ireland ranged from the period immediately before the famine of the 1840s until Gladstone's first 'Land Act' (1870). In 1868 he published 'Realities of Irish Life', a book which was an immediate success and which passed through five editions in a year. The 'Edinburgh Review' praised its forcible and impressive description of the Irish peasantry, and likened its popular force, humour, and pathos to that in the early works of Charles Dickens. In 1871 Trench published 'Ierne: a Tale', in which he treated the same topics in fictional form, describing the faith of the Irish peasantry in their indefeasible ownership of the land, but the book did not achieve the success of its predecessor. Trench also wrote a sketch of the history of Ireland from the earliest times to the 'Act of Settlement' in 1870, but the work was suppressed after a large portion had been printed. His final publications were a series of tales, entitled 'Sketches of life and character in Ireland', which appeared in 'Evening Hours', a monthly periodical, in 1871 and 1872. 
Trench died at Carrickmacross, co. Monaghan, Ireland, the seat of the marquess of Bath, on 4 August 1872.

Trenchard, Sir John (1649-1695), politician, was born at Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, in Dorset, on 30 March 1649. His father was Thomas Trenchard (1615-1671) of Wolverton and his mother, Hannah Henley (died 1691), was the daughter of Robert Henley of Bramshill, Hampshire. The family was strongly nonconformist and John Trenchard himself was almost certainly a nonconformist (probably a presbyterian), though a cautious one who avoided prosecution and fulfilled the legal obligations of conformity necessary to hold office. There were other radical connections, two of Trenchard's cousins having married strong supporters of Oliver Cromwell, Colonel William Sydenham and John Slater. Trenchard himself, in November 1682, married Philip Speke ['see 'Trenchard, Philip (1663/4-1743), 'under' Speke, George], daughter of George Speke, one of the most outspoken whigs in the south-west, who was to lose one son and nearly a second for participation in the 1685 rebellion. 
At the age of fifteen, in 1665, Trenchard matriculated at New College, Oxford, and went on to a career in law, entering the Middle Temple in 1674. He became active in politics. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War he acted as one of Pierre du Moulin's agents in London, a valuable intermediary in gathering political intelligence and helping to co-ordinate the opposition to Charles's pro-French policies. He went on to win one of the borough of Taunton's seats in the first Exclusion Parliament of 1679, a seat he held in the two following elections of 1679 and 1681. 
With three other members of the Trenchard family John became a member of the strongly whig and nonconformist Green Ribbon Club. He achieved prominence in the early stages of the Popish Plot, gaining a position on the thirteen-strong committee of secrecy appointed by the Commons to investigate the plot. From the plot, like many other whigs, he moved on to the more dangerous business of attempting to exclude from the succession the heir apparent, James, duke of York, on the grounds that he was a Catholic. Trenchard was one of the seventeen peers and MPs who sensationally presented York as a common popish recusant in June 1680 before the Middlesex grand jury, and in the same year it was he who moved the House of Commons' first 'Exclusion Bill'. He was appointed to the house's committee on the bill, and argued in its third reading that concern for the nation's liberty and religion necessarily overrode any individual's personal rights, even including those of the heir to the throne: 'when a thing is 'pro bono publico' we ever step over private Rights' (J. R. Jones, 'The First Whigs', 1961, 138). The high regard in which he was held is indicated by his presence on over thirty Commons committees, from which he was the reporter to the Commons on two (petitioning and the removal of Halifax). 
Trenchard was among the core of twenty or so members who were regarded as supporters of the claim of the king's protestant, but illegitimate, son James, duke of Monmouth, to replace the Catholic duke of York as heir to the throne. He had little to do with the earl of Shaftesbury who headed the other, and major, branch of the whigs, which was carefully noncommittal on who should replace York as heir. Trenchard was, however, a regular attender at the King's Head tavern in Fleet Street, the whigs' London headquarters, though he also spent much time waiting on the duke of Monmouth at the latter's house in Soho. While his skills as a lawyer were one reason for Trenchard's prominence in whig circles, no less important was the radical reputation of the town which he represented. Taunton had been strongly parliamentarian during the civil war, harboured many dissenters after it, showed many marks of disrespect for church and crown well into the Restoration, and strongly supported the duke of Monmouth in his rebellion of 1685, providing one-tenth of his total manpower. Trenchard represented the town in all three Exclusion Parliaments, and in the early 1680s was just the man to stoke the fires of opposition there. He allegedly joked that the Trenchard family had as good a claim to the throne as the family of Stuart, and vowed that the duke of Monmouth would be their general in some unnamed enterprise if the king died. He ran Taunton's (whig) Green Ribbon Club with a Quaker deputy to act in his absence, and used the publican of one of the town's inns as another agent. 
When the exclusion movement collapsed after the dissolution of the third Exclusion Parliament of 1681, and a minority of whigs in the next eighteen months began to contemplate armed resistance to the crown, Trenchard was the focus of persistent stories of arms being bought and men being listed in the Taunton area. A former Cromwellian soldier boasted in late 1681 that Trenchard had enlisted him in a troop of horse; a woman claimed to have heard Trenchard around Christmas 1682 speaking of being involved, with others, in some great and secret work; the mayor of Taunton discovered in 1683 that men in his town had been retained and supplied with strong beer to be ready at an hour's notice to fight for Trenchard and Monmouth; and Trenchard persuaded a gunsmith from the village of Trull to move to Taunton, and bought a pair of pistols and muskets from him with the remark that these would do for the king's guards. Confessions and depositions obtained after the discovery of the Rye House plot in 1683, and others following the rebellion of 1685, suggest that Trenchard on several occasions in 1682 and 1683 claimed to be able to raise some 1500 men from the Taunton area to join with other forces from London, Cheshire, and (sometimes) Scotland in ill-defined and shadowy planning for an uprising. However, despite frequent boasts that he had armed men at his disposal, when told by the plot leaders to prepare for action he pleaded that they were not yet ready, and sent word to a meeting of the conspirators in November 1682 requesting a delay of two or three weeks more for his men to make arrangements for their families. Ford, Lord Grey, one of the plotters, believed he plainly saw fear on Trenchard's face when action seemed imminent, and it seems to have been repeated delays in Taunton which made Shaftesbury in December 1682 despair of conspiracy and flee abroad to the Netherlands. There is no clear evidence that Trenchard seriously prepared for a rising, for when the government learned of the Rye House plot (allegedly to assassinate the king), and in summer 1683 launched a series of arrests and house searches, only two or three old firearms and no incriminating papers at all were found in his house, and nothing of significance in those of his Somerset friends. Investigations into talk of arms caches for sixty to eighty men and gunpowder by the barrelful found it to be nothing but talk. But though Trenchard, like most of the whigs caught up in desperate post-exclusion plotting, clearly preferred talk to action, it should be noted that when a genuine rebellion broke out in 1685 several thousand Somerset men did join up in a matter of days, and Taunton was easily the strongest centre of support for the rebel duke. 
In July 1683 Trenchard was one of the many whigs arrested following the revelation of the Rye House plot. Held in the Tower for six months and given pen and paper to make a full confession, he defended himself with considerable skill (helped by the refusal of Lord William Russell to testify against him), and he was released for lack of sufficient evidence in December 1683. With two others he was shown and commented on the draft of the duke of Monmouth's public 'confession' of December 1683, and he was given an enthusiastic welcome in Somerset towns on his way home, but his spell in the Tower had evidently chastened him. He lived quietly at his Dorset home and maintained no contact with fellow conspirators who had fled abroad. His wife was arrested at a conventicle, but not Trenchard himself. By his own account he received word of the duke of Monmouth's planned rising four days before Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis and, estimating correctly that the duke would receive no support at all from the gentry and aristocracy and that the rising would therefore fail catastrophically, he raised what money he could and prepared to leave England. The government, however, sent two privy council messengers to arrest him, and he only just escaped: some time later his father-in-law George Speke was fined 2000 marks for helping him by obstructing the messengers. Angry at the way he had deserted their cause, the rebel leaders captured after the rising, such as Ford, Lord Grey, tried in their confessions to implicate Trenchard as deeply as they could in treasonable conspiracy, while simultaneously labelling him a coward. Possibly because of these accusations his prudence in having nothing whatever to do with the rebellion did him no good with the government and he remained on the wanted list -- pardons granted by James II in March 1686 did not include him. 
Despairing for the moment of an early return to England Trenchard threw himself into the society of English exiles in the Netherlands, and was accepted by them with surprising ease. He was seen in the company of notorious enemies of James II, boasted that he would now play a leading role rather than see anti-government conspiracies fail yet again, and helped finance a venture to set up a cloth manufacturing business in the Netherlands to provide work for the English exiles. With some other exile leaders he toyed briefly with the idea of setting up a handsome young man who had arrived in the Netherlands from Earl Shilton, Leicestershire, as the late duke of Monmouth's 'son', but decided against trying to run such an improbable pretender. With an eye to his long-term future, however, he continued to assure government agents that he had taken part in neither the Rye House plot nor the 1685 rebellion, and in December 1687 he had his reward when he was finally granted a pardon. He returned to England and early in 1688 returned cautiously to politics. He was among those 'closeted' with James II in 1688, but like other former whigs he had no influence upon the king. The reports of James's election agents described the determination of their local whig collaborators in Taunton to have Trenchard in place as MP there in the intended forthcoming election under a newly restricted franchise. There is no evidence that he played any role in the plotting which climaxed with William of Orange's arrival at Torbay in November 1688, but once the prince was ashore Trenchard worked actively for him, raising $250 from a pair of west country clothiers. 
Paying the price for his association with James, Trenchard was rejected by the electors of his old seat of Taunton in 1689. He sat briefly for Thetford and then (from 1690) for Poole. Between the revolution and 1690 he received a series of marks of the king's favour: comptroller of customs for Bristol, chief justice of Cheshire, recorder of Taunton, serjeant-at-law and then king's serjeant, and a knighthood. In parliament he displayed his old vigour, mastery of detail, and fluency in debate, working this time in the interest of the government. By 1693 he had been appointed to a score of parliamentary committees, at the rate of five or six per session, ranging from regulating prisons and attainting rebels to improving the poor law, repairing Dover harbour, and allowing surgeons to prescribe medicines. He managed conferences with the Lords, chaired the Commons committee on elections and privileges from 1691 to 1693, and in the latter year was three times chairman of the Commons ways and means committee. Known as a thoroughly dependable whig, it is no surprise that in the summer of 1693 Sunderland was grooming him to be one of the court managers in the Commons, with particular responsibility for the crucial business of supply. 
Trenchard reached the pinnacle of his career in March 1693 when he was appointed one of the two secretaries of state. Though his was the northern (and junior) department, responsibility for naval affairs was added to his office, evidently in the hope that his drive would improve a very lacklustre war at sea against the French. His confidence in office was widely noticed, though opinion about his character was divided: Anthony Wood described him as 'a man of turbulent and aspiring spirit, never contented', though Bishop Burnet saw 'a calm and sedate man... much more moderate than could have been expected, since he was a leading man in a party' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 4.405; Burnet, 4.193-4). In addition to his naval business he set up a chain of watchers along the French channel coast, pursued Jacobites, and took an interest in Irish affairs. He had a hand in key policy matters, becoming one of the five-man cabinet council set up to take decisions during William's absences abroad. In 1693-4, however, he was involved in two government fiascos, though characteristically he emerged from each formally exonerated of any blame, and still in the government's confidence. In May 1693 a report that French warships had put to sea was not communicated to the fleet, and largely in consequence of this a convoy of merchant ships bound for Smyrna was destroyed. Two admirals and the other secretary of state were sacked, but two parliamentary inquiries found it impossible to apportion blame any further and the matter was dropped. A year later Trenchard took an active, though secondary, part in the investigation of the Lancashire plot, and once again escaped without blame when the government case ignominiously collapsed, though he may have been damaged by allegations that his agents had improperly used search warrants, planted evidence, and taken bribes. By this time he had become ill with tuberculosis, and in August and December 1694 he retired to Dorset to improve his health. He was described as very weak, pale, and thin, and by the spring of 1695 his doctors despaired of his recovery. He died on 27 April 1695 at Kensington. He was buried at Bloxworth church, Dorset, near his house at Lytchett Matravers. His wife, Philippa, lived on until 1743, dying at the age of seventy-nine. Of their four sons and three daughters only one son, George, survived to have children.

Trenchard, John (1668/9-1723), landowner and publicist, was the first son of William Trenchard (1640-1710), landowner, of Cutteridge, Wiltshire, and his wife, Ellen, daughter of Sir George Norton of Abbots Leigh, Somerset. His nonconformist, whig father sat for Westbury in the three exclusion parliaments (1679-81) in which a distant relative, Sir John Trenchard, also sat, representing Taunton. Four decades later that same Somerset borough returned John Trenchard as an independent whig in the general election of 1722. When a student at Trinity College, Dublin -- from where he received his first degree on 29 May 1685, aged sixteen -- his young tutor, Edward Smith, celebrated 'Mr. Trenchard's Talent of Reasoning', a lastingly esteemed attribute ('Cato's Letters', preface, xlix). Although a promising young barrister of the Inner Temple, first called to the bar in 1689, his legal career proved brief. With 'An Argument Shewing that a Standing Army is Inconsistent with a Free Government' (1697) Trenchard initiated, after the treaty of Ryswick, an eventually successful paper war against William III's standing army. In 1699 the House of Commons appointed Trenchard a commissioner of the forfeited Irish lands. When Charles Montagu, then first lord of the Treasury, wanted to take Trenchard into custody for his 'Short History of Standing Armies' (1698), William refused. Gratitude for financial support from the Trenchard family at the time of the revolution of 1688 probably contributed to the monarch's decision. Trenchard was privileged from his birth into an ancient, landed, west country family, and he fell into 'an easy Fortune' from the 'Death of an Uncle', Sir George Norton and from 'his Marriage' ('Cato's Letters', preface, xlvii). His first wife may have been the daughter of Sir Thomas Scawen who took her own life in November 1718. The following year, on 19 November 1719, Trenchard married Anne (died 15 April 1783), daughter of Sir William Blackett, bt. 
Although an aggressive anti-clerical polemicist who denied the Trinity, Trenchard defended the 'Legal Church' and 'was only for pulling down those who would soar above it' ('Cato's Letters', preface, lix). The established church was in his opinion, a necessary institution and -- if committed to Christian love -- a socially beneficial one. With an eye to social harmony Trenchard also defended the right of private judgement. The twentieth-century editor of his 'Essays on miracles' describes Trenchard, a Christian deist, as 'an active member of the Anglican Church' throughout his life (Seguin, 'Essays', i). 
Trenchard's popular publications were those he produced in collaboration with Thomas Gordon. At the time of the Bangorian controversy Gordon wrote bitingly witty pamphlets endorsing the radical Erastianism of Benjamin Hoadly that apparently caught Trenchard's eye. Gordon always celebrated Trenchard, his 'best Tutor' ('Cato's Letters', preface, 1), and Trenchard's wealth probably underwrote the beginning of what proved to be an unrivalled success in the annals of early journalism. The 'Independent Whig', which appeared on Wednesdays from 20 January 1720 and ran for almost a year, censured what Gordon, Trenchard, and a third contributor -- perhaps Anthony Collins -- considered the ubiquitous and corrupt influence of high-church clerics propagating false divinity from their sacerdotal thrones. From November 1720 until September 1722 Trenchard and Gordon submitted letters, usually under the pseudonym Cato, to the 'Author of the 'London Journal''. This new weekly paper, founded by Trenchard and whose foreign correspondents he personally paid, had first appeared in August 1719 as the 'Thursday's Journal, with a Weekly Letter from Paris', and became a Saturday publication early in 1720. The government, frequently vexed at the 'London Journal', finally took it over at the time of the Atterbury conspiracy, just as a letter on standing armies by Trenchard was scheduled to appear. Thereafter, and until 'Cato's Farewell' on 27 July 1723, Trenchard and Gordon sent their letters to the 'Author of the 'British Journal'', the 'British Journal' being a new weekly that they had started themselves. The Wednesday 'Whig' and the Saturday missive enjoyed immediate success, and repeated book-form printings of the 'Independent Whig' and 'Cato's Letters' during the eighteenth century, speak of an enduring reputation. Readers on both sides of the Atlantic and in the salons of continental 'philosophes' found in these publications resonant rhetoric to sound their own causes. Trenchard and Gordon addressed a contemporary context with a strategically deployed discourse that is confined by any presumed distinction between civic republicanism and liberalism. A contemporary's remark about the use of 'Cato's Letters' after 1725 as being 'equally quoted by the Advocates and Opposers of Sir R. W. [Robert Walpole]' may serve to encourage further reflection on Cato's signifying practices and the variety of reader responses to 'his' texts (Ralph, 505). 
The early essays, appearing just after the plummet of South Sea stock, decried the earl of Sunderland's administration with fit charges of malfeasance and urged angry citizens to call for stern retribution. Severe punishment, argued Cato, would vindicate the natural rights that people had first entered into political society to preserve and would confirm government in its proper role as a trust 'to watch for the Security, and pursue the Interest of All' ('London Journal', 90, 15 April 1721). Given their profound pessimism about human nature, Trenchard and Gordon challenged any celebration of disinterested virtue. Cato thus exhorted the people, whose interests had been betrayed, to demand legal revenge while members of parliament, whose interests lay in popular policies, were expected to punish the people's betrayers. But Trenchard and Gordon also feared seditious exploitation of righteous anger. Their exhortations were to some extent a strategic deployment of loyalist, libertarian rhetoric to check Jacobitism. Cato's vivid depictions of absolute monarchy also suggest an effort to channel warranted anger along loyal, legal paths grounded in rights theory, articulated in part to counteract those who, Trenchard and Gordon sincerely believed, claimed a divine right to dominion. Trenchard, especially, called for control over the universities and charity schools, which he considered deeply disaffected institutions in the hands of restless rebels to a free state. The Middlesex grand jury condemned Trenchard's 'Of charity, and charity-schools' ('British Journal', 39, 15 June 1723) as well as three other Cato letters and Bernard Mandeville's 'Fable of the Bees' for depicting 'religion and virtue as prejudicial to society, and detrimental to the state' (Gordon, 'Cordial', 2.253). The anti-clerical Trenchard did, indeed, deem clericalism a mental tyranny spelling a civil one. The 'British Journal' had advertised the 'Fable' and, after Cato's farewell, Gordon and Mandeville published there as Diogenes, a pseudonym that Trenchard used for his more speculative essays. Trenchard only sat in the first session of the second septennial parliament between 1722 and 1723. His brief role there included opposing the suspension of habeas corpus and Walpole's proposal to remit the South Sea Company's debt; a successful motion to impose fines on nonjurors for their presumed sedition; and a vexatious call for attainder against one of the Atterbury conspirators. A well-built but not particularly healthy person, John Trenchard died from a kidney ailment on 16 December 1723 at his residence in Abbots Leigh; the parish church there, where he was buried, holds a monumental Latin inscription to his memory. His three sisters were his heirs. After Trenchard's death, his wife, Anne, married his collaborator, Thomas Gordon.

Trengrouse, Henry (1772-1854), inventor of life-saving apparatus, was born at Helston, Cornwall, on 18 March 1772, the son of Nicholas Trengrouse (1739-1814) and his wife, Mary Williams (died 1784). The family had long been the principal freeholders in Helston. Henry was educated at Helston grammar school, and lived in the town all his life. He was a close friend of the Wesleyan preacher, Samuel Drew. On 24 December 1807 he witnessed the wreck of the frigate 'Anson' in Mount's Bay, when over a hundred lives were lost, and this disaster led him to devote his life and inheritance to the discovery of some means for saving the lives of shipwrecked seafarers. His first thought was to devise a lifeboat, but when his efforts produced no satisfactory results, he turned his attention to life-saving apparatus. 
As early as 1791 Lieutenant John Bell had devised an apparatus for throwing a line to ships from the shore and, concurrently with Trengrouse, Captain George William Manby was engaged in perfecting an apparatus very similar to Bell's. The idea occurred to Manby in February 1807, and in August he exhibited some experiments to the members of the Suffolk Humane Society. He sought to establish communication between the shore and the shipwreck by means of a line fastened to a barbed shot which was fired from a mortar on the shore. By means of this line a hawser was drawn out from the shore to the ship, and along it was run a cradle in which the shipwrecked persons were landed. This invention had been recommended by various committees, and adopted to some extent before 1814. Trengrouse's apparatus, designed in 1808, was similar to Manby's in the use of the line and hawser, but was fired by a rocket fitted to an adapted musket, and a chair was used instead of a cradle. The advantages were that the rocket was much lighter and more portable than the mortar, the cost was much smaller, and there was little risk of the line breaking, because the velocity of a rocket increases gradually, whereas that of a shot fired from a mortar was so great and sudden that the line was frequently broken. Trengrouse's apparatus could, moreover, be packed in a chest 41/4 feet by 11/2 feet, and carried on board ship. When stranded, the crew could therefore begin their own rescue, without having to depend on a shore party being available. 
It was not, however, until 28 February 1818, after many journeys to London, that Trengrouse could demonstrate his apparatus to Admiral Sir Charles Rowley. A committee was appointed, and on 5 March it reported 'that Mr. Trengrouse's mode appears to be the best that has been suggested for the purpose of saving lives from shipwreck by gaining a communication with the shore; and, so far as the experiments went, it most perfectly answered what was proposed. ('Letter reporting... Trengrouse's invention', 21.361)' It was also suggested that a specimen apparatus should be placed in every dockyard that naval officers might become familiar with its working (ibid.). In the same year a committee of the elder brethren of Trinity House also reported in its favour, and recommended that it should be carried on all vessels. The government ordered twenty sets, but afterwards preferred to have them constructed by the Ordnance department, and paid Trengrouse $50 compensation. In 1821 the Society of Arts awarded him their large silver medal and 30 guineas for the invention. Alexander I of Russia personally wrote to Trengrouse, presented him with a diamond ring in recognition of the usefulness of his apparatus, and invited him to Russia, but apart from the prize awarded by the Society of Arts and the compensation paid by the government, Trengrouse reaped no pecuniary reward from his invention. An improved rocket was later invented by John Dennett in 1826, another by Colonel Boxer in 1855. The rocket completely superseded the mortar, and became an essential part of the operation of saving lives from shipwrecks. 
Trengrouse died at Helston on 14 February 1854, survived by his wife, Mary (1772-1863), daughter of Samuel Jenken, three sons and five daughters.

Tresham, Francis (1567?-1605), conspirator, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Tresham (1543-1605) of Rushton, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Meriel Throckmorton (died 1615), daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton, Warwickshire. Anthony Wood in 'Athenae Oxonienses' maintains that he studied at St John's College, Oxford, or Gloucester Hall, 'or both', but there seems to be no corroborating evidence (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 754). In 1593 he married Anne Tufton, elder daughter of Sir John Tufton of Hothfield, Kent. The Jesuit Father John Gerard hints at flaws in Tresham's character; another Jesuit closely involved with the English Catholic families of the time, Oswald Tesimond, generally kinder in his assessments, thought Tresham 'a man of sound judgement. He knew how to look after himself, but was not much to be trusted' (Edwards, 108). At all events, he was long an associate of his cousin Robert Catesby -- their mothers were sisters -- and of the brothers John and Christopher Wright, all subsequently conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot. 
Tresham was one of the Catholic gentlemen who followed the earl of Essex into rebellion on 8 February 1601. He was among those left by Essex to guard their prisoner, the lord keeper, Sir Thomas Egerton, in Essex House on the afternoon of that tumultuous day. Along with his colleagues, Tresham was arrested and imprisoned, first in the White Lion, Southwark, and then in the Tower. Freedom cost his father 3000 marks, Tresham being released on 21 June. This ugly experience did not prevent him dabbling in further treasons: he was involved in representations to the king of Spain fronted by Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, and Christopher Wright in 1602 and 1603. Nevertheless, his friends by now had their doubts about Tresham's commitment to the extreme courses they were considering, and they did not trust him with the secret of the Gunpowder Plot until 14 October 1605 (TNA: PRO, SP 14/16/63). Sir Thomas Tresham had died in the previous month, and Catesby clearly took this decision with an eye on Francis's newly acquired property, hoping that this wealth could help finance the conspirators' schemes. Although Sir Thomas's debts amounted to more than $11,000, the long-established Rushton estates, among the most prosperous in Northamptonshire, were valued at over $3000 per annum. 
Here Catesby made a grave mistake; Tresham had no stomach for the enterprise. He appears to have gone at once into Northamptonshire, shutting up Rushton Hall and taking his family to London. This visit may have provided an opportunity to conceal his muniments in a walled-up closet near the great hall where, more than 220 years later, they were rediscovered by workmen making alterations. Again and again Tresham urged his friends to abandon their scheme. Guy Fawkes says that he was concerned for the safety of Catholic peers attending parliament, and Catesby's airy assurances that the lives of their noble friends would somehow be preserved failed to convince. 
Tresham's dilemma was acute. Pressured, and at times openly threatened, by long-standing friends, he was at the same time aware of the immense risks being run, and the probable ruin of himself and every English Catholic should the plot miscarry. Although he never admitted it -- the fact would hardly have counted in his favour -- Tresham almost certainly wrote the disguised letter to his brother-in-law William Parker, Lord Monteagle, which, thanks to Monteagle's loyalty or instinct for self-preservation, revealed the conspiracy to the authorities. Another cousin and conspirator, Thomas Winter, clearly suspected as much. Fawkes, in his declaration of 16 November, recalled that Catesby and Winter had told him how Tresham had been 'exceeding earnest' to 'have [Monteagle] warned to be absent from the Parlament' (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/100). Early in November, Winter and Catesby taxed Tresham with the deed at the point of a dagger, and were only half convinced by his anguished protestations of innocence. Tresham salved his conscience by insisting that so far as he could tell, the conspirators had decided to halt their operations as a result of his prompting and his money. At his 'chamber in Clerkenwell' he paid over $190 to Winter, for Catesby's use 'acording to a former agreement between them', in the fortnight before 5 November (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/116). As he himself put it, 'the silence that I used was only to deliver my self from that infamous brand of an accuser, and to save his life which in all true rules I was bound to do.' He had aimed, he said, 'not only to free his majesty and the state from this present treason, but to shipe them all away that they might have no meanes left them to contrive any more' (TNA: PRO, SP 14/16/63). It was, if true, a perilous game, and Tresham knew it. Driven on by his fears, he secured a licence to travel abroad for two years, with servants and horses, granted on 2 November 1605. 
Upon the discovery of the treason, Tresham adopted an attitude of innocence. With the extent of the midlands rising still uncertain, and with preparations being made in London against a widespread Catholic revolt, he offered his services against any rebels (Stow, 'Annales', 879-80). On 8 November William Waad, lieutenant of the Tower of London, mentioned in a letter to Salisbury that 'there is one Tresham about the town that was a longue tyme pentioner to the king of Spain, and many others of that crew that would be observed' (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/48B), but it was only when Guy Fawkes -- who had never met him and who relied upon what he had heard from Catesby and Winter -- named Tresham as a conspirator on 9 November that these suspicions received confirmation. According to Stow, Tresham was committed to the Tower on 12 November. At his first examination he provided a string of evasive answers, but on the following day he set down in his own hand a long account of his efforts to frustrate Catesby's design. 
Tresham was, however, past saving, patently guilty of, at the very least, concealment of treason, or misprision. Further examination of other suspects revealed the dark secrets of his past, and by the end of November he was admitting his involvement in the negotiations between English Catholics and the court of Philip III in 1602-3. Like every other prisoner, with the early exception of Guy Fawkes, Tresham was well treated in the Tower. Early in December, however, his health began to deteriorate. The earl of Salisbury described Tresham's complaint as a 'natural sickness, such as he hath been a long time subject to' ('Memorials of Affairs of State... Collected... from the Original Papers of Sir Ralph Winwood', ed. E. Sawyer, 3 vols., 1725, 2.189). This was almost certainly a strangury. His lingering, painful end was documented at length by his trusted servant William Vavasour, who along with Tresham's wife and a nurse, Joan Sisor, had regular access to the stricken man. The attorney-general Sir Edward Coke, in a list of questions prepared for other conspirators, suggested that Vavasour was thought to be 'Sir Thomas Tresham's base son', but no evidence survives to support this hostile theory (Hatfield House, MS 115/18). 
Around the same time, Coke searched Tresham's chambers at the Inner Temple and found there two copies of a Jesuit 'Treatise on equivocation'. He set to work cataloguing the legal and moral pitfalls inherent in equivocation, but appears never to have established that the work was in fact from Henry Garnett's pen. In his last hours, Tresham himself resorted to equivocation, and retracted certain statements he had made implicating Jesuits in the Spanish treason. 'Inter alia', he insisted that he had not seen Garnett in sixteen years, a manifest falsehood. This assertion, in the very presence of death itself, greatly annoyed and perplexed the investigators. 
Tresham died in the Tower early in the morning of 23 December, and was buried there. It suited the government's purposes to interpret his crime as treason. He was attainted along with the other plotters ('Statutes of the Realm', 4.1068-9), his head was displayed at Northampton, and his lands were forfeited. Tresham was survived by two young daughters -- Lucy (1598-1665) and Elizabeth. Lucy became a nun in Brussels; Elizabeth married Sir George Heneage of Hainton, Lincolnshire. Lucy's twin brother, Thomas, had died in 1599. Many of the Tresham lands in Northamptonshire had been entailed by Sir Thomas in 1584, and were inherited -- despite the attainder -- by Tresham's brother Lewis (died 1639), but Lewis was extravagant and reckless, and the family's economic decline gathered pace. By 1614 the Rushton estate had passed to William Cokayne, in whose family it remained until the nineteenth century. A baronet of the original creation, Lewis was knighted on 9 April 1612. He married in 1603 Maria Perez de Recalde, granddaughter of Martin Perez de Recalde, viceroy of the West Indies, and a stepdaughter of John Moore, alderman of London, and was succeeded in 1639 by their only son, William (died 1643), the second, and last, baronet.

Tresham, Henry (bap. 1750/51, d. 1814), history painter and art dealer, was born in Ireland, but his parentage, and precisely where and when he was born, are so far unknown. On his election to the Royal Academy in 1799 Tresham appears to have given his date of baptism as '21 February 1750 or 1751, in Dublin', while Farington, who recorded Tresham's age in 1794 as forty-six (Farington, 'Diary', 1.135), stated after Tresham's death in 1814 that he was born on 24 February 1750 (ibid., 13.4548). Tresham studied in the Dublin Society's drawing school from 1765 and exhibited with the society between 1768 and 1775. Years later he told Farington that he was 'in great repute in Dublin... for drawing heads', but 'lamented not having practised the mechanical part of painting before He went to Italy' (ibid., 3.1016). 
In 1775 Tresham left for Italy, resolved to concentrate on history painting, and by September 1775 had rooms in the middle of the artist colony in Rome. He remained in Rome for thirteen years, increasingly more active as a dealer than as a painter. Occasionally he joined Thomas Jones and Henry Pars in 1777 on sketching excursions in and around Rome, but even on these his instinct to deal was uppermost, as when he bought the antique frescoes in the newly excavated Villa Negroni ('to be taken off the walls at his Own Expence'), selling them within weeks at a large profit to that avid collector Frederick Augustus Hervey, bishop of Derry (Oppe, 'Memoirs of Thomas Jones', 62). Ever the opportunist, Tresham gave 'a grand Entertainment to a large Company' in Rome in January 1780, to celebrate the news of the bishop of Derry's succession to the title of fourth earl of Bristol (ibid., 93). 
Tresham's most rewarding patron from 1783 was Colonel John Campbell (later first Baron Cawdor), with whom he travelled in Sicily, 1783-4, and for whom he made landscape drawings, bought pictures and antiquities, and, in particular, acted as Campbell's agent with Canova. Campbell marked the association by commissioning from Hugh Douglas Hamilton 'c'.1788-9 a remarkable pastel, 'Antonio Canova in his Studio with Henry Tresham and a Plaster Model for 'Cupid and Psyche'' (exh. RA, 1791; V&A). Tresham also acted in Italy as agent for many other collectors, including Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle, who settled an annuity of $300 on him for life. He was still profiting from sales from his own collection of Etruscan vases in 1809. 
Tresham completed several historical paintings in Rome (some sold to the earl bishop, none now known) and some portraits, as well as various weakly Fuseliesque allegorical drawings, such as 'A Knight, a Woman and other Figures Cowering from a Serpent in a Cave' (V&A), of which Iolo Williams remarked that 'it is easier to say that it represents something very terrible than to identify the subject exactly' (Williams, 128). More documentarily interesting is a watercolour of an archaeological site (priv. coll.; reproduced in Crookshank and knight of Glin), perhaps depicting Tresham himself as the gentleman-predator who watches anxiously as antique works are hauled into the world of modern dealing. In 1784 he published a volume of eighteen weak but extravagantly mannered aquatints entitled 'Le avventure di Saffo', inspired by Conte Alessandro Verri's 'Le avventure di Saffo poetessa di Mitilene', 1780. On returning to England in 1789 he sent twelve works to that year's Royal Academy exhibition (mostly historical paintings, but also including 'A View of Mount Etna from Catania'). From addresses at 9 George Street, Hanover Square, and later 20 Brook Street, London, he continued until 1806 to exhibit paintings mostly drawn from classical or British history, frigid in style and wan in colour. Few of these won praise, but in the 1790s he was commissioned by Robert Bowyer for twenty-four paintings (an example is 'The Earl of Warwick Justifies the Title to his Estate'; Manchester City Galleries) to be engraved for David Hume's 'History of England', and by John Boydell for two or three subjects for the 'Shakspeare Gallery'. Between 1796 and 1810 Tresham published five volumes of indifferent verse. In London he continued to operate as dealer and agent, notably for William Beckford, for whom he made important purchases, including, in 1799, the two Altieri Claudes. 
Tresham was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1791 and a member in 1799, and was appointed professor of painting in the Royal Academy Schools in 1807, resigning in 1809 because of failing health. He appears to have been something of a cold fish, neither liked nor wholly trusted by his fellow academicians. Farington recorded that 'Shee [Martin Archer-Shee] said He was a weak man, vain, of no judgment, and acted at the instigation of anybody he happens to associate with' (Farington, 'Diary', 5 Jan 1800). Tresham is not known to have married. After some years of unspecified illness, he died on 17 June 1814 in Bond Street, London. He was buried on 29 June.

Tresham, Sir Thomas (d. 1471), administrator and speaker of the House of Commons, was the son of William Tresham (d. 1450) of Sywell and Rushton, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir William Vaux of Harrowden. No doubt his early advancement owed much to his father's influence. In 1443 he shared in William Tresham's appointment to the stewardship and chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster's estates in those counties in which their family had most interests -- Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Huntingdonshire. By 1446 Thomas Tresham was an esquire of Henry VI's hall and chamber: it is his Lancastrian allegiance on the grounds that he had been brought up 'from childhood' in Henry's court. By 1455 he had become an usher of the king's chamber. He was appointed a Huntingdonshire justice of the peace (1446-59) and member of parliament, first for Buckinghamshire (1447), then for Huntingdonshire (1449, twice). In spite of their links with the court, the Treshams had contact enough with Richard, duke of York (died 1460), to go to meet him on his return from Ireland in 1450; shortly after they had left Sywell on 23 September they were set upon, William Tresham being murdered and Thomas wounded. 
Once the court began to regain some ground after its set-backs in 1450, local appointments for Tresham resumed: he was sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire (1451-2), justice of the peace (1452-60) and member of parliament (1453), both for Northamptonshire, and commissioner of oyer and terminer in 1453 for the disturbances in north Yorkshire. In January 1454 he was a sponsor of an abortive bill to establish a garrison at Windsor to protect the incapacitated king -- as distinct from his 'protection' by the duke of York, upon whom such a measure was doubtless intended to be a reflection. He was probably at the first battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455, and was at first denounced as a principal instigator of the violence, but was ultimately spared Yorkist retaliation. As the court recovered its authority after 1456, offices crowded upon Tresham: he was sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire again (1457-8), then of Surrey and Sussex (1458-9), but was also elected (probably for Northamptonshire) to the Coventry parliament of 1459. This assembly, packed especially for the attainder of Yorkists, chose him to be its speaker; in reward for his services the crown granted him $40 yearly from rents forfeited by York. He was then appointed to numerous anti-Yorkist commissions of oyer and terminer. Some time before March 1461 he became comptroller of the royal household. 
Tresham probably fought at the battle of Northampton on 10 July 1460, but later denied the distinction (peculiarly objectionable to Yorkists) of fighting at Wakefield on 30 December. In January 1461 he had joined Margaret of Anjou by the time she reached Durham, and was then at the second battle of St Albans (where he was knighted) on 17 February, and at Towton on 29 March. Before the latter battle he was one of those on whose head Edward IV put a price of $100. In the event, although captured and attainted, he only suffered forfeiture. He secured a general pardon in 1464, was restored to the Northamptonshire peace commission, and in 1467 again represented the county in parliament. He petitioned Edward IV and negotiated with the beneficiaries of his forfeiture (allegedly pledging 2000 marks) for the return of his 'livelihood', with only partial success. Perhaps as a result he became involved in the Lancastrian intrigues of John de Vere, thirteenth earl of Oxford, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London from November 1468 until Henry VI's readeption in 1470. Rewarded then with grants that included the honour and castle of Huntingdon, all to be held for seven years, Tresham probably served in the readeption parliament as member for the seventh time, and as speaker for the second. In April 1471 he joined Margaret of Anjou at Weymouth and was individually denounced as a traitor in Edward's proclamations. With Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset, and others he vainly sought sanctuary in Tewkesbury Abbey after the battle on 4 May 1471, and was beheaded on 6 May. He was buried in Tewkesbury Abbey church. Before 1460 Tresham had married Margaret Lenthall (died 1483/4), sister of William, Lord Zouche. His heir, John, secured the reversal of his father's attainder and forfeiture on Henry VII's accession in 1485.

Tresham, Sir Thomas (c.1500-1559), landowner and prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England, was the only son of John Tresham (died 1521) of Rushton Hall, Northamptonshire. Following the death of Thomas's mother, his father married Isabel (died 1558), daughter of Sir James Harrington of Hornby, Lancashire. The Treshams were a leading Northamptonshire gentry family: Thomas's eponymous grandfather had served Henry VI as comptroller of the household, and was executed following the battle of Tewkesbury; upon the accession of Henry VII his son John was restored to the family's estates, and was named sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1505. Thomas Tresham married Anne, daughter of William, Lord Parr, and together they had at least three sons and a daughter. Following Anne's death, in November 1540 Thomas married Lettice Lee (died in or before 1557), daughter of Sir Thomas Peniston of Hawridge, Buckinghamshire, and successively widow of Robert Knollys (died 1521) and of Sir Robert Lee (died 1539). 
Although an extraordinary esquire of the body as early as 1516 and knighted by 1524, Tresham was no courtier, rarely attending the court save for state occasions such as the arrival of Anne of Cleves (1539) or the reception of the French ambassador (1546). Moreover his military experience under Henry VIII was limited to helping to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace, and to service in the English army sent into France in 1544. But he was active in the government of his native Northamptonshire, where he was both a JP and gaol delivery commissioner. Pricked four times as sheriff (1524, 1539, 1548, and 1555), Tresham's high standing in his native county was reflected in a recommendation of 1532 to Thomas Cromwell that he would make the sort of 'substantial sheriff' the shire needed. He was also a stalwart member of special county commissions. For example, in 1530 he was responsible for preparing an inventory of the lands held by Cardinal Wolsey within the county, while in 1551 he was a county commissioner for assessing the relief, and one of the commissioners appointed to regulate the price of food in local markets. Tresham represented his native county as a knight of the shire in the parliament of 1539, and again in 1542 (and perhaps 1545). His hostility towards religious reform excluded him from the parliaments of Edward VI, although he continued his service as a JP and county commissioner, and served under the earl of Warwick in the suppression of Kett's rebellion. 
Upon the death of Edward VI in July 1553, Tresham moved swiftly to support Princess Mary's claim to the throne. Refusing to muster on behalf of the duke of Northumberland and ignoring the council's orders to recognize Jane Grey as queen, with the support of the citizens of Northampton Tresham proclaimed Mary as queen, and was later placed in command of a company of soldiers which protected her during Wyatt's rebellion. Tresham's decisive actions in July 1553 earned him Mary's gratitude, which took the form of a cash reward, together with the lease of the property of Pipewell Abbey near Rushton. In October 1553 he returned to Westminster as MP for Lancaster, before resuming his rank as first knight for Northamptonshire in the two parliaments of 1554 (as sheriff in 1555 he was ineligible for election). At the same time Tresham served the crown in various unofficial capacities: in May 1554 he escorted Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, from the Tower to Fotheringhay Castle, while during the summer of 1555 he was called upon to investigate seditious bills circulating in the county. As sheriff in August 1557 he also supervised the burning of a Northamptonshire shoemaker for heresy. 
Among the first steps toward the full restoration of the dissolved religious orders in England fervently desired by Queen Mary, in late 1557 it was decided to re-establish the order of St John of Jerusalem in England, with the recently widowed Thomas Tresham as its prior, apparently as a further reward for his earlier loyalty. At Whitehall on 30 November 1557, in the presence of Mary and Cardinal Pole, Tresham and four colleagues took the cross as knights of the order, and Tresham was installed as prior (the order did not receive its landed endowment from the crown, however, until April 1558). Although now a member of the House of Lords, Prior Tresham rarely attended, for he was frequently occupied elsewhere in royal service. In January 1558 he was appointed a commander in the abortive expedition to recover Calais, while in March he was on the Isle of Wight supervising the hasty improvement of defences before an anticipated French invasion. 
Throughout the decades of religious turmoil Tresham remained a faithful Catholic. His devotion was shared by his sister Clemence, formerly a nun at Syon, and inherited by his grandson Thomas, who became a notable Northamptonshire recusant. Upon the accession of Elizabeth, an Italian in Tresham's service reported that his master intended 'to observe the old rite secretly', as he had done during the reign of Edward VI ('CSP Venice', '1558-80', 31). Prior Tresham did not have to conceal his faith for long, however, for he died at Rushton on 1 March 1559, even before the order of St John was dissolved in England and its properties confiscated once more. He was buried on 16 March in St Peter's Church, Rushton, where a fine alabaster monument was erected in the chancel, depicting the prior recumbent in his robes; it was transferred in 1799 to nearby All Saints' Church. Tresham had drawn up his will on 28 November 1557, before embracing the religious life, and amended its contents on 11 September 1558; it was proved by his executors on 4 May 1559. He referred in his will to his buying and selling of lands. He had inherited a rather dispersed estate in Northamptonshire, which he had consolidated into two blocks, centred upon Rushton (his principal seat) and Lyveden respectively. But that was the limit of his achievement, for he made no effort to introduce up-to-date methods of estate management, and it clearly mattered most to him that his heir should come into an unencumbered inheritance. There is an evident note of satisfaction in his reported claim to the latter that 'I shall leave you all your land out of joynture or dower and free from wardshipp, and not a fote of that subject to any statut for inclosure, and verie lytle or none in lease and no part of my rente of inheritance in any sort improved other then my mannor in Houghton' (Finch, 71). All Tresham's sons had predeceased him, and the beneficiary of his outmoded attitude towards his lands was his grandson, another Thomas Tresham, who inherited a valuable estate ripe for exploitation.

Tresham, Sir Thomas (1543-1605), gentleman and recusant, was the son of John Tresham ('c'.1520-1546) and Eleanor (died 1546), daughter of Anthony Catesby of Whiston. Born in September 1543, Thomas became heir at the age of three to the Northamptonshire estates of his grandfather, Sir Thomas Tresham (d. 1559). As ward of Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton, Warwickshire, whose daughter Meriel (died 1615) he later married (1566), a religiously conservative upbringing was likely. It was unobtrusive enough, however, for him -- after study at the Middle Temple from 1560 to 1568 (Edmund Plowden's inn, and notoriously Catholic) -- to become sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1573 and to be knighted at Elizabeth I's visit to Kenilworth in 1575. He was, however, implicated in an assault on an anti-Catholic informer at Kettering in 1576. Robert Persons said he received Tresham into the Roman Catholic church in 1580. If 'scarcely more than a formality' (Anstruther, 112), this moved Tresham to open rejection of the Elizabethan church -- until 1578 he was still having his children baptized in the parish church, but not Thomas in 1580. 
In 1580 Tresham received the Jesuit Edmund Campion at his house at Hoxton, Middlesex; taken before the privy council and then Star Chamber after Campion's capture the following year, Tresham refused to answer under oath to questions tending to self-incrimination. This began his long career of fines and imprisonment: in 1581-3 in the Fleet prison, then under house arrest at Hoxton (1583-7, 1589-93), except for the tense period of 1587-8, when he was committed again. Finally he was sent to his Northamptonshire house at Rushton, which had the disadvantage that his resort to London for legal and financial business required privy council permission. As a final insult, just as recusants began to enjoy greater liberty, Tresham was subjected to legal harassment (leading to further imprisonment) by the ungrateful Catholic family of his brother-in-law William Vaux, Lord Vaux of Harrowden, after the latter died in 1595, leaving his intractable financial embarrassments for Tresham to attempt to disentangle. 
Tresham became spokesman for lay Catholic loyalism, disavowing that temporal obedience to the crown was compromised by obligations of spiritual obedience to the pope. He was probably associated with a petition to this effect in 1583 and certainly with one in 1585. In 1588 he deplored the denial to Catholic gentlemen of their natural right to defend their sovereign; if not trusted with a weapon, he offered to do so unarmed. Such Catholic loyalism was potentially divisive enough for the government apparently to encourage reports that Jesuits 'regarded him as an atheist' (Renold, 255). But it can be overstated: 'beneath the florid and high-flown prose through which Tresham expressed his obedience was a critique of a government consistently and systematically overstepping its bounds' (Kaushik, 52), from his 1581 arrest onwards. 
Despite Tresham's protestations, some of his papers indicate a preference for the dynastic claim of James I, whose accession he hurried to proclaim at Northampton, despite heckling about the pope. He received a promise of an end to recusancy fines and was given a commission for forests -- but the first was vitiated by recusants' resort to the Bye plot and their proposal to make Tresham lieutenant of the Tower; the second did not survive complaints about a tactless two-hour 'discourse' to which he subjected his fellows when accused of harsh estate management. Certainly his estates were a particular target for enclosure rioters. Financial problems did not eliminate traditional gentry pursuits, other than public office. From 1593 he substantially remodelled both his Northamptonshire houses, Rushton and Lyveden, building with an 'almost frightening... intensity' (Airs, 22), though spending a relatively modest $970 in seven years. His individual house and garden designs, embodying Catholic religious symbolism -- most notably in the remarkable triangular lodge at Rushton (1593-7) -- have continued to attract interest, leading to the establishment of a Tresham trail. A Northamptonshire institute of further and higher education has also been named after him. 
Tresham died at Rushton Hall after a painful illness on 11 September 1605 and was buried at St Peter's, Rushton, 'the foremost Catholic layman of the old school' (Anstruther, 277) -- too old school for the conspiratorial antics of his heir, Francis Tresham, which ensured the latter survived him by only three months. Sir Thomas Tresham was long cited as the archetypal gentleman ruined by recusancy fines, but this has now been refuted. He was $11,500 in debt at his death, and had $3000 of debts even in 1582. Having paid $7720 for recusancy clearly contributed to the increase, but not as much as his $12,200 spent on marriage portions for six daughters married ambitiously, notably to Catholic peers including William Parker, Lord Morley. Over $3000 in bribes and fines had gone in 1601 to buy the life of Tresham's son Francis after the Essex rising. Despite an aggressive and far from conservative estate policy, increasing his income to perhaps $3500 p.a., he had failed to economize sufficiently to fund his recusancy. It was his younger son, Sir Lewis Tresham, bt (1578-1639), who succeeded in decisively dissipating the family fortune.

Tresham, William (d. 1450), lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons, was the son of Thomas Tresham, and was apparently a native of Northamptonshire, where he was to become an influential landowner. Elected one of the two knights of the shire for the county in 1423, he acted again in that capacity in another eleven parliaments (1427, 1429, 1432, 1433, 1435, 1439, 1442, 1445, 1447, and February and November 1449). From 1424 until his death, moreover, he was a Northamptonshire JP. For a man whose origins do not appear to have been particularly distinguished, advancement in his home county went hand in hand with, indeed probably depended upon, advancement at the centre of national affairs. Having trained as a lawyer Tresham was certainly intermittently in the king's service from at least 1415, when he was an auditor of the accounts of royal officials in south Wales. 
Little is known of Tresham's activities in the 1420s, when he may have concentrated on his legal career, but that he prospered is shown by his becoming a councillor to the duke of Buckingham in 1430; he continued to receive an annual fee from the duke until at least 1447. In 1432 he was appointed one of his two attorneys-general by Cardinal Henry Beaufort, and during the 1430s was also appointed to a number of commissions by the crown. In 1434, for instance, he was named to a commission to investigate concealments of royal revenues in Northamptonshire, and in 1439 to inquire into the value of crown lands in that county. He also forged a connection with the king's household, possibly by 1434, certainly from 1441. The tie was essentially a legal one: Tresham was employed as an apprentice-at-law, and in that capacity was paid nearly $10 for his work in the parliament of 1435. It was doubtless on the basis of such experience that in 1439 he was elected speaker of the Commons, at a time when there was a call for the reform of the royal household. 
In May 1440 Tresham was granted an annuity of $40 by the king, and in September that year was one of the feoffees to whom the estates of alien priories were entrusted, as the endowment for Henry VI's foundation at Eton. Elected speaker again in 1442 and 1447, he continued to be employed by the crown, to an increasing extent through the duchy of Lancaster. Already steward of the duchy estates in Northamptonshire by 1437, he was retained as an apprentice-at-law from 1444 to 1447. In 1446 he was one of the feoffees of the duchy estates reserved for the implementation of Henry VI's will, and in 1448 was appointed chancellor of those feoffees. In 1449 he became chancellor both of the duchy and of the county palatine of Lancaster. Favour at court led to Tresham's being employed in politically sensitive legal cases; in 1444 he was one of the commissioners appointed to investigate charges of treason against Thomas Carver, while in 1447 he heard indictments of treason against members of the household of Humphrey of Gloucester. In August 1450 he was himself indicted in the aftermath of Cade's rebellion, suggesting that he was regarded as a leading member of the regime headed by the duke of Suffolk in the late 1440s. 
Shortly after the indictment was made, but in circumstances unconnected with it, Tresham died by violence. When parliament assembled at Westminster in November 1449 he was elected speaker for the fourth time, and so was the spokesman of the Commons in their impeachment of Suffolk in 1450. In 1448 he had been chosen as a feoffee by the duke of York, and in either that year or 1449 had also become a councillor to the duke, but there is no evidence that such Yorkist connections were other than purely professional, or that Tresham's links with the court were weakened thereby. Nevertheless, his ties with York helped to bring Tresham to his death. On 22 September 1450 he was at his Northamptonshire residence of Sywell, intending to meet York as the duke made his way to London. But Tresham was tricked into revealing his movements to a group of his enemies, local men with whom he was engaged in a dispute over property, and early next morning they ambushed him at Moulton and killed him. Perhaps in order to demonstrate his continuing royalism, Tresham was wearing his collar of the king's livery. With his wife, Isabel, daughter of William Vaux of Harrowden, another Northamptonshire lawyer, Tresham had a son, Thomas Tresham, who was wounded in the attack that killed his father. Thomas had followed William Tresham into the king's household, and remained a staunch Lancastrian for the rest of his life, being executed after the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.William Tresham's wife also survived him.

Tresham, William (1495-1569), priest, was born in the parish of Oakley Magna, Northamptonshire, the son of Richard Tresham of Newton, Northamptonshire, and Rose Billing of Astwell, granddaughter of Sir Thomas Billing, lord chief justice. He studied at Merton College, Oxford, and graduated BA on 16 January 1515, MA in 1520, BTh in 1528, and DTh on 8 July 1532. In 1526 he was ordained priest. From 11 March 1524 to 11 February 1529 he served as registrar of the university. He occupied the office of vice-chancellor in 1532-47, 1550, 1556, and 1558, and was a canon of Cardinal College between 1529 and 1531. In 1527 he was king of the beans at Merton, and was also the college's first bursar (1521-2), third bursar (1526-8), and third dean (1524-6). Upon the transformation of Cardinal College -- first to King Henry VIII College, then to Christ Church -- Tresham became a canon, occupying the second stall in 1532-5 and in 1546-60. While a canon he oversaw the enlargement of the priory house. He served as vicar of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford, in 1534-7, and of Bampton, Oxfordshire, in 1554-60. He was admitted chancellor of Chichester in 1539, but had been deprived by 1560; he was deprived of his canonry of Lincoln the same year, and of his rectory of Bugbrooke, Northamptonshire. However, he held the Northamptonshire rectory of Towcester until his death. 
Occasionally caught up in the religious controversies of his age, Tresham was a theological conservative throughout his career. His preferment in the refoundation of Cardinal College, along with his appointment as a canon of the new diocese of Oxford by royal charter in 1542, are usually seen as connected to his support for the king's divorce from Katherine of Aragon and the subsequent religious policies of Henry's reign. But he may simply have been deft at understanding the system of patronage and promotion within the Tudor church; surviving letters show him appealing to Wolsey, Cromwell, and the king to be generous in their support, and he even informed them of ill incumbents and possible vacancies. This, of course, does not deny a sincere religious conviction, and indeed Tresham appears to have enjoyed a reputation for being forthright, active, and intelligent. In 1535 he was a member of the commission for spiritualities in Oxfordshire, and in 1540 sat on a commission appointed to evaluate the grounding of church rituals in scriptural doctrine; it issued 'A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Chrysten Man', popularly known as the 'King's Book', in 1543. In 1549 Tresham joined William Chedsey and Morgan Philips in a public debate with Pietro Martire Vermigli (known as Peter Martyr), supporting the doctrine of the real presence in the eucharist against Martyr's more Calvinist position. An account of the debate by Tresham was sent to the privy council with the title 'Disputatio de eucharistiae sacramento' (BL, Harley MS 422), and was published under Martyr's name the same year. 
Tresham was committed to the Fleet for his conservative religious position and criticism of church policy under Edward VI on 21 December 1551, but returned to freedom and church affairs with the accession of Mary I in 1553. In 1554 and 1555 he was one of the conservatives who debated with Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley on issues of orthodoxy and faith. This disputation was represented in an anonymous publication of 1554, later quoted in large part by John Foxe's 'Acts and Monuments'. Also in 1554 he met Cardinal Pole to discuss the threatened spoliation of the building that once housed St Mary's College, Oxford, an institution for Augustinian canons which had closed in 1541. On behalf of the university Tresham and Thomas Raynolds, warden of Merton, offered congratulations to Elizabeth I upon her succession. But with his refusal to take the Elizabethan oath of supremacy, Tresham was stripped of all preferments except the rectory of Towcester and placed at Lambeth Palace in the custody of Archbishop Parker. Having made promise upon security that he would not interfere in religious affairs as established by law, he was allowed to retire to Northamptonshire, where he died in 1569. He was buried in the chancel of Bugbrooke church.

Tresilian, Sir Robert (d. 1388), justice, was a native of Cornwall, owning land at Tresillian, near Merther, though his early career was in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. He received payments for legal advice to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1354-6. On 3 June 1359 Tresilian was recorded as an attorney, and in 1365 as a charter witness in Berkshire. He was a JP in Berkshire in 1367 and in Oxfordshire in 1368. Tresilian maintained links with Cornwall, however, for in 1369 he was probably counsel in a Cornish assize case, and in that year he served as knight of the shire for the county. On 7 December 1369 an order to Hugh Courtenay, earl of Devon, recorded that the admiral had judged a case with two justices and Robert Tresilian, 'all learned in the law' ('CClR, 1369-1374', 59). By 10 February 1370 Tresilian was serving as JP for Cornwall and he served on many Cornish commissions thereafter. He also accounted for the earl of Stafford's rents in Cornwall in 1372, and on 12 August 1376 was appointed to a commission on the Devon stannary, along with the earl of Devon. Perhaps it was due to his Courtenay connections that on 10 September 1377 Tresilian was appointed to a commission headed by William Courtenay, bishop of London, relating to the custody of the properties of Enguerrand (VII) de Coucy ('c'.1340-1397). On 21 February 1378 he was described as steward of Cornwall. 
By this time Tresilian had become a servant of the crown. In Michaelmas term 1375 he became a king's serjeant, and on 6 May 1378 he was appointed a justice of king's bench. Exactly a month later, on 6 June, he became a knight, being made a banneret at Windsor, with robes given him by the king. Despite his new duties, Tresilian continued to serve in Oxfordshire, where he was again appointed JP on 28 June 1378, and had several other commissions there and in Cornwall. On 10 September 1378, however, he was replaced as steward of Cornwall, though apparently serving again in that capacity before 1385. 
Tresilian remained a puisne justice of king's bench until June 1381. On 12 December 1379 he was empowered to receive cognitions and issue certificates even though he was not a justice of common pleas. During these years he served on local commissions not only in the south-west but also in Staffordshire and Wales. These duties were interrupted by the peasants' revolt in June 1381, during which Sir John Cavendish, chief justice of king's bench, was killed. On 22 June Tresilian was appointed to succeed Cavendish, and according to both Knighton and Walsingham he dealt extremely harshly with the rebels, putting heavy pressure on juries to convict, and sentencing those convicted to brutal punishments. Tresilian presided over the execution of John Ball, the rebel preacher, on 14 July 1381, and also that of William Grindcobbe, the leader of the townsmen of St Albans, in October 1381, and of John Wraw, the rebel leader in Suffolk, in May 1382. 
As the 1380s progressed Tresilian not only continued to serve as chief justice of king's bench, and as a member of numerous commissions in south and south-west England, but also became increasingly involved in national politics, whose often bitterly partisan character inevitably made him a controversial figure. On 27 May 1384 he was appointed with John, first Lord Montagu, steward of the household, to try Friar John Latimer, who had accused the duke of Lancaster of treason. Before the steward could act, however, Latimer was tortured to death by John Holland, Lancaster's future son-in-law. On 18 July following Tresilian received a pardon, not only for treasons and felonies, but also for sales of the laws of the land and other judicial misconduct of the sort with which he was later charged. Another controversial case arose on 9 September, when Montagu, Tresilian, and Sir Robert Bealknap, chief justice of common pleas, were ordered to try John Northampton, the former mayor of London, and his allies, who claimed the support of the duke of Lancaster. Tresilian wished to refer the case to the new mayor of London, but was nevertheless present when Northampton was condemned to life imprisonment at Tintagel, Cornwall. 
Tresilian took a stronger line against Lancaster the next year. According to Walsingham, the king and his friends planned to arrest the duke, and Robert Tresilian 'boldly mainperned' that he would sentence Lancaster as his crimes deserved. These activities have been identified with a plot in which young courtiers planned to murder Lancaster on 14 February 1385, but the duke escaped. It is a measure of Richard II's trust in Tresilian that at this very time, on 15 February, he should have been retained for life of the king's council, with a yearly fee of 100 marks from the issues of Cornwall and Devon (which he undertook not to collect while receiving other fees), while on 24 February following he was granted the keeping of Conerton Manor in Cornwall. He also appears to have recovered the stewardship of Cornwall, since on 12 December 1385 he was once more replaced in that office. 
On 19 November 1386 parliament appointed a commission to restrain the king and his advisers, particularly the chancellor, Michael de la Pole, who was impeached. In the following year it was probably Tresilian who drafted the questions about the commission and impeachment, the so-called 'questions to the judges', which were presented to the other royal justices in meetings at Shrewsbury (1-5 August) and Nottingham (25 August). They all sealed answers declaring that the commission was illegal, the impeachment invalid, and those restricting the royal power punishable as traitors. Later Bealknap and other justices said they signed under threat of death. The response of the king's adversaries was swift and drastic. On 17 November 1387 Thomas, duke of Gloucester, Richard, earl of Arundel, and Thomas, earl of Warwick, later joined by Henry, earl of Derby (son of the duke of Lancaster), and Thomas, earl of Nottingham, appealed Sir Robert Tresilian along with Robert de Vere, duke of Ireland, Michael de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, Alexander Neville, archbishop of York, and Sir Nicholas Brembre (former mayor of London) ['see 'Lords appellant]. The charges against Tresilian were primarily of giving 'aid and counsel' to the chief 'traitors', meaning de Vere, de la Pole, and Neville, but of particular relevance to him were accusations of assembling the justices without the assent of the continual council set up under the commission of 1386, and of making very suspicious demands of them (a reference to the 'questions to the judges'), and also of manipulating legal cases to their own profit (something Tresilian had demonstrably done). 
De Vere's attempt to fight the appellants was defeated, and the latter took control. On 4 January 1388 they ordered that Tresilian be imprisoned at Gloucester, but on the same day he was also referred to as a fugitive. Froissart says Tresilian reached Bristol, and there told the king he would return to London to spy on the appellants. But the king was not actually at Bristol, and Tresilian is more likely to have hidden in the London area. 
Tresilian was summoned to answer the appeal in parliament and on failing to appear was condemned by default, on 13 February 1388. Six days later he was found hiding in disguise in Westminster. His discovery caused a sensation, coming when proceedings against the king's supporters were at their height. According to Favent, Tresilian was spotted as he observed proceedings from the roof of a house next to Westminster Palace, and was subsequently discovered hiding under a table, heavily bearded and wearing eccentric clothes, so that he looked more like a pilgrim or beggar than a royal justice. Knighton attests the strange clothes and adds that the beard was false, and that Tresilian was recognized by his distinctive voice. He was dragged out to cries of 'We havet hym', and brought before parliament. He claimed the sanctuary of Westminster Abbey, but Gloucester denied the claim. Attempts to argue that the procedure against him had been founded in error were likewise brushed aside, and the original sentence was quickly carried out. Tresilian was drawn on a hurdle to Tyburn, where physical force was needed to make him ascend the scaffold. His clothes, which were found to be filled with protective charms, were stripped off, and he was hanged naked, finally having his throat cut. 
Tresilian's wife, Emmaline (Emma), who had screamed and fainted at his arrest, claimed his body for burial at Greyfriars in London. She was the daughter of Richard Hiwish of Devon, and had married Sir Robert by 20 April 1377 as the widow of Richard Recote of Oxfordshire; she later married Sir John Colshull of Cornwall and died in 1403. With Tresilian she had a son, John, and at least two daughters, Joan and Emma. Tresilian had become a wealthy man. Following his execution one of his servants was ordered to answer to the king for 1000 marks from his late master's property, and he had estates in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire, and above all Cornwall. Many of his lands in the latter county had come to him by marriage, but petitions for redress after his death suggest that Tresilian had also added to them by misusing his judicial authority. In spite of such complaints, and despite the opposition of John Tresilian, much of Sir Robert's forfeited land was acquired by John Hawley the elder, a Dartmouth merchant and pirate, who had married Emma Tresilian. 
Sir Robert Tresilian may have been ruthless in his interpretation of the law for private and political ends, but as one of the principal intellectual architects of the 'high' doctrine of the royal prerogative, he had a lasting if often unfortunate influence.

Trevelyan, Sir Charles Edward, first baronet (1807-1886), administrator in India, fourth son of George Trevelyan (1764-1827), archdeacon of Taunton, and his wife, Harriet (1773-1854), third daughter of Sir Richard Neave, baronet, was born at Taunton on 2 April 1807. His widowed mother, Harriet Trevelyan, was among five Trevelyan family members who received nearly $27,000 in compensation for enslaved people on their Grenada estates after slave emancipation. He was educated at Taunton grammar school, at Charterhouse School from 1820, and at East India College, Haileybury. He entered the East India Company's Bengal service as a writer in 1826, having displayed from an early age a great proficiency in Indian languages. On 4 January 1827 he was appointed assistant to Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, the commissioner at Delhi, where, during a residence of four years, he was entrusted with several important missions. His time at Delhi, however, was perhaps most famous for his role in the 'breaking' of the resident, Sir Edward Colebrooke, for corruption. Before leaving Delhi he also contributed from his own funds to the building of a broad street through a new suburb, which subsequently became known as Trevelyanpur. In 1831 he moved to Calcutta, and became deputy secretary to the government in the political department. On 23 December 1834 he married Hannah More, sister of Lord Macaulay, who was then a member of the council of the governor-general of India, and one of his closest friends. She died on 5 August 1873, leaving a son, later Sir George Otto Trevelyan, baronet, and two daughters. 
Trevelyan was especially interested in education, and had an important influence on Macaulay's celebrated minute of 1835, promulgating the teaching of European literature and science in India. In April 1836 he was nominated secretary to the Sudder board of revenue, which office he held until his return to England in January 1838. In India Trevelyan was, Macaulay recorded: 'a most stormy reformer... Lord William [Bentinck] said to me... 'That man is almost always on the right side in every question; and it is well that he is so, for he gives a most confounded deal of trouble when he happens to take the wrong one.' (Macaulay to Mrs Cropper, 7 Dec 1834, 'Life', 278)' On 21 January 1840 he became assistant secretary to the Treasury, London, and held this office for the next nineteen years. No civil servant did more to place the Treasury in its modern role of watchdog of the whole of the civil service. Trevelyan's zeal for retrenchment ill equipped him for his role of co-ordinator of relief during the Irish famine of 1845-7 and he gained a reputation for brutal complacency (though his employment schemes had some success). He encouraged the passing of the 'Poor Law Extension Act' in 1847, which gave the Treasury greater influence over the use of poor-law funds. Trevelyan was determined that relief should be financed by the raising of local rates rather than through grants from the Treasury. This involved him in a prolonged dispute with Edward Twistleton of the poor-law commissioners. 'The Irish Crisis' (1848) summarizes Trevelyan's views. In 1848 Trevelyan was made KCB for his work in Ireland. In 1852-3 he helped with reports on several government departments. One of these, by a Treasury minute written by Gladstone and dated 12 April 1854, led to the brief report known as the Northcote-Trevelyan report ('Report on the organisation of a permanent civil service'), one of the most famous documents of recent British history, which scathingly condemned the patronage system of civil service appointments and recommended open examination and promotion by merit, and sketched what became the administrative grade. 
In 1858 Trevelyan was offered the governorship of Madras in succession to Lord Harris, and entered upon his duties in the spring of 1859. He was principally responsible for organizing a new police system and for establishing rights in land, which freed it from encumbrances and made it saleable in fee simple. In February 1860 James Wilson, financial member of the viceroy's council, proposed a plan of severe retrenchment and taxation by which he hoped to improve the financial position of the Indian government. On 4 March Trevelyan and the council of Madras sent a sharply critical response back to Calcutta by open telegram. For this they were censured and, at the same time, the representative of the Madras government in the central legislative council of India was prohibited from following the instructions of his superiors by laying upon the table and advocating the expression of their views. On 21 March a telegram was sent to Madras stating that the bill would be introduced and referred to a committee, which would report in five weeks, whereupon Trevelyan and his council recorded their opinions in a minute and, on the responsibility of Sir Charles alone, passed the document to the newspapers. On the arrival of this intelligence in England Trevelyan was at once recalled. This decision occasioned controversy both in and out of parliament. Palmerston, while defending the recall, spoke in praise of Trevelyan's character; and Sir Charles Wood, the president of the Board of Control, said: 'A more honest, zealous, upright, and independent servant could not be. He was a loss to India, but there would be danger if he were allowed to remain, after having adopted a course so subversive of all authority, so fearfully tending to endanger our rule, and so likely to provoke the people to insurrection against the central and responsible authority. ('Hansard 3', 11 May 1860, vols. 1130-61)' Trevelyan's temporary disgrace was made more significant by his later triumph. In 1862 he went back to India as finance minister, an emphatic endorsement of the justness of his former views. His tenure of office was marked by increased government expenditure and by extensive measures for the development of public works. On his return home in 1865 he became involved in the question of army purchase, on which he had given evidence before the royal commission in 1857; he developed his views in 'The British Army in 1868' (1868). Later his name was associated with a variety of social questions, such as charities and pauperism, on which he published several pamphlets. In 1874 he was created a baronet. He was a staunch Liberal, and gave his support to the Liberal cause in Northumberland, while residing at Wallington in that county, which he had inherited from his cousin Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan in 1879. Sir Charles married second, on 14 October 1875, Eleanora Anne (died 1919), daughter of Walter Campbell of Islay. He is drawn by Trollope in 'The Three Clerks' (1857) under the name of Sir Gregory Hardlines. He died at his home, 67 Eaton Square, London, on 19 June 1886.

Trevelyan, Raleigh (1781-1865), writer, was born on 6 August 1781, the younger son of Walter Trevelyan (1743-1819), sheriff of Northumberland, and his first wife, Margaret, elder daughter and coheir of James Thornton of Netherwitton, Northumberland. Walter was the second son of Sir George Trevelyan, third baronet, of Nettlecombe Court, Somerset. 
Raleigh was educated at Eton College and at St John's College, Cambridge, from which he graduated BA in 1804 and MA in 1807. He was an able classical scholar and in 1806 he obtained the senior bachelor's medal for a Latin essay. On 11 November 1801 Trevelyan entered Lincoln's Inn and in 1810 he was called to the bar, but on the death of his elder brother, Walter Blackett Trevelyan, on 3 April 1818, he succeeded to the Netherwitton estates and relinquished his practice. He married, on 14 June 1819, Elizabeth, second daughter of Robert Grey of Shoreston, Northumberland. 
Trevelyan passed the remainder of his life chiefly in Northumberland, where he indulged his literary tastes and his conservative tendencies by writing poems and political pamphlets. The former were marked by elegance and scholarship, the latter by unusual moderation. His poems include 'Elegy on the Death of the Princess Charlotte' (1818) and 'A Poetical Sketch of the Ten Commandments' (1830?). 'Essays and Poems', a collection of his work, was printed in 1833. Trevelyan died at Netherwitton Hall on 12 May 1865. He was succeeded at Netherwitton by his grandson Thornton Roger Trevelyan.

Trevelyan, Sir Walter Calverley, sixth baronet (1797-1879), naturalist, was born on 31 March 1797 at Newcastle upon Tyne, the eldest son of Sir John Trevelyan, fifth baronet (1761-1846), and his wife, Maria (died 1852), daughter of Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson. Educated at Harrow School, where W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-1877) was a scientific crony, he proceeded in 1816 to University College, Oxford, becoming a keen geologist under William Buckland's guidance and an accomplished antiquary who contributed to Hodgson's 'History of Northumberland'. Having graduated in 1820 he moved to Edinburgh to extend his scientific interests. In 1821 he visited the Faeroe Islands to study their natural history and in 1823 was the first to demonstrate the intrusive nature of the Whin Sill in Northumberland. From 1822 Trevelyan was an ardent phrenologist who supported a Combeian school in Edinburgh, opposed capital punishment and flogging, argued for state education to prevent crime, and condemned alcohol, tobacco, and opium as morally degrading. Having rejected a possible wife on phrenological grounds, in 1833 he met Paulina Jermyn (1816-1866) ['see 'Trevelyan, Paulina Jermyn, Lady Trevelyan], eldest daughter of the Revd G. B. Jermyn, at the British Association for the Advancement of Science; they married on 21 May 1835. 
In 1846 Trevelyan succeeded to the title and family estates. As a wealthy landlord he practised scientific agriculture and promoted the well-being of his tenants. In 1853 he refurbished Wallington, Northumberland, as a Pre-Raphaelite showpiece, aided by his artistic wife, a painter and lace designer who was friendly with Ruskin, the Carlyles, and Swinburne. They also developed Seaton, Devon, as a resort. 
Trevelyan continued to maintain his antiquarian interests, co-editing a volume of 'Trevelyan Papers' for the Camden Society. He also maintained a large collection for natural history and ethnology at Wallington and generously gave specimens and money to museums. He backed Pitman's movement for spelling reform, becoming president of the derided Phonetic Society. As a political Liberal in 1865 he bought an estate at Tynemouth, where a relative was an election candidate, for $61,000 to secure the tenants' votes; after the election he sold it. As a tolerant Anglican and total abstainer, he collaborated with dissenters in campaigning for the prohibition of alcohol. From 1853 to his death he was president of the United Kingdom Alliance for Suppression of the Liquor Traffic and in 1854 president of the National Temperance Society. 
Trevelyan was of foppish appearance, with careless dress and long moustache and hair, but he was a courageous opponent of social and intellectual tyranny and an aristocratic eccentric who fought for causes to the last. Among his eccentricities was a mania for concrete, which culminated in 1877 with the opening of his Axe Bridge at Seaton, England's second concrete bridge. Following the death of his first wife, on 11 July 1867 Trevelyan married Laura Capel, daughter of Capel Lofft, of Troston Hall, Suffolk. He died at Wallington on 23 March 1879 from a cold and was buried simply, as he wished, at Cambo, Northumberland, on 1 April 1879. His wife died the next day. Both his marriages being childless, the title descended to his nephew, Alfred Wilson Trevelyan (1831-1891) but Trevelyan left Wallington to his cousin, Charles Edward Trevelyan (1807-1886).

Trevenen, James (1760-1790), naval officer in the British and Russian services, was born at Rosewarne, near Camborne, Cornwall, on 1 January 1760, the third son of John Trevenen, curate of Camborne, and Elizabeth, 'nee' Tellam (died 1799). He was educated at Helston grammar school and from 1773 at the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth, where he studied for three years. 
In the spring of 1776 Trevenen was appointed to the 'Resolution', then fitting out for the last voyage of Captain James Cook. From her, in August 1779, he followed Captain James King to the 'Discovery'. On 28 October 1780, on the return of the expedition to Britain, he was promoted lieutenant, and early in the following year he was appointed to the 'Crocodile', then commanded by King, in the North Sea and in the channel. In the summer of 1782 he again followed King to the 'Resistance', which went out to the West Indies in charge of convoy. On 2 March 1783 she fell in with and captured the French frigate 'Coquette', then returning from taking possession of Turk's Island. A few days later the 'Resistance' and some smaller vessels under the orders of Captain Horatio Nelson in the 'Albemarle', attempted to recapture Turk's Island, but without success. Trevenen returned home in July 1783, and spent most of the next two years in Italy. 
In 1786 Trevenen had an idea for a merchant voyage to Nootka Sound, and a small company was discussed, but the project fell through. He considered service in the East India Company and also applied to the Admiralty for employment in connection with the new settlement at Botany Bay. However, opportunities 'out of the common routine of sea duty' as he put it, were limited; thereafter Trevenen developed a disgust for the Admiralty that he thought slow to recognize his -- as yet unproved -- merit. 
In February 1787 Trevenen discussed a scheme to voyage to the north Pacific with the Russian ambassador in London. After approval by the Russian government, Trevenen was ordered to St Petersburg, as he believed, to take command of the project. Before his departure he was warned by friends, including his brother-in-law, Charles Vinicombe Penrose, that should he accept the post he would be required to serve in the Russian navy in the event of war with Turkey. On reaching St Petersburg Trevenen discovered that the Turks had indeed declared war against Russia, that the expedition was postponed, and that he was expected to serve in the navy with the rank of second captain. He agreed to this, subject to the consent of the English Admiralty. Assuming that this would be given, he accepted the command of a ship intended for the Mediterranean. In late 1787 he received the Admiralty's refusal. Considering himself bound to the Russians, he sent a letter in which he resigned his commission. However, his friends did not forward his letter, and it does not appear that the Admiralty ever knew officially of his disobedience. 
The outbreak of the war with Sweden in 1788 prevented Trevenen's being sent to the Mediterranean, and in July he took command of the 'Rodislav' (64 guns) in the fleet of another British officer in Russian service, Admiral Samuel Greig. In late July Trevenen was involved in the Russians' disappointing engagement with the Swedes near Hogland. In the following month he was sent in command of a small squadron to Hango Head, cutting the communication between Stockholm and the Swedish ports in the Gulf of Finland. This blockade he maintained until the close of the season, and on his return to Kronstadt he was promoted to captain of the first class. In May 1789 Trevenen was again sent to his station off Hango Head, but during the winter the Swedes had thrown up several batteries. He was therefore recalled, and joined Admiral Chichagoff at Reval. In mid-July they joined a division of the fleet which had wintered at Copenhagen, but on 25 July they found themselves in the presence of the Swedish fleet. A desultory engagement followed, the fleets separated without any result, and Chichagoff joined the Copenhagen squadron and returned to Reval. Trevenen was then sent to occupy Porkala Point and to destroy the batteries in Baro Sound. On his return to Reval at the end of October the 'Rodislav' was run on a submerged reef and became a total wreck. A court martial decided that the pilot alone was to blame, and Trevenen was appointed to the 'Ne Tron Menya' at Kronstadt under the command of Admiral Kruse. At Kronstadt in February 1789 Trevenen married Elizabeth (died 1845), daughter of John Farquharson; they had one daughter. 
In May 1790 Admiral Kruse put to sea with sixteen ships of the line, wishing to effect a junction with Chichagoff at Reval. The Swedish fleet of twenty-two sail of the line interposed, and on 3 June a sharp action was fought, renewed on the following day, without any decided advantage to either side. Kruse was able to join with Chichagoff, and the Swedes fell back into Viborg Bay. On 3 July 1790 they made an ineffectual attempt to force their way out, but in the action Trevenen received wounds from which he died on board his ship at Kronstadt on 9 July. He was survived by his wife, who later married the editor Thomas Bowdler.

Treveris, Peter (fl. 1525-1532), printer, was perhaps a foreigner, as many early London printers were, though nothing is known of his birth, early years, private life, or death. According to 'The Grete Herball' printed on 27 July 1526 he lived in Southwark at the house called Wodows (wild people). He probably lived here while in London, since he always refers to Southwark whenever he includes his location in an edition. His device, a shield hanging from a tree supported by a wild man and woman, was common at this time. His first dated book is Hieronymus Braunschweig's 'Noble Handiwork of Surgery', printed on 26 March 1525 at Southwark, to which his edition of 'The Grete Herball' refers: 'it geveth understandynge of the booke lately prentyd by me' (title-page). Two undated and unsigned volumes, 'Arnold's Chronicle' and William Lily's 'Rudimenta', may have been printed by Treveris in 1525. 
Treveris's output consisted mainly of small grammatical treatises, which had usually been printed by others before him. His most significant publications were the 'Noble Handiwork of Surgery', possibly translated by the printer and bookseller Lawrence Andrewe, 'The Grete Herball', a reprint of the 'Polychronicon' in black letter 'at the expences of J. Reynes' (1527), and John Skelton's 'Magnyfycence', printed for John Rastell (1530). He printed other works for Rastell, including 'A C Mery Talys' (1526). He co-operated with other printers: some copies of 'The Grete Herball' contain Andrewe's device, and book 4 of Robert Wyer's 1531 edition of Richard Whitford's translation of Thomas a Kempis's 'De imitatione Christi' was apparently printed by Treveris. He copied an ornamental compartment used by Thierry Martens of Louvain for his edition of 'Magnyfycence' and at least two other editions. A book with the title 'This horryble monster is cast of a sowe in a vyllage which is called lebe[n]hayn M.CCCCC & xxxi', originally printed in Germany, had its original title substituted by Treveris. Two school texts without printer's name from perhaps 1526-7 were said to be for sale at John Thorne's shop ('ap. J. Thorne') in Oxford, though there is no evidence that Treveris ever worked there ('STC, 1475-1640', 15574, 18833a). 
Some of Treveris's grammatical texts were printed with or for Rastell, and others probably for Wynkyn de Worde, as Treveris's border pieces are found in them. Rastell's editions of 'Sir Eglamour' (1528?) and 'A Dialog of the Poete Lucyan' (1530?) may have been printed by Treveris. The other English works Treveris printed include an edition of 'Christmas Carols' (1528?), the verse 'A Merry Jest of an Old Fool with a Young Wife' (1530?), and 'A Lytell Treatyse agaynst Mahumet and his Cursed Secte' (1530?). Treveris claimed that some of his later editions of grammatical works by John Stanbridge and Robert Whittinton had been carefully emended (for example, 'impressum diligenterque correctum'; 'Declinationes nominum', 1531, title-page), though how far this is true has not been researched. 
Treveris seems to have been printing until 1532. Because his material was used by Thomas Raynald from 'c'.1539, Treveris probably died in the mid-1530s. Some of his books, especially the 'Handiwork of Surgery' and 'Polychronicon', are notable for their woodcuts. Although the latter is neatly printed, most of his work is less attractive.

Trevet, Sir Thomas (d. 1280/81), justice, came of a small landowning family in Somerset; the Ralph Trevet who preceded him as lord of Durborough in that county must have been his kinsman, but may not have been his father. Thomas is first recorded in 1241, when he made several appearances as an attorney on the bench, and he pursued a legal and administrative career thereafter. In 1255 he was one of two knights instructed to act with commissioners selling woods in Somerset to pay royal debts, and at about this time he was at least twice a colleague of Henry of Bratton as an assize justice in Somerset. He was also steward to the abbots of Athelney and Glastonbury, in 1256 serving the latter as a justice itinerant within the liberty of the twelve hides of Glastonbury. In 1260 he was an assessor of tallage in the south-western counties, and in 1262 he twice headed commissions to deliver Ilchester gaol. 
In the political crisis of the mid-1260s Trevet appears to have been regarded at first as a royalist, since in March 1264 he was among those whom Henry III summoned to come armed to Oxford. But he may have seemed to waver in his loyalty to the king, for after the battle of Evesham (4 August 1265) he was suspected of Montfortian sympathies and his lands were taken into the king's hand; his estate at North Barsham in Norfolk was given to a royalist and not recovered until March 1266. But Trevet clearly managed to prove his loyalty to the crown, for on 2 April 1268 he was appointed a justice itinerant, with a salary of $40 per annum, on the circuit of eyres headed by Richard Middleton in the south-west and midlands between then and July 1269, while in 1272 he served in a similar capacity under Ralph Hengham on eyres in Herefordshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. Between the eyres he took assizes in Somerset, Devon, and Dorset, and in 1269 was an assessor of that year's twentieth in Dorset. He did not act as a justice itinerant again after 1272, but during the 1270s he was several times a justice of assize and gaol delivery and a commissioner of oyer and terminer. 
Thomas Trevet was still alive in July 1280, when he attended that year's Somerset eyre, but was dead by 5 March 1281. By 1254 he had married Eleanor, daughter of Joan Braunche, who brought him his lands in Norfolk. However, fines from the mid-1250s suggest that this marriage was then fairly recently contracted, and since Trevet's heir at his death was his son William, who was said at that time to be aged forty, it seems likely that Thomas had also made an earlier marriage. The chronicler and Dominican friar Nicholas Trevet was a younger son, and may have owed something of his religious vocation to his father, since in April 1263 Thomas Trevet gave the black friars of Ilchester a messuage in the suburbs of that town, and was consequently received by the prior 'into all the benefits and orisons in his church' ('Feet of Fines... Somerset', 1.204).

Trevisa, John (b. c.1342, d. in or before 1402), translator, is of Cornish origins. Though his exact birthplace is unknown, his name implies that he came of a Cornish family from one of the places called Trevessa or Trevease. He was admitted to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1362 and remained as a fellow until 1369, when he became a fellow of the Queen's College. From this date he is referred to as 'magister'. In 1370 he was ordained priest to the title of the Queen's College, where from 1376 he became involved in a movement of opposition to the appointment of a new provost, Thomas Carlisle. In 1379 he is named along with the former provost, Henry Whitfield, and others, as excluded from the college 'for unworthiness'; they were required to return property (including twenty-four books whose titles are listed in a separate indenture) which they had removed from the college on their expulsion. Trevisa eventually returned to the college, renting rooms there between 1383 and 1387 and from 1394 to 1396. 
It was probably in 1374 that Trevisa became vicar of Berkeley, Gloucestershire, and there is evidence for 1379 as the date of his appointment as the Berkeley family's chaplain in two papal bulls of that date (2 Urban VI) granting Lord Thomas and his wife, Margaret, licence to choose a 'fit and discreet' priest as their confessor. At Berkeley, Trevisa was also a canon of Westbury-on-Trym by 1390, in which year legal documents obscurely record a dispute in 1388-9 over Trevisa's right to his prebend of Woodford and his stall at Westbury; the dispute involved an alleged assault on the dean by a band of Trevisa's supporters, and armed occupation of the disputed stall in Westbury church and of the presbytery at Woodford. Also in 1390 Trevisa granted power of attorney to two fellow clerks in preparation for a journey abroad, the destination of which is unrecorded. This would not have been his first taste of foreign travel, for in two interpolations in his translation of Ranulf Higden's universal history, 'Polychronicon', he claims to have visited Aachen, Aix-les-Bains, and Breisach. It is known that Trevisa had died by May 1402, for a successor to the living of Berkeley, which had become vacant by his death, was appointed at that time. According to local tradition, he was buried in Berkeley church. 
Trevisa's original writings are not extensive, comprising some 7000 words of prose interpolation in his translations and in addition the 'Dialogue between a Lord and a Clerk' (a fictional representation of a dialogue about translation between his patron and himself) and the dedicatory 'Epistle', which together formed the prefaces to his translation of the 'Polychronicon'. His style in these original pieces is strikingly direct, giving the effect of authority and plain-spokenness (in the 'Dialogue' dramatically projected in the speech of the lord). 
Trevisa's reputation as a writer, however, rests principally on his translations of encyclopaedic works from Latin into English, undertaken with the support of his patron, Thomas (IV), the fifth Baron Berkeley, as a continuous programme of enlightenment for the laity. The 'Polychronicon' translation was completed in April 1387 and survives in fourteen manuscripts (of which the two earliest, though not autographs, are assigned a Berkeley provenance) and in a Caxton print of 1482. The scientific encyclopaedia 'De proprietatibus rerum' of Bartholomaeus Anglicus was completed in February 1399 and is extant in eight manuscripts; it was printed by Wynkyn de Worde 'c'.1495. A third lengthy translation attributed to him, 'De regimine principum' by Giles of Rome, was published in 1997 from the single extant manuscript. 
The antagonism towards the regular orders and ecclesiastical establishment displayed in two shorter works translated by Trevisa, Fitzralph's sermon against the friars, 'Defensio curatorum', and the dialogue formerly attributed to William Ockham, 'Dialogus inter militem et clericum', on the limitation of the temporal power of the church, is echoed in some of his interpolations in the 'Polychronicon'. In the 1370s and 1380s Trevisa's periods of residence in the Queen's College, Oxford, partly coincided with that of Wyclif and his associates, but there is no evidence that he worked with them on their translation of the 'Bible' (or that he produced at any time a translation of the 'Bible' himself). Like them, however, he was engaged in opening to the laity (in his case the baronial laity), through translation into the increasingly important vernacular, areas of knowledge formerly the preserve of ecclesiastical, Latin learning.

Trevithick, Richard (1771-1833), engineer, was born near Carn Brea in the parish of Illogan, Cornwall, on 13 April 1771, the only son and youngest of the six children of Richard Trevithick (1735-1797) and Anne Teague (died 1810). The elder Richard, a practical miner, worked in a number of the copper mines in the extensive Camborne-Illogan-Redruth mining district and rose to become captain (manager) of Wheal Chance, Wheal Treasury, East Stray Park, and the famous Dolcoath mine. At Dolcoath he constructed the deep adit (drainage tunnel) in 1765 and about 1775 erected a Newcomen pumping engine. 
It was against this background that the younger Richard Trevithick grew up. He was indulged by his mother Anne, and at his local elementary school in Camborne he soon earned a reputation for obstinacy, disobedience, and truancy. However, it was acknowledged that he was quick-witted in an unconventional way and he showed himself to be good with figures. He was also extremely practical, a gift complemented by his proverbial strength. He grew to be 6 feet 2 inches tall and was powerfully built. As a youth he was a renowned wrestler in the Cornish style, and it was alleged that he could hurl a sledge-hammer from ground level clean over the top of a mine engine-house. In Cornwall and elsewhere he became known as the Cornish Giant. He earned a reputation as being gentle and courteous, but to those who knew him there was also a volatile and rash side to his nature. 
Although Trevithick received no theoretical training beyond his basic schooling, he existed in an environment steeped in practical mining and engineering; he learned quickly from his father at the family home at Penponds, near Camborne, and from others active in the local mines. The years of Trevithick's childhood and youth were exciting and innovative ones in Cornwall. The introduction of Watt engines in the Cornish mines in the 1770s made redundant the slower, less reliable, and inefficient Newcomen variety and stimulated a new era of experimentation as Cornish engineers strove to evade the Watt patents. The lapse of the patents in 1800 heralded the great age of Cornish steam engineering, epitomized as it was by the emergence and subsequent perfection of the Cornish engine, the development of which Trevithick was to facilitate. 
Trevithick married into another mining and engineering family. On 7 November 1797, at St Erth, he married Jane Harvey (1772-1868/9); they had four sons and two daughters. His wife was the daughter of John Harvey of Hayle foundry, Hayle, Cornwall, which became one of the most significant in the county, producing machinery and components for mines and other establishments at home and abroad. Curiously, however, the relationship between Trevithick and the Harveys never reached its full potential, failing to move beyond that of manufacturer and customer. 
As early as 1792 Trevithick was engaged to report on the performance of a new engine at Tincroft mine, near Camborne, and in 1795 he was able to introduce fuel-saving improvements in an engine at Wheal Treasury. By 1797 he was engineer at Ding Dong mine, near Penzance, where he improved an engine designed by William Bull, and shortly afterwards he installed an improved Bull engine at Herland mine. James Watt had already identified Trevithick as his arch-rival in the patent tussle but to the Cornish people he was now something of a local hero, known affectionately as Cap'n Dick. 
By 1800, in a profound departure from Watt's reliance on low pressure, Trevithick had introduced his double-acting high-pressure steam engine, an innovation which opened the way for both the evolution of the Cornish engine and the invention of the steam locomotive. Although high-pressure engines were more expensive to build than their contemporaries, they were much more efficient in their use of coal -- an important consideration in Cornwall, where fuel had to be imported from south Wales. Trevithick's new engines were known as 'puffers' (to distinguish them from the noiseless condensing engines) and were probably first installed at Dolcoath to wind copper-ore to the surface. A whim (winding) 'puffer' is also said to have been installed at the neighbouring Cook's Kitchen in 1800 and was observed to be still in operation there as late as 1870. 
About 1802 Trevithick built a small stationary engine for Coalbrookdale in Shropshire (it operated at the unheard-of pressure of 145 lb per sq. in.), but in 1803 he suffered a serious reversal when one of his new high-pressure engines, employed to pump water from the foundations of a mill under construction at Greenwich, exploded with the loss of four lives. Although Trevithick was able to demonstrate that the accident was a result of human error, this did not prevent James Watt and Matthew Boulton from issuing dire warnings about the dangers of high-pressure steam and the folly of attempting to harness it. Trevithick responded with a range of new safety measures, most notably the 'fusible plug' which has remained a standard feature of steam engine design for over 150 years. 
Convinced of the flexibility and potential of high-pressure steam, as early as 1806 Trevithick considered the design of new boilers to improve the performance of existing Boulton and Watt pumping engines. However, he was not able to bring this idea to fruition until about 1812, when he harnessed his new 'Cornish boilers' to existing engines at Dolcoath. Put simply, the Cornish boiler was horizontal and cylindrical, with a fire tube running through the middle. Following the success of the Dolcoath experiment, in 1812 Trevithick further applied the Cornish boiler at Wheal Prosper (in Gwithian parish) when he used high-pressure steam in both expanding and condensing modes, in effect creating the first prototype for what was to be known (and employed) around the world as 'the Cornish engine'. Although others had been experimenting with high-pressure steam, it was Trevithick who had first applied it successfully in an industrial context. 
The second outcome of Trevithick's experimentation with high-pressure steam was the steam locomotive. The concept was not new. In 1770 a primitive proto-locomotive had been built in Lorraine, France, by Nicholas Joseph Cugnot, but its tractive effort was virtually non-existent. Similarly, an experimental locomotive constructed by William Murdock in Redruth, Cornwall, in 1786 proved powerless and unworkable. Trevithick, in contrast, had by 1797 successfully demonstrated at least one working model of a high-pressure steam locomotive. In the previous year he had met Davies Giddy Gilbert, the Cornish technocrat who was to emerge as a major sponsor and advocate of 'improving' and 'progressive' causes, and together the two men worked to produce a full-size version of Trevithick's locomotive. This is said to have been constructed at Stephen Williams' foundry at the Weeth, Camborne, and it was given its first public demonstration on Christmas eve 1801, an event recorded in the words of the well-known Cornish folk-song 'Camborne Hill': '
Goin' up Camborne 'ill, Comin' down, 

Goin' up Camborne 'ill, Comin' down, 

The 'osses stood still, the wheels went aroun', 

Goin' up Camborne 'ill, Comin' down! 
(Rowse, 128)' A few days later, on 28 December 1801, the locomotive was being driven from Camborne to nearby Tehidy, the seat of the Basset family, when it broke down. The support team adjourned to the local hostelry, allowing the locomotive to overheat and become severely damaged. 
Despite this set-back, with the assistance of his cousin Andrew Vivian and the Cornish scientist Sir Humphry Davy, Trevithick secured a patent for his locomotive on 24 March 1802. Then, in early 1803, a second locomotive was built at Camborne. This version was exhibited in London where it made several successful demonstration runs into the suburbs. However, it suffered a twisted frame, an occurrence which persuaded Trevithick's partners in the project, including Andrew Vivian, to withdraw their support. Undeterred, Trevithick continued the project at the Penydarren ironworks, near Merthyr Tudful in south Wales, where by late 1803 he was employed as engineer. 
It was at Penydarren that Trevithick constructed what was the first railway locomotive. The first trial of the locomotive took place on 13 February 1804, and on a demonstration run on 21 February it hauled a load of 10 tons of iron, seventy men, and five wagons for a distance of 91/2 miles at an average speed of 5 m.p.h. Unfortunately, the permanent way at Penydarren proved unequal to its new task of supporting a railway locomotive, and soon the poorly laid track caused a derailment, after which Trevithick's invention was relegated to the status of stationary engine. However, the locomotive's success was undoubted. It had demonstrated the feasibility of the railway locomotive as a concept, and in so doing had also proved important principles such as the adhesion to rails, as well as establishing enduring railway engineering practices such as the use of coupling rods. 
Four years later a new Trevithick locomotive, 'Catch-me-who-can', was exhibited in July and August of 1808 on a circular railway, or 'steam circus', near Gower Street in London. Rides were available at 1's'. a head but the enterprise was not a financial success. It was brought to an end when the track again proved inadequate, resulting in a broken rail. Thereafter, having again successfully demonstrated the inherent capability of the steam locomotive, Trevithick seems to have lost interest in this particular project. However, his contribution had been outstanding. As early as 1805 his assistant John Steele had built a Trevithick-designed locomotive at the Wylam colliery in the north-east of England. It was in the north-east that further innovation was achieved, which led to the emergence of the 'Newcastle school' of George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson. 
From 1803 to 1807 Trevithick had been engaged to improve a steam dredger at work in the River Thames, and during this period he became interested in a project to drive a tunnel under the river. In 1805 Robert Vazie (a Cornish engineer) had been contracted to construct a tunnel northwards from Rotherhithe but, encountering certain difficulties, he decided to seek Trevithick's involvement in the scheme. Trevithick took charge of the construction during August 1807, but on 23 September -- by which time the tunnel had progressed some 950 feet -- water broke in and the work was inundated. Trevithick himself was the last to leave the scene, and was almost drowned. Subsequently, he made a number of suggestions as to how the project might be resumed and improved, but the tunnel was abandoned. 
Trevithick remained in London, however, and in 1808 he was joined there by his wife Jane and their family. He went into business with a West Indies merchant, Robert Dickinson, setting up a small works in Limehouse. Various patents and inventions emerged (not least the 'Nautical Labourer', a steam tug and floating crane propelled by a paddle wheel), and iron tanks for storing cargo and water in ships were manufactured. However, the business was not a success. There were disagreements between the two partners, and in 1810 Trevithick was ill with typhus. In February 1811 he and Dickinson were declared bankrupt. Dickinson appears to have escaped most of the ensuing financial burden, Trevithick paying off the majority of the outstanding debt and receiving his discharge in 1814. 
Trevithick and his family returned to Cornwall in September 1810, as he began to recover from his illness, and it was during the next few years that he was able to develop the potential of his Cornish boiler and high-pressure 'plunger-pole' engine. In 1812 at Hayle foundry he built a steam engine designed specifically to drive a threshing machine. It was applied with great success on Sir Christopher Hawkins's Trewithen estate at Probus, near Truro, where it was in operation for seventy years. 
By 1814 Trevithick was beginning to take an interest in the attempts to revive the ancient silver mines of Cerro de Pasco in Peru. He was approached by Francisco Uville, one of the promoters of the proposed reworking, with a view to designing and building equipment for the mines. His response was positive and immediate, and on 1 September 1814 four pumping engines, four winding engines, a portable rolling-mill engine, and much else was shipped from Portsmouth for Peru. Although three of Trevithick's associates had travelled with the engines to ensure their effective installation and operation, Trevithick decided that he too should journey to South America. He sailed from Penzance on 20 October 1816, arriving in Lima to an extravagant reception in February 1817. In all, he was to be abroad for some ten years -- a decade of turmoil, change, success, and disappointment. 
Despite the warm welcome that Trevithick had received, it soon became apparent that his presence was resented by Uville. Trevithick decided to explore elsewhere in Peru, inspecting mines and becoming involved in the development of a copper and silver mine in the province of Caxatambo. But this was a time of increasing political volatility in Peru, as the war of independence from Spain became widespread and disruptive. For a time Trevithick was attached to Simon Bolivar's forces, designing a form of carbine for his use, but no sooner was he released from military service than Caxatambo was occupied by the Spanish army. Trevithick was forced to flee, abandoning expensive equipment and some $5000 worth of stockpiled ore. In 1818 Uville died and Trevithick returned to Cerro de Pasco to take charge of the workings. However, his efforts were again frustrated by war when in 1820 a battle took place at the mine and there was much damage to the machinery. 
After this set-back Trevithick decided to leave Peru, travelling through Ecuador 'en route' for Bogota in Colombia. He met a certain James Gerard who informed him of potential mining opportunities in Costa Rica. The two men resolved to investigate these possibilities and they visited a range of sites in Costa Rica, identifying and securing the rights for a number of gold and silver prospects. To raise capital to exploit these finds they decided to return to Britain. They crossed the isthmus of Nicaragua on foot (the first Europeans to do so); this was a traumatic journey in which, on one occasion, Trevithick was almost drowned crossing a river and, on another, was menaced by an alligator. From San Juan de Nicaragua they made their way to Cartagena in Colombia, arriving penniless and half-starved. 
By a strange coincidence Robert Stephenson was also in Cartagena. In August 1827 Trevithick and Stephenson met, Trevithick exclaiming, 'Is that Bobby? I've nursed him many a time' (Rolt, 139) -- a reference to Trevithick's visit to Newcastle upon Tyne in 1805. Stephenson lent Trevithick $50 to pay his fare home, and Trevithick arrived back in Falmouth on 9 October 1827. After a decade's adventuring in South America, his only possessions were the clothes he wore, a gold watch, a draughtsman's compass, a navigator's compass, and a pair of silver spurs. 
Although Trevithick received a hearty welcome home in Cornwall, he had been largely forgotten in the rest of Britain, and his belated attempts to seek royalties from his various patents proved largely unsuccessful. Likewise, a petition presented on his behalf to the government in February 1828 was disregarded. These were blows for Trevithick who, with little personal wealth to promote his endeavours, was largely dependent on income from consultancies, commissions, and sponsorships. James Gerard, meanwhile, had landed in Liverpool in late 1827, and together the two men tried to interest London investors in their Costa Rican proposals. Trevithick turned down what he considered to be a paltry offer of $8000 from one speculator for his mineral rights, but shortly afterwards Gerard died in Paris. Thereafter, the Costa Rican project lost its momentum and was soon abandoned. 
Despite these financial failures, Trevithick's energy and capacity for invention remained undiminished. In 1828 he was invited to visit the Netherlands to investigate the possibility of using Cornish engines for drainage purposes. It is said that he had to borrow the $2 fare to make the journey, but once in the Netherlands he made a number of suggestions concerning the drainage of submerged land and the construction of dikes. He subsequently designed equipment for use in the Netherlands; it was built at Hayle foundry but for some reason never delivered. 
Among other inventions from this period were a closed-cycle steam engine (1829), a portable room heater which was in effect an early form of storage heater (1830), and a design for a ship propelled by a water-jet (1832). Trevithick also designed an enormous column 1000 feet high to commemorate the 'Reform Act' of 1832, a proposal which aroused considerable public attention but was not taken up. His last patent, dated 22 September 1832 (no. 6308), was in connection with the employment of superheated steam. 
At some time in the late 1820s or early 1830s Trevithick entered into an agreement with John Hall of Dartford, Kent, to carry out developmental work on a steam engine of Hall's design. However, Trevithick fell ill and, after a week's confinement in bed in his lodgings at The Bull inn in Dartford, he died on 22 April 1833 at the age of sixty-two. To avoid having a parish funeral for Trevithick, his workmates clubbed together to cover the funeral costs. Trevithick was laid to rest in an unmarked grave in Dartford on 26 April 1833. 
Trevithick's wife, Jane, lived to the age of ninety-six. She had remained loyal to him during long years of financial difficulty and separation. (She had received no money from him during his South American sojourn, during which time she was supported by her brother, Henry Harvey.) Of their six children, Francis Trevithick (1812-1877) became chief mechanical engineer of the London and North Western Railway Company, and Frederick Henry Trevithick constructed the floating steam bridge between Portsmouth and Gosport in 1864. Little is known of Richard (1798-1872), John Harvey (1806-1877), Ann, or Elizabeth. 
In June 1888 Trevithick was celebrated in a 'Trevithick window' in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey, London, in which he was depicted in the guise of St Piran, the patron saint of Cornish miners. However, he has remained somewhat historiographically invisible, despite a laudatory biography written by his son Francis in 1872 and more modern biographies by James Hodge (1973; repr. 1995), L. T. C. Rolt (1960), and others. The unsatisfactory aspects of Trevithick's own life and the early demise of Cornwall as a centre of steam engineering no doubt assisted the process by which the 'Newcastle school' of George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson gained general recognition as the 'inventor' of the railway locomotive. Only in Cornwall, where the Saturday nearest to the anniversary of his death is celebrated as Trevithick day, are his achievements widely recognized.

Trevor, Arthur Hill-, third Viscount Dungannon (1798-1862), politician, was born in Berkeley Square, London, on 9 November 1798. He was the only surviving son of Arthur Hill-Trevor, second viscount (1763-1837), and his wife, Charlotte, third daughter of Charles Fitzroy, first Baron Southampton. 
Trevor's great-grandfather, 
His son, Arthur Hill-Trevor, was educated at Harrow, and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 17 October 1817, graduating BA in 1820 and MA in 1825. He married, on 10 September 1821, at Leghorn, Sophia, fourth daughter of Colonel Gorges Marcus Irvine of Castle Irvine, co. Fermanagh. She died on 21 March 1880. 
In 1830 Hill-Trevor was elected as MP for New Romney, and in the following year for the city of Durham. He was a vigorous opponent of the reform bills of 1831-2, both in the house and outside it. On 30 August 1831 he moved an amendment to the effect that the existing non-resident freemen should keep their votes during their lives. In the course of the year Hill-Trevor issued an anti-reform pamphlet in the guise of a 'Letter to the Duke of Rutland'. When the bill was reintroduced he again contested it, and published another pamphlet exhorting the peers to stand firm. At the dissolution he lost his seat, but was re-elected at Durham in the election of 1835. He vigorously opposed municipal corporation reform, regarding it as an attempt to extend the parliamentary franchise indirectly, and put himself forward as the defender of the freemen, moving to omit the clause disfranchising them (23 June 1835); he was defeated by a majority of forty-six. In February 1837 he obtained the rejection of the motion of Sir William Molesworth for the repeal of the property qualification for members of parliament. He seconded the motion of Peter Borthwick for the revival of convocation (3 May), and also his proposal for the establishment of a system of national education in connection with the church (2 June). During this parliament he several times introduced a measure for the control of beershops, but met with little support. He forbade any of his tenants to set one up. In the session of 1839 he opposed the 'Irish Municipal Corporation Bill' as an attempt to put down protestantism. In 1841 he joined Sir Robert Harry Inglis in opposing the further restriction of capital punishment, which he thought should still be inflicted in cases of arson, midnight burglary, and some other offences. While a member of the Commons he always singled out for attack the radical section of his opponents. He was more than once denounced by O'Connell, who on one occasion referred to him ironically as 'the meek and modest representative of the clergy of Durham'. 
Hill-Trevor, who had succeeded his father as third Viscount Dungannon in 1837, was defeated at the general election of that year and, though elected at a by-election in April 1843 for his former constituency, was immediately afterwards unseated on petition. In September 1855 he was elected a representative peer for Ireland, and henceforth took an active part in the proceedings of the House of Lords. His strongest efforts were directed against legislation dealing with the marriage laws. He himself led the opposition to the 'Divorce Bill' of 1857, and two years later (22 March 1859) moved the rejection of Lord Wodehouse's 'Marriage Law Amendment (Deceased Wife's Sister) Bill'. His speech on the latter bill was printed the same year. On 27 May 1862 he led the opposition to Lord Ebury's motion for the abolition of clerical subscription. 
Dungannon was a member of several learned societies. He published, besides several pamphlets, 'The Life and Times of William III' (2 vols., 1835-6), dedicated to Edward Nares, regius professor of modern history at Oxford; the book was written with the assistance of Henry John Todd, archdeacon of Cleveland, and with access to the documents at Stowe, but is of slight historical value. Dungannon died at his London home, 3 Grafton Street, on 11 August 1862 and, having no male children, his titles became extinct.

Trevor, George (1809-1888), writer and Church of England clergyman, was born at Bridgwater, Somerset, on 30 January 1809, the sixth son of Charles Trevor, a customs officer. His paternal grandmother, Harriet, was the sister of Horatio and James Smith, the authors of 'Rejected Addresses' (1812). Trevor was educated at a day school at Bridgwater, and in 1825 entered the East India Company office in London as a clerk; there he was contemporary with John Stuart Mill. In London he made the acquaintance of the Disraeli family. On 6 February 1832 he matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, managing to keep his terms while discharging his duties as clerk. He was a prominent speaker at the Oxford Union, where he caused a furore in 1835 by accusing the treasurer, Edward Cardwell, of falsifying the accounts -- a charge he was forced to withdraw. On 12 July 1836 Trevor married Elizabeth (died 1879), daughter of Christopher Garrick of Richmond, Surrey, the grandson of George Garrick, brother of David Garrick. They had several children. 
Having resigned his clerkship the previous year, Trevor was ordained priest in 1836, and in order to qualify for an East India chaplaincy took an honorary fourth class in civil law. That year he was assigned to the Madras establishment, and from 1837 to 1845 ministered at Bangalore, where he built St Paul's Church and founded a Tamil mission. 
On his return to England, Trevor graduated BA in 1846 (MA, 1847) and was appointed resident deputy of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the province of York. In 1847 he was instituted rector of All Saints', Pavement, York, and at the same time received a non-residentiary canonry in the cathedral, with the prebendal stall of Apesthorp. In 1850 he was appointed by the burgesses of Sheffield to be chaplain of their parish church, and took up his residence in the town. He was, however, prevented from preaching in the church by successive vicars, Thomas Sutton and Thomas Sale, who were suspicious of his high-church views on sacramental theology. Responding to their suspicions, he asserted his Anglican orthodoxy in a series of lectures on the Reformation, which drew large crowds. Although his right to the chaplaincy and its endowments was established by proceedings in chancery and the queen's bench, he remained barred from the pulpit and returned to York in 1855. 
Since 1847, when he was elected proctor for the chapter of York, Trevor had taken a leading part in the movement for the revival of the northern convocation, whose meetings had become a mere formality, thus depriving the clergy of a forum for debate. His work on the history of the two convocations ('The convocation of the two provinces, their origin, constitution, and forms of proceeding, with a chapter on their revival', 1852) had considerable influence on clerical opinion, but progress was blocked during the lifetime of Archbishop Thomas Musgrave (1788-1860). The northern convocation finally met on 23 March 1861, and Trevor was appointed synodal secretary the following year. He did much to make the revived body broadly representative. 
Trevor was a forceful and popular preacher, but in his latter years at All Saints' found his congregation drawn off by the rival attraction of the services in the minster. In 1868 he retired to the living of Burton Pidsea in Holderness, and in 1871 was translated to the rectory of Beeford. In 1874 he was made an honorary DD by Holy Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, in recognition of his work 'The Catholic Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist' (1869; 2nd enlarged edn, 1875), a vindication of the older high-church doctrine. A prolific author, Trevor also wrote three works on India, as well as books on the history of Egypt, Rome, and Russia. He was a contributor to 'Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine' from as early as 1833, and was well known for his articles in the national press. In 1886 he was made an honorary DD by the University of Durham. 
Trevor died on 18 June 1888 at the rectory of his son, George Wilberforce Trevor, at Marton, near Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, and was buried at Beeford. A memorial tablet was erected to his memory in the north aisle of the choir of York Minster where he had been a canon for forty-one years.

John Trevor (d. 1410/1412), bishop of St Asaph, was a native of Powys. He was educated at Oxford, becoming BCL in 1381 and doctor of civil and canon law by 1389. Between 1382 and 1391 he accumulated canonries and prebends in the dioceses of St Asaph, St David's, Wells, Hereford, and Lincoln, often by papal provision. In the meantime, on a vacancy's occurring (December 1389) in the see of St Asaph, John was elected by the chapter and obtained a royal licence (2 March 1390) to go to Rome to secure the pope's confirmation of their choice. But Urban VI had, as he feared, already appointed Alexander Bach to the post. He settled at Rome as auditor of causes and papal chaplain, and was more fortunate when St Asaph again fell vacant in August 1394; the chapter once more elected him, and Boniface IX issued a provision in his favour. He was consecrated at Rome on 17 April 1395. As bishop he was known for his sumptuous court and table and for his patronage of Welsh poetry. The greatest contemporary Welsh poet, Iolo Goch, addressed two odes ('cywyddau') to him. 
Richard II employed John in negotiations with Scotland in 1397-9, and in discussions about the schism. But the bishop was one of the first to desert him, thereby obtaining from Henry Bolingbroke the post of chamberlain of Chester and Flint (16 August 1399) even before Richard was actually a prisoner. The captive king handed John the seals at Lichfield on 24 August 'in the presence of Henry, duke of Lancaster', who, after his accession, confirmed him in the post (1 November 1399), which he retained until 1404. 
John was a member of the parliamentary commission which pronounced sentence of deposition on Richard in September 1399, and he read the sentence in full parliament before Henry took his seat on the vacant throne. After a mission to Spain to announce Henry's accession to his brother-in-law, Enrique III of Castile, John accompanied the English army into Scotland in August 1400. In February 1401 he allegedly warned parliament of the danger of driving Glyn Dwr and the Welsh to extremes, but his comments were treated dismissively. His protest was no doubt sharpened by the exposed position of his diocese. His revenues, impaired by the rebellion, had to be made up a few months later by a licence to hold 'in commendam' the church of Meifod with the chapels of Welshpool and Guilsfield. He acted as the prince of Wales's deputy in north Wales in the early months of 1402, and on 22 April 1403 the prince made him his lieutenant for Chester and Flint. He came to the prince's muster before Shrewsbury at the head of ten esquires and forty archers, and probably fought on the winning side in that battle on 23 July 1403. But his loyalty was shaken when the Welsh burnt his cathedral, palace, and three of his manor houses. Reduced to poverty, he was aggrieved that the king did nothing for him directly, and, refusing to be dependent on the bounty of the archbishop of Canterbury, he stole away in the summer of 1404 and joined Glyn Dwr. His goods were seized and the chamberlainship was granted to Thomas Barneby. He was deprived of the temporalities of his see by royal command on 27 August 1405; but the proposal to transfer him to the see of St Andrews was aborted. He was granted the revenues of up to four benefices in the diocese of Rheims in July 1410 to make good the loss of income from his diocese. 
On joining Glyn Dwr's cause, John became one of the rebel leader's most active and influential supporters. He was sent to co-ordinate policies with Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, in July 1405 and subsequently fled with the earl to Scotland. According to Adam of Usk, he was dispatched twice to France to raise military support for the Welsh cause. Given his international standing and diplomatic experience, he may well have played a key part in drafting the most ambitious political and ecclesiastical policies of Owain Glyn Dwr in 1405-6, including the Tripartite Indenture and the switch of allegiance to the Avignon papacy. 
According to Adam of Usk John died in Rome on 5 October 1412; but some historians have suggested that the epitaph to 'John bishop of Hereford ['sic'] in Wales' in the infirmary chapel of the abbey of St Victor in Paris commemorates John Trevor's death there in April 1410. It has been claimed that John Trevor was the author of a treatise on heraldry, which he also translated into Welsh, and of the life of St Martin, as well as of other historical works; but there is no conclusive evidence that this was so. He is not infrequently confused with his namesake, John Trevor or Trefor, who preceded him as bishop of St Asaph, 1346-57.
