Lushington, Thomas (1590-1661), author and theologian, was born at Sandwich, Kent, and baptized at Hawkinge, near Folkestone, on 2 September 1590, one of four children of Ingram Lushington (Lussyngtoun) and his wife, Agnes. He matriculated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, on 15 March 1607, and graduated BA in 1616 from Lincoln College. In the interval he held some public employment. He proceeded MA at Lincoln College in May 1618, and afterwards returned to Broadgates Hall to study theology. Sir Thomas Browne, author of 'Religio medici', was his pupil there. 
Audacious in the pulpit and unconventional out of it Lushington made his mark preaching at St Mary's, Oxford, on Easter Monday 1624, when he denounced the popular desire for war with Spain, and spoke contemptuously of the House of Commons -- 'the peasant' who 'under pretence of his privilege in parliament... would dispose of kings and commonwealths' ('Hist. U. Oxf.' 4: '17th-cent. Oxf.', 583). His sermon, delivered with wit and gusto, gratified some of his hearers, who interrupted with cheers, but not the authorities. The vice-chancellor reprimanded him and insisted on a recantation of his views the following Sunday. The edition of the two sermons by Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, 'The Resurrection of our Saviour Vindicated' (1741), claimed that they had been 'formerly published under the feign'd name of Robert Jones D.D.', but no firm evidence of seventeenth-century English editions has come to light. 
In the altered circumstances of the later 1620s Lushington's views were no bar to preferment. He proceeded BD in July 1627 and DD in June 1632, and became the friend and chaplain of Richard Corbet, dean of Christ Church and then from 1628 bishop of Oxford. On 10 June 1631 he was presented by Bishop William Laud to the prebend of Beminster Secunda in Salisbury, in succession to Corbet, and in 1632 he accompanied Corbet on his translation to Norwich. In 1633 he became vicar of Barton Turf and of Neateshead, Norfolk, and in 1636 of Felixstowe and Walton, Suffolk. In 1639 he was presented by the king to the rectory of Burnham Westgate, Norfolk, and in 1640 he became rector of Burnham St Mary, Burnham St Margaret, and Burnham All Saints. 
During the civil war Lushington lost all these livings and turned to writing. At some time he had begun to study Socinian works, which had been circulating in England for the first time from about the 1620s. In 1646 he published, as G. M., 'Expiation of a Sinner', a translation of a commentary on the epistle to the 'Hebrews' by Johannes Crellius and Jonas Schlictingius, the Socinian exegetes, and a notable innovation in English divinity. 'The Justification of a Sinner' (1650) was a similar translation, this time of the epistle to the 'Galatians', like its predecessor not verbatim, but rather a free paraphrase with considerable additions by the author. At every point Lushington followed his Socinian authorities. Christ is subordinate to God the Father, and far from being a substitute for the sins of humanity, Jesus is the bringer in of good news and forgiveness, the exemplar of God's love for mankind. This moral doctrine of the atonement appealed to Lushington and marked him out as an exceptional theologian. His writings were vigorously attacked by Edmund Porter in 'God Incarnate' (1665), and Lushington's refusal to acknowledge the Pauline authorship of 'Hebrews' greatly annoyed his critic, but 'New Testament' scholarship has since vindicated the conclusion that the epistle is non-Pauline. 
Two more of Lushington's works appeared in 1650. A treatise on the theology of Proclus survives in manuscript and his 'Logica analytica', edited by Nicholas Bacon, the first of what was intended to be a two-part work, was published. Noteworthy is the author's use of the phrase 'Right Reason', which was to be characteristic of both Oxford and Cambridge latitudinarians. 
In 1660 the surviving bishops sought to warn the returning Charles II against accepting Lushington's services as a chaplain until his suspect opinions could be investigated. While he apparently regained his livings he declined further preferment. He died at Sittingbourne, Kent, on 22 December 1661, and was buried four days later in the south chancel of the church. No trace remains of the monument erected in his memory by his kinsman and heir, Thomas Lushington of Sittingbourne, with its eulogy of the character and learning of this high-church 'heretic'.

Lutterell, John (d. 1335), theologian, is of unknown origins. He was ordained a priest before 1304, having received a papal dispensation for illegitimacy, and he was later granted dispensations of non-residency to permit him to enjoy the income from his benefices while in residence in Oxford. By 1317 he held the degree of DTh. In July of that year, probably in response to a university supplication, he was made a canon at Lichfield with expectation of a prebend, and in December 1319 he was made canon of Salisbury with the prebend of Axford. On 10 October 1317 he was elected chancellor of the university, and soon afterwards travelled to the Roman curia at Avignon in order to pursue the university's case against the Dominicans at Oxford. The friars were contesting an award made by arbitrators in 1313, on a dispute between the Dominicans and the university, over the latter's control of admission to the degree of bachelor of theology. Lutterell returned to England in 1318, where he was one of the two representatives of the university to argue their side of the case before Cardinal Gaucelin, which was decided largely in favour of the university. 
Lutterell had become involved in a dispute with other masters and scholars at Oxford by the summer of 1322. Despite many statements to the contrary, there is no evidence that this matter concerned either his philosophical or theological views, or his opposition to William Ockham's teaching, and its causes remain obscure. The opposing masters appealed to the bishop of Lincoln, who removed Lutterell from office before the beginning of August. They also appealed to the king, who on 12 August blocked Lutterell's attempt to take the matter abroad to Avignon, either in person or in writing. Lutterell and a delegation from the university presumably appeared before the king at York in October, as ordered, although mandates for royal letters of introduction to the pope on Lutterell's behalf had been issued on 30 August 1322. 
Lutterell left for Avignon soon after 20 August 1323 to present his case to the pope. He was summoned to return to England by Edward II in May 1325, but by that time he was serving on a papal commission to examine the orthodoxy of the 'Questions on the 'Sentences'' of Ockham, who had been called to the papal curia in the summer of 1324. John XXII intervened to permit Lutterell to remain at Avignon. Lutterell extracted fifty-six propositions from Ockham's work and wrote a treatise quoting and attacking these 'errors'. The commission on which Lutterell served dismissed twenty-three items, either because the majority on the commission did not believe they were false, or because they concerned philosophical as opposed to theological issues. In the end, two lists of fifty-one erroneous propositions were drawn up in 1326, but no official condemnation emerged. After a year or two back in England, Lutterell returned to Avignon early in 1329 with letters of commendation from John Grandison, bishop of Exeter. By October 1329 he had returned to England, and in May of the following year Grandison recommended Lutterell to the dean and chapter at Salisbury as a candidate for that vacant see. Nevertheless he was unsuccessful. In April 1334 Lutterell was made a canon at York, with the prebends of Bickhill and Knaresborough. He returned to Avignon in 1330, 1332, and 1333, and served alongside Walter Chatton on the commission to investigate the views of Durand de St Pourcain and Thomas Waleys regarding the beatific vision in the summer of 1333. He died in Avignon on 17 July 1335. 
In theological terms Lutterell was a realist, and in his 'Libellus contra Ockham' relied frequently on the positions of Thomas Aquinas. He also wrote a letter, 'Epistula de visione beata', in support of John XXII's views on the beatific vision. Apart from references to his 'In vesperiis magistrorum', nothing has remained from his teaching at Oxford.

Isaack Luttichuys (bap. 1616, d. 1673), painter, was baptized at the Dutch church, Austin Friars, on 25 February 1616. In 1638 he signed and dated a portrait of Anne Blaeu, mother of the Dutch poet P. C. Hooft, and a resident of Amsterdam. In 1643 he married Elisabeth Winck at Amsterdam, but she soon died, bequeathing their baby daughter 1000 guilders in October 1645. He had remarried by 21 January 1647 NS; his second wife was Sara Gribert (or Grabey or Grelant). Isaack was principally a portraitist, though he occasionally made still lifes. He seems to have encountered financial difficulties in his last years; in 1668 he had to pawn twenty-one paintings and some household effects to honour a debt of 793 guilders. He was buried in the Westerkerk at Amsterdam on 6 March 1673 NS.

Luttichuys, Simon (bap. 1610, d. 1661), painter, son of Barent Luttichuys, was born in London and baptized at the Dutch church, Austin Friars, London, on 6 March 1610. His parents presumably returned to the Netherlands when he was young; his brother Isaack's first dated portrait betrays a Dutch training. Simon, however, is not recorded in the Netherlands until 1649, when he and his sick wife, Anneke van Peene, made a joint will at Amsterdam. In 1655 he was married at Amsterdam for a second time, to Johanna Cocks of 'Naerfick' in England. He worked mainly as a still-life painter, and influenced the celebrated Willem Kalf, who finished one of Luttichuys's pictures after his death. In 1660 at Breda he painted portraits of Charles II, James, duke of York, and Henry, duke of Gloucester, which were engraved by Cornelis van Dalem. He died in Amsterdam, where he was buried on 16 November 1661 NS. An inventory of his effects was drawn up in January 1662.

Luttrell, Edward (fl. 1680-1724), crayon portrait painter and engraver, may have been born in Ireland, possibly in Luttrellstown or Dublin. No details of his birth and parentage have been traced, but evidence from Edward Luttrell himself links him to the Luttrell family of Saunton Court, north Devon (see Noon). In 1683 the artist dedicated his manuscript treatise 'An epitome of painting' to his 'much Honored... Kinswoman Maddam Dorothy Luttrell'; a member of the Saunton Court family, she was the aunt of the diarist Narcissus Luttrell (1657-1732), of whom Edward Luttrell was thus a kinsman (and, probably, a near contemporary). 
Luttrell began, possibly about 1670, as a law student at New Inn, London, meanwhile 'drawing by practice for his Pleasure', with 'no instructor or regular teaching from a Master' (Vertue, 'Note books', 1.42). 'Drawing by practice' presumably prompted Luttrell's crayon adaptations (BM) of etchings by Rembrandt and after other masters. He then gave up law study and became a pupil of the crayon and pastel portrait painter Edmund Ashfield. 
Luttrell had the urge to experiment: in Vertue's phrase, he had 'a mechanical head'. Buckeridge credits him with 'multiplying' the range of crayon colours used by Ashfield; more innovatively, Luttrell 'found out a method, unknown before, to draw with those chalks or crayons, on copper-plates' (Buckeridge, 355). This method, indirectly derived (according to Vertue's sardonic account) through Luttrell's printseller friend Floyd from an assistant to the Dutch engraver Abraham Blootling (1640-1690), consisted of roughening a copperplate with a rocker (or engraving tool), giving its surface a 'tooth' to retain chalks or crayons whose powdery substance had previously demanded fixatives (prone to discolour). 
Luttrell's manuscript manual 'An epitome of painting, containing breife directions for drawing painting limning and cryoons, wth the choicest receipts for preparing the colours for limning and cryoons, likewise directions for painting on glass, as tis now in use amongst all persons of quality: and lastly, how to lay the ground, and work in mezzo tinto, all by Edward Luttrell, 1683' (34 numbered pages; Yale U. CBA) was compiled for and dedicated to his 'Kinswoman' Dorothy Luttrell. Experimentally, Luttrell sometimes added watercolour or gouache to his own crayon portraits. 
Luttrell's work in crayon or pastel is uneven in quality. His finest works include a tender portrait of a woman (unidentified, but evidently known to Luttrell) in olive-green headdress and low decolletage, signed in monogram (BM), and a portrait of an unknown man, possibly an artist (Huntington Art Gallery, San Marino, California). Luttrell's flesh tones range from cream, rose, and ginger to light red. His best-known sitter was Samuel Butler, the author of 'Hudibras' (three versions: on oak panel, 'c'.1680, NPG; Bodl. Oxf.; and Yale U. CBA). Luttrell's portraits are almost all of single sitters, bust length; but in 1694 John Evelyn recorded admiration for a group portrait of his cousin George Evelyn's ten children, 'all painted... in one piece very well by Mr. Lutterell in Crayons upon copper and seeming to be as finely painted as the best Miniature' (Evelyn, 'Diary', 5.187). At the other extreme, Vertue mentions 'one head as big as life' (Vertue, 'Note books', 3.12), but this has not been traced. Luttrell's facility for working quickly -- 'very quick', according to Vertue (ibid., 1.43) -- produced some scratchy works, perhaps survivals of the 'many heads' drawn for the engraver Isaac Becket 'to finish & polish them up' (ibid.). 
Mezzotint portraits solely by and after Luttrell (few dated) include only two of clerics (Bishop Gilbert Burnet and Francis Higgins, the allegedly seditious archdeacon of Cashel), although such commissions usually provided a steady livelihood for engravers. Less well-known sitters -- among them the naval physician Robert Cony, Mrs Marie Helyot (died 1682), and the amateur draughtsman Francis Le Piper (probably Luttrell's friend as well as his associate in work for Becket) -- suggest that Luttrell could afford to select subjects for their appeal to him. Vertue records that 'Mr. Luttrell thinks his Best head of his doing is Mr. Le Piper' (Vertue, 'Note books', 1.43). Luttrell engraved two portraits ('Lord Shaftesbury' and 'Lord William Russell') after Kneller, and drew various (mostly imaginary) royal portraits for John Vanderbank to engrave for Bishop White Kennett's 'Compleat History of England' (1706). 
Luttrell appears to have lived and worked chiefly in Westminster, London. In 1711 he is listed as one of the twelve directors of Kneller's academy in Great Queen Street. The date of his death is not known, but presumably was after 1723, the year in which Vertue lists him among 'Living painters of Note in London' (Vertue, 'Note books', 3.12).

Luttrell, Henry (1653/4-1717), army officer, was a son of Thomas Luttrell (died 1673) of Luttrellstown, co. Dublin, and of Barbara Sedgrave, and a younger brother of Simon Luttrell (c.1643-1698). As a young man he served in the French army, but after the accession of James II in 1685 he was commissioned as a captain in Princess Anne of Denmark's regiment of foot. In 1686 he was given command of the 4th troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, whom he led in a skirmish with Prince William's troops at Wincanton on 20 November 1688. At the revolution he went back to France, from where he sailed with the fleet that brought King James to Ireland on 12 March 1689. He represented Carlow in the Dublin parliament of May 1689 and was given a regiment of cavalry. In July 1689 he took part in the duke of Berwick's raid on Enniskillen and distinguished himself by chasing the Williamite horse back into the town. In October that year he played an important part in Patrick Sarsfield's capture of Sligo by scattering a larger force of Williamite cavalry at Ballysadare. Luttrell was made governor of the town, which he then fortified. 
After the battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690) the Jacobite government moved to Limerick, and Luttrell, then a brigadier, 'was perpetually speaking ill of Tyrconnell', the Jacobite lord lieutenant, 'and inflaming everybody against him' in favour of 'his intimate friend' Sarsfield (Fitzjames, 80). Berwick acknowledged Luttrell to have 'a great share of sense, a great share of address, a great share of courage, and was a good officer; capable of anything to accomplish his ends' (ibid., 97) but referred to him as 'a most dangerous incendiary' (ibid., 82). 
In September 1690 Tyrconnell sailed to France. In his absence Luttrell, Sarsfield, and the other 'caballing gentlemen' (Gilbert, 111) forced Berwick to send a delegation to France to urge King James to replace Tyrconnell as viceroy. The two Luttrell brothers were chosen as delegates, as was Brigadier Thomas Maxwell, who had instructions from Berwick to tell James not to allow Luttrell back to Ireland. He correctly guessed Maxwell's mission and had to be restrained by his brother and the bishop of Cork from throwing him over the side of the ship. At St Germain James received both Maxwell and a desperate letter from Tyrconnell stating that he would be able to control Sarsfield so long as Luttrell was kept away, but by the time Luttrell's delegation was permitted to address James, Tyrconnell had left the country for France. Luttrell returned to Ireland after convincing James that if he were detained the Irish would take their revenge on Berwick. On 19 May 1691 he arrived in Limerick with the new French commander, St Ruth, and resumed his campaign against Tyrconnell, now also returned to Ireland. 
At the battle of Aughrim Luttrell commanded the brigade of dragoons that formed the first line on the left wing. The battle ended in disaster for the Irish army, the remnants of which made for Limerick. The failure of his troops, and those of his immediate superior, Dominic Sheldon, to halt the Williamite advance was crucial to the latter's victory, and he was subsequently accused of cowardice or of treachery. But there was no immediate clamour against him, and he was dispatched with a cavalry force to disrupt Ginckel's siege of Galway, though held off at Kilcolgan Bridge. When Galway surrendered, he provided the escort that brought the garrison back to Limerick. During the handover the commander of the Williamite escort party asked Luttrell whether the Irish were ready to treat. He replied that 'such a thing might well be if General Ginckel had a sufficient power' (Gilbert, 149) to grant terms. A few days later a messenger from the English camp was caught bringing a letter to Luttrell to let him know that Ginckel did have that authority. He was arrested by Sarsfield and on Tyrconnell's orders was tried by court martial for corresponding with the enemy. His defence was that he had merely spoken to the letter's author during a ceasefire. The tribunal acquitted him by nineteen votes to five. Lord Westmeath, who watched the tribunal, wrote that 'it was impossible that he could be found guilty by men that had either honesty or honour' (Harris, appx 75). Nevertheless, Tyrconnell, who had cast his vote against him, kept him locked up in Limerick Castle, where he remained until after the treaty. 
There is no other evidence or contemporary suggestion that Luttrell was a traitor to the Jacobite cause up until the treaty of Limerick (3 October 1691), but the resentment generated by his harsh treatment by his comrades drove him firmly into the arms of the Williamites. Under the terms of the treaty the Irish troops were given the choice of going to France to serve King James, of joining King William's army, or of laying down their arms. Luttrell harangued his men and, as he later claimed, 'not only did bring to his Majestie's service the Regiment of Horse he formerly had commanded, but by himself and his friends did perswade many of the Irish to do the like and prevented 8,000 of them from goeing into France to serve against his Majestie. (McNeill, 80)' He was awarded $500 per annum and succeeded to the family estates at Luttrellstown, his brother having been outlawed. 
Luttrell travelled to the continent for each of King William's campaigns for the rest of the Nine Years' War, but, although he was chosen to command a proposed Irish brigade which was to serve in the Venetian service against the Turks, he was never given another post. In 1699 his brother's widow sued him for her jointure on Luttrellstown. He initially defended the action by having her arrested for returning from France without a licence. The case was finally decided against him in 1709. 
Luttrell married, in 1704, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Jones of Halkyn in Flint; they had two sons. He was shot dead in his sedan chair near his Dublin house on 3 November 1717 and was buried at Luttrellstown. It was at first feared that he had been assassinated in revenge for his actions in 1691, and a $1000 reward was offered to secure the murderer. It was later generally believed that the motive behind his killing had more to do with his adultery than his politics. 
Luttrell's second son, Simon Luttrell (1713-1787), was in 1768 raised to the peerage as Baron Irnham, and later as viscount (1781) and earl (1785) of Carhampton. He was the father of General Henry Lawes Luttrell, second earl of Carhampton (1737-1821); of John Luttrell-Olmius, third earl (d. 1829) ['see under 'Luttrell, James]; of James Luttrell (c.1751-1788); and of Temple Simon Luttrell (1738?-1803) ['see under 'Luttrell, Henry Lawes].

Luttrell, Henry (1768-1851), wit and poet, an illegitimate son of Henry Lawes Luttrell, second earl of Carhampton (1737-1821), was born on 14 May 1768 and baptized at St Martin in the Fields on 7 June 1768. His mother, Mary, was later known as Mary Otto Baijer Nugent; under the surname King he attended Charterhouse School between 1778 and 1783, before proceeding to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1790 and LLB in 1791, in which year he was called to the Irish bar. He took the name Luttrell, and through his father's influence he obtained a seat for Clonmines, co. Wexford, in the last Irish parliament (1798), and a post in the Irish government, which he subsequently commuted for a pension. He was sent to the West Indies about 1802 to manage his father's estates there, but soon returned, and obtained an introduction to London society through the duchess of Devonshire. Although always financially insecure, he was socially successful and was looked upon as one of the most agreeable, accomplished, and entertaining men of his day. 
In 1819 Luttrell published some graceful, if rather colourless, elegiacs entitled 'Lines Written at Ampthill Park in the Autumn of 1818', and dedicated to Henry, Lord Holland. On an altogether different plane was 'Advice to Julia, a Letter in Rhyme', published early in 1820. Influenced by Horace, the poem was a 'society epic', offering vignettes of London life. Tom Moore, who was to some extent its literary sponsor, described the volume as 'full of well-bred facetiousness and sparkle'; it was greatly improved in the third edition of 1822 (when the title was slightly altered to 'Letters to Julia, in Rhyme'), and 'is now', said Christopher North, writing in the following year, 'quite, quite a bijou'. Luttrell's only other printed volume was his 'Crockford House' (1827), a satire on gambling which did not enhance his reputation. 
Luttrell travelled much in Europe, and kept a diary, but his real greatness was as a talker and diner-out. Moore took counsel with him before destroying the manuscript memoirs which Byron had entrusted to his discretion. He was 'always bracketed with Rogers', compared with whom he is described as 'less caustic, but more good-natured', and the two were 'seldom apart, and always hating, abusing, and ridiculing each other'. No one, according to Rogers, 'could slide in a brilliant thing with greater readiness'. He was a frequent guest at Holland House, where many of his best 'mots' were uttered ['see also 'Holland House set]. Despite his great reputation as a wit, and his contemporaries' taste for recording his epigrams, they did not withstand translation into written form. He appears in many volumes of recollections of the period. He did not lack a serious side: Greville described him as 'a philosopher in all things, but especially in religion'. 
Luttrell survived most of his contemporaries, and was described by Raikes in 1843 as visiting Paris 'pour chasser l'ennui, though without effect' ('Portion of the Journal', 4.269). In 1850 he married Ann Springer, daughter of John Cutler of Clapton. It is possible that he had been married previously. He died at his house, 31 Brompton Square, London, on 19 December 1851.

Luttrell, Henry Lawes, second earl of Carhampton (1737-1821), army officer and politician, was born at Cranford, Middlesex, on 7 August 1737, the eldest son of Simon Luttrell, first earl of Carhampton (1713-1787), landowner and politician, of Castlehaven, co. Cork, and Judith Maria (died 1798), daughter of Sir Nicholas Lawes and Elizabeth Cotton. Educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, Luttrell began his military career in 1757 as ensign in the 48th foot, rising in 1759 to lieutenant in the 34th foot and captain of the 16th light dragoons. In April 1762 he became a major and was made deputy adjutant-general of the British forces in Portugal; he received the local rank of lieutenant-colonel in October 1762 and in February 1765 was made lieutenant-colonel of the 1st regiment of horse. 
In 1768 Luttrell entered politics as member for the Cornish borough of Bossiney. Thereafter Luttrell embarked on something of a personal crusade against John Wilkes, whom he attacked in his maiden speech. In 1769, after Wilkes's election for Middlesex had been declared void for the third time, Luttrell offered to stand if the government would ensure his return on petition. Although heavily defeated in the election on 13 April 1769 by 1143 votes to 296, the House of Commons carried a motion by 197 to 143 declaring Luttrell elected, which sparked popular outrage. Horace Walpole reported that Luttrell was hissed out of the theatre, assaulted as he left the house, and for several months 'did not dare appear in the streets or scarce quit his lodgings' (Walpole, 3.359). Luttrell was frequently attacked in print, particularly by the political satirist Junius who, representing the views of anti-court whigs, disparaged his election as an 'arbitrary appointment [which] invades the foundation of the laws themselves' ('Letters of Junius', 83, letter 15, to the duke of Grafton, 8 July 1769). Luttrell's personal unpopularity was compounded by his family's scandalous reputation. Junius compared his 'unnatural union' with Middlesex to the clandestine marriage of Luttrell's sister, Anne Horton, to the duke of Cumberland (ibid., 316, letter 68, to Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, 21 Jan 1772). Nevertheless, as reward for opposing Wilkes, Luttrell sought and received the position of adjutant-general in Ireland. In 1774 he resumed his former seat for Bossiney which he held until 1784. On 25 June 1776 he married Jane (died 1831), daughter of George Boyd and Anne Hamilton of Dublin. He received a marriage settlement of $20,000. 
Luttrell's military career meanwhile had advanced apace: he became colonel (brevet) in August 1777 and major-general in November 1782. As adjutant-general in Ireland he displayed the same thrusting ambition and contempt for public opinion that he had in England. In 1779 he proposed a highly unpopular and unsuccessful scheme to bring the Irish Volunteers under government control. He was also active in Irish politics and sat for the borough of Old Leighlin from 1783 to 1787. During 1786 he was tasked with subduing agrarian Rightboy protesters in Munster, and went on a whirlwind tour with a special commission and 2000 soldiers. He attempted pacification both by a show of military force and by the negotiation of mutually acceptable levels of clerical tithe. The mission failed amid recriminations. His proposals for lower tithes were construed as sanctioning protests and the clergy complained that his failure to follow up his threats provoked a renewal of the disturbances. Nevertheless, he became colonel of the 6th dragoons in 1788, and in 1789 lieutenant-general of the ordnance in Ireland. 
On the death of his father in January 1787 Luttrell, who had earlier quarrelled acrimoniously with his father over the settlement of Luttrellstown, co. Dublin, succeeded to the family titles and estates. In 1790 he re-entered the Westminster parliament for Plympton Erle and held that seat until 1794; thereafter the dangers of Irish insurrection and possible invasion occupied his attention. In March 1795 he advocated that armed loyalist associations should hold Dublin if its garrison moved against an invader. In May that year he was given unlimited authority to tackle the Defenders in Connaught. Here he encouraged magistrates to arrest men on suspicion, many of whom (estimates vary between 1300 and 200) were sent to serve on the fleet. Although brutally effective, his impetuous methods alarmed the viceroy, Lord Camden, who vetoed his plans for armed anti-Defender loyalist associations in October 1795. Camden later admitted that Carhampton had exceeded the laws in Connaught, and an indemnity act was passed early in 1796. When establishment of an Irish yeomanry was being canvassed in the summer of 1796, Carhampton toured various parts of Ireland to enlist support but, typically, portrayed the dangers in such lurid terms that he caused agricultural prices to plummet and actually encouraged disaffection. In October 1796 he became Irish commander-in-chief by default, the first choice to succeed General Cunninghame, Sir Charles Grey, having declined on health grounds. Carhampton zealously set about improving Ireland's defences but was overtaken by events when a French invasion fleet appeared at Bantry Bay in late December 1796. His handling of this crisis was subjected to heavy criticism, particularly the decision to abandon Cork. Afterwards Edward Cooke summed him up as 'quick, but flighty', and noted that: 'It is unfortunate but true that Lord Carhampton has different ideas about the defence of Ireland from every officer in the whole army' (PRONI, Sneyd MSS, T3229/2/22, Cooke to Auckland, 9 Feb 1797; BL, Add. MS 33103, fol. 130, Cooke to Pelham, 3 Feb 1797). The northern commander, General Knox, criticized Carhampton for refusing to believe that republicans had infiltrated the militia. Knox also deplored Carhampton's impetuous behaviour, highlighting an undignified fracas in a Newry public house in April 1797 when he tore a green handkerchief from a United Irishman's neck. His reputation made him a target for the disaffected and there was a plot to assassinate him in May 1797, for which two men were executed, one the blacksmith on his own Luttrellstown estate. By now Camden was considering replacing him, telling the home secretary: 'with all the merit he possesses, there is certainly a degree of indiscretion in his character, that makes him unfit for the chief command of the army' (TNA: PRO, Home Office 100/68, fols. 233-4, Camden to Portland, 28 April 1797). As a suitably experienced successor was again unavailable, Carhampton remained in command until November 1797 when he was replaced by Sir Ralph Abercromby; he was compensated with the master-generalship of the ordnance and was made a full general in January 1798. 
Carhampton had opposed the union of Britain and Ireland when it was first mooted but by June 1799 Cornwallis reported that: 'he has sold Luttrellstown, and means to vote for the Union which he so loudly and indecently reprobated' ('Correspondence of... Cornwallis', 3.112). He later had second thoughts about the sale of Luttrellstown and tried unsuccessfully to renege on the agreement with the purchaser, the wealthy Dublin bookseller Luke White (T. Kemmis to Carhampton, 11 May 1802, PRONI, T 3404/37). Having purchased an estate at Painshill, near Cobham, Surrey, Carhampton re-entered parliament in June 1817 as MP for Ludgershall and held the seat until his death. He died at his home in Bruton Street, London, on 25 April 1821, survived by his wife and his only known child, a natural son, Henry Luttrell (1768-1851). The title passed to his brother John Luttrell-Olmius (d. 1829) ['see under 'Luttrell, James]; his two other brothers, James Luttrell (c.1751-1788) and

Luttrell, James (c.1751-1788), naval officer and politician, was born at Four Oaks, Warwickshire, the fourth and youngest son of Simon Luttrell, first earl of Carhampton (1713-1787), of Castlehaven, co. Cork, and his wife, Judith Maria, 'nee' Lawes (died 1798). His elder brothers were Henry Lawes Luttrell, later second earl of Carhampton, Temple Simon Luttrell ['see under 'Luttrell, Henry Lawes], and John, later third earl ['see below']. James entered the Royal Navy in the mid-1760s and was promoted lieutenant on 2 February 1770. 
In December 1775 Luttrell was elected MP for Stockbridge in Hampshire. Prior to this he had spent time in America. In parliament he attacked the North administration's policy towards the War of Independence, describing the British campaign as 'unjust, rash and savage' (Brooke, HoP, 'Commons, 1754-90', 3.66). With his brothers John and Temple Simon, he also spoke out against the naval policy of the earl of Sandwich. Luttrell remained an active critic of the North government until 1780 when he was encouraged to modify his views with the offer of a command at sea as part of negotiations between Luttrell and the court's spokesman, Lord Irnham. In late July 1780 he was promoted first lieutenant of the 'Belliqueux' and became captain on 23 February 1781. In the following year he took command of the 'Mediator' in which, in December, he achieved some celebrity for his actions against the French navy. On 12 December the 'Mediator' was patrolling off Ferrol when an American ship and four French vessels attempted to break out. Luttrell was able to break through the allied line and one French ship, the 'Alexandre', surrendered. Luttrell chased and captured another, the 'Menagerie', later that day. Next morning, the 'Mediator' spotted two more of the vessels. However, in view of the fact that Luttrell's ship already carried 300 prisoners and a crew of only 190 he decided not to pursue them. This may have been as well, since during the night the French officers attempted to seize the British ship. Luttrell brought his prizes back to Britain: the action was commemorated by several paintings and led the king to write that Luttrell's 'skill as well as bravery... deserve much approbation' (ibid.). 
In 1783 Luttrell was appointed to command the ship of the line 'Ganges' but his naval career was nearing its end. He stayed with this ship for only six months before resigning, probably on the grounds of ill health, to become surveyor-general of the ordnance in March 1784. In April he was elected MP for Dover. He remained at the ordnance until his death, unmarried, from tuberculosis on 23 December 1788. 
Luttrell's brother, 
John Luttrell's next naval appointment was as captain of the 'Charon' in which he sailed for the West Indies in March 1779. In October he led a squadron and captured the Spanish stronghold of St Fernando del Omoa, and seized bullion worth some $3 million. In 1780 he was returned as MP for Stockbridge after which, in line with his brother, he shifted his position in favour of the court and against the American War of Independence. He was disqualified from holding the seat when, in 1784, he became a commissioner for managing excise. Luttrell took the additional name of Olmius after his wife became heir to Lord Waltham's estate in April 1787. Following her death he married (on 16 July 1798) Maria Anne (1776/7-1857), daughter of John Morgan; the couple had one daughter. Luttrell-Olmius became third earl of Carhampton on the death of his brother Henry in 1821. He himself died on 17 March 1829 at Devonshire Place, Middlesex, whereupon the title became extinct.

John Luttrell-Olmius, third earl of Carhampton (c.1740-1829), naval officer and politician, was the first earl's third son. He entered the navy in the mid-1750s, being promoted lieutenant in October 1758. In 1762 he became captain of the 'Mars' and of the 'Achilles', the Portsmouth guardship, three years later. On 13 June 1765 he married Elizabeth (died 1797), daughter of John Olmius, first Baron Waltham; they had three children, two of whom died in infancy. In 1774 he was elected MP for Stockbridge but vacated the seat in the following December for his brother James. With James and Temple Simon, John attacked the policies of Lord Sandwich whom he accused of selling naval offices, a charge refuted during a celebrated trial in 1773.

Luttrell, Narcissus (1657-1732), annalist and book collector, was born on 12 August 1657 in Holborn, London, the third but eldest surviving son of Francis Luttrell (1613-1677) of Gray's Inn (a cadet of the Luttrells of Staunton Court, Devon) and Catherine Mapowder (died 1685), daughter and coheir of Narcissus Mapowder of Holsworthy, Devon. 
Luttrell was educated at Sheen School and entered a fellow commoner of St John's, Cambridge, in February 1674. He received an MA by royal mandate in 1675, but even before his matriculation at Cambridge he was admitted in August 1673 to his father's inn. Luttrell succeeded his father in April 1677. He was called to the bar in 1680, and though he appears to have abandoned practice early in life, he was subsequently elected as bencher in 1702 and ancient in 1706. 
Luttrell did, however, put his legal training to use, serving actively as a Middlesex JP for three decades from 1693. On various occasions he also served as a deputy lieutenant, a commissioner of oyer and terminer, and a commissioner of land-tax assessment. He was also twice elected to the House of Commons, sitting for Bossiney (Cornwall) in the second Exclusion Parliament (1679-80) and then in the parliament of 1690-95 for Saltash (Cornwall) upon being returned at a by-election in October 1691. 
Luttrell does not appear to have been a frequent speaker in the Commons, and what is known or may be surmised of his political views is not altogether consistent. On the one hand, his obituarist in the 'London Evening Journal' (6-8 July 1732) characterized him as an exclusionist and a staunch whig, while suggesting that it was Sir Robert Walpole who was responsible for his ouster from the Middlesex commission of the peace in 1723. On the other hand, Luttrell was on good enough terms with Robert Harley, a fellow MP in the 1690-95 parliament and also an avid collector, to solicit (unsuccessfully) a place for his son, Francis ('bred a scholar' and called to the bar), from him as head of the Treasury in 1712, invoking the names of such staunch tories as Francis Gwyn and Sir William Drake as 'compurgators' for the rightness of his son's political views (Luttrell to earl of Oxford, 23 Jan 1712, BL, Add. MS 70247; Luttrell to earl of Oxford, 12 Aug 1712, 'Portland MSS', 5.210). It may also be significant that his tenure as a Middlesex deputy lieutenant began under the Harley ministry and that it was not renewed by George I's first ministry. Suffice it, then, to say that his scholarly and collecting activities brought him into contact with a political cross-section that also included Jacob Tonson and Thomas Hearne. 
Luttrell's chief contributions were as annalist and collector. Since Macaulay drew attention to them, his chronicles (compiled from newsletters and newspapers) of contemporary events, 'A Brief Historical Relation of State Affairs from September 1678 to April 1714' (1857), have been frequently cited by students of the period. Even more valuable, as a firsthand account, is the parliamentary diary he kept assiduously during his second term of service in the Commons; the diary is preserved -- as are the materials for the 'Historical Relation' -- in the Codrington Library of All Souls College, Oxford. Although the diary (published in 1972 by Clarendon Press) is almost wholly devoid of personal references, it provides a very full account of the debates of the 1691-2 and 1692-3 sessions. Given Luttrell's habits and the survival of much other parliamentary material among his manuscripts in the Codrington Library, it seems quite likely that he kept a similar diary for the final two sessions of that parliament, but its whereabouts, if extant, are unknown. In addition, there survives a brief diary of his service as a deputy lieutenant during 1713-14 (LMA, ACC 619). There is also his private diary for 1722-5 in the British Library; written in Greek characters, its contents have been extracted by P. Dixon in 'Notes and Queries' (207, 1962, 388ff.). 
In addition to his public service, Luttrell accumulated a valuable collection of contemporary publications, including both political (some listed in his Popish Plot catalogues) and poetical works. After more than three decades of acquisitions (beginning in his student days), he calculated in 1706 that he had laid out over $1500 on such purchases; unfortunately, his wish that his library pass intact to some 'public' institution such as Gray's Inn was not wholly heeded by his descendants. So while a substantial number of the printed works from his library were eventually acquired by the British Library, many (often bearing his colophon) have found resting places elsewhere; dated items are listed in 'The Luttrell File', compiled by Stephen Parks with Earle Havens (1999). Meanwhile, a large number of his manuscripts found their way by the gift of Luttrell Wynne (grandson of his sister Dorothy Wynne, and a fellow of All Souls College) to the Codrington Library in 1786. More recently, Professor James Osborn donated many items he acquired (at Sotheby sales in 1936 and 1957) in the course of his researches on Luttrell to the Beinecke Library of Yale University. Still others are dispersed and some are not now traceable. 
Luttrell made many of his purchases while residing at a house in Holborn (opposite the Three Cups tavern) that he inherited from his mother in 1685. He also inherited other realty worth over $200 p.a., including property at Tregony and Launceston, Cornwall, from his parents (Luttrell MS C65). He married in February 1682 Sarah, daughter of Daniel Baker (a prosperous London merchant), and their only child, a son, Francis, was born that December. 
From 1710 onwards, Luttrell resided in a newly purchased residence (acquired from the third earl of Shaftesbury for $1200) in Chelsea. After Sarah's death in July 1722, he married in May 1725 Mary, daughter of John Bearsley of Wolverhampton. A son was born to them in 1727 but did not survive. Luttrell died at Little Chelsea, after a long illness, on 27 June 1732, leaving his widow, Mary (died 1745), and his only surviving child, Francis, by his first wife. He was buried at Chelsea. At Francis's death in 1749 the Luttrell library passed to his Wynne kin, eventually to be dispersed by sale and gift.

Luttrell, Simon (c.1643-1698), army officer, was the eldest son of Thomas Luttrell (died 1673) of Luttrellstown, co. Dublin, and his wife, Barbara Sedgrave, a daughter of Henry Sedgrave of Cabra, co. Dublin. Henry Luttrell (1653/4-1717), also subsequently a Jacobite officer, was his brother. He married in 1672 Katherine Newcomen (died 1704), a daughter of Sir Thomas Newcomen, bt, of co. Dublin, and of Frances, a sister of Richard Talbot, earl of Tyrconnell. The marriage was consecrated twice, firstly by a Church of Ireland divine because his wife was a protestant, and secondly by one of his wife's Catholic uncles, Peter Talbot, the archbishop of Dublin, who refused to recognize the first ceremony. In 1673 Luttrell succeeded to an estate of over 4000 acres in the counties of Dublin, Kildare, and Meath. 
Luttrell's religion excluded him from any military position until the accession of James II in 1685, when he was granted a captain's commission in Richard Hamilton's regiment of dragoons. When Tyrconnell became the lord deputy of Ireland in January 1687, Luttrell was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy of his father-in-law's regiment and made a privy councillor of Ireland. Trapped in England at the time of the revolution, he wrote on Christmas eve 1688 a pathetic letter to the duke of Ormond begging for a pass to leave the country: 'I have been sick these two years. I am now paralytic... If God gives me my health, and if your Grace promises me leave, I will go and serve the Emperor' (Ball, 'Manuscripts', 11). He was allowed to go to France, and within three months he sailed with the exiled King James to Ireland, where he was made a colonel of dragoons. 
In May 1689 Luttrell sat as a member for the county of Dublin in the Irish parliament, and in September was appointed the governor of the city. He was responsible for Dublin's security at a time when raids by English men-of-war, armed risings by the protestants, and shortages of essentials were feared and expected. He 'chained up the streets and made breastworks at the entrance into each, to secure that naked place' ('CSP dom.', '1686-7', 279). He gave orders prohibiting protestants from carrying arms, assembling in groups of more than five, or going out at night, and issued a proclamation that those who traded in goods at inflated prices 'should be punished with death and hanged at their own doors' (Ball, 'Manuscripts', 382). 
Luttrell left Dublin shortly before the arrival of King William's victorious troops after the battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690) and travelled to Limerick. In November 1690 he was part of the delegation sent to France to get King James to remove Tyrconnell as lord lieutenant. The duke of Berwick, who described him as being 'of an obliging disposition' and 'a man of honour' (Berwick, 82), included him in the mission as a moderating influence on his brother (whom Simon had to restrain from throwing Brigadier Maxwell over the side before their ship had left Galway). The mission to France was unsuccessful in that Tyrconnell was not replaced, but Luttrell stayed on in France to urge the French to send more supplies to Ireland. 
Despite Luttrell's efforts, the supply fleet he sailed with only reached Ireland on 20 October 1691, almost three weeks after the treaty of Limerick had been signed. Under its terms he was entitled to recover his estates if he submitted to the new government. He instead returned to France and was outlawed in Ireland for high treason. His estate was confiscated and given to his brother Henry. He remained with the exiled Jacobites as colonel of the Queen's regiment in the Irish brigade, with whom he served in Italy and Spain. He was promoted to brigadier in the French army in January 1696, and died in France on 6 September 1698 aged about fifty-five. He was buried in Crest in southern France. He left no children. His wife erected a memorial to his memory in the chapel of the Irish College in Paris before returning to Ireland, where she sued Henry Luttrell for her jointure on the estate. She died in 1704. Her case was taken to the House of Lords by her second husband, Thomas Amory, who emerged triumphant in 1709.

Temple Simon Luttrell (1738?-1803), politician, had predeceased him. Temple Simon Luttrell, probably born on 8 September 1738, had been educated with Henry at Westminster and on 26 April 1778 married Elizabeth Gould (died 1803), daughter of Sir Henry Gould (1710-1794), judge. He sat as MP for Milborne Port from 1774 to 1780, and gained some notoriety during the war against America for his attacks on the Admiralty and for campaigning against the press gang. The violence of his speeches against Lord North, however, lost him his seat. He was arrested at Boulogne on 18 September 1793 and when his captors realized that his sister, Anne, had been married to the duke of Cumberland, they triumphantly announced him to be the king of England's brother. He was released on 14 February 1795 and died in Paris on 14 January 1803, leaving no children; his widow died in Kensington three months later on 21 May.

Lutwyche, Sir Edward (1634-1709), judge and politician, was born on 6 September 1634, the only son of William Lutwyche ('b'. 'c'.1601) of Lutwyche Hall, Shropshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Lister of Rowton Castle, Shropshire. In 1644 he entered Shrewsbury School, and he was admitted to Gray's Inn on 12 May 1652 and to Lincoln's Inn on 26 May 1652. He evidently chose Gray's Inn, being called to the bar there on 1 June 1660. By this date he had married Anne (died 1722), daughter of Sir Timothy Tourneur of Bold, Shropshire. They had two sons and seven daughters. In January 1684 Lutwyche was made a serjeant-at-law; he was made a king's serjeant on 4 November 1684 and knighted ten days later. Under Chester's new charter of 1684, Lutwyche was named recorder. Following the accession of James II he was made chief justice of Chester in October 1685, and returned to the House of Commons in a by-election for Ludlow on 14 November 1685. He resigned from both positions when elevated to the bench as a justice of common pleas on 21 April 1686. In his new position Lutwyche upheld the dispensing power, although not in ecclesiastical cases, and thus retained his seat on the bench until the revolution of 1688. 
Lutwyche's stance on the dispensing power ensured that he was exempted from the 'Act of Indemnity' of 1690. He returned to private practice and was fined 40's'. for refusing the oaths at York assizes in April 1693. He was still practising in 1704. Lutwyche's death was reported by Luttrell on 11 June 1709 and he was buried in St Bride's, Fleet Street. The main beneficiary of his will was his son Thomas Lutwyche, an important tory lawyer, who received his father's books, chambers, and 'the manuscripts by me prepared as an abridgement of the Common Law', which was to 'be printed and published at and by the care and inspection and collation of my son Thomas'. This was the work published in 1718 in both folio and octavo editions.

Lutwyche, Thomas (bap. 1674, d. 1734), lawyer, was baptized on 21 September 1674, the first surviving son of Sir Edward Lutwyche (1634-1709), justice of the common pleas, and his wife, Anne (died 1722), daughter of Sir Timothy Tourneur. Lutwyche was a king's scholar at Westminster School, and was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 4 July 1692, but took no degree. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1697, was reader there in 1715, and treasurer of the inn in 1722. Lutwyche was made QC towards the end of Queen Anne's reign, and was an able lawyer. He was married to Elizabeth, daughter of William Bagnall of Bretforton, Worcestershire; they had two sons and three daughters. 
A member of the October Club, Lutwyche was returned as MP for Appleby by Lord Thanet in 1710, and held the seat until 1722. He was MP for Callington, Cornwall, between 1722 and 1727, and for Agmondesham, Buckinghamshire, from 1728 to his death. A high tory, Lutwyche delivered, on 6 November 1723, a strong speech in parliament against the bill for laying a tax upon papists. In 1725 he was one of the organizers of the trial of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield; and he was said to have refused the post of attorney-general in succession to Sir Robert Raymond. 
Lutwyche died on 13 November 1734 and was buried at the Inner Temple Church. Among his papers were some manuscript reports of 'select cases, arguments and pleadings' in the queen's bench in the reign of Queen Anne. These were first published in 1781 as a supplement to the authoritative 'Modern Reports' of cases since the accession of Charles II.

Luxford, George (1807-1854), botanist and printer, was born on 7 April 1807 at Sutton in Surrey, from where the family subsequently moved to nearby Reigate. At the age of eleven he was apprenticed to a printer and in the sixteen years he remained with him made up for his truncated schooling by extensive reading and acquiring a knowledge of French, Latin, and Greek. He also developed a fondness for field botany and entomology, and spent his leisure hours in combing the district in search of plants. 'A Flora of the Neighbourhood of Reigate' (1838), which he printed himself, was the eventual product of that. 
After three years in Birmingham (1834-7), Luxford returned south and set up on his own as a printer in London. Within a few months Longmans had switched to him the contract for printing Loudon's 'Magazine of Natural History', perhaps at the instance of his fellow Surrey naturalist, Edward Newman (1801-1876), who was at that point one of its chief contributors. Newman had become convinced that separate magazines catering for the respective subcommunities of natural history were a commercial proposition and was then looking for a vehicle through which to prove that belief. Luxford's business seemed ideal, and, after first being taken on as a partner, Newman was allowed to buy it outright in 1841. That June a botanical monthly, 'The Phytologist', made its appearance from this stable, with Luxford named as editor. That this was no mere trade convenience was quickly shown by the frequent learned contributions made by the editor to the earlier numbers. Luxford's appointment in 1846 as lecturer in botany at St Thomas's Hospital and his election in 1848 to the council of the Botanical Society of London (of which 'The Phytologist' had effectively become the publishing outlet) came as added credentials. 
Luxford remained editor of 'The Phytologist' until 1851, but, even after his retirement from business, continued to act as compositor and reader. 'The Phytologist' was, however, never a financial success and was kept in print for as long as thirteen years only by cross-subsidies from Newman's more profitable ventures. On Luxford's death, on 12 June 1854 at 10 Victoria Place, Hill Street, Walworth, publication of the journal ceased; this seems to confirm the supposition that Newman had kept it going only out of loyalty to his former partner, although letters provide evidence that Newman subsequently sought in vain to recruit other leading botanists to take Luxford's place. Luxford had proved himself irreplaceable.

Charles Scott Luxmoore (1792?-1854), attended Eton College and distinguished himself as a classical scholar while at St John's College, Cambridge, where he completed his degrees with great reputation.

Luxmoore, John (1756-1830), bishop of St Asaph, was born at Okehampton, Devon, the son of John Luxmoore and his wife, Mary Cunningham. He was educated at Ottery St Mary School and at Eton College, whence he passed as a scholar in 1776 to King's College, Cambridge; he graduated BA in 1780, and proceeded MA in 1783. On 30 June 1795 he was created DD at Lambeth by Archbishop Moore. He became fellow of his college, having been tutor to the earl of Dalkeith (later the duke of Buccleuch). Backed by the duke's influence, he obtained a series of preferments: he became rector of St George the Martyr, Queen Square, London, in 1782, prebendary of Canterbury in 1793, dean of Gloucester in 1799, and rector of Taynton, Gloucestershire, in 1800. In 1806 he exchanged St George the Martyr for St Andrew's, Holborn. In 1807 he became bishop of Bristol and in 1808 he was translated to Hereford, and in 1815 to St Asaph. In 1808 he resigned the deanery of Gloucester, and in 1815 the benefice of St Andrew's, Holborn. On 6 April 1786 he married Elizabeth Barnard, the niece of Edward Barnard, provost of Eton. The couple had a large family. 
Luxmoore published little, other than visitation articles and several sermons. He gained a reputation less for his intellect than as an example of eighteenth-century episcopal avarice. To D. R. Thomas, the historian of St Asaph diocese, Luxmoore was, quite simply, the worst offender in the matter of nepotism and plurality in its annals. He held, as was usual, the archdeaconry of St Asaph at the same time as the bishopric, but also held many other preferments besides. His family, moreover, were treated with similar liberality, and it has been estimated that he and they at one time absorbed as much as $27,000 per annum of church income in the two dioceses of St Asaph and Hereford; even after the bishop's death, his family continued to enjoy $7000 from the diocese of St Asaph alone. 
Luxmoore died at the bishop's palace, St Asaph, on 21 January 1830. His eldest son, 
Following in his father's footsteps, and owing his early advancement to him, Charles Luxmoore became a noted pluralist. Ordained deacon and priest in 1815, he became rector of Bromyard, and also the following year of Cradley and of Darowen, Montgomeryshire. In addition he held a prebend at Hereford from 1819, as well as being at St Asaph the dean (1826-54) and also the chancellor of the diocese. He died at Cradley, Herefordshire, on 27 April 1854. 'The death of the Dean of St Asaph removes another gigantic pluralist' noted the 'Clerical Journal' (Venn, 'Alum. Cant.'). He was buried in the cathedral at St Asaph.

Lyall, Alfred (1796-1865), philosopher, was born at Findon, Sussex, on 6 February 1796, the youngest son of John Lyall (1752-1805), of Findon, who was engaged in shipping, and his wife, Jane Camming or Comyn (died 1867), of Newcastle upon Tyne. George Lyall, MP, and William Rowe Lyall, DD, dean of Canterbury, were his brothers. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated as a pensioner in 1813, and graduated BA in 1818. 
After spending some time in Frankfurt and Geneva, Lyall settled in a small house of his own at Findon with his widowed mother, to whom he was devoted. While at Findon he edited the 'Annual Register' from 1822 to about 1827. The winter of 1825-6 he passed with an invalid sister in Madeira, and on his return he published in 1827 an anonymous narrative entitled 'Rambles in Madeira and Portugal'. The book was accompanied by a folio volume of lithographic sketches by Lyall's friend and fellow-traveller James Bulwer (died 1879), later rector of Stody, Norfolk. 
Subsequently Lyall returned to Findon and applied himself to philosophy. He produced, anonymously, a thin volume entitled 'Principles of Necessary and Contingent Truth' (1830), which was intended as an introduction to a larger work that was never executed. In 1829 Lyall took holy orders, as curate to his old friend John Hind ('c'.1757-1832), vicar of Findon. 
In December 1830 Lyall married Mary Drummond ('c'.1812-1878), the daughter of James T. Broadwood. They had eleven children, including Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall, lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces of India, and Sir James Broadwood Lyall (1838-1916), lieutenant-governor of the Punjab. 
The winter of 1833-4 Lyall passed at Rome, where he kept a journal. In 1837 he was appointed vicar of Godmersham, Kent, and resumed the editorship of the 'Annual Register', at the request of Rivingtons, the proprietors. A serious illness soon forced him to give up the editorship, and, although a careful and charitable pastor and a good neighbour, he became unable to write much. In 1848 he became rector of Harbledown, near Canterbury. 
In 1856, under the title 'Agonistes, or philosophical strictures, by the author of the 'Principles of necessary and contingent truth'', Lyall published his maturer views, which resembled those of Sir William Hamilton. About a third of the book consists of a very close and generally adverse discussion of the philosophical theories of John Stuart Mill. Lyall also contributed to the 'History of the mediaeval church' in volume 11 of the 'Encyclopedia metropolitana'. He died at Llangollen, Denbighshire, on 11 September 1865, and was buried at Harbledown.

Lyall, George (1778/9-1853), shipowner and merchant, was the eldest son of John Lyall (1752-1805), a merchant and shipowner of London and Findon, Sussex, and his wife, Jane Camming or Comyn (died 1867). On his father's death in 1805, he took over the business. Lyall married, and he and his wife, Margaret Ann, had two sons and two daughters. 
The peace of 1815 brought a deep and long depression. Lyall believed that reforms were needed if prosperity was to return, and supported the 'liberal' wing of the tory (later Conservative) persuasion. In 1821 he was elected a member of the newly formed Political Economy Club, a discussion society made up of eminent economists and select businessmen, who regarded Adam Smith's 'The Wealth of Nations' as the starting point of their discourse. Lyall questioned the usefulness of the 'Navigation Acts'. These were imposed in the seventeenth century to protect trade and shipping; but by the 1820s they seemed to Lyall, and a coterie of like-minded people, detrimental to British enterprise. His commercial experience, and broad outlook, enabled him to give valued advice to William Huskisson who, as president of the Board of Trade (1823-7), made the first dent in the 'Navigation Acts' by negotiating reciprocity treaties with European states and reducing duties on imports. 
The 1832 'Reform Act' promised further change, and Lyall sought a place in parliament to be part of it. Unsuccessful at first, he filled a vacancy in 1833 for the City of London but, defeated in 1835, he did not stand again until 1841. By this time, free trade had become a hotly contested topic. By bringing it to a select committee in 1844, Lyall hoped that his views would prevail. Though he chose its members and briefed witnesses, the committee ended without a report because there was no consensus between free traders and protectionists. Two years later, in 1846, however, the repeal of the corn laws (of which Lyall approved) paved the way for the repeal of the 'Navigation Acts' in 1849. Illness prevented his seeing his work come to fruition; he retired from public life in 1846. During his active years, in and out of parliament, he sat on a variety of select committees: foreign trade (1820, 1824), wrecks (1843), joint stock companies (1844), and the merchant seamen's fund (1845). 
In 1823 Lyall, as chairman of the Shipowners' Society (1823-5), presided over a meeting at The London tavern to press for reform in Lloyd's system of registering ships, because it was inefficient and corrupt. No progress could be made before 1833 when he and his colleague George Palmer (1772-1853) formed a provisional committee to bring together the various interests, and in 1834 the New Lloyd's Register of Shipping came to life under strict rules and supervision of a permanent committee, of which Lyall was an original member. He promoted the important Marine Indemnity Company at Lloyd's, and the London Docks and Guardian Insurance companies. In 1830 he was elected a director of the East India Company, and was chairman in 1841-3 and 1844-6. 
Again, in 1833, and in conjunction with Palmer, Lyall was a founder member of the General London Ship Owners' Society. It replaced the earlier society, and was much more effective as a lobby for the shipping interest, though many members were staunch protectionists and did not agree with Lyall's views. 
Lyall had a sharp mind but he was a poor speaker. With his shy and unobtrusive habits, it was perhaps surprising that Lyall occupied so many important posts. Through his sound judgement, high principles and clear objectives, however, he exercised great influence, and, on occasion, could speak very winningly: in 1834, he persuaded the house to repeal statutes that taxed merchant seamen, and deprived their widows, and orphans, of their tiny pensions; he argued that the maintenance of the Greenwich Hospital, the object of the tax, was the responsibility of the nation. 
An honourable man, grave in manner and gentle in temperament, Lyall was respected in the public sphere and loved by his friends. Nutwood Lodge in Reigate, Surrey, was his country retreat. He died at his London home, 17 Park Crescent, Portland Place, Regent's Park, on 1 September 1853.

Lyall, Robert (1789-1831), botanist and traveller, was born in Abbey parish, Paisley, on 26 November 1789, the son of William and Janet ('nee' Tassie or Tassin) Lyall. Probably educated at Paisley grammar school, he served an apprenticeship before matriculating in medicine at Edinburgh University (1807-10). In September 1808 he bought a house in Paisley High Street but almost immediately went to Manchester, where he spent a year as house surgeon to the Manchester Royal Infirmary, specializing in burns and ophthalmia. 
A letter read at the Linnean Society in February 1811 and six papers on plant irritability in Nicholson's 'Journal' (1809-11) reveal Lyall's talent for botany. At Manchester he made lasting friendships with Dr Peter Roget, the chemist Thomas Henry, and John Dalton, the natural philosopher; they all held senior positions with the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society to which Lyall was elected a corresponding member in January 1810, on his return to Paisley where he practised as a surgeon. He was a member of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh in 1809-10, became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on 22 March 1810, and was appointed medical practitioner to the Paisley Town Hospital in 1811 or 1812. He sold his High Street property in 1813, and published a competent 'Essay on the Chemical and Medicinal Qualities of the Candren Well in Renfrewshire' in 1814. 
During 1815 Lyall went to Russia as physician to a St Petersburg nobleman, accompanied Dmitry Poltoratsky, a progressive agriculturist, to his Kaluga and Oryol estates, and became Countess Orlov-Chesmenska's house doctor, a position which he held four years. In May 1816 he graduated as a doctor and surgeon at the Imperial Medico-Surgical Academy, St Petersburg, with a thesis on staphyloma. As a foreign member of Edinburgh's Wernerian Natural History Society at Moscow in January 1817, Lyall joined the select Imperial Agricultural, Natural History, and Physico-Medical societies. 
Some time before 1819 Lyall married. Little is known about his wife, Mary (Mariya); possibly she was Russian. In 1819 the couple visited England and Lyall conveyed numerous seeds to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and discussed plans for a book on Moscow with publishers. From March 1820 he acted as General Nashchokin's physician at Semenovskoye, near Moscow. Between April and August 1822 he escorted a Marchese Pucci, Count Salazar and Edward Penrhyn to the southern Russian provinces. He returned to London with his family in August 1823. 
In 1823 Lyall published his 'Character of the Russians and a Detailed History of Moscow' (from the middle ages to 1820 and its rebuilding after the 1812 fire). Attractively illustrated, it included noteworthy descriptions of scientific societies, Moscow plants, edible mushrooms, Russian baths, and architecture. His outspoken criticisms of the nobility and the peasantry had precipitated his departure from Russia, and the book's dedication to Tsar Alexander was disavowed by the Russian vice-consul. Lyall replied to a particularly biased critique of his work, which appeared in the 'Quarterly Review' of 30 December 1824, challenging the anonymous writer -- John Barrow (1764-1848) -- one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society to a duel in February 1826. 
On Tsar Alexander's death Lyall wrote three very frank articles in the 'New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal' (January-March 1826) about the tsar (reproduced in 'The Times'), Grand Duke Constantine, and Tsar Nicholas, stressing their despotism and the inquisitorial police state. Further anecdotes of Nicholas and publication of Lyall's memoirs of Alexander's reign, advertised in 1826, never materialized. The two volumes of Lyall's informative 'Travels in Russia, the Krimea, the Caucasus, and Georgia' appeared in 1825. Critical as ever, he provides useful sections, among others, about Russian civil and military hospitals, the Orlov family, and Count Razumovsky's famous Gorenky Botanical Garden, near Moscow. Lyall's brief 'Account of the Organization, Administration, and Present State of the Military Colonies in Russia' (1824) resulted from these journeys and was translated into German and French. His annotated pamphlet, 'Medical Evidence Relating to the Duration of Human Pregnancy', in the Gardner peerage cause at the House of Lords, reached two editions (1826 and 1827), gaining him recognition in 'The Lancet', which also printed his letter on the difficulties of determining pregnancy (19 Aug 1826). 
Lyall, a member of the Royal Asiatic (1823-7) and Linnean (1824-7) societies, succeeded James Hastie as British resident agent for Madagascar (1826), and was elected one of the Zoological Society's first corresponding members in May 1827 (from when his lithograph portrait by Gauci may date). According to his official journal he disembarked with his large family at Port Louis, Mauritius, on 2 October 1827 and sailed to Tamatave in Madagascar, where he met the island's King Radama I, before returning to Mauritius to await the travelling season. He arrived at Tamatave for his next visit in the following June, to be informed of Radama's serious illness; he hastened in July to the capital, Tananarivo, in the island's interior, which he reached on 31 August after the king's death. Queen Ranavalona refused to receive him as an agent of the British government in November 1828, but as the weather was unsuitable for travelling Lyall spent time at the capital, botanizing, and collecting natural history specimens. On 29 March 1829 he was arrested for 'sorcery' -- offending the gods by collecting plants and reptiles. He was banished from the island and he and his family returned to Tamatave on 22 April and sailed back to Mauritius. 
The 'Journal of the Royal Institution' for 1831 reproduces Lyall's recordings of the Madagascan capital's weather between January and 25 March 1829, made with Adie's sympiesometer, Rutherford's thermometer, and Daniell's hygrometer. In a letter from Port Louis, dated 1 September 1829, to William Jackson Hooker, professor of botany at Glasgow University, Lyall bitterly regretted his disrupted plans to advance science, especially natural history, in Madagascar. Nevertheless, he shipped 450 Madagascan plants to Hooker and others to the Linnean, Wernerian, and Medico-Botanical societies and to his friend, Sir Alexander Crichton, in London. Two surviving catalogues describe Lyall's plants, which were incorporated with Hooker's collections in the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew after Hooker's death in 1865. Other Madagascan plants collected by Lyall are at Edinburgh, New York, and in Mauritius; specimens from Mauritius are also at Kew, while some from St Helena are preserved in Berlin. Altogether fourteen species of Madagascan plants have been named after Lyall. In April 1830 he sent a box of untraced Madagascan minerals, with an extant catalogue, to Professor William Buckland (1784-1856) for the Geological Society of London. Lyall had prepared an account for the press from his private journal about his experiences at the Madagascan capital, but died on 23 May 1831 at Port Louis, Mauritius. His death certificate gives the cause as a malarial fever, contracted in Madagascar during 1828.

Lyall, William Rowe (1788-1857), dean of Canterbury, born in London on 11 February 1788, was the second son and fourth child of John Lyall (1752-1805) of Findon, Sussex, a Scottish merchant and shipowner in the city of London, and his wife, Jane Camming or Comyn (died 1867). His elder brother, George Lyall (1778/9-1853), was MP for the City of London and chairman of the East India Company. William Lyall was educated at Fulham Park School, and in 1805 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1810 and MA in 1816. In 1817 he married Catharine, youngest daughter of Joseph Brandreth, physician, of Hall Green, Liverpool. There were no children of the marriage. 
Lyall was curate of Fawley, Hampshire, from 1812 to 1815, when he moved to London. He was appointed chaplain to St Thomas's Hospital in 1817, and soon afterwards assistant preacher at Lincoln's Inn. In 1822 he became examining chaplain to William Howley, bishop of London, his patron, by whom he was appointed rector of Weeley, Essex, in 1823 and archdeacon of Colchester in 1824. He was Warburtonian lecturer at Lincoln's Inn in 1826, when his subject was 'The prophetical evidences of Christianity'. In 1827 he became rector of Fairsted, Essex, and in 1833 exchanged this living and that of Weeley for the cure of Hadleigh, Essex, where he carried out a notable revival of the parish. In June 1841 Howley, now archbishop of Canterbury, appointed him to the archdeaconry of Maidstone and to a prebendal stall at Canterbury, and the following year he became rector of Great Chart, near Ashford. In November 1845 he accepted Sir Robert Peel's offer of the deanery of Canterbury. Earlier he had been one of the founders of St Augustine's College, Canterbury, and as dean he did much for the restoration of the cathedral. 
Lyall made his name as a young man with two articles in the 'Quarterly Review' (6, 1811, 1-37; 12, 1814, 281-317) challenging the metaphysical system of Dugald Stewart and proving that an Anglican theologian could match the Scottish Enlightenment on its own ground. He was editor of the 'British Critic' in 1816-17, and in 1820 was entrusted by Archbishop Howley with reorganizing the 'Encyclopaedia metropolitana', intended to act as a Christian counterweight to the secular 'Britannica'. His contributors, enlisted from all tendencies, included the future adversaries R. D. Hampden and J. H. Newman. The latter wrote the articles on Cicero and Apollonius of Tyana -- his first published work. From 1832 to 1846 Lyall was co-editor with H. J. Rose of the 'Theological Library', which ran to fourteen volumes. The conference he and Rose organized at Rose's rectory at Hadleigh, Suffolk, in 1833 is generally regarded as marking the inauguration of the Oxford Movement, though Lyall himself stood aside from the movement. His increasing interest in biblical scholarship bore fruit in 1840 in his major work, 'Propaedia prophetica: a View of the Use and Design of the Old Testament', which made his reputation as an interpreter of Jewish religion and society. Though he appointed his brother, four nephews, and three nephews-in-law to livings at his disposal, he took pains to match the appointee with the appointment, and demanded high standards from his clergy. Cheerful and courteous in manner, he was eirenic in his churchmanship and inherited from his father a sound instinct for business which served him well as an organizer of church building in Essex and cathedral restoration in Canterbury. 
Lyall suffered a stroke in 1852 from which he never recovered; he died at the deanery, Canterbury, on 17 February 1857, and was buried in Harbledown churchyard on 26 February.

Lydgate, John (c.1370-1449/50?), poet and prior of Hatfield Regis, was born at Lidgate in Suffolk, 'wher Bachus licour doth ful scarsli flete' ('The Fall of Princes', bk 8, l. 194), a few miles south-west of Bury St Edmunds where he was to spend most of his life, and where, presumably, there was a better supply of wine to refresh his 'drie soule'. Later in the poem he refers to his village, at the time of the slaying of St Edmund at Hoxne, with some pride as: '
be olde tyme a famous castel toun; 

In Danys tyme it was bete doun. 
(ibid., bk 9, ll. 3431-5)' Elsewhere, in his 'Isopes fabules', an apology for his lack of rhetorical skill leads him to remark wryly: '
Have me excusyd: I was born in Lydgate; 

Of Tullius gardeyn I passyd nat the gate. 
('Minor Poems', 567)' The date of his birth can be estimated from two references in his works: in the prologue to 'The Siege of Thebes' (1420-22?) he says he is 'nygh fyfty yere of age' ('Siege of Thebes', l. 93), and in 'The Fall of Princes' (completed in 1438 or 1439) he speaks of his 'mor than thre score yeeris' ('Fall of Princes', bk 8, l. 191) -- and of his 'pallid age' and 'tremblyng joyntes'. 
In his 'Testament', a penitential poem which contains some apparently autobiographical material, Lydgate describes his conversion from a sinful life through the sight of a crucifix with the inscription 'vide' ('Behold my mekenesse, O child, and leve thy pryde') depicted on the wall of a cloister in the monastery. This event occurred when he was 'wythinne xv' years of age ('Minor Poems', 356), after he had 'entered religion'. The poem, probably in traditional manner, somewhat heightens its portrayal of his 'myspent tyme' (Lydgate says that he 'ran into gardyns' to steal apples -- just as St Augustine robbed a pear tree), but there is no reason to doubt the general truth of its biographical details. Lydgate presents himself as a feckless child: '
loth to lerne, loved no besynesse, 

Save pley or merth, straunge to spelle or rede 

' who did not want to go to school and was: '
redier cheristones for to telle 

Than gon to chirche, or here the sacryng belle. 
('Minor Poems', 352-3)' He was a jester and a scoffer, who went to bed late and got up late, did not wash for dinner, and hated rebukes or correction -- in short, 'a chyld resemblyng which was not lyke to thryve', 'like a truant'. Even in the monastery, where he made his profession 'a yere complete', he was at first ill-disciplined and riotous (preferring 'good wyne that was clere' to contemplation and 'holy histories') until his life was changed. The recollection of the word 'vide' causes him, now in his 'last age', to take up his pen and compose a 'litel dite' -- which is an eloquent lament from the crucified Christ to sinful man. 
Lydgate's literary career clearly owes much to his monastic upbringing. The majority of his poems bear the mark of a pious and learned mind. He is often referred to simply as the Monk of Bury -- by others and by himself ('Siege of Thebes', l. 93), and that rich and powerful abbey provided him with one of the finest libraries in England, and, probably, with valuable connections to sources of literary patronage. At some stage he studied at Oxford, probably at Gloucester College, the Benedictine hall, although the surviving evidence is thin. John Shirley, the fifteenth-century scribe who seems to have had a fairly close connection with him, and who provides much valuable and generally trustworthy information in his rubrics to his poems, says in his copy of the version of the Aesopic fable of the dog and the cheese (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 59, second half of the fifteenth century) that Lydgate made it 'in Oxenford' ('Minor Poems', 598). That Lydgate is probably to be identified with 'notre treschier en dieu Dan J. L. vostre commoigne [your fellow monk]' for whom Prince Henry wrote to the abbot of Bury, between 1406 and 1408, for the 'continuance in the study of divinity or canon law at Oxford' on the recommendation of the chancellor of the university, Richard Courtenay (Legge, 411-12), may indicate that he returned to Oxford later for a period of further study. It has been suggested by J. Norton-Smith ('Poems', 195) that during his time at Oxford he made the acquaintance of the prince of Wales (who was probably at Queen's College 'c'.1398), his future patron, and of Edmund Lacy of University College, who went on to become dean of the royal chapel at Windsor and (from 1420) the bishop of Exeter for whom Lydgate translated 'Gloriosa dicta sunt de te' ('Minor Poems', 315-23). Bale's claim that he also studied at Cambridge does not seem to be supported by any evidence -- that Lydgate wrote a set of verses on the foundation of that university (ibid., 652-5) need not be significant. Bale also says that after returning from travelling in France and Italy, Lydgate opened a school for the sons of noblemen. This too is unproven, though some lines in 'God is myn Helpere' may, if they are genuinely autobiographical, support the idea of travel (and, perhaps, some adventure): '
I have been offte in dyvers londys 

And in many dyvers regiouns, 

Have eskapyd fro my foois bondys 

In citees, castellys, and in touns; 

Among folk of sundry naciouns 

Wente ay forth. 
(ibid., 28)' 

By the end of the fourteenth century Lydgate was well advanced on his ecclesiastical career. He was ordained acolyte on 13 March 1389, and subdeacon on 17 November or December of that year. He became deacon on 31 May 1393, and four years later priest, on 7 April 1397. The earlier stages of his literary career are less clear. Apart from Shirley's not very informative note on the Aesop, there is nothing to fix the dates of many poems in the early years before 'c'.1412. It is often assumed that his poems concerned with love are from this period, but this is simply conjecture. There are a number of these without any indication of date, like the 'Ballade of her that hath All Virtues' ('Minor Poems', 379), written 'at the request of a squyer that served in loves court'. One might guess that this kind of commission is likely to have come his way after he had already become known as a poet. His very 'Chaucerian' poems 'The Complaint of the Black Knight' (alternatively known as 'A Complaynt of a Loveres Lyfe') and 'The Flour of Curtesye' are often thought to have been written at the very beginning of the fifteenth century, as imitations of and perhaps acts of homage to the recently dead poet whom Lydgate admired and always refers to as his 'master'. His indebtedness to Chaucer can hardly be exaggerated: his poetry is full of Chaucerian topics, themes, and verbal echoes. He praises Chaucer again and again for his eloquence and for the way that he has 'illumined' the English language, but does not claim to have met him. He was, however, a friend of the poet's son Thomas Chaucer (died 1434), for whom he wrote an elegant poem on the occasion of his departure on a journey (perhaps as part of an embassy to Burgundy in 1414). Thomas Chaucer seems to have had a circle of friends with literary interests. His daughter Alice (died 1475) married (as her second husband) Thomas Montagu, earl of Salisbury (died 1428), and after his death William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (died 1450), both men with some literary tastes. Lydgate's 'Virtues of the Mass' ('Minor Poems', 87-115) is said in a rubric in one manuscript to have been done at the request of the countess of Suffolk. 
Lydgate seems to have begun enjoying literary patronage at the beginning of the fifteenth century. 'The Temple of Glass', an ambitious Chaucerian dream poem, is usually regarded as an early work: the manuscripts indicate a process of extensive revision. The poem was very popular in the fifteenth century. It is, according to Shirley, written 'a la request d'un amoureux' -- if so, he cannot be identified. In the final version a motto which the dreamer sees on the lady's garment reads 'de mieulx en mieulx': this is one that was used by the Pastons, but it also appears in earlier French poetry, so that the suggestion that it has some connection with them -- and in particular with the marriage of William Paston and Agnes Berry in 1420 -- cannot be accepted with certainty. In the temple of Venus the dreamer overhears the lament of a beautiful lady who is bound to one whom she does not love, and later that of the knight her lover. Venus urges patience and faithfulness and consoles them with the hope that their future joy is fated. From this period probably comes 'Resoun and Sensuallyte' ('c'.1408?), which is attributed to Lydgate by the sixteenth-century antiquary Stow: it is based on the first part of a French allegorical poem 'Les echecs amoureux' expanded into a learned and encyclopaedic work (containing, for example, extensive information on mythology). 

'The Troy Book' is the first of Lydgate's major poems that can be precisely dated. It was commissioned by Prince Henry on 31 October 1412, and, after eight years, the completed work was presented to him, now Henry V, in 1420. The prince, says Lydgate in the prologue, wished to have recalled the ancient worthiness of 'verray knyghthod' and 'the prowesse of olde chivalrie' ('Troy Book', prologue, ll. 75-8) and to have the 'noble story' made available in English (ibid., ll. 111-15). Lydgate's main source is the thirteenth-century Latin 'Historia destructionis Troiae' of Guido delle Colonne (a copy of which was in the library at Bury) which itself is a version of Benoit de Ste Maure's 'Roman de Troie'. In five books containing over 30,000 lines in couplets Lydgate records the whole story from the Argonauts, the founding and destruction of old Troy, to Priam and the building of the new city, Paris and Helen, the outbreak of war, the battles, and the fates of the heroes. The story has an episodic structure, and is elaborated with rhetorical laments, descriptions, and speeches. These often have an impressive eloquence -- some of the natural descriptions (of dawns, for example), some of the laments for the dead heroes, or the lament of Troilus and Criseyde at their parting, or the lament for Troy ('Troy Book', bk 4, ll. 7036ff.), for instance. Lydgate demonstrates here already his skill at constructing scenes of pathos. He works into the narrative a mass of encyclopaedic material relating to history and mythology (for example, the descriptions of the attributes of the goddesses in the judgement of Paris, or of the ancient theatre and the performance of tragedies). 'The Troy Book' presents a 'mirror for princes', both in particular episodes marked by sententious comments: '
late Priam alwey your merour ben, 

Hasty errour be tymes to correcte 
('Troy Book', bk 2, ll. 1898-9)' and as a whole, emphasizing a number of major themes including the dangers of political discord and war: '
Lo what meschef lyth in variaunce 

Amonge lordis, whan thei nat accorde 
(ibid., bk 3, ll. 2342-3)' as well as the power of Fortune, the transitoriness of earthly things, and the impermanence of human ambition.'The Siege of Thebes' (1420?-22), probably based on a French prose version of the 'Roman de Thebes', is not a commissioned work. No doubt intended as a companion piece to 'The Troy Book', it may also be a compliment to Chaucer (though hardly an attempt to improve on him, as has been suggested). In the prologue Lydgate imagines himself joining the Canterbury pilgrims on their return journey from Canterbury, and is persuaded by the Host to tell the first tale. The fiction is kept up throughout by a number of comments, and a reference to 'The Knight's Tale' when Theseus appears. In three parts, amounting to only 4716 lines, it is notably shorter than 'The Troy Book', and, while not exactly brisk, it is less encyclopaedic. It contains some vivid descriptive passages and some fine pathetic scenes, but Lydgate is, as usual, concerned to underline the significance of the material, and again to offer a 'mirror for princes'. A king should be generous and liberal, and free from 'doubleness' -- 'trouthe shulde longe to a kyng' ('Siege of Thebes', l. 1722) -- and Lydgate warns of the dangers of falsehood and discord. In the opposing views of Jocasta, who urges negotiation rather than war (ibid., l. 3655ff.), and the council of Adrastus, which argues that to give up 'the hegh emprise' would be an act of cowardice and dishonour, and would betray their glorious ancestors, 'that whilom [formerly] wern so manly conquerours' (ibid., l. 4117ff.), Lydgate is presenting a contemporary English dilemma. The poem ends with a denunciation of the destructiveness of war (springing from pride, covetousness, and false ambition) and a vision of peace when the sword and spear of Mars will no longer menace, but 'love and pees in hertys shal awake' and bring between countries 'pees and quyet, concord and unyte' -- words that seem to be echoing the phrasing of the treaty of Troyes (1420) which (for a time) brought peace between England and France. 
Perhaps from this period comes an impressive religious poem of some 6000 lines, 'The Life of Our Lady'. It is impossible to be sure of its date, but a rubric in one manuscript says that it was compiled 'at the excitation and styrryng of our worshipful prince, kyng Harry the fifthe'. If this is correct, it would support the date of 1421-2 given to it by its modern editors, but it is strange that there is no reference to Henry in the text itself. Possibly he suggested the work but died before it was completed. 
The death of Henry V on 31 August 1422 did not cause any interruption in Lydgate's Lancastrian patronage. Since the heir to the throne was only nine months old, the effective government was in the hands of a regency council, and it may be that an awareness of the tensions within this and of the potential dangers led Lydgate to compose his only known prose work, 'The Serpent of Division'. A date of December 1422 has been suggested, but has not been universally accepted, nor has the suggested identification of the 'most worshipful master' at whose request it was written with Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, the protector of England. It is a tract on the horrors of civil war as exemplified in the life of Julius Caesar. The material comes from Lucan's 'Pharsalia', a French version of that, and the 'Speculum historiale' of Vincent of Beauvais. Whatever the precise date of 'The Serpent of Division', the topic was relevant and the moral direct: 'all prudent prynces whiche have governaunce in provynces and regions schulde take ensample what harme and damage is and how finall a destruccion is to bene devyded amonge hemselfe' ('The Serpent of Division', 58). Duke Humphrey was later certainly an important patron of Lydgate, and the poem that Lydgate wrote (1422-3) for his approaching marriage with Jacqueline of Hainault ('Minor Poems', 601-8) suggests an already close relationship. A poem entitled a 'Complaint for my Lady of Gloucester and Holland' (ibid., 608-13), which expresses warm sympathy for Jacqueline after her abandonment by Humphrey, carries the annotation 'Lidegate daun Iohan' in Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 59, a late Shirley manuscript, but Shirley's rubric attributes it to 'a chapellayne of my lordes of Gloucestre'. 
In 1423 Lydgate was elected prior of Hatfield Regis, Essex, a small alien priory appropriated to Bury, an office that he held until 8 April 1434, although he was probably not resident throughout that period (in 1426 he was at Paris, and at other times at London or Bury). It is usually thought that perhaps 'c'.1425 he wrote his version of the story of 'Guy of Warwick' ('Minor Poems', 516-38), based on chronicle rather than romance sources, for Margaret, the eldest daughter of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, and his first wife, Elizabeth, though the rubric recording her request gives her later title countess of Shrewsbury and Lady Talbot, and, if it is not simply an indication of the date of the copying, could support a later date (she married John Talbot in 1433, and became countess of Shrewsbury in 1442). Lydgate, however, certainly had connections with Beauchamp in the period 1425-6, and his 'The Fyfftene Joyes of Oure Lady' (ibid., 260-67) is said in one rubric to have been done at the instance of his second wife, Isabella, the daughter of Thomas, Lord Despenser. 
It was perhaps in the service of the earl of Warwick, then acting regent of France during Bedford's absence, that Lydgate went to Paris in 1426. In July of that year at Warwick's request he wrote a verse account (from the French of Laurence Calot) of 'The Title and Pedigree of Henry VI' designed to prove the king's claim to the French throne ('Minor Poems', 621-8). 'The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man', a verse translation of Guillaume de Deguileville's 'Pelerinage de la vie humaine' done for Warwick's deputy Thomas Montagu, earl of Salisbury, and his wife, Alice Chaucer, was begun in 1426 and was finished by 3 November 1428, the date of Montagu's death from a wound received at the siege of Orleans -- unless 'we assume that the abruptness of the end, and the lack of the usual dedicatory epilogue, indicate that the patron was already dead' (Pearsall, 173). Unusually, Lydgate does not record his authorship in the text, and it has been questioned. The illustration often reproduced as showing Lydgate and a pilgrim presenting the book to Montagu is in fact pasted in as a title-page in BL, Harley MS 4826, which includes a copy of Lydgate's 'St Edmund' but not the 'Pilgrimage'. The work is attributed to Lydgate by Stow, but it has been suggested that this rests on a misunderstanding of an ambiguous remark by Shirley in a versified list of contents to one of his manuscripts, in which he mentions a prose translation of the 'humayne pilgrymage' and then about ten lines later refers to Lydgate's translation 'of this booke and of other mo'. The question is whether the 'book' is the Middle English prose translation (not, it seems, by Lydgate) or the French original. If it is not the latter, it would seem that here lies the origin of a misattribution. There would perhaps be more urgency in solving the problem if the verse translation were more distinguished. 
It is, however, certain that Lydgate translated the French 'Danse macabre' ('The Dance of Death'), which he says he saw on a wall in Paris (it had been painted in the cemetery of the Innocents in 1424-5). This is a good translation and it was used to accompany a painting of the dance in the cloister of the Pardon churchyard on the north side of St Paul's Cathedral in London, where it survived until 1549. It is one of a number of poems which are intended to, or could be made to, accompany illustrations, whether in manuscripts or in the form of wall-paintings or painted cloths. His 'Bycorne and Chichevache' ('Minor Poems', 433-8) on the monsters that eat, respectively, patient husbands and patient wives, is a 'devise of a peynted or desteyned clothe for an halle a parlour or a chaumbre', and provides (at the request of a worthy citizen of London) what is apparently a text to accompany a series of images. Religious poems of this kind include 'The Dolerous Pyte of Crystes Passioun' (ibid., 250-52), which seems designed to be used with the 'imago pietatis' of the wounded Christ ('looke on this fygure', 'my bloody woundis, set here in picture', and so on). Similarly, 'On the Image of Pity' (ibid., 297-9) is to accompany an image of a 'pieta'. 'Beholde and se this glorious fygure', begins 'The Image of Our Lady' (ibid., 290-91), which is apparently to accompany a copy of the painting of the Virgin by St Luke in Rome. Stanzas from Lydgate's 'Lamentation of Mary Magdalen' and his 'Testament' were painted in the Clopton chapel of the Holy Trinity at Long Melford, Suffolk (a church that belonged to Bury), in the later fifteenth century. 
These poems are sometimes close to pageants or mummings. 'The Legend of St George' ('Minor Poems', 145-54) was, according to Shirley's rubric, 'the devyse of a steyned [painted] halle... ymagyned by Daun Johan the Monk of Bury Lydegate, and made with the balades' for the London Guild of Armourers (St George 'roode in steel armed bright'). The note in the manuscript 'the poete first declarethe' suggests that the verses were read out when the paintings were first presented or installed. However, they may also have been painted on the walls with them. A number of Lydgate's semi-dramatic mummings or disguisings survive. Some of these are for royal occasions -- Christmas celebrations at Eltham or Windsor -- some for city guilds or civic occasions -- for the mercers (Epiphany 1429), the goldsmiths (Candlemas 1429), the sheriffs of London at Bishopswood (May day). They are sometimes simply the verses to be spoken by a presenter before the giving of gifts, sometimes introducing or accompanying processions or the entry of characters (as perhaps Fortune and the four cardinal Virtues in the London mumming for 'the great estates') or mimed actions (as perhaps in the 'Mumming at Hertford', a rather lively piece described by Shirley as 'a disguysing of the rude upplandisshe [rustic] people compleyning on hir wyves, with the boystous aunswere of hir wyves'). 
Henry VI's coronation (at the age of seven) in London in 1429, and later in Paris, is celebrated in a 'Roundel for the Coronation' ('Minor Poems', 622) and other poems. There is also a verse description of the pageants that greeted the young king on his return and entry into London in 1432 after his coronation in Paris (ibid., 630-48). A number of courtly occasional poems probably come from this time, as for instance the 'Balade on a New Year's Gift of an Eagle' (ibid., 649-51), which according to Shirley was presented to the king and his mother, Queen Catherine, on new year's day at the castle of Hertford. In 1433 the king spent Christmas at Bury. He was received with great splendour, and remained until Easter 1434, when he became a member of the abbey's confraternity (which included a number of powerful nobles and their wives, some of whom were Lydgate's patrons). At the request of the abbot, William Curteys (died 1446), Lydgate wrote for the king the legend of the patron saint of the abbey and the region, St Edmund, and of St Fremund, the martyr's nephew. In the 'Legend of SS Edmund and Fremund', Lydgate brings to the saint's life the epic quality already attempted in 'The Life of Our Lady'. Its 3700 lines, divided into three books, tells the traditional story of his martyrdom at the hands of the Danes in a fluent narrative with some excellent dialogue and dramatic scenes. The king, presented as both hero and martyr, lion and lamb, is presented as the protector of and the exemplar for the young 'sixth Harry'. His three crowns, expounded in the prologue as those of the kingdom, martyrdom, and chastity, correspond to Henry's English, French, and heavenly crowns. Lydgate wrote a number of other saints' legends, not all of which can be dated -- those, for instance, of St Margaret (ibid., 173) for Lady March, or the 'Legend of SS Alban and Amphibel' (in 1439 at the request of Whethamstede, the abbot of St Albans), in 4700 lines treating the 'prothomartyr of Brutis Albion' in a rather grand manner. 
Lydgate was now already embarked on his most ambitious work. 'The Fall of Princes' was begun 'c'.1431 at the request of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and completed in 1438 or 1439. It is based on Laurent de Premierfait's French version of Boccaccio's 'De casibus virorum illustrium', and runs to 36,365 lines in nine books. The long task weighed heavily even on Lydgate, who makes a number of semi-comic references to it, and at some point wrote a begging poem, the 'Letter to Gloucester' ('Minor Poems', 665-7), a witty request for funds. If Humphrey was niggardly with money, he was less so with advice and encouragement, suggesting, for instance, the inclusion of envoys (which summarize, comment, present 'remedies' of Fortune, and instruct princes), or the use of Coluccio Salutati's 'Declamation of Lucretia', which he lent to Lydgate. The poem follows the pattern familiar to English readers from Chaucer's 'Monk's Tale' of a succession of 'tragedies' ranging chronologically from Adam to King Jean of France, captured at Poitiers in 1356. The fallen princes pass in front of the author, Bochas, in his study, lament, tell their stories, or urge him to do so. Lydgate's strong sense of pathos is evident in some of his expansions, for example of the lament of Canacee. His sententious envoys sometimes become sombre choric laments for heroes (such as that on Alcibiades), and he can achieve moments of melancholy grandeur, as in the envoy on Rome at the end of the second book. There is much evidence of his wide reading and of a sympathy for the stories of the ancient world. He urges the traditional doctrines of moderation, the avoidance of pride, and the pursuit of virtue, and demonstrates the horror of discord and strife between kinsfolk. This advice, though couched in general terms, was highly relevant to contemporary princes. 'The Fall of Princes' was very popular in the fifteenth century: more than thirty manuscripts survive, some of them finely illustrated, and it was quarried for excerpts. It goes into sixteenth-century printed editions, and is a model for 'The Mirror for Magistrates'. 
Lydgate was at Bury, it seems, from 1434 until his death. He was awarded a royal annuity of 10 marks (22 April 1439), the last grant of which was made at Michaelmas 1449. From this period comes 'The Debate between the Horse, Goose and Sheep' ('Minor Poems', 539-66), which contains an allusion to Philip of Burgundy's attack on Calais in 1436. During the last years of his life Lydgate wrote some verses on the marriage of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou and the pageants for her entry into London in 1445. What seems to be his last long poem, 'The Secrees of Philisoffres', a translation of the 'Secreta secretorum' then attributed to Aristotle was left unfinished, and was completed by his disciple Benedict Burgh. That Lydgate's final line (1491) with the words 'deth al consumyth' is followed by the note 'here dyed this translator, and nobil poete: and the yonge folowere gan his prologe on this wyse' makes a very dramatic story. 
The actual date of Lydgate's death is not certain, but is probably 1449 or 1450. The suggested later date of 1451 depends on a remark by Bishop Alcock that Lydgate wrote a poem on the occasion of the final loss of France and Gascony, but the fact that his royal grant ceases after 29 September 1449 suggests that Lydgate died between that date and Michaelmas of the following year. This seems to be confirmed by the description of him as 'sumtyme monke of Byry' in John Metham's 'Amoryus and Cleopes', written in the twenty-seventh year of the sixth King Henry, by which he may mean 1449. He was buried at Bury abbey, and a three-line epitaph (according to Tanner) described him as one 'qui fuit quondam celebris Brittaniae fama Poesis' ('who was once renowned poet of famous Britain'). 
Much of Lydgate's vast output is impossible to date, and the range of topics that he treats (outside those listed above) is very large: religious lyrics, translations of Latin hymns, verse prayers, poems of moral advice, didactic poems, fables, satires, instructional poems on table manners, rules of health, or in praise of the nine properties of wine, and so on. In the course of the fifteenth century many anonymous works were attributed to him: modern scholarship denies him the authorship of, for instance, 'The Assembly of the Gods', 'The Court of Sapience', and 'London Lickpenny'. It has also been tentatively suggested that he may have had some hand in 'The Libel of English Policy', but there is no external evidence to support this. Equally impressive is the list of his patrons, beginning with two kings and continuing with royal dukes and noblemen and their wives to the lesser gentry in what is a veritable roll-call of the great and good in late medieval England. Add to this the London merchants and the guilds, and the justice of Thomas Warton's remark can be comprehended: 'his muse was of universal access; and he was not only the poet of his monastery, but of the world in general' (Warton, 1774-81, repr., 350). 
Lydgate's reputation was at its height in the fifteenth century: he is praised again and again, and his name is regularly linked with those of Chaucer and Gower as one of the masters of English poetry. His fame continued through the sixteenth century, but gradually faded. In the eighteenth, interest was rekindled and he received a judicious account in Warton's 'History of English Poetry' and enthusiastic praise from Thomas Gray ('Some Remarks on the Poems of John Lydgate', 1760). This very sympathetic and thoughtful treatment of his compassion for suffering and his skill in creating scenes of pathos has been eclipsed by the vituperative denunciation of Lydgate by Joseph Ritson in 1802 as 'this voluminous, prosaick, and driveling monk', whose works 'by no means deserve the name of poetry' (Ritson, 87ff.). Scholarly interest in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Germany and England has produced edited texts of his works, and provided more material for understanding the literary culture that moulded him and which he helped to mould. This undoubtedly voluminous and often uneven poet will probably never recover his contemporary reputation, but at his best he can produce impressive moments and scenes, and is certainly a poet worthy of the name.

Lydiat, Thomas (1572-1646), chronologist, was baptized on 4 April 1572 at Alkerton, Oxfordshire, one of several children of Christopher Lydiat (died 1613/14), citizen of London and, since 1567, lord of Alkerton manor. He entered Winchester College about 1584, and matriculated from New College, Oxford, on 28 January 1592. He became a full fellow in 1593, graduated BA on 3 May 1595, and proceeded MA on 5 February 1599. He contributed poems to the memorial collections 'Oxoniensium stenagmos, sive, Carmina ab Oxoniensibus Conscripta in obitum illustrissimi herois, D. Christopheri Hattoni militis' (1592) for Christopher Hatton, and 'Oxoniensis academiae funebre officium' (1603) for Queen Elizabeth. 
Lydiat relinquished his fellowship in 1603 rather than study divinity, owing to 'a great defect in his memory and utterance, of which he often complained' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 3.185). He pursued instead his key interests in astronomy and chronology, subsisting on private means. Lectures on these subjects delivered in 1599 were published as 'Tractatus de variis annorum formis', together with his 'Praelectio astronomica de natura coeli et conditionibus elementorum' and 'Disquisitio physiologica de origine fontium', in London in 1605. These were a significant contribution to burgeoning scientific and theological debates on the nature of the cosmos and the structure of the calendar. Lydiat's use of physics supported the developing belief in a fluid universe, and, like Kepler, he abandoned the established astronomical principle of circularity in the face of empirical observation. He was one of the first to state that the sun 'describes a segment, not of a circle, but of an oval line' ('Praelectio astronomica', cap. 7, p. 64). He remained harnessed to scripture, however, arguing that creation, while fluid, was finite, being ultimately contained within a sphere surrounded by water and controlled by God. Lydiat's early work simultaneously defined the 'octodesexcentenarian' period, by which he managed to reconcile solar and lunar months in a complex annual calendar on a 592-year cycle. 
These multiple claims launched Lydiat into protracted arguments with the continental scholars Kepler and Scaliger. The latter called Lydiat 'the greatest monster that ever England produced' and 'the veryest fool in the whole world' (Plot, 223), comparing him to travelling troupes of English actors. Among other matters, Lydiat challenged Scaliger's dating of both creation and the birth of Christ; his ideas were in turn refuted in Scaliger's 'Isagogici canones chronologiae' (1606). Lydiat defended himself in his 'Defensio tractatus de variis annorum formis... contra J. Scaligeri obtrectationem una cum examen ejus canonum chronologiae isagogicorum' (1607), and the 'Recensio et explicatio argumentorum... insertis brevibus confutationibus opinionum Scaligeranae... atque Johannis Keppleri' (1613). 
Lydiat's growing reputation led to his appointment as chronographer and cosmographer to Henry, prince of Wales, who made him a member of his household on an annual pension of 40 marks. In return Lydiat dedicated to Prince Henry his key work on chronology, 'Emendatio temporum ab initio mundi... contra Scaligerum et alios' (London, 1609). He was introduced to James Ussher, through whose influence he moved to Ireland; he was admitted as a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and graduated MA from that institution in 1609. Ussher attempted to procure him the mastership of a school in Armagh with an annual income of $50, but by August 1611 Lydiat had returned to England. Ussher later built on Lydiat's research in constructing his famous protestant chronology of world history, and the two remained lifelong friends. Suggestions that Lydiat was Ussher's brother-in-law are without foundation, and there is no evidence that he ever married. 
In 1612, perhaps as a result of the death of the prince of Wales, Lydiat became rector of Alkerton, his family parish. He remained based here for the rest of his life, rebuilding the rectory in 1625 and remodelling the chancel about the same time. He continued to engage in scholarly pursuits, producing over 600 sermons and harmonies of the gospels in English, Hebrew, and Greek together with other works. In the 1620s Lydiat published three astronomical and chronological works: 'Solis et lunae periodus seu annus magnus' (1620), 'De annis solaris mensura epistola astronomica ad Hen. Savilium' (1620), and 'Numerus aureus melioribus lapillis insignatus' (1621). These reiterated his rejection of the Gregorian calendar and attempted a more pragmatic version of his octodesexcentenarian one. His later manuscript works established rules for chronological enquiries, and eventually proposed a new solar calendar with the year beginning on 1 March and the Christian era with Christ's baptism, formerly dated to AD 29. Such efforts argued for the supremacy of reformed over Catholic religion, but Lydiat rejected any alignment with millenarian interests in dating Christ's second coming. 
In 1625 Lydiat's brother Richard fell into debt, a circumstance leading to the mortgage of Alkerton manor, and its sale in 1630. Thomas Lydiat incurred grave financial difficulties, and was imprisoned for debt continuously between 1627 and 1633 in Oxford and Southwark. An incomplete form of bail from Southwark prison for $700 dated 8 July 1630 is suggestive of the extent of his woes (Bodl. Oxf., Bodley MS 313, fol. 44). Financial relief and personal freedom were eventually obtained through the efforts of several scholars, including most notably Ussher and Laud, but also Sir William Boswell and Robert Pink, the warden of New College. According to Wood, John Selden declined to contribute to the cause because Lydiat had contradicted his 'Marmora Arundeliana' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 3.186). Lydiat's interest in ancient chronologies led him to petition the king during the 1630s for permission to travel to Turkey, Armenia, and Abyssinia but, unsurprisingly, given his credit history, these efforts met with no success. 
Lydiat was opposed to some of Laud's reforms, writing manuscripts on altars, bowing at the name of Jesus, and incense from prison in 1633 (BL, Harley MS 2405). He nevertheless counted many puritans among his friends and neighbours, including John Dod and Robert Cleaver, the ministers of Hanwell and Drayton, Oxfordshire, and Sir Anthony Cope, to whom he had dedicated his 'Defensio' in 1607. During the 1640s Lydiat sided with the royalists and continued to speak out in favour of episcopacy. In 1644 he wrote to Sir William Compton, governor of Banbury Castle, complaining that his house had been pillaged four times by parliamentary forces to the value of $70, and that he was twice carried off by soldiers, once to Warwick and once to Banbury; he signed himself the 'old and weak minister' of Alkerton (Bodl. Oxf., Bodley MS 313, fol. 82). His sufferings in the civil war and his passion for scholarship to the exclusion of his physical needs led Samuel Johnson to recall him in the verse: '
If dreams yet flatter, once again attend; 

Hear Lydiat's life and Galileo's end 
('The Vanity of Human Wishes', 1749, ll. 163-4)' Lydiat died at Alkerton on 3 April 1646, possibly as a result of an assault by soldiers. He was buried the following day in the chancel of Alkerton church, near his parents. His will left goods valued at $169. In 1669 the fellows of New College erected a monument over his grave, as well as a memorial in the college chapel. 
Lydiat's nephew Timothy Lydiat (1618-1663), also rector of Alkerton, may have inherited some of his manuscripts. By the 1670s they were in the possession of John Lamphire, and a part of this collection was published as 'Canones chronologici' (1675). Lamphire's nephew Dr William Coward presented fifteen manuscripts to the Bodleian in 1695. A manuscript of his treatise on the Arundel marbles survives at Trinity College, Dublin, and was published as 'Marmoreum chronicon Arundelianum cum annotationibus' in Humphrey Prideaux's 'Marmora Oxoniensia' (1676). Lydiat was described in his own century as 'the happy Inventor of a more accurat period' (Plot, 224) but soon faded into obscurity. Nevertheless, he represents both the breadth and integration of Renaissance scholarship and the peculiar focus of protestant polemic, for he drew together astronomical and chronological research with textual criticism, mathematical advances, and theological debate in order to comprehend time and space.

Lye, Edward (bap. 1694, d. 1767), Anglo-Saxon and Gothic scholar, was baptized at St Mary's, Totnes, Devon, on 6 September 1694, the ninth of twelve children of Thomas Lye ('bap'. 1655, died 1710/11), vicar of Broadhempston (instituted 4 May 1705) and schoolmaster of Totnes grammar school, and his wife, Katherine Johnson ('b'. 'c'.1660, died in or after 1736). He described his father to Thomas Percy as 'a good Classical Scholar... yet an indolent Schoolmaster' (Percy, fol. 258'r') who left his family poorly off. He first attended his father's school, but received little tuition there; later he attended a grammar school at Crewkerne, in Somerset, where he had family and where the master was a man of good reputation named Leaves. Although he suffered ill health during these years and was forced to spend some time at home his studies proceeded more surely than they had at Totnes. He was admitted a servitor of Hart Hall, Oxford, and matriculated from the university on 28 March 1713. He graduated BA on 19 October 1716 and MA on 6 July 1722, and was incorporated at Cambridge University in 1724. While at Hart Hall he won the friendship and patronage of the principal, Dr Richard Newton, and the vice-principal, his tutor John Davys, who was also, from 1719 to 1740, rector of Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire, seat of the earl of Northampton and one of the closest parishes to Little Houghton and Yardley Hastings, where Lye held successive livings. 
Lye was ordained deacon at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 17 March 1716 by Edmund Gibson, bishop of Lincoln and a noted Anglo-Saxonist, and priest on 20 September 1719 at Peterborough by White Kennett, another Saxonist. He spent a short time as a curate at Melchborne, in Bedfordshire, and was nearly a year in a second curacy at Orlingbury, Northamptonshire, before being presented to the vicarage of Little Houghton in the same county by a wealthy local patron, William Ward (instituted 13 October and inducted 3 December 1720). He resigned this position in 1749. On 6 October 1737 he was presented to the more lucrative rectory of Yardley Hastings by James, earl of Northampton, and inducted on 10 October. He never married and remained rector of Yardley Hastings for the rest of his life. Though based in rural Northamptonshire he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, comprising fellow scholars in Britain and Europe (especially in Sweden), fellow clergymen, and members of the nobility who were patrons of learning. From 1756 until his death he was mentor and friend of Thomas Percy, vicar of the neighbouring parish of Easton Maudit, and helped him with several of his publications, including 'Reliques of Ancient English Poetry' (1765). 
Between about 1730 and his first published work, an edition of Franciscus Junius's manuscript etymological dictionary of the English language, 'Etymologicum Anglicanum' (1743), Lye set himself the task of learning Old English and Gothic, together with something of the other early Germanic languages, and, he confided to Thomas Hearne in a letter of 1732, 'I have a mind to turn Editor' (E. Lye to T. Hearne, 9 June 1732, Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. lett. 7, fol. 320'r'). This he did, adding material of his own and a short Old English grammar to Junius's Bodleian manuscript dictionary. This handsome publication was supported by James Compton, fifth earl of Northampton, and printed at the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford. Lye also turned his attention to Gothic and by late 1732 he had 'read over the Gothick Gospels... and drawn up a Grammar of that Language', as he tells Hearne (Lye to Hearne, n.d. [1732], Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. lett. 7, fol. 321'r'). Thus when in the late 1730s the Swedish Archbishop Eric Benzelius the younger (1675-1743) was seeking someone to complete and publish his edition of the 'Codex Argenteus' of the Gothic gospels in Uppsala University Library his English contacts, including Sir Hans Sloane and Lord Granville, informed him that Lye was the natural choice. Benzelius's edition, with preface, additions, and a Gothic grammar by Lye, was published by the University of Oxford in 1750. In January of the same year Lye was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. 
Lye died at the rectory, Yardley Hastings, of gout, from which he had suffered for many years, on 19 August 1767, aged seventy-three. He was buried on 21 August 1767 in St Andrew's, the parish church, where there is a plain grave slab to his memory in the chancel floor, to the right of the altar, with a memorial inscription composed by his friend Thomas Hunt, professor of Hebrew at Oxford. It speaks of his character as a man of simplicity, openness, and probity, yet one of great erudition and outstanding knowledge in the fields of Northern languages and antiquities. 
Lye's reputation as a scholar of Anglo-Saxon and Gothic was high in his own day, both in Britain and in Europe, but became obscured by early nineteenth-century philologists like J. M. Kemble and Joseph Bosworth, who were keen to make a distinction between their own, German-influenced scholarship and that of their predecessors. Yet after the high point in Anglo-Saxon scholarship established by George Hickes, Humfrey Wanley, and their colleagues in the early eighteenth century Lye was the only significant scholar in this field before the nineteenth-century philologists, and they used his work as the basis for their own. This is particularly true in the area of lexicography: Lye's posthumously published 'Dictionarium Saxonico et Gothico-Latinum' (1772), which was completed by his friend Owen Manning, was the material basis upon which Bosworth constructed his Anglo-Saxon dictionary (1838), and this formed the foundation for T. Northcote Toller's enlarged 'Anglo-Saxon Dictionary' of 1898. Lye and Manning added significantly to the vocabulary of Old English prose and poetry, and their work greatly assisted early nineteenth-century editors. One poetic project that Lye worked on with Oxford colleagues, but which was never published for lack of funding, was an edition, with illustrations and a Latin translation (Lye's contribution), of the Junius manuscript of Old English poetry (Bodl. Oxf., MS Junius 11). Lye's translation was inherited after his death by Thomas Percy and burnt in a fire at Northumberland House in 1780.

Lye, Thomas (1621-1684), nonconformist minister, was born on 25 March 1621, the son of Thomas Leigh of Chard in Somerset. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 4 November 1636, was elected scholar on 6 October 1637, and graduated BA on 25 May 1641. He then migrated to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was elected fellow and proceeded MA in 1646. He was headmaster of Bury St Edmunds School for a short time in 1647, and was incorporated MA of Oxford on 8 May 1649. He appears not to have been chaplain of Wadham College, as Wood claims, but was vicar of Chard when signing the attestation of Somerset ministers in 1648. 
In 1651 Lye ran into trouble at the hands of Colonel John Pyne (1600-1678), a powerful man in Somerset. On 4 August the council of state wrote requiring that Lye be required to take the engagement to the Commonwealth or face banishment from the town and its surrounding area and debarment from preaching in Somerset; on 24 August, apparently resigned to his fate, he preached a farewell sermon to his parishioners. But on 18 November the council, 'being now satisfied of Mr Lye, takes off their said order, and leaves Lye at liberty to preach at Chard or any other place' ordering that 'this be signified to Colonel Pyne' ('CSP dom.', '1651-2', 21). In 1654 Lye's official rehabilitation was complete: he was named as an assistant to the Somerset commission for the ejection of scandalous ministers. In 1658 he was invited by the parishioners to the charge of All Hallows, Lombard Street, London, and was admitted on 27 October. He was named as a commissioner for the approbation of ministers under the act of 14 March 1660. Lye married twice. His first wife, Rebecca, in her will, left property at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk; the will was proved on 16 February 1658. His second wife, Sarah, was buried at Clapham on 28 September 1678. 
In November 1660 Lye and other London ministers wrote thanking the king for his gracious concessions concerning ecclesiastical affairs, but he was ejected from All Hallows in 1662 by the 'Act of Uniformity'. It was reported in 1665 that, though lately in Scotland, he now kept a school at Clapham in Surrey. In 1669 he was said to be preaching at Morgan's Lane, Southwark. Wood recorded that 'he usually held forth in conventicles with Dr Henry Wilkinson... and William Bridge' of Yarmouth (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 4.134). On 30 April 1672 Lye was licensed as a presbyterian teacher at his house in Clapham, where he continued to teach children for many years. In this role he is said to have been popular and successful, and issued his 'Plain and familiar method of instructing the younger sort according to the lesser catechism of the assembly of divines' in 1673. Edmund Calamy the younger was taken to Dyers' Hall (aged about four) by his mother to be catechized by 'good old Mr. Thomas Lye... she having been herself catechised by him in her younger years' (Calamy, 'Historical Account', 1.73). On 1 January 1678 Ralph Thoresby, then in London, was 'At the Fast all day. Mr Lye prayed and preached very well... showing that examination is everyone's duty' ('Diary', 1.9). On 18 April 1683 Lye was presented at the Guildhall for holding conventicles, and may have been imprisoned. One of his former pupils recalled in a lawsuit, 'Attorney-General v. Hewer' (1700), that Lye often attended service at the parish church before preaching in his own house, that he gave up schoolteaching after being imprisoned in the Marshalsea, and that he used to go to town on Saturday nights in order to preach at a conventicle the following day. This was probably the congregation Lye had gathered which met at Dyers' Hall, Thames Street. He died at Bethnal Green on 7 June 1684, and was buried four days later at Clapham; two unmarried daughters, Sarah and Mary, survived him.

Lyell, Charles (1769-1849), botanist and literary scholar, was born on 7 March 1769 at Southampton Buildings, Holborn, London, the eldest son of Charles Lyell (1734-1796), naval officer, and Mary Beale (died 1813). After attending St Paul's School, London, he was educated at St Andrews University and at Peterhouse, Cambridge. Destined for a legal career, he was entered at Lincoln's Inn in 1788 but did not go there before taking his Cambridge degree in 1791 (he proceeded MA in 1794). His legal studies were interspersed with continental travel until 1796 when he abandoned the law on inheriting the Scottish estate of Kinnordy, Kirriemuir, Forfarshire. In the same year on 4 October he married Frances Smith (1773/4-1850), with whom he raised three sons and seven daughters. 
In 1798 Lyell leased Bartley Lodge in the New Forest, which became the family home until 1826. Here he developed an interest in cryptogamic botany, collecting lichens and mosses in particular, and corresponding with leading botanists. He did not publish, but many of his finds were described in James Sowerby and James Edward Smith's 'English Botany' as well as in specialist monographs. Several species bear his name, besides the genus 'Lyellia' of Robert Brown. 
In 1813 he became a fellow of the Linnean Society. From 1826 he lived permanently at Kinnordy House, and, in addition to botany, began to study Dante's poetry, eventually publishing some translations, initially at his own expense. He built up an impressive herbarium and a valuable library. 
Lyell took great interest in the intellectual development of his eldest son, Charles Lyell (1797-1875), but, as a staunch tory for whom science was a gentlemanly attainment, was initially alarmed by his son's wish to abandon law in favour of establishing a career in science. More conventionally, his younger sons, Henry and Thomas, entered the army and navy respectively. Lyell died from influenza at Kinnordy House on 8 November 1849, while serving as vice-lieutenant of Forfarshire. He left the debt-ridden estate of Kinnordy in trust to his eight surviving children, thus disinheriting Charles as principal heir and new laird of Kinnordy.

Lyell, Sir Charles, first baronet (1797-1875), geologist, was born at Kinnordy House, Kirriemuir, Forfarshire, on 14 November 1797, the eldest son of Charles Lyell (1769-1849) and Frances Smith (1773/4-1850). A few months later his parents left the family estate and moved to the south of England, renting Bartley Lodge near Lyndhurst, Hampshire. 
Lyell was educated at private schools, latterly in Midhurst, Sussex. As a boy living in the New Forest, he developed an enthusiasm for natural history; as an undergraduate at Oxford, those interests focused on geology. He entered Exeter College as a fellow-commoner in 1816, and attended the lectures on mineralogy and geology by William Buckland in three successive years. Geology, in his father's opinion, was at least 'rational and gentlemanlike' (Wilson, 'Charles Lyell', 44), even if it distracted his son from more serious studies. However, Lyell graduated BA in 1819 with a respectable second class in classical honours (MA in 1821), and entered Lincoln's Inn to prepare for a legal career. As an aspiring young man of science he also joined the Geological and Linnean societies; Buckland was one of those who proposed him for the former. 
While still an undergraduate Lyell had begun to look at the world with a geologist's eyes, but his serious research dates from 1821, after he met Gideon Mantell. Lyell worked on correlating Mantell's 'Secondary' formations in Sussex with those further west. He also studied in Hampshire the still younger 'Tertiary' formations, above the distinctive Chalk: Thomas Webster had claimed that those in the Isle of Wight were similar to those that Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) and Alexandre Brongniart (1770-1847) had famously described around Paris. In short, Lyell worked on the kind of geology (later termed stratigraphy) on which the leading members of the Geological Society were then engaged. 
Lyell was called to the bar in 1822, but geology was becoming more important to him than the law. In 1823 he was elected a secretary of the Geological Society of London, and he spent that summer in Paris, making himself known in scientific circles and improving his command of the then premier language of science. He met established figures such as Cuvier and Brongniart, and the latter's former student Constant Prevost (1787-1856) showed him the formations of the Paris basin. Conversely, Lyell explained to the French geologists the field evidence for the sudden 'geological deluge' that Buckland, following Cuvier, had recently invoked to account for the puzzling 'diluvial' deposits in England. 
However, Prevost convinced Lyell that the Parisian formations could have been deposited under conditions similar to those in present seas and lakes, and that Cuvier and Brongniart had been too quick to dismiss such close analogies: the rocks might be due to 'actual' or 'modern causes', or processes observably active in the present world. In the summer of 1824, after taking Prevost on a tour of southern England, Lyell followed his lead. Staying at Kinnordy, he studied the sediments deposited in a small lake that had recently been drained. In his first scientific paper, read at the Geological Society that winter, he claimed that those modern lake deposits were closely similar to some of the Parisian rocks, so that there was no sharp contrast between the 'former world' and the present. This paper was the model for all Lyell's later work in geology: modern causes were, he claimed, adequate to explain all the traces of the remote past. 
By 1825 Lyell's father was evidently displeased at his son's failure to establish himself in a successful legal career, and in 1826 Lyell did spend more time on legal work in London and in the west of England; however, it was in that year that his parents moved back to Kinnordy, so that the paternal presence became more remote. Lyell resigned as secretary of the Geological Society, but was promptly appointed foreign secretary instead; he was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Having joined the new Athenaeum in 1824, he was becoming known in intellectual circles well beyond those of the geologists. In 1825 John Murray invited him to write for the tory 'Quarterly Review', despite his known whig sympathies; this offered Lyell a much-needed new source of income to supplement his modest allowance. He used his essays with gentlemanly tact to advocate among leading tories the cause of moderate reform: he criticized the lack of government support for the sciences, and the unreformed state of the ancient universities; in particular, he criticized the clerical domination of higher education in England. 
In 1826 an essay in the 'Quarterly Review' on the Geological Society's publications enabled Lyell to promote his favourite science, and he praised the society for having replaced the earlier vogue for speculative theorizing with an emphasis on careful observation. Lyell accepted the common view that more complex living organisms had appeared on earth in the course of time, as the earth had slowly cooled, but he also argued that modern causes might account for far more than most geologists allowed; in this respect his views were now diverging from those of Buckland and others at the Geological Society. He began to plan an introductory book that would expound his emerging conception of the science: geology would only become scientific, he believed, if it were based on modern causes, because they alone could be witnessed directly and therefore be known to be 'true causes' ('verae causae'). 
In 1827, while working as a barrister on the western circuit, Lyell read and was fascinated by the evolutionary speculations of Jean Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829), realizing that the mutability of species -- if established -- would affect geology as much as the sciences of life. But Lyell recoiled from the implications of Lamarck's ideas for the dignity of man, and he saw that the fossil evidence for progression in the history of life could easily be turned into an argument for evolution. He began to claim by contrast that the fossil record was by its nature too imperfect to support that notion, and that the physical world was a stable balanced system like that advocated earlier by James Hutton and John Playfair. 
Lyell's essays for the 'Quarterly' culminated in 1827 in a long review of a new book on French geology by his friend George Scrope. Lyell agreed with Scrope that 'Time! Time! Time!' was needed in geological explanation, and that there had been no abrupt catastrophe in the geologically recent past; the book suggested to him that the 'lost links in the great chain that unites the present with the past' ('Quarterly Review', 36, 1827, 443) might still be preserved in Auvergne. In 1828 he joined Roderick Murchison for a fieldwork tour on the continent, and after discussions with Prevost and other Parisians they went straight to Auvergne. Lyell was duly impressed by Scrope's evidence and agreed with his conclusions. Later, in Italy, Lyell developed a rough timescale for the most recent era of the earth's history, as represented by the Tertiary formations. He used the expertise of local naturalists to count the number of fossil species that were known to be still living in present seas, inferring that the percentage would be inversely proportional to the age of each formation. This assumed that new species had somehow appeared, and older ones become extinct, at roughly constant rates, uninterrupted by any catastrophic events. The probabilistic basis of this idea is likely to have been derived from contemporary debates in political economy; certainly Lyell expounded it later in terms of an analogy with changing human populations. 
As he travelled alone through Italy into Sicily (Murchison and his wife had returned to England), Lyell believed his hypothesis was confirmed. In the vicinity of active volcanoes such as Vesuvius and Etna, he found putatively recent formations (with a high percentage of extant species) far above sea level, just as he expected if crustal elevation were causally linked to volcanic activity. In Sicily thick formations of this kind underlay the huge cone of Etna, which in turn appeared to be extremely ancient in relation to human records of its more recent eruptions. In effect, Etna and the recent formations beneath it linked Lyell's geological timescale to the timescale of human history, confirming Scrope's inference about the vast time available for modern causes to have had their effects. After leaving Sicily early in 1829 Lyell reported to Murchison how his forthcoming book would expound the true principles of geology: modern causes, acting at their present intensities, were adequate to explain all the observed traces of the remote past. In Paris, on his way back to England, he found that Gerard Deshayes (1797-1875), an expert on fossil molluscs, had pre-empted his ideas on the Tertiary formations; but Lyell turned this to his advantage by paying Deshayes to identify all his fossils and to integrate the results into Deshayes's much wider survey. Back in London, Lyell expounded his views at the Geological Society, and revised his earlier drafts into a far more ambitious publication. 
The first volume of Lyell's 'Principles of Geology' was published by Murray in July 1830. Its ambitions were clear from the title -- 'Principles' still recalled Isaac Newton's 'Principia' -- and the subtitle stated clearly that it was 'an attempt to explain the former changes of the earth's surface, by reference to causes now in operation'. Surprisingly for a work on geology, the volume was devoted not to the remote past but wholly to the present world. Lyell gave a systematic description of modern causes such as volcanoes and earthquakes, sedimentation and erosion, culled from a wide range of sources, including many accounts of voyages and expeditions to remote parts of the globe; however, his main source was the great compilation of the physical and topographical changes recorded within human history, published in 1822-4 by Karl von Hoff (1771-1837) -- Lyell had learned German specifically in order to read it. He used Hoff's data to illustrate his own view of the earth as a system of balanced antagonistic processes: erosion balanced by sedimentation, for example, and crustal elevation by crustal subsidence. A preliminary section of the book presented a 'grand new theory of climate' (Lyell, 'Life', 1.261), which interpreted long-term climatic changes as the products of an ever-changing physical geography: this neatly undercut what Lyell himself had earlier regarded as conclusive evidence for a slowly cooling earth. 
The volume began, however, with a forceful criticism of other geologists, thinly disguised as a history of geology itself. Lyell presented the history of the science as a long battle between views similar to his own, and those that arbitrarily invoked catastrophes at every turn; his own emphasis on the 'uniformity' of nature was treated as synonymous with being truly scientific. Furthermore, Lyell virtually equated his opponents with the many authors who were claiming scriptural authority for limiting the timescale of the earth's history to a few thousand years. In effect, geologists such as Buckland, who did indeed identify the 'geological deluge' as the biblical flood, but who assumed unlimited time for the still earlier history of the earth, were treated by Lyell as no better than the 'scriptural' writers -- despite the fact that it was Buckland who had urged Lyell to use his review of Scrope as an opportunity to attack the literalists. 
In effect, Lyell was fighting on two fronts: against most other geologists, who doubted the total adequacy of modern causes for understanding the past; and against much wider social groups, who still treated the biblical narratives of creation and the flood as literal history, untouched by the biblical criticism taken for granted on the continent. Lyell wanted not only to make geology truly scientific, but also, as he put it privately, 'to free the science from Moses' (Lyell, 'Life', 1.268). That wider aim accounts for the great interest and attention that the 'Principles' received immediately, at least in Britain, not only among men of science but also among the general educated public. The more scientific reviews were mixed: Lyell's claim that the power of modern causes had been underestimated was found important and even persuasive, but his criticisms of other geologists were regarded as grossly unfair; above all, his scepticism about organic progression was considered utterly unconvincing. 
In 1831 Lyell was appointed professor of geology at the new King's College in London. Among the clergymen on its governing body, Edward Copleston was worried by Lyell's opinions on the creation of man and the flood, but the rest were not. Lyell lectured at King's in 1832 and 1833; in the latter year he gave similar lectures at the Royal Institution, to which women were admitted, thus swelling his audience and his fees. But Lyell found this work brought him too little income to justify the distraction from his writing, and he resigned from King's and gave no further courses at the Royal Institution. 
Lyell had spent the summer of 1831 on fieldwork in Germany; while there he had met the 23-year-old Mary Horner, eldest daughter of the whig reformer and geologist Leonard Horner. They were married in Bonn on 12 July 1832; after a geological honeymoon, they settled in Hart Street, Bloomsbury, close to the British Museum and to the Geological Society's premises in Somerset House. Mary was well educated, and fluent in French and German, and was soon helping Lyell with translation, and offsetting his handicap of poor eyesight for reading. However, she seems to have been somewhat excluded from the scientific conversation at their dinner parties. A few years later, after one such occasion, Charles Darwin -- himself soon to be married -- commented tartly, 'I want 'practice' in ill treating the female sex -- I did not observe Lyell had any compunction' ('Correspondence', 2.166). When, a little later, Emma Darwin gave their first dinner party, she recorded that 'Mr Lyell is enough to flatten a party, as he never speaks above his breath, so that everybody keeps lowering their tone to his' (Wilson, 'Charles Lyell', 459). There were no children of the Lyells' marriage. 
The second volume of the 'Principles' appeared in 1832; it dealt with modern causes in the organic realm, and particularly with the relation between organisms and their environments. Lyell rejected Lamarck's theory of the incessant mutability of species, arguing instead that they were real stable entities, and that they appeared and became extinct in a piecemeal manner in time and space. Extinctions were attributed not to sudden catastrophes but to gradual changes in the environment, as expounded in the first volume; the origins of species were attributed implicitly to some equally natural process as yet unknown. In an incisive review of this volume, William Whewell coined the terms 'uniformitarian' and 'catastrophist' for two opposing sects among geologists, but at the time there were few if any full-blooded uniformitarians apart from Lyell himself. 
Lyell's concept of the stability of individual species validated his timescale for the Tertiary era, which formed a cornerstone of the third and culminating volume of the 'Principles' (1833). His review of modern causes, both inorganic and organic, had merely provided the 'alphabet and grammar' of geology ('Principles of Geology', 3.7); they were the means by which nature's historical records could be deciphered, in order to reconstruct the course of earth history. Lyell used Deshayes's massive lists of fossil species to arrange the Tertiary formations in inferred chronological order. Based on the increasing proportions of 'recent' species, Whewell proposed to Lyell the Greek-based names 'Eocene', 'Miocene', and 'Pliocene'; Lyell split the last into 'Older' and 'Newer' parts, thus defining four successive periods of Tertiary time. He reviewed the evidence for the state of the earth during each period in turn, beginning nearest to the directly observable present and working backwards into the more obscure past. He claimed that the whole Tertiary era of earth history proved the earth's essential uniformity through time; the still older formations were discussed much more briefly. The alleged evidence for radically different conditions in the earliest era of all was eliminated by Lyell's concept of 'metamorphism' -- deep burial in the earth's crust had altered the oldest rocks beyond recognition and destroyed their fossils, and they were not really 'Primary' at all. Lyell therefore concluded that Hutton had been right to argue that the earth showed no signs of a beginning or an end to its stability, although he denied that this implied that the natural world was eternal or uncreated. 
By the time the last volume of 'Principles' was published, Lyell had already produced second editions of the first two. Cheaper editions of the whole work followed in 1834, 1835, and 1837, each revising his argument in the light of critical reviews and new publications. In 1834 Lyell travelled in Scandinavia, and became convinced that the land around the Baltic had indeed risen insensibly slowly and without earthquakes, even within recorded history. He presented this work -- a fine example of his claims about modern causes -- as his Bakerian lecture at the Royal Society later in 1834; at the same time he was awarded the society's royal medal, but explicitly for his work on modern causes and their application to the Tertiary formations, rather than for his more controversial claims. The citation reflected the balance of opinion among leading geologists; even Prevost and Scrope, Lyell's strong supporters on the power of modern causes and the redundancy of catastrophes, criticized their friend's rejection of a broadly directional history for the earth. Other critics pointed to Lyell's apparent inconsistency, in conceding that the human species was very recent while denying all other signs of organic progression. So when Darwin, who had read the 'Principles' on his voyage round the world, settled in London in 1836 and proved to have closely similar geological ideas, Lyell soon treated his younger colleague as his closest ally. 
Lyell served as president of the Geological Society in 1835-7, and used his anniversary addresses to evaluate current research in the light of his own approach to the science. His emphasis on modern causes made steady headway among geologists, but other aspects of his work did not. His percentage timescale, for example, was criticized by those with more expert knowledge of Tertiary fossils: the names for the Tertiary periods survived, but Lyell was forced to weaken their statistical basis, until his use of fossils was almost indistinguishable from that of other geologists. The mixed reception of his ideas was reflected in his decision to divide his work into two distinct parts: from the sixth edition (1840) onwards, the 'Principles' became purely a treatise on modern causes and their balanced interactions. Lyell planned a separate book on the use of fossil molluscs in Tertiary geology, but such a work never appeared. 
Lyell did return to his original plan for a book that would explain his conception of geology at an introductory level, and thereby propagate it more widely. 'Elements of Geology' (1838) reviewed the whole stratigraphical record, from the most recent formations back to the most ancient, interpreting it in terms of the 'uniformity' of terrestrial processes through time. The second edition (1841) was greatly expanded, incorporating the treatment of the Tertiary formations that had now been excised from the 'Principles'. Both 'Elements' and 'Principles' were successful and popular works, as their publishing history shows. Appropriately for a barrister, Lyell wrote stylishly and persuasively, and explained technicalities clearly; his books reached a wide audience of the educated public, far beyond those who were actively engaged in geology. French and German translations, and American editions, made his approach well known throughout the scientific world. 
In 1841-2 Lyell was invited to the United States and gave the Lowell lectures to a vast audience in Boston. He and his wife also travelled widely, and two volumes of 'Travels in North America' (1845) recorded not only his geological observations, but also their opinions on the country's social and political problems: those opinions were liberal in respect to education, less so in the matter of slavery. They revisited America in 1845-6 and he gave the Lowell lectures again; two further volumes about their travels appeared in 1849. In 1846, on their return from America, they moved to a grander house in Harley Street. By this time Lyell had become a prominent man of science, an adviser to government on scientific issues, and an associate of Prince Albert. He was knighted in 1848, and served on the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He made two further visits to America in 1852 and 1853, on the latter occasion representing the 1851 commissioners at the Industrial Exhibition in New York. 
The successive editions of Lyell's books were kept up to date with the latest research, but their underlying ideas changed little. When he served a second term as president of the Geological Society in 1849-51 he again criticized the supposed fossil evidence for organic progression and still defended his earlier interpretation of the earth's history, although both positions had become increasingly implausible to other geologists. Lyell's last major research project was related to the resurgent theory of 'craters of elevation', by which the largest volcanic cones were attributed to sudden crustal elevation rather than to the slow accumulation of volcanic materials in successive eruptions. During the winter of 1853-4 he countered this serious challenge with field observations on Madeira and the Canary Islands; in 1857 and 1858 he went to look again at Etna; and he persuaded Scrope to return to geology and support his case with evidence from Auvergne. 
The Canaries and Madeira also brought the puzzles of endemic island faunas and floras back to Lyell's attention, and in private he wrestled once more with the possibility of an evolutionary mechanism for the origin of species. When in 1856 Darwin told him about his theory, Lyell urged him to publish it without delay, and then struggled with its implications not only for his geology but also for his view of human life. By this time he had almost abandoned his earlier nominal allegiance to the liberal wing of the Church of England; he had become 'de facto' a Unitarian after seeing the role of that denomination in America. But even unitarian theology left him with acute problems about the dignity of man, if the human species had evolved from primates. 
Two events in 1859 led to Lyell's last major publication, 'Antiquity of Man' (1863). One was the research by other geologists that finally established that early human beings had lived alongside the mammoths and other extinct mammals of the glacial period, known by this time by Lyell's name, 'Pleistocene' (formerly his 'Newer' Pliocene). This locked the human species firmly into earth history, by extending human history far beyond the reach of textual records into a prehistory recorded only in fossil bones and stone artefacts. The bulk of Lyell's book was devoted to a rather derivative account of this research. The other event in 1859 was Darwin's publication of his 'Origin of Species'. Lyell reviewed the evidence for evolution quite favourably -- in a section added awkwardly on to his book on prehistory -- but Darwin was disappointed that his old mentor failed to announce clearly his own acceptance of the theory. Only in the next (tenth) edition of the 'Principles' (1867-8) did Lyell give qualified approval to evolution as the true mechanism for the origin of new species, which he had left so vague thirty years earlier; the book was enlarged and recast to accommodate the change. But Lyell also had to alter his entire perspective on the history of life, finally conceding that successively higher forms of life had been formed in the course of time. He even allowed that the human species was no exception, at least in its physical aspects; but he remained sceptical about the adequacy of Darwin's theory to account for the origin of the mental and moral aspects that were most distinctively human. 
Lyell had been active in the British Association since its early years, and at the meeting in Bath in 1864 he served as its president. He was created a baronet the same year, and in 1866 he received -- belatedly -- the Wollaston medal, the Geological Society's highest award. The 'Elements' reached in effect its eighth edition in 1873 (it had been called a 'Manual' since 1851, and the last two editions were called 'Student's Elements'); the 'Principles' was published, just posthumously, in a twelfth edition in 1875. Mary Lyell died on 24 April 1873, and Lyell himself less than two years later, on 22 February 1875, at their London home at 73 Harley Street. Like other leading Victorian men of science, he was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Lyford, William (1597?-1653), Church of England clergyman and author, was born at Peasemore, near Newbury, Berkshire, one of at least five children of William Lyford (died 1631/2), the rector there. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 28 April 1615, aged seventeen, became a demy of Magdalen College in 1617, and graduated BA on 15 December 1618. A fellow from 1620, he proceeded MA on 14 June 1621, was ordained, and in 1624 also became a fellow of Pembroke College. 
In 1630 Lyford published, as 'The Tryall of a Christians Syncere Love unto Christ', a posthumous edition of sermons by his Magdalen contemporary William Pinke ('c'.1599-1629), a trenchantly anti-Catholic work which he dedicated to Pinke's former student George Digby. Having obtained his BD degree on 12 May 1631, on 5 July he supplicated for a licence to preach. In 1632, following the death of his father, Lyford became rector of his home parish of Peasemore (a living occupied by 1637 by his younger brother Edward ('b'. 1605/6)); however, it seems to have been his institution in 1631 or 1632 to the Dorset vicarage of Sherborne, on the presentation of the king and at the suggestion of George Digby's father, John Digby, earl of Bristol, that led him in 1633 to resign his Magdalen fellowship. Soon afterwards he married his wife, Elizabeth, who outlived him. 
Lyford published in 1642 the first edition of his 'Principles of Faith and Good Conscience', a catechism designed as a three-year course of preparation for communion, with a chapter for each week and some repetition 'of purpose better to root those main points in weak understandings' (A4); this was subsequently abridged for young people (1649, 1656). On 23 October the following year he was cited by the House of Commons to attend the Westminster assembly, of which he was nominally a member, but he did not sit. According to Richard Baxter, he believed that parliamentarians had acted unlawfully in going to war against the king, and John Walker assumed he was a royalist, but there is no evidence that Lyford attracted parliament's disapproval: he received an augmentation of his stipend from the county committee and in 1647 was one of the committee of triers of ministers. On 12 December that year he preached at St Mary's, Oxford, a traditional Calvinist exposition of the regeneration and sanctification of the elect, published as 'The Translation of the Sinner from Death to Life' (1648). 
From 1647, according to his own later account, in the wake of 'The Testimonie of the London Ministers', Lyford became involved in the controversy over toleration, drawing up 'exercises' to encourage his 'people' not to 'condemn all things in the Lump, but bee able to discern things that differ' (Lyford, dedication). In a sermon preached before the sheriff, Sir Gerard Napper, at Dorchester assizes on 17 July 1651 and published posthumously as 'The matching of the magistrates authority and the Christians true liberty in matters of religion' (1654), Lyford steered what he hoped was a moderate and sober course between the magistrate's duty to promote preaching and restrain idolatry and the people's liberty not to be forced into a particular act of worship. He also eschewed extremes in 'An Apologie for our Publick Ministerie and Infant Baptism' (1652), dedicated to John Raymond, and in his last 'Three Sermons Preached at Sherborne' (1654), but despite acknowledging the roles of faithful 'private Christians' and even of unordained preachers in being 'a just rebuke to a rotten, formal, dead Clergie' (ibid., 22), both works are trenchant defences of an ordained and publicly maintained ministry. 
Lyford died at Sherborne on 3 October 1653 and was buried in the chancel of his church. An address given by 'W. H.' at his funeral was reproduced in an edition of his 'The Plain Mans Senses Exercised' (1655), a lengthy further contribution to the toleration controversy. By his will dated 2 September 1653 Lyford left money and land in Dorset, Berkshire, and Hampshire to his son William and seven daughters, and $120 for an exhibition for a poor scholar at Magdalen College, 'by way of thankfullnes for [God's] mercy to me in that Colledge, and in way of Restitution for a summ of money which according to the corrupt custome of those daies I did receave for the Resignation of my fellowship' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/239, fol. 385). William Lyford the younger (died 1678) had matriculated at Magdalen the previous November, and it was in his study there that on 22 October 1653 he wrote the dedication to his father's 'The Matching of the Magistrate's Authority'.

Lygon, Frederick, sixth Earl Beauchamp (1830-1891), Church of England layman and politician, was born on 10 November 1830, the third son of Henry, fourth Earl Beauchamp (1784-1863), and Lady Susan Caroline Eliot (1801-1835), daughter of William, second earl of St Germans. 
The Lygon family was settled at Madresfield, Worcestershire, from the mid-fifteenth century, and was connected with the Beauchamp family through Richard Lygon, who married Anne, daughter of Richard Beauchamp, second and last Baron Beauchamp of Powick (died 1503). William Lygon, seventh in descent from Anne, died in 1720, leaving a daughter Margaret, who married as her first husband Reginald Pyndar, and by him was mother of Reginald Pyndar, who assumed the surname of Lygon. He died in 1788, having married Susannah, daughter of William Hanmer, and was father of 
Frederick Lygon was educated at Eton College (1844-7), and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 15 December 1848. He graduated BA in 1852 and was a fellow of All Souls College during 1852-66. As an undergraduate he adopted Tractarian views and formed a lifelong friendship with Henry Parry Liddon. He resisted an attempt by Edward Howard to convert him to the Roman church, but hoped for some kind of inter-communion between Rome and Canterbury. He did not take Anglican orders, but instead became 'the ecclesiastical layman par excellence' (Chadwick, 2.365), representing the high-church party on committees and commissions, and contributing assiduously to journals and newspapers. As a religious author his most influential work was 'The day hours of the Church of England, newly transcribed and arranged according to the prayer book and the Authorised Version of the Bible', published anonymously in 1858. It was generally adopted as an office book by the Anglican communities, and remained in widespread use until recent years (private information). 
From 1857 Lygon also developed a parliamentary career, speaking frequently in the Commons and later in the Lords, although he was always a churchman first and a politician second. From March 1857 to April 1863 he sat as a Conservative for Tewkesbury, briefly holding office as a lord of the Admiralty in March 1859. In 1863, on the death of his father, he succeeded his elder brother Henry as MP for West Worcestershire, a seat he held until he himself became sixth Earl Beauchamp in March 1866. Like his brother before him he was a friend of Benjamin Disraeli, for whom he wrote speeches on church questions and whose second administration he joined, as lord steward, in 1874. Later he served under Salisbury as paymaster of the forces from June 1885 until January 1886, and again from August 1886 until July 1887. 
On inheriting the Beauchamp estates in 1866 one of his first tasks had been to complete the reconstruction of Madresfield Court begun by the fifth earl, including the provision of a chapel (the remarkable decoration of which was to be the work of the next generation). In February 1868 he married Lady Mary Catherine Stanhope ('b'. 1844), daughter of Philip Henry Stanhope, fifth Earl Stanhope (1805-1875), who died in 1876 having had five children, the eldest of whom, William Lygon (1872-1938), was to become the seventh Earl Beauchamp. Two years later, on 24 September 1878, he married Lady Emily Annora Charlotte Pierrepont (1853-1935), daughter of the third Earl Manvers, with whom he had a further four children. His role as a conscientious Victorian landlord, combined with his enthusiasm for education and ecclesiastical architecture, resulted in the building of schools and chapels on his properties. He was involved locally in the foundation of Malvern College and the Alice Ottley School for Girls, Worcester, and at Oxford in the early years of Keble College and later in the establishment of Pusey House. He was made lord lieutenant of Worcestershire in 1876. 
Born to a somewhat elderly father, and losing his mother at the age of five, Frederick was perhaps a rather reserved and lonely figure as a young man. Later he acquired a more worldly exterior, being remembered by Archbishop Benson as 'brusque' and 'a very smart, bright man' (GEC, 'Peerage'). He had a love of music, and was a founder member of the St Cecilia Society: an early publication was a hymnal for Madresfield church in 1853. He was an FSA and a member of the Roxburghe Club, for which he edited the 'Liber regalis' in 1870. He died on 19 February 1891 at Madresfield Court and was buried at Madresfield, characteristically leaving instructions that no tomb or monument was to be erected in his memory.

William Lygon, first Earl Beauchamp (1747-1816). The first earl, born on 25 July 1747, matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 2 May 1764. He represented the county of Worcester in parliament from 1775, as a follower of Pitt from 1783 until 1806, when he was created Baron Beauchamp of Powyk, Worcestershire. At his father's death in 1788 he had succeeded to estates in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire, and Gloucestershire. These were the patrimony of no more than a well-to-do squire, but in 1798 he inherited part of the vast personal wealth of William Jennens, a kinsman of his mother, enabling him considerably to increase his Worcestershire property and influence. On 1 December 1815 he was made Viscount Elmley and Earl Beauchamp. He died suddenly at his house in St James's Square, London, on 21 October 1816. He had married, on 1 November 1780, Catharine, daughter of James Denn, and their children included William Beauchamp, John Reginald, and Henry Beauchamp, successively second, third, and fourth earls. His widow, a formidable businesswoman and a discriminating collector, survived until 1844, outliving her eldest son, who died in 1823.

Lyhert, Walter (d. 1472), bishop of Norwich, was from Lanteglos by Fowey in Cornwall. His only known kinsman ('cognatus') is John Lyhert, who predeceased him and was a co-beneficiary of the bishop's own chantry. Once Lyhert became a bishop, he always acted as proctor in parliament for Edmund Lacy, bishop of Exeter, for many years an invalid. A hospital in Plymouth, Devon, received 10 marks ($6 13's'. 4died) in Lyhert's will. There is no evidence of any kinship with the Norwich family of his name. 
Lyhert was admitted as sophist and fellow to Exeter College, Oxford, 'c'.1420, and had graduated BA from there by 1425. Equally important, he formed an association there with John Halse of Kenedon, Devon, with whom he remained friends until death. Lyhert was a fellow of Oriel College from 1425 to 1427. Having achieved the degree of MA he received that of BTh in 1441, but was awarded the degree of DTh only after his episcopal promotion. On 1 June 1435 he was elected provost of Oriel, and retained the office until 1446, when Halse succeeded him. 
Lyhert had been ordained subdeacon in April 1427, deacon in July, and priest on 20 September, doubtless in connection with his admission to the rectory of Lamarsh, Essex, on 7 October that year. A series of exchanges of benefice followed. On 24 February 1441 he was presented by the crown to the rectory of Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, perhaps showing that he had begun to attract influential notice. It remains a mystery none the less exactly how he secured the patronage he now did. On 10 February 1444, as a 'king's clerk and chaplain', he was granted the wardenship of St Anthony's Hospital in London, a significant preferment. And by 1445 he had become chaplain to William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, then the major figure around the king, and on 24 January 1446, still a 'king's clerk', he was papally provided to the see of Norwich, on Suffolk's petition and in supersession of Henry VI's initial nomination of his own confessor, John Stanbury. Custody of the temporalities had already been granted to him on 10 January 1446 and they were formally restored on 26 February. Lyhert was consecrated at Lambeth on 27 February 1446 and enthroned on 3 April. He made an extensive primary visitation between June and August 1448, but otherwise was no more than a periodic guest in his diocese before 1450. 
It was a startling advance to a first-rank see for a man of Lyhert's background, but the fact that it brought yet further major resources and patronage in East Anglia under Suffolk's control inevitably made Lyhert highly vulnerable. Accordingly, his position (undoubtedly to Suffolk's satisfaction) as confessor to Queen Margaret of Anjou was noted by his irascible Oxford contemporary, Thomas Gascoigne, and confirmed as fact, in 1447 at least, in parliament. John Halse had become her long-term chaplain. In that year too, Lyhert was rendered open to further criticism by his friendship with the increasingly notorious Bishop Reginald Pecock, who gave him a copy of his latest, highly controversial, sermon. 
On 16 August 1447 Lyhert was appointed as one of five principals in a delegation to seek peace but, more specifically, collaboration with the French in securing unity in the church; leaving London on 24 August, they achieved an extension of the truce, moved on to Lyons in late October and on 8 November were in Geneva seeking to persuade the antipope, Felix V, to resign. Returning to London on 14 January 1448 Lyhert had a personal interview with the king at Windsor the next day. Remaining in London around the court, he witnessed some council writs but was doubtless primarily in personal attendance on the queen and a reassuring presence to Suffolk. Unsurprisingly, he attracted abuse and lampoons at the time of the latter's fall from grace and subsequent murder in 1450 and was threatened directly by a mob in his diocese, to which he retreated, but he escaped physical harm then and political condemnation in parliament afterwards. He was not seen as an evil influence. 
Lyhert spent the early 1450s very much as a resident diocesan. However, when the king fell ill, he was one of the six leading bishops who on 5 December 1453, alongside six equally tentative lay peers, announced formally their reluctant consent to maintain the burden of governance while the king was incapacitated. Five months later, on 3 April 1454, when the duke of York became protector, Lyhert followed other bishops in saying he was ready to attend the council when his colleagues required, but asked 'that he have lycens among other to attend to his ayre and to vyeset his diosses as hit aperteneth unto hym' (Griffiths, 'King's council', 80). Clearly he recognized that his connections with the queen and court forbade him to lend credibility as a councillor to York's regime. Lyhert stayed until July, but did not return to London until November, and remained thereafter when the king recovered. He did, however, go back to his diocese before politics suddenly erupted into battle in the spring of 1455. This did not leave him free of the consequences. It was reported in the aftermath of the first battle of St Albans that John (I) Paston, a bitter local opponent of the late duke of Suffolk's regime in East Anglia, intended to seize this chance to denounce the bishop and two other leading henchmen in parliament. Paston hastily denied this. 
As the queen reasserted factional control in the following years, Lyhert became increasingly a resident diocesan. However, he did resume long-term residence in London in late 1459, presumably to bolster the Lancastrian court after it had driven its enemies into exile by war but had to expect their invasion. Hence, some time about October 1460, when these rivals appeared to have gained a decisive upper hand militarily, at least in the south, he felt the need to sue out a permanent exemption from parliaments and councils, in consideration of his age, long service at home and abroad, and 'his desire to follow things divine' ('CPR', '1452-61', 642). This was an obvious ploy to avoid involuntary collaboration with the new regime, and, in fact, Lyhert did not miss a single parliament under any dynasty or regime until the day he died. When Henry VI was restored briefly to the throne in September 1470, Lyhert, like other veterans, rallied to him in London and stayed there over the winter, but suffered no consequences when Edward IV won his throne back in the spring. 
Edward IV, of course, had had no public role for Lyhert to fill after 1461, which left him free to give his entire attention to his diocese, where his conscientiousness on visitations, in particular, made a considerable impression. According to the Paston family (with whom he now became very friendly), he took pains with his clergy, seeking to alleviate those in financial straits. However, he failed totally to break apart the scandalous (to the Pastons) betrothal of Margery Paston and their steward, Richard Calle, although he tried hard. 
Lyhert was a considerable benefactor to Norwich Cathedral, promoting the building of a spire that might remain upright and of the rood-screen, with his delightful three-pun rebus (a hart lying in water) sculpted freely round the church. He inherited a perennial jurisdictional feud between the bishop and the cathedral on the one side and the city on the other, which had several times turned violent and in 1442 had led to a major and damaging riot across the cathedral enclave. Lyhert more than held his own, in Norwich and also in Wymondham, where he responded with similar vigour to defiance against his jurisdiction in 1448. In a confrontation with the earl of Oxford in 1462 'my lorde dyde quyte hym als curageousely as ever I wist man do' ('Paston Letters', 2, 269). His register built up into by far the most immaculate and neat record of its kind in the whole of later medieval England, a massive calligraphic gem. This does not, in itself, prove pastoral zeal or spiritual sensitivity, but as a theologian by training (if not an original author) and with no external distractions, Lyhert's full-time residence and steady touring of his diocese suggest a mind concentrated on its work. Nevertheless, he delegated ordination ceremonies to suffragans almost throughout his episcopacy. 
Lyhert's final 'testament' was made at Hoxne, Suffolk, always his favourite residence, on 13 May 1472. His 'will', mainly dealing with his chantry, had been made on 31 March 1471. The testament had a clear direction. The funeral expenses were not to be 'superfluous and excessive', but 'in moderation', without 'solace for the rich and well-founded' but rather for 'the sick and needy', with 2died for every pauper at the funeral and again at the trental. There were to be three months' wages and board for all his servants, with handsome bonuses for each of them besides. No less than $100 was to be distributed to his poor tenants. One deceased servant, Richard Hedge, was to be a specified beneficiary within the bishop's own chantry, where the priest was to preach to the laity weekly through Advent and Lent. He bequeathed liturgical items to Exeter, Oriel, and All Souls colleges at Oxford, and 100's'. each to Gonville Hall and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. The residue of his estate was to be used for impoverished scholars in Oxford and Cambridge. His funeral and other bequests make it no surprise to find him bequeathing a copy of the distinctive 'Sermones dominicales' of Philip Repyndon, bishop of Lincoln, celebrated moralist and nominally repentant Wycliffite, to Mr John Wilton of Cambridge. Lyhert died at Hoxne on 24 May. He was buried, as he wished, before the door of the rood-screen he had built, in Norwich Cathedral. It was probably when the tombstone was later moved to the eastern door of the south choir aisle that his brass was discarded.

Lyle, David (fl. 1755-1762), maker of mathematical instruments and stenographer, was the author of a treatise entitled 'The art of short hand improved, being an universal character adapted to the English language, whereby every kind of subject may be expressed or taken down in a very easy, compendious, and legible manner' (1762). He describes himself on the title-page as a master of arts, having graduated at Glasgow in 1755. Nothing is known of the circumstances of his birth, or of his death. 
In the dedication of the work to the earl of Bute, Lyle states that it was by his lordship's good offices that he was enabled to bring his new mathematical instruments to great perfection, and that, at his desire, he had completed a set of them for the king. This set comprises four silver volute compasses, now in the King George III collection in the Science Museum, London, all similar in design and, according to the inscription on the largest and most complex, made in 1760. The compasses were designed to draw spirals of different types according to a changeable drum attached to the instrument. Few examples of this style of compass survive because they were not widely used owing to their limited field of application and the difficulty in manipulating them, and Lyle's has been described as one of the less successful bids to gain royal patronage. Other instruments by him are not known, and none was in the large collection of his patron, the earl of Bute, when it was sold in 1793. 
The introduction to Lyle's method of stenography, which he calls the other production of his younger days, contains a detailed essay on the theory of the art and criticism of the systems of Weston, Macaulay, and Annet. He was not successful, however, in reducing his theory to practice, for although his beautifully engraved tables of words and sentences are elegant and concise, a close examination reveals that their shortness is produced, in the majority of instances, by omitting words or syllables necessary to the sense. His vowel scheme, on a phonetic basis, was more extensive than any previously attempted, but the merits of the system are purely theoretical.

Lyle, Robert, first Lord Lyle (d. c.1470), nobleman, came of the family of Lyle of Duchal in Renfrewshire. The family's rise to prominence in national politics had been begun by Robert's father (also Robert), who served as a hostage for James I in 1424, when the value of the Lyle estates was assessed at $200 Scots per year. The younger Robert Lyle harboured ambitions, in alliance with his brother-in-law Robert, Lord Erskine, to half the lands of the earldom of Mar, by right of his descent from a younger coheir of Isabel, countess of Mar; he pursued this claim, albeit unsuccessfully, in the 1440s, during the turmoil of James II's minority. It is not clear when Lyle succeeded his father, but he had done so by 1445, when he was styled lord of Duchal. 
Lyle married a daughter of Andrew, Lord Gray, and it was probably through Gray's influence that he achieved a rise in status, which resulted in his being elevated to the peerage in 1452. His promotion certainly seems bound up with the king's conflict with the Black Douglases, since Gray is named as one of the men who took part, alongside James II, in the killing of the eighth earl of Douglas on 22 February in that year and he may have recommended Lyle as a loyal man in the potentially troublesome south-west of Scotland. That Lyle was with the king's army in the field on 18 July 1452, during the summer campaign waged against Douglas supporters, would have emphasized his loyalty. His career thereafter is rather more obscure, but he is a frequent witness to royal charters in James III's minority. He died 'c'.1470. 

Robert Lyle, second Lord Lyle (d. 1497), was the son of the first Lord Lyle and his second wife, Margaret Wallace. He succeeded his father even though he appears to have had an older brother, Alexander, who was described as the son and heir of Robert, Lord Lyle, in a bond made by Robert, Lord Boyd, in January 1466; Alexander must have predeceased the first Lord Lyle. By March 1472 the younger Robert Lyle had been appointed an ambassador to England. He may have established contact with the exiled James, ninth earl of Douglas, for on 22 March 1482 he went on trial before a parliamentary assize, charged with treasonably corresponding with the outlawed earl. Lyle was acquitted, no doubt owing to the king's influence. The importance of the trial of a notably loyal supporter of James III on remarkably insubstantial charges (Douglas did not even accompany the invading English army later in 1482) lies in the evidence it provides for opposition to James III and his more powerful supporters at this time. 
Lyle resumed his diplomatic career almost immediately, taking part in several embassies to the English court, one of which, in 1484, was to conclude a treaty whereby a marriage was arranged between Prince James and Anne de la Pole, daughter of the duke of Suffolk and niece of Richard III. Although the marriage never took place, owing to the death of Richard III at Bosworth in 1485, the treaty may indicate the position of influence which Lyle had built up with the English king. 
Lyle's hopes for advancement in the late 1480s were blocked by the return from exile before 1488 of the earl of Buchan. When Buchan was outlawed in 1485, Lyle acquired some of the earl's Angus lands, and probably hoped to secure further rewards for his loyal service. Buchan's reinstatement in favour with James III may have been instrumental in turning Lyle from loyal king's man to rebel. In 1488 he was at the January parliament held in Edinburgh, where he was proposed as a royal justiciar, but in April he was appointed to negotiate with the king on behalf of the Scottish nobles who were now in rebellion against James III. Lyle was named in the proposed settlement, known as the Aberdeen articles, as one of those commissioned by Prince James to negotiate with the king for the rebels, and Lyle's grievances against Buchan are mentioned specifically. 
Lyle was almost certainly present at the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488, when James III was killed, and he was at Edinburgh a few days later, involved in drawing up an inventory of the royal treasure. On 23 June, the day before James IV's coronation at Scone, Lyle was at work there drafting another inventory, and he secured the position of justiciar of Bute and Arran in July 1488. He was one of those who sat in judgement on Buchan when the latter was tried for treason on 8 October 1488, although he cannot have been happy about the pardon granted to his old adversary. In the same parliament he received extensive powers in criminal jurisdiction in his home area of Renfrewshire, along with John Stewart, earl of Lennox, and Stewart's brother, Matthew, and it was with these men that Lyle was to go into open revolt against the government in the summer of 1489. 
Lyle probably resented his exclusion from a government which was now dominated by the Hepburns and the choice of Lord Drummond, in preference to himself, as royal justiciar for the justice ayre in the south-west in February and March 1489; he may also have had suspicions concerning the apparent disappearance of part of the royal treasure for which he had prepared inventories in June 1488. The Lyle-Lennox alliance held the castles of Duchal, Crookston, and Dumbarton, and it was the alleged abuse of their judicial powers, particularly towards the Semples in Renfrewshire, that precipitated a response from the government, fearful that the rebellion would spread. Some of Lyle's Angus lands were granted to the earl of Buchan even before Lyle's forfeiture in July 1489, and a reward of $40 Scots in land was offered for Lyle's apprehension. 
On 11 October 1489 the rebels were defeated at the battle of the Field of the Moss, but James IV was nevertheless compelled to consult with the three estates and to reach a settlement with the rebels. The parliament held in February 1490 proceeded to annul the forfeitures passed the previous summer against the Lennox Stewarts and Lyle, who were present to hear the king declare their forfeitures null and void and order the original processes to be removed from the parliamentary records. Lyle resumed his position as justiciar, was appointed ambassador to the Spanish court on 26 February 1491, and was one of the auditors of the exchequer in 1492. He died in 1497. He was married to Margaret Houston, and their son, Robert, became third Lord Lyle.

Lyle, Thomas (1792-1859), physician and poet, the son of Robert Lyle and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Cochrane, was born in Paisley on 10 September 1792, and was educated at Paisley grammar school. He attended medical classes at Glasgow University. About 1815 he set up as a druggist in the High Street of Glasgow, and in 1817 he was licensed as a surgeon by the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. He practised in Glasgow for ten years before moving to Airth, near Falkirk, Stirlingshire. In 1853 he returned to Glasgow, where he found employment as surgeon to the Barony district parochial board during the cholera epidemic of 1853-4. He seems not to have enjoyed much success as a doctor. He was of a retiring disposition, happiest on botanical excursions, collecting old ballads, or writing verse for his own amusement. 
Lyle is remembered solely for the still popular song 'Let us haste to Kelvin Grove, bonnie lassie', written in 1819 and first published in the 'Harp of Renfrewshire' (1820). Some controversy arose as to the authorship, owing to the ascription of the song, by an editor of the 'Harp', to John Sim. The story is told by Hugh Macdonald in 'Rambles Round Glasgow' (2nd edn, 1856): 'Mr. Sim, who had contributed largely to the work... left Paisley before its completion for the West Indies, where he shortly afterwards died. In the meantime the song became a general favourite, when Mr. Lyle laid claim to it as his own production, and brought forward evidence of the most convincing nature (including letters from Sim himself) to that effect. (pp. 283-4)' It appeared that Sim had transcribed the song in his own hand and his executors concluded that it was Sim's. To the end of his life Lyle felt some bitterness at the mistake that had compelled him to prove authorship of his own work. The 1872 reprint of the 'Harp' still attributed 'Kelvin Grove' to Sim. Lyle contributed to R. A. Smith's 'Irish Minstrel', and edited 'Ancient Ballads and Songs' (1827). The latter work contains his own poems and songs, including a revised version of 'Kelvin Grove' and a section of 'Miscellaneous Poems, by Sir William Mure, Knight of Rowallan'. His own poems reflect his private interests, being filled with botanical references or modelled on old songs, with a romantic morbid cast over all. Lyle died of typhus fever, at his house, 61 Duke Street, Glasgow, on 19 April 1859, and was buried in the cemetery of the West Relief Church, Paisley, on 23 April. He was described as a widower on his death certificate, but nothing is known about his wife.

Lyly, John (1554-1606), writer and playwright, was the eldest of eight children of Peter Lyly (died 1569) and his wife, Jane Burgh (or Brough), of Burgh Hall in the North Riding of Yorkshire. He may have been born in Rochester, where his father is mentioned as a 'notary public' at the installation ceremonies for John Ponet in 1550, or perhaps in Canterbury, where the births of his younger siblings are registered between 1562 and 1568. 
Lyly inherited a family name already notable in the annals of literary scholarship. His grandfather, William Lily, was a leading member of the generation of scholars that brought Italian humanism to England, a colleague of More, Colet, and Erasmus in the founding of St Paul's School, the first humanistic grammar school in the country. Lily was high master there from 1509 until his death in 1522 or 1523, when he was succeeded by his son-in-law John Rightwise. Lily's fame as a grammarian was carried into succeeding generations by the name attached to the standard Latin grammar book (generally known as Lily's grammar though it was the result of collaboration with Colet and Erasmus). Interestingly enough, its dry scholastic forms, asserting a necessary relationship between stylistic purity and moral rectitude, teaching 'pure' Latinity by means of model sentences inculcating virtue, can be seen to foreshadow the mode of Lyly's later fictions, where the connections his grandfather established are put to question. 
The family's scholarly inheritance was carried forward by William's eldest son, George Lily, who, like his father, travelled to Italy in pursuit of the sources of humanist knowledge; but there, appointed as secretary to Reginald Pole, he was soon caught up in the religious battle between Pole and his kinsman Henry VIII. When, in the reign of Mary, Cardinal Pole became archbishop of Canterbury, George Lily became a canon of Canterbury Cathedral, establishing the family's connection with that part of the country. Fortunately for the family, both Pole and George Lily died about the same time as Elizabeth came to the throne, so that the surviving members were able to distance themselves from the tradition of Catholic loyalty. John Lyly's father, Peter, had in 1554 been given, no doubt by his brother's influence, the reversion of a canon's stall in Canterbury Cathedral, but the reversion never fell due, and he navigated the troubled religious situation at Elizabeth's accession without penalty, and went on to serve the protestant Archbishop Matthew Parker as a minor ecclesiastical functionary, a 'registrar'. 
Lyly's family on his mother's side belonged to a tightly-knit group of landowners in the area around Richmond, Yorkshire -- Hauxwell, Middleton Tyas, East Harsley, Gilling West, Caterick. The intermarriages between members of these families is very complex, but it is known that in the mid-sixteenth century Sir Ralph Rokeby had married a daughter of the Burgh family and also that Lyly's mother, Jane Burgh, possessed lands that had earlier belonged to the family of Rokeby. The connections forged by this marriage were reinforced when, on 22 November 1583, John Lyly married the heiress Beatrice (Betteris) Browne (whose mother was a Rokeby). For the career of John Lyly perhaps the most important point about these family ties was that they intersected at various points with the family of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, whose aunt, Joan Cecil, had married a member of the Browne family. The humanistically inclined Burghley must also have known George Lily from the time when he accompanied Cardinal Pole on his mission to England. 
It seems probable that John Lyly was educated at the King's School in Canterbury, his two younger brothers being named in the school register. In 1569 he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle. Anthony Wood reports that Lyly: 'was always averse to the crabbed studies of logic and philosophy [the staples of the curriculum]. For so it was that his genie being naturally bent to the pleasant paths of poetry (as if Apollo had given him a wreath of his own bays, without snatching or struggling) did in a manner neglect his academical studies. (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 1.676, paraphrasing Blount's dedicatory epistle to his 'Six Court Comedies' (1632))' In spite of these disadvantages he passed through the grades of BA (1573) and MA (1575). In 1574 he had besought Lord Burghley as chancellor of the university ('patronus suus colendissimus') to obtain letters appointing him to a fellowship at Magdalen. The proposal was not taken up, but Burghley remains so constant a factor in Lyly's life that it seems possible that Lyly was trying to exploit the family loyalty that Burghley certainly displays in his relation to Beatrice's cousin, the separatist, Robert Browne, bailing him from prison, reinstating him in his parish, and overriding the laws of the land to do so. It is clear that Lyly continued to cherish the family connection even after Burghley's death, giving his eldest son the name of Robert Browne Lyly (and repeating the name for his second son when the first died) and marrying his daughter Frances to William Browne of Tolthorpe, the separatist's nephew. 
Given his academic disappointments, Lyly seems to have taken refuge, like others since his time, in a belief that London would support the ambitions that Oxford had denied. He is next heard of living in the Savoy in the Strand. This institution had been founded in the reign of Henry VIII as a hospice for the indigent and the enfeebled, but by the time Lyly resided there it had come to serve as a London address for noblemen and their servants. The master of the Savoy at this point was William Absolom (appointed in 1576), another native of Canterbury, who had taught in the King's School between 1564 and 1566 when Lyly was of age to be a pupil there. It was in the Savoy, Gabriel Harvey records, that 'young Euphues hatched the eggs his elder friends laid' ('Works of Gabriel Harvey', 2.124). 

'Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit: Very Pleasant for All Gentlemen to Read' was published in 1578, and immediately made Lyly the most fashionable author in England. The book is, as Harvey's gibe indicates, a mosaic composed of scraps of humanist wisdom and gossipy classical quotations (mostly from Plutarch and Pliny) and much of this material is indeed copied out of the encyclopaedias compiled by the greatest of the 'elder friends', Erasmus. His 'Adagia', 'Similia', 'Apophthegmata', and 'Colloquia' are continually drawn on. 
Under the incrustation of these classical ornaments 'Euphues' tells a simple story, recording what might be regarded as the basic humanist legend: a young man 'of more wit than wealth, and yet of more wealth than wisdom' ('Works', 1.184) supposes he can succeed in the world by mere gifts of nature without worldly experience, and armed only with theoretical knowledge and literary precepts. The history of the 'euphues' thus provides a scholastic variation on the story of the prodigal son. The name comes from Roger Ascham's educational treatise, 'The Scholemaster' (1570), which states that 'euphues': 'is he that is apt by goodness of wit and appliable by readiness of will to learning, having all other qualities of the mind and parts of the body that must another day serve learning. But commonly the fairest bodies are bestowed on the foulest purposes. ('The Scholemaster', ed. E. Arber, 1870, 38)' The moral purpose of the tale is to anatomize or open up this quality of untrained natural capacity so that the reader can understand the route that eventually leads from wit to wisdom. But where the prodigal son learns his lesson in a pigsty, Lyly's Euphues learns it in terms of a linguistic bravura that invites not only censure but also admiration (and imitation), so that it highlights a basic contradiction between the moral and the narrative. There is also, as contemporaries noticed, an implicit claim that the brilliantly endowed Euphues should be recognized as a version of the brilliantly endowed John Lyly (an early example of the man of letters setting himself up as a 'personality'). Euphues (like Lyly) leaves Athens (Oxford) and travels to Naples (London) where his conversation dazzles the beautiful heiress Lucilla, at the same time as her sophisticated poise and social charm dazzle him. But love leads to betrayal and Euphues, disillusioned by the amoral superficiality of the smart set, returns to 'Athens' and spends his time there writing letters of moral advice stressing the danger of leaving young men free to choose their own way of life. Becoming a 'public reader in the University' ('Works', 1.286.26), he busies himself with 'searching out the secrets of nature and the hidden mysteries of philosophy' (ibid., 1.286.28-9). But after ten years of this he feels the need to make a further move away from society and turns from philosophy to divinity and now advises his correspondents to abandon worldly life. 
As early as 1579, in the second edition of 'The Anatomy of Wit', Lyly is beginning to compromise this moral pattern in preparation for a sequel that must return his hero to the ways of the world. He now writes to 'my very good friends, the gentlemen scholars of Oxford' ('Works', 1.324) and promises that in the next volume 'Euphues at his arrival [in England] I am assured will view Oxford, where he will either recant his sayings or renew his complaints' (ibid., 1.325.15-16). In the event, when 'Euphues and his England' was published in 1580, this forecast, like many others, was not fulfilled. It is clear that the intention to expand the Euphues saga was difficult to achieve. Lyly had created an effect so distinctive in its combination of humanist gravity in matter with self-conscious frivolity in manner that he was more or less obliged to repeat the book if he was to repeat the success. It was a success that had allowed him to hold the attention of a notoriously fickle world of fashion to such a degree that, as Edward Blount, his first editor, reported, 'all our ladies were then his scholars, and that beauty at court which could not parley Euphuism was as little regarded as she which now there [1632] speaks not French' (ibid., 3.3). But such success has to renew itself if it is to survive. 
Lyly's dedication to his new patron, Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford, indicates a second ambition for the book: he describes the new 'Euphues' as 'containing the estate of England... the conditions of the English court and the majesty of our dread Sovereign' ('Works', 2.7.15-19). This is a more directly political agenda than had appeared in the earlier volume. No doubt his social success so far was encouraging him to aim his hopes for patronage at the highest in the land. 
The new narrative tells how Euphues and his companion Philautus leave Italy and sail to England and then travel from Southampton to the court in London, accumulating as they go many moral observations about Englishness. The substance of the work is not, however, in the narrative but in the episodes by the way, the letters to and fro, the discussions of love and virtue, the 'sic et non' of scholastic disputation. The book culminates in rhapsodic praise of the queen. No doubt as part of the effort to win her favour, it begins with a dedication to 'the ladies and gentlewomen of England', and with that in mind he makes a somewhat less than flattering effort to stress its frivolity, telling the readers that 'Euphues would rather lie shut in a lady's casket than open in a scholar's study' ('Works', 2.9.4-5). 
In his relationship to the earl of Oxford, Lyly seems once again to have been caught in the paradoxical overlap between wit and wisdom, court and college, Italianism (as that was understood) and Christian humanist values. Certainly, as secretary to the 'Italianate' earl, he was still very much under the gaze of the 'patronus' to whom he had pledged lifelong allegiance, the humanist Lord Burghley, Oxford's father-in-law. A surviving letter from Oxford to Burghley, dated 30 October 1584, shows the difficulty of the situation he had acquired. Burghley had summoned Amis (another Oxford retainer) or Lyly to come to him, presumably to report on the earl's affairs. Oxford is in high dudgeon: 'I pray, my lord, leave that course, for I mean not to be yowre ward nor yowre chyld... and scorne to be offred that injurie to thinke I am so weake of government as to be ruled by servants, or not able to govern my self. (Feuillerat, 533)' An earlier letter from Lyly to Burghley shows the other side of the same situation: Lyly is in disgrace with his master and looks to Burghley to shield him, pledging loyalty to the lord treasurer and his daughter, the countess of Oxford. The whole situation suggests that Lyly's pleas for support had been answered by Burghley with a post of honour (made palatable to the earl by exploiting his well-known interest in literature and men of letters), that was as much to Burghley's advantage as to Lyly's. 
As a member of Oxford's household Lyly must have had something of the role of a literary middleman. His prefatory letter to Thomas Watson's 'Hekatompathia' of 1582 (dedicated to Oxford) shows him deploying his Euphuistic style as a mode of self-advertisement. Oxford's service also brought Lyly tantalizingly close to the goal of his career, the court. Given the vexed relations between the queen and the earl, the connection was, however, a perilous one at best. Oxford was excluded from court in 1580 and was not readmitted until 1583. In 1583 and 1584 there were performances at court by a new acting troupe called Oxford's Boys (in reality, apparently, a nonce group composed, as title-pages state, of 'the Children of her Majesty's Chapel and the Boys of [St] Paul's [Cathedral]'). This group performed at court on 'Newyear's Day at Night' 1583 and Shrove Tuesday 1584. Lyly was paid $10 on 25 November 1584 for a play before the queen 'on shrovetuesdaie at nighte' and the same warrant mentions another play performed 'upon newyeresdaie at nighte' by 'the Earl of Oxford his servants', John Lyly being the payee. It seems clear that these payments refer to Lyly's first two plays, 'Campaspe' and 'Sappho and Phao'. The evidence suggests that Oxford and Lyly had found a mutually advantageous situation: Lyly could display his literary talents before the queen, and Oxford could ingratiate himself with his recently offended sovereign by procuring for her a uniquely elegant entertainment, offering a blend of courtly compliment, classical learning, songs, and witty dialogue. 
The printed prologues and epilogues of these two plays record that they were performed not only at court but also in the small 'private' playhouse located in the former Blackfriars monastery, where choirboys had for many years performed (euphemistically 'rehearsed') plays before select audiences that were happy, no doubt, to participate in a court occasion, even if only at second hand, and willing to pay an entrance fee larger than that for the public playhouses. The division of the Blackfriars into a warren of tenements, to be used for dwelling spaces or for business purposes, created, however, a tangle of leases and sub-leases almost impenetrable to the modern mind. Lyly's use of the Blackfriars as an apparently essential part of his playwriting enterprise had been achieved by legalistic chicanery that had deprived the landlord of his rights and transferred the property to the earl of Oxford, who passed it to Lyly. This created, of course, an inherently unstable situation, and some time after the performance of 'Sappho and Phao' the landlord secured a court order that restored the property to his possession. As a consequence, there were to be no more plays in the Blackfriars for sixteen years. The performance of 'Gallathea', written by Lyly as his third play for the court, had to be shelved. In 1584 and again in 1589 Lyly disposed of the quite ample spaces in the Blackfriars he had leased for himself and his family. He was once again a man on the move, in more senses than one. 
Lyly's career as a court dramatist had suffered a reverse but not a fatal blow. In the period 1587-91 he is found in the parish of St Martin Ludgate, where four of his children were baptized. This brought him close to St Paul's, whose choirboys eventually took 'Gallathea' to court in 1588, and also performed it in their private playhouse in the St Paul's precinct. The Paul's Boys then brought to court two more of his plays, 'Endymion' in 1588 and 'Midas' in 1589. But the Paul's Boys playhouse was in its turn closed down in 1590. What was left of the courtly enterprise had to be rescued by the printing press. A prefatory note to 'Endymion' (1591) announced that 'Since the plays in Paul's were dissolved, there are certain comedies come to my hands by chance which were presented before her Majesty at several [i.e. different] times by the Children of Paul's' ('Works', 3.sig. civ). A printed version of 'Midas' (by the same publisher, who seems to have entertained the possibility of an edition of the collected plays) followed in 1592. 
Three plays by Lyly remain unaccounted for in this tally: 'Mother Bombie' (1594), 'The Woman in the Moon' (1597), and 'Love's Metamorphosis' (1601). This is a body of work of uncertain provenance. The title-pages of the first two state that they were played by the Children of Paul's, but no mention is made of the court, and indeed, as far as 'Mother Bombie' is concerned, Lyly seems to have given up the courtly vein of classical allegory and returned to an earlier mode of classically organized scholastic comedy. The title-page of 'The Woman in the Moon' says 'As it was presented before her Highness' ('Works', 3.239) but gives no indication of the acting company. It is Lyly's only play in verse: '
the first he had in Phoebus' holy bower 

But not the last, unless the first displease 
('Works', 3.241)' which suggests that the author was looking forward to a new court career, perhaps with an adult company -- adult companies continued to perform while both children's troupes were silenced. But it seems that his first offering in verse did displease, for no more is heard of Lyly's ambitions as a playwright. By the last decade of the century Lylian dramaturgy must have been seen as incurably old-fashioned. 
Lyly had made his name by inventing a new style, but the style had come to be identified with a bygone age and the writer identified with it was now no longer fashionable. 'Euphues' continued to be reprinted (twenty editions of the two parts were printed before the end of the century), but its admirers were no longer at the top of the social scale. More avant-garde writers condemned its mechanistic rhetoric and its self-consciously bizarre similes from natural history. The same process appears when the reputation of the plays is considered. When the dainty pastoral fantasy, 'Love's Metamorphosis', was printed in 1601, its title-page carried the legend, 'first played by the Children of Paul's and now by the Children of the Chapel' ('Works', 3.299). In 1601 a mention of the Chapel Children must refer to the new company of that name, revived in 1599 or 1600 under a new system of entrepreneurship. It is natural to suppose that the company should have begun with material like 'Love's Metamorphosis', already on its books, but the revival of such plays was greeted with scorn by new dramatists like Marston, Jonson, and Chapman who were taking over the boys' companies for their own satiric purposes. These new men derided plays like Lyly's as 'musty fopperies', 'mouldy dry fictions', 'ghosts... of plays departed a dozen years since', and the actors seem to have accepted the new focus as the one most likely to attract their new target audiences from the inns of court. 
Open hostility to Lyly's mode of writing was of course merely a passing phase promoted by those who were hoping to replace him. Caroline nostalgia for the supposed national unity of Elizabethan times restored his reputation to some degree, though not in terms that bear any relation to the facts of his life or the purposes of his art. Edward Blount's 1632 collected edition of the plays ('Six Court Comedies') presented him as a quaint figure from the past, 'the witty, comical, facetiously-quick and unparalleled John Lyly', 'a rare and excellent poet whose tunes alighted in the ears of a great and ever-famous Queen', and 'whom Queen Elizabeth then heard, graced and rewarded' ('Works', 3.2). He has become 'old John Lyly who will be merry with thee in thy chamber' (ibid., 3.3). 
The same process of slippage can be seen in Lyly's personal life. Burghley's daughter, the countess of Oxford, died in 1588, so that any position that Lyly occupied between Burghley and de Vere would be less important. The ever volatile earl seems to have found new interests (including a self-pleasing military posture in the defence of England against the Spanish Armada), and in any case he had been given a pension by Elizabeth in 1586, and there was nothing more he could hope from her. Lyly, none the less, could still think of himself as a man with prospects. In 1589 he was favoured with a seat in parliament, and he continued to find patrons willing to nominate him as an MP for the next three sessions, though, like other carpet-baggers, he had to move his district from one end of the country to the other. That at least secured him some social status, not to mention the standard rate of 2's'. a day, but it can hardly have satisfied his ambition. 
Lyly was made an esquire of the body, but without stipend. In 1594 he was admitted as a member of Gray's Inn, but only as part of a Christmas revel. In 1588 the queen seems to have promised him something more substantial than these merely titular honours. She apparently told him that he should 'aim all [his] courses at the Revels' -- that is, 'think of himself as in line for appointment as Master of the Revels, or at least chosen for the post in reversion' (Hunter, 356). This was a promise that haunted Lyly for the rest of his life. He clung to it as if to a lifeline, but as a verbal promise it lacked substance, and some political factors made it improbable. As a man associated with the earl of Oxford, Lyly must have been regarded as an enemy by the powerful faction of the Howards. The Howards' client Edmund Tilney was already in possession of the revels' post, and another client, Sir George Buck, was soon afterwards assured of the reversion. Elizabeth was not one to allow personal contact to overcome political expediency. 
Lyly himself may have unwittingly contributed to his own misfortunes. Some time in 1588 or 1589, ever anxious to please those in authority, he volunteered or accepted an invitation to join Thomas Nashe in a series of pamphlets counter-attacking those being written by the anti-episcopal Martin Marprelate. He was, of course, a well-known writer, but for this purpose he was an unfortunate choice; anyone less suited to the cut and thrust of political satire can hardly be imagined. Perhaps the bishops thought that the lively satirical dialogues of the servant boys in the sub-plots of the plays provided a model he could draw on when attacking their enemies. But the effect in the plays is controlled by highly artificial, almost geometrical structures, quite opposite to the freewheeling inventiveness of Martin or Nashe. 
It may, however, have been less Lyly's skill as a comic writer than his theatrical expertise that attracted the invitation to defend the bishops. Gabriel Harvey says that Lyly and Nashe 'have the stage at commandment, and can furnish-out Vices and Divels at their pleasure' ('Works of Gabriel Harvey', 2.213), but in 'Pappe with an Hatchet', the one pamphlet that is undoubtedly his, Lyly speaks as if the licensing authorities would not permit anti-Martinist plays to be performed: 'would those comedies might be allowed to be plaid that are pend, and then I am sure he [Martin] would be decyphered and so perhaps discouraged' ('Works', 3.408.18-20). In voicing such an ambition Lyly was, of course, running against a primary factor in Elizabethan control of the stage -- that matters ecclesiastical should not be represented there. He may, however, have been imprudent enough in his zeal for the establishment cause to defy the ban and employ the Paul's Boys he had at his 'commandment' in the anti-Martin campaign. If so, this may be a reason why the Paul's Boys were shut down in 1590, bringing Lyly's career as a writer to an absolute end. 
The only expression of Lyly's literary talent in the last sixteen years of his life appears in the begging letters he wrote to Elizabeth and to the Cecils, works treasured in various manuscript collections for their stylistic brilliance but ineffective in securing the income and status he believed he deserved. He reminded the queen of her promise; he hoped to be given a grant out of the confiscated estates of the Essex conspirators, but more important suitors were there before him (thus the estates of Sir Charles Danvers were given to Oxford -- though they never in fact reached him). He begged, in vain, for a post in the office of tents and toils (which supplied scenery for royal entertainments). In 1592 he left London and lived on his wife's lands in Mexborough, but in 1595 he is back in London, where he is found in a very modest property (valued at $3) in the grounds of St Bartholomew's Hospital. 
Even after the death of Elizabeth, Lyly seems to have persisted in his pleas for support. A letter from Toby Mathew, bishop of Durham, to 'his very loving cousin' Sir Julius Caesar, King James's master of requests (dated 9 February 1604), asks Caesar to intercede with the king 'in regard of [Lyly's] yeres fast growing on, & his insupportable charge of many children all unbestowed, besides the debt wherein he standeth, which I greatly feare will lye heavy upon him to his & their utter undoing' (Austin, 146-7). It is not known if this proposal had any more effect than its predecessors. Lyly's last two children were baptized in St Bartholomew-the-Less in 1603 and in 1604 or 1605, and he himself was buried in the same parish on 30 November 1606.

Lynam, Robert (1796-1845), schoolmaster and literary editor, was born in London on 14 April 1796, the son of Charles Lynam, spectacle maker, of the parish of St Alphage, London Wall. Lynam was admitted to Christ's Hospital in March 1806, where he passed as a Grecian in 1814. He graduated BA from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1818 and proceeded MA in 1821. In 1818 he was appointed assistant mathematical master at Christ's Hospital, and was promoted to fourth grammar master in 1820. Having previously taken orders, he resigned the post in 1832 for that of assistant chaplain and secretary to the Magdalen Hospital. It is not known when Lynam married but in 1828 his wife gave birth to a daughter. 
Lynam is chiefly remembered as an editor. While working at Christ's Hospital he edited Charles Rollin's 'Ancient History' (1823), 'The Complete Works of... Philip Skelton' (1824), 'The Complete Works of William Payley' (1825), and 'The Works of Samuel Johnson' (1825). Lynam's career as a writer includes a collection of sermons and the succinct 'History of England during the Reign of George III' (1825), but his most significant work was 'The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to the Death of Marcus Antonius' (1850). His self-confessed purpose was to fill a gap left by Hooke and Gibbon 'with the object of connecting the History of the Roman Republic with the History of the Decline and fall of the Roman Empire' (preface, 'History of Roman Emperors'). 'The History' was praised by the editor, the Revd John T. White of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who claimed that Lynam's 'depth of reflection satisfies the most acute and penetrating reader, and at the same time the pomp and harmony of his language gives pleasure to the most critical ear, and the most refined taste' (ibid.). However, it attracted little critical attention when it was published posthumously, perhaps because it had the misfortune to appear almost simultaneously with Merivale's 'Romans under the Empire'. 
Lynam remained active in the church. He was made St Matthew's day preacher at Christ's Hospital in 1821 and 1835. He was subsequently curate and lecturer of St Giles Cripplegate until his death. He died from lung and liver disease on 12 October 1845 at 4 Bridgewater Square, St Giles Cripplegate, London. He was survived by his wife and nine children.

Lynch, Dominic (1622-1697), Dominican theologian, was born in co. Galway on 4 August 1622, the son of Peter Lynch of Shrule and his wife, Mary Skerret. He was professed as a Dominican friar at St Mary's Priory, Galway, and was ordained subdeacon at St Nicholas, Galway, on 23 February 1644. Shortly afterwards he was sent by his superiors to Seville, where he studied philosophy and theology at the friary of San Pablo. He graduated DD at the Dominican Colegio de Santo Tomas in Seville on 19 September 1665 and was elected regent there on 8 May 1674. Before he could be inaugurated a commissioner had to travel to Galway to check his pedigree for purity of blood. The commissioner's report was printed in the 'Miscellany of the Irish Archaeological Society' in 1846. Lynch was elected by his brethren of the province of Andalusia to attend the congregation of the order held at Rome in 1686, over which he presided as moderator. Lynch published a four-volume 'Summa' of Thomist philosophy (Paris, 1666-86). He was regent at the Colegio de Santo Tomas for eighteen years, and died there on 11 December 1697. He was buried at the college in the same year.

Lynch, Henry Blosse (1807-1873), explorer in Mesopotamia, born on 24 November 1807, was one of the eleven sons of Major Henry Blosse Lynch (1778-1823) of Partry House, Ballinrobe, co. Mayo, and Elizabeth (died 1845), daughter of Robert Finnis of Hythe, Kent. Among his brothers were Thomas Kerr Lynch and Patrick Edward Lynch. Henry Blosse joined the Indian navy as a volunteer, under the name of Henry Lynch, in 1823, and was rated as midshipman on 27 March the same year. He was employed for several years on the survey of the Persian Gulf. He had a talent for languages, and made a close study of Persian and Arabic. On his promotion to lieutenant in 1829 he was appointed Persian and Arabic interpreter to the Gulf squadron, a post he held until 1832. During that time he was repeatedly employed in negotiations with the sheikhs of the Arab peoples of the gulf. He obtained leave from India in 1832 and was shipwrecked in the East India Company brig 'Nautilus' in the Red Sea; after leaving his shipmates, he crossed the Nubian Desert north of Abyssinia, descended the Nile to Egypt, and thence shipped home. 
In 1834, owing to his great local knowledge and general abilities, Lynch was selected as second in command of the expedition under Colonel Francis Rawdon Chesney to explore the Euphrates route to India, as well as to extend British political and commercial influences in the area. Lynch made preparations for the landing of the expedition in the Bay of Antioch, and chose a site near Bir or Birecik, on the Euphrates, for slips, in which the two steam vessels sent out from England in pieces were put together. He was constantly employed in delicate negotiations with neighbouring sheikhs, displaying much tact and judgement. When the two steamers were launched, Lynch received command of the 'Tigris', and surveyed over 500 miles along the River Euphrates. On 21 May 1836 the 'Tigris' foundered in a hurricane, with the loss of twenty lives, including Lynch's brother Richard Blosse, lieutenant in the 21st Bengal native infantry. This episode underlined the difficulty of riverine transport and suggested that seagoing steamships were still the best means of communication with India. After Chesney's return to England in 1837, Lynch was given command of the expedition, and ascended the Tigris to a higher point than had ever before been reached, carried out extensive surveys, and completed the Tigris map in 1839. He was a useful source of intelligence to the British government during a politically tense period. 
Lynch was promoted commander on 1 July 1839. The court of directors of the East India Company, anticipating important results from the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia, sent out that year, round the Cape, in pieces, under charge of Michael Lynch, Henry Blosse's brother and a lieutenant in the Indian navy, three river-steamers. They were specially constructed by McGregor Laird, whose company had provided Chesney's steamers and was to develop close ties with the Royal Geographical Society and government. The steamers were put together at Basrah, near the delta, and in 1840 four steamers were regularly sailing between Baghdad in the interior and Basrah. During Lynch's absence in 1841 two of his party steamed up the River Euphrates as far as Beles. Lynch resumed command at Beles in the autumn of 1841, when a base-line for the Mesopotamian survey was measured on the plain between Beles and Jiber, and connected by chronometric measurements with the Mediterranean. Ironically, the result of the two Euphrates surveys was to reveal the superiority of the sea compared with the river route to India. Lynch proceeded to Baghdad, and remained there in charge of the postal service between Baghdad and Damascus until late in 1842. He continued to advocate the importance of the riverine link and, writing to the Royal Geographical Society and Admiralty, pointed out the strategic and political advantages which would accrue to Britain if she exerted her influence in the area. 
Lynch commanded a flotilla off the mouth of the Indus in 1843, keeping open communication with Sir Charles James Napier's army in Sind. From that time until 1851 he was employed as assistant to the superintendent of the Indian navy, and a member of the oriental examination committee at Bombay, where he was a very active member of the Bombay Geographical Society. He became captain on 13 September 1847, and was appointed master attendant in Bombay dockyard in 1849. In 1851-3, as commodore, he commanded a small squadron of vessels of the Indian navy, which served with the Royal Navy during the Second Anglo-Burmese War, at the conclusion of which he was made CB. He returned to Britain, and on 13 April 1856 retired from the service. 
Lynch established himself in Paris. At the end of the Anglo-Persian War of 1856-7 he was delegated by Lord Palmerston to conduct the negotiations with the Persian plenipotentiary, which resulted in the treaty of Paris of 4 March 1857. The shah, in recognition of his services, nominated him to the highest class of the Lion and Sun. Henry was probably the brother with whom Thomas Kerr Lynch founded the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, which operated under the protection of the Foreign Office, in 1862. Lynch should not be confused with Captain William Francis Lynch, United States navy, whose surveys of the Jordan and Dead Sea were made a few years later, and were, like Lynch's, reported in the 'Journal of the Royal Geographical Society'. Lynch died at his home at 6 rue Royale, Faubourg St Honore, Paris, on 14 April 1873. He left a widow, Caroline Ann, whom he had married in August 1838, daughter of Colonel Robert Taylor, at one time political resident at Baghdad.

Lynch, James (1626-1713), Roman Catholic archbishop of Tuam, was a native of Galway city and a member of an influential local family. He received his early education from the Irish Jesuits and in 1651 entered the Jesuit run Irish College at Seville. Illness forced him home in 1653 but he later returned to Spain and took a doctorate in theology at the University of Salamanca. He taught in Compostela. In 1659 he was shipwrecked off San Sebastian. By 1668 he was parish priest of Galway and attached to the collegiate church. A noted preacher and administrator, he managed to remain popular with seculars and regulars alike, something of a feat in seventeenth-century Ireland. Thanks to his family connections he had the support of influential Catholic laity in rebuilding the local church. 
Lynch's pastoral success brought him to the attention of Propaganda which, since the death of John de Burgo in 1666, was searching to fill the vacant see of Tuam. Lynch was an attractive candidate, especially as he had avoided any involvement with or sympathy for Peter Walsh's 'Remonstrance', which had sought to distinguish unqualified temporal loyalty to Charles II from spiritual allegiance to Rome. Backed by the local clergy and gentry and enjoying the support of several members of the hierarchy he was appointed to Tuam in 1669 and consecrated at Ghent later in the year. His early correspondence to Rome summarizes the main problems in his archdiocese: authority disputes with regular clergy, a badly educated secular clergy, a dispirited local gentry, and a general ignorance of religion and morality among the laity. While these problems were unremarkable for a seventeenth-century Irish diocese they were exacerbated by the virtual breakdown in the machinery of ecclesiastical government following the Cromwellian wars. Lynch set himself a rebuilding programme. Despite authority disputes with the regulars, he requested that the Irish Capuchins be allowed to establish houses in his diocese. He asserted his authority over suffragan dioceses even when it brought him into conflict with Propaganda. Roman firmness did not deter him from trying to adapt church law, especially that concerning marriage, to local circumstances. 
His activities attracted the unwanted attentions of the civil administration and during his early career he endured sporadic harassment. Disaffected Catholics took advantage of anti-Catholic legislation to put pressure on Lynch. In 1671 a Galway based Augustinian, Martin French, brought him before the civil courts in Galway to face the charge of exercising foreign jurisdiction. When he was found guilty of 'praemunire' Lynch appealed his case to Dublin where it collapsed. However, in 1674 French again brought charges and this time Lynch was imprisoned prior to transportation to Spain, where he spent many years. While absent in Spain he was named as a ringleader of the Popish Plot in 1678 and was lucky to escape the fate of his archiepiscopal colleagues Oliver Plunket of Armagh and Peter Talbot of Dublin. Between 1682 and 1684 he exercised episcopal functions in Seville. At the accession of James II he returned to Tuam and worked in relative freedom until the Jacobite defeat. 
During the 1690s Lynch led a nomadic existence, living on the continent but frequently visiting his diocese, as in 1698, to oversee appointments. While abroad he governed through vicars, one of them his nephew Dominic Lynch. The ageing archbishop remained active in Irish ecclesiastical affairs. In 1704 he was in communication with Queen Mary concerning the filling of the vacant see of Elphin. After 1707 he settled permanently in France and enjoyed a pension from the French king. Solicitous of his own family's fortunes, in 1710 he unsuccessfully applied for the appointment as coadjutor of Tuam for his nephew Dominic. He died at the College des Lombards, Paris, on 29 October 1713, leaving a substantial bourse for Galway students in the Irish College there. He was buried at St Paul's Church, Paris.

Lynch, John (d. in or after 1677), historian, was born in Galway to an ancient family of the city. Neither his father's nor his mother's name is known; the often-stated suggestion that his father was the Alexander Lynch who had a school in Galway in 1608 has been shown to have no basis. Having received part of his early tuition from the Jesuits, he was sent to France in 1618 to further his education. Apparently bound for Rouen, he was persuaded by fellow Galwayman Francis Kirwan (who may also have been related to him) to go instead to the Jesuit college of Dieppe where Kirwan was a professor. He later spent a period in the Jesuit college of Douai before moving to Rouen, where he stayed from 1621 to 1624. During his time in France his fellow students included men who were later to be leading members of the Irish hierarchy. 
On his return to Ireland, Lynch was ordained priest early in 1625 and within a couple of years was appointed chaplain to Sir Richard Blake, who was mayor of Galway in 1627-8. In or about 1630 he was appointed archdeacon of Tuam. There remain only some minor details from his own hand of his ecclesiastical activities over the following decade or so, but his intellectual interests are reflected in his commissioning in 1643 of the Irish scholar and scribe Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh to copy a fragmentary collection of early Irish annals from a manuscript belonging to the learned family of MacEgan. 
Lynch attained a degree of prominence and even notoriety during the tumultuous decade which followed the outbreak of the Irish rising of autumn 1641. He and his old mentor, Francis Kirwan, now bishop of Killala, as firm supporters of the leading Galway Catholic magnate, Ulick Bourke, marquess of Clanricarde, were closely identified with the Old English party. This brought them into direct conflict with the Italian papal nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, archbishop of Fermo. The latter's machinations during his sojourn in Ireland in 1645-9 split the Catholic confederate camp and the Irish hierarchy. When in summer 1651 Galway city was invested by the Cromwellian army of Sir Charles Coote, Lynch was one of a small minority of the clergy which favoured surrendering on terms; and his few like-minded colleagues were consequently reviled as 'anti divines and pseudo preachers' (J. T. Gilbert, 'Contemporary History of Affairs in Ireland', 2, 1879, 71). After a nine-month siege and with famine looming, the city was suddenly surrendered. Although the terms were quite generous, little leniency was shown to the Catholic clergy: they were obliged to leave Ireland within six months. Even a moderate such as Lynch was not spared and before the end of 1652 he went into exile in France. He appears to have settled in or near the town of St Malo in Brittany, and there he spent the remainder of his life. 
Lynch was far from idle during his exile. He spent several years researching and writing a number of major works, some of which appeared in print during his lifetime. The best-known of these was 'Cambrensis eversus', which was largely written in the 1650s and published under the 'nom de plume' Gratianus Lucius in 1662, probably at St Malo. This learned refutation of the perceived anti-Irish slanders of the twelfth-century Cambro-Norman ecclesiastic and propagandist Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis) is combined with a cleverly persuasive defence of the Old English cause in the wars of the mid-seventeenth century. It also contains much evidence of Gaelic learning -- particularly in relation to genealogical material, some of which was probably supplied by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh. The next work of Lynch's to appear was 'Alithinologia, sive, Veridica responsio ad invectivam' which was issued under the 'nom de plume' Eudoxius Alithinologus in 1664, probably at St Omer. This book, together with a further volume entitled 'Supplementum alithinologiae', published in 1667, powerfully and skilfully argues the Old English case against the pro-Rinuccini faction in Rome. The only other work of Lynch's to appear in print during his lifetime was a life of his friend and former teacher Kirwan, who had died in Rennes in 1661; this little book, entitled 'Pii antistitis icon', was published in 1669. 
Lynch's most ambitious work, his voluminous history of the Irish bishops, 'De praesulibus Hiberniae', arranged on a diocesan basis and filling 1081 manuscript pages, was completed towards the end of 1672. Marshalling as it does an impressive array of source material, in both Irish and Latin, it must have taken several years of painstaking and onerous research work to compile. Lynch says that he wrote for relevant information to the person in charge of each Irish diocese, with very mixed results. He did not, however, live to see the work in print; it was finally published in 1944 in two large volumes. Another work of his which did not appear in his lifetime (it was published in 1846) was a Latin poem dating from 1667 in which he explains that he cannot return to his native land while a certain person (probably Charles Coote, president of Connaught) was still in power. A letter which he wrote about 1664 to a French scholar, M. du Boulay, correcting his linking of the terms 'Scotia' and 'Scoti' to medieval Scotland rather than to Ireland, was printed by Charles O'Conor as an appendix to his edition of Roderic O'Flaherty's 'Ogygia Vindicated' (1775). One other work of Lynch's which has never appeared in print is a translation into 'elegant Latin' of Geoffrey Keating's history of Ireland ('Foras feasa ar Eirinn'). It has been suggested that this was completed before Lynch left Ireland in 1652. 
The date of Lynch's death is uncertain. Most authorities suggest that he died in either 1673 or 1674, but evidence has been adduced that he was still alive in 1677. While it has been suggested that he may have spent his final years in Paris, it seems more likely that he passed away in St Malo, where he had lived for a quarter of a century.

Lynch, Patrick Edward (1810-1884), army officer, was one of the eleven sons of Major Henry Blosse Lynch (1778-1823) of Partry House, Ballinrobe, co. Mayo and the 73rd regiment of foot, and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1845), daughter of Robert Finnis of Hythe, Kent. Henry Blosse Lynch and Thomas Kerr Lynch were his brothers. He received a cadetship in 1826, and on 16 February 1827 was posted as ensign to the 16th Bombay native infantry, in which he obtained his subsequent promotions. He was one of the detachment of eight British officers and fourteen NCOs sent to Persia (as part of the British policy to ensure Persia as a buffer against Russia) to support Abbas Mirza. They reached Bushehr in November 1833 and Tehran in March 1834, and were employed under Sir Henry Lindesay Bethune. Lynch commanded a corps at Kisir Chur and the defeat of the Shiraz princes, for which he received the thanks of the shah, the decoration of the Lion and Sun, and the British local rank of major in Persia. The British detachment was withdrawn from service in 1836 to 1837. 
Following the British-Indian invasion of Afghanistan (1839) and the restoration of Shah Shuja, in summer 1840 Lieutenant Lynch was appointed political agent in the Ghilzai area of eastern Afghanistan. Apparently ambitious and wanting to increase his own power, he was not an independent arbiter above tribal politics but became involved in them. Following Ghilzai discontent he initiated, without authorization, an aggressive and provocative policy. On 30 April 1841 he attacked a fort 7 miles from Kalat and killed almost all its inhabitants; later, attempting to justify this, he produced stories, apparently unfounded, of conspiracies. According to M. E. Yapp 'the evidence suggests that Lynch was deliberately trying to cow the Ghilzays by a demonstration of ruthless force and determination' (Yapp, 323). He alienated support and in an uprising was besieged at Kalat-i-Ghilzai, and decided to resign. Sir William Macnaghten had already ordered his replacement, and wrote that Lynch was not only imprudent 'but a very dangerous character' (ibid.). He was replaced and his policy reversed. 
During the Indian mutiny Lynch served at Belgaum. In 1858 he commanded his regiment with the forces from Aden which captured the stronghold of Sheik Othman, and was mentioned in dispatches. He commanded at Aden and Assurghur, and was brigadier-general at Ahmednagar and Deesa. He became major-general in 1872, and retired with the rank of lieutenant-general in 1878. Lynch married Emily Elizabeth (died 1 May 1902), daughter of Captain Sturton of Ersland House, Reigate. They had one son, Colonel Henry Blosse Lynch, Dorset regiment (1856-1936), and five daughters. Lynch died at his seat, Partry House, Ballinrobe, Mayo, on 23 May 1884.

Lynch, Richard (1610-1676), Jesuit and theologian, was born at Galway on 15 November 1610, and came of a leading family of that town. He was a student at the Irish College at Santiago de Compostela in Spain before entering the Society of Jesus there on 14 September 1626. Having graduated DD he taught theology for many years at Valladolid and at Salamanca, where he enjoyed a high reputation. He published a three-volume compendium of scholastic philosophy (Lyon, 1654), and a two-volume treatise 'De Deo ultimo fine' (Salamanca, 1671). He died at Salamanca on 18 March 1676. He is not to be confused with another Richard Lynch (1611-1647) who entered the Andalusian province of the Society of Jesus at Seville in 1632 and was rector of the Irish College at Seville from 1644 until his death in 1647.

Lynch, Theodora Elizabeth (1812-1885), poet and novelist, was born at Dale Park, Sussex, the daughter of Arthur Foulks and his wife, Mary Ann McKenzie. Her father, of Redland House, Bristol, ran the Lodge estate sugar plantation in St Dorothy's parish (near Old Harbour, in modern St Catherine parish), Jamaica. Little is known of Theodora's early life. On 28 December 1835 she married Henry Mark Lynch at her father's plantation. Her husband was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on 29 October 1814, the second son of John Lynch of Kingston. He was admitted as a student of the Middle Temple on 31 May 1837, called to the bar on 12 June 1840, and returned to Jamaica to practise law. He was nominated to become a judge in the colony, but died of yellow fever on 15 July 1845 before taking up the post. He was buried at Halfway Tree church, St Andrew, Jamaica, on 16 July 1845. 
Following her husband's death Theodora returned to England and began her writing career. Her first publication was a book of poetry: 'Lays of the Sea, and other Poems' (1846; 2nd edn, 1850). The following year she turned to prose in 'The Cotton-Tree, or, Emily, the Little West Indian: a Tale for Young People' (1847; 2nd edn, 1853; 3rd edn, 1854). She continued her prose work in 'The Family Sepulchre: a Tale of Jamaica' (1848), which aimed 'to instruct the young mind how to meet the 'last enemy' with true Christian fortitude and composure'. Her stories were often set in the West Indies and were well laced with catechistic didacticism. Drawing on her own experiences of her youth in Jamaica, they offer intriguing insights into Jamaican society in the last years of slavery and the early years following emancipation. For example, she refers in 'The Family Sepulchre' to a white child as a 'buckra piccaninni', African terms for 'white' and 'child', respectively. She published another thirteen volumes of stories and novels, including 'Maude Effingham: a Tale of Jamaica' (1849); 'The Little Teacher' (2nd edn, 1851); 'The Mountain Pastor' (1852; 3rd edn, 1853); 'The Red Brick House' (1855); 'The Wonders of the West Indies' (two editions, 1856); 'The Story of my Girlhood' (1857); 'The Exodus of the Children of Israel, and their Wanderings in the Desert' (1857); 'Songs of the Evening Land, and other Poems' (1861); 'Rose and her Mission, a Tale of the West Indies' (1863); 'The Sabbaths of the Year, Hymns for Children' (1864), and 'Years Ago: a Tale of West Indian Domestic Life of the Eighteenth Century' (1865). Theodora Lynch died at 81 St John's Wood Terrace, London, on 27 June 1885, and was described in her 'Times' obituary as 'a poet of considerable merit'.

Lynch, Sir Thomas (d. 1684), colonial governor, was the son of Theophilus Lynch ('b'. 1603) and his wife, Judith, eldest daughter of John Aylmer, bishop of London. Nothing is known of Lynch's early life and education before he went out to Jamaica in the army of General Robert Venables in 1655. He had returned to England by 1660 when, as a captain, he petitioned the government for a passage back to Jamaica in one of the king's ships. While in England he secured for himself the lucrative appointment of provost marshal of Jamaica for life. 
Sir Thomas Lynch was one of the most successful settlers in early Jamaica, serving as governor of the island between 1671 and 1674 and between 1682 and 1684. He distinguished himself as a strong advocate for the future development of the island and as a devoted representative of planter interests against the interests of buccaneers. Along with his great rival Sir Thomas Modyford, Lynch was a principal founding father of Jamaica in a crucial stage of its early development. 
By 1664 Lynch possessed the most promising plantation in Port Morant. He worked this 1000 acre tract with a labour force of five white servants and thirty-seven slaves. By his departure for England in 1665 he had planted 45 acres, had erected a splendid sugar works, and built a well-furnished two-storey plantation house, suggesting an investment of at least $3000. He had also established himself as a person of political importance. In December 1662 he was lieutenant-colonel of the militia; in April 1663 he was sworn in as a member of the council; and in April 1664 he became president of the council. He remained a councillor when Sir Thomas Modyford became governor in June 1664 but appears to have fallen out with Modyford by February 1665. He wrote to Lord Arlington on 12 February 1665 that Modyford had discharged him from the council without giving any public reason. This falling out may have encouraged him to leave for England in 1665 instead of staying in Jamaica, where he had intended to 'marry, send for his relations and make this his England' (TNA: PRO, CO 1/19/31). 
In September 1670 Lynch was revenged on Modyford when he was appointed in Modyford's stead as lieutenant-governor of Jamaica. On 3 December he was knighted at Whitehall and on 16 January, probably in 1671 but possibly in 1670, he married Vere Herbert at Weybridge, Surrey. By June 1671 he had returned with his wife to a colony plunged into factional strife: buccaneers versus planters. Lynch was on the side of the planters, reminding Whitehall officials that 'if Jamaica have easy government, be defended from enemies, and supplied with negroes and servants, and have no privateering, in six years it may produce as much sugars as Barbadoes' ('CSP col.', 7.477). He opened up the Jamaican frontier to settlement, issuing 1200 patents for planting, mostly in unsettled parishes. He maintained good relations with the island's assembly, raising the republican and civilian part of the colonial constitution towards equality with its authoritarian and military foundations. He fostered trade, encouraging Jewish merchants and other religious minorities to engage in clandestine trade, in which he himself also participated. He was less successful in rooting out buccaneering and in implementing the treaty of Madrid of 1670. He tried to establish open trade with Spanish America but the Spanish were not prepared to buy 'so much as an emerald' from the British because they believed Lynch had breached the treaty by encouraging logwood cutting in Spanish territory and because they did not accept his boastful claims that he had eliminated privateering (Zahedieh, 'The merchants of Port Royal', 575). Although privateering did diminish in the early 1670s, it did not disappear but stabilized at lower levels. Lynch's attempt to lure privateers into planting by promising them grants of 35 acres if they gave up their way of life was seldom taken up. His arrest and execution of Peter Johnson, a privateer with a string of murders to his account, led to popular unrest in Port Royal, where Johnson was mourned 'as if he had been as pious and innocent as one of the primitive martyrs' (TNA: PRO, CO 1/30/67-8). More importantly, Lynch's contacts in England were less powerful than those of the buccaneers and, to Lynch's disgust, Sir Henry Morgan, 'Admirall of the Pryvateers' sent back to England in disgrace in 1672, was appointed lieutenant-governor in March 1674 and returned to Jamaica in triumph in 1675. Meanwhile Lynch's commission was revoked in November 1674. 
Lynch went back to England. A son, Charles, had been born to the Lynches in October 1671; a daughter, Philadelphia, was baptized on 4 June 1676 at St Martin-in-the-Fields and later married Sir Thomas Cotton, bt. It is unclear when Lynch married his second wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Temple of Warwickshire, who subsequently married Colonel Hender Molesworth, governor of Jamaica, 1684-7. They had no children. Lynch was reappointed governor of Jamaica in August 1681. Although he considered that 'Arguing with Assemblys is like philosophising with a Mule', he secured a twenty-one-year revenue act that guaranteed regular fiscal income to the royal government (Dunn, 159). His second governorship, following his arrival in May 1682, was marked by conflicts with Sir Henry Morgan's pro-buccaneering faction, but buccaneering was declining as planting began to prosper, much to Lynch's satisfaction. In 1682 he claimed that planting and trade were flourishing so much 'that within 15 months every man's freehold... is almost risen in value from 50 to 200 percent' (Claypole, 173). Highlights of his governorship included the publication of the first compilation of Jamaican laws and the first detailed map of settlement in the island. He died on 24 August 1684 and was buried in the cathedral at St Jago de la Vega. At his death he was the principal planter in Jamaica, owning 21,438 acres and a mansion of thirteen rooms. He left a lavish inventory, which included furnishings of $1236, silver worth $361, a coach, chariot and thirteen horses, and 100 books, as well as slaves and sugar-making utensils. His nephew Peter Beckford, whom Lynch appointed as captain of forts, succeeded him as the leading and wealthiest planter in Jamaica.

Lynch, Thomas Kerr (1818-1891), explorer in Mesopotamia, was the son of Major Henry Blosse Lynch (1778-1823) of Partry House, Ballinrobe, co. Mayo, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Finnis (died 1845), of Hythe, Kent. He was the younger brother of Henry Blosse Lynch and Patrick Edward Lynch. His early years were spent at Partry, after which he entered Trinity College, Dublin. On leaving college he joined his brother Henry on the second Euphrates expedition of 1837-42, with the aim of establishing steam communication with the areas drained by the Euphrates and Tigris and the Persian Gulf. Ironically, the difficulties which he encountered proved the unattractiveness of the river compared with the sea route to India: but Lynch, with a brother, probably Henry, set up the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in 1862. Its steamers regularly plied the rivers and, because it was the only formal representation of British interests in the area, it received protection from the Foreign Office. Lynch travelled extensively in Mesopotamia and Persia. He married, at Boulogne on 8 January 1857, Harriet Sophia (1822-1886), youngest daughter of Colonel Robert Taylor (1790-1852), British resident at Baghdad. After his return home he was for some years consul-general for Persia in London. He was made a knight of the Lion and Sun by the shah of Persia. Lynch died at his home at 33 Pont Street, London, on 23 December 1891, leaving a son, Henry Finnis Blosse Lynch, and a daughter. He was the author of 'A Visit to the Suez Canal', with ten illustrations (1866).

Lynch, Thomas Toke (1818-1871), hymn writer and composer, was born at Dunmow, Essex, on 5 July 1818, the son of John Burke Lynch, a surgeon. He was educated at a school in Islington, London, where he was afterwards an usher. In 1841 he became a Sunday school teacher and district visitor, occasionally preaching and giving lectures on sight-singing and temperance. In 1843 he entered Highbury (Independent) college, but shortly withdrew, mainly from ill health. He was pastor of Highgate Independent Church 1847-9, and then until 1852 of a congregation in Mortimer Street, which moved to Grafton Street, Fitzroy Square. In September 1849 he married Sarah, daughter of the Revd Edward Porter of Highgate, and in 1852 delivered a course of lectures on literature at the Royal Institution, Manchester. Ill health, from which he constantly suffered, prevented him from preaching for some years. He resumed in 1860 in Gower Street, pending the opening of Mornington Church in the Hampstead Road (pulled down in 1888 for the expansion of Euston Station), where he worked until his death on 9 May 1871 at his home, 76 Arlington Street, Regent's Park. 
Lynch's congregations were always small, and he was not a popular preacher. His 'Hymns for Heart and Voice: the Rivulet', a book of a hundred poems and hymns published in 1855, gave rise to a bitter controversy which deeply affected the nonconformist churches in England, particularly the Congregationalists and Baptists. Lynch's aim was to unite his appreciation of God's work in nature and history with a firm grasp of Christian truth, but his naturalistic imagery provoked a series of vituperative reviews from Calvinists in the religious press, in which the verses were described as pantheistic and theologically unsound. The so-called Rivulet controversy almost resulted in the dissolution of the assembly of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. Lynch himself replied to his opponents, under the pseudonym Silent Long, in 'The Ethics of quotation', and in a pamphlet of doggerel verse entitled 'Songs Controversial' (1856). The dispute was eventually settled by the intervention of Thomas Binney. Lynch's most notable hymns are 'Lift up your heads, rejoice', 'All faded is the glowing light', and 'Where is thy God, my soul?' He was also a composer, and set twenty-five of his own tunes to his hymns; these were published posthumously.

Lynde, Sir Humphrey (bap. 1579, d. 1636), religious controversialist, was baptized on 24 August 1579 at St Margaret's, Westminster, London, the eldest of four sons and two daughters of Cuthbert Lynde (died 1608), latterly a prominent member of the Grocers' Company and citizen of London, and his wife, Margery, 'nee' Baylie (died in or after 1608). He was educated at Westminster School, being a queen's scholar and victor, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1597 and graduated in 1600. He began his MA, being one of the two bachelors chosen for the influential university post of collectors, who divided the determining bachelors into classes and organized their disputations. According to Anthony Wood he continued no further because a relative left him an estate. In June 1601 he was admitted to the Middle Temple, London. His father's death in 1608 brought him appreciable wealth. 
By young manhood Lynde had come to a very strong protestant faith, and he became increasingly widely read in theology. On 31 January 1610 he married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Alexander Brett (died 1609) of Whitestaunton, Somerset, and his wife, Anne Gifford. The family was a recusant one, but Lynde evidently claimed Elizabeth for protestantism. Daniel Featley described this as a match 'made in heaven before it was consummate on earth, for he affianced his Spouse to Christ before he contracted her to himselfe... and by thus uniting her to himselfe by spirituall as well as carnall bonds, he had her heart knit unto him to his last breath: and in the Kalendar which hee made of all Gods blessings,... he put her as the chiefest. (Featley, 215)' They had three surviving sons and six daughters.On 11 November 1613 Lynde was knighted at Royston by James I, according to John Chamberlain on payment of $500. By 1614 he and his wife owned the manor of Clapham, Surrey, which they sold. He may then have leased a house at Twickenham, Middlesex, where several children were born between 1618 and 1626. He inherited or bought land in Cobham, Surrey, which became his country home, and became a JP and commissioner in the shire. His close friendship with Richard Chamberlain, clerk of the wards on the court of wards and liveries, and with Sir Walter Pye, king's attorney there, make it possible that they were once colleagues. He became MP for Brecknockshire in 1626, when Sir Walter decided to sit for Herefordshire after being elected for both. He was active on committees connected with religion, such as that considering if Bishop Richard Mountagu's books were harmful, and one on excommunication, besides those on local and general issues, but in 1628 apparently stood down in favour of Sir Walter's son. 
Lynde could have held higher office, but preferred to devote much of his time to theology. His views caused him to become friends with the earls of Lincoln and Warwick, Sir Henry Hastings, Thomas Gataker, Daniel Featley (chaplain to Archbishop George Abbot), and probably others in his circle. He always accepted the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, and wanted to receive communion kneeling when mortally ill, praying, 'O Lord, accept the will for the deed: I bow the knees of my heart unto thee, though I cannot of my body' (Featley, 217). 
In 1623 his cousin Edward Bugges sought Lynde's help, when conversion to Roman Catholicism was pressed on him on the grounds that there was no protestant church before Luther, and no salvation apart from Rome. Ultimately, finding Bugges with the Jesuit John Fisher, Lynde debated these questions with him. Later he invited Dr Featley and Dr Francis White, dean of Carlisle, to his London house in Sheer Lane for an after-dinner debate with Fisher and others in the presence of his family, friends, and Bugges, with carefully minuted proceedings. After four hours Fisher refused to answer. The king was pleased, and ordered Featley to publish 'The Roman Fisher Caught' (1624), but forbade further debate. 
That year Lynde began contributing to the wider controversy about whether the Roman church was a true one by publishing material defending Anglican theology, starting with 'The Book of Bertram the Priest' (1623), a translation of a Carolingian work which maintained that the eucharist gave spiritual food, but denied transubstantiation. This was followed in 1625 by his first original work, 'Antient Characters of the Visible Church'. In 1628 these arguments were developed in 'Via tuta, or, The Safe Way', dedicated to the religious and well-affected gentry of the realm, and were argued very lucidly and succinctly in short chapters. Lynde attacked Roman Catholicism for deviating from the faith and practice of the early church, and, by the Council of Trent, for making articles such as the papal supremacy, which he argued was contrary to scripture and early church history, an essential part of Roman faith. He contended that from the seventh century the Roman church had deviated gradually from apostolic faith over such matters as vernacular service and 'worship' of images, whereas the Anglican church was now true to original Christian doctrine, and was therefore the safe way to salvation. Lynde followed this in 1630 with 'Via devia' in a similar format. This was dedicated to the 'ingenuous' and moderate Romanists of the kingdom, offering to accept a heretic's punishment if he did not prove the faith he professed ancient and catholic. He attacked Rome's inconsistency in stating its faith was scriptural, yet preventing the laity from reading the 'Bible', and suggested its real motivation was to stop people discovering how their doctrine was contradicted by scripture. He contended that most erroneous Roman Catholic doctrine was based on tradition and lacked antiquity and universality, and that the most substantial part of Roman teaching did not derive from the primitive church and was not accepted by the early fathers and councils. Since it had not been called by the emperor, and was neither general nor free, the Council of Trent was invalid. 
These two works constituted almost a new genre, written by a cultivated gentleman for his peers, and enjoyed wide and lasting fame and influence. Sir Francis Herris mentions 'Via tuta' as having brought about his conversion in 1628. Both books were translated into French in 1645, and were much reprinted in Britain, including a nineteenth-century edition to stem conversions from Anglo-Catholicism to Roman Catholicism. 'Via tuta' was also contemporaneously translated into Dutch and Latin. In response to Lynde, John Floyd, sometimes identified with the Jesuit Robert Jenison, published 'A Pair of Spectacles for Sir Humphrey Linde to See his Way Withal' (1631), arguing that he had failed to show where the Anglican church was before Luther. Lynde replied with 'A Case for the Spectacles', published posthumously as Laud refused to license it earlier, allegedly because he was a layman, but probably because he disagreed with its theology. John Heigham contributed with 'Via vere tuta' (1631), largely invective which does not seriously answer Lynde's arguments; and other similar works followed. After his death Featley contributed to the debate with 'Stricture in Lyndomastigem', defending his friend's views and strengthening the anti-popery and anti-Arminian arguments of the time. 
Lynde suffered violent fits and terrifying pains in his last illness, possibly as a result of prostate and brain cancer, but remained lucid. He made a final public profession of faith to prevent any rumours that he had been reconciled to Rome. He reported to his wife and Featley that he had seen a vision of himself presented before God in a shining damask robe. He died at Cobham on 8 June 1636, and was buried in the chancel of the parish church on 14 June, survived by his wife.

Lyndwood, William (c.1375-1446), administrator, ecclesiastical lawyer, and bishop of St David's, was born in Linwood, near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire. One of the seven children of John Lyndwood (died 1419), a successful woolman, and his wife, Alice, William Lyndwood is depicted as a child, but dressed precociously in the robes of a doctor of laws, on his father's monumental brass in Linwood parish church. 
The first step in Lyndwood's education that can be traced was as a commoner at Gonville Hall, Cambridge; an inscription by a window in the old library of Gonville and Caius College enjoined viewers to offer prayers on his behalf. However, only the outlines of his subsequent academic career are visible. He is reported to have become a fellow at Pembroke College, and at some point during these early years he moved to Oxford, where, according to Thomas Fuller, he 'proceeded doctor of laws (probably rather by incorporation than constant education' (Fuller, 'Worthies', 2.10). He was at any rate BCL by 1403 and DCnL and DCL by 1407, and Lyndwood himself referred to his having lectured on the canon law. He also took holy orders at about the same time; he was made deacon on 15 February 1404, and priest on 12 March 1407. 
Only a little more than a year after receipt of his doctorate, Robert Hallum, bishop of Salisbury, commissioned Lyndwood to serve as official of his consistory court at Salisbury, the first step in a judicial career that led remarkably quickly to the highest judicial offices in the English church. In 1414 Archbishop Henry Chichele, with whom Lyndwood had been associated at Oxford, and to whom he later dedicated the 'Provinciale', nominated him as chancellor and auditor of causes in his court of audience. Three years later Lyndwood became the official principal of the court of arches in London. Court documents issued in his name have been preserved in contemporary formularies. Besides handling the ecclesiastical litigation routinely dealt with in these courts, he was delegated from time to time to judge a number of maritime cases, and he also took part in some of the prosecutions of Lollards that occurred during these years. Lyndwood served as prelocutor for the lower clergy at provincial convocations in 1419, 1421, 1424, 1425, and 1426, and in January 1431 he acted in the place of an indisposed Archbishop John Kemp of York, to deliver a sermon devoted to the blessings of unity within the realm at the opening of parliament. 
Such an administrative and judicial career was not then thought incompatible with the holding of ecclesiastical benefices, at least if obtained with the proper dispensations, and Lyndwood accumulated a considerable number over the course of his career. In a purely economic sense, they were the base of that career, providing him with a stream of income without requiring performance of the duties associated with the cure of souls. The first recorded benefice came to him even before he had been ordained deacon. On 30 November 1396, through royal patronage he was preferred to the wardenship of St Nicholas's Hospital, Scarborough. To this benefice, he added the wardenship of St Mary's Chapel in Scarborough Castle on 25 January 1399. In November 1403 he became rector of Walton on the Wolds, Leicestershire. He had surrendered this rectory by March 1410, when he was collated to the benefice of Winfrith Newburgh, Dorset, a benefice he later surrendered in exchange for the parish of St Mary in Romney Marsh, Kent, in March 1417. In September 1411 he had received a papal dispensation allowing him to hold an additional incompatible benefice with or without cure of souls for seven years, a dispensation that was made perpetual in 1421. Following this grant, he became rector of Shoreham in Kent with the dependent chapel of Otford in October 1415 (vacated by August 1425), rector of All Hallows, Bread Street, London (vacant by August 1433, when he became rector of Wimbledon), and in 1424 rector of Tring in Hertfordshire (occupied until he became a bishop), a parish he remembered with the gift of a book in his will. In addition to these benefices, Lyndwood held prebends in what now seems an astonishingly large number of England's cathedral churches: Exeter, where he was canon and prebendary from 1419 to 1442; Hereford, where after a dispute with Thomas Berkeley in the 1420s he occupied the prebend of Hunderton until 1442; Lincoln, where he was archdeacon of Stow between 1434 and 1442; St David's, where he was canon and prebendary of Llanwrthwl from 1421 to 1442; Salisbury, where he held the prebend of Ruscombe Southbury from 1412 to 1424, and that of Bishopstone from 1424 to 1434; and Bath and Wells, where he was prebendary of Taunton from 1419 until 1433. 
As with many prominent civilians, Lyndwood's talents found an outlet in diplomacy. Already in July 1417 he had accompanied Henry Ware, keeper of the privy seal, to Calais to negotiate the extension of the truce with the duke of Burgundy. In 1422 he was sent to Portugal to help negotiate a treaty with that country, and in the following year he accompanied John Kemp on a diplomatic mission in France. In 1431 he was chosen to be a member of the retinue that attended the coronation of Henry VI as king of France on 16 December, and when he returned to England early the following year, he was appointed keeper of the privy seal. Subsequently he was involved in negotiations leading up to the congress of Arras in 1435, and also in the formulation of several agreements with the Hanseatic League and other German interests, various commercial treaties in the Low Countries, and in 1438 a truce with the Scots. 
Besides the continuing and active part he took in convocation, Lyndwood was called upon to give articulate voice to English interests at the Council of Basel (1431-2). He played a part in the foundation of Eton College, and was also appointed one of the commissioners responsible for drafting the statutes of King's College, Cambridge. Finally, and rather late in life for so prominent an ecclesiastic, he was given the Welsh bishopric of St David's after the death of Thomas Rodeburne in 1442. He was provided by the pope to the see on 27 June, received the temporalities on 14 August, and was consecrated on 26 August. He held the see until his death, which occurred on either 21 or 22 October 1446. His will was proved on 26 November 1446, and his body was buried in St Stephen's Chapel in the palace of Westminster, following the desires expressed in the will. The later history of the burial spot is uncertain, but in 1852 a body with a crosier thought to be Lyndwood's was discovered in the crypt. It was reinterred in Westminster Abbey in the north wall of the north cloister, a short distance from the east entrance door. The black marble ledger, under which it rests, is unfortunately now invisible because of construction carried out at a later date around the cloister door. 
Lyndwood's enduring reputation rests not on his career, successful though that was. It rests on the compilation of a single work, the 'Provinciale', which he had begun by 1422, while he was serving as judge in the court of arches, and which he had completed by January 1434. Although early references exist to two other works by Lyndwood, the one his lectures on the 'Decretum Gratiani', the other a commentary on a portion of the 'Psalms', the 'Provinciale' alone has survived. It is a collection of the most important ecclesiastical legislation enacted within the province of Canterbury between the Council of Oxford in 1222 and Chichele's archiepiscopate. To these statutes, or constitutions as they were more properly called, Lyndwood added two royal responses to clerical demands made in the constitutions: the writ 'Circumspecte agatis' (1286) and part of the 'Articuli cleri' (1316). The completed 'Provinciale' was accompanied by a comprehensive subject matter index, bearing a Latinized form of his name (Gulielmus de Tylia Nemore) and, more importantly, by his own extensive marginal gloss. In the fashion of the European 'ius commune' (as the amalgam of Roman and canon law taught in continental universities was known), the gloss clarified the meaning of the constitutions, related them to the general law of the church, raised legal points of doubt and controversy, and commented upon their observance in the English spiritual courts. 
The 'Provinciale' belongs firmly within continental legal traditions. This is so not simply because the authorities Lyndwood cited were the treatises of continental jurists. It is also a fair assessment because, in so far as his great work has a theme, that theme is the harmonization of the English provincial constitutions with the law of the Western church. He organized his work into five books, each divided into separate titles, thereby following exactly the model of the basic canonical text, the 'Decretales Gregorii IX' (1234), rather than the chronological order of the constitutions. Similarly, the work's first title is 'De summa trinitate et de fide catholica', just as it is in the 'Decretals' and the Roman law codex. In it, Lyndwood placed a constitution from the Council of Lambeth (1281) designed 'for the information of simple priests' in the rudiments of the Christian faith ('Councils & Synods', vol. 2, ed. F. M. Powicke and C. R. Cheney, 2 vols., 1964, 2.900). 
It must be admitted that, despite Lyndwood's best efforts, the fit between his project and the canonical texts of the Western church was far from perfect. Lyndwood was obliged by the material at his disposal to omit some of the titles that appeared in the 'Decretals'. There is no heading 'De rescriptis', for instance. Papal rescripts of justice were not a subject treated by the English provincial constitutions. Moreover, local conditions required that some subjects be treated at greater length than is found in the 'Decretals'. For example, Lyndwood's title 'De testamentis' occupies a proportionally larger share than that same title does in the Gregorian 'Decretals' -- one result of the English church's more expansive jurisdiction over testamentary succession compared to that of most continental churches. Conversely, Lyndwood's title 'De jure patronatus' occupies a lesser share of his treatment. The English royal courts kept spiritual jurisdiction over patronage questions within narrower limits compared to most places across the channel. Lyndwood was also obliged to put the law of defamation under the title 'De sententia excommunicationis', rather than the title 'De iniuriis', where a continental jurist would have thought it more apt, because defamation was incorporated into the decrees of the Council of Oxford (1222) excommunicating several kinds of violators of the church's laws. 
Lyndwood's 'Provinciale' filled a real need. The constitutions it collected and upon which its gloss commented were of immediate importance in the work of the English spiritual courts, and no other source dealt with them so directly. Lyndwood himself evidently held a high opinion of the value of his work. His will provided that it should be chained and kept in St Stephen's Chapel in Westminster Abbey, so that recourse could be had to it 'for the correction of other books to be copied from the same treatise' (Hunter, 419). The fate of this volume, or that of the other copy Lyndwood mentioned with particular approbation in his will, cannot now be discovered. It seems unlikely that a single archetype can be found, given the variations in the text and glosses in the fifty-five or so manuscripts that have survived to the present day. 
By modern editing standards, Lyndwood's method of compiling the constitutions seems quite inadequate. He was guilty of false attributions and he transcribed some of the texts incorrectly. He seems to have deliberately changed the wording in a few instances. However, Lyndwood's goal was not to produce a historically accurate transcription. It was to produce a serviceable collection of texts and commentary, suitable for use in the everyday study and practice of ecclesiastical law in England. Subsequent experience shows that he did not miss the mark. That it was considered an economic proposition to reprint Lyndwood's work so many times is a tribute to its success. The constitutions around which it was built controlled the character of much of the litigation heard in the consistory courts, and Lyndwood's gloss is the best guide to that character. English parochial clergy, academics, and professional ecclesiastical lawyers all owned and used copies of this book. 
The Reformation did not curtail its currency in England. Because the scope of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in England was not fundamentally changed during the sixteenth century, ecclesiastical lawyers continued to use the 'Provinciale'. Its influence has been quite long-lasting. Edmund Gibson testified to its influence upon later generations in his 'Codex juris ecclesiastici Anglicani' (1713), and in the twentieth century it was used in the draft revision of English canon law of 1947 produced by the Vaisey Commission. The relevance of its treatment of English ecclesiastical practice recommended it even to English common lawyers. Their citation of the glosses of the 'Provinciale' when questions of ecclesiastical law arose in the royal courts is a continuing feature in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century reports. 
Whatever the problems of textual transmission, the later history of the 'Provinciale' amply confirms the high opinion Lyndwood and his contemporaries had of the work. It appeared in thirteen pre-1640 editions listed in the 'Short-Title Catalogue'. The earliest was printed in Oxford, probably in 1483, under the imprint of Thomas Rood. An impressive volume of some 350 folios, it was not only larger than any book printed there for the next hundred years, it was also one of the first law books to be printed in England. An octavo edition, without the gloss, was published with Caxton's cipher at Westminster in 1496. This text was itself reprinted by the same editor with minor variations and abridgements in 1499, and also twice in that year by Richard Pynson. Other London editions appeared in 1517, 1529, and 1557. An English translation without the gloss was published by Robert Redman in 1534. Continental publishers also took it up. Folio editions of the work, including the entire gloss and supplements from the constitutions of cardinals Otto and Ottobuono (papal legates to England during the reign of Henry III), were published in Paris in 1501, 1504, and 1505, and an edition also appeared at Antwerp in 1525. 
Thereafter the demand for it lessened, perhaps because of the extent of printing that had already occurred and the uncertainty about the future of the canon law in England that was caused by the Reformation. However, a later version, edited and abridged by Robert Sharrock of New College, Oxford, was printed there in 1664 under the title 'Provinciale vetus provinciae cantuariensis'. This edition was followed quickly by what has become the standard edition, the 'Provinciale (seu Constitutiones Angliae') printed at Oxford in 1679. It includes Lyndwood's full gloss, the constitutions of Otto and Ottobuono, together with the gloss on them written about 1340 by John Atton (or Acton). Its reprinting in 1968 stands as a reminder that it deserves the accolade once conferred upon it by Thomas Fuller. He described it as a work 'highly esteemed by foreign lawyers', and as one that would 'be valued by the judicious whilst learning and civility have a being' (Fuller, 'Church History', 1.500).

Lyne, Richard (fl. c.1570-c.1600), painter and engraver, was one of the earliest English artists whose works have been preserved. Vertue noted that he was one of the engravers employed by Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, and worked for him, in company with Remigius Hogenberg, at Cambridge and at Lambeth Palace. John Ingamells considered that the portrait of Parker at Lambeth, of which a small engraving on copper was made by Hogenberg, is: 'more likely to derive from the print which was intended for Parker's 'De Antiquitate Britannicae ecclesiae' 1572, which was based on the miniature portrait stuck in the Corpus Christi 'Black Book of Corpus Christi College' (MS 582, the Parker Library, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge). (Ingamells, 317)' Lyne drew and engraved at Parker's expense a very interesting map of the University of Cambridge for John Caius's 'Historia Cantabrigiensis' (1574). He also painted and engraved in that year a large genealogical chart of the history of Great Britain ('of this Hogenberg. is graved. a small. plate' (Vertue, 'Note books', 2.71) which appeared in Alexander Neville's 'De furoribus Norfolciensium Ketto duce' (1575). Vertue noted further that the original was 'done in wood, but very plain & well. to which the name is set. 'Richardus Lyne' servus D. Matths. Archp Cant. Sculpsit 1574'' (ibid., 71-2). Lyne is mentioned by Francis Meres in his 'Palladis tamia' (1598) as among the leading painters of the time.

Lynford, Thomas (bap. 1650, d. 1724), Church of England clergyman, was baptized at St Benedict's, Cambridge, on 30 October 1650, the son of Samuel Lynford (1609-1657?), prebend of Exeter. Lynford's father was ejected from his living and died before the Restoration. Lynford was educated under Mr Leeds at Newark and then at Bury St Edmunds grammar school before being admitted sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 16 July 1666. He graduated BA in 1670-71 and proceeded MA in 1674. He was ordained in March 1674 and that year became curate at Fen Drayton, Cambridgeshire. The following year he became vicar of Great Ellingham, Norfolk, which he resigned in 1676. Lynford was now a tutor in Cambridge, one of his pupils being Robert Perceval, a nephew of Sir Robert Southwell, whom Lynford took pains to impress as a possible future patron. In July 1675 Lynford was made a fellow of Christ's College, although there appears to have been some initial opposition to his election. He was incorporated at Oxford in July 1676. By 1679 he had made sufficient contacts in London to preach a sermon before the lord mayor. In December 1685 Lynford became rector of St Edmund the King, Lombard Street, in the City of London and consequently resigned his fellowship in 1686. During James II's reign he wrote the 'Ninth Note of the Church Examined', which was republished by Bishop Edmund Gibson in 'Preservative Against Popery' (1738), and published several other anti-popish tracts. 
In October 1689 Lynford was created DD during William III's visit to Cambridge. He was licensed on 25 November to marry Elizabeth Dillingham (1666/7-1744?) of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London. They had no children. In 1695 he was living in the parish of St Gregory by Paul's. After presentation by the king, in April 1700 Lynford was installed as a prebend of Westminster. The founding charter of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in June 1701 described Lynford as a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king. In September 1709 he was collated as archdeacon of Barnstaple. Lynford was an opponent of Francis Atterbury, dean of Westminster and bishop of Rochester, in his attempt to build a new dormitory for Westminster School, which involved him in the resulting cases in chancery and before the House of Lords. Lynford served as subdean of Westminster in 1723. He died on 11 August 1724. 
As chaplain to William III, Queen Anne, and George I, Lynford published a few sermons, but evidently had no great opinion of his own literary merit for his will, written in April 1724, instructed his nephew, Dr William Herring, not to publish anything he found after his death 'because I am sure nothing deserves it' (will, fol. 69'v'). This self-effacement continued with his funeral instructions which ordered burial in St Edmund's, Lombard Street, at midnight 'without Sermon, without Escutcheons, without any Bearers but the Common Bearers of the Parish' (will, fol. 68'v'). His books were divided among his wife, Christ's College, Sion College, the deans and chapters of Westminster and Exeter, and Herring. Most of his estate was left to his wife, whose will was proved in 1744.

Lynn, George, the elder (1676-1742), astronomer and antiquary, was born at Southwick House, near Oundle, Northamptonshire, the second son of George Lynn (1647/8-1682), lord of the manor of Southwick, and his wife, Mary (died 1722), the eldest daughter of Walter Johnson of Spalding. His younger brother Walter Lynn (1677/8-1763) became a medical writer. George Lynn married Elizabeth (died 1742), the daughter of Humphrey Bellamy of London; they had two daughters, who died unmarried, and a son, also George Lynn ['see below']. 
Lynn possessed a 13 foot telescope, with which he made a variety of astronomical observations. Those of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, made in 1724-6 and 1730-35, he sent to the Royal Society. He also sent to the society his account of the aurora borealis of 8 October 1726 and his meteorological register covering the fourteen years up to 1740. 
Lynn became in 1719 a member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society, to which he gave an extensive table of logarithms which he had compiled. With the noted antiquary William Stukeley, he was in 1745 one of the founders of the Brazen-Nose Society, so named after a famous 'university' at Stamford, on whose site they met weekly. About this time a ploughman at Cotterstock, a mile from Lynn's house, uncovered a Roman tessellated pavement, of which Lynn and his son prepared a drawing which Vertue engraved for the Society of Antiquaries. Lynn died on 28 June 1742 and was buried at Southwick on 5 July. His son,

George Lynn the younger (1707-1758), antiquary, was born in London. After attending school in Spalding he entered St John's College, Cambridge, and was in 1723 admitted to the Inner Temple; he was called to the bar in 1729. He joined the Spalding Gentlemen's Society in 1723 and the Society of Antiquaries in 1726. He married in 1734 Anne (died 1767), the eldest daughter of Sir Edward Bellamy of Frinton Hall, Essex, lord mayor of London in 1735, and through her inherited the manor of Frinton. Lynn died childless on 16 May 1758; a handsome monument by Roubilac was erected to him in Southwick parish church.

Lynn, Samuel Ferris (1836-1876), sculptor, was born at Fethard, co. Wexford, the son of Henry Johnston Lynn, lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Margaretta Ferris. He studied modelling at the Belfast School of Design, and architecture with his elder brother, William Henry Lynn, who established a highly successful architectural practice. He moved to London in 1854 and enrolled as a pupil at the Royal Academy Schools, where he achieved early success as an exhibitor, being awarded a silver medal in 1857 for a model from life and a gold medal in 1859 for the best historical composition, 'Lycoan Imploring Achilles to Spare his Life'. His group 'Procris and Cephalus' won for him the academy's travelling studentship. He remained a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy throughout his life, while he participated in the Royal Hibernian Academy exhibitions in Dublin on only four occasions. His first exhibited work in Dublin (1864) was a subject piece, 'Evangeline' (plaster), previously exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1858 and at the International Exhibition in London in 1862. This sad and reflective figure, representing the heroine of Longfellow's poem of the same title, was illustrated and discussed in the 'Art Journal' in 1865. Lynn lived most of his working life in London, where he was engaged in the early 1860s as assistant to Patrick MacDowell and later to John Henry Foley, both of whom were also Irish sculptors and whose influence remains evident in his work. His wide range of expression in his ideal works, from the violent and vigorous to the gentle and sensitive, echoes the range of MacDowell. Foley was engaged on work for the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens when Lynn was working in his studio and his portrait style reveals itself in Lynn's monumental portrait work. 
Like most Victorian sculptors, Lynn executed a considerable number of imaginative works while making his career as a portrait sculptor. Among his monumental portrait sculptures, most of which are in Northern Ireland, the marble statue of Lord Farnham in Cavan, co. Cavan, executed in 1871, was described in the 'Irish Builder' as 'evincing great artistic learning, diligent study and marked ability'. Farnham is shown in the robes of the Order of St Patrick. Shortly before this work Lynn received the commission to execute the statue of Prince Albert for W. J. Barre's Albert memorial clock tower in Belfast, completed in 1869. Surely influenced by Foley's many statues of the prince, Lynn's portrait, executed in Portland stone, was described as 'noble and commanding' ('ILN', 5 Feb 1870, 153). In 1873 his bronze statue of the marquess of Downshire, less formally grand and more casual in appearance, was unveiled on his estate at Hillsborough, co. Down. A further statue in Belfast (and one of Lynn's last works), commemorating the Revd Dr Henry Cooke, erected in College Square in 1876, replaced a statue of the earl of Belfast by Patrick MacDowell which was removed indoors. The MacDowell statue, executed in bronze, had been labelled 'the Black Man', a name which transferred to the bronze Lynn portrait. A tomb monument by Lynn commemorating Joseph Makesy (1868), taking the form of an angel uncovering a medallion portrait of the deceased, is in Waterford Cathedral. Lynn was also engaged to carry out architectural sculpture, examples of which are at the Lancashire Insurance office in Manchester (1861) and the Provincial Bank (now the Allied Irish Bank) in College Street, Dublin (1864). The pediment of the bank building shows a representation of Commerce and Agriculture by Lynn. 
Lynn had a short but full career; he died on 5 April 1876, at the age of forty, at his home in Crumlin Terrace, Belfast. While he failed to be elected to the Royal Academy in his lifetime, he did become a member of the Institute of Sculptors in London in 1861 and was elected an associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1872. On the presentation of two of Lynn's statuettes to the Belfast Municipal Art Gallery in 1907, Thomas Drew, president of the Royal Hibernian Academy, described 'the grace of pose and dignity' in his monumental sculpture and drew attention to his mastery of drapery ('Belfast Municipal Art Gallery and Museum Quarterly', 6). His obituary describes a 'man whom to know was to love; a kinder and better friend it was impossible to meet' ('Belfast News-Letter', 7 April 1876). This is further supported by the words of a contemporary and friend, Dr Kyle Knox, who wrote about Lynn in 1916 on the occasion of a joint exhibition of the works of the Lynn brothers in the Belfast Municipal Art Gallery. Knox described a 'bright, happy and pleasant companion,... always ready for jokes' (Knox, 11).

Lynn, Thomas (1774-1847), naval officer in the East India Company and teacher of navigation, was born on 2 January 1774 at Woodbridge, Suffolk, one of at least two sons of James Lynn, a medical practitioner, and his wife, Elizabeth. In order to be accepted into the navy of the East India Company, Thomas and his brother John were provided with fraudulent baptismal certificates indicating that they were three years older than they actually were; Thomas was only eleven when he was taken on the books of the East India Company's 'Valentine' as captain's servant in 1785. In due course he rose through the ranks, and made several voyages to the West Indies, then to the East Indies and China. He was serving as first mate by 1798, and his last voyage was to China as captain of the 'Barkworth', in 1816-17. 
Lynn was then appointed examiner in nautical astronomy to the East India Company's officers. He was based at 34 Trinity Square, Tower Hill, where he may have resided with his daughter, Mary Emma (probably born soon after he settled in London), and at 148 Leadenhall Street, in the City of London, the latter being well known to mariners as it was adjacent to East India House and occupied by a succession of scientific and nautical instrument makers. Lynn also advertised that he would instruct Royal Navy officers and supply instruments and chronometers. He published sets of star tables and pamphlets on telegraphic communication and practical navigation, and contributed a detailed chapter on the various routes to and from Chinese ports to the three-volume work on China in the 'Edinburgh Cabinet Library' series issued in 1836. 
By 1836, however, Lynn's income was inadequate and he was obliged to dispose of his publications and sell his copyrights. He and Mary Emma moved to 1 Marine Terrace, East Cliff, Dover, where he died on 2 May 1847. Mary Emma inherited less than $300; her appeal to the East India Company for a portion of her father's pension was refused.

Lynn, Walter (1677/8-1763), physician and inventor of a fire engine, was born at Southwick House, near Oundle, Northamptonshire, the third son of George Lynn (1647/8-1682), and Mary (died 1722), eldest daughter of Walter Johnson, of Spalding, Lincolnshire. He had a twin sister, and was the younger brother of the astronomer George Lynn. He went to school at Spalding, and then to Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1695 (BA 1699, MB 1704). He was in York in 1710, and published 'An Essay towards a More Easie and Safe Method of Cure in the Small Pox' (1714), in which he described his own case of the disease. He produced a further work on smallpox in 1715. Lynn lodged for a time in Daker Street, Westminster, and said he had a sincere intention to serve the public, particularly ladies and the gentry, but found this impossible, partly because of his poor constitution. In addition, he had no licence to practise physic in London and, although advised by John Mapletoft to get a licence, did not feel fit to do so. 
Lynn therefore diverted himself with mechanics and the performance of music. In 1712 he was elected an extra regular member of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding. He wrote a satire 'Nyktopsia, or, The Use and Abuse of Snuffers' (1726), and in the same year printed 'The case of Walter Lynn, M.B., in relation to divers undertakings of his, particularly for the improvement of an engine to raise water by fire'. This was to be an improvement on Captain Thomas Savory's engine, and Lynn hoped for but did not get a reward from parliament. 'The Case' does not say what the improvements were. Lynn had submitted his invention to Isaac Newton, Christopher Wren, Wren's son, and Brook Taylor. Despite the backing of Christopher Wren, among others, Lynn was disappointed in his hope that the Royal Society would try out his engine. He denied that if his engine lessened the expense of fuel, Newcastle trade would be less, and seamen's employment diminished. 
Lynn said others found him 'morose, lazy, discontented and melancholy' (Axon, 241). He died in March 1763, apparently aged eighty-five, and was buried on 19 March at Grantham, Lincolnshire.

Lynne, Walter (d. in or before 1571), publisher and translator, was a native of Antwerp, and seems to have been active as a publisher in the Netherlands. A Wouter van Lin is known to have issued in Antwerp two editions of Gassar's 'Cronycke' in 1533 and 1534, and of Erasmus's 'Bereydinghe tot der doot' in the latter year. About 1540 he moved to London, where he quickly established a comfortable prosperity. Having settled in Billingsgate, he was assessed on goods of a value of 20's'. in 1541; by 1549 this had risen to $10, placing Lynne among the most substantial members of the alien community. Lynne is not known to have worked in the book trade during the reign of Henry VIII, but he was quick to appreciate the new opportunities that opened with the accession of Edward VI. The new reign brought a large increase in the volume of books printed in England, mostly vernacular protestant works, and Lynne soon established a place in the forefront of this trade. On 1 December 1547 he was granted a seven-year patent for the sole printing of 'The Beginning and Endynge of All Popery', which he had Englished from a German translation of 'Vaticinia, sive, Prophetiae', by Joachimus, abbot of Fiore. Between 1548 and 1550 at least twenty-one books were published under Lynne's imprint. He was a publisher rather than a printer, employing the presses of a variety of colleagues in the expanding printing industry, most prominently two fellow Dutch immigrants, Nicolas Hill (Van den Berghe) and Steven Mierdman. Many of the books published for Lynne bear his distinctive mark, a ram and goat with the initials W. L. He also ran his own bookshop in St Paul's Churchyard, the centre of the London trade. 
Lynne's special area of expertise was the publication in English of books by the continental reformers. Among his editions were popular works of Luther, Bullinger, Bernardine Ochino, and Urbanus Rhegius. Many were his own translations -- others were contributed by prominent English protestants such as John Poynet and Thomas Norton. In his translation of Carion's 'Chronicles' Lynne indeed described himself as 'one that spendeth all his tyme in the setting forth of books in the English tongue'. Lynne had been generously treated by leading members of the Edwardian protestant elite, and these debts were acknowledged in the gracious letters of dedication with which he prefaced several of his works. Carion's 'Chronicles' was one of two books dedicated to Edward VI, and there were dedications to the king's sister, Elizabeth, and three (the largest number) to Anne, duchess of Somerset. In 'The True Belief in Christ and his Sacraments', dedicated to the duchess, Lynne expressed the wish that all men would read it: 'not as they have been heretofore accustomed to read the fained stories of Robin Hood, Clem of the clough with such like... but to put away their new errors (grounded upon the Romish rock) by the knowledge of the old faith that is builded upon the foundations of the prophets and apostles.' In his translation of Bullinger's sermon on magistracy Lynne presented his work as a direct acknowledgement of the gracious reception he had received in England. He told Edward VI: 'Considering what great benefits I have receyved of thys your majesties realm of England which hath so many years nourished and succoured my poorlife hitherto. I thought myself no less bound of very duty by to show some office of recompension thereto.' Other, less happy, personal experience might also inform these dedications, such as the bereavement which he says prompted him to publish 'A brief collecion of all such texts of the scripture as do declare the most blessed and happy estate of them that are visited with sickness'. To what is here referred is unclear. Lynne and his wife, Anna (died in or after 1571), joined the Dutch church in 1550. A daughter, Katherine, attended catechism class in the Dutch church; perhaps it was the death of a sibling which sent Lynne in search of consolation literature. 
Lynne clearly enjoyed a measure of patronage from the Edwardian regime, since two editions of Cranmer's 'Catechism' are numbered among his publications. He was also expanding his business enterprises to other forms of trade, such as the import of wine and hops. In June 1549 he received a licence to import 800 tuns of Gascon wine. With his other ventures prospering, Lynne was by 1550 able to withdraw from publishing, and after this year no books were published with his sponsorship. On the death of Edward VI he reconciled himself to the change in regime and remained in England. This was unsurprising -- although Lynne had joined the new Dutch church in 1550, he was not close to the church hierarchy, in contrast to his Dutch printing colleagues Hill and Van der Erve, who both served as elders. Not surprisingly therefore it was Hill and Mierdman who were rewarded with the official commissions of the foreign churches, whereas the most assimilated Lynne was overlooked. This probably concerned Lynne little, since by this stage his time as a publisher was drawing to a close. He lived on in Billingsgate ward until his death some time before 1571, when his wife, Anna, described as a widow, was assessed for taxation. Although his period of activity in the London printing industry was relatively short, Lynne was nevertheless an important figure, not least for the part he played in the injection of capital and expertise from the more sophisticated continental centres of publishing, particularly Antwerp, during this critical period, when the London printing industry entered a new phase of its sixteenth-century development.

Lyon, Agnes (1762-1840), poet, eldest daughter of John Ramsay L'Amy (or Lammie) of Dunkenny, Forfarshire, and his wife, Agnes Hamilton, was born at Dundee early in 1762. On 25 January 1786 she married the Revd Dr James Lyon of Glamis, Forfarshire, with whom she had ten children. 
Agnes Lyon wrote humorous poetry, mostly on domestic subjects, for her own pleasure and that of her family. She claimed that she rarely made corrections or allowed her writing to interfere with the running of her household: 'She ne'er neglected house affair,/Nor put her little babes aside,/To take on Pegasus a ride' (Rogers, 2.85). She directed at her death that her manuscripts should remain unprinted, unless the family needed pecuniary assistance. She has chiefly been remembered for the song beginning 'You've surely heard of famous Niel', written at the request of Niel Gow for his air, 'Farewell to Whisky'. She died on 14 September 1840.

Lyon, George Francis (1795-1832), naval officer and explorer, son of a colonel in the army, was born at Chichester, Sussex. Around 1805 he was educated at Dr Burney's naval academy, Gosport, Hampshire, and entered the navy in 1808, had the commission of lieutenant confirmed in 1814, and saw much action. 
Lyon was at Malta in September 1818 when Joseph Ritchie, secretary to the consul in Paris, arrived there on his way to Tripoli to begin his attempt to reach central Africa from the north. Captain Frederick Marryat, who was to accompany Ritchie, proved unable to do so, and Lyon volunteered to take his place, by his own admission purely from a wish to rise in his profession. In November Lyon joined Ritchie at Tripoli. He already had some knowledge of Arabic, and for the next four months studied the language and religious and social customs of the Arabs, adopting the alias Said-ben-Abdallah. After long delays at Tripoli and a short expedition to the Gharian Mountains, they and a servant, transparently disguised as Muslims, left Tripoli for Murzuq, the capital of Fezzan, the bey of which supported the expedition. Lyon suffered from dysentery and the extreme heat, and on 20 November 1819 Ritchie died. Lyon, in poor health and the victim of Ritchie's mismanagement of the whole expedition, pushed on to Tajarhi, and thence managed to reach Tripoli in March 1820, and London in July 1820. The account of his and Ritchie's journey was published as 'A Narrative of Travels in North Africa' (1821), illustrated from Lyon's own drawings. 
Lyon was promoted commander in 1821, and appointed to the 'Hecla' under the orders of Captain William Edward Parry in the 'Fury'. The expedition, Parry's second in the search for the north-west passage, sailed on 8 May 1821, entered the Arctic region through Hudson Strait, examined Repulse Bay and the neighbouring coast of Melville peninsula, and wintered at a small island to the eastward of the Frozen Strait. The next summer they went further north and entered Fury and Hecla Strait, but the season being then far advanced they turned back, wintered at Igloolik (lat. 69 degree 21' N, long. 81 degree 44' W), and came home in autumn 1823, as signs of scurvy among the crew made it inadvisable to stay. On 13 November Lyon was promoted captain, and the following year he published 'The private journal of Captain G. F. Lyon... during the recent voyage of discovery under Captain Parry' (1824). In January 1824 he was appointed to the 'Griper', which had been on Parry's first voyage of 1819. Lyon's instructions were to reach Repulse Bay by whatever route he judged best, and from it to examine the coast of the mainland westward to the point where John Franklin's voyage had ended its survey. He sailed on 6 June, but the season proved unfavourable, and he returned to England in November, to publish 'A brief narrative of an unsuccessful attempt to reach Repulse bay through Sir Thomas Rowe's Welcome' (1825). 
In June 1825 the University of Oxford conferred on Lyon an honorary DCL; and on 5 September he married Lucy Louisa (died 'c'.September 1826), elder daughter of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Shortly afterwards he went to Mexico as one of the commissioners of the English Compania de Real del Monte, which mined silver there. On the voyage home his ship was wrecked at Holyhead on 14 January 1827. Most of Lyon's papers and mineral specimens were lost, as he mentions in his 'Journal of a Residence and Tour in... Mexico' (2 vols., 1828). When he landed he received news of the death of his wife four months earlier. He afterwards went to South America on mining business, but finding his sight rapidly failing -- the result apparently of an attack of ophthalmia in Africa -- he set out for England to obtain medical advice. He died on board the 'Emulous', sailing from Buenos Aires, on 8 October 1832.

Lyon, Hart (1721-1800), rabbi, was born in Rzeszow, Poland, the son of Rabbi Aryeh Loeb ben Saul (1690-1755), a man of distinguished rabbinical lineage who was sometimes known by the surname Loewenstamm, and his wife, Miriam (died 1753), daughter of Rabbi Zevi Hirsch ben Jacob, surnamed Ashkenazi (1660-1718). The latter, known as Hakham ('Sage') Zevi, was a renowned authority on Jewish law who, as rabbi of Altona and later of Amsterdam, was consulted by the Great Synagogue in Duke's Place, London, on controversial points during its formative years and visited London in 1714. Having attended a 'yeshivah' (rabbinical academy) between about 1736 and 1745 in Glogau, where his father had been rabbi before moving to Amsterdam, Hirsch Loebel (as he was then called) devoted himself to the full-time study of traditional Jewish texts and, unusually for the time, Hebrew grammar. In 1751, when the celebrated theological dispute between Jacob Emden and Jonathan Eybeschutz had begun, he issued a pamphlet supporting the position of Emden, who was Hakham Zevi's son. 
Hirsch Loebel's reputation as a Talmudist, together with the congregation's well-remembered association with his much respected grandfather, persuaded the Great Synagogue in 1756 to appoint him to its pulpit following the death in office of Rabbi Aaron Hart. He assumed his duties early in 1757, and while serving the congregation was known as Hart Lyon, the literal translations of his forename and patronymic. His appointment heralded a period of co-operation between London's two Ashkenazi congregations, for the Hambro Synagogue agreed to pay $100 of his annual salary of $250 and looked to him for guidance on matters affected by Jewish law. Similarly, a group of Jews who -- to the consternation of the Great Synagogue authorities -- founded a third Ashkenazi congregation in the capital in 1761, recognized Lyon's authority on such issues, and sought his approval of the man they chose to be their rabbi. Lyon thus enjoyed a status which foreshadowed the position of chief rabbi, created later in the century. 
However, Lyon was deeply unhappy with the state of Jewish observance and education in London and with British Jewry's acculturationist impulse. In sermon after sermon, often characterized by some ninety minutes' discussion of the 'Talmud' augmented by a homily of comparable duration, he admonished his congregants for their religious laxity and eagerness to imitate the habits and fashions of gentile society. Tensions between Lyon and the Great Synagogue's lay leaders were perhaps evident in their extraordinary denial of his request to be allowed publicly to refute allegations made by Jacob Kimchi, a pious Jewish peddler from Turkey. In a pamphlet published at Altona in 1760 Kimchi accused the officials who, under Lyon's jurisdiction, supervised ritual slaughtering arrangements in London, of disregarding the letter of Jewish law. The Great Synagogue's decision rankled, and, frustrated by his congregants' indifference towards Jewish learning, Lyon set up a continental-style 'bet midrash' (house of study) in his home and spent an increasing amount of his time there. His accomplishments as a scholar were better appreciated on the continent, and he possibly regretted taking the London offer in preference to a slightly earlier one from Dubno in Poland. 
In 1763, thoroughly disillusioned with London Jewry, Lyon accepted a call to be rabbi of Halberstadt, and left the Great Synagogue in the spring of the following year. Lyon's cousin, Israel Meshullam Zalman Emden, hoped to succeed him, but had to be satisfied instead with the pulpit of the Hambro Synagogue, where he was called Meshullam Solomon. In 1770 Lyon, known as Hirsch Lewin, became rabbi of Mannheim, and in 1773 of Berlin, where he remained for the rest of his life. Although opposed to the more extreme manifestations of Jewish enlightenment thought which were circulating among Berlin's Jews, he collaborated with Moses Mendelssohn in preparing a book on aspects of Jewish law which appeared in 1778 as 'Ritualgesetze der Juden'. His commentary on the classic Jewish text 'Pirke Avot' ('Chapters of the fathers') was published posthumously in 1834. He also wrote Hebrew poems, some of which were printed. 
Lyon and his wife, Golde ('fl'. 1720-1800), daughter of David Tevele Cohen, a leader of the Jewish community in Glogau, had six children: the controversial scholar Rabbi Saul Berliner, who died in London on 19 June 1790 after fleeing Berlin accused of forging rabbinical texts; Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschell; Abraham David Tevele Berliner, a merchant; and daughters Sarah, Reisel, and Beilah, whose knowledge of the 'Talmud' and attainments in Hebrew testify to her father's enlightened attitude towards the religious education of girls. Lyon died in Berlin in 1800 and was buried there. 
During his ministry at the Great Synagogue Lyon sat for his portrait in oils by James Turner; it was subsequently engraved by Edward Fisher and sold as a print at Cornhill under the title 'The most Learned High Priest Hart Lyon, Rabbi London'. The department of prints and drawings at the British Museum has an impression of Fisher's mezzotint, but Turner's painting, which used to hang in the Great Synagogue, is believed to have been destroyed in the blitz.

Lyon, Sir James Frederick (1775-1842), army officer, a descendant of the Lyons, lords Glamis, was son of Captain James Lyon (died 1775), 35th foot, and his wife Mary (later Mrs George Coke), daughter of James Hamilton of Ballencrieff, East Lothian, and great-great-grandson of Sir Patrick Lyon of Carse (1637-1694). He was born on board a transport ship homeward bound from America after the battle of Bunker Hill, where his father had been killed. On 4 August 1791 he was appointed ensign, 25th foot (later King's Own Scottish Borderers). He became lieutenant on 26 April 1793, captain on 5 April 1795, major on 21 February 1799, brevet-colonel in 1811, major-general in 1814, and lieutenant-general in 1830. 
Lyon served with detachments of the 25th as marines on board the 'Gibraltar' (80 guns, Captain Mackenzie) and the 'Marlborough' (74 guns, Captain Hon. George Berkeley) in the Channel Fleet under Earl Howe. He was present at the actions of 27 and 29 May, and the great victory of 1 June 1794. He afterwards served with his regiment in the island of Grenada during the reign of terror there, when Governor Home and all the principal white inhabitants were massacred by the slaves. He was on Lord George Lennox's staff at Plymouth in 1797-8, and was subsequently aide-de-camp to the Hon. Sir Charles Steuart at Minorca. In 1799 he was appointed to a foreign corps, originally known as 'Stuart's', or the Minorca regiment, raised in that island by Sir John Stuart (afterwards count of Maida), with Lyon and Nicholas Trant as majors. The corps was successively known as the Queen's German regiment and the 97th (Queen's), and was disbanded as the 96th (Queen's) in 1818. Lyon was with it in 1801 in Egypt, where it was engaged with Bonaparte's 'invincibles' at the battle of 21 March 1801, and was highly distinguished. Lyon subsequently commanded the regiment in the Peninsula from 1808 to 1811 at Vimeiro, Talavera, Busaco, and the first siege of Badajoz. In June 1813 he was sent to Germany to assist in organizing the new Hanoverian levies (distinct from the King's German Legion), and he was present at the operations in the north of Germany in 1813-14, under the prince royal of Sweden. He led a division of Hanoverians at the battle of Gohrde in Hanover, on 13 September 1813, and afterwards was in charge of a mixed force of Russians, Hanoverians, and Hanseatics, under Count von Benningsen, which blockaded Hamburg. He commanded the 6th Hanoverian brigade during the Waterloo campaign and the advance to Paris. The brigade was with the reserve near Hal on 18 June, and did not engage. Lyon commanded the inland district in 1817, and he led the troops in the Windward and Leeward islands, with headquarters at Barbados, in 1828-33. He was promised the governorship of Gibraltar, but was disappointed. Lyon was a KCB and KCH (1815), GCH (1817), and had the orders of the Sword in Sweden and Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria, with gold medals for Egypt, Vimeiro and Talavera, and the Hanoverian and Waterloo medals. He was colonel of the 24th foot, and equerry to the duke of Cambridge. 
Lyon married Anne, daughter of Edward Coxe of Hampstead, and niece of the Revd George Coxe (his stepfather), Peter Coxe (1753?-1844), and Archdeacon William Coxe (1748-1828), the historian. Lyon lived latterly at Grosvenor Lodge, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and died at Brighton on 16 October 1842.

Lyon, John, seventh Lord Glamis (b. c.1521, d. in or before 1559), nobleman, was the son of John Lyon, sixth Lord Glamis (died 1528), and his wife, Janet Douglas (died 1537), second daughter of George Douglas, master of Angus, and sister of Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus. The seventh lord was still a minor when he succeeded his father in 1528. 
In July 1537 Lyon and his mother, who had married as her second husband Archibald Campbell of Skipness, and Lyon's brother George and several others were apprehended on charges of conspiring to poison James V. These charges against Lady Glamis and her family probably originated in the family's close connection to the Douglases. In addition a long-standing dispute over the ward of the earldom of Erroll, sold by the sixth Lord Glamis to George Leslie, fourth earl of Rothes, in 1527, and over the ward of the lordship of Glamis itself, purchased by Rothes in the following year, may have created enmity between the latter and the Lyons, and encouraged Rothes to conspire against Lady Glamis and her family, not only to vindicate a reputation which was under shadow at court, but also to end the dispute in his favour and to his own financial gain. Lady Glamis was tried, convicted of treason, and publicly executed. Lyon was himself tried on 18 July 1537 on a charge of concealing his mother's conspiracy and was condemned to death, but since he was a minor, aged sixteen, his execution was deferred, and he remained a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle at the crown's expense. He later claimed that he had been misled into making a confession on the understanding that his lands would not be forfeit. 
Lyon's estates were forfeited, however, and annexed to the crown on 3 December 1540. The king had been distributing the Glamis lands among his friends from September 1537 and continued the grants until 1542. Lyon was released from prison following James's death on 14 December that year, and his lands and title were restored to him by act of parliament on 15 March 1543. On 6 February 1544 he married Janet Keith, daughter of Robert, Lord Keith, and sister of the third Earl Marischal; they had two sons, John Lyon, who became eighth Lord Glamis, and Thomas Lyon, who was master of Glamis for much of his life, and also one daughter, Margaret. It took several years to recover all the Glamis lands, most notably those in the barony of Kinghorn, gifted to James Kirkcaldy of Grange and not recovered until after William Kirkcaldy's forfeiture in September 1548 for his part in the murder of Cardinal Beaton. 
In the early years of Queen Mary's minority Glamis was most closely associated with the opponents of the queen mother, Mary of Guise, and the cardinal. He supported the earl of Arran's flirtation with protestant preaching in 1543 and allowed the former Dominican friar John Rough to preach at Glamis kirk. Mary of Guise anticipated a reconciliation with Glamis in 1544, but it appears that he remained in opposition to the pro-French orientation of the regime for another two years. Between 1546 and 1547 he sat on the privy council on four occasions, and in November 1547 he was present at the siege of Broughty Castle, then occupied by English forces. 
Thereafter Glamis disappears from public life. There is a charter to him dated at Glamis on 4 October 1548, and he was served heir to his grandmother, Elizabeth Gray, countess of Huntly, in 1549. On 17 April 1550 his eldest son was infeft in the family estates, reserving a liferent to the parents. He 'spent his latter years abroad, where having contracted a sickness he came home' ('Scots peerage', 8.283). He had died before 18 September 1559, when John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl, had a gift of the ward.

Lyon, John, eighth Lord Glamis (c.1544-1578), nobleman and administrator, was the eldest son of John Lyon, seventh Lord Glamis (b. c.1521, d. in or before 1559), and Janet, daughter of Robert Keith, Lord Keith, and sister of the fourth Earl Marischal. He succeeded to the lordship on the death of his father in 1558, inheriting with it the extensive possessions acquired by successive generations of the Glamis family. These territories were largely concentrated in Angus (Forfarshire), where by the sixteenth century they had been erected into a burgh of barony, giving their lords widespread power and influence in that county. In 1561 Glamis married Elizabeth (died 'c'.1581), daughter of William Abernethy, fifth Lord Saltoun. They had four children, a son, Patrick, who became ninth Lord Glamis, and three daughters: Elizabeth, who married Patrick, sixth Lord Gray and, after divorcing him, William Ker, son of the redoubtable Sir Thomas Ker of Ferniehurst; Jean, who married successively Robert Douglas the younger of Lochleven, Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus, and Alexander Lindsay, first Lord Spynie; and Sibilla, who appears to have remained unmarried. 
Glamis was certainly a participant in the tortuous and violent events of the 1560s, if in a mainly unspectacular way. Thus in 1565 he supported Mary's marriage to Darnley, but shortly afterwards showed his approval of the earl of Moray's subversive actions against the queen by taking part in the so-called chaseabout raid against her in August of that year. In February 1567 he was in Edinburgh at the time of Darnley's murder, but there has never been any suggestion that he was involved in that affair. Thereafter, he was initially in favour of Bothwell marrying Mary and was present at their wedding. But like many other noblemen he became disillusioned with Bothwell, and after Mary's forcible abdication in 1567 he became a member of the king's party. Its leader, Moray, now appointed him a privy councillor, and for the next decade he was seldom missing from the council's meetings. 
Following Moray's assassination in January 1570 Glamis was a pallbearer at his funeral in St Giles's, Edinburgh. He received further promotion when the new regent, the earl of Lennox, appointed him an extraordinary lord of session. However, it was to be during the regency of his distant kinsman, James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton (they were first cousins, once removed), that the career of Glamis really took off. He had had experience of Morton in 1571 when the pair of them had acted as commissioners in talks between the Scottish and English governments held at Berwick, and when Morton was installed as regent in November 1572 Glamis quickly emerged as a key figure in his government. Thus, in February 1573, following the regent's settlement with the Hamilton and Gordon families known as the pacification of Perth, Glamis became one of the three officials responsible for mediating in any disputes which arose north of the River Tay. Later that year he reached the pinnacle of his career when, on the death of the fifth earl of Argyll, he became chancellor, on 12 October 1573. He was notably active the following year, when in August 1574 he accompanied Morton to the north-east of Scotland in an expedition designed for 'the establishment of justice and punishment of disordouris and enormittis attemptit aganis our Soverane Lordis authoritie' ('Reg. PCS', 2.388). 
Glamis was also closely involved in executing the regent's ecclesiastical policy. Here, the return from abroad of the fiery Andrew Melville posed a distinct challenge to Morton, who in March 1575 appointed the chancellor to head a committee responsible for drafting an acceptable church settlement. In an attempt at finding a solution to this question, in 1576 Glamis contacted Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor at Geneva. However the latter's reply, attacking bishops and emphasizing the separate authority of the kirk, was not one likely to have appealed either to the regent or to his commissioner. 
March 1578 was a climactic month for Glamis. On the 10th Morton's resignation as regent was confirmed by a royal proclamation at Stirling, while exactly one week later, on 17 March 1578, the chancellor himself was killed in a street brawl in the same town. The role played by Glamis in the temporary overthrow of Morton is debatable. On the one hand Calderwood and Hume of Godscroft claim that the chancellor joined Morton's opponents as soon as the crisis occurred. Certainly there is some evidence that Sir Thomas Lyon of Baldukie, the brother of Glamis, was involved in the negotiations for the regent's dismissal. On the other hand, on the day before Glamis was killed Morton wrote to him confidentially, asking him to use his influence with the boy king on his behalf. And on hearing of the death of Glamis, the ex-regent commented that it was 'an unhappy chance quhilk no doubt is to my great greif' (Thomson, Macdonald, and Innes, 1.105). Certainly, there is nothing here to suggest that Morton felt aggrieved at, or betrayed by, Glamis in 1578. Glamis's death came as a result of a scuffle between his own followers and those of David Lindsay, eleventh earl of Crawford, as they passed each other in the narrow streets of Stirling. Glamis was shot through the head, possibly, as Hume of Godscroft suggests, because he was 'a tall man of stature and higher than the rest' (Hume, 2.255). 
A somewhat elusive figure in modern eyes, Glamis was undoubtedly highly regarded by contemporaries and by seventeenth-century historians. Thus Andrew Melville composed a Latin epigram to his memory, while the English ambassador observed that he was 'very wise and discreet but of no party or favour' ('CSP Scot.', '1574-81', 253). In the following century David Calderwood described Glamis as 'a learned, godly and wise man' (Calderwood, 3.397), but the best obituary notice is perhaps that of Bishop John Spottiswoode, who commented that 'the death of the chancellor was much lamented falling out in the time when the king and country stood in most need of his service' ('History of the Church', 2.283).

Lyon, John (1514?-1592), founder of Harrow School, was the son of John Lyon (died 1534) and his wife, Joan; the family owned land in Preston near Harrow. A man of substance, by 1562 John Lyon had the largest rental in Harrow. He had a long-standing interest in education, having for many years spent 20 marks a year on the education of thirty poor children. In February 1572 he obtained a royal charter for the foundation of a free grammar school for boys at Harrow. He bought lands in Marylebone to be held by himself, his wife, and the governors of his school, the rents to be applied to road repairs on the Harrow and Edgware roads. In 1579 it was proposed that Lyon should pay $50 as a loan to the state but the attorney-general, Sir Gilbert Gerard (a trustee and governor), intervened, arguing that paying would involve selling lands that would otherwise have been used to maintain the school. No buildings were erected until after the death of Lyon's widow, Joan, in 1608 when money was made available according to his instructions. 
In 1591 Lyon drew up statutes for the future conduct of the school. The governors were to appoint the master and usher who were to be paid $20 and $10 per annum. They had to behave themselves well and neither was permitted to marry. $300 was to be set aside to construct a building for the school and to house the schoolmasters; additional funds were provided for heating. Thirty good and learned sermons were to be preached annually at the rate of 6's'. 8died per sermon, $20 per annum was to be distributed annually among the poorest families, and $20 given to four poor scholars to enable them to study at Oxford and Cambridge. To be admitted to the second form boys had to be able to write out sentences before they could learn how to translate English into Latin. The statutes laid down in detail the curriculum to be taught over five years, which consisted of mainly Latin authors with some Greek for the fifth form, together with the catechism, Lord's prayer, ten commandments, and the articles of faith. The schoolmaster was to be responsible for the conduct of his charges, severely punishing lying, stealing, fighting, and filthiness, although the rod was only to be used moderately. Play was permitted on Thursdays and occasionally on Sundays, and archery was encouraged. The governors were to provide all the library books needed, but the parents were to supply paper, ink, pens, books, and candles for the winter. 
Building began after Joan Lyon's death but the cost was more than double that envisaged in the statutes and took until 1615 to complete. The first scholar was elected to university in 1617. At first the value of John Lyon's funds were barely sufficient to cover the cost of maintaining the school, but subsequent changes in land values altered the situation entirely. The development of Harrow from a free grammar school into a public school was made possible by a clause in the statutes which permitted the master to admit boys from outside the parish if there was space and the governors agreed. By the beginning of the nineteenth century it was considered that there were so many 'foreigners' that parishioners were deterred from sending their own children. Following the report of the Clarendon commission in 1864 and the 'Public School Act' of 1868 the Harrow School governors in 1874 created the lower school of John Lyon which by the early twentieth century had become autonomous. The fund originally intended for road maintenance was handed over for other charitable purposes in 1991 and in 1999 was still actively supporting education. John Lyon died on 3 October 1592, and was buried in Harrow church, where a brass memorial tablet was later erected to both him and his wife.

Lyon, John, of Auldbar (fl. 1608-1649), poet, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Lyon of Auldbar and his first wife, Agnes (1540?-1586?), daughter of Patrick, Lord Gray, and widow of Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig, and Alexander, fifth Lord Home. He was declared heir to his father on 6 August 1608. Subsequently he was frequently imprisoned for debt. On 16 February 1611, he married Eupham, a daughter of George Gladstanes, archbishop of St Andrews, but died childless. He is last mentioned in 1649, in the records of the commissary court of Brechin, as a citizen there; the date of his death is unknown. 
Lyon has been identified with the author of 'Teares for the Death of Alexander, Earle of Dunfermeling', a poem of about 250 lines, printed by Andro Hart in 1622, and reprinted by the Bannatyne Club in 1823. The one copy of the original print known to exist is held in the Huntington Library. In the dedication to Lady Beatrix Ruthven, Lady Cowdenknowes, daughter of the first earl of Gowrie, the poet states that he is related to her by 'band of blood', and signs himself 'your Ladiships Cousen, most humblie devoted to serue you, John Lyoun.' This may be explained by the relationship between the lady's husband, Home of Cowdenknowes, and Lyon of Auldbar's mother, by her marriage to Lord Home.

John Lyon, ninth earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (1737-1776), landowner, was born on 17 July 1737, the son of Thomas Lyon, eighth earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne ('bap'. 1704, died 1753), and Jean Nicholson (1713-1778). Strathmore was an honest, good-natured, and uncomplicated man, who played no role in public life apart from being one of Scotland's representative peers. It took eighteen months to negotiate the marriage contract, during which time Mary Eleanor realized that he and she had nothing in common. He had no interest in literary or intellectual matters, and she certainly did not want to settle down to a quiet life on his Scottish estates. Too proud to admit her mistake, she married him in St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 26 February 1767, two days after her eighteenth birthday.

Lyon, John (1710-1790), Church of Ireland clergyman and antiquary, was the son of John Lyon, a blacksmith or ironmonger, and his wife, Sarah; who lived at the poorer end of Stephen Street in Dublin; he was probably born and was baptized on 5 October 1710 at St Bride's. Admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1724, as a pensioner, he was elected scholar in 1727, received his BA in 1729, his MA in 1732, and his DD eventually in 1751. His modesty and discretion gained him the patronage of Swift, who prized such qualities in young clergymen, as early as 1736. With Swift's help Lyon became a curate at St Bride's (October 1737) and a minor canon at St Patrick's Cathedral (July 1740). By this time, at Swift's request, Lyon had moved into the deanery to keep Swift's accounts, serve as his almoner and amanuensis, and generally 'to have an Eye upon him and his Affairs on Account of his departing Memory' (Lyon, 'Materials', facing p. 124). From Swift or his executors he received a large portion of Swift's private papers. In 1743 he also inherited the papers of Rebecca Dingley, the companion of Esther Johnson and co-recipient of the letters from Swift published as the 'Journal to Stella'. Eventually Lyon disposed of most of his Swift letters, including those from the 'Journal', for publication in additional volumes of John Hawkesworth's edition of Swift's works (1766). Some of the remaining manuscripts later passed to Sir Walter Scott for use in his own Swift edition (1814). In 1765, for George Faulkner's projected quarto edition of Swift, which was never published, Lyon wrote his 'Materials for a life of Dr. Swift', arguably the most reliable of all early accounts of the dean, comprising extensive additions and corrections entered in a loosely interleaved copy of an earlier life by Hawkesworth. This volume next passed to the London editor John Nichols, who, without knowing its author or title, published Lyon's work in his 1779 supplementary volume to the Hawkesworth edition of Swift. By then a quarter of Lyon's original interleaved pages were missing, and several more were lost before the volume finally came into the possession of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The missing sections were published after the discovery in 1997 of a near complete early transcript. 
Lyon passed most of his later career at the two Dublin churches where he began. St Bride's he served as incumbent after 1764, and at St Patrick's he was successively prebendary of Rathmichael (1751-64), Tassagard (1771-87), and Mulhuddart (1787-90). From its inception in 1746 he served as secretary to the governors of St Patrick's Hospital, founded under Swift's will, and was elected a governor in 1773. A gifted antiquary, he built up an extensive archive of notes relating to Irish church history, using records that have since been largely destroyed. Much of his collection was later dispersed. 'Although Dr. Lyon did not, himself, publish any work on the subject of Irish antiquities,' William Monck Mason remarked in 1819, 'there is no one to whom the Irish antiquarian is more indebted; to his diligence we chiefly owe the preservation of whatever remains of the ecclesiastical antiquities of Dublin' (Mason, lxiii). At St Mary's, Dublin, on 12 January 1754, Lyon married Sarah Hatfield (died February 1790), who apparently brought him a modest fortune and some connections in the church hierarchy. He died, without surviving issue, in Dublin in June 1790 and was buried on the 12th in St Patrick's churchyard.

Lyon, John (1734-1817), Church of England clergyman and antiquary, was born on 1 September 1734 at St Nicholas in the Isle of Thanet, the son of the village blacksmith. Early on he exhibited a determination to improve his mind, taking a slate and books with him when minding cattle at St Nicholas Court Farm, before being apprenticed to Mr Coleman, an intelligent shoemaker in the village who was also the local doctor. About 1760 he was engaged as an assistant at a school in Margate owned by Michael Trapps (died 1766), whom he succeeded as principal in 1766. Lyon compiled the first guidebook to the Isle of Thanet, 'A Description of the Isle of Thanet, and Particularly of the Town of Margate', published in 1763, when Margate had been a pioneering seaside resort for less than thirty years. In introducing prospective holidaymakers to the facilities and interesting places in the locality he provided a valuable source for the early history of the seaside resort. 
Lyon learned Greek and Latin from the vicar of St Peter's, Thanet, who assisted his admission to holy orders in 1770. He combined the curacy of Minster in Thanet with his school until 1772, when he was elected by the parishioners to the perpetual curacy of St Mary's, Dover. His studies also embraced electricity, antiquities, and botany. He never married and lived frugally, wedded to his writing desk and his electrical experiments. His principal work was 'The history of the town and port of Dover, and of Dover Castle: with a short account of the Cinque Ports' (2 vols., 1813-14). Although there were earlier specific studies of the castle and harbour, Lyon produced the most comprehensive history of Dover to date, having already researched and published a history of the castle in 1787. In devoting 264 out of a total of 756 pages to the castle, plus original engravings and plans, he provided a unique piece of scholarship, especially as subsequent Dover historians bemoaned the loss or destruction of the castle records. One such historian, John Bavington Jones, wrote that he had been forced 'to follow the track of earlier historians' (Jones, preface). 
Lyon, who was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, submitted two papers to the society: the first in 1775 described a Roman bath discovered in Dover ('Archaeologia', 5, 325-34), and the second in 1792 contained observations of the site of the ancient Portus Iccius ('Archaeologia', 10, 1-16). A letter to John Nichols in 1785 on the history of St Radigund's, or Bradsole Abbey, was printed in 'Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica', and his account of William Tothall FSA, which he communicated to his fellow antiquary Andrew Coltee Ducarel, found its way into print in Nichols's 'Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth'. The Kentish historian Edward Hasted acknowledged his debt to Lyon for much information relating to Dover and its neighbourhood. Indeed in a letter of 6 April 1799 Lyon updated information supplied in 1791 and 1792 on the eve of publication of the fourth volume of the first folio edition of Hasted's 'The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent'. Lyon also published four works on electricity, including one on the effects of lightning, and submitted to the Royal Society a notice 'Of a subsidence of the ground near Folkstone, on the coast of Kent' in 1786 ('Philosophical Transactions', 16.91). 
Much disabled by a fall in 1806, Lyon was voted an assistant by his parishioners. He suffered a gradual decay, a paralytic affliction that deprived him of movement and speech. He died in Dover on 30 June 1817 and was buried in July in the churchyard of his native parish of St Nicholas, Thanet. He left an estate reputedly worth $10,000 to his two sisters and five nephews and nieces. As requested, his executors destroyed his manuscripts and correspondence, but his collection of books, shells, insects, and minerals was sold by auction in November 1817.

Lyon, Sir Patrick, of Carse, Lord Carse (1637-1694), judge, was the son of Patrick Lyon of Carse and second cousin of Patrick Lyon, third earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. He was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 11 July 1671, having previously been a professor of philosophy at the University of St Andrews. A resident of Dundee, he has been credited with the erection of a sculptured stone to commemorate the Restoration, outside his home in Whitehall Close. He was appointed admiral-depute in November 1674, and on the death of Lord Nairn was nominated an ordinary lord of session, taking his seat, with the title Lord Carse, on 10 November 1683. On 20 February 1684 he succeeded Sir James Foulis of Colinton as one of the lords of justiciary, but was removed from his offices in 1688, apparently because of Jacobite sympathies. He acted as a commissioner of supply for Forfarshire in 1689 and 1690, as he had in 1685. He is said to have compiled a collection of the decisions of the court of session between 1682 and 1687, no longer identifiable, and a collection of genealogies, held by the National Library of Scotland, and used by Sir George Mackenzie in his work on the subject. He married, after 1684, Elizabeth, sister of William Gray of Invereightie and widow of Patrick Lyon of Brigton. Carse died on 4 January 1694, and in October 1695 his son Magister Patrick Lyon of Carse was declared his heir.

Lyon, Patrick, third earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (1643?-1695), nobleman, was probably born on 29 May 1643 (possibly 1642), the only son of John Lyon, second earl of Kinghorne (1596-1647?), and his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Maule (died 1659), only daughter of Patrick Maule, first earl of Panmure (1585-1661). He succeeded to the title of earl of Kinghorne at the age of four on the death of his father on 12 May 1647 (sometimes given as 1646). The late earl had spent a fortune engaging the covenanters' cause under Montrose; despite an act of parliament passed in his favour on 27 March 1647, this expense and a fine of $1000 imposed in 1654 by the 'Act of Grace' left the estate in serious financial trouble. The earl's widow had married George Livingston, third earl of Linlithgow, on 30 July 1650, and this eventually brought even greater difficulties. Nine years later, on the death of Lady Elizabeth, Linlithgow brought successful claims against the estate, which reduced Kinghorne to relative poverty. 
The loss of so much seems to have galvanized Kinghorne into regaining his family's position. Having completed his studies at the University of St Andrews, the young earl returned to his estate in 1660 and took stock. What he found were two large, empty houses whose entire contents had been sold off to satisfy creditors, chiefly the earl of Linlithgow. What could not be carried off was burdened with debt. Embarking on a strict regime of household control, Kinghorne paid off his father's debts within seven years. On 23 August 1662 he married Lady Helen Middleton (died 1708), second daughter of John Middleton, first earl of Middleton (c.1608-1674); Archbishop James Sharp performed the wedding ceremony in Holyrood Abbey. The couple moved into Castle Lyon (later known as Castle Huntly) in the Carse of Gowrie, and the earl quickly followed the current trend among the nobility for domestic modernization. 
A spectacular example of the craze for 'reforming' old houses was later provided in the rebuilding of Castle Glamis, to which the earl was able to move in 1670. From the mid-1670s Kinghorne was an ally of John Maitland, duke of Lauderdale, and, like him, was typical of the royalist aristocracy in his apparently conflicting emotions about his castellated home. These emotions are expressed in his 'Book of Record', together with careful details of the extensive building operations which employed him until 1689. On the one hand, he insisted 'that everie man who hes such houses would reform them, for who can delight to live in his house as in a prisone' (Lyon, earl of Strathmore, 33). Indeed, there was 'no man more against these old fashions of tours and castles than I am' (ibid., 19). Yet he was 'inflam'd stronglie with a great desyre to continue the memorie of my familie' by retaining 'my old Great Hall, which is a room that I ever loved'. His solution involved reorientating and extending the castle into a symmetrical V-plan, by adding a new western wing: both wings were given gables and the roofs were heightened to enhance an already 'romantic' profile. An entrance was set at the centre, and a new diagonally aligned series of courts was created. A quite ordinary tower house was thereby transformed into a composition of overpowering baroque dynamism -- a startling and (for Scotland) unprecedented solution. Of his design the earl wrote that 'tho it be an old house and consequentlie was the more difficult to reduce the place to any uniformitie yet I did covet extremely to order my building so that my frontispiece might have a resemblance on both syds' (ibid., 41). Internally, a new great apartment was formed in the expanded shell of the castle, and the 'old Great Hall' was converted into a drawing-room. Kinghorne designed the whole scheme himself, having decided not to 'call in... Public Architecturs' (ibid., 42). He was the last of the great self-taught noble architects, and his house is a fascinating expression of his character, romantic yet practical. A magnificent portrait (1683) by Jacob de Witt of the earl and his family reveals as much as any written account could. The luxuriantly wigged earl is pictured in Roman dress within a severely classical setting. His children are gathered round, with sleek hunting hounds in attendance. The earl raises his hand in the style of Marcus Aurelius to gesture at his house in the middle distance, and the viewer's gaze is drawn to Glamis in all its gemlike glory. The complementary cults of house, family, learning, and manliness are all proudly displayed. 
The basis of all Kinghorne's endeavours seems to have been the regaining of lost dignity. His title as third earl was a relatively new one (1606), limited to male heirs, and on 30 May 1672 he obtained a new charter enabling him to nominate a successor in the absence of male issue. On 1 July 1677 he managed to procure another charter giving his heirs and successors the titles of earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne, viscounts Lyon, and barons Glamis, Tannadyce, Sidlaw, and Strathdichtie. Strathmore's achievements were family-orientated, rather than on a national scale. After the Restoration he made a minor contribution to public affairs, and on 10 January 1682 he was sworn into the privy council. After the uprising of 1685 he provided stores for the army and carried out various other ancillary duties. He was rewarded with lands in Kintyre but these were soon taken back by the crown, and he obtained instead the post of extraordinary lord of session (27 March 1686) with a pension of $300. In 1688 he resisted his instinct to deny the claim of the prince of Orange, but thereafter he was suspected of Jacobite leanings, and in 1689 he was relieved of his office as lord of session. On 25 April 1690 Strathmore swore allegiance to King William, but this was the end of a relatively uneventful public life. He died at Castle Huntly (Castle Lyon) on 15 May 1695 and was buried in the family lair at his own fantastic creation, Glamis. He left three sons and two daughters; John Lyon, fourth earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (1663-1712), was a tory and an opponent of the treaty of union, who only escaped arrest as a suspected Jacobite because illness confined him to Glamis. The fifth earl, also John Lyon, took part in the 1715 uprising and was killed at Sheriffmuir.

Lyon, Sir Thomas, of Auldbar, master of Glamis (c.1546-1608), nobleman and administrator, was the second son of John Lyon, seventh Lord Glamis (b. c.1521, d. in or before 1559), and his wife, Jean, daughter of Robert Keith, master of Marischal; he was perhaps two years younger than his elder brother, John Lyon, later eighth Lord Glamis (c.1544-1578). The Lyon family held substantial lands in Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, and Fife, but their power base and main estates lay in Forfarshire. Descended from Robert II through the marriage of the latter's daughter Johanna to Sir John Lyon (died 1382), and closely linked through marriage and geographical proximity to the comital families of Angus, Argyll, Atholl, Huntly, and Rothes, the Lyon family was prominent in local and national politics from the 1360s onwards -- though not always in favour with the monarch. Thomas's father had been declared a traitor in 1537 and was forfeit until 1544. His brother John, Lord Glamis, backed Regent Moray against Mary, queen of Scots, from 1567, and was consistently loyal to the protestant regencies of Moray, Lennox, and Morton; on 8 October 1573 he was appointed chancellor of the kingdom in the name of James VI. These loyalties undoubtedly helped secure for Thomas Lyon, while he was still a young man, the post of attendant upon the infant James VI in Stirling Castle. Also around this period Thomas was slowly establishing a position for himself within his family's sphere of influence: in March 1567 he was presented by his elder brother to the Forfarshire chaplainry of Baikie (valued at under $10 a year), and in 1571 Glamis allowed him to purchase the estate of Scrogerfield (Thomas was a committed protestant who drew revenue from the chaplainry until at least 1576). 
On the violent death of the eighth lord on 17 March 1578 Thomas Lyon became responsible for the tutelage and upbringing of his nephew Patrick, ninth Lord Glamis (1575-1615), a position he held until 1596. Through traditional family influence, religious conviction, and individual force of personality, the master of Glamis (as he was called from his being his nephew's heir presumptive) was soon able to draw on long-established Lyon alliances in and around Forfarshire. He also used his considerable political abilities to manipulate his nephew's lordship so as to acquire significant additional estates and to expand his personal sphere of influence within Forfarshire (in December 1579 he had to lodge a security for $5000 that he would not impinge on the estates belonging to his sister-in-law and her daughter). Some time before 1575 he married Agnes (died 1580x86), daughter of Patrick Gray of Buttergask and sister of Patrick, fifth Lord Gray (and widow successively of Robert Logan of Restalrig and Alexander, fifth Lord Home). The marriage, which produced two daughters, caused an acrimonious dispute between the master and the family of his wife's previous husband, the Homes. Although Lyon was granted the right to act as keeper of Home Castle for the crown in November 1578, he was relieved of the post a month later, as Andrew Kerr, commendator of Jedburgh, had obtained possession and was unwilling to surrender. 
Building upon his local influence, Lyon expanded his involvement in the national arena: in March 1578 -- at the time when his elder brother was killed -- he was involved in the negotiations which secured the resignation of James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, as regent; and in 1582 he was one of the most prominent of the Ruthven raiders who undertook a palace coup against the regime of Esme Stewart, duke of Lennox, and James Stewart, earl of Arran. A little before dawn on 23 August 1582, Lyon, with William Ruthven, first earl of Gowrie, and John Erskine, second earl of Mar, accompanied by 1000 troops, surrounded Ruthven Castle (Huntingtower) in Perthshire and announced to the king that he was under their control. While the other malcontents placed before their monarch a supplication detailing the wrongs committed by Lennox and his supporters, the master suggested to the king that instead of preparing to hunt in the fields he should return to his playroom and his hobby horse. After the raiders had returned the king to his boyhood residence of Stirling, the master again confronted the king when the latter wanted to visit his capital. When James burst into tears on being refused permission to visit Edinburgh, Lyon, who had blocked the way by placing his leg across an open doorway, responded with the comment that 'better bairns should weep than bearded men' ('History of the Church', 2.290). During the period of the Ruthven regime, the master appeared at first in the sederunts of the privy council, but he exercised his influence mostly in close counsels with the earls of Angus and Mar. 
On James's 'escape' from the Ruthven regime to St Andrews in June 1583, Lyon was ordered to ward in Dumbarton Castle (within three days) and was instructed to surrender his houses of Glamis, Auldbar, Baikie, and Dod. Instead he fled from Scotland, taking refuge first in Ireland and then in England. On 31 January 1584 he was charged to leave Scotland, England, and Ireland, under pain of treason. Within three months, however, he was back in Scotland (along with Angus and Mar), in an attempt to overthrow the politically dominant earl of Arran by seizing Stirling Castle (on 17 April 1584) and holding it against the king's government. The rebellion was short-lived and the master, along with his companions, again fled, faced by King James at the head of an army said to number 12,000. He took up residence in Westminster and secretly corresponded with the English government. In Scotland, parliament passed an act of forfeiture on 22 August 1584 against him, along with Angus, Mar, and their supporters. 
In October 1585 Lyon secretly returned to Scotland and met with other discontented lords at the residence in Kelso of Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell. By 2 November the lords were before Stirling Castle seeking Arran's removal from authority and their own pardon. Arran fled through the castle postern, and on 4 November Lyon and other conspirators were pardoned. Three days later Lyon was officially admitted to the privy council, and he also replaced Arran as captain and commander of the king's guard. Shortly afterwards, on 2 December, he was appointed treasurer (in succession to the third earl of Montrose), with a salary of $1000 Scots a year. Although he never achieved the office he coveted most -- that of chancellor (like his late brother) -- in December his estates were restored in parliament, and on 9 February 1586 he was created an extraordinary lord of session, again replacing Montrose. It was unusual for so prominent a nobleman to take on the onerous and regular duties of the session, but such a position had been held by Lyon's brother between 1570 and 1573, and the master may have owed his promotion more to heritage than to legal knowledge. 
His first wife having died, on 9 February 1586 Lyon married Eupheme, daughter of William Douglas, fifth earl of Morton; they had two sons and a daughter. His influence within the Angus homelands of the Lyons led to his becoming involved in his family's long-running feud with the Lindsay earls of Crawford (recently aggravated by the eleventh earl of Crawford's alleged responsibility for the death of the eighth Lord Glamis). In November 1579, in an attempt to settle the feud, Crawford was obliged to give assurance that he would not harm the master of Glamis and would seek licence to travel to the continent (on surety of $10,000), but this action was unsuccessful and the feud continued, with bloodshed on both sides, throughout the early 1580s (while Crawford supported the Lennox and Arran regimes, and the master strongly opposed them). On 14 December 1586, however, as senior representative of the Lyons, the master of Glamis exchanged assurances with Crawford to settle their differences, and six months later, following a reconciliation banquet given by the king, Thomas Lyon and the earl walked arm in arm along the High Street of Edinburgh to parliament. 
In January 1587 Lyon was appointed a commissioner for grants from crown lands, but his influence waned somewhat towards the end of the 1580s, partly because of his difficulties in dealing with the chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane. He lost the captaincy of the guard to two of the king's favourites, firstly to Alexander Lindsay (later first Lord Spynie and the earl of Crawford's uncle -- an action which renewed the feud), and then on 28 November 1588 to George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly. Strongly protestant and an Anglophile, the master was usually an opponent of the conservative Huntly, making him an obvious target for attack when the earl and his supporters rose against the king in 1589. The master attempted to oppose the rebels, but was surprised and cornered in his house at Kirkhill by Huntly's lieutenant, Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindoun. On his failing to surrender, the house was burned around him and he was captured and taken north to Auchindoun; he was released only when the king took to the field and marched to oppose Huntly. 
Lyon was knighted at the coronation of Queen Anna on 17 May 1590, but continuing difficulties with Thirlestane and suspicions of involvement with the renegade earl of Bothwell (with whom previously he had been at odds) led to his being imprisoned in Blackness Castle for a short period in November 1591, and then being warded north of the River Dee (his ward, Lord Glamis, was also placed in protective custody as a result of the master's links with Bothwell). Lyon also briefly lost his seat on the session (restored to the earl of Montrose) but recovered it in March 1593 on the promotion of John Cockburn of Ormiston. In May 1593 he was advanced to be an ordinary lord of session, following the death of Lord President Provand. The master's involvement with Bothwell was short-lived; indeed, he was exiled from court during the earl's brief recovery of favour in the autumn of 1593. Reconciliation with Thirlestane followed and the two men returned to court following Bothwell's fall. In April 1594 the master led 400 royal troops into a confrontation with Bothwell during the latter's 'raid' on Leith, but after the king's vanguard under Lord Home had been scattered, Lyon's troops also dispersed, having done little fighting. 
Lyon's position became significantly weaker during 1596. In that year a group of eight commissioners, the Octavians, took over responsibility for management of the royal finances. The master initially refused to demit the office of treasurer, but the Octavians established that large sums of money were due to the exchequer from him, and in return for his leaving office these debts were cancelled. On 6 March the master of Glamis was replaced as treasurer by Walter Stewart, Lord Blantyre, after receiving a gift of $6000. Also in 1596 the master's nephew Patrick, ninth Lord Glamis, came of age, and his wife gave birth to a son and heir, John (later tenth Lord Glamis and second earl of Kinghorne). No longer master of Glamis, Sir Thomas Lyon of Auldbar (as he was thereafter usually known) and his nephew initially came to an amicable agreement regarding the former's acquisition of estates during Glamis's minority. Shortly afterwards, however, the pair fell out over a transaction concerning Tannadyce (the estate was subsequently held by James Lyon, an illegitimate son of Sir Thomas's), and Auldbar entered litigation against his nephew (which he lost). During 1598 Auldbar removed himself from public life and was permitted to remain away from court 'in respect of his greet deseis' (Brunton and Haig, 205). He also demitted his place on the session. Thereafter he lived quietly on his estates, for long enough to see his nephew elevated to comital status as earl of Kinghorne, Lord Lyon, and Glamis, in July 1606. Sir Thomas Lyon died in Forfarshire on 18 February 1608.

Lyon, William (d. 1617), Church of Ireland bishop of Cork, was born in Chester; little is known about his early career. He may have been educated at Oxford University, though Justice Saxey said that he had been 'some time a tapster [innkeeper] by London way' (TNA: PRO, SP 63/216/59), while yet another source stated that he had been a seafarer in his youth. In 1595 he claimed to have been in Ireland for twenty-five years, suggesting that he had arrived in 1570. On 6 November 1573 he was presented to the vicarage of Naas (co. Kildare), to which he added Bodenstown (co. Kildare) on 23 July 1580; but it is not clear whether he was always resident, since on 24 November 1577 he had received permission to hold two Irish benefices while living in England. By the early 1580s he was certainly in Ireland, serving as chaplain to Lord Deputy Grey, and accepting in 1582 the impoverished southern see of Ross (nominated 30 March, letters patent 12 May). By August 1582 Grey had granted Lyon the profits of the neighbouring see of Cork, and the mayor of Cork soon petitioned for Lyon to be made bishop. As early as April 1583 he was termed bishop of Ross and Cork. In November 1583 he was granted Cork 'in commendam', and finally on 24 March 1586 the queen ordered that it be annexed to Ross, along with the adjacent see of Cloyne. His wife was called Elizabeth; they had a son, William, and two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. 
Lyon was that rarity in late-sixteenth century Ireland, an active, resident English bishop. He played his part to the full as a local official: he served on the commissions for ecclesiastical causes in Munster of 1583 and 1594, on the national commission of 1602, and on the civil commission for the government of Munster during the 1590s, and he reported regularly to Dublin and London about political and religious affairs in the province. But his long episcopate was far from easy. The first part was punctuated by wars and upheavals: the Desmond rising of 1579-83, followed by the Munster plantation, and then by the Nine Years' War (1594-1603), which reached its devastating climax in Munster. Moreover, these military struggles became intertwined with the fierce contest between Reformation and Counter-Reformation for the religious loyalty of the people. As if this was not enough Lyon also struggled with a serious financial crisis as his Irish predecessors, seeing little future for themselves in the Church of Ireland, had leased out episcopal endowments. Cork and Ross were worth only $70 p.a. when he became bishop, Cloyne even less, his predecessor having granted it away in fee farm for a rent of only $3 6's'. 8died p.a., leaving Lyon without even a residence there. 
Initially Lyon made progress in establishing conformity, if not protestantism. He himself contributed to the building of a see house (at a cost of $300), a church, a free school, and even a bridge, in Ross, and provided new testaments and prayer and schoolbooks (albeit in English and Latin). By 1589 he had, according to Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam, 'reformed so many people, which at his coming unto these parts are most wild and disordered, by informing them in the principles of religion, as they are not only become thereby so obedient to law... but also are so forward to have the word of God preached, and to communicate, as it is wonderful... that one age, much less one man, not learned in their own language, in so short a time, could have wrought them to like perfection. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/142/9)' But it was always an uphill task. Visitations of his dioceses from the early 1590s reveal serious problems. Though a core of local Irish and Anglo-Irish clergy remained, lay invasion of church property, rampant pluralism, and the large number of vacant and impropriate benefices without cure, suggested that the Church of Ireland was struggling pastorally. In all there were about thirty clergy in Cloyne, nearly all reading ministers, serving 125 benefices, fifty-five of which were vacant. 
Lyon confirmed the general picture of decline. In 1595 he wrote to Burghley complaining that because of the suspension of the laws against recusancy and the activities of the Catholic clergy, the supply of clergy and parishioners had dried up. Existing ministers were leaving to become 'massing priests'; replacements, especially Irish born preachers, were impossible to find. The people, heeding the warnings of the priests that the Church of Ireland liturgy was the 'devil's service', were refusing to come to church. 'Within these two years... where I have had a thousand or more in a church at sermon, I now have not five' (TNA: PRO, SP 63/183/47). In 1598 his house at Ross was destroyed by a local chieftain. In 1604 Lyon reported again. He found the mere 'face of a church', 'torn and rent', and 'overwhelmed with the palpable darkness of idolatry', with 'few qualified incumbents'. Throughout his dioceses 'no marriages, christenings, &c' had been done 'but by Papist priests this seven years' (TNA: PRO, SP 63/221/35A). Lyon's reports are, it is true, not devoid of special pleading. Convinced that Roman Catholicism was inherently antichristian and disloyal, he believed that missionary activity needed to be backed up by firm civil measures to enforce conformity, something which the politic Burghley was unwilling to do after the outbreak of the Nine Years' War. 
In fact, the shift in religious attitudes was much too deep to be changed by official coercion, as became evident when Lyon set about rebuilding the church after the coming of peace in 1603. Under the aggressive lord president, Sir Henry Brouncker, a religious experiment was conducted in Munster. Brouncker used his powers to the full to force recusants to come to church, while Lyon sought to create a fresh ministry to accommodate the new parishioners. The impact of fines and imprisonment did produce a temporary increase in conformists, at least in the cities where there were preachers, but the Catholic leaders proved defiant, and the disruption caused to the civil life of the province by the harsh enforcement measures led the English privy council to order the suspension of the campaign. 
The future for the Church of Ireland in Munster lay with the growing community of English colonists. Lyon attracted university educated clergy from England by uniting five or six benefices. By 1615 the ministry was very different from the 1590s. The old local clergy had almost disappeared, replaced by emigres. In Cloyne there were thirty-five resident clergy, of whom fifteen were now preachers. The quality of the ministry had thus improved, but its coverage was mostly limited to the areas of English settlement. Underpinning the changes in ministry were improvements in the church's finances. Lyon spent a considerable amount of time during the second part of his episcopate in seeking to recover church property. He compiled a terrier for Cloyne, in preparation for a lengthy, though unsuccessful, battle in the courts and parliament to recover the see lands. He built a palace at Cork at a cost of over $1000, and managed to raise his overall income by 1615 to $200 p.a. 
Lyon died on 4 October 1617. In 1849 his tomb (built, rather pessimistically, in 1597) was discovered near the see house in Cork, and his remains removed to the cathedral. As with his background, there are conflicting accounts of Lyon's abilities. Saxey thought him 'utterly unlearned' (SP 63/216/59), but he impressed Brouncker as a man 'whose piety, courage and honesty I cannot commend sufficiently' (SP 63/219/134). Brouncker was of course Lyon's ally, and Saxey was notably dismissive of Irish clerics. The truth probably lies in between -- certainly the evidence of the visitations and his surviving correspondence suggests a competent and dedicated administrator struggling with a difficult task.

Lyons, Edmund, first Baron Lyons (1790-1858), naval officer and diplomatist, the fourth son of John Lyons of Antigua and St Austen's, Lymington, in Hampshire, was born on 29 November 1790 at Burton, Christchurch, Hampshire. Vice Admiral John Lyons (died 1872), for many years in the Egyptian service, was his elder brother. Lyons went to sea with his godfather, a friend of his father's, Admiral Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton, in the 'Terrible' in 1798; after this he attended Hyde Abbey School near Winchester until 1803, when he joined the frigate 'Active', commanded by Bickerton's cousin, Captain Richard Hussey Moubray. He remained in her for four years, serving at the passage of the Dardanelles by Sir John Duckworth in February 1807. Shortly afterwards Lyons went to the East Indies; he was appointed acting lieutenant in the following year, and commissioned on 22 November 1809. On 9 August 1810 he took a notable part in the capture of Banda Neira, principal island in the Banda group, west of New Guinea. Lyons then served as flag lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Drury aboard the 'Minden' (74 guns). In 1811 the fleet was preparing to capture the heavily fortified port of Marrack, south west of Batavia, but a boat attack was postponed on receipt of intelligence that additional Dutch troops had arrived. On 25 July 1811 Lyons was sent to land Dutch prisoners; on his way back to the fleet, having had a clear sight of the defences, he decided to attack the fort by surprise. On 30 July, shortly before midnight, he landed with only thirty-four men under the embrasures of the fort. This small force stormed and captured the battery, and then Lyons led a charge that dispersed the garrison. When the Dutch troops returned they were driven off by two heavy guns. Lyons then dismantled the fort, spiked the guns and withdrew his men. His actions were highly praised, and although Commodore Broughton's dispatch did not lead to a promotion he was noted at the Admiralty for early elevation to the rank of commander. This action was widely regarded as the most outstanding example of individual bravery in the wars which followed the French Revolution, and lived in the memory of the service for decades. 
Lyons continued off Java, commanding captured gunboats and serving ashore until his health broke down and he returned to Britain. He was promoted commander on 21 March 1812. In 1813 he commanded the brig 'Rinaldo' in the channel, and on 7 June 1814 he was posted captain. In the same year he married Augusta Louisa, daughter of Captain Josias Rogers RN; they had two sons and two daughters. He remained unemployed until 1828, when he commanded the frigate 'Blonde' in the Mediterranean, during the closing stages of the Greek war of independence, co-operating with French troops at the capture of Kastro Morea, in the Peloponnese, for which he was awarded French and Greek orders. In 1829, while attending the British ambassador in Constantinople, the 'Blonde' cruised around the Black Sea, and became the first British warship to visit Sevastopol, the Caucasus, and Odessa. Twenty-five years later Lyons was to be the only senior officer with experience of this sea. In 1831 Lyons moved into the 'Madagascar', and in 1833 he escorted the new King Otho from Trieste to Athens. On paying off in January 1835 he was made KCH and appointed minister and plenipotentiary at Athens, where he remained for almost fifteen years. He proved less satisfactory as an ambassador than as a naval officer, lacking subtlety and often resorting to hectoring and overbearing methods. On 29 July 1840 he was created baronet, and in July 1844 he was made a civil GCB. Between 1849 and 1851 he was minister to the Swiss confederation; he then moved to Stockholm, where his wife died. Lyons, who remained on the navy list, had reached the rank of rear-admiral on 14 January 1850. In November 1853 he was appointed second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet, with his flag aboard the new screw steam battleship 'Agamemnon' (91 guns). 
Lyons's appointment was well calculated for coalition warfare, particularly where the command was shared by four senior officers. His linguistic skills and diplomatic experience added a new dimension to the planning of the allied forces. In addition Lyons's character and energy were in marked contrast to the calm, measured approach of the commander-in-chief, Vice-Admiral Sir James Dundas. Lyons was in direct personal correspondence with the first lord of the Admiralty, Sir James Graham, who relied on him to push through his plans for an amphibious assault on Sevastopol. This he did at a series of allied councils of war in July and August 1854, in opposition to the views of Dundas. Lyons relished his position, and soon began to differ from his admiral, allowing his asides to be recorded by a party from 'The Times', including John Delane, Austen Henry Layard, and William Howard Russell, who relayed his views to the public, and cabinet ministers. The correspondence with Graham was improper and indiscreet, and Dundas recognized the want of trust in him it implied. 
Lyons, with his white hair and slight physique, always fancied that he resembled Nelson, and consciously attempted to model his conduct accordingly. However, he lacked the sustained intellectual power that was such a feature of Nelson's approach to warfare. Lyons was aggressive, dynamic and forceful, but he did not originate a single major operational or strategic movement, being the executor of other men's plans. Dundas, recognizing his subordinate's talents, delegated to him the organization of the transports for the invasion of the Crimea, and Lyons promptly handed the task on to his flag captain William Mends. Mends's plan proved highly successful, much to Lyons's credit. Lyons quickly struck up a rapport with Lord Raglan which greatly assisted inter-service co-operation in the subsequent campaign. Dundas left inshore operations and liaison to Lyons, remaining afloat with the main fleet. 
Lyons captured Balaklava, and advised Lord Raglan to adopt it as the base of the British army, a decision that was to have unfortunate consequences when the army had to winter in the Crimea. Lyons led the inshore squadron in the diversionary attack on Sevastopol on 17 October 1854, and ignoring Dundas's orders closed in to engage the fortifications. While this demonstrated his personal bravery, the ships were damaged and unnecessary casualties were sustained. Afterwards Lyons accepted that Dundas had been correct. The failure of the raid on Sevastopol led the government to seek a scapegoat, and Dundas was chosen. Lyons succeeded to the command in January 1855. Working closely with Lord Raglan he improved supply arrangements in the Bosphorus, where Rear-Admiral Frederick Grey took command, and at Balaklava. His most important contribution to the war lay in securing French consent to the capture of Kerch and occupation of the Sea of Azov in May. This operation, long urged by Graham, destroyed the logistic support of the Russian army in the Crimea, determining the outcome of the campaign. As the direction of the Crimean campaign increasingly fell under French control, reflecting the relative sizes of the two armies, Lyons found that opportunities for wide-ranging operations declined. In June 1855 he suffered a double blow, losing his son, Captain Edmund Lyons RN (1819-1855), who had been severely wounded in a night attack on Sevastopol, and his close friend and colleague Raglan. After the fall of Sevastopol he led an expedition to capture Kinburn on 17 October 1855, an enterprise notable for the first operational use of armoured warships. This opened up the Bug and Dnieper rivers for allied operations. In July 1855 he was nominated a military GCB. 
In January 1856 Lyons attended the allied council of war in Paris, where he pressed for a more energetic prosecution of the war. After the treaty of Paris he completed his term as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. He was promoted to the peerage as Baron Lyons of Christchurch on 23 June 1856. On 19 March 1857 he became a vice-admiral, and from December he held the temporary rank of admiral. Already a sick man, Lyons returned to Britain in early 1858 and, after commanding the squadron that escorted the queen to Cherbourg in August, he went ashore. He died on 23 November 1858 at Arundel Castle, the seat of his son-in-law, Henry Granville Fitzalan Howard, fourteenth duke of Norfolk. He was buried in the vault of Arundel Castle. Lyons's elder son, Richard Bickerton Pemell Lyons, followed his father into the diplomatic service, where he had a distinguished career. 
Lyons was distinguished for his bravery, spirit and commitment. His service as a diplomat in the minor European posts was a worthwhile alternative to long periods on half pay, and provided him with skills and insights that he put to good use in the Crimea. Like his inspiration, Nelson, he was as lavish with his praise of others as he was anxious to be praised by his superiors, and his energy and determination earned him the commitment of those under his command. Nevertheless he was limited by his character and intellect. A balanced assessment of him was provided by Lord Clarendon, the foreign secretary, in 1856: 'tho' he has some ability & considerable firmness I think him singularly deficient in judgement, he is moreover irritable & one of the vainest men I ever knew' (Lambert, 329). 
Lyons's contribution to the Crimean campaign was immense, from the allied council of war that decided to attempt the operation, through the transport of the British army, the provision of naval support afloat and ashore, providing advice and support for Lord Raglan, and carrying out the critical Kerch operation. Without him the operation might never have been attempted. His enthusiasm, energy, and leadership made him an outstanding fleet commander, but his limited grasp of strategic issues denied him true greatness.

Lyons, Israel, the elder (d. 1770), Hebrew scholar and teacher, was born into a Polish Jewish family. He settled at Cambridge where he resided for nearly forty years, earning his livelihood by keeping a silversmith's shop, and giving instruction in the Hebrew language to members of the university. The Cambridge antiquary William Cole notes that in 1732 Lyons lived in a lane at the Great Bridge Foot, called the Pond Yards, but afterwards removed to a house in St John's Lane, near the corner of Green Street. In 1769 he was occupying the corner house of the Regent Walk. According to the same source Lyons and his son Israel Lyons, mathematician, and his daughter Judith were often found fighting together, and were considered unorthodox by other members of the Jewish community in Cambridge. In 1735 he published 'The Scholar's Instructor' (4th edn, 1823); followed by 'A Hebrew Grammar' (1763) and 'Observations Relating to Various Parts of Scripture History' (1768). Lyons died in Cambridge on 19 August 1770. According to Cole he was buried, at his own request, in the churchyard of Great St Mary's, Cambridge. John Bowtell states that his daughter Judith was a sensible and ingenious woman, but took to fortune-telling, and died a pauper in All Saints' parish, Cambridge, where she was buried on 21 April 1795.

Lyons, Israel, the younger (1739-1775), mathematician and botanist, was born at Cambridge, the son of Israel Lyons the elder (d. 1770). He was something of a prodigy, especially in mathematics, and Robert Smith, master of Trinity College, paid for him to attend school; however, after a few days Lyons left, saying that he could learn more on his own in an hour than at school in a day. Presumably he continued to educate himself with his father's help. He became proficient in French, Latin, and medieval English history. It is not known if Lyons remained of the Jewish faith, which would account for his not entering the university. In any event, he probably coached students privately, like his father. 
In 1758, before he was twenty, Lyons published a 270 page 'Treatise of Fluxions', dedicated to his patron, Smith. Such was his standing that the subscription list has 266 names, nearly all from the university; it includes eleven masters or presidents of colleges, one of them the vice-chancellor, seven professors, and six college libraries, besides the provost of Oriel College, Oxford. With his friend Michael Tyson he had been studying the local flora, resulting in his 1763 'Fasciculus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium', of 106 plants unknown to John Ray, thirty of them also unremarked by Thomas Martyn in his 'Plantae Cantabrigienses' of the same year. On the strength of his reputation Lyons was taken to Oxford in 1764 by Joseph Banks, then an Oxford undergraduate, to lecture there on botany. 
On 13 June 1765 Lyons was engaged, together with George Witchell, to compute the tables for the first half of 1767 for the first issue of the 'Nautical Almanac'. Lyons also laid down rules and computed tables for correcting astronomical observations for the effects of refraction and parallax; these were published in 1766 in 'Tables Requisite to be used with the [Nautical Almanac]'. An extended version of his tables, calculated with Thomas Parkinson and [Richard?] Williams, both of Christ's College, was edited by Anthony Shepherd and published in 1772. Further short calculations by Lyons appeared in the 'Almanacs' for 1774, 1776, and 1778. Lyons's survey of Cambridgeshire, which in 1770 he proposed to publish by subscription, seems to have found insufficient support. 
In June 1773 an expedition sailed towards the north pole under C. J. Phipps. Appointed by the board of longitude as official astronomer, Lyons was to test chronometers by L. Kendall and J. Arnold, which he did to their satisfaction. His observations and calculations were published by Phipps in 1774. Some of his unattributed calculations were found to be in error. 
On his return, Lyons married, in March 1774, Phoebe Pearson, daughter of Newman Pearson of Over, Cambridgeshire, and settled in Rathbone Place, London. There he died of measles on 1 May 1775, while preparing a complete edition of Halley's works sponsored by the Royal Society. His paper on spherical trigonometry, read posthumously to the society, was printed in the 1775 'Philosophical Transactions'. Other papers appeared as the astronomical section of J. Seally's 'Geographical Dictionary' (1787). According to the 'Gentleman's Magazine', Lyons was known for his extraordinary genius and extensive knowledge. Charles Hutton described him as a very extraordinary young man for parts and ingenuity, though a less favourable report described him as very debauched. His short scientific career was remarkably varied and relatively successful.

Lyons, John Charles (1792-1874), horticulturist and antiquary, was born on 22 August 1792, the only child of Charles John Lyons (1766-1796), captain of the 12th light dragoons, and his wife, Mary Anne (died 1855), daughter of Sir Richard Levinge. His grandfather, who survived his father, was John Lyons (died 1803), a landed proprietor, of Ledestown, Mullingar, co. Westmeath. John Charles succeeded to his grandfather's estate in 1803. He attended Reading School and matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 21 May 1810, but took no degree. He served as a magistrate and was high sheriff for co. Westmeath in 1816. On 14 March 1820 he married Penelope Melesina, only daughter of Hugh Tuite of Sonna; they had a son and a daughter. After her death in February 1855, he married, on 12 November 1856, Frances Ellen, third daughter of Thomas Walsh of Belleview, co. Westmeath, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. 
Lyons is best-known for his studies on the cultivation of orchids, of which he had a large collection at Ledestown. The failure of his first collection of orchids from Mexico led to his discovery that there was no authority on their cultivation. His 'Remarks on the Management of Orchidaceous Plants, with a Catalogue' (1843) was produced on a printing press at Ledestown. It received the gold medal of the Royal Horticultural Society of Ireland. Lyons was a practical man, who engraved the illustrations for his books, designed and constructed his printing presses and greenhouses, and also built clocks. Besides contributing to horticultural journals, he wrote several antiquarian works, printed on his own press, including 'A book of surveys and distribution of the estates forfeited in the county of Westmeath in the year 1641' (1852) and 'The Grand Juries of Westmeath from 1727 to 1853' (1853). 
Lyons died on 3 September 1874 at Ledestown, and was buried in the family grave at All Saints' Church, Mullingar, Westmeath.

Lyons, Richard Bickerton Pemell, Earl Lyons (1817-1887), diplomatist, was born on 26 April 1817 at Lymington, Hampshire, the elder son of Edmund Lyons, first Baron Lyons (1790-1858), naval officer and diplomatist, and his wife, Augusta Louisa, 'nee' Rogers (died 1852). After attending Winchester College, he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1838 and MA in 1843. He entered the diplomatic service in 1839 as an unpaid attache at his father's legation in Athens. In 1844 he was made a paid attache and transferred to Dresden and then Florence. His first major appointment came in December 1858 when he succeeded Lord Napier as British envoy in Washington. 
Lyons reached Washington on the eve of the civil war and, like many observers, believed that the dissolution of the United States was a strong possibility. He feared that American politicians might try to divert public opinion from domestic problems by increasing their attacks against foreign powers, especially Britain, and was particularly suspicious of William Henry Seward, the secretary of state in the Lincoln administration. As the civil war unfolded, Lyons had to deal with numerous problems. Among them were the defence of Canada, which he believed would be the first target of a possible attack from the northern states, and the question of cotton supply to Britain from the southern states after Lincoln's decision to order the blockade of the southern coast. It was, however, the 'Trent' affair that established Lyons's lasting reputation. In the autumn of 1861 the southern states had sent two of their leading politicians to Europe to try to secure formal recognition for the Confederacy. They embarked on the (neutral) British mail steamer, the 'Trent', which was later intercepted by a vessel of the northern states. Public excitement over the affair grew so intense that war between Britain and America seemed for a time unavoidable. Through tact and firmness Lyons was largely responsible for the avoidance of confrontation between the two countries. 
In the spring of 1865 poor health brought about by physical exhaustion forced Lyons to resign his post in Washington; a few months later he went to Constantinople to replace Sir Henry Bulwer. He stayed there less than two years and in October 1867, after the resignation of Earl Cowley, was moved to Paris, where he represented Britain for a continuous period of twenty years, which made him one of the longest-serving British ambassadors in Paris in modern times. The presence of such a reliable and conciliatory man in the most sensitive and important post in Europe gave both Liberal and Conservative British governments an essential guarantee that their instructions would always be carried out according to the terms determined in London. His efforts on behalf of various governments were rewarded with a viscountcy (1881) and an earldom (1887). 
The twenty years Lyons spent in Paris were of momentous importance in French history: the last years of the Second Empire, its fall and the Franco-Prussian War, the Paris commune, the establishment of the third republic, and the start of the Boulanger crisis, which threatened to engulf the basis of the new republican settlement. Lord Lyons had decided views on the evolving situation in France. Because he did not consider a working and orderly parliamentary democracy possible in France, he constantly favoured strong men, such as Napoleon III and later the republican leader Leon Gambetta, to lead the country. He believed that only they could pacify France, heal the political and social divisions within French society, and, no less importantly, maintain a strong attachment to the entente with Britain and a commitment to free-trade policy. 
These two decades were no less fraught with major international problems: the rise of Prussia and the consequences for the European order arising out of the Franco-Prussian War; the Eastern question; the French invasion of Tunisia and the start of French colonial expansion; and the Egyptian question. On all these issues Lyons favoured a close understanding between France and Britain in order to avoid a new confrontation between France and Germany which would, he believed, destroy the entire European system. Following British action in Egypt in the summer of 1882 and the formal end of dual control of that country, Lyons found himself at the receiving end of a bitter confrontation between Britain and France which lasted until 1904: the last five years of his embassy must rank as the worst time he spent in Paris. Unlike some in London he accepted the responsibilities facing Britain in Egypt and believed that, having decisively established its authority over Egypt, Britain should not withdraw from the task it had entered upon. He therefore advocated the best possible arrangements both for securing Egypt's finances and for respecting French financial rights there. During this difficult period Lyons contributed greatly, by his conciliatory manner, in preventing the lack of cordiality between France and Britain from producing any irremediable estrangement. 
By the time Lyons relinquished his post at the end of October 1887 he was an exhausted man who, after nearly fifty years of official duties, longed for some rest. On the formation of the second Salisbury administration in 1886, the new prime minister had offered him the Foreign Office, but he declined on the grounds of ill health and age. His last days at the embassy were very trying, but in accordance with Salisbury's wish he stayed on a few more months, though not without considerable misgivings. The earl of Lytton, who had served under Lyons as charge d'affaires, succeeded him. 
In November 1887 Lyons converted to Roman Catholicism. Later the same month, while staying at Norfolk House, St James's Square, London, with his nephew the duke of Norfolk, he suffered a stroke which paralysed him. He died there on 5 December and was buried at Arundel on the 10th. All his titles became extinct.

Lyons, Robert Spencer Dyer (1826-1886), physician, was born at Glanmire, Cork, the second son of Sir William Lyons (1794-1858), a merchant of the city who was mayor in 1848 and 1849 and was knighted by the queen on her visit to Cork on 3 August 1849. His mother was Harriet, daughter of Robert Spencer Dyer of Kinsale. Robert was educated at Hamblin and Porter's Grammar School, Cork, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated MB in 1848. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1849. In 1855 he was appointed pathologist-in-chief to the army in the Crimea, where he reported on the disease then prevalent in the trenches before Sevastopol ('Report on the Pathology of the Diseases of the Army in the East', 1856). On 8 September 1855 he was awarded the Crimean and Turkish medals and clasps for Sevastopol. Lyons was professor of medicine and pathology in the Catholic University medical school in Dublin, and in 1857 he undertook a voluntary mission to Lisbon to investigate the pathological anatomy of the yellow fever which was raging there, and for his report on that subject received from Dom Pedro V the cross and insignia of the ancient order of Christ. He soon returned to Ireland and joined St George's Hospital, Dublin, where he took an active share in the education of the army medical staff. Lyons was also a senator of the Royal University in 1880, crown nominee for Ireland in the General Medical Council of the United Kingdom on 29 November 1881, physician to the House of Industry hospitals, and visiting physician to St Patrick's College, Maynooth. In 1870 he was invited by Gladstone's government to act on a commission of inquiry into the treatment of Irish treason-felony prisoners in English gaols, and in connection with this inquiry he visited many French prisons and reported on the discipline exercised in that country. He enthusiastically recommended the reafforesting of Ireland, and with the agreement of the government collected information on forests from foreign countries, which was embodied in an article in the 'Journal of Forestry and Estate Management' in 1883. He sat in the House of Commons for the city of Dublin as a Liberal from April 1880 to the general election in 1885, and spoke on the 'Parliamentary Oaths Act' in May 1883. Lyons wrote widely on subjects in medicine, education, and forestry, publishing a number of essays and monographs between 1850 and 1885. Of these 'A handbook of hospital practice, or, An introduction to the practical study of medicine at the bedside' (1859), 'Intellectual resources of Ireland: supply and demand for an enlarged system of Irish university education' (1873), and 'Forest Areas in Europe and America, and Probable Future Timber Supplies' (1884) are of particular interest. In 1856 Lyons married Marie, daughter of David Richard Pigot, lord chief baron of the exchequer in Ireland. He died on 19 December 1886 at 89 Merrion Square, Dublin, and was survived by his wife.

Lysaght, Edward (1763-1811), poet and wit, was born on 21 December 1763, the son of John Lysaght of Brickhill, co. Clare, a protestant gentleman, and Jane Eyre, daughter of Edward Dalton of Deerpark in the same county. He was educated at Dr Patrick Hare's school at Cashel, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA. His degree was incorporated at Oxford in 1787, and a year later he proceeded MA from St Edmund Hall, Oxford. 
Lysaght complemented his academic work with legal study. In 1784 he became a student at the Middle Temple in London, and also at the King's Inns in Dublin. He was called to the English bar during the Easter term in 1788, and joined the profession in Ireland later that year. Initially, he practised English law, being employed as counsel in many election petitions, including, in 1784, the petition arising out of the celebrated Westminster contest with Charles James Fox. 
Lysaght's legal career in London did not prosper, however, and he therefore decided in 1797-8 to return to Ireland to become a member of the Munster circuit, where, for a time, he enjoyed a considerable practice, being appointed a commissioner of bankruptcy, and, later, a police magistrate for Dublin. 
In Dublin, Lysaght also increasingly became a notable society figure, particularly in literary and theatrical circles, where he achieved a considerable reputation as a 'bon vivant', satiric wit, and improvisatore. At the time of the 'Act of Union', he hired himself out as a political squib writer and pamphleteer, whose Swiftian anti-English satires in 'The Lantern' made him enemies determined to blacken his name. Jonah Barrington, for example, states without authority in his 'Personal Sketches' (1827-32) that, although posing as an opponent of the Union, Lysaght in reality took money from Castlereagh to write in the government interest. 
Lysaght did not, however, manage his money well, and his social popularity did not prevent him from dying impoverished in 1811. His collected poems were published in the year of his death, prefaced by a memoir. A subscription raised by the bench and bar of Ireland for the benefit of his widow and two daughters raised over $2000. His patriotic ballads and often sentimental and bawdy love songs were also recalled with affection in Ireland throughout the nineteenth century, and were continually anthologized. Lysaght's wit was also not soon forgotten. In 1829, in Sydney Owenson's popular novel 'The O'Briens and the O'Flahertys', a flirtatious woman is informed that her behaviour warrants an epigram in the 'Freeman's Journal' 'from Curran or Lysaght' (Deane, 2.870). Lysaght's most famous poem, 'The Man who Led the Van of the Irish Volunteers', appeared in 'The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing'.

Lysons, Daniel (1727-1800), physician, was born on 21 March 1727, the eldest son of Daniel Lysons of Hempsted Court, Gloucestershire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Mee of Gloucester. He matriculated at Oxford as a gentleman commoner of Magdalen College on 2 March 1745, graduated BA in 1750 and MA in 1751, and was elected fellow of All Souls College, where he proceeded BCL in 1755. On 5 July 1756 he was licensed to practise medicine, and in 1759 he became DCL. This degree was commuted to MD on 24 October 1769. He practised for a few years at Gloucester, and was the physician to the infirmary there. About 1770 he settled at Bath, and in 1780 was elected one of the physicians to the Bath General Hospital. He married Mary, daughter of Richard Rogers of Dowdeswell, on 6 December 1768; there were no children. Under the then statutes his marriage inevitably led to the resignation of his fellowship, but he evidently was not a man who bore grudges: three years later, in 1772, he presented the All Souls Library with its finest manuscript -- the mid-thirteenth century Amesbury psalter. 
Lysons published several works on fevers and their treatment. He died at Bath on 20 March 1800, leaving his considerable fortune to his nephew, Daniel Lysons (1762-1834), the topographer.

Lysons, Daniel (1762-1834), antiquary, was born on 28 April 1762, probably at Rodmarton rectory, Gloucestershire, the elder son of Samuel Lysons (1730-1804), rector of Rodmarton and Cherrington, and his wife, Mary (1734-1791), daughter of Samuel Peach of Chalford in the same county. He had a brother, Samuel Lysons (bap. 1763, d. 1819), antiquary and archaeologist, and a sister, Mary (1765-1848). 
After attending Bath grammar school Lysons went to Oxford, matriculating from St Mary Hall on 26 March 1779. He graduated BA in 1782 and proceeded MA in 1785. He was ordained and served as assistant curate of Mortlake from 1784 to 1789 and curate of Putney from 1789 to 1800. At this time he began work for his 'Environs of London' (4 vols., 1792-6), a topographical account of the parishes within 12 miles of London. A contemporary recounted that Lysons 'spent seven hours up to his knees in water in the vaults of Stepney Church copying epitaphs' (Fleming, 49) and he extended this industry and meticulousness to all his work. He treats Surrey parishes in the first volume, which includes notable demographic sections compiled from primary sources. This volume was only partly superseded by 'The History and Antiquities of Surrey' of Owen Manning and William Bray (3 vols., 1804-14). The second and third volumes cover Middlesex parishes and are a great advance on previous works. The sections on Essex parishes draw quite heavily on 'The History and Antiquities of the County of Essex' (2 vols., 1762-8) of Philip Morant but their range is greater, covering births and baptisms and agriculture. The work was supplemented by 'A Historical Account of those Parishes in... Middlesex... not Described in the 'Environs'' (1800), and in 1811 by a second edition of and a supplement to the 'Environs'. Many of the illustrations were drawn and etched by Lysons and his brother Samuel and the whole represented a very considerable antiquarian achievement. 
The 'Environs' was dedicated to Horace Walpole, a close friend of the two brothers and their keen correspondent. Walpole nicknamed Daniel 'Stumpity' or 'Stumpety Stump', perhaps a reference to a limp, or to his incessant toil and travels. He talks of 'the two Lysons, and their strong legs and activity and perseverance. Of their being so absorbed by their pursuits as to believe those who they speak to are equally interested with themselves' (Lewis, 15.334). Despite the gentle mockery Walpole was obviously fond of the two and had earlier appointed Daniel Lysons his 'chaplain'. The brothers had other well-placed friends and connections; their correspondence with Thomas Lawrence, who painted them both, and Mrs Piozzi survives. 
On the death of his uncle, the physician Daniel Lysons (1727-1800), Lysons inherited Hempsted Court and the family estates in Gloucestershire. On 12 May 1801 he married, at Bath, Sarah (1779/80-1808), eldest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Carteret Hardy of the York fusiliers. They had two daughters, Sarah (1802-1833) and Charlotte (1807-1848), and two sons, Daniel (1804-1814) and the antiquary Samuel Lysons (1806-1877). In 1804 Lysons succeeded to the family living of Rodmarton. 
The two Lysons brothers collaborated on 'Magna Britannia, being a concise topographical account of the several counties of Great Britain'. It was intended to fill the gap between large-scale county histories and Camden's 'Britannia', and was even more ambitious than the 'Beauties of England and Wales', on which work had recently begun. The brothers made personal visits to collect material and still more was collected, following established practice, by circulating printed questionnaires to local worthies, the post office exceptionally allowing replies by clergymen to be sent free of charge. The first volume of 'Magna Britannia', covering Bedfordshire, Berkshire, and Buckinghamshire, appeared in 1806; Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumberland, Derbyshire, and Devon had also been published by 1822, when the work ended. The decision to curtail the project was taken on the death of Samuel Lysons in 1819; Daniel, who was extremely fond of him as well as dependent on his expert archaeological skills, declared: 'I cannot go on with[out] my fellow labourer. Our lives wd not have sufficed to the completion had they been protracted even to old age. It is as well to give up now' (Steer, 49). The papers amassed in compiling the work are at BL Add. MSS 9408-9471. 
Unsurprisingly there are parts of 'Magna Britannia', such as that on Buckinghamshire, where the Lysons brothers seem on weaker ground than Daniel Lysons did in Middlesex, but overall the standard of the work is extremely high. Although their emphasis on church and manor was traditional, they included new material on such topics as commerce, population, and manufacture, and were far less preoccupied than many antiquaries with arms and pedigrees, and far less concerned than local topographers to rehearse the glories of the county. 
On 2 July 1813 Lysons married Josepha Catherine Susanna (1780/81-1868), daughter of John Gilbert Cooper of Thurgarton Priory, Nottinghamshire; they had one child, Daniel Lysons (1816-1898). Lysons was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1790) and of the Royal (1797) and Linnean societies. In addition to his antiquarian writings he published several religious works and collected cuttings from newspapers which were subsequently deposited at the British Museum. His 'History of the origin and progress of the meeting of the three choirs of Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford' (1812) remains a standard work of reference on that festival. He died at Hempsted Court on 3 January 1834 and was buried at Rodmarton. 
Lysons was one of many clergyman-topographers but he had the advantage of ample means, an excellent collaborator in his brother, and very considerable scholarly and artistic talent. His work stands out for his ability to organize and present clearly a mass of material, for the emphasis he laid on primary sources such as parish records, deeds, and censuses, and for his scrupulous citing of sources. His documented accounts corrected those of earlier antiquaries who had relied on folk memories, and set the standard for successors, including the 'Victoria History of the Counties of England'. The contents of his books were more widely copied than his methods, and the volumes remain of value nearly 200 years after their publication.

Lysons, Sir Daniel (1816-1898), army officer, born on 1 August 1816 at Rodmarton, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, was second son of the Revd Daniel Lysons (1762-1834), the topographer, and his second wife, Josepha Catherine Susanna (1780/81-1868), daughter of John Gilbert Cooper of Thurgarton Priory, Nottinghamshire. He was educated at the Revd Harvey Marryat's school at Bath and at Shrewsbury School (1829-32), where he twice saved boys from drowning. He spent two years (1832-3) with M. Frossard at Nimes to learn French. On 26 December 1834 he obtained by purchase a commission as ensign in the 1st Royals, joined the regiment at Athlone in February 1835, and went with it to Canada in the following year. 
Lysons became lieutenant on 23 August 1837, and, owing to his skill as a draughtsman, he was employed on the staff of the deputy quartermaster-general, Colonel Charles Gore, during the Canadian uprising. He was present at the action of St Denis (November 1837), was mentioned in dispatches, and was at the capture of St Eustache (December 1837). He was deputy assistant quartermaster-general from 1 December 1837 to 12 July 1841, and with the assistance of officers of the line he surveyed much of the frontier. A keen hunter, he portrayed his Canadian life, and especially moose hunting, in his 'Early Reminiscences' (1896). 
On 29 October 1843 the right wing of the Royals left Quebec for the West Indies in the transport 'Premier', which was wrecked six days afterwards in Chatte Bay, on the right bank of the St Lawrence. Lysons was active in saving those on board and, being sent back to Quebec for help, he made in four and a half days what was reckoned an eight days' journey of 300 miles. His exertions were praised in general orders, and he was rewarded by a company in the 3rd West India regiment on 29 December (captain by purchase). He went from England to the West Indies in spring 1844, and was given command of the troops in Tobago; but on 24 May he was transferred to the 23rd Welch fusiliers, then stationed in Barbados. He was brigade major there from 3 November 1845 to 15 March 1847, when he accompanied his regiment to Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
Lysons returned with his regiment to England in the autumn of 1848. He was town major at Portsmouth from 18 June to 21 August in 1849, and drew up a system of camping and cooking there. Promoted major (by purchase) on 3 August, he rejoined his regiment at Winchester, and served with it during the next five years at Plymouth, Liverpool, Chester, and Parkhurst. In April 1854 he embarked with it for Turkey, and was the first man to land in the Crimea in September. The 23rd formed part of the 1st brigade of the light division. At the Alma it lost over 200 officers and men, including its commanding officer. Just before the battle Lysons joined the 2nd division as assistant adjutant-general, but succeeding to the lieutenant-colonelcy of his regiment on 21 September, he returned to take command of it. He was present at Inkerman, though suffering from fever. 
In the assault of 18 June 1855 Lysons commanded the supports of the column furnished by his brigade. He was wounded in the knee, but brought the brigade out of action, and had command of it for a time. In the second assault, on 8 September, he led an attack on the right flank of the Redan, and was severely wounded in the thigh. On 25 October he was given command of the 2nd brigade of the light division, and retained it until the end of the war. He had been mentioned in dispatches, was made brevet colonel on 17 July 1855 and CB (5 July), and received the Legion d'honneur (fourth class) and Mejidiye (third class). 
Lysons returned to England in July 1856, and resumed command of the 23rd. On 16 January 1857 he exchanged to the 25th foot, and on 24 November went on half pay, having been appointed on 5 November assistant adjutant-general at headquarters. In this office he was employed on the revision of the infantry drill-book and its adaptation to the needs of the volunteers. He also prepared 'Instructions for Mounted Rifle Volunteers' (1860). On 6 December 1861 he was sent to Canada in connection with the 'Trent' crisis, and he was deputy quartermaster-general from 27 August 1862 until 30 September 1867. This gave him an opportunity of extending the frontier surveys on which he had worked as a subaltern. He was a member, representing imperial concerns, of the 1862 commission on Canadian defence, which reported (March 1862) in favour of the old sedentary militia system, from which an effective defensive force could be trained. 
Promoted major-general on 27 December 1868, Lysons commanded brigades at Malta (July 1868 to March 1869) and Aldershot (April 1869 to June 1872), then commanded in the northern district (July 1872 to June 1874). A system of his devising was issued by authority in 1875 as 'Infantry Piquets'. From 1 April 1876 to 30 June 1880 he was quartermaster-general at headquarters. He became lieutenant-general and was made KCB on 2 June 1877. On 25 August he became colonel of the Derbyshire regiment, and on 14 July 1879 a general. He was also honorary colonel of the 1st volunteer battalion, Royal Fusiliers. From 1 July 1880 to 1 August 1883 he commanded the Aldershot division, and he was then placed on the retired list, having reached the age of sixty-seven. On 29 May 1886 he received the GCB, and on 4 March 1890 he was made constable of the Tower. 
In 1856 Lysons married Harriet Sophia, daughter of Charles Bridges of Court House, Overton. She died in 1864, and in 1865 he married Anna Sophia Biscoe, daughter of the Revd Robert Tritton of Morden, Surrey; she survived her husband. With his first wife he had four sons, of whom the second, Henry, won the Victoria Cross at Hlobane in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, when a lieutenant in the Scottish Rifles and Colonel Evelyn Wood's orderly. Lysons died at his residence, 22 Warwick Square, Belgravia, London, on 29 January 1898, and was buried at Rodmarton. Vigorous to the last, he had been writing on army reform a month before ('The Times', 17 December 1897).

Lysons, Samuel (bap. 1763, d. 1819), antiquary, was baptized at Rodmarton, Gloucestershire, on 17 May 1763, the second son of Samuel Lysons (1730-1804), rector of Rodmarton and Cherrington, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Mary (1734-1791), daughter of Samuel Peach of Chalford in the same county. Daniel Lysons (1762-1834), historical topographer, was his brother. His nephew Samuel Lysons (1806-1877) was also an antiquary. After attending Bath grammar school Lysons was placed in June 1780 with a Bath solicitor named Jeffries. In October 1784 he went to London, having been previously entered at the Inner Temple, and began studying law under a Mr Walton. For several years he practised as a special pleader, and was therefore not called to the bar until June 1798, when he chose the Oxford circuit. In July 1796 he was introduced by Sir Joseph Banks to George III and the royal family, with whom he became a favourite. He was an excitable, vigorous, and ambitious man, with a loud voice and a penetrating eye. His friends included many leading personalities, such as Horace Walpole and Mrs Piozzi. Samuel Johnson met him and was impressed by him. In December 1803 he was appointed keeper of the records in the Tower of London and ceased practising law. Under his rule the staff was increased from one to six, and he did a considerable amount towards arranging the archives. He held the post until his death. 
In November 1786 Lysons became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In November 1812 he was nominated one of the vice-presidents of the society, and from 1798 to 1809 he held the honorary office of director. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in February 1797, and was appointed vice-president and treasurer of the society in 1810. 
Lysons was an artist of some skill, and between 1785 and 1796 was an occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy of views of old buildings. He also contributed numerous etchings to his brother Daniel's 'Environs of London'. 
A field archaeologist much ahead of his time is revealed by the reports of the sites upon which Lysons worked, such as the Woodchester Roman pavement and other Roman sites, including Horkstow in Lincolnshire, Frampton in Dorset, Bignor in Sussex, and Bath. He was able to illustrate these reports quite lavishly. His greatest publication was the 'Reliquiae Britannico-Romanae' (2 vols., 1801-17), which was a survey of sites and finds in Roman Britain. He collaborated with his brother Daniel in producing 'Magna Britannia'. In 1818, when the honorary office of antiquary professor was revived in the Royal Academy, Lysons was chosen to fill it. He died, unmarried, of heart failure on 29 June 1819, at Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and was buried on 5 July at Hempsted, for long the home of the Lysons family.

Lysons, Samuel (1806-1877), Church of England clergyman and antiquary, born at Rodmarton, Gloucestershire, on 17 March 1806, was the eldest surviving son of the Revd Daniel Lysons (1762-1834) of Hempsted Court, Gloucestershire, and Sarah (1779/80-1808), eldest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Carteret Hardy of the York fusiliers. He matriculated at Oxford from Exeter College on 24 November 1826, graduated BA in 1830 with third-class honours in classics, and proceeded MA in 1836. He was ordained deacon in 1830 and priest the following year. In 1833 he succeeded his father as rector of Rodmarton, Gloucestershire, a living in the gift of the family. On 1 January 1834 he married Eliza Sophia Theresa Henrietta (died 1846), eldest daughter of Major-General Sir Lorenzo Moore; they had four sons and two daughters. Two days after his marriage his father died and he succeeded to the family estates, which comprised Hempsted Court and other lands in Gloucestershire. When in 1838 he took up his residence at Hempsted Court he found the adjoining suburb of Gloucester, known as High Orchard, in a state of neglect, particularly the area known as Sudbrook, where there was very poor housing by the canal. Lysons built a church there (consecrated as St Luke's on 21 April 1841), furnished it with an endowment of $1000, and officiated in it himself without a stipend. Schools were erected, charitable clubs organized, and a scripture reader provided at his expense. Altogether he spent between $5000 and $6000 for the benefit of the district, which rapidly improved. His first wife having died the previous year, on 11 March 1847 he married Lucy (died 1872), daughter of the Revd John Adey Curtis-Hayward. In 1866 old age led him to resign his duties at St Luke's and, having presented a successor to the living, to resign its patronage to the bishop of the diocese. From November 1865 to February 1876 he was rural dean of Gloucester, and on 24 December 1867 he was installed as honorary canon of Gloucester Cathedral. In 1872 he married Gertrude Savery, second daughter of Simon Adams Beck of Cheam, Surrey. 
Lysons contributed frequently to the local press and occasionally lectured at local literary and scientific societies. He also published eight books. His preferred, although not his only, subjects were the topography and archaeology of Gloucestershire. He was elected FSA, but is a very minor figure among antiquaries compared with his father and uncle, whose monumental work he did not attempt to finish. He died at Hempsted Court on 27 March 1877, being survived by his widow, two children from his third marriage, and five from his first. He was buried in Rodmarton churchyard. His library was sold at Sothebys on 12 July 1880.

Lyster, Sir Richard (c.1480-1553), judge, was the son of John Lyster of Wakefield, Yorkshire, and his wife, who was one of the Beaumont family of Whitley. His grandfather Thomas had settled in that town in the reign of Henry VI, and a Thomas Lyster of Wakefield was an attorney of the common pleas from the 1470s until at least 1501. A Richard Lyster was sued for dues by Clement's Inn in 1487-8, but this can hardly have been the present subject and may have been the namesake who was at Gray's Inn in 1508. The future lord chief justice became a member of the Middle Temple about 1500, and is so described in 1502 when he acted as an attorney in the court of requests. He is mentioned as an arbitrator in London in 1503. He owned (and probably wrote) a manuscript account of the serjeants' feast of that year, perhaps as part of a private notebook of reports. After a year's respite on grounds of ill health, he became a bencher of the Middle Temple and gave his first reading in 1516, followed by a second reading in 1522, and served as treasurer from 1522 to 1524. 
Lyster came to public prominence in 1521 when he was appointed solicitor-general, from which position he was promoted to attorney-general on 4 September 1525. On 12 May 1529 he was appointed chief baron of the exchequer, was sworn in by Wolsey on 3 June, and knighted. As chief baron he supported Audley and Cromwell in pressing the judges to decide 'Lord Dacre's case' (1535) in favour of the crown, thereby enabling the 'Statute of Uses' to be passed. After presiding over the exchequer for sixteen years he was made chief justice of the king's bench on 9 November 1545. Since he was not already a serjeant-at-law this necessitated a private coifing on the same day, only the second creation of its kind to be recorded. His speech to the new serjeants in 1547 was described by a contemporary as 'a godly, thowghe sumwhat prolixe and long declaration of their duties' (Dugdale, 118). By this time Lyster had moved from Yorkshire to Southampton, where he lived in a house in St Michael's parish which Leland praised as 'very fair'. 
Lyster married first Jane, daughter of Sir Ralph Shirley, and widow of Sir John Dawtrey, whose portrait by Holbein is in the Royal Collection, and second Elizabeth Stoke, with whom he had a son, Sir Michael Lyster (died 1551), and a daughter, Elizabeth, wife of Sir Richard Blount. Lyster resigned from the office of chief justice in the first half of 1552 and died on 16 March the following year. He was buried the next day at St Michael's Church, Southampton. To his eldest grandson, Richard, he left all his lands in the south, and to his younger grandson Charles all his lands in Wakefield and elsewhere in Yorkshire. His grandson Richard was obliged to bring a slander action in 1557 to challenge an assertion that he was Sir Michael's illegitimate son by Maud Vane, whereas he claimed to be the son of Sir Michael's wife, Elizabeth. In 1567 the chief justice's widow caused a monument to be erected in St Michael's Church, with his effigy in judicial robes and collar of SS.

Lyte, Henry (1529?-1607), botanist and antiquary, was born at Lyte's Cary, Somerset, the eleventh, in direct descent, of his name settled at that place. He was the second and eldest surviving son of John Lyte (died 1576) and his first wife, Edith Horsey (died 1556). Lyte became a student at Oxford about 1546 but it is unlikely that he took a degree. Anthony Wood wrote of him: 'After he had spent some years in logic and philosophy, and in other good learning, he travelled into foreign countries, and at length retired to his patrimony, where, by the advantage of a good foundation of literature made in the university and abroad, he became a most excellent scholar in several sorts of learning. (Wood)' His son recorded that he 'was admitted of Clyffordes Inne'. From 1559 Lyte seems to have managed his father's Somerset estate until the latter's death in 1576, when his stepmother, who had already sown discord between him and his father, brought a writ of dower against him. Lyte seems to have served as sheriff, or perhaps only as under-sheriff, of Somerset during the reign of Mary, and perhaps until the second year of Elizabeth. He captained one of the Somerset trained bands formed to fight the Spanish invasion, and was serving at Tilbury at the time of the armada. 
Lyte was married three times: in September 1546 to Agnes, daughter and heir of John Kelloway of Collumpton, Devon, who died in 1564 and with whom he had five daughters; in July 1565 to Frances, daughter of John Tiptoft, citizen of London, who died in 1589 and with whom he had three sons and two daughters; and in 1591 to Dorothy, daughter of John Gover of Somerton, Somerset, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. 
Lyte was a distant connection of Aubrey, who speaks of his 'deare grandfather Lyte' and of a 'cos. Lyte of Lytes-Cary', and says that Henry Lyte 'had a pretty good collection of plants for that age'. The garden at Lyte's Cary was well known in its day for having all possible kinds of fruit including ninety varieties of pear; a description survives in an extant list in the handwriting of Lyte's second son, Thomas. 
Lyte's first and most important work was his careful translation of the 'Cruydeboeck', or herbal, of Rembert Dodoens (Antwerp, 1554), taken from the French edition of De l'Escluse (1557) and augmented clearly, in a different typeface, by his own notes. His only additional matter concerned the habitats of some Somerset plants. His working copy, annotated in Latin and English in his neat handwriting, endorsed 'Henry Lyte taught me to speake English', is in the British Library. It was printed in folio at Antwerp, in order to secure the woodcuts of the original. A dedication to Queen Elizabeth, written from Lyte's Cary, states Lyte's wish to contribute something to the welfare and renown of his country as well as to the health of its people. Other editions, without woodcuts, were published in 1586, 1595, and 1619; an abridged version appeared in 1606. 
Lyte was interested in genealogy of a fanciful kind and spent much time in seeking to show how the British were of Trojan descent, as set out in his second work, 'The Light of Britayne: a Recorde of the Honorable Originall and Antiquitie of Britaine' (1588), which was also dedicated to Elizabeth, and which contained her portrait. Lyte presented a copy of this work to the queen on 24 November 1588, when she went in state to St Paul's to return thanks for the defeat of the armada. Two small works on the same subject, written in 1592, were never printed. Lyte also drew up 'A table whereby it is supposed that Lyte of Lytescarie sprange of the race and stocke of Leitus... and that his ancestors came to Englande first with Brute', now in the British Library, and wrote a poem entitled 'A description of the swannes of Carie that came first under mightie Brute's protection from Caria in Asia to Carie in Britain', later printed in 'Notes and Queries' (6th ser., 8, 1883, 109-10). Lyte died in the house in which he was born, on 15 October 1607, and was buried at the north end of the transept of Charlton Mackrell church. 
Lyte's second son, who succeeded him, was Thomas Lyte (1568-1638), genealogist. His third son, Henry ('b'. 1573), was one of the earliest users of decimal fractions, and published in 1619 'The Art of Tens and Decimall Arithmetike', dedicated to Charles, prince of Wales, and based mainly on the French work 'La disme', published in 1590. He is described as a teacher of arithmetic in London.

Lyte, Henry Francis (1793-1847), hymn writer, was born on 1 June 1793 at The Cottage, Ednam, near Kelso, Roxburghshire, the second son of Captain Thomas Lyte (died 1850) and Anna Maria Oliver, and a descendant of the botanist Henry Lyte and the genealogist Thomas Lyte. His parents appear never to have been married, though Anna Maria was always referred to as Mrs Lyte. Thomas Lyte's military career necessitated frequent moves, and the family followed him to Edinburgh, Newmarket, Manchester, and Liverpool, before settling in Ireland in 1797. They first resided at Ballyshannon, and then in Dunmore, co. Galway. When the couple separated in 1801 Henry stayed with his father and his brother Thomas, and was then sent to Portora Royal School, Enniskillen, in October 1803. He missed his mother greatly, and rarely saw his father, who was away for long periods on military duty. Because he spent both the terms and the holidays at the school, he developed a close relationship with Dr Burrowes, the headmaster, who became a surrogate father to the boy, taking over his financial responsibilities and eventually becoming his guardian. It was while at Portora that Lyte began to compose poetry. 
Lyte entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1811, and distinguished himself academically by winning a university scholarship in 1813, and the chancellor's prize for English verse in three successive years. He graduated BA in February 1814, and considered a career in medicine; this course of study was soon abandoned in favour of holy orders, and he was ordained deacon on 18 December 1814. His first curacy was in Taghmon, co. Wexford, where he stayed for eighteen months, but his frequent attacks of asthma led him to resign this post. He then travelled through France on horseback from September 1816 to summer 1817. After his return to England, Lyte was moved from one curacy to another before eventually being given a position at the chapel of ease in Marazion, Cornwall, on 24 June 1817. On 21 January 1818 he married Anne, daughter and eventual heir of the Revd W. Maxwell of Falkland, co. Monaghan. The couple lived at Nevada House, Fore Street, where on 29 September 1818 Anne gave birth to their first son, Henry William. It was while at Marazion that Lyte underwent a spiritual experience at the deathbed of a neighbouring clergyman, Abraham Swanne. Lyte claimed that this encounter altered his whole view of life: he emerged with a deeper faith, and preached with a new vitality. 
In January 1820 the family left for Sway (near Lymington), Hampshire, to live in temporary retirement; it was here that Lyte produced many of his poems. The couple's first daughter, Ann Maria, was born in January 1821, but died a month later. Early in 1822 the family moved to Bramble Torr, a house near Dittisham, Devon; here a second daughter, Anna Maria, was born on 20 April. Lyte held no full-time position at Dittisham, but while there he was asked to do temporary duty at the chapel of ease at Lower Brixham. In May 1822 he was invited by the trustees of the chapel to remain at Brixham permanently. He refused, and went instead to Charleton, where he became curate on 6 July 1822. He stayed for almost two years, before moving back to Brixham in April 1824. 
Lyte began by ministering in two churches, St Mary's Church, Brixham, and the new district church of Lower Brixham. He joined the schools committee, and by June 1824 had become its chairman. He took a keen interest in the development of education, and in addition to conducting annual school examinations he established the first Sunday school in the Torbay area; he also undertook to teach in his recently established Sailors' Sunday School. A second son, John Walker, was born on 2 January 1826. On 13 July 1826 Lyte was instituted as the first incumbent of Lower Brixham, and the family moved to Burton House in Burton Street. A third son, Farnham, was born on 10 January 1828. Early in 1833 the Lytes moved from Burton House to Berry Head House. Henry added to his income by taking resident pupils, who were tutored alongside his own children. He also published 'Poems, Chiefly Religious' (1833; 2nd edn, 1841), which contained some of his early hymns, notable for their scriptural emphasis. In 1834 his 'Spirit of the Psalms' was published, which contained one of his best-known hymns, 'Praise, my soul, the king of heaven'. By this time Lyte's health was deteriorating, along with his chances of obtaining any preferment; in 1835 he sought appointment as the vicar of Crediton, but was turned down on account of his increasingly debilitating asthma and bronchitis. 
During the 1840s Lyte spent increasing periods abroad. First he holidayed in Norway in the summer of 1842. He then decided to spend the winter of 1844 in Naples, but his progress was hampered by illness, and he spent considerably more time abroad than he had wished; finally he returned to England in May 1846. By August he was off to the continent again, intending to winter in Rome; he ended up staying until May 1847, and returned to England in June, in very poor health. He spent the summer at Berry Head, where he wrote his most famous hymn, 'Abide with me'. He left for the continent again on 1 October 1847. By 5 November he had reached Nice, where he was seized by influenza and dysentery. He died at the Hotel de la Pension Anglaise on 20 November, ministered to by Henry Manning (later archbishop of Westminster), and was buried in the grounds of the Anglican chapel in the old cemetery, Nice. In 1848 his extensive library, chiefly theology and old English poetry, was sold in London over seventeen days. A volume of 'Remains', consisting of poems, sermons, and letters, was published in 1850; it included 'Abide with me', which was first sung (to his own tune) at his memorial service in Brixham in 1847. Though his poetic energies were directed at scripturally and evangelically minded audiences, his lyric gift was universally appreciated. The example of 'Abide with me' is instructive: intensely personal and contemplative, yet nationally popular -- even being sung (always, after its publication in 1861, to W. H. Monk's tune, 'Eventide') on secular occasions such as at football matches, and especially, since 1927, at the English cup final. A memorial tablet to Lyte was placed in Westminster Abbey in 1947.

Lyte, Thomas (1568-1638), genealogist, was born on 17 April 1568, the son and heir of Henry Lyte (1529?-1607), botanist and antiquary of Lyte's Cary, Charlton Mackrell, Somerset, and his second wife, Frances (died 1589), daughter of John Tiptoft of London. His commonplace book records that he was educated at Sherborne School, Clifford's Inn, and the Middle Temple. Wood claims he spent 'several years in academicals' at Oxford without taking a degree (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 3rd edn, 1815, 2.649). He was twice married: on 2 February 1592 he married Frances (died 1615), daughter of Henry Worth of Worth, Devon; and about 1620 Constance, daughter of George Huntley of Boxwell, Gloucester, and widow of Nicholas Baskerville and Sir John Sidney, became his second wife. His marriages resulted in seven sons and six daughters. The family lived at Lyte's Cary, where Lyte repaired the chapel in 1631, adding heraldry and tablets describing his extensive pedigree. He was active in Somerset politics from 1628 until his death, primarily as a justice of the peace. 
Lyte was a devotee of British antiquities, particularly genealogy, and was admired by Camden ('Britannia', 1695, col. 61). Some of his manuscripts are published in the Harleian Society volume 'Wiltshire Visitation Pedigrees' (1954). In 1605 he wrote 'Britaines monarchie', a manuscript dedicated to King James whose ancestry it traced. It begins with the 'Brittish genealogies and the historie of Brute', this mythological inclusion justified as the 'order which Antiquitie hath left and we by tradition have received' (BL, Add. MS 59741, fol. 8). The king's descent then continues through the Romans, Saxons, Danes, Normans, Scots, and Picts. 
Lyte's principal work was an illustrated copy of the royal genealogy, presented to the king at Whitehall on 12 July 1610. The chart, 'contayning the bredth and circumference of twenty large sheets of Paper', was hung at court 'in an especiall place of eminence' (A. Mundy, 'Briefe Chronicle', 1611, 477-8) and engraved in copper for better preservation. It has disappeared, although Lyte's ink copy survives. It assures James of his 'most rightfull inheritance' (BL, Add. MS 48343) by comparisons with Henry VII; the controversial figure of Mary, queen of Scots, is barely mentioned. The king rewarded Lyte with the extravagant gift of a miniature royal portrait set in gold and diamonds, preserved in the British Museum. It is described as 'the finest Jacobean jewel in existence' (H. C. Smith, 'Jewellery', 1908, 303-4). Lyte died at Lyte's Cary on 18 September 1638 and was buried the next day at Charlton Mackrell among his forebears.

Lyttelton, Sir Charles, third baronet (1629-1716), colonial governor and politician, was born in Frankley, Worcestershire, a younger son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, first baronet (1595/6-1650), royalist officer and politician, and Catherine Crompton (died 1666). As a member of a substantial county family which by the next century had developed into 'a powerful Whig cousinhood' (Montgomery-Massingberd, 92), Lyttelton committed himself wholeheartedly to the royalist cause; he served in the royalist forces at Colchester in 1648, and after their defeat escaped to France, where in 1650 he was appointed cupbearer to the exiled Charles II. He appears to have served as a messenger between the king and his English supporters during the late 1650s, and after the Restoration Charles II recognized his services by knighting him in 1662. That same year Lyttelton and Katherine Fairfax (died 1663), whom he had married in 1661, departed for Jamaica, where Lyttelton was to serve as lieutenant-governor to Thomas Windsor, seventh Baron Windsor. In the course of the voyage Katherine gave birth to the couple's first child, a son, but neither mother nor infant survived for long; both died in January 1663 and were interred in the cathedral at Spanish Town, Jamaica. 
By that time Lyttelton had succeeded to the governorship of Jamaica, Windsor having turned the office over to him on 20 October 1662, a mere ten weeks after the two men's arrival on the island. Lyttelton immediately set to work on the project of developing a full civil government for encouraging English settlement of the colony, which England had acquired from Spain in 1655. He was instrumental in the creation of an island assembly, a body which was 'fairly and indifferently drawn by the votes of all the inhabitants' ('DNB'), and which was responsible for dealing with the colony's financial and legal needs. The assembly passed legislation regarding taxation, hunting, and planting, and set up religious and judicial authorities throughout the island, creating an infrastructure upon which the following decades' prosperity was based. Lyttelton also made Jamaica's internal and external security a priority, granting letters of marque to English privateers, with the intent that they serve as a striking force against potential Spanish and Dutch attacks. He entered into negotiations with the Maroons, African slaves who had run away from Spanish plantations and frequently attacked English settlements, granting them landholdings and promising them 'the same state and freedom as the English enjoy' (Dunn, 242) provided that they cease their raids. Not all Maroons were willing to accept the offer, but enough did so that the threat they posed diminished sufficiently for planters to become more willing to settle in remote areas of the island. Lyttelton's other activities as governor included establishing a town and fortifications at Port Royal, erecting Fort Charles, and repairing St Katherine's Church, in Spanish Town. 
In Lyttelton's opinion, the English settlers were 'generally easy to be governed, yet rather by persuasion then severity' (Cundall, 'The Governors of Jamaica', 19), and local residents asserted that under his administration Jamaica was peaceful, healthy, and prosperous. None the less, on 13 February 1664 the king recalled Lyttelton and issued a warrant for Sir Thomas Modyford to assume the office of governor. On 2 May of that year Lyttelton sailed for England, where he was commissioned as major and subsequently lieutenant-colonel of the lord admiral's regiment, precursor to the Royal Marines. He served as governor of Harwich and Landguard Fort, and then of Sheerness, and after 1682 he and Sir William Beeston acceded to the request of the governor and council of Jamaica that they serve as the London agents for the colony. On 12 May 1685 he entered parliament as member for Bewdley, Worcestershire, a seat he retained until the revolution of 1688, at which time he resigned all of his appointments rather than subscribe to the oaths mandated by William and Mary. In 1693 Lyttelton's elder brother Henry died, allowing him to succeed to the family's title and estates. At this time Lyttelton, his second wife, Anne Temple (died 1718), and their children settled at Hagley, Worcestershire, where Lyttelton spent the remainder of his life. He died at Hagley on 2 May 1716, and was buried with Anne in the vault at Over-Areley, Staffordshire.

Lyttelton, Charles (1714-1768), bishop of Carlisle and antiquary, was born in Hagley, Worcestershire, the third son of the twelve children of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, fourth baronet (1685-1751), MP, and Christian Temple (1688-1759), daughter of Sir Richard Temple of Stowe, Buckinghamshire, and maid of honour to Queen Anne. At least between 1725 and 1728 he was educated at Eton College, where he was a member of Horace Walpole's 'triumvirate' with George Montagu. He was admitted a student at the Middle Temple in 1731, but the following year matriculated from University College, Oxford. However, he returned to the law without taking his degree; he resided in lodgings at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 26 January 1739. He suffered from a severe respiratory illness at this time, taking the waters at Bath in 1739 after four months' poor health, and complained frequently afterwards of a constant cough and winter catarrh. He took annual summer tours on horseback of parts of Great Britain for the sake of his health as well as for interest. 
In 1740 Lyttelton gave up the law for the less strenuous demands of the church, continuing his studies at University College and graduating DCL in 1745. In 1742 he was ordained by the elderly John Hough, bishop of Worcester, and the same year was instituted to the rectory of Alvechurch, Worcestershire. He was ambitious for preferment in the Church of England and had strong family connections with those in government, especially through his brother George Lyttelton, Lord Lyttelton, and his cousin George Grenville. Influence brought him appointment as chaplain-in-ordinary to George II in 1747, with the duty of waiting at court each December, and as dean of Exeter Cathedral in 1748, a position which was worth $500 a year. He was disappointed of a bishopric when vacancies arose in 1756 and 1758, but Grenville helped him secure the bishopric of Carlisle in 1762, worth $1300 a year, and he vacated Alvechurch and Exeter. His means were further increased by a bequest of over 2000 guineas from Lord Angelsea in 1761. Lyttelton had found Exeter remote from London, but in the few months of each year that he was there he began a scheme of restoration and refurbishment in the cathedral, starting in 1751 with reglazing the great east window. He was the first person to recognize the significance of the cathedral muniments and to try to arrange them. He found Carlisle even more remote, the weather disagreeable, the cathedral poorly furnished, and his residence at Rose Castle neglected and stripped by his predecessor. His restoration of the interior of the choir, carried out in collaboration with his amateur architect nephew, Thomas Pitt, Lord Camelford, was probably essential but was condemned as 'barbarous' by R. W. Billings and the new woodwork was removed in 1853-6. His substantial repairs to the Strickland Tower at Rose Castle have also not survived. A sermon on libel preached before the House of Lords in 1765 was his only published religious work; his chief interest in church matters was historical and particularly focused on medieval ecclesiastical architecture. 
Lyttelton's earliest research, from at least 1731, was into Worcestershire history, and in 1738 he purchased the Revd William Thomas's important collection of the papers of Thomas Habington, the seventeenth-century county historian. Lyttelton added further notes on parishes with family connections, and wrote unpublished histories of Alvechurch, Hagley, and Frankley. His collections were used extensively by Dr Treadway Nash for his 'History of Worcestershire' and his account of the fabric of Worcester Cathedral is inserted into Valentine Green's 'History of... Worcester' (1796). He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1740, and his interests developed with a pioneering study of English Romanesque architecture, which was then called Saxon. He attempted to define its distinctive features by an analysis of detail, discussing his findings with other antiquaries from about 1742. With his friend Smart Lethieullier, he collected drawings of Saxon churches, and exhibited them at meetings of the Society of Antiquaries; A. C. Ducarel dedicated his 'Anglo-Norman Antiquities' (1767) to Lyttelton for first interesting him in the subject. Lyttelton's essay, 'Some account of the cathedral church of Exeter', written in 1754 but not published until 1797 by the society, was the first history of the building. The society had no journal for publishing articles until 'Archaeologia' started in 1770, after his death. However, several of Lyttelton's papers were printed in the first three volumes, and demonstrated the breadth of his antiquarian interests, notably 'A dissertation on the antiquity of brick building in England' and a perceptive paper recognizing that stone axes were made before the use of metal. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1743, but his scientific concerns were limited to the study of fossils, on which he wrote two short papers published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1748 and 1750. While publishing very little himself, Lyttelton used his knowledge and influence to assist other scholars. The Cornish historian William Borlase in particular acknowledged his help and wrote 'Observations on... Scilly' in the form of a letter to Lyttelton. 
Lyttelton had assisted the Society of Antiquaries in obtaining its royal charter in 1751, and served as president from 1765 until his death. He was a painstaking and methodical researcher, and his successor as president, Dean Milles, paid tribute to his knowledge of English history, retentive memory, affable temper, and willingness to receive and communicate information on points of antiquity. He was a prolific and informative letter writer, and before his death seems to have intended publishing accounts of his annual tours sent to friends, especially Sanderson Miller. He died, unmarried, at his house in Clifford Street, Westminster, on 22 December 1768, and was buried in the family vault in Hagley church. His estate amounted to $6715 and he bequeathed many of his books and manuscripts, including the thirteenth-century Lindsey psalter, to the Society of Antiquaries. The rest of his letters were subsequently dispersed with other Lyttelton papers by Sothebys at a sale on 12 December 1978, and his accounts at a sale on 20 July 1989.

Lyttelton, George, first Baron Lyttelton (1709-1773), politician and writer, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, fourth baronet (1685-1751), landowner and politician, of Hagley, Worcestershire, and his wife, Christian (1688-1759), the daughter of Sir Richard Temple (1634-1697) and the sister of Richard Temple, first Viscount Cobham (1675-1749). He was born on 17 January 1709, probably two months premature, and baptized the same day at St James's, Westminster. He remained frail in appearance throughout his adult life -- his tall, thin frame, pale face, and lanky gait frequently caricatured by political satirists. Lyttelton was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 11 February 1726, but did not take a degree. He was a talented scholar with strong literary ambitions, whose first poem, 'Blenheim', a patriotic paean to the Churchill family, was published in March 1728, about the time he departed for the grand tour. While in Italy, Lyttelton wrote the outspoken poem 'An Epistle to Mr Pope, from a Young Gentleman at Rome' (published 1730), prompted by the recent appearance of Pope's 'The Dunciad'. Lyttelton depicts Virgil's ghost reprimanding Pope for wasting his talents on 'meaner satire': instead, he should aspire to epic verse and 'join the PATRIOT's to the POET's praise' (Lyttelton, 'Epistle', 5-6). 
Patriotism and poetry were the twin themes which came to dominate and define Lyttelton's own life. The most significant single event in his early political career was Robert Walpole's dismissal in 1733 of his uncle Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, from both his ministerial place and his regiment, part of a government purge meted out on former whig stalwarts who had criticized the ministry for suppressing an investigation into the affairs of the South Sea Company. Cobham retired to his family seat at Stowe in Buckinghamshire and built up a formidable array of opposition support among his cohort of young nephews, using his vast wealth to secure some of them parliamentary seats. Lyttelton may have assisted his father, a loyal Walpole whig, in the campaign that same year to defend Walpole's 'Excise Bill', but by 1735 he had been won over to his uncle's politics, though his father did not (as the press reported) threaten to disinherit him as a result. At a by-election in 1735 Lyttelton was returned for the Pitt family borough, Okehampton in Devon, joining his cousin Thomas Pitt in representing the town. This political group, which included Lyttelton, Thomas Pitt, William Pitt, and Richard Grenville and George Grenville ('the cousinhood'), as well as Viscount Cornbury and William Murray, were known as Cobham's Cubs or the Boy Patriots (all were under thirty in 1735). A new force on the political scene, they attracted praise for their apparently disinterested patriotism as well as ridicule for the Ciceronian rhetoric which distinguished their political speeches. In April 1736 Lyttelton, Pitt, and Richard Grenville provoked controversy with their daring attacks on George II and Walpole in speeches congratulating Frederick, prince of Wales, on his marriage to Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Lyttelton had first been introduced to Frederick in 1732 by Bubb Dodington, and he soon became a close confidant. In 1735 Lyttelton was appointed Frederick's equerry and in 1737 his secretary, promotions widely read as a public declaration of the prince's affiliation with the opposition. 
The friction between the Cobham circle and the group of opposition whigs led by Pulteney and Carteret emerged in rivalry over management of Frederick: it was Lyttelton who warned the prince that Pulteney's parliamentary motion pressing for an increase in the prince's civil-list allowance would damage his popularity. The motion, which Lyttelton in the event supported, was defeated in February 1737. When in late 1737 Frederick finally broke with his parents and established his separate 'court' in Norfolk House, a centre of opposition activity, he came to rely increasingly on Lyttelton for advice: he was, in Pope's words: '
the Man, so near 

His Prince, that writes in Verse, and has his Ear. 
(A. Pope, 'Epilogue to the Satires', 1.45-6)' Lyttelton shared Frederick's cultural interests and was widely perceived as the 'Maecenas' who brought deserving poets to his royal notice. In practice only a handful of poets -- Richard Glover, James Thomson, and David Mallet -- received financial reward, but Lyttelton undoubtedly helped use Frederick's influence to inspire and mobilize a campaign of patriot writing in the late 1730s. On 14 April 1737 the ministerial 'Daily Gazetteer' satirized him as Littledone, a troublemaker who has urged the playwrights of his acquaintance to 'put into their Plays all the strong things they can think of against Courts and Ministers, and Places and Pensions'. Lyttelton's extravagant puff in the opposition journal 'Common Sense' for Glover's patriot epic 'Leonidas' was clearly designed as a hit against the ministry, as well as to incite Pope (whose poetry is compared unfavourably to Glover's) to turn his pen to loftier themes. 
The relationship between Pope and Lyttelton was complex and significant, hinging on shared literary and aesthetic interests. Their extensive correspondence in the period between 1738 and 1741 reveals Lyttelton's efforts to persuade Pope to produce his own 'Moral Song' for the nation, and to act as moral and literary supporter to the prince, to be 'as much with him as you can, Animate him to Virtue' ('Correspondence of Alexander Pope', 4.138). Lyttelton came the closest to achieving this aim during 1738, the year in which Pope was heavily involved with the patriots, editing their stage plays and becoming involved in details of the new broad-bottom coalition within the opposition. Pope twice compliments Lyttelton by name in his two dialogues of the 'Epilogue to the Satires' of that year. It is perhaps significant that, even after Pope's disillusionment with patriot politics set about 1740, Lyttelton's name is absent from Pope's unpublished satiric fragment 'One Thousand Seven Hundred and Forty' indicting other members of the group. 
As a writer himself Lyttelton contributed substantially to the opposition campaign. Although he began his published career as a poet, his 'Observations on the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth', written in 1733 but never published (Hagley MSS), reveals the impact of Bolingbroke's recent 'Remarks on the History of England' in its concern with the politics of Elizabeth's reign. The essay, an imagined conversation between Walter Ralegh, Henry Wotton, and Sir Francis Bacon, is rich in historical parallels with the Walpole era. Two years later Lyttelton's 'Letters from a Persian in England to his Friend at Ispahan' (1735), a series of fictional letters commenting on the manners and mores of Walpolian England, made a significant impact on the literary-political world. Their lively, humorous style coupled with their pointed attacks on the government made them one of the most widely read opposition works, and they went through several editions within the space of a year. Lyttelton also contributed to one of the most important opposition journals, 'Common Sense, or, The Englishman's Journal', started in February 1737 after the demise of 'The Craftsman', taking up that journal's campaign for a unified country opposition. In 1739 he also published, anonymously, 'Considerations upon the Present State of our Affairs at Home and Abroad', one of many warmongering pamphlets of that year, which echoed his own parliamentary speech of February 1739 attacking the convention with Spain. 
In the general election of May 1741 Lyttelton unsuccessfully challenged his tory rival Edmund Lechmere for a seat after an attempt by opposition whigs and tories to share the representation of the two Worcestershire seats had broken down. This quarrel occasioned Sir Charles Hanbury Williams's 'Political Eclogue', a much-cited political satire with a famous caricature of a lofty Lyttelton inappropriately citing Roman precedent to the blunt squire Lechmere. Three months earlier the disunity which dogged opposition attempts to oust Walpole had made itself apparent in Samuel Sandys's unsuccessful motion of 13 February 1741, supported by Lyttelton, to remove Walpole 'from the king's counsels and presence for ever'. The subsequent satirical print series 'The Motion' shows various opposition leaders, including Pulteney, Marchmont, and the unmistakably emaciated figure of Lyttelton, lagging behind a Whitehall-bound stagecoach exclaiming, 'Lost it!', or, 'Oh, my place!'. Walpole was forced to resign office in February 1742. Cobham's cohorts were excluded from the new Pulteneyite administration drawn up in March. Pulteney's later justification for his own desertion of patriotism included the accusation that Lyttelton, Pitt, and the Grenvilles had also entered negotiations with the ministry before February, a charge substantiated by the Ayscough diaries, which showed that Lyttelton, acting with Frederick's approval, had (unsuccessfully) negotiated Walpole's 'Security and Protection' from impeachment in return for ministerial places. 
After Walpole's fall Lyttelton and Pitt remained in the reconstructed broad-bottom opposition, retaining an ambiguous position as members of the household of Frederick, who had become reconciled with his father and the new Pulteney administration. During the next two years Pitt effectively displaced Lyttelton as leader of the Cobham circle: certainly Lyttelton shared little of Pitt's violent anti-Hanoverianism. After the death of Wilmington, Lyttelton was one of a junto of nine then controlling opposition policy who favoured a coalition with the Pelhams to overthrow Carteret. On Carteret's downfall, Lyttelton was appointed a lord of the Treasury in the new broad-bottom administration in December 1744 and was subsequently dismissed from Frederick's household. With the rest of the group he joined Pitt, who was still out of place, in harassing the government: but on Pitt's admission to office in February 1746 he once again became a staunch defender of the administration. 
When his former master Prince Frederick launched the new Leicester House opposition in 1747, Lyttelton, now a staunch ministerialist, was deeply embarrassed by the publication of Bolingbroke's 'The Idea of a Patriot King', an untimely reminder of his former patriot allegiances, and refused Bolingbroke permission publicly to dedicate the work to him, as it had been in its manuscript form in 1738: 'Mr Lyttelton sent him word, that he begged nothing might be inscribed to him that was to reflect on Lord Orford, for that he was now leagued with all Lord Orford's friends' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 20.59). In fact in 1747 Lyttelton himself redeployed for ministerial purposes the same broad-bottom tactics as the new Leicester House opposition in a rival bid to gain tory support for the ministry. In the anonymously published pamphlet 'A Letter to the Tories' (1747), he posed as a non-Jacobite tory in order to exhort the tories to an alliance with the ministerial whigs. His disguise was soon seen through in Horace Walpole's 'Three Letters to the Whigs, Occasion'd by the Letter to the Tories' (1748), but his friend the writer Edward Moore defended him from this attack in 'The Trial of Selim the Persian for Divers High Crimes and Misdemeanours' (also 1748). In the months before Frederick's death in 1751 it appears that Lyttelton, Pitt, and others from the cousinhood had attempted to renew their connections with him: according to Horace Walpole, rumour circulated that after Frederick's death Lyttelton had written a letter to his father lamenting the loss of this new arrangement and that the letter had inadvertently fallen into the wrong hands and been drawn to George II's attention. Egmont noted that no one knew how far this negotiation had really proceeded except the prince, and 'the secret is buried with him in his grave' (Sedgwick, 1.60). 
On the death of his father in September 1751 Lyttelton succeeded to the baronetcy and took over the running of Hagley Hall. In political terms the most significant event of the 1750s was the rift which occurred between himself and other members of the cousinhood, a quarrel which was to last for several years. On Henry Pelham's death in March 1754 Lyttelton resigned his seat on the Treasury board and accepted the post of cofferer in the duke of Newcastle's administration. He refused to join Pitt in opposing Newcastle after the other cousins were turned out, but in November 1755 'on the contrary was made Chancellor of the Exchequer in the room of Legge, which was resented with the greatest acrimony by the whole Cousinhood' ('Memoirs and Speeches of... Waldegrave', 174). Lyttelton was widely regarded as being personally unsuited to the role of chancellor, lacking the financial acuity to master the office. When Newcastle resigned in November 1756 in the face of popular opposition, Lyttelton retired from office, and on 18 November 1756 he was created Baron Lyttelton of Frankley. 
In his personal life during these years Lyttelton experienced the extremes of brief happiness and prolonged unhappiness. Numerous accounts suggest that his personal manner, perhaps as a consequence of shyness, could be awkward and aloof, particularly in his dealings with women. He was fortunate in his first marriage, on 15 June 1742, to Lucy Fortescue (1717/18-1747), the 24-year-old daughter of Hugh Fortescue of Filleigh, Devon, and his wife, Lucy Aylmer. Lyttelton was devoted to her, and Thomson depicts him and his 'lov'd Lucinda' as a latter-day Adam and Eve in the Edenic setting of Hagley in a passage added to 'Spring' (1744). The marriage produced three children, Thomas Lyttelton (1744-1779), Lucy, and Mary. His wife's early death, on 19 January 1747 at the age of twenty-nine, while giving birth to Mary, was a tremendous blow. Lyttelton's 'Monody' to her (probably his most famous poem, later parodied by Smollett) has a simple directness which transcends its literary conventionality. Lyttelton's remarriage two years later, on 10 August 1749, to Elizabeth (1716-1795), the daughter of Sir Robert Rich, fourth baronet (1685-1768), and Elizabeth Griffith, proved a mistake. There seems to have been little warmth between them. The children from his first marriage went to live with their grandmother at Ebrington in Gloucestershire. Lyttelton would arrange for his daughter Lucy to spend time with him at Radway, the home of his friend the architect Sanderson Miller, but her stepmother was never of the party. The marriage became acutely strained in 1756 when 'scandalous reports' (Dickins and Stanton, 346) circulated widely about her affair with George Durant. It reached a crisis in the spring of 1759 when, according to Lyttelton, she made herself the 'talk of the town' (Wyndham, 2.279-80) by writing love letters to an Italian opera singer, Signor Tenduchi, an episode which led to Lyttelton's formal separation from his wife after granting her a separate maintenance equal to her jointure. Yet there were also other consolations during these years. One of these was spiritual. As a young man Lyttelton may well have imbibed some of his uncle Cobham's anti-clericalism, if not atheism. But in 1747 he emerged as a devout Christian, producing, under the influence of his cousin the poet and cleric Gilbert West, his 'Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St Paul', a work to which, Dr Johnson conceded, 'infidelity has never been able to fabricate a specious answer' (Johnson, 3.450). 
Long before he inherited Hagley Hall from his father in 1751, Lyttelton had embarked on the ambitious gardening programme which would make Hagley Park one of the most admired landscape gardens of the eighteenth century. Work was well in hand by July 1739, when Pope made his first visit, and by 1745 he had created a place which rivalled his uncle Cobham's estate at Stowe and was recognized as a distinct advance in garden art. The park enjoyed a spectacular natural situation, and was 'improved' by Lyttelton, who was in part inspired by Pope's ideas. It acquired an Ionic rotunda, a Palladian bridge, a grotto, and a hermitage; on Whichbury Hill within the park the ruins of a Roman camp were 'cut out into ridings... [to afford] many romantic and beautiful scenes' (Brownell, 223). In 1748 Sanderson Miller, doyen of the Gothic, supplied a 'ruined' quasi-medieval tower for the grounds. But the new Hagley Hall designed by Miller and erected between 1756 and 1760 was designed in the fashionable Palladian style, plans for a Gothic building having been rejected. Lyttelton's interest during these years in 'romantick' landscapes pervades his 'Account of a Journey into Wales', written in 1756 though not printed until 1774, one of the earliest Romantic tourist accounts of Wales, containing a notable description of Mount Snowdon's sublimity. 
Lyttelton's historical significance derives as much, if not more, from his extensive activities as a friend and patron of writers as it does from his political career. Although in the late 1730s some of these activities were driven by a political agenda, Lyttelton was also capable of a more disinterested patronage. He genuinely enjoyed the company of writers and took pleasure in involving himself in their literary careers. His friendship with Pope transcended party politics, as did his friendship with James Thomson. Thomson was a frequent visitor at Hagley. It was here that he revised 'The Seasons' in the summer of 1743. The interleaved copy of the first volume of his 1738 'Works', on which Thomson wrote his revisions, also contains many revisions in Lyttelton's own hand. Lyttelton, in his posthumous edition of Thomson's poems, was responsible for revising and shortening 'Liberty' (1735-6), imbuing its patriotism with a slightly more optimistic slant, as befitted a then supporter of the ministry. It was Lyttelton who arranged the posthumous performance of Thomson's tragedy 'Coriolanus' at Covent Garden in January 1749 for his family's benefit. Thomson included an affectionate tribute to Lyttelton in his 'Castle of Indolence' (1748), 'serene yet warm, humane yet firm his mind', a man whose active nature made him a reluctant inhabitant of Thomson's palace of pleasure. 
Lyttelton's friendship with the dramatist and novelist Henry Fielding dated from their schooldays at Eton. The verse epistle that Fielding composed about 1731-2 defending his cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu from Pope's recent attack on her was dedicated to Lyttelton. It has been argued by Thomas Cleary that Fielding's political sympathies closely followed those of Lyttelton and other members of the cousinhood, both in and out of government. It was to Lyttelton that Fielding dedicated 'Tom Jones' (1749), a novel which he had read in manuscript and had done much to promote. It has been suggested that Lyttelton, sometimes known as the Good Lord Lyttelton (in recognition of his moral character, but partly to distinguish him from his reprobate son the 'wicked' Lord Lyttelton), may have helped inspire 'Tom Jones''s Squire Allworthy. Other literary friends were Richard Glover, David Mallet, the love poet James Hammond, William Shenstone, who engraved a tribute to him at The Leasowes, Edward Moore (whom he helped to found the paper 'The World' in 1753), and Voltaire, with whom he corresponded. Yet Lyttelton probably received sharper and more lasting criticism from his role as literary patron than he did from his years as an opposition MP. From the early portrait of the propaganda master Littledone in the late 1730s, to the attacks on him for using his herd of 'placemen and pensionaries' to tout 'Tom Jones' in the coffee houses, through to Smollett's cruel caricature in 'Peregrine Pickle' (1751) of the naive but vain Sir Gosling Scragg, fed with the 'soft pap of dedication', Lyttelton was accused of using his wealth to gratify his vanity and unfairly sway literary opinion. Other writers, notably Lord Hervey and especially Horace Walpole, delighted in ridiculing his unco-ordinated movements, ungainly appearance, and general air of unworldliness. 
Upon his accession to the House of Lords in November 1756 Lyttelton continued to play a vigorous role in political debate, but during the years of political controversy and instability which marked the eight successive ministries between 1757 and 1770 he declined to take office when offered to him, preferring a back-seat role. His rift with the Pitt-Grenville cousinhood lasted for at least eight years. During the debates on the Prussian treaty and the bill for the extension of habeas corpus in 1758 Lyttelton was violently attacked by Temple: both peers were compelled by the house to agree not to take the matter any further. Horace Walpole reported in April 1764 that Lyttelton, Pitt, and Temple had once again become reconciled: that year they attempted to form a party against Lord Bute, and Lyttelton spoke on 30 April 1765 in a debate on the 'Regency Bill' arguing that the regent should be nominated by the king in conjunction with parliament in an effort to curtail Bute's influence. During the efforts to create a new administration in the summer of 1765 Lyttelton refused the offer of the Treasury made by the duke of Cumberland, George III's uncle and intermediary and Pitt's old enemy. Lyttelton once again remained loyal to the cousinhood when he refused Cumberland's offer of a cabinet seat in the new Rockingham administration. He was one of the few peers to protest Rockingham's repeal of the 'Stamp Act' in 1766, an unpopular stance 'delivering down an attestation of their tyrannic principles to posterity' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 22.410) -- incompatible, some thought, with the libertarian principles of Lyttelton's former patriot youth. When it was widely rumoured in September 1767 that Pitt was about to resign, Lyttelton sent Grenville, one of the chief contenders for office, plans for an unlikely coalition ministry between the Grenvillians, Rockinghams, and Bedfords, with himself as 'cabinet councillor extraordinary'. In his last years he joined in the cousinhood's support for Wilkes, in January 1770 openly condemning the proceedings of the Commons against him. 
Much of the energy that Lyttelton had directed at politics in his early years was in his later years channelled into his writing -- two large projects in particular, the 'Dialogues of the Dead', first published anonymously in 1760, and the 'History of the Life of Henry the Second', finally published in 1767. The 'Dialogues of the Dead', three of which, nos. 26-8, were written by the bluestocking writer Elizabeth Montagu, with whom Lyttelton forged a close friendship in his later years, were very well received, going through three editions within three months, the first selling out on the day it appeared, 17 May. Lyttelton published four more new dialogues in 1765, which were added to the rest in a fourth edition that year. The dialogues were frequently reprinted in periodicals and anthologies. Subsequent criticism has been less favourable, much in the vein of Horace Walpole's scathing inversion ''Dead' dialogues' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 21.407). Certainly Lyttelton's 'Dialogues' lack the humour and playfulness of their Lucianic model: the dialogue between Addison and Swift in particular betrays Lyttelton's dislike of satire. Many of the dialogues deal with politics ancient and modern, and here Lyttelton is cautious to avoid offence, offering a balanced moderation between speakers which can seem bland. The most thought-provoking is perhaps that between William Penn and Cortez, a dialogue which seems to undermine the hollowness of Penn's piety and which gives the last word to Cortez. The 'History of the Life of Henry the Second' was Lyttelton's labour of love, a work on which he was engaged intermittently over a period of some thirty years. Lyttelton first mentioned it in a letter to Pope of 13 June 1741, then intending it as a 'Work of some Instruction and Pleasure to my Countrymen, and I hope to the Prince my Master, for whose service I chiefly design it' ('Correspondence of Alexander Pope', 4.348). Frederick was long since dead when the first two volumes and an unnumbered volume of notes were published in 1767, the third volume with notes in December 1771. Lyttelton had clearly been obsessed by the inaccuracy of his printers: Dr Johnson claimed that the work had been printed 'twice over', some parts three or four times, and that this 'ambitious accuracy' cost him at least $1000. Critical opinion was mixed, but many concurred with Walpole that it was a laborious read. 
Lyttelton died at Hagley Hall on 22 August 1773, aged sixty-four. He was buried in the parish church, where he had requested that an inscription to his memory be engraved on his first wife's monument. The account of his death given by his physician appended to Johnson's life of Lyttelton (1774) implies that he may have died of hepatitis. Johnson prints this account in full in his brief biography of Lyttelton to 'spare me the task of his moral character' (Johnson, 3.454). Johnson's apparent distaste for the task in hand may have sprung less from personal dislike of Lyttelton than from his particular suspicion of the two dominant areas of Lyttelton's life, his engagement in the patriot politics of the 1730s (a cause to which the young Johnson had once himself subscribed) and his claims to literary patronage, a Johnsonian 'bete noire'. Ironically, it is precisely to these two areas that more recent accounts of Lyttelton's life and work have paid especial attention.

Lyttelton, George William, fourth Baron Lyttelton and fourth Baron Westcote (1817-1876), educationist, eldest of the three sons of William Henry Lyttelton, third Baron Lyttelton of Frankley and third Baron Westcote of Ballymore (1782-1837), and his wife, Sarah Lyttelton (1787-1870), daughter of George John Spencer, second Earl Spencer, was born in London on 31 March 1817. William Henry Lyttelton (1820-1884) was his younger brother. He was educated at Eton College, 1827-33, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, the following year. His intellectual qualities were rapidly recognized. He was a Newcastle scholar, a medallist (1834), and graduated BA, MA, and joint senior classic in 1838. 
While still at Cambridge, Lyttelton succeeded to the peerage in 1837 on the death of his father. Many of his activities were directed towards the west midlands, where the family home, Hagley Hall, was situated. He was lord lieutenant of Worcestershire from 1839 to the end of his life. He formed an early interest in education, promoting night schools and working men's institutes. He became principal of Queen's College, Birmingham, in 1845, the first president of the Birmingham and Midland Institute in 1853, and he took an active interest in promoting the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations in the midlands. He was one of the founders (1852) of Saltley Training College, Birmingham, a Church of England institution, and taught in the Sunday school at Hagley for many years. Lyttelton's high-church outlook was formed mainly at Cambridge and pervaded his whole life. He took a close interest in episcopal matters and was critical of many aspects of the church. When the Association for Promoting the Reform of Convocation was formed in 1869, he became its first president. 
Lyttelton had become acquainted with Mary Glynne (1813-1857), daughter of Sir Stephen Glynne, eighth baronet, of Hawarden, when he was eighteen. Mary was a year younger than her sister, Catherine, and they were devoted to each other. A double wedding took place at Hawarden in July 1839, between Mary and Lyttelton, and Catherine and William Gladstone. Gladstone admired his new brother-in-law for his brilliant scholarship and his wit. In 1861 the two men published a volume of translations into Greek of part of Milton's 'Comus' and Tennyson's 'Lotos-Eaters' and into Latin of Goldsmith's 'The Deserted Village' and Gray's 'Ode to Adversity' (work on the volume was intended by Gladstone to be a distraction for Lyttelton following the death of his wife). The Glynnes had evolved a private language, Glynnese, which an outsider would not readily have understood. Lyttelton compiled a 'Glossary of the Glynne Language', which was privately printed in 1851. 
Gladstone wrote of Lyttelton's character after his death, 'It was in the highest degree child-like and in the highest degree manly: a manner occasionally blunt veiled a temper of remarkable sweetness' ('Brief Memorials', 47). He possessed a high moral character and held sincerely to his beliefs, often in the face of opposition. Lacking in tact, he gained the reputation of an eccentric. When he was under-secretary of state for the colonies in Peel's administration (January-July 1846) his chief, Gladstone, was obliged to rebuke him for amending the minutes of senior civil servants. Of a manic-depressive temperament, he found the strains of office very great and suffered from depression as a result. He held no further political office. 
Lyttelton's interest in colonial affairs now took a different form. In 1847 Edward Gibbon Wakefield, an expert on colonial settlement, and John Robert Godley, the son of an Anglo-Irish landowner, established the Canterbury Association, a Church of England corporation, which founded the province of Canterbury in New Zealand in 1850. Its aim was to buy up land from the Maori and resell it to settlers. The profits were to be used mainly in founding a cathedral, schools, and a university. The association soon ran into financial problems and Lyttelton, who was never wealthy, as its chairman was called on to assist in clearing the debts. The work of the association occupied much of his time. The port of Lyttelton, near Christchurch, commemorates his connection with the scheme. A new constitution provided for the establishment of six provinces in New Zealand in 1852, and the Canterbury Association was dissolved. Lyttelton visited the colony in 1867-8, and recorded his experiences in two lectures given in 1869. 
From the 1850s there was a revival of public interest in the problems of public education. In an address, 'Thoughts on National Education', delivered in 1855, Lyttelton declared himself in favour of compulsory elementary schooling on a nationwide basis, supported by public funds or rates, though he deprecated attempts to exclude religion from school education. He was a supporter of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, which provided a forum for discussion of educational questions. He was one of the seven members of the royal commission, appointed in 1861, under the chairmanship of the fourth earl of Clarendon, to investigate the state of the nine great public schools. In 1864 another royal commission was instituted, chaired by the first Baron Taunton, to inquire into the 3000 endowed private and proprietary schools not covered by Clarendon. Lyttelton was once more called upon to serve. Although by background an elitist, he believed that intellectual ability should be recognized regardless of class, and favoured scholarships for poor boys. He was also convinced that educational provision for the daughters of the middle classes was inadequate. In 1867 he was responsible for drafting the chapter for the Taunton report which advocated more schools for girls and the training of suitably qualified women to teach them. He surprised many colleagues by changing his views on the question of the conscience clause, now supporting the right of parents to withdraw their children from religious instruction in schools. 
The Taunton commission report, published in 1868, revealed the muddled state of the endowments and their application, and recommended that a new central authority should oversee the administration of education by provincial boards. This recommendation was received with hostility by Conservative politicians, headmasters, and governors. Instead, an 'Endowed Schools Act' the following year empowered a commission to carry out much needed reforms. Gladstone, now prime minister, appointed Lyttelton as head of the endowed school commission, assisted by two other commissioners, to redistribute charitable endowments, reform governing bodies and trustees, and ensure that schools were financially efficient. He confronted well-established institutions in a somewhat quixotic manner and without public support. When the Conservatives came to power in 1874, the commission's work was transferred to the Charity Commission and Lyttelton lost his post. 
Lyttelton's wife, Mary, died in 1857, exhausted by childbearing and leaving eight sons and four daughters. The third son, Neville Gerald Lyttelton, had a military career; the fifth son, Arthur Temple Lyttelton, was a bishop; the eighth son, Alfred Lyttelton, became colonial secretary; and the seventh son, Edward Lyttelton, was a schoolmaster and a cricketer. The second daughter, Lucy Caroline ['see 'Cavendish, Lucy Caroline, 'under' Cavendish, Lord Frederick Charles], was a churchwoman and promoter of women's education, as was the third daughter, Lavinia ['see 'Talbot, Lavinia]. On occasion, the family fielded a full cricket eleven of Lytteltons. 
In 1869 Lyttelton married Sybella Harriet, widow of Humphrey Francis Mildmay MP. They had three daughters. He requested Gladstone to grant him an earldom in November 1873 as he disliked the possibility of inheriting the title of Viscount Cobham from his distant cousin, the duke of Buckingham and Chandos, but this was refused. Lyttelton became increasingly subject to fits of depression and in 1876 he was accompanied by his family to Italy. On his return to London, he was placed under close medical supervision but on Easter Tuesday, 19 April, he managed to elude his attendant and threw himself over the balusters of the staircase in the family house, 18 Park Crescent, Portman Place, London. He died the same day and was buried on 22 April 1876 at Hagley.

Sir Henry Lyttelton, second baronet (1623/4-1693), royalist politician, succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death. He matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 12 September 1640. His first marriage was to Philadelphia (died 2 Aug 1663), daughter of the Hon. Thomas Carey, groom of the bedchamber to Charles I. She was maid of honour to Queen Catherine of Braganza. Secondly he married, on 2 November 1665, at Wroxeter, Shropshire, Lady Elizabeth Newport (died 7 March 1724), daughter of Francis Newport, first earl of Bradford. A royalist, he was taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester (3 September 1651), and was imprisoned in the Tower until April 1653 on a charge of providing arms without licence to the Scottish army.

Lyttelton, Sir Thomas, first baronet (1595/6-1650), royalist army officer and politician, was the eldest son of John Lyttelton MP (1561-1601) of Hagley, Worcestershire, and Muriel (died 1630), daughter of Sir Thomas Bromley, lord chancellor. His father was implicated in Essex's rising (February 1601), and, after being convicted of high treason, died in prison. Thomas matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 22 June 1610, but was a member of Broadgates Hall when he supplicated for the BA degree (2 July 1614). In 1613 he became a student of the Inner Temple. Lyttelton was both knighted and created a baronet in July 1618. He married Catherine (died 1666), daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Crompton of Driffield, Yorkshire, and Hounslow, Middlesex; they had twelve sons and four daughters. He represented Worcestershire in the parliaments of 1621-2, 1624-5, 1625, 1626, and April-May 1640, and in 1640 he served as high sheriff for the county. 
On the outbreak of the civil war Lyttelton offered to raise a regiment of foot and a troop of horse for the king. Charles I consulted him at Shrewsbury in September 1642 about troop movements, and appointed him colonel of the Worcestershire horse and foot (3 September 1642), praising his 'approved fidelity, wisdom, valour and circumspection' ('Diary of Henry Townshend', 2.86). By the beginning of 1643 he was governor of Bewdley, but the county's royalists lacked supplies and failed to overcome their neighbours' indifference. In May 1644 Bewdley, poorly fortified, was taken by a parliamentary force masquerading as stragglers from Prince Rupert's army, and Lyttelton was captured in bed at Tickenhill by Colonel 'Tinker' Fox. He was sent to the Tower of London, and though released on bail, was recommitted (29 November 1644), by parliament, fearful of his influence in Worcestershire. His house at Frankley was burnt to the ground by Prince Rupert to make it unavailable to the parliamentary troops. On 6 March 1645 parliament fined him $4000 for his delinquency, and he was still a prisoner in June 1646. He died at Newcastle House, Clerkenwell, Middlesex, on 22 February 1650, and was buried in Worcester Cathedral. 
Lyttelton's fifth but eldest surviving son, 
On his release Lyttelton joined the action party of royalist conspirators in the midlands, and, as high sheriff of Worcestershire (1654-5), he was able to purchase arms. Although he took no part in Penruddock's rising (1655) -- he may have been deterred from this by the arrest of his brother Charles -- he was implicated, with two of his brothers, in Booth's insurrection (1659) and was again committed to the Tower, where, treated with great respect, he appears to have remained until the Restoration. Charles II wrote to him from Brussels, full of appreciation for his sacrifices and promising future rewards. 
Described by his brother Charles (16 August 1664) as 'dry, illiberal' and 'troubled with his fits of the spleen' (Thompson, 1.36), Lyttelton refused in 1661 both a peerage and an invitation to stand as MP for Worcestershire. He preferred to live on his estates at Upper Arley, Staffordshire (now in Worcestershire), where his vineyards produced light wines pronounced indistinguishable from those of France. At a by-election (21 February 1678) he became MP for Lichfield, but he served on no committees and made no speeches. He retained his seat (March-July 1679) but became totally inactive in parliament, and was even absent at the division on the 'Exclusion Bill'. Indeed he refused all further invitations to stand as MP for Worcestershire and for Lichfield. He was a JP for Worcestershire and Shropshire, deputy lieutenant for Worcestershire and Staffordshire, a freeman of Worcester and an alderman of Bewdley. He died, without children, at Upper Arley on 24 June 1693, and was buried in the local church, where a monument to his memory was erected. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his brother Charles Lyttelton (1629-1716).

Lyttelton, Thomas, second Baron Lyttelton (1744-1779), libertine and politician, was born at Hagley, Worcestershire, on 30 January 1744, the son of George Lyttelton, first Baron Lyttelton of Frankley (1709-1773), and Lucy (1717/18-1747), daughter of Hugh Fortescue of Filleigh, Devon. The dissolute son of a pious father, Lyttelton attracted fascinated, and horrified, attention in life and death. 
He was educated at Marylebone boarding-school between 1756 and 1758 before proceeding to Eton College. He was a precocious boy, and his father had praised him at fifteen for his charm and intelligence, but added: 'my only fear is that he may please the ladies too well' ('Elizabeth Montagu', 140): George begged his friend Elizabeth Montagu to instil the prudent advice that 'no charms are truly amiable but those that are under the government of wisdom and virtue' (ibid., 140-41). By the time Tom was sixteen, doubts were multiplying. At the grand opening of the new Hagley Hall in 1760 he was commissioned, according to Charles Townshend, 'to have opened the ball with the first person of the first class, mutinied, and would dance only with a smart girl he had brought in the morning from a neighbouring village' ('Lothian MSS', 242). In November 1761 he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he received a long letter of advice from Mrs Montagu, explaining that 'the morning of life, like the morning of day, should be dedicated to business' ('Elizabeth Montagu', 253), and advising him to study history. 
In 1763 Lyttelton's father began to negotiate a marriage for him with Anne, daughter of Lieutenant-General Warburton of Winnington, Cheshire. Since the arrangements could not be legalized until he was of age, it was decided to send him on the grand tour to mark time, with expenses paid by his wealthy uncle, Sir Richard Lyttleton. This was a mistake. His companions included the Damer brothers, also Etonians, and scarcely calculated to encourage sobriety. George Damer became involved in a scandal with an Italian coachman, whose family had to be bought off; in 1776 John Damer at the age of thirty-two shot himself in a brothel in Covent Garden in the company of three prostitutes and a blind fiddler. Within a few months Lyttelton had run up heavy gambling debts and had fought two duels. Edward Gibbon, who did devote himself to history, met Lyttelton in Rome and complained that he monopolized the conversation 'avec une volubilite etonnante' (Gibbon, 121). Further acquaintance confirmed 'beaucoup de gasconade' (ibid., 143) and Lyttelton shocked the future historian of the Roman empire by insisting that one could do Rome in twenty days. Nor was Sir Horace Mann, the diplomat, more impressed: 'a very odd young man... his contradictory temper makes it impossible for him to agree with anybody, and his behaviour in general disobliges and offends so that he is shunned both by the English and Italians' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 22.251). A further consequence of his conduct, soon reported home, was that Miss Warburton began to have second thoughts: 'she is trying to find someone she can like better' explained Mrs Montagu (Blunt, 53). The match was called off. 
On returning home in 1765, Lyttelton soon quarrelled with his father and went abroad again, spending some time in prison in Paris after a scuffle in a brothel. Mrs Montagu amiably attributed his misfortunes to 'inexperience' (Blunt, 70), but conceded that 'Mr Lyttelton has so many times acted out the same indiscretions that to assist him again would only be to encourage him' (ibid.). Extricated once more, he stood for Bewdley, a single-seat borough disputed between the Winnington and Lyttelton families, and, after a singularly rowdy election, was returned at the general election of 1768. In a maiden speech in May 1768 he warned of trouble ahead in America, and in November spoke in favour of hearing John Wilkes's complaints. But in January 1769 he was unseated on petition. Looking back on his stay in the Commons, Lyttelton regretted it had been so brief: 'I was possessed of that ready faculty of speech which would have enabled me to make some little figure in the Senate... I mingled in public debate, and received the most flattering testimonies of applause' (Blunt, 80-81). Immediately after his expulsion from the house, Lyttelton resumed his continental travels, mainly in Italy and the Low Countries. John Gray, the historian, journeyed with him from Venice to Milan in the spring of 1771, and commented that he gambled 'like a madman' (Melville, 244). He was also susceptible to gross flattery and 'should others be silent, he will trumpet forth his own excellencies' (ibid., 245). 
Baulked for the time being of a political career, Lyttelton embarked on matrimony. On 26 June 1772, at Halesowen, Staffordshire, he married Apphia (1743-1840), widow of Joseph Peach, governor of Calcutta, and daughter of Broome Witts, of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. 'Lord Lyttelton's son', wrote Mrs Boscawen, 'has persuaded a very rich (and very worthy) East Indian widow... to take him with all his faults; it is to be hoped she will help him to amend them, for tis so great a work that he will want assistance' (Delany, 2nd ser., 1.443). To the dismay of his father, who seems to have admired his prospective daughter-in-law more than her fiance did, Lyttelton brought forward the marriage, less from ardour than because he needed the $20,000 dowry rather urgently. The experiment failed, and the following year -- as told in the broadside 'The Rape of Pomona' -- he absconded to Paris with a barmaid from Bolton's Inn at Hockerill. He was back in time to take part in another drunken brawl in July 1773 over the actress Elizabeth Hartley, an event celebrated in another pamphlet, 'The Vauxhall Affray'. From these fresh predicaments he was rescued in August 1773 by the death of his father, which enabled him to resume his parliamentary career. 
Provided with a new audience, Lyttelton took up his role in the Lords with some enthusiasm. On 22 February 1774 he spoke on the issue of literary property, in favour of authors' rights. He followed in June by supporting the 'Quebec Bill', insisting that the French Canadians had proved their loyalty and were entitled to toleration: 'the gloomy reign of persecution and priestcraft were now at an end' (Cobbett, 'Parl. hist.', 17, 1773-4, 1405). Throughout 1774 and most of 1775, despite his admiration for the former prime minister William Pitt, earl of Chatham, Lyttelton supported the government's attempts to bring the Americans into submission, insisting that there was no distinction between legislation and taxation. On 20 January 1775, when Chatham moved that troops be withdrawn from Boston, Lyttelton asserted his independent support for the administration: 'now, therefore [is] the time to assert the authority of Great Britain' (ibid., 18, 1775-6, 163). Horace Walpole thought highly of his eloquence, and his reported speeches are far from foolish. On 12 May 1775, in a long speech, he moved the second reading of a bill to allow a playhouse in Manchester, remarking that recreation was particularly necessary in new industrial towns and that 'the sixpence spent at a theatre is much better laid out than at an ale-house' (ibid., 635). He had a dislike for the former lord chancellor Charles Pratt, first Baron Camden, whom he attacked on 7 February, and again on 17 May when Camden moved to repeal the 'Quebec Act'. Lyttelton defended it as an excellent bill, based upon the principle of toleration, and insisted that Camden's intentions were to raise a storm and distress ministers. He was sufficiently pleased with his speech to have it printed and circulated. 
But when in the course of the summer his exertions went unrewarded, Lyttelton demonstrated that he could bite. When the new session began in October 1775 he changed sides abruptly and became a savage critic of those whom he had once courted. On 26 October he defended Chatham in his absence, declared that ministers were not to be trusted, and demanded that all acts regarded by the Americans as grievances should be rescinded. On this occasion Lyttelton struck lucky, catching Lord North in one of his moments of despondency. William Nassau de Zuylestein, fourth earl of Rochford, one of the secretaries of state, was unwell and anxious to resign, and Augustus Henry Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton, the lord privy seal, was so dissatisfied that the king urged his dismissal. On 7 November, North warned the king that the ministry was in danger of dissolution. On the same day he minuted that 'Lord Lyttelton has this morning agreed to give a constant support to administration upon condition that he may expect before the end of the session a Privy Council office of the value of $1500 a year' ('Correspondence of George III', 3.280). The outcome was Lyttelton's appointment to the lucrative sinecure of chief justice in eyre, north of Trent, and a second volte-face. On 10 November he attacked 'the audacious, insidious rebels' in America and was warmly congratulated by the first lord of the Admiralty, John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, on 'the finest [speech] ever delivered within these walls' (Cobbett, 'Parl. hist.', 18, 1775-6, 927, 931). 'This hopeful young man', commented Walpole: 'who on being refused a place spoke 'for' the Americans, and in two days, on getting one, 'against' them, being reproached with such precipitate changes, said that with his fortune nobody could expect he thought of the value of the salary. (Walpole, 'Corr.', 24.151)' For most of the rest of his life Lyttelton supported the government, playing a useful, if subsidiary, role. On 14 March 1776 he opposed Grafton's motion for conciliation, saying it would make Britain a laughing-stock; after Saratoga he said that Britain should not give up because of one set-back (5 December 1777), and on 7 December 1778 that the Americans were to blame for the savagery of the contest. But during 1779 he, like others, began to despair. In April he stood aside while Sandwich was attacked, admitting that America could not be regained. According to Walpole he had turned against the court on not being given the seals as secretary of state on the death of Henry Howard, twelfth earl of Suffolk. In June 1779 the king, in a memorandum on a change of government, noted: 'Lord Lyttelton to be removed, his place offered to Lord Beauchamp' ('Correspondence of George III', 4.352). On 27 September 1779 he wrote to North to remove Lyttelton, 'whose private character makes him no credit to my service' (ibid., 4.451). Rather than walk the plank, Lyttelton jumped. On 25 November he launched a violent attack upon the ministers: the war was now a madness and the government 'a rope of sand, crumbling away day by day' (Cobbett, 'Parl. hist.', 20, 1778-9, 1041). This would presumably have done the trick and secured Lyttelton's dismissal had he not died, two days afterwards, at his Surrey home, Pitt Place, Epsom, at the age of thirty-five. He was buried at Hagley. 
Even after his death Lyttelton continued to astonish the world. Within days rumours were circulating of supernatural happenings, and as a ghost Lyttelton stalked throughout much of the nineteenth century. There were two separate accounts. The first, attested by William Henry Lyttelton, first Baron Westcote, Lyttelton's uncle and successor in the Hagley estate, was that before his death Lyttelton had told his friends that a woman had appeared to him, first in the guise of a robin, and prophesied his death within three days. The irrepressible Walpole thought it must be the first time that any female had found difficulty in obtaining entry to Lyttelton's bedchamber. On the third evening Lyttelton had joked that they had 'bilked the ghost', but soon after he retired to bed his manservant found him dead. In view of the life he had led it would be idle to speculate on what illness had carried him off, though 'cramp in his stomach' was suggested ('Eighth Report', HMC, 1.206). The second story was that, at the very moment of his death, his figure had appeared to a friend 30 miles away. The purpose of neither visit was closely identified but Lyttelton would have been pleased to know that he died as he had lived, much talked about. 
Lyttelton is credited with two works, neither proven with certainty. 'Poems by a Young Nobleman Lately Deceased' appeared in 1780, and in a second edition the author was identified as Lyttelton. The 'Monthly Review' thought the poems 'poor, contemptible, and vulgar' ('Monthly Review', 62, 1780, 131), and the 'Gentleman's Magazine' regretted that they had ever been printed. 'Letters by the Late Thomas Lord Lyttelton', distinctly wordy, also appeared in 1780. They were later claimed by William Combe, author of 'Dr Syntax', but his role may have been that of an enthusiastic editor. The suggestion, briefly canvassed, that Lyttelton was the author of the 'Letters of Junius' is preposterous, since he is known to have been on the continent for almost all the time that the letters were appearing.

Lyttelton, William Henry, first Baron Lyttelton and first Baron Westcote (1724-1808), colonial governor and diplomat, was born on 24 December 1724 in London, the sixth son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, fourth baronet (1685-1751), and of his wife, Christian (1688-1759), daughter of Sir Richard Temple. He was at school at Eton College before going to Oxford, where he matriculated at St Mary Hall on 22 June 1742. He entered the Middle Temple on 1 November 1743 and was called to the bar in 1748. Rather than practising the law, however, he went into politics with the encouragement of his kinsman William Pitt, being returned to the House of Commons for his father's borough of Bewdley in 1748. Pitt seems to have been instrumental in his obtaining the governorship of the colony of South Carolina in 1755. 
After being captured at sea and briefly confined in France, Lyttelton reached South Carolina on 1 June 1756. The colony was very rich, exporting great quantities of rice and indigo, but its small white population, heavily outnumbered by African slaves, made it very vulnerable to attack either by the French or by the Native American peoples of the interior. Lyttelton was successful in persuading the fractious assembly that represented the white community to vote money for the colony's defence and to accept policies aimed at conciliating the native peoples. However, relations with the most powerful of them, the Cherokees, remained tense. When in 1759 approximately twenty-four Englishmen were murdered on the Cherokee frontier Lyttelton rejected the credentials of a Cherokee peace delegation and led an armed incursion into Cherokee territory in order to force his own uncompromising terms on the Cherokees. Lyttelton demanded that twenty-four Cherokees be surrendered for execution and that the Cherokees should also kill any French emissaries. Lyttelton's actions provoked a long and costly war, but initially it was widely supported both in South Carolina and in Britain. 
Lyttelton learned in February 1760 that on the strength of his apparent success he had been promoted to the governorship of Jamaica. His friend and political ally, George Montagu Dunk, earl of Halifax, president of the Board of Trade, told him that although the people of South Carolina were losing 'the best governor they ever had', he was getting 'the best government his Majesty has to bestow' (letter of 15 Nov 1759, Lyttelton MSS). Lyttelton left South Carolina for Britain on 4 June 1760. Before leaving Britain for Jamaica he married on 2 June 1761 Mary, daughter of James Macartney of Longford in Ireland. They had two sons and a daughter. She died in Jamaica on 28 May 1765. 
Jamaica, with its great sugar plantations, was the most valued of all British colonies. It too, however, had acute problems of defence and of an assertive white population, often at loggerheads with the governor through their assembly. In December 1764 Lyttelton was drawn into a long and bitter dispute with the assembly over members' claims to the privilege of judicial immunity. Lyttelton believed that such claims were both 'destructive of the just Influence of His Majesty's Prerogative' and contrary to 'Publick Justice' and to the rights of individuals (Greene, 30). In the hope of avoiding conflict while maintaining his position Lyttelton dissolved the assembly three times, but each new assembly -- meeting from March to June 1765, in August 1765, and May 1766 -- continued to assert the privilege of judicial immunity. Lyttelton's threat to seek new powers from the British parliament was at first supported by the Grenville ministry, but the Rockingham administration preferred that he pursue compromise. Unwilling to change his policy Lyttelton left Jamaica on 2 June 1766, leaving his lieutenant-governor, Roger Hope Elletson, to follow the path of conciliation. 
Lyttelton served as ambassador to Portugal from 1767 to 1770, when he left on leave, resigning when required to return. In Britain he married his second wife, Caroline (1745/6-1809), daughter of John Bristowe of Quidenham, Norfolk, on 19 February 1774. They had a son and a daughter. Lyttelton was returned for parliament again for Bewdley in 1774, holding the seat until 1790. He consistently supported the government of Lord North, serving as a lord of the Treasury from 1777 to 1782. In 1776 he was given the Irish title of Baron Westcote of Ballymore. He inherited in 1779 the estates of his nephew Thomas Lyttelton, including the new house at Hagley in Worcestershire, which became his seat. In his few recorded Commons speeches, no doubt influenced by his experiences as a governor, Lyttelton insisted on enforcing the rights of Britain over the colonies by coercion and war, if need be. He went into opposition with North after 1783, but left him to adhere to the Pitt administration in 1787. In 1794 he was given a British peerage as Baron Lyttelton of Frankley. 
Lyttelton shared some of his brother George Lyttelton's ambitions as a poet and man of letters, privately publishing a volume entitled 'Trifles in Verse' in 1803. In his youth he went on the grand tour of Europe with Henry Thrale, and through Thrale's wife, Hester, became acquainted with Samuel Johnson, who dismissed him as having 'more chaff than grain in him' (Balderston, 1.300). Oxford University made him an honorary DCL in 1781. 
Lyttelton died on 14 September 1808 at Hagley, and was buried there. He was survived by his second wife, Caroline, who died on 19 September 1809 at Castle Fraser, Aberdeenshire; by his eldest son with his first wife, George Fulke (1763-1828), who succeeded as second Baron Lyttelton and Westcote; and by his children with his second wife, William Henry Lyttelton, later third Baron Lyttelton and Westcote (1782-1837), and Caroline Anne (died 1833), who married Reginald Pole-Carew (1753-1835), MP. He was predeceased by the other children from his first marriage, Charles (died 1781) and Hester (died 1785), who had married Sir Richard Colt Hoare.

Lyttelton, William Henry, third Baron Lyttelton and third Baron Westcote (1782-1837), politician, was born on 3 April 1782 in Berners Street, London, the son of William Henry Lyttelton, first Baron Lyttelton of Frankley and first Baron Westcote of Ballymore (1724-1808), and his second wife, Caroline (1745/6-1809), daughter of John Bristowe of Quidenham, Norfolk. Lyttelton matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 24 October 1798, graduated BA on 17 June 1802, and MA on 13 December 1805, and was student from December 1800 until 1812. He was a considerable Greek scholar and a favourite of Cyril Jackson, the dean. On 5 July 1810 he was created DCL on the occasion of Lord Grenville's installation as chancellor (he had played some part in the election). He unsuccessfully contested Worcestershire in a by-election in February 1806, but was elected the next year, and represented the county until 1820 as a zealous member of the whig party. 
Lyttelton's maiden speech was made on 27 February 1807 in favour of the rejection of the Westminster petition; and on 16 March he brought forward a motion (rejected by forty-six votes) expressing regret at the substitution of the duke of Portland's administration for Lord Grenville's. He attacked the new ministers, especially Spencer Perceval, for raising a cry about 'religion' and 'awakening the furies of bigotry and fanaticism to the manifest injury of all true religion' (Cobbett, 9.434). In opposition to most members of his party he supported the expedition to Copenhagen, but he voted with them on Whitbread's motion for the production of papers relative to it. Lyttelton felt strongly the old whig jealousy of the influence of the crown and court. In supporting Curwen's bill for the prevention of the sale of seats, he suggested that the duke of York, the late commander-in-chief, had to some degree corrupted members of parliament; and in speaking on the budget resolutions of 1808 he declared that 'the influence of the prerogative had increased fourfold to what it was in former times' (ibid., 11.22). Again, on 4 May 1812, in a debate on the 'Royal Sinecure Offices Bill', he asserted that 'it was notorious that the regent was surrounded with favourites, and as it were hemmed in by minions', and he strongly opposed a clause in the 'Royal Household Bill' (19 March 1819), which awarded an extra grant of $10,000 a year to the duke of York. Nevertheless, Lyttelton in 1819 thought that 'the revolutionary faction of the radicals ought to be opposed'. In the same session, on 2 December 1819, he made a weighty speech in favour of the second reading of the 'Seditious Meetings Prevention Bill', although he blamed ministers for having made the measure necessary by want of conciliation, and thought an inquiry needful into the Peterloo massacre of 1819. Between 1816 and 1819 he actively opposed state lotteries, three times introducing unsuccessful motions against them. 
Lyttelton interested himself also in naval and military questions, and succeeded in obtaining an important modification of the order which deprived officers in the army of their half pay if they were unable to make affidavit that they had no other emolument or employment under the crown, and were not in possession of a certain private income. He also advocated ending the employment of child chimney sweeps, and he was a strong opponent of the property tax. He supported Sheridan's motion of 6 February 1810 against the standing order for the exclusion of strangers from the house. In the same session, on 16 February, he opposed the voting of an annuity to Wellington, whose merits he considered to be far short of those of Nelson. He spoke strongly against the 'Aliens Bill' in 1816 and 1818. In 1820, short of money both for the election and for normal expenditure, he did not stand again. On the death of his half-brother, George Fulke, second baron, on 12 November 1828, he succeeded to the titles. He did not take much part in the debates of the House of Lords, but on 6 December 1831 he made a strong speech in favour of the 'Reform Bill' in the debate on the address. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Worcestershire on 29 May 1833. 
On 3 March 1813, Lyttelton married Lady Sarah Spencer (1787-1870), eldest daughter of George John, second Earl Spencer, who was a lady of the bedchamber (1838-42) and governess to Victoria's children (1842-50) ['see 'Lyttelton, Sarah]. With her he had three sons: George William Lyttelton, who succeeded to the title (and was Gladstone's brother-in-law), Spencer Lyttelton (1818-1882), who became marshal of the ceremonies to the royal household, and William Henry Lyttelton, canon of Gloucester; and two daughters, Caroline ('b'. 1816), who died unmarried, and Lavinia (1821-1850), wife of Henry Glynne, rector of Hawarden. His wife died, aged eighty-two, at Hagley on 13 April 1870; her 'Correspondence', edited by Mrs Hugh Wyndham, was published in 1912. 
Besides his accomplishments as a Greek scholar, Lyttelton enjoyed a great reputation as a wit: for a time the 'Letters of Peter Plymley' were ascribed to him before Sydney Smith's authorship of them was known. In August 1815, through his friendship with the captain, he obtained a passage on board the 'Northumberland' from Portsmouth to Plymouth, and privately printed fifty-two copies of 'An account of Napoleon Buonaparte's coming on board H.M.S. Northumberland, 7 Aug. 1815; with notes of two conversations held with him'; he also printed a 'Catalogue of Pictures at Hagley'. He also published 'Private Devotions for School Boys'; another edition, revised and corrected by his eldest son, appeared in 1869, and further editions until 1885. Lyttelton was a staunch whig, a bad speaker, and a good conversationalist. He died on 30 April 1837 at his brother-in-law's house, Spencer Park in London.

Lyttelton, William Henry (1820-1884), Church of England clergyman, the second of the three sons of William Henry Lyttelton, third Baron Lyttelton (1782-1837), and his wife, Lady Sarah Lyttelton (1787-1870), eldest daughter of George John Spencer, second Earl Spencer, was born on 3 April 1820. After education at Winchester College he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in Michaelmas term 1838 and graduated MA in 1841. Ordained priest in 1844, he held the curacy of Kettering, Northamptonshire, from 1843 to 1845, but for reasons of poor health spent much of this period travelling in Germany, where he came under the influence of a liberal and evangelical theology somewhat at variance with his family's high-churchmanship. In 1847, however, he was appointed by his brother, George William Lyttelton, fourth Baron Lyttelton (1817-1876), to the rectory of Hagley, Worcestershire, where he remained until his death. He was appointed an honorary canon of Worcester in 1850, and a canon of Gloucester in 1880. 
Lyttelton married, on 28 September 1854, Emily, youngest daughter of Henry Pepys (1783-1860), bishop of Worcester. After her death on 12 September 1877, he married, on 5 February 1880, Constance Ellen, youngest daughter of the Hon. Grantham Yorke, dean of Worcester, who survived him. There were no children of either marriage. 
Besides contributing a chapter on the physical geography and geology of the Clent district to William Harris's 'Clentine Rambles' (1868), Lyttelton published some minor works of apologetics. He died at Great Malvern, Worcestershire, on 24 July 1884 and was buried at Hagley.

Lytton, Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer, first Baron Lytton (1803-1873), writer and politician, was born on 25 May 1803 at 31 Baker Street, London, the third and youngest son of Colonel (later General) William Earle Bulwer (1757-1807) of Heydon and Wood Dalling, Norfolk, and Elizabeth Barbara Lytton (1773-1843) of Knebworth, Hertfordshire. His elder brothers were William Earle Lytton Bulwer (1799-1877), who inherited the Bulwer family estates in north Norfolk, and (William) Henry Lytton Earle Bulwer (1801-1872), who was knighted in 1848 and raised to the peerage as Baron Dalling and Bulwer in 1871. His daunting array of names is a source of frequent confusion. His forenames were Edward George Earle Lytton (the last of them being his mother's maiden name). For the first forty years of his life his surname was Bulwer though out of respect for his mother's family, to whose estates he was heir, he often styled himself Edward Lytton Bulwer. When his mother died in 1843 and he came into his inheritance, he changed his surname by royal licence to Bulwer Lytton (without a hyphen, though others sometimes supplied one), thus becoming Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer Lytton. He was created Baron Lytton of Knebworth in 1866. For consistency, and concision, he is referred to below simply as Bulwer, the name by which he was longest known. 
Both sides of Bulwer's family were of ancient descent. Turold Bolver, who appears as one of William the Conqueror's retainers in Bulwer's novel 'Harold' (1848), was assigned the manor of Wood Dalling in Norfolk as part of the Norman settlement. The Bulwers prospered, but established themselves among the county's most prominent landed gentry only in the mid-eighteenth century, when they married into the wealthy Earle family, owners of the neighbouring Heydon Hall. Bulwer's father, William Earle Bulwer, who inherited both estates, was enrolled at Pembroke College, Cambridge; more inclined, in his son's words, to Bacchus than Minerva, he left without taking a degree and embarked on a military career. The Lyttons were of similarly ancient lineage, having given their name to the village of Lytton (now Litton) in the Peak District of Derbyshire, where they settled soon after the conquest. (In 'Harold' another of William's guard at Hastings is named de Littain.) Their seat at Knebworth in Hertfordshire was purchased in 1490 by Sir Robert de Lytton, who had fought alongside Henry Tudor at Bosworth, and who, predictably, appears in Bulwer's novel 'The Last of the Barons' (1843). In the mid-eighteenth century Knebworth descended to Bulwer's maternal grandfather Richard Warburton Lytton, an accomplished but eccentric scholar of classics and oriental languages who separated from his wife soon after the birth of their only child Elizabeth in 1773. Shuttled back and forth between her estranged parents, Elizabeth Lytton grew into a young woman of uncommon intellectual accomplishment and considerable social hauteur. In 1798, after a brief courtship, she married William Bulwer, colonel of the 106th regiment, the Norfolk rangers. It proved an ill-starred union. An energetic and ambitious soldier, Colonel Bulwer was also self-willed, short-tempered, and chronically subject to gout. He had little time for his children, least of all for the infant Edward, on whom his unhappy wife lavished maternal affection in proportion to her husband's brusque indifference. In 1804, having raised two regiments at his own expense, he was promoted to the rank of general and entrusted with the defence of the north-west of England in the anticipated event of a French invasion. He was expecting a peerage from a grateful government when, in July 1807, he died from a stroke. 
Left comfortably off, the widowed Mrs Bulwer moved to London. The two elder boys were sent away to school, and Edward was effectively brought up as an only child. Under his mother's devoted tutelage he was reading by the age of four and writing verse at seven. The most significant event of these early years followed the death of Richard Warburton Lytton in December 1810, when his grandfather's vast library was transferred to London. For the next twelve months, before his mother sold the collection that had all but taken over her house, Edward explored his grandfather's books, delighting especially in chivalric romances but dipping also into all manner of scholarly tomes and obscure treatises, thus acquiring a taste for both romantic legend and antiquarian enquiry that he was never to lose. Already precocious, he was stirred by this voracious browsing to new levels of intellectual pretension, and when, aged eight or nine, he is reported to have asked 'Pray, Mamma, are you not sometimes overcome by the sense of your own identity?' (Lytton, 1.36), his mother decided it was time he was sent to school. 
Over the next two years Bulwer attended three separate establishments, but learned little and failed to make a single friend. Then, at eleven, he was enrolled at Dr Hooker's fashionable academy at Rottingdean, where boys were prepared for entry to Eton College and Harrow School. There at last he drew inspiration from his teachers and found comradeship among his peers. He discovered Scott and Byron, wrote poetry for the school magazine, and excelled at boxing. Four years later, in September 1818, Dr Hooker confessed to Mrs Bulwer Lytton (who had thus changed her name after inheriting the Lytton estates from her father) that there was no more he could realistically offer her son, and recommended that he be sent to a public school. In the event, following an interview with Dr Keate at Eton, the fifteen-year-old Bulwer persuaded his mother that he was altogether too grown-up to continue in formal education, and that he should be allowed to 'leap at once from Master into Mister, from the big boy into the young man' (Lytton, 1.46). Tall and athletically proportioned, already sporting whiskers and a moustache, at fifteen Bulwer carried himself with a self-assurance verging on arrogance. The outward air of confidence, however, masked a nature which at heart was acutely self-conscious and deeply insecure. It was a contradiction that increased with the passage of time. 
From 1819 to 1821 Bulwer studied with a private tutor, the Revd Charles Wallington at Ealing, under whose enlightened care he came to love the classics, and was taught swordsmanship by Byron's fencing-master Henry Angelo. While at Ealing he fell in love with a girl a year or two older than himself, but the romance was abruptly severed when her father took her away without warning and forced her to marry against her wishes. Bulwer was heartbroken, and for several months was plunged into a desperate melancholy. He dramatized the experience in several of his stories, most strikingly, fully fifty years later, in the Lily Mordaunt episode in his novel 'Kenelm Chillingly' (1873). The other major event of his time at Ealing was the publication of his first volume of poetry, the Byronic 'Ismael: an Oriental Tale', which was issued by Hatchards at his mother's expense in April 1820. 
Bulwer went up to Cambridge in January 1822 aged eighteen and a half. After a term at Trinity, which he found stiffly academic, he transferred to Trinity Hall. As a fellow-commoner there he read widely in philosophy, political economy, and social history. His closest friend was Alexander Cockburn, later lord chief justice, who introduced him to the union. After a nervous start Bulwer developed into a regular and not unsuccessful speaker, and served successively as the society's secretary, treasurer, and president. He also maintained a steady literary output during his time as an undergraduate. In 1823 the Cambridge firm of Carpenter & Son published his second volume of rather undistinguished imitative verse, 'Delmour, or, The Tale of a Sylphid', and later that year he was invited by W. M. Praed to write for the newly launched 'Knight's Quarterly Magazine', to which he contributed both poetry and prose under the pseudonym of Edmund Bruce. In the long vacation of 1824 he made a pilgrimage to Ullswater, to visit the grave of the girl he had loved and lost at Ealing, who had written to him on her deathbed. Having passed an overnight vigil on her tomb, he spent several weeks in the Lake District immersed in a self-conscious philosophical solitude similar to that of Erasmus Falkland, the hero of his first novel, which he was drafting at the time. On his return home, in September he renewed an earlier acquaintance with Lady Caroline Lamb, whose house at Brocket Park was just a few miles from Knebworth, and who was recovering from the news of the death of her former lover Lord Byron. Dazzled by her talk of Byron, and intoxicated by the idea of taking his place at her side, the 21-year-old Bulwer, eighteen years her junior, was readily enslaved and rapidly seduced. Throughout the Michaelmas term at Cambridge they exchanged intimate letters, but soon after he came down for the Christmas vacation she cast him off for a new admirer. 
Vain and hypersensitive, Bulwer was deeply offended by the malicious gossip that had attended this liaison, and soon after he left Cambridge in summer 1825 (though it was not until the following year that he proceeded to his ordinary degree) he took himself indignantly off to France. In the Paris of the restored monarchy he indulged for a while in the conventional dissipations of a monied young blood. For all his dandification and exquisite airs, however, Bulwer was too intellectually inclined and too subject to melancholy reflection to be satisfied for long by mere pleasure seeking. After a few months in Paris he moved to the romantic solitude of Versailles, where he read Rousseau and Mill, and completed a new volume of Byronic and satirical verse ('Weeds and Wild Flowers', privately printed later in 1825). The day he returned to London, on 25 April 1826, a week before his twenty-third birthday, he attended a soiree and there met the woman who became his wife. Beautiful, headstrong, and extravagant, Rosina Anne Doyle Wheeler ['see 'Lytton, Rosina Anne Doyle Bulwer (1802-1882)] was the youngest child of Francis Massy Wheeler, who had inherited a crumbling house and impoverished estate in co. Tipperary, where he lounged by day and drank by night, and Anna Doyle Wheeler, an Owenite socialist and advocate of women's rights. Rosina's parents separated when she was nine. After a tempestuous upbringing with her mother in Guernsey and France, in 1825 she was introduced into London society by her great-uncle Sir John Doyle. Mrs Bulwer Lytton disapproved strongly of her son's liaison, which cut across her plans for him to make a brilliant marriage as a stepping-stone to a public career. She regarded Rosina as a vulgar Irish adventuress, and did all in her power to prevent the relationship from developing. Bulwer's genuine desire not to upset his mother was reinforced by a prudent assessment of the practical consequences of marrying against her wishes. By the provisions of his father's will his independent income was barely $200 per annum; that he was living at ten times this level was due solely to his mother's generous allowance. In the event, and though Rosina's private income was less than half his own, the courtship continued and they were finally married on 29 August 1827. Obdurate to the last, Mrs Bulwer Lytton refused to attend the ceremony, and for a full year thereafter would neither receive her son nor answer his repeated and anguished letters. She also terminated his allowance. The couple set up home in the country, at Woodcot House in Oxfordshire, 6 miles from Reading, an imposing residence whose rent and upkeep accounted for virtually their entire combined income. With his allowance suspended and a luxurious lifestyle to support, Bulwer immediately set about earning money by the only means that seemed appropriate -- namely by writing. During the next decade he published a dozen novels, two dozen short stories, five plays, two volumes of poetry, a history of Athens, a sociological survey of English life, and at least a hundred periodical essays and reviews. By 1834, barely ten years after Bulwer the undergraduate was awarded the chancellor's medal for English verse at Cambridge, Bulwer the literary lion and best-seller was hailed by the 'American Quarterly Review' as 'without doubt, the most popular writer now living' (16.507). 
Bulwer's professional literary career began modestly, when Henry Colburn issued his first novel, 'Falkland', in March 1827. A lurid tale of adultery and gloomy philosophical posturing, it attracted little attention and sold poorly. Despite this, Colburn recognized the potential of his new recruit and offered $500 for another novel. Utterly different in character, 'Pelham, or, The Adventures of a Gentleman', published in May 1828, became a huge best-seller (George IV is reported to have ordered several copies to ensure that it would be available in each of his residences). Henry Pelham is the most consummate dandy in the canon of 'silver fork' fiction, his affectation of wearing black for dinner setting a fashion for evening dress that has persisted to the present day. Significantly, however, he is unsatisfied by the empty extravagances which he has elevated to an art form, and his tireless exertion to clear a friend of a charge of murder measures his transformation from self-indulgent fop to productive citizen. This pattern of growth from egotism to an awareness of social obligation marks the beginning of a moral agenda that was to dominate several of Bulwer's novels over the following decade. In the first of these, 'The Disowned' (December 1828), which replicated the formula of social satire intermixed with sensational incident, the hero is a soberly contemplative scholar who learns that self-fulfilment proceeds from philanthropic action rather than solitary thought. Less didactic in its conception, 'Devereux' (1829) is a rambling tale of political intrigue and Gothic melodrama set in the early eighteenth century, whose chief interest lies in its portrayal of the good and the great of the period: Swift and Pope, Bolingbroke and Voltaire, Louis XIV and Peter the Great. It is notable also for the rhetorical excesses of its apostrophic style: 'Wild brooklet... Fortune freights not your channels with her hoarded stores, and Pleasure ventures not her silken sails upon your tide' (1.63). This mannered floridity of diction, accompanied by the persistent capitalization of abstract nouns, was to become a distinguishing and disfiguring feature of Bulwer's prose. 

'Paul Clifford' (1830) represented a radical new departure. Its eponymous hero was a highwayman, and its leading aim was to expose the pointless barbarity of the penal code of the day. The book's guiding moral was neatly expressed in its final sentence: 'The very worst use to which you can put a man is to hang him'; though more recently, and far less seriously (such being Bulwer's late-twentieth-century fate), attention has focused rather on its opening words -- 'It was a dark and stormy night.' In 'Eugene Aram' (1832) Bulwer took Newgate fiction into unprecedented territory by fashioning a hero out of a notorious murderer. The historic Aram was an itinerant provincial schoolmaster (he had briefly been tutor to Bulwer's aunts in Norfolk) who was hanged for murder in 1759. In the novel he is presented as a high-minded philosopher who, ground down by poverty, had been induced to take part in a robbery which turned to murder. Wracked for years by guilt, he is subsequently redeemed by love, only to be arrested on the day of his wedding. Predictably, the book gave rise to a storm of indignant protest, even as it ran through numerous editions. Bulwer's condescending aristocratic manner and air of intellectual superiority had already provoked the hostility of reviewers such as Lockhart, Maginn, and Thackeray, who had mounted a barrage of vituperative attacks on him in the 'Quarterly Review' and 'Fraser's Magazine'. Now the entire tribe of London literary journals rose almost as one to condemn the immorality of the book and the hypocrisy of its author. Smarting from this experience, Bulwer issued his next novel ('Godolphin', 1833) anonymously. The tactic backfired. Without the talismanic name of Bulwer to commend it, the story of Percy Godolphin's progress from intellectual self-absorption to the altruistic vision of a great and gifted soul proved a rare commercial failure, despite the blood-curdling catastrophes that crowded its pages. The reviews, at least, were merely lukewarm -- even, deliberately so, that in the 'New Monthly Magazine', which was written by Bulwer himself. He had been editing the journal since November 1831, responsible for regular features such as the 'Monthly commentary' and 'The politician', as well as for numerous individual essays and reviews, some of which were later collected in 'Asmodeus at Large' (1833) and 'The Student' (1835). 
In summer 1833 the strain of incessant work led to a breakdown in Bulwer's health. In August he resigned the editorship of the 'New Monthly', and in September he set out with Rosina on a recuperative visit to Italy. That same month saw the publication of his most original work of non-fiction, 'England and the English': a survey of the current state of politics, society, and manners; education, morality, and religion; art, literature, and science. Few of his contemporaries could have attempted so ambitious an account of the national character; still fewer could have carried it off with such consistent 'elan'. On his return from Italy in February 1834 he brought with him the near-completed manuscript of what became his single most successful book, 'The Last Days of Pompeii'. Published in July 1834, it rapidly achieved classic status and remained a best-seller for the rest of the century; it was translated into at least ten languages (no fewer than sixteen French impressions had been issued by 1864), was frequently dramatized, and twice adapted as an opera. Two years after the death of Scott, Bulwer's epic tale of Roman indulgence, Christian martyrdom, and the cataclysmic eruption of Vesuvius established him as the most popular historical novelist of the day. This standing was confirmed by 'Rienzi, Last of the Tribunes' (1835), about the rise and fall of the demagogue who briefly seized power from the warring baronial factions of late-fourteenth-century Rome. Gibbon had dismissed Rienzi as a mixture of the knave and the madman; for Bulwer he is a hero and visionary, whose fanatical pursuit of popular liberty is fired by the inner strength of his aspiring spirit. An amalgam of careful scholarship and wilful invention, of political allegory, philosophical idealism, and extreme melodrama, the novel was the direct inspiration of Wagner's opera of the same name. 
As already indicated, Bulwer's literary output during this period was not restricted to novels. His other major publications included the narrative poem 'O'Neill, or, The Rebel' (1827) and the verse satire 'The Siamese Twins' (1831); a loosely connected set of short stories entitled 'The Pilgrims of the Rhine' (1834); the historical study 'Athens: its Rise and Fall' (1837); and the illustrated novella 'Leila, or, The Siege of Granada' (1838). Between 1836 and 1840 he wrote five plays for his friend the actor-manager William Macready. Two of these, 'The Duchess de la Valliere' (1836) and 'The Sea-Captain' (1839), were merely successful; the melodrama 'The Lady of Lyons' (1838) and the comedy of manners 'Money' (1840) proved among the most resilient stage works of the Victorian era; while the historical verse drama 'Richelieu' (1839) contains the most famous words he ever wrote: '
Beneath the rule of men entirely great 

The pen is mightier than the sword. 
(II.ii)' After parting company with the 'New Monthly' he continued his journalistic career by contributing regularly to the 'Edinburgh Review' and, from March to October 1838, by editing the short-lived 'Monthly Chronicle'. It was in the latter that he published his long essay 'On art in fiction', a pioneering account of the theory and practice of the genre which marked his most significant contribution to the literature of the 1830s. This contribution was appropriately crowned by 'Ernest Maltravers' (1837) and its sequel 'Alice, or, The Mysteries' (1838), whose 2000 pages are filled to overflowing with the grand passions, romantic adventures, and philosophical disquisitions that had come to characterize Bulwer's fiction. The most exemplary and programmatic of his 'Bildungsromane', the story of Maltravers's six-volume apprenticeship to politics, literature, and love examines (in the capitalized words of the preface) the effect of worldly experience on 'those great principles by which alone we can work out the Science of Life -- a desire for the Good, a passion for the Honest, a yearning after the True'. Time and again, it was the intellectual content of Bulwer's fiction which his contemporaries singled out as its main distinguishing feature. Whether anatomizing the social causes of crime, exhuming representative episodes in history, or analysing the dynamics of spiritual aspiration, his novels were habitually grounded in a rigorous examination of moral, political, and philosophical issues. Each in its own way was designed as much to educate as to entertain; by 1837 he had become 'the metaphysician-novelist of England' ('Monthly Magazine', 24.541). 
After two years at Woodcot, where their daughter Emily was born in June 1828, the Bulwers moved to London. Effeminately handsome and languidly aristocratic, with his long auburn hair in ringlets and his six-foot frame resplendent in the latest fashions, the author of 'Pelham' was feted to a degree which must have gratified even his vanity. He had been paid $900 for 'The Disowned' and a princely $1500 for 'Devereux', all of which and more he laid out in late 1829 on the purchase and extravagant furnishing of 36 Hertford Street, just off Park Lane. There, neglecting his wife and child, he devoted himself to political networking and literary endeavour. He worked incessantly, like a man possessed. Exhausted and explosively irritable, he was described by a family friend as seeming 'like a man who has been flayed, and is sore all over' (Lytton, 1.249). The domestic quarrels that inevitably ensued were exacerbated by the restoration of more cordial relations between Bulwer and his mother (who had finally agreed to receive him soon after the publication of his significantly titled novel 'The Disowned'). Already jealous of his fashionable friends such as the young Disraeli and Lady Blessington, and excluded from his career aspirations, Rosina now felt increasingly supplanted in his emotions by her domineering mother-in-law. It was in this inauspicious context of literary drudgery, mounting debts, and marital friction that Bulwer embarked on his political career. 
In April 1831 Bulwer was elected MP for St Ives in Huntingdonshire, as an independent radical. His maiden speech on 5 July was in support of the second reading of the 'Reform Bill', one result of whose passage in the following year was to sweep away his own constituency. At the general election of December 1832 he successfully stood for Lincoln, which he represented until 1841. As a back-bencher he promoted legislation on issues of literary, intellectual, and libertarian interest. His bill to establish dramatic copyright was enacted in 1833; his campaign against the monopoly of London's patent theatres (Covent Garden and Drury Lane) led to the abolition of the royal patent in 1843; his persistent call for the reduction of stamp duty on newspapers (the so-called 'taxes on knowledge') finally bore fruit in 1855, when the duty was repealed. Only in the boldest of these initiatives was he frustrated: first mounted in 1832, his impassioned challenge of the crown's right to censor plays, through the office of the lord chamberlain, remained unrealized for well over a century. (By a nice irony, the last lord chamberlain to exercise this power before its abolition in 1968 was the husband of Bulwer's great-granddaughter.) As a speaker Bulwer was unimpressive: his voice was weak, high-pitched, and betrayed the occasional stammer; his style of delivery was self-conscious and oratorically mannered. Appropriately, it was the power of his pen that marked the most influential moment of his political career. When the king dismissed Lord Melbourne's ministry in November 1834 and invited the duke of Wellington to form a government, Bulwer wrote a pamphlet in support of the whigs (whom, as a radical, he disliked rather less than the tories) entitled 'A Letter to a Late Cabinet Minister on the Current Crisis'. Within six weeks it had run through twenty-one editions, sold 30,000 copies, and was widely believed to have influenced the result of the ensuing election. In recognition the victorious Melbourne offered Bulwer a junior lordship of the admiralty, which he declined -- presumably as insufficient inducement to change his party affiliation. By the late 1830s, however, Bulwer's opposition to household suffrage and the repeal of the corn laws signalled a break with the mainstream radicals. In July 1838 Lord Melbourne recommended him for a baronetcy (ostensibly for services to literature) in Queen Victoria's coronation honours, but at the general election of 1841 he lost his seat to a tory. He did not return to parliament until 1852. 
The demands of Bulwer's political career placed further strain on a marriage which had rapidly ceased to be as romantic as the courtship that preceded it. His neglect of his wife and family was unchecked by the birth of a son, Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton (1831-1891), in November 1831, and his ostentatious philandering with the society beauty Mrs Robert Stanhope in 1833 threatened to break the marriage apart. Later that year, hoping to rekindle their relationship, the Bulwers left the children with a governess and travelled to Italy. The trip was a disaster. He was fascinated by the country, she detested it. In Rome, which she described as 'dirty, barbarous and dismal' (Lytton, 1.266), Bulwer left Rosina to her own devices and threw himself into work on 'Rienzi'; in Naples, while he studied with the archaeologist Sir William Gell, she flirted outrageously with a Neapolitan prince. They quarrelled violently and returned to England. There, by degrees embittered, recriminatory, and hysterical, they decided on a trial separation, whereupon he promptly embarked on another affair (with a Miss Laura Deacon, who remained his clandestine partner for many years and by whom he had three children). Extremely provoked, in February 1836 Rosina raided his apartments at the Albany and publicly accused him of entertaining his mistress there. The die was now irrevocably cast. On 19 April 1836 they signed a formal deed of separation, citing 'incompatibility of temper'. 
Bulwer's creative energy remained undiminished, despite increasing problems with his health, and in the early 1840s he published three major novels in quick succession. The sensational melodrama 'Night and Morning' (1841) turns on the moral distinction between socially induced criminality and socially respectable vice. 'Zanoni' (1842), arguably his most original work of fiction, is set during the French Revolution and steeped in the occult lore of which he had become a serious student. The eponymous hero is a Rosicrucian sage who has mastered the secret of immortality but relinquishes this gift to save the life of the woman he loves. The spectacular denouement, in which he dies in her place on the guillotine, clearly anticipates that of 'A Tale of Two Cities' almost twenty years later. In 'The Last of the Barons' (1843), which follows the career of Warwick 'the Kingmaker' in the Wars of the Roses, Bulwer portrays the eclipse of baronial power in the late fifteenth century as prefiguring that of the landowning aristocracy in the nineteenth -- in each case by middle-class commercial interests. His poetic output in the 1840s was similarly wide-ranging. The miscellaneous collection headed 'Eva, a True Story of Light and Darkness' (1842) was followed by a translation, 'The Poems and Ballads of Schiller' (1844), prefaced by a long biographical essay; then by 'The New Timon' (1846), a discursive romance of contemporary London in heroic couplets; and finally by 'King Arthur' (1848-9), a gargantuan epic in twelve books which proved an embarrassing failure. After a hiatus of almost four years, in December 1846 he returned to prose fiction with 'Lucretia, or, The Children of Night', another sensational tale of criminal low life (based on the true story of the forger Thomas Wainewright) which prompted another round of indignant critical attacks, to which Bulwer responded in his pamphlet 'A Word to the Public' (1847). 'Harold, the Last of the Saxon Kings' (1848) addressed less contentious ground; the novelistic product of painstaking research, its account of the Norman invasion exemplified the heavily footnoted, scholarly antiquarian style which Bulwer had made his own. In a distinctly lighter vein, and scaling new heights of popular success, 'The Caxtons' (1849) chronicles the domestic life of an amiably eccentric family, focusing in particular on the youthful experiences of the outlandishly named Pisistratus Caxton, who eventually emigrates to Australia to retrieve the family's fortunes. 
With the renewal of his political career, Bulwer's literary activity in the 1850s was restricted to just one play, two novels, and a handful of essays and stories. The comic drama 'Not so Bad as we Seem' was written to raise funds for the Guild of Literature and Art which he and Dickens had established to support impoverished authors. It was first produced at a gala performance before the queen and Prince Albert at Devonshire House in May 1851; besides Dickens himself, the amateur cast included Wilkie Collins, Douglas Jerrold, John Forster, Mark Lemon, John Tenniel, and Augustus Egg. The sprawling four-volume sagas of English provincial life ''My Novel'' (1853) and 'What Will he Do with it?' (1859), each billed as 'by Pisistratus Caxton', sought to extend the winning formula of 'The Caxtons', but their invention was less spontaneous and their humour more laboured. Though his new publications were few, the commercial value of Bulwer's backlist was growing in proportion to the ever greater demand for cheap fiction from an ever larger reading public. In 1853 George Routledge paid the unprecedented sum of $20,000 for a ten-year lease of the copyrights to his nineteen existing novels. Of the various cheap formats in which these were then reissued, the 1's'. 6died 'Railway Library' proved the most successful, and in 1857 W. H. Smith reported that Bulwer was the most requested author at his station bookstalls. 
Bulwer's next novel, 'A Strange Story' (1862), was commissioned by Dickens -- for many years past a personal friend and literary admirer -- for the weekly magazine 'All the Year Round'. A powerful tale of murder and madness, of magic and the 'elixir vitae', its underlying aim was to reveal the inability of natural science to explain supernatural phenomena. It is better known today, however, for providing Bulwer with the opportunity of persuading Dickens to alter the ending of 'Great Expectations' (as a 'quid pro quo' for Dickens's editorial advice on the conclusion to 'A Strange Story'). Characteristically, the novel was underpinned by voracious reading in the relevant scientific and philosophical literature, much of which is more explicitly manifest in his essay collection 'Caxtoniana' (1863). Further volumes of verse, 'St Stephens' (1860), 'The Boatman' (1864), 'Poems' (1865), and 'The Lost Tales of Miletus' (1866), were followed by two plays, 'The Rightful Heir' (1868) and 'Walpole' (1869), and then by a translation, 'The Odes and Epodes of Horace' (1869). His short novel 'The Coming Race' (published anonymously in 1871), a dystopian satire on evolutionary theory and the emancipation of women, is one of the earliest English examples of science fiction. An American mining engineer descends into the centre of the earth and encounters a subterranean people whose extraordinary technological and telekinetic power derives from their control of a mysterious energy called vril. The book proved so popular (it ran through eight editions in eighteen months) that the word vril briefly entered the language, signifying a strength-giving elixir: the name of the famous beef extract product Bovril is a composite of 'bovine' and 'vril'. 'Kenelm Chillingly', a throwback to Bulwer's philosophical 'Bildungsromane' of the 1830s, was issued just days after his death in January 1873; its first impression of 3150 three-volume sets sold out on the day of publication. 'The Parisians' (1873), a tale of politics and society set during the last days of the second French empire, and the unfinished novel of ancient Greece 'Pausanias the Spartan' (1876) were both published posthumously, thus bringing to a close a career that had spanned six decades at the forefront of English letters. 
Very few of Bulwer's contemporaries were as prolific, and none was as successful in so many genres. During his lifetime he was outsold only by Dickens, and only Dickens was more widely translated. For thirty years after his death he remained a pillar of the literary establishment; besides innumerable cheap reprints, no fewer than twenty-five multi-volume collections of his complete novels were issued in Britain and America between 1875 and 1900. The twentieth century, however, witnessed a sharp decline in Bulwer's popularity. The reasons for this eclipse are closely bound up with those for his earlier success. Bulwer's great gift was to anticipate and define contemporary taste. With his ornately rhetorical style and lofty moralizing manner he was pre-eminently a writer for his own time, and as that time passed so did his special appeal. In certain quarters he had been roundly condemned for both tendencies from the outset: no other Victorian writer of note attracted such consistent critical animosity or was more cruelly parodied. As Ruskin noted in 1840, 'Everybody has a spite at Bulwer because the public think him clever, and they don't' ('The Diaries of John Ruskin', ed. J. Evans and J. H. Whitehouse, 3 vols., 1956-9, 1.82). When he ceased to appeal to the common reader his reputation sank almost without trace. Nevertheless, his historical significance was immense, for he epitomized that category of writers who, in his own words: 'form a link in the great chain of a nation's authors, which may be afterwards forgotten by the superficial, but without which the chain would be incomplete. And thus if not first-rate for all time, they have been first-rate in their own day. ('Ernest Maltravers', 1.286)' 

When they separated in 1836 the Bulwers were both thirty-three. Nine turbulent years of marriage now gave way to nearly forty of unrelenting misery. Rosina exacted a furious revenge for being cast off by her husband, and being denied access to her children, doing all in her power to blacken his name and poison his happiness. Whatever the merits of her case, her remorseless litany of abuse struck home, and to the end of his days Bulwer was humiliated and embittered by the spectre of scandal. By the deed of separation Rosina was granted an annuity of $400, a sum she considered grossly inadequate to her needs and expectations. Like Bulwer himself ten years earlier, she turned to literature to supplement her income, and in novels such as 'Cheveley, or, The Man of Honour' (1839) and 'The Budget of the Bubble Family' (1840) she ridiculed thinly veiled representations of her estranged husband and his pretentious family. Acutely embarrassed at thus being held up to public derision, Bulwer grew ever closer to his mother, whom he had come to venerate as his one constant support against the malice of the world. When she died in December 1843 he was overcome by grief. 'All that I have ever met in the world of sympathy, generosity, and faithful friendship', he wrote to a friend, 'is identified with the name of Mother. The thought of that loss seems to me like the taking away of the candle from a child who is terrified at the dark' (Lytton, 2.21). Four years later his daughter Emily died of typhus fever at the age of nineteen. Rosina, recently returned from a nine-year exile on the continent, accused him of precipitating her death by wilful neglect. Painfully aware that he had done little to secure Emily's happiness by consigning her to a succession of governesses, Bulwer was doubly distraught. The trauma of his daughter's death encouraged him to cultivate the affection of his son (who was later to become viceroy of India and first earl of Lytton) and for the remainder of his life he derived great satisfaction from their intimacy. Meanwhile Rosina intensified her campaign of abuse. On the occasion of the royal premiere of 'Not so Bad as we Seem' in 1851 she wrote to Prince Albert threatening to pelt the queen with rotten eggs for supporting the work of a scoundrel. She also had playbills pasted up around Devonshire House advertising 'Even Worse than we Seem' by 'Sir Liar-Coward Bulwer Lytton, who has translated his poor daughter into Heaven, and nobly leaves his wife to live on public charity'. Six years later, with his political career in the ascendant, she further embarrassed him by issuing a pamphlet entitled 'Lady Bulwer Lytton's Appeal to the Justice and Charity of the English Public' (1857). Worse was to follow. At the parliamentary election at Hertford on 8 June 1858 (which was to confirm him in the recently offered post of colonial secretary), in the midst of his address from the hustings Rosina pushed her way through the crowd and denounced him as a monster who should himself have been transported to the colonies long ago for mistreating his wife and murdering his daughter. Deeply humiliated and sorely provoked, he reacted by having her committed to a private asylum. He had, however, underestimated the influence of her friends, and of his enemies: mobilizing the anti-government press on her behalf, she was released within the month, whereupon Bulwer felt obliged to increase her settlement and pay off her debts. Despite this concession, in 1864 she embarked on another round of public attacks, addressing spiteful letters to his political colleagues and literary friends (to Wilkie Collins, for example, she insisted that Count Fosco in 'The Woman in White' was a poor representative of villainy when compared to her husband). Rosina died in obscurity in March 1882, still obsessed by her ill treatment at his hands. Each of them the product of an unhappy union, their own marriage proved among the most publicly acrimonious of the century. 
After losing his seat in parliament, during the early 1840s Bulwer showed little interest in party politics, but towards the end of the decade his renewed friendship with Disraeli and his growing sympathy for Disraeli's brand of toryism rekindled his ambitions. In spring 1851 he published another influential pamphlet, 'Letters to John Bull', which criticized the notion of free trade as a universal panacea for social and economic ills. In thus attacking both the whig administration and its radical supporters, he had little option but to align himself formally with the Conservative opposition. The electors of his home county of Hertfordshire invited him to stand as their representative, and at the general election of July 1852 he re-entered parliament as a tory. Despite the deafness which inhibited his performance in debates, he soon became a front-bench spokesman, notably in his bellicose advocacy of the army's cause in the Crimean War. In 1858 Lord Derby offered him the post of secretary of state for the colonies in the new tory government. Though cut short by illness, his brief period of office was marked by two notable achievements: the establishment in 1858 of the new colony of British Columbia, and the separation from New South Wales in 1859 of the new colony of Queensland (there are towns named Lytton in all three territories). Ill health forced him to resign his office in December 1859 but he retained his seat until 1866, when Lord Derby offered him the peerage he had long coveted in recognition of the public distinction of the Lytton family as well as of his own political service. In the event, isolated and increasingly infirm, he never spoke in the Lords. 
Bulwer's health had never been robust. From the age of sixteen he had suffered from an irritation of the middle ear which caused severe pain and progressively impaired his hearing, while the pressure of incessant work and the nervous tension engendered by his domestic troubles took a heavy toll on an already fragile constitution. Frustrated at the ineffectiveness of the drugs, purgatives, and bleeding recommended by his physicians, in the early 1840s he began to read widely in medical and quasi-medical literature. When, in January 1844, he suffered another complete collapse in the wake of his mother's death, against all professional advice he turned to Dr Wilson's hydropathic establishment at Malvern. He recorded his appreciation of hydrotherapy in the pamphlet 'Confessions and Observations of a Water Patient' (1845), and for the rest of his life he maintained a keen interest in 'alternative' medicine, particularly as concerned the diagnosis and treatment of nervous disorders. When the vogue for spiritualism crossed the Atlantic in the early 1850s, he attended seances by the prominent mediums D. D. Home, Alexis Didier, and Charles H. Forster. In 1853 he confided to his son that 'there are wonderful phenomena in our being all unknown to existing philosophy' (Lytton, 2.44), and though sceptical of fashionable clairvoyants he was convinced that agencies of spiritual communication known to the magi of old were still recoverable if one could but penetrate their mysteries. He attended experiments conducted by the hypnotist James Braid, the phrenologist John Ashburner, and the mesmerist John Elliottson, seizing on them as a potential key to a 'scientific' understanding of the hidden life of the spirit, which he had earlier sought through exhaustive research into the hermetic tradition of the ancients and the occult arts of the middle ages. 
To the end Bulwer remained a bundle of contradictions: at once hugely ambitious and painfully shy, generous of spirit but haughty in manner, profoundly intellectual yet regularly dismissed as superficial. Though craving recognition, he hid behind a protective mask of lofty self-assurance and aristocratic superiority which provoked exactly the opposite response. Over the course of a long career he made the acquaintance of most of the leading writers and politicians of the day, but he had very few close friends (most notably Disraeli and Dickens, Lady Blessington and John Forster). He received his share of public honours -- baronetcy and peerage, knight grand cross of St Michael and St George, honorary doctorates at both Oxford and Cambridge -- but in his private life he became an increasingly retiring and lonely figure, whose chief satisfaction derived from solitary study rather than from social intercourse. From the 1840s onwards he spent long periods abroad, most often in Germany and the south of France. Though he kept up a London residence (taking a succession of houses in Mayfair and Park Lane), he was always happiest out of the public gaze at his ancestral home of Knebworth, which in the mid-1850s he gothicized with turrets, domes, and gargoyles. He was equally solicitous of his personal appearance, dyeing his hair and resorting to corsets and make-up to disguise the ageing process. In 1874, when describing Charles Greville as the vainest man who had ever lived, Disraeli added 'and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer' (W. F. Monypenny and G. E. Buckle, 'The Life of Benjamin Disraeli', 1910-20, 5.348). Bulwer died at Argyll Hall, Torquay, on 18 January 1873, probably from a cerebral abscess brought on by the middle ear complaint which had afflicted him throughout his adult life. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, and obituaries marked the passing of England's foremost man of letters. Fifty years later G. K. Chesterton provided a more cautious epitaph when he remarked that, quite simply, 'you could not have the Victorian Age without him' ('The Victorian Age in Literature', 1916, 1925 edn., p. 136).

Lytton, Edward Robert Bulwer-, first earl of Lytton (1831-1891), viceroy of India and poet, was the only son of Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer Lytton, first Baron Lytton (1803-1873), and his wife, Rosina, 'nee' Wheeler (1802-1882) ['see 'Lytton, Rosina Anne Doyle Bulwer]. He was born in London on 8 November 1831 and educated first privately, then at Harrow School and at Bonn, where he specialized in modern languages. He began composing poetry early and showed a precocious talent. Although not published until 1855, most of the poems in his first volume, 'Clytemnestra, The Earl's Return and other Poems' (which went under the pseudonym Owen Meredith), were written before 1849. This was followed in 1857 by 'The Wanderer', a volume of lyrical poems. Both were fairly well received by literary audiences, particularly for their poetic diction, vivid description and strokes of imagination. Reviews such as those in the 'Edinburgh Review' and the London 'Spectator' were guarded, however, speaking largely of the poet's youth and promise, and his need to develop his powers. In form, the poems were widely held to be too imitative of Browning. Lytton's interests in poetry at this time brought him into contact with London literary circles where he developed friendships with Charles Dickens and John Forster. He was especially close to Forster, conducting a voluminous correspondence with him, and acting as one of his executors at Forster's death in 1876. 
Lytton was at the same time pursuing a diplomatic career. In 1849 he went to Washington as private secretary to the ambassador, his uncle (William) Henry Lytton Earle Bulwer, Baron Dalling. He acted in the same capacity when Dalling was moved to Florence before becoming paid attache to the embassies at The Hague and then Vienna. From Vienna he went to Belgrade as acting consul-general and collected commercial intelligence. In 1862 he was appointed second secretary at Vienna, and in 1863 was made secretary of legation at Copenhagen at the time of the marriage of Princess Alexandra of Denmark with the prince of Wales. Lytton himself married, in 1864, Edith Villiers ['see below']. In the same year he served at Athens and in the following year at Lisbon, where he negotiated an important commercial treaty. At both of these courts he also acted as charge d'affaires. 
Meanwhile, Lytton's literary reputation was further enhanced by the publication in 1860 of 'Lucile', a novel in verse, which some reviewers objected would have been as well cast in prose. It was a poem with which later he was to become disenchanted. It represented the first of a series of experiments in which he attempted to reproduce in the English language the rhythms and diction of continental prose and verse. In 'Lucile' he drew heavily on George Sand's 'Lavinia' and sought to catch, in rhyming anapaestic couplets, the sensibilities of the French novel. The next year, in conjunction with his friend Julian Fane, he wrote 'Tannhauser' (published under the pseudonyms Neville Temple and Edward Trevor). In the same year he published 'Serbski pesme', based upon Serbian national songs. These works had a very mixed reception. His 'Tannhauser' was thought a pallid imitation of Tennyson and his 'Serbski pesme' was subjected to a severe attack by Lord Strangford in the pages of the 'Saturday Review'. 
None the less, Lytton persevered, and reproduced his Serb-derived poems in the appendix to 'Orval, or, The Fool in Time' (1869). 'Orval' was a paraphrase of Count Sigismund Krasinski's 'Infernal Comedy' and was heavily influenced by the Polish school of mystical poetry which had arisen out of the loss of Polish independence. Lytton became closely associated with the count, and was attracted to the idea of writing heroic social drama. In 1868 he had published 'Chronicles and Characters', which consisted of poetic imitations of great men at the time of great events, from the era of Greek mythology to the days of Richelieu. However, it was compared unfavourably to Victor Hugo's 'Legend des siecles'. Lytton had to wait until the publication of 'Fables in Song' (1874) to establish his full poetic reputation. 'Fables in Song' expressed his own voice much more directly and was credited with gracefulness and luminosity. The next year he privately circulated among friends 'King Poppy', which he came to regard as his finest achievement. However, he was unable to revise it for publication until shortly before his death, and it appeared only posthumously, in 1892. 
During these years Lytton also continued his diplomatic career, being successively employed from 1868 to 1872 at Madrid and then at Vienna, where he had a large share in the negotiation of another commercial treaty. From 1872 to 1874 he was secretary to the embassy at Paris; in November 1874 he was promoted to be British minister at Lisbon. In January 1873 he succeeded as second Baron Lytton on the death of his father, to whom he was deeply attached. A two-volume biography of his father which he published in 1883 dealt extensively with the latter's early literary and political career. However, it drew to a close before 1836, the year in which his father and mother began the acrimonious separation proceedings which -- in law courts, on theatrical stages, and in literary works -- were to scandalize polite society for the next thirty years. Lytton's loyalties were clear, and one commentator observed that the biography was 'only too complete on the unhappy relations between his father and mother' ('Chambers', 638). 
The most significant phase of Lytton's public life began in January 1876 when, a year after Lytton had declined the governorship of Madras, Disraeli offered him the viceroyalty of India in succession to Lord Northbrook. The appointment, which was usually reserved for politicians rather than men of letters, caused general astonishment. But Disraeli, a literary man himself, was insistent. It may have been that he saw in Lytton's highly developed romantic sensibility the perfect instrument for one of his own most favoured projects -- the proclamation of Queen Victoria as queen empress of India and the construction around her of a new system of imperial monarchy. These were to represent the first, and visually the most stunning, of Britain's many contributions to the culture of the new imperialism which was rising in Europe at this time. 
Lytton arrived in India, and was installed as viceroy on 12 April 1876. He immediately threw himself into the task of organizing a great durbar, or pageant, to celebrate the proclamation; this took place on 1 January 1877. The key feature of the durbar, which attempted to hark back to the rituals of the Mughal empire, was the ceremonial display of loyalty and fealty to the queen empress expressed by India's own princes and maharajas. Since the Indian Mutiny of 1857 British policy had turned away from seeking to expand direct rule and to transform and Westernize Indian society. A new respect had been found for the remaining indigenous princes, who still held a third of the sub-continent's territory and on whose 'traditional authority' the British now hoped to build the pillars of their raj. Lytton's durbar publicly symbolized their closer association with the crown as well as the new ethos of conservatism which marked the era. Critics, both at the time and since, have mocked the garishness of the durbar's displays and its blatant invention of oriental traditions, devised to suit melodramatic European tastes rather than faithfully to recreate the Mughal past. But the durbar's rituals were to set a public style of rulership which henceforth characterized the British raj, and provided inspiration for the new ceremonials of imperial monarchy which were subsequently developed in Britain to celebrate coronations and royal weddings and jubilees. In India, the new alliance with the princes held firm until the very last decade of British rule. 
In a variety of other ways too, Lytton's viceroyalty served the ends of the new imperialism and the growing assertiveness of British power in the world. But they were ways which provoked high levels of controversy and revealed deepening contradictions in Britain's imperial project. Lytton's term of office was one of the most turbulent in viceregal history, ending in widespread public outcry, the defeat of Lord Beaconsfield's government, and the near bankruptcy of the government of India. 
On the one hand, and in sharp contrast to a rhetoric aimed at evoking India's medieval princely past, Lytton pushed hard to advance British economic interests, even at the expense of the revenues and economy of India itself. Much influenced during his diplomatic career by the ideology of free trade, he enacted in India the repeal of the duties on cotton imports against the advice and votes of virtually his entire executive council. This emboldened him to pursue a radical reform of the whole customs and excise system which was to make India one of the most advanced free-trading economies in the world. In his last year in office he also gave his fervent support to a plan greatly to improve India's internal systems of transport and communication, most notably by vastly expanding the railways. How a supposedly traditional and princely India might have survived the large-scale onslaught of modern technology -- any more than of free-market economics -- is not clear, but the India Office quashed most of the plan for reasons of financial stringency. 
On the other hand, Lytton's sympathies for India's princes also conflicted with his attitudes towards the traditional rulers just beyond its borders. In what was to become the 'cause celebre' of his viceroyalty, he adopted a very 'forward' policy towards Afghanistan and provoked the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Ostensibly, his actions in Afghanistan were a defensive response to Russian expansion towards Turkmenistan and Samarkand which threatened the neutrality of Kabul. This was the more the case because failures by the British in 1873 to provide guarantees of protection to the Afghan amir, Sher Ali, had alienated him from their cause and opened the way for increasing Russian influence. However, there is much in Lytton's conduct to suggest that Beaconsfield's government had long decided on a policy aimed at bringing Afghanistan directly under the control of British Indian authority. The idea that it should be in relations with Calcutta, which secured for India a 'scientific frontier', was included in the treaty of Gandamak, signed with the puppet Amir Yakub in 1879. And Lytton clung to the notion of extending the Indian railway system to Kandahar in order to anchor the kingdom permanently to the sub-continent to its south. 
The Afghan imbroglio began shortly after Lytton's installation as viceroy. He immediately dispatched an emissary to Sher Ali requesting treaty discussions. When the amir refused even to admit the emissary, Lytton was provoked to the celebrated remark that Afghanistan was merely 'an earthern pipkin between two metal pots'. Other problems delayed the crushing of the pipkin for a further two years. Then, in 1878, Lytton launched an invasion across the Khyber and Bolan passes which initially met with considerable success. Sher Ali was forced to flee Kabul, dying in exile the next year, and a new amir, the British client Yakub, was imposed in his stead. A permanent residency was also established under the direction of Major Louis Cavagnari, a notorious member of the 'forward' school who had little regard for or sensitivity towards indigenous peoples. Cavagnari cabled regular reports stressing the popular 'support' which the invasion was receiving and the 'calm' which it had restored to Afghan society. On 2 September 1879 he informed Lytton, 'All well'. The next day Cavagnari, his staff, and their entire escort were massacred inside the residency at the start of a large-scale uprising which had been brewing for many months. Lytton responded by unleashing a new conquest force; this met with bitter resistance and made only slow progress. British soldiers matched Afghan brutality measure for measure until stories of atrocities began to circulate back in England. The escalating costs of the war also caused widespread concern, although their full extent was not known until afterwards. In February 1880 Lytton even managed to post a budget showing a surplus of $400,000; however, due to peculiarities in the system of military accounting, this was later revealed to conceal a deficit in excess of $4 million. The total cost of the war was $17,490,000 against Lytton's own estimate of $5,750,000. In addition, $5 million was spent on constructing railways at the frontier. 
In Britain, the Second Anglo-Afghan War became a major issue at the general election of March 1880, where Beaconsfield's Conservative government was soundly beaten by W. E. Gladstone's Liberals. Lytton promptly tendered his resignation, which was handed to the queen at the same time as Lord Beaconsfield's own. The Gladstone government appointed Lord Ripon as viceroy and dispatched him with the first task of extracting the army from Afghanistan, ending the war, and terminating the 'forward' policy. 
Yet if the controversy surrounding the Anglo-Afghan War represented the highest point of contention in Lytton's viceroyalty, it cannot be said to have been an isolated peak. From the very beginning his term of office was conflictual, especially in relation to two other issues. First, he came to alienate the rising class of Western-educated Indians, who were then starting to express their own political voice, and then to play an inadvertent role in stimulating Indian nationalism. In 1878, to silence vociferous criticism of his Afghan adventure, he passed the 'Vernacular Press Act', which singled out newspapers published in Indian languages and subjected them to procedures of censorship. This was widely regarded in India as a tacit form of racial discrimination and a sign of the hollowness of the promise in the queen empress's proclamation that all her subjects within the empire were to be accorded equal rights. At the time of the proclamation the promise had been baited with the offer to open immediately one-sixth of the vacancies in the Indian Civil Service to native-born Indians. Its emptiness may be judged from the fact that it took another forty years for this goal to be achieved. Lytton's viceroyalty highlighted that contradiction between the words and the actions of British imperialism which was to provide the animus behind the eventual foundation of the Indian National Congress in 1885. 
The second issue also had a bearing on Indian nationalism, although it was scarcely less important for provoking anti-imperial sentiment in Britain. Shortly after Lytton took up office, one of the worst famines in British Indian history broke in the south and the west. The severe loss of life which followed in its wake contrasted sharply with imperial propaganda which had long emphasized the benefits bestowed on India by British rule. There were even suggestions that British misrule had been a primary cause of the famine, an accusation brought to the attention of the British public by the activities of the journalist William Digby and the businessman Dadabhai Naoroji, a British resident, who was a Liberal member of parliament and later three times a president of the Indian National Congress. Lytton sought to have the charges repudiated in Britain while, in India, he reformed the procedures of famine administration so drastically as to hint that there may have been substance to them. The nature of his reforms remains controversial. Convinced of the efficacy of free trade, he staunchly supported the policies of Sir John Strachey and Sir Richard Temple which eschewed direct intervention in the grain market but instead offered money for work. However, the policy may have underestimated the weakness at that time of the infrastructure supporting a system of market distribution. Large areas of the country were poorly served by railways and roads and as many as 5 million people died of starvation during the famine. 
None the less, the long-term effects of the establishment of the new famine code were undoubtedly beneficial and mark the most significant -- and perhaps the only -- achievement of Lytton's viceroyalty. Market infrastructure was much improved by roads built under the money-for-work programme. In addition, procedures for monitoring drought and price levels were put in place in order to detect and take preventive measures against potential famine ahead of time. A royal commission on famine in India (1880) explored the conditions behind the original disaster and gave its approval to the new famine code, which served (and continues to serve) India down to the end of the twentieth century. After 1876-8, no subsequent famine was to cause remotely so much devastation and loss of life, and between 1901 and 1943 India was safeguarded from famine entirely. 
Following his resignation Lytton returned to England; he was created earl of Lytton on 28 April 1880. He made one speech in the House of Lords in defence of his Afghanistan policy but then withdrew from public life for several years, during which time he concentrated on his writings, producing the two-volume biography of his father and several other works. He had high hopes of 'Glenaveril', a narrative poem in six books published in 1885, but it was not well received. However, his 'After Paradise' (1887), which returned to the spirit of 'Fables in Song', drew more positive critical acclaim. In 1887 he was elected lord rector of Glasgow University and then, amid characteristic controversy and voluble opposition, was appointed ambassador to France. 
Lytton was not at all in sympathy with the politics of the Third Republic. He did, however, have an extensive knowledge of French literature and culture which was to stand him in good stead. He converted the British embassy into a literary salon regularly attended by the cream of Parisian intellectual society in which French politicians of different parties could also meet and converse. His role became that of influencing discussion rather than leading and directing it. In consequence, he drew praise from all sides and can be credited with having preserved and developed friendly relations with France during a period of repeated political irritations. He did not accept his belated acclaim gracefully, once remarking: 'I devoted my life to India and everybody abused me. I come here, do nothing and am praised to the skies' ('DNB'). He continued to write poetry. 'The Ring of Amasis' (1890), which he reworked from an earlier romance, was a disappointment. But his 'Marah', which drew on Heine, and 'King Poppy' (published posthumously in 1891 and 1892 respectively) were among his most distinguished efforts. Lytton died very suddenly at the British embassy, 39 faubourg St Honore, Paris, on 24 November 1891, and was buried at his family's country seat at Knebworth, Hertfordshire. He was survived by his wife, 
After Lytton's death Lady Lytton faced straitened financial circumstances. Her husband had been a particular favourite of the queen, who had even permitted him the rare distinction, while viceroy, of addressing her in the first person. She responded to Lady Lytton's plight by inviting her -- in a letter also written in the first person -- to attend court as a lady-in-waiting. This role Lady Lytton performed from 1895 to 1905, serving also Queen Alexandra. During the first four years of her service she kept a diary, parts of which were published many years after her death. It records the daily comings and goings and the gossip of the court during Queen Victoria's last years. In 1905 she withdrew from court to a long retirement spent quietly in a house built for her on the Knebworth estate. The house maintained her connections with India for it was designed by her son-in-law Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was the principal architect of the last British imperial capital at New Delhi. She died in her ninety-sixth year, on 17 September 1936, and was buried beside her husband at Knebworth. 
Both during his lifetime and afterwards, Lord Lytton was compared to the ideal 'Renaissance man'. Certainly his talents -- as poet, linguist, diplomat, and statesman -- were many and varied. However, his greatest achievements came in those areas for which he had only limited regard. His bearing, interest in culture, and knowledge of European languages made him highly successful at moving in the diplomatic circles of aristocratic Europe, and also at introducing to English audiences the genius of the continental Romantic movement. But his own poetry and statesmanship were marked by over-ambition. With the exception of two or three works, his poetry lacked originality and rarely rose above the level of pastiche. In addition, the elaboration of the famine code apart, his viceroyalty in India was a many-sided failure which helped to set the British raj on the path to its eventual extinction. His disaster in Afghanistan broke the spell of British invincibility and encouraged other European powers then rising to challenge for colonial possessions and a share of world dominance. His policies of discriminating between the rights of British and of Indian subjects within the empire and of favouring the traditions of the princes over the modernities represented by the Western-educated classes contributed to the deepening isolation and ossification of the imperial state. As imperial rituals and display became ever grander, the British raj alienated ever broader sections of Indian public opinion and doomed itself to fall among the first victims to anti-colonial nationalism in the twentieth century.
