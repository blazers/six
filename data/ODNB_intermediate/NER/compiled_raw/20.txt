Colnaghi family (per. c.1785-1911), art dealers, were established in England by Paul Colnaghi (1751-1833), who was born in the Brianza region near Milan, the younger son of Martino Colnago (died 1783), a distinguished Milanese lawyer, and his wife, Ippolita Raggi. Having settled his father's encumbered estate, Paul left Italy for France in 1783 and became the Paris agent of Antony Torre to sell English prints from a shop in the Palais Royal in 1784. Antony Torre was the son of Giovanni Battista Torre (died 1780), who had established himself, first in London in 1753, then in Paris in 1760, as a maker of fireworks and instruments (principally barometers and thermometers) and bookseller. Antony ran a London branch at 14 Market Lane, Pall Mall, from 1767. On his father's death, Antony entered briefly (1780-82) into partnership with an optician, Ciceri of Milan (who had employed Paul Colnaghi on his arrival in Paris), before asking Colnaghi, on Ciceri's recommendation, to open his Paris branch. 
Torre and Colnaghi became partners in May 1785, when Colnaghi moved to London (and was naturalized English), and brothers-in-law when Paul married Maria Elizabetha (Elizabeth) Baker, sister to Antony's wife, on 21 March 1787. The Market Lane shop was abandoned in 1786 for grander premises at 132 Pall Mall, and two years later Torre handed the business over to Colnaghi. After a brief partnership with Anthony Molteno, printseller, Colnaghi assumed full control. Thus the firm, which began as instrument makers and booksellers in 1760, only later specializing in printselling, underwent a similar evolution to that of Agnews sixty years later. 
Paul Colnaghi must have been an impressive man, erudite, fluent in several languages, and charming; he attracted Benjamin Franklin's notice in Paris and was almost persuaded by him to emigrate to America. Giovanni Battista Torre's shop in the rue St Honore had become a meeting place for savants, and for collectors of English mezzotints (known as 'maniere anglaise') by William Woollett, William Sharp, and Sir Robert Strange and coloured stipple-prints by Francesco Bartolozzi (1727-1815), a superb engraver with whom the firm dealt for forty years. The flourishing market for English prints collapsed with the outbreak of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars; but Colnaghi survived by shrewdly publishing such popular colour stipple engravings as 'The Cries of London', after Francis Wheatley, in 1792-7, and a portrait of Nelson, after Hoppner, which appeared on the day (7 November 1805) that news came of the battle of Trafalgar. He also supplied the British government with views of besieged towns on the continent, thus providing invaluable information for the attacking allied armies. 
In 1799 Paul Colnaghi moved his London premises to 23 Cockspur Street, where he held monthly 3 o'clock levees attended by the aristocracy and landed gentry. From these sprang a series of engraved portraits entitled 'Royal and Noble Ladies'; Lawrence was paid $700 for permission to engrave his painting of Princess Charlotte (1817; Belgian Royal Collection). Appointed printseller to the prince regent, Colnaghi received further royal warrants from him as George IV, and from William IV; other royal patrons included the duc d'Orleans and the duc d'Aumale. 
Paul and Elizabeth Colnaghi had three sons and two daughters: the elder son, Dominic Charles Colnaghi (1790-1879), was born at 132 Pall Mall, London, on 15 July 1790; another son, Martin Henry Lewis Gaetano, followed, and there was a daughter, Caroline ('b'. 'c'.1786). All three siblings worked in the firm, but Dominic was the most outstanding and joined his father about 1808-10. He travelled to Italy in 1816-17 and collected specimens of armour, thus opening up a new field of connoisseurship. He sold these to Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick (1783-1848) in 1818, and continued to act for this famous antiquarian; much of Sir Richard Wallace's collection (Wallace Collection, London) originally came from Meyrick. 
Martin Colnaghi ('c'.1792-1851) was also active, but showed less judgement and diligence than his brother. In 1821 Paul Colnaghi wished to retire to Italy and settled the business, then worth some $25,000 in stock, on his two sons. Martin quarrelled with his father and brother, and in 1824 sued them in chancery. The suit was settled in April 1825, through the good offices of a family friend, by buying out Martin for $3000. Paul and Dominic Colnaghi then moved to 14 Pall Mall East and began trading as P. and D. Colnaghi & Co., the name by which the firm is still known. Martin remained at Cockspur Street, and the two brothers thereafter ruthlessly bid against each other, to Paul's chagrin. John Constable, with whom the family became intimate, as the correspondence between Dominic and Constable attests, recorded in his journal for 16 June 1824: 'I hear there is quite a bustle at Colnaghi's.... They are all brisking up. Martin seems to be clearing the house of the old man & Dominic -- but he is not quite liked himself -- he is said to make love to all the ladies who look over prints there. ('Constable's Correspondence', 4.154)' Constable had reason to be grateful to Paul, who, vouching for the Paris-based dealer John Arrowsmith, enabled Constable to show 'The Hay Wain' (1821; National Gallery, London) at the Paris Salon in 1824, where it created a sensation and won him a gold medal. Colnaghi's tried, with only moderate success, to sell prints after Constable's work, and acted as his agents for the 1827 Paris Salon exhibition. In November 1829 Paul admitted his daughter, Caroline, into partnership until her son John Anthony Scott (died 1864) came of age. On 30 September 1807 Caroline had married John Scott (1784-1821), editor of 'The Champion', who had died after a duel defending the 'Cockney school' of poetry. A subscription for the widow raised $800, which enabled her to join the firm. After Constable's death in 1837 Dominic Colnaghi helped lead the subscription campaign to purchase 'The Cornfield' (1826) for the National Gallery. 
Dominic Colnaghi married Catherine Pontet (died 1881) on 15 October 1831, and they had two sons, neither of whom entered the firm, but the elder, Sir Dominic Ellis Colnaghi (1834-1908), became a consular official; posted to Florence in 1865, he served as consul-general for northern Italy from 1881 to 1896, and wrote 'A Dictionary of Florentine Painters from the Thirteenth to the Seventeenth Centuries', which was edited by P. G. Konody and Selwyn Brinton and published posthumously in 1928 (reprinted 1986). 
Dominic Colnaghi greatly admired the work of R. P. Bonington, and in 1827 commissioned from him a number of Italian scenes with Shakespearian characters. After the artist's death the following year Dominic organized the two-day sale of his work at Sothebys in July 1829, buying thirty-five lots for himself, and later that year issued thirteen lithographs after Bonington's Scottish views. Some insight into Dominic Colnaghi's activities for special clients such as Sir Robert Peel emerges from his correspondence with Peel in November and December 1842, when he informed him about the availability of a Lawrence portrait of Lord Brougham (presumably the one of 'c'.1825 now in the National Portrait Gallery, London) that the owner was willing to sell; and in March 1844 Colnaghi explained that Lawrence painted two versions of a portrait of Antonio Canova, the sculptor. There is also a contract with Henry Graves & Co. for a joint venture of August 1836 for selling an engraving by James Bromley after Sir George Hayter's portrait of Lord John Russell, then home secretary, in an edition of 750 prints, the proceeds to be evenly divided between Graves and Colnaghi. This continued the tradition, begun by Paul Colnaghi, of selling engraved portraits of prominent personalities of the day. Paul Colnaghi died, after a short illness, at his London home in St George's Place, Hanover Square, on 26 August 1833, aged eighty-two. His son Dominic and his daughter, Caroline Scott, took over the business, with her son John Anthony Scott and his cousin Andrew McKay joining as clerks. Dominic, or Old Dom as he became affectionately known, continued with the firm until about 1865, when he retired. He died at his home, 62 Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, on 19 December 1879, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. 
In 1858 Colnaghis joined with Agnews in publishing 'The Gems of the Art Treasury', two de luxe volumes of photographs by Leonida Caldesi and Montecchi of the exhibition held at Manchester in 1857. The possibilities of this new medium were speedily recognized, and in 1864 Julia Margaret Cameron contracted with Colnaghis for the sale of her photographs; in 1866 she held an exhibition there. Earlier, in 1854, John Anthony Scott had commissioned William Simpson to tour the Crimea to prepare material for an account of the war, illustrated with forty lithographs and published in two folios as 'The Seat of the War in the East' (1855-6), which earned the firm $12,000. After John Anthony Scott's death in 1864, Andrew McKay became sole proprietor, to be joined by his son William as partner in 1879. After his father's retirement William took over, and introduced E. F. Deprez (retired 1907) and Otto Gutekunst (retired 1939) as partners in 1894; but the direct family link with P. and D. Colnaghi & Co. ended with William McKay's retirement in 1911. 
Paul Colnaghi's younger son, Martin, married Fanny Boyce Clarke, and their eldest son, Martin Henry Colnaghi (1821-1908) -- baptized Martino Enrico Luigi Gaetano -- was born at 23 Cockspur Street, London, on 16 November 1821. Although he was educated for the army, his father's bankruptcy in August 1843 thwarted this ambition. The elder Martin Colnaghi traded first as Colnaghi & Co. (from 1825), and from 1840 as Colnaghi and Puckle, the business passing to Edward Puckle in 1845. Martin died in Piccadilly in May 1851. Martin Henry struggled to established himself, and for two or three years organized the system of railway advertising afterwards taken over by W. H. Smith. 
About 1860 Martin Henry Colnaghi turned to art, and for some years travelled as an expert and buyer for his uncle Dominic's firm (although he was never a partner), then for Henry Graves, and then on his own account. He began to specialize in Dutch and Flemish seventeenth-century art, working from his house in Pimlico. He 'discovered' Jan van Goyen, and dealt in many works by Frans Hals, long before these masters became fashionable; among the first important collections he helped to form was that of Albert Levy, dispersed at Christies in March 1876. He took over Flatou's Gallery at 11 Haymarket in 1877, renaming it the Guardi Gallery and remaining there until 1888, when he acquired the galleries of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours at 53 Pall Mall, which he named the Marlborough Gallery. He began buying at auction on a substantial scale from 1875, purchasing Frans van Mieris's 'Enamoured Cavalier' for 4100 guineas ($4305), and from the Lucy sale a Jan Both classical subject for 4500 guineas ($4725). He negotiated several major private purchases, notably the Raphael altarpiece 'Madonna and Child with Saints' (Metropolitan Museum, New York) from the Colonna collection, which he bought from the earl of Ashburnham for $17,000 in June 1896. After unsuccessfully offering it to the National Gallery for $40,000, he sold it to C. Sedelmeyer of Paris, who sold it to J. Pierpont Morgan for $80,000. 
Martin Henry claimed that his wide connoisseurship -- his 'eye' -- was gained, not from academic study, but by practical experience and careful examination of the works of art themselves. He outlived all his brothers and sisters, and was thrice married: first to Sarah Nash, second to Elizabeth Maxwell Howard (died 1888), and third, on 17 October 1889, to Amy Mary, daughter of George Smith, the artist; he left no children. He died at the Marlborough Gallery on 27 June 1908, and after a funeral service at St James's, Piccadilly, on 1 July, was buried in the family grave at Highgate. 
Martin Henry Colnaghi bequeathed four paintings to the National Gallery: Lorenzo Lotto's 'Madonna and Child and Saints', Philips Wouwermans's 'The Gypsies', Aert van der Neer's 'Dawn', and a small landscape by Thomas Gainsborough, 'The Bridge' ('c'.1783). He left the residue of his estate (some $90,532) to his wife, and stipulated that $80,000 should go to the National Gallery, after her death, for the purchase of pictures, these to form the Martin Colnaghi bequest. Colnaghi's picture stock was sold in six groups from 22 October 1908 to 7 January 1909 at Robinson Fisher & Co., realizing some $15,000. 
The firm of Colnaghi continued to flourish after the family's direct links with it ended. In 1911 Otto Gutekunst was joined by Gustavus Mayer (and later by his daughter Katharina), after which the firm moved to sumptuous premises, designed by Lanchester and Rickards, at 144-6 New Bond Street, vacating them in 1940, eventually to settle at 14 Old Bond Street. James Byam Shaw, who had joined in 1934, became a director three years later; after the war Byam Shaw, himself an outstanding scholar, established close links with the museum world, especially the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum. While their collections benefited greatly from his expertise, Colnaghis gained pre-eminence as dealers in fine prints and drawings. In January 2002 P. and D. Colnaghi & Co. was acquired by Konrad O. Bernheimer and trades now as Bernheimer and Colnaghi.

Colomb, Philip Howard (1831-1899), naval officer, was born in Scotland on 29 May 1831, the third son of Lieutenant-General George Thomas Colomb (1788-1874), colonel of the 97th regiment, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Abraham Bradley King, first baronet, of Corrard, co. Fermanagh, twice lord mayor of Dublin. He was the elder brother of Sir John Charles Ready Colomb (1838-1909). Educated privately, he entered the navy in February 1846 on board the 'Tartarus' on the Irish station, and from November 1846 to March 1849 was in the steam frigate 'Sidon' in the Mediterranean. He was then appointed to the 'Reynard' on the China station, and remained on the station as a supernumerary in various ships, until in September he was appointed to the 16-gun brig-sloop 'Serpent' in which, from November until May 1852, he was engaged in the Second Anglo-Burmese War and was present at the capture of Rangoon. He passed his examination in seamanship in May 1852, and continued in the 'Serpent' as acting mate and acting lieutenant until she was paid off in January 1854. In March he joined the screw-sloop 'Phoenix' for a voyage to Smith Sound under the command of Captain (afterwards Admiral) Sir Edward Augustus Inglefield. On his return to England in October he was appointed to the guardship 'Ajax' and on 3 February 1855 was promoted lieutenant of the 'Hastings', going up the Baltic under James Crawford Caffin. In May 1856 he was appointed to the 'Excellent' for the gunnery course and, having passed out in November 1857, was in December appointed flag-lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Sabine Pasley, then admiral superintendent at Devonport, and later to Pasley's successor, Thomas Matthew Charles Symonds. In 1857 Colomb married Eleanor Bourne, daughter of Captain Hook, 34th regiment; they had two daughters and six sons, of whom five entered the public service. 
Colomb in 1858 was ordered by the Admiralty to examine and report on a system of day signals which they had bought. On his showing its unsuitability for sea service, he was asked to improve night signals, then still made in the seventeenth-century manner. Colomb had already studied this problem, without success; he resumed his experiments, and after many months' work devised a system long used in the navy, known as Colomb's flashing signals, using Morse code with long and short flashes from a lamp by night, or blasts from the foghorn or steam whistle in fog. Their novelty has been disputed, and possibly the method had been more or less vaguely suggested before. After opposition, unfavourable reports, and much testing, it was adopted first by the Channel Fleet, under Sidney Colpoys Dacres, before being fully adopted in the navy in February 1867. 
On 12 December 1863 Colomb was promoted commander, but continued attached nominally to the 'Edgar' or the 'Victory', to perfect his signalling system. In 1867 he was seconded to the Royal Engineers, to improve military signalling. 
In July 1868 Colomb commissioned the wooden steam sloop 'Dryad', part of the British naval force which patrolled the Indian Ocean, capturing Arab slave dhows sailing from east Africa to Arabia. Colomb's 'Dryad' captured seven slavers with 365 Africans on board. From his experiences Colomb wrote 'Slave Catching in the Indian Ocean' (1873), a useful historical source and an expression of his opinions: he considered the Australian Aborigines the lowest race he ever saw and that, unlike Africans, they could not be improved by civilization. On 4 April 1870 he was advanced to post rank, and for approaching four years worked at the Admiralty preparing the 'Manual of Fleet Evolutions', officially issued in 1874. From 1874 to 1877 he commanded the battleship 'Audacious' on the China station, as flag-captain to Vice-Admiral Alfred Phillipps Ryder; in 1880 he commanded the turret-ship 'Thunderer' in the Mediterranean, and from 1881 to 1884 was captain of the steam reserve at Portsmouth, from which in September 1884 he was appointed to the shore establishment as flag-captain to Sir Geoffrey Thomas Phipps Hornby. On 20 May 1886 he was retired owing to age, still nearly a year from the top of the captains' list. In 1886 he published 'Fifteen Years of Naval Retirement', criticizing the 1870 naval officer retirement scheme and opposing compulsory retirement. He became rear-admiral on 6 April 1887 and vice-admiral on 1 August 1892 but received no official honours. From 1887, succeeding his friend John Knox Laughton, he lectured on naval strategy and tactics at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He resided at Botley, Hampshire. 
The coming of steam and a perceived 'scientific age' had led many naval officers to reject as irrelevant the lessons of sailing warfare. Initially the work of neither Colomb nor his brother John was historically informed, but from the later 1880s, influenced by Laughton, Colomb developed the historical side of his work, and in turn influenced Laughton. He was also influenced by his brother, with whose ideas he agreed and on whose foundations he built. He acknowledged John's primacy on imperial defence, writing that John had 'the leading part in laying down and continually differentiating the governing principles of Imperial Defence' and claimed John's 1867 pamphlet 'The Protection of our Commerce and Distribution of our Naval Forces Considered' gave 'the key-note to all subsequent discussions' (Colomb, 'Essays', 1). 
In his retirement Colomb devoted himself to the study of naval history as a key to the problems of naval policy and strategy. Like Laughton and Alfred Thayer Mahan, he argued the continuities of sailing and steam warfare and the validity of lessons drawn from sailing warfare, notably on command of the sea, blockade, and defence against invasion. He asserted in 1887, 'it is impossible to form correct views of the present or future of naval warfare unless they are based on a pretty thorough investigation of its history in the past' (Colomb, 'Essays', 197). The science of naval evolutions he had, theoretically, a complete mastery of, though fate prevented him from combining practice with his theory, and his views did not always meet, among naval men, with that ready acceptance many believed they were entitled to. Fisher and others criticized him as a 'theoretical' admiral. Laughton claimed in 1893 that some of the opposition to Colomb's theories reflected the 'imperfection' of his language. An untiring correspondent of 'The Times', Colomb had an opinion to express on many contemporary naval issues: for example, he condemned very heavy guns but advocated convoys. He was 'an ardent advocate for strengthening the Navy' ('Annual Register', 171). He wrote voluminously and was generally known as 'Column and a Half'. At the meetings at the Royal United Service Institution (RUSI) he was a regular attender, a frequent speaker, and contributed several important papers, some of which were published in 'Essays on Naval Defence' (1893). He claimed that the essays merited republication because up to then no single book existed on the whole subject of naval defence 'where the great principles of strategy and tactics are placed side by side with the material and personal conditions which either govern or are governed by them' (Colomb, 'Essays', iii). His major work was 'Naval Warfare: its Ruling Principles and Practice Historically Treated' (1891; 2nd edn, 1893; 3rd edn, 1899), whose great merit was somewhat obscured by its length. This work attempted to make history a determining guide for the analysis of naval problems of that age. Contemporaneous with Mahan's classic 'Influence of Sea Power upon History' (1890) -- which overshadowed Colomb's work, and which he generously praised -- Colomb's 'Naval Warfare' attempted a scientific explanation of how history shaped international politics and British imperial defence. 
In Britain Colomb was the precursor of other naval historian-strategists, notably Sir Julian Corbett, and later, Soviet naval theory embraced Colomb for a time. In contrast to Mahan's historical survey, Colomb's work followed a logical structure, working up from securing command of the sea to power projection operations. It was a more accurate reflection of British thinking, particularly in its emphasis on the offensive: for this reason Russian naval thinkers took his work to heart. Its most valuable contribution to naval thought was the concept of a fleet-in-being, which he developed from Herbert's rationalization of his defeat at Beachy Head in 1690. Colomb was a major intellectual influence on the late Victorian navy. His 'Memoir of Sir Astley Cooper Key' (1898) as a biography was among the best of its kind and era. An advocate of the ascendant 'blue water' school, Colomb argued an extreme navalist case in the controversy over the relative roles of warships and fortifications, notably in his 1889 RUSI paper, 'The relations between local fortifications and a moving navy'. 
During his last years Colomb worked at a memoir of Arthur Herbert, earl of Torrington, whose character and conduct of the battle of Beachy Head (30 June 1690) he considered misrepresented by popular historians. He published numerous pamphlets on naval matters. With J. F. Maurice, Archibald Forbes, and others, he wrote the future war fiction 'The Great War of 189- ', published serially in 'Black and White' (1892), then in book form (1893). He was one of the founders of the Navy Records Society (1893). A war games enthusiast, he wrote the influential 'The Duel: a Naval War Game' (1879), used by the United States navy in the 1880s. 
Colomb died at his home, Steeple Court, Botley, Hampshire, suddenly from an affection of the heart, on 13 October 1899. He was survived by his wife.

Colomies, Paul (1638-1692), writer and librarian, was born on 2 December 1638 at La Rochelle, France, the son of Jean Colomies, a doctor at La Rochelle. His family came from Bearn, but his grandfather Jerome was a minister of the Reformed church at La Rochelle. Colomies was sent to the academy of Saumur at the age of sixteen and was there taught Hebrew by Louis Cappel. He went to Paris in 1664, and became acquainted with Isaac Vossius, who took him to Holland. Colomies's first and most useful work, 'Gallia Orientalis', an account of the lives and writings of French scholars in Hebrew and other oriental languages, was published at The Hague in 1665. He intended to follow this with accounts of such scholars from other nations, but only 'Italia et Hispania orientalis' was sufficiently advanced for publication, long after Colomies's death, at Hamburg in 1730. The rest of his output was prolific, and included 'Rome protestante' (1677), an apology for the reformed faith, and 'Theologorum presbyterianorum icon' (1682), in which his movement towards an episcopalian standpoint became clear. 
Colomies remained at La Rochelle until 1681, but then moved to England, perhaps to visit Vossius, who had been there since 1670 and had become a canon of Windsor. Vossius's influence may have lain behind an introduction to Archbishop William Sancroft; Colomies was librarian at Lambeth Palace by 1684. As librarian he compiled a manuscript 'Catalogus librorum bibliothecae Lambethanae a Paulo Colomesio Ecclesiae Anglicanae presbytero et bibliothecae curatore'. It is a list in shelf order of the more than 9000 books in the library. It also bears extensive corrections by Sancroft himself. He was thus, evidently, in Anglican orders, and became ''Lecteur'' in the new church established by Peter Allix in Jewin Street, Aldersgate, in 1686. He was licensed as a deacon by 9 October 1687. Some dissatisfaction with his advancement in the church (expressed in a letter to William Cave, Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 30, fol. 140) was remedied by his collation by the archbishop to the rectory of Eynesford in Kent on 15 November 1687. As Sancroft's librarian, he also compiled a catalogue of Isaac Vossius's manuscripts. This was published in the 'Catalogus manuscriptorum Angliae et Hiberniae' (1697) -- though Vossius's manuscripts were in fact sold to Leiden. Colomies was naturalized in March 1688 (W. A. Shaw, ed. 'Letters of Denization and Acts of Naturalization for Aliens in England and Ireland, 1603-1700', 1911, 204). 
With Archbishop Sancroft's deprivation as a nonjuror in 1690, Colomies's appointment as Lambeth librarian came to an end. He had been ill for some time at the time of his death in London in January 1692. He made a will on 2 January 1692; it was proved on 8 January. The principal legatee was his cousin Peter Hamelot. The will does not mention the considerable library of books and papers which Colomies must have owned. The bookseller Paul Vaillant was one of the witnesses to the will, and there is a possibility that the books were dispersed abroad, though some annotated volumes survive in the British Library. Paul Colomies was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields. 
Colomies's books, beyond those already mentioned, consisted largely of collections of annotations on topics humanistic and patristic. Pierre Bayle's judgement was that he was able to profit from his extensive reading and to draw attention to many matters of interest (Bayle, 904-6). This view is supported by the posthumous reprinting of his works in London, Paris, and Amsterdam, and in particular by the (partial) collection of his 'Opera theologici, critici et historici argumenti', edited by J. A. Fabricius (1709).

Colonia, Adam Isaacszoon de (1634-1685), painter, was born in Rotterdam on 12 August 1634, the son of the painter Isaac Adamszoon de Colonia (1611-1663) and Machtelt Becx. De Colonia probably trained under his father, as well as his grandfather Adam Louiszoon de Colonia (1574-1651), also a painter. In his early career de Colonia was influenced by the importation of fully fledged Italianate styles into Utrecht, and possibly also by Dutch Italianate models such as Nicolaes Berchem (1620-1683). 
De Colonia married Cornelia, daughter of Arendt Kerckhoven, in Rotterdam on 28 December 1661, and they had four children. He is recorded in Rotterdam in 1669. Some time after this they moved to London, and are listed as members of the Dutch Reformed church at Austin Friars in 1674. In Britain, de Colonia continued to produce the village genre scenes and biblical and Italianate landscapes, with lively figures, that had characterized his work in Rotterdam. He often painted night scenes, and pastoral images, following the development of these themes by Francesco Bassano (1549-1592) in Venice. De Colonia reportedly copied the Bassano paintings -- presumably those by Jacopo -- in the Royal Collection, and maintained a steady reputation in Britain throughout his career, with his imitations 'esteemed his best performances' (Buckeridge, 407). He occasionally etched. De Colonia was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 10 September 1685, after which his reputation lessened. Examples of his work are in museums in Holland; Lille, France; and Copenhagen, Denmark.

Coloribus, John de (fl. 1502-1555), Dominican friar, was Walloon in origin. He first appears as a member of the Dominican convent at Lille in 1502, when he was sent to study philosophy at Paris. In the nine years following he was recorded at a number of other houses in the Low Countries and northern France, and at the end of 1509 was appointed by the master-general to lecture at Lille on the 'Sentences'. By 1511, however, he had left the continent under a cloud: he and a colleague had fled the Paris convent with a 'noteworthy' theft and were consequently condemned to severe punishment and imprisonment wherever they should be found. Instead he came to Oxford, where he preached the university sermon on Ash Wednesday 1511 and successfully supplicated for the degree of BTh on 15 October following, describing himself as having studied logic, philosophy, and theology for sixteen years. On 10 May 1516 he supplicated for the degree of DTh, and was dispensed on 11 November 1522. In 1521 he was one of the theologians reported by the university as available to support the king in attacking Luther; like the others he had already written unpublished 'opuscula' in this cause. In 1525, according to Wood, he was one of the fellows of Wolsey's Cardinal College. 
John de Coloribus remained a Dominican, and it was as such that he received letters of denization on 17 March 1527. By 1531 he had left Oxford and moved to Cornwall, where he entered the employment of the Arundell family of Lanherne. During that year his services were required by the bishop of Lincoln, perhaps in connection with Henry VIII's divorce, but he preferred to be in the south-west, and begged Sir Thomas Arundell to speak up for him, 'that I may obtain some good provision to return to Cornwall' ('LP Henry VIII', 5, no. 214). He duly returned to Cornwall, and as a friar of Truro undertook preaching for the canons of Bodmin Priory, who in 1537 granted him an annuity of $4 for life. He retained his right to this following the successive dissolutions of the Truro friary on 22 September 1538 and of Bodmin Priory on 27 February 1539. On 3 December 1538 he was among the former Dominicans dispensed to hold a benefice, but it seems unlikely that he obtained one. He remained in Cornwall, however, and perhaps returned to the Arundell household, since it was Sir Thomas who about 1543 persuaded de Coloribus to have his pension ratified by the court of augmentations. The result, according to a petition which de Coloribus presented to the chancellor about 1548, was that it was stolen from him by George Rolle of Stevenstone, a Devon landowner who speculated profitably in former monastic property and had the additional advantage of government office, as keeper of the records of the court of common pleas. Nevertheless, although de Coloribus described himself as 'a very poore man, sykly, impotente, bare in substans' (TNA: PRO, C 1/1207, no. 33) he was able to recover his pension, and was still receiving it in 1555. It is not known where or when he died.

Colpoys, Sir John (c.1742-1821), naval officer, details of whose parents and upbringing are unknown, possibly entered the navy in 1756 at the beginning of the Seven Years' War. Colpoys served at the capture of Louisbourg in 1758 and Martinique in 1762 and was promoted lieutenant in October 1762. In 1770 he was sent to the East Indies in the sloop 'Lynx' where he was promoted commander. Raised to post captain in August 1773, he was given command of the 'Northumberland' (70 guns). Between 1776 and 1778 he commanded the frigate 'Seaford' and then in 1779 he became flag captain to Admiral Sir John Lockhart Ross on the 'Royal George'. In the same year Colpoys sat as a member of the court martial on Vice-Admiral Sir Hugh Palliser, who was tried after the acquittal of Admiral Augustus Keppel for an indecisive action against the French fleet off Ushant in July 1778. Palliser, a supporter of the tory government and a lord of the Admiralty, was acquitted. Subsequently Colpoys was given command of the frigate 'Orpheus' and sent to the North American station where, in 1781, in company with the 'Roebuck', he captured the American ship 'Confederacy', which was carrying stores for Washington's army. Colpoys commanded the frigate 'Phaeton' in the Mediterranean for a short time in 1783 but was then not employed again until 1790, when he was given the 'Hannibal', guardship at Portsmouth. 
In 1793, upon the outbreak of war with France, Colpoys was sent with a squadron to guard the Channel Islands and subsequently to the West Indies with Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner's squadron. He was raised to the rank of rear-admiral in April 1794 and, with his flag in the 'London' (98 guns), was present in Lord Bridport's action off Lorient in July 1795. On 11 December 1796 a division of the French fleet evaded Colpoys's blockading squadron off Ushant and joined Admiral Richery's fleet in the port of Brest. On 16 December Captain Sir Edward Pellew, commanding the inshore frigate squadron, realized that the French fleet was putting to sea and sent a lugger to warn Colpoys. Colpoys's squadron, however, had either been blown off station or had withdrawn into the channel and it was left to Pellew in the frigate 'Indefatigable' to harass the French fleet until he lost sight of it. Colpoys and his squadron returned to Plymouth while the French sailed in an abortive attempt to land an army on the coast of Ireland at Bantry Bay. 
In April 1797 the first major mutiny broke out among the Channel Fleet at Spithead. Although the seamen's grievances were partly settled, the crews of four ships maintained their strike, and these were left at Spithead under the command of Colpoys in the 'London', while the remainder of the fleet moored at St Helens, off the Isle of Wight. On 1 May the Admiralty issued a general order instructing the officers in its ships vigorously to suppress any attempted mutiny and bring ringleaders to punishment. The order was met with dismay and was concealed by many officers in the Channel Fleet in an effort to keep it from the seamen. By 7 May, however, news of the order was out and the fleet at St Helens mutinied again. Colpoys, at Spithead, apparently realizing that a new mutiny had broken out, summoned his crew on deck and asked them if they had any remaining grievances. The crew said they had none and Colpoys ordered them below deck. In an attempt to prevent any communication between the crew and the mutineers' delegates, Colpoys tried to seal the ship by closing the gunports and confining the men below. 
The crew of the 'London' now held a meeting and demanded to be allowed on deck. When this was refused they attempted to force their way up, and Colpoys ordered the ship's officers and marines to open fire on them. Most of the marines dropped their weapons, but several seamen were mortally wounded before Colpoys ordered the officers to cease firing. Lieutenant Peter Bover, who had been responsible for wounding one of the seamen, was immediately seized and threatened with hanging. Colpoys intervened quickly by claiming responsibility for the actions of his officers, and both Bover and Colpoys, together with the ship's captain, Edward Griffith, were confined in their cabins. The crew of the 'London' next moved the ship to St Helens, to join the other ships under mutiny. Once there they considered holding a trial for both Colpoys and Captain Griffith. However, three days later they sent the officers on shore. 
Shortly afterwards the mutineers included Colpoys's name among the list of those they wanted removed from their commands, but in fact Colpoys had already asked to be relieved. On 14 May he was ordered to strike his flag, an order which reflected expediency rather than any form of reprimand. In 1798 he was made a knight of the Bath. 
In January 1801 he was advanced to the rank of admiral of the Blue squadron, but he remained without employment until June 1803 when he was appointed commander-in-chief at Plymouth. In May 1804, apparently at the request of Lord Melville, first lord of the Admiralty, Colpoys gave up his command in order to take a seat at the Admiralty. It is possible that, shortly after, he was considered for the position of commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean but this came to nothing and in 1805 he was appointed treasurer of Greenwich Hospital. In January 1815 he was awarded the grand cross of the Bath and on 27 January 1816, following the death of Lord Hood, he became the governor of Greenwich Hospital, where he died, aged about seventy-nine, on 4 April 1821. It is possible that he was buried in the mausoleum at Greenwich.

Colquhoun, Archibald Campbell- (c.1754-1820), lawyer and politician, was the only son of John Campbell (formerly Coates), a merchant of Clathick, Perthshire, and provost of Glasgow, and his wife, Agnes, the only child of Laurence Colquhoun of Killermont, Dunbartonshire. On succeeding to the estate of Killermont upon the death of his father in 1804 he assumed the additional surname and arms of Colquhoun. He was educated at Glasgow University and admitted an advocate in 1779. In 1796 he married Mary Ann, daughter of the Revd William Erskine, Episcopalian minister at Muthill, Perthshire, and sister of William Erskine (1769-1822). They had six daughters and two sons -- John Campbell-Colquhoun (1803-1870), a writer, and William Laurence Campbell-Colquhoun, who died on 16 January 1861. Their eldest child died within a year of her birth, prompting Carolina Oliphant, afterwards Lady Nairne, to write 'The Land of the Leal', which she sent to her old friend Mrs Colquhoun. Colquhoun himself was a good classical scholar, a sound lawyer, and an eloquent pleader. However, being wealthy and reserved, he did not seek to obtain a large practice. 
On the downfall of the 'ministry of all the talents' Colquhoun was appointed lord advocate, on 28 March 1807. At this time most Scottish patronage was in the hands of the Dundas family, and William Erskine, Alexander Maconochie, and Henry Cockburn were actually chosen deputes by Lord Melville before Colquhoun had received the appointment. In May 1807 Colquhoun was elected MP for the Elgin district of burghs, but after three years he resigned his seat, in pursuit of a safer one. In July 1810 he was returned unopposed as member for Dunbartonshire, with the support of the duke of Montrose, and he held this seat securely until his death in 1820. In parliament he defended Lord Eldon's bill for the reform of the Scottish judicature. As the lord advocate he took part in reforming the constitution of the court of session, and he was appointed one of the thirteen commissioners who sat for the first time on 30 November 1808 for the purpose of inquiring into the administration of justice in Scotland. The correspondence between Colquhoun and Henry Erskine, the late lord advocate, on the subject of the respective merits of Lord Grenville's and Lord Eldon's bills for the reform of legal procedure was published in the 1808 edition of the 'Scots Magazine'. Colquhoun was antagonized by the failure of the ministry to appoint him lord president in 1811, but he was made lord clerk register on 4 July 1816. Erskine's friends were much disappointed by the latter event; they had hoped that the post would have been offered to him. Other than in Scottish affairs Colquhoun was not a successful parliamentary speaker. He was shouted down in March 1809 when he attempted to defend the duke of York. He voted against Catholic relief in 1813. 
Colquhoun was sheriff of Perth from 1793 to 1807 and rector of Glasgow University from 1807 to 1809. He died on 8 December 1820, after a short illness, at the house of his son-in-law, Walter Long, at Hartham, Wiltshire, and was buried in the parish churchyard of New Kilpatrick, near Glasgow. His wife survived him for many years, and died at Rothesay on 15 May 1833.

Colquhoun, Janet, Lady Colquhoun (1781-1846), religious writer, was the second daughter of Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, first baronet (1754-1835), and his first wife, Sarah (died 1785), the only child and heir of Alexander Maitland of Stoke Newington. She was born in London on 17 April 1781, but, together with her elder sister Hannah, passed her childhood at Thurso Castle with their grandmother Lady Janet Sinclair, daughter of William Sutherland, Lord Strathnaver. This lady took the sisters to live in the Canongate of Edinburgh, before they went to complete their education at a school at Stoke Newington. The younger of the two was about fifteen when they returned to be introduced into Edinburgh society. 
On 11 June 1799 Janet Sinclair married Major James Colquhoun (1774-1836), eldest son of Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, second baronet, on whose death, in 1805, her husband succeeded to the title, and Rossdhu, on Loch Lomond, became her home. In this year Lady Colquhoun began to keep a diary, which she continued for forty years. She was the mother of five children, three sons, including John Colquhoun, and two daughters, whom she helped to educate. She visited the poor and sick among her tenants. In 1818 she turned her attention to female education and established a school of industry for girls, near Rossdhu; Lady Colquhoun taught at the Sunday school attached to this institution. She took a keen interest in other philanthropic and religious schemes, especially in the Luss and Arrochar Bible Society. 
In 1820 Lady Colquhoun's health declined, and she was prevented from taking any active share in philanthropic schemes. She then devoted herself to the composition of religious works, the first of which was published anonymously in 1822 under the title of 'Despair and Hope'. This was followed by 'Thoughts on the Religious Profession' (1823), 'Impressions of the Heart' (1825), 'The Kingdom of God' (1836), and 'The World's Religion' (1839). She allegedly converted her husband to evangelicalism; it was not until after his death, on 3 February 1836, that her name was appended to her books. James Hamilton remarked that her works were: 'like the conversation of their compiler,... genuine and inartificial, spontaneous and heartfelt'. At the time of the Disruption of the established church in 1843, she took great interest in religious politics, throwing herself heart and soul into the Free Church cause. She died at Helensburgh on 21 October 1846, and was buried on the 27th of that month at Luss.

He was originally a shepherd and weaver but, after attending a village school, he studied at Glasgow for the Scottish ministry. He was licensed in August 1780 and took up a charge in South Leith in March 1781. He was married; his wife's name was Euphemia. A supporter of the SPCK and the Edinburgh Continental Society, his publications include 'A Treatise on Spiritual Comfort' (1831) and two treatises on the covenant of grace and of works.

Colquhoun, John (1805-1885), writer on sport, second son of Sir James Colquhoun, third baronet (1774-1836), of Luss and Janet, 'nee' Sinclair (1781-1846) ['see 'Colquhoun, Janet], the religious author, was born in Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, on 6 March 1805. Together with his elder brother he was educated first at Edinburgh high school, subsequently at a private school in Lincolnshire run by the Revd Grainger of Winteringham, and finally at the University of Edinburgh. An ensign in the 33rd regiment from 1826, in 1828 he was in the wilds of Connaught as a lieutenant; there he had plenty of hard work and a full share of adventures in the way of protecting the excise, or 'still-hunting', as it was called. In 1829 he was gazetted into the 4th dragoon guards but sold out the following year. 
On 29 January 1834 Colquhoun married Frances Sarah (1813-1877), fourth daughter of Ebenezer Fuller Maitland of Park Place, Henley-on-Thames; they had four sons and five daughters, among them Lucy Bethia Walford. Frances herself, when fourteen years old, contributed to the 'Hymns for Private Devotion, Selected and Original' (1827), a completion by her mother, Bertha Fuller Maitland, of Henry Kirke White's fragment beginning 'Much in sorrow, oft in woe', and this completion was widely accepted for church use. A small volume of her poems was published in 1876 under the title 'Rhymes and Chimes'. 
Colquhoun was always a keen sportsman and an accurate observer of nature; but in his sympathy for the Scottish highlands' wilder days and for the preservation of endangered fauna, he confessed to 'having sunk the sportsman in the 'amateur naturalist'' (Colquhoun, 'The Moor and the Loch', preface to 3rd edn, 1851). During his life he visited nearly every district of Scotland, so that his opportunities for observation were especially favourable. In 1840 he embodied his experiences in 'The Moor and the Loch', which speedily took a high rank among books on Scottish sport. The fourth edition (1878) contained many additions, notably the most valuable portions of some other books written in the meantime: 'Rocks and Rivers' (1849); 'Salmon Casts and Stray Shots' (1858); and 'Sporting Days' (1866). The fifth edition (1880) added an autobiographical preface; two more editions followed by 1888. Besides these works Colquhoun wrote two lectures, 'On the ferae naturae of the British islands' (deploring the extinction of Scottish species due to 'improvement'), and 'On instinct and reason', which were published in 1873 and 1874 respectively. Colquhoun died on 27 May 1885 at his home, 1 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh, after a short illness.

Colquhoun, John Campbell (1785-1854), writer on animal magnetism, was the third of five sons (there were four daughters) of Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, second baronet (1741-1805), sheriff of Dumbarton and principal clerk of session, and his wife, Mary, daughter of James Falconer. He was born at Edinburgh on 31 January 1785 and was educated mainly at home. In 1804-5 he attended law classes at Edinburgh University. He then studied Roman law at the University of Gottingen, where he acquired a lasting interest in German literature and philosophy. He was called to the Scottish bar in 1806, and in 1815 was appointed sheriff-depute of Dunbartonshire, a post which he held until a few months before his death. An obituary in the 'Dumbarton Herald' spoke of his 'accurate discrimination, and strict and undeviating impartiality'. 
Colquhoun's life, however, centred round Edinburgh, where he lived with his sister, Helen, at 10 Melville Street; he never married. His legal duties seem to have left him ample leisure for his literary and philosophical pursuits, and by 1820 he was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (he resigned about twenty years later). His particular interest was in animal magnetism (mesmerism), which, though little known in Britain, had been a topic of keen debate in Germany during his student days. Subsequently a medical friend, who wished him to take it up, from time to time sent him the latest French and German publications. After some experimentation and a great deal of reading, Colquhoun undertook a translation, published in 1833, of a report on the subject recently presented to the French Royal Academy of Medicine. To this he added a long introduction. In 1836 he expanded his introduction into a two-volume treatise, 'Isis revelata', which displayed a knowledge unparalleled in Britain both of the continental mesmeric literature, and of relevant classical and medical texts. He regarded mesmeric 'somnambulism' as closely analogous to ordinary somnambulism. Colquhoun was particularly interested in cases of apparent clairvoyance, which he accepted somewhat uncritically and held to refute materialism. 
The publication of 'Isis' shortly preceded an upsurge of British interest in animal magnetism and Colquhoun was soon recognized as a leading authority. An enlarged second edition of 'Isis' came out in 1844. Meanwhile he continued to pursue the subject. He vainly attempted to rouse medical interest, and in 1839 started a short-lived 'Journal of Zoomagnetism'; in 1843 he wrote a pamphlet attacking 'phrenomesmerism'; in 1845 he published a translation from the German of Arnold Wienholt's lectures on somnambulism, adding a long introduction discussing somnambulic clairvoyance; he had various controversies with James Braid, the pioneer of hypnotism, who disbelieved in a physical animal magnetism, and in 1851 he brought out a 'History of Magic, Witchcraft and Animal Magnetism', which treated the subject along lines foreshadowed in 'Isis revelata'. 
Though a man of great courtesy, Colquhoun was modest and rather reserved. But within his own intimate circle (which included Sir William Hamilton, the philosopher) he was regarded as an agreeable companion and a steady friend. He died at 10 Melville Street, in Edinburgh, on 21 August 1854 and was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh.

Colquhoun, John Campbell (1803-1870), politician and writer, was born at Killermont, Dunbartonshire, on 23 January 1803, the elder son of Archibald Campbell-Colquhoun (c.1754-1820), lord clerk register, and his wife, Mary Anne (died 1833), daughter of William Erskine, Episcopalian minister of Muthill. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and Oriel College, Oxford, where he matriculated in March 1820 and took his BA, with first-class honours, in 1823. On the death of his father in 1820 he inherited Killermont, and in 1821 he also inherited estates at Garscadden from his kinswoman Jean Colquhoun. On 10 September 1827 he married Henrietta Maria Powys (1799-1870), eldest daughter of Thomas Powys, second Baron Lilford. She was to be a strong influence on him, particularly in reinforcing his evangelical inclinations. They had two sons. 
Colquhoun began his political career as an advocate of moderate reform. He was first returned to parliament in 1832, representing Dunbartonshire and sitting as a radical. Over the next few years, however, his evangelical convictions led him to join the growing rally in defence of the established churches and hence to change his political loyalties. Between 1834 and 1836 he played a major part in extra-parliamentary agitation in defence of the Church of Ireland, and subsequently campaigned in favour of the maintenance of church rates in England. He did not contest the 1835 general election, but in 1837 was returned for the Kilmarnock burghs, as a tory. 
In the late 1830s Colquhoun was admitted to the inner counsels of the Conservative Party, where his staunch protestantism was found consistent with the mood of the moment. At the same time Thomas Chalmers saw him as the potential leader of 'a religious party in Parliament' (Colquhoun MSS, bundle 85, 26 June 1841). Although himself an Episcopalian, Colquhoun supported the causes of evangelicalism and non-intrusion in the Church of Scotland. In the 1841 general election campaign, however, he refused demands to make his support for Peel conditional on the latter agreeing to further the cause of the church's independence. He accordingly lost his seat and, subsequently, desiring above all to see the Church of Scotland strong and united, he was to regard the Disruption in 1843 as a calamity. Thereafter he distanced himself from his Scottish roots. 
Although Colquhoun was shortly to be back in the Commons, returned for Newcastle under Lyme at a by-election in 1842, Peel failed to reward his loyalty and left him on the back benches at a juncture when his views were becoming politically less convenient. In 1845 the Maynooth question was the spark which ignited Colquhoun's feelings of personal betrayal and outraged principle. He moved to open revolt against the prime minister, not only opposing him in the house, but also publishing pamphlets denouncing the government's record. In addition he organized the National Club as a rallying point for those who sought a stronger protestant and Anglican basis for politics. Nevertheless, despite his evident ambition, he lacked a sufficiently credible and broad basis of support to become a major player in the post-Peel Conservative Party. 
In 1847 Colquhoun, suffering from failing health and political disappointment, decided to take 'refuge in religious politics' and rule 'supreme in Exeter Hall' (Disraeli MSS, A/X/A/13). He retired from parliament and over the next two decades took a prominent role in the National Club and in other Anglican societies committed to the maintenance of protestant interests, notably the Irish Church Missions and, in the 1860s, the Church Association. He also developed his literary and historical interests. As well as several pamphlets on contemporary political and religious questions, he published a historical volume on France and Italy, and a number of biographical works. 
Colquhoun was devastated by his wife's death in January 1870, and himself died at home at 8 Chesham Street, London, on 17 April 1870. He was buried at Crockham church, Kent. In his youth he had seemed to be a man with outstanding prospects, but he eventually showed himself lacking in the toughness and breadth of outlook requisite for a successful secular politician. His most significant role was as a key lay leader of Anglican evangelicalism in the generation after the death of William Wilberforce.

Colquhoun, Patrick (1745-1820), magistrate and a founder of the Thames police, and his twin, Ann, were born on 14 March 1745 in Dumbarton. Their parents, Adam Colquhoun (1711- 'c'.1755), sheriff-substitute and keeper of the register of sasines for Dunbartonshire, and Isabell, 'nee' Colquhoun, had at least three other children: David ('b'. 1743), Mary ('b'. 1748), and Adam ('b'. 1753). Colquhoun attended Dumbarton grammar school before travelling to Virginia, aged fifteen, to learn the tobacco trade. He returned to Scotland in 1766 and, despite his youth, became a leading Glasgow merchant. He married Janet (died 1810), daughter of James Colquhoun (bailie, later provost of Dumbarton), on 22 July 1775. Six of their seven children were born in Glasgow: Frances (1776); Isabella (1777); James and Adam (1780); Janet Jane (1782); Margaret (1787). A further child, Anne Agnes, was born between Janet Jane and Margaret, but died in infancy. The family lived in Argyle Street, Glasgow. In 1782, in a somewhat ostentatious display of wealth, Colquhoun built Kelvingrove House (possibly using James Adam as architect) for use as his country residence. 
Colquhoun was a prominent and energetic member of Glasgow society. He held a number of offices in the city, served as lord provost from February 1782 to October 1784, and was a founding member and first chairman of Glasgow chamber of commerce. He was active in identifying and encouraging new commercial opportunities to help the city survive the economic dislocation of the American War of Independence. Colquhoun visited London several times to lobby on behalf of the city's businessmen. By 1785 he was acting for British cotton manufacturers in general. Although he found lobbying tedious, writing contemptuously of 'the supineness of the landed interest' and of the disagreeableness of having to deal with men unable to see beyond party politics, he was proud of his achievements, among which he included the creation of a Commons standing committee on trade (Glasgow chamber of commerce MSS, Colquhoun, 9, 14, 21 June 1783; 4, 5, 21 May 1785). Ironically, by 1788 it had become clear that his own business was unable to adapt to new trading conditions. He moved to London intending to create a specialized commercial information and lobbying service (Glasgow chamber of commerce MSS, 'Plan of a public agency in London for commercial affairs', October 1788) and with ambitions to become consul-general to the USA. 
In 1792 Colquhoun was appointed, through the influence of Henry Dundas (later Viscount Melville), as a stipendiary magistrate at Worship Street police office, Shoreditch, in London. Anxious to prove his worth, he prepared an analysis of metropolitan crime and ways to prevent it. The basis of his preventive scheme was to introduce an extensive system of regulation of all those aspects of lower-class life that he deemed likely to lead to crime. This was a system of police in the eighteenth-century sense of the term: a series of regulations and regulatory agencies for the supervision of the manners, morals, and health of society rather than a body of officers in the way that the term would now be understood. 
To Colquhoun, as to so many of his contemporaries, the liquidation of the national debt was a major priority; accordingly his scheme of police was an elaborate one designed not only to regulate social ills and to prevent crime but also to raise revenue. Successive home secretaries were advised that the scheme was poorly drafted, that it threatened civil liberties, that the proposed duties were too high, and that there were procedural difficulties in piloting a bill through parliament that aimed to tax as well as to regulate, but Colquhoun failed to understand any of these objections. 
In January 1795 Colquhoun wrote to Dundas, outlining a number of posts that might be suitable for his talents, adding that although 'I am infinitely indebted to your goodness for the letter you did me the honour to write... it would be more consonant to my feelings to enjoy emolument as the price of labour applied usefully for the benefit of the state' (NA Scot., GD 51/6/1029/1). Frustrated by Dundas's refusal even to see him, Colquhoun seems to have concluded that the best way to secure implementation of his proposals (and hence his own advancement) was to make an appeal to public opinion. His paper to Dundas was revised and published anonymously early in 1796 as his 'Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis'. Its novel use of statistics added authority to arguments already familiar from the works of earlier writers such as Beccaria and Henry Fielding, and helped it to become an immediate success. Public recognition brought him an honorary LLD from the University of Glasgow, the ability to command a personal interview with the home secretary, and a transfer to a much less demanding post in Westminster. His evidence to the select committee on finance (1798) kept his name before the public. He worked hard to keep up the momentum, producing a pamphlet on the subject of his proposed board of police revenue in 1799 and revising and expanding his 'Treatise' through another six editions. 
Colquhoun's reputation was bolstered still further by the recognition that he received for his part in creating the Thames police. The initial plan for the Thames police was drawn up by John Harriott, probably in close collaboration with his uncle, John Staples. Harriott was an expert on river crime and, like Colquhoun, a stipendiary magistrate. Colquhoun became involved when he was asked to advise on Harriott's plans by the West India merchants. Final details were settled at a meeting between Colquhoun, Harriott, and Staples in April 1798. Thereafter, it was Colquhoun's 'superior knowledge and clearer insight into the management of obtaining attention to things of this kind' (Harriott, 2.110-11) that secured sufficient private-sector finance for an experimental scheme in the summer of 1798. Colquhoun sought statutory backing for the new force, outlining his proposals in his 'Treatise on the Commerce and Police of the River Thames' (1800), but the bill subsequently passed by parliament bore little relation to his suggestions. 
Colquhoun craved recognition and bitterly resented what he interpreted as the government's failure to grant him appropriate reward for his services. He treasured several gifts of silver plate that were presented to him by organizations that did appreciate his efforts, instructing his children to keep them as perpetual family heirlooms (some of these are now owned by Glasgow chamber of commerce). Within his own circle of family and friends (who included Jeremy Bentham and John Lettsom) he inspired respect, admiration, and genuine affection, but even Colquhoun's admirers admitted that he was pompous and prone to 'hyperbolic notions' (Holloway, 182-6; BL, Add. MS 33107, Pelham MSS, fol. 308). He was convinced of his own expertise, once even arguing a point of law with the law officers (TNA: PRO, TS 11/931/3302). His famous (though possibly apocryphal) admission that 'Even I myself have made a mistake' was relished in Glasgow long after his departure from that city ('Glasgow Ancient and Modern'). He was so unpopular in Shoreditch that in 1794 he was targeted by rioters. Colquhoun claimed that the attack was aimed at the magistracy in general, but the circulation of handbills identifying 'Informers, spies and agents to Mr Justice Colquhoun' suggests otherwise (TNA: PRO, HO 42/22, Colquhoun, 26 Nov 1792; HO 42/26, Colquhoun, 25 Oct 1793; HO 42/33, Colquhoun to Nepean, 21 Aug 1794). 
In 1802, in yet another attempt to secure preferment, he prepared a lengthy account of his public services (TNA: PRO, HO 42/66, 'Statement of the public services of Patrick Colquhoun esq.', 1 Sept 1802), which became the basis of an adulatory memoir by his son-in-law, G. D. Yeats (Iatros). His posthumous reputation rested partly on this memoir and partly on a misunderstanding of his characteristically eighteenth-century use of the word 'police'. His reputation suffered in the later twentieth century as historians became more critical of the historiography of police reform and more aware of the untapped archival sources that can be used to enrich its study. It is now known that the Home Office had other sources of advice on issues of policing, that Colquhoun's reform proposals were considered unrealistic and unworkable, and that his criticisms not only exaggerated the faults of existing systems but also caused considerable resentment among his colleagues. The wider impact of his writings, however, and the extent to which they shaped long-term changes in public opinion still remain a matter for speculation. 
The passing of the 'Thames Police Act' marked the beginning of Colquhoun's disengagement from police reform. He continued to interest himself in measures to deal with the problems of the labouring poor, including the relief of indigence, the provision of a cheap system of elementary education, and emigration schemes, regularly producing promotional tracts to popularize his causes. He retired from office in 1818 and died in Westminster on 25 April 1820 of a 'schirrous stomach' and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster.

Colquhoun, Sir Patrick Macchombaich (1815-1891), diplomatist and legal writer, was born on 13 April 1815, the eldest son of James Colquhoun (1780-1855) and grandson of Patrick Colquhoun. His father was charge d'affaires of the king of Saxony, the duke of Oldenburg, and of the Hanseatic republics, Lubeck, Bremen, and Hamburg; he was also political agent for many of the West Indian islands, a knight of the Ottoman empire, and commander of the Saxon order of merit. Patrick entered Westminster School on 25 May 1826, left in August 1832, and was admitted pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 27 February 1833. He graduated BA in 1837, MA in 1844, and LLD in 1851; he was also LLD of Heidelberg (1838). On 1 May 1834 he was admitted student of the Inner Temple, and on 4 May 1838 he was called to the bar; he became QC in 1868, bencher of his inn in 1869, and treasurer in 1888. In 1843 he married Katherine, daughter of M. de St Vitalis. They had at least one child, Eliza, who married the orientalist James William Redhouse in 1888. 
Through his father's connection with the Hanse towns, Colquhoun was in 1840 appointed their plenipotentiary to conclude commercial treaties with Turkey, Persia, and Greece. These duties occupied him for four years, and on his return to England in 1844 he joined the home circuit. In 1845 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, during Hallam's presidency; he was placed on the council in 1846, was made librarian in 1852, vice-president in 1869, and president in succession to the duke of Albany in 1886. During his residence in England he wrote a substantial work in four large volumes on Roman civil law (1849-54). In 1857 he was appointed aulic councillor to the king of Saxony, and he was standing counsel to the Saxon legation until it was abolished by the war of 1866. 
In 1858 Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, then colonial secretary, appointed Colquhoun a member of the supreme court of justice in the Ionian Islands, and in 1861 he became chief justice of the court, and was knighted. In the following year the high commissioner, Sir Henry Knight Storks, dismissed two Ionian judges. Colquhoun took their part, and in 1864, after the cession of the islands to Greece, he published a bitter attack on Storks. Storks's action was, however, upheld by the Colonial Office. 
Between 1875 and 1878 Colquhoun published two works on legal subjects and one on foreign affairs, provoked by events in Bulgaria. In 1886 he was elected honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. He died at his chambers in King's Bench Walk, 41 the Temple, on 18 May 1891; he was survived by his wife. 
Colquhoun was a man of remarkable linguistic attainments; he spoke most of the tongues and many of the dialects of Europe, was a thorough classical scholar and a jurist. He received orders of merit from the sultan of Turkey, the kings of Greece and of Saxony, and the duke of Oldenburg. He was also, like his brother, James du Colquhoun (died 1891), who founded the Cercle Nautique at Cannes, a noted oarsman. In 1837 (one source says 1835) he won the Wingfield sculls, which made him amateur champion of England, and in the same year he founded the Colquhoun sculls for the benefit of the Lady Margaret Boat Club; in 1842 the prize was thrown open to the university. In 1837 he also rowed at Henley in a race between St John's College, Cambridge, and Queen's College, Oxford, the head boats of the respective universities, and for many years he was secretary of the Leander Boat Club.

Colson, John (1680-1759), mathematician and translator, was born in Lichfield, the eldest of six children of Francis Coleson (or Colson), vicar-choral of Lichfield Cathedral, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was the nephew and godson of John Strype, the ecclesiastical historian. He attended Lichfield grammar school and on 26 May 1699 matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, but left without taking a degree. His first publication, 'The universal resolution of cubic and biquadratic equations' ('PTRS', 5, 1670), describes a method using geometric constructions of circles and parabolas to solve third and fourth degree polynomial equations. This monograph was appended to Newton's 'Arithmeticae universalis' (1732). In 1709 Colson was appointed master of the new mathematical school founded by Joseph Williamson at Rochester in Kent, and he was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 11 June 1713. On 10 September 1724 he was appointed vicar of the parish church at Chalk near Gravesend. 
In 1726 Colson published his 'Account of negativo-affirmative arithmetic' ('PTRS', vol. 34), describing an innovative method for representing integers using positive and negative digits and how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide using his two-way numerical notation. He collaborated with the Revd Samuel D'Oyly, vicar of St Nicholas's in Rochester, in producing the 'Chronological Dictionary of Rev. Father Dom Augustin Calmet' (3 vols., 1732), a translation from the original French. The work reveals Colson's interest in arithmetic, calculations, tables, and measurement. In 1736 he published 'The construction and use of spherical maps' ('PTRS', vol. 39). The treatise dealt with a mapping problem and recommended the use of cylinders to project from spheres onto planar maps. His interest in geography led to the invention of the 'British hemisphere', a map of the habitable world confined to a hemisphere with London located at the top. 
Most of his life Colson was employed as a translator by booksellers. 'The Method of Fluxions and Infinite Series' (1736), the first complete English translation of Newton's 1671 untitled manuscript on fluxions, helped build Colson's reputation as a scholar. In order to temper the conciseness of Newton's style and make Newton's works more accessible to both mathematician and non-mathematician alike he added extensive explanatory notes. 
On 23 April 1728 Colson was elected a member of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and granted a master's degree by George II. In 1737 Gilbert Walmsley, registrar of the ecclesiastical court at Lichfield, wrote to Colson recommending Samuel Johnson and David Garrick to his care and encouragement, and subsequently Garrick studied for a few months at Rochester. Two years later Colson resigned his headmastership at the Rochester school. As a teacher and administrator his record was not impressive: he was characterized as too concerned with his own 'speculations to have much interest in the efforts of young pupils to master the first principles of mathematics' (Flower, 31). 
After leaving the Rochester school Colson was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where on 11 March 1739 he was appointed the college's first Taylor lecturer. Two months later, on the death of Nicholas Saunderson, he was elected fifth Lucasian professor in preference to the mathematician Abraham De Moivre. Colson used his influence and skills to help publish Saunderson's 'Elements of Algebra' the following year, and appended an explanation of Saunderson's palpable arithmetic, a device with which Saunderson, who was blind, used to perform intricate arithmetic calculations. He also assisted in the publication of Saunderson's 'Method of Fluxions' (1751) and an abridged edition of his 'Elements of Algebra' (1756). 
As Lucasian professor, Colson was a member of the board of longitude when it recommended financial assistance to John Harrison to complete a third chronometer. William Cole, the antiquary, wrote that Colson 'was a plain, honest man, of great industry and assiduity, but the University was much disappointed in its expectations of a professor that was to give credit to it by his lectures' (Cole MSS, BL, Add. MS 5866, 3). 
In 1744 Colson published 'Elements of Natural Philosophy', translated from the Latin work of Pieter Musschenbroek, and in 1752, 'Lectures in Experimental Philosophy', from Jean Antoine Nollet's original. He then became captivated by Maria Agnesi's 'Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventu italiana' (1748). He learned Italian in order to translate the work, prepared it for press, drew up a proposal to finance the project by subscription, and wrote an introduction and an outline entitled 'A plan of the lady's system of analytics', but the work was not published during his lifetime. A mistranslation by Colson of 'versed sine' gave rise to a curve bearing the name 'witch of Agnesi'. In 1801, at his own expense, Francis Maseres, with the editorial assistance of John Hellins, published Colson's translation. Colson died in Cambridge on 16 December 1759 and at the time of his death held the position of rector of Lockington in Yorkshire.

Coelson, Lancelot (1627-1687?), astrologer and medical practitioner, was born on 25 March 1627 at Colchester. His astrological 'accidents' record that he married in 1645 (at the age of eighteen), but his wife's name is unknown. He was wounded fighting in Cromwell's Scottish campaign in 1650. By the mid-1650s he had settled in London, close to the Tower, where he remained for the rest of his life; from 1671 to 1685 he was at the Royal Oak, Still Yard, on Great Tower Hill. On 23 March 1656 he visited a Fifth Monarchist conventicle in Swan Alley, Coleman Street, apparently out of curiosity, and was so alarmed by the bloodthirsty rhetoric urging Cromwell's assassination that he gave a full account to Sir John Barkstead, lieutenant of the Tower. It was a glimpse of the disaffection that was to lead to Venner's attempted rising in April 1657. 
From about 1655 Coelson practised astrology and medicine, specializing in venereal disease, deafness, and scrofula. He received patients in the morning and visited the sick in the afternoon. In 1656 he published 'The Poor-Mans Physician and Chyrurgian', dedicated to Barkstead. Based on traditional galenical principles, it provided sensible guidelines and details of 300 medical recipes. By 1668, when he published his alchemical work 'Philosophia maturata', he had come to adopt Paracelsian principles; the tract described the preparation of 'aurum potabile' (drinkable gold), and gave details of chemical medicines taken from 'L'or potable' (1611) by the Italian physician Angelo Sala. He also published a series of almanacs for the years 1671-87, passing them off as the products of a few weeks' recreation. They include copious historical notes on the 1640s and 1650s, which reveal some traces of his old parliamentary loyalties, and fiercely protestant comments on the Popish Plot. Several editions carry dedications to influential friends: Sir William Warren the shipowner, Sir John Friend MP, with whom Coelson served for twenty years in the Tower trained bands, Sir Richard Howe MP, sheriff of London and a major in the Surrey trained bands, William Coulson, gentleman, of Jesmond near Newcastle (possibly a kinsman), and Robert Seaman, surgeon and alderman of Harwich. 
Coelson used the almanacs to advertise his medical services, cosmetic products, and proprietary medicines, which were supplied through several outlets in London and by a shopkeeper in Wiltshire. In his deposition in 1656 he described himself as 'gentleman', and the almanac dedications sought to convey a sense of respectability. In 1666, as 'Lan. Coleson M. D.', he signed a testimonial recommending another physician to be licensed by the bishop of London (Guildhall Library London, MS10, 116/4), which underlines the position he had achieved. His friends included many of the leading astrologers of the day, including Lilly, Richard Saunders, Richard Edlin, John Gadbury, and Henry Coley. Despite his 'incomparable' medicines Coelson suffered prolonged poor health. Noting serious recent illnesses in his almanacs for 1680, 1682, 1684, and 1685, he took the opportunity each time to correct reports that he was dead, reassuring readers that his professional services were still available. The almanac for 1687 was his last work, and he probably died in that year. It is possible that Coelson was related to John Colson the mathematician and Nathaniel Colson, who published a nautical almanac in 1675 which went through several editions.

Colston, Edward (1636-1721), merchant and philanthropist, was born on 2 November 1636 in Temple Street, Bristol, the eldest of probably eleven children (six boys and five girls are known) of William Colston (1608-1681), a merchant, and his wife, Sarah, 'nee' Batten (died 1701). His father had served an apprenticeship with Richard Aldworth, one of the wealthiest Bristol merchants of the early Stuart period, and had prospered as a merchant. A royalist and an alderman, William Colston was removed from his office by order of parliament in 1645 after Prince Rupert surrendered the city to the roundhead forces. Until that point Edward Colston had been brought up in Bristol and probably at Winterbourne, south Gloucestershire, where his father had an estate. 
The Colston family moved to London during the English civil war. Little is known about Edward Colston's education, though it is possible that he was a private pupil at Christ's Hospital. In 1654 he was apprenticed to the London Mercers' Company for eight years. By 1672 he was shipping goods from London, and the following year he was enrolled in the Mercers' Company. He soon built up a lucrative mercantile business, trading with Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Africa. Much of his wealth is thought to have been made in buying and selling slaves. In 1680 he became a member of the Royal African Company and subsequently sat on a number of their committees. 
During the 1680s Colston began to take an active interest in his native city, where his parents had resettled. In 1682 he made a loan to the Bristol corporation. In 1683 he visited his fatally ill brother Thomas in the city; on this occasion he became a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers and a burgess. After Thomas's death in 1684 he inherited a mercantile business in Small Street and also became a partner in a sugar refinery at St Peter's Churchyard. He seems to have lived in Bristol for a while, but by 1689 he had taken up residence at Mortlake, Surrey, which was his base for the rest of his life. He continued to engage in overseas trade, mainly in London ventures, and made substantial business profits. 
Though there is no record of a further visit by him to Bristol until 1700, Colston in middle age became one of the most famous philanthropic benefactors to his native city. In the 1690s he founded and endowed almshouses in King Street and on St Michael's Hill. He also endowed Queen Elizabeth's Hospital, a school for boys, and was instrumental in helping the Merchant Venturers to found Colston's Boys' School, which opened in 1710. Two years later he donated money for a school in Temple parish to educate and clothe forty poor boys. He gave money to other charity schools in Bristol and provided funds for the embellishment of several of the city's churches, including Temple, St Mary Redcliffe, St Werburgh, All Saints, and Bristol Cathedral. His munificence also extended to other parts of the country, and he gave benefactions to churches, hospitals, workhouses, and almshouses in London, Surrey, Devon, and Lancashire. But these did not match the extent of his charitable gifts to Bristol. 
Colston was a strong tory and high-churchman who attended daily service at the cathedral when he was staying in Bristol. An opponent of Catholicism, dissent, and whiggism, he insisted that the boys at Colston's School should be Anglicans and that they be prepared for apprenticeships. He laid down strict conditions for his public charities, and founded a series of Lenten lectures in 1710 for which he chose the subjects. He was elected a member of the SPCK in 1709. In October 1710 he was returned as an MP for Bristol, but he took little active part in parliament and did not seek re-election after the dissolution that occurred with Queen Anne's death. 
An obstinate man who set restrictions to his charitable donations, Colston remained a bachelor. He retired from business in 1708 and died on 11 October 1721 at his home in Mortlake. His public charities amounted to nearly $71,000 and he bequeathed $100,000 to his relatives. He left detailed instructions for his funeral: his body was carried in a hearse from London to Bristol, and then accompanied by people who had benefited from his Bristol charities to his burial on 27 October amid much pomp and ceremony at All Saints' Church. The effigy on his tomb was executed by Rysbrack from Richardson's portrait of him in the Council House, Bristol. 
Colston has been remembered in Bristol since his death. His memory was celebrated for many years by the Colston or 'Parent' Society, founded in 1726; by the Dolphin Society, set up by the tories in 1749; by the Grateful Society, founded in 1758, which had no political affiliation; and by the Anchor Society, founded by the whigs in 1769. Celebrating Colston's memory was part of the civic ritual of Georgian Bristol, the anniversary of his birth becoming virtually a public holiday after the 1720s. It still serves as a time for raising large donations, which are used for charitable purposes. Many of his foundations flourish today, notably the Bristol schools he established. A bronze statue of him stands in Colston Avenue, and the philanthropist is also honoured by the city's chief concert venue, the Colston Hall, and various streets that are named after him.

John Colt the younger (bap. 1606, d. 1665) was baptized on 13 April 1606 at the French church, Threadneedle Street, in the City of London. John Colt the elder was buried on 9 August 1637 at St Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield, in the City of London. The younger John was an assistant to Hubert Le Sueur, court sculptor to Charles I. One of the two Johns, probably the younger, made sculpture for the chapel of the London Charterhouse in the late 1630s. It consisted mainly of a commandment table flanked by statues of Moses and Aaron which probably served as an altar reredos; a wall tablet with figures of the twelve apostles, also supplied by the same sculptor, may have formed part of the same structure. The tablet is lost but parts of the commandment table have been rediscovered. The younger John married Elizabeth Woodham at St Bartholomew's Church on 21 May 1635 and died of plague thirty years later, being buried at St Bartholomew's on 20 August 1665.

Colt, Maximilian (fl. 1595-1645), sculptor, was born at Arras. After a stay in Utrecht he went to England, probably as a protestant refugee. He was in London by 1595 and Anglicized his surname (his former name, Poultrain or Poutrain, is taken from English sources and is possibly corrupt). In January 1607 he became an English citizen. 
On 31 January 1604 Colt had married Susanna Gheeraerts (died 1645), a niece of the king's deputy serjeant painter John De Critz the elder. The royal connection was to be of enormous value and must have helped him secure the most prestigious commission available to any sculptor in England at the time, that of the tomb of Elizabeth I in Westminster Abbey (1605-6). Traditional in form but up-to-date in style, it was very competently executed and seems to have given satisfaction. In the year it was completed Colt was asked to make another royal memorial, this time commemorating Princess Sophia, the infant daughter of James I, who had died the previous June. This is a work of remarkable, indeed unprecedented naturalism and shows the child asleep in a cradle, lying at Queen Elizabeth's feet. It was complete by December 1607. In the same month Sophia's elder sister Mary died and Colt found himself making a third royal memorial (1608). The two girls are represented side by side, but Mary, who was only two years old at the time of her death, is portrayed as a miniature adult, dressed in her best clothes and reclining on a tomb chest in a stiff, awkward posture which was then becoming fashionable. 
In July 1608 Colt was appointed to the specially created post of master sculptor or master carver to the king. In this capacity he was called upon to do a wide range of work; much of it was quite humble and routine, and it included carving in wood as well as marble and stone. Most notably, he supplied and installed three chimney-pieces at Denmark House (old Somerset House) in 1610-11 and carved a 'greate newe wyndowe' (probably a pierced wooden screen) for the chapel at Greenwich Palace in 1623-4. He also did decorative carving on the royal barges and supplied effigies for the funerals of Anne of Denmark (1619) and James I (1625). The effigies survive in part only at Westminster Abbey and the rest of the work has entirely perished. 
Colt's greatest patron was not James himself but his lord treasurer, Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury. A man of culture and artistic discernment, Cecil advanced Colt's career in the royal service and employed him privately. For the earl's country seat, Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, Colt executed at least three chimney-pieces, including, almost certainly, that in the King James drawing-room, which has a life-size statue of the king on the upper tier. This work was begun 'c'.1609 and in the same year Colt submitted a model of Salisbury's own tomb which was eventually erected after his death in Hatfield parish church ('c'.1614- 'c'.1618). The tomb must rank as Colt's masterpiece, though it probably owes much to Salisbury's own ideas and initiative. The earl is shown recumbent on a slab of black marble supported by kneeling figures of the cardinal virtues while below the slab is a symbolic skeleton on a rolled straw mat. The work was revolutionary for the England of its day in that it was not painted in bright colours or embellished with features borrowed from architecture; instead, it depends for its effect on the character and disposition of the figures and on a simple contrast of black and white marbles. The white marble was Carrara, supplied at great expense from Italy by Salisbury himself. 
After the funeral of James I in 1625, Colt gained no further royal patronage. His career, which seems to have been already in decline by this time, apparently petered out by the end of the 1630s. Either he or his son of the same name ('bap'. 1609) was released from the Fleet debtors' gaol by 1641. He appears to have been still alive in 1644-5 and no replacement had been found for him in the royal service before the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, strongly suggesting that he had held office at least until the outbreak of the English civil war in 1642.

Colton, (Charles) Caleb (bap. 1777, d. 1832), writer and Church of England clergyman, was baptized at Shrivenham, Berkshire, on 11 December 1777, the son of Barfoot Colton ('bap'. 1736, died 1803), who had been elected to King's College, Cambridge, in 1755, and was afterwards canon of Salisbury. Caleb Colton was educated at Eton College before being elected in 1796 to King's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1799, and graduated BA in 1801 and MA in 1804. In 1801 he was presented by his college to the rectory of Prior's Portion, Tiverton, tenable with a fellowship. Here he published a sermon in 1809, a 'Plain and Authentic Narrative of the Sampford Ghost' in 1810, and 'Hypocrisy: a Satire in Three Books' (only one book published) in 1812. 
Colton's character, talents, and opinions were better suited to a literary than to a clerical career, and he was also better known for his skill as a sportsman and fisherman than for any work as a divine. In 1818 he was presented to the college living of Kew and Petersham, Surrey, but it was here that his eccentricities, such as precipitately ending a service to go partridge shooting, became marked. A writer in the 'Literary Magnet' who first met him in company with 'Walking Stewart' (John Stewart) (1749-1822) found him wearing military dress, appropriate, Colton claimed, to 'an officer of the church 'militant'' ('GM', 565). Colton apparently maintained that it was cheaper to live in London than at his living, and the same writer described his lodgings, which were over a marine-store shop, as squalid and littered with books, fishing-rods, and manuscripts. Cyrus Redding, however, countered this with his own declaration that Colton was always temperate, and his living quarters were clean. For a time Colton carried on business as a wine merchant. 
In 1816 Colton published a poem, initially entitled 'Napoleon', as 'Lines on the Conflagration of Moscow' (4th edn, 1822), and his 'Remarks Critical and Moral on the Talents of Lord Byron' appeared in 1819. The first volume of his best-known work, 'Lacon, or, Many Things in Few Words Addressed to those who Think', was published in 1820, and had run to six editions by 1821. A second volume was added in 1822, and it was frequently reprinted. It is a collection of moral aphorisms, often very forcibly expressed, and some contemporaries charged him with borrowing from Bacon's 'Essays' and the 'Materials for Thinking' of William Burdon. 
Colton was addicted to gambling, and became financially embarrassed. He had associated with John Thurtell, who murdered William Weare in 1823. When Colton disappeared about the same time, Thurtell was at first thought to be involved. According to Redding, however, Colton had in fact retired to America, his debts having been caused by speculations in Spanish bonds. He went to Paris, and in 1827 returned to claim his living. In 1828, however, he was officially removed for non-residence, and a successor was appointed. 
Colton again visited America, and finally settled in Paris. He gambled at the Palais Royal, and is said at one time to have gained $25,000, to have collected a picture gallery, and afterwards to have been ruined. Colton suffered from a painful disease, and falsified one of the remarks in 'Lacon', that no one ever committed suicide from bodily anguish, though thousands have done so from mental anguish, when, rather than submit to a surgical operation, he shot himself on 28 April 1832, while visiting Major Markham Sherwell at Fontainebleau. A volume called 'Modern Antiquity, and other Poems' was edited by Sherwell in 1835.

Colton, John (d. 1404), archbishop of Armagh and justiciar of Ireland, was born at Terrington, Norfolk. Chaplain by 1343 to William Bateman, bishop of Norwich, Colton became doctor of canon law at Cambridge 'c'.1348. In June 1349 he was made first warden of Gonville Hall, founded by Edmund Gonville, rector of Terrington. He succeeded his patron in Terrington from 1350 to 1351, retaining his post at Gonville until 1360. He was collated on 14 August 1377 to the prebend of Bugthorpe, York, exchanged (1380) for the prebend of Coton in St Mary's royal free chapel, Stafford. Colton's Irish connection dates from at least 1361, when, described as chamberlain to the late archbishop of Armagh (Richard Fitzralph), he was papally provided to the treasurership of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was certainly in residence by the early 1370s, and described as dean of St Patrick's before October 1373. Other Irish preferments included the prebend of Clashmore in Lismore diocese. 
Colton's appointment as treasurer of Ireland on 2 September 1372 is unlikely to have been his first administrative office. He gained considerable military experience in the lordship's defence, particularly in Leinster, and on occasion personally funded emergency troops. He subsequently accounted as treasurer, from 1372 until September 1375. In May 1378 Colton went to England where, in December, he undertook to answer charges laid by Nicholas Dagworth. Appointed chancellor on 8 May 1380, he remained in office until 15 February 1382, although his successor, William Tany, was named on 26 November 1381. He was with the lieutenant, Edmund (III) Mortimer, earl of March, when the earl's sudden death in Cork in December 1381 caused an emergency. Colton reluctantly and conditionally accepted the post of justiciar in January 1382 and successfully defended Cork. He resigned the office on 3 March 1382 and went immediately to England. After Archbishop Sweetman's death in August 1380, he initially had charge of the temporalities of Armagh, and was himself promoted to the archbishopric by papal provision in January 1381. He was consecrated in London on 8 March 1383. 
As archbishop Colton did not again hold administrative office. He used his influence in the defence of the lordship, helping, for example, in negotiations to buy off the menace of the O Raghallaigh family in Meath in 1391-2. Richard II wrote to him (letter undated) thanking him for his service in the lordship. During the royal expedition to Ireland, 1394-5, Colton played a key role in the submission of the Ulster Irish, as evident in surviving letters from O Neill and O Cathain to him and from the Ulster Irish to Richard II. He was absent on the king's business in Rome from 12 August 1398 to 8 September 1399, including the period of Richard's second Irish expedition. In 1401 he accompanied the archbishop of Dublin as envoy to Henry IV with a plea from the Irish council for aid for the lordship. During this visit Irish letters patent of 1333 were exemplified, confirming the primacy of Armagh. 
Colton succeeded in establishing Armagh's claim to the Blackpriory of St Andrew in the Ards in September 1392, a grant confirmed three times within the decade. A notarial copy of his metropolitan visitation of Derry in October 1397 provides a rare record of conditions within an Irish diocese in the late fourteenth century. In 1398, to augment the impoverished 'mensa' of the archbishop, he was granted the patronage of St James's, Athboy, in the diocese of Meath. He participated in enquiries concerning the life and miracles of Archbishop Fitzralph. Colton died on 27 April 1404 in Drogheda, Meath, having shortly before resigned his see, and was buried in St Peter's, Drogheda. His episcopal register does not survive, although a few relevant documents are found in the register of his successor, Archbishop Swayne. 
Colton had a reputation for learning and wrote two treatises, not extant, on the papal schism: 'De causis schismatis' and 'De remediis ejusdem'.

Columba (c.521-597), monastic founder, was also known by the Old Irish name of Colum Cille, meaning, approximately, 'Church Dove'. He was the son of Fedelmid, of the royal lineage of Conall Gulban mac Neill, and of Ethne, daughter of Mac Naue. His immediate paternal relatives were rulers in the north-west of Ireland while his wider kin group, the Ui Neill ('descendants of Niall') were already emerging in the sixth century as Ireland's dominant royal dynasty. Columba thus was born into the highest rank of Irish nobility. Gartan, in Donegal, is traditionally claimed as his place of birth, but there is no documentary source earlier than the twelfth century to verify this. It may be assumed, however, that his homeland was in the north-west, among the Cenel Conaill ('the kindred of Conall'), the people whose designation commemorated Columba's great-grandfather. 
The date of Columba's birth, 'c'.521, is based on the known fact that he died in the year 597, aged about seventy-six. The fifth century had seen Christianity established widely in Ireland, and while it cannot be assumed that the process was complete by Columba's time, nevertheless, there seems no good reason to doubt that his family was Christian. The seventh-century life of Columba (Adomnan's 'Vita Columbae'), the main source of biographical information, makes brief mention of his foster father, a priest called Cruithnechan, and refers also to his teachers: a master called Gemman in Leinster, with whom he studied as a young deacon, and a bishop called variously Findbarr, Finnio, or Uinniau. The implication is that Columba's commitment to religion began at an early age, but the life, which focuses primarily on the manifestations of sanctity in his monastic career, does not trace his progress towards this goal. In fact, while it may be inferred that he became a monk and priest, and that he may have founded monasteries in his native territory, Columba's career up to his forty-second year is unrecorded. The defining moment of his life came in that year, 563, when he left Ireland for the west coast of Scotland. 
The life of Columba states that he went to Britain in the second year following the battle of Cul Dreimne, 'wishing to be a pilgrim for Christ' ('Adomnan's Life of Columba', second preface). While the reference to the battle may have served merely as a chronological marker, the conjunction of battle and exile have long prompted speculation that they were connected. Irish sources from the tenth or eleventh century onward portrayed Columba's departure from Ireland as a penance, self-imposed or otherwise, for having instigated the battle. Annalistic accounts of the battle itself, while not contemporary, may retain a genuine record of the defeat of the king of Tara, from the southern Ui Neill, by a northern alliance which included two of Columba's relations. A reference in the life to the wrongful excommunication of Columba by an Irish synod in Tailtiu in southern Ui Neill territory has been viewed as a further significant factor in these events. Did the Tara king seek to avenge his defeat at the hands of Columba's kin by inducing clerics from his own kingdom to this act of censure? It is possible that Columba could have incurred the wrath of opponents of his royal relations. Yet there is no corroborating evidence to suggest a direct connection between battle, synod, and exile. 
In broader terms, however, it may be supposed that Columba's membership of the Ui Neill royal dynasty was not a negligible factor in determining the course of his career. His family's involvement in secular politics may have made a life of monastic withdrawal in his homeland increasingly difficult. Therefore, having formerly renounced his secular position, Columba may have felt compelled to further renunciation, to distancing himself from familial territory for the sake of Christ. Indeed, as early Irish secular law equated exile from community with loss of status and rights, so Irish monasticism viewed voluntary separation from home and kin as self-abnegation meriting high heavenly reward. 
How was the destination of Columba's exile chosen? The sources do not provide a direct answer. However, a list, dating from the early eighth century, of the twelve companions on the journey from Ireland includes an uncle, Ernan, and two first cousins, Baithene and Cobthach, suggesting that Columba's journey was planned with the support of his kin. Moreover, the life depicts Columba soon after arrival in Britain in the company of the ruler of Dal Riata, the area of south-west Scotland colonized by Irish settlers some decades previously. This suggests, not a random sea journey, but conscious choice of an Irish overseas community, whose ruler may have had some association with Columba's royal relatives. The assertion in the Irish annals that Iona was given to Columba by Conall mac Comgaill, king of Dal Riata, is not contemporary, but it seems to be confirmed by the available evidence. 
Columba's Scottish career thus began in the Dal Riata kingdom, which retained ties of language, culture, and politics with Ireland. His decision to settle on the small, apparently unpopulated, island of Iona, off the south-western tip of Mull, indicates that the primary focus of his pilgrimage was ascetic. The sources suggest that Dal Riata was mainly Christian at this time. But if Columba had initially sought a pastoral role within the kingdom, or a missionary role beyond, he would surely have wished his chief foundation to be closer to a centre of power and population. The earliest surviving source about Columba, a vernacular praise poem known as 'Amra Coluim Cille' ('The eulogy of Colum Cille'), written in Ireland at about the time of his death, provides independent support for the testimony of Adomnan's 'Vita Columbae' that Columba's religious vocation was to the monastic life. 
However, since the island community needed outside assistance to maintain itself, especially in its early stages, Iona's intended function cannot have been as an isolated hermitage, but rather as a monastery open to visitors. Whether or not Columba's fame as a churchman had preceded him from Ireland, his reputation in Dal Riata apparently became established within a short time. The life reveals that, as well as those bringing necessary supplies, there came to Iona a constant stream of pilgrims, penitents, and aspiring monks. Was the response to his foundation greater than Columba anticipated? It certainly seems to have led to the extension of the activities of his community beyond Iona, and to the establishment of monastic foundations on other islands and on mainland Dal Riata territory. Some outlying monasteries may have served Iona in a specific way, as in the case of Campus Lunge, on the island of Tiree, where penitents who came to Iona were accommodated. Other foundations probably replicated the activity of Iona, maintaining a monastic community which served also as a focus of religious life for secular and ecclesiastical visitors. 
A telling vignette in the life depicts Columba setting off into the wilder parts of Iona to find a place secluded from other people where he could pray alone. It encapsulates a life dedicated to following the monastic vocation, while also energetically involved in overseeing a growing ecclesiastical organization. Although Columba may have relinquished the privileges accorded by his birth, nevertheless his royal background appears to have had a formative influence on the way he governed his churches. In the case of the additional monasteries founded from Iona, he nominated a prior to administer each of these communities under his own overall authority. He visited outlying churches and constantly maintained communication with his growing 'familia'. This pattern of government, wherein Iona retained primacy over its dependent churches, seems to derive from the secular Irish model of royal overlordship. It is notable, moreover, that kinship played an important role in Columba's monastic organization. Members of his extended family who had accompanied him into exile were among his first appointees to govern Iona's dependencies. The life reveals that Ernan, Columba's uncle, was prior of the important foundation on the island of 'Hinba', while his cousin Baithene was in charge of Campus Lunge on Tiree. Ties of family as well as of religion thus consolidated the unity of the churches. 
Moreover, the umbilical connection with Ireland was not cut. Columba's Iona monastery was visited by pilgrims and churchmen from his homeland, and he is depicted in his life as sending emissaries to Ireland, and as visiting the country himself on at least two occasions. It was probably envisaged that Columba's native territory should continue to provide members of his monastic community in Scotland, yet the contact went beyond the necessities of recruitment. In fact, about two decades after his initial departure, Columba returned to Ireland to found the new monastery of Durrow in the midland region of the country. Moreover, he placed another of his relatives, Laisren, a monk of Iona, in charge there. It is possible that churches such as Derry and Drumhome in Columba's native northern Ui Neill territory had already been founded by him before his Iona mission but there is no evidence as to their status 'vis-a-vis' Iona. It is the foundation of Durrow which emphatically links Ireland with Scotland within the monastic 'familia' of Columba. 
Columba's royal descent seems to have been as influential in the external relations of his monastic community as in its internal government. Family contacts may have facilitated his initial settlement in Dal Riata and the granting to him of Iona, yet his relationship with the ruling dynasty of Dal Riata is not the conventional relationship of beneficiary towards patrons. Rather, the Iona abbot is portrayed as actively monitoring the conduct of kingship in his adopted territory. The life of Columba tells of his prayers to ensure royal success in battle and of his concern regarding succession to the Dal Riata kingship. There may be scepticism about the historical accuracy of the 'Old Testament'-influenced account of Columba's 'ordination' of Aedan mac Gabran as king of Dal Riata about 574, but it does seem credible that it had become politic for the local king to associate himself with Columba's prestige, and to receive the holy man's blessing on his inauguration. Subsequently, moreover, Columba apparently instigated a 'conference of kings', which brought the Scottish ruler to Druim Cett in the north of Ireland to meet Aed mac Ainmerech, overking of the Ui Neill, who was Columba's cousin. The resulting alliance between the Scottish ruler and Columba's royal kinsman in Ireland can be attributed to the Iona abbot's status and to his unique position of influence on both sides of the Irish Sea. The meeting of kings not only formalized relations between Columba's native and adopted kingdoms, but also provided a secure environment in which his monastic endeavour might flourish. 
While hagiography is not historical fact, it is notable that kings, both in Ireland and in Britain, are consistently depicted in the life of Columba as subjects of saintly intervention. That Columba held that a king of his Ui Neill kin had 'the prerogative of monarchy over the kingdom of all Ireland predestined... by God' ('Adomnan's Life of Columba', bk 1, cap. 14) is literary representation, yet it finds some corroboration. For instance, historical evidence places the Iona abbot's return to Ireland to found the monastery of Durrow between the years 585 and 589. From about 587 Aed mac Ainmerech, as king of the northern Ui Neill, had extended his dominance over his southern Ui Neill kinsmen. Thus, the timing of Columba's return to Ireland to establish the monastery of Durrow among the southern Ui Neill may be seen both as the outcome of, and as a support for, the achievement of political overlordship by his royal relatives. 
While Columba's closest royal contacts were in Dal Riata and in Ireland, nevertheless, his horizons extended beyond a world which was ethnically and linguistically Irish. The life states that the king of the neighbouring British kingdom of Strathclyde was Columba's friend. Moreover, Columba is represented as visiting the stronghold of the Pictish king, Brude son of Maelchon. While the life does not provide a chronological framework for narratives concerning Columba's activities in Pictland, it does indicate the likely catalyst of his first visit. He travelled beyond 'the Spine of Britain', the mountain boundary between Dal Riata and Pictland, after the monk Cormac had put to sea in search of a hermitage. Thus, concern to ensure the safety of monastic voyagers who might land in Pictish-dominated areas apparently impelled the Iona abbot to visit the king. 
It is reasonable to assume that Columba and his brethren were made aware on their travels of a need to preach Christianity to the pagan Picts. 'Amra Coluim Cille' may be interpreted as declaring that 'he preached to the tribes of Tay' (Stokes, 164-5). There are references in the life to individual conversions, and to Columba's preaching the gospel through an interpreter. Yet there is little to indicate that a large-scale mission of conversion was initiated from Iona at that time. Certainly, conversion was a prized saintly attribute, and the life of Columba includes some stock hagiographical episodes describing his confrontation with a pagan Pictish 'magus'. There is, however, no historical warrant for the view that missionary activity came to dominate Columba's life. Although Bede states that Columba converted the Picts and received Iona from them, it would appear, rather, that the abbot's diplomacy, and his negotiating status as a fellow nobleman, had won from the Pictish king toleration of travelling and preaching in his territory. This tenuous 'modus vivendi' did gain access to Pictland for Christian teaching, and thus paved the way for the subsequent evangelization of the kingdom. 
In a career of thirty-four years in Britain, Columba organized, travelled, and negotiated in the interests of his community. He used his influence with kings for the welfare of the church and of secular society. His activities spanned both Scotland and Ireland, as indeed did his federation of monasteries. Yet his base was Iona, and monasticism, with its daily round of prayer, work, writing, and study, remained at the core of his religious life. The Iona monastic regime of observance and work seems to have been guided, moreover, by the abbot's humanity and empathy rather than by his strict insistence on law. The life of Columba portrays his solicitude for monks who were hard-worked at the harvest and at building. It reveals his willingness to relax the fast when visitors came to the island, and his clemency toward those who came to Iona to expiate past sins. Attachment to his native land is linked with compassion, as in the story of his care for a crane from Ireland cast by buffeting winds onto the Iona shore. Certainly Columba castigated evil doing, as in the memorable portrayal of his striding out knee-deep into the water in pursuit of marauders. But his altruism is what predominates, to the extent that, having unwittingly blessed a knife, he is said to have at once prayed that it should hurt neither man nor beast. 
It is notable that Columba's lack of awareness that he had blessed a potentially deadly implement is attributed to his concentration on his writing. That scholarship was as important as asceticism in Columba's community is attested by the evidence of the vernacular 'Amra' and of the life. In stating of Columba that 'he could not pass even the space of a single hour without applying himself to prayer or to reading or to writing or some other kind of work' ('Adomnan's Life of Columba', second preface), the life significantly adds writing to a list of activities otherwise similar to that found in the life of Martin of Tours by Sulpicius Severus (died 410). The copying of books is mentioned throughout the life, and among works stated to have been copied by Columba were the 'Psalms' and a book of the week's hymns. 
The 'Amra', in praising Columba's learning, is more specific about what he read and studied. The 'Bible' is cited, in particular the 'Psalms', the books of 'Solomon', and 'the books of the Law'. Moreover, Columba is said to have used the judgments of St Basil (died 379) and to have studied Greek grammar, as well as the movement of the heavenly bodies and the course of the sea. While poetic eulogy may have idealized the range of his learned activity, nevertheless, the 'Amra' testimony is sufficiently close to the period of his lifetime to reflect contemporary scholarship. Most telling among 'Amra' citations is a reference to John Cassian (died 435), leading interpreter of monasticism in western Christendom. That Columba's monasticism was guided by the principles of a recognized authority is consistent with other evidence that his vocation combined intellectual scrutiny with ascetic and humanitarian commitment. 
It was fitting that Columba should end his days among his own Iona community, after a full life of about seventy-six years. Reflecting community recollections of his last days, Adomnan's life of Columba tells how he inspected the barn to see that his 'familia' was well supplied with food, and how the monastery's horse came up to him and mourned, sensing that its master was to depart for ever. Columba's final work, the copying of a psalter, ceased at the words of the thirty-third psalm: 'But they that seek the Lord shall not want for anything that is good.' The abbot rose to attend the midnight office as usual with the brethren, on 9 June 597, but he collapsed and breathed his last in the church, surrounded by his monks. His wish that his funeral ceremonies should not be an occasion for large crowds in Iona was granted, as a storm prevented any boat from crossing to the island during the ritual three days of obsequies. Thus, his monastic community laid Columba in the Iona earth, in a simple grave marked only by the stone which he had used for a pillow in his spartan cell. The location of this grave cannot now be identified. 
His gravestone was not, in any case, the sole remembrance of Columba's achievement. The organization which he had put in place ensured that his monastic 'familia' continued to flourish under the leadership of Iona-based abbots of his own kin ['see 'Iona, abbots of]. In the seventh century, as new churches in Ireland and in Pictland were added to the 'familia', an invitation from the Northumbrian ruler Oswald took Iona clerics to Lindisfarne, where a short-lived Columban presence made a substantial contribution to the Christianization of the north of England. In 697, the centenary year of Columba's death, about ninety of the most prominent ecclesiastical and secular leaders of Ireland and Scotland endorsed a law for the protection of non-combatants brought forward by Columba's Iona successor and biographer, Adomnan. In the eighth century, further Irish enactments of a church-state measure, termed 'Lex Columbe Cille', testify to the continuing influential role of Columba's community in alliance with powerful kings. 
From the beginning of the ninth century, however, the transmarine unity of the Columban world was put in jeopardy by the appearance of viking raiders around the Irish and British coasts. Iona was among churches severely attacked, so that Kells in the Irish midlands was founded as a refuge for Iona monks and its precious relics. By the tenth century, under the impact of the vikings, Irish and Scottish Columban churches had begun to go their separate ways. The Irish churches continued in federation under the headship of Kells, and subsequently of Derry, retaining a prominent role in the country until the mid-twelfth century. In Scotland, while individual churches retained their dedications to Columba, organizational unity does not seem to have prevailed. But Iona, although no longer at the hub of a far-flung Columban world, still managed to survive as a monastic centre, as a hallowed place of pilgrimage, and as a burial-place of kings, in this last capacity perhaps down to the end of the eleventh century. The Columban monastery was replaced by a Benedictine abbey about 1203, while in modern times the foundation of the ecumenical Iona community in 1938 has underlined the island's continued standing as a holy place. 
The longevity of his monastic enterprise ensured that Columba's name remained prominent for centuries in the insular ecclesiastical world. Yet his reputation as a holy man was as important as his reputation as patron of influential churches. The composition by an Irish poet of the eulogy known as the 'Amra' testifies to Columba's immediate post-mortem acclamation as a dweller of heaven. Moreover, the life of Columba compiled by Adomnan, ninth abbot of Iona, illuminates the record of Columba's sanctification within his own community in the century after his death. Reminiscences from contemporaries, collected as formal evidence in the abbacy of Segene (623-52), appear to have formed the content of Iona's first hagiographical work, the 'Liber de virtutibus sancti Columbae' by Cummene, abbot of Iona from 657 to 669. 
These early reminiscences, now known only through the incorporation of Cummene's work into the life of Columba, reveal the conviction that Columba's sanctity imbued all the deeds of his life. Thus, instead of spectacular miracles, mundane happenings were seen to take on the hue of the supernatural. Some decades later Adomnan's work presents a portrayal more in keeping with the norms of Latin hagiography. The text reveals its familiarity with, for instance, Sulpicius Severus's account of Martin of Tours and Evagrius's translation of the life of Antony. Its three books, detailing prophecies, miracles, and supernatural revelations, highlight manifestations which liken Columba to the great holy men of Christendom. It would appear that Adomnan, whose own career as churchman and royal intermediary extended through Dal Riata, Pictland, Northumbria, and Ireland, was concerned that his patron's sanctity should be acknowledged in ecclesiastical circles far beyond Iona. 
The life of Columba documents practical realizations of devotion to him in the century after his death. Adomnan himself recalls the Iona community's liturgical use of the saint's tunic and books to invoke his intercession against drought and contrary winds. The hagiographer asserts also that prayers to Columba were instrumental in his own assistance. Moreover, the life provides evidence of popular, as well as of monastic, devotion to Columba, recounting how certain brigands were protected during enemy attack by songs sung in Irish in praise of the saint. The survival of two seventh-century vernacular poems of this sort reinforces the view that Columba's cult was widely established in his homeland at an early date. 
Indeed, literary evidence of Columba's posthumous reputation comes mainly from Ireland. There is continuity with his earliest memorials, in so far as books and writing figure prominently. Medieval Irish legend linked the saint's departure from Ireland with his having surreptitiously copied a book belonging to St Finnian, and thereafter roused his kinsmen to battle in defiance of the judgment of King Diarmait mac Cerbaill that 'to every cow belongs her calf and to every book its copy' ('Betha Colaim Chille', 178). Having been commemorated by a vernacular poet in the 'Amra', Columba came to be viewed as a patron of poets and their defender against banishment from Ireland. Moreover, he was himself claimed as a poet. Not only were Latin hymns such as the Iona-composed 'Altus prosator' fathered on him by the eleventh century, but from that time onward a considerable amount of verse in Irish became associated with his name. The themes of exile and of prophecy are prominent. As Ireland and Scotland had grown politically apart, so Columba's life in Iona was reinterpreted as a painful isolation from a homeland lovingly remembered and revisited only in imagination. The focus on prophecy in the life probably set the tone for the saint's prophetic role through which warnings of impending disaster were channelled down through the centuries. 
After Adomnan's life of Columba the only significant conventional work of hagiography was an austere twelfth-century vernacular life, the product of an era of ecclesiastical reform, which drew on that earlier life and eschewed legend. In the sixteenth century, however, as an act of 'pietas', Manus O'Donnell, a Donegal chieftain of Columba's lineage, directed the production of 'Betha Colaim Chille', a vernacular life which encompassed every available earlier memorial of the saint from the seventh century. Its wealth of anecdote and verse provides the most eloquent testimony to the continuing vitality of Columba's legend and cult throughout the thousand years after his birth. 
It is appropriate that Manus O'Donnell should have chosen to celebrate his patron in a book, since written works not only bear witness to Columba's reputation but also constitute his most famous memorial objects. The 'Cathach', now in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, is a late sixth-century copy of the 'Psalms', said to have been written by the saint himself. It had been enshrined and was venerated in Columba's native Cenel Conaill territory. Being identified with the illicit copy which provoked the battle of Cul Dreimne, the manuscript used to be borne around the host of the saint's kinsmen as they went into battle. The 'Book of Kells', 'the great gospel of Colum Cille', now in Trinity College Library, Dublin, seems to have been begun in eighth-century Iona, perhaps in celebration of the bicentennial of Columba's death. It was brought to Kells, Iona's daughter house, probably in the ninth century, and was venerated there until the seventeenth century. As the illumination of the gospel book combines motifs of Celtic, north British, and Christian design, it reflects and commemorates the Christian unity forged by Columba across the Irish Sea. 
While we have no formal hagiographical works about Columba after the seventeenth century, the saint remained the subject of legend and folklore both in Ireland and in Scotland. Modern folklore indicates that down to recent decades he featured in traditional tales and religious sayings as a hero-figure, protector, or divine intermediary. His memory is also preserved to this day in church dedications and place names on both sides of the Irish Sea. Yet such survivals do not, in themselves, testify to a living cult. It would seem that his native Donegal is the most significant remaining place of continuous preservation of his religious commemoration. In the valley which bears his name, Glencolumbkille, in the south-west of the country, Columba's feast day, 9 June, is still marked by the performance of the 'turas' (literally 'journey'), in which pilgrims process along a designated route, offering prayers and seeking the saint's intercession. Alongside rare survivals of age-old devotion are contemporary refashionings of the saint. The modern Iona community may be seen as articulating Christian ideals in accordance with contemporary needs, thereby linking the island's religious past with present exigencies. Columba has also been refigured as a romanticized prototype of a lost 'Celtic Christianity', and therefore as embodying ideals missing from mainstream Christianity. Yet the saint's legacy has not been confined to the sphere of religion. The symbolic significance of Columba's career has been acknowledged in the naming of the 'Columba Initiative', a transnational initiative for the promotion of closer cultural links between Ireland and Scotland, inaugurated in 1997, the year of the celebration of the 1400th anniversary of the saint's death. Indeed, the diverse manner of celebration of this anniversary witnessed to the plurality of modern appropriations of Columba. While there were traditional and innovative religious ceremonies, the commemoration was also encouraged by secular interests, promoting cultural co-operation, conferences, heritage centres, and travel. In the modern quest for Columba's legacy, sightseeing features alongside pilgrimage, and transinsular political and cultural links draw on the symbolism of the founder of a religious institution whose influence spanned the Irish Sea.

Columbanus (d. 615), missionary and monastic founder, was born in the Irish province of Leinster. 
Traditionally Columbanus's date of birth has been assumed to be somewhere about the year 543, though the reliability of this is questionable, since it was established on the basis of a reference in a poem whose former attribution to the saint is now in serious doubt. The first date that can be established with some certainty is that of his arrival in Gaul. In a letter probably written in 603 he remarks that he has spent twelve years in Gaul, which would mean that he arrived in 590-91. According to his biographer Jonas, Columbanus was by then twenty years of age; in some manuscripts this was changed to thirty years, which seems closer to the mark. Columbanus might therefore have been born somewhere about 560-70, though an even earlier date cannot be excluded. 
Thanks to Jonas, much is known of Columbanus's life. Jonas was from Susa, and entered the monastery of Bobbio three years after Columbanus had died there. Not only did he have access in Bobbio to people who had known his subject, he also travelled with Amandus to visit other monasteries founded by Columbanus, in order to gather information for his literary works. His life is the main source of information for Columbanus's youth; Columbanus's own extant works add to Jonas's tale only for his later life. 
Although her name is unrecorded, Columbanus's mother plays a significant role in the life; his father is not mentioned once. As is customary in saints' lives, Jonas starts his story with a premonition of the child's future greatness. He records how Columbanus's mother while pregnant had a dream in which a radiant sun came out of her body to light the world that had been lying in the darkness of a silent night. It was explained to her that this signified that the child she was bearing would be a man of such great talents that he would be of much help, not only for his own salvation, but also for that of his fellow men. According to Jonas, Columbanus's mother took charge of her son's education, in the course of which he was instructed in grammar and the liberal arts. This suggests that she was of some social standing. It was also his mother who tried with all her might to prevent her son from leaving his parental home to take up the monastic life. She stood in the doorway to obstruct his departure, but broke down before her son's determination. With one big step he then leapt over his crying mother and over the threshold, never to return again. 
Columbanus is said to have been an attractive young man. Lascivious girls fell in love with him, but he defended himself with the sword of the gospels, because he did not want his studies in grammar, rhetoric, geometry, and Holy Scripture to have been in vain (as Jonas explains with another hagiographical topos). An unnamed anchoress induced him to take up the monastic life. His first teacher was a certain Sinilis, maybe Mo Sinu (or Sillan), who at that time may have been a teacher in one of the daughter houses of Bangor (Down), of which monastery he later became abbot. Under his supervision Columbanus apparently wrote a commentary on the psalms, and 'several other works that were useful in chant and instruction' (Jonas, 69). Thereafter he entered the monastery of Bangor under its founder abbot, Comgall. After a number of years the characteristically Irish inclination towards pilgrimage ('peregrinatio') made itself felt, and he asked the abbot for permission to leave the monastery. Comgall reluctantly gave his consent and let Columbanus go, together with twelve companions. 
Columbanus and his followers arrived in Brittany about 591. From there they went to Frankish Gaul, where, according to Jonas -- who certainly exaggerated in order to highlight his hero's achievements -- Christian life had sunk to a very low level. The ascetic life of these foreign monks apparently so impressed the Merovingian king (of uncertain identity) and his entourage that they enabled Columbanus to found the monastery of Annegray, some 10 miles east of Luxeuil-les-Bains in Burgundy. This community grew steadily because of its attraction to members of Merovingian aristocratic families. In a few years it had become so overcrowded that it was necessary to found a new community in the neighbourhood: the monastery of Luxeuil. This foundation was sponsored by a grant from King Childebert II. Again this house attracted a great multitude of monks, so that yet another foundation, that of Fontaines, 5 miles north-west of Luxeuil, became necessary. Jonas tells that the community of Fontaines numbered some sixty monks, while the three houses together counted two hundred and twenty monks. The precariousness with which their inmates maintained a bare subsistence in these communities seems to be reflected in Jonas's concern with questions of food shortages and in his accounts of miracles which relieved the monks. Following the Irish custom, Columbanus ruled these three houses in person. 
From the moment of their foundation Columbanus's monasteries appear to have enjoyed immunity from episcopal interference. Columbanus may even have brought a monastic bishop with him, for in one of his letters he refers to the altar in Luxeuil that was blessed by the holy Bishop Aid. Aid may have been one of his early companions, since the name is clearly a form of the Irish Aed, unless Columbanus is referring to a portable altar that he took from Ireland after Aid had blessed it. Foundation charters of these monasteries have not survived, but other monasteries in the Columbanian tradition received written monastic immunities. Nevertheless, Columbanus came into conflict with the Frankish episcopacy over the Irish method of calculating the date of Easter. During this controversy he appealed to Pope Gregory the Great in a fascinating, self-conscious letter, probably dating from the year 600, in which he challenged the pope to abandon the fifth-century Victorine calculation in favour of the Irish one that he attributed to Anatolius. In a letter from 603 to the bishops assembled in Chalon-sur-Saone to discuss the case, his tone was much more yielding. The pressure on him, including a threat of banishment, had become so great that he now wanted to be left in peace to follow his own customs. Other differences of opinion may also have played a role, since Columbanus in this letter stressed the different vocations of secular clerics and monks. When the bishops remained hostile, Columbanus again appealed to the pope, this time probably to Gregory's successor Sabinian, whose name he did not yet know. Again he asked to be left in peace and for permission to observe the customs of his fatherland, especially since he still considered himself to be in his homeland ('in patria'), an expression which possibly refers to some sort of monastic immunity. 
Notwithstanding these difficulties with local bishops, Columbanus remained in royal favour until 609-10. According to Jonas, King Theuderic II of Burgundy, the southernmost of the three kingdoms which comprised the Merovingian realm, was very pleased to have a man of such renown in his kingdom and invited him to court. On one such occasion Brunechildis, the king's grandmother, presented the king's sons to the holy man for a blessing. But the saint refused this, apparently because the children had not been born in lawful wedlock. Theuderic and Brunechildis urgently needed legitimate heirs, so Columbanus's staunch refusal posed a significant threat to their authority. Jonas particularly blames Brunechildis for the conflict, depicting her as a second Jezebel, while the king seems to have been more cautious. Columbanus broke off all contact with the royal court and Theuderic retaliated by banishing Columbanus from his kingdom and commanding him to return to his native country. The holy man, however, refused to leave his monastery, whereupon the king's men tried in vain to force him into exile. In the end Columbanus yielded, not to force, but out of compassion for the king's men, who would have been killed if they had not succeeded in their task. At least, that is how Jonas describes this episode, in which Columbanus's power and determination are highlighted. 
Columbanus's banishment from Burgundy did not mean the end for his foundations. Some of his followers remained behind, while another group followed him. According to Jonas, only the foreigners were expelled, while the indigenous monks were allowed to stay. In a consolatory letter sent to the brethren he left behind, Columbanus hints at some disagreement among his followers, which may have caused some of his monks to flee to the Austrasian court. 
Columbanus was taken to Nantes in Brittany, where Bishop Soffronius and Count Theudald were to ensure he departed for Ireland. While Jonas holds a miracle responsible for the fact that Columbanus did not, in the event, sail away, in his consolatory letter Columbanus suggests that he was urged to flee. He then turned to King Chlothar II of Neustria (the western Merovingian kingdom), who tried to persuade him to settle in his kingdom. For reasons which remain obscure, Columbanus declined this offer. The motives Jonas provides, namely that Columbanus foresaw trouble between Chlothar and the Austrasian king, Theudebert, on his account and wanted to continue his pilgrimage, do not seem very convincing. Travelling via Meaux and Ussy-sur-Marne (where he blessed the aristocratic children Burgundofara, Dado, and Ado, who would later found monasteries in the Columbanian tradition), Columbanus arrived at the court of Austrasia (the eastern Merovingian kingdom), where he met some of his former monks who had come there as refugees. Since King Theudebert II received him with due respect, Columbanus offered to settle down in the ancient city of Bregenz, on Lake Constance, to Christianize the neighbourhood. He miraculously interfered with an apparently pagan beer-offering, in which, however, Christians also seem to have participated; he condemned this practice in his penitential. But, according to Jonas, Bregenz did not appeal to Columbanus and he subsequently travelled to Italy, leaving his disciple Gall behind, probably after a quarrel, as Gall's biographies suggest. 
In Italy, Columbanus was received honourably by the Lombard King Agilulf and in Milan he preached against the Arians and took sides in the Three Chapters controversy (a dispute arising from a condemnation of Nestorian heresy issued by the emperor Justinian) against Pope Boniface IV. Finally, he founded a new monastery at Bobbio, on the River Trebbia in north-west Italy, where he died on 23 November 615. 
While some of Columbanus's writings are still extant, some have been lost, and others attributed to him are of dubious authenticity. Among the first group, the letters are the most personal. Six letters have survived, three addressed to popes: one to Gregory the Great, one probably to his successor Sabinian, and one to Boniface IV. A fourth letter is addressed to the Frankish bishops who assembled at Chalon-sur-Saone to discuss the Easter question; another is written from Nantes to his disciples who had remained behind in Luxeuil; and the sixth is a letter of instruction addressed to an unknown pupil. The letters seem to have been collected at Bobbio, possibly by his biographer; a manuscript containing all six was available there in the seventeenth century, but has since been lost. Only the sixth letter, addressed to the anonymous disciple, has been preserved in manuscript form, since it was transmitted in combination with his sermons and penitential. 
Columbanus's penitential, a handbook intended as a manual for hearing confession and assigning an appropriate penance for each sin, has also only been preserved in manuscripts from Bobbio. The work documents Columbanus's adherence to the Irish custom of secret penance, which in this form had previously been unknown on the continent. In Gaul up to that time penance had normally been a public affair, to be administered by the bishop only once in a lifetime. In Ireland, in contrast, the monastic custom of devotional confession had been extended to the clergy and laity; and this structure is nicely reflected in Columbanus's penitential, which is divided into three parts: one devoted to monks, one to secular clerics, and one to the laity. This Irish form of penance was repeatable and could be administered by a simple priest, and perhaps even by monks. Although Irish customs differed in this respect from continental ones, the introduction of this new form of penance does not seem to have aroused any controversy, not even at the Council of Macon of 626-7, where the former Columbanian monk Agrestius attacked Columbanus's teachings. From Jonas's life it seems that the medicine of penance ('penitentiae medicamenta') was particularly attractive to the population in Gaul. Columbanus made extensive use of older insular works of this genre, such as the penitential of Finnian. 
Columbanus's 'Regula coenobialis' is a sort of monastic penitential prescribing penances for sinful behaviour by monks. It goes into considerable detail, providing the appropriate penance for scratching on the table with a knife, for not blessing the spoon, or for losing crumbs of food. Penances consist mainly of corporal punishment, psalm singing, and fasting. The ritualism of this rule was criticized by Agrestius, but apparently the bishops assembled at Macon saw nothing irregular in it. The 'Regula coenobialis' shows striking similarities to early insular penitentials by Columbanus and others; it was even called a penitential in one ninth-century manuscript. Columbanus's 'Regula monachorum', on the other hand, is a totally different kind of text. It is a moral treatise concerned with an exposition of monastic virtues, among which those of obedience, silence, and fasting seem to be of paramount importance. Apart from some provisions regulating daily worship, the text contains no practical regulation whatsoever. 
The textual history of these rules and of the penitential is rather complicated. They seem to have been freely abridged or enlarged as seemed appropriate, and it is not always clear which parts were originally written by Columbanus or reflect his actual teaching, and which were added later. Nevertheless, these texts can be said to stand in the tradition of Columbanian monasticism. This is not so clear with the thirteen sermons attributed to Columbanus. 
The authenticity of the sermons has been questioned on the basis of a passage in which the author speaks of Faustus, bishop of Riez in the fifth century, as his teacher. The two do not coincide chronologically, which would seem to rule out Columbanus as author of this text and therefore of the whole collection of sermons. However, early medieval rhetorical conventions appear to have permitted referring to a dead person as one's teacher. The collection seems to have been intended as a coherent series of sermons to be used for a monastic audience. Their emphasis on trinitarian matters suggests that they might have been written in Milan, where Columbanus condemned Arianism and took sides in the Three Chapters controversy. The strong moral content of the sermons is similar to the tenor of his 'Regula monachorum'. The manuscript tradition strongly suggests a Columbanian origin, and parallels with the poem known as 'Carmen de mundi transitu', which is generally accepted as a genuine work by Columbanus, strengthen this supposition. Stylistically the sermons would fit nicely with what is known of Columbanus as an author, while the sources used in them point in the same direction. The fifth sermon, a short tract on the miseries of the human life, had a wider circulation than the rest, and was particularly associated in manuscripts with Columbanus's monastic rules. 
The attribution of poems to Columbanus has been hotly disputed. The editor of his collected writings included five poems as written by him, but of these only the 'Carmen de mundi transitu' is now regarded as being from his hand. A case has been made, however, for the three poems addressed to Seth, Hunaldus, and Fidolius; the first of these might be Columbanus's disciple Gall, who seems to have been known by this nickname. The hymn 'Precamur patrem' in the antiphonary of Bangor could also be the work of Columbanus, written before he left Ireland, as it seems to conform to the intricate stylistic features of which Columbanus made ample use. 
Columbanus is also said to be the author of a commentary on the psalms, which has probably been lost. The same fate awaited his work against Arianism and on the Three Chapters controversy, written while in Milan. From his letters it is clear that parts of his correspondence, in particular with the papacy, have also been lost. Two short tracts 'De homine misero' and 'De VIII vitiis principalibus', though usually counted among the dubious works of Columbanus, stand a good chance of being authentic. 
Columbanus is regarded as the instigator of Hiberno-Frankish monasticism, in which Irish monastic vigour was soon taken up by Franks. His immediate successors in Luxeuil and Bobbio, for example, were Franks. Many monasteries in Gaul followed Columbanus's rule in combination with the rule of St Benedict, and possibly other monastic regulations, as exemplified, for example, by the rules of Donatus and Waldebert. Perhaps it was from such foundations that the rule of St Benedict reached England. Columbanus's penitential was also influential mainly in combination with other texts. His injunctions form the basis of the so-called 'simple' Frankish penitentials, in which they were combined with canons from Frankish councils. These texts were in turn incorporated in compilations that added material from the penitential of Theodore of Canterbury and that of the Irish abbot Cummene Fota. Columbanus's cult did not spread far beyond the monasteries he had founded, Luxeuil and Bobbio, and the foundation of his disciple Gall, the abbey of St Gallen in Switzerland. His literary remains, almost without exception, come from these places, where they were apparently well preserved. It was also in Bobbio that Jonas wrote his life to honour this vigorous monk, and to keep alive the legacy of a man who was, in his own words, a 'dissenter whenever necessary' (Walker, 56).

Colvile, George (fl. 1556), translator, is said by Anthony Wood to have been a student at Oxford University, but his name appears in none of the university records. He may perhaps be identified with the physician George Coldwell of Northamptonshire. This Coldwell was granted conditional permission to graduate MB at Cambridge in 1542 after nine years' study and practice in London and elsewhere. He is next noticed on 29 January 1558, when he was licensed to practise by the College of Physicians. By 1596 he was living in Northampton, where he appears to have died about 1612. 
Colvile was responsible for a translation of Boethius's 'De consolatione philosophiae' into English prose. This translation was first printed in London by John Cawood in 1556. Wood and Thomas Tanner record editions of 1561, 1566, and a further undated edition, but if these editions were ever printed, it appears that they are no longer extant. Colvile's translation was not printed again until it was published by the Tudor Library at the end of the nineteenth century. His version was made directly from Boethius's Latin, from 'a very old prynt' according to the title-page. Cawood printed the translator's Latin text in his inner margin alongside the English, while the commentary runs in the outer margin. Colvile's translation is generally accurate and his prose clear. He sometimes resorts to parenthetical expansions of the text, some of which go beyond Boethius's meaning. This technique is most apparent in his prose renderings of Boethius's verse interludes, where he explains the poetic metaphors. The slight marginal commentary details mythological references, briefly points the moral, or simply indicates the subject treated. Colvile dedicated his 'rude' translation to Queen Mary ('Consolation', ed. Bax, 4). His dedicatory letter takes as its theme 'mens sana in corpore sano', a factor which provides some slight support for the identification of the translator with the Northamptonshire physician.

Colvile, Sir James William (1810-1880), judge in India, was born on 12 January 1810 in London, the eldest son of Andrew Wedderburn (died 1856), of Craigflower and Ochiltree, Fife, and his wife, the Hon. Louisa Mary Eden (died 1858), daughter of William, first Baron Auckland (1744-1814). His father, who assumed the surname of Colvile on 22 June 1814, was the founder of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Eden Colvile (1819-1893), governor of Rupert's Land from 1849 to 1852, was his younger brother. 
Colvile was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1827 and graduated BA in 1831, ranked third in the second class of mathematical honours, and MA in 1834. He was an intimate friend at Cambridge of Monckton Milnes, afterwards Lord Houghton. Admitted to Inner Temple in 1832, he was called to the bar in Hilary term 1835, and for ten years practised as an equity draftsman in chambers in Lincoln's Inn. He became a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1866. 
In 1845 Colvile was appointed advocate general of Bengal. He was young for the post, but at least ten other nominees had turned it down in the wake of a discomforting row in the House of Lords over the unscrupulous readiness of the East India Company's directors to appoint their dependants to such lucrative situations. Colvile's own links with India were not insignificant; his uncle George Eden had been governor-general from 1835 until 1841. In 1848 he was raised to the bench as a puisne judge of the supreme court of Bengal and was knighted (9 December 1848) and in 1855, in succession to Sir Lawrence Peel, he was appointed chief justice. On 3 April 1857 in Calcutta Cathedral he married (Frances) Elinor (1838-1919), eldest daughter of John Peter Grant, of Rothiemurchus, a future lieutenant-governor of Bengal and governor of Jamaica. 
Colvile acquired a reputation in Bengal as a learned and courteous man, helpful and friendly to his juniors. He was an active president of the Asiatic Society and opened relations between it and the Royal Society, of which he afterwards became a fellow. He retired from the chief justiceship and returned to Britain in 1859. With the youthful Lady Colvile's care, his London residence at 8 Rutland Gate, Hyde Park, was soon established as a small but select salon, patronized by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Robert Browning, Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot), J. A. Froude, Mrs George Grote, Frederick Leighton, John Millais, Alfredo Piatti, and George Frederic Watts. In April 1875 he was elected FRS. Colvile, however, never retired from legal work. Soon after his return from India he was sworn a privy councillor to act, with Sir Lawrence Peel, as an Indian assessor to the council's judicial committee. In November 1865 he was made a member of that committee, and in 1871, under the 'Judicial Committee Act', he was appointed one of its four paid judges (at an annual salary of $5000) who were charged with clearing the backlog of appeals to the privy council. He was the senior of these judges when he died suddenly, on 6 December 1880, at his house, 8 Rutland Gate, Hyde Park, London. He was buried on 11 December 1880 at his estate, Craigflower, near Dunfermline, Fife, of which county he had been a JP and deputy lieutenant. He was survived by his wife; their only child, Andrew John Wedderburn, born in 1859, had died in 1876. In recollection of Colvile, Alexander Kinglake wrote that, even in youth, he was thought of as 'the true model of the sterling, the wise, the highly-bred English Gentleman' (Kinglake to Lady Colvile, 7 Dec 1880, Strachey MSS, BL, Add. MS 60633, fol. 90).

Colvill, Alexander (1699/1700-1777), non-subscribing Presbyterian minister, was probably born at Newtownards, co. Down, where his father, Alexander Colville (died 1719), was ordained minister on 26 July 1696. He originally spelt his name Colville but changed it to Colvill about 1715. He graduated MA from Edinburgh University in 1715 and studied medicine at Glasgow University; he graduated MD from Edinburgh in 1728. His father, who in 1700 became minister at Dromore, co. Down, was an early member of the Belfast Society and successfully introduced New Light ideas to the congregation. When he died, on 1 December 1719, the Dromore congregation wanted Colvill to succeed as minister and delayed filling the post until he was qualified. He duly studied theology at Edinburgh, under William Dunlop, and after briefly working as tutor in the family of Major Hay of Parbroath he was licensed by the Cupar-Fife presbytery on 19 June 1722. Called to Dromore, he was refused ordination in 1724 by the Armagh presbytery, because he refused to renew his subscription to the Westminster confession. He appealed to the sub-synod and then to the general synod but finally resorted to going to England, where in December 1724 he was ordained in Edmund Calamy's vestry by Joshua Oldfield, leader of the London non-subscribers. 
On his return to Ireland the Armagh presbytery refused to receive Colvill. He appealed to general synod, which in June 1725 suspended him from ministerial duties for three months and sent a replacement minister to Dromore, despite threats from Calamy to withdraw the 'regium donum'. Colvill had earlier, on 29 March 1725, applied for admission to the non-subscribing presbytery of Dublin and was duly installed at Dromore on 25 October 1725. The subscribers in the Dromore congregation immediately called a new minister, who was ordained in May 1726, but the majority (over 400 heads of families) adhered to Colvill. In 1730 he and his congregation transferred themselves to the non-subscribing presbytery of Antrim, which had been expelled from the synod in 1726. A new meeting-house was built for him on Pound Hill, Dromore. On the outbreak of the Jacobite rising of 1745 Colvill obtained from Lord Chesterfield a commission for raising a volunteer corps, which he himself commanded. He published only a few works; the first was the sermon that he preached at the funeral of fellow non-subscriber Thomas Nevin of Downpatrick, on 24 March 1745. In 1749 he attacked the seceding ministers from Scotland who were seeking to recruit new adherents from Ulster congregations in a pamphlet entitled 'The Persecuting, Disloyal, and Absurd Tenets of those who Affect to Call themselves Seceders', in which he accused them of antinomianism. He returned to the subscription controversy in his final work, 'Some Important Queries' (1773), defending John Cameron against the criticisms of Benjamin McDowell. Some years earlier, in 1759, Colvill had led a delegation of non-subscribers to propose reconciliation to the general synod, and a dialogue between the two was resumed in 1768 when Cameron was moderator of the general synod. 
According to his will (dated 3 October 1772) Colvill had a son, Maturin, and five daughters, two of whom married. He died, of apoplexy, at Dromore on 23 April 1777, aged seventy-seven, and was buried there on 4 May. His funeral sermon, 'On the immortality of the soul', was preached by James Bryson, who eulogized his 'rich, clear, and comprehensive understanding' (Bryson, 154). His congregation returned to the general synod after his death but left it with the remonstrants of 1829.

Colville, Alexander (d. 1597), judge, was the second son of Sir James Colville of Easter Wemyss (d. 1540) and his second wife, Margaret Forrester (died in or before 1562). Under his parents' marriage contract of 21 May 1536 Colville received an annual allowance of $100, but in May 1562 he renounced this in return for payments totalling 1000 merks. In February 1567 he received a charter of the abbey of Culross, succeeding his uncle William Colville as commendator. On 12 May of that year he was present when Queen Mary announced before the court of session that she had not married Bothwell under duress. In December 1571 Colville became a lord of session, and about the same time he began collecting decisions of the court of session. Between 1570 and 1572 he attended the national conventions which successively elected the earls of Lennox, Mar, and Morton as regent. On 20 January 1574 he was authorized to pay only 100 merks for the thirds of the benefice of Culross, a substantial reduction from the 500 merks which the kirk commissioners had originally required him to remit. From November 1575 he sat as a privy councillor. In November 1578 he was appointed to the parliamentary commission to review the laws of the realm, and at the same time he acted as an arbitrator in the Gordon-Forbes feud. 
Colville subscribed to the 'Defence of the king of Scots' as a supporter of the Ruthven raid in August 1582, and when that regime collapsed in June 1583, to be followed by a royalist reaction, he became for a time less involved in government. He ceased to collect session decisions in 1584, and in May and June 1585 temporarily vacated the bench in favour of his nephew John Colville, the chanter of Glasgow. But with the return of the Ruthven exiles he again became active in public affairs, serving as one of the lords of the articles (4 December 1585) -- as a privy councillor in at least sixty sessions from December 1585 to December 1596, and on four conventions of estates between 1588 and 1596. On 6 March 1590 he was made a commissioner to enforce anti-Jesuit legislation for the shires of Clackmannan and Kinross, and in 1592 he was named to a commission to reform hospitals. With his wife Nicholas ['sic'], daughter of Alexander Dundas of Fingask, he had nine children. Alexander Colville died in May 1597.

Colville, Alexander, 'de jure' third Lord Colville of Culross (1595/6-1666), college head, was born in St Andrews, Fife, the eldest son of John Colville (died 1645x50) of Culross and later of Wester Cumbrae and his wife, Elizabeth Melville (fl. 1599-1631), daughter of Sir James Melville of Halhill, and the grandson of Alexander Colville (d. 1597) of Culross. He was educated for the ministry, but on 30 June 1619 left for France, where his family had connections with the Reformed church. He immediately obtained appointment as master in Hebrew and physics at the protestant academy in Sedan. Eight years later, on 31 May 1627, he also obtained the chair of philosophy, and the following December started teaching theology with a salary of 300 livres. He became a doctor in theology on 6 November 1628. His 'Theses de natura logicae', dated 24 July 1629, was published that year. On 27 September 1631 Colville married, in Sedan, Anne le Blanc de Beaulieu, daughter of Louis le Blanc de Beaulieu, minister, and Charlotte Cappel, whose brother was a minister and professor of theology at the academy of Sedan; they had at least three sons and two daughters. 
In or before 1642 Colville received an invitation to take up a post at St Andrews. About the same time his father resigned Wester Cumbrae in his favour, and he was granted a crown charter of these and other lands on 8 March 1642. It is not clear when he returned to Scotland, but he was finally appointed to a chair of divinity at St Mary's College, St Andrews, in 1647. On 23 June 1648 he was appointed to a similar chair at Edinburgh but was not admitted; the general assembly finally refused his transfer in 1650. In 1654 he succeeded as third Lord Colville, following the death without legitimate heirs of his kinsman James Colville of Culross, but he never used the title, perhaps partly because of the competing claims of James's sons. 
At an unknown date Colville almost certainly returned to France, as he was apparently teaching in Sedan in 1656, when Jacques de Vaux praised him as being a clever philosopher, a subtle logician, and a methodical master, whose expression was brilliant and accurate. While Colville's eldest son, John, was educated at St Andrews, and became a regent there, his son Abraham ('b'. 1638) read his thesis at Sedan under the presidence of his uncle Louis le Blanc de Beaulieu on 19 November 1657 and obtained the chair of theology at the academy from 1658. Colville himself was again in Scotland in 1662, when he became principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews. In 1663 he received parliamentary ratification of all his lands because 'he had remained a loyal and peaceful subject during the troublous times preceding the Restoration' ('Scots peerage', 2.551). In 1665 he settled lands at Lurg and Kincardine on his son John, now a minister at Midcalder, in connection with the latter's marriage (contract 20 October and 4 November 1665) to Mary, daughter of Sir George Preston of Valleyfield. Colville died in January 1666, aged seventy. He was survived by his wife, Anne (died in or after 1670), his sons John (died 1670/71) and Abraham (who died in Sedan in March 1673, a few weeks after marrying Madeleine Desreumaux), and his daughter Sarah (alive in January 1681); a son and a daughter had died in St Andrews in June 1664. John's son Alexander (1666-1717) became 'de jure' fifth Lord Colville.

Colville, Sir Charles (1770-1843), army officer, second son of John Colville, eighth Lord Colville of Culross (1724/5-1811), and his wife, Amelia (died 1788), 'nee' Webber, was born on 7 August 1770. He entered the army as an ensign in the 28th regiment on 26 December 1781, but did not join until 1787, the year he was promoted lieutenant. In May 1791 he was promoted captain into the 13th (Somersetshire) light infantry, with which he remained nineteen years, until he became a major-general. He joined it in December 1791 in the West Indies, and remained with it until its return to England in 1797, seeing much service in the interval, especially in San Domingo, and being promoted major on 1 September 1795, and lieutenant-colonel on 26 August 1796. He then commanded the 13th in the suppression of the Irish uprising of 1798, and in the expedition to Ferrol, and to Egypt in 1800 and 1801. In Egypt the 13th formed part of Major-General Cradock's brigade, and distinguished itself in the battles of 8, 13, and 21 March, and in the siege of Alexandria. On leaving Egypt, Colville, who had there established his reputation as a good regimental officer, took the 13th to Gibraltar, where he remained until 1805, the year he was promoted colonel. After a short period in England he went with the 13th to Bermuda in 1808, and in 1809 he was made a brigadier-general, and commanded the 2nd brigade of Prevost's division in the capture of Martinique in that year. 
On 25 July 1810 Colville was promoted major-general, and at once applied for a command in the Peninsula. In October 1810 he took over the command of the 1st brigade of the 3rd division, which was under the command of Picton. It was now that he had his great opportunity, and he soon became not only Picton's trusted lieutenant, but one of Wellington's favourite brigadiers. He commanded his brigade in the pursuit after Massena and in the battle of Fuentes d'Onoro, shared the superintendence of the trenches with Major-General Hamilton at the second siege of Badajoz, commanded the infantry in the affair at El Bodon on 25 September 1811, and the 4th division in the place of Major-General Cole in the successful siege of Ciudad Rodrigo. He shared the superintendence of the trenches in the third and last siege of Badajoz with generals Bowes and Kempt, and commanded the 4th division in the storming of the Trinidad bastion, where he was shot through the left thigh, and lost a finger of his right hand. He had to go to England for his cure, and thus missed the battle of Salamanca, but returned to the Peninsula in October 1812, and commanded the 3rd division in winter quarters until superseded by the arrival of General Picton. He commanded his brigade only at the battle of Vitoria, where he was slightly wounded, but was specially appointed by Wellington to the temporary command of the 6th division from August to November 1813, when he reverted to the 3rd division, which he commanded at the battles of the Nivelle and the Nive. He was again superseded by the arrival of Sir Thomas Picton, but in February 1814 Wellington appointed him permanently to the 5th division in the place of Sir James Leith. With it he served under Sir John Hope in the siege of Bayonne, and superintended the final embarkation at Passages of the last British troops left in France. 
Colville's services were well rewarded: he received a cross with one clasp, and was made KCB in January, and GCB in March 1815; he was appointed colonel of the 94th regiment in April 1815; and following Bonaparte's return from Elba, he was made a local lieutenant-general in the Netherlands at Wellington's special request, and took command of the 4th division there. Colville's division was posted on the extreme right of the English division at Hal during the battle of Waterloo. To compensate him for not being more actively engaged there, Wellington gave him the duty of storming Cambray, the only French fortress which did not immediately surrender. He succeeded with the loss of only thirty men killed and wounded. 
Colville married, on 16 February 1818, Jane, eldest daughter of William Mure of Caldwell, Ayrshire; they had six children. Colville did not again see active service. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1819, and was commander-in-chief at Bombay from 1819 to 1825, and governor of Mauritius from 1828 to 1832. He was promoted general on 10 January 1837, and died on 27 March 1843 at Rosslyn House, Hampstead. His eldest son, Charles John Colville (1818-1903), who succeeded as eleventh Lord Colville of Culross, was created baron (1885) and Viscount Colville (1902) in the peerage of the United Kingdom.

Melville, Elizabeth (fl. 1599-1631), writer, was the daughter of Sir James Melville of Halhill (1535/6-1617), privy councillor and author of memoirs, and Christine Boswell. Elizabeth married John Colville, who became commendator of Culross in 1597 until 1609; he appears to have become a minister in the parish of Culross until his death. She had three sons: Samuel Colville, who sustained the literary preoccupations of the Melville family -- he was the author of 'The Scots Hudibras, or, The Whig's Supplication'; James Colville; and Alexander Colville, who became professor of divinity at St Andrews. The date of her death is unknown, but she may have died in 1640, or possibly later. 
Elizabeth Melville's life and art are inextricable: the spiritual homiletic voice of her major work, 'Ane Godlie Dreame' (first published by Robert Charteris in 1603), is mirrored in her probable vocation as a preacher; her faith was publicly manifest in political gestures of support for exiled and excommunicated presbyterian ministers such as William Ridge of Adderny, John Welsh, Robert Blair, and John Livingstone. 'A Sonnet Sent to Blackness to Mr John Welsch, by the Lady Culross' ('c'.1606) confirms Melville's pragmatic faith. Welsh belonged to the faction of dissenting ministers who opposed the ecclesiastical reforms of James VI and I. At Aberdeen in July 1605 Welsh was accused of treason; from the Tolbooth in Edinburgh he was sent to Blackness on 26 July of the same year. Melville's poem communicates spiritual support and courage to a religious ally. 
Melville's life is largely recreated through witnesses in the Calvinist and covenanting communities. In the early 1600s Livingstone's autobiography refers to 'the lady Culross' as an exemplar of 'sundry gracious Christians who used to resort to my father's house [that of William Livingstone, minister at Monyabrook], especially at times of, the communion' (Livingstone, 'Memorable characteristics', 346). In 1599 the protestant minister Alexander Hume dedicated his 'Hymnes, or, Sacred Songs' to Melville, his 'sister' in Christ and 'a Ladie chosen of God to bee one of his saincts' ('Poems', 3). Hume instructs the young woman to sustain and nurture her vocation as a spiritual daughter, and praises her 'compositiones so copious, so pregnant, so spirituall' (five years before the publication of her major work). Hume's adoration of Melville's affective piety, 'sighing & weepinge... in murmuring and in paine' (ibid., 3-4), is echoed in the much later account of Melville at a devotional meeting in Shotts in June 1630: 'William Ridge of Adderny coming into the room, and hearing her have great motion upon her, although she spake not out, he desired her to speak out, saying, that there was none in the room but him and her woman... She did soe, and the door being opened, the room filled full. She continued in prayer, with wonderfull assistance, for large three hours time. (Livingstone, 'Memorable characteristics', 347)' It seems that she may have received formal spiritual instruction, according to Livingstone, from 'the godly and able ministers and professors of Scotland' ('Brief historical relation', 138). 
Melville's faith is enshrined in her own extant letters to Livingstone and to her son James. The former, written 'c'.1626-31, convey her anxiety that the minister communicate with her regularly; she confesses her own fragility at times (through events in her family and the parish), yet exhorts Livingstone in a powerful, scriptural prose to have courage throughout the period of his excommunication in Ireland: 'mak gude that new covenant', she urges (Livingstone, 'Memorable characteristics', 364). Her letters serve as meditations on her relationship with God, the nature of suffering and endurance through devotion, as well as the earthly trials afforded by her errant son at court. 
Melville's 'Ane Godlie Dreame', composed 'at the request of friends', reflects medieval and Renaissance conventions of female spiritual 'autobiography', but is an allegory moulded by the doctrinal exigencies of Melville's Calvinism. Structured literally and metaphorically as a pilgrimage or journey, the poem depicts the visitation of Christ, who leads the dreamer through a variety of physical trials; on wakening, the dreamer expounds the allegorical significance of the journey. Melville's language is a complex weave of scriptural quotations, while the intimacy of faith is embodied in the dreamer's relationship with Christ, guide and bridegroom. The number of reprintings of Melville's poem throughout the seventeenth century, and its Anglicization, attest its popularity. Melville's life affords insight into a spiritual community, and the role of women within that; she stands as one of the most important religious writers in Renaissance Scotland.

Colville, Sir James, of Easter Wemyss (d. 1540), administrator, was the eldest son of Robert Colville of Ochiltree (died 1513) and his wife, Elizabeth Arnot (died in or before 1528). Though associated with his parents in tenancies of crown lands in 1505, he was probably still a minor when his father died at Flodden. Two kinsmen then occupied the house of Ochiltree, claiming this was 'for the weile of the said Elizabeth and James, and that utheris thair ill willaris suld nocht have entres tharin' (Hannay, 3). Colville was appointed to his father's office of director of chancery before 31 October 1518. Having agreed to replace Robert Barton as comptroller, he tried to back out, but finally took up office on 13 August 1525. His comptrollership was marked by financial crises and threats of resignation; despite close association with the Douglas-dominated regime, he survived its fall in 1528 and was made custumar of Edinburgh. On 10 August that year he agreed with the treasurer to supply the royal household for the following year, but in February 1529 he petitioned to be released from office and was replaced by Barton. 
On 10 March 1529 James V confirmed Colville as director of chancery for life and appointed him to the council, with a place in exchequer and session. On 13 December 1530 he exchanged his barony of Ochiltree with Sir James Finnart for the barony of Easter Wemyss in Fife. His judicial position as a lord of session was made permanent in May 1532 when he became a senator of the new college of justice. He was knighted between then and June 1533 and was one of the commissioners sent to Newcastle to negotiate the truce with England. 
When Barton's second term as comptroller left him ruined financially, James V turned again to Colville, who took office on 9 September 1530. Under his management the crown revenues increased, though, as James reached adulthood, so did spending on the royal household. The position deteriorated after the king's marriages in 1537-8, and by September 1538 Colville's excess expenditure had reached $2667, which was to have been repaid from the tax for the king's expenses in France. Instead Colville was dismissed following the revelation that he had assisted Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie, charged with treason in 1528. Himself charged with treason, Colville fled to England, but he returned in July 1539 to submit to the king's will. On being threatened with imprisonment in August 1540 he again went to England, where he died before 4 December. On 14 March 1541 sentence of forfeiture was pronounced against him and his heirs. His barony of Easter Wemyss and other lands were annexed to the crown, along with lands owned by others who had fallen victim to James V's vengeance or greed. After the king's death the forfeiture was rescinded on 12 December 1543, and on 1 February 1545 his illegitimate brother William Colville, commendator of Culross, was appointed comptroller. 
James Colville was twice married. His first wife, Alison Bruce (died in or before 1536), is said to have been a daughter of Sir David Bruce of Clackmannan. He married second (by contract dated 21 May 1536) Margaret Forrester (died in or before 1562), sister of David Forrester of Garden. He had a son and a daughter from each marriage. The elder son, James Colville, who succeeded to Easter Wemyss on reversal of the forfeiture, was the father of the first Lord Colville of Culross. The younger, Alexander Colville, succeeded his uncle William as commendator of Culross in 1567. There were also two illegitimate sons, one of whom, Robert Colville of Cleish (died 1560), was the ancestor of the lords Colvill of Ochiltree.

Colville, John (1542?-1605), conspirator and Church of Scotland minister, was born in Scotland, the second son of Robert Colville of Cleish (died 1560) and Francesca (died 1591), daughter of Patrick Colquhoun of Drumskeath. He was educated at St Leonard's College, University of St Andrews, where he graduated MA, probably in 1561. He was probably then aged about nineteen. He entered the ministry and by 1567 held the parsonage and vicarage of Kilbride in Clydesdale. Two years later he was confirmed as chantor (precentor) of Glasgow, while in 1571, as representative of the archdeacon of Teviotdale, he took part in the election of a new archbishop there. In 1574 Colville was recorded as minister of the united parishes of Kilbride, Torrens, Carmunnock, and Eaglesham, where his stipend extended to $200 (from which he had to pay for readers in each of his parishes). Frequent complaints were made about him in general assembly, and from 1575 to 1579 he was periodically exhibited for non-residence and neglect of his parishes. In 1580 it was stated that 'he was presently at the point of excommunication' (Thomson, 'Acts and Proceedings', 451) and by 1584 he had been removed from the chantory of Glasgow. 
Colville simultaneously developed interests outside the church: in 1572 he married Janet Russell, with whom he had at least three sons and two daughters; he maintained a household at Stirling and lands (held of his cousin James Colville of Easter Wemyss) at Strathrudie in Fife; in November 1578 he was appointed master of requests for life with an annual pension of $200 (his father had been master of the household for James Stewart, later Regent Moray); and in March 1581 he was described as 'pedagogue to the Earl of Mar' ('CSP Scot.', 5.649). Although he was frequently employed on royal business, he was one of the most consistent suppliers of information to Queen Elizabeth's government concerning the political affairs of Scotland during the last quarter of the sixteenth century. 
Following the arrest of James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, in December 1580, Colville attached himself to the discontented protestant faction. He was stripped of his office of requests in March 1581 -- it was claimed he had obtained it 'sinisterlie and surreptitiouslie' (Livingstone and others, 8.31) -- and subsequently took part in the Ruthven raid in August 1582. A manifesto issued in vindication of that enterprise (published as 'Ane declaration of the just and necessar caussis moving us of the nobilities of Scotland, and utheris, the kings majesties faithful subjectis to repair to his hienes presence and to remane with his etc, directit from Striviling, anno 1582') is normally attributed to him. When James VI removed himself from the control of the Ruthven regime in July 1583, Colville obtained licence to pass overseas for three years (except to England or Ireland). Ignoring his licence, he retired to England and was consequently forfeited in parliament, whereupon his offices were again declared vacant. After the earl of Arran had been driven from court in November 1585, Colville returned to Scotland in the company of Lord John Hamilton and was pardoned. Restored to royal favour he resumed the style chantor of Glasgow, and instructions were issued for the payment of the arrears of his pension as master of requests; this was a relief to Colville, who constantly was short of funds (and was stated to have been owed 5400 merks by James and the state). On 2 June 1587 he was admitted as a senator of the college of justice in place of his uncle, Alexander Colville, commendator of Culross (fulfilling a royal promise made in November 1582). However, after less than three weeks he resigned his seat in Alexander's favour. Also in 1587 Colville attended parliament as commissioner for the burgh of Stirling and was employed as collector of the taxation granted to James for his forthcoming marriage. He also accepted a number of pension payments from England on behalf of James VI. Despite all these offices and responsibilities, Colville was still owed money by James in the early 1590s. 
On 27 December 1591, in the company of Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell, Colville attacked Holyrood Palace with the intention of seizing Chancellor Maitland, whom he hated. Colville had been involved in the earl's affairs since at least 1584, and in June 1592 was forfeited in parliament for this association. Undeterred, he attended Bothwell on the latter's raid against Falkland Palace at the end of June, and at some point composed a sympathetic tract, 'De causa Comitis Bothwellii' (now lost). On 24 July 1593, however, Colville accompanied Bothwell to Holyrood Palace where both fell on their knees and craved pardon for their offences before the king. Despite a brief return to favour, on 11 December in the same year the two men were declared outlaws. Colville led one of the earl's divisions of horse against royal forces at the so-called raid of Leith in early April 1594, but later in the year severed connections with the earl when Bothwell allied himself with the Catholic faction. On 13 September Mar purchased a pardon from the king for Colville, who by 4 December had 'laid open as much as he knows of the manner of the carriage of all matters with Bothwell' ('CSP Scot.', 11.492). Still trusted by his former allies, in February 1595 Colville assured Bothwell's natural brother, Hercules Stewart, of his life, but on meeting with him betrayed Hercules to the government authorities and to execution. This action secured him greater royal favour, but discredited him in the eyes of his countrymen, and he had to seek sanctuary in Holyrood Abbey after Bothwell threatened to kill him. 
With his sponsor Mar, Colville looked to benefit from the death of Chancellor Maitland in 1595: it was hoped that he might become secretary (a position he had held briefly upon his recovery of favour in autumn 1593) or at least keeper of the great seal. These plans came to nothing, and in July 1597 Colville was in the Netherlands 'with his Majesties good liking, under his hand and Great Seall for his lawfull affairs' ('CSP Scot.', 13.54). James's pleasure cooled a year later, when he found out that Colville was still deep in correspondence with England and had even 'kissed hands' with Elizabeth. An angry king alleged that any licence Colville possessed had been stolen. Whether Colville ever revisited Scotland is uncertain. In 1599 he was in London in a state of destitution, offering his services in vain to Robert Cecil. Leaving his wife in England, he withdrew to France and arrived at Paris in February 1600. During his continental exile Colville was reconciled to Bothwell and like him renounced protestantism. With a view to inducing his countrymen to follow his example, he wrote his 'Paraenesis ad ministros Scotos super sua conversione' (1602). He also made a pilgrimage to Rome. Two years earlier he had published his 'Palinode', which he represented as a refutation of a former work of his own attacking James's title to the English crown. His previous argument that James was a bastard had much offended the king. He now caused a copy of his recantation to be forwarded to King James, who received it with great satisfaction. It was reissued in 1604. Spottiswoode, however, asserts that Colville was not the author. Colville wrote several other political works and has traditionally been cited as the most likely author of the 'Historie of King James the Sext'. This attribution is now considered uncertain and open to doubt. There has also been some doubt over his death: although it was formerly claimed that he died while on pilgrimage to Rome in 1607, it is now accepted that he died in Paris in November 1605.

Colville, William (d. 1675), Church of Scotland minister and university principal, was from Cleish, Kinross-shire, and was the brother of Sir Robert Colville of Cleish. He appears to have graduated MA from St Andrews University in 1631 and was ordained to the ministry and appointed to his first charge at Cramond, near Edinburgh, in 1635. Shortly after the covenanting revolution he was translated to Trinity College, Edinburgh, to which he was presented by the town council of Edinburgh on 14 January 1639 and admitted soon after. Colville was chosen to act in the capacity of emissary from the covenanting regime to the United Provinces and to Louis XIII of France. In particular he was entrusted with soliciting Dutch and French backing against Charles I and his royalist followers. In 1641 he took part in church discussions designed to end the controversy over private meetings for worship. He was translated to and inducted as pastor of the Tron Kirk, Edinburgh, in December that same year. 
Colville's defence of the engagement led to his suspension from the ministry by the general assembly in July 1648 and deposition on 26 July 1649. He left Scotland and was soon called to the ministry of an English congregation in Utrecht. Not bereft of admirers in the Scottish capital, in April 1652 he was chosen by the town council to be principal of Edinburgh University. However, his appointment was opposed by the ministry and was vetoed by the protectorate government in Scotland. On 8 November 1654 the synod of Lothian restored him to the ministry and the following year he was admitted to the charge of Perth. 
Colville remained at Perth until, in 1662, he was appointed principal of Edinburgh University. As principal he is best remembered for initiating a series of administrative and legislative articles designed to improve student discipline and facilitate learning. He was the author of 'Refreshing Streams' (1655), 'Ethicam Christianam' (1670), and 'The Righteous Branch' (1673). His pamphlet, 'Submission to the censures of suspension and deposition exemplified in the case of the Very Reverend Mr William Colvill, sometime one of the ministers of Edinburgh, and afterwards principal of the college there. From authentic and unquestionable vouchers', was published posthumously in 1734. Colville was married twice, first to Marion Brisbane, with whom he had four sons and a daughter, and second to Marion Fyfe, with whom he had a son. He probably died in Edinburgh in late May 1675, for he was buried there on 3 June.

Colvin, John Russell (1807-1857), administrator in India, second son and fourth child of James Colvin, of the mercantile house of Colvin, Bazett & Co. of London and Calcutta, and his wife, Maria, 'nee' Jackson, was born in Calcutta on 29 May 1807. He was educated at St Andrews University (1819-21), and, after a short time with a tutor in Hampstead, highly distinguished himself as a student at the East India College, Haileybury, where he won eleven prizes and was ranked first in the leaving class of 1825. In that year he went to Bengal as a writer, and spent a year studying the principal Indian languages at Fort William College, Calcutta. 
Colvin's first appointment, in September 1826, was as an assistant in the 'sadr' (chief) civil and criminal court in Calcutta. The following year he was appointed second assistant to the resident at Hyderabad; serving there essentially as a collector, he became conversant with land revenue questions. In January 1831 he became an assistant secretary to the judicial and revenue departments in Calcutta, and in March 1835 he became secretary of the 'sadr' board of revenue, Lower Provinces. This post was something of a plum, and carried a significant salary. It also brought him to the attention of the governor-general, Lord Auckland, and in 1836 he became Auckland's private secretary, a post he held for six years. Colvin had Auckland's entire confidence, and in consequence has often been held responsible for leading Auckland into his disastrous involvement in Afghanistan; however, the driving force behind the policy to prop up Shah Shuja at Kabul in place of Dost Muhammad was actually Sir William Hay Macnaghten, Auckland's chief secretary for foreign affairs. When Auckland retired in 1841 Colvin took a three-year furlough. He had earlier married Emma Sophia, daughter of Wetenhall Sneyd, vicar of Newchurch, Isle of Wight; with her he had ten children, among them Sir Auckland Colvin. 
In 1845 Colvin was appointed resident at the court of Nepal, and in 1846 commissioner of the eastern Tenasserim provinces. In 1849 he was promoted to the 'sadr' court, where he showed remarkable judicial acumen, despite his lack of formal legal training. He succeeded his friend James Thomason as lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces in 1853. Considered an able and active administrator, his seniority assured his promotion. In this office he showed great mastery of the details of government, and learned much from his collectors on cold weather tours. All departments, including criminal justice and police, came under his purview, as well as the application of the revenue system to the previously unsettled Saugor and Nerbudda territories. He also promoted road building, and under his rule the Ganges Canal was completed. Colvin presided over the grand opening of the canal in 1854. He pursued the scheme of primary education introduced by Thomason until Charles Wood's education dispatch of 1854. It was sometimes said that he over-governed, concerning himself with minute details and overburdening his secretaries. 
When the Indian mutiny broke out in May 1857 Colvin appeared to be in a very perilous position. Unlike John Lawrence in the Punjab, Colvin had no warning of the insurrection; when he heard that the rebels had taken Delhi, he acted promptly and vigorously. He held a parade of the troops, at which he tried to calm their fears, and on 24 May he offered a pardon to all soldiers under his jurisdiction who had been involved in the disturbances, provided they had committed no serious crimes. This proclamation was disavowed by Lord Canning, the governor-general, and despite an able defence of his position, Colvin had to modify his terms. On 1 June he disarmed the two Indian regiments at Agra, and replaced them with volunteer forces to protect the city. He strengthened the fort and made arrangements for the reception within its walls of the entire Christian population of the cantonment and city (about 6000 people), including the Christian village of printers that had been organized by the Church Missionary Society at nearby Sikandra. An indecisive skirmish with the now mutinous regiments on 5 July ended with the retreat of the British forces into the fort just as their opponents had exhausted their ammunition and were on the point of retiring. Much criticized for his handling of the affair, Colvin suffered his first collapse immediately before his entry into the fort. He was transferred to the cantonments, where he died on 9 September 1857; he was buried in the fort the next day. His collapse and eventual death appear to have been caused by physical and nervous exhaustion. Announcing Colvin's death, Canning described him as 'one of the most distinguished among the servants of the East India Company' and praised his 'ripe experience, his high ability, and his untiring energy'.

Colwall, Daniel (d. 1690), merchant and philanthropist, has an obscure family background, and nothing is known about his early life. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 16 January 1661, and was a council member (1663-86 and 1689) and treasurer from 1665 to 1679 ['see 'Founder members of the Royal Society]. He became a vice-president of the society in 1682. 
During his long, influential period as treasurer, Colwall helped the society to survive its frequent financial difficulties. Fellows were reluctant to pay the weekly subscription of a shilling. In 1667 and 1673 the council instructed Colwall to require members to pay their subscriptions, but in vain. In 1667 the arrears approached $1000 and in 1674 $2000 when only 53 of the 146 fellows paid regularly. 
In 1663 and 1666 Colwall presented the society with $50 on condition that he was not exempted from his weekly subscriptions; and the council decided that these sums should be expended to purchase 'the collection of rarities belonging to Mr Hubbard', which was the beginning of the society's museum. Colwall himself presented gifts including 'an Arabian stone to provoke wine' and 'a piece of wood good for green wounds' and spoke on such subjects as 'making vitriol' and 'ordering oysters at Colchester' (Birch, 1.20, 41; 4.178). 
In 1681 Nehemiah Grew published 'Musaeum regalis societatis', dedicated to Colwall, who paid for the engravings. Grew hoped that the society 'may always wear this Catalogue, as the miniature of Mr. Colwall's abundant respects near their hearts' and added 'Besides the particular regard you had to the Royal Society itself, which seeming (in the opinion of some) to look a little pale, you intended, hereby, to put some fresh blood into their cheeks; pouring out your box of oyntment not in order to their burial, but their resurrection. (Weld, 1.278)' The other philanthropic cause Colwall supported was Christ's Hospital, the charitable school in London of which he was long a governor. As such he was a member of the court, the supreme body of the hospital, and regularly attended its meetings and served on the general committee hearing cases and petitions. He was present on 27 March 1683 for the visitation of the mathematical school, grammar school, and reading and writing school. In 1678 the court accepted his offer to give the hospital $1000 provided the court would pay him $50 a year in half-yearly instalments. 
Samuel Pepys, who became secretary of the Admiralty in 1672, was worried by the inadequate supply of skilled sailors as navigators and encouraged Charles II to establish in the hospital the royal mathematical school. Colwall made a gift to it, though the hospital doubted whether the king would agree to any augmentation of his establishment, but the king's reply was 'so far was he from disliking this that he would be glad to see any gentleman graft upon his stock' (Trollope, 2.560). In 1676 Colwall took the charge, an admonition then given by the court to enable him to nominate a child for admission to the hospital, and in 1684 he presented a child to be admitted to the school. 
In Colwall's will, proved on 20 November, he bequeathed to the hospital 'for ever one rent or yearly payment of sixty-two pounds and eight shillings issuing and payable out of the hereditary excise which was assigned to me by Sir Robert Viner, knt. and bart. deceased', and the sum of $4000; besides supplementing the salary of master of the grammar school by a life annuity of $20. 
The court set up a committee to consider how Colwall would have wished the $4000 to be used. They decided, first, that it should assist the children sent to two places in Hertfordshire after the London fire of 1666 since 'he did generally approve of making such a kind of reception for the nurses and children at Hertford as has been lately made at Ware'; and, second, to make 'a new Writing School in the Hospital'. They asserted, 'We think ourselves bound both in gratitude and for transmitting the memory of so bountiful a benefactor as also for the great usefulness of the things themselves' (Christ's Hospital general committee minutes, 1687-98, fols. 224, 229, 243). 
In 1670 and again in 1673 Colwall was recorded as living in a house with twelve hearths in Tower Hill East in the liberty of the Tower of London, the inhabitants of which, after being sworn and registered by the steward of the Tower court, became 'free men of the Tower'. This absolved them from jury service at assizes and county sessions and exempted them from the jurisdiction of the City of London and county of Middlesex. Its inhabitants were expected to support their own poor; and after Colwall's death in November 1690 in the liberty, his will made generous provision for the poor there.

Colyear, David, first earl of Portmore (bap. 1657, d. 1730), army officer, was baptized on 1 April 1657 in Brabant, the eldest of the four children of Sir Alexander Colyear, first baronet (died 1680), and his wife, Jean, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Walter Murray. Sir Alexander was apparently of the family of Robertson of Strowan, Perthshire, but with his father took the name Colyear and settled in the Netherlands, where he saw military service and acquired considerable property. David Colyear entered the army of William of Orange as a volunteer in 1674 and served as an officer in his father's regiment in 1676. Later he was promoted major. He succeeded to his father's baronetcy in 1680, and in January 1683 became lieutenant-colonel in Mackay's regiment. In the 1670s or 1680s he married Arnolda de Beyer (died in or before 1696) of Nijmegem. Colyear lost the sight of his right eye in 1687 during a duel with Sir Peter Fraser. At the revolution he accompanied William to England and in late December 1688 was promoted colonel in command of Wauchope's regiment. He served in William's Irish campaigns (1689-91) and in October 1691 was appointed governor of Limerick. He was promoted major-general in June 1696. For his distinguished service in Ireland and in Flanders he was created a peer of Scotland, as Lord Portmore and Blackness, on 1 June 1699. 
About August 1696 Colyear married his second wife, Catharine Sedley (1657-1717), the daughter of Sir Charles Sedley of Southfleet, Kent, and formerly the mistress of James II. She had been created countess of Dorchester for life in 1685, and received a substantial official pension. They had two sons. In 1702, at the commencement of the War of the Spanish Succession, Colyear was recommissioned major-general and served in the expedition to Cadiz and the attack on Vigo Bay. On 13 April 1703 he was raised in the peerage, as earl of Portmore. He was promoted lieutenant-general in February 1703, and the following year he held the command of the forces in Portugal for a short period. In 1710 he succeeded Lord Galway as commander-in-chief of the forces in Portugal, and in January 1711 was raised to the rank of general. In 1712 he served under the duke of Ormond in Flanders, was sworn of the privy council, and was made a knight of the Thistle. In August 1713 he was appointed governor of Gibraltar, and in October 1713 was chosen one of the sixteen representative peers of Scotland. In April 1714 he was appointed to the command of the Royal North British Dragoons (the Scots Greys), which he retained until February 1717. 
However, disenchantment with the accession of George I led Portmore to dabble in Jacobite politics. Before the earl of Mar raised his standard at Braemar in September 1715 Bolingbroke attempted unsuccessfully to bring Portmore over to the Jacobite side. Further efforts were made by Mar during the rising to turn Portmore's regiment, the Scots Greys, but without success; the regiment, under the acting command of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir James Campbell, was to play a key role in the suppression of the rising down to its last remnants in 1719. However, Portmore maintained and increased his Jacobite connections, providing military advice for a possible landing in England in 1716 as well as financial support. He relinquished the colonelcy of the Scots Greys in February 1717 as part of a move towards further involvement in the Jacobite cause. Rumours began to circulate among Jacobite leaders that he was preparing to leave England for the continent. In late July 1718 he travelled to the Netherlands to meet Sir Henry Patterson, who reported to the earl of Mar that Portmore: 'was resolved, as soon as he returned to England, to disengage himself entirely of all engagements with the Elector of Hanover and the English ministry... for he says he has no satisfaction in England, where the discontents are general and particularly with the nobility and he spoke with great contempt of both the Elector and his son and said he thought the Restoration could not fail was there the least foreign resistance. ('Stuart Papers', 7.113)' However, Portmore did not sever his connections with the Hanoverians, and in the fullness of time he came to an accommodation with them. 
When Gibraltar was besieged by Spain in 1727 Portmore embarked to assume command there. He arrived in April 1727 and saw the siege raised in June. He died at his family seat at Weybridge, Surrey, on 2 January 1730, and was buried there on 13 January. John Macky described him thus, at the age of about fifty: 'He is one of the best foot officers in the world; is very brave and bold; hath a great deal of wit; very much a man of honour and nice that way, yet married the Countess of Dorchester, and had by her a good estate; pretty well shaped; dresses clean; but one eye.' Portmore's eldest son predeceased him; the second, Charles Colyear (1700-1785), succeeded as second earl. A great patron of the turf and a conspicuous figure in London, in his youth the second earl was known as Beau Colyear. The peerage became extinct on the death of the fourth earl in 1835.

Colyngham, Thomas (fl. 1387), Cistercian monk and theologian, is said by the early seventeenth-century Scottish antiquary Thomas Dempster to have attended the University of Paris about 1387, and to have gained a doctorate, presumably in theology, and then to have entered the Cistercian order. While at the university he is reported to have composed a treatise 'De eucharistia' -- a work described by Dempster as 'serious and weighty' ('opus serium et grave') -- which was published at Paris by Johannes Cheyneus (who is otherwise unknown) from a manuscript preserved in the library of the abbey of St Victor (though it does not appear in Claude de Grandrue's catalogue of the abbey library compiled in 1514). No copy of the book is known to survive. Since Dempster's sources cannot now be verified, and since his testimony is often unreliable, Colyngham's place among Scotland's 'eruditi' cannot be regarded as certain.

Combe, Andrew (1797-1847), physician and phrenologist, the fifteenth child and seventh son of George Comb, a brewer, and his wife, Marion ('nee' Newton), was born in Edinburgh on 27 October 1797. Among his siblings was George Combe, the leading British proponent of phrenology. Although the family home was cramped and in an insalubrious location, George Comb was reasonably prosperous and able to employ servants. Family life was conducted according to strict Calvinistic principles. Andrew attended an elementary school on Frederick Street in Edinburgh, and then in October 1805 he entered the city's high school. In October 1810 he enrolled in 'the town's college', as Edinburgh University was at that time known, and spent two sessions studying Greek and Latin. While complimentary about the professor of Greek, Combe was later scathing about the quality of the Latin teaching he experienced at the university. 
At this time Combe showed no clear inclination toward any occupation, but his father was determined that at least some of his sons would rise above the stigma of being in trade and apprenticed him to Henry Johnston, a surgeon who maintained premises on Princes Street; such an apprenticeship was a necessary first step to becoming a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. According to his brother George, Andrew showed no enthusiasm for this arrangement and on his first day had to be manhandled at least part of the way to Johnston's shop. Thereafter, however, he appears to have pursued his medical studies with diligence and some success. After attending the requisite courses of lectures given by teachers in both the extramural and the university schools of medicine, he was admitted to the College of Surgeons in 1817. Later in that year he went to Paris for further professional studies, taking the opportunity also to visit Switzerland and Lombardy. Combe was obliged to spend two winters in Italy and the south of France, owing to the first onset of the symptoms of pulmonary disease. On his return to Edinburgh, Combe began in 1823 to cultivate a practice; in 1825 he enhanced his standing by taking the degree of MD at the university and he attracted a large number of patients. He obtained a number of honorary appointments, including in 1838 that of physician-extraordinary to the queen in Scotland. 
Together with his brother George, Andrew Combe became one of the foremost proponents of phrenology in nineteenth-century Britain. Initially both brothers, guided by the scornful rebuttals of phrenology that appeared in the 'Edinburgh Review', were dismissive of the new system. George's conversion occurred when Johann Caspar Spurzheim, one of the founders of phrenology, visited Edinburgh in 1815. Andrew's scepticism took longer to dispel. By his own account, 'it was only after witnessing the examination of many brains in the extensive hospitals of Paris, that I became convinced that the skull really represents the configuration of its enclosed brain' (A. Combe, 'Phrenology -- its Nature and Uses', 1846, 20). In 1820 George and Andrew Combe were among the founders of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society; and in 1823 Andrew helped to establish the 'Phrenological Journal', of which he remained a proprietor until 1837. Combe's first published article appeared in this periodical and many others were to follow. In addition, he produced a number of longer pieces expounding phrenological doctrines. Combe made ambitious claims regarding phrenology's potential for achieving social amelioration, and also maintained that it had enabled him to achieve greater self-understanding and mastery, and had helped him in his clinical practice. Moreover, according to Combe, patients themselves had come to appreciate the value of such knowledge in a physician: Combe maintained that he was much in demand as a practitioner precisely because of his phrenological expertise. Although in some quarters phrenology was associated with materialism and infidelity, Combe strenuously maintained that its precepts were altogether compatible with Christian doctrine; indeed, a phrenological understanding of human nature would enable society and the individual to practise religion more effectively. 
From early in his career Combe showed a particular interest in mental diseases. During his time in Paris he attended the lectures of the noted alienist Jean-Etienne-Dominique Esquirol as well as observing patients in the Salpetriere. In Edinburgh he was often consulted in cases of insanity or 'nervousness'. Combe maintained that mental disease was the medical field in which the applications of phrenology were most obvious. He was especially concerned about the disregard that judges and juries in Britain paid to medical evidence when deciding questions of mental competence in civil and criminal cases. In 'Observations on Mental Derangement' (1831) Combe maintained that mental disorder was in fact a 'symptom of cerebral disease', and therefore to be regarded in the same way as the diseases of any other organ. 
In 1834 Combe published 'The principles of physiology applied to the preservation of health, and to the improvement of physical and mental education'. Several portions of the work had previously appeared in the 'Phrenological Journal'; its underlying philosophy was in many ways an extension of phrenological precepts and it aimed to provide a more general understanding of health and illness. Combe emphasized the individual's responsibility for his or her own well-being and the importance of attention to corporeal needs. He dismissed the notion that Christian piety demanded a disdain for the body and an exclusive concern for spiritual edification. Instead he believed that God had created 'organic laws', which it was the duty of each person to obey; disease was the inevitable result of a neglect of these wise regulations and the great majority of human ills could be remedied if rational measures for the preservation of health were adopted both by the individual and by society. According to one contemporary, the promulgation of these ideas represented Combe's 'peculiar distinction among medical writers. He burns... to bring back the bodily economy of man to its allegiance to the Supreme Guide' (Brown, 134). 'Principles' was immensely popular both in Great Britain and in the United States, and went through numerous editions. 
Combe published two health texts for a popular audience: 'The Physiology of Digestion Considered with Relation to the Principles of Dietetics' (1836) and 'The Management of Infancy, Physiological and Moral' (1840). This was to be his last book. His chronic pulmonary complaint grew worse, and voyages to Madeira and the United States provided only temporary relief. Combe died at Gorgie, near Edinburgh, on 9 August 1847. He did not marry and had no known progeny.

Combe, Charles (1743-1817), physician and numismatist, was born on 23 September 1743 in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, where his father, John Combe (died 1768), carried on business as an apothecary. His mother was called Elizabeth. He was educated at Harrow School, and among his schoolfellows he remained on close terms with Sir William Jones, the father of comparative philology, and Samuel Parr. He rose to the sixth form but did not proceed as hoped to Oxford, on account of a brother's illness and death which compelled him to remain at home and assist his father. Having pursued medical courses in London, he took over his father's business in 1768. On 9 May 1769 he married Arthey, daughter of Henry Taylor, watchmaker, of Red Lion Street in Holborn. 
In addition to his medical studies Combe maintained an active interest in classical studies, and especially numismatics. He was elected FSA on 10 January 1771 and FRS on 11 January 1776. In 1773 he published 'Index nummorum omnium imperatorum, Augustorum et Caesarum', a listing of imperial 'large brass', including provincial issues, down to Domitian. That year, or earlier, he made the acquaintance of William Hunter, the anatomist and founder of the great coin collection now held in Glasgow. Combe's knowledge of Greek, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon coins, his eye for authenticity, and his understanding of the market, were instrumental in creating this collection. Over the next ten years he was of the greatest assistance to Hunter, not merely in acquiring desirable single coins but in valuing entire cabinets and negotiating their purchase. Having initially collected in his own right, he ceased to do so and sold his better pieces to Hunter in 1777. He also played a vital part in Hunter's scheme for a large seven-volume catalogue of the entire collection, divided according to series, each volume to be entrusted to a specialist. Combe would undoubtedly have been responsible for several volumes had the scheme been carried through; in the event only one came out, and Combe was its author. The 'Nummorum veterum populorum et urbium... descriptio' (1782), a catalogue of Hunter's Greek pre-imperial issues, was the best work of its kind produced in the eighteenth century. It has been much corrected in detail, and the illustrations, contained in sixty-eight engraved plates, are poor as works of art, but Combe took care that they should be more faithful to the coins than the illustrations in previous numismatic works, and the volume as a whole earned praise from the eminent Austrian numismatist Joseph Eckhel. In many ways it set a standard for all later coin catalogues to emulate. 
Combe was only one of several prominent antiquarians advising Hunter; his memoir of another, William Southgate, was prefaced to 'Musaeum Southgatianum', a reprint of the catalogues of the latter's library and coin collection in 1795. He was one of the three trustees appointed in Hunter's will to have care of his collection in London for thirty years, after which it was to pass to Glasgow University. Hunter died in 1783, and the trustees were happy to relinquish possession earlier than the prescribed term; in 1807 the coins travelled north under armed guard. 
Combe was also associated professionally with Hunter, and this doubtless helped him to gain the degree of MD from Glasgow University in 1784. That year he went into practice as an obstetric physician, and he was admitted licentiate in midwifery by the College of Physicians on 5 April, and nominated governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital on 30 June. In 1789 he was chosen physician to the British Lying-in Hospital in Brownlow Street, and on resigning the post in 1810 was appointed consulting physician to the same institution. He also had a considerable private practice, and assembled a library of rare medical books (sold in 1808) and a collection of 'materia medica' which was purchased by the College of Physicians shortly after his death. His collection of prints, an extensive array assembled on historical principles, with particular emphasis on mezzotints, had been auctioned in 850 lots in May 1803. 
Combe's only other numismatic publication was a contribution to an appendix in the second edition of Vertue's 'Medals... of Thomas Simon' (1780). After Hunter's death he turned his attention to classical literature, and in 1788 he began to work with Henry Homer, fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on an edition of Horace with variorum notes. Samuel Parr was also originally to have taken part in the work. Homer died before the first volume was completed, and Combe finished the work alone; it was published in 1792-3. Though the text was well edited and laid out, the copious notes were not free from errors, particularly when quoting in Greek. A severe criticism by Parr in the 'British Critic', however, went far beyond these faults by throwing doubt over Combe's judgement in selecting the notes and his faithfulness to the scheme as conceived by Homer. Combe responded with 'A Statement of Facts Relative to the Behaviour of Dr Parr' (1793) and was answered by Parr in 'Remarks on the Statement of Dr Charles Combe' (1795). 
Combe died after a short illness at his house in Vernon Place, off Bloomsbury Square, on 18 March 1817, and was buried in the cemetery for St George's, Bloomsbury, in Brunswick Square, on 24 March. His wife had died in 1799, and of their four children only two survived him; the elder was Taylor Combe (1774-1826), keeper of antiquities in the British Museum.

Combe, George (1788-1858), phrenologist, was born in Livingstone Yards, Edinburgh, on 21 October 1788, one of the seventeen children of George Comb (died 1815), a brewer, and Marion Newton (died 1819), who came from a family of tenant farmers. Combe recalled in his autobiography that the family home, at the foot of Edinburgh Castle, was attached to his father's brewery and surrounded by other manufacturing concerns: 'A more unhealthy residence can scarcely be conceived' (Gibbon, 1.2). These surroundings almost certainly account for Combe's poor health as a child and his later delicacy. Combe's parents imposed a strict Calvinist regime upon their children and, though Combe was later to reject his religious upbringing, certain aspects of the Calvinist outlook remained central to his thinking. Described as being hard, dry, cold, and as tall, puritanical, and 'dissenter-looking', 'he remained all his life within an ascetic mold, forever preoccupied with the virtues of thrift, industry, and order' (Cooter, 104). 
Combe was initially educated at the parish school of St Cuthbert's and then in 1797 he proceeded to Edinburgh high school. Here he was subjected to severe discipline which involved the liberal use of corporal punishment. While George Comb himself refrained from beating his children, he had no objection to schoolmasters' employing the tawse on them. From 1802 to 1804 Combe attended humanities classes at the University of Edinburgh. His father was anxious to see his sons achieve social advancement, and in the spring of 1804 Combe was articled to a firm of Edinburgh lawyers. After a period as a solicitor's clerk Combe was admitted as a writer to the signet, in January 1812, and began to practise as a lawyer. After the death of his father in 1815 Combe also took charge of the family brewing business for a time. 
Combe's relations with his siblings were close. His elder sister, Jean, kept house for him until her death in 1831. His younger brother Andrew Combe also shared a house with him. George and Andrew Combe became collaborators in what was to become the major enterprise of both men's lives: the promotion of the science of phrenology, with George Combe going on to play a pre-eminent role in 'phrenology's transformation from an arcane theory of brain and character to that of a socially respectable vehicle of 'progressive' ideas on social life and organization' (Cooter, 101). 
By his own account Combe's first acquaintance with the doctrines of phrenology was derived from a reading of a damning critique of the system written by John Gordon in the June 1815 issue of the 'Edinburgh Review'. Impressed by Gordon's arguments he 'regarded [the phrenologists'] doctrines as contemptibly absurd, and their authors as the most disingenuous of men' (Combe, 'A System of Phrenology', v). In 1816, however, Combe attended a dissection of the brain given in the house of a barrister friend by Caspar Spurzheim. He already had some background in the subject through following John Barclay's lectures on anatomy; such dabbling in scientific and medical subjects was not uncommon among early nineteenth-century Edinburgh lawyers. Most of Spurzheim's audience was convinced by his refutation of the criticisms that had been levelled by the 'Edinburgh Review'. Combe subsequently followed Spurzheim's lectures on phrenology. He remained in some doubt, however, about the validity of phrenology's claims until he undertook his own researches; he 'appealed to Nature by observation, and at last arrived at complete conviction of the truth of Phrenology' (ibid., vi). 
Combe's researches took the form of both the collection of numerous skull casts supposed to show to advantage the various phrenological organs, and the observation of the heads of individuals whom he encountered. He found himself increasingly asked to demonstrate to others the truths of phrenology he had gleaned by these means, 'until at length the applications for an account of the casts became so numerous that I was forced to devote certain days and hours to gratify public curiosity' (Gibbon, 1.95). Combe thus took on the role of an exponent of the doctrines of phrenology. His early informal presentations to members of his circle eventually developed into courses of public lectures in Edinburgh, Bath, Newcastle, Glasgow, Birmingham, and Aberdeen. 
For some time, however, Combe pursued this role as a teacher in parallel with his career as a lawyer, the occupation on which he still relied for the greater part of his income. Additionally, some of his best friends were alarmed 'lest I should ruin myself by espousing a cause which was the laughing-stock of all men of reputation' (Gibbon, 1.96). These fears were to prove unfounded, but such sentiments were an indication of the controversial character of the doctrine with which Combe now became associated. George Combe founded the Edinburgh Phrenological Society in 1820. 
Combe's interest in social questions led him in 1820 to visit Robert Owen's model community at New Lanark, but he remained unconvinced about its success. His brother Abram (died 1827) tried and failed with a similar experiment at Orbiston, Lanarkshire. 
Combe's status as the leading British champion of phrenology was enhanced by a series of publications. The first of these was an exposition of the 'physiognomical system' of Spurzheim and Franz Josef Gall, which appeared in April 1817. A year later Combe published in the 'Literary and Statistical Magazine for Scotland' the first of a series of essays that in 1819 were collected into a book entitled 'Essays in Phrenology'. In 1824 Combe published a further volume: 'A System of Phrenology'. Both these books passed through several editions. He was also a contributor to, and sometime proprietor of, the 'Phrenological Journal'. 
Combe's most important work was, however, 'The Constitution of Man' (1828), in which phrenology was placed in the context of a wider scheme for understanding human nature and ameliorating the human condition. The title suggested that it would be a descriptive work, providing an account of human nature. This is indeed what Combe attempted. But 'The Constitution of Man' was at the same time a prescriptive text: Combe maintained that from a proper understanding of human beings it was possible to derive a comprehensive system of not only personal but also social and political morality. 
Crucial to this transition from the factual to the normative was Combe's notion of natural law. He maintained that cause followed effect with the same inevitability in the human as in the physical realm, and that it was as futile and dangerous for an individual or a community to seek to defy the laws of human nature as it was to attempt to override the law of gravity. However, Combe claimed that until recently these laws had been imperfectly understood; it was only with the rise of phrenology that people could obtain an accurate account of human nature and thus a reliable guide to conduct: phrenology was no less than 'the greatest and most important discovery ever communicated to mankind' (Combe, 'System of Phrenology', vii). Phrenology revealed, for instance, that social inequality was part of the natural order of things. Different individuals had different aptitudes depending on the unequal development of the various cerebral organs. Individuals should therefore seek phrenological guidance when choosing a career, and employers should make use of cranioscopy when hiring workers. The phrenological doctrine of mind thus endorsed the division of labour by showing the natural basis of this economic arrangement. 
Combe was nevertheless critical of certain aspects of the capitalist manufacturing system. He maintained that it encouraged a blind pursuit of short-term profit without regard to longer-term economic and social consequences. This was because capitalists were excessively influenced by their faculties of 'acquisitiveness' and 'self-esteem'. He defended the rights of workers to form combinations to protect themselves against such exploitation. Moreover, while phrenology might seem to encourage a deterministic attitude to human endowments, Combe denied that the brains of the lower classes were noticeably inferior in size or quality to those of the upper classes. What primarily determined the difference in ability between the two was the disparity in the education of the classes. Given proper training of their cerebral equipment, he believed, there was no reason for workers not to improve their lot and rise to join the middling orders of society. 
Combe was also anxious to demonstrate the relevance of phrenology to the reform of the penal system. He opposed capital and corporal punishment and desired that prison discipline be adapted to the moral reform of the individual convict. He maintained that 'in dealing with criminals we are dealing with the 'mind'' (Combe, 'Remarks on the Principles of Criminal Legislation', 35) and that penal policy should therefore be directed towards a reform of the offender's mind rather than to taking revenge on his body. Once a criminal's mental faculties were restored by means of education and discipline to a state of proper harmony he or she would no longer be inclined to offend against the law but would become a useful member of the community. 

'The Constitution of Man' enjoyed remarkable success, going through numerous editions and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in Europe and the United States. Ironically, it was not the phrenological aspects of the work that proved most popular or had the most durable appeal. It was rather Combe's meliorist, humanitarian, and individualist message that found most resonance among nineteenth-century middle-class readers. These core ideals could be retained while jettisoning Combe's more particular doctrines. 
The book also aroused opposition in some quarters. Theologians were quick to point out that Combe's constant insistence upon the centrality of nature and natural law left little room for divine providence. Although Combe denied that he advocated atheism or materialism, these critics touched on an important point. By making nature a virtually self-sufficient source of moral law, Combe rendered the deity at most a remote being with little direct influence on human affairs. The system of rewards and punishments Combe described was of this world and determined by natural forces. 'The Constitution of Man' can therefore be seen as a precursor to later attempts to create a purely naturalistic understanding of the world and of humanity's place within it. 
On 25 September 1833 Combe married Cecilia Siddons (1794-1868), daughter of the actress Sarah Siddons. He allegedly subjected both himself and his prospective wife to craniological examination before deciding on the match. With the help of Cecilia's fortune Combe was able to retire from legal practice and devote himself to his activities as a publicist for phrenology. The couple had no children. 
Between 1838 and 1840 Combe toured Canada and the United States, seeking to propagate his views by lecturing and by establishing links with like-minded reformers. His impressions of this visit appeared in 1841 as 'Notes on the United States'. In 1842 Combe travelled to Germany, where he lectured on phrenology in Heidelberg. Due to poor health he was, however, shortly afterwards obliged to give up lecturing. He then bought a house at 45 Melville Street, Edinburgh. 
Combe continued to publish on various topics; he was, in particular, interested in questions of education policy. In a series of publications he advocated a system of national secular education. A school based on these doctrines was established in Edinburgh; its curriculum included lessons in physiology and phrenology. 
In 1847 Combe also published a pamphlet on the relations between science and religion; this was subsequently turned into a book. In this work Combe maintained that 'Science has banished from [people's] minds belief in the exercise, by the Deity, in our day, of special acts of supernatural power as a means of influencing human affairs, and it has presented a systematic order of nature, which man may study, comprehend, and obey, as a guide to his practical conduct' (Combe, 'On the Relation between Religion and Science', 6). 
Towards the end of Combe's life the phrenological movement in Britain was increasingly disrupted by schism and controversy. One faction, of which William Engledue was the chief spokesman, insisted upon a materialistic interpretation of phrenology which was favoured by political radicals. More moderate phrenologists insisted that there was no incompatibility between their science and Christianity. The Combes favoured the latter position. However, George's religious views were sufficiently heterodox for him to be denounced in Edinburgh and elsewhere as an atheist and materialist. This reputation may well have contributed to the failure of his attempt in 1836 to be appointed to the chair of logic at Edinburgh University. 
Combe suffered from ill health throughout his life. After a brief final illness, diagnosed as pleuro-pneumonia, he died at Moor Park, Surrey, on 14 August 1858, and was buried in the Dean cemetery, Edinburgh. He was survived by his wife.

Combe, Taylor (1774-1826), numismatist and archaeologist, was the eldest son of Dr Charles Combe (1743-1817), the physician and numismatist, and his wife, Arthey Taylor (died 1799). He was educated at Harrow School and at Oriel College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 18 October 1791, graduated BA on 5 June 1795, and proceeded MA on 10 July 1798. Combe joined the Society of Antiquaries in 1796 and in 1803 he obtained an appointment in the British Museum, as superintendent of the coins and medals collection. In 1807 he became keeper of the newly created department of antiquities, the coins still remaining in his charge. The following year he married Elizabeth Gray, the youngest daughter of Dr Edward Whitaker Gray. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1806, and was its secretary from 1812 to 1824, during which period he edited the 'Philosophical Transactions'. He also became the director of the Society of Antiquaries in 1813 and superintended the publication of the latter portions of the 'Vetusta monumenta'. His importance in the British Museum grew and in 1814 he was sent to Zante, to carry out the purchase of the Phigaleian marbles. 
As a numismatist and archaeologist Combe did much useful and accurate work, best represented in 'A Description of the Collection of Ancient Terracottas in the British Museum' (1810), 'A Description of the Collection of Ancient Marbles in the British Museum' (1812-20), a 'Catalogue of Greek Coins in the British Museum' (1814), and a 'Description of the Anglo-Gallic Coins in the British Museum' (1826). He also contributed many articles to 'Archaeologia'. 
Combe died after a long illness, on 7 July 1826, at the British Museum, and was buried on 14 July 1826, in the family vault in the burial-ground of St George's, Bloomsbury. His extensive library of classical and numismatic books, together with a collection of prints and some of his manuscripts, was sold by auction at Sothebys in December 1826. His premature death deprived the department of antiquities of an able curator, who had successfully organized the Towneley galleries and superintended the arrival of the Elgin and Phigaleian marbles. The next keeper, Edward Hawkins (1780-1867), proved a worthy successor who built substantially on Combe's early work.

Combe, Thomas (1796-1872), printer and patron of the arts, was born on 21 July 1796 in Leicester, the second of six children of Thomas Combe, the town's leading bookseller, and his wife, Theodosia ('nee' Dalby). He had an older sister, three younger sisters, and a younger brother. He was educated at Repton School, Derby, which he entered in August 1808. 
After Repton, Combe worked in his father's bookshop, and then moved to Oxford about 1824 to assist Joseph Parker in his new bookshop in the Turl. He lived in St Mary Hall Lane with one of his sisters, who kept lodgings. Here Combe met John Henry Newman and Edward Pusey, who lodged, briefly, in the house. Two years later Combe went into partnership with Michael Angelo Nattali, in a bookselling business at 24 Tavistock Street, London, but within a year or so he left for Leicester to take a share in his father's bookselling and printing business at Gallowtree Gate. 
In 1838 Combe joined the university press at Oxford, which was then made up of two quite separate businesses: the learned side, which printed classical texts; and the 'Bible' side, which was a commercial enterprise exploiting the university's monopoly (shared with Cambridge and the queen's printer) in the printing of 'Bibles' and prayer books. Combe began as superintendent of the learned side, a salaried post bringing a comfortable income of $450 a year. He lived in North House, one of two conjoined managers' houses in the quadrangle of the press buildings, in Walton Street, Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his life. 
After returning to Oxford, Combe renewed his acquaintanceship with Newman and through him met Martha Edwards [
In 1841 Combe bought shares in the 'Bible' business at the university press and gradually increased his holding until, in 1851, he became senior partner. He relinquished his post on the learned side to take full control of the 'Bible' business. Output and profits rose under his management; by 1853 he was receiving nearly $4000 a year in dividends, almost ten times what he had been paid for his services on the learned side. He was now a rich man. The university benefited immensely from the dividends and in 1859 conferred on Combe the honorary degree of MA in recognition of his business achievements and for furthering the interests of employees. 'Before his coming to Oxford the University chest had been... in a sick and dying condition', the public orator announced at the ceremony; 'by his honourable exertions and ceaseless labours [Combe] has revived, upheld, supported, and enlarged that chest' (OUP archives). This was not strictly true, as the press had been profitable before his arrival. Moreover, although Combe was a shrewd and energetic manager, the prosperity of the press in the 1850s was as much a product of a booming economy, and an unprecedented demand for 'Bibles', as it was of his own efforts. Combe relished the award: one observer recorded seeing him around the press in later life 'with his white beard and hair set off by a Magdalen blazer, under his MA gown' ('Clarendonian', 23, 1969, 39). 
In 1850 Combe met the young Pre-Raphaelite painters John Everett Millais and Charles Allston Collins, who were painting near Oxford. Impressed by the boyish charm of Millais, the Combes invited them to stay at their house, where Millais painted a portrait of Thomas Combe, and Collins one of Mrs Combe's uncle, William Bennett. Thanks mainly to the persuasive powers of Millais, Combe began to acquire Pre-Raphaelite paintings: William Holman Hunt's 'A Converted British Family' in 1850, and Millais's 'The Return of the Dove to the Ark' and Collins's 'Convent Thoughts' in 1851. These were acquired at a time when Pre-Raphaelite paintings were being savaged by the critics, and the survival of the movement owed much to Combe's patronage. 
The Combes met Hunt in 1851 and invited him to Oxford. It was the first of many visits: 'Hunt saw little of his family now,' his granddaughter wrote later, 'the Combes had taken their place' (D. H. Hunt, 'My Grandfather, his Wives and Loves', 1987, 92). In 1853 Combe bought Hunt's 'The Light of the World', perhaps the most famous of all Victorian paintings, for 400 guineas. Other paintings bought from Hunt include 'The School-Girl's Hymn' (1860) and a small version of 'The Afterglow in Egypt' (1861). Combe bought just one painting by Rossetti: 'Dante Drawing an Angel', purchased in 1855. 
Combe provided $3000 for a new chapel at the Radcliffe Infirmary. It was designed by Arthur Blomfield and completed in 1865. To meet the need of the growing population of Jericho, where the press was situated, Combe was also responsible for providing the church of St Barnabas. Again designed by Blomfield, this was completed in 1869 at a cost of $6500, and the church's Tractarian furnishings and rituals soon attracted huge congregations. 
Working at the press until the last, Thomas Combe died suddenly of angina on 29 October 1872. A request, supported by the prime minister, Gladstone, that Combe should, exceptionally, be interred within the walls of St Barnabas, was turned down by the home secretary, and he was buried in St Sepulchre's cemetery in Walton Street on 6 November 1872. 
Combe's wife, Martha, lived on at the press building until her death in 1893. With one or two exceptions, she bequeathed all the Pre-Raphaelite paintings -- which had been augmented by acquisitions of her own (notably Hunt's 'London Bridge by Night') -- to the university, which placed them in the Ashmolean Museum. The major exception was Hunt's 'The Light of the World', which she had already given to Keble College. The collection was one of the most comprehensive private collections of early Pre-Raphaelite art. Martha Combe died on 27 December 1893. She was buried at St Sepulchre's, beside her husband, on 2 January 1894.

Combe, William (1742-1823), writer and literary imitator, was born in London on 25 March 1742, the son of Robert Combes (died 1756), a prosperous wholesale ironmonger, and his wife, Susanna Hill (died 1748), daughter of a wealthy Quaker merchant with interests in the West Indies. William was baptized in St Alban's Church, Wood Street, London, on 16 April. He was named after his godfather William Alexander, his father's business partner. 
William matriculated at Eton College in 1752, four years after his mother's death. On his father's death in October 1756, William was withdrawn from Eton by William Alexander, now his guardian and executor of his father's will. Very little is known about Combes's life during the three years after Eton. It has been suggested that he attended Oxford University, but there is no record of this. On 22 February 1760 Combes was admitted as a bencher of the Inner Temple, but he left his chamber soon after Alexander's death on 23 September 1762, and never qualified to be called to the bar. As residuary heir to his father's estate of approximately $2500 and legatee of $2000 from his guardian's estate when he turned twenty-four years old, William had ample money and credit to conduct himself as a fashionable man about town when he came of age in March 1763. Rejecting his mercantile origins later in life, he changed the spelling of his last name to Combe and habitually signed himself 'esquire', affecting the status of a gentleman. 
Like many other young men, Combe took advantage of the end of restrictions on travel at the close of the Seven Years' War to travel to France, where the tall, handsome young man's extravagant dress and behaviour earned him the nicknames Duke Combe and Count Combe. Among those he befriended during his approximately six-month visit was Laurence Sterne, whom he also visited in England the following year. Combe seems to have exhausted his funds before 1770, spending his time from the end of 1769 to mid-1773 in France, the west midlands, and Wales, outside the fashionable circles in Paris and London. According to some accounts, he may have spent part of that time serving in the British army. He may also have spent some time at Douai, where English Roman Catholics maintained a seminary. Combe's wandering ended in 1773, when Robert Berkeley offered him the job of editing 'A Description of Patagonia', by Berkeley's chaplain, Thomas Falkner, a former Jesuit missionary. The assignment introduced Combe to his career as a writer and to the business of producing and distributing books (he saw the book through the press in Charles Pugh's Hereford printing office). 
Early in spring 1775 the local newspapers reported Combe's re-entry into fashionable society in Bath and Bristol. During the summer Combe's comic afterpiece 'The Flattering Milliner, or, A Modern Half Hour' was performed on the Bristol stage as part of a benefit for the actor John Henderson. His early friendship with Laurence Sterne also gave rise to an edition of 'Sterne's Letters to his Friends on Various Occasions' (1775) and 'Letters Supposed to have been Written by Yorick and Eliza' (1779), which were combinations of authentic and fabricated correspondence. The latter was a two-volume imitation of correspondence between the late Sterne and his recently deceased friend Eliza Draper (with whom Combe late in life claimed to have had an affair before she met Sterne). In these Sternian imitations (which included 'Original Letters of the Late Reverend Mr. Laurence Sterne, Never before Published', 1788) Combe established himself as a skilful literary imitator and prolific professional writer in various genres. He had embarked on a lifelong habit of conflating the factual and the fictional and misleading his contemporaries (as well as subsequent scholars and biographers). Although he always published anonymously, his authorship was an open secret because he frequently acknowledged it in private conversation, and in later works often included his own name on the list of subscribers. 
Combe also quickly established himself as a man of feeling and taste by publishing at his own expense a collection of sentiments in prose, 'The Philosopher in Bristol' (1775), in two separately published parts, and a topographical poem, 'Clifton, a Poem. In Imitation of Spenser' (1775). After unsuccessfully republishing his works in London, Combe attempted to recover financially by agreeing to marry Maria Foster (died 1814), the discarded mistress of Francis Seymour-Conway, Viscount Beauchamp, Combe's schoolmate at Eton, who was about to marry for the second time. Combe may have entered into a financial agreement with Beauchamp in order to protect the latter from embarrassment. Combe married Foster (who was also known as Miss Harley) on 16 May 1776; the notice in the 'Morning Post' describes Combe as 'a Gentleman who is universally known, from having distinguished himself in this, and other countries, in various shapes and characters'. Either Combe misunderstood his arrangement with Beauchamp or Beauchamp failed to pay, but by the end of the decade Combe was burdened with the expense of his wife's confinement in Stephen Casey's private madhouse in Plaistow, Essex, which may have cost him as much as $300 annually. 
The man of feeling turned satirist in revenge, producing nine verse satires in 1777 alone, with more during 1784, aimed primarily at Simon Luttrell, Baron Irnham, a notorious reprobate of the day, but also targeting Beauchamp, Beauchamp's father, Lord Hertford, his younger brother, Henry Seymour Conway, and their politically anti-ministerial circle of friends, including Charles James Fox. The first satire, 'The Diaboliad, a Poem. Dedicated to the Worst Man in his Majesty's Dominions', was a great success, earning Combe recognition as the best satirist since Charles Churchill and prompting the publication the same year of 'Additions to the Diaboliad' and 'The Diaboliad, a Poem. Part the Second'. A spate of imitations by others followed. Other poems actually written 'By the author of the diaboliad', such as 'A Poetical Epistle to Sir Joshua Reynolds', mocked various social sinners. The duchess of Devonshire was the target of several satires, among them 'The First of April, or, The Triumphs of Folly: a Poem. Dedicated to a Celebrated Duchess' (1777), 'An Heroic Epistle to the Noble Author of the Duchess of Devonshire's Cow, a Poem' (1777), and 'A Letter to her Grace the Duchess of Devonshire' (1777). The Revd William Dodd, the recently executed forger, was a subject of the prose pamphlet 'A Dialogue in the Shades between an Unfortunate Divine, and a Welch Member of Parliament, Lately Deceased' (1777). 
Between 1778 and 1785 Combe turned from poetry to prose, beginning in January 1778 with the first of a series of nine volumes over the next seven years of the pro-ministerial 'R[oya]l Register', which purported to be King George III's observations on eminent people recorded in his private notebook. That same year Combe ghost-wrote John Hunter's 'A Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth'. Combe and his publisher John Bew took advantage of the death of another Eton schoolmate, the notorious Thomas, 'the Wicked' Lord Lyttleton, in November 1779, to publish several volumes of Lyttleton's supposed letters and poems. Many contemporaneous reviewers, while noting the apparent spuriousness of these and other Combe publications, none the less praised his literary talents. Combe also published several sentimental epistolary novels: 'Letters of an Italian Nun and an English Gentleman. Translated from the French of J. J. Rousseau' (1781), 'Letters between Two Lovers and their Friends. By the Author of Letters Supposed to have been Written by Yorick and Eliza' (1781), and 'Original Love-Letters between a Lady of Quality and a Person of Inferior Station' (1784). In addition, a verse satire on Benjamin Franklin, entitled 'The Traitor', and one on the prince of Wales called 'The Royal Dream, or, The P[rince] in a Panic. An Eclogue, with Annotations' appeared, respectively, in 1781 and 1785. 
But frequent and even well received publications were not enough to keep Combe solvent. He was arrested on 18 October 1785 and imprisoned in the king's bench prison the following May for a $100 debt owed to John Palmer since 1775, when Palmer had been the manager of the Bath theatre. Palmer, now the comptroller-general of the Post Office under the prime minister, William Pitt, apparently used the outstanding debt to convince Combe to become a ministerial writer. Although Combe was not formally discharged from prison until 25 May 1787, with Palmer's help he was able to obtain his physical freedom from gaol by August 1786. Combe may also have been aided by John Walter, publisher of the 'Daily Universal Register' (renamed 'The Times' in 1788) and the Logographic Press. Either Palmer or Walter, or both, presumably paid the 10 or 12 guineas that bought Combe the privilege of living outside the prison, 'within the rules' technically restricting a debtor to the area of Southwark adjacent to the prison, so that he might come to terms with his creditors. In practice, the geographical restriction was very inconsistently enforced. Palmer and Walter were motivated by the desire to use Combe's proven writing and editing talents on behalf of their own patron, Pitt. Combe was soon contributing essays on various political and social subjects to Walter's logographic newspaper. 
Combe also worked on more substantial works for Walter's press until its closure in 1792, including its most ambitious publication, a new edition, in 1789, of the work commonly referred to as Adam Anderson's 'History of Commerce', first published in 1764. Combe researched and wrote the more than 700 pages of volume 4, which brought the 'History' up to the present, and he dedicated the work, 'by permission', to William Pitt. For the first time, Combe included his own name on the subscription list. By the end of 1788 Combe was on the Treasury payroll, earning $200 per year from Pitt for such pro-ministerial writings during the Regency crisis and in the aftermath of the French Revolution as his 'Letter from a Country Gentleman to a Member of Parliament on the Present State of Public Affairs' (1789), 'History of the Late Important Period; from the Beginning of his Majesty's Illness' (1789), and 'Word in Season to the Traders and Manufacturers of Great Britain' (1792). 
Combe was not financially dependent solely on government patronage, however. In March 1790 he published 'The Devil upon Two Sticks in England', an artistically and commercially successful satiric narrative in four volumes, with two more published the following year. Sections of this episodic novel, in which the devil Asmodeus introduces his pupil, Don Cleofas, to a survey of the full range of English society, had first appeared in Walter's 'Daily Universal Register' in 1787. 
Combe also capitalized on his success as a historian, receiving commissions to write, edit, translate, and ghost-write many other works, including his 'History of the Late Important Period' (1789), John Meare's 'Voyages Made in the Years 1788 and 1789, from China to the North West Coast of America' (1791), Aeneas Anderson's 'A Narrative of the British Embassy to China, in the Years 1792, 1793, and 1794' (1795), Charles Grant's 'History of Mauritius' (1802), and Alexander Mackenzie's 'Voyages from Montreal... to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans; in the Years 1789 and 1793' (1802). Combe's modern biographer Harlan Hamilton estimates that between his government stipend and his private commissions Combe must have been earning annually at least $500 during the early 1790s. By the end of 1794 he was living on Craven Hill, Paddington, near Kensington Gardens, and had a horse and servant. 
A major source of Combe's income came from a commission he was given in 1792, soon after Walter closed down the Logographic Press. The artists, engravers, and art dealers John Boydell and his nephew Josiah, proprietors of the Shakspeare Gallery in Pall Mall, hired Combe to write the text to accompany the illustrations engraved from the drawings by Joseph Farington, the artist and diarist, for a projected multi-volume 'The Picturesque Views and Scenery of the Thames and the Severn, the Forth and the Clyd, from their Sources to the Sea', illustrated with hand-coloured aquatints. The work progressed more slowly than the publishers had promised, with the first two (and ultimately only) volumes of the work, now renamed 'An History of the Principal Rivers of Great Britain', appearing in 1794 and 1796. Although the volumes display painstaking and time-consuming research in archival sources, Farington was probably correct in thinking that paying Combe by the week slowed the work's production: Combe received $364 for the first volume, and $200 for the second. But Combe's progress must also have been slowed by other projects he undertook at the same time. He edited Humphry Repton's 'Letter to Uvedale Price' (1794) and 'Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening' (1795) and Miss A. E. Booth's two-volume translation of C. B. E. Naubert's German novel 'Alf von Deulmen, or, The History of the Emperor Philip, and his Daughters' (1794), and wrote the anonymous 'Letter to a Retired Officer' (1796). 
The Boydell commission brought Combe into contact with the leading artists of the day, their patrons, and other celebrities he met at the gallery, as well as on his tours throughout Britain to choose scenes for Farington to sketch. For example, on his visit to Nuneham Park, home of George Simon, second Earl Harcourt, he met the famous actress Sarah Siddons. Farington records that Combe dined at various times with the artists Benjamin West and Maria and Richard Cosway, the latter one of Combe's oldest friends. Combe's portrait was drawn by George Dance in 1793 and painted by James Northcote in 1798. When George III learned from Farington that Combe was the author of the texts of 'An History of the Principal Rivers' and the 'Diaboliad', he pronounced him 'a clever man'. 
At the height of his prosperity Combe startled his friends by eloping in early 1795 with Charlotte Hadfield, Maria Cosway's sister and twenty years his junior, who had been living with the Cosways. Despite their claim to have been married on 28 January 1795, no record has been found of the marriage, which would have been illegal anyway because Combe's first wife was still alive. She died in 1814 in Casey's madhouse, and Combe paid for her burial. After living briefly in Knightsbridge, Combe and Charlotte leased a house and garden near Harrow for $40 a year. A comment Combe made later in life indicates that he and Charlotte adopted a daughter at some time before he was again imprisoned for debt four years after their elopement. Charlotte moved to Ireland shortly thereafter. Although they never again lived together, they maintained a correspondence, and always identified themselves as husband and wife. They also maintained their friendships with the Cosways, especially Maria. At Combe's death, however, the biography of Richard Cosway he promised Maria he would write was barely begun. 
Combe's financial situation declined even more rapidly than it had improved. Perhaps even at its height he had been living beyond his means. But about 1796, according to Farington, Combe's government stipend stopped, at a time of great economic stress in England because of the war with France. The Boydells were unable to continue publishing 'Rivers' because all their capital was committed to the paintings and engravings for their 1802 edition of Shakespeare. Combe scrambled to cover costs, doing hack work such as writing sermons and assisting James Colnett in producing his privately printed 'Voyage to the South Atlantic and Round Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean' (1799). He even proposed himself as a candidate for the position of professor of history in the Royal Academy in 1798, but he failed to be nominated. Debts owed to his tailor, harpsichord makers, the painter George Romney, the madhouse keeper Stephen Casey, and others, led to Combe's arrest on 4 May 1799 for just over $350. 
Hack work for both John Debrett and John Wright enabled Combe to gain permission to live again 'within the rules' by February 1800 and rent an apartment from a Mrs Ryves at 12 Lambeth Road, London. There he quickly published translations of several lengthy works to exploit popular interest in Napoleon's recent military activities: 'History of the Campaigns of Count Alexander Suworow Rymnikski' (1799, from the original by Friedrich Anthing), 'Memoir of the Operations of the Army of the Danube' (1799, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan), 'Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt' (1800, C. N. S. Sonnini de Manoncourt), 'Official Correspondence' (1800, congress of Rastadt), and 'Report of the Commission of Arts... on the Antiquities of Upper Egypt' (1800, Louis-Medeleine Ripault). 
During the same period Combe also published his 'Brief Observations on a Late Letter Addressed to the Right Hon. W. Pitt' (1801), probably hoping to regain a political patron. When Pitt was succeeded as prime minister by Henry Addington, Viscount Sidmouth, in March 1801, Combe quickly applied to Addington for employment as a ministerial propagandist, but was politely rejected with a payment of $100. Combe was re-hired, however, when Pitt resumed office in 1804 and remained on the government payroll at $200 per year until Pitt's death in January 1806, though he was never able to collect the last $100 owed him. 
Combe resumed his career as a periodical editor when Colonel Henry Francis Greville employed him to produce the weekly newspaper 'Pic Nic' in January 1803, and later that year its successor, 'The Cabinet'. Greville started the papers in response to the opposition of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, manager of the licensed Drury Lane Theatre, to private, unlicensed, theatrical performances staged by Greville's Pic Nic Society. 'Pic Nic' and 'The Cabinet' introduced the practice of unbiased drama reviewing. Besides editing, Combe also contributed pro-ministerial essays, a sonnet on Samuel Johnson, and more forged Sterne letters. By the time 'The Cabinet' folded in 1803, Combe had already been hired by John Walter's son, John Walter II, as supervising editor and sometime contributor to rescue the failing 'Times', a position he held until 1808. Combe wrote many of the leading articles, including the pro-government series of letters signed 'Valerius', subsequently collected and published as 'The letters of Valerius, on the state of parties, the war, the volunteer system, and most of the political topics which have lately been under public discussion' (1804). Among the colleagues of 'Old Combe', as he was now commonly known, was Henry Crabb Robinson, who joined the newspaper in 1807. 
Combe's duties at 'The Times' and his desire for society necessitated his frequent breaking of the 'rules' of the prison, leading inevitably to his arrest on 28 June 1808 for their violation. Until mid-1812 he was restricted by the 'day rules', which required him to return to the prison by nightfall each day. His income enabled him to afford one of the best private rooms in the prison's state house. To maintain appearances he continued to use his Lambeth Road quarters as his mailing address. 
Throughout his varying degrees of incarceration, Combe retained his wide circle of friends, including a number of much younger women. One relationship led to the somewhat embarrassing posthumous publication in 1823 of 'Letters to Marianne. By William Combe, Esq.', which contains a silhouette of Combe prefacing his sentimental and platonic correspondence between 1806 and 1809 with Marianne Brooke, a young seamstress. 
In Combe's last years most of his income came from his relationship with Rudolph Ackermann, an art dealer and publisher whose Repository of Art, at 101 Strand, rivalled the Boydells' Shakspeare Gallery. In 1809 Ackermann hired Combe to write the letterpress to accompany the last volume of the very successful three-volume 'Microcosm of London'. Thomas Rowlandson designed the figures, and Augustus Charles Pugin the architectural details. Working with Ackermann's staff of artists, Combe wrote the texts for illustrated histories, of varying degrees of reliability, entitled 'Westminster Abbey' (1812), 'York' (1813), 'Oxford' (1814), 'Cambridge' (1815), 'Colleges of Winchester, Eton, and Westminster' (1816), and 'Madeira' (1821). For other publishers he provided the letterpress for 'The Thames, or, Graphic Illustrations' (1811), 'Picturesque Views on the Southern Coast of England' (1826), and 'Pompeii' (1827). In addition Combe wrote for Ackermann's 'Poetical Magazine' (1809-11) and his 'Repository of Arts, Literature, Commerce, Manufactures, Fashions, and Politics'. 
But most importantly, Ackermann published Combe's letterpress for Rowlandson's illustrations that resulted in the series of comic poetry for which Combe is still most famous, and which earned him his best-known nickname, Doctor Syntax: 'The Tour of Doctor Syntax, in Search of the Picturesque' and its two sequels (1812, 1820, 1821), 'The English Dance of Death' (1815, 1816), 'The Dance of Life' (1817), and 'The History of Johnny Quae Genus, the Little Foundling of the Late Doctor Syntax' (1822). Combining light-hearted satire of William Gilpin's theory of the picturesque in art with a central character modelled on Cervantes' Don Quixote and Henry Fielding's Parson Adams, Combe created a lovable eccentric whose misadventures on the road structure the 'Tour'. For over a century the many editions and numerous imitations of the 'Tour' attested to the popularity of Combe's humorous hero. 
No matter how much Combe earned from his various publications, however, he always spent more. He died, still in debt, at his Lambeth Road address on 19 June 1823. The obituary in 'The Times' the next day stated that: '[h]e was a gentleman who, in the course of this protracted life, had suffered many fortunes, and had become known... to so many people in every rank of society, that it hardly seems necessary to draw his character... There was hardly a person of any note in his time, with whose history he was not in some degree acquainted.' 
'The Sun', edited by his friend John Taylor, observed that: 'The Life of Mr. Coombe ['sic'], if impartially written, would be pregnant with amusement and instruction; but those whose literary contributions might have provided interesting materials, are probably most of them with him in the grave; and he will hereafter be chiefly remembered as the Author of Doctor Syntax.' Less than two weeks before his death, at the request of Ackermann, Combe compiled a list of seventy-five titles of his works. The 'Gentleman's Magazine' published the list in 1824 and 1852. Unfortunately, Combe, who always guarded his personal history, never wrote the autobiography he had repeatedly projected. An undischarged debtor, he was buried on 22 June 1823 at the church of St George the Martyr, Southwark, just south of the king's bench prison.

Comber, Thomas (1575-1654), college head and dean of Carlisle, was born at Shermanbury, Sussex, on 1 January 1575, the twelfth child of John Comber (died 1608), barrister, and his wife, Jane (formerly Dunstall). From a public school at Horsham he matriculated as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1592 and was elected to a scholarship in the following year. He graduated BA in 1595, was elected to a fellowship in 1597, and took his MA in 1598. Subsequently he went abroad for three years and is known to have spent some time at the home of the French reformed theologian Pierre du Moulin, presumably in Charenton. His travels over, he returned to Trinity, to which he was to devote most of the rest of his life. He held office as both junior and senior dean and senior bursar; he proceeded BD in 1609 and DD in 1616. 
An outstanding scholar, Comber was well versed in Hebrew, Arabic, Coptic, Samaritan, Syriac, Chaldee, Persian, Greek, and Latin, in addition to having a colloquial knowledge of French, Spanish, and Italian, and was the author of Greek and Latin verses on the death of William Whitaker, published in 1610. A dispute with some Jesuits appears to have confirmed his rising reputation and he was invited by James I to dispute publicly at St Andrews with some Scottish divines. On 26 June 1615 he was instituted to the rectory of Worplesdon, Surrey. Presented to the deanery of Carlisle on 28 August 1629, on 1 November that year he was admitted chaplain-in-extraordinary to Charles I. The same year he married Susan Cotton, a widow, at Kingston in Cambridgeshire; they had one child, Mary. 
In October 1631, helped by the patronage of the earl of Portland, Comber became master of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself with a reputation for good scholarship and impartiality. He published some Latin letters in 1633, and is deservedly identified as one of the few who refused to side with either of the two factions which dominated the life of the university in the 1630s. None the less, the college chapel in Trinity was elaborately decorated and reordered during his mastership. He served as vice-chancellor in 1631 and again in 1636. 
During the 1640s Comber was ejected from all his preferments and imprisoned for assisting in sending the university plate to the king, and for refusing the covenant. He died in Cambridge on 28 February 1654 and was buried on 3 March in St Botolph's Church, Cambridge, without a tombstone; his wife survived him. His funeral sermon, preached in Trinity College chapel by Robert Boreman, was later published under the title of 'The Triumph of Faith over Death, or, The Just Man's Memoriall' (1654). A portrait in Trinity shows Comber with a beard and moustache, and what Trevelyan describes as kindly and jovial features.

Comber, Thomas (1645-1699), dean of Durham and liturgist, was born on 19 March 1645 at Westerham, Kent, and baptized at the parish church on 23 March, the fourth of the five children of James Comber ('bap'. 1615, died 1671), a member of the Cutlers' Company of London, and his wife, Mary ('bap'. 1617, died 1672), daughter of Brian Burton, yeoman of Westerham. Apart from Thomas, only his older brother James survived to adulthood, although Mary, a daughter by their mother's first marriage, to Edward Hamden (died 1639), also survived to maturity. Comber later made great play of the fact that he was the last child to be baptized at Westerham according to the prayer book rite before it was outlawed. His family were royalists: his maternal grandfather had had his property sequestered and his father found it necessary to flee to Flanders, only returning in 1649. These experiences no doubt cast a shadow over the life of the sickly Thomas as he grew up, lending a vividness to the many references to the horrors of the civil war which punctuate his later writings. 
At four, when he could barely walk, Comber was sent to a local elementary school, before moving on at six to the Revd Thomas Walter's school in Westerham, where he learned Latin and Greek. From 1653 he alternated between attendance at Sevenoaks grammar school and a school kept by John Evans on Tower Hill, his life being threatened by bouts of severe illness. From 1656 Comber found himself back in the much more congenial care of Walter, with whom he remained until the latter's death in February 1658. He was by then ready to go to university but his admission, to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, was delayed by a year until 18 April 1659, on the advice of William Holland, vicar of Westerham. With the encouragement of his tutor, Edmund Matthews, the senior fellow of the college, Comber's studies at Sidney Sussex were wide ranging, covering scientific subjects as well as music, painting, and oriental languages. But his time at Cambridge was only sustained with the help of a variety of charitable benefactions and, perhaps prematurely discounting his chances of a fellowship, he left in 1663, having graduated BA in January that year. 
Comber's academic career may have foundered but his clerical one took off shortly afterwards and continued at a precocious pace. He was ordained deacon on 18 August 1663, aged only eighteen, in order to help out William Holland, who had moved on from Westerham to be rector of All Hallows, Staining, but after barely six weeks, he was on his way to Stonegrave in the North Riding of Yorkshire to serve as curate there, at the behest of the absentee incumbent Gilbert Bennett. The archbishop of York, Richard Sterne, completed Comber's whirlwind induction to the ministry by ordaining him priest on 25 September 1664, an uncanonical move, given his youth, which Sterne, on his own account, never regretted. Even at this early age, Comber was a ready, almost extempore preacher, although his fame was to come from his formidable output as a liturgical writer and Church of England polemicist. Physically Comber was of medium stature, with light brown curly hair and blue eyes. 
In March 1665 Comber moved to nearby East Newton Hall, the seat of the Thorntons, a local gentry family to whom he acted as chaplain alongside his parochial duties at Stonegrave. At the end of 1666 he became domestic chaplain to Lord Freschville, a relation of Mrs Thornton, who proved a loyal patron to Comber. He maintained his close relationship with the Thornton family, courting and marrying Alice Thornton (1654-1721) on 17 November 1668, in a secret ceremony at East Newton Hall, in the face of opposition from some members of her wider family; they had four sons and two daughters. In 1669, thanks to his recently acquired patrons, Comber succeeded to the living of Stonegrave on the king's presentation in place of the incumbent, who had been persuaded to resign. 
From this secure base Comber now embarked upon his writing career. In the summer of 1672 he published the first part of what was undoubtedly his greatest work, 'A Companion to the Temple and the Closet', a detailed commentary on the 'Book of Common Prayer' designed to promote its public and private devotional use. It was to prove a massive and enduring monument: the 1841 edition ran to seven volumes, the shortest of which is 366 pages long, and it had a wide readership and influence among clergy and laity within Comber's own lifetime. It was hardly a work of detached scholarship, beginning to appear as it did while Charles II's declaration of indulgence was in force and peppered as it was with polemical asides against both Rome and protestant dissent. Nevertheless, Comber felt it necessary to indulge in more directly polemical works against these twin threats. In 1674 he published anonymously the somewhat inaptly named 'Friendly and Seasonable Advice to the Roman Catholics of England', which had its origins in conversations with Lord Fauconberg, whom certain Roman Catholics had been seeking to convert. In 1677 Comber attacked the Quakers in 'The Right of Tithes Asserted and Proved from Divine Institution' (1677), following this up with a wider attack on Quaker views, as advocated by Thomas Ellwood in 'Christianity No Enthusiasm' (1678); both were published anonymously. 
Partly through his writings and partly through his family connections (Mrs Thornton was a cousin of Lord Treasurer Danby), Comber was looked on with growing favour at court, becoming a prebendary of York in 1677 and a doctor of divinity at Archbishop Sancroft's behest in June 1678. On 11 February 1679 the combined efforts of Danby and lords Freschville and Fauconberg finally secured for Comber the living of Thornton-le-Dale, some 10 miles from Stonegrave, which Sancroft granted him a dispensation to hold in plurality. In April Comber was elected proctor in convocation for the archdeaconry of Cleveland. Finally, in May 1679, he was received at court by Princess Anne, who had read the third part of his 'A Companion to the Temple and the Closet' in preparation for her first communion (in 1682 she would make him one of her chaplains). 
With his court connections and his polemical bent, it is not surprising that Comber should go into print for the tory cause in the exclusion crisis, publishing in the summer of 1681, again anonymously, 'Religion and Loyalty Supporting each other', a tract which defended the loyal addresses then flooding into Whitehall and bitterly attacked whig constitutional and historical arguments. Next Comber turned his attention to 'the enemy within' -- those churchmen who failed to give the Church of England their full support -- clashing angrily with Gilbert Burnet on the subject of tithes, both in print and in private correspondence. John Tillotson, a long-standing friend of Comber, was among those who sought to mediate and at least when Comber published the second part of his 'Historical Vindication of the Divine Right of Tithes' in 1685 it contained no personal references to Burnet, though this owed as much to Dr George Hickes and Dr William Cave as to Tillotson. 
In October 1683 Comber was made precentor of York at the behest of John Dolben, the new archbishop, and for the next two and a half years he worked hand in glove with him to reform the minster. According to Dr Henry Watkinson, the chancellor of York diocese, Comber was as good as an extra archdeacon in the place. Dolben's early death in April 1686 and the two-and-a-half year vacancy that followed were blows to Comber, compounding the crisis of James II's abandonment of the tories and promotion of Catholicism. He had a prominent role in the opposition to the king's policies in and around York, in 1688 being ejected from the commission of the peace for his pains. He rallied to the revolution, taking the opportunity to renew his connection with Danby, who acted as godfather to his second son, Thomas, while in York following the seizure of the city. If Comber would have preferred a different constitutional settlement from the one that emerged, he gave no hint of it and very soon set to work defending the new regime in print. Former friends such as Dean Granville of Durham became nonjurors but Comber showed no sign of following them. In fact, Granville's departure gave him a long-looked-for promotion when he succeeded him as dean in 1691, in part thanks to the patronage of Danby (now Carmarthen). Comber was also made chaplain-in-ordinary to William and Mary in 1692. 
His twentieth-century editor, Whiting, designates Comber a whig on the basis of his post-1688 career (Whiting, 2.xii). In his writings Comber certainly moved a long way from his uncompromising toryism of the early 1680s. For example, although he probably did not write 'A Letter to a Bishop Concerning the Present Settlement and the New Oaths' (1689), in subsequent correspondence he did defend the work, which stated that the crown was one of the three estates in England, a position Comber had roundly rejected in 'Religion and Loyalty Supporting each other' as leading to rebellion. Nevertheless, many of his former attitudes -- his extreme deference for Charles I, his bitter hatred of parliamentarianism, his regard for Charles II, and his suspicion of protestant dissent -- survived his change of allegiance intact (as in 'A Discourse on the Offices for the Vth November, XXXth January and XXIXth May', 1696; Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 27, fol. 93). Whiting also notes Comber's 'diligent search for preferment' throughout his career (Whiting, 2.x). He was certainly a long-term pluralist (and a self-righteous one at that), who never seemed to be satisfied with what he had and whose cures were not necessarily well served in his absence. Whether he was untypical of the aspiring churchmen of his generation, however, seems open to doubt. Comber died of consumption on 25 November 1699 at East Newton and was buried at Stonegrave parish church, on 30 November.

Comerford, Nicholas (c.1540-c.1599), Jesuit, was the son of Patrick Comerford of Waterford and his wife ('nee' Walsh). Nicholas was the first of sixteen Jesuits of that name who lived between 1590 and 1640. He was educated at the school of Peter White in Kilkenny, and subsequently in Oxford, where, according to Anthony Wood, he took his degree in arts in 1562 'after he had spent at least four years in pecking and hewing at logic and philosophy' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 1.200). 
After returning to Ireland, Comerford was ordained priest, but soon felt obliged to leave the country because of persecution. He went to Louvain in 1565 and gained a doctorate in divinity on 23 October 1576. His fellow countryman Peter Lombard marked the occasion with a Latin poem, 'Carmen heroicum in doctoratum Nicolai Quemerfordii'. In 1577 Comerford was reported by Sir William Drury, lord president of Munster, as come recently out of Louvain, with James Archer and others, and preaching 'all the way between Rye and Bristol against our religion'. Subsequently, Drury spoke of him as one of 'the principal agents of the pope' (Hogan, 74). 
Comerford and Archer left Ireland in 1580 or 1581. Comerford entered the Society of Jesus at Madrid in 1581. Afterwards he lectured in different colleges in Spain. In 1589 he was mentioned as being in Bayona, Spain, and the following year in Lisbon. There is no mention of him after 1590. He is not in the Irish Jesuit catalogue for 1609. He is reputed to have died about 1599. According to Richard Stanihurst's 'Descriptio Hiberniae' of 1577, Comerford wrote 'a learned and pitty treatise' entitled 'Answers to certain questions propounded by the citizens of Waterford'. He is also said to have written many learned tracts on philosophical and theological subjects, some sermons, and a poem in Latin, 'Carmina in laudem comitis Ormondiae'.

Comerford, John (c.1770-1832), miniature painter, was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of a flax-dresser. He acquired some of his knowledge of painting by copying pictures in Kilkenny Castle, then one of the finest collections of portraits in Ireland, where he would have seen works by Sir Godfrey Kneller and Sir Peter Lely. He was educated at the Dublin Society's drawing schools during the mid-1780s and on 13 May 1790 was recommended for a certificate testifying to his 'extraordinary merit in drawing from the flat' ('Proceedings of the Royal Dublin Society', 26, 1789-90, 122). On 7 April 1791 he received a silver medal in the first class for drawing a single figure from nature (ibid., 27, 1790-91, 81). Comerford divided his time between Kilkenny and Dublin. An advertisement appeared in Finn's 'Leinster Journal' on 13 September 1797: 'Likenesses in Oils and Miniature by J. Comerford who has arrived in Kilkenny for a short time at Mr. Comerford's opposite the Tholsel.' In 1799 Comerford met George Chinnery and afterwards adopted a variation of Chinnery's style of miniature painting. Encouraged by Chinnery, he abandoned oil portraiture and concentrated on miniature painting for the rest of his career. Working in watercolour on ivory, using loose brushstrokes, Comerford's miniatures are relatively large and are well drawn. The features of his sitters are modelled using brown shading with a hint of blue in the darkest areas. A representative example of his miniature style is his portrait of 'Judge Walter MacGuire', painted in Dublin in 1818 (V&A, MacGuire loan). Chinnery helped to organize the Society of Artists of Ireland exhibition held in 1800, in which Comerford first exhibited in Dublin. A review of Comerford's work stated: 'Comerford seems to play with his art in all the strength, the ease and the variety of the most vigorous and commanding genius' ('Dublin Evening Post', 11 May 1802). Comerford lived with the Chinnerys at 27 Dame Street, College Green, Dublin, from 1800. In 1815 he moved to 2 Leinster Street, and shortly before his death he moved to 28 Blessington Street. 
When Comerford sent miniatures to the exhibition at the Parliament House in 1802, his work was praised again and he was referred to as 'bursting at once from provincial retirement into the full blaze of public notice' ('Dublin Evening Post', 17 June 1802). He continued to exhibit miniatures at the Society of Artists of Ireland exhibitions in 1800, 1801, 1802, 1804, and 1810, and at the Irish Society of Artists in 1812 and 1813. In 1811 he was elected to the committee of the Irish Society of Artists and became its vice-president. In 1804 and 1809 he exhibited three portraits at the Royal Academy in London. From 1800, when Comerford first exhibited, until 1823 exhibitions were held by a plethora of societies of artists in Ireland such as the Society of Artists of Ireland, who were continually re-forming as different groups. In 1823 the granting of a charter to the Royal Hibernian Academy did not go without opposition, led by Comerford, who strongly disagreed with the granting of a charter of incorporation for the formation of an academy of artists. 
According to T. J. Mulvany, Comerford accumulated a considerable fortune: 'although of sufficiently prudent turn of mind to amass a very handsome fortune, having left, it is said $16,000 after him, [he] still enjoyed the fruits of fortune during his life and as easy circumstances rendered too great devotion to his profession unnecessary, he delighted to relax in the Society of his friends, among whom were included all the distinguished artists of the day. (Gandon and Mulvany, 152-4)' Among these were the history painter Vincent Waldre ('c'.1742-1814) and William Ashford (1746-1824), the first president of the Royal Hibernian Academy. Comerford often collaborated with Thomas Sautell Roberts ('c'.1760-1826), adding the figures or portraits to Roberts's landscapes, as in, for example, 'View of Powerscourt, with a Portrait of Captain Taylor of the Engineers' and 'View in the Valley of Glencree, with a Portrait of the Earl of Hardwicke, Lord Lieutenant' (exh. Dublin, 1802). 
The miniaturist Samuel Lover (1797-1868) was greatly influenced by Comerford, whom he met in the early 1820s, and by whom he was encouraged to paint miniatures early in his career. His pupil John Doyle (1797-1868) started his career as a miniaturist before becoming a highly successful caricaturist. Thomas Clement Thompson (1778x80-1857) was also taught to paint miniatures by Comerford. 
While on a visit to T. J. Mulvany at Lucan, co. Dublin, in 1829 Comerford had a seizure. His life was saved by Dr Fergusson of Leixlip and he lived to resume his profession for three more years. He died on 25 January 1832 at his home in Blessington Street, Dublin, leaving an only daughter, Mary, to whom he bequeathed $500 a year. A prolific miniaturist, Comerford's work is easily identified as he usually signed and dated his portraits in full. The National Gallery of Ireland has a large collection of his work; others are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and at Kenwood House, London.

Comgall mac Setnai (511/16-602), who was born, according to different texts, either in 511 or 516, and whose feast day is 10 May, belonged to Dal nAraidi; Adomnan associated him with the Cruithni, just as Columba of Iona was the great saint of the Ui Neill. Moreover, some of the daughter churches of Bangor confirm its status among the Cruithni: Antrim (Oentreb) was within the leading kingdom of Dal nAraidi, Mag Line; Camus (Cambas), on the west bank of the Bann 3 miles south-south-east of Coleraine, probably dated from the period before the Cruithni lost control of the lands immediately west of the Bann. Yet Bangor's influence also extended much further. The annals of Ulster record what appears to have been a prolonged visit to Britain by Mael Rubai, abbot of Bangor, beginning in 671 and leading to the foundation of Applecross (Aporcrosan) in Wester Ross in 673. In the southern coastal region of Wexford, in one of the kingdoms of the Ui Bairrche, the monastery of Ard Crema also belonged to the 'familia' of Comgall. Members of the communities of Antrim and Applecross were to be promoted to the abbacy of Bangor (in 613, 728, and 802), according to the annals of Ulster, demonstrating that the links between these houses were enduring. Columbanus's ascetic exile from Ireland ('c'.591), after some years as a monk of Bangor under Comgall, led to equally enduring links with Bobbio, in the Apennines south of the Lombard capital at Pavia, but not, apparently, with his earlier foundation at Luxeuil on the southern side of the Vosges. The intellectual culture of Bangor in the time of Comgall is attested by Columbanus's two surviving hymns, one of them preserved in the antiphonary of Bangor, a late seventh-century manuscript written at Bangor and later taken to Bobbio, that also contains a poem listing the abbots of Bangor up to the late seventh century. The prestige of the community emerges clearly from a comparison of the obits of its abbots in the annals of Ulster and the martyrologies of Tallaght and Oengus: all the early abbots have their obits noted in the annals (then written on Iona) and with one or two possible exceptions all the early abbots were commemorated in the martyrologies. Among them, for example, is the

Cumin, Robert, earl of Northumbria (d. 1069), magnate, was, according to Orderic Vitalis, granted the 'comitatus' ('county') of Durham by William I, in the third year of his reign. However, the 'Historia regum Anglorum' (attributed, with little certainty, to Symeon of Durham) says that Earl Robert was appointed to govern the area to the north of the Tyne, and this has been seen as one of a number of measures adopted by William in his attempt to bring the area under his control. Orderic may have specified Durham as the seat of Cumin's power as this was where the earl met his death, but it is unlikely that he was using the word 'comitatus' in the later sense of earldom. A later source, Gaimar, identifies Earl Robert as the leader of a band of Flemings which suggests that his cognomen, de Cuminis, used by Orderic, may refer to Comines near Lille in Flanders. The earl's relationship to William Cumin, chancellor of David I of Scotland, unsuccessful usurper of the bishopric of Durham in 1141-4, and progenitor of the Scots clan Comyn, is uncertain. Robert Cumin succeeded to the earldom abandoned by Gospatric of Bamburgh. As he is described as being one of those men who paid the wages of their followers by allowing them to pillage and murder, it seems that he was at the head of a company of mercenary soldiers. 
Earl Robert came to Durham late in December 1068 with a body of knights (their number varies from 500 to 900 in the sources), but all except two of them were slaughtered on 28 or 31 January 1069. According to Symeon of Durham's tract on the church of Durham ('Libellus de exordio'), the Northumbrians had heard of Cumin's imminent arrival and prepared themselves for flight, but a violent snowstorm prevented their escape. As a result they decided to murder Earl Robert or die in the attempt. As he made his way north, Cumin was met by AEthelwine, bishop of Durham (1056-71), who warned him of the plot against him. Refusing to heed the warning, the earl encamped in the city of Durham where his men committed acts of violence against the men of St Cuthbert. During the night the Northumbrians, who were those living to the north of the Tyne rather than the citizens of Durham, marched south and burst through the city gates slaughtering any Normans they came across. They attacked the earl, who was lodged in the bishop's house, but were beaten off. The Northumbrians therefore decided to set fire to the episcopal residence and when Earl Robert fled the flames he was killed. Sparks from the burning building threatened to ignite the west tower of the cathedral but prayers by the clergy and townsfolk to St Cuthbert proved efficacious and a contrary wind drove back the fire. On hearing of the massacre William I dispatched an army to the north of England but on reaching Allerton in Yorkshire it was engulfed in a black mist. Learning that the local people had a saint who would allow none to persecute them, the punitive expedition turned back. William of Jumieges describes a general conspiracy against William centred on a stronghold called Durham erected in Cumberland ('sic'), but his account of the rising in the north of England is confused and he does not record Cumin's death. Robert Cumin seems to have been succeeded by the native Northumbrian Gospatric who was reinstated in his earldom. Earl Robert's ill-fated attempt to subdue the Northumbrians living to the north of the Tyne illustrates the tenuous hold which William I had on the region for most of his reign.

Comman mac Faelchon (d. 747), patron saint of Roscommon, whose feast day was 26 December. Comman belonged to the Sogain, a vassal people, one of whose territories lay to the south of Roscommon. Although his pedigree gave him no special advantage, Comman's church was placed to best advantage, on the southern edge of Mag nAi and thus close to the Ui Briuin Ai. Roscommon rapidly became one of the most favoured churches of the Ui Briuin, as shown by the succession of laws of Comman promulgated in the second half of the eighth century. These edicts were proclaimed in the province of Connacht by the combined authority of the provincial king of the Connachta (by then almost always of the Ui Briuin) and of a leading churchman. To judge by these laws or edicts ('canai', 'rechtgai'), Roscommon occupied a more central position than Clonfert enjoyed in the affairs of Connacht in the two generations before the viking attacks began at the end of the eighth century. It was also more central than an Ui Briuin church close to the Shannon, Cluain Coirpthe, the church of

Commius (fl. 57-50 BC), king of the Atrebates, was a native of Gallia Belgica, probably of the tribe of the Atrebates, and an agent of Julius Caesar. He is first mentioned in Caesar's narrative of the Gallic wars (iv.21) after the battle on the Sambre in 57 BC when Caesar appointed him king of the Atrebates, one of the tribes defeated in that engagement. Caesar was favourably impressed by his courage and diplomatic abilities, and accorded him several privileges. Commius possessed influence over some of the tribes of southern Britain, presumably through personal contacts. When Caesar (then in western Belgica among the Morini) was contemplating an expedition to the island in 55 BC, he sent Commius as a legate to Britain to forewarn the British tribes of the invasion and to persuade them to join Caesar's cause. Commius crossed to Britain with British legates who had earlier been sent to Caesar, taking with him a guard of thirty horsemen. When he sought to carry out his commission he was seized and put in chains, but during Caesar's expedition of the same year he was returned to his Roman overlord. Commius seems to have remained in Britain, for during Caesar's second expedition, in 54 BC, it was through his agency that Cassivellaunus submitted to Caesar. 
In 53 BC, as many Gaulish chieftains began to threaten revolt against Rome, Caesar put Commius in command of a cavalry squadron to watch over the Menapii in western Belgica. In the great revolt of the Gauls in the following year, Commius deserted to the side of his countrymen, commanding his own Atrebates and a substantial force of Bellovaci; he himself was endowed with high military authority among the Gauls and took a leading part in the relief of the stronghold of Alesia (south-east of Dijon). Already before this one of Caesar's officers, Gaius Volusenus Quadratus, had tried to entrap Commius by inviting him to a friendly meeting at which the Gaul was to be killed. Although wounded by a sword-blow on this occasion, Commius was able to escape and return to his command of Gaulish forces in the north. In 51 BC Caesar renewed his operations against the Atrebates and Bellovaci. Commius sought help from the Germans east of the Rhine, returning with a cavalry force. But the Gauls fared badly in this campaign and Commius had to take refuge for a time among the Germans. Late in 51 BC he returned, hoping to continue the struggle, but by now the Atrebates had surrendered and only small raiding operations against Roman supply trains were possible. Again Volusenus Quadratus tried to capture Commius, this time by hunting him down. On one occasion the two came face to face, but this time Volusenus was wounded and Commius again made his escape. Soon afterwards, however, Commius submitted to Marcus Antonius, saying that he would accept any agreement provided that he should never again come into the presence of a Roman. 
Shortly after this it is reasonably certain that Commius returned once more to Britain, where a coinage bearing his name was current in the region of modern Hampshire, Sussex, and adjacent areas. An undated episode reported by Frontinus may be linked with his final departure from Gaul. Pursued to the coast by Caesar, Commius hoisted his sails while still in harbour, thereby deluding his pursuers that he had already set sail and thus escaping. It is not known how long he continued in power in Britain. He did, however, found a dynasty from his base within the British Atrebates. Three other kings in Britain struck coins bearing their names along with the filiation 'son of Commius': Tincommius in what is now Hampshire and Sussex, Verica in Sussex and Surrey, Eppillus in Kent ['see under 'Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84)]. Commius has a strong claim to recognition as the most successful king of Iron Age Britain. His prestige owed much to his earlier alliance with Caesar, partly through the glamour of association, partly through the advantage of seeing the Roman military machine at work. Had he not decided upon separation from Rome, or had he lived a few decades later, Commius would have made an effective client-king on the frontiers of empire.

Roger (fl. after 1350), lexicographer and Benedictine monk, is known only from references in his own biblical dictionary, 'Expositiones vocabulorum quae sunt in Biblia'. No evidence survives to account for the sobriquet Computista under which he is commonly known, though it may refer to mathematical skills. In the 'Expositiones' Roger is referred to as the compiler ('collector') of the work, Reginald Walsingham as its editor ('corrector'), and both men are described as monks of Bury St Edmunds. It can be assumed that Roger worked on this early form of dictionary in the years after 1350; it survives in three manuscripts, Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 238, fols. 200'v'-262, Bodl. Oxf., MS Laud misc. 176, fols. 1'r'-163 (both these are copies made in the last quarter of the fourteenth century), and Magd. Oxf., MS Lat. 112, fols. 172'r'-212 (a fifteenth-century copy). Bale reports finding three other works by Roger in a manuscript at Magdalen. One of these, 'Postillationes in evangelia', may be identical with the sermons for Advent found after the dictionary in MS Lat. 112, fols. 212'v'-219'v'; but 'Constitutiones Cantuarienses', though presumably to be equated with the fragment of a 'Liber constitutionum Cantuariensium' in fols. 224'r'-225'v' of the same volume, can have no connection with Roger, while no trace survives, here or elsewhere, of a treatise 'De excommunicatione maiore'. 
The 'Expositiones' forms a massive reference book which, in index form, provides explanations for almost 4000 biblical terms, listed according to the books of scripture in which they appear. The dictionary itself is preceded by an alphabetical list of all the words defined. Roger's brief definitions often trace the Greek, and sometimes the Hebrew, origins of words in the 'Vulgate', and occasionally he draws out the various shades of meaning between the different languages. However, there is no evidence that he himself had any knowledge of these languages, and he would have used the abbey's thirteenth-century Hebrew psalter (surviving as Bodl. Oxf., MS Laud or. 174), its many copies of the 'Bible', and a 'Grammatica'. All the same, Roger's scholarship provides an example of the revitalization of the Benedictine intellectual tradition that took place at Bury in the second half of the fourteenth century, in response both to external criticism and to the severe impact of the black death. The latter seems to have caused the monastery serious problems of recruitment. In his short preface to the 'Expositiones' Roger complains about the attitudes of contemporary novices towards scripture, and towards the effort needed to understand it, and reports that they like to blame their own ignorance and negligence on an alleged absence of handbooks to assist them. He adds that for the sake of future readers he has gone through all the glosses in the library, and collected a list of terms and definitions. 
Roger's work -- which is matched by that of his contemporary at Bury, Henry Kirkestede, whose bibliography of ecclesiastical writers was probably also compiled for the benefit of novices, and who in his 'Speculum cenobitarum' echoes Roger's anxiety over the shortcomings of monastic newcomers -- shows little interest in the contemporary rationalistic trends of the Oxford schools. Rather he and his fellows were concerned to reanimate traditional claustral learning, based on the recitation of the liturgy, reflection on scripture, and the Benedictine rule. Even so, Roger's literal approach to 'Bible' study anticipates fifteenth-century trends towards using scripture as a source of moral teaching, rather than in an allegorical and typological way. The 'Expositiones' appears to have had an immediate impact, both in Oxford (where MS Bodley 238 was in the possession of New College from an early date) and in other learned communities -- MS Laud misc. 176 was in the library of the Bedford Franciscans. The achievements of Roger and his monastic contemporaries in the study of language and texts and the codification of knowledge, and in their attention to reform, especially in relation to the education of novices, show that the Benedictine order was indeed far from being a spent force, either intellectually or morally, in the second half of the fourteenth century.

Compton, Henry (1631/2-1713), bishop of London, was born at Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, the sixth and youngest son of Spencer Compton, second earl of Northampton (1601-1643), and his wife, Mary (died 1654), daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont of Coleorton, Leicestershire. 
Compton's father and brothers were active royalists when civil war came, and the ten-year-old Henry was present in the royalist camp at Edgehill, where his father and brothers were involved in the fighting. His father was killed refusing to surrender at the battle of Hopton Heath on 19 March 1643 and thereafter there is considerable uncertainty about Compton's whereabouts. The family seat was garrisoned by parliamentarians in June 1644 and his mother was forced to compound for the family's estates. Compton later boasted that he had drawn his sword in defence of the constitution but whether this was in the context of the first civil war or subsequently is not clear. He is known to have attended Uppingham grammar school for a while. 
On 9 February 1652 Compton was granted a licence to travel abroad and may have done so. But within less than two years he had returned, for on 12 December 1654 he matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, as a nobleman. Cromwellian Oxford may not have been congenial to him, for he left without taking a degree and seems to have gone on his travels again, visiting France and Italy. According to one source he enlisted under the duke of York (the future James II) in Flanders in this period. A number of things make this unlikely. Compton never subsequently seems to have had a good relationship with York, which is odd if they had been former comrades in arms. Beyond this there is a conversation reported between them, possibly dating from 1686, from which Compton's claim to have drawn his sword for the constitution comes. If this related to service in the 1640s, Compton would hardly have needed to remind his commanding officer of the 1650s of that fact. The whole conversation actually suggests that Compton's military experience came as news to York, who remarked that he spoke more like a colonel than a bishop. 
When the Restoration dawned a military career did indeed seem more likely than an ecclesiastical one for the young Compton. By 16 February 1661 he was commissioned as a cornet in the troop of the Royal Horse Guards, of which two of his brothers were captain and lieutenant. He rose to the rank of lieutenant himself in November. He found time to be admitted as an MA at Cambridge in this year but the next year, in August 1662, he was sent to Tangier in a military capacity. However, in 1663 he left the army for good and on 25 February 1664 was granted a pass to travel to France. In July he wrote to Archbishop Sheldon, asking to have his pass extended to stay on the continent as 'it may conduce to confirm my health' (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 47, fol. 184). 
At thirty-two Compton was something of a rootless cavalier (this is certainly what he looks like in an early portrait of him as a young man). His education, as Burnet later remarked, lacked 'exactness': indeed, it had been highly spasmodic ('Burnet's History', 2.99). Yet he had travelled widely, gaining a cosmopolitan outlook and an awareness of the wider European scene. His direct observation of the Roman Catholic church abroad seems to have fuelled the strongly anti-Catholic tendency which was so evident in his later career. 
Compton finally returned to England in the spring of 1666 and at once came under the influence of John Fell, then dean of Christ Church, Oxford. It was he who persuaded Compton to enter Christ Church as a canon commoner, being incorporated MA on 7 July 1666. Fell also persuaded Compton to be ordained, which took place in the summer of 1666. He was immediately in line for significant ecclesiastical preferment, with a reversion on the next vacant canonry at Christ Church. In 1667 the king made him master of St Cross Hospital at Winchester, to which Bishop George Morley instituted him on 18 November. He came into the canonry at Christ Church even before he had acquired suitable Oxford degrees, receiving his warrant on 29 April 1669 and the degrees BD and DD in May and June respectively. He was then made subdean of Christ Church. Despite his lack of academic background Compton seems to have taken to his new role with relative ease. He made a brief oration at the opening of the Sheldonian Theatre in July 1669, which was well received. In December 1670, when the young prince of Orange -- the future William III -- visited Oxford, Compton was assigned the task of guiding him through the Church of England liturgy at morning prayer in Christ Church: an episode not without a certain piquancy in the light of their future relationship. Contemporaries were agreed that Compton was not a good preacher but, according to one of his earliest biographers, he moderated well in divinity disputations at this time. 
The only shadow over an otherwise promising ecclesiastical career was cast by Compton's financial difficulties, which were already severe by 1670. The profits from St Cross were disappointing and the living at Llandinam in Montgomeryshire in Wales, to which he had been appointed in 1666, does not seem to have made much difference. He owed money to Sir Joseph Williamson, who also acted on behalf of his other creditors. Other livings were added: Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, to which Archbishop Sheldon nominated him in April 1671, and Witney in Oxfordshire, to which Bishop Morley presented him in November 1674. Compton seems to have regarded these livings simply as financial assets but they failed to solve his money problems. A combination of aristocratic excess and genuine generosity meant that his finances were never to be in a healthy condition, even after he became a bishop. 
Compton's elevation to the episcopate as bishop of Oxford in succession to Nathaniel Crewe, which was finalized in November 1674, seems to have been entirely due to the earl of Danby's influence. Compton must have caught the eye of the king's new lord treasurer as just the sort of well-born Anglican royalist upon whose support he intended to build his regime. And Compton would not let him down. He was consecrated in the chapel at Lambeth Palace by Archbishop Sheldon and four diocesan bishops from the province of Canterbury on 6 December 1674. His new see was not lucrative: Compton himself estimated its value at just over $343. He was allowed to retain his position at St Cross, his Christ Church canonry, and the living at Witney 'in commendam', in recognition of this, given his still shaky financial situation. In July 1675 he was appointed to the court post of dean of the chapels royal, which gave him some influence over the education of the young princesses Mary and Anne. Further promotion came in December 1675 when he was appointed bishop of London, a post he would hold until his death. Danby's patronage obtained for him the further honour of elevation to the privy council the following January, even before he had done homage for his appointment to London. 
Compton very soon showed himself to be a highly effective bishop at both the political and the pastoral level. He immediately began to use his place at court and on the council to lobby against the influence of Roman Catholics there, making sure the princesses were prepared for confirmation in the Church of England, in the face of the duke of York's opposition. Charles II tolerated Compton's zeal as harmless and because 'it helped to lay the jealousies of the church party' ('Burnet's History', 2.100). Compton had a significant role in the great church party project of 1676: the ecclesiastical census, known to contemporaries as the 'Bishops' Book' but which has come to be known as the 'Compton Census'. It was designed to demonstrate once and for all to a sceptical king that nonconformists were too few to be worth wooing politically and so strengthen Danby's Anglican royalist regime. Incumbents and churchwardens were to be asked to estimate the relative strengths of conformists, Roman Catholics, and protestant dissenters in their parishes. Sheldon wrote to Compton on 17 January 1676 to set the process in motion in the province of Canterbury; just four days later Compton forwarded the instructions to the relevant diocesans. From the resultant figures from the parishes he estimated that the proportion of conformists to nonconformists throughout the country was twenty-three to one. Compton supported and to some extent supplanted the ailing Archbishop Sheldon in his political role. Compton came to act as organizer of the bishops in the Lords, reminding Sheldon in January 1677 of the need to warn bishops to send in their proxies in good time if they could not attend in person. 
When Sheldon died later that year Compton was strongly tipped to be his successor, although Compton himself purported to support Archbishop Richard Sterne of York for the job, perhaps hoping to be 'his' successor at Canterbury before very long. That Compton was not appointed to Canterbury may be attributed to a number of factors: Danby's lack of enthusiasm (despite professions to the contrary), Charles II's indifference to him, and the duke of York's already passionate hostility. York had even opposed Compton's elevation to London, doubtless already aware of his protestant credentials, and Compton in post had fulfilled York's worst fears, with his interference in his daughters' religious education and his crusade against influential Roman Catholics at court. But 1677 was not an entirely disappointing year for Compton. On 4 November he had the joy of helping the prince of Orange through another piece of Church of England liturgy when he presided at his wedding to the young Princess Mary, a great boost to the protestant cause both at home and abroad. 
However, Compton was much more than merely a court prelate tied up with high politics. He was also a remarkably conscientious diocesan bishop. He conducted visitations of his diocese in person throughout his tenure, going in person to the parishes concerned. From January 1678 he developed the idea of conferences for the clergy throughout his diocese, where pastoral and practical issues could be discussed. These took place not only at the urban core of the diocese but in the outlying rural areas as well, convened by rural deans, with reports of proceedings and lists of absentees returned to Compton personally. 
But Compton's political involvement made him vulnerable to the growing instability of the times. When the Popish Plot scare broke out in the autumn of 1678 Compton had a prominent role in investigating the alleged conspiracy. He was an energetic member of the privy council committee charged with looking into it. He ordered that English Roman Catholics who attended mass at ambassadors' houses be arrested. In early November he even backed the earl of Shaftesbury's motion in the Lords that the duke of York be removed from the court and council. Not surprisingly this lost Compton favour at court but it did not protect him from rumours that he was a closet papist himself. Danby's fall from power was a grievous blow to Compton, considering how closely he had previously been associated with him. 
Perhaps aware of his own political isolation, Compton softened his line towards the duke of York over the course of the exclusion crisis (1679-81). In October 1680 he voted for York to stay in England, and in November he joined the other bishops present in voting down the 'Exclusion Bill' in the Lords. In the same month he brought some words spoken against the duke of York and in favour of the duke of Monmouth to the attention of the privy council. By February 1681 he was firmly back in favour and was appointed to the commission for ecclesiastical promotions, designed to control church patronage and keep it in loyal hands. But Compton's position within the tory reaction, which characterized the years down to 1685, has been the subject of some controversy both at the time and since. In 1682 and 1683 he was criticized for his supposed friendliness and liberality towards nonconformists by some hardline Anglicans. He could certainly 'sound' friendly towards individual dissenters, such as Richard Baxter in the 1670s, but his friendliness does not seem to have extended to taking action in their favour. He could hardly be described as liberal about nonconformity in the early 1680s. In March 1683 he wrote to every incumbent in his diocese complaining that churchwardens had been remiss in their presentations especially about absentees from holy communion, and the parish registers of Hillingdon testify to 300 communicants over the following Easter period: 'alarmed to their duty by an order from Henry Lord Bishop of London' (J. S. Burn, 'The History of Parish Registers', 2nd edn, 1862, 186). And the 'shameful disuse of public baptism' was one of the main topics that Compton prescribed for one of his clergy conferences at this time (Sykes, 26). 
Where a generous and flexible attitude did show through was in Compton's approach to continental protestants, especially those who were experiencing persecution. He had solicited the opinions of certain European protestant divines about their differences with the Church of England, and in 1677 translated a work of Andre Lortie as 'A Treatise of the Holy Communion'. Compton was the natural choice to spearhead fund-raising and other practical initiatives on behalf of protestant refugees in July 1681 and he worked tirelessly on their behalf, sometimes having to battle against a distinct lack of enthusiasm among his episcopal colleagues. He even found himself compelled to mediate in the internal disputes of the exiled French churches resident within his own diocese. His commitment to international protestantism was very clear. But as the new reign loomed in 1685, Compton's commitment to tory principles was equally clear. He drew up a loyal address to the new king, James II, and sent a copy of it to his rural deans so that the clergy of London diocese might speak with one voice. He presented it in person along with the clergy of the capital within one week of the accession, although it took a while for the outlying archdeaconries to catch up with their copies. It spoke pointedly of 'our religion established by law dearer to us than our lives' (Carpenter, 79). In the general election Compton mobilized rural deans on behalf of loyal candidates and at the coronation in April he attended personally upon the queen. 
However, it did not take long for the old feud between Compton and James to resurface. The 'casus belli' for the new round of conflict was James's employment of Roman Catholic officers in the army, contrary to the 'Test Act' of 1673. In the second session of parliament on 18 November, Compton made a long, calm, and deferential speech which nevertheless criticized the king's flouting of the law as endangering the whole constitution. He claimed to speak for his episcopal colleagues, a claim endorsed when those bishops who were present in the Lords stood up in solidarity with him when he had finished. As a result of his boldness Compton was removed from his posts as dean of the chapels royal, clerk of the closet, and member of the privy council. 
Compton was soon openly opposing other aspects of royal policy, notably the plans to curtail anti-Catholic preaching, either by suppressing afternoon lectures or by issuing instructions to preachers. James did not follow through the first of these options but he most emphatically pursued the latter and it was from this that his next confrontation with Compton arose. John Sharp, dean of Norwich and rector of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, indulged in some anti-Catholic remarks in his preaching. James responded on 17 June 1686 by ordering Compton to suspend him. Compton demurred on the ground that Sharp could not be suspended without first being heard (although he had privately persuaded Sharp to desist from preaching for the present). As a result Compton was summoned before the recently created ecclesiastical commission on 9 August and was granted until 31 August to prepare his case. His counsel maintained that Compton had obeyed the king as far as he legally could. Nevertheless the verdict for his suspension was delivered on 6 September by an admittedly divided commission. The harsher sentence of deprivation was not imposed, so Compton's episcopal revenues remained untouched, though more perhaps out of a fear of a challenge at common law than from any clemency on the part of the commissioners. 
Compton at once became a protestant martyr. Princess Mary wrote to him expressing her sympathy and his treatment was said to be widely resented. He continued to guide his clergy from behind the scenes, dividing his time between London and the country, indulging his favourite pastime of gardening. His episcopal duties were taken over by three of his colleagues. 
Only with James II's showdown with the seven bishops over the reading of the declaration of indulgence in churches in 1688 did Compton again become prominent in public life. He approved their petition and indeed, with typical impetuosity, may well have been responsible for having it published, which raised the stakes on all sides. Compton visited the seven in the Tower of London and may well have been present at their trial. 
In his next political action, however, Compton went way beyond what his episcopal colleagues could have contemplated in signing the invitation to William of Orange to intervene militarily in England. In this he joined his former mentor, Danby, who had recruited him to the conspiracy. Rash and impetuous though this undoubtedly was, it was not the bolt from the blue that it might at first appear. Compton had remained in touch with the court at The Hague, initially with his former protegee Princess Mary but latterly with William directly. They shared concern at the developing situation in England: it was through Compton that William expressed his concern for the seven bishops. According to Danby, it was his treatment at the hands of the ecclesiastical commission in 1686 that led him to reconsider his commitment to the traditional doctrine of passive obedience. 
William was not perhaps as circumspect as he might have been in covering Compton's tracks: he mentioned the action taken against Compton by the ecclesiastical commission in his declaration of reasons for intervening in England. He also mentioned an invitation from lords spiritual and temporal (in fact, Compton was the only spiritual one to have signed the invitation). Not surprisingly James became suspicious and invited Compton to a private meeting on 31 October. Compton was out of London at the time. When the two did meet soon afterwards he gave the king a deceptive answer implying that he was innocent: 'I am quite confident that there is not one of my brethren who is not as guiltless as myself in this matter' (Macaulay, 1.562). In this he was not necessarily motivated solely by personal cowardice (others might have been implicated) and even if he had been, a certain lack of courage in the face of the potential penalty for treason in seventeenth-century England is hardly so reprehensible. Compton successfully stiffened his fellow bishops in resisting James's repeated calls for an abhorrence of William's invasion, though they could hardly have guessed the reason for his resolve. He had ignored both the lifting of his suspension by the ecclesiastical commission at the end of September and the abolition of the commission itself on 5 October, neither resuming his episcopal duties nor offering any thanks. He bided his time. Those who had signed the invitation to William had pledged themselves to join him as soon as possible after he landed. Perhaps by agreement with his fellow conspirators, Compton remained in London, keeping a low profile, offering protection to Princess Anne, should she wish to escape. She took up the offer and was escorted out of London by the fully armed bishop and others, reaching Castle Ashby, the earl of Northampton's seat, on 28 November, going thence to Nottingham and then to Oxford, where Princess Anne was reunited with her husband, Prince George, on 15 December. 
Compton's bearing arms in the context of the revolution became notorious but requires careful scrutiny. In the context of governmental breakdown and military disintegration it was perhaps prudent to have some weapons about his person. Where Compton appears to have overstepped the mark was in continuing to bear arms and indeed in revelling in military command after he had joined up with forces quite capable of protecting the princess without his assistance. He even rode into the tory centre of Oxford in martial style, which was to fly in the face of Anglican scruples about involvement in armed resistance to the lawfully constituted government and to store up for himself charges of hypocrisy when he returned to the traditional position of passive obedience in due course. He further compounded his insensitivity to Anglican scruples by convening a meeting in Princess Anne's presence at which those present were invited to enter into an association to take revenge should the prince of Orange be harmed by Roman Catholics. Many tory peers and gentry present refused to sign. 
Compton was closely identified with William and Mary in the ensuing constitutional struggle. On 21 December he presented a congratulatory address from his clergy to William and before the end of the year celebrated holy communion for him. Early in January 1689 he controversially instructed his clergy to omit prayers for the prince of Wales, James II's son, born the previous June, whom many supporters of the revolution believed to be an impostor. He was isolated from the overwhelming majority of his fellow bishops, who favoured a regency. And not surprisingly it was Compton who preached the sermon following the offer of the crown to William and Mary. Next day he was made a privy councillor and dean of the chapels royal again. He was also to be groom of the stole. On 20 February he led the London clergy in procession to offer a congratulatory address to the new sovereigns, whose coronation he was to preside at in April. He was a keen supporter of the regime and its emphasis on moral reformation. William's letter of 1689 to him ordering the clergy to read the statutes against vice was published and itself became part of the regime's propaganda campaign. 
After the spring of 1689 Compton seems hard to place politically. This reflects in part the complexity of the post-revolution political scene but also the fact that he was increasingly motivated by a personal agenda. He appeared to support comprehension for nonconformists within the Church of England, conscientiously presiding over all eighteen sessions of the special commission in October, but was then involved in getting Dr William Jane, a protege, made prolocutor of the lower house of convocation, which further reduced comprehension's already slim chances of being accepted. Jane was a hardline opponent of comprehension, who had even queried the legality of the comprehension commission. The alternative and pro-comprehension candidate was John Tillotson, the front runner for the archiepiscopate of Canterbury in preference to Compton, pending William Sancroft's removal for failing to take the oaths to William and Mary. In 1690 Compton was said to have 'influence over most of the Whig party' ('CSP dom.', '1690-91', 210), while on the contrary Gilbert Burnet saw him as a consistent tory. Queen Mary was soon complaining of Compton and other high-churchmen conspiring with her sister Anne against her at court; while Thomas Comber, dean of Durham, hoped that Compton might get the lesser prize of the archbishopric of York and so help engage the tory clergy of the northern province to the revolutionary government. 
Compton made no attempt to hide his disappointment at being passed over for Canterbury. He attended neither Tillotson's consecration nor his admission to the privy council in 1691 and was still reluctant to be involved in court business at the end of that year. It appears that neither of the new sovereigns wanted him as archbishop, William motivated perhaps by an uncomfortable awareness of his debt to Compton in the revolution, perhaps also by personal dislike. When Canterbury fell vacant again in 1694-5 Compton's expectations were not as great, and any disappointment was less obvious. He remained politically loyal to the regime, although increasingly alienated from its ecclesiastical preferences and priorities. 
Whatever his disappointments Compton continued to work conscientiously as a diocesan and in support of the charitable causes to which he was committed. The clergy conferences and visitations continued. He even managed to conduct a visitation of St Paul's between 1696 and 1698, giving the cathedral new statutes which laid down the basic pattern of worship there for the next century. He also took seriously his spiritual oversight of the American colonies, which he exercised as bishop of London, supporting Thomas Bray in his work there as his commissary in 1699-1700. Compton also backed Bray's brainchild of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which was founded in 1701. 
Compton's political fortunes revived considerably when William was succeeded by Anne, with whom he had enjoyed such a close relationship over the years. He was appointed lord high almoner in 1702 and gained some influence over church appointments. In 1708 he gave pastoral support to the queen on the death of Prince George (he had presided at their wedding twenty-five years before). He clearly supported the high-church and tory programme in this period: the revival of convocation, the clamp-down on occasional conformity, the rallying cry that the church was in danger. Both Francis Atterbury and Dr Sacheverell were proteges. And in 1710 he presented an address to the queen congratulating her on her change of ministry from whigs to tories. 
Whigs delighted to exhume evidence of inconsistency and hypocrisy in the light of his later political stance. But it is possible to exaggerate the shift in Compton's views over the years. The impression given by some accounts of the period written then and since of an almost radical bishop becoming reactionary in old age is misleading. His views on most subjects throughout his career were the conventional ones for a churchman of the period. It was the intensity of his anti-Catholicism, compounded by a personal feud with James II, which marked him out from his episcopal colleagues in the 1680s and drove him to actions that they could not countenance. But Danby's right-hand man on the episcopal bench in the 1670s was hardly an incongruous opponent of occasional conformity in the 1700s. The religious complexion of the regime was a critical factor for Compton. Impetuous man that he was, it was not surprising that he should conspire against a Catholic regime at one stage in his career and advocate obedience to a protestant one at another. Burnet was right to detect a certain consistency in his loyalties over a considerable period, although paradoxically it was Burnet who bowled him out publicly for eliding his active role in the revolution, when discussing the rights and wrongs of passive obedience in the Lords in 1705. 
After years of good health Compton deteriorated physically, suffering from gout and stones. In 1711 he was seriously ill. In the following year he had a fall, but recovered enough to undertake another taxing visitation. But his health declined again and he died calmly, aged eighty-one, at his episcopal residence at Fulham on 7 July 1713. At his own request he was buried without pomp in the churchyard and with the simplest of memorials within the parish church at Fulham on 15 July. This was typical of the man: he had a real humility which even an opponent like Burnet could recognize. The truth was too that there was little money left for anything grander, even had he wanted it. He had written a begging letter to the earl of Oxford as recently as October 1712, being as ever strapped for cash. Neither the proceeds of the see of London nor the $1000 salary which Compton latterly enjoyed as a commissioner of trade and plantations could offset the effects of his lack of financial management and his impetuous generosity. He had no wife and children to support; no doubt his financial difficulties would have been even greater if he had. At death, little remained apart from his magnificent library, which was split between St Paul's and Colchester corporation. 
It is possible, with Burnet, to see Compton as a weak man influenced by others. And yet there can be little doubt that he was one of the most effective diocesan bishops in this period. In many ways a shy and private man, there is seldom displayed an insight into his inner thoughts. Several works were published under his name, sometimes without his consent (such as 'Episcopalia', a collection of letters to his clergy, in 1686). But they seldom shed much light on his personal life, being largely of an official nature, with few clues as to his deeper motivations. The works of others which he translated betray his absorption with anti-Catholicism (such as Gregorio Leti's 'Life of Donna Olimpia Maldachini' from the Italian in 1666 and Fulgentio Micanzio's 'Jesuits' Intrigues' from the French in 1669). 
The surviving portraits in later life are not much more help, although they convey the impression of a man of effectiveness and drive in the public realm, with clear facial features and directness of expression. Botany was a great interest, and he planted his gardens at Fulham with 'a greater variety of curious exotic plants and trees than had at that time been collected in any garden in England' ('DNB'), most obtained from his correspondents in North America. He never married, despite occasional gossip that he would. His household became a sort of surrogate family to him and he inspired great loyalty among his chaplains. Compton was hospitable and his personal generosity to individuals was prodigious. 
Compton's legacy in many areas of church and state was significant. Such were the variety and multiplicity of his involvements that his lasting influence defies neat summary. But places as far apart as St Paul's Cathedral and the American colonies were in his debt. His conscientious rule left the diocese of London in a much better spiritual state than it had been when he took over. Indeed, he presided over something of a religious revival there, which had far-reaching consequences in following decades. He struggled to maintain the international contacts of the Church of England at a time when it was in danger of turning inwards and forgetting the wider world and the broader protestant cause. Finally, however mixed the feelings of his contemporaries, Compton's active role in bringing about the revolution was long remembered and celebrated -- an example of a certain reckless courage which has not always characterized the political stances of the Church of England's senior bishops.

Compton, Henry (1805-1877), actor, was born on 22 March 1805 at Huntingdon. He was the sixth of the eleven children of John Mackenzie and his wife, formerly Mrs Elizabeth Symonds; the families of both his parents provided numerous distinguished members of the medical profession. After an education at Huntingdon and at a boarding-school at Little Baddow in Essex, Charles was apprenticed to a maternal uncle, a cloth merchant in Aldermanbury, near London. Unhappy in mercantile pursuits and yearning for life on the stage, he was retrieved after running away twice, but, on his third attempt to abscond, in 1826, his family accepted the inevitability of his career on the stage. 
Mackenzie's earliest histrionic attempts consisted of imitations of the 'At Homes' of Charles Mathews, with which, as with the acting of John Liston, he was impressed. His first engagement, obtained through an agent, was at Lewes. He then played at Leicester as Richmond and Macduff. He appeared briefly at Cromer, and then was employed for twelve months as a member of the Bedford circuit. It was during this period that he adopted Compton as his stage name, borrowed from one of his grandfather's wives. 
In 1828 Compton was at Daventry, and it was here that he apparently began to specialize in low-comedy roles. Shortly thereafter he appeared at Hammersmith. Three years' experience on the Lincoln circuit was followed by a long and successful engagement on the York circuit. In Leeds he was a special favourite. His first London appearance was at the English Opera House (Lyceum) on 24 July 1837, as Robin in 'The Waterman'. After playing several parts there successfully Compton was transferred on 7 October 1837 to Drury Lane, where his Master Slender gave promise of the reputation he was to earn in Shakespeare. Tony Lumpkin, Gnatbrain in 'Black-Eyed Susan', Silky in Thomas Holcroft's 'The Road to Ruin', Bailie Nicol Jarvie, and the First Gravedigger in 'Hamlet' followed. His chief successes at the Lyceum and at Drury Lane were Mawworm in Isaac Bickerstaff's 'The Hypocrite', Marrall in Philip Massinger's 'A New Way to Pay Old Debts', and Dr Ollapod in George Colman's 'The Poor Gentleman'. While he was at Drury Lane in 1839, a young actress named Emmeline Montague made her London debut as Juliet, with Compton taking the role of the Apothecary. 
Following the termination of the 1839 season at Drury Lane, Compton went in 1840 to the Theatre Royal, Dublin, whence he returned on 10 December 1841 with the reputation of being the best Shakespearian clown of his epoch. Having been engaged by W. C. Macready, he appeared at Drury Lane in 1843-4, and after visiting Manchester, Liverpool, and Dublin he transferred his services to the Princess's, where he performed as Touchstone on 11 November 1844. He remained at the Princess's for three years. In 1847 he was at the Olympic, where also he remained three years. Polonius, Sir Peter Teazle, Launcelot Gobbo, and Foresight in Congreve's 'Love for Love' were among the parts he took at Drury Lane; at the Princess's and the Olympic he played a round of 'legitimate' characters. When the Olympic was burnt down, Compton migrated to the Strand, and in 1853 he began his longest and best-remembered engagement, with J. B. Buckstone at the Haymarket. During his stay at the Haymarket he created Blenkinsop in Tom Taylor's 'An Unequal Match', Sir Solomon Frazer in the same author's 'The Overland Route', De Vaudray in Westland Marston's 'A Hero of Romance', and Captain Mountraffe in T. W. Robertson's 'Home'. 
On 21 December 1848 Compton and Emmeline Catherine Montague (died 1911) were married. Thereafter the new Mrs Compton appeared at Windsor Castle in a small role in 'The Merchant of Venice' (28 December 1848), several times at the Strand (during the summer of 1849), and in a performance at Devonshire House of Bulwer-Lytton's 'Not so Bad as we Seem', before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (May 1851). She then retired from the stage to devote herself to her growing family. The Comptons resided at 19 Charing Cross Road, where most of their children were born. 
Henry Compton left the Haymarket to play at the Princess's Theatre, Manchester, on 15 August 1870, and afterwards at the Olympic (3 September 1870), in Taylor's 'Handsome is that Handsome does', and on 7 October 1871 appeared in H. J. Byron's 'Partners for Life', with which H. J. Montague opened the Globe Theatre. In the noteworthy Bateman-Irving revival of 'Hamlet', which opened at the Lyceum on 30 October 1874, he resumed his old character of the First Gravedigger with great success. With the Vezin-Chippendale touring company he played several of his old characters. His last appearance on the stage was at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, Liverpool, on 14 July 1877, as Mawworm in 'The Hypocrite' and Pangloss in two acts of Colman's 'The Heir-at-Law'. 
When it was known that Compton was ill with cancer and that his family was in serious financial straits, two benefit performances were accorded him. The first, at Drury Lane on 1 March 1877, was notable for the appearances of Henry Irving, Joseph Jefferson, Sir Arthur Sullivan as orchestra leader, W. S. Gilbert in an excerpt from 'Trial by Jury', and Compton's son, Edward Compton, in his father's roles. The benefit realized in excess of $3250, thought by its organizers to be extraordinarily successful. The second benefit, at Manchester on 27 March 1877, was nearly as generous. 
Henry Compton died after a long and painful illness on 15 September 1877 at Seaforth House, 12 Stanford Road, Kensington, London.

Compton, Sir Herbert Abingdon Draper (1776-1846), judge in India, was the only son of Henry Compton (died before 1804) of Hartpury, Gloucestershire. He was a relation of Sir Walter Abingdon Compton, fifth and last baronet (died 1773), of Hartpury. About 1790 he arrived in India and in August 1791 he became an ensign in her majesty's 74th regiment, then stationed in the Madras presidency. He served with the 74th in the war of 1790-92 against Tipu Sultan of Mysore and was promoted lieutenant on 17 October 1793, but in April 1796 he resigned from the army and articled himself in an attorney's office in Madras. On 16 October 1798 he married Mary Anne, the daughter of John (Jean) Carere (died 1780), a Swiss protestant who had joined the Madras medical service in 1764 after defecting from the service of Muhammad Yusuf, governor of Madura. 
In 1802 Compton was appointed junior counsel to the East India Company in Madras. He returned to Britain in 1805 and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 22 November 1808, having meanwhile supported his family by writing for newspapers, principally 'The Pilot'. Mary had given birth to a son, Herbert, in September 1803. She cannot have lived for many years after this, for in February 1810 another son, Charles Francis, was born to Compton by a wife whose given names were Maria Elizabeth. 
In 1809 the court of directors licensed Compton to return to Madras as an advocate, and in 1811 he again became counsel for the company. In 1814 he was granted permission to move to Bengal, and on 15 June 1815 he was enrolled as an advocate of the supreme court of Calcutta. By then he was again a widower, and on 26 July 1815 he married Sarah Cherry, daughter of Edward Mullins of Calcutta. The artist George Chinnery was a witness to their union in St John's Church. They had at least four children, among them Thomas Abingdon Draper (1820-1862), a future Bombay civilian and judge of Sholapur. In 1816 Compton was appointed standing counsel to the company in the Calcutta supreme court, and in 1820 he became sheriff of Calcutta. In 1822 he was appointed advocate general of Madras, a position which a former incumbent, Alexander Anstruther, had enthusiastically recommended him for a decade previously. In March 1828 he was readmitted to the Calcutta bar, and in 1831, after a brief retirement in Britain, he was appointed chief justice of Bombay and knighted. He finally retired from India in 1839. Throughout his career, government and private clients alike praised his ability, common sense, local knowledge, and integrity. He was the recipient on several occasions of gifts of plate from grateful clients, including a handsome silver service presented by the leading Indian inhabitants of Bombay on his departure in 1839. 
Compton died at his house in Hyde Park Gardens, London, on 15 January 1846. He was remembered in Indian legal circles as a self-made man who had worked his way up by exceptional talent. After his death his daughter Mrs Skirrow gave a portrait of him by Ramsay Reinagle to the Oriental Club in Hanover Square. In the words of the club's historian, it shows 'a handsome man, with good nose and forehead', his whiskers 'very small', and his hair 'thick and grey' (Baillie, 221).

Compton, Spencer, second earl of Northampton (1601-1643), army officer, was born in May 1601 and baptized on 28 May at St Michael Bassishaw, London, the eldest son of Sir William Compton (died 1630) of Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, later first earl of Northampton, and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1632), daughter and later heir of Sir John Spencer (d. 1610) of Canonbury, Middlesex. He was admitted to Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1614, created MA in 1615, and made knight of the Bath in November 1616. His father having become president of the council in the marches of Wales, he too was made a councillor (12 November 1617); and following his father's elevation to the peerage as earl of Northampton on 2 August 1618 he was styled Lord Compton. Granted a licence to travel in 1619, Compton was elected MP for Ludlow two years later, his path probably smoothed by his office in the marches. Soon after 20 October 1621 he married Mary (died 1654), daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont of Coleorton, Leicestershire, and first cousin of the royal favourite George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham. They had two daughters and six sons, including James Compton (1622-1681), William Compton (1625-1663), and Henry Compton (1631/2-1713). 
Appointed in 1622 master of the robes to Prince Charles, Compton accompanied Charles and Buckingham to Madrid in 1623 on the mission to woo the Spanish infanta, but he became ill during the venture. On the accession of Charles as king he retained his court office and in April 1626 was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Compton. Following his father's death on 24 June 1630, he succeeded as second earl of Northampton. Although the extravagant first earl left debts of over $10,000, this made a relatively small dent in family fortunes (enhanced by the inheritance of Elizabeth Spencer), and the second earl's income in the 1630s from estates in Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, London, and six other counties was over $6000 a year. He assumed his father's lord lieutenancy of Warwickshire and took on the same position in Gloucestershire, but was often absent from the midlands, leaving local administration to deputy lieutenants; this record was to tell against him later. A close friend of the king, he attended him in Scotland in 1633. He subsequently fought in the European wars, serving in George Goring's regiment at the siege of Breda in 1637, attending the prince palatine and Prince Rupert at The Hague that July, and joining the palatine's forces at the battle of Vlotho in 1638. 
On his return to England, Northampton became master of the great wardrobe to the king. As a courtier personally loyal to the crown rather than a man of definite, discernible political views, he raised troops for the bishops' wars of 1639 and 1640. After the defeat of the royal army at Newburn in August 1640 Northampton supported the petition of the twelve peers for the summoning of parliament, but he never wavered in his opposition to the Scots, even opposing the raising of levies to pay their army of occupation. Against a background of opposition to royal policy in Warwickshire and campaigning by his political rival Robert Greville, Lord Brooke (who had a much higher profile locally), Northampton managed to get his son, James Compton, returned for one of the county seats at both elections of 1640. However, though he signed the parliamentary protestation of 1641, he was replaced as lord lieutenant of Warwickshire by Lord Brooke on 11 February 1642. 
That summer Northampton was quick to side with the king. He joined the court at York and on 13 June 1642 signed the engagement in defence of the king; with eight other peers he was impeached for his absence from parliament. Charles appointed Northampton to the commissions of array for Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Gloucestershire, and Gloucester. Concentrating his energies on the first, Northampton issued on 25 June 1642 the royal commission in Coventry, where he had been recorder since 1640, but he not only failed to raise any support but also prompted Brooke into holding five musters around the county for parliament. Northampton was at the centre of efforts to seize the Warwickshire magazine, and was able to assemble trained bands at four places between 28 July and 1 August. On 30 July he confronted Brooke and a convoy of artillery at Warmington Hill on the southern edge of the county. 
A day of negotiations saw the artillery deposited at nearby Banbury, Oxfordshire, with each side promising three days' notice to the other of any attempt to remove it, but a week later, during Brooke's absence in London, Northampton secured it. Having marched on the king's orders to Warwick, he took the town and laid siege to the castle, Brooke's seat, but an unexpectedly energetic defence by Sir Edward Peyto, support for Brooke from below the ranks of the gentry, and eventually the arrival of a parliamentarian army meant that, notwithstanding a visit by Charles to the area on 20 August, Northampton was unable either to overwhelm the castle and keep Warwick or to take the other key local town, Coventry. On 22 August, the day that Charles raised his standard at Nottingham, Northampton's forces were defeated about 10 miles east of Warwick at Southam by John Hampden and Brooke. Northampton then joined the king's field army, fighting at Powick Bridge on 23 September and at Edgehill a month later. By the end of November the earl and three of his sons had captured Banbury, where they survived a siege at the end of December. 
Commissioned lieutenant-general of royalist forces in Warwickshire and Northamptonshire in February 1643, Northampton took advantage of Brooke's absence on campaign in Staffordshire to establish garrisons throughout Warwickshire. While Brooke was killed in an attack on Lichfield, its fall to the parliamentarians placed the rest of Staffordshire under threat, and Northampton was ordered to assist his counterpart Henry Hastings. The two joined forces at Coleshill and marched to Stafford, the next target for parliamentarian commanders Sir John Gell and Sir William Brereton. Early on Sunday 19 March the royalist generals dashed out of Stafford with their horse while their foot followed behind. On Hopton Heath they found Gell and Brereton's army and launched an immediate attack. After several charges the parliamentarians were driven from their positions and their artillery captured. During the fighting Northampton had been unhorsed and surrounded by the enemy. Offered quarter, he reportedly 'scorned to take quarter from such base rogues and rebels as they were' (Clarendon, 'Hist. rebellion', 2.476), and was killed by a blow to the head from a halberd. The retreating parliamentarians carried his body from the field and Gell later used it as a bargaining counter in an attempt to retrieve the lost artillery. When the offer was refused, Northampton was buried at All Hallows Church, Derby; he was subsequently reburied at Compton Wynyates. His wife, Mary, who survived him, died in London on 18 March 1654 and was also buried at Compton. Their son James succeeded as third earl of Northampton.

Compton, Spencer, earl of Wilmington (c.1674-1743), prime minister, was the sixth son of James Compton, third earl of Northampton (1622-1681), his third son with his second wife, Mary (died 1719), the eldest daughter of Baptist Noel, third Viscount Campden. He was educated at St Paul's School, enrolled at the Middle Temple in 1687, and was admitted a commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1690. Although he failed in an attempt to enter parliament in 1695, he was returned for Eye, Suffolk, at a by-election in June 1698. Among his whig brethren he cut a slightly odd figure, coming from a family of high-church tories (his uncle was Henry Compton, bishop of London), but a violent quarrel with his elder brother George, fourth earl of Northampton, had turned him to the whigs. He was a dull and uninspiring speaker in the Commons and his gifts were limited to a mastery of rule and precedent. By the early years of Queen Anne's reign he had none the less established himself among the more prominent whig politicians, and among his Kit-Cat Club confreres enjoyed a particular rapport with the young Robert Walpole. In the Commons he chaired the elections and privileges committee from 1705 until 1710, a role usually considered a stepping stone to the speakership. 
In 1707 Compton was given office as paymaster of pensions and appointed treasurer to the queen's consort, Prince George. His support for the Marlborough-Godolphin ministry was invariably assiduous, though as a faithful lord treasurer's whig he was least enthusiastic towards the admission of junto whigs to office late in 1708. Difficulties with his electoral patron, Lord Cornwallis, precluded his re-election for Eye in 1710, but, having been one of Henry Sacheverell's severest persecutors at the impeachment trial earlier in the year, he took no steps to secure election elsewhere. The incoming tory ministers nevertheless retained him in his paymaster's office until 1713, though probably out of consideration for his many family connections among the tories. 
During this hiatus in his career Compton acquired an estate near Eastbourne in Sussex, and in 1713 he re-entered parliament for the Sussex borough of East Grinstead. At the accession of George I he was said to have been resentful at not receiving immediate recognition from senior whigs in the new ministry, particularly as he had several times been tipped for high office in the preceding reign. After the general election early in 1715, however, during which he was chosen a knight of the shire for Sussex, he became treasurer to the prince of Wales (the future George II), and, on reassembling in March, the Commons unanimously adopted him as speaker. He was sworn of the privy council on 6 July 1716. Despite certain shortcomings, his unflawed knowledge of precedent and the rulings of previous speakers suited Compton particularly well for the role, and he presided over the house with characteristic punctiliousness for the next twelve years. His innate formality and hauteur lent dignity to proceedings, though John Hatsell has suggested that his notions of maintaining order were somewhat lax, and reported an anecdote that Compton would rebuke MPs who called on him to quieten noisy debates and who insisted on a right to be heard with the words, 'No sir, you have a right to speak, but the House have a right to judge whether they will hear you' (Hatsell, 2.108). His successor, the renowned Speaker Onslow, described him as 'very able... in the chair, but [he] had not the powers of speech out of it' ('Buckinghamshire MSS', 516). At the ministerial split in 1717, to which the prince of Wales's quarrel with his father had in a major way contributed, Compton, as head of the prince's household, joined the Townshend-Walpole group in opposition and thus found himself in the unusual predicament of having to fulfil his duties as speaker while technically in opposition to the king's ministers. Yet he achieved this feat until the reconciliation of 1720 without incurring the least hint of displeasure. 
Compton's loyalty to Walpole had been unswerving during the years of the whig schism, but their differing situations were accentuated after the ministerial reconstruction of 1721 which brought Walpole to power. While Walpole could realistically expect to remain at the helm under George I, the prince's appreciation of Compton's efficient management of his household led him often and openly to declare that he had no intention of retaining Walpole when he himself became king and that Compton would replace him. For the time being, Walpole did what he could to keep Compton out of ministerial politics by promoting his re-election to the speaker's chair in 1722; he also pandered to his avaricious instincts by having him appointed paymaster-general, one of the most lucrative offices in the administration. Compton was reputed to have made $100,000 during his tenure of the post between 1722 and 1730. Moreover, in May 1725 he was included in Walpole's newly revived knighthood of the Bath. At the news of George I's death in May 1727 the new king ordered Walpole to take his instructions from Compton. But, on finding himself suddenly encumbered with affairs of state, Compton lost his nerve and needed Walpole's assistance even in the preliminary task of drafting George II's declaration to the privy council. Over the next few days his limited acumen became painfully apparent, and was ultimately confirmed in royal eyes by the ungenerousness of his proposals for Queen Caroline's income compared with those produced by Walpole. At an interview with the king, at which Walpole was also present, Compton reportedly broke down, declaring that the burden of leading the king's administration would be far too great for him. In later years he would gloss over these events by claiming that 'affairs abroad were in so bad [a] situation that [he] durst not be premier minister' ('Egmont Diary', 1.375). Compton thereafter bore an unremitting sense of grievance against Walpole for having inflicted on him so public a humiliation. 
The king's continuing regard for Compton ensured the latter's retention in the ministry as paymaster, though by the end of the year Walpole was fully aware that he was involved in the growing 'confederacy' of discontented whigs now ranged against him. On 8 January 1728 Compton was created a peer and took the title of Baron Wilmington in the county of Sussex. He was later to claim that Walpole had 'forced it upon him' in the belief that Compton 'had conceived too strong hopes of being [his] superior ever to serve in the House of Commons quietly under him, and that it might be dangerous, consequently, to suffer him in the chair of the new parliament' (Hervey, 1.39). Wilmington's slow-burning hatred of Walpole was never extinguished. Over the next few years he was one of several prominent members of the administration who, while outwardly supporting ministerial measures, privately maintained a dialogue with leading opposition whigs and tories. At the time of the parliamentary crisis over the French refortification of Dunkirk early in 1730, in which Walpole's majority in the Commons became seriously endangered, he was widely recognized as head of a coterie of senior whigs poised to take over whenever Walpole should fall from favour. During the subsequent reshuffling of Walpole's ministry in April, Wilmington was appointed lord privy seal, a surprise choice generally assumed to have been the king's, as against the known wishes of his first minister. Thus brought into the 'inner' or 'effective' cabinet of ministers, Wilmington formally took office on 14 May, and six days later was promoted in the peerage to the earldom of Wilmington. He was made a DCL at Oxford University on 5 August. Towards the end of December he was appointed lord president of the council, a post which placed him in charge of the administrative apparatus of the privy council. 
Wilmington was described by Lord Hervey in his 'Memoirs' as: 'a plodding, heavy fellow, with a great application, but no talents.... He was always more concerned for the manner and form in which a thing was to be done than about the propriety or expediency of the thing itself; and as he was to execute rather than project... so he was much fitter for a clerk to a minister. Whatever was resolved upon he would often know how properly to perform, but seldom how to advise what was proper to be resolved upon. (Hervey, 1.24)' In the House of Lords he barely ever spoke but never wavered from the ministerial line. His name was associated with a re-emergence of the old anti-ministerial faction in the summer of 1732, and during the excise crisis of March-April 1733 he and his kinsman the duke of Dorset threatened to resign their posts in protest against the proposed dismissals of other courtiers who opposed the scheme in parliament. Wilmington was won back by Walpole apparently with a renewed promise of the Garter. He received this on 12 June and was installed at St George's, Windsor, on 22 August. He had largely ceased by this stage to enjoy the close confidence of the king, though their continuing friendship kept him in office. At a time when a number of prominent peers had openly committed themselves to opposition, Wilmington's failure to follow suit rendered him odious in the eyes of leading opposition luminaries, one of whom, Lord Chesterfield, wrote in June 1734 that 'the President is as contemptible and subservient as ever' ('Letters', 2.281). 
Wilmington's next few years were spent quietly in the performance of his ministerial duties until the beginnings of dissension within the cabinet early in 1739 over policy towards Spain inspired fresh rumours of his intention to resign. Although by the summer of 1740 he and Dorset were regarded as titular leaders of one of three main ministerial factions, he avoided participation in the cabinet quarrels over strategic objectives in the war against Spain and continued at least outwardly to support Walpole. He did not refrain, however, from connivance with several of Walpole's enemies during the election campaign in the spring of 1741. Denying any personal ambition for himself, he once more became explicit in his censure of Walpolian power, and to acquaintances he privately expressed his view that 'the true interest of England was to have no chief minister... that every great office should be immediately dependent on the king and answer for itself' ('Egmont Diary', 3.250). Behind the scenes he advocated a new broadly constructed ministry that included opposition elements, believing that the king's power would be preserved thereby from future encroachment by particular ministers or factions. He took his part among the cabinet council members who towards the end of January 1742 quietly advised George II of the impossibility of conducting essential supply business in the Commons if Walpole continued in office; on 2 February Wilmington was summoned by the king and appointed in Walpole's place as first lord of the Treasury. 
From the first it was understood that Wilmington, now somewhat elderly and ill with the stone, would hand the effective work of managing the Treasury to a new chancellor of the exchequer. Although he was not at all qualified by political ability for this most senior of ministerial positions, his appointment bore all the marks of the calculation and shrewdness of others. The leading ministerialists Lord Hardwicke and the duke of Newcastle (quite possibly with Walpole's own connivance) had carefully manoeuvred William Pulteney, Walpole's chief opponent and his obvious successor, into rejecting the Treasury, all along smoothing the way for Wilmington as their desired choice. As the holder of a senior if largely non-powerful cabinet position, he was sufficiently far removed from Walpole, as well as being acceptable to the king. It was not until Wilmington had taken office, however, that his own 'broad bottom' views came into play and caused disturbance. Placing himself at odds with those who had been instrumental in his appointment, he joined the duke of Argyll and his sympathizers in demanding a new ministry that included leading tories in addition to former dissident whigs; but when on 13 February Wilmington found that Carteret had been appointed secretary of state (and effective head of the administration) without any prior consultation with himself, he confronted George II with a threat of resignation, dismayed that the ministry was being reconstructed substantially on its old narrow footing and with so many of Walpole's supporters still dominating the field. As ever, royal persuasion worked its effect on Wilmington and he remained in office. His own stewardship as premier was distinctly lacklustre, and in the time that was left to him he was no more than a ministerial figurehead presiding over a group of ministers among whom Lord Carteret, due to his influence with the king, was the real controlling force. 
Wilmington died on 2 July 1743 at his house in St James's Square, London, and was buried at Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, the resting place of many of his forebears. It had already been planned to replace him at the Treasury with Henry Pelham later in the year. Although he was unmarried, Wilmington was understood to have fathered several illegitimate children, one of whom was the wife of James Glen, for whom in 1739 Wilmington procured the governorship of South Carolina. He left his entire estate, most of it in Sussex, including his seat, Compton Place, Eastbourne, to his nephew James Compton, fifth earl of Northampton.

Compton, Spencer Joshua Alwyne, second marquess of Northampton (1790-1851), patron of science and the arts, was born on 2 January 1790 at Erlestoke Park, Wiltshire, the second son of Charles Compton, ninth earl and first marquess of Northampton, and Mary, only daughter of Joshua Smith, MP for Devizes. Educated privately by Edward Meyrick at Ramsbury, Wiltshire, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1808, where he studied mainly mathematics under George Frederick Tavel, his tutor. As a nobleman he proceeded to his MA in 1810 after only six terms in residence and without taking any examination. He subsequently received two honorary degrees (LLD, Cambridge, in 1835, and DCL, Oxford, in 1850). At Cambridge he acquired and cultivated wide intellectual tastes in science, literature, and the fine arts, and formed enduring friendships with such contemporaries as George Peacock, Adam Sedgwick, Thomas Musgrave, John Frederick William Herschel, and William Empson. 
In May 1812, shortly after the assassination of Spencer Perceval, the prime minister (and a relative), Lord Compton (as he styled himself) succeeded him as MP for Northampton and remained there until he lost the seat in the general election of 1820. Although his immediate relatives were all high tories, he soon showed his independence: a maverick tory, he would on occasion vote with the whigs and oppose his own party, which censured him as impractical and crotchety. Preferring direct to indirect taxation, he opposed the repeal of the property tax in 1816; and he supported Wilberforce's attempts to secure the total abolition of slavery in Africa, and James Mackintosh's work as a criminal law reformer. By 1819 he was at odds with both the foreign and home secretaries (Castlereagh and Sidmouth); the former accused him of 'turning his back on himself'. His whiggish tendencies were ascribed to the influence of his wife, Margaret Maclean Clephane, eldest daughter and heir of Major-General Douglas Maclean Clephane, whom he married on 24 July 1815. She was a poet, a great favourite of Sir Walter Scott, a good musician, and an accomplished artist. Although her poetry was praised by Wordsworth for its simplicity, pathos, and energy, it was never published, but was edited after her death by her husband, and printed privately in 1833. Theirs was a happy marriage and they had four sons and two daughters. 
From 1820 to 1830 Compton and his wife lived in Italy, often in Rome, where they not only pursued connoisseurship but also protected victims of despotism in Lombardy and Naples. Compton succeeded his father as marquess of Northampton on 24 May 1828, but remained in Italy until his stay was ended by domestic tragedy: after the birth of their sixth child, on 14 March 1830, his wife died suddenly on 2 April. Northampton returned to England, and thereafter lived mainly at Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire. After 1830 the rich, aristocratic widower began to transform himself into one of the 'good and the great' in polite cultural life. He was dutiful as a politician (supporting constitutional change in the early 1830s, and in 1832 announcing an unsuccessful bill to repeal the law under which an MP, if made a minister, had to vacate his seat and seek re-election), but he was not as active in the House of Lords as he had been in the Commons. Instead he devoted himself to the advancement of literature, the fine arts, archaeology, and, especially, science. 
Northampton gained some recognition as a minor poet, but his major venture in literature was to initiate and oversee 'The Tribute' (1837), a miscellany of poems published by subscription for the benefit of Edward Smedley, who was poor and severely ill. Northampton subscribed for twenty copies, but was offended when his assistant, Monckton Milnes, suggested he should read some proofs. From 1849 until his death Northampton was president of the Royal Society of Literature. In the field of antiquities and archaeology he was a minor performer and a major organizer. He was an accomplished draughtsman, and had a fine collection of Etruscan vases, but his forte was office holding: he was a trustee of the National Gallery and of the British Museum, and president of the Architectural Society of the Archdeaconry of Northampton. He was twice president of the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (in 1845-6 and in 1850-51) and was responsible for its name, which he coined after the British Archaeological Association (founded in 1843) had split in the spring of 1845, when a small faction seceded. He presided at the association's meeting in the summer and suggested, as an affordable concession, that its own title be changed to Archaeological Institute in order to prevent the seceding party (which retained the title of Association) from feeling aggrieved; characteristically he refrained from attacking the secessionists. 
It was this ability to avoid faction fighting and malice and to promote tactful reconciliation which facilitated Northampton's most notable achievement: in 1838 he was elected president of the Royal Society of London, which office he held until his resignation in 1848. Although he was not a leading scientist he had a sustained interest in geology, on which he published three short papers. His large collection of minerals (including Comptonite found near Vesuvius) and fossils at Castle Ashby was renowned. Conversation there was often focused on geology. Once his daughter, Marian ['see 'Egerton, Marianne Margaret, Viscountess Alford], later a well-known artist, revealed her exasperation with a long discussion about a motto for the Geological Society of London: her solution was to have for its crest a mole with the motto 'I bore'. To the end of his life Northampton remained a zealous hammerer for fossils: in 1849 his unflagging efforts astonished an Arundel chalk-pit worker who remarked 'That man doan't work for his living; if he went on that gate he could do nought next day' (Owen, 1.340). Northampton's house parties at Castle Ashby were useful rehearsals for the fashionable soirees he gave as president of the Royal Society in the large town house in Piccadilly which he inherited in the summer of 1838. He came to be president through his commitment to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (founded in 1831). In 1836 he became a nationally prominent cultural figure when his popular manners, oratory, and good humour made him a resounding success as president of the association, even though he was a last-minute substitute for the president-elect. Subsequently he was in great demand. In 1837 he became a vice-president of both the Royal Society and the Geological Society (having been an absentee president of the latter in 1820-22), and in the autumn of 1838 he replaced the duke of Sussex as president of the Royal Society, one wag commenting that the society had descended from royalty to the nobility. He remained deeply involved in the association's affairs, serving as its president in 1848 and ensuring that the Royal Society and the association acted in amity. As president of the Royal Society he was distinguished by his kindness, courtesy, good humour, patience, responsibility, and tact, as well as by his splendid hospitality, mastery of continental languages, and cultured mind. He avoided being a tyrant, a cipher, or a tool; but his reign saw one scandal and some great changes within the society. In 1845 a royal medal was awarded illegally to T. S. Beck, which led 'The Lancet' to denounce the society's council as 'the last Old Sarum of the scientific world' and Northampton (who admitted the council's error, though he was not personally involved in its irregularity) as an autocrat. Although he was not an innovator by temperament or conviction, Northampton did not oppose reform when it was widely supported. In 1847 the age of the almost exclusively scientific Royal Society began, largely as a result of the efforts of William Grove and Leonard Horner: each year only fifteen fellows were to be elected from a list drawn up by the council. Northampton acquiesced in such changes but deplored what he regarded as the ill-mannered and offensive conduct of the reformers. Early in 1848 he showed his chagrin by resigning as president, thoughtfully giving the reformed society nine months in which to find a successor. 
For several years Northampton was afflicted by an illness which caused him to spit blood. He was deeply affected by the death of his son-in-law, Lord Alford, on 3 January 1851, and was discovered dead in bed on the morning of the 17th, at Castle Ashby, where he was buried on the 25th.

Compton, Thomas (1592-1666), Jesuit, was born in Cambridgeshire, the son of Richard Compton and Anne Fludd. The Comptons were a well-to-do Catholic family and the name Compton (or Compton Carleton) figures prominently in lists of early seventeenth-century Jesuits. Like some of his brothers Thomas Compton went to the continent in order to become a priest; he stayed at the English Jesuit college at St Omer from 1606 until 1611. Together with his brother Henry he subsequently moved to the English College at Madrid. In June 1614 all the English students were transferred to Valladolid in order to continue their studies at the College of St Alban. After three years at Valladolid, Thomas Compton was ordained priest. He was received into the Society of Jesus at Liege in September 1617. The two years of his noviciate at Liege were followed by further studies in France, which prepared him for a teaching career at the Jesuit colleges of St Omer and Liege. During the years 1622-6 he taught a number of basic subjects, such as grammar, syntax, poetry, and rhetoric, at St Omer. On 21 May 1628 he completed his training as a Jesuit by being professed of the four vows at Liege, where he became professor of philosophy and theology and prefect of studies. Apart from a short stay at St Omer in 1631 he remained at Liege for the rest of his life. The contradictory information in Foley about the date of his ordination and his whereabouts in 1625 must be due to his being confused with another member of the Compton Carleton family (Foley, 7.154). 
In his entry on Compton, Southwell praises him for his great gifts as a teacher. These gifts are discernible in the handbooks on philosophy and theology that he published. 'Philosophia universa' (Antwerp, 1649) is a well-organized treatment of the main branches of philosophy; 'Prometheus Christianus' (Antwerp, 1652) surveys the field of moral philosophy on the basis of nineteen 'disputationes' and contains an address to Compton's pupils at Liege; and 'Cursus Theologici tomus prior/tomus posterior' (Liege, 1659-64) is a monumental two-volume theological handbook of more than 1000 pages. The many subsequent editions of his works and two posthumous publications dealing with Aristotelian philosophy testify to his reputation. He died at Liege on 24 March 1666.

Compton, Sir William (1482?-1528), courtier, was the son and heir of Edmund Compton of Compton, Warwickshire; he was described as eleven years old and more on his father's death in 1493. According to Dugdale he became a page to Prince Henry, duke of York, and in due course a deep and lasting friendship grew between them. In 1510, a year after Henry's accession to the throne, Compton was first described as groom of the stool, and he served until 1526 as one of the king's most important and intimate personal servants, jousting with the king (nearly losing his life in 1510), keeping the king's linen, holding and disbursing large sums of money for the king's daily purchases. Compton was often entrusted with delicate tasks by Henry: enquiring on his behalf how far the fifth earl of Northumberland's marriage plans had gone, arranging for the king to meet a mistress, arresting the duke of Buckingham. He served in the military campaign of 1513 (he was knighted after the capture of Tournai in September) and on the Scottish borders in 1523. 
Compton did enormously well out of the king's service, holding many offices; he became constable of several royal castles in the midlands, including Warwick, Sudeley, Kenilworth, and Fulbrook, and was variously bailiff, keeper, receiver, and steward on crown lands, taking what Wolsey, after Compton's death, described as 'excessive fees' (TNA: PRO, SP 1/49, fol. 75). He leased or received crown lands on a notable scale, ruthlessly exploiting his royal favour in disputes with Margaret Pole, countess of Salisbury, Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, and Richard Grey, third earl of Kent, and embezzled jewels and gilt plate properly the king's. He bought up lands aggressively, possibly pressurizing a reluctant Buckingham to sell him a series of manors in 1520, and possibly being committed for a short time to the Fleet prison following complaints by Sir Henry Grey. By the end of his life he had built up a landed estate, centred on the south midlands, whose gross income in 1524-5 was $1689. It provided the basis for the peerage granted by Queen Elizabeth to Sir William's grandson Henry Compton. The latter's descendants, the marquesses of Northampton, have continued to live in the picture-book early Tudor country house built by Sir William Compton at Compton Wynyates in Warwickshire. 
Compton does not appear to have played much part in the government of the realm and the administration of the localities. His posts as JP in Hertfordshire (1511-14), in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire (all from 1511), and in Somerset (from 1513), as sheriff (notably sheriff of Worcestershire for life from 1516), and as chancellor of Ireland (1513-16) measure his standing rather than describe his activities. The same can be said of his chancellorship of Ireland between 1513 and 1516. Polydore Vergil believed that Compton's favour with the king made Cardinal Wolsey fearful, so much so that in 1523 he had Compton dispatched to the wars on the Scottish borders so that in his absence Wolsey 'might gradually cause him to be hateful to Henry' ('Anglica historia', 308-9). But military service was a natural step in the evolution from upstart courtier to landed magnate. Possibly Wolsey was responsible for Compton's resignation as groom of the stool in 1526, as part of the reforms known as the Eltham ordinances, but since Compton was then appointed usher of receipts in the exchequer and granted a licence allowing him to wear his hat in the royal presence, and since there is no sign that he lost his influence with the king, perhaps he did not regret the loss of a post too humble for the magnate he had now become. 
There is nothing to suggest that Compton was interested in the concerns of government -- that he was for or against war with France, or that he had views on taxation or on how Ireland should be governed or the church reformed -- nor did he attempt to build up any kind of personal following or to displace Cardinal Wolsey. Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Henry VIII's biographer in the 1640s, summed him up well as 'being more attentive to his profit, than publique affairs' (Herbert, 8). In 1512 Compton married Werburga, widow of Sir Francis Cheyne and daughter of Sir John Brereton and his wife, Katherine, sister and heir of Sir William Berkeley. That he received several manors as a royal gift suggests that the king may well have played a part in the marriage. Wolsey in his capacity of legate later cited Compton for living in adultery with Lord Hastings's wife and for having taken the sacrament to disprove it. He died of sweating sickness in June 1528, leaving a son, Peter, aged six.

Compton, Sir William (1625-1663), army officer, was born at Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, the third son of Spencer Compton, second earl of Northampton (1601-1643), and his wife, Mary Beaumont (died 1654), daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont. He was educated at Eton College (1634-6), and in his eighteenth year joined his father's royalist regiment, and served with it at the taking of Banbury on 8 August 1642. He led his men in three attacks, and had two horses shot under him during the fighting. Upon the surrender of the town and castle he was made lieutenant-governor under his father, and brought over many to the king's interest. He was knighted at Oxford on 12 December 1643. William and his elder brother James Compton, third earl of Northampton, worked together uneasily. James blamed William for the capture of the family home, Compton Wynyates, on 9 June 1644 because he had refused to accept James's nominated governor, placing an inexperienced colleague in command. In July 1644 Banbury was besieged by parliamentarian forces from Northamptonshire, Warwick, and Coventry, but Compton resisted the leaguer for three months in what was regarded as a heroic and inspiring defence until his brother, Northampton, raised the siege on 26 October. Compton remained as governor of Banbury until after the king left Oxford, when he was ordered to surrender the garrison, which he did on 8 May 1646, receiving good terms: all officers were allowed to keep their horses, swords, goods, and money, and were given safe conduct. 
A landowner in Kent, in 1648 Compton became embroiled in the Kentish rebellion, serving as major-general under George Goring, earl of Norwich. After the defeat at the battle of Maidstone and the failure to gain access to London, Norwich's shrinking army turned towards Essex. When rebellion broke out at Chelmsford on 4 June parliament moved quickly to pardon the rebels on condition they did not support Norwich. The earl dashed to Chelmsford to enlist the rebels' support, leaving Compton in command at Bow Bridge, where he cut communications between London and Essex. On 8 June Norwich and Compton led their forces to Brentwood, where they joined the Essex rebels, and thereafter Compton's role was overshadowed by the military leadership of Sir Charles Lucas, who led the forces to Colchester to raise support. The royalists became trapped in the town when Fairfax and the New Model made a lightning march to the county, enduring siege from 13 June until 28 August. By the end of July they, and the townspeople, were reduced to eating cats and dogs. Upon surrender Compton was not singled out for court martial, unlike Lucas and others, who were shot. Oliver Cromwell is said to have referred to him as 'the sober young man, and the godly cavalier', and he escaped with a fine of $600. 
Even so, Compton was involved in royalist conspiracies from the inception of the republic, and in 1650 was felt to be crucial to Kent royalists' plans to seize Dover Castle. About 1651 he married Elizabeth Alington (died 1671), widow of William, Baron Alington of Horseheath, Cambridgeshire, and sister of Sir Lionel Tollemache, who was married to Elizabeth Murray, countess of Dysart, one of the principal female intriguers of the period. Thereafter he resided in Cambridgeshire. From May 1654 onwards he was one of the six men who comprised the Sealed Knot, the secret organization which aimed to co-ordinate royalist risings. In 1655 he promised the Knot's reluctant support for Penruddock's rebellion, although no practical assistance was provided. Despite this Compton had to stay away from his Cambridgeshire home throughout the summer. Eventually he surrendered voluntarily to the government through the mediation of his brother-in-law Sir Lionel Tollemache. He was held only briefly, but thereafter the authorities kept records of his movements. He may have remained quiescent during 1656, but in the following year was embroiled in the Knot's discussions with the Leveller John Wildman. Compton played no major role in the plotting of the marquess of Ormond and Daniel O'Neill in early 1658, but in April he was arrested and placed in the Tower with fellow Knot members Sir Richard Willys and Colonel John Russell. Upon their release in July all three were warned by secretary Thurloe to expect no quarter if they were involved in future plots. Compton seems to have taken this to heart and his involvement in the conspiracies surrounding Booth's rising appear to have been minimal, even though his brother, the earl of Northampton, was briefly engaged in support for the national rising. 
With the Restoration Compton was returned to parliament for the borough of Cambridge (11 March 1661), and appointed master of the ordnance by Charles II. He was a fairly active MP in the early sessions of the Cavalier Parliament. He died suddenly in Drury Lane, London, on 18 October 1663, and was buried at Compton Wynyates, where a monument was erected to his memory. Pepys recorded his shock at the death of 'one of the worthiest men and best officers of state now in England'. Compton, Pepys thought, was 'of the best temper, valour, abilities of mind, integrity, birth, fine person and diligence of any man he hath left behind him in the three kingdoms' (Pepys, 4.338-9).

Comrie, Alexander (1706-1774), theological writer, was born on 16 December 1706 in Perth, the son of Patrick Comrie, an attorney, and Rachell Vause. His parents wanted him to follow his great-grandfather Andrew Gray and his mother's stepfather, George Hutcheson, into the Presbyterian ministry. As a youth, Comrie was catechized by Ebenezer and Ralph Erskine, and greatly influenced by the writings of Thomas Boston. 
Comrie postponed his studies at the age of twenty because of financial hardship. He went to the Netherlands, where he worked for A. van der Willigen, a Rotterdam merchant. Three years later he enrolled at Groningen University, where he studied under Anthonias Driessen and Cornelius van Velsen. In 1733 he transferred to Leiden to study philosophy under W. J. 's-Gravensande. He was awarded a doctorate in philosophy in 1734 after completing a critical study of the thought of Descartes, entitled 'De moralitatis fundamento et natura virtutis'. 
Comrie was then elected minister of the parish of Woubrugge, where he was pastor for thirty-eight years until 1773, the year before his death, faithfully working among people who deeply appreciated his zeal for the Calvinist faith of the Dutch Second Reformation church. He married three times: first, on 15 August 1737, to Johanna de Heyde (1710-1738), who died shortly after giving birth to their only child, Rachel Cornelia (1738-1774); second, to Maria van der Pijll (died 1764) on 25 April 1741; and finally to Catharina de Reus (1722-1809) on 2 December 1766. Rachel Cornelia Comrie married Gerhardus Boufy from Schiedam, but died aged thirty-six, only two months before Comrie's own death. 
Comrie was even more influential as a writer than as a preacher. Like Voetius, he aimed to unite and promote Reformation doctrine, scholastic methodology, and scriptural piety through his writing. He took on four major tasks, the first of which was to help church members progress in reformed, experiential truth, to which end a collection of his sermons was published in 1749 ('Verzameling van leerredenen'). Secondly, he devoted several treatises to the doctrine of faith and its relationship to justification and assurance. He wrote a book on various biblical terms that describe faith, published as 'Het A.B.C. des geloofs' in 1739 (translated as 'The ABC of Faith', 1978); a major work on the scriptural properties of saving faith ('Verhandeling van eenige eigenschappen des zaligmakenden geloofs', 1744); a commentary on the first seven Lord's days of the Heidelberg catechism ('Stellige en praktikale verklaaring van den Heidelbergschen catechismus', 1753); and an extended tract on justification of sinners by direct imputation ('Brief over de rechtvaardigmakinge des zondaars', 1761). His distinction between the principle or habit ('habitus') of faith and the exercise or act ('actus') of faith served as the foundation of his doctrine of faith. By emphasizing the principle of faith, he promoted divine grace as the sole cause of faith. He taught that the principle of faith is exercised by knowledge, assent, and trust. 
To promote puritan piety, which was his third objective, Comrie translated several important volumes from English into Dutch. These included Thomas Shepard's 'The Ten Virgins', Walter Marshall's 'Gospel Mystery of Sanctification', Thomas Boston's 'The Covenant of Grace', and George Hutcheson's 'Brief Exposition of the Twelve Small Prophets'. Finally, Comrie defended reformed theology against neonomianism, Arminianism, and rationalism. By focusing on the habit of faith, Comrie aimed to prevent Calvinism from lapsing into neonomianism, which taught that the gospel is a 'new law' ('neonomos') that a sinner must obey by faith, and that this obedience, together with the righteousness of Christ, is the ground of justification. In opposition to Arminianism, Comrie, with Nicolaus Holtius, produced two volumes of dialogues against efforts to reconcile Calvinism and Arminianism by departing from the doctrinal standards of the Dutch Reformed church ('Examen van het ontwerp van tolerantie', 1753-9). He also wrote against ministers and professors who were advocating rationalism, including Antonius van der Os ('Aanspraak aan Antonius van der Os', 1753) and Jan van den Honert ('Banieren van wegen de waarheid opgeregt tegen den Heer Jan van den Honert', 1753). 
Van der Os, minister of Zwolle, had declared that no church confessions had power to decide in matters of faith, for the scriptures were the true rule, and each man was at liberty to receive them according to his individual interpretation. He also argued that the Synod of Dort did not mean to set forth truth for all time, but only until further light should be obtained. Van den Honert questioned the fundamental doctrine of justification by faith, which Comrie felt involved the surrender of all that Luther and Calvin had taught on the subject. Despite the strenuous opposition of Comrie and his friends, rationalism advanced steadily among the clergy and professors. But the people of the Netherlands for the most part remained faithful to the gospel that Comrie preached. Today his name is still recognized and his books are still read in the Netherlands by those who advocate reformed, experiential faith. Comrie spent the last months of his life as a pastoral assistant in Gouda, where he died on 10 December 1774, and was buried.

Comyn, Alexander, sixth earl of Buchan (d. 1289), baron and administrator, was the eldest son of William Comyn, earl of Buchan (died 1233), and his second wife, Marjory, in her own right countess of Buchan. Alexander, who became earl of Buchan after his mother's death about 1244, was a member of a large family, with two brothers, William and Fergus, and three sisters: Elizabeth, who married William, earl of Mar; Idonea, who married Gilbert de la Hay; and Agnes, who married Philip Meldrum. He was also half-brother to: Richard; Walter Comyn, lord of Badenoch, who became earl of Menteith on his marriage to Isabella, daughter and heir of Maurice, earl of Menteith, in 1233 or 1234; William, a clerk; David, who married Isabel de Valognes, lady of East Kilbride; and Jean, who married William, earl of Ross. 
Alexander Comyn's control over the earldom of Buchan was exercised through key castles at Kingedward, Dundarg (Aberdour), Cairnbulg (Philorth), Rattray, Slains, and Ellon. Ellon was the legal centre of the earldom; Deer Abbey (founded by his father 'c'.1219) the religious centre; Kelly, with its enclosed park for hunting, the domestic centre; and Newburgh the main burgh. He also had considerable landed power outside Buchan, including a manor house on the banks of the River Tay, near Scone, lands in Fife, and Mortlach, which with its important castle of Balvenie, Banffshire, formed an important link with the lands of the Badenoch branch of the family. In addition, his marriage to Elizabeth, one of three daughters and coheirs of the great Anglo-Scottish magnate Roger de Quincy (died 1264), brought him estates in Fife, Galloway, Dumfriesshire, and Lothian, as well as much land in England, especially in the midlands. Having bought the office of constable in 1274 or 1275, Earl Alexander also added the constable lands in Perth, Clackmannan, Inverness, and Cowie, near Stonehaven, to his landholding. He was thus one of the great Anglo-Scottish barons. He was not entirely an absentee landlord in England and appeared at Shepshed, his important administrative centre in the midlands, in 1282, but he conducted his English business chiefly through attorneys and increasingly through his sons John (in Leicestershire and Warwickshire) and Roger (in Northamptonshire). Earl Alexander's interests were essentially Scottish (and especially northern Scottish) -- his religious patronage included the foundation of two almshouses in Buchan (at Newburgh and Turriff) and benefactions to Deer Abbey, Arbroath, Lindores, Inchcolm, Scone, and St Andrews. 
Alexander Comyn had appeared in the Scottish royal circle by 1240, and he was prominent in Comyn party activities under the leadership of his half-brother Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith, in the disturbed years 1242-58, participating in the hounding of the Bissets, potential rivals in the north, between 1242 and 1244. Alexander II sought to curb the power which the Comyn party thus displayed by appointing Alan Durward to be justiciar of Scotia, an increasingly important office of state. The Durwards, too, were rivals of the Comyns in northern Scotland, and Alan's attempt to strengthen his political position during the minority of Alexander III after 1249 was regarded by the Comyns as a threat to their political leadership. However, the Comyns gained control of Scottish government in 1251 following the intervention of Henry III, and Earl Alexander's prominence in the Comyn party was shown by his appointment as justiciar of Scotia from 1253. He thus followed his father, who had held this office from 'c'.1205 to 1233. After his removal from office, with the rest of the Comyn government, following an anti-Comyn coup in 1255, Earl Alexander participated in the Comyn counter-coup of 1257 and appeared again as justiciar of Scotia in the treaty made by Comyn supporters with the Welsh princes in 1258. He retained this office when a compromise government, made up of both Comyn and opposing elements, was established in 1258, and he remained one of the crown's leading advisers until his death in 1289. He also became the political leader of the Comyn party after Earl Walter of Menteith's death in 1258. Earl Alexander contributed greatly to the strengthening of royal authority in the south-west and north of the Scottish kingdom. He had a military role in 1263 against the Norwegian threat and contributed to the reorganization of royal control in the south-west and north, taking the offices of sheriff of Wigtown, sheriff of Dingwall, and baillie of Inverie (Knoydart) between 1263 and 1266, while in 1282 he was dispatched by Alexander III on important (though unspecified) business to the remote parts of the Scottish isles. 
After 1258 Earl Alexander, who dominates witness lists to Alexander III's acts, was the leader of a responsible aristocratic community in effective support of the crown. In 1281 he participated in negotiations for the marriage between Alexander III's daughter, Margaret, and Erik, king of Norway, and in 1284 affirmed the recognition of the child of this marriage, the Maid of Norway, as Alexander III's heir presumptive. Following Alexander III's death in 1286, the earl, who had been involved in the minority of Alexander III and was behind plans for an emergency council in 1260-61 when Queen Margaret went to England for her confinement, was the most experienced of the six guardians elected to govern the country on behalf of the absent Maid of Norway. Earl Alexander died in 1289, after 10 July. He had a large family, four sons -- John Comyn (d. 1308), his successor, who married Isabel, daughter of Colban, earl of Fife; Roger; Alexander, who married Joan Latimer; and Master William, provost of St Mary's, St Andrews -- and five daughters: Marjory (or Marjorie), who was married to Patrick Dunbar, seventh earl of Dunbar ['see under 'Dunbar, Patrick, eighth earl of Dunbar or of March (1285-1369)]; Emma, who was married to Malise Strathearn, earl of Strathearn; Elizabeth, who married Gilbert de Umfraville, earl of Angus; Elena, who was married to William Brechin; and another, married to Nicholas de Soulis.

Cumin, John (d. 1212), archbishop of Dublin and royal servant, may have come from a minor Somerset family. Certainly it is in connection with this county that his name first appears in the official records: in 1158 and 1159 John Cumin was pardoned debts in Somerset and excused from payments to the sheriffs of Somerset and Worcester. 
In 1163 Cumin was present at the Council of Woodstock and witnessed a royal confirmation to the prior and convent of Burton Priory. It seems likely that by this date he had already been in the king's service for a number of years, as at the end of 1163 he represented Henry II at the court of Frederick Barbarossa, a task that would only have been performed by a skilled and trusted official. 
Cumin's services were frequently used during the dispute between the king and the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket. In 1166 he was sent to Rome to request that papal legates be dispatched to England with powers to resolve the dispute. Later this same year he was rewarded with the archdeaconry of Bath, which Pope Alexander III ordered him to resign, as he had obtained the office through lay authority. However, he continued to hold the archdeaconry until at least 1174 and perhaps until 1182 when Peter of Blois was granted the office. The pipe rolls for 1169-73 show that Cumin was active as an itinerant justice in the west country and also that he was custodian of the temporalities of Hereford from 1166 to 1172. 
Towards the end of 1170 Cumin was sent to Rome with the task of obtaining absolution from the pope for the archbishop of York and the bishops of London and Salisbury, who had been excommunicated by Thomas Becket. Cumin himself appears on a list of those excommunicated by Becket at about the same time. He was in the middle of negotiations when news of Becket's murder was brought to Italy. Cumin returned quickly to the king's side and was with Henry in Normandy in July 1171. Later in the same year he resumed his activities as an itinerant justice in England. During the following years Henry II continued to send him on diplomatic missions to France and Spain. At the Council of Windsor in 1179 he was appointed as a judge for northern England. In the years 1179-81 he is frequently mentioned as being responsible for the transportation of the king's treasure, usually in the company of the chamberlain, although on one occasion he is himself called chamberlain. 
John Cumin held the prebend of Hoxton in St Paul's, London, but apart from this and the archdeaconry of Bath he does not seem to have achieved that accumulation of ecclesiastical benefices so characteristic of royal clerks of the time. He possessed only deacon's orders, and on the face of it his election to the archbishopric of Dublin in the abbey of Evesham in September 1181 was a spectacular promotion. It must be seen as primarily an affirmation of Henry II's belief in his abilities and trust in his loyalty. A key element in Cumin's preferment over other, possibly better qualified, candidates was his loyalty to the king during the Becket dispute. It was vital for the crown's policy in Ireland that the vacancy in the strategically important see of Dublin be filled by a trusted servant. 
According to Gerald of Wales the representatives of the Dublin clergy who elected John Cumin at Evesham were 'reasonably united in their choice' ('Expugnatio', 198-9). The election did however take place in the presence of the king who clearly made his preference known. Cumin's movements immediately after the election are not known. As Pope Alexander III had died shortly before the Evesham election, it is likely that the archbishop-elect remained with the king in England until the election of Pope Lucius III was confirmed. Cumin then made his way to the new pope's court at Velletri, where he arrived in February 1182. He was ordained to the priesthood on 13 March and a week later was consecrated archbishop of Dublin by the pope. 
Pope Lucius sent the new archbishop a very comprehensive confirmation of his lands and dignities. The document also included a detailed prohibition of certain abuses concerning the holding of ecclesiastical benefices and chaplaincies which were then apparently prevalent in the Dublin diocese. This prohibition indicates that Cumin had familiarized himself with practices in his new diocese, but it is not known if he obtained the information through a personal visit in the months after his election or through discussion with a well-informed source. 
Cumin then returned to England and spent some time following the peregrinations of the royal court. His first securely recorded visit to his diocese came some years after his appointment, when in the autumn of 1184 he was dispatched to Ireland to prepare the way for John's forthcoming visit. He was present at Waterford in April 1185 to welcome John and it was in Waterford that the archbishop received his first grant of land from the prince. During the period in which he acted as John's adviser Cumin lost no opportunity to consolidate and extend the temporal possessions of his new diocese, which he appears to have considered rather small and poor. When John arrived in Dublin he granted to the archbishop the lands and possessions of the bishopric of Glendalough, on account of the smallness and poverty of the Dublin church. 
Cumin remained in Ireland after John's return and seriously began the work of administering his diocese and province. One of his first acts was to call a provincial council which opened in Christ Church, Dublin, on 30 March 1186. It was attended by the suffragan bishops and major religious superiors of the province and the opening sermon, on the church's sacraments, was given by the archbishop himself. The canons of the council are preserved in a confirmation of Pope Urban III dated 5 March 1187. Although they show many similarities with English statutes of the same period, they have a definite Irish tone and frequently refer to the Irish church and its special problems. The papal confirmation mentions the archbishop's concern that the people whom he was sent to govern were badly instructed in divine law, and it seems likely that the canons were for the most part Cumin's own work and reflect his pastoral concerns. 
The archbishop did not, however, regard his presence in the diocese as essential for bringing about reform. Cumin left Dublin some time in 1186 and remained in England until 1190 when he attended the coronation of Richard I at Winchester. During this time he showed the same concern with augmenting the possessions and privileges of his see and received a series of charters and grants from John. Following the death of his patron Henry II the archbishop lessened his involvement with the royal court, and when he returned to his see in 1190 he devoted his energy to ecclesiastical administration. 
In 1191 Cumin issued a charter concerning the elevation of the parish church of St Patrick to collegiate status. This church was situated on land that had been granted to him by John and it was here that the archbishop also began the building of the archiepiscopal palace of St Sepulchre. The consecration ceremony of St Patrick's took place on 17 March 1192 and was attended by the archbishops of Armagh and Cashel, as well as many other ecclesiastics. By founding a secular college Cumin provided Dublin with a convenient resource for the rewarding of royal clerics like himself, although some credence must also be given to his stated aim of desiring to improve the educational standards of the people of his diocese. It is not clear whether the archbishop intended that St Patrick's be elevated to cathedral status; his later, enforced absence from Dublin makes it difficult to reconstruct his motives. There is no evidence that he discriminated against the regular cathedral chapter of Holy Trinity, rather, in all ways he treated it as the cathedral church of his diocese. Furthermore he sponsored the extensive rebuilding of the cathedral which was carried out between 1186 and 1200, perhaps bringing over stone and workers from his native Somerset. 
Most of the important acts of Cumin's episcopate can be dated to the years 1191-6 when he maintained more or less constant residence in his diocese. Many of his activities were concerned with extending the temporal boundaries of his see or with ensuring that no other jurisdiction infringed upon it. Thus he took measures to lessen the control exercised by the bishop of Clogher over the Augustinian house of All Hallows, Dublin. He also cut the ties between the Augustinian convent of Grace Dieu and its mother house of Clonard in the diocese of Meath by moving it to a new residence in Lusk and generously re-endowing it. During these years the archbishop also took further steps towards the unification of the dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough. 
In 1197 the career of this loyal servant of the crown took an unexpected turn when he became embroiled in a serious dispute with Hamo de Valognes (died 1202/3), the Irish justiciar, which resulted in his exile from Dublin for a period of nine years. The initial cause of the dispute is unclear, but it appears that dissension first arose over the question of royal forest rights in lands newly acquired by the archbishop. The agreement that was finally brokered in 1205 certainly refers to this issue. However, the dispute quickly escalated into a full-scale confrontation between the archbishop and the justiciar. Cumin threatened Valognes with ecclesiastical censure and he replied by confiscating some of the temporal possessions of the diocese. The archbishop then excommunicated Valognes and several of his officials and left for England having placed Dublin under interdict. 
Cumin spent the next few years following the movements of the royal court, seeking unsuccessfully to have his grievances redressed. The situation worsened after the accession of King John in 1199, with the temporalities of Dublin being taken into the king's hand and the archbishop banned from the entire realm. Cumin then turned to Rome and found in Innocent III a determined champion of his rights. However it was not until 1205 that King John, faced with the threat of papal excommunication and interdict, gave way and agreed to restore to the archbishop his full liberties and temporal possessions. During his prolonged exile Cumin appears to have spent some time in Paris where Gerald of Wales recalls meeting him. Innocent III paints a colourful though perhaps exaggerated picture of the exile as a feeble old man forced to beg for his needs. 
Given that John Cumin's career as a royal official can be traced from the 1150s he must have been fairly advanced in years when he returned to Dublin in 1206. The remaining six years of his episcopate passed without incident and he died in October 1212 'senex et plenus dierum' (Gilbert, 2.279). He was buried in the church of Holy Trinity, whose monks had supported him in his battle with the crown. An early thirteenth-century effigy of an archbishop in St Lawrence's Chapel has been tentatively identified as that of John Cumin. 
Gerald of Wales writes that John Cumin would have made outstanding improvements in the condition of the Irish church 'if his spiritual sword had not been continuously checked by the sword of the temporal power' ('Expugnatio', 198-9). There is a certain irony in the fact that a man who had so effectively advanced his career prospects by remaining faithful to the king during the Becket dispute should find himself, like Becket, exiled from his church and appealing to Rome for help, even if the liberties that Cumin so resolutely defended were related to the lands of his diocese rather than to the dignity of his episcopal office. 
While Cumin's episcopate was certainly troubled and greatly occupied with temporal affairs, he did demonstrate a genuine concern for the spiritual well-being of his flock. The canons of the provincial council of 1186 display an awareness of and willingness to address the particular problems of the church in Ireland which had exercised the native reform party. He played a large part in the introduction of the complex machinery of Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical administration into the Dublin province, a process that was to be completed by his successors.

Comyn, John, lord of Badenoch (d. c.1277), magnate, was the son of Richard Comyn (died 1244x9), and was also nephew (and heir) to Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith (d. 1258), and nephew to Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1289). John had two brothers, William and Richard. He was twice married, his first wife being Eva, his second Alicia (probably de Lindsay, of Lamberton). 
John Comyn had inherited important lands in Tynedale in Northumberland and in southern Scotland (in Dumfriesshire, Roxburghshire, and Peeblesshire) by 'c'.1250, and the lordships of Badenoch and Lochaber in northern Scotland after 1258. The Tynedale and southern Scottish lands had been acquired by John's great-grandfather Richard (died 1178), who founded the family's secular fortunes through favour with the Scottish royal family. Richard's son, William, extended the family's landed acquisitions northwards through the lordships of Lenzie and Kirkintilloch ('c'.1200), the earldom of Buchan ('c'.1212), and the lordship of Badenoch ('c'.1229) for his son Walter (the future earl of Menteith). William had two wives and two large families. The earldom of Buchan, which he acquired through marriage to his second wife, Countess Marjory, was inherited by Alexander, the eldest son of this marriage. The Tynedale and southern Scottish lands, with the Badenoch lordship, descended to John Comyn through Walter Comyn, the eldest surviving son of William Comyn's first marriage. After Walter's death in 1258, John gained the headship of the senior, Badenoch, branch of the family and became the first Red Comyn. This sobriquet, derived from the heraldic colour of the Badenoch branch of the family, was handed down to his successors as head of the senior branch, to his son John Comyn, known as the Competitor (d. c.1302), and to his grandson, another John Comyn (d. 1306). Comyn failed, however, to inherit the earldom of Menteith after first accusing the countess and her new husband, Sir John Russell, of poisoning Earl Walter in 1258, and then forcing them to resign the earldom. The compromise decision reached by the king and a Comyn-dominated council in 1260-61 was to give the earldom to Walter Stewart (died 'c'.1296). 
John Comyn had been a regular member of a Comyn 'party' under the leadership of Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith, his uncle, in the politically disturbed years 1242-58, when the power of the Comyns in the north was threatened by the Bisset and Durward families, and their political dominance of the aristocratic community was threatened by Alexander II's appointment of Alan Durward as justiciar of Scotia 'c'.1244. John Comyn personally participated in the hounding of the Bissets in 1242 and with other members of the Comyn following made a bond of good behaviour in 1244. The death of Alexander II in 1249 and the minority of Alexander III ('r'. 1249-86) intensified the rivalry between the Comyns under Earl Walter and their opponents, especially Alan Durward, for political leadership in Scotland. When the Comyns regained control of Scottish government, with English help, in 1251, John Comyn was part of this government. When they lost this leadership in 1255, John Comyn participated in the kidnapping of the young Alexander III and his queen during the successful counter-coup of 1257, and was named as justiciar of Galloway in the Comyn-led confederation of nobles which made a treaty with the Welsh princes in 1258. 
The decision to curb John Comyn's power in 1260-61, by not allowing him to succeed to the earldom of Menteith, was an acknowledgement by the magnates, including fellow Comyns, that John's reputation for bellicose behaviour was substantially true. Fordun regarded him as 'a man prone to robbery and rashness' ('Chronica gentis Scottorum', 2.293). The setback of 1260-61 probably explains why John Comyn appeared irregularly in the royal circle during the 1260s. Instead he sought advancement and adventure in England. He was in the English royal household in 1262, 1264, and 1265, and fought for Henry III at the battle of Lewes in 1264, where he was captured. The English records from 1260 to 1275 testify to the rich rewards available. Comyn received a confirmation of his important Tynedale lands in 1262 and permission to fortify his Northumberland manor house at Tarset in 1267. He was given numerous privileges in the royal forests, a yearly fee of $50, and in 1266 was promised (though never received) 300 librates of land 'for his faithful service' ('CPR', '1258-66', 551). 
Comyn's military expertise featured further in Scottish record. In 1269 he upset the earl of Atholl by building a castle at Blair in Atholl. The matter was settled by the king and his council. It seems that two great castles of Badenoch and Lochaber, namely Lochindorb and Inverlochy -- with Ruthven a possible third -- were also founded by John Comyn and that, with Blair, they formed part of a strategic castle building plan in the north. Comyn featured prominently as justiciar of Galloway in a royal expedition against Man in 1275. 
John Comyn, who was a benefactor to Melrose Abbey and to the churches at Durham and Glasgow, died 'c'.1277. He left five sons: John the Competitor, who married Eleanor (Marjory), sister of John de Balliol, the future king of Scots; William, lord of Kirkintilloch; Alexander; another John (died 'c'.1295); and Robert (died 1306). According to Andrew Wyntoun, he had four daughters (the 'Scots peerage' mentions a fifth), who married Richard Siward, Geoffrey Mowbray, Alexander of Argyll, and Andrew Murray, father of the Andrew Murray who died in 1297.

Comyn, Sir John, lord of Badenoch (d. c.1302), magnate and claimant to the Scottish throne, was the eldest son of John Comyn (d. c.1277) and his first wife, Eva. Between about 1270 and 1275, he married Eleanor (called Marjory in Scottish sources), sister of John de Balliol ['see 'John], the future king of Scots, and he was also brother-in-law to Alexander MacDougall, lord of Argyll (d. 1310), making a formidable Comyn-MacDougall alliance in the north. John Comyn inherited the headship of the Comyns' senior, Badenoch, branch and became the second Red Comyn. His landed power included: Badenoch and Lochaber, with chief castles at Ruthven, Lochindorb, and Inverlochy; influence in Atholl, possibly including the castle at Blair Atholl; Bedrule and Scraesburgh, Roxburghshire; Dalswinton, with its castle, in Dumfriesshire; Findogask and Ochtertyre in Perthshire; Machan in the Clyde valley; and Lenzie and Kirkintilloch in Dunbartonshire after his brother William's death (after 'c'.1290). He also had charge of the castles of Jedburgh and Clunie from Alexander III; and in England he had Tarset and Thornton in Tynedale, Northumberland, and Ulseby in Lincolnshire. He was religious patron to Inchaffray, Cambuskenneth, and Coupar Angus abbeys. 
John Comyn was knighted by Alexander III in 1270, and was present in the royal circle at Selkirk in 1276. He swore to observe the marriage settlement between Margaret, Alexander III's daughter, and King Erik of Norway at Roxburgh in 1281, and in 1284 acknowledged the child of this marriage, Margaret, the Maid of Norway, as heir presumptive to Alexander III. When Alexander III died in 1286, Comyn was elected one of the six 'guardians' of the realm. He was chosen, according to John Fordun, as one of three guardians from south of the Forth, though his power was probably greater in the north. As guardian, Comyn was active in government business at Edinburgh (principally), Roxburgh, Haddington, Stirling, Perth, and Berwick between 1287 and 1291. In 1289 the guardians sent him, together with Robert (V) Brus (died 1295) and the bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, to negotiate with the English king's representative concerning the return of the Maid of Norway to Scotland, and Comyn was among the prelates and barons who confirmed the resulting treaty of Birgham in July 1290. By then John Comyn, as one of four surviving guardians, had become head of a Comyn 'party', following the death of his great-uncle and fellow guardian, Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan, in 1289. He was responsible, in 1290, for informing Edward I about the arrival of the Maid of Norway in Orkney, and in the same year was paid $100 out of $200, of the king's gift. 
After the Maid's death in Orkney (October 1290), Comyn himself became one of thirteen 'competitors' for the Scottish throne, though his brother-in-law, John de Balliol, and Robert (V) Brus were the two strongest candidates ['see also 'Competitors for the throne of Scotland]. Comyn claimed descent from Donald III (died 1099?), whose granddaughter Hextilda (married to the Richard Comyn who died in 1178) was the mother of John's great-grandfather. Comyn's claim significantly stated that he would not prejudice the claims of Balliol, his brother-in-law. He had already shown strong support for Balliol, and the list of Balliol's forty auditors was dominated by Comyn family and supporters. Indeed, in 1290-91 the 'appeal of the seven earls' accused John Comyn, with Bishop William Fraser of St Andrews (died 1297), of trying to make Balliol king by a 'coup'. Comyn's claim, soon withdrawn and dismissed in the final judgment (17 November 1292), was, no doubt, intended to safeguard a possible future bid after Balliol became king in 1292. The failure of the Balliol line could have given Comyn's descendants through Eleanor de Balliol a double claim. 
Under Balliol's kingship, John Comyn naturally figured prominently in Scottish politics and when, by 1295, King John's leadership had proved ineffective, John Comyn was one of the council of twelve elected to take government out of John's hands. In 1295 he was sent to France to negotiate a treaty which was ratified in 1296, and after John renounced Edward I's overlordship in the latter year, Comyn was regarded as the English king's enemy and his Northumberland lands were confiscated. After the Scottish defeat at Dunbar, Comyn made submission at Montrose in July 1296 and was sent into exile with his family to the English king's manor of Geddington, where he was allowed to hunt fox, hare, and wild cat in the royal forest. Following the outbreak of revolt in Scotland under William Wallace, Comyn was sent by Edward I in 1297 to bring order to Scotland. He was commanded to assist Brian Fitzalan in the custody of the kingdom, and especially to defend the castle at Roxburgh; and he was also instructed to quell the rising in Moray, but appears soon to have joined the Scots, because late in 1297 his Tynedale lands were to be taken again into the king's hands. It is probable that Comyn contributed cavalry to the Scottish army at Falkirk in 1298, as Fordun reports that 'the Comyns' envied Wallace and deserted the Scottish army at the battle. But that it was John's son, John Comyn the younger (d. 1306), who was chosen guardian with Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick, the future king, in 1298, suggests that John Comyn the elder was either too ill or unfit for office, or possibly discredited. He died, 'c'.1302, at his castle of Lochindorb and was succeeded by his son, John, who married Joan de Valence, cousin of the English king.

Comyn, Sir John, lord of Badenoch (d. 1306), magnate, was the son and heir of John Comyn, known as the Competitor (d. c.1302), and his wife, Eleanor (Marjory in Scottish sources), sister of John de Balliol, later king of Scots. He married Joan de Valence, daughter of William de Valence, earl of Pembroke (d. 1296), a cousin of Edward I, and had three children -- John (died 1314), Elizabeth (married Richard Talbot), and Joan (married David, earl of Atholl). He was known as 'the younger' or 'the son' until he inherited his father's extensive estates -- the last reference to him as 'the son' appears to have been in 1301. He was made a knight by King John (de Balliol) probably soon after 1292. 
John Comyn had received the gift of the important manors of Walwick, Thornton, and Henshaw in Tynedale by 'c'.1295 but on his father's death he inherited wide-ranging and vast estates in the Scottish highlands (Badenoch and Lochaber), in Roxburghshire (Bedrule and Scraesburgh), in Dumfriesshire (Dalswinton), in Perthshire (Findogask and Ochtertyre), in the Clyde valley (Machan), in Dunbartonshire (Lenzie and Kirkintilloch), and in Atholl. Lands in England included important estates in Tynedale (Tarset and Thornton) and Lincolnshire (Ulseby). The castles of Lochindorb, Ruthven, Inverlochy, and Blair Atholl made a formidable defence to his power in northern Scotland, while the castle of Dalswinton, and probable castle sites at Machan and Kirkintilloch, added weight to his influence further south. Apart from this substantial landed base, John Comyn inherited powerful family support and a long tradition of involvement at the centre of Scottish politics. His family links -- John Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1308), who dominated north-east Scotland, was his cousin, King John was his uncle, and William, earl of Pembroke, was his brother-in-law -- had a significant influence on his key role at the forefront of Scottish political affairs from 1296 to 1306. 
As a relative of John de Balliol, and one of the leading supporters of his kingship, John Comyn the younger took a prominent role when open rebellion broke out in Scotland against English overlordship in 1296. On 26 March, with seven Scottish earls, he crossed the Solway from Annandale (which had been given to him by King John), burning villages to the suburbs of Carlisle itself before trying unsuccessfully to take the city by storm. He was also present when Hexham Priory was burnt two weeks later, before retreating northwards on news of Edward I's imminent arrival, and he helped to capture Dunbar Castle on 22 April. However, this castle was forced to surrender to Edward I on the 28th, John Comyn having been handed over as a hostage to the English king on the previous day. His wife, Joan, was already in England, having been given letters of safe conduct to go to London as soon as her husband came out in open rebellion. In September 1296 she was given lands worth 200 marks in Tynedale for her support. Along with other Scottish nobles taken into captivity at Dunbar, John Comyn was taken to England where he became a prisoner at the Tower of London. In 1297 he promised to go with the king overseas, and to serve him well and faithfully against the king of France, but by 1298 he was back in Scotland. 
The years 1296 to 1298 had been significant for the Badenoch branch of the family. Not only did they have their valuable Northumberland lands confiscated, but the Comyn leadership of the Scottish political community, little challenged since the mid-thirteenth century, no longer went unquestioned after the enforced absence of the chief members of the family from 1296 to 1298. James Stewart (died 1309), Bishop Robert Wishart (died 1316), and William Wallace (died 1305) came to the fore in these years, and Wallace became sole guardian early in 1298. By then John Comyn was once more in opposition to Edward I, as is indicated by the English king's peremptory command on 26 March of that year to Comyn's wife, Joan, to come to London with her children without delay. After the defeat of an English army at Stirling Bridge by William Wallace and Andrew Murray (died 1297) on 11 September 1297, Edward I had taken the Scottish threat more seriously. He set up headquarters at York in the summer of 1298, and on 22 July defeated the Scots at the battle of Falkirk. John Comyn probably contributed cavalry to the Scottish forces, led by Wallace. According to the fourteenth-century Scottish historian John Fordun, Wallace's defeat was caused by the flight of the cavalry, and he blamed the Comyns for this. However, it is more probable that panic rather than cowardice was the cause of defeat, and it seems unlikely that the Comyns were blamed at the time. Following his defeat, Wallace resigned as guardian, and between July and December 1298 John Comyn the younger and Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick, the future king, were elected joint guardians of Scotland. It is possible that there had been tension between the Comyns and Wallace, who had risen to prominence in their absence. And there was certainly tension between John Comyn and Robert Bruce, probably resulting from the Bruce claim to the Scottish crown, and the strong Comyn championing of Balliol's kingship, during the Great Cause. 
These resentments came into the open at a council held at Peebles on 19 August 1299, when an argument over claims to William Wallace's lands led to a brawl between Comyn and Bruce supporters, in the course of which 'John Comyn leaped at the earl of Carrick and seized him by the throat' (Barrow, 107). The bishop of St Andrews, William Lamberton (died 1328), was elected as guardian alongside Comyn and Bruce to help preserve unity in government, but this unity lasted only until May 1300, when Bruce was forced from office. At a parliament held in Rutherglen on 10 May, Comyn argued with Lamberton, saying that he would no longer serve with him. Another reorganization of the guardianship led to the preservation of unity with Comyn and Lamberton remaining in office, but being joined by Sir Ingram de Umfraville, an ally of the Comyns and Balliol's kinsman. This alliance appears to have dissolved between December 1300 and May 1301, with John Soulis (died 'c'.1310) appearing as sole guardian at that time. It seems, from official record sources, that Comyn resigned for a short time, although, according to John Fordun, John Comyn remained in office continuously from 1298 to 1304, with John Soulis being associated with the guardianship by John de Balliol's express wish in 1301 and 1302. John Comyn was sole guardian in the autumn of 1302, however, when Soulis went with an embassy to France. Early in 1303 Comyn's leadership of the Scottish political community was again apparent, since on 24 February he was 'leader and captain' of the Scottish army which defeated an English force at Roslin. After this victory the Scots, led by Comyn, described by the chronicler Bower as chief guardian of Scotland, and Simon Fraser (died 1305), harassed the English king's officers as well as the English king's supporters in southern Scotland. They were still active in the autumn of 1303 when they raised Lennox, causing Margaret, countess of Lennox, to ask Edward I's help against John Comyn. Edward's retaliation had already started in the summer of 1303. He marched north to assert English authority, and in October 1303 stayed for a while at Lochindorb, a castle at the heart of John Comyn's northern power base. 
A combination of the peace made between France, hitherto Scotland's ally, and England on 20 May 1303, and the realization that the Scots could not muster an army big enough to match the English in pitched battle, led to all the leading Scottish magnates, except William Wallace, Simon Fraser, and John Soulis, submitting to Edward I on 9 February 1304. John Comyn, no doubt in his capacity as sole guardian, negotiated conditions for surrender on behalf of the community of Scotland. Negotiations had begun between the earl of Ulster, the royal commander in the west of Scotland, and Comyn on 6 February. Comyn refused to surrender unconditionally. He demanded firstly an amnesty and restoration of estates for those who had fought against Edward, and secondly that the Scottish people should be 'protected in all their laws, customs and liberties in every particular as they existed in the time of King Alexander III' (Barrow, 130). There was no disinheritance, but not all of Comyn's demands were met -- the good old days of Alexander III could not be restored, and varying degrees of exile were imposed on the leading men. Robert Wishart, bishop of Glasgow, for instance, was initially required to leave Scotland for two to three years; in addition, John Comyn, Alexander Lindsay, David Graham, and Simon Fraser were ordered to capture William Wallace and hand him over to Edward. Edward I took over the government of Scotland, appointing his nephew, John of Brittany (died 1334), as lieutenant of Scotland. John Comyn was one of a council of twenty-two Scots (including Robert Bruce) appointed to advise the new lieutenant. 
The savage execution of William Wallace on 23 August 1305 may have raised the level of indignation in Scotland at English overlordship. This forms the background to the infamous murder of John Comyn by Robert Bruce in the Greyfriars Church at Dumfries on 10 February 1306 and Robert Bruce's inauguration as king of Scots six weeks later. According to tradition, first recounted by Scottish chroniclers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Bruce and Comyn, rivals and the two most powerful nobles in Scotland, made an agreement that Bruce should take the Scottish crown and Comyn should take Bruce's lands in return. Comyn, however, betrayed Bruce and told Edward I of Bruce's plans. After being confronted with his treachery in the church at Dumfries, Comyn quarrelled with Bruce and was murdered along with his uncle, Robert. 
More contemporary, though still biased, English accounts give a different angle to the murder, and the narrative of Walter of Guisborough deserves some precedence. According to Guisborough, Bruce feared that Comyn would hinder him in his attempt to gain the Scottish crown, and sent two of his brothers, Thomas and Nigel, from his own castle at Lochmaben to Comyn's castle at Dalswinton, 10 miles away, asking Comyn to meet him at the Greyfriars Church, Dumfries, to discuss 'certain business'. It seemed that Bruce wanted to put a plan to Comyn, no doubt involving the revival of Scottish kingship with Bruce on the throne. After initially friendly words, Bruce turned on Comyn and accused him of treacherously reporting to Edward I that he, Bruce, was plotting against him. It seems probable that their bitter antagonisms of the past were instantly revived and that in a heated argument mutual charges of treachery were made. Bruce struck Comyn with a dagger and his men attacked him with swords. Mortally wounded, Comyn was left for dead. Comyn's uncle, Robert, was killed by Christopher Seton (died 1306) as he tried to defend his nephew. 
According to tradition in both Scotland and England, John Comyn was killed in two stages, with Bruce's men returning to the church to finish off the deed. According to Bower, Bruce returned to Lochmaben Castle and reported to his kinsmen James Lindsay and Roger Kirkpatrick 'I think I have killed John the Red Comyn' (Bower, 6.311). Bruce's men returned to the church to make sure that the deed was done, with Roger Kirkpatrick, according to a wholly fabulous tale, exclaiming 'I mak siccar'. 
What is clear is that Comyn's rivalry with Bruce must have been intense since 1286. The Comyns had suppressed Bruce rebellions in 1286 and 1287, and were strong supporters both of John de Balliol's candidature for the Scottish crown in the Great Cause, 1291-2, and of Balliol's kingship after 1292. John Comyn represented a long tradition of Comyn leadership of the Scottish political community during most of the thirteenth century. He was a major obstacle to Robert Bruce's ambitions, especially as he could make a double claim to the Scottish crown himself, as heir to John de Balliol as well as in his own right. Contemporary English sources like Guisborough emphasize John Comyn's refusal to support Robert Bruce's treachery by overturning the lawful sovereign, Balliol. 
The importance of John Comyn's murder was soon recognized in both Scotland and England. Edward I's initial response was phlegmatic, but by 5 April he had appointed Aymer de Valence (died 1324), Comyn's brother-in-law, as his special lieutenant in Scotland with wide-ranging and drastic powers against Bruce and the alliance between the English and the remaining members of the Comyn family continued until the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In Scotland, Bruce was forced to follow up the murder by destroying the Comyn power base in the north before being fully assured of his kingship. A civil war thus accompanied the Anglo-Scottish war. In 1306 Edward I ordered Joan de Valence to send her son, John, John Comyn's son and heir, to England where he was to be in the care of Sir John Weston, master and guardian of the royal children. His father's vast landholding was divided up among Bruce's supporters. This John Comyn lost his life, and any hope of retrieving the vast Scottish inheritance of the Comyns of Badenoch, at the battle of Bannockburn, when he fought on the side of Edward II.

Comyn, John, seventh earl of Buchan (c.1250-1308), magnate, was the son of Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1289), and Elizabeth, third daughter of Roger de Quincy, earl of Winchester (died 1264). He probably succeeded to the title in 1289, aged about forty. Earl John's territorial interests are reflected by his service as sheriff of Banffshire in 1289 and of Wigtownshire in 1290. He played a prominent role during the interregnum, holding a number of royal castles before they were handed over to King Edward and the Competitors in 1291 and petitioning King Edward in 1292 not to renege on the promises made at Birgham. At some point thereafter, Earl John resigned all or part of his lands in Galloway to his cousin, John, king of Scots, in return for lands in north-east Scotland. 
As relations between England and Scotland deteriorated, Buchan played a major role in the patriotic government, leading the Scottish force which raided south of the border in the spring of 1296. King Edward duly confiscated his manor of Whitwick in Leicester. After the collapse of Scottish resistance at the battle of Dunbar, Earl John was present at King John's enforced abdication in July 1296, himself submitting at the same time. Although initially required to live in England south of the Trent, he was sent back to north-east Scotland in June 1297 in order to halt the activities of Andrew Murray (died 1297), with the help of the bishop of Aberdeen and Gartnait, son of the earl of Mar. They made only a pretence of action, and Buchan soon came out actively on the patriotic side, perhaps taking part, albeit ineffectively, in the battle of Falkirk in 1298. 
Having taken his place once more at the heart of Scottish government, Earl John attended a meeting at Peebles in August 1299, where disagreement broke out between members of the pro-Comyn and pro-Bruce factions, prompting John Comyn the younger (d. 1306) to seize the earl of Carrick, and Buchan himself to attack William Lamberton, bishop of St Andrews. The Scots settled their differences, however, when news came that Buchan's younger brother, Sir Alexander Comyn, was ravaging the north of the country with Lachlan Mac Ruairidh, a freebooting north-western magnate. 
In February 1300 Earl John, as justiciar of Scotland, heard cases pertaining to his office in Aberdeen, despite the fact that his brother, Sir Alexander, later claimed that he had also held the area, but for King Edward. A few months later Buchan had gone south, missing a parliament held at Rutherglen in May 1300 because he was 'away in Galloway to treat with the Gallovidians', many of whom tended to side with the English even against their overlord, King John, who was also lord of Galloway. The parliament was postponed until 17 December so that Earl John could attend (Sayles, 245-50). Later that same year, he led a Scottish force which was compelled to flee from the English army at the River Cree. In 1301, however, Buchan and Sir John Soulis, stationed at Loudoun in Ayrshire, were more successful in preventing King Edward's force, at Glasgow, from joining up with his son's army in west Ayrshire. 
At some point thereafter, Buchan went to France; when he returned in 1304 he submitted to Edward, along with most of the rest of the Scottish magnates. Under the statesmanlike settlement of Scotland in 1305, Earl John was appointed to serve on the council of the new lieutenant of Scotland, John of Brittany. However, this settlement was disrupted in 1306 by Robert Bruce's rebellion. The murder of John Comyn the younger forced Buchan into the English camp against King Robert. In late 1307 Robert went up to the north-east with the express intention of destroying Comyn power in the area, and Buchan's forces were routed at Inverurie in 1308. The king then ravaged the area in the so-called 'herschip' of Buchan. Although the earl was afterwards appointed Edward II's joint warden of the western marches (Annandale, Carrick, and Galloway), his days of active service in Scotland were over and he died in England between 11 August and 31 December 1308. 
Although he was rarely successful in military activities, which perhaps explains why he was never a guardian, Buchan had administrative abilities which served the patriotic government well. But his marriage to Isabel Macduff ['see 'Buchan, Isabel (b. c.1270, d. after 1313)], daughter of Colban, earl of Fife, produced no children and ended unhappily when she deserted him in 1306 in order to place the crown on King Robert's head, as was her family's right. Isabel, captured in the Bruce camp after the battle of Methven, was then imprisoned by King Edward in a cage in Berwick Castle. She was released in 1313 into the custody of Henry de Beaumont, who had married Buchan's niece and coheir, Alicia. Alicia was the daughter of Sir Alexander Comyn; though her husband called himself earl of Buchan, there is no evidence that he ever gained entry to the Buchan lands in Scotland, which eventually became a Stewart earldom.

Comyn, Sir Robert Buckley (1792-1853), judge, was born at the vicarage, White Hart Lane, Tottenham, Middlesex, on 26 June 1792, the third son of Thomas Comyn (1746/7-1798), vicar of Tottenham and chaplain of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, and his wife, Harriet Charlotte 'nee' Stables. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London (1807-9), and became a commoner of St John's College, Oxford, in 1809, matriculating on 12 April. That year he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, where his paternal grandfather, Stephen Comyn, had qualified as a barrister. He graduated BA in 1813 (MA 1815, DCL June 1842) and was called to the bar on 24 November 1814. In 1817 he published 'A Treatise on Usury', which Holdsworth has described as 'a good clear summary of the law' with 'useful discussions and explanations' on the statutes of usury (Holdsworth, 'Eng. law', 13.494). 
In January 1825 Comyn was appointed a puisne judge of the supreme court of Madras and was knighted on 9 February. In December 1835 he was promoted chief justice of Madras. A leader in local literary circles, from 1835 until 1842 he was the president of the Madras Literary Society. He was also a subscribing member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He published 'A Treatise on the Law of Landlord and Tenant' (1830) and 'History of the Western Empire from... Charlemagne to... Charles V' (2 vols., 1837). The fruit of his leisure hours at Madras, the history is extensively footnoted and contains over fifty genealogical tables, suggesting that Comyn had taken a copious library to India. It is a lively and engaging narrative, and Comyn appears to have hoped that it would be received as a precursor to William Robertson's well-known 'History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V' (1769). It appeared in an English edition in 1841, whereupon its author was commended in the 'Monthly Review' for his 'industry, enlargement of views, correct and very often vivid colouring, -- condensation, grasp, and a statesmanlike eloquence' ('Monthly Review', 566). In spite of the reviewer's earnest exhortations, however, Comyn published no more historical works. 
In 1842 Comyn returned to Britain. He was made a bencher at the Middle Temple in 1843 (he had been admitted there in January 1819), and in autumn 1848 he acted as a reader at the inn. He died at his house, 9 New Street, Spring Gardens, London, on 23 May 1853, and was the last person to be buried in the vaults of the Temple Church, London. He does not appear to have married.

Comyn, Walter, earl of Menteith (d. 1258), magnate, was the second known son by his first marriage of William Comyn who, in right of his second wife, Marjory, became earl of Buchan 'c'.1212 and who died in 1233. Walter had three brothers -- Richard, the eldest (died 1244x9), David (married Isabel de Valognes, lady of East Kilbride), and William, a clerk -- and one sister, Jean (married William of Ross, second earl of Ross ['see under 'Ross family (per. c.1215-c.1415)]). By his father's second marriage, Walter had three half-brothers -- Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1289), who married Elizabeth de Quincy, William, and Fergus -- and three half-sisters -- Idonea (married Gilbert de la Hay), Agnes (married Philip Meldrum), and Elizabeth (married William, earl of Mar). Walter Comyn became earl of Menteith on his marriage to Isabella, daughter and heir of Maurice, earl of Menteith, between 30 June 1233 and 9 January 1234. The support of such a large family network was to be a key factor in Earl Walter's political influence between 1235 and 1258. 
Walter Comyn's first appearance on record was as witness to two royal charters (between 1211 and 1214) of William the Lion ('r'. 1165-1214) to Arbroath Abbey. It is a testimony to the political influence of his father, who was justiciar of Scotia 'c'.1205- 'c'.1233 and sheriff of Forfar 'c'.1195- 'c'.1212, that Walter Comyn appeared regularly at the royal court in the later years of William the Lion and throughout the reign of Alexander II ('r'. 1214-49). By 1221 Comyn not only attended Alexander II on his marriage at York to Joan, sister of King Henry III, but was also one of twelve Scottish noblemen who swore on the Scottish king's behalf to observe the terms of the marriage settlement agreed with the king of England. From 1220 to 1229 Walter Comyn appeared with increasing regularity and prominence in the witness lists of Alexander II's charters. His elder brother Richard, who was still alive in 1244, had received the family estates in north and east Scotland, and devoted himself to these. But between 1229 and 1234 Walter came into possession of the lordship of Badenoch (the highland region based upon Strath Spey), given to him by Alexander II, perhaps as a reward for his father William Comyn's success in quelling the rebellion of Gillescop MacWilliam in Moray in 1229-30. It is clear that Alexander saw the Comyns, in the persons of William and Walter, as playing a key role in reinforcing royal authority in the north, through their possession of Badenoch; the lordship included Lochaber, and occupied a strategic position dominating the principal passes from the north and west highlands into the Tay basin. Following the death of William Comyn in 1233, his son Walter assumed the leadership of the Badenoch (now the senior) branch of the family. His status received an additional boost by January 1234 when he became earl of Menteith on his marriage to Isabella of Menteith. In 1235 Earl Walter's trusted role as crown agent in the north was extended to the south-west, when he was given responsibility for bringing Galloway to order after Alexander II had defeated rebels there. Comyn's role as premier magnate in Scotland was shown at York in 1237 when he alone took a formal oath on the king of Scotland's soul to observe the treaty (the treaty of York) which Alexander II had entered into with Henry III. 
Earl Walter was the dominant force in Scottish politics from 1237 to his death in 1258. In 1242 he and his family took action against members of the Bisset family, accused of murdering Patrick, earl of Atholl, an ally of the Comyns. His dominance was seen to be a threat by both Alexander II and Henry III in 1244, when Henry marched north with an army, forced a treaty of friendship from the Scottish king, and received a bond of good behaviour from Earl Walter as one of the leaders of two well-defined groups of Scottish magnates which had emerged by that time. Earl Walter and other Scottish nobles were accused of fortifying castles on the borders. Comyn himself strengthened the castle at Tarset in Northumberland, while Nicholas de Soulis and either Aymer or John Maxwell built castles at Hermitage (Liddesdale) and Caerlaverock (Nithsdale). Earl Walter was also suspected of harbouring the exiled Geoffrey de Marisco, whose son William had plotted to murder Henry III in 1238. Thus in 1244 Earl Walter and his following (forty-one names in all) had to swear that they were neither linked with attacks on the English king's lands in Ireland, nor had given shelter to the English king's enemies. The promotion of Alan Durward (died 1275) as justiciar of Scotia in 1244, and therefore as head of government, was aimed at curtailing Earl Walter's political power. The nature of the earl's following, however -- a tightly knit family group, strong in numbers and influence, based on the three main branches of the Comyn family (the Badenoch, Buchan, and Kilbride lines) and their connections -- ensured that Earl Walter was not eclipsed after 1244. 
This became apparent in the minority crisis following Alexander II's death in 1249. Earl Walter successfully thwarted Alan Durward's attempt to formalize his position as head of government during the minority. He emerged once again as the dominant Scottish magnate and it was through a joint Comyn and clergy invitation that Henry III intervened in Scottish political affairs in 1251 -- an intervention sealed by the marriage of Henry III's daughter, Margaret, to the young Alexander III ('r'. 1249-86) at York -- replacing the Durward-led government by a Comyn-dominated one. Earl Walter, perhaps surprisingly, did not become the justiciar of Scotia, the most important government office, but he ensured that his leading supporters were in all the key positions; Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan, became the justiciar. The years 1251 to 1255 saw Walter Comyn's government successfully deny Henry III's attempts to influence affairs in Scotland through his two appointed guardians to the young Scottish king and queen, Robert de Ros (died 'c'.1270) and John de Balliol. Henry III intervened again in 1255, supporting Alan Durward's counter-coup, and replacing Comyn leadership with a council of fifteen which would serve for seven years. Alan Durward, who became justiciar of Scotia, was prominent in the new government. His fear of Earl Walter's continuing power in 1255 was obvious in his attempts to discredit the Comyns and reduce their influence by renewing his claim to the earldom of Mar. Comyn and his party refused to put their names to the document setting up the 1255 council, and having failed to convince Henry III that he should intervene once more on their behalf, they kidnapped the young king at Kinross in 1257 and thus regained control of government. For once lacking general support within Scotland, Earl Walter tried to bolster his position by allying his supporters, largely restricted to the Comyn family itself, with Llywelyn of Wales and his supporters in 1258. The cautious terms of the treaty indicated Earl Walter's reluctance to act unconstitutionally and against the wishes of the Scottish king. But it was also significant that Henry III was no longer in a position to intervene, as he was beset at home by opposition from the baronial reform movement, and in fact ceased to control the English government after 12 June. Indeed, without external interference compromise was soon reached, when in September 1258 a new council of ten was agreed upon in Scotland. This included four Comyn supporters headed by Walter Comyn, and four Durward supporters. 
Walter Comyn was still the leading political figure in Scotland when he died in late October or early November 1258, apparently as a result of a fall from his horse. Messengers came to Henry III at St Albans on 22 November specially to report his death. Matthew Paris described him as 'the most powerful earl in Scotland' (Paris, 'Chron'., 5.724). In Scotland, even the largely anti-Comyn chronicler, John Fordun, described him as a 'man of foresight and shrewdness in council' ('Chronica gentis Scottorum', 2.289). To the Comyn party, fear of loss of power was reflected in Walter Comyn's nephew and heir, John Comyn, seizing (but holding for a short time only) the earldom of Menteith from Walter's widow and her new husband, Sir John Russell, an English knight, amid accusations that Walter Comyn had been poisoned. A visible witness to Earl Walter's importance was his foundation 'c'.1238 of the Augustinian priory of Inchmahome, set on the largest of three islands in the Lake of Menteith, close to a probable chief residence on the adjacent island of Inchtalla. Patronage was also given to Scone and Arbroath abbeys. 
Earl Walter's significance in a critical period of Scottish history prompted a number of extreme views about his role. To the influential but monarchocentric fourteenth- and fifteenth-century chroniclers John Fordun and Walter Bower, Walter Comyn was the unprincipled leader of an over-mighty faction, threatening the monarchy itself. Yet Comyn had been a key royal agent in the north (1229 onwards) and in the south west (1235). His leadership of the Scottish political community was, except in 1257-8, largely with the support of the Scottish nobility and church. Alternatively Walter Comyn has been portrayed as the leader of a 'native' party. Yet, though he restricted the influence of the guardians appointed by Henry III between 1251 and 1255, he did not pursue nationalistic policies. He recognized, like his opponents in Scotland, the political necessity of Henry III's support during the minority crisis of Alexander III.

Comyns, Sir John (c.1667-1740), judge and legal writer, was the eldest surviving son of William Comyns of Lincoln's Inn, barrister, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Matthew Rudd, of Little Baddow, Essex. The Comyns or Cummins were a well established Essex family. He was admitted a student at Lincoln's Inn in May 1683, probably commencing his law studies in 1684, since he also matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1683. He was called to the bar in 1690, and practised in king's bench until 1705, when he took the degree of serjeant-at-law (8 June) and moved to common pleas practice. He was junior MP for Maldon in the tory interest from 1701 to 1708, and from 1710 to 1715, when he was unseated on petition. In 1711-12 he acted as temporary chairman of the elections committee. 
After 1715 Comyns was by his own account 'discarded by all but the Tories' (HoP, 'Commons', 569); in 1719 he acted for high-church defendants accused of riot and vagrancy for making a charity collection without a begging licence ('Trial of the Rev. Wm Hendley and others', 'State trials', 15.1407). In 1722 Comyns was again returned to parliament for Maldon, standing at the solicitation of Sir Robert Raymond, who had crossed to the government in 1717 and risen with Sir Robert Walpole. Raymond was also responsible for Comyns's appointment (on 7 September 1726) as a baron of the exchequer, when he was also knighted. In January 1736 he was transferred to the common pleas, and two years later (in July 1738) was appointed lord chief baron of the exchequer by Lord Hardwicke. Comyns was married three times, on 21 April 1693 to Anne Gurdon (died 1705), on 20 October 1708 to Elizabeth Courthope, and in 1726 to Anne Wilbraham; a son from his first marriage predeceased him and he left no children. He died on 13 November 1740, and was buried in the parish church of Writtle, near Chelmsford. His estate of Highlands, Widford, near Chelmsford, passed to his nephew, John Comyns. Comyns's tory background is visible to only a limited extent in his judicial work: he was less inclined to favour the tithe-payer over the tithe-owner than Sir Geoffrey Gilbert and Sir Thomas Pengelly, and more willing than some contemporary judges to use patriarchalist arguments in gender-related litigation. On the other hand, like other, mostly whig, contemporary judges, he made considerable and quite sophisticated use of civil and canon law sources, and displayed explicit commitment both to freedom of contract and of disposition of property, and to strict construction against the crown of criminal law and procedure. 
Two legal works were published after Comyns's death. His 'Reports of Cases Adjudged in the Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer' was translated from the original law French by his nephew and heir, John, and published in one volume in 1744. A second edition by Samuel Rose appeared in 1792. The 'Reports' tracks Comyns's career, covering mainly king's bench cases to 1705, mainly common pleas cases to 1726, exchequer cases to 1736, common pleas to 1738, and exchequer again to 1739. Those from his judicial work in the exchequer are much fuller and more valuable than the earlier reports. A translation of Comyns's 'Digest of the Laws of England' was published in five instalments between 1762 and 1767, and a supplement in one volume was added by 'a gentleman of the Inner Temple' in 1776. Subsequent editions appeared in 1800 and 1822, and an American version in New York and Philadelphia in 1824-6. The 'Digest' clearly originated as a student abridgement or commonplace. Its quality is variable, with the section on pleading exceptionally well developed; its legal thought is generally conservative. These features led to the work's acquiring high authority in the period of tory ascendancy on the bench in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century; thus, for example, Lord Ellenborough described the 'Digest' as a 'book of very excellent authority' ('Kingdon v. Nottle', 1813).

Conant, John (1608-1694), college head, was born on 18 October 1608 at Yettington, Bicton, in south-east Devon, the eldest son of Robert Conant and his wife, Elizabeth Morris; the family had lived for several generations in Devon. His uncle of the same name, rector of Limington in Somerset, recognized an aptitude for learning in the young Conant and placed him first in the free school at Ilchester, Somerset, and then under the instruction of the schoolmaster Thomas Branker. His uncle gave him additional instruction. In 1627 his uncle took him to Oxford, where he was enrolled on 18 February as a commoner of Exeter College, of which the elder John Conant had been a fellow between 1611 and 1620. At Exeter the younger Conant's tutor was Lawrence Bodley, nephew of the benefactor of the Bodleian Library. Conant quickly gained a mastery of Greek, disputing publicly in that language, and also excelled in Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic. His precocity was recognized by John Prideaux, the anti-Arminian rector of Exeter, who commented that he found nothing difficult. John Conant graduated BA on 26 May 1631, and proceeded MA on 12 January 1634; on 30 June 1632 he was chosen a probationer of Exeter College, and on 3 July 1633 made a fellow. He was ordained deacon and tutored pupils until 1642, when the disruption of Oxford by civil war caused him to depart, leaving behind valuable books which he never regained. 
Conant planned to join his uncle at Limington, but by the time he arrived his uncle, a supporter of the parliamentary cause, had gone to London. There his uncle preached to the House of Commons on 26 July 1643, calling on it to reform the church, and was a member of the Westminster assembly (not the nephew, as some sources assert). Conant remained for a while at Limington, preaching and carrying out parish duties, until so menaced by royalist troops that he joined his uncle in London and began to assist him in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate, but he soon took up residence at Harefield, Middlesex, in the family of Lord and Lady Chandos, whom he served as chaplain. Lady Chandos, the daughter of Henry Montagu, earl of Manchester, was in particular his patron, awarding him an annual stipend of $80, much of which he used to relieve the needy of the parish, and provide them with bibles and schooling. Meanwhile, for several years he gave a weekday lecture at nearby Uxbridge. On 20 December 1645 he was offered the rectory of Whimple, Devon, by the committee for plundered ministers, but refused it. When in 1647 subscription to the solemn league and covenant was required of college fellows, Conant refused to take it, resigning his fellowship at Exeter by a letter from Harefield dated 27 September 1647. 
When the rector of Exeter died in 1649 a majority of the fellows wanted Conant's uncle for the position, but the elder Conant wished to remain at the parish of St Thomas, Salisbury, and urged his nephew for the post; the nephew was duly elected on 7 June 1649, and admitted to the office on 29 June 1649. Conant was soon confronted with the question of affirming his loyalty to the parliamentary government by taking the engagement, which was made mandatory for members of colleges in October 1649. Conant took it, but declared to the commissioners that in doing so he did not necessarily approve of all that the government had done, and that he was not abridging his liberty to declare allegiance to any other future power that God might put over him. 
Conant was an ideal choice for rector, and took up his duties with alacrity. He found the college deeply in debt and deficient in discipline, and remedied both, enforcing strict observance of the college statutes. He also catechized the college servants and attended the academic exercises and daily prayers of the college. In weekly instruction to the undergraduates he refuted Socinianism and Roman Catholicism and drew on such standard works of reformed scholasticism as Johannes Wollebius's 'Compendium theologiae Christianae' and Johannes Piscator's 'Aphorismi doctrinae Christianae'. He led a study of biblical prophecy for more advanced students, using Thomas Parker's 'The Visions and Prophecies of Daniel Expounded' (1646), a book by a New England minister which asserted that the pope was the antichrist. Conant's leadership at Exeter attracted large numbers of students, including some from abroad. He was awarded the DD on 31 May 1654. 
While rector of Exeter, John Conant preached regularly at three nearby parishes: at All Saints' he preached every Friday morning at seven o'clock for more than ten years, developing a complete body of divinity for his auditors; at St Michael's he preached almost every Sunday for several years; and at St Mary Magdalen's he preached every other Sunday for half of each year. He also preached frequently as vicar of Kidlington, near Oxford, which was annexed to the rectory of Exeter. Conant declined the rectory of Ewelme in Oxfordshire, which was also attached to the college. In August 1651 he married Elizabeth Reynolds (died 1707), youngest daughter of Edward Reynolds (1599-1676), then rector of Braunston, Northamptonshire, and a leader of those more moderate puritans usually designated presbyterians; the couple had six sons and six daughters. In October 1652 Conant was presbyterially ordained to the ministry at Salisbury, where his uncle, who may have participated in the ceremony, was then living. 
In September 1654 Conant was appointed regius professor of divinity at Oxford. To fulfil the duties of that office he lectured twice a week, basing his lectures on the biblical annotations of Hugo Grotius, whose philological scholarship was much admired even by those who rejected his Arminianism. As compensation for the sequestered income of his divinity chair, in 1657 Conant was awarded by Oliver Cromwell the income from the rectory of Abergele, Denbighshire, much of which, however, he returned to its resident vicar and to the poor of the parish. Conant never published any of his theological lectures, and later destroyed his notes for them. But there are indications of his theological position: for example, a letter from John Warner, a critic of Baxter's 'Aphorisms of Justification', claimed that Conant praised certain theological distinctions Warner had used in refuting Baxter. Orthodox Calvinists had been disturbed by Baxter's book. 
On 9 October 1657, shortly after Richard Cromwell succeeded his father as chancellor of Oxford University, he named John Conant as vice-chancellor. Before then Jesus College bursars' accounts show him handling payments to the university by 1654. As vice-chancellor Conant restored many traditional usages, such as the wearing of caps and hoods, which had been considered popish by his predecessor John Owen. He also opposed the grant of a university charter to Durham College, going to London in 1659 with Seth Ward and John Wilkins to help thwart it. And just as he had enforced discipline in Exeter College, he now sought to do so in the whole university. He was also instrumental in procuring in 1659 the enormous library of John Selden for the Bodleian. 
Conant welcomed the Restoration, silencing in January 1660 a Baptist preacher at Balliol who denounced the coming changes, and, with a deputation of university notables to the court, on 15 June 1660 presented the king with a book of congratulatory verses composed for the occasion by members of the university. He also made a speech in Latin before the king. But he lost his professorship, as the deprived Robert Sanderson was reinstated. In August 1660 he was removed from the vice-chancellorship. In the summer of 1662 the new vice-chancellor, the Laudian Richard Baylie, questioned him for preaching against Arminianism and for denying that original sin was taken away by baptism. His lecture at All Saints' was suppressed at about the same time. 
Conant was one of the twelve presbyterian leaders who sought compromise with the bishops at the Savoy conference in 1661, but he was dissatisfied with the results of the conference, and could not accept the 'Act of Uniformity', even though his father-in-law, who was then appointed Bishop of Norwich, did. Conant's son and biographer of the same name ['see below'] thought that his father would have been offered the bishopric of Exeter if he had conformed. On 2 September 1662 Conant was deprived of his last Oxford office, rector of Exeter, for not subscribing to the liturgy of the Church of England. One year later (30 September 1663) he was summoned along with others before the chancellor, the earl of Clarendon, and accused of holding an illegal conventicle in his house. Conant eventually removed to Northampton, where in 1666 he took the 'Oxford oath', rejecting armed opposition to the king and promising not to press for changes in church or civil government. There he apparently did not preach illegally, but attended the services of the established church. After reflecting on the issue of conformity, and comparing the 'Book of Common Prayer' with ancient liturgies, Conant conformed, and was ordained priest by his father-in-law on 20 September 1670. Conformists praised him for persuading others to conformity (both John Tillotson and George Bull spoke well of him), but he was still trusted by such moderate dissenters as Richard Baxter, who thought that Conant and other peaceable persons on both sides could have easily settled the matters separating the church and dissent. Conant was falsely rumoured to be the author of an eirenic tract, 'Persuasive to Peace and Unity' (1672). 
With conformity and reordination preferment was open to Conant, and he became the vicar of All Saints', Northampton, on 15 February 1671. He remained there, at an annual income of $100, even though other positions were offered him. Various persons, including the secretary of state, Joseph Williamson, and the mathematician John Wallis, both of whom had known him at Oxford, sought further preferment for him. Even when All Saints' Church, along with much of the town (but not Conant's residence), was destroyed by fire in September 1675, he refused to accept other positions, but remained at his post, preaching for a while at St Peter's, Northampton. A letter of Conant's describing the fire was included in his son's biography of him. In addition to his vicarage, on 8 June 1676 he was installed archdeacon of Norwich, appointed by his father-in-law. On 3 December 1681 he was made a prebend of Worcester Cathedral by the king at the urging of the earl of Radnor, a former pupil. But some royalists resented these favours shown to Conant and accused him of keeping a conventicle, preaching seditious sermons, and giving communion to his congregation while they were seated. 
At Northampton, Conant kept special days of humiliation and prayer, and appears to have been a model pastor, visiting the spiritually troubled, comforting the sick, preaching sermons on practical godliness, and dispensing charity out of his own resources. His charity also extended to New England and to French protestants. One volume of his sermons was published in 1693; it bore the title 'Sermons Preached on Several Occasions', and was reprinted in a second corrected edition in 1699. Other sermons were published under the same title as volumes two to six, in 1697, 1698, 1703, 1708, and 1722. John Williams, a native of Northamptonshire educated at Oxford while Conant was there, and a royal chaplain who became bishop of Chichester in 1696, was instrumental in bringing about the publication of the first five volumes, and Digby Coates, principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, of the sixth. In a preface to the first volume Conant told the parishioners of All Saints', whom he was too infirm to serve any longer, that he hoped the publication of 'plain and practical sermons', which he had formerly preached to them, would further their 'spiritual welfare'. 
Conant's general outlook is clear from his published sermons and from twenty-five volumes of sermons in manuscript (Bodleian Library). They exemplify the practical and compassionate divinity common to later seventeenth-century moderate Calvinists: repentance, conversion, holiness, and an earnest longing for 'experimental' knowledge of Christ are stressed, while predestination, justification by faith, and the reformed order of salvation are presupposed. Pastoral concerns are foremost, with warnings about hell as well as against melancholy and excessive scrupulosity. The devout are not to inquire into God's decrees, but to do their duty. Conant was also concerned about scoffers at religion and disturbed by misbelief: among the latter, Lutheran consubstantiation, Quaker pharisaism, Roman Catholic idolatry, and Pelagian (that is, Arminian) denial of free grace in justification are mentioned. His sermons also touch on social issues, asserting that the rich must take responsibility for the poor, and condemning the code of honour demanding revenge. He saw special providences in such events as the fire at Northampton. 
Contemporaries described Conant as thin and short in stature. In 1686 he became completely blind. He died on 12 March 1694 and was buried in the rebuilt church of All Saints', Northampton, where he was commemorated by a monument and Latin epitaph.

John Conant (1653/4-1723), biographer, was the eldest son of John Conant and Elizabeth Reynolds. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 8 February 1670, aged sixteen, and graduated BA in 1673. Elected a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1676, he was active in the business of his college and proceeded MA on 29 January 1678. He took the LLD on 22 June 1683, moved to London, and became a member of Gray's Inn. He became a successful advocate at Doctors' Commons. In 1693 he was considered for, but not elected, warden of Merton. He married Mary West, daughter of John West, and inherited his father-in-law's property at Hampton Poyle, Oxfordshire, in 1696, though engaged in lawsuits over the property with her brother John West the younger. When his health deteriorated he moved to Kidlington in Oxfordshire, where he died on 23 August 1723. He wrote a biography of his father that remained in manuscript until publication in 1823.

Concanen, Matthew (1701-1749), writer and lawyer, was born in Ireland. Nothing is known of his parentage, education, or early life beyond Shiels's statement that he 'was bred to the Law' (Cibber, 5.27). He showed early literary ambitions with a comedy, 'Wexford Wells', written in 1719, acted in November 1720 at the Smock Alley Theatre (perhaps by command of Charles O'Hara, Lord Tyrawley), and printed in Dublin in 1721. His 'Meliora's Tears for Thyrsis', a conventional pastoral on the death of Thomas, Baron Southwell, and 'A Match at Football', a mock-heroic poem in three cantos, dedicated to Richard Bettesworth, were both published in Dublin in 1720. These and a number of shorter poems appeared in Concanen's 'Poems on Several Occasions' (1722), dedicated to the duchess of Grafton, wife of the lord lieutenant. 
About this time Concanen and his friend James Sterling moved to London, intending to take up journalism. According to Shiels they decided by the toss of a halfpenny that Sterling should oppose and Concanen defend the whig government (Cibber, 5.27), but Concanen had already sought patronage from at least four prominent whigs in Ireland. 'Miscellaneous Poems' (1724), edited by Concanen, included work by Swift, Parnell, Sheridan, Delany, Brown, Ward, Concanen, and others, and was dedicated to the whig Viscount Gage. Other poems by Concanen appeared in Richard Savage's 'Miscellaneous Poems and Translations' (1726). 
Concanen had praised Pope and expressed some obligation to Swift in his earliest writings, but some of the essays which from 1725 he wrote in the 'London Journal' and the 'British Journal' (reprinted in his 'The Speculatist', 1730) attacked those two writers. His co-belligerents included his friend Lewis Theobald and the then obscure William Warburton, but, fortunately for Warburton's later cultivation of Pope, his remark, in an ingratiating letter to Concanen on 2 January 1727, that Pope borrowed 'for want of genius' (Nichols, 'Illustrations', 2.195) was never made public. Joseph Warton believed that Warburton secretly assisted Concanen in one of his anti-Pope publications, 'A Supplement to the Profound' (1728). Pope believed, probably correctly, that Concanen was the editor of 'A Complete Collection' (1728), a republication of satirical replies to the Pope-Swift 'Miscellanies', and duly crushed him in 'The Dunciad' (1728) and the apparatus of 'The Dunciad Variorum' (1729). Swift ridiculed him in 'On Poetry: a Rhapsody' (1733). 
There are songs by Concanen in the 'Musical Miscellany' (1729) and a few new poems by him in a miscellany, 'The Flower-Piece' (1731), which he edited. With his friend Edward Roome and the whig politician Sir William Yonge he revised Richard Brome's 'The Jovial Crew' as a comic opera; it opened at Drury Lane on 8 February 1731 and ran for sixteen performances with Concanen receiving the profits. He was now writing in the 'Daily Courant' and was a pensioner of Walpole, according to Bolingbroke, who was one of its main targets. Concanen's last publications were a quibbling attack on Pope in 'A Miscellany on Taste' (1732) and a pro-Walpole 'Review of the Excise Scheme' (1733). 
Concanen was a barrister. On 29 June 1732, through the interest of the duke of Newcastle, he was appointed attorney-general of Jamaica, upon which Warburton wrote him an obsequious congratulatory letter (BL, Egerton MS 1955, fol. 2). He arrived in Spanish Town on 1 March 1733 and lived there for ten years, performing his duties with credit. As a member of the island's council (the upper legislative house, consisting of twelve members) from April 1733 he resisted the arbitrary actions of successive governors. He was suspended from the council by governor Edward Trelawny in May 1740 but remained attorney-general, and, in September 1742, reluctantly under governor's orders, prosecuted Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle for alleged assault upon Trelawny. 
Concanen married in Jamaica; his wife was an opulent widow or planter's daughter, perhaps both (Warburton, 218; Cibber, 5.31). They had no children, but Concanen fathered three illegitimate sons with an unknown partner or partners. His successor as attorney-general was appointed on 24 December 1743, after which, at some unknown date, Concanen returned to London, became a member of Serjeants' Inn and, it seems, lived in affluent retirement from politics and literature until he died of consumption on 22 January 1749. At the end he was perhaps living in Crane Court, Fleet Street, because this is where papers of his were later found, including the letter containing Warburton's imprudent sneer at Pope. By the time this letter was published in 1766 Warburton had shamelessly redrawn the picture of his relationship with Concanen, whom he now painted as a sponger and scoundrel (Warburton, 218). Concanen was survived by his wife, who married the Hon. Mr Hamilton, and by his three natural sons.

Conde, Jean (1765-1794), printmaker, was the son of a stonemason in Paris, and his wife, Louise Crantin. His name first appears in the 'registre des eleves' of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris on 20 March 1781: 'Jean Conde, Peintre natif de Paris, age de 15 ans 1/2, protege par M. Pierre [the painter Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre], demeurans enclos de Ste Genevieve, chez son pere Tailleur de pierre au Batiment de Ste Genevieve' (Paris, Ecole des Beaux-Arts, MS 823, fol. 64). During September of that year it was noted that he was a pupil of the engraver Lempereur, and in March 1782 of Boizot. Further references are made in the same source up until 1786. In October 1785 he won the third medal in the painting category of the competition organized by the Academie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. That work is now preserved in the collection of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In a similar competition held during January 1787 Conde won the second medal, and at this time he became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David. 
In 1787 Conde travelled from Paris to London with the print publisher John Boydell. His plans to work in London are likely to have been encouraged after David had met Richard and Maria Cosway on their visit to Paris from August to October 1786. In autumn 1787 he enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy Schools in London; by the end of that year he had won a silver medal for a drawing after the life, and he won a similar medal in 1792. Early in 1788 he returned to Paris and showed off his prize to David, who wrote to Maria Cosway: 'Conde showed me the medal which England had awarded him; this decision gives me a fair idea of London's Academy. Here, a man such as Conde, coming from nowhere, would not even have been allowed to enter the competition' (Daniell, vi). Conde also brought back to David a present for his master of one of the engraved portraits after Richard Cosway of 'George, Prince of Wales' (almost certainly that engraved in stipple by L. Sailliar in 1787), a gift which David held in high esteem. 
In the eight years up until his premature death, Conde enjoyed a successful career as an engraver; there are forty-six portraits known to have been engraved by him. He enjoyed a particularly close business relationship with Cosway, who may have painted his portrait in miniature (now untraced). Conde reproduced seventeen of Cosway's elegant and refined compositions in stipple; they are engraved in pale delicate tints, using stipple, sanguine, or aquatint. He also enhanced the compositions by enclosing them in frame-like borders, called glomisages after the French engraver Jean-Baptiste Glomy, who had first designed them. Among the ten portraits by Cosway that Conde engraved were those of 'Mrs Fitzherbert' (1792), 'Madame Du Barry' (1794), 'George, Prince of Wales' (1795), and the diplomatist and wit 'Caleb Whitefoord' (1806), and the seven subject compositions by Cosway he reproduced include the pair of 'Andromache and Ascanius' and 'Polindo and Albarosa, docet amor' (all 1791), 'Minerva Directing the Arrows of Cupid', and 'Queen Margaret of Anjou and her Son' (1795). The account book belonging to Conde's brother Pierre ['see below'], covering the years 1795 to 1821, which is currently untraced, noted the sales to various London printsellers of his engraving after Cosway as well as after other artists. The volume also contained three pencil drawings by Jean, which were probably portraits. Pierre charged different prices for different types of impressions: for example, for Jean's engraving of 'Mrs Fitzherbert', the prices were 8's'. (ordinary), 12's'. (half-coloured), and 16's'. (coloured and proof). Jean engraved portraits of celebrities for 'The European' and other magazines and produced engravings after portraits of actors after De Wilde, or from the life, for 'The Thespian' magazine. Among the other artists whose work he engraved were Banks, Opie, Romney, Reynolds, Russell, and Stuart. In 1791 he engraved from his own drawing a portrait of 'Mademoiselle La Chevaliere d'Eon de Beaumont', a notorious transvestite then resident in London, as 'Minerva'. In the lettering for this print he styled himself as a French artist, who designed this print 'as a monument of English generosity and French gratitude'. Conde also made portrait drawings, a number of which he engraved. He died, possibly at Richmond, Surrey, in July 1794, leaving money in hand to the value of $52 10's'. The valuation of his household furniture, engraved plates, drawings, prints, and tools amounted to $162. He was owed about $80 on various accounts, principally from some of the leading London print publishers, such as Bovi, Colnaghi, Dickinson, Harding, Macklin, and Thompkins (among other publishers of his prints were Bell, Boydell, Fores, Lay, and Sewell), and his own debts amounted to $93, which included accounts for his lodgings at Richmond and bills due to Mr Layton, printer in colours. The final balance of the estate was $177 6's'. 7died As Jean neither married nor had children, this sum was divided up between his brother Pierre, who was administrator of his estate, another brother, Matthieu, his sister Louise, and their mother. 
Jean's brother 
Conde later worked as a portrait miniaturist, and he exhibited his work at the Royal Academy from 1806 to 1824. During this period and up until the end of his life he lived at six successive London addresses, four of which were in the West End and the last two in Camden Town. A rare extant example of his portrait miniatures is that of 'Dr Plender', signed and dated 1812 on recto and verso (Dumas Egerton Trust collection on loan to the Scot. NPG). Two oval portrait miniatures in pencil on paper are known: a portrait of the painter 'James Northcote', from which Conde's engraving was published in 1795, and a 'Self-Portrait', exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1811, are now untraced. 
The Conde account book included copies of letters by Pierre, mainly to clients, including Lady Athlone in 1804, Lady Holland in 1808, and Lady Petre in 1820. Pierre, who appears to have been somewhat touchy in character, evidently had great difficulty in extracting payment from some of his clients; in later life, unmarried and childless, he seems to have been poor. He expressed the wish that after his death Mr Knock of Jeffreys Street, Camden Town -- to whom, in September 1835, he had sold his gold watch for $7 -- should accept any special prints engraved by his late brother Jean and by himself, and that Mr Knock also choose prints out of his portfolio 'as a small testimony of my gratitude of his kindness and friendship to my father and brother and myself'. Pierre Conde died in Camden Town, London, in 1840.

Condell, Henry (bap. 1576?, d. 1627), actor and editor of Shakespeare's first folio, was probably born in East Anglia. The only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, 'nee' Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at St Peter on 5 September 1576: the theatrical Condell mentions in his will a deceased 'Cosen Gilder of New Buckenham'. 
At some point Condell must have become stage-struck, perhaps when a small troupe employed by Ferdinando Lord Strange, and including Augustine Phillips and John Heminges, visited Norwich on 15 September 1593. On 24 October 1596, at St Laurence Pountney, near London Bridge, he married Elizabeth (died 1635), the only child of John Smart of the Strand, a gentleman and man of property: soon, if not immediately, the couple became fellow parishioners of the Heminges family at St Mary Aldermanbury, which had strong links with the theatre. Both Heminges and Condell served as churchwarden -- Heminges signing the register twice as second warden and three times as first, and Condell twice in 1617 as second warden. Nine children were born to the Condells there between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived infancy: Elizabeth, the third daughter of that name, baptized on 26 October 1606; Henry, baptized on 6 May 1610 (died 1630); and William, baptized on 26 May 1611. 
Condell is known to have played in 'Every Man in his Humour' and 'Every Man out of his Humour', written for the Chamberlain's Men by Ben Jonson, in 1598 and 1599. In 1603 James I acceded to the English throne and the Chamberlain's Men became the King's Men; in their first licence, dated 19 May, Condell is named after Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, Phillips, and Heminges. In the next, dated 27 March 1619, he is third after Heminges and Burbage and in fact came second, Burbage having died before the patent was in force. The King's Men, like the Chamberlain's Men, never provided lists of members or cast-lists: however, Condell is known to have acted in four more plays by Jonson -- 'Sejanus', 'Volpone', 'The Alchemist', and 'Catiline' -- between 1603 and 1611, in addition, presumably, to all of Shakespeare's. He also played the Cardinal in the first performance of John Webster's 'The Duchess of Malfi', put on at Blackfriars probably in spring 1614; at a revival about 1621, when he was busy editing the Shakespeare folio, he was replaced by Richard Robinson -- who married Richard Burbage's widow, Winifred, in 1622. 
In the retrospective list of twenty-six 'Principall Actors' in all Shakespeare's plays in the first folio (the word 'actor' meaning all theatre men, not just performers) Condell is eighth. He was perhaps the principal player after Burbage, for when Phillips died in 1605 he left a will listing all members and associates of the company, beginning with Shakespeare and Condell and bequeathing them each a 30's'. gold piece to buy a ring in his memory -- a very common bequest at the time. 
Condell and Heminges were uniquely qualified to edit Shakespeare's plays for the folio: they were the last surviving members of the original Chamberlain's Men established in 1594. They dedicated the folio to William, third earl of Pembroke, and Philip, earl of Montgomery and fourth earl of Pembroke, declaring that they had so much favoured the plays in performance and the author in his lifetime that the new volume 'ask'd' to be theirs. The editors' sole aim was to 'keepe the memory of so worthy a Friend, & Fellow alive, as was our SHAKESPEARE' -- the 'our' emphasizing their admiration and love. It is sometimes supposed that the printers and publishers of the folio were also its editors, but they could not have matched Condell and Heminges in their long professional and personal association with the playwright -- closely involved in each play from conception and casting, through rehearsals, to performance. 
The scope and methods of the editors' attempts to 'collect' and 'gather' (their words) sources of information are the subject of ceaseless and highly conjectural study and debate. Their main source would have been Shakespeare's 'foul papers', the current term for an author's original manuscript, when available, as distinct from 'fair copies' (a phrase still in use) -- these probably made by professional scribes. The term for the manuscript stage-text was 'the book': the 'bookkeeper' or 'book-holder', who was also the prompter, had to submit an authentic acting version to the master of the revels (as agent of the lord chamberlain) for endorsement: without the 'approved book' no performance was possible. 
Individual plays could be bought and sold, and eighteen of Shakespeare's plays were printed in quarto before publication of the thirty-six in the folio. The folio provided eighteen more hitherto unpublished texts, plus (according to the editors) 'perfect' texts of imperfect quartos. Without their efforts the world would have been deprived of plays including 'The Tempest', 'Measure for Measure', 'As You Like It', 'Twelfth Night', 'Julius Caesar', 'Macbeth', and 'Antony and Cleopatra'. 
In promoting their volume the editors claimed to have devoted much 'care, and paine' to correcting 'diverse stolne, and surreptitious copies, maimed, and deformed by the frauds and stealthes of injurious impostors' and to have restored the rest 'absolute in their numbers' as Shakespeare had 'conceived' them. E. K. Chambers once observed that an epistle is an advertisement rather than an affidavit: perhaps a little grudgingly he conceded that 'genuine pains' were taken to secure reliable texts. From 1608, when the King's Men were able to move into their walled and roofed Blackfriars playing-place, everything of value would have been kept there for safety, and everything in the open-air second Globe -- apart from the theatre itself -- survived the fire during a performance in 1613. Their rivals, the Admiral's Men, were 'utterly undone' when in 1621 their only playhouse, the open-air Fortune (close to the Barbican site) was 'burnt downe in two howres & all their apparrell & play-bookes lost' ('The Letters of John Chamberlain', ed. N. E. McClure, 1939, 2.415). 
Like many men who had done well in the capital, Condell acquired a country house in later life. A number of riverside villages, upstream from London and Westminster, were especially popular: the Condells chose Fulham in Middlesex on the north bank. Both died there, but were buried at St Mary Aldermanbury, Henry on 29 December 1627, Elizabeth on 3 October 1635: they are entered in the register as 'Mr Condell' and 'Mrs Cundell', a mark of status. (The 'u' sometimes appearing in the name probably indicates its pronunciation.) As a man of extensive properties and part ownership of the Globe and Blackfriars, Condell appointed four overseers of his will, including Heminges and Richard Burbage's elder brother Cuthbert; he expressed the wish to be buried 'decentlie in the night tyme' (Honigmann and Brock, 156-60). His well-to-do widow wished no part of her estate to be 'prodigally spent, nor lewdly wasted' by her son William (ibid., 182-6). She bequeathed her executors, Burbage and Thomas Seaman, $10 each for their pains, and wished Seaman to have all her books -- including, no doubt, a copy of the Shakespeare folio. 
St Mary Aldermanbury was destroyed in the fire of London and rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren, but almost destroyed again in 1940 by enemy air attack which flattened much of this part of the City. The site is now a garden, with a bust of Shakespeare surrounded by flowering trees and shrubs. Inscriptions on the base recall the achievement of the two former long-term parishioners who, with no thought of profit or fame, collected Shakespeare's dramatic writings and gave them to the world: 'they thus merited the gratitude of mankind'.

Condell, Henry (bap. 1757, d. 1824), musician and composer, was born in London and baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 15 December 1757. He was the son of John Condell (died 1779), a Covent Garden box-keeper, and his common-law wife, Ann Wilson. His father had previously been married to Jane Wilcox (died 1752) and they had two children, John ('fl'. 1779-1784) and Charlotte (died 1759). 
Condell gave his first public performance on 23 May 1771 as soloist in a harpsichord concerto at Covent Garden Theatre. On 25 May 1773 he played his own harpsichord concerto for his father's benefit at the same venue. He was elected a member of the Royal Society of Musicians on 1 March 1778 and between the years 1793 and 1818 served as a member of its governing body, the court of assistants. By 1783 he was engaged as a member of the King's Theatre opera band and he played at the Pantheon with the same ensemble in 1790-91. In his 'Musical Directory for the Year 1794' Joseph Doane lists him as a performer at the Concerts of Antient Music and the Professional Concerts (1794). He continued at the King's Theatre from 1800; Sainsbury describes him as 'a good violinist' (Sainsbury, 1.169) there. Condell's compositions included several songs, a piano sonata (1806?), harpsichord duets (published after 1810), and overtures to Michael Kelly's new operas -- 'A House to be Sold' (Drury Lane, 17 November 1802), 'The Hero of the North', and 'Love Laughs at Locksmiths' (Haymarket, 25 July 1803) -- and William Dimond's 'Hero of the North' (19 February 1803). He also wrote music for Fawcett's ballet 'The Enchanted Island' (Haymarket, 20 June 1804) and for several stage plays and compilations. In 1811 he gained a prize at the Catch Club for his glee 'Loud Blowe the Wyndes'. 
Condell was a member of the committee that arranged the Royal Society of Music's annual concert at St Paul's in 1815. He left the King's Theatre in 1818, and by early December 1823 the news was shared with the Royal Society of Musicians that he was too unwell to attend meetings. He died at Cave House, Battersea, after a severe and lingering illness, on 24 June 1824. He is said to have had a wife and a daughter, Jane, but it seems that both predeceased him. His will, dated 5 April 1821, included annuities and jewellery bequeathed to friends and relations. His instruments and music collection were sold at auction by W. P. Musgrave on 30 March 1825.

Conder, James (1761-1823), numismatist and antiquary, the youngest of seven sons of John Conder DD (1714-1781), Independent minister, and his wife, Susan, daughter of John Flindell, leatherseller of Ipswich, was born at Mile End, Middlesex, on 22 October 1761. He was educated at the dissenters' academy at Ware and under Mr French, a Unitarian minister. At the age of nineteen he moved to Ipswich, where his brother John was working for Flindell (whom he later succeeded). Conder married, on 1 January 1790, Mary Foster (1758-1836), third daughter of George Notcutt, haberdasher, of Ipswich, and his wife, Thomasin Moore, and set up as linen draper in Tavern Street. He sold this business to Shepherd Ray in 1808, and reopened in the Buttermarket, Ipswich, in partnership with his wife's widowed sister Elizabeth Goddard as Goddard and Conder, haberdashers and snuffsellers. 
As well as mainstream coins Conder built up an unrivalled collection of trade tokens produced by firms as advertisement and as change at a time when small copper coins were in short supply. In the mid-1790s he issued several tokens advertising his drapery warehouse, the most striking designed by the eminent medallist John Milton (died 1805). Conder's enthusiasm ran to the lengths of contriving rarities by altering or breaking dies after striking small numbers of coins, and to the publication in 1798 and 1799 of a catalogue of all known tokens issued in the British Isles and the colonies 'within the last twenty years', a work sold at Bucklersbury in London by his elder brother Thomas. Although his projected history of nonconformism in Suffolk came to nothing, Conder's help is acknowledged by Walter Wilson in the preface to his 'Dissenting Churches' (1808), and by Benjamin Brook in his 'Lives of the Puritans' (1813). 
Conder's interest in Suffolk topography brought him the friendship of the Revd James Ford (1779-1850), who wrote a eulogistic obituary of Conder over the initials J. F. in the 'Gentleman's Magazine'. Conder's collection of prints and drawings to illustrate the county's history was celebrated, a model for those of G. R. S. Nassau and W. S. Fitch. His ownership of the manuscript copy of the Suffolk collections made 'c'.1655 by Matthias Candler (now Society of Antiquaries MS 667) caused much confusion in nineteenth-century literature when cited as the Conder MS. He played a principal part in founding the Ipswich Friendly Society in 1810 and was generous in its support. 
Conder died after a sudden illness on 22 March 1823 in the Buttermarket, Ipswich, and was buried six days later in the grounds of the Independent meeting-house in Tacket Street where the family worshipped. His brother-in-law the Revd Charles Atkinson, who was minister there, preached the sermon. The eldest of his seven children, James Notcutt Conder, took his father's place with his aunt in the business until her death in 1830 in the timber-framed house distinguished by its fine carved cornerpost, 8 feet high, at the corner of St Lawrence Lane and the Buttermarket. It is perhaps ironic that when in 1863 the house was demolished a hoard of over a hundred silver pennies of Ethelred the Unready, some minted in Ipswich, was discovered under the staircase; as they were 5 feet deep one can probably rule out the possibility that Conder hid the coins there for posterity. Conder's widow lived with her daughter Mary Nash in Wymondham, Norfolk, until her death in 1836, when she was buried beside her husband.

Conder, John (1714-1781), Independent minister and tutor, was born on 3 June 1714 at Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, the son of Jabez Conder (died 1727) and Elizabeth Linkern (1688/9-1730). He came from old nonconformist stock as both his father and grandfather served as minister to an Independent congregation at Croyden in Cambridgeshire. John was sent to school first with the Revd Mr Hicks, a Latin master at Potton, Bedfordshire. On the sudden death of his father from a riding accident in 1727, he was transferred to the grammar school at Hitchin, where he boarded first with Francis Robinson, who died suddenly from smallpox, and subsequently with the headmaster, Mr J. Newman. Conder's recovery from the same smallpox seems to mark a new seriousness in life, leaving behind 'wild' colleagues who enticed him into 'habits of idle-gossiping, card-playing and other vanities' ('Evangelical Magazine'). He was initially a reluctant scholar, and cherished the hope of following former generations of Conders in farming. After leaving school he proceeded to Dr Parsons's academy at Clerkenwell and from there to the academy run by the King's Head Society, under the direction of Dr Thomas Ridgley and Dr John Eames, then situated at the Plasterers' Hall, Moorfields. 
Conder started his ministerial career in Cambridge, at Hog Hill Independent Church on 23 November 1738, and was ordained there on 27 September following. Restoring harmony to a divided congregation, he reportedly gave instruction to three future bishops of the Church of England: Edmund Keen, William Markham, and Beilby Porteous. An encounter with a highwayman on the road to Peterborough became an evangelistic opportunity: Conder's goods were returned, but his assailant was soon recognized and apprehended. The highwayman was sentenced to death; Conder, who was diligent in visiting him in prison, believed he died a converted man. On 8 March 1744 he married Susan (died 1785), daughter of John Flindell, leather seller, of Ipswich; they had seven sons. 
During his Cambridge pastorate Conder penned 'A Serious Address to all Sober Christians of every Denomination among Protestant Dissenters... on the Important Subject of a Gospel Ministry' (1753); this brought him to the attention of the managers of the King's Head Society, who in October 1754 appointed him theological tutor in place of Dr Zephaniah Marryat and boarding tutor at their academy as it moved from Moorfields to Mile End in the following year. To these duties he added the merchant's lecture at Pinners' Hall from October 1759, and on 21 May 1760 he became assistant to the increasingly enfeebled Thomas Hall, minister at Little Moorfields (later the Pavement); he succeeded him on his death in 1762. When the academy moved to Homerton in 1770 Conder ceased to be boarding tutor, residing in Hackney instead. From 1778 William Bennet was his assistant at the Pavement. 
In occupying a major London pulpit while fully engaged in running an academy, Conder had double work imposed upon 'his Head, Heart and Hands' (Winter, 36). In so doing, his great aim was to provide a scholarly evangelical ministry for the churches at a time when there appeared to be much heterodoxy. Thus in both pulpit and study he affirmed the importance of evangelical doctrine; after searching the scriptures 'with the closest attention and care' he could attest its truth with 'full assurance of faith'; 'it was the darling theme of his ministrations to recommend Christ in his person, office, work, and grace unto poor sinners' (Webb, 26). He stressed the importance of the nonconformist tradition, but was not sectarian, for even among dissenters he discerned too much party spirit both within and between denominations. Concern for unity was not, however, to be at the expense of doctrine; indeed he lamented the 'general disrelish and disuse of the several great doctrines of Scripture and the reformation' (J. Conder, 'A Serious Address to All Sober Christians... on the Important Subject of a Gospel Ministry', 1753, 14) by younger divines, which he identified as the major reason why, under their leadership, once flourishing congregations languished. Critical that insufficient scrutiny was undertaken of those offering themselves for ministry, he even included Philip Doddridge within the terms of his censure. Scrutiny of academic capacity was not enough, for vocational aptitude for the evangelical ministry had also to be probed. Although goodness was a necessary prerequisite, Conder argued that not every good man was qualified to undertake a gospel ministry, which required that candidates be 'partakers of the evangelical grace of regeneration', a conviction shared, he believed, by traditional Calvinists, moderate Calvinists, and Arminians alike (ibid., 22). 
Addressing the Society for the Reformation of Manners in 1763 Conder affirmed the importance of the Reformation in securing that 'liberty, civil and religious, which is the boast and the glory of Britons', but argued that the Reformation needed to be earthed in the lifestyle of each individual. Furthermore the maintenance of civil order was an important ministry, for which all Christians had a responsibility, for by their lives they either advanced Satan's kingdom or curbed it. Since governors and magistrates were God's standing representatives in maintaining order, they needed to be appointed wisely. For their part, Christian ministers were called upon 'both to preach down and live down the vice and immoralities of the times' (J. Conder, 'A Sermon Preached before the Society for the Reformation of Manners', 1763, 16). 
Without prior knowledge on his part, Conder was awarded a DD by the University of Aberdeen. The sudden death of his son William, aged nineteen, in 1769 was a trauma from which he never fully recovered. A paralytic stroke, which he survived only a few weeks, occasioned his death in Hackney on 30 May 1781. Conder was buried at Bunhill Fields the Tuesday following, his self-composed epitaph reading: 'Peccavi, Resipui, Confidi, Amavi, Requiesco, Resurgam. Et ex gratia Christi, ut ut indignus, regnabo.' He was survived by his wife. Of his children, Thomas was a cartographer and bookseller and the father of Josiah Conder (1789-1855), hymn writer and doyen of nonconformist journalists, and James Conder (1761-1823) a haberdasher who made a name for himself as a numismatist.

Conder, Josiah (1789-1855), bookseller and writer, was born in Falcon Street, Aldersgate, London, on 17 September 1789, the son of Thomas Conder (1746/7-1831), a map engraver and bookseller, and his wife, Elisabeth. His grandfather Dr John Conder was president of Old College, Homerton. In 1795 Josiah contracted smallpox, and the severity of the disease entirely destroyed his right eye. He was educated under the Revd Mr Palmer at Hackney, and at the early age of ten contributed essays to the 'Monthly Preceptor'. 
At thirteen Conder left school and entered the bookselling business of his father, at 30 Bucklersbury, London, where in his leisure he carried out a system of self-education. To the eleventh number of 'The Athenaeum' (1806), edited by Dr Aikin, he contributed some lines entitled 'The Withered Oak', and about this time he became acquainted with James Montgomery and Ann Taylor. His poetical contributions to various periodicals being well received, in 1810 he published an anonymous volume entitled 'The Associate Minstrels', to which Ann and Jane Taylor and others contributed. It reached a second edition within three years. 
In the autumn of 1811 his father retired from the business for health reasons, and Josiah Conder took it over. On 8 February 1815 he married Joan Elizabeth, second daughter of Roger Thomas of Southgate, Middlesex, and granddaughter on her mother's side of Louis Francois Roubiliac, the sculptor. They resided at his new shop at 18 St Paul's Churchyard until 1819, when he disposed of the business to B. J. Holdsworth. They had four sons and one daughter. Conder had become proprietor of the 'Eclectic Review' in 1814, and he retained the management of this periodical until 1837, when he transferred it to Dr Thomas Price, having during his editorship supported the dissenting interest. He was a great letter-writer, and kept up a correspondence with James Montgomery, Robert Southey, Revd Robert Hall, Revd John Foster, and other literary men of the day. In 1818 he brought out a work in two volumes, entitled 'On Protestant Nonconformity', of which a second edition appeared in 1822. In 1824 he entered into an agreement with James Duncan of Paternoster Row to edit the afterwards well-known series of the 'Modern Traveller', undertaking in the first instance to furnish the volume on Palestine only. Ultimately he compiled the whole set of thirty volumes (1825-9), having assistance in only one or two of them. The series was successful, despite the fact of its editor's never having left his native country. On the establishment of the 'Patriot' newspaper in 1832 to represent the principles of evangelical nonconformity, Conder became its editor, an office which he held for twenty-three years. 
Conder was one of the most industrious of men. Throughout his life he worked long hours for the support of himself and his family, yet he found time to act as a preacher, and to keep up an extensive correspondence on religious and literary topics. He was a prolific writer, editor, and compiler. Some of his works in these roles include: 'Thomas Johnson's Reasons for Dissent' (1821); 'Memoirs of Pious Women, by Gibbons and Burder' (1823); 'The Star in the East with other Poems' (1824); 'The Law of the Sabbath' (1830; new edn, 1852); 'Wages or the Whip' (an essay on free and slave labour, 1833); 'The Congregational Hymn-Book' (1834; another edn, 1836); 'Narrative of a Residence in South Africa, by T. Pringle, with a Sketch of the Author' (1835); 'An Analytical Sketch of All Religions' (1838); and 'The Psalms of David Imitated by I. Watts, Revised by J. Conder' (1851). 
Conder wrote steadily until 9 November 1855, when he fell ill from jaundice, from which he never recovered. He died at his home, 28 Belsize Road, St John's Wood, London, on 27 December 1855, and was buried in Abney Park cemetery on 3 January 1856.

Conlaid (d. 518/520). On the other hand, the 'Vita prima', which powerful arguments would date earlier than Cogitosus, is more interested in Brigit's relationship with the people of her father, Dubthach, the branches of the Fothairt settled on the north-western frontier of Leinster. The same is true of the ninth-century vernacular life, 'Bethu Brigte', which is related to, but not dependent on, the 'Vita prima'; both probably drew on a lost life of the mid-seventh century. These local affiliations were to be enduring: Brigit has remained to this day the patron saint of Kildare, but her cult has continued to be vigorous around Croghan Hill in Offaly, which is mentioned in 'Bethu Brigte' and was close to the home of her father.

Conduitt, John (1688-1737), politician, of Cranbury Park in Hampshire, was the son of Leonard and Sarah Conduitt, and was baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, on 8 March 1688. He was admitted into Westminster School as a king's scholar in June 1701, and in June 1705 matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge. After leaving the university he travelled in Europe. In 1711 he was judge-advocate with the British forces in Portugal, and in the following year he was made captain in a regiment of dragoons serving in that country. On 26 August 1717 he married Catherine Barton (died 1739), the niece of Sir Isaac Newton and the reputed mistress of the late Charles Montagu, earl of Halifax. The couple had one daughter. 
In June 1721 Conduitt was elected, on petition, whig member for Whitchurch, Hampshire, which he represented during the 1720s as a loyal supporter of Walpole's government. At this time he was also performing the duties of master of the Royal Mint for his wife's uncle, and on Newton's death on 20 March 1727 Conduitt succeeded him in this position. Soon after, Conduitt drew up a memorial sketch for Fontenelle, who was producing Newton's eulogy for the French Academie des Sciences. The finished work was not satisfactory to Conduitt, who criticized Fontenelle for having 'neither abilities nor inclination to do justice to that great man, who has eclipsed the glory of their hero, Descartes'. He resolved to write Newton's life and began to gather information. Though the biography was never written, Conduitt collected a wealth of material, including Newton's famous comparison of himself to 'a boy playing on the sea-shore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me'. 
In his post at the mint Conduitt wrote the clear and much praised 'Observations on the Present State of our Gold and Silver Coins' (1730), posthumously published in 1774. The chief objects of the memoir, drawn up at a time when gold was falling in value and silver rising, were to advocate the coinage of the latter metal in preference to the former, and to recommend a reduction in the weight of the silver currency. 
By the early 1730s Conduitt had become a relatively prominent parliamentary speaker, defending the government on a number of issues, including Walpole's maintenance of the 'Septennial Act'. In 1734 he was re-elected to his seat but chose to represent Southampton. Two years later (12 January 1736) he introduced a successful bill repealing an early seventeenth-century act against conjuration and witchcraft. He died on 23 May 1737 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on the right-hand side of Sir Isaac Newton. His wife, Catherine, who died in 1739, was buried with him. Their daughter married on 8 July 1740 Viscount Lymington, the eldest son of the first earl of Portsmouth; their son succeeded as second earl of Portsmouth.

Condy, Nicholas (1793-1857), landscape painter, was baptized on 2 April 1793 at Withiel, Cornwall, the son of Nicholas Condy of Mevagissey and his wife, Elizabeth Thomas. He had at least two siblings: John Thomas Condy ('bap'. 1791 at Mevagissey) and Ann Condy ('bap'. 1795). He was gazetted to the 43rd regiment as an ensign, on 9 May 1811, and served in the Peninsular War. On 3 October 1814 he married Ann Trevanion Pyle (1792-1860), the daughter of Captain Mark Oates of the marines, at Stoke Damerel, Devon. On 24 February 1818 he was promoted lieutenant, and that same year he retired on half pay. He afterwards lived in Plymouth, where he devoted himself to becoming a professional painter. 
Condy produced chiefly small watercolours on tinted paper, about 8 inches by 5 inches, which he sold at prices ranging from 15's'. to 1 guinea. He painted many shore scenes with figures and craft in the background, mostly local to Plymouth; he favoured 'rather garish red and greens', and his technique has been described as 'somewhat impressionistic', and 'very appealing' (Mallalieu, 'Watercolour artists', 65). 
In the 1830s Condy associated with the Society of Plymouth Artists and Amateurs, which is said to have met fortnightly in the city. Between 1830 and 1845 he exhibited two landscapes at the Royal Academy, four at the British Institution, and a single work at Suffolk Street. He also exhibited two works at the Liverpool Academy in 1853, 'An Interior -- Children Buying Sweets' and 'A Cornish Cottage'. His best-known painting is 'The Old Hall at Cotehele on a Rent-Day', which was purchased by the earl of Mount Edgcumbe. Condy later published 'Cothele, on the Banks of the Tamar' ('c'.1850), illustrated with seventeen lithographed plates. 
Condy died on 8 January 1857 at his home, 10 Mount Pleasant Terrace, Plymouth, having suffered paralysis in the last four years of his life, and was buried in St Andrew's churchyard, Plymouth. He was survived by his wife. His son,

Coney, John (1786-1833), draughtsman and engraver, was born in Ratcliff Highway, London, and was apprenticed to an architect, but he never followed the profession. Among his early studies were pencil drawings of the interior of Westminster Abbey. In 1805 he exhibited the first of ten works at the Royal Academy, a 'Perspective View of Lambeth Palace', from 39 Craven Street, Strand. His first publication was a work entitled 'A Series of Views Representing the Exterior and Interior of Warwick Castle' (1815). The plates were drawn and etched by himself. 
Coney was next employed for fourteen years by Harding to draw and engrave a series of exterior and interior views of the cathedrals and abbey churches of England, intended to illustrate the new edition of Sir William Dugdale's 'Monasticon Anglicanum', edited by Sir Henry Ellis (1846). In 1829 he began to engrave cathedrals, town halls, and other buildings in France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy, with descriptions in four languages. These were published in London in 1832. The next important work, also engraved and designed by himself, was 'The Beauties of Continental Architecture' (1843), which included twenty-eight plates and fifty vignettes. Coney was employed by the architect Charles Cockerell to engrave a large view of Rome, and he also engraved some drawings of the Law Courts, Westminster, for Sir John Soane. In addition to the above-mentioned works he was the author of 'English Ecclesiastical Edifices of the Olden Time' (1842, the plates of which were previously used in Dugdale's 'Monasticon') and 'Original Drawings of London Churches' (1820). Coney died of an enlargement of the heart in Leicester Place, Camberwell, on 15 August 1833. Prints and drawings by him are in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin, Manchester City Galleries, and the Nottingham Castle Museum.

Conall mac Comgall (d. 574). In 563 Conall was visited in Britain by St Columba (died 597), who had recently arrived from Ireland to begin his life of 'pilgrimage'. There were two traditions about the foundation of Columba's monastery in Iona. Pictish tradition was the probable source of Bede's statement that the island was given to Columba by Picts. But an entry attached to the notice of King Conall's death in the Irish annals says that Conall was the donor. There may have been truth in both traditions. In 568 Conall joined with the king of Meath in an expedition in 'Iardoman', probably the Inner Hebrides. He died in 574 and was succeeded by his cousin Aedan (or Aedan) mac Gabran. The choice of Conall's successor seems to have lain between Aedan and his brother Eoganan, and it was the latter who at first had the powerful support of Columba. But, prompted by angelic visions, according to Iona tradition, the saint changed his mind and gave Aedan his blessing. 
Aedan was remembered partly for the concord he reached with the northern Ui Neill relating to the status of the Irish part of Aedan's kingdom. In a famous meeting at Druim Cete (or Druim Cett) in Derry, it was agreed (or so it appears) that military service from the Dal Riata in Ireland should be paid to Aed, son of Ainmire, and his successors, their taxes and tribute to Aedan and his successors. This implicitly ruled out any rights claimed by kings of the Ulaid over the Irish Dal Riata. The annals date the meeting in the year after Aedan's accession, that is in 575, but there are difficulties in the dating, and it has been plausibly argued that the true date may have been 'c'.590. 
There was a tradition that Aedan had fought against the Picts during thirteen years, seemingly before he became king. It is doubtful whether any of his later battles, noticed in the annals, involved hostility between him and the Picts. His last battle, which Bede dated in 603, was fought at 'Degsastan', perhaps near the present English-Scottish border. It was a brave attempt to halt the northward spread of the Angles of Northumbria, but Aedan's army was heavily defeated and, says Bede, from that time until the present day ('c'.731) no king of Scots in Britain had dared to engage in battle against the Angles. 
Aedan died a few years later. Figures in lists and annals (none very dependable at this period) suggest that he may have died in 609, but had ceased to reign in 608. The date 609 is slightly confirmed by separate sources (the martyrology of Tallaght and the eleventh-century prophecy of Berchan) which would fix the day of his death as 17 April, a Thursday. Berchan says that he died in Kintyre, Fordun that he was buried at Kilkerran (Campbeltown). 
Aedan had a number of sons, of whom at least four died in battle in their father's lifetime. His successor,

Congreve, Richard (1818-1899), positivist, was born at Leamington Hastings, Warwickshire, on 4 September 1818, the third son of Thomas Congreve, a farmer, and his wife, Julia. After attending the school run by his uncle Walter Bury in Boulogne, he spent five years (1832-7) at Rugby School, acquiring the moral earnestness, religious latitudinarianism, and political Liberalism characteristic of its headmaster, Dr Thomas Arnold. In 1837 Congreve entered Wadham College, Oxford, on a scholarship; he earned his BA with a first class in 'literae humaniores' in 1840, and proceeded MA in 1843. His social idealism found expression at the Oxford Union, of which he was president in 1841, and in 'the Decade', a debating society which included his Rugby contemporaries Arthur Hugh Clough and Matthew Arnold. Congreve took clerical orders in 1843, was elected a fellow of Wadham in 1844, and after a period as an assistant master at Rugby, returned to Wadham in 1848 as a tutor. In the following years he was active in the struggle for university reform with A. P. Stanley, Benjamin Jowett, Mark Pattison, and Goldwin Smith, colleagues he at times found insufficiently ardent. 
Congreve's impatience with compromise on many issues accounts for his attraction to the systematic ideas of Auguste Comte. After the revolution of 1848, Congreve visited the philosopher in Paris several times and was encouraged by him to study the positivist philosophy, polity, and religion in relation to British history and politics. Determining to do so free of Oxford's constraints, Congreve resigned his fellowship in June 1854 and moved to Wandsworth, Surrey, planning to earn his living by tutoring. Marriage in the same year to his cousin Maria, daughter of J. Bury, a Coventry surgeon, provided unquestioning devotion that helped him withstand the coming storm of criticism. 
Maria Congreve's family in Warwickshire had known George Eliot, and when she and George Henry Lewes settled in Wandsworth in 1859 they became friends of the Congreves and gave moral and financial support to the positivist mission. Congreve could also count on encouragement from three former Wadham pupils -- Frederic Harrison, John Henry Bridges, and Edward Spencer Beesly. Early fruits of his positivist studies were his tendentious notes to a new edition of Aristotle's 'Politics' (1855); his endorsement of temporary dictatorship in modern Europe in 'The Roman Empire of the West' (1855); and two anti-imperialist pamphlets, 'Gibraltar' and 'India' (1857). Comte, who had urged him to write the first, demanding Britain's immediate surrender of Gibraltar to Spain, was so gratified by it that in 1857 he appointed Congreve head of his British disciples. They were, however, few in number, and all subject to ridicule. Undeterred, Congreve published a translation of Comte's 'Catechisme positiviste' in 1858, expounding the 'religion of humanity', and in 1866 earned membership of the Royal College of Physicians, solely as a prerequisite for the positivist priesthood. Meanwhile he was drawing fire for supporting the trade unions' struggle for legal status, and advocating Irish independence, a liberal foreign policy, and parliamentary reform. 
In written controversy Congreve could hold his own, but when he delivered an important series of public lectures on positivism in 1867 even his friend George Eliot found his delivery 'chilling'. Although also aware of his limitations, in 1870 Harrison, Bridges, and Beesly, with others now calling themselves positivists, leased a small hall at 19 (now 20 Rugby Street) Chapel Street, off Lamb's Conduit Street, London, as a meeting-place and accepted Congreve's leadership. He moved to nearby Mecklenburgh Square, and soon began administering Comte's version of baptism. There were hymns and invocations to Humanity and pronouncements on political issues. By 1877 Congreve had completed volume four of the British positivists' four-volume translation of Comte's 'Systeme de politique positive'. Given all this activity, he was understandably irritated by the slackness of Comte's successor in Paris, Pierre Laffitte. By declaring his independence from the Paris leader in 1878, Congreve precipitated a schism in his own movement that had been long brewing. He remained at Chapel Street while his most distinguished followers, Harrison, Bridges, and Beesly, opened their own centre, Newton Hall. 
Following the schism, Congreve introduced additional rituals, justifying T. H. Huxley's jibe that positivism was 'Catholicism minus Christianity'. But he eschewed sacerdotal garb: his photographs in his 'Historical Lectures' and the third volume of his 'Essays Political, Social and Religious' (both edited by his wife in 1900) show a benevolent-looking, patrician gentleman. In his last years he wrote largely on religious subjects, and despite chronic bad health, led his small congregation until his death at Home Lodge, Worsley Road, Hampstead, London, on 5 July 1899. His widow stayed on at their last address, 55 Palace Gardens, Kensington, until her death in 1915. Only then did the rival positivist congregations unite.

Congreve, William (1670-1729), playwright and poet, was born on either 24 or 31 January 1670 in Bardsey Grange, Yorkshire, the son of William Congreve (1637-1708) and his wife, Mary (1636?-1715), daughter of Mary, 'nee' Bright, and Walter Browning (died 1636). Congreve's mother was the great-granddaughter of Dr Timothy Bright (1549/50-1615), author of 'A Treatise of Melancholie' (1586) and 'Characterie: an Arte of Shorte, Swifte, and Secret Writing by Character' (1586). She grew up in the household of her mother's second husband, Dr George Roe (died 1651), of Doncaster, within easy distance of her cousins the Lewises of Ledstone Park, near Marr. It was to one of these, John Lewis (died 1671), a successful merchant knighted by Charles II and created a baronet after the Restoration, that the Congreves owed their tenancy of Bardsey Grange. William Congreve senior was the second son of Richard Congreve (1609-1689) of Stretton Hall, Staffordshire, and Anne, 'nee' Fitzherbert, of Norbury, Derbyshire. Congreve was described as 'the only surviving son' in information supplied to Giles Jacob's 'Poetical Register' in 1719 (p. 41), and there is evidence of only one sister. 
The Congreve family was in London by 22 September 1672 when William's sister Elizabeth was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden. The following year Congreve's father secured a passport to the Low Countries to purchase coach horses for the duke of York. In 1674 he was granted a commission as lieutenant in the army in Ireland and moved with his family to join the garrison at the seaport of Youghal. This was the home of Richard Boyle, second earl of Cork and first earl of Burlington. Congreve's father was to manage part of the earl's estates at Youghal and Lismore Castle from about 1690, after he was discharged from a commission as captain in the earl of Danby's volunteer regiment. Congreve later dedicated his first play, 'The Old Batchelor', to Charles, the second earl of Burlington and third earl of Cork, acknowledging 'the particular Ties, by which I am bound to your Lordship and Family'. 
William senior was transferred in 1678 to Carrickfergus, where he joined his uncle Christopher Congreve (1622-1706). Both men were with companies quartered at Kilkenny by late 1681. Since children of those in service to the duke of Ormond, lord lieutenant of Ireland, were entitled to the free privileges and benefits of Kilkenny College, Congreve, then almost twelve, may have entered there at once. His portrait, signed 'W. D. Claret' (but possibly by Wolfgang William Claret) and painted about this time, shows a twelve-year-old of slight figure but determined chin, with blue eyes and curly brown hair. Dr Henry Rider, a graduate of Trinity College and later bishop of Killaloe, was then headmaster, in charge of about sixty students, who briefly included Jonathan Swift while Congreve was there (Swift left in April 1682). Congreve began his long and close friendship with Joseph Keally at Kilkenny College, when Keally joined the school in 1685. Dr Edward Hinton, the Greek scholar who succeeded Rider as headmaster in 1684, must have been instrumental in developing Congreve's considerable competence in Greek. 
Congreve matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 5 April 1686 'annos natus Sexdecim' ('aged sixteen'; TCD, 'Catalogus omnium studentium'). His tutor there, and Swift's, was the learned St George Ashe, mathematician, member of the Royal Society, later bishop of Cloyne, of Clogher, and of Derry. The presence in Congreve's library of such volumes as the 1684 editions of John Dryden's 'Essay of Dramatick Poesy' and Francois Hedelin's 'The Whole Art of the Stage' suggests that his interest in writing for the stage might have been an early one. The flourishing theatre in Dublin at the time probably contributed as well. Congreve's career at Trinity College was evidently cut short with the exodus of protestants from Ireland -- his name is deleted from the college buttery book in January 1687 and does not appear thereafter, although in 1696 Trinity College conferred the degree of MA on Congreve. He may have left with his parents for England and Stretton Hall in Staffordshire in March 1689. 
Congreve probably wrote 'Incognita', 'an Essay', he says, 'began and finished in the idler hours of a fortnight's time' ('Dedication'), during this stay in Staffordshire, and it was there he met Katherine Leveson, to whom he dedicated the book. A little later, in a 'slow Recovery from a Fit of Sickness' and still 'very much a Boy', he wrote a draft of his first play, 'The Old Batchelor' (Congreve, 'Amendments', 39). At some time before 21 March 1691, when he was admitted to the Middle Temple to study law, Congreve moved to London, lodging first in nearby Crane Court in the home of William Brookes. He was evidently able to put his knowledge of the law to good use later, but, like those of Sir George Etherege, William Wycherley, and Thomas Shadwell before him, his inclinations were decidedly towards theatre and poetry, and he was never called to the bar. 
In February 1692 Congreve made a muted entrance into the London literary world with the publication of 'Incognita' under the pseudonym Cleophil. The more public declaration of his arrival as a talented new writer appeared in the first week of June 1692 in Charles Gildon's 'Miscellany': he contributed imitations of two Horatian odes, two other poems, 'The Message' and 'The Decay: a Song', signed with his initials, and the irregular ode to Arabella Hunt 'Upon a Lady's Singing' signed 'Mr. Congreve'. Were it not for Leonora's song in 'Incognita' ('Ah! Whither, whither shall I fly', which was set to music by John Eccles) this would be the earliest evidence of Congreve's love of music and of his capacity for the most minute attention to it. He also assisted Dryden in his edition of the satires of Juvenal and Persius, supplying a translation of Juvenal's eleventh satire, published in 1693 but probably completed by early 1692, and he paid a classically informed compliment to Dryden in his 'Poem to Mr. Dryden on his Translation of Persius'. 
It was in this context that Congreve was taken up as a promising young dramatist. Two of his cousins, who had served with Thomas Southerne in Princess Anne's regiment of foot, had introduced Congreve to the older dramatist, and it is likely that Southerne in turn made Congreve acquainted with Dryden. Congreve completed a draft of 'The Old Batchelor' at some time before August 1692. Southerne's recollection was that when Dryden read it, he 'sayd he never saw such a first play in his life, but the Author not being acquainted with the Stage or the town, it woud be pity to have it miscarry for want of a little Assistance: the stuff was rich indeed, it only wanted the fashionable cutt of the town. (BL, Add. MS 4221, fol. 341)' Later in August Congreve went off to Ilam in Derbyshire to revise the play in light of suggestions made by these more experienced friends. Congreve describes the setting there in a letter to his friend Edward Porter on 21 August 1692: 'I have a little tried, what solitude and retirement can afford, which are here in perfection. I am now writing to you from before a black mountain nodding over me and a whole river in cascade falling so near me that even I can distinctly see it. (Hodges, 'Letters')' Kneller painted such a background into his much copied kit-cat portrait of Congreve in 1709. 
Samuel Foote recorded that when Congreve eventually brought his finished comedy to the players 'he read it so wretchedly ill, that they were on the point of rejecting it, till one of them good naturedly took it out of his hands and read it; when they were so fully persuaded of its excellence, that for half a year before it was acted he had the privilege of the house. ('Table-Talk', 133)' 
'The Old Batchelor' opened on 9 March 1693 at the Drury Lane Theatre for an exceptionally long run. The play was acted with a good cast that included Thomas Betterton and Thomas Doggett, as well as Elizabeth Barry, Elizabeth Bowman, Anne Bracegirdle, and Susanna Mountfort who, 'when they appeared together, in the last scene of 'the Old Batchelor', the audience was struck with so fine a groupe of beauty, and broke out into loud applauses' (Davies, 3.391). Congreve had recently provided a song for Southerne's 'The Maid's Last Prayer', 'Tell me no more I am deceiv'd', which Henry Purcell had set to music; it was Purcell's music that accompanied the songs in 'The Old Batchelor'. The play's immediate success was described by the earl of Burlington to Congreve's father: 'Your sons Play was Acted on Thursday last & was by all the hearers applauded to bee the best that has been Acted for many yeares. Monday is to bee his day which will bring him in a better sume of money than the writters of late have had, for the house will bee so full that very many persons of Quality cannot have a Seate all the places having been bespoken many days since. ('Complete Works', 4)' The crowds that had come to see and hear the play were of course eager to read it, and the first edition was reprinted twice by the end of the month: 'indeed the Wit which is diffus'd through it, makes it lose but few of those Charms in the Perusal, which yield such Pleasure in the Representation' ('London Gazette', 23-7 March 1693). 
There are no obvious single sources for 'The Old Batchelor', nor for any of Congreve's other plays. Nevertheless there is evidence of Congreve's wide reading in echoes of texts ranging from Plato, Epictetus, and Aesop, down to Cervantes and Scarron, and clearly he had read and heard Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Francis Beaumont, and John Fletcher, and his fellow dramatists Dryden, Etherege, and Wycherley. This range and originality are also evident in Congreve's other writings. 
Towards the end of March 1693, Dryden's 'Examen poeticum' was advertised as then being prepared for the press. The poem on Arabella Hunt is reprinted in it, together with the two imitations of Horace from the 1692 'Miscellany'. To those Congreve added a further 'paraphrase' of Horace. He also included extended translations from the last book of the 'Iliad', including Priam's lamentation as well as the lamentations of Hecuba, Andromache, and Helen. In his dedication to the volume, Dryden drew attention to Congreve's work: 'I am sure my Friend has added to the Tenderness which he found in the Original; and, without Flattery, surpass'd his Author.' Certainly by this time, with his prose narrative, his comedy, his verse, and his verse translations, Congreve was judged by many to be Dryden's rightful literary successor, although he lacked the political connections to be named poet laureate. Dryden expressed his own regret in verse: '
Oh that your Brows my Lawrel had sustain'd, 

Well had I been Depos'd, if You had reign'd! 

The Father had descended for the Son; 

For only You are lineal to the Throne. 
('To my dear friend Mr. Congreve', ll. 41-4)' Production of this first play was soon followed by 'The Double Dealer', which Congreve may have begun drafting even as 'The Old Batchelor' went into performance. Again, Dryden and other friends must have read or heard the play before it was performed. He mentioned to William Walsh on 12 December 1693 that he had written 'To my dear friend Mr. Congreve, on his comedy, call'd, 'the Double-Dealer'' before the play had been acted ('Letters of John Dryden', 62). It is unclear exactly when 'The Double Dealer' was first performed -- it was possibly in November 1693 -- but it had much the same cast as 'The Old Batchelor'. Dryden goes on in his letter to Walsh to describe how the play was 'censured by the greater part of the Town: and is defended onely by the best Judges, who... are commonly the fewest.... The women thinke he has exposed their Bitchery too much; & the Gentlemen are offended with him; for the discovery of their follyes.' After the enthusiasm that had greeted his first play, the poor reception of 'The Double Dealer' was particularly disappointing for the young dramatist, who had carefully constructed his play to remain true to 'the three Unities of the Drama' ('Dedication'), with a plot tailored to fit his moral. Although Congreve must have been encouraged by a royal command performance for Queen Mary in the following January, his unhappiness with his general audience was all too clear in the dedication (to his patron Charles Montagu, later first earl of Halifax) published with the first edition of the play in 1694. Congreve removed this uncharacteristically intemperate attack on his 'Illiterate Criticks' from subsequent editions. 
For some time a dispute had been developing between the actors and the patentees of the Drury Lane Theatre. The loss in 1692 of three of the most popular actors -- William Mountfort (murdered), Anthony Leigh (died), and James Nokes (retired) -- and a subsequent drop in audience numbers did not help matters. The company's debts were increasing with the expensive productions given to Purcell's operas, and then in 1693 a realignment led to a whole new managerial approach, unwelcome to the senior actors. The result was that most of the more experienced actors revolted, led by Thomas Betterton. Early in 1695 Betterton, Bracegirdle, Barry, and others secured a licence from the lord chamberlain to reopen the Lincoln's Inn Theatre in the tennis-courts there. The composer John Eccles, already associated with Congreve, became master of the music. Congreve had written 'Love for Love' by the end of 1694, and it had been read and accepted for production at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. Nevertheless Congreve delayed signing a contract until the outcome of the dispute was clear, and so was able to transfer his play to the new company. Even though a couple of the actors Congreve might well have cast remained with the Drury Lane Company, 'Love for Love' brilliantly opened the Lincoln's Inn Theatre on 30 April 1695: 'Extraordinary well Acted, chiefly the Part of 'Ben' the Sailor [by Thomas Doggett], it took 13 Days Successively' (Downes, 44). 
The play was dedicated to the earl of Dorset, who, as lord chamberlain, had helped secure the patent for Betterton's company. According to Colley Cibber the success of 'Love for Love' brought Congreve not only the usual profits from the play itself, but the offer of a full share in the new playhouse (Cibber, 161). The run of recorded performances at both theatres testified to the continued popularity of 'Love for Love' through the eighteenth century, matched only by that of 'The Old Batchelor', and it has continued to be the most often produced of Congreve's works. On stage, it is his most wholly successful play, dramatic in the pace and shape of its action, with wit and varied comic turns. 
When the critic John Dennis sent some notes on Ben Jonson's comedies for his comments, Congreve replied with a letter dated 10 July 1695. The timing of his remarks makes them particularly pertinent to the characters in 'Love for Love', which had opened only a few months before. His letter was first published as an essay 'Concerning humour in comedy' in Dennis's 'Letters upon Several Occasions' (1696). Here Congreve extends the meaning of humour beyond mere affectation to include a bias of the mind and complexity of character, giving humour an edge that the superficially 'humorous' representation of vanities and fopperies might otherwise lack. The letter explains his compassion in exculpating those whose physical condition was none of their own fault, his amused and tolerant exposure of others' affectations and follies, and his severity in judging those whose vicious conduct was deeply prejudicial to the social harmony secured by true wit and exemplified in the resolution of comedy. 
Almost as soon as the new theatre had been opened and 'Love for Love' performed, Congreve was seriously at work on his first tragedy, 'The Mourning Bride', his major poetic work of the 1690s. It opens memorably to Godfrey Finger's 'soft Musick' and the line: 'Musick has charms to sooth a savage Breast'. Act III concludes just as memorably with Zara's speech: '
Heav'n has no Rage, like Love to Hatred turn'd, 

Nor Hell a Fury, like a Woman scorn'd. 

' 
'The Mourning Bride' was first performed at the Lincoln's Inn Theatre, probably on 27 February 1697, and was an instant success. Hopkins records the audience melting 'with Pity at the moving Strains' (Hopkins, 'Epistle... to Mr. Yalden'); Samuel Wesley wrote of Congreve's ability to move his audience (S. Wesley, 'Epistle to a Friend Concerning Poetry', 1700, 19); Charles Gildon confirms that 'This Play had the greatest Success, not only of all Mr. 'Congreve''s, but indeed of all the Plays that ever I can remember on the English stage, excepting none of the incomparable 'Otway''s' (Gildon). Written in irregular blank verse, following Dryden in his tragedies 'Don Sebastian' (1689) and 'Cleomenes' (1692), 'The Mourning Bride' was so popular that it gave rise to two authorized and two pirated editions in 1697, and a third edition in 1703. Congreve continued to work on the verse, revising the metre and making extensive cuts for the 1703 edition. The play remained a favourite through the eighteenth century: the role of Zara was a speciality of the tragic actress Sarah Siddons in the 1780s and 1790s. Smollett adapted parts of Act III for his graveyard scenes in 'Ferdinand Count Fathom', and Jefim Schirmann claims the tragedy is the first work of English literature to be translated into Hebrew. 
The pamphleteer Jeremy Collier was addressing serious abuses in late seventeenth-century theatre when he wrote his 'Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage' (1698). He was not alone in recognizing what Congreve himself called the 'licentious Practice of the Modern Theatre' ('Dedication', 'The Mourning Bride'). But Collier heavy-handedly drove his argument well beyond reform of the theatre to its destruction, attacking in particular Dryden, Congreve, and John Vanbrugh. Congreve followed several others -- John Dennis ('The Usefulness of the Stage') and Vanbrugh ('A Short Vindication of 'The Relapse' and 'The Provok'd Wife'') among them -- in his reply. His 'Amendments of Mr. Collier's False and Imperfect Citations', published on 12 July 1698, set down basic principles, and easily refuted Collier's more foolish accusations, but Congreve was not at his best as a controversialist and, overall, his was not the most effective response to Collier. 
Congreve's more considered reply was perhaps 'The Way of the World', a play that has sustained the highest literary reputation of all his work for its sheer verbal wit, its complex design, and its half-dozen brilliantly written and actable scenes. In his dedication of the first edition to Ralph Montagu, earl of Montagu, Congreve pays tribute to the quality of Montagu's company and the ambience of Boughton House, where he had spent the summer of 1699, and suggests that he wrote the play 'immediately after'. It is more likely -- given the care and time he usually spent over his work and noting the comment by the historian John Oldmixon in the spring of 1699 that Congreve was 'giving the World a new Comedy' (J. Oldmixon, 'Reflections on the Stage', 1699, 173) -- that he began writing 'The Way of the World' soon after finishing his own 'Amendments of Mr. Collier's False and Imperfect Citations' in 1698, and worked on it for at least eighteen months after that. Despite its modern acclaim, 'The Way of the World' had a mixed reception after its first performance on 5 March 1700. Congreve himself wrote 'that it succeeded on the Stage, was almost beyond my Expectation; for but little of it was prepar'd for that general Taste which seems now to be predominant in the Pallats of our Audience' ('Dedication'). But in Dryden's view 'Congreves New Play has had but moderate success; though it deserves much better' (Dryden to Mrs Steward, 12 March 1700). 'The Way of the World' was Congreve's last major comedy, although he, Vanbrugh, and the poet William Walsh collaborated to translate one act each of a comedy based on Moliere. The result was 'Squire Trelooby', which was performed at the Lincoln's Inn Theatre in 1704, but never published. 
It would be wrong to imagine that Congreve left the stage then for a life of sinecured leisure after Jeremy Collier's envenomed attack on him and the alleged failure of 'The Way of the World' in 1700. Instead he was already moving on to develop his long interest in writing words for music by devoting himself to the musical stage. A significant prelude to this activity was his role in providing the libretto to 'The Judgment of Paris' for the music prize contested in March-June 1701 by John Eccles, Godfrey Finger, Daniel Purcell, and the relatively unknown John Weldon, who was awarded the prize much to everyone's surprise. (A re-enacted competition in the Royal Albert Hall on 13 August 1989 justly gave the first prize to Eccles.) Congreve wrote to his friend Keally on 26 March 1701 describing in detail the first performance in the old Dorset Garden Theatre, with Eccles's music, more than eighty-five performers, and the stage 'all built into a concave with deal boards; all which was to increase and throw forward the sound'. On this occasion the principals were Anne Bracegirdle playing Venus ('performed to a miracle' said Congreve (Hodges, 'Letters', 20-21)), Mary Hodgson as Juno, and Elizabeth Bowman as Pallas. Hodgson was the only professional singer of the three, perhaps an indication of the importance Congreve, like Dryden before him, accorded to actors as singers. In tribute to its eminently settable nature -- the fruits of his ten-year apprenticeship in the art of writing for music -- Congreve's libretto has proved a continuing attraction to other composers, including Johann Wolfgang Franck, Giuseppe Sammartini, and Thomas Arne. 
The depth of Congreve's commitment to the theatre after 1700 is perhaps best seen in his collaboration with Vanbrugh in both planning and writing for the new Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket. Plans must have been formed before June 1703, when Vanbrugh reported to the publisher Jacob Tonson, who acted as secretary to the Kit-Cat Club, that land had been purchased with money raised from twenty-nine benefactors, many of them fellow Kit-Cat Club members; he hoped that the corner-stone might be laid by midsummer day, with business commencing in December. The theatre was to be built to Vanbrugh's design, with a large orchestra, a deep proscenium, and a stage with machinery capable of spectacular scenic effects. There is every reason to believe that the partners hoped to open with an opera worthy of Purcell's precedent ('Dido and Aeneas'), designed to revive and develop a specifically English operatic tradition: Congreve's 'Semele', set to music by John Eccles. 
The foundation stone was laid on 18 April 1704 by the duke of Somerset and the countess of Sunderland, one of the duke of Marlborough's daughters and Henrietta Godolphin's younger sister. In December 1704 Congreve and Vanbrugh were granted Queen Anne's royal licence for a new company (Hodges, 'Letters', 110-11). Vanbrugh's commission to design Blenheim Palace was awarded about the same time, and must have distracted him from the management of the new theatre, perhaps leaving more of that work to Congreve. The first event to take place in the unfinished theatre was a recital by an Italian singer, one 'Segniora Sconiance' before Queen Anne in November 1704 ('Diverting Post', 2 Dec 1704). In the end it was not Congreve's and Eccles's English opera, but Jakob Greber's 'Gli amori d'Ergasto' that formally opened the Queen's Theatre on 9 April 1705. Congreve was obliged to supply the epilogue, and it is a telling one: '
To Sound and Show at first we make pretence, 

In time we may regale you with some Sense, 

But that, at present were too great Expence. 

' Greber's opera was, says John Downes, 'Perform'd by a new set of Singers, Arriv'd from 'Italy'; (the worst that e're came from thence)'. He adds in a revealing sequence, as if such had indeed been the plan, that 'had they Open'd the House at first, with a good new 'English' Opera, or a new Play; they wou'd have preserv'd the Favour of Court and City, and gain'd Reputation and Profit to themselves' (Downes, 48). Congreve wrote to Keally on 15 December 1705 that he had 'quitted the affair of the Hay-market. You may imagine I got nothing by it' (Hodges, 'Letters', 38-9). Soon after, the lease of the Queen's Theatre was taken up by Owen Swiney. 'Semele' evidently was not performed during Congreve's lifetime, although it was reported to be ready for rehearsal in 1707 ('Muses Mercury', 1707, 10-11). It was published with Congreve's 'Collected Works' in 1710, but its first performance was not until 10 February 1744 with a slightly modified libretto and in a new setting by Handel, rather than with Eccles's original score. 
Not surprisingly after all his set-backs, Congreve wrote to Keally on 29 November 1708: 'Ease and quiet is what I hunt after. If I have not ambition, I have other passions more easily gratified' (Hodges, 'Letters', 53). In his disappointment, Congreve, like Ben Jonson before him, turned to his readers and prepared his works for publication: his comedies, his tragedy, his poetry, his masque, and his opera 'Semele'. He had already begun collecting and revising his poetry by January 1707 when the 'Muses Mercury' announced that 'Mr. 'Congreve' is preparing an Edition of all his Miscellany Poems, in one Volume,... with the Addition of several New Pieces.' Their preparation preceded and perhaps suggested the larger collected works. The volume is testimony to Congreve's skill in lyric -- including sung lyric, pastoral, and verse epistle -- and to his ability, in translation and imitation, to make accessible in English a range of classical poets as diverse as Homer, Juvenal, and Ovid. Among them are 'The Mourning Muse of Alexis', a poem written on the death of Queen Mary in 1694 for which he received $100 from the king, and 'The Tears of Amaryllis for Amyntas', on the death of John, marquess of Blandford, in 1703. 
Most of his plays, in quarto format, had been rushed into publication in the 1690s to meet demand, but now Congreve collaborated closely with his publisher Jacob Tonson to ensure that they were presented in their proper scenic form. (Congreve had lodged with Tonson in the mid-1690s, before moving to the house of Frances, 'nee' Bracegirdle, and Edward Porter in Arundel Street and then Surrey Street.) In 1710 'The Works of Mr. William Congreve' was published in three handsome octavo volumes, the plays edited to the neo-classical standard that Congreve had observed in composing them. In 1719-20, when the 'Works' were next reprinted by Tonson, a smaller format was chosen that allowed Congreve to introduce centred speech headings. 
Congreve never entirely stopped writing, although in later life, hampered by poor vision and health, he wrote much less. Swift mentioned to Stella in 1711 that Congreve had written 'The Tatler', no. 292, 'as blind as he is, for little Harrison' (Swift, 'Journal', 13 Feb 1711). Heeding Dryden's request that he 'be kind to his Remains' ('To my dear friend Mr. Congreve', l.73), Congreve provided the elegant and affectionate dedication to Dryden's 'Dramatick Works' in six volumes, published by Tonson in 1717. He managed 'Two Tales', translated into verse from La Fontaine (1720), possibly the prose squib 'The Game of Quadrille' ('c'.1726), the political poem 'A Ballad of Quadrille' (1727), and one of his finest poems, his 'Letter to Cobham' (1728), written not long before his death. 
Congreve did not marry. Instead he formed close alliances, first, with Anne Bracegirdle, for whom he wrote major parts in all his plays, including Angelica in 'Love for Love' and Millamant in 'The Way of the World'. She retired from the stage in 1707, and they remained friends for the rest of Congreve's life: he left her $200 and her sister Frances Porter $50 in his will, written in 1726. Much of the last decades of his life was spent in the sustaining company of Henrietta, Lady Godolphin and (from 1721) second duchess of Marlborough (1681-1733), whom he had probably met by 1703. He had written 'The Tears of Amaryllis' -- dedicated to her father-in-law Lord Godolphin -- on the death of her brother the marquess of Blandford in the same year, and her mother Sarah, first duchess of Marlborough, was by then complaining of the company her daughter was keeping. Congreve left the largest part of his estate to Henrietta, naming her husband as executor, but this was in fact Congreve's discreet provision for his daughter, Mary (1723-1764), born to Henrietta on 23 November 1723. His intention becomes clear when Congreve's will is read with Henrietta's, in which she bequeaths to Mary 'all Mr Congreves Personal Estate that he left me' as well as her 'Fine Brilliant Diamond Neck-lace which cost Five Thousand Three hundred Pounds And also the fine Diamond Ear-Rings with Diamond Drop's to them which cost Two thousand Pounds'. Henrietta was reported to have told Edward Young that these jewels had been purchased with money Congreve had left her; the collets of the necklace may have been engraved with Congreve's initials (Hodges, 'Letters', 268-9). Though not specified in either will, Congreve's library also passed to Mary, who became duchess of Leeds when she married in 1740. The library remained at Hornby Castle in the Leeds family until it was auctioned by Sothebys in June 1930. 
Aside from earning income from his writing, Congreve held various government posts, most of them, according to Thomas Southerne, through the intervention of his patron, Charles Montagu (BL, Add. MS 4221, fol. 341). After the success of 'The Old Batchelor' Congreve was made one of eleven commissioners of the malt lottery on 23 April 1693, for which he seems to have received about $100. From 1695 to 1705 he was one of the commissioners for regulating and licensing hackney coaches, a post worth $100 a year. This was supplemented by his $48 salary as customs collector at Poole from 1700 to 1703. He was one of the commissioners for wine licences ($200 per annum) from 1705 to 1714, and then undersearcher of the London port in 1714, when he deputized one Joshua White, whom he mentioned in his will. Although a spurious letter has Lady Mary Wortley Montagu writing to Pope about Congreve 'enjoying leisure with dignity in two lucrative employments' ('Correspondence of Alexander Pope', 1.423) and Southerne says that the post was worth $620, it was persistently recorded as $12 per annum in Treasury documents (Hodges, 'Congreve, the Man', 98n.). At any rate his civil service pay and perquisites were notably meagre for the first twenty years (Swift wrote that 'Congreve scarce could spare / A shilling to discharge his chair' ('Libel on Dr Delany', 1730, ll. 41-2)), but clearly improved after 1714 when he became secretary of Jamaica, a post that brought in about $700 a year, and was confirmed until his death. It is uncertain how much time and work these jobs involved. Three previous commissioners for hackney coaches had resigned when the stipend was reduced from $200 to $100, which suggests that that post may have been more demanding than a simple sinecure. The office for licensing wine was only a few minutes' walk from where Congreve lived in Surrey Street, and at least one wine licence signed by him is still extant (Hodges, 'Letters', 39n.). On 26 June 1706 Congreve wrote to his friend Keally complaining that business had been 'full of vexation and without any good consequence' (ibid., 42), which might have referred to his civil service work. Although he was officially released from the obligation of residing in Jamaica after he became secretary, his appointment of a controversial deputy, one Samuel Page, certainly meant that he had to involve himself for a time in disputes between Page and the governor of Jamaica, Archibald Hamilton. 
Evidently Congreve enjoyed good health when he was young -- Swift says that he 'had the misfortune to squander away a very good constitution in his younger days' (Swift to Pope, 13 Feb 1729, 'Correspondence of Jonathan Swift', 3.311-12), giving weight to Congreve's claim that he once could 'jump one-and-twenty feet at one jump upon North-hall Common' (Congreve to Keally, 6 May 1712, Hodges, 'Letters', 67) -- but he was afflicted through most of his life by gout and poor eyesight. As early as 1692 Congreve had alluded to his failing vision, and many of his letters refer to his incapacitating fits of gout. Swift wrote to Stella in October 1709 that Congreve 'is almost blind with cataracts growing on his eyes, and his case is, that he must wait two or three years, until the cataracts are riper,... and then he must have them couched; and besides he is never rid of the gout, yet he looks young and fresh, and is as chearful as ever. (Swift to Stella, October 1710, Swift, 'Journal to Stella', 1.69-70)' Richard van Bleeck's portrait of Congreve, dated 1715, shows a man in quiet contemplation, holding a manuscript copy of two plays by his friend Vanbrugh. The downcast eyes suggest both Congreve's modesty and his faulty eyes. In his last poem, written to Lord Cobham less than a year before his death, Congreve describes himself '
retir'd without Regret, 

Forgetting Care, or striving to forget; 

In easy Contemplation soothing Time 

With Morals much, and now and then with Rhime, 

Not so robust in Body, as in Mind, 

And always undejected, tho' declin'd... 
(ll. 71-6)' Late in September 1728 Congreve's coach accidentally overturned. Although it was reported in the 'Daily Post' on 1 October that 'he received no Hurt, having been immediately let Blood', he probably suffered some internal injury, for he complained later of a violent pain in his side. Congreve died at the Porters' house in Surrey Street on Sunday 19 January 1729. Henrietta arranged the funeral for the following Sunday, 26 January, when Congreve's body was interred in Westminster Abbey. The pall was supported there by the duke of Bridgewater, Henrietta's husband the earl of Godolphin, Lord Cobham, Lord Wilmington, the Hon. George Berkeley, and Brigadier-General Churchill, according to contemporary report. Congreve's memorial in the abbey is a medallion carved after a portrait by Kneller, with an epitaph beneath, written by the duchess of Marlborough. 
Congreve's reputation suffered after the publication of Voltaire's 'Letters Concerning the English Nation' in 1733. The young Voltaire, who clearly admired Congreve for raising 'the Glory of Comedy to a greater Height than any English Writer before or since his Time', had paid Congreve a visit in the late 1720s. By then Congreve was ill and nearly blind. Misinterpreting Congreve's modesty and irony in suggesting that his dramatic works were only trifles and that he should be visited 'upon no other foot than that of a Gentleman, who led a Life of Plainness and Simplicity', Voltaire wrote in the same famous letter that he 'was very much disgusted at so unseasonable a Piece of Vanity' (Voltaire, 'Letters Concerning the English Nation', 1733, 188). The English text has continued unaltered to this day, but a more mature Voltaire took the first opportunity to amend his French text. In the Amsterdam edition of 1738-9 he expunged the passages critical of Congreve's character, leaving only unqualified praise of his work. Voltaire's original theme was ignorantly taken up by Samuel Johnson, who began his life of Congreve with the disparaging suggestion that Congreve had lied about his birth in Yorkshire; he went on to recount the Voltaire story, and could find little to praise in Congreve's work. Even so, Johnson believed that one scene in 'The Mourning Bride' (II.i) surpassed 'the whole mass of English poetry', and he expressed grudging admiration for a man who could count among his friends 'every man of his time whom wit and elegance had raised to reputation' (S. Johnson, 'The Lives of the English Poets and a Criticism on their Works', 3 vols., 1779-81). 
Another continental, Luigi Riccoboni, who visited Congreve about the same time as Voltaire, found in him a man of 'Taste joined with great Learning', one who was 'perfectly acquainted with Nature' (Riccoboni, 175). Those who knew Congreve better describe a man of candour, wit, good nature, and compassion. Charles Hopkins, writing in 1697, observed: '
Nor does your Verse alone our Passions move, 

Beyond the Poet, we the person Love. 

In you, and almost only you; we find 

Sublimity of Wit, and Candour of the Mind. 

' Pope dedicated his translation of the 'Iliad' to Congreve 'as a memorial of our friendship occasioned by his translation of this last part of Homer' (Pope to James Craggs, 1 Oct 1719, 'Correspondence of Alexander Pope'). Swift wrote to Pope of 'our dear friend Mr. Congreve, whom I loved from my youth, and who surely, beside his other talents, was a very agreeable companion' (13 Feb 1729, 'Correspondence of Jonathan Swift', 3.311). Sir Richard Temple built a monument to Congreve at Stowe to commemorate both the poet's 'elegant, polished Wit' and the friend's 'candid, most unaffected Manners'. Indeed in the very first sentence he ever published -- the opening lines of Cleophil's address to Katherine Leveson in 'Incognita' -- Congreve announced the values by which, implicitly, he would both write and live: 'A Clear Wit, sound Judgement and a Merciful Disposition'. 

'The Way of the World' has often been considered the culmination of Restoration comedy. Along with Wycherley and Etherege, Congreve is almost universally regarded as one of the three pre-eminent writers of comedy of his time. As 'The London Stage' and E. L. Avery's 'Congreve's Plays on the Eighteenth-Century Stage' (1951) amply prove, Congreve's plays had a long and distinguished history through the eighteenth century, and by no means vanished with the alleged triumph of 'sentimental comedy'.

Congreve, Sir William, second baronet (1772-1828), rocket designer, was born on 20 May 1772, perhaps at Homerton, Hackney, Middlesex (where he was baptized), the eldest son of Captain-Lieutenant (later Lieutenant-General Sir) William Congreve, first baronet (1743-1814), Royal Artillery, and his first wife, Rebecca, daughter of Fleet Elmstone RN. The younger William attended Newcome's school, Hackney, a fashionable private school for the sons of noblemen and gentlemen, where Thomas Creevey was his fellow pupil; Wolverhampton grammar school; the Revd John Tucker's 'seminary for young gentlemen' at Hever Court, Singlewell, near Gravesend, Kent; and Trinity College, Cambridge. Admitted to Trinity College in 1788, he matriculated in 1789 and was a scholar in 1792. He read mathematics and at the 1793 tripos was placed among the junior optimes; he graduated BA in 1793 and MA in 1796. He may also have attended the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and, possibly, in the early 1790s, Gray's Inn, London. 
Little is known of Congreve's early career. In 1803 he was a volunteer in the London and Westminster light horse, and was a London businessman who published a polemical newspaper, the 'Royal Standard and Political Register', which was tory, pro-government, and anti-Cobbett. Following George Cranfield Berkeley's successful libel action against it in 1804, Congreve seems to have withdrawn from publishing and applied himself to inventing. During the threat of French invasion, as a member of the Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture, he proposed in 1804 an oar-powered, iron-armoured floating battery; but it was never constructed. He also proposed a large flotilla of mortar boats to destroy the Boulogne invasion flotilla and attack enemy ports. 
About this time there were experiments with war rockets in several countries, notably France and Ireland. Congreve always denied that he had invented war rockets, attributing their origin to Mughal antiquity. Influenced by their use against the British in India and by the unsuccessful experiments at Woolwich of Lieutenant-General Thomas Desaguiliers (chief firemaster from 1748 to 1780), and backed by his father, who was comptroller of the royal laboratory at Woolwich from 1789 to 1814, Congreve in 1804, at his own expense, began experimenting with rockets at Woolwich. He developed rockets of different calibres and warheads. Through his father he gained official backing, and his rockets were manufactured at the Royal Arsenal there. In September 1805, at the Woolwich marshes, he demonstrated his rockets to William Pitt, the prime minister, and other ministers. 
Congreve's father knew the prince of Wales (later the prince regent and George IV) and the duke of York and was liked by them. Congreve had approached the prince, who became his friend and patron, and a keen partisan of his rockets. Thomas Creevey wrote that 'Congreve... took to inventing rocketts for the more effectual destruction of mankind, for which he became patronised by the Prince of Wales' ('Creevey Papers', 1905, 147), and Earl Grey privately alleged that 'the rockets were to be the great instruments of security in the new park against the mob' (Brougham, 2.59). Congreve's claim, in his dedication to George IV in his 'Treatise on the... Congreve Rocket System' (1827), that 'the Rocket System not only owes its existence but its present state of perfection to the patronage of His Majesty' was more than a courtier's sycophancy: royal favour was crucial to his career. 
Congreve's rockets were rushed into production at Woolwich. His role was essentially in their development and manufacture, though in the early years of their production he sometimes directed their use in combat. They were first used in Sir Sidney Smith's naval attack on Boulogne in November 1805, which Congreve accompanied. With bad weather, the attack failed, and this was followed in Britain by much criticism of rockets. In 1806 Congreve replaced paper-cased by iron-cased rockets. The latter were used, directed by Congreve, in Captain E. R. Owen's attack on Boulogne in October 1806 and were considered by the British to be successful, though apparently with insufficient evidence of the damage inflicted. In September 1807 Congreve directed the successful rocket bombardment of Copenhagen. Rockets were also used elsewhere. Although the duke of Wellington continued to be unimpressed -- in November 1810 he wrote that he was 'no partisan of Congreve's rockets' ('Dispatches', 6.591) -- they were used in the Peninsular War. In March 1811 Congreve was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. 
Also in 1811 Congreve, who apparently never held a British regular commission, was commissioned lieutenant-colonel in the Hanoverian artillery -- an honorary rank; later he was promoted to major-general. His Hanoverian rank was resented by Royal Artillery officers, who did not consider him a professional soldier. In February 1811 he was appointed an equerry to the prince of Wales, on whose accession in 1820 he became equerry to the king. In September 1812 he visited Liverpool to become a parliamentary candidate -- his opponent Henry Brougham wrote that 'Congreve, the rocket-man, stands on the Prince's interest!' (Brougham, 2.57) -- but withdrew for lack of support. In October, through the prince regent's influence, Congreve was elected -- in fact appointed by the proprietor, the nabob Sir Mark Wood -- an MP for the notorious pocket borough of Gatton in Surrey. As MP he supported the tory government, opposed Roman Catholic relief, and spoke little; in 1816 he vacated the seat in favour of Wood's son. In December 1812 his father was made a baronet. 
In October 1813 the Royal Horse Artillery 'rocket brigade' (commanded by Captain Richard Bogue) fought with notable success at the battle of Leipzig -- the only British troops present. Following this, Tsar Alexander I of Russia awarded Congreve the knighthood of the order of St Anne, and belatedly in 1821 Charles XIV of Sweden awarded him the order of the Sword. Congreve claimed that he had been offered, but declined, command of the rocket corps 'with rank in the Regiment of Artillery' (Congreve, 'Details of the Rocket System', 9). Rockets were successfully employed in the Anglo-American War of 1812-14. In 1814 Congreve joined Wellington's army in southern France. The use of rockets continued to be controversial, criticized by some officers and by writers in the press: in July 1814 the 'Morning Chronicle' denounced their manufacture as 'tomfoolery'. However, Congreve and his supporters continued to extol their achievements and potential. 
In April 1814 Congreve succeeded his father as baronet, afterwards taking over his father's official appointments, which he held almost until his own death in 1828. He was the only head of the royal laboratory in the nineteenth century who was not a Royal Artillery officer. In 1821 he was paid $360 (with housing) as comptroller of the royal laboratory and $101 5's'. as superintendent of the royal military repository. He organized the impressive firework displays in London for the peace of 1814 and for the coronation of George IV in 1821. In 1816 he accompanied Grand Duke Nicholas (later Tsar Nicholas I) on his tour of England, and in that year, according to W. A. Shaw's 'Knights of England', was made a KCH. 
Congreve continued to experiment with rockets. In 1815 he made his most important change to their configuration, moving the guidestick from the side to the centre, so increasing accuracy. He experimented to produce a stickless, spinning rocket, but never satisfactorily solved the problem. He had developed not just war rockets but a weapon system, which he called 'the Congreve Rocket System', and claimed that the rocket was 'ammunition without ordnance... the soul of artillery without the body' (Hogg, 1.520). Rockets were envisaged as not merely supplementing, but superseding, conventional artillery, and as having immense potential for future war. He claimed that the rocket was 'an arm by which the whole system of military tactics is destined to be changed' ('Treatise', 42). 
Self-important and an avid publicist for himself and his rockets, Congreve repeatedly asserted -- notably in 'The Details of the Rocket System' (1814) and 'A Treatise on the... Congreve Rocket System, as Compared with Artillery' (1827) -- the advantages of rockets over conventional artillery: these included recoillessness, lightness and portability, volume and rate of fire, moral effect, and economy, with an 'immense saving' over artillery. He asserted the rockets' 'most important property of universal application' ('Treatise', 38) and, in the longer term, did not want specialized army rocket units, except for the heaviest rockets, but rather the extensive use of rockets by cavalry and infantry. He advocated massed rocket bombardment: 'in all cases, I lay the greatest stress upon the use of this arm in 'great quantities'' (ibid., 78). He envisaged rockets of half a ton to a ton, for bombarding fortifications, and advocated naval use of rockets, supplementing but not replacing conventional ordnance, particularly for coastal bombardment and on steam vessels: 'the late introduction of steam navigation opens a new field for naval warfare -- by its combination with heavy rockets' (ibid., 21). 
Congreve designed naval gun-mountings which were on sale to merchant vessels, but apparently not much used. He designed a lighter 24-pounder which the navy adopted and used to upgun vessels to counter the heavily armed United States warships, and a gunsight which also was adopted by the navy. In 1828 he proposed a steam-powered, iron-armoured floating battery for, if required, forcing the Dardanelles; the controller of the navy rejected it as impracticable. 
In 1818, through the prince regent, who had an apparently strong electoral influence in Plymouth, and backed by the government, which had Admiralty influence there, Congreve, a 'Carlton House man', was elected an MP for Plymouth; he continued such until his death. His father had begun the royal military repository, the artillery museum collection at Woolwich. Congreve improved it and, through the prince regent, secured the erection in 1820 of John Nash's Rotunda, which still houses the Museum of Artillery and contains the best collection of Congreve rocketry. 
Congreve lived with a mistress (formerly Creevey's) and had at least two illegitimate sons. In December 1824 he married, at Wessel, Prussia, Isabella Carvalho (or Charlotte), a young woman of Portuguese descent and widow of Henry Nisbett McEnvoy. They had two sons and a daughter. 
Called by the press the 'ingenious Mr. Congreve' (Winter, 28), he made various inventions -- including an improved process of gunpowder manufacture, a hydropneumatic canal lock and sluice, a colour-printing process, a rolling-ball clock, and a 'perpetual motion machine' -- and took out at least eighteen patents. When Drury Lane Theatre in London was rebuilt after a fire in 1809, he designed its anti-fire water system. He also invented a rocket-propelled whaling harpoon, which was a commercial failure. From about 1822, following Henry Trengrouse's initiative, he experimented in adapting his war rockets to ship-to-shore lifesaving rockets, but gave this low priority and died before he could perfect the system. Others developed lifesaving rockets much more successfully, and in the nineteenth century rockets apparently saved more lives than they destroyed. Among his varied publications were 'A Concise Account of the Origin and Progress of the Rocket System' (1807) and works on cash payments and currency. 
In addition to his official appointments, Congreve had his own private rocket factory at West Ham, London, and he supplied the East India Company. In later years he was prominent in various industrial ventures, such as gas companies, which were mostly unsuccessful. He was chairman of the Equitable Loan Bank, and director of the Arigna Iron and Coal Company, the Palladium Insurance Company, and the Peruvian Mining Company. As a director of the Arigna company he was apparently involved in fraud; in 1826 the case went to court, with Congreve among those accused. Ill, he went to the south of France, beyond British jurisdiction. The case dragged on and not until May 1828, shortly before Congreve's death, did the lord chancellor rule that the transaction concerned was 'clearly fraudulent' and was intended to profit Congreve and others. Congreve suffered from a 'palsy of the limbs' and became paralysed in the lower part of his body. He stayed in a private hotel at 24 place Ste Scarbes, Toulouse, and died on 15 May 1828. The following day he was buried, with military honours, in the protestant and Jewish cemetery of Terre Cabade, Toulouse. In April 1835 his widow married Charles Fenton Whiting; she died on 5 November 1872. Congreve was succeeded as baronet by his son, William Augustus Congreve ('b'. 1827), who was last heard of in Sydney, Australia, in 1860 when he intended going to the Fiji islands; in 1882 he was legally presumed dead. Following his death the baronetcy became extinct. 
Congreve rockets, though erratic and inaccurate, were used by British forces in numerous campaigns, and similar rockets were adopted by other states. In Britain Congreve rockets were declared obsolete in 1866, but Hale rockets, derived from them -- though overtaken and marginalized by artillery development -- were used in colonial campaigns to the end of the century. Congreve had 'created the world's first rocket weapons system' and 'initiated the modern process of research and development in rocketry' (Winter, xiii-xiv).

Coningham, James (1669/70-1716), Presbyterian minister and tutor, of unknown parents, was described as 'Anglus' when he graduated MA from Edinburgh University on 27 February 1694. His first ministry was at Penrith, Cumberland, at a new Presbyterian meeting established as a result of a lectureship supported by Dr Thomas Gibson of Hatton Garden, London. Subsequently, the Congregational Fund Board made a grant of $5. He was ordained in August 1694 as a licentiate of the Church of Scotland. While at Penrith he began to prepare students for the nonconformist ministry. He married Agnes Cookson ('bap'. 1671), daughter of William and Alice Cookson, at St Andrew's, Penrith, on 30 July 1694. There is evidence that locally he became a figure of some note. In 1696 he rode to London 'in a monstrous large cloth hat' to present the 'Cumberland Association' to King William (J. Coningham to R. Thoresby, 14 Sept 1699, Thoresby MSS), and he was involved in promoting the reformation of manners. He corresponded with the Leeds antiquarian Ralph Thoresby concerning natural curiosities, making a number of donations to Thoresby's museum. He is said to have been the author of 'A critical essay on modern medals, with some reflections on the taste and judgment of the ancients' (1704). 
In May 1699 Richard Stretton suggested Coningham as a suitable successor to Timothy Manlove as minister of the Mill Hill Chapel at Leeds, but in 1700 Coningham accepted the call to Cross Street, Manchester, as co-pastor with John Chorlton and to assist in the academy there. Little is known about what was taught, but the surviving manuscript notes of one student, John Turner (1689-1737), in his 'Bible' provide evidence for the study of Semitics. Coningham was said to be 'admirably well fitted for the Work... his Learning was very considerable' (Wright, 23). His most celebrated student was Samuel Bourn the younger. After Chorlton's death in August 1705, unsuccessful attempts by his congregation were made to obtain Samuel Benyon, tutor and minister at Broad Oak. Coningham's situation became increasingly uncomfortable. He was prosecuted for conducting an academy without a licence, and experienced much hostility locally as a dissenter. It was, however, the doctrinal divisions within his own congregation which persuaded him to accept the call to London from the congregation at Haberdasher Hall following the death in 1712 of their minister, Richard Stretton. There his ministry was much more comfortable, but his health was broken and he died on 1 September 1716 in his forty-seventh year. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, London.

Coningsburgh, Edmund (d. 1479x81), archbishop of Armagh, was apparently English in origin, though nothing certain is known of his background. He attended the University of Cambridge, where he had taken the degree of bachelor of canon law by 1448. He also attended an unidentified foreign university and became doctor of canon law by 1469. He became rector of St Leonard, Foster Lane, London (12 January 1448), vicar of South Weald, Essex (13 October 1450), and rector of Copford, also in Essex (3 November 1451), receiving a papal dispensation to hold an additional incompatible benefice on 26 July 1452. 
In 1455, and frequently afterwards, Coningsburgh was employed in university business at Cambridge. He was one of the syndics for building the philosophical and law schools in 1457. It appears that he was a proctor in the court of the bishop of Ely. He may have been originally a member of Corpus Christi College; certainly he occupied chambers there from 1468 to 1473. In 1469 he and Walter Buck, master of arts, had a joint commission from Bishop William Grey of Ely to visit Rome as that prelate's proxies. During that year he is recorded as warden of the English hospice of St Thomas in Rome. He became rector of St James, Colchester, on 1 January 1470. On 10 August 1471 Edward IV addressed a letter of congratulation on his election to Pope Sixtus IV, and sent his councillor, James Goldwell, bishop of Norwich, and Coningsburgh to Rome as envoys. In 1471-2 Coningsburgh was vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge. 
On 5 June 1475 Coningsburgh was appointed archbishop of Armagh by papal provision and was consecrated in Rome by English bishops in early 1477. However, his predecessors had left the archdiocese of Armagh in debt to Italian bankers for 1100 florins, and the pope was concerned that this debt should be cleared. As a result, Coningsburgh was forced to leave his bulls of provision in the hands of the bankers as surety for his promise to repay the loan in two instalments over three years. The pope also, on 13 June 1477, appointed Octavian del Palaccio, a Florentine priest and doctor of canon law, as papal nuncio and governor of the archdiocese in matters both spiritual and temporal, until Coningsburgh had paid off the debt. 
However, Coningsburgh and Alfred Cornburgh, an esquire of the body to Edward IV, were given a commission from the king on 21 June 1477 to hear and determine all controversies, suits, and debates depending between any of the great men or peers of Ireland; and on 3 July Coningsburgh had the temporalities of the see, then in the king's hands, restored to him, along with permission to recover any other property of the archdiocese which might have been lost. Edward was at this time attempting to re-establish control over Ireland after his estrangement from his brother the duke of Clarence, lieutenant of Ireland since 1472. Royal influence outside the pale was virtually non-existent and Coningsburgh's arrival at Dundalk in August 1477, armed with these powers, seems to have been a major plank in Edward's strategy. 
However, when Coningsburgh met with the dean and chapter of Armagh there on 5 September 1477, they demanded to see his bulls of provision. Since he was unable to produce them, they refused to grant him permission to exercise his office, citing canon law, and instead he took up residence in Drogheda. By late September Octavian had arrived and presented his papal rescript, which was accepted by the dean and chapter. 
On 10 November Octavian and Coningsburgh met, and Coningsburgh, unable to maintain his position, resigned as archbishop, appointing the nuncio as proctor and commissary in return for an annual pension of 50 marks. He returned to England, where he became a suffragan of the bishop of Ely, but he and the king were not content, and on 2 May 1478 Edward renewed the grant of temporalities to Coningsburgh. Nothing resulted from this, however, and Octavian was consecrated as archbishop of Armagh at some point between 30 September 1479 and 31 January 1480. Nothing more is known of Coningsburgh, save for the payment of $1 to the University of Cambridge in respect of a debt of $2, in 1481 by his executors. Claims that he was a suffragan of the bishop of Norwich in 1502 are unsupported, and the likelihood is that he died between 1479 and 1481. 
Coningsburgh was the last of a succession of Englishmen appointed to the see of Armagh by the king, the previous two of whom had been responsible for the debt that dominated his short tenure there. Owing to this situation, Coningsburgh was unable to make any impact on the problems of the province of Armagh, and it remained for Octavian to pay off the debts and improve the condition of the diocese over the next few years. Perhaps the most significant aspect of this short interlude is that it was the pope's concerns and wishes that prevailed over those of Edward IV.

Coningsby, Sir Harry (fl. 1633-1665), translator, was the son of Sir Thomas Coningsby of North Mimms, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Martha (died 1677), daughter of William Button of Alton, Wiltshire. He was admitted to Middle Temple in February 1633. The family was descended from Sir Humphrey Coningsby, a judge under Henry VIII. This lineage made the vicissitudes the family endured during the civil war, as a result of their loyalty to the crown, even harder to bear. Sir Thomas had been high sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1638 and 1642. Having been arrested at St Albans early in 1643 while endeavouring to execute a commission of array for Charles I, Sir Thomas was imprisoned by Cromwell and had to pay so substantial a fine that the family were financially crippled. In 1658 the decision was taken to sell the North Mimms estate, which Sir Thomas had settled on Martha and her son on 13 February 1640, on the occasion of Harry's marriage to Hester, daughter of James Cambell, an alderman of London. Harry and his mother retired to their other estate of Weild or Wold Hall, Shenley, Hertfordshire. 
Although Harry was knighted in 1662, the trauma of the decline in family fortunes remained with him, and it was doubtless for this reason that he decided to publish privately his own translation of Boethius, as 'The Consolation of Philosophy: a Metrical Translation by Harry Coningsby' (1664). In a manuscript letter, dated 30 March 1665, in the British Museum copy of this rare work, Coningsby addresses the son of the new owner of North Mimms, Sir Thomas Hide, and asks him to accept a copy of the translation so that some part of the family may remain in the house. His decision to translate this work by Boethius parallels his father's translation into English of Justus Lipsius's 'Discourse on constancy', no doubt undertaken in response to seven years of imprisonment in the Tower of London. His decision to include with his translation a short essay on his father's unhappy career demonstrates that this was the chief impetus for Sir Harry's work: to understand 'for what cause it was the storm came upon him and ruined him' (Corser, 430). Sir Harry's only son died young. Each of his three daughters married: the eldest, Genevieva, married Thomas Aram of Gray's Inn, London. The second, Marth-Agnes, married Sir William Hickes of Ruckholt, Essex, while the youngest, Theophania, married Edward Bushes of Rocks Bushes in 1670.

Coningsby, Sir Humphrey (d. 1535), judge, was born about the end of Henry VI's reign at Rock, Worcestershire, the son of Thomas Coningsby (died 1498) and Katherine Waldyff. The family derived its name from Coningsby in Lincolnshire, though Thomas's father had settled at Neen Sollars in Shropshire. Humphrey Coningsby began practice as an attorney of the common pleas, and is named in warrants of attorney in 1474; in 1476 he was deputy for the sheriff of Worcestershire. From 1480 to 1493 he was third prothonotary, surrendering the office on 24 November 1493 in favour of John Caryll on terms that Caryll would pass it on to Humphrey's son (which he did). He was also clerk of assize on the western circuit. During the 1480s he became a bencher of the Inner Temple. There was a copy of his reading in Lord Somers's library, but it has not been discovered. He may already have been nominated as a serjeant when he gave up the prothonotaryship. At any rate he was one of the nine graduands who, after a long delay, were created serjeant in November 1495. His clients included Queen Elizabeth, the duke of Buckingham, and Peterborough Abbey. In 1500 he became one of the king's serjeants, and on 21 May 1509 the first justice of the king's bench appointed by Henry VIII. He was knighted by 1509. There survives in Westminster Abbey 'A remembrans made by Humfrey Conyngesby for the kynges matters at Yorke', written as an assize judge in preparation for the Lent circuit of 1501. By 1532 he had apparently become incapable of sitting, and an attempt seems to have been made to replace him without discontinuing his salary. However, the salary was discontinued and Walter Luke formally appointed in his place on 28 November 1533, Coningsby being compensated with a lease of the manor of Rock. 
Coningsby was a justice of the peace for Hertfordshire from 1493, and was perhaps already of Aldenham, where he acquired Penne's Place as executor of Ralph Penne (died 1485), a relative of his first wife, Isabel Fereby. Isabel died in the 1490s and was buried in the Whitefriars next to the Temple. In 1513 he was to found a chantry chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St George at Copthorne Hill in Aldenham. About 1499 he married Alice, daughter and heir of Sir John Franceys, widow of John Worsley and William Staveley (died 1498); she died in 1500. As his third wife, Coningsby in 1504 married Anne, daughter and heir of Sir Christopher Moresby of Cumberland, widow of James Pickering (died 1498); she died in 1523. Coningsby had come into his patrimony at Rock by 1509 at the latest, and probably by 1504, when he was added to the commission of the peace for Worcestershire. In 1510 he built the south aisle and steeple of Rock church, where a painted window once portrayed him in a scarlet gown with his family; and in 1513 he founded Rock School. 
Coningsby died on 2 June 1535, having requested burial in the Whitefriars, Rock, or Aldenham, depending on the place of his death. He left two surviving sons, both by his first marriage, and five daughters (Elizabeth, Amphelice, Margaret, Jane, and Elizabeth). From his eldest son, Thomas, who predeceased him, was descended the Earl Coningsby (the peerage, created in 1719, was extinct in 1729). His second son, William Coningsby, followed in his footsteps as a bencher of the Inner Temple, prothonotary of the common pleas, and justice of the king's bench. His daughter Elizabeth married Sir John Fitzjames, chief justice of the same court.

Coningsby, Sir Thomas (1550-1625), soldier, was born on 9 October 1550, the second son of Humphrey Coningsby (1516-1559) of Hampton Court, Herefordshire, and Anne Englefield. His father's death was quickly followed in 1561 by that of his elder brother, Edward, leaving Thomas heir to substantial estates in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Through his mother he was connected to the Englefield family of Berkshire, whose landed wealth and tradition of royal service (especially in the law) mirrored that of the Coningsby family. Nothing is known of Thomas's childhood or education, although he may have followed his late brother into wardship under Sir Edward Rogers (died 1568), comptroller of the household to Elizabeth I. 
Coningsby was probably already associated with the earl of Leicester by the time he began to cut a figure at court in 1571: he and his sister and brother-in-law were linked in a property transaction with John Hubaud, a Herefordshire neighbour and one of Leicester's most important servants, in 1564. Coningsby was granted a licence to travel abroad for three years in 1572 and subsequently accompanied Leicester's nephew, Philip Sidney, in Vienna and northern Italy in 1573-4. He married Sidney's first cousin, Philippa Fitzwilliam (died 'c'.1617), probably after his return to England. By 1577 Coningsby was resident in Herefordshire and anxious to establish his influence over county affairs. In that year he provoked a dispute with the agents of Robert, earl of Essex, then still a minor. He soon became a deputy lieutenant and began to clash with the leading figure in the county, Sir James Croft, comptroller to the queen. The rivalry between Croft's supporters and those of Coningsby became increasingly bitter and violent during the 1580s, resulting in affrays, threats, lawsuits, and sharp competition for local offices. Coningsby received high-level support in his challenge to Croft from Leicester, who had turned against the comptroller in the 1570s. 
After Leicester's death in 1588, Coningsby found a new patron in the earl of Essex, Leicester's stepson. Essex's support may explain how Coningsby became a gentleman pensioner extraordinary in 1589. Croft's death in 1590 allowed Coningsby to engineer Essex's election as steward of Hereford and Leominster, where Essex employed him as his deputy. Essex's political clout stifled local opposition to Coningsby and his friends for a decade. In 1591 Coningsby joined Essex's expedition to Normandy, serving as commissary of musters. During this campaign he kept a daily journal of events between 13-14 August and 24 December. At least two incomplete copies of this journal survive. On 8 October 1591 Coningsby was one of twenty-four new knights made by Essex 'upon a fair green in the sight of' Rouen (Coningsby, 27). He was paid as muster-master until 15 March 1592. Either upon his return or shortly before he left for France, he became a gentleman pensioner in ordinary. On 27 September 1592, as part of the celebrations for Elizabeth's visit to the university, Coningsby was created master of arts at Oxford, along with many other friends of Essex. 
In 1593 and 1597 Coningsby was elected to parliament as senior knight of the shire for Herefordshire, an honour previously monopolized by Croft. However, the grip on the county of Coningsby and his friends was never complete and was exposed to challenge by Essex's fall in February 1601. Although he managed to succeed Essex as steward of Leominster, Coningsby failed to find a powerful new patron at court. Despite going to extraordinary and illegal lengths, he and his allies could not prevent Sir John Scudamore from becoming steward of Hereford. Coningsby himself barely retained his status as senior knight in a bruising parliamentary election later in 1601. With the accession of James I he resigned as a gentleman pensioner and turned to his relative Sir Robert Sidney, whose office as chamberlain to Queen Anne allowed him to force an unwilling Sir Herbert Croft to share the office of receiver for the queen's lands in Herefordshire with Coningsby in 1604. Although he was appointed to the council in the marches of Wales in 1617 (fully thirty-five years after Philip Sidney first raised the prospect) and doggedly asserted his rights at Leominster, Coningsby largely conceded dominance in county affairs to the Croft-Scudamore interest during the Jacobean period. 
Coningsby's health was often poor and his thoughts apparently turned to ensuring the survival of his family line. Only one of his many sons, Fitzwilliam, born in the late 1590s, survived to adulthood. Three daughters married into allied Herefordshire families, a fourth remained unmarried at her father's death and a fifth, Sidney, was 'defective'. 
In 1614 Sir Thomas established Coningsby's Hospital for old soldiers and serving-men on the remains of the old Blackfriars in Hereford. The leader of these servitors was 'to be called Corporal Coningsby, and by no other surname' (Price, 219-20). Sir Thomas's Calvinist faith is illustrated by his regulations for the hospital of July 1617, which stipulated that the chaplain must be a preacher, and that the company of inmates must march to the cathedral in file behind the chaplain carrying the 'Bible'. Coningsby wrote his extraordinary and bombastic will in 1616, revising it several times before his death at his home at Hampton Court, Herefordshire, on 30 May 1625. The will and first codicil of September 1617 emphasize his utter rejection of vain ceremonies and his confidence in his own resurrection. He was buried next to his wife at Hope church, Herefordshire.

Coningsby, Thomas, first earl of Coningsby (1657-1729), politician, was born on 2 November 1657, the only son of Humphrey Coningsby (died 1671), of Hampton Court, Herefordshire, and his wife, Letitia, daughter of Sir Arthur Loftus of Rathfarnham Castle, co. Dublin. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1671; his call to the Irish bar on 5 May 1691 suggests that he was called to the English bar previously, but there is no record of the event. In 1675 (licence, 18 February 1675) he married Barbara ('c'.1658-1697), daughter of Ferdinando Gorges of Eye Manor, Herefordshire, and Barbados, 'a notorious slaver' (Ferris). The marriage was arranged without the consent of his mother, and while it did not end in divorce as often asserted, it was a tempestuous union, although this did not prevent the couple from having three sons and four daughters. 
In October 1679 Coningsby entered the House of Commons as member for Leominster, Herefordshire, which he represented continuously until the election of 1710. Although his family had been royalists during the civil war Coningsby's father-in-law was a cousin of Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, and Coningsby became a supporter of Shaftesbury and of the exclusion of James, duke of York, from the succession to the throne. He was returned again in the 1681 parliament where he was named to ten committees including one charged with preparing an address on exclusion. His political alliance with his neighbour John Scudamore, second Viscount Scudamore, was threatened when Scudamore learned of an affair between Coningsby and Frances ('nee' Cecil), Lady Scudamore (died 1694). The couple eloped, but were confronted by Scudamore's men who forced Lady Scudamore's return to her husband at pistol point. Coningsby sat for Leominster again in 1685, despite being advised not to do so without the support of Henry Somerset, first duke of Beaufort, a leading tory. During the 1685 parliament he was believed to have taken part in the debate on the army that followed the suppression of Monmouth's rising, but the speech against standing armies credited to him by Anchitell Grey may have been made by another member, Thomas Christie. He was an active member of the convention in 1689; in March, during the debate on the coronation oath, he proposed that William III and Mary II should swear to uphold 'the Doctrine of the Protestant Religion established by Law' (Grey, 9.193), which wording was adopted by parliament. Later in 1689 he spoke in the debate which held John Shales, supply officer, responsible for the failure of the duke of Schomberg's Irish campaign on the grounds that he had mismanaged the transport of troops and equipment. 
Coningsby's wholehearted support of William's administration helped recommend him for office; his kinship to Henry Sidney, Viscount Sydney, one of William's closest advisers, was no doubt also important. In June 1690 Coningsby was appointed joint paymaster-general of the army which William was about to take to Ireland. His colleague was Charles Fox, son of Sir Stephen Fox; Fox managed business in London while Coningsby looked after requirements in the field. He accompanied the army to Ireland, and was by the king's side on 30 June 1690, the eve of the battle of the Boyne, when Jacobite gunners wounded William in the shoulder. Coningsby staunched the wound with his handkerchief, and so won William's personal gratitude. Following William's failure to take Limerick, and before the king returned to England from Waterford, on 2 September 1690 Coningsby was appointed a lord justice of Ireland, in charge of the civil government of Ireland, including the management of the militia, pending the appointment of a lord lieutenant or a lord deputy. The appointment was controversial as according to Gilbert Burnet Coningsby already had a reputation as 'a vicious man' whose 'parts were very indifferent' (Simms, 'Jacobite Ireland', 189). Immediately afterwards Coningsby and his fellow lord justice, Viscount Sydney, left Waterford for the army headquarters at Cullen, near Tipperary, where they discussed future plans with the army's commander, Count Hendrik Trajectinus van Solms-Braunfels, and his successor, Godard van Reede-Ginckel. They then travelled north to Dublin where, on 15 September 1690, they were sworn in as lords justices. On 27 September they wrote to Hans Willem Bentinck, earl of Portland, in London, to advise him on the management of the Commons, suggesting that he rely on a broad coalition of non-Jacobite parties. Both Coningsby and Sydney probably sought to ensure that they were remembered in English politics, but it was the senior partner, Sydney, who was recalled to London in December to become a secretary of state. 
For ten days Coningsby had sole charge of the government of Ireland, but on 23 December he was joined as lord justice by Sir Charles Porter, lord chancellor of Ireland, who had briefly held office under James II. They governed Ireland together until August 1692; Porter's role may have been to moderate Coningsby's hostility towards the Irish and Catholics, and encourage a form of compromise, while Coningsby, a member of the Irish protestant Loftus family on his mother's side, represented the protestant interest. For the first half of their tenure their task was to assist Ginckel in ridding Ireland of the Jacobite army which had been raised by James II's lord lieutenant, Richard Talbot, duke of Tyrconnell. While Ginckel won a series of victories Coningsby concentrated on the political offensive, advertising the generous terms offered by William and Mary to Catholics while attempting to avoid alienating protestant support. Following the capture of Galway on 21 July 1691 Coningsby joined Ginckel at Nenagh, where for nearly a fortnight they discussed the terms to be agreed with the Jacobites when they surrendered Limerick. After the cessation of hostilities at Limerick, on 1 October 1691, Coningsby and Porter joined Ginckel outside the city. There Coningsby and Ginckel's secretary, George Clarke, worked late into the night on the proposed settlement. They rejected the 'long scroll' of suggested terms, drawn up by Jacobite bishops and lawyers, which would have granted Irish Catholics political and religious liberty and restored landholdings to the settlement of Charles II's reign, and completed a draft of the military and civil articles. The military articles offered the Jacobite army the opportunity to leave for service under Louis XIV, the freedom to return to their homes and live peaceably under William, or to fight for William's army. The civil articles were controversial as a clause seen and agreed to by the Irish, offering protection to all those defended by the Irish army in the counties of Limerick, Cork, Clare, Kerry, and Mayo, was omitted in the version transmitted to the English government. Clarke's copy of the draft shows that the clause existed before Coningsby's arrival; Coningsby claimed that he and Clarke had removed the clause, and although his case was supported by the English privy council the clause was approved and applied by the Irish parliament. The treaty of Limerick divided the protestant community: when Coningsby and Porter returned to Dublin they heard on successive Sundays sermons from Anthony Dopping, bishop of Meath, condemning the treaty, and from William Moreton, bishop of Kildare, endorsing it. 
Encouraged by the government in London, and in particular by Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham, secretary of state, Coningsby and Porter set about restoring the connived toleration of Catholics and dissenters that had existed under Charles II, while preserving the broad hegemony of Church of Ireland protestantism. Their policy was set forward in a proclamation by Mary II, but was frustrated by the opposition of dominant figures in the Irish ecclesiastical establishment. These included Bishop Dopping, Robert Fitzgerald, and Sir Francis Brewster, who were helped by their country whig allies in the English parliament at Westminster, led by Goodwin Wharton, who by the English 'Irish Oaths Act' of 1691 restricted all places in the government of Ireland to Anglicans. 
In January 1692 Coningsby and Porter began to restore estates to those who came under the provisions of the treaty of Limerick. This was one of the most successful and conciliatory aspects of Williamite policy in Ireland, leading to about 1200 successful claims by 1699, principally from Catholics. In February 1692 Coningsby learned that Sydney was returning to Ireland as lord lieutenant, and in March was told by Sydney that he was to be made an Irish peer with responsibility for the management of the Lords in the coming parliament. On 5 March King William signed the warrant for Coningsby's Irish peerage and also one appointing him an Irish privy councillor once he ceased to be a lord justice. 
Sydney's parliament met in Chichester House, Dublin, on 5 October 1692, and the same day Coningsby took his seat as Baron Coningsby of Clanbrassil, co. Armagh. Between then and the prorogation of parliament on 3 November Coningsby was active in the Irish Lords, where he chaired the grand committee on new means of raising revenue, and was one of only two peers to attend every sitting of the house. It was rumoured that Sydney prorogued the parliament lest Coningsby might be impeached by critics of the treaty of Limerick. Immediately after the prorogation he was sent to London by Sydney to report on proceedings in parliament, but Lady Coningsby remained in Dublin until after 11 March 1693. 
In London Coningsby resumed his place as member for Leominster in the House of Commons at Westminster, where he was soon called on to vindicate the actions of the Irish administration. The army in Ireland had been accused of extorting money from property owners. Coningsby admitted that there were 'great misdemeanours committed by the army in Ireland' but that 'power then was in the general of the army and not in the civil power' ('Parliamentary Diary of Narcissus Luttrell', 252). Coningsby thereby transferred the blame for the army's misconduct to Ginckel, nimbly distancing the civil administration of Ireland from William's continental generals. In December 1692, following the sudden death of William Harbord, Coningsby was appointed to the lucrative office of vice-treasurer of Ireland on the nomination of Sidney Godolphin, baron and later first earl of Godolphin, then first lord of the Treasury. His appointment emphasized his position as the principal government spokesman on Ireland in the Commons, but also exposed him to further criticism. Early in 1693 he came again under attack in the English parliament from those who were critical of the terms of Limerick. The attack on 22 February was led by Goodwin Wharton, who produced Irish witnesses, including Brewster, but after two days' debate Coningsby 'spoke very largely in vindication of himself and very much to the satisfaction of the house' ('Parliamentary Diary of Narcissus Luttrell', 447). 
In April 1693 Coningsby was appointed a member of the English privy council. As a member both of the Irish and of the English privy councils he was in a key position for nearly thirty years on the two bodies which, under the terms of Poynings' law, controlled the drafting of all Irish legislation. The same month he was promised a royal pardon for anything which he may have done amiss in Ireland. But in June 1693 his critics returned to the attack. On 24 June Richard Coote, first earl of Bellamont (who was also a member of the Commons at Westminster), and James Hamilton of Tullymore asked the privy council in London to delay his pardon, and on 16 December Bellamont attempted a full scale impeachment of Coningsby and Porter for high treason. On 22 December witnesses were heard, their evidence was discussed on 29 December, on 20 January 1694 Coningsby and Porter replied, and on 24 January the Commons decided that there was no case to answer. They reserved as an exception the condemnation at the Irish privy council of Gaffney, a Dublin farmer involved in the murder of a soldier who had been hanged on Coningsby's orders without a proper trial, but allowed that Coningsby's action was extenuated by the circumstances of the time. Coningsby became known as 'Gaffney's hangman'. 
By this time Coningsby had become a member of an inner cabinet of ministers and confidential advisers to William III that met to formulate policy and plan the management of parliament. In September 1694 he joined William in Flanders, where they discussed the appointment of a lord lieutenant of Ireland. Queen Mary, whose mother, Anne Hyde, was a kinswoman of Lady Coningsby's father, died on 28 December 1694, and in political changes that followed Coningsby lost the vice-treasurership of Ireland to his mother's kinsman, Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan. He did not attend the parliament which met under Henry Capel, Baron Capel of Tewkesbury, lord deputy, in Dublin in August 1695, but concentrated on his role as a government manager in the English Commons. In December 1697 he successfully, but narrowly, won a vote on his motion that the Commons should debate the question of supply only and not the speech from the throne as a whole, thereby helping the government preserve a substantial land force in peacetime. 
Coningsby's first wife had died shortly before 9 November 1697. In March 1698 it was reported that his government colleague Richard Jones, earl of Ranelagh, paymaster-general of the forces, had returned home to find 'My Lord Coningsby in bed with [Ranelagh's] wife. At which sight he said nothing, but withdrew very civilly, and went downstairs about his business. What consequences this is like to have is not yet talked of' ('Hastings MSS', 2.288). Whatever the truth behind the gossip the upshot may have been Coningsby's second marriage, about 23 April 1698, to Lady Frances Jones (1674-1715), Ranelagh's younger daughter, following which the new Lady Coningsby was disinherited by her father. They had one son, who died after choking on a cherry stone in 1708, and two daughters. 
In 1698 government changes following the end of the Nine Years' War included Coningsby's reappointment as vice-treasurer of Ireland, and in October he attended parliament in Dublin. In January 1699 he led the government side in the English Commons on the 'Disbanding Bill', successfully opposing the measure which would have reduced the size of the army to 7000 men. In December he had to support in the English Commons the bill which deprived him of the Irish estates, including Feltrim and Portmarnock, which he had been granted six years before. 
In the latter part of William's reign Coningsby seems to have followed Godolphin in establishing connections with John Churchill, earl and later duke of Marlborough. James Brydges found him with Godolphin and others at Marlborough's house in October 1700 when Marlborough was expecting to be appointed secretary of state. The alliance helped maintain Coningsby's position as a leader of the government side in the Commons following the accession of Queen Anne in 1702. He remained an intermediary on Irish affairs. In 1703 he attended the Dublin parliament called by James Butler, second duke of Ormond, as lord lieutenant. During discussions of the shaping of the Irish 'Penal Bill' by the English privy council in December 1703 and January 1704 he argued for the further underpinning of the dominant role of Church of Ireland protestants, and has been credited with making the bill much harsher towards Catholics and protestant dissenters than had been intended by the Irish politicians who drafted it. His own suspicion of Catholicism, moderated by pragmatism in the 1690s, now harmonized with the wishes of Anne and Nottingham to strengthen Anglicanism across the queen's dominions. He was suspicious of high-churchmen, and in 1705 told the Commons that 'The greatest danger to the Church... came from the pulpits themselves' (Holmes, 'Trial', 46). During the debates on the 'Regency Bill' in the 1705-6 session Coningsby attacked the bill's tory opponents as enemies of the protestant succession. He attended the 1707 Dublin parliament. 
Coningsby was reckoned one of the foremost 'lord treasurer's whigs', working for Godolphin, Anne's lord treasurer, by managing parliamentary business. During the 1708-9 session of what had become the British parliament he negotiated with opposition whigs to ensure that a recruiting bill to keep the army supplied with troops passed the Commons. He was one of the supporters of John Dolben's motion in the Commons on 12 December 1709 that the house take into consideration the sermons of Henry Sacheverell as seditious pamphlets, and in the debate of 14 December 1709 urged that the bookseller and printer be called to the Commons to account for themselves as well. He was a member of the committee that drew up the articles of Sacheverell's prosecution, and in February 1710 was part of the group that managed the trial on the third article, that in alleging that the Church of England was in danger under the Godolphin-Marlborough administration Sacheverell had placed parliament in contempt and slandered the queen. Following Sacheverell's trial he was in the thick of the attack by ministers on the influence that Abigail Masham had with the queen. The queen's determination to shape a new ministry that included Robert Harley, and Coningsby's attachment to Godolphin, led to his departure from office. Coningsby had inherited a dynastic feud with Harley in Herefordshire, and blamed Harley for weakening the administration following his resignation in 1708. On 8 July Coningsby received 'a letter from My Lord Dartmouth, that [the queen] had no more occasion for my service' (Ellis, 18). 
Coningsby, out of office and faced with the ascendancy of the high-church party and opprobrium directed towards the prosecutors of Sacheverell, chose not to stand for parliament in 1710. Like many other whigs he returned from the political wilderness at the accession of George I, whose proclamation he signed in 1714. He was retained as part of George's privy council, reduced from eighty under Anne to thirty-two, and was made lord lieutenant of Herefordshire in November 1714, and lord lieutenant of Radnorshire the next month. He used the lieutenancies to reduce the local influence of the Harley family. At the 1715 election he was reinstated as MP for Leominster. In April 1715 he was one of the secret committee which inquired into the conduct of the negotiators of the treaty of Utrecht. His tough handling of Matthew Prior, who was confined on suspicion of treason, inspired Prior to revenge in the composition of 'The Viceroy', in which Prior revived the charges brought against Coningsby in the abortive impeachment twenty years before. In July 1715 Coningsby carried the articles of impeachment of Robert Harley, by then earl of Oxford, up to the Lords. He spoke on behalf of the 'Septennial Bill' in 1716, and was rewarded for his services to the whig cause on 18 June 1716 when he was created Baron Coningsby of Coningsby, Lincolnshire. 
In July 1716, before George I left for Hanover, Coningsby submitted to the king his 'Account of the state of political parties during the reign of Queen Anne', in which he blamed Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, and the 'Triennial Act' for many of the troubles of the two previous reigns, and gave his personal account of the events which led to the dismissal of Harley in 1708 and of Godolphin in 1710. Historians in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries undervalued the document, as Coningsby was viewed as an egotistical minor figure who exaggerated his own importance; it was also unfinished, as Coningsby declared his intention of taking his account up to 1716 but ended in 1710. However, his claim that Marlborough came very close to siding with Harley in 1708 against Godolphin is supported by other accounts. Coningsby himself claimed that he had kept the Marlborough-Godolphin alliance together, after threatening Marlborough that the 'lord treasurer's whigs' would oppose Harley as chief minister in the Commons. Coningsby's ill feeling towards Lord Oxford and the tories continued to shape his political activity. In 1717 he deliberately withdrew from the Lords before Oxford was discharged. In December 1718, during the debate on the 'Bill for Strengthening the Protestant Interest', which would have repealed the 'Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts', he compared Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, to a biblical false prophet, Balaam. This attempt at wit backfired when Atterbury observed that 'Balaam was reproved by his ass, but that he was never reproved by anyone but the Lord Coningsby' (Bennett, 221) and a contemporary lampoon nicknamed him the 'Rochester Pad'. He was created earl of Coningsby on 30 April 1719. 
Coningsby had become obsessed with his property and with extending his rights as lord of the manors of Marden and Leominster. His conviction that his father-in-law had abused his estate in his youth may have contributed towards the exclusion of his grandson and heir male from succession to his British peerages. In 1717 he protected his estates by a tripartite indenture, placing them in the hands of trustees but ensuring they would benefit his daughters from his second marriage, Margaret (died 1761), created Viscountess Coningsby of Hampton Court in 1717, and Frances ('bap'. 1709, died 1781). The settlement was confirmed by his will in 1724. Meanwhile he attempted to eject freeholders from their properties in Marden and Leominster, arguing that they were his copyhold tenants. On being unable to prove his case in chancery he published a pamphlet maligning lord chancellor Macclesfield, and as a result in January 1721 was stripped of his lieutenancies and imprisoned in the Tower of London for six months, where he was visited by the Marlboroughs. 
Coningsby attempted to remain active in politics despite his disgrace. In November 1721, to Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland, he proposed that Sunderland form a coalition with moderate tories and force a general election in which Robert Walpole would be outflanked. After Marlborough's death in 1722 he proposed marriage to the widowed duchess on 20 November; however, the duchess regarded him as deranged, and rejected him. His fall was completed when Leominster corporation persuaded the duke of Chandos to put their case against Coningsby's encroachments before the privy council; the council found in Leominster's favour, and Coningsby was expelled from the privy council on 7 November 1724. He died at Hampton Court on 30 April 1729, and was buried at Hope under Dinmore, Herefordshire, on 9 May 1729. He was succeeded in his Irish barony by his grandson Richard, second and last Baron Coningsby, who survived only until that December, and in his earldom and estate by his daughter Margaret, on whose death in 1761 the title became extinct; Hampton Court then passed to his younger daughter Frances, the wife of Charles Hanbury Williams (1708-1759).

Coningsby, William (d. 1540), judge, was the second (and eldest surviving) son of Sir Humphrey Coningsby (d. 1535), justice of the king's bench, and his first wife, Isabel Fereby. He was educated in the 1490s at Eton College, and then at King's College, Cambridge, where he was resident from 1497 to 1501; he proceeded to the Inner Temple in the early 1500s. He was appointed a justice of the peace for Hertfordshire as early as 1504, and was perhaps then resident in his father's home at Aldenham. About 1514 he married Beatrice (died 1543), daughter of Thomas Thoresby of Lynn, Norfolk, and widow of William Trew (died 1510/1512). Coningsby then moved to Lynn, where he served as a county magistrate from 1514, as recorder of Lynn from 1524, and as member of parliament for Lynn in 1536. In 1510 he succeeded John Caryll as third protonotary of the common pleas under the terms of an agreement made with his father in 1493; but the scheme to pass on to him at the same time the clerkship of assize on the western circuit failed when the assize judges declined to co-operate. 
Coningsby continued as protonotary until 1539, when he was nominated for the coif. He became in 1518 a bencher of his inn, and gave a second reading, in 1526, on the first chapter of the 'Statute of Merton'. He is mentioned in the 1530s as the steward of Clackclose hundred, and as steward of courts in Norfolk for the priories of Thetford and Lewes. In 1536 he acquired the lucrative post of attorney-general of the duchy of Lancaster, which he occupied until 1540. He was committed to the Tower in February 1540, with other law officers, for advising on a method of settling land that would have seriously damaged the revenue from wardships; but this disgrace did not prevent his being given the coif in June 1540 and then, on 5 July following, the office of justice of the king's bench in succession to John Port. But these advancements came too late to be enjoyed. He died on 10 September 1540, a week after making his last will, and was buried in St Nicholas's Church, Lynn. 
Coningsby owned a house in Woollen Street, Lynn, probably in right of his wife. In 1524 he purchased the manors of Wallington and Thorpland, Norfolk, and thereafter made his principal seat at Eston Hall in Wallington. He had one son, Christopher, slain at the battle of Pinkie in 1547, and four daughters. His granddaughter Elizabeth married Sir Francis Gawdy, chief justice of the common pleas.

Conington, Francis Thirkill (1828-1863), chemist, was born on 3 January 1828, the third son of Richard Conington, incumbent of a chapel of ease at Boston, Lincolnshire. John Conington, professor of classics, was his elder brother. He was educated at Rugby School from 1842 to 1846, in which year he was awarded a Lincolnshire scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He graduated BA, taking a second-class degree in classics in 1850, held a fellowship at his college from 1849 until his death, and proceeded MA in 1853. 
After spending part of 1851-2 abroad as a travelling tutor, Conington was in 1853 appointed vice-principal and classics master of the new Pulteney College, Bath. He resigned this post in 1855, moved to London, where he lodged with his brother at 11 South Square, Gray's Inn, and studied chemistry for two years at University College. His 'Handbook of Chemical Analysis' (1858), based on Heinrich Will's 'Anleitung zur chemischen Analyse', was considered a useful student text. Conington was for a time scientific examiner in the school of natural sciences at Oxford, and it was during one of his examining sessions that he first suffered symptoms of the pulmonary disease from which he died, at Wide Bargate, Boston, on 20 November 1863. Summarizing his character, an obituarist remarked on his varied accomplishments and excellent taste, shrewdness, and humour, which gave pleasure to his many friends ('JCS').
