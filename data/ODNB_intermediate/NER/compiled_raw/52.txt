Francis Kyte (fl. 1710-1745), engraver, at first worked exclusively for Cooper and later also for John Bowles. He was pilloried for forging a bank note in 1725 and this may have been the reason why at this time he sometimes Latinized his name to Milvus. It is fairly certain that he was the same person as the 'rather good' (Waterhouse, 212) portrait painter with dated work in the 1740s, some of which was published.

Kitson, Sir Thomas (1485-1540), merchant and local politician, was born in Warton, Lancashire, the son of Robert Kitson. He was apprenticed to Richard Glasyer, a mercer and merchant adventurer of London, and became free of the City in 1507. He was already trading on his own account on a substantial scale in 1509, and his accounts show that he remained active as a merchant adventurer until his death. In 1534-5, when he exported 625 cloths, only ten merchants exported larger quantities. He dealt mainly in the broadcloths of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Somerset, but also traded on a more limited scale in the coarser Lancashire cottons, Welsh frises, and coarse woollen Kendal penistones, and he cultivated close connections with clothiers in these areas, among them John Clyfflide of Beckington, Thomas Davy of Warminster, Richard Earl of Melksham, and Gilbert Sariscold of Manchester. His imports of fustians, velvets, linens, and spices were typical of the merchant adventurers, although in the 1530s most of the profits of his cloth sales were repatriated by bills of exchange, his exports in that decade being valued at $44,416 compared with imports of only $10,906. His profits on the export of cloth have been calculated as being of the order of 15 to 20 per cent, and, although the profit margins on imports were probably much lower, he accumulated a substantial fortune. 
Kitson's wealth was such that it was rumoured in the City that he had been responsible for the scale of Cardinal Wolsey's fiscal demands in 1522: 'it was mych long of me that the cete prest so grete a sum at this tyme' (CUL, Hengrave Hall deposit, MS 88(1), no. 1). The citizens seem to have retaliated by assessing him harshly, for his assessment was altered from 1000 marks to 4000 marks. Perhaps the assessment of 1535 that his goods were worth 4000 marks ($2666) was near the truth, for the inventory taken on his death valued his net estate at $3142 17's'. 1died His rising prosperity was marked by his acquisition of properties in Suffolk, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, and Nottinghamshire. His most important purchase was the manor of Hengrave in Suffolk, bought from the duke of Buckingham, together with the manor of Colston Basset in Nottinghamshire, for $2340 in 1521, shortly before the duke's attainder. It was at Hengrave that Kitson built the splendid mansion which still survives. More than $3500 was spent on building works there between 1525 and 1539; the house was graced with an avant-garde oriel window incorporating several Renaissance features, and its chapel was decorated with stained glass probably imported from France. Kitson retained a house in London in the parish of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, as well as a suburban residence at Stoke Newington, Middlesex. 
As a young man Kitson had shown a reluctance to participate in the affairs of his livery company, being forced to spend a night in prison in 1509 for his refusal to serve among the bachelors and attend on the presentation of the new mayor at the exchequer, but his civic career was otherwise conventional. He served as sheriff of London in 1533-4, and on 28 July 1534 was elected alderman of Castle Baynard ward, where he remained until his death. He was a warden of the Mercers' Company in 1525-6 and 1533-4, and served as master in 1534-5. He was knighted in 1533. 
The identity of Kitson's first wife is unknown, although there was a daughter, Elizabeth, who married Edmund Crofts of Westowe in Suffolk. His second wife was Margaret (1510-1561) ['see 'Bourchier, Margaret, 'under' Kitson family]. She was the only child of John Donnington (died 1544) of Stoke Newington, a member of the Salters' Company of London, and his wife, Elizabeth Pye. From this marriage he had a posthumous son, Thomas, and four daughters. His widow, Dame Margaret, was an attractive catch for Sir Richard Long (died 1546), a gentleman of the privy chamber, and she remarried within two months of her husband's death. In 1548 she took as her third husband John Bourchier, second earl of Bath (1489-1561). She commissioned the lavish tomb with effigies of herself and her husbands which can still be seen in Hengrave church. Kitson's four daughters all seem to have made advantageous marriages: Catherine to Sir John Spencer of Wormleighton in Warwickshire, Dorothy ['see 'Tasburgh, Dorothy] to Sir Thomas Packington of Aylesbury, Frances to John Bourchier, Lord Fitzwarine, and Anne to Sir William Spring of Pakenham in Suffolk. His son, Sir Thomas Kitson (1540-1603) ['see under 'Kitson family], was briefly (1557-8) married to Jane, the daughter of William, Lord Paget, but acquired a firm ally in Sir Thomas Cornwallis by marrying his daughter Elizabeth in 1560 ['see 'Kitson, Elizabeth, 'under' Kitson family]. Although conforming to the Elizabethan settlement, he was associated with the conservatives among the Suffolk gentry. 
Kitson died at Hengrave on 11 September 1540 and was buried in Hengrave church. The brevity of his will makes it difficult to determine his religious inclinations, but he seems to have been aligned with the more conservative clergy. He had numerous business dealings with John Kite, bishop of Carlisle, to whose will he was overseer, and his funeral sermon was preached by Dr Nicholas Wilson, the arch-conservative rector of St Thomas the Apostle in London.

Labelye, Charles (bap. 1705, d. 1762), engineer and mathematician, was born in Vevey, Switzerland, and baptized on 12 August 1705, the son of Francois Dangeau La Belye and his wife, Elisabeth, 'nee' Grammont. The baptismal entry of a subsequent child in 1709 described the father as 'Monsieur Francois Dangeau, Sieur de la Belye, refugie en cette ville par sa Religion' ('DNB'). Labelye's Huguenot father is thought to have been related to the marquis de Dangeau, a prominent member of the court of Louis XIV and author of a volume of memoirs. Another child was baptized in 1714: one of the godparents was Madame de Warens, the associate of J. J. Rousseau (Chavannes, 262). 
Labelye moved to England in the early 1720s: 'I was neither born nor bred in England, but in Swisserland; and never heard a word of English spoken, till I was near twenty years of age' he wrote in 1739 (Labelye, vi), but he claimed in 1736 that he had been resident in London for some sixteen years. He soon made contact with Huguenot circles, in particular with J. T. Desaguliers (1683-1744), and joined a French masonic lodge in 1725. He travelled to Madrid in 1727-8, and is known to have visited the Low Countries at some point. By November 1728 he was back in London, and embarked on his career as a mathematician and engineer. In 1734 he supplied maps and plans of the Thames to promoters of a scheme to erect a bridge at Westminster, and in April 1735 wrote a letter to Desaguliers concerning the prevalent laws of motions and their mathematical implications which was subsequently published in Desaguliers's 'Course of Experimental Philosophy' (1745, 2.77). Labelye's calculations concerning water flow were used by Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736) in his 'Propositions for Erecting a New Stone Bridge at Westminster' in 1736. They were the first contribution to bridge building in Britain made by scientific theory. In that year he produced the 'Mapp of the downes... together with the soundings at low water, places of anchorage and all the necessary leading marks', in which he described himself as an 'Engineer, late Teacher of Mathematics in the Royal Navy' (TNA: PRO, MPH 218). 
It was the building of Westminster Bridge that brought Labelye to prominence. An act of parliament (9 Geo. II, cap. 29) was passed in 1736, entitled 'An act for building a bridge across the River Thames, from the New Palace Yard in the City of Westminster to the opposite shore in the county of Surrey'. In June 1737 Labelye was one of five persons instructed to provide the commissioners of the bridge with surveys of the river, and in May 1738 he was appointed engineer at a yearly salary of $100, with daily expenses of 10's'. The selection of a foreigner for a work of such national prestige caused considerable resentment among Labelye's disappointed rivals: he had already been attacked as 'the Swiss imposter' by the disappointed Batty Langley (1696-1751). The various schemes were reviewed in a work published by John James (died 1746) in 1736. The first pile for the bridge's foundations was driven in September 1738, and the first stone laid in January 1739 by Henry Herbert, ninth earl of Pembroke, the most active of the many Westminster Bridge commissioners. 
Labelye's commission initially extended only to the erection of stone piers; the design of the superstructure was not decided upon until 1740, when a modified version of Labelye's 1738 design was agreed upon. The final result consisted of a stone bridge of fifteen arches and fourteen piers. Labelye was assisted considerably in the architectural treatment of the bridge by the earl of Pembroke. Of particular significance was Labelye's employment of caissons -- huge open wooden boxes, built on the shore and sunk into the river bed -- within which the stone piers were constructed. The method was not new, but had never been tried on such a scale. Labelye published 'A short account of the methods made use of in laying the foundation of the piers of Westminster Bridge' in 1739, and the anonymous 'Present State of Westminster Bridge' is believed also to be by Labelye. A prospectus for a large work on the bridge was issued in 1744, but not proceeded with. Labelye's 'The Description of Westminster Bridge', a slightly expanded version of his 1739 work, appeared in 1751, and the caisson design was published in Belidor's 'Architecture hydraulique' (vol. 4, 1752). The bridge was substantially complete by late 1746 but some piers had begun to show signs of excessive settlement. Labelye was obliged to oversee an expensive programme of repair, while Batty Langley saw fit to publish 'A Survey of Westminster Bridge, as 'tis now Sinking into Ruin', in which Labelye was termed 'an insolvent ignorant, arrogating Swiss', and attacked in a cartoon. The bridge was not opened to traffic until November 1750. 
In a petition to the bridge commissioners of February 1751 Labelye observed how much money he had saved the project, and how much he had suffered on behalf of the commission, 'in whose service I have spent above 12 years and the prime of my life, and greatly impaired my health having contracted asthma (daily growing upon me) by my constant attendance on the works, especially on the water in winterly and rainy weather' (Ruddock, 17). He also claimed to have turned down several lucrative offers from abroad. He was accordingly granted a gratuity of $2000 from the bridge commissioners, and was retained as engineer at a salary of $150. The largest stone bridge built up to that time in Britain, Westminster Bridge attracted considerable attention at home and abroad and was depicted in numerous paintings and engravings. In 1752 the bridge was described as 'the most magnificent monument of our times' (Belidor, 4.191). 
Other projects occupied Labelye, although his only other bridge was that over the Thames at Brentford, commenced in 1740 and completed in 1742. He was consulted in 1746 by the corporation of London concerning London Bridge, but his proposals were not acted upon. Labelye's design for a harbour at Sandwich was engraved by Harris about 1740, and in 1747 he prepared a report on Yarmouth harbour. He also produced a report in 1748 on the improvement of the River Wear and the port of Sunderland. 
Labelye enjoyed the patronage of John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, as well as that of the earl of Pembroke. In 1744 the duke asked him to prepare a report on the drainage of the fens: this was published in 1745 as 'The Result of a View of the Great Level of the Fens', and revealed Labelye's familiarity with continental drainage systems. Late in 1745 Labelye was asked to prepare a report on the viability of repairing the Howland Great Wet Dock in Rotherhithe. The resulting report, written in April 1746, recommended selling the dock to the Royal Navy: that the duke of Bedford was first lord of the Admiralty cannot have escaped Labelye's attention. 
Labelye was naturalized by act of parliament in 1746 (19 Geo. II, cap. 26), but the criticisms of Westminster Bridge and the effect upon his health resulted in a decision to leave England. Little is known of his later life. In April 1752 he departed for southern France, and in 1753 he was encountered in Naples. He subsequently lived in Paris, where he became acquainted with Jean-Rodolph Perronnet, head of the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees, to whom he bequeathed papers and a model of Westminster Bridge. 
Several dates have been proposed for Labelye's death. According to Pierre-Charles Lesage he died in France about 1770 ('Recueil de divers memoires extrait de la Bibliotheque des Ponts et Chaussees', 1810); two later publications, 'Le conservateur Suisse' (1817) and Albert de Montet's 'Dictionnaire biographique des genevois et des vaudois' (1877), give 17 December 1781. However, an earlier date of 1762 appears more likely given several obituary notices in the English press of which the earliest ('London Chronicle', 25 Feb 1762) noted news 'by letters from Paris' of Labelye's death 'in a pretty advanced age'; similar notices were carried in the 'Gentleman's Magazine', which gave the date of death as 18 February in Paris ('GM', 32, 1762, 94) and in the 'Norfolk Gazette' (6 March 1762); in August 1764 the 'Gazeteer and New Daily Advertiser' referred to the 'late ingenious Mr Labelye'. The 'London Chronicle' commented that, as a British citizen, Labelye had refused requests to work on French fortifications while living in that country. He is not known to have married, or fathered any children. Westminster Bridge was rebuilt in 1854-62.

They both retired from the stage about 1865 and taught at the Royal Academy of Music.

Lablache, Frederick (1815-1887), singer, eldest son of Luigi Lablache (1795-1858) and his wife, Teresa Pinotti, was born in Naples on 29 August 1815, and trained by his father. He made his debut in 1835 at the Theatre Italien, Paris, as the Count in Bellini's 'La sonnambula', and his London stage debut at the Lyceum in Donizetti's 'L'elisir d'amore' (16 November 1837). Until 1852 he sang bass-baritone parts in some of his father's London and Paris seasons; at Naples in 1836 he created the part of Edoardo III in Donizetti's 'L'assedio di Calais'. Most of his career was in the British Isles. In the late 1840s he appeared in Jenny Lind's highly successful provincial tours, managed by Michal Balfe; the critic J. W. Davison then called him 'a clever intelligent artist'. He also toured with his wife, the contralto

Lablache, Luigi (1795-1858), singer, son of Nicolas Lablache (died 1799), an emigre Marseilles merchant, and his wife, Marie Francesca Bietagh (of Irish descent), was born at Naples on 6 December 1795. In 1806 he entered the Conservatorio della Pieta dei Turchini, the only survivor of the famous Naples music schools. His education, lasting until 1812, made him a thorough musician. In that year he won an engagement at the Teatro San Carlino, home of popular comic opera. In 1813 he married the singer Teresa Pinotti; they had thirteen children, several of them, notably Frederick Lablache, likewise singers. 
After several years singing at Palermo (1816-20), Lablache was by 1821, when he appeared at La Scala, a finished singer -- a bass-baritone with an even two-octave range from E to E and the ability to sing both traditional comic parts and the new virtuoso serious roles of Romantic opera. Through Domenico Barbaja, who from 1823 ran the leading opera houses of Milan, Naples, and Vienna, Lablache quickly became known in all three cities; in 1827 he took part in Beethoven's funeral. He showed his versatility by singing at various times all three lower parts in Rossini's 'Il barbiere di Siviglia' as well as the florid, sinister part of Assur in his 'Semiramide'. 
From 1829 to 1851 in Paris, and from 1834 to 1855 in London, Lablache divided his career largely between the Italian opera houses of the two richest countries in the world. He still created roles in new operas: in Bellini's 'I puritani' (Paris, 1835) as one of the ''Puritani' quartet' (with Grisi, Rubini, and Tamburini), long remembered as the finest of singers; in ten of Donizetti's operas, including 'Don Pasquale', his most famous comic performance (Paris, 1843); and in one by Verdi ('I masnadieri', Her Majesty's, 1847). In London he taught singing to Princess (later Queen) Victoria. A late sensation was his Caliban in Halevy's 'La tempesta' (Her Majesty's, 1850), and from 1852 to 1857 he sang each year at St Petersburg. In 1857 his health declined rapidly; he died in Naples on 23 January 1858, and was buried with his wife at Maisons-Laffitte, near Paris. 
Lablache was a very big man, yet graceful in his movements; his voice was likewise huge but under firm control. In a long career he was universally admired as a matchless singing actor, to the critic Henry Chorley 'one of the greatest musicians and artists ever seen or heard'.

Labouchere, Henry, Baron Taunton (1798-1869), politician, was the elder son of Pierre Cesar Labouchere (1772-1839) ['see under 'Hope family] of Hylands, Essex, and Over Stowey, Somerset, and his wife, Dorothy Elizabeth ('b'. 1771), third daughter of Sir Francis Baring, first baronet; he was born on 15 August 1798 at St Marylebone, Middlesex. The Huguenot family of Labouchere had left France at the time of the edict of Nantes, and established themselves in Holland. Pierre Cesar Labouchere, a partner in the great mercantile firm of Hope, was the first of his family who settled in England. His son Henry was educated at Winchester College, and on 24 October 1816 matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a first class in Greats in 1820, and graduated BA 1821, and MA 1828. He was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn on 30 April 1817, but was never called to the bar. In 1824 Labouchere travelled with Edward Stanley, J. E. Denison, and John Stuart Wortley (afterwards lords Derby, Ossington, and Wharncliffe) through Canada and the United States. 
At a by-election in April 1826 Labouchere was returned as a whig for St Michael's and held the seat at the 1827 general election. He soon obtained a reputation as a competent Commons speaker. His first reported speech in the house was made during the debate on the civil government of the Canadas in May 1828 ('Hansard 2', 316-18), when he drew attention to the abuses of the system of government, and declared that if 'we cannot keep the Canadas with the good will of the inhabitants, we cannot keep them at all'. At the general election in August 1830 he was returned at the head of the poll for the borough of Taunton, and represented that constituency until his retirement from the House of Commons. In June 1832 he was appointed a lord of the Admiralty in Grey's administration, a post which he resigned on Peel's accession to office. He then became master of the Royal Mint in Melbourne's government in 1835 and on offering himself for re-election was opposed at the last minute by Disraeli, whom he defeated by 452 to 282 votes. He was sworn of the privy council on 6 May and was further appointed vice-president of the Board of Trade. He was under-secretary for war and the colonies from February to August 1839, when, resigning the vice-presidentship but retaining the mastership of the mint, he became president of the Board of Trade (29 August) in succession to Poulett Thomson, and was admitted to the cabinet. As president, he introduced measures lowering general rates of duty in the West Indies and North America. On Melbourne's resignation in September 1841, Labouchere retired from office with the rest of his colleagues, and on the formation of Russell's first administration in July 1846 became chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland (John William Ponsonby, earl of Bessborough). The authorization of 'reproductive' employment (that is, public works) by the famous 'Labouchere letter' of 5 October 1846 failed as a remedy for the widespread distress in Ireland; its terms were 'so guarded as to be not clearly intelligible' (Woodham-Smith, 130). He was reluctant to concede that fever accompanied famine. Soon after Bessborough's death Labouchere was succeeded as chief secretary by Sir W. M. Somerville, and was reappointed president of the Board of Trade (22 July 1847) in the place of Lord Clarendon, the new lord lieutenant. While holding this office Labouchere successfully -- though with several false starts -- carried through the House of Commons the bill by which the navigation laws were repealed (12 & 13 Vict. c. 29), in spite of the strong opposition of the shipping interest (which, with Gladstone's help, persuaded Labouchere to leave coastal trade unchanged). He was also instrumental in passing the 'Mercantile Marine Acts' (13 & 14 Vict. c. 93; 14 & 15 Vict. c. 96) and the 'Seaman's Fund Act' (14 & 15 Vict. c. 102). He retired with the rest of his colleagues on Russell's overthrow in February 1852, and was one of the whigs left out by Aberdeen when he formed his government at the end of 1852. 
Though not an original member of Palmerston's first ministry, Labouchere was appointed secretary of state for the colonies (21 November 1855), in the place of Sir William Molesworth, after the refusal of the post by Lord Derby and Sidney Herbert, and continued to hold this office until Palmerston's resignation in February 1858. As colonial secretary he was efficient, high-principled, and even-tempered, and was willing to make allowances for the difficulties of his governors. He supported Sir George Grey's plans for the establishment of Natal as a separate colony and supported Thomas Gore Browne's attempts to arrange a compromise between settler interests and the Maori in New Zealand. On Palmerston's return to power Labouchere was created Baron Taunton, of Taunton in the county of Somerset, by letters patent dated 18 August 1859. He took his seat in the House of Lords for the first time on 24 January 1860, but though he took part in the debates from time to time, he held no further ministerial offices. He continued, however, to play an important part in public life as a commissioner. He had been one of the commissioners of the 1851 exhibition and had presided over the royal commission on the City of London in 1853-4. He was chairman of the schools inquiry commission of 1864-7, which generated twenty-one volumes of evidence on endowed, private, and proprietary schools which had not been investigated by the Newcastle and Clarendon commissions. The Taunton commission was one of the most thorough of all Victorian inquiries. He was a trustee of the British Museum from 1860. 
Labouchere married, first, on 10 April 1840, his cousin Frances, the youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Baring, bt, with whom he had three daughters. She died on 25 May 1850, and on 13 July 1852 he married Lady Mary Matilda Georgiana (1823-1892), the youngest daughter of George Howard, sixth earl of Carlisle; they had no children, and his nephew Henry Labouchere (1831-1912) was his financial heir. In default of male issue the barony of Taunton became extinct upon his death, which occurred at his home, 27 Belgrave Square, London, on 13 July 1869. He was buried at Over Stowey church on 20 July. Though usually described as a whig, Labouchere was really a moderate Liberal, one of those who linked the whig party to what became the Liberal Party of the 1860s.

Lacaita, Sir James Philip (1813-1895), scholar and politician, the only son of Diego Lacaita of Manduria, in the province of Lecce, Italy, and of Agata Conti of Agnone in the Molise, was born at Manduria on 4 October 1813. He took a law degree at the University of Naples, was admitted an advocate in 1836, and practised his profession. An acquaintance with Enos Throop, the United States' charge d'affaires at Naples, begun in December 1838, helped him in the study of English, and this knowledge gained him the post of legal adviser to the British legation at Naples, and the friendship of the minister, Sir William Temple, at whose table he met many distinguished English travellers. 
Lacaita's political opinions were liberal but moderate, and he never belonged to any of the Italian secret societies. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the representation of the city of Naples in 1848, and on 7 April was appointed secretary to the Neapolitan legation in London, but did not start for his post, which he resigned after the fall of the liberal Troya ministry in May. In November 1850 he met Gladstone, who was in Naples for family reasons and was beginning to collect information about Bourbon misrule. This meeting led to the arrest of Lacaita on 3 January 1851, and he remained in custody for nine days. In a letter from Gladstone to Panizzi, in September, he is referred to as 'a most excellent man, hunted by the government' (Fagan, 'Life of Panizzi', 2.97, 205-6). Lacaita's friendship with Gladstone, which lasted the rest of their lives, did much to establish the respectability of the Risorgimentists among the Peelites. 
The publication of Gladstone's 'Letters to Lord Aberdeen', for which Lacaita supplied many of the details, aroused the hostility of the court and clerical partisans in Italy, and Lacaita found it advisable to leave Naples for London, where he arrived on 8 January 1852. He was at Edinburgh on 14 February, in May he was an unsuccessful candidate for the office of librarian of the London Library, and on 15 June 1852 he married Maria Clavering (died 1853), daughter of Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael, seventh baronet. His means were small, but he made many powerful friends in the best political and literary circles in London and Edinburgh. From November 1853 until April 1856 he was professor of Italian at Queen's College, London, was naturalized in July 1855, and published 'Selections from the Best Italian Writers' (1855; 2nd edn, 1863). In the winter of 1856-7 he accompanied Lord Minto to Florence and Turin. From 1857 to 1863 he acted as private secretary to Lord Lansdowne, and towards the close of 1858 went with Gladstone to the Ionian Islands as secretary to the mission, being made KCMG for his services in March 1859. 
Lacaita was entrusted by Cavour with a delicate diplomatic negotiation in 1860 connected with schemes to prevent Garibaldi from crossing from Sicily to Calabria, and subsequently the Neapolitan government offered him the post of minister in London with the title of marquess, both of which he declined (Fagan, 'Life of Panizzi', 2.208). In December 1860, after the expulsion of the Bourbons, he revisited Naples, caused his name to be reinstated on the municipal registry, and in July 1861, while back in England, was returned as deputy to the first Italian legislature. He generally supported the new Italian government. After the dissolution of 1865 he did not seek re-election, and was made a senator in 1876. Though speaking but seldom in the chamber, he exercised a considerable influence upon public affairs between 1861 and 1876 through his intimacy with Ricasoli, La Marmora, Minghetti, Visconti-Venosta, and other leading political figures. Florence became his headquarters in Italy after the removal of the government thence from Turin, and so it remained even after the transfer of the capital to Rome. He spent a portion of each year in England, and during the last fifteen years of his life wintered at Leucaspide, near Taranto, where he had made large purchases of monastic lands in 1868. He was a director of the Italian company for the southern railways from its formation, and took a share in the management of several Anglo-Italian public companies. Besides his English title, he was a knight of the Brazilian Order of the Rose, and knight commander of SS. Maurizio e Lazzaro and of the Corona d'Italia. 
During his earlier years in England Lacaita frequently lectured on Italian subjects at the Royal Institution, the London Institution, and elsewhere. He wrote nearly all the Italian articles for the eighth edition of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica', and revised several editions of Murray's 'Handbook for South Italy'. In 1865 he edited the third, or album, volume of the great edition of the 'Inferno di Dante' (3 vols., 1858-65), after the death of Lord Vernon, having helped in the production of the former volumes. He compiled the 'Catalogue of the Library at Chatsworth' (4 vols., 1879) for the seventh duke of Devonshire, and edited the first complete publication of the famous Latin lectures on Dante of Benvenuto da Imola, delivered in 1375, 'Comentum super Dantis Aldigherii Comoediam nunc primum integre in lucem editum, sumptibus Guil. Warren Vernon' (5 vols., 1887). 
Lacaita died at Posilipo, near Naples, on 4 January 1895, in his eighty-second year, leaving an only son, Charles Carmichael Lacaita, later his biographer and Liberal MP for Dundee. During forty-five years his life and interests were divided between Britain and Italy; in the one a polished Englishman, in the other a vivacious Neapolitan and a conscientious landowner. He was a notable Dante scholar, an excellent bibliographer, a man of wide reading and intellectual sympathy, of great social tact and goodness of heart.

Wolfe, William (1584-1673), Jesuit, was born at Scarborough, the son of John Wolfe, a tanner, and Eleanor Lacey, daughter of Bryan Lacey and a poor relation of a gentry family of Folkton. He was sent to Oxford by a Catholic uncle, by whom he had been educated. He became a student in Magdalen College in 1600, and graduated BA on 2 July 1606. Having been reconciled to the Roman Catholic church at Oxford he went abroad as a servant to Sir William Windsor, who recommended him to the Jesuits at St Omer, where he stayed in 1607-8. He entered the English College at Rome in 1608 and after receiving minor orders left for Nancy in order to enter the Society of Jesus in the noviciate on 11 November 1611. He studied theology at Louvain from 1615, and was ordained priest there in 1617. After teaching at St Omer (1618-22) he completed his tertianship at Ghent in 1623 and he was sent to England. In 1625 he was a missioner in the Lancashire district and in 1633 he was in the Oxfordshire district, or St Mary's residence, and two years later was in St George's residence, which comprised Worcestershire and Warwickshire. He was professed of the four vows on 21 November 1637. In 1649 he was again in Oxfordshire, where he remained, as missioner at Oxford, until his death. He died at Dolphin Hall, Oxford, on 17 July 1673, and was buried in the parish church of Somerton, Oxfordshire. A number of writings have been attributed to him but are now thought to be the work of fellow Jesuits Edward Knott and John Floyd.

Lachtin mac Tarbin (d. 622/7) was abbot of Achad Ur (Freshford) and Belach Febrat (Ballyhoura Hills), the former one of the more important churches in southern Osraige. It produced the impressive early twelfth-century arm shrine, known as St Lachtin's Arm. Unfortunately, however, there is no extant life of the founder saint. He is commemorated on 19 March in 'Felire Oengusso' and the annals record his death in 622 and in 627. The west Munster synod assigns him, and his successors, authority over the Muscraige. This is related to his paternal affiliation: his father, Tarbin, was of the Muscraige. The Latin life of Mo Choemoc makes Lachtin a disciple of Comgall of Bangor. Like many saints, Lachtin has left little more evidence of his cult than a date in a calendar and a church site.

Lackington, George (1777-1844), bookseller and publisher, was born in London on 30 December 1777 and baptized at St James's, Westminster, on 22 January 1778, the son of Charles Lackington, a thriving coal merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Street. He was third cousin of James Lackington (1746-1815), bookseller and publisher. His father purchased a share in James Lackington's business for his son, and at the age of thirteen George, who was 'well educated and gentlemanly' (Nichols, 'Lit. anecdotes', 8.51b), began work in the bookshop which was then located at Chiswell Street, London. When in 1794 the firm moved to the building in Finsbury Square known as the Temple of the Muses, it was a very successful business which dealt in cheap remaindered books sold for cash, and at the height of its prosperity was said to employ more than 100 people. When James Lackington retired in 1798, George was made head of the firm, which became known as Lackington, Allen & Co. 
By 1803 Lackington, Allen & Co. were also considerable publishers: one of their advertisements lists forty-three items including their latest 'Catalogue of Ancient and Modern Books, comprising upwards of 800,000 volumes, the largest collection for sale in Europe'. Their sales list for the same year had widened to include classical texts and contemporary writers such as Tobias Smollett. The list also includes William Turton's 'Medical Glossary' (Turton was a relative of James Lackington by marriage), and William Fordyce Mavor's 'Natural History' (Mavor's son became one of the partners of the firm). 
On 18 March 1805 George Lackington married Eliza Bullock, daughter of Captain Bullock RN. They had three daughters and two sons, born between 1806 and 1818. Between 1815 and 1817 Lackington, Allen & Co. suffered losses amounting to $2198 under the 'Copyright Act' which, in an amendment of 1814, contentiously required the deposit of eleven copies of new publications in certain libraries. Lackington's correspondence with Sir Egerton Brydges, MP for Maidstone, who was attempting to bring in reforms to the act, was printed in Brydges's pamphlet 'Reasons for a Further Amendment of... the Copyright Act of Queen Anne' (1817). It also contains letters Lackington exchanged with James Bean, assistant keeper of printed books in the British Museum. Lackington, Allen & Co. were publishing a number of expensive works in parts by subscription, several of which had commenced before 1814 (notably Dugdale's 'Monasticon'), and they were unwilling to supply the earliest parts. In 1815 Lackington was forced to comply with a demand from the British Museum. 
By 1822 the business was conducted under the name Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, and Lepard. Joseph Harding was one of the early partners who had served his apprenticeship with his father, John Harding, agricultural bookseller of St James's Street. In 1825 George Lackington bought from William Bullock Egyptian Hall, situated at 170-71 Piccadilly, which housed Bullock's Museum. In 1831 he turned part of the building into an exhibition hall (it was demolished in 1905) and in 1832 withdrew from involvement in it. 
After Lackington's retirement the firm moved to Pall Mall East and was known as Harding and Lepard. Lackington, who always had a facility for financial affairs, was in later years, according to Nichols, an official assignee of bankrupts. Lackington died on 31 March 1844 at his home in Circus Road, St John's Wood, London, and was buried in a family vault at Kensal Green cemetery. The last link with Lackington ended in December 1886 with the death of James Kanes Ford, who had worked for Lackington until 1821, when he left to set up his own bookselling business in London at Upper Street, Islington.

Lackington, James (1746-1815), bookseller and publisher, was born in Wellington, Somerset, on 31 August 1746, the eldest of the eleven children of George Lackington, a journeyman shoemaker, and his wife, Joan Trott, the daughter of a poor weaver in Wellington. James's early life owed little to his father, who was a drunkard, and he claimed to be indebted to his mother for everything. He received only a few years' schooling because the family was unable to afford it, and James was required to help with the care of his brothers and sisters. At the age of ten he left home to live with a pie merchant, and entered into the business of selling pies with considerable success. 
When Lackington was fourteen he went with his father to Taunton and was apprenticed for seven years to George and Mary Bowden, shoemakers; here he learned to read and first attended a Methodist meeting. With only a few months of his apprenticeship left to run his freedom was purchased by friends of the two candidates then contesting the election of 1768 in Taunton. He moved to Bristol, where he lodged with John Jones, a shoemaker, and together they plied their trade. Though he was still unable to write, Lackington composed several songs and ballads, one of which he sold for a guinea, and a number of which were printed. No evidence of these has been traced. In Bristol, Lackington first heard John Wesley preach in Broadmead, and this reawakened his enthusiasm for Methodism. He moved to lodgings in St Philip's Plain where his room overlooked the churchyard, and converted Jones and his friends to Methodism. At this time the idea of selling books first attracted Lackington and Jones, and all the spare money they accumulated was spent in purchasing books (although it was some years before Lackington became a bookseller). In 1770 he married Nancy Smith, whom he had first met in Taunton seven years before, at St Peter's Church, Bristol. 
In August 1773 Lackington moved to the City of London, lodging first in Whitecross Street. He was soon joined by his wife, who died that November. In the same month his grandfather George Lackington, a gentleman farmer at Langford, near Wellington, died leaving James a legacy of $10. In June 1774 Lackington opened his first bookshop in Featherstone Street, with stock consisting of a few books and some scraps of leather together worth about $5. He acquired an interest-free loan of $5 from the Methodists to enable him to purchase more stock. Six months later his business had prospered sufficiently for him to move to 46 Chiswell Street, where he remained for fourteen years. Here Lackington would occasionally hold literary suppers attended by, among others, Henry Lemoine, the bookseller, who after Lackington had published his memoirs in 1791 wrote what he described as 'The real life of Lackington'. Another member of the circle was Thomas Hood, father of the poet. On 30 January 1776 Lackington married Dorcas Turton, a schoolmistress who had attended Nancy during her final illness. She was a great reader of novels and lover of books, and helped her husband in the shop while he was away buying stock. Lackington, who was at this time reading Thomas Amory's 'Life of John Buncle', experienced a change in attitude towards Methodism, and spoke publicly in criticism of it. 
In 1778 Lackington took into business John Denis, son of an oilman in Cannon Street, who provided the capital to allow the stock of books to be doubled. In 1779 the firm of Lackington & Co. published its first catalogue, which contained 12,000 items. The partnership with Denis was dissolved in 1780 because of a dispute over who should buy the stock. The original agreement was that Lackington bought the stock and Denis provided the finance, but Denis questioned Lackington's purchases. Catalogues were issued annually, increasing in size (that for 1784 contained 30,000 books). All books were for sale at the lowest possible price for cash only, with no credit given. Lackington purchased large quantities of books as remainders and sold them very cheaply, causing acrimony among the trade (other booksellers bought remainders in order to destroy them and increase the price of those left). He emblazoned his carriage with the motto 'Small profits do great things', and claimed he had 'Been highly instrumental in diffusing the general desire for reading, now so prevalent among the inferior orders of society' ('Memoirs', letter 25). Lackington was meticulous in keeping his accounts, and profits were calculated each week. His account books were kept publicly in his shop as he never saw any reason for concealing them. He sold more than 100,000 volumes annually. In 1787 he visited Edinburgh by way of York and Newcastle, returning through Glasgow, Carlisle, Leeds, Lancaster, Preston, and Manchester. He was not impressed with the bookshops he visited, saying that nothing but trash was to be found. He visited Edinburgh again in 1790 and his opinion was unchanged. 
Lackington published the first edition of his 'Memoirs', which ran into many subsequent editions, in 1791. It is the principal source of information about him; in addition to the particulars of his life, the work is full of curious anecdotes and many quotations from a wide range of authors. At the time of publication his profits were $4000; in 1792 they had increased to $5000. Lackington had also extended his business into publishing a number of works, many of them theological, as is shown by a sales list of about 1791. In 1794 Lackington first issued tokens, in the form of metal coins, worth a halfpenny and a penny; the halfpenny had on the obverse a full-face portrait of Lackington, while the reverse pictured an angel blowing a trumpet and the inscription 'halfpenny of J. Lackington and Co.' It is believed that more than 700,000 Lackington tokens were issued (only valid in Lackington's business). They were all struck by Lutwyche of Birmingham. 
In 1794 Lackington also moved to larger premises in Finsbury Square and called his new shop the Temple of the Muses. Built in 1789, it was one of the wonders of London (it burned down in 1841). It was of a considerable size and surmounted by an immense dome; its large circular counter was in such a spacious room that a coach and four horses drove round it after the opening day. Over the entrance was inscribed 'Cheapest Bookseller in the World' (tokens issued from these premises reproduced this as a legend). It was said that a million books were on display ('Repository of Arts', 1, 1809). Between the First and Second world wars a street near Finsbury Square was renamed Lackington Street. 
With this greater prosperity Lackington purchased a house at Merton in Surrey. It was here on 27 February 1795 that his wife died; her husband wrote the lengthy epitaph on her headstone in Merton churchyard. Later that year on 11 June Lackington married Mary Turton, the younger daughter of William Turton, an attorney of Alveston, Gloucestershire, and a relative of his second wife. He retired in 1798 and made over his business to his third cousin George Lackington (1777-1844), who had been brought up in the business since the age of thirteen. Thereafter the business was known as Lackington, Allen & Co. Robin Allen had also worked for James Lackington from a young age. The other partners, Patrick Kirkman, Richard Hughes (a lessee of Sadler's Wells), and Thomas Hasker, had been made partners in 1794. James Lackington retired to Thornbury near Alveston, where he erected a small chapel and purchased two small estates. He engaged in a number of charitable ventures and also made a contribution to the newly erected Arminian Methodist chapel at Weymouth. 
By 1804 Lackington regretted his early criticism of Methodism and published 'The Confessions of J. Lackington'. These were thirty 'Letters to a Friend' expressing his opinions and attitudes to Methodists and their beliefs, to make amends for having 'publicly ridiculed a very large and respectable body of Christians' ('DNB'). Like his 'Memoirs' they show considerable evidence of his wide reading of classical and religious works, and of contemporary writers, especially poets. In 1806 he moved back to Taunton and erected the Temple Methodist Church at a cost of $3000. There is no record of its use until about five years later when it was acquired by the Wesleyan Methodists of Taunton. He moved to Budleigh Salterton in 1807 and built his house, Ash Villa, which later became the Methodist manse. In the same year he also spent $2000 to build the first Temple Church there. He endowed it with $150 a year for the minister's stipend. The present church, built in 1904, now stands on the same ground. James Lackington died on 22 November 1815 and was buried in the East Budleigh churchyard. His third wife survived him. 
All subsequent biographical notices of Lackington draw on his 'Memoirs'. Lackington was not always consistent in his information, and he was a self-opinionated and vain man who claimed in the preface 'that my performance possessed so much intrinsic merit, as would occasion it to be universally admired by all good judges, as a prodigious effort of human genius'.

La Cloche, Jacques de (1644/1647?-1669), pretended son of Charles II, may have come from Jersey, but nothing is known of his early life or true parentage. He claimed to be the son of Charles II (1630-1685) and he named a woman in his will as 'Dona Maria Stuarda, della famiglia delli baroni di S. Marzo'. According to La Cloche, her 'nearness and greatness of blood was the cause... that his Majestie would never acknowledge him' (Kent, letters to Joseph Williamson, TNA: PRO, SP 85.10, fol. 111). Whom La Cloche meant by this is unclear, but Lady Mary Stuart, duchess of Richmond and Lennox and countess of March (1622-1685) ['see 'Villiers, Mary], has been suggested. A previous identification of his mother as Marguerite de Carteret (1625-1713) of Jersey, who in 1656 married Jean de La Cloche, son of Etienne de La Cloche, rector of St Ouen, seems improbable. The first contemporary notice of La Cloche occurred when he was admitted to the Jesuit novitiate in Sant' Andrea al Quirinale, Rome, the register of novices recording the admission on 11 November 1668 of Jacobus de La Cloche, from the island of Jersey, aged twenty-four. 
La Cloche brought with him apparently significant documents whose authenticity, however, is disputed. Two, purporting to have been signed and sealed by Charles II, recognized La Cloche as his son. A third, supposedly supplied by Queen Kristina of Sweden, also certified La Cloche's paternity. Further letters, dated in August 1668 and seemingly by Charles II, were sent to Father Oliva, general of the Jesuits. These also acknowledged La Cloche's royal paternity and suggested that La Cloche come to London and begin negotiations for Charles II's conversion to Roman Catholicism. Father Oliva may have been convinced as, following his instructions, on 14 or 15 October 1668 La Cloche began a journey to London, going at least as far as Paris in the company of a Jesuit priest. Whether he reached London is unverified, but he returned to Rome, apparently with another letter from Charles, dated 18 November, which promised a donation and compensation for La Cloche's expenses. 
Tiredness from the journey and the rigours of winter had undermined La Cloche's health. He therefore decided to delay another journey to London and await milder temperatures. Perhaps on the advice of Oliva, he transferred to Naples. Finding accommodation at the home of Francesco Corona, a poor but respectable gentleman, and his wife, Annuccia d'Amicij, Jacques fell hopelessly in love with his hosts' daughter Teresa, and married her in Naples Cathedral on 19 February 1669, styling himself Giacomo Enrico de Boveri Roano Stuardo, not before giving his father-in-law money and jewels in such quantity as to arouse suspicion that he was in reality a counterfeiter. Indeed, in early March, as he himself related in two letters to Cardinal Francesco Barberini dated 6 and 10 April 1669, he was arrested by order of the Spanish viceroy of Naples, Don Pedro of Aragon, and confined in the castle of Sant'Elmo, from where on 20 March he was transferred to the fortress of Gaeta. Among the papers confiscated from him emerged two certificates attesting his royal parentage, one apparently signed by Kristina of Sweden, the other by Father Oliva. In Naples excitement grew about the English prince and the new princess, referred to as La Reginella. The news may have reached England for it seems that Charles II wrote to the viceroy denouncing the prisoner as an impostor. La Cloche was soon released, perhaps through the intervention of the cardinal and Father Oliva. He hoped to take his family to Venice but a violent fever ended his life. He died on 26 August 1669, and was buried in the church of San Francesco di Paola, outside Porta Capuana. In La Cloche's extravagant and pretentious will he named Louis XIV executor, whom he called 'Cousin'. 
On 10 December (or 11 November) 1669 a son, Giacomo, was born posthumously to Jacques de La Cloche and baptized the same day in the parish church of Santa Sofia. Giacomo lived in Naples until 1708, when he left for Rome, where he married D. Lucia Minelli della Riccia. On 4 October 1711, for this marriage, he was arrested as a vagabond and impostor by Pope Clement XI and tried by the Roman court for an entire year, until he was recognized as a genuine descendant of Charles II. In this capacity he was welcomed by numerous Italian and European courts, and he wandered from one to another, begging respect and munificence. He died in Naples in 1752 or 1753. It seems he was survived by a son, Giuseppe (1722-1783), who resided at the court of France, and has been said to have acted as a double for Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, when he was away on secret missions. He was apparently the last of the line.

Lacroix, Alphonse Francois (1799-1859), missionary, was born at Lignieres, in the canton of Neuchatel, Switzerland, on 10 May 1799. His father died between 1799 and 1805, and Lacroix was brought up by an uncle, M. Chanel. He was educated privately and then at a mission seminary in Berkel, near Rotterdam. In 1816 he became a tutor in Amsterdam and there learned of the Tahitians' abandonment of their idols, whereupon he was stirred to offer himself for missionary labour. He arrived in the Dutch colony of Chinsura, Bengal, in March 1821, as the sole Indian representative of the Netherlands Missionary Society. On 17 May 1825 he married Hannah, daughter of Gregorius Herklots (1768-1852), a native of Bremen and fiscal or mayor of Chinsura. 
On 1 March 1827, following Chinsura's transfer from Dutch to English control, Lacroix joined the London Missionary Society (LMS). Two years later he shifted to Calcutta. He was a tall, strikingly handsome man and an animated, expressive talker which, coupled with his fluency in Bengali, ensured him a reputation as an eloquent street-preacher in Calcutta and its surrounding villages and on the swampy islands of the Sundarbans. A persuasive opponent of education and proselytization solely in the English language, Lacroix devoted many hours to revising the existing Bengali translations of the 'Bible' and ran theological classes in Bengali at his home. 
In December 1841 Lacroix travelled with his family to Europe for the first and only time. He toured Britain, France, and Switzerland, and in Geneva he raised considerable funds for itinerant preaching in Bengal. He returned to India in January 1844. In September 1855, as one of the longest-serving and most popular missionaries in Calcutta, he presided over a session of the General Conference of Protestant Missionaries. In 1856 the LMS invited him to retire to England, but he declined the offer. Nevertheless, his health was failing and he died on 8 July 1859 at his home, 55 Upper Circular Road, Calcutta. His interment at the dissenters' burial-ground, also in Circular Road, was attended by almost 1000 mourners of all Christian denominations. 
Lacroix was survived by his wife and several children, including a daughter, Hannah Catherine (1826-1861), who married the LMS missionary Joseph Mullens. In 1862 Mullens published an affectionate memoir of his father-in-law.

Lacy, Edmund (c.1370-1455), bishop of Exeter, was the son of Stephen Lacy of Gloucester and his wife, Sybil; his brother Philip later became an esquire in his household. Edmund Lacy was educated at Oxford, where he is first mentioned as a master of arts in 1391; he had graduated BTh by 1400 and DTh by 1414. He also held a fellowship of University College ('c'.1391-1396), serving as bursar (1396-7) and master (1398-9, and perhaps until 'c'.1401). After ordination as priest about 1399 he soon gained entry to royal service. By November 1400 he had become a king's clerk and began to receive preferment from Henry IV and others, including canonries at Windsor (1401), Hereford (1412), and Lincoln (1414). References to his employment on diplomatic missions, however, result from confusion with John Catterick (died 1419); Lacy made his mark primarily as a theologian and liturgist, and with Henry V rather than his father. On 14 April 1414 Henry V made him dean of the Chapel Royal; he went on the French campaign of 1415 and was present at Agincourt. Election as bishop of Hereford followed, evidently at the king's wish, between 21 January and 17 February 1417, and Lacy was consecrated at Windsor in Henry's presence on 18 April. In 1420 he was translated to the larger and wealthier diocese of Exeter by papal provision dated 3 July. When Henry promoted the reform of the Benedictine order in May 1421, Lacy was one of those who conferred with the order, and he preached before its monks and the king at Westminster. 
After Henry's death in the following year Lacy was one of the late king's executors, but he subsequently centred his activities upon his diocese of Exeter, except for occasional visits to London -- in 1428 he presided in convocation. When, by 1435, he developed a disease of the shin bones which prevented his riding, he was excused attendance at royal councils and parliaments. As long as his health permitted he was active in visiting his diocese (Cornwall as well as Devon), but in 1447 he was obliged to appoint a suffragan on account of his own advanced age and infirmity. Lacy was clearly a conscientious bishop whose diocesan registers for both Hereford and Exeter survive -- that for Exeter contains 874 folios, yet still fails to include all his sealed acts. It contains large numbers of grants of indulgences and licences for chapels. At Exeter Cathedral he increased the stipends of the vicars-choral and choristers at a time of economic hardship by appropriating the tithes of Cornwood, Devon, to their use in 1430-32. He issued indulgences to encourage the completion of the cathedral cloister, and defended the dean and chapter in disputes with the city of Exeter which reached a crisis in the late 1440s. His preferred interests, however, were intellectual and spiritual. He wrote 'De quadruplici sensu Sacre Scripture', now lost, and took a particular interest in music. The John Dunstavylle whom he appointed canon of Hereford Cathedral in 1419 may have been the composer John Dunstaple (died 1453), while at Exeter, Lacy maintained a chapel choir and patronized such musicians as Richard Smert, Nicholas Sturgeon, and John Trouluffe. He had a particular devotion to the Virgin, in whose honour he instituted an antiphon and prayers in the cathedral, and to the Archangel Raphael, patron of healing -- a more unusual attachment, perhaps reflecting his own infirmity. In 1444 the pope approved a liturgy composed by Lacy for a festival of Raphael on 5 October, and the bishop tried to promote the festival, which won acceptance at Exeter, Hereford, and (in 1454) York. He gave Exeter Cathedral numerous vestments, ornaments, and books. 
Lacy lived to be at least eighty, acquiring a reputation for sanctity; in 1447-8 the mayor of Exeter, albeit an opponent, referred to 'his blessedness, holy living and good conscience' ('Letters and Papers of John Shillingford', 44). He died at the bishop's manor of Chudleigh, Devon, on 18 September 1455, and was buried in a plain altar tomb on the north side of the choir in Exeter Cathedral. The tomb became the centre of an unofficial cult, attracting pilgrims and monetary donations. Wax votive offerings found near the tomb in 1942 suggest that the devotees often suffered (like the bishop) from diseases of the limbs; the cult was suppressed about 1538 by the then dean of Exeter, Simon Haynes.

Fanny Cooper (1814-1872), actress, was born in Greenwich, Kent, in 1814, the daughter of William Dalton. She was the leading actress in Mrs Thomas Robertson's company on the Lincoln circuit in 1837 and made her London debut as Lydia in Knowles's 'The Love Chase' at the Haymarket (16 April 1838), when 'The Times' (17 April) was much impressed by her 'chaste quiet piece of performance', 'genuine feeling', and 'desire to give distinctness to the text'. At Drury Lane in the 1839-40 season she acted a repertory of minor parts such as Margaret in Philip Massinger's 'A New Way to Pay Old Debts' and Catherine in Colman's 'The Heir-at-Law'. On 7 September 1840 she joined Madame Vestris's company at Covent Garden, where in November she played Helena in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. Although, according to 'The Times' (17 November 1840), 'her manner was constrained and artificial... there was still evident desire to give the words their meaning [and] that evident knowledge of feeling that the part required'. She revived the role in January and February 1842. Fanny Cooper's marriage to Lacy, which is said to have taken place on 25 January 1842 (in Sheffield or London), has not been traced in the official records. In her first season at Sadler's Wells in 1844, she sometimes performed alongside Lacy, as Countess Wintersen in 'The Stranger', Nerissa in 'The Merchant of Venice', and Virginia in 'Virginius'. Other parts in her repertory included Aspatia in Knowles's 'The Bridal' and Mary in Massinger's 'The City Madam' (1844 season), Margaret Aylmer in G. W. Lovell's 'Love's Sacrifice' (August 1846), and Mildred in a revival of Browning's 'A Blot in the 'Scutcheon' (November 1848). But she maintained her affection for Shakespearian comedy and was occasionally rewarded by important parts such as Rosalind (November 1847) and Olivia (January 1848). In late summer 1850 she left Sadler's Wells, where for four seasons she had been increasingly overshadowed by Laura Addison, for the Surrey Theatre under William Creswick. The move, though short-lived and not entirely successful, enabled her to extend her Shakespearian repertory: Lady Macbeth (September) and Volumnia in 'Coriolanus' (December). Fanny Cooper never quite made the first rank as actress but she was very popular with audiences and was perfectly suited to the ensemble acting for which Sadler's Wells under Phelps became renowned. Phelps re-engaged her for two further seasons from autumn 1853, when she resumed her old role of Helena in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (a performance which left Henry Morley in 'The Examiner' rather unimpressed because she was 'too loud and real') and took on a variety of new ones, including Desdemona (November 1853), Portia, and Thaisa (March and October 1854). She died at her home, 89 Strand, on 21 April 1872. There was an only son, Thomas junior, said to be mentally unstable, who died unmarried in 1895.

Lacy, Francis Anthony, styled Count de Lacy (1731-1792), army officer and diplomatist in the Spanish service, was born in Spain, the second son of Patrick Lacy, an army officer in the Spanish service, and his wife, a daughter of the marquis d'Abbeville (Osly). Lacy's father, from Bruree, co. Limerick, had left Ireland with James II in 1691 and took military service in France and then Spain. 
In 1747 Lacy joined the Spanish army as an ensign with the Irish regiment of Ultonia -- the Lacys' chosen corps of service. The regiment served with the Irish brigade in the campaign in Italy of that year against the Austrians in support of Spanish claims to the crowns of Naples and Sicily and the duchy of Milan. In 1762, aged thirty-one, he was promoted colonel of the regiment, which served with the Irish brigade in the war against Portugal; it captured the frontier fortress of Miranda do Douro and occupied Braganza and Chaves, before retiring across the frontier to Extremadura with the rest of the Spanish army. 
Lacy then turned to diplomacy, and served as the Spanish minister at the courts of Stockholm and St Petersburg. From Russia he wrote a series of reports to the Marquess Grimaldi between 1772 and 1775 concerning the Russian expedition to Kamchatka and drawing attention to Russian interest in the northern coast of California. This led the Spanish government to send a rival expedition to the coast of Kamchatka, to establish relations with local tribes. 
Upon his return Lacy was made commandant-general of the coast of Granada, member of the supreme war council, and inspector-general of artillery and ordnance establishments (1780). He was responsible for improved discipline at the school of artillery in Segovia and for the introduction of classes for chemistry, mineralogy, and pyrotechnics. As lieutenant-general he commanded the artillery at the siege of Minorca in 1781, where the British defenders held out for six months. Thereafter he commanded the Spanish artillery at the unsuccessful siege of Gibraltar, which lasted until 1783. For his services Lacy was granted the grand cross of Charles III and the rank of commander of the cross of St Iago. He was also made titular of the rich commanderie of Las Cazas Buenas, Merida. 
In March 1789 Lacy was appointed governor and captain-general of Catalonia, where he worked hard to prevent the spread of French revolutionary doctrines among the Catalans. He died, unmarried, at Barcelona on 31 December 1792, at the age of sixty-one, and was buried in January 1793 at the parish church of Santa Maria del Mar in the city. His success, according to James Grant, in his book 'Cavaliers of Fortune' (1859), owed less to military talent and more to an imposing stature, a ready wit, and a steadfast loyalty to the court he served. 
Lacy's elder brother, Patrick, who also joined the Ultonia regiment, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, married a lady from Cork, with whom he had three children. Among these was Louis de Lacy (1775-1817), who enjoyed a distinguished military career in Spain under the Bourbons, the Napoleonic regime, and then again the Bourbons, only to be executed for rising in defence of the 1812 constitution.

Lacy, Gilbert de (fl. 1133-1163), baron, was the son of the Roger de Lacy disinherited and banished in 1096. He had succeeded his father on the family's Norman estates of Lassy and Campeaux by 1133. He returned to England and was with King Stephen at Easter 1136, but was disappointed of any hope of recovering those of his father's extensive lands in the Welsh borders which had been given after 1096 to Pain fitz John, Joce de Dinan, and Miles of Gloucester. 
In the civil war Lacy sided with the empress: in 1138 his kinsman Geoffrey Talbot fortified Weobley (one of Lacy's chief castles) unsuccessfully against Stephen; the two then led an army which attacked Bath. He witnessed charters issued by the empress in 1141 and by her son Duke Henry in 1154-5. By 1141 Joce and Miles had deserted Stephen, but there is no evidence that Lacy ever rejoined the king. Instead he profited from the anarchy which prevailed in the southern marches and in the end recovered most of his father's lands. In the late 1140s Miles's son Roger, earl of Hereford, was making alliances against him and in 1150 attacked a party of Lacy's knights in a churchyard. Lacy also fought Joce de Dinan for possession of Ludlow, though the details remembered in the later romance 'Fouke le Fitz Waryn' are unhistorical. He was well known as an able and wily commander. He gave churches at Weobley and Clodock (near his seat of Ewyas Lacy) to the family monastery of Llanthony, the manor of Guiting to the knights templar, and land to Hereford Cathedral. 
In 1158 or 1159 Lacy resigned his lands to his eldest son, Robert (who was himself succeeded by his brother Hugh de Lacy in 1162), and joined the templars. At Whitsuntide 1160 he was in France with the templars who guaranteed the peace treaty between Henry II and Louis VII. Later in 1160 or 1161 he had reached Jerusalem and he became preceptor of his order in the county of Tripoli, where in 1163 he was among the leaders of a crusader army resisting Nur-ad-Din. The year of his death is unknown, though the date of 10 November was later commemorated at Hereford.

Lacy, Harriett Deborah (1807-1874), actress, the daughter of William Taylor, a wine merchant, was born in London. With her parents' agreement she was given lessons in elocution by the actress Sarah Bartley. She made her debut as Julia in 'The Rivals' under the management of Bellamy at the Bath theatre on 5 November 1827. She was almost instantly popular and in the course of the next two seasons played important roles there. Her first appearance in London was at Covent Garden, where, on 30 October 1830, she played Nina in Dimond's 'Carnival of Naples', earning a very positive review from the 'Theatrical Journal'. Subsequent parts included Rosalind and -- much to his pleasure -- Helen to Sheridan Knowles's Hunchback in his play of that name. In 1837 she was Aspatia to W. C. Macready's Melantius and Miss Huddart's Evadne in 'The Bridal' under Benjamin Webster's management at the Haymarket, where she earned a reputation for playing with distinction in sentimental comedy. The following year she joined the company with which Macready began his management of Covent Garden. There, in August 1838, she played Lady Teazle to the Surface of Walter Lacy (1809-1898), whose real name was Walter Williams. She married him on 22 June 1839. For the last part of her career she performed various roles, including some of Madame Vestris's repertory. Among her best parts were Nell Gwynne in Jerrold's play of that name, in which the song 'Buy my oranges' was heard, the original heroine in the same writer's 'The Housekeeper', and Ophelia, a part in which, according to Madame Vestris, she surpassed any actress of her time. She retired from the stage about 1845, having made her farewell appearance at the Olympic, and died on 28 July 1874 at her home in Montpelier Square, Brompton, London.

Lacy, Henry de, fifth earl of Lincoln (1249-1311), magnate, was born in December (perhaps on the 19th) 1249, the son of Edmund de Lacy, earl of Lincoln (1230-1258), and Alice (died in or before 1311), elder daughter of Manfred (III), marquess of Saluzzo. 
Henry de Lacy succeeded his father at the age of eight and a half in 1258, his mother receiving custody of her late husband's lands and heirs until Henry reached legal age. The king granted $300 per annum for his maintenance during his minority. In 1269 he was involved in a quarrel with John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (died 1304), as to certain pastureland, which was decided in his favour. On 5 April 1272 he was made keeper of Knaresborough Castle, and on 13 October of that year he was knighted on the occasion of the wedding of Edmund, earl of Cornwall. He appears to have taken seisin of his lands and titles at about this time, and from soon thereafter he was to be found in near constant royal service, proving himself to be one of Edward I's most reliable, faithful, and trusted servants and friends. In 1276 and 1277 he served in the Welsh war with a force of about 100 cavalry, and took Bauseley in Montgomeryshire. In January 1278 he went to Brabant to arrange the future marriage of the king's daughter Margaret to John, son and heir of the duke of Brabant, and in March of that year he was one of the escort appointed to attend Alexander III, king of Scots, on his visit to England. On 27 April 1279 he was appointed joint lieutenant of England along with the bishops of Worcester and Hereford and the earl of Cornwall, during the king's absence in France, which lasted until 19 June. In 1282 and 1283 he was again in Wales, and received substantial grants in the north from the king, forming the great lordship of Denbigh. In 1284 when Edward I celebrated the conquest of Wales with a round table, Lincoln captained one side of the tournament that ensued. 
Lincoln accompanied the king on his three years' visit to Gascony, from 1286 to 1289. In 1287 he served as one of the commissioners who tried and convicted the former seneschal of Gascony, Jean de Grailly, for misconduct while in office. One of the 'bastides' built by the king during this period, Nichole, bears his name. Following the king's return from Gascony, Lincoln was appointed in October 1289 to a commission charged to hear complaints against royal officials. About 1000 defendants were named, most notably Ralph Hengham, chief justice of the king's bench. Lincoln was also one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the guardians of Scotland in June 1290, and in this capacity was present at the negotiations that produced the treaty of Birgham on 18 July. He was also present at Norham in 1291 and at Berwick in 1292 during the deliberations relative to the Scottish succession, and in the latter year was one of those appointed to decide on the claims of William de Ros and John de Vaux. In 1292 Lincoln was one of the sureties for Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, in his dispute with the earl of Hereford over territories in the Welsh march, and he also served as one of the co-executors of Eleanor of Castile following her death. In May 1293 Lincoln accompanied Edmund, earl of Lancaster, on an embassy to arrange a truce with France. In the following year he set out for Gascony, but while still at Portsmouth was recalled by the outbreak of war in Wales. While proceeding to relieve his castle of Denbigh he was defeated by his own Welshmen on 11 November; Lincoln himself escaped without difficulty, and remained in Wales until the spring of 1295. 
On 3 December 1295 Lincoln was appointed king's lieutenant in Aquitaine, a position he held until the spring of 1298. On 14 January 1296 he sailed from Plymouth with Edmund of Lancaster, on his way to Gascony with a very large force of infantry. Lincoln served the king under contract, being paid 2000 marks per annum. After pillaging St Matthieu, near Cape Finisterre, his force sailed up the Gironde to Bourg and Blaye. They marched against Bordeaux without success. An attack on St Macaire failed when Robert, count of Artois, relieved the besieged French garrison. On the death of Edmund of Lancaster, on 5 June, Lincoln was chosen to succeed him by the voice of the whole army and his appointment as lieutenant was renewed. He defeated the count of Artois before Bourg-sur-Mer, and besieged Dax for seven weeks in July and August with great vigour, but was at length forced to retire to Bayonne. In January 1297 the citizens of Bellegarde, who were besieged by the French, appealed for assistance. Lincoln marched out to their aid, but was ambushed by Artois. John de St John was taken prisoner, and heavy casualties were sustained, while the English were forced to retreat once more to Bayonne. However, in the summer Lincoln made a successful raid towards Toulouse, which lasted until Michaelmas. He then went back to Bayonne where he remained until after Christmas, and about Easter 1298 he returned to England. He had been replaced as king's lieutenant in Aquitaine by Guy Ferre by 25 April 1298. 
On 15 May 1298 Lincoln was appointed to arrange the marriage between Edward, prince of Wales, and Isabella of France. He was one of the nobles who swore to the earls of Hereford and Norfolk on the king's behalf that Edward I, would reconfirm the charters on his return from the Scottish war, and then accompanied Edward to Scotland, where he was present at the battle of Falkirk on 22 July. He was rewarded with the position and lands of James, the steward of Scotland, which included the barony of Renfrew. In July 1299 he was summoned to attend the council at York on the affairs of Scotland. On 12 September 1299 Lincoln was present at the marriage of Edward I to Margaret of France in Canterbury, where the king turned to him to resolve a dispute over who should receive the cloths used as a canopy over the heads of the royal couple. In 1300 he was again in Scotland, and present at the siege of Caerlaverock in July, when he commanded the first division. In November 1300 he was sent with the elder Hugh Despenser on a mission to the pope in Rome to complain of the injury done by the Scots, having also been entrusted with a mission to the king of France on 14 October. 
In March 1301 Lincoln was directed to attend the prince of Wales in person on his invasion of Scotland at midsummer, and during September and October he was engaged in Galloway. During the next two years he was constantly employed in the negotiations with the French king that resulted in the treaty of Montreuil on 20 May 1303. In June of that year he went to Aquitaine in the company of Otto de Grandson and Amadeus, count of Savoy, to take seisin of the duchy in Edward's name and proceed with its reorganization; he remained there for the following year. On 16 September 1305 he was one of the commissioners appointed in the parliament at Westminster to arrange the affairs of Scotland, and in the same parliament was a receiver and trier of petitions from Gascony. On 15 October he was sent along with Grandson and Walter Langton on an embassy to Pope Clement V which resulted in the suspension of Archbishop Winchelsey from office. He returned to London on 16 February 1306, and was publicly received by the mayor. Later in the year he went to Scotland with the prince of Wales, who was ordered to act by his advice. In January 1307 he was one of the commissioners appointed to hold a parliament at Carlisle. In the summer he accompanied Edward on his advance towards Scotland, and was present at the king's death on 7 July, even though on the following day he was one of three individuals, the other two being the queen and the prince of Wales, to whom letters were drafted by the household, presumably notices of the king's passing. 
At the death of Edward I, Lincoln was without question the most senior of the English earls, and he remained extremely influential until his death in 1311. He attended Edward II into Scotland in 1307, and along with six other earls gave his assent to the creation of Piers Gaveston as earl of Cornwall in August. Indeed, the author of the 'Vita Edwardi secundi' reports that it was Lincoln who confirmed that the king could lawfully alienate the earldom of Cornwall, saying it had been done twice before by other kings. The same writer goes on to say that after the king, Lincoln was Gaveston's chief supporter, but that through the favourite's ingratitude he came to be the chief of his enemies. Whatever the cause, by January 1308 Lincoln was associated with the rising baronial discontent. He not only witnessed the so-called 'Boulogne declaration' of that month that anticipated the parliament of April 1308 in drawing a distinction between the loyalty due to the crown and that due to the person of the king; he very likely played a major role in shaping this position. Nevertheless, following Gaveston's exile Lincoln quickly returned to the king's inner circle. During the second year of the reign he appears as a witness in the charter rolls no fewer than thirty times, including two occasions on which grants were made to Gaveston in June 1309. All too soon, however, he was alienated from the king and favourite, the latter having bestowed the nickname 'Burst-Belly' ('Boele-Crevee') on him. 
The insolence of the favourite, coupled with the king's perceived abuse of patronage, led Lincoln to join with his son-in-law, Thomas of Lancaster, and other discontented magnates in calling for reform of the royal household and government. Lincoln was one of the petitioners who demanded the reforming ordinances, and was himself one of the Lords ordainer. Although it does not appear that he played a major role in the drafting of the ordinances, he was supportive of their programme. When Edward II ordered the removal of the exchequer and both benches to York in October 1310, Lincoln threatened to resign his position as keeper of the realm. Edward relented, and the two were reconciled. Lincoln spent Christmas 1310 at Kingston in Dorset, and soon afterwards returned to London, where he died at his house in Holborn on 5 February 1311. He was buried in the lady chapel of St Paul's Cathedral on 28 February. His death had a destabilizing effect on the king's already strained relations with his magnates, and particularly with Thomas of Lancaster, whose wealth and power were greatly increased by his succession to the Lacy inheritance. 
Henry de Lacy married twice. His first wife was Margaret, daughter and coheir of William (II) Longespee (d. 1250), a union that had been arranged as early as 1256, and which brought Lacy the earldom of Salisbury; they were married in 1257. His two sons, Edmund and John, predeceased him, and on 28 October 1294, presumably under pressure of some kind from Edward I, Lincoln and his wife made a settlement of their estates which, while reserving a life interest for themselves, entailed most of them on their son-in-law, Thomas of Lancaster, who had just married their daughter, Alice, and on Thomas's father, the king's brother Edmund, earl of Lancaster. The settlement was such as to ruin the expectations of any collateral heirs Alice might have, to the ultimate advantage of the house of Lancaster. Margaret died in 1309, and by 16 June 1310 Lincoln had married Joan, daughter of William, Lord Martin, and his wife, Eleanor Fitzpiers. Following Lincoln's death, and before 6 June 1313, Joan married, without royal licence, Nicholas, Lord Audley; she died shortly before 27 October 1322. The properties that his marriage brought to Thomas of Lancaster stretched virtually across the whole kingdom, with particularly large concentrations in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and what is now Denbighshire in Wales. Lincoln's revenues from his estates have been estimated at 10,000 marks per annum. It is difficult to assess the extent of his personal involvement in the network of receiverships, treasuries, and audits revealed by the surviving accounts, but given his reputation for integrity and responsibility it seems unlikely that he had no involvement in the direction of a household that has been described as 'a model of economy and practical efficiency' (Baldwin, 189). Lincoln also appears to have been a literate and cultivated man. He commissioned an abridgement of the 'Brut' chronicle, the so-called 'Petit Bruit' (BL, Harley MS 907), and in his early days appeared in a short poem by Walter of Bibbesworth, datable to 'c'.1270, in which Walter tries to persuade the earl, who has taken the cross but is now trying to escape his obligations because of his love for a lady, to fulfil his crusading vow. It was with justice that Henry de Lacy, both then and later, was perceived as one of the foremost English magnates of his time.

Lacy, Hugh de (d. 1186), magnate, was the son of an unknown mother and of Gilbert de Lacy (fl. 1133-1163). In 1158 or 1159 Gilbert became a knight templar and by 1159-60 had been succeeded as lord of Weobley, Herefordshire (one of the family's chief castles), by his son Robert. By 1162 Robert, in turn, had been succeeded by Hugh, presumably his younger brother. Hugh de Lacy thus became an important tenant-in-chief of the crown. He held fees hereditarily in Normandy at Lassy and Campeaux; additionally about 1172-3 he obtained by purchase of 200 livres angevins the honour of Le Pin from Robert, count of Meulan, to be held of Henry II for 2 knights' fees. In 1166 he made a return to the king stating that in England he had 541/4 fees of old feoffment, of which, however, 31/2 fees were not acknowledged as his by their holders; he also had 51/2 fees of new feoffment, land worth 800's'., and 9 resident knights maintained in his household. In 1167/8 scutage was calculated on 511/4 knights' fees, indicating that Lacy had not recovered the contested fees. Lacy did not pay scutage in 1164/5, suggesting that he participated in person in Henry II's campaign from Shrewsbury into north Wales in 1165. 
Lacy accompanied Henry II to Ireland in October 1171. Gerald of Wales certainly exaggerated, if he did not entirely invent, a meeting at the River Shannon between Lacy, William fitz Aldelin, and Ruaidri Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht and claimant to the high-kingship, at which the latter supposedly offered submission to Henry II. Hugh de Lacy had definitely attained a prominent position in the king's entourage. Before Henry left Ireland in April 1172 he granted Lacy the kingdom of Mide for the service of 50 knights, as well as custody of the city of Dublin which the king retained as royal demesne. The terms suggest the king's determination that tenure of the Irish lordships should be more strictly controlled than that of the semi-autonomous Welsh marcher domains. Such had been the confusion over the kingship of Mide in the previous twenty years that Henry specifically granted the kingdom 'as it had been held by Murchad Ua Mael Sechlainn' (Orpen, 1.285-6), who had died in 1153. One Irish contender for the lordship of Mide, Tigernan Ua Ruairc, king of Breifne, had made such inroads into Mide in the immediate pre-Norman period that he is actually termed 'king of Mide' by Gerald ('Expugnatio', 95, 113). Lacy assassinated Ua Ruairc at the hill of Tlachtga (Ward, Meath) in 1172 while negotiations between the two were in progress. 
Lacy was back in England by 29 December 1172, the anniversary of the death of Archbishop Thomas Becket, when he was at Canterbury, probably 'en route' for Normandy. In the summer of 1173 he fought on Henry II's behalf in Normandy and in July held the castle of Verneuil against Louis VII of France, although eventually it was forced to capitulate. Lacy can be traced intermittently in Henry's entourage up to 1177. In May 1177 he was present at the Council of Oxford, when arrangements were made for the administration of the Angevin lordship in Ireland following the death in April 1176 of Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare (Strongbow), earl of Pembroke and Striguil and lord of Leinster. According to Gerald of Wales, Lacy was appointed as the king's 'procurator generalis' in Ireland ('Expugnatio', 183), but the diplomatic of royal records indicates that it was William fitz Aldelin who exercised the role of principal royal agent in Ireland at this time. The king may have considered that his bond with William fitz Aldelin, a long-standing administrator and member of the royal 'familia', was more dependable than his personal relationship with Lacy as a tenurial vassal. Few such administrators were available to Henry in Ireland, however, and in 1177 Lacy retained custody of the royal demesne of Dublin. Extant documents testify to his administrative role. In 1176/7 the sheriff of Shropshire accounted for 200 bushels of wheat sent to Lacy in Ireland; in 1177/8 he received 200 bushels from Dorset and Somerset and 300 from Gloucestershire, while 500 bushels were shipped with his servants in 1178/9 for the use of the king's 'familia' in Ireland. None the less, Henry II evidently remained wary of Lacy's intentions, and in the summer of 1177 took into his hand Lacy's demesne castle of Ludlow, which he retained for the remainder of Lacy's life: this would have had the effect of weakening Lacy power in the central Welsh march and may therefore have been intended as a mechanism of royal control in case Hugh de Lacy overstepped his position in Ireland. 
The so-called 'Song of Dermot and the Earl' gives an account of Hugh de Lacy's subinfeudation of Mide. The details of the process are obscure as only three charter-texts of enfeoffment survive. Settlement seems to have proceeded on the basis of pre-existing units -- the charters give the Irish names of the lands and their previous holders -- which were now held by knights' service, orientated towards a castle. The precise number of castles that Lacy built in Mide is unknown. His castle at Trim was to become the 'caput' of the Anglo-Norman lordship of Mide. Some of his castles reused royal sites of the pre-Norman kingdom of Mide. Gerald of Wales praised Lacy in contrast to William fitz Aldelin, for fortifying Leinster and Mide with castles and pacifying Ireland. Lacy also dispensed religious patronage from his new lordship. He endowed Llanthony Prima, in Gwent, and Llanthony Secunda, in Gloucestershire, with extensive ecclesiastical benefices and lands in Mide, founding a cell of Llanthony Prima at Colp and a cell of Llanthony Secunda at Duleek. He founded a Benedictine alien priory at Fore, Westmeath, as a dependency of St Taurin, Evreux, and was a benefactor of St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin, the Augustinian priory of Kells, Meath, and the archbishopric of Dublin. 
Some of Lacy's activities did nothing to lessen the king's suspicion of him. In 1178 he reached an accommodation with Ruaidri Ua Conchobair, who had repulsed him after he had plundered the ecclesiastical site of Clonmacnoise, co. Offaly, with the Dublin garrison. Without Henry II's permission, Lacy married Ua Conchobair's daughter around this time, which apparently displeased Henry, and may have led to Lacy's recall to England in 1179 and again in 1181. In late 1181 or 1182, however, Lacy returned to Ireland, this time as the king's principal agent, though a royal clerk, Robert of Shrewsbury, was to oversee his actions. In September 1184 he was recalled again and replaced by a royal 'familiaris', Philip of Worcester, one of whose first actions was to seek the recovery of Saithne, in the north of the county of Dublin, which Hugh de Lacy was deemed to have misappropriated from the royal demesne of Dublin. When Henry II's son John went to assume the lordship of Ireland in person in 1185, he is said by the annals of Loch Ce to have reported back to Henry that Lacy had prevented the Irish kings from giving him tribute or hostages. 
Hugh de Lacy was assassinated at Durrow on 26 July 1186. He was beheaded with an axe by Gillaganinathair O Miadaig of Bregmuine at the direction of In Sinnach Ua Ceithernaig, king of Tethba, perhaps to avenge the killing of the latter's son in battle against the Anglo-Normans eight years earlier. The annals of Loch Ce describe Lacy at the time of his death as 'king of Mide and Breifne, and Airgialla', and further state that 'it was to him that the tribute of Connacht was paid' ('Annals of Loch Ce', 1.173). Roger of Howden and William of Newburgh claim that news of Lacy's death was welcomed by Henry II, while Newburgh adds that the king intended to send John back to Ireland to seize Lacy's lands and castles. Lacy was buried at Durrow in 1186. His honour of Weobley was in the hands of the crown until his son and heir, Walter de Lacy (d. 1241), came of age in 1189. In 1195, in moves probably linked to the assumption of the lordship of Mide by Walter, Hugh de Lacy's body was recovered at the instigation of Muirges Ua hEnna, archbishop of Cashel and papal legate, and John Cumin, archbishop of Dublin, and removed to Bective Abbey, Meath, while his head was buried at St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin. Further controversy over his remains ended in 1205 with a papal judgment in favour of removal of the body to St Thomas's, where it was buried alongside that of his first wife, Rose, widow of Baderon of Monmouth (died 1170x76), and mother of his sons, Walter, Hugh de Lacy (d. 1242), Gilbert, and Robert. Rose died some time before 1180, by when Lacy had taken as his second wife the daughter of Ruaidri Ua Conchobair, the elder, with whom he had a son, William Gorm, deemed to be illegitimate, who was to act in close concert with his half-brothers.

Lacy, Hugh de, earl of Ulster (d. 1242), magnate and soldier, was the son of Hugh de Lacy (d. 1186) and his first wife, Rose of Monmouth, and younger brother of Walter de Lacy (died 1241), lord of Meath. Hugh was a minor on his father's death, but had reached his majority by 1195 when he and John de Courcy led an army to Athlone and negotiated a treaty with Cathal Crobderg O Conchobair, king of Connacht. At about this time he was also the recipient of a speculative grant from William de Burgh of ten cantreds in Connacht, a grant confirmed by John, count of Mortain. From his brother Walter he received in Meath the barony of Ratoath and land in Morgallion, and by his marriage, some time between 1194 and 1199, to Lesceline de Verdon, daughter of Bertram de Verdon (died 1192) and sister of Thomas and Nicholas de Verdon, he acquired the Cooley peninsula, Louth, and land north of Dundalk. In 1201 Lacy and Courcy supported an attempt by Cathal Crobderg to regain the kingship of Connacht from his great-nephew Cathal Carrach O Conchobair, but they were heavily defeated. Lacy then arrested Courcy and Cathal Crobderg but released them soon after. King John had grown suspicious of Courcy and used Lacy against him. In 1203 Lacy defeated Courcy at Down and in the following year captured and released him again. In November 1204 Hugh and Walter de Lacy were granted eight cantreds in Ulster and on 29 May 1205 Hugh was granted all Ulster as earl to hold as Courcy had held it on the day he was captured by Lacy. 
In 1206 Lacy plundered Armagh, causing the archbishop of Armagh, Echdonn Mac Gilla Uidhir, to travel to England to complain to the king. In 1208 he attacked the Meath lands of the justiciar, Meiler fitz Henry, and captured his castle of Ardnurcher in Westmeath. This was done in support of William (I) Marshal whose position in Ireland was being undermined by King John. At the same time John had begun to persecute his former friend William (III) de Briouze who had quarrelled with the king over the murder of Arthur of Brittany. Briouze held land in Limerick and his daughter was married to Walter de Lacy. John hounded him for money owed to the crown and in 1209 he and his family fled to Ireland. Briouze returned to Wales the same year but his family were sheltered by Hugh de Lacy. In 1210 John arrived in Ireland to crush his opponents there. As Lacy moved north into Ulster he ravaged north Louth, thereby revenging himself on his brother-in-law, Nicholas de Verdon, who had objected to the marriage portion assigned to Lacy and attempted to claw some of it back. Lacy was chased from Ulster and fled to Scotland, where he spent a short time at St Andrews. Either before his expulsion or following his restoration in 1227 he granted the church of Carlingford in Louth to St Andrews. He and Walter de Lacy appear to have travelled to France and may have sheltered among the monks of St Taurin in Evreux. Hugh de Lacy later participated in the Albigensian crusade, being present at the siege of Toulouse in 1216 and the death of Simon de Montfort on 25 June 1218. 
Negotiations for Lacy's restoration were already underway by the time of John's death. Soon after the coronation of Henry III in 1216 he was given safe conduct to meet the Marshal, and this was repeated in February 1217. Lacy, however, appears to have remained in France until 1219. The death of the Marshal in that year and the rise to power of Hubert de Burgh signalled a less sympathetic approach by the government. In 1220 Lacy responded by joining Llywelyn ab Iorwerth of Gwynedd in attacking the lands of William (II) Marshal in Wales. Attempts were again made to reach a compromise with a safe conduct being issued to Lacy to travel to England in 1221. He seems to have been confident of success at this point and in 1222 used the title earl of Ulster when witnessing a grant by Ranulf (III), earl of Chester, whose nephew and eventual successor, John the Scot, was married to Llywelyn's daughter Helen. 
In December 1222 Lacy was offered his land in Meath and his wife's land in Louth, but he demanded the return of Ulster. The king offered to place it instead in the custody of the earls of Chester, Salisbury, and Gloucester and Walter de Lacy for five years, but in the summer of 1223 these lords refused to accept it. By this time Lacy was preparing to invade Ireland and the king sent letters from the pope to the archbishop of Dublin excommunicating anyone who aided him. Henry III's sister, Joan, the wife of Alexander II, king of Scotland, wrote to her brother to inform him that Alexander would not aid Lacy but that the king of Norway might do so. Lacy was involved in supporting one candidate for the kingship of Man and the Isles, Olaf, against the incumbent ruler, his brother Ragnvald. In 1224 the kingdom was divided between them with Ragnvald keeping Man and some of the isles and Olaf taking the rest. The latter subsequently supported Lacy's invasion of Ireland. 
Lacy arrived in Ireland late in 1223 and went to Meath where he joined his half-brother, William Gorm de Lacy, in plundering his enemies. On 19 June 1224 the new justiciar, William (II) Marshal, arrived in Ireland and with the support of Walter de Lacy besieged Trim Castle which had been taken by adherents of Hugh. Marshal sent his cousin William le Gros with a force to relieve Carrickfergus Castle in Ulster which was being besieged by Hugh. Trim was taken and Hugh de Lacy abandoned the siege of Carrickfergus and joined his ally Aed Meith O Neill, king of Tir Eoghain, in destroying the castle of Coleraine which had been built by Thomas of Galloway after Lacy's expulsion in 1210. He and Aed then turned south and harried the Verdon lands around Dundalk. A large force under William Marshal met them at the Ulster passes in October and Lacy surrendered. His captivity, however, seems not to have been onerous. About May 1225 he was granted 200 marks by the king at the instance of Marshal and in May of the following year all his lands were placed in the custody of Walter de Lacy, with Marshal acting as guarantor. Finally in April 1227 Ulster was restored to Hugh as earl, with the proviso that it would return to the crown in the absence of a male heir. 
The lands of the Galloway lords Alan and Thomas were also excluded from the grant to Hugh de Lacy, but he continued to undermine their position. In 1228 he rebuilt Coleraine Castle for himself. In 1229 his daughter married Alan of Galloway but the Scottish lord did not recover his interests in Ulster. When Alan died in 1234 he left three daughters and an illegitimate son, Thomas. Alexander II was determined that Galloway would be divided between the daughters, but in 1236 an unsuccessful invasion was launched from Ulster by Thomas, with Lacy's support. As part of his attempts to neutralize Galloway involvement in Ulster, Lacy also introduced into the earldom the family of Bisset of Moray, some of whose members murdered Patrick the son of Thomas, earl of Atholl, Alan of Galloway's brother, in 1242. 
In 1230 Lacy's ally and client Aed Meith O Neill died and in the ensuing succession contest Lacy supported not Aed's son Domnall but his rival Domnall Mac Lochlainn. In 1234-5 Mac Lochlainn killed O Neill but soon turned against the earl. In 1238 the Irish of Ulaid (Antrim and Down) revolted against Lacy and appealed to Mac Lochlainn for help. Lacy was expelled but returned the following autumn with the justiciar Maurice Fitzgerald (died 1257). Domnall was banished to Connacht and Brian O Neill, a nephew of Aed Meith, was set up in his place. Mac Lochlainn regained power in 1239 but in 1241 he and his family were finally destroyed by O Neill. 
In 1228 Hugh de Lacy was summoned by the king to fight in France and in 1234 he demonstrated his loyalty to Henry III by participating in the murder of Richard Marshal on the Curragh. Considering the favour shown to Lacy by both Richard's older brother and father this was a particularly unpleasant incident in the earl's career. In the following year he was involved in the conquest of Connacht by Richard de Burgh. His reward was the revival of the grant made to him almost forty years earlier by Richard's father William. He was granted five cantreds in Sligo for the service of ten knights. Apart from founding the manor of Meelick, Lacy did not involve himself personally in Connacht and granted most of his lands there to others such as Maurice Fitzgerald, Jordan of Exeter, Gerald de Prendergast, Peter of Birmingham, and Miles de Nangle. In 1235 he also reached agreement with Roesia de Verdon, daughter of Nicholas de Verdon and niece of his wife, Lesceline, about the half of the Verdon lands he had acquired by his marriage. For a payment of $200 these were returned to Roesia on condition that the men enfeoffed there by Lacy remained undisturbed. In 1237 Lacy opposed the piratical attacks of the Mariscos in the Irish Sea and arrested Scottish merchants then in Ulster. His rehabilitation into royal favour was shown by two summonses he received to give counsel to the king in 1234 and 1237. 
Hugh de Lacy died shortly before 26 December 1242 in Ulster. It is possible but not certain that he was buried at the Franciscan house in Carrickfergus, which he may have founded. He certainly founded the Franciscan house at Down in 1240. He had no surviving sons and his lands reverted to the crown. He married twice. With his first wife, Lesceline de Verdon, he had at least two sons and at least three daughters. His sons Walter and Roger were alive in 1226, but both predeceased him. One of them, or possibly another son, was killed fighting Mac Lochlainn in 1238. Of the daughters of Lacy and Lesceline one, Matilda, married David, baron of Naas, and brought as her marriage portion Lesceline's lands around Carlingford as well as Lacy's lands in Meath and Limerick. She died at a great age in 1281. Another daughter married Miles de Nangle and on her death in 1253 was buried at Boyle Abbey. A third daughter, Rose, married Alan of Galloway and was still alive in 1237. Lacy's second wife was Emeline, daughter of Walter of Ridelisford, with whom he had no children. Shortly after Lacy's death she married Stephen Longespee, a kinsman of Henry III, bringing with her as dower Lacy's Connacht manor of Meelick.

John (d. 1190), soldier and landowner, was the son of Richard fitz Eustace (died 1163) and Albreda (or Aubrey) de Lisours (died 1194). Albreda was a daughter and heir of Robert de Lacy (died 1193). Although the two families' interests intertwined, it is inaccurate to use the Lacy surname of John: as a frequent and prominent witness to the charters of the earls of Chester he appears consistently as 'John the constable of Chester'. John served in this capacity -- the chief official of the earls of Chester -- from 1163, first under Earl Hugh (died 1181), and then under Earl Ranulf (III) (died 1232). He was preceded in this position first by his grandfather Eustace fitz John, lord of Knaresborough and Halton (who was killed in July 1157 in a Welsh ambush at Counsylth near Basingwerk, Flintshire, during Henry II's campaign against Owain Gwynedd), and then by his father. John married Alice, daughter of Robert of Essex and his wife, Alice. His younger brother Robert fitz Richard became prior of the hospitallers in England. 
In 1166 John paid a fine of 1000 marks to have his mother's estates. Some time after 1172 he founded the Cistercian abbey of Stanlaw in Cheshire and the hospital at Castle Donington. Earl Hugh granted him lands in Antrobus in Cheshire and 'c'.1178 confirmed John's grant of Stanney to Stanlaw Abbey. Soon thereafter the earl freed the monks of Stanlaw from paying tolls in Chester. During the rebellion against Henry II in 1173 John was a firm supporter of the king. In early May 1181, when Hugh de Lacy lost royal favour and was recalled from his post as justiciar in Ireland, John and Richard Peche, the bishop of Coventry, and an itinerant justice, were sent to command Dublin in his stead. However, before Hugh departed they joined him in building numerous castles in Leinster. John and Richard were recalled to England during the following winter when Hugh de Lacy returned. John was present at the coronation of King Richard on 3 September 1189 and departed England in March 1190 to participate in the third crusade. His death later that year at the siege of Acre probably occurred on 11 October. 
After his death John was succeeded as constable by his eldest son, Roger de Lacy (d. 1211), who adopted the surname Lacy when he inherited his grandmother Albreda's estates at Clitheroe and Pontefract after her death in 1194. John's other children included Richard of Chester, who contracted leprosy and was buried at Norton Priory; a son Geoffrey; and another son Eustace of Chester, who may have been illegitimate. John the constable's descendants became earls of Lincoln in the thirteenth century.

Lacy, John de, third earl of Lincoln (c.1192-1240), magnate, was the eldest son and heir of Roger de Lacy, constable of Chester (died 1211), and his wife, Maud or Matilda de Clere, erroneously identified as Matilda de Clare in a fifteenth-century chronicle. Since he was almost certainly a minor at the time of his father's death, and did not obtain possession of his lands until September 1213, John appears to have been born 'c'.1192. His early years are obscure. The only possible reference to him before 1213 occurs in a letter of Philip Augustus, king of France, responding to an offer by a John de Lacy made in 1209 or early 1210 to foment rebellion in England and Ireland. This may, however, refer not to the seventeen-year-old John, but to the Anglo-Irish baron Walter de Lacy. 
In September 1213 John de Lacy obtained possession of his father's extensive estate, comprising more than 100 knights' fees together with the northern baronies of Pontefract, Clitheroe, Penwortham, Widnes, and Halton, held by descent in the female line from the Lacy lords of Pontefract, and in the line of direct male descent as heir to the lands and office of the constables of Chester. In return for his lands he was forced to offer a massive fine of 7000 marks repayable over the coming three years, in the meantime surrendering his chief castles of Pontefract in Yorkshire and Donington in Leicestershire, to be garrisoned by the king at Lacy's expense, on pain of confiscation should Lacy rebel. In 1214 he accompanied the king to Poitou, being restored to possession of Castle Donington in July in return for the surrender of hostages including his younger brother. He was still at court on 4 March 1215, when he took the cross at the same time as King John. On the following day he was pardoned the 4200 marks still owing from his fine of 1213. 
As late as 31 May 1215 Lacy was assumed to be loyal. However, with the fall of London he threw in his lot with the rebels, being named at Runnymede in June 1215 as one of the baronial council of twenty-five, and being entrusted with command of the rebel forces in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire ['see also 'Enforcers of Magna Carta]. Thereafter he veered opportunistically between the rebel and royalist camps. On 1 January 1216, perhaps in light of the king's capture of Castle Donington, he sought terms with John, once again surrendering his brother as hostage and repudiating all the terms of the settlement embodied in 'Magna Carta'. In April he was restored to possession of the manor of Lytham in Oxfordshire, detached from the Lacy barony of Pontefract for much of the previous century. In May he was in Kent with the king, but he had rebelled again before John's death in October. Thereafter, with the defeat of the rebel army at Lincoln, he once again returned to the royalist camp, being readmitted to fealty in August 1217. In the following month he was commanded to oversee the restoration of Carlisle Castle by the king of Scots. However, his thoughts now turned to the crusade, and in May 1218, in company with his chief lord, Ranulf (III), earl of Chester, he embarked for Damietta. 
John de Lacy's activities in the East are unrecorded, save for an award he made at Damietta for the establishment of a chapel at Pontefract in honour of the holy sepulchre and the holy cross. He did not return to England until August 1220, still following in the train of the earl of Chester. Thereafter his fortunes were linked closely to those of the earl, an alliance cemented in 1221 by his marriage to Ranulf (III)'s niece. In February 1221, during the rebellion of the earl of Aumale, Lacy was commanded to assist in the siege of Skipton Castle, and in the following year he was appointed to forest inquiries in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. In the winter of 1223-4, together with the earl of Chester, he was among the leaders of the opposition to the justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, but made his peace with the king, attending the siege of Bedford in 1224, witnessing the reissue of 'Magna Carta' in 1225, and assisting in the collection of the tax bestowed in return for the charter's reissue. In 1226 he was appointed a justice on eyre in Lincolnshire and Lancashire. 
In 1227 Lacy served as one of the royal envoys to Antwerp in negotiations with the German princes, and in 1230 accompanied the king's expedition to Brittany and Poitou, receiving the manors of Collingham in Yorkshire and Bardsey in Lincolnshire in reward for his service. After August 1230 he helped to negotiate an Anglo-French truce. During the political crisis of 1232 he once again sided with the earl of Chester against Hubert de Burgh, in October being appointed to inquire into Hubert's escape from sanctuary and thereafter supplying one of the four knights appointed to serve as Hubert's gaolers at Devizes Castle. However, his adherence to the new regime headed by Peter des Roches was no more than half-hearted, and sprang principally from his desire to obtain royal favour at a crucial moment in his own affairs. Following the death of Ranulf of Chester on 26 October 1232, Lacy was permitted to benefit from an arrangement agreed before Ranulf's death, whereby Ranulf's title as earl of Lincoln was conveyed to Hawise, Ranulf's sister, and thence to John as Hawise's son-in-law. On 22 November 1232 John was granted the third penny of the county of Lincolnshire, and was thus created an earl. Although Ranulf's principal Lincolnshire barony of Bolingbroke was retained by Hawise (died 1243), John acquired other portions of the Chester estate, including a share in the manor of Leeds, from John the Scot, Ranulf's successor as earl of Chester. 
In autumn 1233 Lacy helped to defend the Welsh marches against the rebellion headed by Richard Marshal. The chronicler Roger of Wendover claims that John was bribed by des Roches to abandon the marshal: an allegation substantiated by the award to John of the wardship of the heir and lands of Nigel de Mowbray in return for a relatively modest proffer of 1000 marks. With des Roches's fall John none the less retained his position at court, emerging as a leading royal counsellor. In 1236 he discharged a ceremonial role at Queen Eleanor's coronation. In the following year, besides assisting in negotiations with Scotland and Wales and witnessing the reissue of 'Magna Carta', he was granted custody of the earldom of Chester on the death of Earl John the Scot. His familiarity with the king, and his purchase for 3000 marks of the marriage of Richard de Clare, heir to the earldom of Gloucester, for his eldest daughter, Maud, are said to have been resented by the king's brother, Richard of Cornwall, leading to a threat of rebellion by Richard in 1238. Thereafter Lacy's influence at court appears to have waned, perhaps as a result of the prolonged ill health from which he is said to have suffered in his final years. He died on 22 July 1240 and was buried near his father in the choir of the Cistercian abbey of Stanlaw, his bones being moved to Whalley when the monks transferred there in the 1290s. 
The fifteenth-century chronicle of Stanlaw credits Lacy with a first wife, Alice, daughter of the Anglo-Norman baron Gilbert de l'Aigle, who is said to have died childless and to have been buried at Norton Priory. Lacy's only certainly documented marriage occurred in 1221, to Margaret ['see 'Lacy, Margaret de, countess of Lincoln], daughter of Robert de Quincy (died 1217), eldest son of Saer (IV) de Quincy (who died at Damietta in 1219), and Hawise, sister of Ranulf, earl of Chester. Although in theory heir to her grandfather's earldom of Winchester, Margaret's claims were passed over in 1219 in favour of those of her uncle, Roger de Quincy, a fact that may have fuelled her husband's dissatisfaction with the regime headed by Hubert de Burgh, and which must have made his eventual acquisition of the earldom of Lincoln all the more satisfying. Margaret, who eventually succeeded to part of the Quincy estate in Dorset and to her mother's portion of the Chester inheritance, long outlived her husband. In 1242 she married Walter Marshal, earl of Pembroke (died 1245). A wealthy widow for the next twenty years, and a member of the friendship network of Queen Eleanor, Margaret died in March 1266 at Hamstead Marshall and was buried in the church of the hospitallers at Clerkenwell. Her son from her marriage to John, Edmund de Lacy, probably born in 1230, was permitted to succeed to his father's estates in May 1248, at the age of only eighteen, and by 1255 at the latest was styled earl of Lincoln, receiving the third penny of the county. In May 1247 he married Alice, daughter of Manfred, marquess of Saluzzo, a kinsman of Queen Eleanor, and died on 2 June 1258, being buried at Stanlaw. 
Besides making awards to the religious, principally of Pontefract and Stanlaw, John de Lacy issued the first surviving borough charter for the men of Rochdale. His arms are recorded on his seal as earl of Lincoln and by Matthew Paris as quarterly or and gules, a bend let sable and a label of four points argent, derived perhaps from the Mandeville earls of Essex via the marriage of Lacy's grandfather to a Mandeville kinswoman.

Lacy, John (c.1615-1681), playwright and actor, born in the vicinity of Doncaster, Yorkshire, went in 1631 to London where he was apprenticed to the dancing-master John Ogilby, who ran a school in Gray's Inn Lane. Later renowned for dialect-based performances, Lacy is said (by John Aubrey in his 'Letters Written by Eminent Persons', 1813) to have furnished Ben Jonson with northern dialect terms and proverbs for his 1630s drama (critical opinion varies as to whether this was for 'A Tale of a Tub', 'c'.1633, or 'The Sad Shepherd', 1637, although the north midlands setting of the latter makes that the more likely choice). Aubrey quotes Lacy on Jonson elsewhere in his manuscripts. In 1639 Lacy is recorded as acting in the company of the Cockpit Theatre. A wife, Margaret, is referred to by certain contemporaries but little more is known of her personal life. Elias Ashmole's diary refers to the baptism of Lacy's second son on 17 March 1665. 
During the English civil wars Lacy served as a lieutenant and quartermaster under Colonel Charles Gerard, later the earl of Macclesfield. At the Restoration he was a founder member of Thomas Killigrew's King's Company at the Theatre Royal and rose to become one of that company's star performers. Like other early Restoration actors, he appears to have played some female parts, despite the advent of professional women performers, taking the lead in 'The French Dancing Mistress' in 1662. Among other roles, he played Scruple the nonconformist in John Wilson's comedy 'The Cheats' in 1662 and Teague in Sir Robert Howard's 'The Committee' in 1663. Samuel Pepys witnessed the latter performance, remarking that it was 'a merry but an indifferent play' but that Lacy's performance as an Irish footman was 'beyond imagination' (Pepys, 4.181, 12 June 1663). On seeing Lacy in the part on a subsequent occasion, Pepys observed that his role was 'so well performed that it would set off anything' (ibid., 8.384, 13 Aug 1667). John Evelyn also saw Lacy perform this role, praising it in his diary. It has been argued that Lacy's performances in these two roles along with that of Monsieur Galliard (the dance reference was highly apposite) in 'The Variety' by William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle, are enshrined in a triple portrait of him by John Michael Wright which hung in Windsor Castle until the early nineteenth century. Other scholars have disputed this attribution, however, and argued that the roles represented are those of Galliard, Wareston from John Tatham's 'The Rump', and Ananias from Ben Jonson's 'The Alchemist', parts Lacy can be assumed to have played in the first two years of the Restoration prior to this painting's execution about 1662 (it is datable from a reference in Evelyn, 'Diary', 3.338-9; Cooper, 759). A later copy of this painting is owned by the Garrick Club. 
In addition to playing in new dramas, Lacy made a name for himself in several revivals of pre-civil war play texts, including James Shirley's 'The Changes, or, Love in a Maze' -- of which Pepys remarked 'The play is pretty good, but the life of the play is Lacy's part, the Clowne' (Pepys, 4.179, 10 June 1663) -- and several plays by Jonson: between 1664 and 1665, as well as Ananias, he played Captain Otter in 'Epicoene, or, The Silent Woman' and Sir Politic Would-Be in 'Volpone'. 
About this time Lacy began to write his own plays, some of which were adaptations of existent texts. 'The Old Troop, or, Monsieur Raggou' made use of his own civil war experiences and influenced Sir Walter Scott's nineteenth-century novel 'Woodstock'. Lacy is believed to have played the part of Raggou, a French servant, in the original 1664-5 production. The play, which was not published until 1672, deals with the resentment felt in the English countryside (justified according to the play's representations) towards the cavalier soldiers who were billeted on villages between 1642 and 1649. 
In 1666, as well as speaking the 'Epilogue' in Sir Robert Howard's 'The Vestal Virgin', Lacy played Sir Roger in a revival of Beaumont and Fletcher's 'The Scornful Lady'; he also wrote an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew', entitled 'Sauny the Scot'. This was performed at the Theatre Royal in 1667. It has been suggested that Lacy played Petruchio in an earlier revival of Shakespeare's drama and this inspired his version. There is no firm evidence of this but 'Sauny the Scot' in many respects stays close to its Shakespearian forebear until the final act. The influence of John Fletcher's own version, 'The Woman's Prize, or, The Tamer Tamed' ('c'.1611), can also be registered. Nevertheless, Lacy's appropriation of the play for the Restoration is significant. He turns a largely verse drama into prose, and relocates Shakespeare's story from Renaissance Italy to contemporary London. Lucentio, the Paduan student of the original, becomes Winlove, an Oxford graduate, and an opposition between town and country is established in the play, recognizable from other Restoration comedies. Margaret is the equivalent of Katherina and it is perhaps indicative of the changing sexual and social mores of the Restoration period that her part is considerably expanded to allow for a more sustained rebellion against Petruchio in the final act. The title character, Sauny, is a Scottish version of Grumio, Petruchio's servant, and is most likely to have been played by Lacy, considering his propensity for dialect parts: Sauny makes comic matter of English niceties and is constantly 'Scratten and Scrubben' himself (II.i.25). 
Another dialect part figures in Lacy's 'Sir Hercules Buffoon, or, The Poetical Squire', staged presumably in 1684. In this play, a Yorkshire heiress speaks in a dialect form redolent of Lacy's native Doncaster: 'Marra, the devilst learn French for me. By my saul, ean Yorkshire word, nuncle, s'worth ten thousand French eans' (II.ii). The title character is a country squire, the nephew of Alderman Buffoon. Anxious to see the players while he is in London, he falls prey, in the tradition of country gulls, to wiser city folk who make him an apprentice of their poetical society by forcing him through an initiation ceremony. Buffoon exhibits his lack of judgement by preferring John Taylor the Water Poet over Ben Jonson (whom Lacy imitates at various points elsewhere in the play). 
In 1667 Lacy appeared in Edward Howard's controversial satire on the court of Charles II, entitled 'The Change of Crowns' (which was never published). The king and queen went to see the production on 15 April 1667. By the time Samuel Pepys tried to see it again the next day the play text had already been altered. Lacy, according to Pepys, 'did act the Country Gentleman come up to Court, who doth abuse the Court with all the imaginable wit and plainness, about selling of places and doing everything for money' (Pepys, 8.167-8, 15 April 1667). The king was said to have been so angered by the play that he detained Lacy in the porter's lodge. He was pardoned but the play remained under censure. The dramatist Howard (younger son of the earl of Berkshire and brother to playwright Sir Robert Howard) and his star performer are said to have quarrelled shortly after. 
In 1667, despite serious illness, Lacy performed in a revival of 'The Changes'. Subsequent parts included Bayes in the second duke of Buckingham's 'The Rehearsal' in 1671 (a role based on Dryden), Drench in his own play 'The Dumb Lady, or, The Farrier Made Physician' (1672), an adaptation (not much liked) of Moliere's 'Le medecin malgre lui' and 'L'amour medecin' (about this time he also played the lead role in Moliere's 'Tartuffe'), Alderman Gripe in Wycherley's 'Love in a Wood, or, St James's Park' at Lincoln's Inn (still with Killigrew's company), and Intrigo in Sir Francis Fane's 'Love in the Dark, or The Man of Business'. He is also reputed to have played Falstaff. 

'The Dumb Lady', as its title suggests, tells the story of a woman about to be married (Olinda) who appears to have fallen mute. Certain characters reflect that this is unsurprising in view of the fop she is to be married to: the aptly named Squire Softhead. They inform her father who is anxious for the match: 'Do you think your daughter had not better be dumb and dead than marry such a ridiculous brute as this?' (I.i, p. 14). Once again, Lacy's drama exhibits considerable empathy for its women characters. A physician is sent for to attend to Olinda's ailment and Jarvis and Softhead are tricked by Isabel into believing her husband Drench (the part played by Lacy) to be a physician. A great deal of knockabout farce ensues. Indeed farce in the French style appears to have been the form Lacy most favoured in his own compositions. It has been argued that Lacy's adaptation of Moliere influenced that by Henry Fielding in the eighteenth century (Colmer, 35-9). 
Contemporary satires alleged that Lacy had a relationship with the king's mistress Nell Gwyn. Certainly, he gave her acting and dancing lessons. He clearly kept up his dancing skills in later life, adding dances to the entr'actes of, for example, 'Horace' in 1668. Financial issues seem to have pursued him in later life. In 1673 he was sued by one Mary Bennett, presumably for debt, and in 1674 he became embroiled in a debate over the pay of French dancers at the court. Lacy died on 17 September 1681 at his address in Drury Lane after a long and successful career and was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields two days later.

Lacy, John (bap. 1664, d. 1730), self-styled prophet, was baptized on 30 May 1664 in Saffron Walden, Essex. He was the fifth son of Jerome Lacy ('fl'. 1630-1670) and his wife, Elizabeth 
('nee' Pypes; 'fl'. 1630-1670)
, formerly of Toppesfield, Essex. He acquired a rudimentary knowledge of Latin but, unlike his brothers, did not attend Cambridge University. In the early 1680s he became a successful London merchant, living at Tottenham. Soon after 3 April 1688 he married Susanna ('fl'. 1670?-1715), daughter of Edward Rudge, and moved to St Giles, Middlesex, but no surviving children were born before 1699. As a member of the millenarian 'religious society for the reformation of manners', Lacy was associated with Anglicans, but he attended the Presbyterian chapel in Tothill Street, Westminster. In 1704 he actively supported Edmund Calamy's election as his chapel's minister, and also published a letter defending the practice of occasional conformity. 
At a time when his situation was aggravated by the loss of a lawsuit Lacy espoused the cause of the French Prophets (Camisard refugees by origin), who had arrived in England in 1706 but whose utterances and miracles were dismissed as spurious by the Huguenot authorities. His translation of Francois Maximilien Misson's 'Theatre sacre des Cevennes' was published in March 1707 as 'A Cry from the Desart'. In April, when a mob attacked some of the Prophets, Lacy and Sir Richard Bulkeley, another sympathizer, obtained a warrant for the arrest of some of the rioters, and in June Lacy rented the Barbican (formerly used by Presbyterians) as a licensed meeting-house for the French Prophets. However, to the consternation of his wife and others, Lacy soon believed himself, also, to be inspired. In July, shortly before three of the French Prophets were due to be tried on charges of blasphemy and sedition, Lacy began to prophesy in tongues, during which time his body was curiously agitated and contorted. His prophecies were delivered as the words of God speaking in the first person, and Lacy claimed that similar messages were contained in his automatic writing. His earlier prophecies, published in three instalments during 1707 as 'Prophetical Warnings', were preoccupied with the prospect of divine judgment. The third earl of Shaftesbury's 'Letter Concerning Enthusiasm' (1708) originated from his observation of Lacy prophesying in poor Latin 'under an agitation' ('Letter', 1.32). Although they were referred to as the French Prophets, Lacy was the first of several English enthusiasts involved with the movement. At times the leaders were faced with public hostility, as when Lacy's announcement that the guns of the Tower of London 'would roar in a few days' proved to be a false alarm, and they temporarily withdrew from London to gather outside the capital. Although the Prophets performed ecclesiastical functions, Lacy was a reluctant separatist and later claimed that they had continued to frequent 'those several forms of Congregations, to which their Inclinations before used to lead them' (Lacy, 'Relation', 17). 
Lacy's expectation of public rejection, and his concern for the encouragement of those within the movement, may help to explain his most notorious prediction. Early in December 1707, when three of the French Prophets were being publicly pilloried, another member of the sect, Thomas Emes, fell sick. Lacy announced that if he died, God would raise him. When Emes was buried in Bunhill Fields on 25 December another Prophet, rasher even than Lacy, predicted his resurrection on 25 May 1708, designating Lacy as the one who would raise him. For some Prophets, belief in the expected miracle became the acid test of commitment, but their claims were severely dismissed by critics including Edmund Calamy and William Whiston. By 29 April Lacy was acknowledging that several of his earlier predictions had been mistaken and he indicated that he would not be at the graveside on 25 May. The scornful incredulity of the unruly onlookers was later cited by Lacy as the hindrance which had prevented the miracle. 
Meanwhile Lacy's domestic life was in crisis. Late in 1708 he petitioned parliament for a revision of his marriage settlement to benefit his four younger children. His brother Roger and relatives of his wife were among the trustees of the new settlement, which may have been prompted by their anxieties about Lacy's prophetic activities. Increasingly he found himself in the company of Elizabeth (Betty) Gray ('b'. 'c'.1692), whom he had claimed to cure of temporary blindness in 1707. Described by critics as 'a wild skittish girl' and a 'pretty and hansome ['sic']... young wench', she had been associated with the thespian world of Drury Lane (Kingston, 45; 'Correspondence of Alexander Pope', 1.35). In a 'Letter to Thomas Dutton' (a lawyer and one of the French Prophets), published in March 1711, Lacy explained that his wife's refusal to recognize his prophetic gifts was tantamount to fornication, and that he had therefore seen fit to take Betty Gray, 'a prophetess', to his bed. Thenceforth the trustees of his estate paid him an allowance with which he was able to move to Lancashire, where he lived and had two children with Betty Gray. His anonymous 'General Delusion of Christians with Regard to Prophecy' (1713) was revised for a further defence of the French Prophets entitled 'The Scene of Delusions' (1723). The extent of his audience may be gauged from a letter to Lacy written by Cotton Mather of Boston in 1719. Its tone is sympathetic, while troubled that the matters in Lacy's prophecies were 'too low, too mean, too trivial and jejune' ('Selected Letters', 271). Lacy died in obscurity in the early months of 1730.

Lacy, Maurice (1740-1820), army officer in Russia, was born during the great frost of 1739-40 in co. Limerick, one of two sons and four daughters of Patrick de Lacy (died 1790) of Rathcahill and Templeglentan and his wife, Lady Mary Herbert (died 1795). The de Lacys, an extensive and prominent Catholic family of Anglo-Norman ancestry, had suffered heavily in the Irish defeats of the seventeenth century. Nothing is known of Lacy's early life. His kinsmen included some of the leading immigrant Irish Catholic soldiers in Russia and the Habsburg empire and, as a young man, he took advantage of these connections to leave Ireland and enter the Russian service. He fought against the Turks and achieved general's rank. In 1792-3 he revisited Ireland. In 1799 he participated with Prince Suvorov in the defeat of the French in the north of Italy. 
In 1805 Lacy was sent to Naples to command an Anglo-Russian force against the French. Ostensibly intended to bolster the Bourbon kingdom's resistance to Napoleon, the real objective was to divert French resources from the north. After Lacy's preliminary reconnaissance in May a treaty of alliance between Russia and Naples was signed in September, and towards the end of November 11,000 Russian troops from Corfu and 6000 British from Malta, under Sir James Craig, disembarked in the Bay of Naples. Lacy had landed infirm after a rough voyage and was brought from the coast in a litter to comfortable quarters at the Angri palace, where his expenses were defrayed by King Ferdinand. Sir Henry Bunbury, the British quartermaster-general, alleged that Lacy lacked talent or knowledge but considered him a simple, kind-hearted old gentleman who, in his own words, was 'always for fighting' (Bunbury, 191). Although it was stated that he best expressed himself in Russian, he also had a knowledge of French and, of course, English, which he spoke with an Irish accent. He was known to don his nightcap during councils of war and sleep, leaving discussion to others. King Ferdinand, who had less faith in his Russian allies than Queen Caroline, thought him a comical figure when he appeared in full uniform at an audience at Portici and boasted that his sword would not return to its sheath until the king's enemies had been vanquished. 
Having made Teano his headquarters Lacy deployed his forces in a defensive position on the north-west border, posting the British along the River Garigliano, the Russians to cover the narrow Mignano Pass, and the Neapolitans on the Abruzzi frontier. Napoleon's victory at Austerlitz in December and his subsequent armistice with the tsar removed the 'raison d'etre' of the Russian military presence in Naples. When news came that a French army under Massena, accompanied by Napoleon's brother Joseph, was preparing to invade the kingdom Lacy first spoke of retiring to Calabria but instead, as ordered by the tsar, in mid-January 1806 he evacuated his force from Baia and returned to Corfu. This was a bitter disappointment to the Neapolitans, who were left defenceless against the advancing French, the British having departed. In 1807 Napoleon, with the tsar's permission, wrote to Lacy from Tilsit, suggesting that he organize an Irish force against England but nothing came of this. Lacy played no prominent part in subsequent campaigns and took up the post of governor of Grodno, in Belorussia, where he possessed estates. He died there, unmarried, in January 1820, 'the last male descendent, direct, of the great Hugh de Lacy' ('Sketch Pedigree'), leaving an estate valued at $100,000.

Lacy, Michael Rophino (1795-1867), violinist, was born on 19 July 1795 at Bilbao in Spain. His father was an Irish merchant, his mother Spanish. He began learning the violin at the age of five, and when he was six made his public debut at a concert given in Bilbao by Andreossi, an Italian violinist, playing a concerto by Giovanni Giornovichi. It is said that he was so small that he had to stand up on a table before the audience could see him, but the performance was very well received. As an infant prodigy he was patronized by the court of Madrid until 1802, in which year he commenced his schooling at Bordeaux. After eighteen months there he proceeded (in 1803) to a 'lycee' in Paris to finish his education. While in Paris he was a pupil of Rodolphe Kreutzer, under whom he made rapid progress, and towards the end of 1804, as 'le petit Espagnol', he played a violin solo before Napoleon at the Tuileries. 
Meanwhile, his father had been ruined by some American speculations, and Lacy was brought to England at the end of October 1805 to study under Giovanni Battista Viotti. On the journey he played in various Dutch towns, and became a great favourite in The Hague. It is reported that, at the time of arriving in England, when he was ten years and three months, he was able to speak fluent English, French, Italian, and Spanish, and had a fair knowledge of Latin. He was at first known merely as 'the young Spaniard', for his real name was not publicly revealed in England until May 1807, when an engraved portrait of him by Cardon (from a drawing by Smart) was published. Among his patrons were the prince of Wales, the duke of Sussex, the duchess of York, and Count Stahremberg, the Austrian ambassador. His first concert in London was given at the Hanover Square Rooms, and soon afterwards he played at Angelica Catalani's first concert in Dublin, during a visit to Ireland of Michael Kelly's opera company. On this occasion his patrons were the lord lieutenant, the duke of Richmond, and his wife. Performances at Natale Corri's concerts in Edinburgh followed, for which he received the large fee of 20 guineas per night. 
In obedience to his father's will, Lacy subsequently abandoned the musical for the theatrical profession, and for about ten years (1808-18) filled 'genteel comedy parts' in Edinburgh, Dublin, and Glasgow, playing the violin in public only at his benefits. In 1818, at the invitation of the directors, he succeeded Felix Yaniewicz as leader and director of the Liverpool concerts, the musicians for which were recruited from the best talent in London. At the end of 1820 Lacy returned to London and became leader of the ballet orchestra at the King's Theatre, where he is said to have directed the ballets and composed most of the ballet music for the Italian opera. However, in 1823, following disagreements with the musical director, he returned to the management of the Liverpool concerts, though he resumed his position at the King's Theatre in 1824. 
For the rest of his professional life Lacy employed his musical and linguistic skills principally in the adaptation of foreign librettos for the English stage, as well as translating several French plays and arranging the music of well-known French and Italian operas. It was Lacy who made the first English adaptations of several of Rossini's operas, including 'Semiramide' (first performed at Covent Garden, 7 March 1829) and 'La Cenerentola' (Cinderella; Covent Garden, 13 April 1830). Contemporary conventions allowed a great deal of artistic licence to be exercised, and Lacy often used music from different operas in a single adaptation. For example, 'Cinderella' includes music from Rossini's 'Maometto II', 'Armida', and 'Guillaume Tell', while the 'dramatic oratorio' 'The Israelites in Egypt' (Covent Garden, 22 February 1833) is a pasticcio combining Handel's 'Israel in Egypt' and Rossini's 'Mose in Egitto'. Other adaptations include music from operas by Mozart, Auber, Meyerbeer, and Weber. Lacy also arranged favourite airs for beginners to play in public (1826). Among his compositions are a set of three rondos for the piano, a quintet for two violins, viola, flute, and cello with piano accompaniment, numerous fantasies on operatic themes (mainly for piano), and songs. He assisted with the research for Victor Schoelcher's biography of Handel during the 1850s. Lacy died at Pentonville, London, on 20 September 1867.

Lacy, Peter, Count Lacy in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire (1678-1751), army officer in the Russian service, was born in Killeedy, co. Limerick, Ireland, on 29 September 1678, the son of Peter Lacy (Pierce de Lacy) of Coylross and his wife, Maria de Courtenay. His military career dates from 1691, when at the age of just thirteen he saw action as an ensign at the second siege of Limerick. Following five years in French service he entered that of Peter the Great, being among the first group of 100 western European officers recruited in 1700 at the start of Russia's Great Northern War against Charles XII of Sweden. The talent Lacy showed in the earliest Russian campaign in the Baltic territories of Livonia and Ingria ensured him rapid promotion: from captain in 1701 to colonel in 1708. In 1706 he was given command of the Polotsky regiment as well as three newly raised regiments to train. In December 1708 he attacked and captured the headquarters of Charles XII at Rumna, and the delighted tsar rewarded Lacy with the prestigious command of a grenadier regiment. He went on to become 'one of the most famous soldiers of the 18th century. Indeed no Irish family has attained greater fame in the military history of Europe' (MacLysaght, 205). 
In July 1709, at the battle of Poltava, the Swedes lost to a Russian army twice their size, thereby precipitating their eventual defeat. Lacy's advice to the tsar on musketry methods is said to have played a decisive role in Russia's celebrated victory. Crucially, he insisted that the musketeers should hold their fire until coming within a few yards of the enemy. Consequently Charles was defeated and in one action lost the advantage of nine previous campaigns. In 1711 Lacy married Martha Philippine von Funcken, of the Livonian family of Loser. They had five daughters and three sons: Peter Anthony, who became a general in the Polish service; Francis Maurice, an Austrian field marshal and chancellor of the Holy Roman empire; and Patrick Boris, a general of infantry. 
In 1719, newly promoted to the rank of major-general, Lacy led a devastating raid on several Swedish coastal towns and villages. In a similar action two years later, by which time he was lieutenant-general in command of 5000 troops, he razed Sundsvall. This set-back was enough to prompt the Swedish negotiators at Nystadt to yield Livonia to Russia, thus affording her direct access to the Baltic Sea and so paving the way for the treaty of Nystadt, which was at last concluded in September 1721. 
After Russia's victory over Sweden, Lacy's rise continued apace. In 1723 he became a member of the war college. In 1725 Catherine I made him a knight of the order of St Alexander Nevsky on the very day of its institution, 21 May. He was appointed general-in-chief of infantry and commander of all forces garrisoned in St Petersburg, Ingria, and Novgorod. In the general staff list for 1728 his name ranked third among the six full generals in the Russian army. As a foreigner, his annual salary was 3600 roubles whereas Russians received only 3120. A further indication of Lacy's standing at this time is the fact that his signature always occupied first place on war college reports to Catherine I. 
In 1727 Lacy was ordered to expel Maurice de Saxe from the duchy of Courland. Maurice, much to Russia's irritation, had managed to have himself elected duke of Courland. The duchess of Courland was Anna, the daughter of Peter the Great's half-brother Ivan. She later became empress of Russia, on the death of Peter II in 1730. Her request to marry Maurice de Saxe had been rejected by Catherine I and led to the decision to expel him and his retinue from the duchy. Lacy's successful execution of this task confirmed him as the most influential foreigner at the Russian court. This position, however, was not without its dangers. Lacy was always careful to avoid court intrigue. Indeed, it is precisely to this quality that his remarkable survival throughout the 'era of palace revolutions' is generally attributed. But his high standing caused resentment among the many ambitious Germans at the court of Empress Anna (1730-40). The most powerful threat came from Burkhardt Munnich (Minikh), one of Anna's Courland favourites, who was determined to achieve sole authority over Russia's military affairs. 
The rivalry between Lacy and Munnich grew when they saw action together in 1733 in the Russians' march on Warsaw in support of Augustus of Saxony's candidacy as king of Poland against that of Stanislas Leszczynski, who was supported by France. The ensuing War of the Polish Succession, which was concluded in 1735, gave both men the opportunity to display their military prowess. Of the two, in the view of the military historian Maslovsky, it was Lacy, overall commander of Russian forces in Poland, who had the better war. After successfully raising the siege of Danzig in 1733, Lacy further distinguished himself the following year at the battle of Wisiczin. Then, at the decisive battle of Busawitza, although outnumbered ten to one, he completely routed Leszczynski's forces. Following victory in the War of the Polish Succession, Lacy was created a knight of the order of the White Eagle of Poland by Augustus III. He spent the next two years assisting Augustus to consolidate his position as king of Poland, defeating counter-attacks in a series of remarkable actions. Lacy then visited Vienna, where he was warmly received by the emperor and empress and presented with gifts. It was on his return from the Austrian capital to St Petersburg that he was made a Russian field marshal. This was the first time in Russia's history that there had been two foreigners serving as field marshals in imperial service -- the other being Munnich. 
Lacy's first mission as field marshal was to prepare for the siege of Azov in anticipation of the long-expected war with Turkey, which was waged from 1735 to 1739. During the ensuing siege he was wounded and fortunate not to fall into Turkish hands. Azov capitulated to Lacy's forces in July 1736. 
In 1737 Lacy was appointed to the order of St Andrew and made commander of a new campaign to annex the Crimea. Two previous attempts to do so, Leontyev's in 1735 and Munnich's in 1736, had ended in failure. Lacy eagerly accepted this new challenge and rose to it with characteristic brilliance. To the astonishment of the Crimean khan, Lacy bridged the Azov Sea at a narrow point near Perekop. Within four days his entire army crossed it and began marching on Arabat. As one commentator wryly observed, 'the parallel to a well-known incident in the book of 'Exodus' was sufficiently striking to make an immense impression upon the superstitious Russian soldiers' (Jane, 73). Then, on learning that the khan had reached Arabat before him, Lacy decided to spring a further surprise by fording the sea separating him from the rest of the Crimea. By the use of typically imaginative strategy Lacy successfully completed his mission. Nevertheless, the Crimea was not finally annexed to the Russian empire until 1783. 
Meanwhile, Lacy's relationship with Munnich deteriorated. The Irishman's achievements in the field, together with his popularity among his troops and at court, so antagonized the Courlander that on one occasion he drew his sabre and attacked Lacy. Fortunately, a third party, General Levashov, managed to separate the two field marshals before any serious damage could be done. 
In 1740 Lacy was made a count, and in the spring of 1741 he was made commander of Russian forces in Finland mobilizing for renewed war with Sweden. Following Sweden's declaration of war that July, he advanced at the head of 30,000 troops on Villmanstrand and defeated its 11,000 Swedish defenders under General Wrangel. However, lack of reinforcements and supplies compelled him to return to St Petersburg. There, in December, Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great, became empress literally overnight as a result of a palace revolt. Lacy, suddenly challenged to declare his support for Anna of Brunswick, regent for the boy emperor Ivan VI, or Elizabeth, judiciously indicated his support for 'the party of the reigning empress', an answer which apparently satisfied Elizabeth. Her accession brought down the so-called German party at court. Senior Courlanders, among them Ostermann, Biron, and Munnich, were disgraced and exiled. Lacy, however, became the principal field marshal in the Russian service. An immediate consequence of Elizabeth's policy of Russifying the court and the armed forces was an outbreak of xenophobic riots in the capital. Lacy promptly implemented a system of strict policing of army personnel in St Petersburg, thus averting potentially much more dangerous disturbances between Russian and foreign serving officers in the capital. After the three-month truce with Sweden following Elizabeth's accession, Lacy returned in June to Swedish Finland at the head of a large force. He took Fredrikshamn, which had been torched and abandoned by the Swedes. There was jubilation at the capture of what was the only fortified town in Swedish Finland without the loss of a single man. Lacy pursued the retreating Swedish army and eventually surrounded it near Helsingfors (Helsinki). He cut off its further retreat to Abo by leading his forces along an unmapped road which had been built during the campaigns of Peter the Great and was revealed to the field marshal by a Finnish peasant. The surprised Swedish army capitulated, leaving all Finland subject to the Russian empire. Lacy thus returned with renewed triumph to the Russian court. 
In 1743 Lacy was made a senator. At the start of Russia's operations against Sweden in that year Elizabeth boarded the field marshal's ship in St Petersburg to present him with gifts and to bless his newest enterprise, which, in the event, was pre-empted by the treaty of Abo (August 1743). Once more he returned in triumph to St Petersburg, this time aboard a yacht sent by the empress herself. After the peace celebrations, which marked the culmination of his fifty years' active service, Lacy retired to his estates in Livonia as governor of the province, a post to which Peter II had originally appointed him back in 1729. Over the years Lacy had acquired a number of properties at Riga in Livonia, among them Grosser Rop, Alt-Kalzenau, Segewold, Lindenhof, and Dahlen. There he resided until his death, in Riga on 30 April 1751 at the age of seventy-two, survived by his wife. John Cook, the doctor who attended Lacy in his last months, recalled that the citizens of Riga so mourned the field marshal's death that 'they tolled their bells eight days' (Cook, 622). He left a large fortune ($60,000 sterling) and sizeable estates, acquired, as his will states, by way of an epitaph, 'through long and hard service and with much danger and uneasiness' (ibid., 498). 
Lacy was a popular commander who combined qualities of unusual ability and sound judgement. He had a notoriously quick temper, but, in the words of one English historian, 'he was generous to a fault, as brave as a lion and incapable of committing a mean action' (Bain, 219). In the course of his remarkable career he served five eighteenth-century sovereigns, and he partnered a sixth, the future Catherine II, at her wedding dance in 1745, when she was sixteen years old. Unquestionably his most affectionate imperial patron was Elizabeth. This is evident not only from the various attentions she showed him, but also from the fact that other foreign officers regarded him as the best channel for reaching the empress themselves. Moreover, when she was told that Lacy's health was improving (during what was to be his final illness), 'she expressed as great satisfaction as if he had been her father' (Cook, 617). What impressed Russians about Lacy was his loyalty to their country: 'He differed markedly from the other Russian commanders of foreign birth in that he always pursued Russia's interests, never his own' ('Russkii biograficheskii slovar', 86). The admiration he aroused was typically expressed in a common soldier's view, as recorded by Sergey Solovyov: 'Even though he was a foreigner, he was a good man' ('Voennaya entsiklopediya', 1914, 517). In 1891 a division of the Russian army -- the 13th Belozersky infantry regiment -- was named in his honour.

Lacy, Roger de (d. 1211), soldier and administrator, was son of John, soldier and landowner, and Alice de Vere, who was a cousin of William de Mandeville, earl of Essex, and niece of Aubrey (III) de Vere, earl of Oxford. Roger's father, who was lord of Halton in Cheshire, was son of Richard fitz Eustace, and Aubreye, daughter of Robert de Lisours and cousin of Robert de Lacy (died 1193), the last direct male descendant of Ilbert de Lacy, lord of Pontefract in the late eleventh century. John the constable was briefly placed in charge of Dublin in 1181, and, later going on crusade, died at Tyre on 11 October 1190. He founded Stanlaw Abbey, Cheshire, about 1172 (it was afterwards transferred to Whalley in 1296, by his descendant Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln), and also the hospital of Castle Donington. 
On his father's death Roger de Lacy became constable of Chester. In 1191, having been entrusted by the chancellor with the custody of the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham, he hanged two knights who had conspired to surrender these castles to Count John, who in revenge plundered Lacy's lands. On 21 April 1194, several months after Robert de Lacy's death, Roger acquired from his grandmother, Aubreye (Robert's cousin and heir), Robert's lands, and adopted the Lacy name (derived from Lassy in Calvados). Now lord of Pontefract, on 6 June 1194 he granted its burgesses a charter of liberties. In April 1199 he was among the barons who agreed to swear fealty to John only after they were promised restoration of what they alleged to be their rights. One of his claims was to twenty fees which Guy de Laval held of the honour of Pontefract, a claim which was realized by 1203. Between 25 August and 6 December 1199 Lacy attended John in Normandy, Maine, Touraine, and Poitou, and on 23 September 1199 was installed as castellan of Chinon. In the same year he recovered his castle of Pontefract, which the king had retained. He was obliged to surrender his eldest son as a hostage, but from this time he remained in high favour with the new king. He was sent in October or November 1200 to escort William the Lion to Lincoln, and was present when the Scottish king did homage there to John on 22 November. In 1201 he was sent, with William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, in command of one hundred knights each, to check the assaults of the king's enemies on the borders of Normandy. In 1202 he was controlling shipping along the Seine, and in April 1203 he acted as surety for the loyalty of Earl Ranulf (III) of Chester. In 1203 he successfully proffered $1000 for the custody of the land and heir of Richard de Montfichet. 
In 1203 Philip Augustus of France besieged Lacy in the famous Chateau Gaillard, which he defended with incomparable fidelity for several months, and only surrendered through stress of famine on 6 March 1204. Matthew Paris relates that the French king, in recognition of his gallant defence, put him in free custody. Lacy was ransomed by John's assistance for $1000. He was further rewarded by being made sheriff of Yorkshire and Cumberland, offices that he held until 1209. In the winter of 1204-5, when northern England was on the verge of rebellion, he remained loyal to John, fortifying Carlisle, and in the spring of 1205 he helped to organize the host against a threatened French invasion. In the years that followed, Lacy was often in attendance upon the king, and was one of John's gambling partners. In 1205 he acquired the Lancashire barony of Penwortham after paying off the debts of its previous lord, Hugh Buissel. In 1210 he was dispatched with troops to restore order in the Welsh marches, and is said to have rescued Earl Ranulf of Chester who was besieged by the Welsh at Rhuddlan, Flintshire. His fierce raids against the Welsh are said to have earned him the name of 'Roger of Hell'. 
Lacy married Maud de Clere, sister of the treasurer of York Cathedral; they had at least two sons, John de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, and Roger, and possibly a third son, Robert, who is said to have been appointed constable of Flamborough. Lacy's principal residences were at Pontefract (Yorkshire), Clitheroe (Lancashire), and Halton. He died on 1 October 1211 at Stanlaw Abbey, and was buried there. He was a benefactor of that abbey, and also of Byland, Fountains, Kirkstall, Kirkstead, Pontefract, Sallay, and Watton. He was described by Roger of Wendover as a 'great and warlike man' and as a 'noble man and outstanding knight' ('Flores historiarum', 2.8, 58).

Lacy, Thomas Hailes (1809-1873), actor, playwright, and theatrical publisher, was born Thomas Lacy Hailes in Bethnal Green, London, the son of Thomas Hailes, gentleman. He made his London debut on 7 April 1828 as Lenoir in William Dimond's 'The Foundling of the Forest' (Olympic). He then acted in the provinces before undertaking management of the Windsor Theatre for Montague Penley, whom he then succeeded as lessee. For a short period from 1841 he was manager of the Theatre Royal, Sheffield. After provincial engagements in Nottingham and Doncaster, he returned to London in 1844 to act at the Pavilion and Victoria theatres. In May he joined Samuel Phelps's new company at Sadler's Wells, where Frances Dalton, under her stage name Fanny Cooper ['see below'], whom he probably married on 25 January 1842 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, was also engaged. On 29 May 1844, the opening night of the season, Lacy was Banquo to Phelps's Macbeth. Other parts that season included Tobias in Benjamin Thompson's 'The Stranger', Antonio in 'The Merchant of Venice', and Appius Claudius in Sheridan Knowles's tragedy 'Virginius'. In the 1844-5 season he appeared in Manchester. He was a serviceable actor, capable of a variety of roles, but he never received serious critical attention. 
Lacy's activities as a playwright consisted mostly of collaborative adaptations of novels. He adapted Moncrieff's versions of Dickens as 'The Pickwickians' (1837) and (with T. H. Higgie) 'Martin Chuzzlewit' (Queens, 29 July 1844); (also with Higgie) W. H. Ainsworth's 'The Tower of London' (City of London theatre, 26 December 1840); and, via a French version by Jules Janin (with John Courtney), Samuel Richardson's 'Clarissa Harlowe' (Princess's, 28 September 1846), in which Charles Mathews played Lovelace. At Sadler's Wells on 5 August 1846 his one-act farce 'A Silent Woman' was the afterpiece, with Fanny Cooper as Miss Sandford. His pieces are unremarkable; several, however, were published in his acting edition, and 'A Silent Woman' was also printed in New York in De Witt's series. Lacy edited anthologies of recitations (1864, 1866) and collections of costume plates (1865, 1868, 1872). He also projected publication of an updated edition of Baker's 'Biographia dramatica' (1812), for which he collected new material, six manuscript volumes of which are now in the British Library, along with four annotated copies of Baker's original. 
Lacy's main contribution to the theatre was in publishing. In 1849 he opened a theatrical booksellers at 17 Wellington Street, Strand, and in 1857 he moved to larger premises at 89 Strand. He proved an astute, if not especially scrupulous, businessman and from about 1852 onwards bought out the lists of venerable competitors such as John Cumberland, G. H. Davidson, and John Duncombe, and (about 1856) more recent rivals such as Samuel G. Fairbrother, with the evident intention of cornering the market in printing cheap editions of plays. 'Lacy's Acting Edition', begun in 1850, with full stage directions and business, rapidly became the largest enterprise of its kind, catering for amateurs and professionals alike. All plays in the series, available individually at 6died or in volume sets, were kept continuously in print; an up-to-date listing of pieces in Lacy's proprietorship was published separately in 1864. By his retirement in 1873 the series comprised ninety-nine volumes and 1458 plays. His performance fees were deliberately pitched lower than those of the Dramatic Authors' Society, which simply acted as a fee-collecting agent for its members. Lacy specialized in buying up copyrights at knock-down prices from impecunious dramatists; but on occasions he assumed copyright without authority. F. C. Burnand, who as an inexperienced playwright in the early 1860s had reason to mistrust him on both accounts, portrayed him as a rather roguish figure in 'dirty shirt sleeves', 'muddling about with books and papers in a very ill-lighted and grimy shop' (Burnand, 1.368). For his cavalier attitude to copyright Lacy was successfully brought to court for unauthorized dramatizations of copyright novels in 'Reade v. Lacy' (1862) and 'Tinsley v. Lacy' (1863). At his decease the Dramatic Authors' Society claimed from his estate in unpaid or misappropriated copyright fees the sum of $700, which after negotiation with the executor was reduced to $250. 
Having sold his business early in 1873 to the New York publisher Samuel French, Lacy retired to Surrey, but died at his home in Benhill Street, Sutton, on 1 August. He was buried at Sutton church on 6 August. His library was sold by auction between 24 and 29 November 1873 for $2650 and his theatrical portraits on 8 December for $1970. In his will the 'interest, profits, and rentals' derived from a capital sum of $8000, copyright and acting rights on Cumberland's 'British Theatre' and 'Minor Theatre', and property (including 9, 11, and 13 Garrick Street) he left to a charity for needy actors and actresses, the Royal General Theatrical Fund, of which he was a long-serving board member. Known as the 'Lacy Bequest', it provided the fund with much of its income for the rest of the century and beyond.

Lacy, Walter de (d. 1085), magnate, was a Norman who made a great fortune for himself in the conquest of England. He and his brother Ilbert, from whom the Lacys of Pontefract were descended, shared a Norman estate centred on Lassy, from which they were named and which they held as men of the bishop of Bayeux. In England, however, they were independent operators, and Walter, who clearly already had a military reputation, was set up by King William in the southern Welsh marches alongside Earl William fitz Osbern in 1067. Together they fought the Welsh of Brycheiniog and Gwent. Walter's lands in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire -- where the bulk of his possessions lay -- had belonged to the rich Englishman Eadwig Cild and other lesser thegns; Walter made his main headquarters at Weobley, Herefordshire, which had been Eadwig's principal manor. Until 1075 Walter was second in the region only to Earl William and his son Roger de Breteuil, but the idea that he was their man can be discounted: they certainly gave him some manors as a tenant in Herefordshire and Oxfordshire, but he also forged links with Roger de Montgomery, earl of Shrewsbury, and the bishops of Hereford and Worcester, among others, which extended his lands into Shropshire and Worcestershire and made him a significant figure throughout the western midlands. 
On the rebellion of Roger de Breteuil in 1075, Walter de Lacy remained loyal to the king and helped ensure that the revolt failed, no doubt being additionally rewarded in the aftermath. From 1075 he was the leading baron in the region, and made new links with his fellow marcher lords, including those who had been fitz Osbern's men: a niece, for example, married fitz Osbern's former follower Ansfrid de Cormeilles. Walter had some two dozen tenants on his English estates, mostly his own men rather than other tenants-in-chief, and some of them English; the leading men of his honour of Weobley witnessed the charter by which his son Roger renewed his agreements with the bishop of Hereford in 1085. A benefactor of Gloucester Abbey, he also founded and endowed the collegiate church of St Peter in Hereford. Walter died on 27 March 1085, perhaps (as later family legend had it) falling off the scaffolding while inspecting the building works at another favoured church in Hereford, St Guthlac's. He was buried in the chapter house at Gloucester Abbey. 
Walter was survived by his wife, Ermeline, and succeeded by his son Roger de Lacy, who rebelled against William II in 1088 and again in 1094-5, after which he was dispossessed and sent into exile, though the king allowed his brother Hugh to succeed. On Hugh's death, perhaps before 1115, his daughter Sibyl and her husband Pain fitz John received only part of the family's lands, but under King Stephen, Roger's son Gilbert de Lacy recovered most of it. A third son of Walter de Lacy entered Gloucester Abbey as a child and was its abbot from 1130 to his death in 1139, while a daughter became a nun at Winchester.

Lacy, Walter de (d. 1241), magnate, was the eldest son of Hugh de Lacy (d. 1186) and Rose (died before 1180), widow of Baderon of Monmouth (died 1170x76), and the elder brother of Hugh de Lacy (d. 1242). 
A minor at the time of his father's death in 1186, Walter de Lacy succeeded to Hugh's estates in England, Wales, and Normandy during the final quarter of the year 1188/9. He had difficulty gaining possession of his father's Irish lordship of Mide, because John, son of Henry II, sought to retain it in his own hands to maximize his wealth as lord of Ireland. It was not until John had rebelled against King Richard and the king had assumed lordship of Ireland in person in 1194 that Lacy gained full possession of Mide. King Richard appointed Lacy and the lord of Ulster, John de Courcy, as his justiciars in Ireland in place of John's agents, Peter Pipard and William Petit. When the latter resisted their removal, Lacy and Courcy waged war against them. Following John's reconciliation with King Richard, Lacy and Courcy were replaced by John's nominee, Hamo de Valognes. About the same time, John issued a charter restoring Mide to Lacy to hold on the same terms as had his father on the day of his death. On 5 July 1194 Lacy established a borough at Drogheda, conferring on it the customs of Breteuil, an early indication of his interest in the economic exploitation of his Irish lordship. 
In 1198 Lacy negotiated a proffer of 3100 marks to recover King Richard's goodwill and his Norman and English lands (except Ludlow Castle), an earlier offer of 1000 marks in 1197 having been rejected. An order issued by King John shortly after his accession hints at why this was necessary. The king instructed his justiciar in Ireland on 4 September 1199, in the context of restoring to royal favour Henry Tirel, to inquire whether Henry 'had sided with John de Courcy and Walter de Lacy and aided them in destroying the king's land of Ireland' ('Rotuli de oblatis et finibus', 74). It may be that John, as lord of Ireland, had persuaded King Richard to sequestrate Lacy's lands in England and Normandy for actions taken in Ireland; alternatively, Richard may have taken exception to Lacy's subsequently reaching an accommodation with John in respect of his Irish lands, and sought to maintain his overriding lordship there. 
Between September 1199 and March 1201 Walter de Lacy witnessed charters issued by King John, suggesting that he was retained in the royal retinue, while about October 1200 Meiler fitz Henry, justiciar in Ireland, was directed to take hostages from Lacy's principal tenants in Mide. About November 1200 Lacy's marriage was arranged to Margaret or Margery, daughter of William (III) de Briouze, a baron with extensive holdings in the Welsh marches, who had been newly created lord of the honour of Limerick. The alliance was of mutual benefit: Briouze supervised Lacy's estates in the marches, while Lacy in turn guarded his father-in-law's Irish interests. 
On 10 February 1204 the king, in a letter requesting an aid from the clergy of Ireland for his campaign in Normandy, stated that he was sending Lacy as a messenger to them. In that year, however, Walter de Lacy lost his Norman lands at Lassy, Campeaux, and Le Pin to King Philip Augustus of France, who had granted the greater part of them to his own nominees by 1205. In the meantime Lacy acted on King John's behalf in negotiations with Cathal O Conchobhair, king of Connacht, and between Meiler fitz Henry and William de Burgh. On 31 August 1204 the king addressed a letter jointly to the justiciar and Walter de Lacy ordering the summons to the king of Lacy's former ally John de Courcy. If Courcy failed to respond, eight cantreds of his land nearest Mide were to be granted to Lacy and to his brother Hugh. Walter assisted Hugh in the expulsion of Courcy from Ulster, and when in 1205 Courcy attempted to retake Ulster by force with the help of his brother-in-law Ragnvald, king of Man, it was Walter de Lacy who repulsed them. On 30 June 1205 the king ordered Meiler fitz Henry as justiciar to take heed of the advice of Hugh de Lacy, newly created earl of Ulster, who was to be his coadjutor, and of Walter. 
Walter de Lacy's ties with his father-in-law, William de Briouze, probably served only to extend to Lacy the mistrust that John already felt towards Briouze; in any case the king was suspicious of the power of magnates like Lacy, Briouze, and William (I) Marshal, who held substantial lands both in the Welsh marches and in Ireland. On 2 November 1204 the king had instructed Lacy to hand over to Meiler fitz Henry Limerick, custody of which Lacy was exercising on behalf of Briouze. By 23 August 1205 the king had changed tack and restored the custody of Limerick to Briouze, on whose behalf Lacy was still acting, provided that Briouze gave sureties for arrears that he owed for the farm and tallage of the city. A drastic deterioration in Lacy's relations with the king was signalled on 21 February 1207, when John addressed a letter to the barons of Mide and Leinster thanking them for their loyalty in the dispute between Meiler fitz Henry and Walter de Lacy over the city of Limerick. On 14 April 1207 Lacy was summoned to England to answer charges, pending the hearing of which his lands in Ireland were not to be confiscated. On 26 May 1207 the king had to rebuke his barons in Leinster and Mide for demands that they had made of his justiciar, seeking restoration of Ui Failge in north Leinster to the lord of Leinster, William Marshal, without the consent of the king. Meiler had earlier taken Ui Failge into the king's hand by royal order. There was then a concerted move by William Marshal and Walter de Lacy against Meiler, who was a tenant of both magnates. A substantial force from Leinster harried the lands that Meiler held of Lacy in Mide and besieged the castle of Ardnurcher for five weeks; shortly thereafter Meiler was taken prisoner and obliged to give hostages for his good conduct to William Marshal's wife, Isabel, at Kilkenny Castle. Thus forced to compromise, by 5 December the king had reached an accommodation with Lacy, granting him custody of the cantred of Ardmayle, Tipperary. On 19 March 1208 Meiler was instructed that Lacy enjoyed the king's peace and that Meiler was not to wage war on him, his men, or his lands in Ireland. On 24 April 1208 Lacy received a revised charter confirming Mide for fifty knights' fees, but under more restricted terms. 
The period of harmony between John and the Anglo-Norman magnates did not last. By 1210, when John mounted an expedition in person to Ireland, Walter de Lacy's relations with the king had again worsened. He became embroiled in the conflict between John and his father-in-law, William de Briouze, after Briouze had fallen from grace, rebelled, and fled across the Irish Sea. After the king's landing in Ireland, Lacy's seneschal, William Petit, proffered submission on his behalf to John on 28 June 1210, seeking to dissociate Lacy from the plunder committed by his brother Hugh in Ulster and Mide, and pleading that both Walter and his tenants had suffered much at the hands of Hugh. Nevertheless, Walter de Lacy's English and Irish estates were confiscated by the king. The profits accruing to the crown from the lordship of Mide are indicated in detail on the surviving Irish pipe roll from John's reign for 1211/12 and amounted to a substantial annual income in excess of $770, not including renders in kind. 
The baronial revolt in England afforded an opportunity for Walter de Lacy's reconciliation with King John. The alliance formed between the baronial opposition and the Welsh ruler Llywelyn ab Iorwerth threatened the security of the Welsh marches and made Lacy a natural ally of the king. On 1 July 1213 John granted Walter permission to travel to England, probably from Normandy. On 29 July 1213 his English lands were restored, except Ludlow Castle, which was not recovered until 1215. Lacy took part in John's expedition to Poitou in 1214. On 5 July 1215 he recovered his Irish lands, apart from the castle of Drogheda, having proffered 40,000 marks. His son was to remain as a hostage until full payment was completed. On 18 August 1216 Lacy was appointed castellan and sheriff of Hereford (an office that he exercised until Henry III's partial coming of age in November 1223). On 30 August 1216 he was appointed 'custos' of the vacant see of Hereford. He was a witness to King John's will at Newark in October 1216. 
Lacy played an important part in ensuring the loyalty of the Welsh marches during the civil war, and he subsequently served on the early council of regency at the beginning of Henry III's minority. These activities allowed him little time to visit his estates in Mide, and he appears to have looked to his half-brother, William Gorm (died 1233), whose mother was a daughter of Ruaidri Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht, to represent his interests there. William had been taken captive by King John during his Irish expedition, but Lacy negotiated his release by 10 February 1215. The annals of Clonmacnoise recount that William's arrival in Ireland in 1215 aroused 'great contention and wars between the English of the south of Ireland' ('Annals of Clonmacnoise', 228), obliging Lacy to give the king security for the past excesses and future behaviour of his half-brother. 
In 1220 Walter de Lacy was back in Ireland after a ten-year absence. He led a great hosting against O Raghallaig of east Breifne and captured his crannog (island fortification) on Lough Oughter. In 1221 Lacy granted Breifne from Lough Oughter to Lough Erne to his vassal, Philip de Angulo; however, a letter written in 1224 by Cathal O Conchobhair, king of Connacht, to Henry III complained that Breifne had been seized by William Gorm. About 1223 Lacy's brother Hugh, having failed to negotiate the recovery of the earldom of Ulster that King John had taken from him, arrived in Ireland and proceeded to wage war against the Anglo-Norman colonists in alliance with Aodh O Neill, king of Tir Eoghain. By 10 June 1224, when Walter de Lacy and the justiciar William (II) Marshal were sent to restore order, war had engulfed Mide and Ulster. In consideration of the excesses committed by the men of Mide in harbouring Hugh de Lacy and pillaging the king's land, Walter had been obliged about March 1224 to agree to the delivery of his castles of Ludlow and Trim into the king's hand for two years. On 13 May 1225 Walter de Lacy was charged 3000 marks for recovery of his Irish lands which had been taken by the king 'because of the war waged against the king by Hugh de Lacy in Ireland' ('Rotuli litterarum clausarum', 2.39b). 
Walter de Lacy's fines to the king in 1198, 1213, and 1225, together with his castle building activities in Mide and on the Welsh marches, as well as his ecclesiastical benefactions, involved him in considerable financial liabilities. None the less he was able to make donations in Ireland to Llanthony Prima, Gwent, which had a cell at Duleek in Meath, and Llanthony Secunda, Gloucestershire, which had a cell at Colp, also in Meath, to Fore Priory, Westmeath, and to St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin; he founded a house of Benedictine nuns at Ballymore Loughswedy in Westmeath and a small Cistercian house at Beybeg, Meath, as a daughter house of Beaubec in Normandy, and a Grandmontine house at Craswell, Herefordshire. For more than two decades before his death in 1241 he was heavily reliant on money loans from Jewish financiers to service his debts. A plea roll of the exchequer of the Jews of 1244, which records details of debts owing in that year to the family of Hamo of Hereford, reveals that at the time of his death Walter de Lacy was in debt to Hamo to the sum of $1266 13's'. 4died During the minority of Henry III Lacy had been able to postpone payment of the annual sums due from his fines; the fact that he was sheriff of Hereford from 1216 to 1223 had also facilitated mutually advantageous relations with Hamo. However, after Hamo's death in 1232, when his family had to meet a relief of 6000 marks imposed by the crown, it became necessary for them to pursue creditors more urgently. Following representations by a number of Jews for recovery of debts owed by Lacy, the crown on 19 November 1240 issued orders for the distraint of his estates. 
At the time of his death in early 1241, apparently before 28 February, Walter de Lacy was blind and feeble, bankrupt, and without male heirs. His only son, Gilbert, who married Isabella, daughter of Ralph Bigod, died in 1234, leaving a son, Walter, and two daughters, Matilda and Margaret. This Walter was alive in 1238, and married a daughter of Theobald Butler (d. 1205), but predeceased his grandfather without heirs. Henry III took this opportunity to dispense patronage by arranging the marriages of the Lacy sisters, now coheirs of the Lacy estates, to noted royal servants. Margaret married John de Verdon, and Matilda married Pierre de Genevre and afterwards Geoffrey de Geneville.

Lacy, Walter (1809-1898), actor, the son of a coach builder named Williams in Bristol, was educated for the medical profession and went as a young man to Australia. He was first seen on the stage in Edinburgh, in 1829, as Montalban in 'The Honeymoon', played there again in 1832, and acted also in Glasgow, Liverpool, and Manchester. 
Lacy's London debut was at the Haymarket, on 21 August 1838, as Charles Surface. On 22 June 1839 he married Harriett Deborah Taylor (1807-1874), an actress ['see 'Lacy, Harriett Deborah]. At Covent Garden he appeared, about 1841, as Captain Absolute opposite Madame Vestris and at Drury Lane as Wildrake in Sheridan Knowles's 'The Love Chase'. He then joined Charles Kean at the Princess's for seven years. On 18 September 1852 he created the part of Rouble in Boucicault's 'The Prima Donna', and he made a great success as Chateau Renaud in 'The Corsican Brothers'. Opposite Kean, he played John of Gaunt in 'Richard II', Edmund in 'King Lear', Gratiano, and Lord Trinket in Colman's 'The Jealous Wife'. On 30 June 1860, at the Lyceum, he performed the Marquis of Saint Evremont in 'A Tale of Two Cities', and at Drury Lane, on 17 October 1864, was Cloten to Helen Faucit's Imogen. He appeared as Flutter in 'The Belle's Stratagem' on 8 October 1866 at the St James's, where he was, on 5 November, the first John Leigh in Boucicault's 'Hunted Down, or, Two Lives of John Leigh'. He played Mercutio in two Lyceum revivals of 'Romeo and Juliet'. On 12 August 1868 he was, at the Princess's, the original Bellingham in Boucicault's 'After Dark'. 
Other parts in which Lacy was seen were Benedick, Comus, Faulconbridge, Malvolio, Touchstone, Prospero, Roderigo, Henry VIII, Young Marlow, Sir Brilliant Fashion, Goldfinch, Tony Lumpkin, Bob Acres, Dazzle, Flutter, Dudley Smooth, Megrim in 'Blue Devils', the Ghost in 'Hamlet', My Lord Duke in James Townley's farce 'High Life below Stairs', Jeremy Diddler, and Puff. After a long absence from the stage, occupied as professor of elocution at the Royal Academy of Music, Lacy reappeared at the Lyceum in April 1879 as Colonel Damas in Sir Henry Irving's revival of 'The Lady of Lyons'. He died on 13 December 1898 at his home, 13 Marine Square, Brighton, and was buried at Brompton cemetery on the 17th. 
Lacy was a respectable light comedian, but failed as an exponent of old men and was a wretched Sir Anthony Absolute. He was a familiar figure at the Garrick Club, and was almost to the last a man of much vivacity, and of quaint, clever, unbridled, and characteristic speech.

Lacy, William (c.1610-1671), Church of England clergyman, was the son of Thomas Lacy of Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Franceys of Beckingham, Nottinghamshire. His date of birth is derived from the information that he was aged fifty-six (or in his fifty-sixth year) in 1666. The Lacy family had long been known for recusancy and in September 1631 Thomas was examined by the president of the council in the north for alleged involvement in furthering the Catholic cause. William Lacy was admitted, probably before 1629, to St John's College, Cambridge, graduated BA in 1632, and proceeded MA in 1636. Admitted as a fellow of his college on 5 April 1636, he acted as tutor during 1640-42. He proceeded BD in 1642 and was made preacher at St John's at Michaelmas 1643. 
Lacy was a co-author with John Barwick and others of 'Certain Disquisitions and Considerations Representing to the Conscience the Unlawfulness of the Oath Entituled, a Solemn League and Covenant' (1644); the sheets were seized by the parliamentarians, but the book was reprinted at Oxford. Ejected from his fellowship in 1644 Lacy attached himself to the royalist army, and evidently became chaplain to Prince Rupert, for he was present at the storming of Bridgwater by Sir Thomas Fairfax on 23 July 1645 and was listed shortly afterwards as 'Lacy, priest to Prince Rupert' ('Fairfax's Letter', 6). In prison, he soon became impoverished, but survived thanks to the generosity of John Barwick. It seems that Lacy inherited his father's property at Beverley, though he may have been forced to sell. On 19 April 1648 he was listed as one of the Hampshire persons already sequestrated. Before 1 September 1651 he compounded for a fine of $26, one-sixth of the value of his estate, but on 21 November of the same year he claimed in a deposition to the committee of 'debts he owed to several persons before 20 May 1642, total $44. Also that $30 debts, for which he compounded, have since become desperate, and are not likely to be paid' (Green, 3.1382). 
On the return of Charles II, Lacy was restored to his fellowship by a warrant from the earl of Manchester dated 27 August 1660 and executed on 2 November. He was also presented by the king on 1 October 1660 to the prebend of South Cave in the diocese of York, but the appointment did not take effect and the prebend lapsed. At Cambridge, Lacy was admitted on 4 November 1661 to a senior fellowship; he was recommended by the king for the degree of DD on 3 October 1662, an honour awarded the following year. In 1669 he contributed $5 towards the building of the third court at St John's College. On 13 October 1662, now aged over fifty, at St Mary's Church, Leicester, Lacy married one Ann Dan (died 1686), a widow; this was probably Ann, daughter of William Sherman, a gentleman of Newark, Lincolnshire, baptized in the same parish on 11 January 1618; the couple appear to have had one child, a son, William, who was born on 25 July 1663 but who was buried a few days later on 12 August. Ten days after his marriage, on 23 October 1662, Lacy was presented by Sir George Savile to the rectory of Thornhill, near Dewsbury, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in the place of the ejected minister. The parish register records that on 8 November 1662 'Dr Will. Lacy inducted into the Rectory of Thornhill and Joshua Witton overturned' (Charlesworth, 1.172). There he rebuilt the rectory house, destroyed during the civil wars. It was evidently a very substantial building, for Lacy was assessed in 1666 for nine hearths. 
Lacy died at Thornhill on 12 May 1671 and was buried next day in the church, where a stone was laid to his memory. In his will, dated 7 September 1670, he provided $350 in reversion, for two exhibitions of $8 each, to be taken up at St John's by boys from Beverley grammar school.

Lacy, William (1788-1871), singer, was a pupil of Venanzio Rauzzini (1747-1810) at Bath about 1795. He appeared at various concerts in London a few years later before going to Italy for further study. Lacy had an excellent bass voice, with especially fine lower notes, and while in Italy he was offered lucrative engagements at the Milan and Florence operas. On his return to England soon after 1800, he frequently sang at the Lenten oratorios and at other important concerts, but poor health prevented him from pursuing a successful career in England. 
In 1812 Lacy married 
In 1818 the Lacys accepted an engagement in Calcutta, where they remained for seven years, giving frequent performances at the court of Oudh. After returning to England about 1826 they retired into private life. For some years they lived in Florence, but eventually settled in England; Jane Lacy died at Ealing on 19 March 1858, William Lacy in July 1871 while on a visit to Devon.

Henry Ladbrooke (1800-1869), the second son, was born at Norwich on 20 April 1800. His early desire to enter the church was discouraged by his father, and Henry Ladbrooke became the pupil of his uncle John Crome. He acquired a reputation as a landscape painter, especially for his moonlight scenes, and exhibited intermittently at the Norwich Society of Artists between 1818 and 1833. He then exhibited at the British Institution in 1834 and 1836 as well as at the Suffolk Street Gallery between 1836 and 1865. With his wife, Elizabeth Mary (1795/6-1873), he had two sons and three daughters, of whom two became schoolmistresses. He worked as a drawing-master, first in North Walsham, and later in Valenger's Road, King's Lynn, and was assisted in his teaching by his daughter, Fanny. He died in Norwich on 18 November 1869 and was buried at Norwich cemetery.

John Berney Ladbrooke (1803-1879), Robert Ladbrooke's third son, was born on 31 October 1803 in Norfolk. His middle name was sometimes spelt Barney. He studied under his uncle John Crome, whose style he acquired, and excelled in the representation of woodland scenery. He exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821, 1822, and 1843 as well as at the British Institution between 1823 and 1859 and at the Suffolk Street Gallery up to 1873. He worked as a drawing-master in Norwich, and at some stage before 1850 he made a tour of the Netherlands and France. He was married to Hannah (1798/9-1867), but appears to have had no children. The fruit and flower painter Maria Louisa Margitson (1830-1896) was his niece. In 1859 he built a house and studio on Mousehold Heath, Norfolk, which was named Kett's Castle Villa. He died at the house on 11 July 1879 and was buried at the Rosary cemetery.

Ladbrooke, Robert (1768-1842), landscape painter, was born at Norwich. Little is known of his early life, though his parents are said to have been humble. He was apprenticed early to an artist and printer named White, and for several years worked as a journeyman printer. As an apprentice he met and befriended John Crome, his contemporary, who was working for a house and sign painter. They became firm friends, sharing a small studio and devoting their spare time to sketching and copying. On 3 October 1793 Ladbrooke married Mary Berney or Barney (died 1807) and purchased a house at Scoles Green, Norwich. He set himself up as a drawing-master and worked in partnership with Crome, who was now his brother-in-law, having married Mary Berney's sister. Initially Ladbrooke painted portraits but he subsequently turned to landscape painting, in which he established his reputation. Along with Crome, Ladbrooke took a leading part in the establishment of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1803 and, after a tour of Wales in 1804, he sent fourteen works to its first exhibition in 1805. He also sent works to the Royal Academy between 1805 and 1815. Mary Berney died in 1807, and Ladbrooke later remarried, his second wife dying in 1828. 
In 1809 Ladbrooke was nominated president of the Norwich Society of Artists; he continued to exhibit his work regularly. In 1816, with Joseph Stannard, John Thirtle, and several other members, he seceded from the society, having attempted unsuccessfully to modify some of its rules. The precise nature of the dispute is unclear but may have involved the proposed exclusion of amateurs from the society and questions about financial management. Ladbrooke's faction formed a rival society and held their own exhibitions in a hall adjoining the Shakespeare tavern on Theatre Plain, Norwich. This venture, however, proved a failure, and was abandoned after only three years. Ladbrooke therefore sent works to the British Institution for exhibition in 1819, 1820, and 1822. Between 1821 and 1822 he devoted himself to a collection of 700 lithographs of Norfolk churches with the assistance of his son John Berney Ladbrooke ['see below']. This project was published only posthumously in five volumes in 1843. By 1822 Ladbrooke's interests in art dealing and picture framing allowed him to hand over his work as a drawing-master to his son. In 1824 he was reconciled with the Norwich Society of Artists under the presidency of his nephew, John Berney Crome; he sent two paintings to the exhibition that year and continued to send works intermittently until 1833. Success in business ventures led him to retire many years before his death, and in these later years Ladbrooke began to invest in property, leaving a significant estate including land in Beer Street and the Shakespeare tavern at his death on 11 October 1842 at his house on Scoles Green. He was buried at St Stephen's, Norwich. 
Few of Ladbrooke's paintings appear to have survived. He published aquatints of two of his pictures, 'A View of the Fellmongers on the River Near Bishop's Bridge' and 'A View of Norwich Castle', besides the posthumous 'Views of the Churches of Norfolk'. Two of Ladbrooke's sons were well-known artists.

Ladyman, Samuel (1625/6-1684), Church of Ireland clergyman, was probably born at Dinton, Buckinghamshire, the son of John Ladyman. Aged seventeen, Ladyman, a servitor, matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 3 March 1643, graduating BA on 13 July 1647. Appointed a fellow by the parliamentary visitors in 1648, he proceeded MA on 21 June 1649. According to Anthony Wood he began preaching in the Oxford area about this time, becoming well known in presbyterian circles. On 20 August 1652 the government allocated $50 and $20 respectively to Edward Wale and Ladyman, who were commissioned to go to Ireland with Charles Fleetwood as chaplains. They departed the next month, sailing from Bristol to Waterford. In Ireland, Ladyman became the minister at Clonmel, perhaps at the suggestion of Joseph Eyres, his friend and contemporary at Corpus Christi. Initially Ladyman received $100 per annum at Clonmel, but in 1655 he was earning $170. When Edward Worth founded the Cork Association in 1657, initially to ordain ministers but with the ultimate goal of imposing uniformity through a national church, Ladyman and Eyres participated. Henry Cromwell invited Ladyman and approximately thirty other clergymen to Dublin in the spring of 1658 to discuss church finances and other issues. With eighteen others Ladyman drafted an address to Cromwell in May, praising his support of protestantism and interest in settling clerical maintenance. Although Cromwell invited Ladyman to move to Dublin, he opted to remain at Clonmel. 
Ladyman's only published work is 'The Dangerous Rule' (1658), from a sermon preached at Clonmel before the Munster judges on 3 August 1657. In it he articulated the defining characteristic of his career, namely, the subordination of conscience to 'the guidance and superintendency of known Laws' (p. 8). Conscience, he argued, is defective, uncertain, and arbitrary unless guided by law, and it must therefore be subordinate to understanding. If the consciences of the few become a law for all, the result is tyranny. He pointed to Jan of Leyden and the Quakers as examples of what could happen if claims of conscience were pre-eminent, and he urged his readers to 'behold the Monstrosity & rugged deformity of Conscience, when seated upon the Throne, as Queen Regent; whilst standing Laws are constrain'd to lie gasping under her Imperious Feet' (ibid., sig. a1'v'). Freedom of opinion, he warned, would lead to liberty in practice and the destruction of people's souls. 
On the eve of the Restoration, Ladyman was one of the twenty highest-paid clergymen in Ireland, earning $200 in 1659. He was now assisted at Clonmel by Galatius Hickey, formerly a minister in the diocese of Killaloe. True to his belief in the supremacy of law Ladyman conformed at the Restoration, remaining at Clonmel as vicar, though he did not undergo episcopal ordination until February 1665. Three years later as archdeacon of Limerick he was receiving $120 per annum. By 1677 Dr Ladyman was prebendary of Cashel. His wife, Grace, daughter of Dr William Hutchinson of Oxford, whom Ladyman had married before 1655, had died in March 1663 or 1664. Three of their children, Samuel, Francis, and Grace, died in infancy, and the others died young -- John on 9 December 1675, aged twenty, and Jane on 27 September 1681, aged twenty-one. Following his own death in February 1684 Ladyman was interred in the chancel of St Mary's, Clonmel. By his will, he left $5 per annum for the education of ten poor children, and $5 per annum to be distributed in alms.

Loegaire mac Neill (fl. 5th cent.), high-king of Ireland, was a son of Niall Noigiallach, ancestor of the Ui Neill dynasties. He is associated with three elements of Irish mythology: the arrival of Patrick, the cattle tribute (or 'boroma'), and the Feast of Tara. His reign was dated by the seventh-century hagiographer Tirechan to about 427-63, but many or all of the dates associated with Loegaire are based on the artificially constructed chronology surrounding St Patrick and it has been suggested that he died as late as the 480s. 
According to the hagiographer Muirchu moccu Mactheni, who wrote 'c'.700, Loegaire, 'a great king, fierce and pagan, an emperor of barbarians' (Bieler, 74-7), dominated Ireland at the time of Patrick's arrival. One night he was celebrating a pagan festival at Tara, and it was forbidden for anyone to kindle a fire before the king's was alight. However, it was also Easter eve and Patrick lit a fire which was visible from Tara. Loegaire's druids advised the king that the other fire should be put out that night, for it would otherwise never be extinguished. Patrick was summoned to Loegaire and shamed the king's druids and advisers by a series of spectacular and violent miracles. A number of attempts were made by the king and others to kill Patrick, who warned Loegaire that he must accept the faith or die. Having taken the counsel of his people, the king submitted, and was told by Patrick: 'Since you have resisted my teaching and been offensive to me, the days of your own reign shall run on, but none of your offspring shall ever be king' (ibid., 96-9). This curse served to explain the marginal status of Cenel Loegairi, a Brega dynasty which traced itself to Loegaire. 
Muirchu's account differs from that of Tirechan, who said that Loegaire remained a pagan in spite of Patrick's miracles. He had been bidden by his late father not to accept the faith but to be given a warrior's burial on the hill of Tara, bearing arms, his face towards Leinster. Loegaire's hostility to Leinster is also seen in the chronicles, which indicate that his military activities were primarily against that province. The sons of Niall Noigiallach are said to have been bequeathed various attributes belonging to their father, and fittingly Loegaire inherited 'warfare'. 
Loegaire's kingship is acknowledged by the chronicles, which say that he held the 'Feast of Tara'. This was probably originally a pagan ritual and it was celebrated only by the king of Tara, an office which later in the middle ages reflected a claim to the kingship of Ireland. Loegaire is universally accepted as king of Ireland by the regnal lists, but at such an early date neither he nor any other king can have enjoyed such authority. However, he may have ruled Connacht, for, according to Tirechan, Patrick encountered Loegaire's daughters at the royal site of Rathcroghan, in Roscommon. 
Loegaire is connected with legal matters in two notable ways: Tirechan shows him acting as a judge (along with Patrick) in a dispute about an inheritance; and the prologue to the law code 'Senchas Mar' says that Loegaire summoned together the best of the men of Ireland, including Patrick, in order to discuss the arrangement of their laws. In the event, Loegaire was only one of nine men entrusted by Patrick with the Christianizing of the laws, which became the 'Senchas Mar'. 
The medieval 'boroma' saga tells of the heavy tribute which Leinster was expected to pay to the king of Ireland in reparation for an ancient treachery. Loegaire invaded Leinster in order to exact the tribute and was captured following his defeat in the battle of Ath Dara. He was freed on a promise that he would remit the tribute and named the elements as his sureties. However, within three years he returned to Leinster and seized cattle. As a consequence of this he died by the elements: the sun burned him, the earth swallowed him, and the wind (that is, his breath) departed from him. However, there are alternative versions of his death. One account says that he died as a result of a curse by Patrick. Another says that there was a prophecy that he would die between Ireland and Britain. He tried to evade his fate by never going to sea, but the prophecy was fulfilled when he died between two hills called Ireland and Britain. 
Tirechan names two of Loegaire's daughters, and twelve sons are attributed to him, the mother of one of them being Muirecht ingen Echdach Muinremuir. He is also said to have been married to Angas ingen Ailella Tassaig of the Eoganachta dynasties of Munster.

Loegaire Lorc (supp. fl. c.300 BC), legendary king of Leinster, was the son of Augaine Mar and is said to have been also king of Ireland. He was described as 'senathair Laigen', 'the ancestor of the Leinstermen', and all kindreds who regarded themselves as true Laigin (Leinstermen) traced their descent back to Loegaire Lorc. Lorcmag, 'the plain of Lorc', was used by medieval literati to describe the territory of the Leinstermen. The epithet 'lorc' is variously explained as meaning 'fierce, dumb, tongue-tied'. The trait of dumbness, often associated with deities, links Loegaire Lorc with his renowned grandson and other ancestor of the Laigin, Labraid Loingsech, whose original name was Moen, 'the dumb one'. They may ultimately be regarded as one character. 
Loegaire Lorc is one of the main protagonists in the original legend of the Laigin, 'Orgain Denna Rig', 'The destruction of Dind Rig', which in its earliest written form may date to the seventh century. Cobthach Coel Breg, 'Cobthach the Thin of Brega', one of the reputed ancestors of the midland and northern dynasty, the Ui Neill, became jealous of Loegaire and of his kingship of Leinster. The legend describes Cobthach and Loegaire as brothers. Cobthach tricked Loegaire into believing that he was dead and when Loegaire came to grieve over his brother's body which was laid out in a chariot, Cobthach stabbed and mortally wounded him. An alternative version relates how Cobthach killed Loegaire at the battle of Carman, the site where the kings of Leinster were inaugurated in the medieval period. This foul deed perpetrated by Cobthach is described as 'fingal', 'kin slaying', and is used to explain the continuous enmity between Cobthach's descendants, the Ui Neill, and Loegaire's descendants, the Laigin. This act of kin slaying was avenged by Loegaire's grandson, Labraid Loingsech, who returned from exile, seized the kingship of Leinster, and burned Cobthach in an iron house at Dind Rig (claimed to be a site on the River Barrow near Leighlinbridge, co. Carlow).

Laffan, Sir Joseph de Courcy, baronet (1786-1848), physician, third son of Walter Laffan of Cashel, Ireland, and Eleonora, daughter and coheir of Richard de Courcy, a distant relative of the family of Kinsale, was born at Cashel on 8 May 1786. His eldest brother was Robert Laffan (died 1833), Roman Catholic archbishop of Cashel, and Laffan himself was originally destined for the Roman Catholic priesthood, and studied at Maynooth College. He then proceeded to Edinburgh University and turned his attention to medicine. He graduated MD on 24 June 1808, and became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in London on 22 December 1808. From then until 1812, he practised in London, in Orchard Street, Portman Square. 
In October 1809 Laffan offered his services to the government on behalf of the fever-stricken troops lately returned from the Walcheren expedition. These were accepted, and the aptitude which Laffan showed for military practice led to his appointment in 1811 as physician to the forces, and later as assistant inspector of hospitals. He served in Spain and Portugal during the latter part of the Peninsular War, and he was eventually made physician-in-ordinary to the duke of Kent. At the end of the war Laffan stayed in Paris, and practised there with brilliant success until the desire for a more peaceful life led him to Rochester in Kent. In 1815 he married Jemima (died 1839), daughter of Paul Pilcher of Rochester, and widow of Michael Symes, formerly English envoy at Ava, in Burma. 
Laffan's successful treatment of an illness of the duke of York, brother to George IV, led to his being created a baronet by patent dated 15 March 1828. He was gentleman of the bedchamber to the lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1829, and in 1836 he was also created a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order. 
After the death of his wife Laffan settled in Otham, Kent, having retired because of ill health. He died at Vichy in France on 7 July 1848; as he left no children the baronetcy became extinct. His body was returned to Rochester and interred there in a family vault in St Margaret's Church, also in 1848. Laffan devoted the greater part of his wealth to found a cancer ward for women in the Middlesex Hospital.

Laffan, Sir Robert Michael (1819-1882), army officer, third son of John Laffan of Skehanagh, co. Clare, and his wife, Susan (or Susanna), 'nee' Kerin (died 1852), was born on 14 August 1819. Educated at the college of Pontlevoy, near Blois, France, he went to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in September 1835, and on 5 May 1837 was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. 
After two years at Chatham and Woolwich, and becoming first lieutenant on 1 April 1839, Laffan was sent to south Africa and employed in frontier service. He was one of the officers summoned by the governor, Sir George Napier, to plan the relief of Colonel Smith and the garrison of Natal, then beleaguered by Boers under Pretorius. Laffan organized the engineering arrangements of the expedition under Sir Josiah Cloete, which relieved the British garrison. 
From the Cape, Laffan was sent to Mauritius, where he was promoted captain on 1 May 1846. On his return home in 1847 he was appointed commanding royal engineer at Belfast, and at the close of the year was nominated an inspector of railways under the Board of Trade, an office he held until 1852. On 29 April 1852 he married Emma, daughter of W. Norsworthy. They had one daughter and four sons, and she survived him. Their eldest son, Robert Stuart de Courcy Laffan, became an early promoter of the Olympic movement. 
In July 1852 Laffan was elected Conservative MP for St Ives. He retained the seat until March 1857. In the autumn of 1852 he was sent to Paris and Antwerp to report on their defences for Sir John Burgoyne, inspector-general of fortifications. In 1854 he was appointed commanding royal engineer in the London district, and in 1855 he was sent by the duke of Newcastle, secretary of state for war, with two others to report on the organization of the French ministry of war. On his return to England in May 1855 Laffan was appointed deputy inspector-general of fortifications. He was promoted major on 26 October 1858 and lieutenant-colonel on 28 November 1859. 
From 1858 to 1860 Laffan was on sick leave in the south of France and Switzerland. On his return he was stationed at Portsmouth for a short time, but in late 1860 he was sent to Malta as commanding royal engineer. He remained there for five years, during which the armament of the defences was modernized. He was promoted brevet colonel on 28 November 1864. 
In 1865 Laffan was sent to Ceylon as a member of a commission on its defence and also reported to the secretary of state for war on the Suez Canal. In 1866 he was appointed commanding royal engineer at Aldershot, where he devised manoeuvres and transformed the appearance of the camp by planting trees and grass: the former Queen's Birthday Parade was later renamed Laffan's Plain in his memory. In January 1872 he was sent to Gibraltar as commanding royal engineer, and remained there five years. 
On 27 April 1877 Laffan was appointed governor of the Bermudas, arriving on 7 August. On 30 May the same year he was made a KCMG, and on 2 October 1877 was promoted major-general (antedated to 8 February 1870). He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 July 1881. 
Laffan's ability made him a popular and successful governor of the Bermudas at a critical time in the political history of the colony. He restored relations with the assembly, reformed local government, and reorganized the colony's defences amid rumours of impending Fenian attack. Laffan died in Bermuda, at Mount Langton, on 22 March 1882. He was buried at St John's Church, Pembroke, Bermuda, two days later.

LaFontaine, Sir Louis-Hippolyte, first baronet (1807-1864), politician in Canada, born at Boucherville, in the county of Chambly, Lower Canada, on 4 October 1807, was the third son of Antoine Menard, called LaFontaine (1772-1814), a carpenter, and his wife, Marie-Josephte Fontaine, called Bienvenue, and the grandson of Antoine Menard Lafontaine, a member of the legislative assembly of Lower Canada. He was educated at Montreal, and in 1825 proceeded to study law by entering the office of Francois Roy. His political reputation was considerable while he was yet a clerk, and after his call to the bar in 1828 he quickly acquired a large practice among French Canadians. On 9 July 1831 he married Adele (died 1859), the daughter of Amable Berthelot. He was returned to the legislative assembly of Lower Canada at the general election of 1830 for the county of Terrebonne, for which he continued to sit until 1837. He was at first a follower of Louis-Joseph Papineau, whom he vigorously urged on in his resistance to the British government. But as the 'parti patriote' became more intransigent he began to seek compromise. At the outbreak of rebellion in 1837, he travelled to Westminster to plead unsuccessfully for constitutional reform. On the outbreak of a second rebellion in November 1838 he was imprisoned, but released without trial. He then became the leader of the French-Canadian moderate reformers. 
Although LaFontaine considered it fundamentally unjust, he did not oppose the union of Upper and Lower Canada in 1840. On 21 September 1841, after contesting Terrebonne unsuccessfully, he was returned to the parliament of the united provinces for the fourth riding of York, a county in Upper Canada, chiefly through the influence of Robert Baldwin. He was at once recognized as the leader of the French Canadians in the new assembly. In September 1842, on the urging of the governor-general, Sir Charles Bagot, he formed the LaFontaine-Baldwin administration, in which he held the portfolio of attorney-general for the lower province. During his term of office he obtained a cessation of proceedings against the rebels of 1837, including Papineau. The ministry resigned on 28 November 1843 in consequence of a difference with Bagot's successor, Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe (afterwards Baron Metcalfe), with regard to the control of the nomination of government officials. In November 1844 LaFontaine was again returned for Terrebonne, which he represented during the whole period of his opposition. In March 1848, after a stormy election in which several people were killed, he was returned for the city of Montreal, which he represented during the remainder of his public life. 
In March 1848 the Reform Party triumphed at the general election, and LaFontaine was commissioned by the governor-general, Lord Elgin, to form a ministry based on the principle of responsible government. He thus became the first prime minister of Canada in the modern sense of the term. During this, his second, administration, he demonstrated the achievement of responsible government by the passage of the 'Rebellion Losses Bill', despite fierce opposition and violent demonstrations. His ministry also passed an 'Amnesty Act' to forgive the 1837-8 rebels, secularized King's College into the University of Toronto, incorporated many French-Canadian colleges, established Laval University, adopted important railway legislation, and reformed municipal and judicial institutions. LaFontaine retired from political life towards the close of 1851, and was created a baronet on 28 August 1854. 
His first wife having died in 1859, on 30 January 1861 LaFontaine married Julie-Elizabeth-Genevieve 
(Jane; 1822-1905)
, the widow of Thomas Kinton, a merchant of Montreal. They had one surviving son, Louis-Hippolyte, on whose death, in 1867, the baronetcy became extinct. On 13 August 1853 LaFontaine was nominated chief justice of Lower Canada, and continued to hold the office until his death, at his home in Montreal, on 26 February 1864, following an apoplectic fit the previous day. He was buried on 29 February in the Cote-des-Neiges cemetery, Montreal.

Sir Francis Laforey (1767-1835), was born in Virginia on 31 December 1767 and also joined the navy. He was promoted lieutenant on 26 August 1789, commander on 22 November 1790, and captain on 5 June 1793. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1796, and commanded the 'Spartiate' at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Laforey was promoted rear-admiral on 31 July 1810 and was commander-in-chief on the Leeward Islands station between 1811 and 1814. He was made KCB on 2 January 1815, and promoted vice-admiral on 12 August 1819 and admiral on 22 July 1830. He died, unmarried, on 17 June 1835 at Brighton and the baronetcy became extinct.

Laforey, Sir John, first baronet (1729?-1796), naval officer, was the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Laforey (died 1753), governor of Pendennis Castle, and Mary Clayton, daughter of Lieutenant-General Jasper Clayton. He was descended from the French Huguenot family of La Foret which settled in England during the 1690s. On 12 April 1748 he was promoted lieutenant, and on 24 May 1755 Commodore Augustus Keppel made him commander of the 'Ontario'. In the 'Hunter' he was with Admiral Edward Boscawen's fleet at Louisbourg in 1758. On 25 July he commanded a force of boats which burnt the 'Prudent' and captured the 'Bienfaisant' in Louisbourg harbour, and he was posted captain of the 'Echo' by Boscawen on the following day. He took part in the conquest of Quebec in 1759 and then served in the West Indies, taking part in Admiral George Rodney's capture of Martinique in 1762. At Antigua in 1763 he married Eleanor, daughter of Colonel Francis Farley, member of the council and one of the judges of that island. Laforey commanded the 'Pallas' for a short time in 1770. He commissioned the 'Ocean' in September 1776 and in her took part in the battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778; at the subsequent court martial he gave evidence supporting Admiral Keppel. 
In November 1779 Laforey was appointed naval commissioner on the Leeward Islands station, his principal duty being to speed up repairs and cleaning of warships at English Harbour dockyard, Antigua, where he was based. Because naval captains sometimes refused to obey Laforey, claiming he did not have a military commission and was merely a civilian in charge of the dockyard, Rodney reinforced his authority by making him a commodore in August 1780. Unfortunately Laforey later fell out with Rodney over the purchase of naval stores captured at St Eustatius in 1781. Admiral Hugh Pigot replaced Rodney in 1782, but although he was also a supporter of Keppel, Laforey had disagreements with him about the purchase and commissioning of prizes. After the peace in 1783 Laforey returned to England and became naval commissioner at Plymouth Dockyard. He was still there when he was passed over in a promotion of flag officers on 24 September 1787. As in the disputes over his authority during the American War of Independence, it was alleged that his post was only a civil appointment. He challenged the decision and was eventually promoted rear-admiral on 10 November 1789, but with seniority to date from 24 September 1787. He was also created a baronet on 2 December 1789 and was appointed commander-in-chief on the Leeward Islands station. 
Laforey was promoted vice-admiral on 1 February 1793; he was still in the West Indies when war broke out with France, and in April 1793 he captured Tobago. He returned to England in July, but was re-appointed to the Leeward Islands command in 1795, going out in the 'Amiable', commanded by his son, Francis Laforey ['see below']. He became an admiral on 1 June 1795. During 1795-6 he helped suppress slave revolts on St Vincent, Grenada, and Dominica, while capturing the Dutch colonies of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice. In 1796 he handed over naval command to Sir Hugh Christian before the planned attack on St Lucia and sailed for England in the 'Majestic'. He died at sea of yellow fever on 14 June 1796 and was buried in the governor's chapel at Portsmouth on 21 June. At the time of his death he owned a number of plantations in Antigua.

John Laguerre (c.1700-1748) and Louis ('bap'. 5 Jan 1717) were also painters, though John, the elder, became better known as a stage singer, performing as a baritone in John Rich's company at Lincoln's Inn Fields from 1721 to 1740; he married the dancer and actress Mary Rogier (died 1739) in 1724, and until her death they always worked together. He also sang in Handel's operas, including the first public performance of 'Acis and Galatea' in March 1731, as Corydon. After his wife's death his theatrical career declined; he was imprisoned for debt in 1741, but was allowed to sing at his benefit performance on 23 April that year. He made a series of drawings, 'Hob in the Well', based on the opera 'Flora' by William Bates in which Laguerre played Hob, engraved by Charles Dubose, which were popular. His portrait of the impostor Mary Tofts was engraved by John Faber. From 1746 Rich employed him as a scene painter. He died in impoverished circumstances on 28 March 1748.

Laguerre, Louis (1663-1721), painter, was born in France at Versailles, the son of the keeper of the royal menagerie there, a Catalan. Louis XIV is said to have been his godfather. Intending to join the priesthood, Laguerre was educated at the Jesuits' college in Paris, but his first career aim was thwarted by a speech impediment and, having a talent for drawing, he then studied at the Academie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. In 1682 he won third prize in the prix de Rome for a painting entitled 'Cain batit la ville d'Henoch', and another third prize the following year, for his sculpture 'Invention des forges... par Tubal-Cain'. According to George Vertue he also spent a short time in the studio of Charles le Brun, and then, about 1684, moved to England, where he first worked as an assistant to the Italian decorative painter Antonio Verrio. 
From about 1688 when he was employed at Thoresby, Nottinghamshire, Laguerre seems to have been working as a master decorator in his own right. His first major independent commission was for William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire, at Chatsworth, Derbyshire, where between 1689 and 1697 he painted at least six interiors, including the hall and chapel, with mythological and religious subjects. Thereafter he was much in demand for decorative schemes in the baroque manner. He was employed by William III at Hampton Court Palace, where his work included a series of roundels illustrating the labours of Hercules on the exterior of Fountain Court. In 1698 he painted the ballroom at Burghley House, Cambridgeshire, with scenes from the story of Anthony and Cleopatra. Other documented commissions include several interiors at Canons, Middlesex, for James Brydges, first duke of Chandos, staircases at Buckingham House and Marlborough House, London, and at Petworth House, Sussex, and the saloon at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire. An early eighteenth-century painted scheme illustrating episodes from the 'Aeneid', uncovered in the staircase hall at Frogmore House, Berkshire, in 1984, has also been attributed to Laguerre. 
Laguerre was a director of Sir Godfrey Kneller's Academy of Painting, founded in 1711. His chief rival after the death of Verrio in 1707 was a fellow director of the academy, James Thornhill. In 1715 Laguerre was awarded the commission to paint the interior of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, but 'by some political contrivance' (Vertue, 'Note books', 2.125) he was replaced by Thornhill shortly after starting work. The following year Thornhill became governor of the academy, an appointment that Laguerre might have been expected to win. Although best-known as a decorative painter of interiors on a large scale, Laguerre also painted easel pictures, including portraits, and made designs for engravings and tapestry. His restoration of 'The Triumph of Caesar' by Andrea Mantegna, at Hampton Court Palace, was praised by his contemporaries. 
In interiors Laguerre normally painted in oil on plaster, a technique commonly used by decorative painters in England from the mid-seventeenth century, in an attempt to prevent damage caused by damp. Typically the overall format for Laguerre's interior decorative schemes takes the form of mythological scenes set in fictive 'pavilions' on side walls, with columns framing the figures, and ceilings, crowded with more figures, illusionistically treated so as to appear to be open to the sky. In this Laguerre's work is similar to that of Verrio, but his manner is more sedate, and his use of colour generally more sober. Alexander Pope's reference to '

('Epistle to the Right Honourable Richard, Earl of Burlington', 1731)' memorably both links the two painters, and was written when their critical fortunes were beginning to decline. The reputations of both artists, perhaps unreasonably high in their lifetimes, have since sunk very low, probably equally unjustly, since much of their work in domestic interiors has been restored and overpainted, often many times, inhibiting assessment of its original quality.Laguerre was first married to Eleanor, daughter of Jean Tijou, the ironworker. His second wife, Sarah, survived him. His two sons 
Louis Laguerre also had two daughters, Sarah ('bap'. 26 April 1719) and Anne ('bap'. 28 Aug 1720), who, like their brother Louis, were baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, where their mother's name was recorded as Sarah. He died suddenly of apoplexy on 20 April 1721, at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, London, where his son John was performing in 'The Island Princess' as part of his first benefit. He was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields.

Laidlaw, William (bap. 1779, d. 1845), friend of Sir Walter Scott and James Hogg, was born at Blackhouse farm in Yarrow, Selkirkshire, and baptized on 28 November 1779, the eldest of three sons of James Laidlaw, tenant of Blackhouse farm, and his wife, Catherine Ballantyne. After receiving a basic education at Peebles grammar school, he assisted his father in sheep-farming. James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, served his father as a shepherd for ten years, and formed a close and lifelong friendship with Laidlaw. According to Hogg's 'Memoir', 'he was the only person who, for many years, ever pretended to discover the least merit in my essays, either in verse or prose' (Hogg, 'Memoir', 12). An even more significant literary friendship was made in 1802, when he helped to procure materials for 'The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border' for Sir Walter Scott. About 1803 Laidlaw began farming for himself at Liberton near Edinburgh, and on 8 April 1810 married his cousin Janet Ballantyne (1786-1861), of Whitehope farm in Yarrow. Of the children of the marriage four daughters survived. Laidlaw contributed three songs anonymously to Hogg's 'The Forest Minstrel' (1810), of which the best-known is 'Lucy's Flittin''. Subsequently he farmed at Traquair, near Peebles. 
In 1817, his farming unsuccessful, Laidlaw found a congenial home and employment at Kaeside on the Abbotsford estate, acting as Scott's steward, valued companion, and literary assistant. When Scott was too ill to write, he dictated to Laidlaw the end of 'The Bride of Lammermoor' (1819), most of 'A Legend of Montrose' (1819), and part of 'Ivanhoe' (1820). Lockhart claims in his life of Scott that the idea for 'Saint Ronan's Well' (1824) arose from Laidlaw's suggestion that Scott should devote a novel to 'Melrose in July 1823' (Lockhart, 5.285). Scott's influence procured paid literary work for Laidlaw with periodicals like the 'Edinburgh Annual Register' and 'Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'. 'Sagacity of a Shepherd's Dog' ('Blackwood', 2.417-21) is an interesting demonstration of the literary interaction between Laidlaw, Scott, and Hogg. During a visit to Abbotsford, Hogg wrote to William Blackwood on 5 January 1818, 'Along with Scott's and Laidlaw's contributions to your miscellany I also inclose my mite... Now that Laidlaw has furnished one anecdote of the Shepherd's dog mine will follow better next month.' Scott and Laidlaw wrote 'Sagacity of a Shepherd's Dog' and Hogg, having read it, clearly tailored his own piece on the subject ('Further Anecdotes of the Shepherd's Dog') to suit with and refer to the earlier article. Scott's ruin in 1826 ended Laidlaw's life at Kaeside temporarily, but he was able to return in 1830. 
After Scott's death in 1832, Laidlaw became a factor in Ross-shire, first to Mrs Stewart Mackenzie of Seaforth, then to Sir Charles Lockhart Ross of Balnagowan. Retiring in feeble health, he died in the house of his brother James at Contin, near Dingwall, Ross-shire, on 18 May 1845, and was buried in Contin churchyard.

Laing, Alexander (1778-1838), antiquary, the illegitimate son of an Aberdeen advocate named Michie, was born at Coull, Aberdeenshire. He was reasonably well educated and highly talented, but his career was hampered by an erratic temperament. For some years before his death he was employed as an itinerant bookseller and stationer, which earned him the nickname Stashie Laing. The first of Laing's antiquarian writings, 'The Caledonian itinerary, or, A tour on the banks of the Dee, with historical notes from the best authorities', was published at Aberdeen in 1819. During the next three years Laing edited an annual, the first two issues of which were entitled 'The Eccentric Magazine', and the third 'The Lounger's Commonplace Book'; this was a collection of anecdotes and curiosities. In 1822 he published 'Scarce Ancient Ballads Never before Published, with Notes', and in the following year a similar collection, entitled 'The Thistle of Scotland'. In 1828 he published his chief work, 'The Donean Tourist, Interspersed with Anecdotes and Ancient National Ballads', a useful collection of folklore. 
Laing's last work was 'An Cluaran Albannach: a repository of ballads, many never before published, to which are appended copious notes, historical, biographical, illustrative, and critical' (1834). Laing died at Boltingstone, a roadside inn between Tarland and Strathdon, and was buried in the churchyard of Coldstone, Aberdeenshire.

Laing, Alexander (1787-1857), poet, was born on 14 May 1787 at Brechin, Forfarshire, the son of James Laing, an agricultural labourer. He spent only two years at school, and became a cowherd at the age of eight; he devoted much of his leisure time to reading and writing. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a flax-dresser, and followed this occupation until he was permanently disabled by an accident fourteen years later. From this point on he earned a modest living as a pedlar. 
Laing contributed verse to local newspapers and to several miscellanies, including R. A. Smith's 'Scottish Minstrel' (1820) and 'Whistle-Binkie' (1832-47). He also supplied anecdotes for 'The Laird of Logan' (1835), and edited popular editions of the works of Burns and Robert Tannahill. A collection of his own verse, 'Wayside Flowers', appeared in 1846, and was followed by a second edition in 1850. Laing combined elements of pathos and humour in a vigorous lowland Scots. Known as the Brechin poet, he died at Brechin on 14 October 1857.

Laing, Alexander Gordon (1794-1826), army officer and explorer in Africa, was born in Edinburgh on 27 December 1794, the eldest son of William Laing, a schoolmaster and the founder of a classical academy in Edinburgh, and his wife, Margaret, the daughter of William Gordon of Glasgow Academy. With teaching on both sides of his family, Laing seemed destined for a career of scholarship. He entered Edinburgh University at the age of thirteen, and, on graduating at seventeen, became a schoolmaster. But, having joined one of the local volunteer corps then being formed, he opted for a military life, was commissioned in 1810 ensign in the Prince of Wales's Edinburgh volunteers, and in 1811 went to Barbados, where his uncle was deputy quartermaster-general. In 1813 he was appointed ensign in the York light infantry, a corps which served in the West Indies, and in 1815 was promoted lieutenant. After the corps was disbanded at the peace, Laing exchanged into the 2nd West India regiment in Jamaica. He fell ill with a liver complaint, was sent to Honduras, and then returned home, where he was put on half pay in 1818. In 1820 he was brought back into the 2nd West India regiment and posted to Sierra Leone, where in 1822 he transferred, as captain, to the Royal African Colonial Corps. 
Laing's posting to Africa awakened a long-desired dream of exploring the interior and finding the still uncharted Niger. Soon after his arrival he was sent by the governor, Sir Charles MacCarthy, on two successive missions to Forecariah in the coastal country (later Guinea) north of Sierra Leone, to mediate in a war between two rulers which was disrupting trade. While there, he found that one of them was receiving help from an army sent by the ruler of Solima Yalunka, an inland kingdom over a hundred miles from the coast, with its capital at Falaba, still unvisited from the colony. On his return, suspecting that it might open his way to the Niger, he offered to MacCarthy to visit Falaba to open up trade. 
In 1822 Laing set out with a small escort up the Rokel River, through the mountainous Koranko country to Falaba, where he was well received by the ruler. He went on and found the source of the Rokel, but though he viewed the upland where the Niger rises he was not allowed to go on and had to return disappointed. He was, however, able to establish, by taking its height, that the Niger could not, as some still supposed, possibly flow into the Nile. His 'Travels', published in 1825, give a lively account of his adventures, including not only observations on the customs of the peoples he encountered, illustrated with his own rather amateurish drawings and a good map, but also an oral history of Solima Yalunka back to the seventeenth century, useful to later historians. Laing was transferred to the Gold Coast in 1823 and edited the first newspaper to be published there. Then, stationed on the frontier, he participated in some skirmishes with the Asante army before the disastrous battle of Nsamanko, in which MacCarthy and almost all his men were killed. Now in poor health, he was sent home to report the news of the defeat to the colonial secretary, Lord Bathurst, with whom, to the annoyance of his senior officers, he ingratiated himself. In 1824 he was sent, with the local rank of major, on an official mission to seek the elusive Niger. 
The Niger quest had now become a race. Hugh Clapperton, having returned from the expedition that he, Dixon Denham, and Walter Oudney had made southwards across the Sahara from Tripoli, was now convinced that the Niger flowed into the Atlantic and set out in 1825 for the Atlantic coast. Laing, instructed to go via Tripoli, proposed to travel south-eastwards across the Sahara to Ghadames, then to Timbuktu, still a name of glamour and mystery to Europeans, and thence to follow the Niger to its mouth. He arrived in Tripoli in May 1825, and was warmly welcomed by the British consul-general Hanmer Warrington, whose friendly relations with the ruling Turkish pasha, Yusuf Karamanli, had made it possible for Denham's mission to travel safely across the desert. Laing, ignorant of the difficulties of Saharan travel, had budgeted for a sum far below that which Yusuf Karamanli required, so he was delayed in Tripoli while Warrington wrote to London asking for more. Meanwhile Laing fell in love with Warrington's daughter Emma (died 1829), and, despite her father's dismay at this 'Wild, Enthusiastic and Romantic Attachment' (TNA: PRO, FO 76/19, 1725), they were married on 14 July 1825, four days before his departure for Timbuktu (her father prudently insisting that the marriage remain unconsummated). 
Bathurst refused the requested subvention -- and may thus be held indirectly responsible for Laing's eventual death. Denham's mission had been subsidized by a grant that guaranteed the protection of the two powerful rulers whose territories they crossed, Yusuf Karamanli and Sultan Bello of Sokoto. Laing set out, on 18 July, without official protection, across a vast desert notoriously infested by Tuareg marauders. Sheikh Babani, a merchant long resident in Timbuktu, accompanied him as a guide. His party included two west African boat builders, to build a boat when they reached the Niger, Jacob Nahun, a Jewish interpreter, and his servant, Jack le Bore. Born in the Caribbean (San Domingo), le Bore had served all over Europe as a trumpeter in Napoleon's armies, then, at the peace, volunteered for the British army, and while stationed in Sierra Leone had accompanied Laing to Falaba. 
Following a circuitous route across the desert, the party reached Ghadames, where they stayed six weeks (Laing sketched the Roman ruins), then moved westwards, making the detour to suit Babani's interests, to Ensala, where they were joined by a large trading caravan. Delayed by rumours of warfare between Tuareg and Arab clans, they eventually left on 9 January 1826. Sixteen days later they were attacked by Tuareg. Laing was fearfully wounded, with sabre cuts on his head, body, arms, and legs. Astonishingly he survived, tended by a kindly sheikh, Sidi Muhammad, who lived nearby. He set out again on 1 July, with one black servant, Bungola, his other companions, including Babani and the invaluable le Bore, being now dead. 
On 13 August Laing reached Timbuktu, where he stayed for several weeks, researching into old manuscripts. But the city was now under the control of Ahmadu, the Fula ruler of Masina, who refused to let him go further. Nevertheless he again set out and (the full details are uncertain) was attacked and killed by a party who came out after him from Timbuktu on 24 September 1826. Bungola survived, and returned two years later to Tripoli with the news. 
Overwrought at the death of his son-in-law, Warrington wildly accused the pasha of having conspired with the French consul, Baron Rousseau, to have Laing killed and his journals, which had not surfaced, spirited away to France. His accusations were taken seriously in London, gunboats were sent to Tripoli, and the British and French governments were involved in several years of acrimonious diplomatic correspondence. The story was even believed by some historians, including the author of Laing's entry in the 'Dictionary of National Biography'. Laing himself was quietly forgotten. Not until 1931 did the Royal African Society have a memorial plaque put on the house where he stayed in Timbuktu. His surviving letters and papers, edited by E. W. Bovill, were finally published by the Hakluyt Society in 1964.

Laing, David (bap. 1775, d. 1856), architect, was born in London and baptized there on 9 March 1775 at St Dunstan-in-the-East, the son of David Laing, a cork-cutter of Tower Street, London, and his wife, Ann. He was articled to John Soane in 1790, and was still in Soane's office when he exhibited a design for a saloon at the Royal Academy in 1795. The following year he established himself in private practice. Laing's career began slowly but with promise; in 1800 he erected a villa for one Griffith Jones at Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, and in 1803 he designed cottages at Easthampstead, Berkshire, for the marquess of Downshire. In 1800 he followed one of the time-honoured routes for aspirant architects by publishing a book of his designs: 'Hints for Dwellings, Consisting of Original Designs for Cottages, Farm Houses, Villas, etc.' It was a popular work, reprinted in 1804, 1823, and 1841. He followed this in 1818 with 'Plans etc. of Buildings, Public and Private, Executed in Various Parts of England, Including the Custom House'. Several of the designs were for specific patrons, such as the 'villa to be erected for a gentleman' at Ballmahon in co. Longford, illustrated in 'Hints', or the house 'erected' for General Sir J. Taylor at Castle Taylor, Ardrahan, Galway, in 'Plans' (although Laing's role is unclear, and the house has been demolished). 
In 1810 Laing was appointed surveyor to the customs. The expansion of Britain's trade, and consequently of the customs' business, promised to make this a valuable post. In the same year he began the new custom house in Plymouth, finished in 1811. It is a sober building of granite, five bays wide, the ground floor with rock-faced rustication, the upper floor with smooth ashlar masonry and five arched windows recessed in arched surrounds. Laing's design is distinguished and powerful, and betokened a brilliant career. In 1818-19 he also rebuilt the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East, drawings of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy, although his obituary suggested that most of the design work was done by William Tite, his then assistant; it was destroyed by bombing in 1941. Laing also built the corn exchange, High Street, Colchester (1825), a nine-bay building with an elegant colonnade of Greek Doric columns spanning the pavement in front. 
In May 1812 came Laing's great opportunity, to rebuild the custom house on Thames Street in London, replacing Thomas Ripley's building of 1718. His original scheme, for a building on the north of Thames Street, approached by new docks on either side, was not accepted. Laing produced a simpler scheme for a massive rectangular block. The centre was of two storeys, with vaults for the 'king's warehouse' below and the great 'long room' above. To either side were great four-storey wings housing the offices. Laing's design for the facades was strong and innovative, and his long room, spanned with three shallow domes and clearly showing Soane's influence, would have been one of the finest neo-classical interiors in Britain. Laing's estimate was $209,000, plus $12,000 for piling and $7000 for contingencies; the contractors, Miles and Peto, won the job with a tender of $165,000. 
The building of the custom house proved, however, to be one of the major architectural scandals of the nineteenth century, and the ruin of Laing's career. The problems centred on the failure of Laing's piled foundations, and his failure to supervise the contractors properly. Construction was dogged by delays and disputes between Laing and Miles and Peto. By late 1817 work was nearing completion, and the cost had soared above the estimates. A detailed series of reports by the office of works uncovered glaring discrepancies between what Laing had specified and the work executed, and he was suspected of fraudulent collusion with the contractors. This was never proved, but in 1821 Laing's conduct was widely believed to be in the highest degree improper and reprehensible. More seriously, cracks had appeared in the vault of the king's warehouse in 1820, and in 1824 part of the long room's river facade collapsed, followed by the king's warehouse vault and the long room floor. Sir Robert Smirke, called on to investigate, uncovered huge discrepancies between what was specified and paid for, and the work executed. Smirke carried out the reconstruction, underpinning the custom house with concrete foundations and rebuilding the central section as it stands today; by 1829 the total cost had risen to $435,000. J. Mordaunt Crook observed that what the custom house gained in solidity it lost in architectural interest, as Smirke rebuilt Laing's long room and river facade to his own, more pedestrian, designs. 
Following Smirke's damning report Laing was dismissed, his career destroyed by the fiasco. The only significant works by him after 1824 are Lexden Park, Colchester, Essex, for J. F. Mills (1825), altered beyond recognition in the 1850s, and the Royal Universal Infirmary for Children, Waterloo Road, London, of 1833-4 (dem.). In 1837 he found some work providing illustrations of public buildings for Peter Nicholson's 'Practical Masonry, Bricklaying and Plastering'. In the 1840s he was living in Brighton, though no buildings by him are known there. Laing was reduced almost to destitution and lived on the charity of the Artists' General Benevolent Institution, the Fund for Distressed Architects, and the Surveyor's Club. He died at Brompton, where he had been living since 'c'.1850, on 27 March 1856, aged eighty-two. A long and strikingly generous obituary in 'The Builder' (5 April 1856) sought to exculpate Laing from blame for the custom house disaster; it noted that such eminent architects as Charles Fowler and Sir William Tite had been his pupils, 'and have been happily more fortunate than their kind-hearted master' ('The Builder', 198).

Laing, David (1793-1878), antiquary and librarian, was born in North St David Street, Edinburgh, on or shortly after 20 April 1793, the second son of William Laing (1764-1832) and Helen Kirk (1767-1837). His father, by profession a publisher and bookseller specializing in secondhand, antiquarian, and foreign literature, was ultimately to have twelve children, nine of whom, four sons and five daughters, survived until adulthood. Laing was educated at the Canongate grammar school between about 1800 and 1805, and thereafter attended Greek classes at Edinburgh University, but these formal studies ended when in 1806, at the age of thirteen, he began work in his father's thriving business, recently moved to 49 South Bridge. Laing made the most of this change in circumstance, reading as much of the stock as he could, with Scottish history and literature proving a particular passion. The learning he thus acquired, and his youthful enthusiasm, soon came to the notice of the many literary people who found Laing's shop an irresistible attraction. He attended several important London auction sales, such as the Porson (1809) and Roxburghe (1812); and, following his father's example, made purchasing trips on the continent in 1816 and 1819. The latter visit was to Scandinavia, and it was on this occasion that he purchased around 1500 items from the library of the Icelandic scholar Grimur Thorkelin, a collection later to be sold to the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh. The 1816 journey, to the Low Countries and northern France, was undertaken in the company of Adam Black and James Wilson (brother of 'Christopher North'), and when in Holland he made the acquaintance of John Gibson Lockhart. Lockhart referred to Laing in a poem published in 'Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine' in July 1818 as: '
the most sagacious and the best, 

As all Old Reekie's erudites opine, 

Of Scottish Bibliopoles... 

A famous Bibliomaniac, and a shrewd, 

Who turns his madness to no little good. 
('Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine', 407)' The following year Lockhart, in 'Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk' (letter 43, 2.182) again praised Laing, describing him as 'by far the most genuine specimen of the true old-fashioned bibliopole that I ever saw exhibited in the person of a young man'. 
In 1819 Laing was a candidate for the vacant keepership of the Advocates' Library, but, despite support for Laing from Walter Scott, Dr David Irving was elected in 1820. Laing's youth no doubt counted against him, but another likely factor was his close links with William Blackwood and his circle, whose satirical writings infuriated many. Laing made a second attempt to become keeper of the Advocates' Library after Irving's retirement in 1848, but withdrew his application, and the post went to Samuel Halkett. 
In 1821 Laing became a partner in his father's business. In that same year he issued the first results of his deep love of early Scottish poetry: an edition of the poems of Alexander Scott; an edition (with David Irving) of the poems of Alexander Montgomerie; and the first part of 'Select Remains of the Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland'. From then on, publications, mainly editions of Scottish historical and literary material, poured from him unabated until his death. 
On 27 February 1823 Sir Walter Scott founded the Bannatyne Club, for the purpose of printing hitherto unpublished or long out-of-print material relating to the history and literature of Scotland. Membership was restricted to thirty-one members. Scott was president until his death, and Laing became the first and only secretary, seeing through to publication well over a hundred volumes, at least thirty-nine of which were edited or part-edited by himself, before the society was dissolved in 1861. It was Laing who held the club together and saw that the publication schedule did not flag, either for want of editorial industry or dearth of patrons, as well as ensuring that the clubbable aspects of membership were kept green. 
On 9 February 1824 Laing was elected to a fellowship of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, having been blackballed at an earlier attempt in 1820. In 1827 his application to become a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh was likewise blackballed, but here he never allowed his name to go forward for re-election, although encouraged to do so. As with the Bannatyne Club, Laing was of inestimable importance to the Society of Antiquaries: for over fifty years there was scarcely a volume of the society's publications to which he did not provide a contribution, and it has been estimated he read over one hundred papers to the society. He helped to edit the society's irregular 'Transactions' and was joint editor of the annual 'Proceedings' from their first appearance in 1851/2 until his death. As treasurer between 1836 and 1852 he steered the society through a particularly difficult period, when it seemed possible that its museum might have to be sold to meet debts. The situation was resolved when the government undertook in 1851 to maintain the collections, an important step towards the formation of a national museum of antiquities. Laing was also a vice-president (1859-62 and 1865-8), acting secretary (1839-41), and a secretary for foreign correspondence (1852-78). 
Throughout the 1820s and most of the 1830s Laing continued as a bookseller. Between 1825 and 1827 he also found time to supervise the rebinding of older books and to help with the rearrangement of stock in the university library, at that time moving premises. On 21 June 1837 he was elected librarian to the Society of Writers to H. M. Signet, the professional body for Scottish solicitors, in succession to Macvey Napier. His candidature was supported by many luminaries, such as Robert Southey, T. F. Dibdin, John Lee, Sir William Hamilton, J. G. Lockhart, Sir Henry Ellis, and Sir Frederic Madden. Thereafter, Laing gave up his bookselling business, as he undertook to do in his letter of application, selling at auction the stock he did not want for his personal library. The Signet Library when Laing took over had 40,000 volumes; when he died forty-one years later, still in office, it had 70,000. Laing masterminded the production of a printed catalogue of the holdings: the volume covering A-L appeared in 1871, and letter P was reached by 1878. 
Laing's own library became very large and impressive. The printed books possibly numbered 20,000 by his death, despite the sale of over 1200 items at auction in London in June 1856. His massive manuscript collections contained much highly important literary and historical material, mainly of Scottish interest, and including 3326 charters, mainly of Scottish provenance, as well as over 120 medieval manuscript volumes. He also collected old master prints and drawings, portraits of Scots, and other items of Scottish historical importance. He undoubtedly used continental visits, especially frequent in the 1850s, as well as travels within Britain, to build up his collections, but also used every opportunity nearer to home, including arrangements with at least one Edinburgh waste paper merchant. 
Laing lived an equable bachelor existence, blessed with robust good health, with a wide circle of friends, acquaintances, and correspondents, although to strangers on first acquaintance he could appear brusque, testy, and impatient. He gave freely of his time to help other scholars, and Cosmo Innes declared in 1864 that 'no wise man will undertake a literary work in Scotland without taking counsel with Mr David Laing' ('The Scotsman', 21 April 1864). David Masson declared Laing to be 'the prince of the Scottish literary antiquarians of this century' ('The Scotsman', 30 Oct 1878). Laing's principal biographer, Gilbert Goudie, listed Laing's publications in 1913: they number 214, although some multi-volume works received entries for each volume. On the other hand, some anonymous notices, articles, and reviews no doubt slipped through Goudie's net. Laing not only edited material for, and involved himself in the affairs of, the Bannatyne Club and the Society of Antiquaries, but he also performed editorial and organizational work for the plethora of Scottish historical clubs which sprouted in emulation of the Bannatyne, such as its Glasgow equivalent the Maitland Club, and the Abbotsford, Spalding, Hunterian, and Wodrow clubs. For the last-named Laing undertook his most important work, an edition of the writings of John Knox which appeared in six volumes between 1846 and 1864, although the club itself collapsed in 1848. No collected edition has appeared since. Many of Laing's other editions are likewise still the most accessible and accurate available, for example his edition of the letters of Robert Baillie (Maitland and Bannatyne clubs, 1841) or his edition of the diary of Alexander Brodie (Spalding Club, 1853). Laing's editorial methods were of the highest calibre according to the standards of his day, and Scottish literary and historical scholars owe him an immense debt of gratitude. 
Laing's knowledge of Scottish art was on a par with his acquaintance of Scottish history and literature, a fact recognized in 1854, when he was elected honorary professor of antiquities to the Royal Scottish Academy; in 1861 he became honorary professor of ancient history there. In 1862 he declined an LLD from St Andrews University, but he accepted the same degree from Edinburgh University two years later. In 1865 Thomas Carlyle, an old friend, was elected rector of Edinburgh University, and Laing was nominated by him his assessor to the university court for the three-year period concerned. 
Following his mother's death in January 1837, Laing's youngest sister, Euphemia, acted as housekeeper. Until 1843 he stayed at the family home of Ramsay Lodge, Lauriston Place, but from 1845 he lived at East Villa, 12 James Street, Portobello, to the east of Edinburgh. It was there he died, on Friday 18 October 1878, of kidney failure. He was buried in the family plot in the new Calton cemetery on 23 October. 
Laing's collections had varying fates: the manuscripts, including his own correspondence comprising some 9000 items, were bequeathed to Edinburgh University Library. By his express testamentary direction, his printed books were sold by auction in London: Messrs Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge conducted the sale between 1 December 1879 and 24 February 1881. The same firm also sold Laing's finest prints on 21 February 1880. Altogether, there were 11,743 lots of books and 213 of prints, and the total amount realized was almost $17,000. A Scottish bibliophile of the next generation, David Murray, called the dispersal of Laing's library 'a national misfortune' (Murray, 362). Laing's impressive collection of old master drawings were bequeathed to the Royal Scottish Academy, whence they were later transferred to the National Gallery of Scotland. A large residue of prints and drawings, the latter mainly Scottish and dating from after 1800, were sold at auction in Edinburgh: the drawings in 347 lots on 22 and 23 December 1879; and the prints in two sales, 16-19 December 1879 and 13 January 1880.

Laing, James (c.1530-1594), theologian, was born in the diocese of St Andrews. According to Thomas Dempster he died at the age of ninety-three and was therefore born in 1500 or 1501, but the course of his career makes a date of birth about 1530 more credible. Having probably studied at King's College, Aberdeen, he continued his studies at the University of Paris, where he applied himself to theology and took holy orders. In the university records he is described as a Scot, of the diocese of St Andrews, and of the German nation. On 20 October 1556 he was elected procurator of his nation, entitling him to represent it in the rector's court, the governing body of the university. This honour was conferred on him on many later occasions -- on 27 August 1558, 27 October 1560, 10 February 1561, at some date in 1564, on 14 January 1571, and in 1590. He was also quaestor (bursar) on 21 October 1568. In September 1571 he was described as bachelor of theology, but was doctor by the date of his first book in 1581. He preached during several years in Paris. Jean de Rouen, privy councillor, royal almoner, rector, and censor of the university, in a treatise on the Sorbonne, mentions Laing in very laudatory terms. 
A lifelong Catholic, Laing was a violent enemy of the Reformation, and very insulting in his personal attacks on the reformers. In 1581 he wrote 'De vita et moribus atque rebus gestis haereticorum nostri temporis'. The notices of Calvin and three others are translated from the French of J.-H. Bolsec's 'Histoire des vies des quatre principaux heretiques de nostre temps' (1580). There were two editions in 1581, dedicated to Queen Mary and James VI, translated into German in 1582 at Ingolstadt. Laing's first sentence regarding Knox concludes, 'ab initio suae pueritiae omni genere turpissimi facinoris infectus fuit' ('from his earliest childhood he was infected with every kind of the basest ill doing'; p. 113 and verso). In 1585 he wrote a second treatise, based on Bolsec's 'Histoire de la vie de Theodore de Beze' (1582), 'De vita et moribus Theodori Bezae, omnium haereticorum nostri temporis facile principis, et aliorum haereticorum brevis recitatio, cui adjectus est libellus de morte patris Edmundi Campionis et aliorum quorundam Catholicorum qui in Anglia pro fide catholica interfecti fuerunt, primo die Decembris, anno domini 1581, authore Jacobo Laingeo, doctore Sorbonico'. The Campion work translated here appeared in Lyons in 1582 and Laing's book is, like his first, dedicated jointly to Queen Mary and to James VI. He is said to have written other unpublished works of a less polemical nature, including a commentary on Aristotle's philosophy, which Dempster claims he saw in manuscript with the author shortly before his death. Laing's name is appended to a document in the form of an oath of fealty signed and addressed by the principal members of the Paris faculties to Henri IV on his accession (22 April 1594). He died during this year, and was buried, according to his wish, in the chapel of the Sorbonne.

Laing, John (d. 1483), administrator and bishop of Glasgow, came of the family of Laing of Redhouse, Edinburghshire. He was appointed rector of Tannadice in Angus and vicar of Linlithgow, and by the beginning of 1474 he was rector of Newlands in the diocese of Glasgow. He was also involved in secular government. Described in a charter of 1463 as secretary to Mary of Gueldres, the widowed queen of James II, he had become royal treasurer by 17 September 1470 and held that office at least until his provision to Glasgow, and probably afterwards -- he cannot be shown to have been replaced until 29 May 1476. In addition he was clerk register in 1473. Following the death of Andrew Durisdeer, bishop of Glasgow, on 20 November 1473 Laing was provided to the see on 28 January 1474, when Sixtus IV referred to him as councillor to the king of Scots. Laing may earlier have shared in the disquiet created in the Scottish church by the elevation of Patrick Graham to metropolitan status at St Andrews in 1472, particularly since one of his own benefices was granted for the maintenance of the archbishop's household. 
In 1476 Laing founded a Franciscan friary in Glasgow. Two years later James III confirmed Laing's grants of land and tenements in Edinburgh to St Kentigern, Glasgow Cathedral, and the altar of St Duthac in the church of St Giles, Edinburgh. A further grant, made on 9 February 1482, gave the rent from two booths in Edinburgh to pay for 6 stones of wax yearly for candles for the choir of Glasgow Cathedral. The crisis precipitated by the seizure of James III by members of the Scottish nobility in July 1482 led to abrupt changes in government, and Laing had replaced Andrew Stewart, Lord Avondale, as chancellor by 25 August. Laing's long record of service to the crown as a councillor, witnessing royal charters from 1470 onwards, meant that he was not too closely identified with the unpopular James III, and consequently his appointment as chancellor would seem to have been acceptable to both the king and his opponents. During the crisis of 1482-3 he was the nominal head of an administration which rejected William Scheves, archbishop of St Andrews; as a particular favourite of James III, Scheves was resented by the wider political community, frustrated by what it saw as its exclusion from royal policy making. Laing held the position of chancellor of Scotland until his death on 11 January 1483, when he was succeeded in office by Bishop James Livingston of Dunkeld.

Laing, John (1809-1880), bibliographer, was born on 16 February 1809 at Edinburgh, but grew up at nearby Dalmeny, where his father, also John, was for many years factor to the earl of Rosebery; his mother was Mary Fyfe, of a Banffshire family. He lost the sight of one eye in his youth. After attending the high school in Edinburgh, he took arts classes at Edinburgh University between 1823 and 1826, and divinity classes between 1827 and 1831. Having been licensed as a clergyman by the presbytery of Edinburgh on 5 October 1841, he was ordained assistant and successor to John Robertson, minister of Livingston, Linlithgowshire, on 13 January 1842. At the Disruption in the following year he joined the newly formed Free Church, and continued his ministry in the same parish. On 29 August 1843 he married, at Dalmeny, Catherine Fyfe (died 16 Feb 1869), daughter of a West India proprietor. There were three daughters: Mary (who died young), Catherine, and Fanny. 
In 1845 Laing had a physical, spiritual, and mental collapse and went abroad for a time, becoming a chaplain to the British forces on Gibraltar and Malta. He resigned his parish in March 1847. Late in 1850 he was appointed an assistant librarian at the recently completed New College of the Free Church; in 1854 he became acting librarian following the death of the incumbent, William Rowand, the previous year. This post he held until his own death. Throughout his librarianship the collections grew rapidly and Laing organized the publication of a substantial catalogue of the printed books and manuscripts in 1868. After the death of his friend Samuel Halkett in 1871, the materials collected by the latter for a dictionary of anonymous British literature were entrusted to him, and Laing more than doubled the store. The work, 'A Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Literature of Great Britain', was published posthumously in four volumes between 1882 and 1888, prepared for the press, apart from the unsatisfactory indexes, by Laing's daughter Catherine. 'Halkett and Laing' soon established itself as an invaluable reference work, relied upon for its accuracy and admired for the concise way in which it cited the sources for its attributions. An expanded edition in nine volumes appeared between 1926 and 1962. Laing died in Edinburgh, where he had lived, on 3 April 1880 and was buried in the Grange cemetery there.

Laing, Malcolm (1762-1818), historian and advocate, was the eldest son of Robert Laing (died 1805), a merchant and provost of Kirkwall in 1788-92, who came of an old Orkney family; his brother was Samuel Laing (1780-1868). Laing was born at the paternal estate of Strynzie (or Strenzie), on the island of Stronsay. He was educated at Kirkwall grammar school and Edinburgh University, and was called to the Scottish bar on 9 July 1785, but his practice remained small. His speeches in the court were neither eloquent nor pleasing, though in parliament he was considered an able speaker. Lord Cockburn highly praised his speech in 1794 defending Joseph Gerrald (1763-1796), a delegate from the London Corresponding Society, charged with sedition. 
Turning from legal work, Laing devoted much of his time to historical studies. On the death of the historian Robert Henry, at the request of Henry's executors, he completed 'The History of Great Britain', adding chapters 5 and 7 and the appendix to volume 6 (1793). In 1800 Laing published 'The history of Scotland, from the union of the crowns on the accession of King James VI to the throne of England, to the union of the kingdoms in the reign of Queen Anne, with two dissertations, historical and critical, on the Gowrie conspiracy, and on the supposed authenticity of Ossian's poems'. Though written in a somewhat awkward and overelaborate style, his 'History' 'was full of useful research and displayed a breadth of knowledge that Robertson's 'History of Scotland' might not have commanded' (Price). The dissertation on the 'Poems of Ossian' is a severely negative and insensitive criticism of James Macpherson's supposed Gaelic translations. Laing could not set aside the charges of forgery against Macpherson and remained contemptuous of the poet's genius. In 1804 Laing published a second and corrected edition of his 'History of Scotland' in four volumes, with a preliminary 'Dissertation on the participation of Mary, Queen of Scots, in the murder of Darnley'. Here he attempted to establish the authenticity of the casket letters, and his dissertation was an able statement of the case against the queen. In the same year he edited 'The Historie and Life of King James VI', and in May and June 1805 published a heavily annotated edition of 'The poems of Ossian, containing the poetical works of James Macpherson in prose and verse, with notes and illustrations'. 
Laing was a strong-minded liberal in politics, a Scottish Foxite, who along with seven other Edinburgh whig lawyers, known as the Independent Friends, opposed the machine-politician Henry Dundas and his tory coalition. He joined the Whig Club in 1796 and helped C. J. Fox to write his own historical work. After a number of broken pledges to bring Laing into parliament, his Scots and English colleagues finally arranged his appointment. In the general election of 1807 Laing was named to the uncontested seat of Orkney and Shetland and held the office until 1812. 
Laing married Margaret Carnegie, daughter of Thomas Carnegie of Craigo, Forfarshire, on 10 September 1805; the couple had no children. Soon after, in 1808, he left London and Edinburgh and returned to Orkney. Growing physical ailments in his last years forced his retirement from an active career. Sir Walter Scott described a visit paid to him at Kirkwall in August 1814. 'Our old acquaintance,' he wrote, 'though an invalid, received us kindly; he looks very poorly, and cannot walk without assistance, but seems to retain all the quick, earnest, and vivacious intelligence of his character and manner' (J. G. Lockhart, 'Memoirs of Sir Walter Scott', 5 vols., 1914, 2.380). Laing died on 6 November 1818 at Kirkwall. There is a tablet to his memory on the wall of the north nave of Kirkwall Cathedral. 'Depth, truth, and independence as a historian were', Lord Cockburn commented, 'the least of his merits, for he was a firm, warm-hearted, honest man, whose instructive and agreeable companionship was only made the more interesting by a hard, peremptory Celtic manner and accent' ('Memorials', 202-3).

Laing, Samuel (1780-1868), author and traveller, son of Robert Laing (died 1805), a merchant and provost of Kirkwall in 1788-92, of an old Orkney family and younger brother of Malcolm Laing, was born at Kirkwall, Orkney, on 4 October 1780. He was educated at Kirkwall grammar school and the University of Edinburgh. Leaving Edinburgh without a degree about 1797, he spent eighteen months at Kiel in Schleswig-Holstein studying German. In 1805 he entered the army as an ensign in the staff corps stationed at Hythe and with which he served in the Peninsular War. He returned to Britain in 1809, sold out from the army, and, through his brother's influence, was appointed manager of mines at Wanlockhead, in southern Scotland. In March that year he married Agnes (died 1812), daughter of Captain Francis Kelly of Kelly. Shortly before her death they had a daughter, Elizabeth ('b'. 1809), and a son, Samuel Laing. In 1818 he returned to Orkney where he successfully organized the coastal herring fishery for a London firm. When his brother died childless in 1818, he inherited the heavily encumbered estates at Strynzia or Strenzie, Orkney. He lived at Kirkwall, of which he was for some years provost, and was engaged in the reduction of kelp to alkali for glass manufacture. 
At the general election of 1832-3 Laing unsuccessfully contested Orkney and Shetland as a radical, and in his 'Address to the Electors' (1833) accused the lord advocate of interfering on his opponent's behalf. Reduced to comparative poverty by the development in 1832 of synthetic alkali which ended demand for kelp and ruined many in the west highlands and islands, he left Orkney in 1834. He lived in Norway from 1834 to 1836 and visited Sweden in 1838, the previous death of his wife, the marriage of his daughter, the successful start in his career of his son, and the departure after a quarrel of his wife's sister Mary who had kept house for him, leaving him unencumbered by domestic responsibilities. His widely read accounts of his journeys were less travel books than works of political economy and attracted notices comparing him to Arthur Young and von Humboldt. In 'Journal of a Residence in Norway' (1836) he gave unqualified praise to the free, upright Norwegian peasantry. His praise accorded with his own belief that a relatively egalitarian distribution of property led to a virtuous society and with the tendency in nineteenth-century Norway to idealize the peasantry, through whose veins was thought to course the moral and economic lifeblood of the nation. The Norwegians were praised not only in their own right, but as ancestors of the British and the origin of all that was healthy, vigorous, free, democratic, upright, and decisive in the British character -- qualities that enabled Britons to range the world as the vikings had done. Laing declares that among the Norwegian people 'may be traced the germ of all the free institutions which distinguish the British constitution at the present day' and of Norse literature, 'It is in these Saga, not in Tacitus, that we have to look for the origin of the political institutions of England' ('Journal', preface, 365). The central Gothic virtue according to Laing, and the source of Norway's political freedom, economic enterprise, judicial probity, and cultural richness, is 'udal' inheritance: partible inheritance with freehold, heritable tenure, familiar to Laing from the Orkneys and Shetland. His experience as a younger son colours his judgement, but he argues effectively and grounds his views in Norse history, as then known, and modern political economy, notably the ideas of Malthus. 
Laing's 'Tour in Sweden' (1839) was as critical of Sweden as the earlier book was enthusiastic about Norway, despite the similarities between the two countries. His criticism stemmed in part from his sympathy with the Norwegians, who in 1814 had been compelled to exchange Danish rule for personal union with Sweden, and in part from his use of the comprehensive Swedish statistics on crime, illegitimacy, and poverty which led him to conclude that the Swedes lived 'in a more demoralised state than any nation in Europe' (S. Laing, 'Tour in Sweden', 1839, 108), even while admitting that these findings did not accord with his own observations. He reserved his fiercest criticism for the ubiquitous state and state church whose hold over the people was judged insidious and evil. While Norway has retained its Gothic heritage and is egalitarian and democratic, Sweden has betrayed its, to adopt a system based on arbitrary power, empty deference, outdated privilege, and preference for fine over useful arts. Sweden 'wants the very foundation upon which civil liberty must stand -- a sense of independence and property among the people' ('Sweden', 274). If Norway taught Britons to rejoice in their Gothic heritage, Sweden served as an awful warning to Britons if they betrayed theirs. His grossly partisan account was widely accepted, for example by James Kay-Shuttleworth who agreed with Laing's opinion that in the degenerate Swedish social system 'some of the worst institutions of feudalism corrupt a people aroused from the incurious apathy of the middle ages' (Kay-Shuttleworth, 215). Count Magnus Bjornstjerna, Swedish ambassador to St James, responded with a pamphlet 'On the Moral State and Political Union of Sweden and Norway' (1840) to which Laing published a trenchant rejoinder in the 'Monthly Chronicle' (November, 1840), reprinted in 'Notes of a Traveller' (1842). Much of the latter book was devoted to Prussia whose people Laing likened to slaves. A German translation of this section by Adolf Heller appeared in Mannheim in 1844. Laing made a similar judgement on the Austrians and Neapolitans. Laing's purpose in these sweeping judgements on various peoples was always to analyse the political and economic regimes in operation in each country, not to point to any inherent or 'natural' characteristics of the people. 
Laing turned to literary work, publishing his acclaimed translation of Snorri Sturluson's 'Heimskringla' or chronicle of the kings of Norway (3 vols., 1840). According to Wawn it would be 'difficult to exaggerate the importance of Laing's 1844 volumes in awakening Victorian Britain to the turbulent history of the old north' (Wawn, 'Laing', 35). His lengthy introduction was a passionate restatement of the Gothic views expressed in his travel books. The translation was an important part of the Victorian revival of interest in the northern lands as a source of literary richness and political inspiration, and as a destination for growing numbers of literary tourists. It remained in print in various editions until the 1990s. A revised version edited by Rasmus B. Anderson (4 vols., 1889) cuts some of Laing's wilder notes to the text and makes revisions based on recent historical and literary scholarship; it also contains a biographical memoir with information from Laing's children. Mistrust of the Roman Catholic church, evident from his 'Notes of a Traveller', led Laing to oppose the Maynooth grant and to write critically in 1845 of the pilgrimage of one and a half million people to see the alleged holy coat at Trier. He returned to travel and in 'Observations on... the European People' (1850) admitted some of the disadvantages of peasant proprietorship. For this he was reproached with inconsistency by J. S. Mill who, influenced by 'Residence in Norway', had argued in favour of that mode of land tenure in his own 'Political Economy'. Laing's 'Observations on... Denmark and the Duchies' (1852) showed a similar retreat from his earlier radical views. 
Laing spent the rest of his life in Edinburgh, where he died at the house of his daughter, Elizabeth Baxter, who had been widowed in 1837, on 23 April 1868. He was buried in the Dean cemetery. Laing was acclaimed in his lifetime as 'Britain's foremost philosophical travel writer' (Wawn, 'Vikings and the Victorians', 106) and some 150 years later there was a revival of interest in him by writers on travel and travel writing and their connection with literature. The editor of his lately discovered autobiography was behind the erection of a plaque commemorating Laing on Papdale House, Papdale, Orkney. Fereday considers Laing 'a man who was seldom troubled by self doubt' ('Autobiography', 13). Many of Laing's judgements are egregiously partisan, but at least in part because of this enthusiasm, his writings continue to entertain and inform debate on Scandinavia, and peasant proprietorship and its relation to population growth and poverty.

Laing, Samuel (1812-1897), politician, author, and railway executive, was born in Edinburgh on 12 December 1812. He was the son of Samuel Laing (1780-1868), author of 'Tours' in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, who was younger brother of Malcolm Laing, the historian of Scotland. His mother was Agnes Kelly. Laing was educated at Houghton-le-Spring grammar school, and privately by Richard Wilson, a fellow of St John's, Cambridge. He entered that college as a pensioner on 5 July 1827, graduated BA as second wrangler in 1831, and was also second Smith's prizeman. He was elected a fellow of St John's on 17 March 1834, and remained for a time in Cambridge as a mathematical coach. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 10 November 1832, and was called to the bar on 9 June 1837. He married in 1841 Mary, daughter of Captain Cowan RN; they had two sons and three daughters. 
Soon after being called to the bar Laing was appointed private secretary to Henry Labouchere, afterwards Lord Taunton, then president of the Board of Trade. Upon the formation of the railway department of that office in 1842 he was appointed secretary, and thenceforth distinguished himself as an authority upon railways under successive presidents of the Board of Trade. He declared that 'the public have never permanently benefited from competition from different lines of railway'. He advocated stricter vetting of railway bills to avoid wasteful competition, but was opposed to government interference in matters of railway operation. He opposed railway trade unionism, but supported self-help benefit societies of railway employees. 
At Laing's suggestion there was included in Gladstone's 'Railway Act' of 1844 the requirement that each newly authorized railway should provide, in each direction of its lines, third class, covered carriages, in which the charge per passenger mile should not exceed 1died The trains so provided became known as parliamentary trains. This legislation was largely responsible for the proportion of third class passengers to total railway passengers rising from under 28 per cent in 1844 to over 78 per cent in 1875. In 1845 Laing was appointed a member of the railway commission, presided over by Lord Dalhousie, and drew up the chief reports on the railway schemes of that period. 
In 1846 Laing resigned his position as secretary at the Board of Trade and two years later was appointed chairman and managing director of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway. Under his management passenger traffic nearly doubled in five years and shareholders were paid a steady 6 per cent dividend. 
However, in 1852 Laing resigned his chairmanship of the Brighton line to pursue his interests in the City of London. In 1860 he was, for a few months, financial secretary to the Treasury before Lord Palmerston persuaded him to become financial minister to the crown in India. At this post he was successful in reducing military expenditure during a brief period of peace. 
During Laing's absence from the chair of the Brighton company (1852-67) and his period of service in India, the directors of the company were less circumspect than they had been under his authority. In the boom years of 1865-6, they built many branch lines to protect the company's territory from incursions from the South Eastern Railway. Following the failure of the firm of Overend and Gurney in October 1866, when the Brighton company was on the verge of bankruptcy, as a result of its speculative railway ventures, its directors, in some desperation, persuaded Laing to resume the chair. 
With the able and dedicated assistance of Sir Allen Sarle, who was company secretary from 1867, and secretary and general manager from 1886, Laing led an innovative and financially successful company until his retirement in 1894. In 1881 the company pioneered electric lighting in passenger carriages while the comfort of its customers was enhanced by the widespread introduction of Pullman cars. 
Laing resigned from the chairmanship of the Brighton line in 1852. In July of that year he was returned to parliament as a Liberal for the Wick district, which he represented until 1857 (when he lost his seat for opposing British intervention in China). He was re-elected in April 1859. He was financial secretary to the Treasury from June to October 1860, then appointed as financial minister in India on the governor general's council; a post he held until 1865 when he was again elected MP for Wick in July 1865. He was rejected for that constituency in 1868, but was returned for Orkney and Shetland in 1873, and sat without interruption until he retired from parliament in 1885. Though a staunch Liberal, he was opposed to what he considered the anti-imperialist leanings of Gladstone; he published in 1884 a careful and moderate indictment of what would now be called Little Englandism in 'England's Foreign Policy'. 
It was not until Laing had turned seventy and retired from parliament that he came before the public prominently as an author. His 'Modern Science and Modern Thought' appeared in 1885 and was very widely read, being, in fact, an admirable popular exposition of the speculations of Darwin, Huxley, and Spencer, and the incompatibility of the data of modern science and 'revealed religion'. A supplementary chapter to the third edition (1886) contained a fairly crushing reply to Gladstone's defence of the book of 'Genesis'. It was followed by 'A Modern Zoroastrian', 1887, 'Problems of the Future, and other Essays', 1889, 'The Antiquity of Man', 1891, and 'Human Origins', 1892, all written in a similar easy and interesting style. Without possessing in themselves any great scientific value, these works showed Laing's reading, especially in anthropology, to have been extremely wide, and furnished people with general ideas on subjects of importance which, if discussed in a less attractive form, would probably have passed unheeded. 
Laing died, aged eighty-six, at his home, Rockhills, Sydenham Hill, London, on 6 August 1897, and was buried on 10 August in the extramural cemetery, Brighton. 
Laing's writings are remarkable as the relaxations of a man who had spent over half a century almost exclusively immersed in business affairs. He never attained to quite the same thoroughness and grip of his subject as his father, but he had much the same gift of lucid exposition, and the same freedom from self-consciousness or affectation.

Laing, William (1764-1832), bookseller and publisher, was born in Edinburgh on 20 July 1764, the son of William Laing (1729-1795), merchant tailor, and Mary, 'nee' Strachan ('b'. 1721). After education at the Canongate Grammar School, he was an apprentice compositor between 1778 and 1784. Thereafter, owing to weak eyesight, he set himself up as a bookseller and stationer, and prospered. Specializing in secondhand material, particularly foreign books, he filled a lacuna in the Edinburgh trade. His business was first situated at the head of the Canongate, but subsequently moved eastwards to Chessel's Court. He became a burgess and freeman of the burgh of the Canongate on 13 March 1786, and in September of that year he married Helen Kirk (1767-1837). They had twelve children, of whom four sons and five daughters reached adulthood. In 1804 he moved his business to 44 South Bridge, but finally settled at 49 South Bridge in 1805. His second son, the antiquary David Laing (1793-1878), joined the thriving business in 1806. From 1786 Laing issued annual catalogues. William Laing travelled abroad several times for stock, notably to Paris in 1793, Copenhagen in 1799 (to buy duplicates from the Royal Library), and France and the Netherlands in May 1802. 
By the late 1780s Laing had also expanded into publishing. The publications dearest to his heart were editions of Greek classics, with Latin translations: Thucydides (six volumes) in 1804; Herodotus (seven volumes) in 1806; and Xenophon (ten volumes) in 1811. Laing would have liked to continue with Plato and Demosthenes, but editorial difficulties proved insurmountable. 
Another business venture, financially very rewarding, was involvement in the establishment of the Commercial Bank in 1810, of which Laing became a director in 1825. Having moved home several times, Laing purchased Ramsay Lodge, a large house on Lauriston Place, in 1803. He died there on 10 April 1832, and was buried in the new Calton cemetery on 12 April 1832.

Laird, John (1805-1874), shipbuilder, was born in Greenock on 14 June 1805, the eldest son of William Laird and Agnes Macgregor, and brother of Macgregor Laird. His father moved south in 1810, eventually establishing a boiler works on Merseyside, the Birkenhead ironworks. After his education at the Royal Institution, Liverpool, and after training as a solicitor, Laird entered the business in 1828. He married, in 1829, Elizabeth, daughter of Nicholas Hurry of Liverpool, with whom he had a family, including at least one daughter. At about the same time the works built an iron lighter of 60 tons, the 'Wye', for use on inland waterways in Ireland. It was the first of a number of iron vessels to be constructed by Laird. In 1833 a paddle-steamer, the 'Lady Lansdowne', followed. Like the 'Wye' it was built in sections for reassembly and use in Ireland. In 1834 he built another prefabricated vessel, the 'John Randolph', for G. B. Lamar of Savannah, the first iron ship to be built for an American owner. Another paddle-steamer, the 'Garryowen', was built at this time, again for use in Ireland. Prefabricated riverboats became a speciality and Laird provided the 'Tigris' and 'Euphrates' in 1835, with which F. R. Chesney explored the Euphrates. Other achievements included the construction of the 'Rainbow', then the largest iron ship of its day; the 'Robert F. Stockton', a screw-steamer; and the 'Nemesis', a gunboat which established a formidable reputation in the opium wars with China. The Admiralty eventually joined the East India Company as customers, ordering the 'Dover' in 1839. 
The momentum of innovation slackened somewhat after this, although the yard was later to provide mortar vessels and gunboats for service in the Crimean War, as well as the river boat 'Ma Robert' for David Livingstone in 1858. In 1861 Laird retired from the business, which was carried on by his three sons, William, John, and Henry, under the style of Laird Brothers, eventually becoming Cammell Laird & Co. Ltd in 1903 when the company merged with the Sheffield steelmakers Johnson, Cammell & Co. Laird was elected as a Conservative to be Birkenhead's first MP in December 1861, a position he retained until his death. He had occupied a prominent position locally for some years prior to this, serving as a member of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board and as chairman of Birkenhead Improvement Commission. He died on 29 October 1874 at his home, 63 Hamilton Square, Birkenhead, following a riding accident.

Laird, Macgregor (1808-1861), shipbuilder and explorer, was born in Greenock, the younger son of William Laird, founder of the Birkenhead firm of shipbuilders, and Agnes Macgregor; he was the brother of John Laird. On leaving school in Edinburgh he was given a partnership in the business by his father. 
The existence of the Niger River, rumoured since antiquity, was confirmed by explorers who had struck its course inland, but failed to discover its mouth. In 1830 the problem of the mouth of the Niger was suddenly solved by Richard and John Lander, who had sailed down the river from Busa, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean from the River Nun, one of the 'oil rivers', where African coastal middlemen were shifting attention from the slave trade (made illegal for British subjects in 1807) to supplying palm oil to Liverpool traders for the growing soap industry in Cheshire. 
Laird was so fired by enthusiasm at this discovery that he left his father's firm to form the African Inland Company. Richard Lander joined the enterprise, advising that a profit could be made from ivory and indigo trading. Laird built two paddle-wheeled steamers designed to make the ocean voyage to west Africa and ascend the shallow waters to be found on much of the Niger. One of them, the 'Alburkah', 55 tons, would make maritime history as the first vessel constructed entirely of iron to complete an ocean voyage. Laird unsuccessfully approached the British government for financial subsidy. He saw his ambitions for trade, shipping innovation, and exploration as serving the higher purpose of striking 'a mortal blow to that debasing and demoralizing traffic which had for centuries cursed that unhappy land' and 'to be the means of rescuing millions of... fellow men from the miseries of a religion characterized by violence and blood, by imparting to them the truths of Christianity' (Howard and Plumb, 388). 
As a technical and exploration venture, the expedition of 1832-4 was successful; the 'Alburkah' proved the feasibility of the iron steamship and Laird and his crews penetrated the 550 miles from the sea to the confluence of the Niger and Benue, and a further 80 miles up the latter. Overall, however, the expedition was a disaster. Trading was not profitable, and the ships were attacked returning down the Niger at Aboh by African middlemen traders, despite the fact that Laird had wisely, on Lander's advice, kept out of the palm-oil trade. Lander and three others were killed in this affray. The toll of disease was dreadful. Of the forty-eight white men who began the venture in 1832, only nine survived when it ended in 1834. The major killer was malaria, for which there was no treatment. Laird himself was seriously ill, and his health never fully recovered. He vowed to make no more inland expeditions until a cure could be found. 
For almost twenty years thereafter Laird remained mainly an observer of the west African scene, publicly resisting efforts at inland penetration such as the disastrous Niger expedition of 1841, sponsored by the anti-slavery movement with government support, whose death rate amply justified Laird's warnings. Until the end of the 1840s Laird concentrated on the development of transatlantic steamships. In 1837 he was one of the founders of the British and North American Steam Navigation Company, whose vessel the 'Sirius' made the first completely steam-powered Atlantic crossing in 1838. He remained immersed in the problems of iron steamship technology, taking out a number of patents in the field, until 1850, by which time he had moved from Birkenhead to London. 
In 1851 Laird made the decision to concentrate his activities once again on west Africa, this time by providing a regular ocean steamship service to the main ports. He pressed the British government for help, and in January 1852 was awarded a mail contract for ten years with annual subsidies starting at $23,250 and decreasing to $18,750 in the final year. Laird was then able to found the African Steamship Company, with a paid-up capital of $132,842. Though experiencing financial difficulties in the first few years, the company was well established and profitable by 1860, operating seven steamships carrying mail, cargo, and passengers on a regular basis from Liverpool (to which it moved from London in 1856), calling at the main ports where British traders were present between Freetown and Fernando Po. Small traders, including Africans, began to ship goods and compete with the larger firms. 
In 1854 Laird returned once again to his earlier ideas of Niger penetration. The catalyst appears to have been William Balfour Baikie, surgeon and naval officer in west Africa, who proposed to give daily doses of quinine, an ancient South American Indian malaria treatment hitherto ignored by European medical authorities. Laird secured a British government contract to build and equip a vessel to ascend the Niger and Benue. The expedition of 1854, under Baikie's command, was as successful as that of 1832-4 had been disastrous. Thanks to quinine, not a single member of the expedition died. Laird now moved to place the Niger enterprise on a permanent footing. In 1857 he contracted with the Admiralty to send a steamer up the Niger annually for five years in return for a subsidy. These new expeditions, however, were less successful. The African coastal middlemen, armed by Liverpool traders, were determined to keep others out of the palm-oil trade of the lower Niger. In 1859 Laird's steamer laden with produce was attacked. Soon afterwards his station at Aboh was sacked. For the next two years he was involved in bitter exchanges with the Foreign Office over the failure of the navy to protect his vessels, and what subsidies he should be paid. 
None of these questions were resolved when Laird died at 1 Surbiton Crescent, Surrey, on 27 January 1861, aged fifty-two. He had been married and he left children, but no further details are known. His career epitomized beliefs and qualities that came to symbolize the Victorian age. An ardent evangelical protestant and opponent of the slave trade, he shared the view that Africa could be 'civilized' through the beneficent alliance of Christian missionary activity and 'legitimate commerce' replacing trade in human beings.

Lake, Arthur (bap. 1567, d. 1626), bishop of Bath and Wells, was the son of Almeric Lake (1519-1594), a burgess of Southampton; he was a younger brother of Sir Thomas Lake, secretary of state to James I. He was baptized in St Michael's Church, Southampton, on 30 September 1567 and educated at King Edward's Grammar School, Southampton, during the headmastership of the eminent Walloon divine, Adrian (or Hadrian) Savaria. From there, in each case as a scholar, he went first to Winchester College, in 1581, and then to New College, Oxford, in 1587. He graduated BA in 1591 and proceeded MA in 1595, and BD and DD in 1605, when he was allowed to defer some of the academic exercises owing to his work in London on the translation of the 'New Testament', for what became the King James 'Bible'. Lake was fellow of New College from 1589 to 1600, and fellow of Winchester from 1600. Several letters survive from his time as an Oxford tutor, including reports to parents on their sons' progress accompanied by accounts to be settled such as bills for lessons in French and singing, and for broken windows. 
Lake received a series of benefices in his native Hampshire, first at Havant (1599-1601) from the crown, then at Hambledon (1601-3) and Chilcomb (1603-6) from Bishop Thomas Bilson of Winchester, and at Stoke Charity (1605-8) on the presentation of Sir Thomas Clark. By 1603 Bilson had made Lake his chaplain, and in 1605 he promoted him to the archdeaconry of Surrey. Although most of the archidiaconal records for his time are lost, Lake did sit as a judge in the diocesan high commission at Bishop's Waltham from 1606 to 1608 and was one of Archbishop Richard Bancroft's commissaries for his visitation of Winchester diocese in 1607. 
Lake's major patron was his brother, Sir Thomas, who secured him the mastership of St Cross Hospital in Winchester in 1603, the deanery of Worcester in 1608, the wardenship of New College in 1613, and, in 1616, the bishopric of Bath and Wells. As dean of Worcester Lake helped to recover a lease let contrary to law, and together with the organist, Thomas Tomkins, oversaw the construction of a new organ and in 1612 composed an anthem, 'Know ye not that a prince, a great prince, is fallen this day in Israel', for the funeral day of Prince Henry. Lake's wide intellectual interests led him in 1616 to endow lectureships in mathematics and Hebrew at New College, and volumes on history, geography, and Arabic grammar as well as theology are well represented in the substantial benefaction of books he made to the college in 1617. On his return to New College in 1613 he acquired the rectory of Stanton St John, a college living, and served as vice-chancellor of Oxford in 1616/17, remaining at Oxford until the end of the academic year despite his consecration as bishop of Bath and Wells on 8 December 1616. 
Thereafter Lake lived in his diocese, where he was an energetic governor in spiritual and secular affairs. He personally conducted his three visitations of 1617, 1620, and 1623, and regularly heard disciplinary cases, usually in his episcopal palace at Wells. His diocesan government was facilitated by his friendship with many key officials, including Archdeacon Timothy Rivett of Bath, Archdeacon Samuel Ward of Taunton, his chancellor, Arthur Duck, and, from 1621, the new dean of Wells, Ralph Barlow. Lake's central concern as bishop was to spread the gospel. At Oxford he had been a distinguished preacher, with no less a figure than John Rainolds procuring copies of his sermons, and at Bath and Wells he delivered courses of sermons in the cathedral, and also preached on visitation, at the ordination of ministers, and at the public penance of those found guilty of incest, schism, and other crimes, the latter being a practice unparalleled among his fellow bishops. Lake probably also preached at local combination lectures, and certainly maintained close links with the clerical preaching elite of Somerset, which included puritans such as Richard Bernard of Batcombe and William Sclater of Pitminster; Sclater, indeed, became Lake's chaplain. 
Lake brought into the diocese a number of preachers educated at New College, and was the last Jacobean bishop to require non-preaching ministers to undertake theological exercises to deepen their knowledge and improve their chances of qualifying for preaching licences. He also founded a public library at Bath Abbey for the benefit of local clergy. His evangelical fervour even embraced the New World, for in a fast sermon before the House of Lords in July 1625 he urged that the gospel be taken to the American Indians, and told John White of Dorchester, his fellow collegian and founder of the Massachusetts Bay Company, that but for his age he would accompany him to the New World. 
Although Lake was merely one of a number of preaching pastors on the Jacobean bench of bishops, his career and diocesan work is unusually well documented. Often indulgent towards moderate puritans, Lake did not share their entrenched hostility to the Church of Rome, and counted among his friends at least one former recusant, Lady Elizabeth Booth of Bath. Lake espoused a moderate Calvinism, holding to the doctrine of hypothetical universalism, and was acutely conscious of the divisive consequences for parish religion of controversial divinity, a point which he emphasized in his sermons, and in private advice to Samuel Ward in 1618, while Ward was attending the Synod of Dort. Lake is the only Jacobean bishop whose diocesan sermons survive in bulk, and many contain clear expositions of scripture and hark on perennial themes such as repentance, faith, and self-knowledge. 
Lake never married. He fell ill in London while attending parliament, and died on 4 May 1626, having made his last confession to his friend, Bishop Nicholas Felton of Ely. He was buried in Wells Cathedral, though without the pleasing epitaph, a play on 'Ezekiel' 47, which he had specified in his will. On the other hand, Lake's expressed wish that his sermons be published 'for the good of younger students' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/152/99) was observed: a folio volume appeared in 1629, containing ninety-nine sermons preached at Oxford, London, and the court, as well as in Somerset, together with eleven religious meditations, all prefaced by 'A short view of the author' by John Harris, who had been a fellow under Lake at New College. Harris's panegyric places Lake in the tradition of primitive episcopacy, and though some of his claims are unverifiable or dubious, others are vindicated by the record. 'Ten Sermons upon Severall Occasions', originally preached at Paul's Cross and Winchester, appeared in 1640, and Lake's 'Theses de Sabbato' was published in 1641, appended to 'Of the Morality of the Fourth Commandment' by William Twisse, another fellow of New College in Lake's time as warden. Six sermons by Lake at Worcester in 1613 were prepared for publication in 1661 but remained in manuscript (Folger Shakespeare Library, V.a.394).

Lake, Sir Edward, baronet (1596x1600-1674), royalist army officer, was the eldest son of Richard Lake of Irby-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, and Anne, youngest daughter and coheir of Edward Wardell of Keelby in the same county. He graduated BA from St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1626, was incorporated in the same degree at Oxford on 15 December 1627, and was admitted bachelor of civil law on 24 January 1628 as a member of St Alban Hall, Oxford. He ultimately took his doctor's degree, practised as a civilian, and in May 1639 became advocate-general for Ireland, where he served as MP for the borough of Cavan from 1639 until his expulsion on 9 November 1640. 
On the outbreak of the civil war Lake both fought, and reputedly wrote, on the king's side; 'A Just Apology for his Sacred Majestie' (1642) has been attributed to him. At the battle of Edgehill he earned fame, and royal gratitude, for a signal act of heroism when, having lost the use of his left hand by a shot, he placed his horse's bridle between his teeth and fought with his sword in his right hand. He received sixteen wounds, was taken prisoner, and detained seven weeks at Great Crosby, Lancashire. He managed to escape and by Christmas 1642 was safe at Bangor, Caernarvonshire. On 20 October 1643 he arrived at Oxford, and on the 23rd, the anniversary of Edgehill, was kindly received by the king. He was promised a baronetcy, granted by a warrant for a patent which never passed the great seal, as well as the honour of an augmentation to his arms incorporating a royal lion, besides some compensation for the loss of his estate in England and Ireland. Two months afterwards the king sent him to Worcester. At the Restoration, Lake petitioned importunately for preferment claiming he had been promised mastership of the rolls in Ireland and a grant of forfeited lands worth $600 a year, but had to content himself with the chancellorship of the diocese of Lincoln. He was granted the title of baronet by a patent dated 10 July 1661. 
At Lincoln, Lake occupied the front line in the war between orthodoxy and dissent, having played his own small part in the unfolding Restoration church settlement with the publication in 1662 of his 'Memoranda: Touching the Oath ex officio'. In 1666 a nonconformist barrister named Edward King of Ashby, Lincolnshire, charged him before the committee of parliament for grievances with extortion and illegal conduct. King printed his petition and circulated it throughout the county. Lake published an elaborate 'Answer' which apparently satisfied the committee, but his struggles with the highly litigious, and highly effective, King ran the chancellor ragged. Although Lake fought back, he was repeatedly worsted, then left high and dry by his royal master's declaration of indulgence against which he protested in 1672. He died on 18 July 1674, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 20 July, where his monument describes him as of Bishop's Norton, Lincolnshire. His wife, Anne, eldest daughter and coheir of Simon Bibye of Buckden, Huntingdonshire, died in or before 1670. The couple had at least one child, Edward, who died an infant before 1666. Lake was succeeded in his title by his grandnephew, Bibye Lake (1684-1744), who petitioned Queen Anne on the nature of Charles I's award to his great-uncle; Lake was granted the title of first baronet in 1711.

Lake, Edward (1641-1704), Church of England clergyman, was born in Exeter on 10 November 1641, the son of James Lake (1612/13-1678), rector of St Pancras in that city, later vicar of Veryan, Cornwall (1642-61), and canon of Exeter Cathedral (1660-78). Edward Lake matriculated (as Andrew Lake) from Wadham College, Oxford, on 31 July 1658 as a commoner and was elected a scholar of his college on 23 September 1659, but moved to Cambridge before graduating; however, there is no record of his college or graduation at Cambridge. In his early career he seems to have been connected to the family of John Grenville, first earl of Bath. He was made rector of Norton, Kent, in 1669, a living that he held until 1683. 
About 1670 Lake became chaplain and tutor to the princesses Mary and Anne, daughters of James, duke of York. Lake's published diary for 1677-8 gives details of Mary's marriage to William of Orange and of the appointment of William Sancroft as archbishop of Canterbury (an appointment that surprised Lake, given Sancroft's then relatively lowly position as dean of St Paul's). When Princess Anne was taken ill with smallpox, the duke of York forbade Lake from attending her. Lake suspected that this was not to prevent the spread of the disease, but so that Anne's Catholic nurse could exert a greater influence over her. When Lake took his concerns to Henry Compton, bishop of London, the bishop contradicted James's orders and insisted that Lake minister to the princess. 
Lake was disappointed in his hope of accompanying Princess Mary to Holland but nevertheless, despite this friction, went on to serve as chaplain to the duke of York in what seems to have been an effective and cordial working relationship, accompanying him to Scotland in 1679 and, while there, interviewing the Cameronian rebels in prison. Lake was appointed a prebendary of Exeter on 13 December 1675 and archdeacon of Exeter on 24 October 1676. That same year he was created DD at Cambridge by royal mandate. On 5 January 1681 he was elected a brother of St Katharine's Hospital (a charitable foundation attached to St Katharine by the Tower), of which he was also a commissary. (He resigned his patent for this last office on 10 November 1698.) On 30 November 1682 he was instituted to the rectory of St Mary-at-Hill, London, to which was annexed in 1700 that of St Andrew Hubbard. 
Lake is best known as the author of 'Officium eucharisticum' (1673), a devotional manual which was designed for his royal pupils but which became very popular and went through more than thirty editions. Later versions of the work featured additions that some felt smacked of Catholicism, but these alterations do not appear to have been the work of the author. He was also a popular preacher, delivering a sermon in 1684 to the lord mayor of London on the political dangers of all types of puritanism. As evidence he related his experience of the covenanter rebels while in Scotland in the service of the duke. Despite his closeness to James II, Lake appears to have had no problems in giving his allegiance to William III in 1689. Indeed, he seems to have been overtly hostile to some nonjurors, Sancroft accusing him of spreading malicious rumours about him in 1690. 
With his wife, Margaret (1638-1712), Lake had three daughters who survived him, Mary, Ann, and Frances, who married William Taswell DD on 21 May 1695 at St Mary-at-Hill. Taswell later published a collection of sixteen of Lake's sermons. Lake died on 1 February 1704, probably in the parish of St Mary-at-Hill, and was buried at St Katharine by the Tower, London. The inscription on his monument in the church shows that his friends thought he had been inadequately rewarded for his efforts. An engraved portrait of Lake was made by M. Van der Gucht and is reproduced in some copies of Lake's 'Officium eucharisticum'.

Lake, Edward John (1823-1877), army officer, born at Madras on 19 June 1823, was the son of Edward Lake (died 1829), major in the Madras engineers, who served with distinction in the Anglo-Maratha War of 1817, and was author of 'Sieges of the Madras Army'. Sent to England with a sister at an early age, Edward was left an orphan when six years old by the sinking at sea of the ship 'Guildford', in which his parents with their four younger children were returning home. He was brought up by his grandfather Admiral Sir Willoughby Lake, who sent him to Mr Stoton's private school at Wimbledon. He afterwards entered Addiscombe College (1839-40), passing in three terms instead of the usual four and winning the first mathematical prize. Commissioned second lieutenant, Bengal Engineers, on 11 June 1840, he spent a year at the Royal Engineer Establishment, Chatham, and then went to India. He arrived on 30 July 1842, and was posted to the Bengal Sappers and Miners at Delhi. 
Shortly after his arrival at Delhi, Lake was sent with a company of sappers to suppress an outbreak at Kaithal, near Karnal, where he made the acquaintance of Henry and John Lawrence. He was for a time employed in road making under Henry Lawrence. He was promoted lieutenant on 19 February 1844. During the autumn of 1845 he served as a settlement officer in the Ambala district under Major George Broadfoot. On the outbreak of the First Anglo-Sikh War that year he was ordered to the Sutlej, and joined Lord Hardinge in time to be present at the battle of Mudki on 18 December, when he had a horse shot under him and was himself severely wounded in the hand. After the battle he was sent to the frontier station of Ludhiana, where he strengthened the defences and forwarded troops and supplies to the army in the field. When Sir Harry Smith's camp equipage fell into the hands of the enemy just before the battle of Aliwal -- at which Lake was present -- Lake was able to replace it, and received the commendation of the governor-general. 
On the restoration of peace in March 1846, the trans-Sutlej territory of the Jullundur Doab was made over to the British as a material guarantee. John Lawrence was appointed commissioner for the newly acquired territory, and Lake was nominated one of his assistants and placed in charge of the Kangra district, with headquarters at Nurpur, but was soon moved to Jullundur. In May 1848, when Sir Henry Lawrence, the commissioner of the Punjab, had left India on furlough to England, open hostility was shown by Mulraj, governor of Multan, and his turbulent Sikhs; Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew and Lieutenant Anderson were murdered, and the Punjab was ablaze. Herbert Edwardes, who was in political charge of the Dera Ismail Khan district and nearest to Multan, hastily collected a body of Pathans and managed to hold his own against Mulraj. Lake was specially selected as political officer to the friendly Muslim nawab of Bahawalpure, whose territories adjoined the Punjab, and in virtual command of the nawab's troops he co-operated with his old friend Edwardes. He took part on 1 July in the second battle of Suddoosam, close to Multan, and for seven months was engaged in the operations for the capture of Multan before it fell. Lake, then only a lieutenant like Edwardes, was in fact commander-in-chief of the Davodpootra army, and although directed to co-operate with Edwardes, and in no way under his orders, he nevertheless magnanimously subordinated himself, and was content to do his utmost to further his friend's plans. On the fall of Multan, Lake was again in the field, and took part in the final victory of Gujrat on 21 February 1849. He accompanied General Gilbert to the Indus in his pursuit of the Afghans, and was present at Rawalpindi when the Sikh army laid down its arms. 
Lake next went to Batala, and for two years had charge, under John (afterwards Lord) Lawrence, of the northern portion of the country between the rivers Beas and Ravi. In 1852 he went home on furlough, travelling through Russia, Prussia, Norway, and Sweden. He returned to India in 1854, having been promoted captain on 21 August and brevet major on 22 August for his services in the Punjab campaign. He took up his old charge in the trans-Sutlej province at Kangra as deputy commissioner. In 1855 he was appointed commissioner of the Jullundur Doab. When the Indian mutiny broke out in 1857, Lake occupied and secured the fort of Kangra against the mutineers, and held it until the rising was suppressed. His calmness and resource were an asset to the government throughout the crisis. 
In 1860 Lake's health failed, and he was obliged to go to England. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 18 February 1861. In July 1861 he married Elizabeth Penrose, youngest daughter of T. Bewes of Beaumont, Plymouth; their only child died at Lahore in 1864. Lake returned to his post at Jullundur in the same year. In 1865 he was appointed financial commissioner of the Punjab, and the following year was made a CSI. In 1867 ill health again compelled him to go to England, and subsequently to decline Lord Lawrence's offer of the much coveted appointment of resident of Hyderabad. He had been promoted colonel on 31 December 1868. On 1 January 1870 he retired on a pension with the honorary rank of major-general. After he left India the Lake scholarship was founded by public subscription in January 1870 in his honour at the Lahore high school. 
About 1855 Lake had undergone a religious conversion. In India he held 'Bible' study for officers, and 'Bible' readings for soldiers, and helped missions. He became in 1868 honorary secretary of the East London Mission Relief Fund, of which his friend Lord Lawrence was chairman, and worked hard between 1869 and 1876 as honorary lay secretary of the Church Missionary Society. From April 1871 to June 1874 he was sole editor of the 'Church Missionary Record', and contributed articles to the 'Church Missionary Intelligencer', the 'Sunday at Home', and other publications. In 1873 he edited the fifth edition of the 'Church Missionary Atlas', and was engaged on another edition at the time of his death. He disliked 'departures from the simple forms of a reverent and reasonable service' (Barton and Maclagan, 79). 
Lake was a man of slight and delicate frame, with a cheery and lovable disposition. He had great aptitude for business, and much tact in relations with Indians, who called him Lake Sahib, and by whom he was reportedly much loved. Lord Lawrence, Sir Robert Montgomery, and other eminent administrators had a very high opinion of him. In the summer of 1876 lung disease made it necessary for Lake to move from London to Bournemouth, and in the following spring he went to Clifton. He died at 10 Prince's Buildings, Clifton, near Bristol, on 7 June 1877, and was survived by his wife. He was buried on 13 June in Long Ashton churchyard, near Clifton.

Lake, Gerard, first Viscount Lake of Delhi (1744-1808), army officer, the elder son of Lancelot Charles Lake (died 1751) of Flambards, Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, and his wife, Letitia (died 1760), daughter of John Gumley, glass manufacturer and army contractor, of Isleworth, Middlesex, was born on 27 July 1744. 
Educated at Eton College (1755-6), he was appointed ensign in the 1st foot guards on 9 May 1758, and served with the 2nd battalion in the campaigns in Germany in 1760-62. After displaying enterprise at the battle of Wilhelmstadt, near Kassel, he was appointed aide-de-camp to General Sir Richard Pearson, and lieutenant and captain on 3 January 1762. He married on 26 June 1770 Elizabeth (1751-1798), only daughter of Edward Barker, sometime consul at Tripoli, of St Julian's, Hertfordshire: they had three sons and five daughters. 
In 1776 Lake was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel and appointed to the household of the prince of Wales, probably because the king hoped he would have a beneficial influence on the prince. His relationship with the prince was close, at least in the early years. In 1781 he went with drafts to America and served in the campaign in North Carolina under Lord Cornwallis. With the force trapped in Yorktown at the end of September 1781, on 16 October he led one element of a desperate attempt under Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Abercromby to force redoubts and destroy guns threatening the encampment. After the surrender of Yorktown, Lake was a prisoner on parole until the end of the war. He was appointed a regimental major on 20 October 1784. 
First equerry to the prince of Wales, 1780-86 and 1787-96, and gentleman attendant on him from 1796 until his death, Lake devoted several years chiefly to managing the prince's stables. He also indulged his own passion for gambling. At a by-election in 1789 he unsuccessfully contested the venal householder borough of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Supported by his fellow members of the Buckinghamshire Independent Club, led by the duke of Portland, Lake spent lavishly at Aylesbury. He was elected unopposed at the 1790 general election, and again in 1796. He voted with the whig opposition on the Ochakov question (April 1791 and March 1792), and in December 1792 was listed as 'supposed attached' to the duke of Portland. He retired from parliament at the 1802 dissolution. 
Lake became a major-general in 1790 and a regimental lieutenant-colonel in 1792. In February 1793 he embarked in command of a brigade composed of the 1st battalions of the three regiments of foot guards. This force was present at the siege of Valenciennes and achieved a significant if costly local victory against the French at Lincelles, near Lille. Lake was invalided home in September 1793 and, although able to rejoin the duke of York briefly the following year, was again sent home in April 1794. That month he was appointed colonel of the 53rd foot and in November 1796 transferred to the 73rd foot. 
In December 1796 Lake was appointed to the command in Ulster, under Henry Luttrell (later Lord Carhampton) as commander-in-chief. He became a lieutenant-general in January 1797. In early spring 1797 Lake, in command of a mixed force of militia, yeomanry, and fencibles, was ordered by John Jeffreys, Earl Camden (lord lieutenant 1795-8), to use all methods to disarm Ulster. The Irish government 'meant to strike terror' (Camden to Portland, 3 Nov 1797, Bartlett, 270) and the harsh measures of house burning, flogging, and mass arrests greatly weakened the United Irishmen and secured large quantities of arms. When General Sir Ralph Abercromby, commander-in-chief from late 1797, who had indicated his disapproval of the policy of Dublin Castle, in February 1798 issued a general order condemning the absence of control of the Irish armed forces, especially the militia, Camden welcomed his resignation, and Lake succeeded to the command on 25 April 1798. 
Lake again used harsh methods, including an order to take no prisoners, following the outbreak of rebellion in the south of Ireland on 24 May 1798. Although the rebels gained Wexford, they failed in an assault on Arklow and withdrew. After reinforcements arrived from England, Lake was able to assemble the army which, after an artillery attack and two hours of desperate fighting at Vinegar Hill, near Enniscorthy, finally crushed the rebellion in Wexford; Lake entered Wexford on 22 June 1798. Following the arrival of Cornwallis as lord lieutenant and commander-in-chief on 20 June 1798, Lake reverted to the command in Leitrim. After a French force of some 1100 men commanded by General Joseph Humbert landed in Killala Bay in late August, Lake was sent to Galway. Lake confronted the French at Castlebar with a mixed force of Irish militia, English and Scottish fencibles, and some regulars. His force broke in panic before a French bayonet charge. However, other detachments converged on Humbert, who had not been reinforced from France, and on 8 September the French surrendered at Ballinamuck. Lake was elected to the Irish parliament as member for Armagh to help secure passage of the 'Act of Union', but left Ireland in 1799. 
In 1800 Lake was appointed commander-in-chief and second member of the supreme council in India. After landing at Calcutta on 31 January 1801, and making an initial tour of inspection, he set up his headquarters at Cawnpore. He devoted much attention to improving military method in the Bengal army and introduced galloper guns into the cavalry and light troops into the infantry. After the conclusion of a treaty with the nawab of Oudh in November 1801, Lake was involved in the spring of 1802 in the pacification of parts of the Jumna-Ganges Doab, including the territory of Balwant Singh of Sasni. 
The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-5) was the climax of Lake's military career. In March 1803, following the conclusion of the treaty of Bassein with the Peshwa Baji Rao, the Madras government assembled a considerable force in the northern part of Mysore, to aid him in the restoration of his authority within the Maratha confederacy. The governor-general, Richard, Marquess Wellesley, left it to Lake to decide whether he should command this force himself or remain in Oudh. As the force assembled at Harihar under the command of Major-General Arthur Wellesley moved forward into Maratha territory, Lake prepared the force in Oudh designed to bring pressure on Daulat Rao Sindhia of Ujjain to accept the changed relationship of the Peshwa to the East India Company. Lake knew that the French adventurer General Perron, whose control of part of northern India under the nominal sovereignty of Sindhia amounted to independent statehood, was both creating a further brigade of infantry and seeking permission from Wellesley to withdraw into British territory. In early May 1803 Lake was directed to prepare a force to be based near the Jumna for use after the monsoon. The movement of Raghoji Bhonsla of Nagpur with his army to unite with Sindhia in early June was seen as indicating a hostile intention, and at the end of June Lake took precautionary measures. Word of these crossed with instructions from the governor-general that gave to both Lake and Arthur Wellesley wide delegated political and military powers. The alliance of the Maratha rulers was expected to 'vanish upon the approach of the British force' (R. Wellesley to Lake, 28 June 1803, 'Despatches', 3.164). This optimism was shared by Lake: 'I think Perron once beat... little is to be apprehended' (Lake to R. Wellesley, 9 July 1803, BL, Add. MS 13742, fol. 46). The governor-general sent Graeme Mercer as a political adviser. Lake, who had visited Agra, felt able to assure Fort William that he would consider its seizure 'by a 'coup de main'' (Lake to M. Shawe, 17 July 1803, BL, Add. MS 13741, fol. 144). Lake had information on the deployment and the strength of Perron's force, hoped to negotiate the withdrawal of Perron from the command of Sindhia's army in Hindustan, and believed that some of his European officers could be suborned. 
Lake moved forward, planning to proceed to the frontier, 'where I shall assemble my force and where I shall hope shortly to accomplish your wishes, by negotiation or otherwise' (Lake to Marquess Wellesley, 2 Aug 1803, BL, Add. MS 13742, fol. 101). He considered that letters from the Deccan 'fully authorise me... to commence hostilities if M. Perron does not incline to negotiation, which from his opening a correspondence with me I rather believe he does' (Lake to Marquess Wellesley, 10 Aug 1803, BL, Add. MS 13741, fol. 151). By 18 August Lake knew that Perron was removing treasure from Coel, possibly to Agra. Four days later he had confirmation of the intended desertion of officers in the service of Sindhia. On 27 August the force of three brigades of cavalry, four of infantry, and 65 guns crossed the Maratha frontier. 
On 29 August Lake was able to displace a Maratha infantry and cavalry force and establish a position before Aligarh. He hoped to secure this fortress by bribery, but on 4 September resolved to attempt it by assault. It was captured by an hour's heavy fighting, aided by guidance of an officer who had recently left Sindhia's service. Perron negotiated with Lake, and secured a personal safe conduct. Lake moved forwards towards Delhi. On 11 September at Patpanganj the pickets found the Maratha army encamped in a strong position at close quarters. Lake reconnoitred, and attempted an assault with cavalry, who were exposed to casualties from Maratha artillery. He then feigned a withdrawal with the cavalry, which led the Maratha brigades incautiously to move forward, and moved his own infantry through the cavalry and then ordered a general charge with the bayonet. The Marathas retreated headlong, suffering some 3000 casualties, against British casualties of about 350. Lake could now move towards Delhi, and on 15 September was able to report that a group of French officers formerly in the service of Sindhia had surrendered. One of the symbolic scenes in the history of British India followed on 16 September, when Lake was received in the Red Fort by the Mughal emperor Shah Alam. 
Lake engaged irregular forces lately in the service of Perron for service with the British forces, and was able to report that 'no French officer of any consequence now remains in Sindhia's service' (Lake to R. Wellesley, 1 Oct 1803, 'Despatches', 3.390). Lake moved on to Agra, where the sepoys had arrested their European officers, but had no single alternative leader. Lake attempted, as he had done at Aligarh, to secure the fort by offering liberal terms of surrender, but this venture failed. On 10 October in an expensive operation, involving heavy casualties on both sides, Lake, using only Indian troops, took possession of the town and cleared the ravines to the south of the fort of Maratha forces. In the ravines was placed a powerful siege battery, the effectiveness of which led the divided garrison within the fort to release a French officer and through him agree terms of surrender. The extensive treasure in the fortress was distributed to the troops as prize money. 
Lake had known in early July that an extensive reinforcement of disciplined infantry had been sent northwards by Sindhia from the Deccan. They had been commanded in the first instance by the Frenchman Dudrenec, who deserted, and were now led by Ambaji Inglia, who, having been appointed by Sindhia to succeed Perron, himself had ambitions to rule again in Hindustan, and secretly negotiated with Lake. These forces moved away from Agra towards Jaipur. Lake left his heavy artillery, and by forced marches, eventually with cavalry only, arrived in the environs of the entire Maratha force, near Laswari. Lake ordered a cavalry assault which, although it pressed home, failed to dislodge the Maratha artillery and supporting infantry. There was a lull in the fighting during the middle of 1 November. On the British side the infantry had now arrived. On the Maratha, battalions not involved in the morning fighting had rejoined, and a double line of defences was created near the walled village of Mohalpur. Ambaji Inglia offered a conditional withdrawal secured by surrender of his guns, but failed to complete the negotiation in the limited time allowed. In a second attack with both infantry and cavalry, Lake attempted to outflank the Maratha position, which was strongly protected by artillery. The 76th suffered severely and Lake saved its position with a cavalry charge. He personally led two sepoy regiments in an attack on Mohalpur, while on the Maratha left flank the Deccani cavalry were put to flight, and the circle of cavalry units about the doomed Maratha infantry was completed by the movement of the two other brigades. A costly victory (822 men killed and wounded of a total force of 8000) at Laswari was also complete. It had, as Lake explained to Lord Wellesley, annihilated the regular force in northern India in Sindhia's service commanded by French officers. 
In negotiation Lake and Mercer now secured the transfer of the fortress of Gwalior and the conclusion with Ambaji Inglia of a treaty, destined not to be honoured, which gave him a position as a British ally. When troops were moved forward to secure Gwalior, the commander refused to yield it, although within twenty-four hours it was secured by negotiation: Ambaji Inglia was later informed that the action of the commandant had rendered the treaty with him invalid. Meantime, in the Deccan campaign of 1803, Arthur Wellesley had successively defeated the formed brigades of Sindhia at Assaye on 23 September and a force of both Sindhia and Raghoji Bhonsla at Argaon on 30 November, and captured Gawilgarh on 15 December. After negotiations conducted in his camp, Arthur Wellesley concluded the treaty of Deogaon on 17 December with Raghoji Bhonsla and, on 30 December, the treaty of Sarji Arjangaon with Daulat Rao Sindhia, securing as a result of the two campaigns, his own and that of Lake, extensive territorial cessions. 
The other major Maratha, Jaswant Rao Holkar, had stood aloof from the events of 1803, and while Sindhia and Bhonsla were preoccupied, had plundered extensively in central India. Lake sent to the governor-general letters from Holkar, friendly in tone, but noted that Holkar's 'actions do not appear to accord with his words' (Lake to Lord Wellesley, 28 Dec 1803, 'Despatches', 3.556). While hoping to avert hostilities, Lord Wellesley again gave Lake delegated political authority. Holkar agreed to send agents to negotiate, but continued to attempt to create hostile alliances. The agents presented hubristic demands in Lake's camp on 18 and 19 March 1804, and these Lake and Mercer rejected. In April Lake reported that he saw little prospect of peace with Holkar, and that forbearance had been ineffective. He feared that if he advanced, Holkar would enter and pillage recently acquired territory. On 16 May Lord Wellesley determined to initiate hostilities against Holkar, relying on a prospect of support from Sindhia, with whom a subsidiary alliance treaty had been concluded. 
Holkar withdrew precipitately from before Jaipur, after Lake had moved forward a detachment under Colonel the Hon. W. Monson, which was ordered to secure passes near Bundi and Lakheri. A limited force from Sindhia moved north from Ujjain. But Holkar had withdrawn onto his strength, artillery and infantry. Although Monson was able to move beyond Bundi through the Mukhandra Pass and capture Hinglaishghar, the news of a retreat near Badnawar on 1 July of a force under Colonel Murray that had advanced from Gujarat led Monson in turn to withdraw, and at this point Holkar was able to turn his full force upon him. An initial limited retreat, at first to Rampura, became by the persistent pressure of Holkar a disordered rout, ultimately to Agra at the end of August, with extensive desertions of both regular and irregular forces. 
To attempt to reverse the consequences of this defeat, Lake marched from Cawnpore on 2 September 1804, and reached Agra by the end of the month. Holkar besieged Delhi, and its capture was averted by a skilled defence commanded by Colonels David Ocherlony and James Burn. When Holkar attempted a cavalry irruption into British territory east of the Jumna, Lake after some noteworthy forced marches defeated him with a cavalry force at Farrukhabad on 16 November. General J. H. Fraser had meantime defeated an infantry and artillery concentration near Dig. The reunited army achieved the capture of the fortress of Dig on 25 December. Lake turned to the siege of Bharatpur, whose raja had repudiated an earlier subsidiary alliance, although having 'at his disposal fewer than 8,000 men and less than eighty pieces of ordnance' (Pemble, 388). The first two rushed attacks failed because the batteries had been laid too far from the walls and there had been insufficient reconnaissance. In a third assault the trench designed to give the storming parties cover was inadequate and the troops were exposed to withering fire. The fourth assault failed because the ladders were too few and too short. Ironically, after such a costly and prolonged blunder (450 men had been killed and 2500 wounded) word of Lake's appointment to the peerage arrived at this point -- he was created Baron Lake of Delhi and Laswary and Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire, on 13 September 1804 -- and the raja agreed to terms. The army had been before Bharatpur for three months and twenty days. 
Holkar had not been within Bharatpur, although his cavalry had contributed to the harrying of attackers and of convoys. In the last stages of the siege Mir Khan, one of the most successful of Holkar's commanders, had attempted a prolonged incursion into Rohilkhand, from which he had been expelled. At the same time Sindhia, who had permitted an attack on the camp of the British resident, moved north, ostensibly to mediate between the company and Holkar, but in reality with the intention of joining him. The combined forces of Sindhia and Holkar were assessed as 5000 regular infantry, 12,000 silledar horse, 12,000 pindaries, and 146 guns. Lake deployed his force during the monsoon in advanced positions and the two Maratha chiefs quarrelled, separated, and withdrew. At the end of his governor-generalship, when about to be succeeded by Lord Cornwallis, Lord Wellelsey again authorized Lake, now stationed at Mathura, to make preparations for active operations. 
Instructions from Cornwallis led to a rift between himself and Lake. Cornwallis considered the British in India over-extended; there were constant 'calls for reinforcements of men and for remittances of money' but 'little other profit except brilliant Gazettes' (Cornwallis to Lake, 30 Aug 1805, 'Correspondence of... Cornwallis', 3.544). Lake reacted badly to a statement by Cornwallis of their respective authority, Cornwallis having been again appointed, as in 1786, governor-general and commander-in-chief. Instructions from Cornwallis gave authority for an approach to Sindhia to secure a peace settlement, negotiated by Colonel John Malcolm and concluded in the treaty of Mustaphapur on 22 November. This settlement was significantly varied by Sir George Barlow, who had succeeded as governor-general on the death of Cornwallis (5 October 1805), under protest from Lake, in a way that ended British connections with states to the south and west of the Jumna. Lake at the same time received instructions drastically to reduce irregular forces to stem the drain on the finances. Lake formed a defensive line against Holkar, and in early November, as Holkar escaped into Sikh territory, attempted to secure their co-operation against 'a plunderer whose existence in any degree of power is I fear incompatible with the full restoration of peace in India' (Lake to Barlow, 11 Nov 1805, BL, Add. MS 13605, fol. 191). On receiving from Barlow instructions on a peace settlement with Holkar, which would transfer to Holkar extensive territories, including areas south of the Tapti, Lake followed him into the Punjab, crossing the Sutlej, and on the banks of the Beas, Malcolm presented agents from Holkar with a draft treaty, to be ratified in a limited time. An attempt to vary its terms was rejected, and on 7 January 1806 Lake was able to send Barlow the text of an agreed treaty. Barlow varied this treaty also, again under protest from Lake, giving further territorial cessions to Holkar. Lake then slowly withdrew his army, pausing at Delhi to complete arrangements with the Mughal emperor, proceeded to Cawnpore, and thence to Calcutta. He sailed for Britain on 9 February 1807. 
Lake was advanced to a viscountcy under the same designation as his barony on 4 November 1807 and took his seat in the House of Lords on 21 January 1808. He held various sinecures, including the receiver-generalship of the duchy of Cornwall from March 1807. Following a violent cold, caught while attending the court martial at Chelsea on 18 February, of Lieutenant-General Whitelocke, Lake died at his residence in Lower Brook Street, London, on 20 February 1808, aged sixty-three; he was buried on 5 March 1808 at Aston Clinton. 
A soldier's general, Lake achieved much on the battlefield by ferocious energy and tactical skill. Lake could command, and he retained the adherence of his soldiers. But he lacked political skill and the capacity to interpret intelligence, and by his misjudgment of Holkar in 1804 and his impetuosity before Bharatpur in 1805 he contributed to the failure of the last year of the governor-generalship of Richard Wellesley. He professed indifference to money and, despite gaining considerable prize money in 1803, his massive accumulated gambling debts ensured he did not die wealthy. On 29 February in the House of Commons, Lord Castlereagh proposed a pension of $2000 to Lake's next two heirs in succession. After a long debate -- in which opposition MPs opposed the pension and the reformer William Smith claimed that Lake had 'brought $140,000 from India, although the property of which he died possessed did not exceed $40,000 with an estate of $800 a year' ('GM', 248) -- the pension of $2000 was settled on the next two successors to the title, which became extinct after the death of Lake's second son, Warwick, the third viscount, on 24 June 1848.

Lake, Sir Henry Atwell (1808-1881), army officer, third son of Sir James Samuel William Lake, fourth baronet (died 1832), and his wife, Maria (died 1866), daughter of Samuel Turner, was born at Kenilworth, Warwickshire, on 15 December 1808. He was educated at Harrow School and at Addiscombe College. On 15 December 1826 he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Madras engineers, then went to India. Until 1854 he was employed in the public works department, principally on irrigation works. He became lieutenant on 4 March 1831, brevet captain on 22 July 1840, regimental captain in 1852, and brevet major on 20 June 1854. He married, on 14 April 1841, Anne (died 8 Jan 1847), daughter of the Revd Peregrine Curtois of The Longhills, Lincolnshire; they had two sons and two daughters. One son, Atwell Peregrine Macleod Lake (1842-1915), became an admiral. On 22 February 1848 he married Ann Augusta (died 20 Dec 1877), daughter of Sir William Curtis, second baronet; they had four sons and three daughters. 
While on leave in England in 1854 Lake volunteered for the Crimean War, and was sent to Kars as chief engineer and second in command to Colonel William Fenwick Williams. He became lieutenant-colonel on 9 February 1855. He strengthened the fortifications of Kars, and took a gallant and prominent part in the defence, including the repulse of the Russian forces under General Muravyov on 29 September 1855. On the surrender of Kars he was sent, with the other British officers, as a prisoner of war to Russia, where he remained until the peace in 1856. 
For his services at Kars, Lake received the thanks of parliament, was transferred to the British army as an unattached lieutenant-colonel, and was made a CB, aide-de-camp to the queen, and colonel in the army from 24 June 1856. He received the second class of the Mejidiye and the Legion d'honneur, and was given the rank of major-general in the Turkish army. On his arrival in England he was presented with a finely ornamented sword of honour and a silver salver by the inhabitants of Ramsgate, where his mother then resided, and where his family was well known. He published 'Kars and our Captivity in Russia' (1856) and 'Narrative of the Defence of Kars, Historical and Military, from Authentic Documents' (1857). 
Lake was placed on half pay on 12 September 1856, but next year accompanied the earl of Eglinton, lord lieutenant of Ireland, to Dublin as principal aide-de-camp, and in the following year retired from the army on his appointment as a commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, subsequently becoming chief commissioner of police in Dublin. In 1875 he was made a KCB of the civil division, and in 1877 he retired. He died at 63 Regency Square, Brighton, on 17 August 1881.

Lake, John (bap. 1624, d. 1689), bishop of Chichester, was born in Petticoat Lane, Halifax, Yorkshire, and was baptized on 5 December 1624, the first of the three children of Thomas Lake (died 1649), yeoman, 'grocer' to the local woollen trade, and Mary Moakson. He was educated in the Halifax grammar school and on 4 December 1637, at the age of thirteen, was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge. He became a Constable scholar on 9 November 1641 and graduated BA on 20 April 1642. After the war began, his college became a prison and he was confined for expressions of his loyalty to the king. He escaped to Oxford where he joined the king's army and continued to serve in it for about two years, receiving many dangerous wounds. He was at Basing House when it was taken and at Wallingford, one of the last garrisons that held out for Charles I. In 1647 he returned to Halifax, where he preached his first sermon on 26 July and on 19 October received clandestine ordination from Thomas Fuller, bishop of Ardfert. He married Judith Deane (1629-1700), daughter of Gilbert Deane of Exley Hall, one of the six clerks in chancery; they had eight children, but no grandchildren. As he was known to be a disaffected 'malignant', he moved to Prestwich-cum-Oldham in Lancashire where he became the curate in 1649 and acquired a house at Chadderton Fold near his royalist patron. Holding the living by subterfuges, he was able to defy the Manchester classis and was even approved briefly by the committee for plundered ministers. Eventually he lost the rectory of Prestwich and later, by the close of 1654, the chapel of Oldham. 
After the Restoration, Dean Marsh of York promoted Lake on 10 April 1661 from the curacy of Halifax to the vicarage of Leeds, but the presbyterians, who preferred the popular Edward Bowles as vicar, raised such opposition that at his induction soldiers had to be called in to keep the peace. The opposition then entered a petition in chancery which failed. In 1661 Lake sought and received a royal mandate for the degree of DD from Cambridge University. Having been chosen to preach the first convocation sermon at York after the Restoration, he had attracted the attention of Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, who later sent for him to hold the living of St Botolph without Bishopsgate (22 May 1663). While in London, he formed a friendship with William Sancroft, then dean of St Paul's, and after diligent service during the great plague and the fire he received the prebend of Holborn (1667-82). Two sermons were printed in 1671: a funeral sermon entitled ''Stephanos pistou', or, The True Christian Character and Crown Described', and one preached at Whitehall before the king on 29 May 1670. 
Dean Hitch of York made Lake his procurator in 1670 and resident prebendary of Fridaythorpe from 1670 to 1684. Lake also acquired the benefices of Prestwich-cum-Oldham (1669-85) and Carlton in Lindrick (1670-82), the prebend of Halloughton, Southwell (1670-82), and Bawtry Hospital (1671-82). As magistrate of the cathedral precinct, he attacked the bad custom of boys noisily walking about the nave of York Minster during divine service, often pulling off the hats of boys whom he found wearing them. In 1673, disregarding the advice of other canons, he determined to put a stop to a revel held by the apprentices in the bell tower on Shrove Tuesday and so antagonized the revellers that two files of musketeers had to be brought in to restore order. Although advised to compromise, he persisted until he succeeded in putting a stop to the desecration of the minster. A new dean, installed in 1677, curtailed his responsibilities, so Lake and his college friend Samuel Drake edited the cavalier poetry of their Cambridge supervisor, John Cleveland, in 'Clievelandi vindiciae' (1677). 
Lake was archdeacon of Cleveland in 1680-82, and in 1682 the earl of Derby offered him the bishopric of Sodor and Man. After one summer on the isle he was willing to exchange it for turbulent Bristol, surrendering his residency at York in 1684. The new bishop of Bristol in 1684-5 was prepared to see his chancellor prosecute dissent rigorously, while he himself struggled with a vociferous dean who opposed him in his projects for improving the cathedral, especially his attempt to establish weekly communion. He complained piteously about his plight to his friend Archbishop Sancroft, who soon translated him to the more desirable see of Chichester in 1685. Before the move was complete, however, the accession of James II and subsequent rebellion of Monmouth required his return to Bristol where, at Keynsham Bridge, he narrowly escaped the rebels. In the interim between sees he carried out an arduous visitation of the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry for Sancroft, and in 1686 he conducted another commission for him at Salisbury. 
As bishop of Chichester from 1685 to 1689, Lake carried out a primary visitation which produced an account of the lamentable state of the church in Sussex. Although suffering from gout, he was energetic in his efforts to raise standards and at the cathedral he established weekly communion. In 1687, in an attempt to placate dissenters and to preserve a common protestant front against royal policies, he moved the sermon from the choir to the nave where it could be better heard. Always obedient to Sancroft, he hurried to Lambeth in May 1688 to sign the petition to be excused from reading the king's declaration of indulgence, thus becoming one of the seven bishops committed to the Tower. After being acquitted and hailed as a national hero, he made another 'charitive' visit throughout his rugged diocese and was received by the clergy and gentlemen of Sussex with great respect and good humour. Even the duke of Somerset gave him a warm reception at Petworth. But the euphoria was short-lived, because Lake was one of those bishops who were so committed to the doctrine of the divine right of kings and to the sacred nature of the oath to James II that they could not take the new oaths of allegiance to William and Mary in 1689 ['see also 'Nonjuring bishops]. He believed that the day of judgement was as certain as the day of his deprivation, and in a correspondence with Thomas Comber, precentor of York, he worked out many 'Gordian knots' in his own arguments. This correspondence, however, was cut short and Lake did not live to suffer actual deprivation. Suddenly falling ill from a summer fever and knowing his end was near, he dictated a profession of faith to his chaplain, Robert Jenkin. In this he solemnly asserted his fidelity to the Church of England and his adherence to its distinctive doctrine of non-resistance and passive obedience. The bishop signed this in the presence of five friends, who received communion with him, and three days later, on 30 August, he died, in the parish of St Olave Jewry, London. He was buried on 3 September in the church of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. The paper was published as 'The declaration of the Right Reverend Father in God John late bishop of Chichester upon his death-bed'. It was, in part, a final answer to Comber, but it was widely misunderstood to be a polemic against the revolution settlement and this caused many disputatious pamphlets to be published on the subject. One defence of the profession was published anonymously by Jenkin, who gives the earliest account of the bishop's life. 'He was not easily moved but sedate and undaunted', Jenkin said, 'and he thanked God he never much knew what fear was, when he was satisfied in the Goodness of his cause' (Jenkin, 60).

Lake, Sir Thomas (bap. 1561, d. 1630), administrator and politician, was the son of Emery (or Almeric) Lake (1519-1594), a minor customs official in Southampton. His date of birth is not known, but he was baptized on 11 October 1561 at St Michael's Church, Southampton, and according to one report was educated at the town's grammar school. It was presumably there that he acquired the good command of Latin which helped advance his career. 
By 1584 Lake was in the service of Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary of state, and earned the nickname of Swiftsure for his speedy dispatch of business. A sign of Lake's increasing importance was his appointment as one of the clerks of the signet in 1589. It may have been to provide against the possibility of Walsingham's death that Lake acquired the reversion of the town clerkship of Southampton in 1584, but when the secretary did die, in 1590, Lake salvaged his career by adhering to the powerful Cecil family, through whose influence he was elected to the parliaments of 1593 and 1601. On 29 June 1591 he married Mary (1575-1642), the daughter of William Rider, alderman and later mayor of London. His first child, Thomas, was probably born in 1595. His second son, Arthur, was baptized in 1598, at which time Lake was living near Charing Cross. 
Following Queen Elizabeth's death in March 1603 the council sent Lake to Scotland to inform King James of the state of affairs in his new kingdom. Lake made a good impression, not only on the king but also upon his Scottish followers, and in May 1603 was knighted. There are indications that Robert Cecil, James's principal English minister, resented Lake's growing influence, but he could not counter the influence of the Scots at court, who continued to support their protege. Lake also had the advantage of accompanying James on his frequent hunting expeditions, during which, if Sir Anthony Weldon is to be believed, he 'would tell tales, and let the king know the passages of court, and great men... and discovered their bawdry, which did infinitely please the king's humour' (Weldon, 1.368). In June 1604 the Spanish count of Villa Mediana, on a special embassy to England, reported that James held Lake in high esteem 'as he trusts him the most and gives him many duties to perform. He is mentioned for the office of First Secretary which Cecil now holds' (Loomie, 54). 
Lake sat for Launceston in the first parliament of James I's reign, and took advantage of his membership to pilot through a bill securing his title to the Canons estate at Stanmore in Middlesex, which he had purchased two years earlier. 
Continuing tensions between the ambitious Lake and Robert Cecil, now earl of Salisbury, came to the surface in 1609 when the minister lessened his workload by dividing his secretarial duties between Lake and Sir Thomas Edmondes. Lake was to be responsible for home affairs, which implied continuous attendance upon the king, but when James left town for Royston in November, Salisbury ordered Edmondes to accompany him. Lake, regarding this as a calculated slight, protested so forcefully that Salisbury reversed his decision. James's attitude was indicated by his appointment of Lake as his Latin secretary in December 1609. 
In April 1612 Salisbury, by now a dying man, set out for Bath to take the waters. He left the signet in Lake's hands 'and gave him many good words to the King at the delivery of it' ('Letters of John Chamberlain', 1.346). Following Salisbury's death in May, James ordered that all official communications should be sent to Lake, but he declined to give him the title of secretary, retaining it for future bestowal. Lake's financial position had been improved by the death of Sir William Rider, his father-in-law, in 1611, and he now offered $15,000 for the secretaryship. However, James still temporized. One well-informed observer suggested that there were two major impediments to Lake's appointment. The first arose from doubts about 'his soundness in religion'; the second from the arrogance and ill temper of his wife, who was frequently compared to Xantippe, the termagant spouse of Socrates ('Letters of John Chamberlain', 1.367). There is little doubt that Lake was a covert Catholic, in contrast to his younger brother, Arthur Lake, who became bishop of Bath and Wells in 1616. Lake's London house was next door to that of the Venetian ambassador, who allowed him to make a gateway through the party wall so that he and his family could attend Catholic services in the embassy chapel. The ambassador also reported that at various times Lake and his wife sent him 'devotional things, to take care of them, when they were afraid that the house might be searched' ('CSP Venice', '1615-17', 597-9). 
Lake's Catholic leanings won him the patronage of the lord treasurer, the earl of Suffolk, who by March 1614 had persuaded James to appoint him as secretary. However, the committed protestants on the council warned the king that this would be unacceptable to members of the forthcoming parliament and would frustrate James's hopes of a harmonious session. James therefore appointed Sir Ralph Winwood, whose protestantism was unequivocal. Lake had to be content with being made a privy councillor. He sat in the 1614 parliament as a knight of the shire for Middlesex and made an early attempt to resolve the dispute over the prerogative taxes known as impositions by proposing that a conference should be held in James's presence. Some weeks later he warned the Commons against drawing up a petition against the new order of baronets on the grounds that this 'would not only call the prerogative but the judgment and discretion of the King in question' (Jansson, 157, 326). As the session drew to its unhappy close he urged members to choose the constructive course of voting supply, rather than being 'dissolved without doing any other good' (ibid., 423), but the house was in no mood for compromise, and the Addled Parliament ended in failure. 
Many Catholic sympathizers distrusted parliament as an institution that gave voice to extreme anti-popish sentiments, but Lake seems to have been an exception. When the privy council discussed how to improve the royal finances in September 1615 he argued that a satisfactory relationship between the king and parliament was essential for the monarchy's reputation. He therefore advocated summoning another parliament, but only after the king had agreed to curb his extravagance. 
Lake's implied criticism of James's open-handedness might well have harmed his chances of promotion, but the situation was changing in his favour as the king, disillusioned with parliament, turned towards Spain. Lake's pro-Spanish leanings -- no doubt strengthened by the Spanish ambassador's award to him of an annual pension of $500 in 1614 -- now made him acceptable to James, and in January 1616 he was at last appointed secretary of state. Foreign relations remained the province of Winwood, as senior secretary, but Lake strengthened his position by arranging a marriage between his daughter, Anne ['see 'Cecil, Anne], and Lord Ros, grandson of the earl of Exeter, who was himself the son of Elizabeth I's chief minister, William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Ros was a Catholic, and Lake persuaded James to appoint him ambassador-extraordinary to Spain in order to promote good relations between the two courts. 
Further evidence of Lake's standing with the king came in 1617 when he was chosen to accompany James on his state visit to Scotland. However, when Winwood died, in October 1617, the king rejected Lake's request to be given the post of principal secretary. He offered him a barony instead, but when it was pointed out that this would create resentment among the other barons, since Lake, by virtue of his office, would take precedence over them, James changed his mind. Lake was given a choice between the peerage and the secretaryship and chose the latter. 
Despite the fact that he was still only junior secretary, Lake seemed well placed for future advancement. But at this very moment he was overtaken by a crisis brought on by his own family. Lake's daughter, Anne, and her husband, Lord Ros, were an ill-assorted couple, and they were soon living apart. Lady Ros insisted that her husband should provide for her upkeep by transferring to her a property in Essex. Failing that, she would make public details of his sexual inadequacy. Lake added to the pressure by threatening that unless Ros complied no exchequer funding would be available for his mission to Spain. Ros was prepared to give way, but his grandfather, the earl of Exeter, had some rights in the property, which he refused to relinquish. This enraged Lady Ros, who had a domineering temperament. She and her mother joined forces to attack the countess of Exeter, the earl's young wife, whom they blamed for his intransigence. They accused her of attempting to poison Lady Ros, and produced a paper, said to be in the countess's hand, in which she acknowledged her guilt. The countess denounced this as a forgery, and the case was brought before the court of Star Chamber. 
The entire Lake family, as Chamberlain observed, had now 'fallen into a labyrinth, whence they know not how to get out' ('Letters of John Chamberlain', 2.145). Lake was not directly implicated, but mounting evidence that his wife and daughter were guilty of forgery as well as slander did little for his reputation. His position was further weakened by accusations of bribery made against his patron, the lord treasurer. Lady Suffolk, who was said to have received the bribes paid to her husband, had taken temporary refuge in the country, but could not for long resist the delights of London. When James heard she was back in town he threatened to have her forcibly removed. Lake reported this to Suffolk, but James accused him of betrayal and virtually suspended him from office. Lake sought assistance from James's new favourite, George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham, offering $15,000 by way of inducement. Buckingham spurned the offer, but Lake was more successful in his appeal to the favourite's mother, who persuaded him to intercede with James on Lake's behalf. 
By August 1618 Lake appeared to be once more securely established in office, but in February of the following year the Star Chamber gave its judgment in the Exeter case. The countess's charges against Lake's wife and daughter were upheld, and the two women were fined $15,000 and committed to the Tower of London. Lake himself was condemned on the grounds that he had used his official position to secure the imprisonment of two servants of the Ros and Exeter families who had declined to give false evidence against their masters and mistresses. Lake was stripped of the secretaryship, fined $5000, and sent to join his family in the Tower. 
Lake remained incarcerated until July 1619, when he was released on health grounds. He continued to protest his innocence of the charges made against him, but he had no wish to return to prison and in January 1620 he reluctantly agreed 'to make his personal submission and acknowledgement in the Star Chamber... and to confess the judgment there given upon him to be most just for his gross credulity, indulgence and ignorance' ('Letters of John Chamberlain', 2.284). 
Lake did not give up hope of recovering his position, particularly after the disgrace of Secretary Naunton in January 1621. Yet his exclusion from power turned out to be permanent, and he blamed this upon Buckingham. Following his election to parliament in 1626 Lake took an active part in the impeachment proceedings against the favourite, but the failure to topple Buckingham merely confirmed that Lake's political career was over. He lived a retired life at Canons until his death on 17 September 1630; he was buried on 19 October in the parish church of Little Stanmore. 
King James is said to have described Lake as 'a minister of state fit to serve the greatest prince in Europe' (Fuller, 14), and there is no doubt that he was a speedy, efficient, and trustworthy administrator. However, Lake's Catholic tendencies and pro-Spanish leanings ceased to be advantages after the collapse of the Spanish marriage negotiations in 1623, and even if James had restored him to the secretaryship it is unlikely that he would have continued in office under Charles I. Lake did not welcome his enforced retirement, but, as Fuller observed, he had the consolation of 'having achieved a fair fortune, which he transmitted to posterity' (Fuller, 14).

Lake, William Charles (1817-1897), dean of Durham, was born in London on 9 January 1817, the eldest son of Captain Charles Lake, an officer in the Scots Fusilier Guards who was wounded at Waterloo and thereafter lived in retirement, and his wife, Anna Louisa, youngest daughter of Henry Halsey of Henley Park, Surrey. Some of his childhood was spent in France and the Channel Islands before the family settled in Rugby, where he attended Rugby School as a day boy under Dr Wooll and Dr Arnold. He became head of the school and formed close friendships with A. P. Stanley and C. J. Vaughan. In 1834 he won a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, and in 1838 gained first-class honours in the classical school. He was a friend of A. C. Tait, with whom he travelled to the continent in vacations, a member of the celebrated debating society, the Decade, and president of the Oxford Union Society in 1838. As an undergraduate he came under the influence of Newman, and his election to a Balliol fellowship in 1838 with membership of the common room brought him into frequent contact with W. G. Ward. Ordained in 1842, and in the same year appointed a tutor of Balliol (where his nicknames Serpent, Puddle, and Piddle suggested a degree of unpopularity with the undergraduates), he was one of the liberals who opposed the measures taken against the Tractarian leaders by the university's hebdomadal board. Illness caused his absence from Oxford between 1845 and 1847. 
On his return to Oxford, Lake played a prominent part in university reform. He gave evidence to the royal commission (1850), was senior proctor in 1852, and took a leading part in the Oxford Tutors' Association, which promoted the moderate settlement, protecting collegiate and clerical interests, carried through by W. E. Gladstone in 1854. His most significant achievement was in organizing the introduction of modern history into the undergraduate curriculum, serving as examiner in the first examinations in law and modern history in 1853 and 1854. His association with modern studies and knowledge of European languages led to his appointment in 1855 as an examiner of candidates for army commissions and, in 1856, as a member of the War Office commission set up following the reverses in the Crimean War to investigate the training of army officers. After visiting military academies on the continent, Lake and his colleagues recommended the establishment of a staff college in Britain. He was also an academic representative, with H. M. Butler, on the royal commission on military education (1868-70). In June 1858 he was appointed a member of the royal commission chaired by the duke of Newcastle to investigate elementary education in England. Its report (1861) foreshadowed the 'Education Act' of 1870. 
In October 1858, to the surprise of his friends, Lake turned his back on academic life and accepted the Balliol College living of Huntspill in Somerset, becoming a canon of Wells in 1860. He had been an unsuccessful candidate for the vacant chair of ecclesiastical history at Oxford in 1856, and he felt a growing estrangement from the direction of Oxford liberalism, believing that the theology of Jowett and Stanley was encouraging doubt and unbelief. For this reason he disliked 'Essays and Reviews', though he publicly defended Frederick Temple, one of the contributors, in 1869. He remained a Liberal in politics and one of the high-church adherents of Gladstone, who on 9 August 1869 nominated him to the deanery of Durham, which carried with it the wardenship of Durham University. Gladstone urged him to infuse life into the moribund university, whose student numbers had fallen below fifty. Lake rejected the idea of making Durham a miniature Oxford, but instead concentrated on its development as a leading school of theology, while the needs of higher scientific and technical education in the north-east were served by the foundation, in 1871, of the Durham College of Science at Newcastle. During his wardenship the Durham College of Medicine was also incorporated into the university. 
As dean of the cathedral Lake had to overcome the conservatism of the canons, and relations were not always harmonious. He lacked a winning manner -- an archdeacon described him as 'imperious', 'impetuous', and 'impertinent' (Barrett, 48) -- and he was obliged to rely on a legal opinion to affirm his authority over cathedral services, which shocked him on his arrival by their lack of decorum. He succeeded in imposing order and reverence, restored the eucharist to a high place, and, in the face of determined opposition from C. T. Baring, the bishop of Durham, oversaw the restoration of the cathedral interior, carried out by Gilbert Scott (1876). 
On 2 June 1881 Lake married Katherine, daughter of John Neilson Gladstone, brother of the prime minister. In collaboration with R. W. Church and H. P. Liddon he used his influence with his old college friend Archbishop Tait to dissuade him from taking extreme measures against ritualist clergymen under the 'Public Worship Regulation Act', and he supported those clergy who were imprisoned under the act. He was a member of the ecclesiastical courts commission (1881-3). A vice-president of the English Church Union and a governor of Pusey House, Oxford, he opposed attempts to encourage secessions from the Roman Catholic churches on the continent, protesting in 1888 against the Anglican mission to convert Italy. Latterly he broke with Gladstonian Liberalism as he opposed Irish home rule. He resigned the deanery on 2 November 1894, owing to failing health. Lake went to live at Kanescombe in Torquay, where he died on 8 December 1897. He was survived by his wife.

Lackenheath, John (d. 1381), Benedictine monk, derived his name from Lakenheath, a few miles north-west of Bury St Edmunds. Having been appointed keeper of the barony there, Lackenheath found that the archives of the abbey were still in a state of disorder as a result of the sack of the abbey by the townsfolk of Bury in 1327. He reorganized those archives and, 'c'.1380, compiled an elaborate register (now BL, Harley MS 743) which provided a finding aid for the records. He is also recorded in court records as making decisions on seigneurial dues payable to the abbey. His activities on behalf of his house made him very unpopular, and during the rising of 1381 the Suffolk rebels, at the instigation of the Bury townsfolk, demanded that Lackenheath be surrendered to them. In order to prevent the destruction of the monastery, Lackenheath gave himself up to the rebels and on 15 July was beheaded in the market place, where his head was set upon the pillory.

Lalor, James Fintan (1807-1849), Irish nationalist, was born on 10 March 1807 at Tenakill, Queen's county, the eldest of eleven children of Patrick Lalor (1781-1856) of Tenakill and his wife, Anne Dillon (died 1835). Patrick was a gentleman farmer and middleman who took a prominent part in the anti-tithe movement of the 1830s and was MP for his county, 1832-5. Peter Lalor was a younger son. James Fintan was set apart by physical deformity and ill health. He was educated at home until at the age of seventeen he spent a year (1825-6) in Carlow College. His lack of formal education was compensated for by the fierce energy and independence of his mind. In due course he rejected the mainstream O'Connellite movement in which his father and brothers were prominent. His search for an alternative led him into friendly correspondence with Sir Robert Peel in 1843. But long before this he had identified radical change in the landholding system as the great answer to Irish problems. 
In January 1847 Lalor secured a place among the contributors to 'The Nation', and wrote a series of letters that were remarkable for their passionate rhetoric. He advocated a scheme for a strike against rent, which, in spite of the strong disapproval of Charles Gavan Duffy, he induced John Mitchel to adopt. On 18 September 1847 he summoned a meeting of tenant farmers at Holycross, co. Tipperary, to found a tenant association on the footing of a 'live and thrive' rent, but his want of practical ability and his fierce self-opinionatedness caused the failure of the meeting. His resolutions were carried, but the association was abortive. 
The events of 1848 drew Lalor, as so many others, towards political revolution. On 26 May of that year John Mitchel was transported and the 'United Irishman' suppressed. Thereupon John Martin arranged for the publication of the 'Irish Felon', successor to the 'United Irishman'. The first number was dated 24 June 1848, and Lalor was the chief contributor. After Martin's arrest in July, Lalor practically edited the newspaper. It came to an end on 22 July with its fifth number. Lalor was arrested on 28 July. He was imprisoned under the 'Habeas Corpus Suspension Act', but his health having become impaired, he was released in November 1848. 
Lalor was one of the leaders in a revolutionary conspiracy, largely involving artisans in the towns of Leinster and Munster, which flourished for much of 1849 before petering out after a failed attempt at rebellion in September. He was at work on plans for a new newspaper when he fell ill and died, unmarried, at his lodgings in Great Britain Street, Dublin, on 27 December 1849. A large procession followed his funeral to Glasnevin cemetery three days later. Half a century on his ideas, seldom fully comprehended, became grist to the mill of another generation of Irish nationalists. For James Connolly he provided the rare and welcome precedent of a nationalist with an appreciation of socio-economic structure. To Patrick Pearse he was, along with Tone, Davis, and Mitchel, one of the evangelists of Irish nationalism.

Lalor, John (1814-1856), journalist and author, was born on 23 April 1814 in Dublin, son of John Lalor, a merchant. He was educated at a Roman Catholic school at Carlow and at Clongowes College. On 6 June 1831 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1837. After collecting evidence as an assistant poor-law commissioner, he left Ireland in 1836 and began working with the daily press in London, first as a parliamentary reporter and afterwards, for five or six years, as one of the principal editors of the 'Morning Chronicle', dealing with social and domestic questions. In 1834 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, and went on to the King's Inns in 1838. In 1839 he obtained the prize of 100 guineas awarded by the Central Society of Education for his essay 'The expediency and means of elevating the profession of the educator in society'. Lalor was brought up as a Roman Catholic, but about 1844 he joined the Unitarian church and became editor of the Unitarian weekly paper 'The Inquirer'. He himself contributed influential articles on the 'Factory Bill, Ireland', and on education. Lalor died, after years of ill health, at Holly Hill, Hampstead, London, on 27 January 1856. He was much revered as an educator through his journalism, and his work on Ireland and on the reform of factory legislation was important.

Lalor, Peter Fintan (1827-1889), politician in Australia, was born on 5 February 1827 at Tenakill, Queen's county, Ireland, the last of the eleven children of Patrick Lalor (1781-1856), a tenant farmer and MP, and his wife, Anne Dillon (died 1835). One of his brothers was James Fintan Lalor. He was baptized on 11 February 1827, and was educated at Raheen primary school. From 1845 onwards the family fortunes worsened with the onset of the great famine. After the discovery of gold in Australia, Lalor sailed for Melbourne in 1852 with his brother Richard (1823-1892), Richard's wife, Margaret, and their sister Margaret and cousin Maria Lalor. From October 1852 to December 1853, together with another Irishman, they operated as Phelan, Lalor & Co., 'wine, spirit, and provision merchants', at the corner of Elizabeth and La Trobe streets in Melbourne. In late December 1853, Lalor travelled to the goldfields at Ballarat, taking with him liquor supplies at wholesale rates costing $804, as well as general store items costing $202. Under cover of a miner's licence, he operated a 'sly grog' store. The rest of the family, however, returned to Tenakill. In December 1854 a rebellion by goldminers broke out at Ballarat. By law, diggers had to pay a monthly licence to the government, but at a meeting on 29 November 1854 it was decided not to pay the licence, and many licences were burnt. Known to the insurgents, most of them Irish, through his sly grog dealings, Lalor was elected commander-in-chief of the insurgents at the Eureka stockade, where a stand was taken for 'liberty', and, in particular, equality before the law. The stockaders objected to the acquittal of a former convict, James Bentley, the owner of the biggest hotel on the Ballarat diggings, for the murder of a miner, James Scobie, and sought to substitute a gold tax for the licence system. For Lalor, it was a stand based chiefly on conscience. 
Parties of the 12th and 40th regiments, accompanied by police, attacked the miners on 3 December at the Eureka stockade, when twenty-four of the rebels were killed and twelve wounded. 125 were taken prisoner. Lalor was wounded by gunfire, resulting in the amputation of his left arm. Assisted by Father Patrick Smyth, Lalor escaped to Geelong, to his future wife, the schoolteacher Alicia Dunne (died 1887). He recovered, and they married on 10 July 1855. He was described as being 5 feet 11 inches tall, with blue-grey eyes, and 'rather good looking'. A reward of $200 offered for his capture did not result in his arrest. 
Representation was later given to the goldfields. On 10 November 1855 Lalor was elected without opposition as member for Ballarat, but he was uneasy on either side of the house. He was, however, appointed inspector of railways. Because he refused to vote for manhood suffrage, at the next election, in 1856, he was returned for the more conservative seat of South Grant, which he represented until 1871 and again from 1875 to 1888. In August 1875 he was appointed commissioner for customs in Graham Berry's first radical administration. As chairman of the Clunes water commission, through his efforts a bill was carried in 1871 for the Clunes waterworks, which cost $70,000. In 1877 Lalor was appointed commissioner for trade and customs, and in 1878 he became postmaster-general as well. In 1880 he was elected speaker of the house, a post which he filled with distinction until September 1887, when he retired in consequence of ill health. He was thereupon awarded a grant of $4000. He died at his home, Goodwood Street, Richmond, Melbourne, on 9 February 1889, having outlived his daughter Anne Lempriere and his wife. He was buried in Melbourne general cemetery. He was survived by his son Joseph P. Lalor, a medical doctor.

Lamb, Andrew (1565?-1634), bishop of Galloway, was probably related to Andrew Lamb of Leith, a lay member of the general assembly of 1560. He became minister of Burntisland, Fife, in 1593, and was translated to Arbroath in 1596 and to South Leith, near Edinburgh, in 1600. In that year he was appointed one of the members of the standing commission of the church to advise the king between general assemblies, and in 1601 he became a royal chaplain, in which capacity he accompanied the earl of Mar on an embassy to England to ensure James VI's succession to the English throne. Lamb was one of the ministers chosen by James to accompany him on his journey south in 1603, and he received a pension from the abbey of Arbroath for services to the king and to the church. 
Lamb was made titular bishop of Brechin in 1607, and he presented a brass chandelier of Flemish workmanship to Brechin Cathedral in 1615. He was a member of the general assembly of 1610 which restored the full powers of the episcopate, and was one of the three Scottish bishops consecrated at London on 21 October 1610. He was one of four bishops who signed a letter of remonstrance to the king regarding the images ordered for the decoration of the Chapel Royal at Holyrood on the occasion of James VI's visit in 1617. Several biographers of Samuel Rutherford have suggested that Lamb gave tacit consent to his ordination by the laying on of presbyterial hands. While there is no clear evidence of this, Lamb was believed to be more tolerant than some of his contemporaries of those who did not conform to the ecclesiastical practices prescribed in the five articles of Perth. At the general assembly of the kirk in August 1618 he conceded that he knew of nothing in 'Scripture, Reasone, nor Antiquitie that inforceth kneeling', but, since he considered the practice as a thing indifferent, advocated its acceptance for the sake of conformity to the king's wishes (MacDonald, 163). 
In 1619 Lamb was translated to Galloway, but in his later years became blind and resided chiefly in Leith, where he owned property. He died in 1634, leaving a son, James, and two daughters, both of whom married landowners in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright. His wife's name is unknown.

Lamb, Benjamin (fl. 1715), composer, was organist of Eton College and verger of St George's Chapel, Windsor, about 1715. He wrote a few songs, and some church music. Four of his anthems and an evening service in E minor are among the Tudway collection in the Harleian MSS in the British Library.

Lamb, Lady Caroline (1785-1828), novelist, was born in London on 13 November 1785, fourth child and only daughter of Frederick Ponsonby, third earl of Bessborough (1758-1844), and his wife, Henrietta Frances Ponsonby (1761-1821), daughter of the first earl of Spencer and younger sister of the duchess of Devonshire. Her chaotic upbringing was cosmopolitan and cultured. As a young child, she accompanied her parents on a protracted tour of Italy. From the age of nine, owing to the ill health of her mother, she alternately ran wild with her cousins at Devonshire House or was restrained by sojourns with her austere grandmother Lady Spencer. She later regretted her lack of formal education (she seems briefly to have attended Miss Rowden's school, Hans Place, Kensington), for the family had been advised by Dr Warren, a specialist in nervous diseases, that study would exacerbate the violent mood swings which occasionally threatened her sanity. She grew up into a combination of bluestocking autodidact and tomboy: 'For myself, I preferred washing a dog, or polishing a piece of Derbyshire spar, or breaking in a horse, to any accomplishment in the world' ('Lady Morgan's Memoirs', 2.212). With her slight androgynous figure and cropped fair curly hair, she enjoyed dressing as a page-boy, as depicted in Phillips' famous 1814 portrait. A high-spirited eccentric who feared 'nobody except the devil', she read Mary Wollstonecraft's 'Vindication of the Rights of Woman' in 1809 and 'became a convert' (ibid., 2.211). Lady Caroline was a brilliant conversationalist: 'A creature of caprice and impulse, and whim, her manner, her talk, and her character shifted their colours as rapidly as those of a chameleon' (Lytton, 1.119). 
Caroline married the Hon. William Lamb (1779-1848) on 3 June 1805, and afterwards resided either in Melbourne House, Whitehall, or Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire. Their tempestuous marriage scandalized the nineteenth century, temporarily paralysing Lamb's political career. It was to be depicted in Thomas Lister's 'Granby', Benjamin Disraeli's 'Vivian Grey' and 'Venetia', Mrs Humphry Ward's 'The Marriage of William Ash', Bulwer Lytton's 'De Lindsey', and Lady Lytton's 'Cheveley, or, The Man of Honour'. Lady Caroline suffered the deaths of premature babies in 1806 and 1809; her only surviving child was a mentally handicapped son, Augustus, born on 29 August 1807. The marriage survived these tragedies and Caroline's subsequent open infidelities, the most notorious being a brief theatrical affair with Byron in 1812. She famously recorded her first impressions of the poet as, 'Mad, bad and dangerous to know' and 'That beautiful pale face is my fate'. So well did she forge Byron's handwriting that she fraudulently obtained from John Murray a miniature of the poet destined for her rival, Lady Oxford. In revenge for her dismissal by Byron she portrayed him as the satanic villain of an anonymous Gothic romance, 'Glenarvon' (1816), written by night in male attire, and kept secret from her husband until the day of publication ('Lady Morgan's Memoirs', 2.202). As Byron sardonically commented, 'the time was well chosen' ('Byron's Letters and Journals', 5.85) to capitalize on the scandal surrounding his failed marriage. The 'roman a clef' also lampooned the Holland House set, and thus effected Lady Caroline's own ostracization from whig high society. William Lamb inaugurated but abandoned a legal separation; nor was he capable of halting publication of the book which publicized both his cuckoldry and the humiliating fact that his mother had also fallen under Byron's spell, becoming his 'greatest 'friend', of the feminine gender' (ibid., 6.23). Four British editions came out by 1817, the second of which was revised and included a justificatory preface. The novel was published in America and translated into French. It is still of interest as the first critique of Byronism and the Byronic hero by a woman writer. Byron commented: 'If the authoress had written the 'truth',... the romance would not only have been more 'romantic', but more entertaining. As for the likeness, the picture can't be good -- I did not sit long enough' (ibid., 5.131). In 'Don Juan' he too satirized the Regency aristocracy, including Caroline. Lady Caroline responded to Byron's 'Don Juan' with two anonymous 'ottava rima' parodies: 'A New Canto' (1819) and 'Gordon: a Tale' (1821), and caused a sensation when she attended a masquerade dressed as Don Juan, escorted by a throng of devils. 
Two more anonymous novels followed: 'Graham Hamilton' (1822) and 'Ada Reis' (1823). The latter, about an Englishwoman's love for a corsair, was printed by John Murray, formerly Byron's publisher. William Lamb had read the manuscript and advised on revisions. Lady Caroline also wrote verse for the annuals, some of which was set to music and posthumously published by Isaac Nathan in 'Fugitive pieces and reminiscences of Lord Byron with some original poetry, letters and recollections of Lady Caroline Lamb' (1829). Increasingly ostracized by the aristocracy, Lady Caroline enjoyed the company of literary friends such as Lady Morgan. The Lambs also helped William Godwin and William Blake financially, and adopted a child, Susan Churchill. In 1824 they were riding near Brocket Hall and saw Byron's funeral cortege passing by on its way to Nottinghamshire. In 1825 William's family persuaded him to instigate a legal separation. Lady Caroline spent lonely drunken last years at Brocket Hall, likened to Bedlam by Emily Lamb, who unkindly referred to her afflicted nephew as 'Frankenstein'. Her husband returned from his official duties in Ireland to be with her when she was dying, aged forty-two, of oedema. She died on 26 January 1828 in Melbourne House, and was buried in Hatfield church on 7 February. 
Although Lady Caroline strove to be taken seriously as a writer, popular biographies and films continue to dwell on apocryphal stories of her scandalous escapades, such as the dinner party at which she had herself served up naked in a soup tureen. However, even her famous passion for Byron was literary in origin: she had first fallen in love with his hero, Childe Harold. In Robert Bolt's film, 'Lady Caroline Lamb' (1972), she was played with some style by Sarah Miles.

Lamb, Charles (1775-1834), essayist, was born at 2 Crown Office Row in the Temple, London, on 10 February 1775, the son of John Lamb ('c'.1725-1799), a servant, and Elizabeth, 'nee' Field (died 1796). 
John Lamb was the son of a cobbler, and grew up near Stamford in Lincolnshire before entering domestic service, first in Lincoln and Bath, and then in London, where he had arrived by 1746. He spent the final decades of his working life acting as indispensable and versatile factotum to Samuel Salt, a bencher of the Inner Temple, a role in which Lamb commemorates him (as Lovel) in his essay 'The old benchers of the Inner Temple'. Salt, a widower, had been the whig MP for Liskeard since 1768, and served on the governing board for several hospitals, including Christ's Hospital. He lived in chambers above the Lambs, and owned a fine library, to which the young Charles was given access. John Lamb was the author of 'Poetical Pieces on Several Occasions' (published about 1777), so he may have passed on a literary disposition to his son; less happily, his family was said by some to have a history of the lunacy whose effects so strongly shadowed his son's life. 
Lamb's mother's mother, Mary Field, had been in domestic service with William Plumer of Blakesware; after his death she continued in service with Plumer's widow, and then stayed on as caretaker of Blakesware. The young Charles was a visitor there, as he records in his evocative essays 'Blakesmoor in H -- shire' and 'Dream-children'. 
Of John and Elizabeth Lamb's seven children only three survived infancy. The eldest, John, was born in 1763, and left home to continue his education at Christ's Hospital when he was five. Mary Anne Lamb, to be known as Mary, was born on 3 December 1764. She seems not to have been a favourite with her mother, and freely bestowed her affection on her brother Charles, born ten years later. 
The Lamb household, full of strong female influences, also included Sarah Lamb, known as Hetty, the sister of Charles's father. She and Elizabeth hated each other 'with a bitter hatred', according to Mary in 1803, though they were somewhat reconciled in their last years. Hetty, who doted on the young Charles, was one of the first eccentrics whom he cherished. Her theological reading, in particular, was ecumenical and unorthodox to the point of impropriety: she appears in the essay 'My relations' and in the story of Maria Howe in 'Mrs Leicester's School'. 
There are few details of the first years of Charles Lamb's life. From his earliest years he was a chronic stammerer. Some reports suggest he contracted smallpox when five years old. It seems that he took lessons with a Mrs Reynolds, 'nee' Chambers, on whom, with characteristic loyalty, he later conferred a pension. About 1781 he passed on to the academy of Mr William Bird off Fetter Lane, London. One early story nicely anticipates his habits of humorous and independent thought: the young Charles, puzzled by the uniformly eulogistic character of graveyard inscriptions, turned to his sister and asked: 'Mary, where are the naughty people buried?' (Courtney, 8). 
Lamb was formally entered for Christ's Hospital on 7 July 1782, and he was able to begin his education there when a vacancy occurred on 9 October of that year. It was through the patronage of Salt, a governor of the school, that Lamb in spite of the relatively straitened family finances was able to follow his brother John in profiting from the liberal education offered at one of the best schools of the day. The school was at this time located in Newgate Street, opposite the prison, and was presided over in disciplinarian style by the Revd James Boyer, headmaster from 1778 to 1799, though the severity of his influence was balanced by the delinquent laxity of another teacher, the Revd Matthew Field. However, the main influence on the young Charles came not from his teachers, but from his schoolmate Samuel Taylor Coleridge (three years Lamb's senior), with whom he maintained a close friendship. The school in these years was distinguished by remarkable students, including Leigh Hunt and Valentine LeGrice. There was an expectation that the abler boys would proceed from the school to university and then the church; but Lamb's stammer (like Hunt's) was thought to make him unfit for this, and so he left at only fifteen. Lamb has left us a wonderfully vivid record of the school in his two essays 'Recollections of Christ's Hospital' (1813) and 'Christ's Hospital five-and-thirty years ago' (1820). In the first of these he suggests that the school endowed pupils with a sense of right and wrong, and a strong religious consciousness; but he also emphasizes the possibilities of freedom within its regime, and a turn for romance which it fostered in him. The second essay is written as if in reply to Coleridge's grumbling at the idealism of the first, and it adds some darker notes, including much detailing of punishments, and mention of the constant shortage of food for those pupils who didn't, like Lamb, have a devoted aunt bringing them daily food packages. 
Lamb left Christ's Hospital in 1791, and his first employment thereafter was as a sort of secretary to the kindly businessman Joseph Paice, whose character is commemorated in the essay 'Modern gallantry'. As Samuel Salt had done, Paice offered Charles access to his fine library, and his taste for Elizabethan literature may have influenced the young Lamb. At some point after this Lamb had a temporary position at the South Sea House, but by February 1792 he was staying at Blakesware with old Mrs Field, who was dying of cancer. It was at this time that he met Ann Simmons, the Anna of his early love sonnets. It is hard to know how far this love was an affair of the imagination only, but at any rate it inspired some of Lamb's early poetry of 1792-5, and is probably also reflected in the love of Allan Clare and Rosamund Gray in the novel 'Rosamund Gray'. Not much is heard of Ann Simmons until 1799, when she married John Thomas Bartram and moved to London. According to Southey, she dined twice with Lamb in May 1799 and was then pronounced by him to be 'a stupid girl' (Courtney, 77). 
On 15 April 1792 Lamb joined the East India Company, where he served for thirty-three years as clerk in the accountant's department, never seeking promotion, probably to safeguard the time he could devote to looking after his sister in her ill health. De Quincey's 'Literary Reminiscences' includes a vivid account of his first meeting with Lamb ('positively the most hospitable man I have known in this world') at work. His job seems at times to have kept him consumingly busy, but at other times left him free to write long letters at work. 
Lamb resumed an intense friendship with Coleridge during the latter's time in London in December 1794. His enthusiasm for Unitarianism, especially that of Joseph Priestley, was no doubt influenced by his former schoolfriend, and he looked above all to Coleridge for support, as his correspondence records, during the tribulations of the following years. The earliest of these was the collapse of Lamb's own mental health: he spent six weeks in an asylum in Hoxton in 1795, when he wrote to Coleridge: 'I am got somewhat rational now, & 'don't bite any one'. But 'mad' I was -- & many a vagary my imagination played with 'me', enough to make a 'volume' if all 'told'' ('Letters of Charles Lamb', 1.4). The association of lunacy, imagination, and literary output should serve as a reminder of how much Lamb's literary origins borrow from the extremities of English Romanticism, even though he was to temper his later and best-known writings to a quieter style. Lamb never again lost his own sanity, but the fear that he might do must have added a terrible anxiety to his life. 
The decisively dreadful incident of madness, however, was not to be Charles's, but that of his sister Mary. In September 1796 Mary Lamb in a fit of mania killed their mother Elizabeth. The jury bringing in a verdict of lunacy, Mary was removed to Hoxton asylum; her sanity recovered, she was to be allowed to return home only on condition that a family member undertook her care. In doing so, Charles made the momentous decision to devote his life to his sister, a resolve he kept to steadily. Whatever his later religious convictions, his letters of this time suggest that he drew on a deep vein of religious feeling in finding strength to deal with the family tragedy. Procter's 'Memoir' suggests that he lived in a state of constant anxiety about his sister's health, which most years required her to spend time in an asylum. The history of Mary's madness was not disclosed to the public until Thomas Noon Talfourd's 'Final Memorials of Charles Lamb' (1848). Charles and Mary lived together until his death, but moved lodging eight times between 1799 and 1823, probably on occasions because Mary's history was known to neighbours. However, in her calmer periods, Mary acted as a stabilizing influence on her brother, and her good sense, kindness, and social competence were attested by many contemporaries. 
The late 1790s saw Lamb commencing a quietly promising literary career. At Coleridge's instigation, he contributed fifteen poems to 'Poems, second edition, by S. T. Coleridge, to which are now added poems by Charles Lamb, and Charles Lloyd', published in June 1797. Lamb and Lloyd appeared again together in May 1798 as co-authors of 'Blank Verse': Lamb's friendship with the Quaker Lloyd family fed into his essay 'A Quaker's meeting'. The brilliant but perverse Charles Lloyd also dedicated his novel 'Edmund Oliver' (1798) to Lamb, which prompted a brief falling-out with Coleridge, the thinly disguised prototype of the title figure. 'Blank Verse' included the poem which was to become Lamb's most enduringly popular, 'The Old Familiar Faces' -- a strikingly elegiac work from its young author. Edmund Blunden comments on Lamb's early poems that: 'These sonnets of lost or fancied love, these soliloquies on altered fortune, on family history, on friendship and on loneliness, on the mystery of things and the eternal foundations of man in the divine, form altogether quite an individual 'progress' of poetry. (Blunden, 19)' Lamb continued to compose poetry throughout his life, but he turned increasingly to prose, like his contemporaries Scott and Coleridge. His early versatility is suggested by the appearance in the summer of 1798 of his novel 'Rosamund Gray', one of whose admirers was Percy Shelley. 
In July 1797 Lamb had been able to accept Coleridge's invitation to visit him and his young family in Nether Stowey in Somerset -- a visit which required leave of absence from East India House, and arrangements to be made for the care of Lamb's increasingly senile father (Aunt Hetty had died in February 1797). There he met (among others) Thomas Poole, John Cruikshank, Gilbert Burnett, and above all William and Dorothy Wordsworth, who remained lifelong friends. The visit has also become famous for Coleridge's poem 'This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison', with its warm tribute to Lamb as 'my gentle-hearted Charles' -- whose gratitude was tempered by exasperation at 'gentle': it 'almost always means poor-spirited' ('Letters of Charles Lamb', 1.218), he wrote in one letter to Coleridge, and in another 'substitute drunken dog, ragged-head, seld-shaven, odd-ey'd, stuttering, or any other epithet which truly and properly belongs to the Gentleman in question' (ibid., 1.224). 
In 1799 Lamb's father died, and Mary moved in with Charles at 36 Chapel Street in Pentonville. In 1799-1800 he was on close and friendly terms with William Godwin, through whom he met Richard Porson, Horne Tooke, and James Perry, among others who remained friends. (Lamb's biographers tend to find themselves dealing with this period of his life in terms of his friendships; in both his life and writings friendship is of central importance.) Both Lamb and Godwin were working on plays at this time, Lamb on 'John Woodvil' and Godwin on 'Antonio', staged at Drury Lane Theatre. Lamb provided the prologue and epilogue for the disastrous 'Antonio', and had some stagestruck but doomed hopes for its success. Lamb kept belief in 'John Woodvil', which has some fine passages, and shows how deeply he had been influenced by Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, notably the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher and of Massinger. 
During the 1800s Lamb tried his hand at journalistic writing, theatre, and children's literature. Daniel Stuart employed him for the 'Morning Post' to write joky poems and prose, first for five or six weeks in early 1802, then for a longer period from September 1803 until probably April or May 1804. He later feelingly reminisced on the drudgery of producing drollery on demand, partly a relief from the routines of office work at the East India Company, but partly a supplementary routine of its own. When this work ended, he -- and soon Mary as well -- began writing for children, at the instigation of the Godwins, who published books for children (albeit not under Godwin's own controversial name). Their first effort was the children's verses of 'The King and Queen of Hearts' (1805), and the more enduring 'Tales from Shakespear', re-casting the plays as prose narratives suitable for children. The tales were published under Charles's name in January 1807, Charles having written half of the preface and adapted some of the tragedies, while Mary had completed the substantial rest of the collection. Lamb's 'Adventures of Ulysses' came out in 1808, as did the collaboration with Mary on 'Mrs Leicester's School' (though it is dated 1809), of which Charles wrote three of the ten stories. Brother and sister collaborated again on 'Poetry for Children', published in two volumes in 1809 by Mrs Godwin. The two unmarried siblings write engagingly for children, emphasizing the virtues of 'charity, tolerance, thoughtfulness' (Lucas, 1.296), as Lamb's biographer E. V. Lucas says. 
Charles was also actively engaged in drama during the decade, both theatrical criticism and writing for the theatre. In June 1806 his farce 'Mr. H' was accepted for playing at Drury Lane Theatre. It opened on 10 December, disastrously, with Lamb, according to Crabb Robinson, joining in the audience's hissing. In America, by an odd quirk of cultural history, it did rather well. Charles was not so far deterred that he failed to undertake a further farce, 'The Pawnbroker's Daughter', drawing on the lessons learned, but still weak: Lamb had a genius for comedy, but not for the theatre. He spent his summer holidays in 1807 working in the British Museum on the 'Specimens of English Dramatic Poets who Lived about the Time of Shakespeare', a project to which he had given desultory attention over many years, and which was published by Longmans in 1808. The work was at once recognized for its critical insight and originality, and Lamb himself remained proud of the book, which Edmund Blunden has called 'the most striking anthology perhaps ever made from English literature' (Blunden, 22). 
These were years in which Lamb became well known to many of the most interesting and influential figures in the London literary world. Among them was the other great essayist of the generation, William Hazlitt, who painted his portrait of Lamb as a Venetian senator in 1804, and with whom Lamb shared a critical enthusiasm for painting. Lamb was a collector of both prints (especially of the Renaissance masters) and books. Crabb Robinson brings out the spirit of Lamb's bibliophilia charmingly, describing 'the finest collection of shabby books I ever saw; such a number of first-rate works of genius, but filthy copies, which a delicate man would really hesitate touching' (Lucas, 2.121). Charles and Mary started giving weekly soirees in 1806, at first on Wednesday evenings and later Thursdays; accounts of these convivial and eclectic occasions are among the main biographical sources we have. Lamb's drinking was often a social help and sometimes a social problem; Mary was already writing to Dorothy Wordsworth in 1803: 'Charles is very well and very 'good' I mean very sober but he is very good in every sense of the word' ('Letters of Charles Lamb', 2.118). Drink seems to have been important to Lamb, partly because it helped him overcome his stammer and partly in more general terms as a way of releasing inhibitions; but at times he got disgracefully drunk, as can be read between the lines of the loyal reminiscences of his friends. These were after all Regency times, though Lamb tends not to be thought of as a Regency author; and Lamb's drinking did not at any rate prevent him from holding down his job and meeting his other onerous responsibilities. Probably it helped him. Lamb's own 'Confessions of a drunkard' was published in 1813; there has been some dispute about how far the piece is autobiographical -- Crabb Robinson for one thought it pretty accurate. He sometimes tried to give up alcohol, but not so frequently as tobacco, his other ruling vice as he tended to see it. 
In 1809 Charles and Mary moved from Mitre Court Buildings, where they had lived since 1801, to 4 Inner Temple Lane. Lamb's literary output slowed down after the publication of the 'Dramatic Specimens', but he contributed four essays to Leigh Hunt's 'The Reflector' (1810-11), an important foretaste of his major literary efforts to follow. That he was friends with Hunt during this period, visiting him in gaol and contributing to 'The Examiner' risky verses hostile to the prince regent, indicates how far his political allegiances were and remained on what would now be regarded as the liberal left. 
During the next decade Lamb became well known among the main figures on London's cultural scene. Not only was he as a writer rich in reminiscences, but he was the frequent occasion of reminiscences in the essays and correspondence of his contemporaries -- notably Hazlitt, De Quincey, Procter, Haydon, and Crabb Robinson. One of the most memorable of these accounts is Haydon's description of the 'immortal dinner' Lamb hosted in December 1817, with a gathering including Keats, Wordsworth, and a Mr Kingston, Wordsworth's superior in his office as distributor of stamps. The occasion was described by Haydon as a genial battle of Bohemia versus bureacracy, with Lamb featuring as by some way the unruliest of the poets. 
Life at the East India Company seems to have become easier for Lamb in the middle of the decade. In 1816 his salary went up, and his duties diminished (though these always fluctuated with the contingencies of trade). The Olliers published his 'Works' in two volumes in 1818, partly through the friendly influence of Leigh Hunt. Lamb's literary output had fallen away in the preceding years, so he may in 1818 have thought this edition likely to be his main literary monument. He complained in a letter of this year (to Mary Wordsworth) that he was plagued by visitors (as often, disguising a real unhappiness with a jocular tone), and the joint demands of his job and his companionableness made it difficult for him to find time for writing. 
In 1818 Lamb proposed marriage, evidently with Mary's blessing, to the actress Fanny Kelly. He had praised her in print, but was very little acquainted with her. She declined the offer, but they became firm friends. She died unmarried at ninety-two. 
In 1820 Lamb began writing essays under the pseudonym Elia for John Scott's 'London Magazine'. Elia was, to those who knew him, recognizably Lamb himself, and he drew freely on his memories and his own correspondence for the essays, but Elia was somewhat more unworldly, whimsical, and elegiac than his author; and the contrivance of the dramatic persona released an easy eloquence and emotional fluency seldom seen in Lamb's previous writings. Over the next few years Lamb wrote most of the essays for which he is best remembered, collected as 'Elia' (1823) and 'The Last Essays of Elia' (1833). 
Among Lamb's publications of 1823 is the remarkable 'Letter to Southey', written in response to an incidental remark of Southey's in the 'Quarterly Review' calling 'Elia' 'a book which wants only a sounder religious feeling, to be as delightful as it is original'. Lamb responded with unusual anger, in his self-defence impugning both Southey's judgement and his character. The nature of Lamb's religious beliefs puzzled some of his friends. Crabb Robinson reported that his 'impressions against religion are unaccountably strong, and yet he is by nature pious', concluding: 'It is the dogmatism of theology which has disgusted him, and which alone he opposes' (Lucas, 2.122). His conversation was at times daringly and provocatively anti-religious, at times more playfully unsolemn. 'I am determined', he said, 'that my children shall be brought up in their father's religion if they can find out what it is' ('Letters of Charles Lamb', 3.247). The 'Letter to Southey' espouses an ecumenically tolerant sense of the varieties of religious experience: 'the shapings of our heavens are the modifications of our constitution' (Lucas, 2.109), he wrote, in a fine phrase unlikely to please either party of contemporary zealots, the atheistical or the orthodox Anglican. A magnanimous exchange of letters soon reconciled Lamb and Southey; Lamb's part in the brief controversy also impressed Hazlitt enough to prompt him to seek a reconciliation of the falling-out he had had with Lamb. In 1824 Hazlitt included as many as eighteen of Lamb's poems and two excerpts from 'John Woodvil' in his 'Select British Poets', and in the following year wrote a fine appreciation of him in 'The Spirit of the Age'. 
The year 1821 was darkened by the death of Lamb's elder brother John, recalled as Cousin James Elia in 'My relations', and remembered also in the essay 'Dream-children' published in the following year. In 1823 Charles and Mary moved to Colebrooke Row in Islington, at this time a semi-rural setting. Their house stood next to the New River. In this year they adopted Emma Isola, the daughter of Charles Isola, who had served in the position of esquire bedell at Cambridge University. The Lambs first met Emma in Cambridge in the summer of 1820 when she was nine; after that she frequently visited them for holidays, and they adopted her when Charles Isola, her only surviving parent, died. 
In 1825, after thirty-three years' work, Lamb was able to retire from the East India Company on the grounds of his declining health. His salary at this time was $730 per annum, leaving him with a comfortable pension of $450. At first delighted by the new freedoms, Lamb came to miss the companionship at work, and the anchoring regularity it brought to his life, as he wrote in the essay 'The superannuated man'. 
Despite his new leisure, Lamb wrote less in the last decade of his life. There were some contributions to William Hone's 'Table Book', and Hone became one of many friends for whom Lamb effectively petitioned in times of financial hardship; and he also wrote for other periodicals including the 'New Monthly Magazine', 'Blackwood's', the 'Englishman's Magazine', and 'The Athenaeum'. Lamb also published two books: 'Album Verses and other Poems' (1830), a volume whose modest title did not prevent it being roughly reviewed; and, more important, 'The Last Essays of Elia' (1833), issued at the expensive price of 9's'. Lamb continued in these years to meet many authors, and to be sought out by younger writers. Carlyle visited in 1831, and found Lamb deplorably wanting in earnestness, amid other sins which he denounced with even more than his usual violence in his journal. On the other hand, Landor, also noted for his stringency, expressed great affection and esteem for both Charles and Mary. 
In 1827 the Lambs moved to Enfield, Middlesex. Lamb became a great walker in these latter years, often fuelled by beer -- though it was when he went to London that his drinking became less controlled. Mary's illnesses increased in severity and length as the 1820s continued, and this in turn took a toll on Charles's health, though the loving co-dependence of the two never wavered. However, as Lamb's biographer E. V. Lucas wrote in 1905 (in what is -- remarkably -- the most recent full-length biography), 'the history of his life between 1825-1834 makes sad reading' (Lucas, 2.146). Accounts often suggest he was in a bad way, through depression, or nervous exhaustion, or just drinking too much. It seems clear that Lamb in his later years had become what would now be called an alcoholic. Crabb Robinson in 1834 referred to 'the destruction he is rapidly bringing on himself' (ibid., 2.262). The great joy of these later years, to Charles and Mary, was Emma Isola, whom they had raised amid their own vicissitudes with devoted care. She became engaged to Edward Moxon (the young publisher of Lamb's last two works) in 1833, and married him that summer. The death of Coleridge in July 1834 was a grief which hastened Lamb's own end: 'His great and dear spirit haunts me... He was the proof and touchstone of all my cognitions.' (ibid., 2.266) Lamb died on 27 December 1834 following a fall at his home, Walden's Cottage, Church Street, Edmonton, Middlesex, where he and Mary had moved in 1833, and was buried in the churchyard at Edmonton. Mary, his elder by ten years, survived him by thirteen years, only intermittently in her right mind, and was buried alongside him in 1847. 
There is a pivotal moment in the responses to Lamb's writings in Dorothy Richardson's novel 'Pilgrimage' ('c'.1915), when Richardson's heroine Miriam reads 'The superannuated man' and says it 'looks charming on the surface and is beautifully written and is really perfectly horrible and disgusting' (Aaron, 85). It would be too simple to suggest that the nineteenth century found the charm and beauty in Lamb, leaving the twentieth to discover the horror and disgust; but there is an element of truth in the simple scheme. Victorian critics in particular made of Lamb a figure exemplary for fine feeling in his writing and self-sacrifice in his life. At one extreme, Thackeray is reported to have exclaimed, on reading one of Lamb's letters, 'Saint Charles!' (Lucas, 2.133) A generation later Swinburne waxed rhapsodic about Lamb's lovable merits as man and writer. Lamb's contemporaries preserved a sharper sense of the darker undercurrents in his work, the thwartings of impulse and experience of defeat which his comedy could at once contain and express. Lamb's friend P. G. Patmore, for instance, called him 'a gentle, amiable and tender-hearted misanthrope. He hated and despised men with his mind and judgment' (Courtney, 77-8); while William Hazlitt, who remains probably Lamb's best critic, noted that 'His jokes would be the sharpest things in the world, but that they are blunted by his good-nature'. Hazlitt continued: 'he wants malice, which is a pity' (Lucas, 2.139), which brings out the difference in temperament between the two great essayists. Lamb's combination of levity and seriousness has been, and remains, a challenge to the flexibility and sense of nuance in his readers, as it was to his hearers; John Stoddart, for instance, noted of Lamb in conversation that his 'bantering way with strangers was often employed by him as a mode of trying their powers of mind' (Courtney, 289), and he could also at times use his stutter as a weapon in comic timing. 
Lamb's writings were held in highest esteem, probably, in the fifty years from about 1870 to 1920. The qualities in him that could be seen as whimsy and sentimentality meant that his reputation fared less well during the professionalization of English literary studies, especially in its Leavisite phase. Later writers wishing to act as Lamb's advocates have looked to the more unsettling and darker notes of his writing, detecting in him another artist of Romantic anxiety (if not agony), and like Thomas McFarland finding in his charm 'a politics of survival' (McFarland, 26). On the other hand, Lamb has never been short of readers who respond to the forgiving friendliness of his manner, the novelistic vitality of his portraits, and the odd combination of the colloquial and the erudite in his prose style. 
Early biographers and critics of Lamb tended to isolate his domestic circumstances from other contexts, but recent work of a historicist turn has given a fuller account of his involvement in historically turbulent times. After Lamb's death the editor Daniel Stuart said: 'Of politics he knew nothing; they were out of his line of reading and thought' (Courtney, 323). This view has been convincingly challenged, especially in relation to the years 1795-1802, when Lamb's literary associations (especially with Coleridge and Lloyd) were enough to have him categorized as a radical. Politically minded critics have also linked Lamb's partiality to drink, to theatre, and to conversational rudeness with late eighteenth-century expressions of socio-political discontent from Londoners oppositional to the governments of the day. In the mingling in his works of acquiescence with hints of protest, recent criticism has concentrated more on the latter strain. He continued to maintain boldly public associations with such provocatively dissident liberals as Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, and (in his later years) William Hone. However, partly because of the lack of a recent biography, a convincing account of Lamb's political allegiances in the 1820s and 1830s is still lacking.

Lamb, Edward Buckton (bap. 1805, d. 1869), architect, was born in London and baptized on 26 June 1805 at St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London, the son of James Lamb, a senior civil servant, amateur artist, and occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy, and his wife, Frances. One of the most daringly original Gothic revivalists, he was apprenticed to Lewis Nockalls Cottingham and exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from the age of eighteen. He entered the Royal Academy Schools on 22 October 1827. By 1828 he was practising independently at 9 Hamilton Place, London, and in 1830 he published 'Etchings of Gothic Ornament' (4 vols.). Around 1831 he met the landscape gardener and horticultural writer John Claudius Loudon and, for the next twelve years, busied himself with various designs and essays for Loudon's publications, principally the 'Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm and Villa Architecture' (1833; rev. 2nd edn with supplement, 1842) and the 'Architectural Magazine' (1834-8). 
Lamb's vigorous interpretation of Loudon's principles became the mainstay of his creative endeavour. In 'Studies of Ancient Domestic Architecture' (1846), and in several lectures and writings during his later life, he championed architecture as a progressive art, fusing the picturesque (aesthetic) past with the functional (ethical) future. Elected a fellow of the Institute of British Architects in 1837, Lamb resigned in 1844, only to be re-elected in 1860. He entered designs to some of the most prodigious architectural competitions of his day, and earned much critical praise. Between 1845 and 1869 his small practice generated over 100 buildings, mainly churches and country houses, but also town halls and corn markets, parsonages, cottages, schools, mechanics' institutes, a London hotel, and a consumption hospital. His entire career was founded upon the patronage of the landed aristocracy. Between 1862 and 1863 he remodelled Hughenden Manor, Buckinghamshire, for Benjamin Disraeli, having beforehand designed a monument to Disraeli's father. 
Lamb was the 'arch-rogue' of High Victorian inventiveness -- the 'bete noire' of the Ecclesiologists. His quasi-centralized church plans in the tradition of Wren, and his highly mannered interpretation of late English Perpendicular Gothic, earned him but the bitter enmity of the pious Camdenians. His most innovative churches include Christ Church, Hartlepool (1850), St Stephen, Aldwark, Yorkshire (1851-3), St Martin, Gospel Oak, London (1864), and St Mary Magdalene, Addiscombe, Croydon (1868-9). 
Having overspent dwindling proceeds on a large country house for himself in Kent, Lamb died, bankrupt, at his London home, 3 Hinde Street, Manchester Square, on 29 August 1869. He was survived by his wife, Caroline Frances ('b'. 1820/21), possibly 'nee' Nixon, a music teacher, a son, Edward Beckitt Lamb, architect, and two daughters.

Lamb, Frederick James, Baron Beauvale and third Viscount Melbourne (1782-1853), diplomatist, was born on 17 April 1782, the third son and third of six surviving children of Elizabeth Lamb, nee Milbanke, Viscountess Melbourne (d. 1818). It seems probable that his father was not her husband, Peniston Lamb, first Viscount Melbourne (1745-1828), but George O'Brien Wyndham, third earl of Egremont (1751-1837). His elder brother, William Lamb, second Viscount Melbourne, was to be prime minister, and his sister Emily ['see 'Temple, Emily Mary, Viscountess Palmerston] was to be the wife of another. They were to be separated for much of their lives, but Fred remained close to William and Emily, and they carried on a voluminous correspondence. 
Fred Lamb was educated with William at Eton College, at Glasgow University under Professor John Millar, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his MA in 1803. He initially joined the army, as a cornet in the Horse Guards (1803), but in 1811 joined the diplomatic service as secretary of legation to Naples, moving in the same capacity in 1813 to Vienna. The prince regent (who was probably the father of at least one of the other Lamb children) took an interest in launching his career. In 1815 he went as minister-plenipotentiary to Munich, remaining there for five years. He was sworn of the privy council in 1822, in which year he went to Frankfurt as minister. From 1825 to 1827 he was minister in Madrid, and in the latter year was appointed GCB. 
In December 1827 Sir Frederick was sent to Lisbon as ambassador to Portugal, where Dom Miguel, the uncle of the queen, was attempting to usurp the throne. A British force previously sent to support the constitutionalist queen was due to leave Portugal, but Lamb detained them on his own responsibility, in an unsuccessful attempt to frustrate Dom Miguel's plan. Although the Wellington ministry endorsed his actions, the troops were nevertheless recalled; in England the following August, Lamb made no secret of the fact that he thought the government had acted 'very ill and foolishly in first encouraging and then abandoning the wretched constitutionalists to their fate' ('Greville Memoirs', 1.141). On 13 May 1831 Lamb was appointed ambassador at the court of Vienna, and remained there until the whigs fell from office in 1841. A 'hard-headed reactionary' (Bourne, 461), Lamb bombarded his brother (as home secretary and then prime minister) with warnings against the radicals in the whig government, and his conservatism in foreign policy brought him into conflict with the foreign secretary, Palmerston. Lamb was, however, more at home in Metternich's Vienna than he would have been in Paris (to which his seniority and skill probably entitled him); there his differences with Palmerston could scarcely have been contained. Lamb was created Baron Beauvale in 1839, and succeeded his brother as third Viscount Melbourne in 1848. 
Fred Lamb was a thorough whig (despite his political conservatism), by upbringing and position. A product of the eccentric social, political, and moral 'milieu' of the Melbourne and Devonshire House set, he tended to see 'life in the most degrading light, and he simplifies the thing by thinking all men rogues and all women [whores]' (Lady Granville, cited in Mitchell, 10). He had a constant succession of mistresses, both amateur and professional (including Harriette Wilson, who gave him a friendly write-up in her notorious 'Memoirs'), until his very late marriage on 25 February 1841. His wife, the Countess Alexandrina Julia Theresa Wilhelmina Sophia (Adine) von Maltzahn (1818-1894), daughter of the Prussian minister at Vienna, was some thirty-five years his junior, but the marriage was successful (if childless), and Lady Beauvale was devoted to her ageing, increasingly valetudinarian husband. Frederick's relationship with his brother Melbourne resumed the closeness of their youth in the 1840s, and the Beauvales took the burden of responsibility for Melbourne in his final years. Frederick retained his liking for political gossip, and his letters continued unabated: his sister remained his most important correspondent, but he also remained in touch with the Russian Princess Lieven. He died, the third and last Viscount Melbourne, at his home, Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, on 29 January 1853, having suffered terribly with gout for some time. His young widow was genuinely prostrated with grief, but eventually recovered and in 1856 married John George, second Baron Forester. The Lamb estates passed to his sister, Emily Palmerston.

Lamb, George (1784-1834), politician and writer, had a disputed parentage. His mother was certainly Elizabeth Lamb (bap. 1751, d. 1818), daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, and wife of Peniston Lamb, first Viscount Melbourne (1745-1828). His father was generally believed to have been George IV (1762-1830). That monarch took a benign and lifelong interest in his career and stood as his godfather. Lamb was therefore the half-brother of William Lamb, the future prime minister; of Frederick Lamb, the future Lord Beauvale; and of Emily Lamb, successively the wife of lords Cowper and Palmerston ['see 'Temple, Emily Mary, Viscountess Palmerston]. Born on 11 July 1784, Lamb followed his brothers first to Eton College, from 1796 to 1802, and then to Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1802 to 1805. Unlike them, he spent no time in Scottish universities, but proceeded straight to Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar in 1809 and practised on the northern circuit. 
Red-haired and red-faced, Lamb's immoderate intake of alcohol enhanced the Lamb family's reputation for high spirits. Melbourne described him as 'very intemperate... He drank a great deal, much more than we did' (Queen Victoria's journal, 6 June 1838). According to Lady Harriet Cavendish, 'he really has not half an hour's good behaviour in him... he is like a schoolboy, when he has been good and quiet for a long time for him, he begins making a noise, teizing ['sic'] the dogs, spoiling the furniture and then we say, 'Don't, George, pray be quiet, dear George. Oh, leave that alone,' just as I do to your children when they question' ('Hary-O', 268-9). Animal spirits were moderated by a genial good nature that made him for some 'a most agreeable man'. Within his family he was known as 'Curly Pate'. 
On 17 May 1809 Lamb married Caroline Rosalie Adelaide St Jules, the illegitimate daughter of Lady Elizabeth Foster and the fifth duke of Devonshire. She was henceforth known as 'Caro George' or, unflatteringly, as 'Cleopatra'. Generously, the duke settled $20,000 on the young couple, together with an annuity of $500 per annum. After the death of the first Viscount Melbourne in 1828 their income rose to $3,000 per annum. In spite of this the marriage was somewhat uneven. In 1816 Lamb's wife decamped to Italy with Henry Brougham to conduct a much-publicized 'affaire', describing herself as the victim of neglect and drunkenness. Byron unkindly called Lamb 'Gay Thalia's luckless victory' and all his relations that 'cuckoldy family' (Stuart, 159-60). The couple were reconciled in 1817 and remained together until Lamb's death. There were no children from the marriage. 
From a very early age Lamb evinced a passion for the theatre, first as an actor and writer in private theatricals, and then as a dramatist. In 1807 his play 'Whistle for It' was produced at Covent Garden. This was a Gothic piece, brimming over with brigands and talk of daggers. In the denouement, however, a pair of young lovers are rescued by an anti-hero called Andrew, who cheerfully admits that he has never killed anyone in his life. In 1815 Lamb joined the management committee of Drury Lane, and, six years later, gave up the law completely as an unwelcome distraction from his dramatic pursuits. His sister observed that 'his heart is in Drury Lane, and he thinks of nothing but plays and epilogues and prologues'. He was also a classical scholar of some quality. A translation of the poems of Catullus was published in 1821. He thought, perhaps significantly, that the Roman poet 'inclined to constancy in love, had his constancy met with return'. 
In politics Lamb was the most radical member of his family. In 1819 he agreed to 'rough it' by contesting Westminster for the whigs. He won, though his committee rooms were sacked and he himself had to go into hiding. Losing the seat the following year, he was returned (on the Devonshire interest) for the Irish borough of Dungarvan in 1822, and represented that constituency until his death. He spoke in the house 'in a sensible and intrepid style', supporting such radical measures as triennial parliaments, the abolition of corrupt boroughs, and the setting up of an inquiry into the Peterloo massacre. He was a friend of both Daniel O'Connell and Francis Place. When his brother became home secretary, in November 1830, Lamb was appointed under-secretary in the same department, a post he held until his death. By all accounts Lamb showed himself to be an efficient and effective administrator. He was used as an intermediary between the government and the radicals in the difficult years before and after the passing of the first 'Reform Bill'. William Lamb later called George 'his great favourite' (Queen Victoria's journal, 14 June 1838); and after her husband's death, Caro George felt the prime minister must suffer 'a pang' whenever he went into 'that room, where they were so happy together' (Panshanger MSS, D.ELb F 81). George Lamb died suddenly on 2 January 1834 at his house in Whitehall Yard, Westminster, London, and was buried at Hatfield on the 9th.

Lambe, James (bap. 1599, d. 1664), oriental scholar, was baptized on 2 February 1599 at All Saints, Oxford, the son of Richard Lambe and his second wife. He attended Magdalen College School, matriculated from Brasenose College on 2 July 1613, graduated BA on 13 December 1615, and proceeded MA (from St Mary Hall) on 11 December 1619. He spent much of his life as chaplain to Thomas Wriothesley, fourth earl of Southampton, in whose gift were the ecclesiastical livings which Lambe held. He became rector of Botley, Hampshire, in 1639, and subsequently vicar of Titchfield in the same county (the location of Southampton's seat) but, no doubt because of his patron's royalist sympathies in the civil war, this living was sequestered in 1647. Lambe married Elizabeth Beeston ('nee' Bromfield), widow of William Beeston, after 1636. They had no children, but by his marriage Lambe became stepfather to William Beeston (1636-1702), later lieutenant-governor of Jamaica, and Henry Beeston (later master of Winchester College and warden of New College). 
Lambe acquired expertise in oriental languages, especially Arabic, presumably by independent study since he left Oxford before an Arabic lectureship was established. He published nothing but his reputation was such that Edmund Castell invited him in 1658 to join in compiling the 'Heptaglot lexicon' (he refused). Among the papers which he bequeathed to Henry Beeston were nine notebooks, which Beeston donated to the Bodleian Library in 1669 (MSS Lambe). These illustrate his assiduity in studying Arabic grammar and vocabulary, to which (apart from excerpts from the Syriac 'Bible') they are all devoted. They also reveal that Lambe's learning was derived from a very narrow range of materials, principally the publications of the Dutch oriental scholar Erpenius, especially his Arabic grammar and his edition of al-Makin's history, the 'Historia Saracenica' (1625). 
After the Restoration, Lambe was rewarded by the king with a canon's prebend at Westminster (23 July 1660) and the title of DD Oxon. (9 August 1660), and by Southampton with the rectory of St Andrews, Holborn (4 January 1663). He died in the canon's lodgings at Westminster, survived by his wife, on 18 October 1664, and was buried in Westminster Abbey two days later.

Lamb, John (1789-1850), college head and dean of Bristol, born at Ixworth, Suffolk, on 28 February 1789, was the eldest surviving son of John Lamb (died 1842), perpetual curate of Ixworth, vicar of Haxey, Lincolnshire, and rector of Stretton, Rutland, and his wife, Maria, daughter of William Hovell of Backwell Ash, Suffolk. He studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1811 as fifteenth and last wrangler, and proceeded MA in 1814, BD in 1822, and DD in 1827. In January 1822, at an unusually young age, he was chosen master of his college, in succession to Philip Douglas. On 19 March 1822 he married Ann ('bap'. 1801), third daughter of Benjamin Hutchinson, rector of Cranford, Northamptonshire. He was vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1823-4. In 1824 he was presented by the college to the perpetual curacy of St Benedict in Cambridge; on 20 October 1837 he was nominated by the crown to the deanery of Bristol; and in 1845 he was instituted, on the presentation of the dean and chapter of Bristol, to the vicarage of Olveston, Gloucestershire, which he held until his death, with his mastership and deanery. In politics he firmly maintained whig principles, which led to a conspiracy to prevent his holding the office of vice-chancellor a second time. He died on 19 April 1850, at the lodge of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and was buried on the 26th in a vault under the college chapel. He had ten sons and four daughters; one of the daughters, Emily, married Norman Macleod Ferrers, sometime master of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. 
Lamb's principal works were 'An Historical Account of the XXXIX Articles' (1829; 2nd edn, 1835); 'Masters's history of the college of Corpus Christi in the University of Cambridge; with additional matter and a continuation to the present time' (1831); 'Hebrew Characters Derived from Hieroglyphics' (1835; 2nd edn, 1835); 'A collection of letters, statutes, and other documents from the MS library of Corpus Christi College, illustrative of the history of the University of Cambridge during the time of the Reformation' (1838). Some minor writings are noted in P. Bury, 'The College of Corpus Christi' (49).

Lamb, Mary Anne (1764-1847), children's writer, was born on 3 December 1764 in the Inner Temple, London, the second of the three surviving of the seven children of John Lamb ('c'.1725-1799), waiter at the Inner Temple, and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1796), daughter of Mary Field, housekeeper at Blakesware House in Hertfordshire. Charles Lamb (1775-1834) was the third surviving child. In contrast to her two brothers, John and Charles, both educated at Christ's Hospital, Mary received little formal schooling, apart from a few years at a local day school. Apprenticed to a needlewoman, she was soon contributing to the family income as a mantua maker. 
A voracious reader throughout life -- a habit developed in childhood when she was granted free range of the library of her father's employer, Samuel Salt, a bencher of the Inner Temple -- Mary Lamb also taught herself Latin, French, and Italian in her later years. After Salt's death in 1792 her parents were obliged to quit the Temple, and moved with their two younger children, Mary and Charles, to cramped and impoverished lodgings in 7 Little Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. It was there, on 22 September 1796, that Mary Lamb, in a sudden and violent fit of insanity, killed her mother with a knife stab to the heart; the accumulated strain of nursing a senile father and a bedridden mother, while also maintaining the family through her needlework, had exacerbated a psychological disorder subsequently categorized by her brother's twentieth-century biographers as a manic-depressive illness. In 1796 the law allowed violent lunatics to be released into the care of their relatives, if sufficient surety was given that they would be cared for as potentially dangerous for the rest of their lives. This surety her brother Charles gave, thus saving his sister from incarceration in Bethlem Hospital; he acted against the wishes of the remaining members of the family. Subsequently Mary and Charles lived together until Charles's death in 1834; neither ever married, and their 'double singleness', as Charles described it, was interrupted only by Mary's periodic illnesses, which often necessitated her removal to private madhouses. But both made great efforts to maintain a cheerful and convivial domestic life, and in 1823 they adopted and successfully reared Emma Isola, an orphan of Italian extraction, who later married Charles Lamb's publisher, Edward Moxon. 
In the winter of 1805-6, Mary Lamb was commissioned by Mary Jane Godwin (the second wife of William Godwin), who had established a publishing venture concentrating on material for children, to write a prose version of Shakespeare's plays. When 'Tales from Shakespear, Designed for the Use of Young Persons' was published in 1807, however, it appeared under Charles Lamb's name; not merely the gender prejudices of the period but more significantly, perhaps, her history, and the manner of her mother's death, probably left his sister disinclined to draw any public attention to herself. Charles had also contributed to the volume, writing its versions of the tragedies. They subsequently prepared together two further volumes for Mrs Godwin's 'Juvenile Library', 'Mrs Leicester's School, or, The History of Several Young Ladies, Related by themselves' and 'Poetry for Children, Entirely Original', both of which were published anonymously in 1809. In each case, as with 'Tales from Shakespear', about two-thirds of the texts were Mary's work. Her books for children are marked by an unpretentious lucidity of style, and a capacity to enter into the point of view of her readers, also evident in her letters and in the one piece of writing for adults she published, the essay 'On needle-work' contributed to the 'British Lady's Magazine and Monthly Miscellany' (1 April 1815). In this essay, and in 'Mrs Leicester's School', she shows a particular concern for the well-being of disadvantaged women and girls. Her remonstrations on such issues as the lack of remunerative female employment, and the vulnerability of young women to social and parental pressures, show her attempting to spare others through her writing stresses she had herself experienced; some of her stories in 'Mrs Leicester's School' clearly have an autobiographical content. Mary Lamb outlived her brother by a number of years, her last decades darkened by increasingly lengthy periods of insanity; she died at her home, 40 Alpha Road, in St John's Wood, London, on 20 May 1847, and was buried on 28 May in Charles Lamb's grave in Edmonton churchyard, Middlesex.

Lamb, Sir Matthew, first baronet (1705?-1768), politician and lawyer, was probably born in 1705, the second son of Matthew Lamb (died 1735), an attorney of Southwell in Nottinghamshire and land agent to the Coke family of Melbourne, Derbyshire. His elder brother Robert (1702-1769) became dean of Peterborough in 1744 and bishop of Peterborough in 1764. It is likely that Matthew Lamb also had a sister for, in August 1738, a Miss Lamb, ''Sister' of -- Lamb of 'Lincoln''s-Inn, Esq.' was married to Richard Middlemore ('GM', 435). 
Lamb was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 26 January 1726 and called to the bar on 26 April 1733, having received his legal training from his uncle Peniston Lamb who was a successful pleader 'under the bar', that is, a conveyancing lawyer holding a position between that of an attorney and counsel. It was said of Peniston Lamb, who had himself been admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1708, that he was skilled in 'pleading and demurring, weaving settlements and ravelling threads of adverse wills' (Torrens, 11). When Lamb's uncle died on 29 January 1735 he left him a fortune estimated at $100,000 as well as his chambers in Lincoln's Inn. 
Through his uncle, the executor of the will and guardian of the children of John, second Earl Fitzwilliam, Lamb became land agent, legal adviser, and moneylender to many members of the aristocracy. The sums he lent were considerable. This is demonstrated by Sarah, first duchess of Marlborough's complaining that she and Lord Godolphin were not receiving their jointures because the third duke was paying interest to Lamb at the rate of no less than $9000 a year out of the trust estate (Rowse, 53). Lamb managed the financial affairs of Lord Holdernesse from 1739 to 1768 and in the latter year made him a loan of $6000 secured by a bond (BL, Egerton MS 3497, fols. 1-76, 121). He was also legal adviser to Lord Salisbury and Lord Egmont, and enriched himself at their expense. By way of explaining to a visitor to Brocket Hall how a right of fishing through part of the property, almost up to the park, belonged to Lord Salisbury, his grandson the second Viscount Melbourne said: 'Well, I believe that my grandfather did the Salisburys out of some land in that direction, and was generous enough to leave them the fishing' (Hayward, 332). 
The intimate knowledge which Lamb possessed of the affairs of the aristocracy gave him an influence which he well knew how to wield, and upon whom. Therefore, when Robert Lamb was nominated to the see of Peterborough in 1764 he almost certainly owed that preferment to his younger brother's pressing his claims to the bishopric upon the duke of Newcastle. Lamb was appointed solicitor to the revenue of the Post Office in 1738. He also held the office of counsel to the Board of Trade and Plantations. However, a proposal in 1746 to appoint him king's counsel met with opposition from the legal profession because 'he never was an hour in Westminster Hall as a counsel in his life' ('Polwarth MSS', 5.186). In August 1756 Lamb was appointed 'custos rotulorum' for the liberty of Peterborough in the county of Northampton, gaining power thereby over appointments to the magistracy. Despite the earlier opposition to his appointment as king's counsel, he finally attained that dignity in 1754. 
Lamb was returned to parliament for the constituency of Stockbridge in 1741, and in 1747 was elected to Peterborough, a seat which he managed in the Fitzwilliam interest until his death. He was created a baronet on 17 January 1755, perhaps through the intercession of the duke of Newcastle. About 1740 Lamb married Charlotte, daughter of the Right Honourable Thomas Coke, a privy councillor and vice-chamberlain to Queen Anne, and sister and heiress of George Lewis Coke. Through his marriage he acquired Melbourne Hall as a residence on George Coke's unexpected death in 1751. He had already acquired Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, by purchase from the representatives of Sir Thomas Winnington in 1746. Lamb and his wife had three children: Peniston (1745-1828), who succeeded to the baronetcy, and was created Lord (1770) and Viscount (1781) Melbourne in the Irish peerage and Lord Melbourne in the English peerage (1815); Charlotte, who married Henry, second Earl Fauconberg in 1766, and died in 1790; and Anne, who died unmarried in 1768. Lamb's grandson was William Lamb, second Viscount Melbourne (1779-1848). 
In 1756 Lamb moved from Red Lion Square, London, an area inhabited by judges and senior counsel, to the more fashionable Sackville Street in Piccadilly. Before moving to Sackville Street he entered into abortive negotiations in 1754 with Lord Strafford for the purchase of a house in Albemarle Street which had been occupied by the late Lady Strafford. He died after a short illness on 5 November 1768 and was buried at Bishop's Hatfield, Hertfordshire. His will was proved in November 1768 when his property, half of which was in personalty, was valued at nearly $1 million.

Lamb, William, second Viscount Melbourne (1779-1848), prime minister, was born in London on 15 March 1779 at Melbourne House, Piccadilly (later divided into the apartments known as the Albany), in law the second child of Peniston Lamb (1745-1828), a substantial landowner in Derbyshire and Hertfordshire, for many years an MP of no distinction, and from 1770 an Irish peer as first Baron Melbourne (Viscount Melbourne from 1781). His mother was Elizabeth Lamb, nee Milbanke (bap. 1751, d. 1818), only daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, bt, of Halnaby, Yorkshire, but owing to the desuetude of her marriage his true father was widely held to be anyone but Lord Melbourne; contemporary suspicion rested on the fabulous aesthete Lord Egremont ['see 'Wyndham, George O'Brien, third earl of Egremont]. Only the eldest son, Peniston, had a sound claim to legitimacy; there followed after William two brothers, Frederick (Fred) James Lamb (later first Baron Beauvale) and George Lamb (MP for Westminster), and two sisters, Emily, successively Lady Cowper and Lady Palmerston ['see 'Temple, Emily], and the short-lived Harriet. 
Lamb was born into a family of no great fame or antiquity, but into a social circle of high-pitched wit, wealth, and rather febrile emotion. His father was coarse and neglectful and hugged the background, often in retreat at Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire. Lady Melbourne, in contrast, was a jewel of high whig society, admired for her hospitality at Melbourne House, her great charm, and forcefulness of character. Beneath the surface of verve and cheerful self-confidence, however, lay a current of hardness and sadness, derived perhaps from the personal sacrifices that had been necessary to make her way in society without the aid of her husband. She worked hard to cultivate and promote her sons. Already in 1785 the little Lambs were well publicized by Reynolds's portrait of Peniston, William, and Fred, engraved as 'The Affectionate Brothers'. Peniston was an early disappointment to Lady Melbourne, taking after his father and inclining to sensual pleasures and the turf, so her hopes rested increasingly on William. He was entered at Eton College in November 1788, a spoilt and bookish child, in love with his mama and with Shakespeare. Yet a certain poise was already evident and he escaped the worse bullying to become a social success. At Trinity College, Cambridge, where he arrived in October 1796, he ran with the fastest crowd, but to his mother's delight showed more real enthusiasm for Rousseau and poetry than for fools and horses. His prize declamation, 'The progressive improvements of mankind', attracted Charles James Fox's attention and was commended by him in the House of Commons. 
After taking his degree in July 1799, Lamb was sent with his brother Fred to Scotland to study for a few terms with the Glasgow 'lumiere' John Millar. This course of treatment did not have the desired effect, in that Lamb's intellectual development never leaned towards the kind of social, political, and metaphysical speculation for which the Scottish Enlightenment was famed; he preferred the classics, history, literature, and religious speculation only at a distance (Tudor and Stuart controversies were a favourite). He found Millar's Francophilia to be slightly ridiculous and, in the political circumstances of the time, even dangerous. He began to question some of his inherited whig opinions. 
Yet on entering 'the World' after his return from Scotland, Lamb quickly became a darling of whig society. Physically he presented a commanding figure, tall and conventionally good-looking, with masses of curling hair and dark, beetling brows. His wide reading and keen perception made him a brilliant conversationalist, especially popular with the ladies of the Devonshire House set. Unusually in the fast crowd with which he still ran, he abstained from the crudest sexual importuning and preferred the pleasures of flirtation and gourmandizing. His mother's only anxiety was for his growing tendency to inactivity and introspection. 
This tendency she was not able to halt by finding Lamb profitable occupation. He had been entered at Lincoln's Inn in July 1797, so as to keep his terms concurrently with Cambridge, but was called to the bar only at Michaelmas 1804. After a single brief on the northern circuit the death of his elder brother, Peniston, on 24 January 1805 required him to consider an occupation better suited to a future peer. With glee Lady Melbourne prepared for him a glorious career in politics. He joined Brooks's Club in April with Fox as his sponsor, and in January 1806 was brought into parliament for Leominster in the place of his friend Arthur Kinnaird. Too much the debutant to win a place in the 'ministry of all the talents', he was nevertheless asked by Lord Howick to move the address in December 1806; it was his maiden speech. His whig patrons moved him to the Haddington burghs in the election of 1806 and to Portarlington in 1807. Thereafter he remained a promising young man for several years, making occasionally effective interventions in debate but displaying little zeal or talent for oratory. Both his indecisiveness and his political scepticism were showing. He had little taste for the rhetorical excesses of opposition and, though he generally voted with the whigs because he found loyalty the easiest option, at heart he shared ministers' anxieties about outdoor agitation and their desire to prosecute war with Napoleon to the utmost. 
Lamb's political difficulties were compounded in these years by romantic difficulties of a spectacular kind. His marriage on 3 June 1805 to Lady Caroline Ponsonby (1785-1828) ['see 'Lamb, Lady Caroline], daughter of his Devonshire House friend Lady Bessborough, had only exacerbated his latent psychological conflicts. The two were never able to establish a normal family life. After a miscarriage in January 1806, in August 1807 Caroline bore a son, Augustus, who was prone to convulsions and developmentally retarded, and then a daughter in January 1809 who died after a few days. No further pregnancies ensued, but subsequently a number of shadowy 'adopted' children appeared for brief periods in the Lambs' household. Even had these efforts to rear a family not proved abortive, William and Caroline might not have made a happy couple. His firmness and confidence were too superficial to provide the constant attention and discipline that her flights of fancy, even lunacy, seemed to require. Within a few years of marriage she had launched into a series of public liaisons, most disastrously with the poet Lord Byron in 1812-13. Byron's repudiation of her led to a theatrical suicide attempt at Lady Heathcote's ball in July 1813, after which her grip on sanity, never firm, loosened progressively. Posterity remains divided in assigning the blame for this disaster: William's indecisiveness, Caroline's erratic behaviour, the Lamb family's hostility, and Byron's callousness all played a role. But certainly William's inability to grapple with Caroline's problems led to the long, drawn-out denouement; no formal separation was arranged until 1825, after which date Caroline lived alone at the Lamb country houses, Brocket and Melbourne. 
It seems reasonable to see Lamb's private disappointments as contributing to his deepening political disappointments, that is, both his failure to shine as a House of Commons man and his disillusionment with whig idealism. Always prone to scepticism and detachment, he was now more than ever reluctant to commit himself to great causes or to reveal what deep feelings he did hold. During Perceval's ministry he showed signs of supporting Canning's line in foreign policy and the conduct of the Peninsular campaign, but he declined disdainfully the minor office offered to him by Perceval in early 1812. He seemed hardly bothered by the loss of his seat at the general election of that year, a sentiment shared by Brougham, who regarded him as little short of a tory. 
Lamb did not think much of Canning personally but he was drawn inexorably to his centrist politics, without either whig rhetoric or tory bigotry. Social considerations made it easier for him to distance himself from the whigs. Lamb had become friendly with J. W. Ward, and he admired greatly William Huskisson; by 1816 his beloved sister, Emily, though married to Lord Cowper, had become the acknowledged lover of the Canningite Lord Palmerston. The death of Lady Melbourne in 1818 removed another obstacle. Consequently when he returned to parliament in April 1816, brought in for Peterborough by Lord Fitzwilliam, he insisted on taking an independent line, reaffirming to Lord Holland his commitment to the whig principles of 1688 but not to 'a heap of modern additions, interpolations, facts and fictions' (Ziegler, 70). He spoke against parliamentary reform and for a firm response to domestic sedition, serving on the secret committee to consider civil disorder in February 1817 and voting subsequently to suspend habeas corpus. He took equivocal positions on Peterloo and the Queen Caroline affair. 
And yet the role of hanger-on to a centrist leader-in-waiting was hardly one to set the political juices flowing. In 1819 Lamb accepted a more dignified constituency, the county of Hertfordshire, but did little with it, and when faced with whig opposition at the 1826 election he simply withdrew. Thus when Canning's moment finally arrived, upon Lord Liverpool's death in April 1827, Lamb had to be found a ministerial borough -- briefly Newport, then Bletchingley -- in order to qualify for office. That office was the pivotal chief secretaryship of Ireland, which he won not by dint of administrative merit or knowledge of Ireland but because his whig connections and known sympathies for the Catholic claims secured for Canning crucial whig votes. 
Lamb was surprisingly successful as chief secretary, an office he continued to hold after Canning's death in the Goderich and Wellington ministries. He found some resolution to his political contradictions in a style that was superficially liberal and tolerant, and particularly alive to the importance of symbolic nuance in influencing public opinion, but was scornful of legislative reforms and favoured a strong, deflating, disciplinary response to extra-parliamentary agitation. He supported Catholic emancipation without believing it would improve the condition of the Irish people one whit, and he won popularity among Catholic eminences by appearing sympathetic and open-minded without pursuing any particular line of reform. 
Fortuitously, Lamb found a similar resolution in his private life. Liberated by his separation from Caroline, he embarked on a liaison with the Dublin hostess Elizabeth La Touche, Lady Branden, in the autumn of 1827, probably a sexual attachment, certainly a deeply affectionate one that persisted at a distance after his departure from Dublin in 1828. Less demanding than Caroline, Lady Branden could appeal in moderation to both sides of Lamb's character -- his pose of cool detachment and his well of feeling. As Philip Ziegler's biography reveals, a game of male chastisement of female misbehaviour featured in their correspondence. This relationship was not much affected by Lamb's citation as co-respondent in Lord Branden's divorce suit of May 1828, which was dismissed for lack of evidence after Lamb paid Branden off. 
Despite his personal opposition to parliamentary reform, Lamb resigned from office with his fellow Huskissonites in May 1828 over the disposition of East Retford's disfranchised seats. Huskisson's inheritance of the moderate leadership from Canning had helped to cement Lamb's loyalties there, as had Emily's unfolding role as a Huskissonite hostess at Panshanger, near Lamb's country house at Brocket in Hertfordshire. Particularly after Caroline's death in January 1828 made Brocket once more safe to approach, Lamb spent more and more of his time there and at Panshanger. His father's death in July 1828 also cleared the occupancy of Melbourne Hall, and further freed him from House of Commons responsibilities, as Lamb inherited the English peerage his father had added to his Irish titles in 1815. Henceforward he was known as Viscount Melbourne and sat in the Lords. As such, the vicissitudes of politics would catapult him into an unlikely role as a leader not only of the whig party but of whig government. 
The Canningites were again in a powerful position when, after the 1830 general election and Wellington's resignation in November, they provided the key votes in the construction of a whig majority. Melbourne was one of the 'three viscounts' of the Canning party -- the others were Palmerston and Goderich -- who monopolized the secretaryships of state in Lord Grey's new government. Huskisson's sudden death in a railway accident thrust Palmerston into a position of leadership, and he secured for himself the Foreign Office and for his lover's brother the Home Office. This latter appointment surprised many people and shocked many whigs, who did not rate either Melbourne's administrative abilities or his party fidelity. Yet again Melbourne confounded the doubters. As with his Irish appointment, Melbourne's combination of superficial sympathy and firm disciplinary handling proved useful to a precarious reforming government seeking both to flatter public opinion and to reassure the forces of order by a firm administration of the law. 
Melbourne took little interest in the great parliamentary business of the Grey government. Never a principled believer in parliamentary reform, he accepted the argument that it was necessary to restore popular confidence in government and even acted as some slight restraint on Palmerston's efforts to dilute the government's bill. He spoke only briefly in the Lords' debates on the measures. In social reforms that might be thought to come within the Home Office's ambit, he took little more part. He sat on the cabinet committee that framed the new poor law but hardly contributed to its deliberations. That business, as well as legislation to limit the hours of factory labour, he left to Althorp, Brougham, and teams of commissioners nominally working under his supervision. He did not care even to hear about the living and working conditions of the poor, believing them to be part of the natural order of things and certainly irremediable by legislation. 'The whole duty of government', he pronounced, 'is to prevent and punish crime, and to preserve contracts' (Cecil, 305). But he accepted with equanimity his colleagues' assurances that positive legislation was necessary to secure the acquiescence of the governed. 
Against breaches of the law, however, Melbourne acted both vigorously and sensitively, and it was for this function that his reforming brethren thanked him heartily. In dealing with the Swing riots of 1830-31 he checked tory magistrates' alarmism and was reluctant to resort to the army or even the yeomanry, but urged magistrates to use fully their ordinary powers, augmented by special constables and large bounties on the arrest of rioters and incendiaries. He appointed a special commission to try about a thousand of those arrested, but ensured that strict justice was adhered to -- a third of those tried were acquitted, and although a fifth were sentenced to death most of the sentences were commuted to transportation. The same balancing act was carried off in dealing with the reform disturbances of 1831-2. Melbourne rebuffed calls for extraordinary measures, such as the extensive employment of spies, but used existing powers of prosecution and regulated assemblies rigorously. 
Melbourne's antipathy to new legislation did not wholly apply to questions of public order. He considered various ways of systematically improving police and punishment. One of his first acts in office was to appoint the political economist Nassau Senior to inquire into the legality of industrial combinations, but in the end he rejected Senior's recommendation for a more severe repression of such combinations. Trade unions, he felt, were unreasonable and absurd, contrary to the law of nature but not susceptible to the law of humans. He told manufacturers that 'the Government would repress violence and punish crime', but that as for combinations, 'nothing will open the eyes of the working people, but the blowing out of forges, the stopping of mills, and the leaving the men... to indigence and beggary' (UCL, Brougham MSS 43498). However, in one famous case -- that of the 'Dorchester labourers', or Tolpuddle Martyrs -- he did not entirely follow his own advice. He allowed tory magistrates to prosecute six agricultural trade unionists to such an extent as to arouse a massive protest movement, and left it to his successor, Lord John Russell, to calm the waters by commuting sentences. More positively, Melbourne devised in 1832 a bill that would have extended London's system of a stipendiary magistracy and police force to the provinces. Although this bill was never introduced -- it was overshadowed first by the 'Reform Bill' and later by poor-law reform -- it shows that Melbourne was willing and able to grasp the nettle of administrative reform where matters close to his heart were touched. 
Melbourne did not always win the credit he deserved for his firm hand on the helm. In September 1831 Grey sought to replace him on grounds of indolence. Holland successfully parried the accusation, maintaining that 'a dislike to meddling legislation and his careless nonchalant Manner might give him the character of an indolent man with the inobservant, but those who had business with the office did not find him so' (H. R. V. Holland, 'The Holland House Diaries, 1831-1840', ed A. D. Kriegel, 1977, 48). Melbourne had only himself to blame for such scrapes. The lazy manner he had devised to indulge his sense of fun and at the same time disguise his vulnerabilities was ill suited to a senior statesman. He received deputations with every appearance of cool carelessness. He surrounded himself with like-minded cronies, notably his brother George (who served as under-secretary at the Home Office until his death in early 1834) and his private secretary, Tom Young, sometime purser on the duke of Devonshire's yacht. In cabinet and in society he pretended to know and care far less than he did. These traits grew more pronounced as he aged. What had in his youth been viewed as stylish insouciance now came to appear more eccentric. Strangers could be alarmed by his habits: barking out imprecations, rubbing his hands gleefully at some private joke, audibly muttering to himself while by-standing in the Lords, occasionally weeping silently when mysteriously touched by some happenstance. 
Nevertheless, Melbourne had by this stage achieved a happiness that had escaped him earlier. He had won the prominence that he had always felt to be his desert. He no longer allowed himself to be hurt or spurned or disappointed. And in 1831 he found a substitute for Lady Branden in Caroline Norton (1808-1877), granddaughter of his hero Sheridan and wife of an abusive husband. This relationship followed roughly the pattern of its predecessor; it is less likely to have been sexual, but it provided Melbourne with the same emotional reassurance, while allowing him to play mild games of hot-and-cold flirtation and discipline. It, too, led to a brush with the law. George Norton cited Melbourne as co-respondent in 1836 and, unlike the Branden affair, this one had its day in court. Acquittal was never in doubt, but Melbourne was bruised by the public exposure and his ardour for Mrs Norton cooled with what she felt to be indecent suddenness. He was soon engaged in the lists with Lady Stanhope, apparently a former mistress of his brother Fred. 
It was precisely Melbourne's lack of commitment on the major issues of the day that led to his premiership, when Lord Grey resigned in a huff over Irish affairs in July 1834. His doubts about reform reassured the king and the conservative sections of the whig majority, and yet his acquiescence to the lead then being taken on Irish tithe reform by Lord John Russell secured the support of the forward party. Furthermore, like Grey, he had the authority to play the honest broker among his fractious colleagues; he was, thought Durham, 'the only one of whom none of us would be jealous' (Ziegler, 169). Greville claimed that Melbourne's languor nearly overcame his ambition on this occasion, but that he was persuaded to take the premiership by Tom Young: 'Why, damn it, such a position never was occupied by any Greek or Roman, and, if it only lasts two months, it is well worth while to have been Prime Minister of England'. 'By God that's true', Melbourne is said to have replied, 'I'll go' ('Greville Memoirs', 3.76). 
Yet Melbourne did not show much enthusiasm for the job, declining to move into Downing Street and lingering at Lady Holland's dinner table as late as ever. When, in October, Althorp resigned on the inheritance of his peerage and the king took advantage of the moment to dismiss the government, Melbourne was accused by Brougham and the radicals of giving up office too easily. He then left to Duncannon the business of organizing whig candidates for the ensuing general election, and to Duncannon and Russell the strategy for the new session of parliament. He agreed to employ his personal authority to persuade James Abercromby to contest the speakership and allowed Russell to make Irish tithe appropriation the point of principle on which the tory government was to be challenged, but kept aloof from the Lichfield House compact of 18 February 1835 by which Irish and radical votes were secured for these causes. He was not, therefore, the architect of his own return to the premiership in April 1835. 
Melbourne was not much more the architect of the new government. On one point, the exclusion of Durham and Brougham -- who had offended him on personal as well as political grounds -- he was insistent. But otherwise much of the running in the appointment of ministers and the determination of policy was to be made by Russell, and in foreign affairs by Palmerston. Melbourne's principal task, as before, was to mediate between different sections of the party. He continued to feel that the maintenance of the whigs in power was necessary to cement the people's affections to government, but he had no personal enthusiasm for specific legislative objectives. His task was paradoxically made somewhat easier by the small size of the majority (smaller still after the 1837 election), which to some extent cowed the radicals. In the Lords, where he and the equally lukewarm Lansdowne presided, it was a matter simply of accepting gracefully repeated tory vetoes, particularly on Irish tithes and corporations. As in 1834 this exposed him to accusations of insufficient zeal, on occasions almost treachery, but his critics knew that Russell held the real power in the Commons and that a more pushful premier would hardly have had better luck with the Lords. On a few issues, such as English municipal reform, Melbourne's influence may have been crucial in persuading the tories not to obstruct. 
Though he took no lead in policy, in other respects Melbourne was a worthy premier. As Greville observed, he was 'a gentleman, liberal and straightforward, with no meanness, and incapable of selfish trickery and intrigue' ('Greville Memoirs', 3.118). He kept order in cabinet and handled some fragile egos with frank good humour. He took his patronage responsibilities seriously and was fairly meritocratic, though he deluded himself in thinking Lord Lichfield one of the ablest as well as one of the pleasantest men in England. His bold appointment in 1836 of the heterodox R. D. Hampden to the regius professorship of divinity at Oxford aroused a storm of controversy, against which Melbourne persisted, but his ecclesiastical appointments were thereafter less adventurous. In foreign affairs he mediated capably between cabinet Francophiles such as Lord Holland and the irrepressibly aggressive Lord Palmerston. 
After the 1837 election, which again reduced the whig majority, Melbourne's level of political activity dwindled further. Russell handled most of the complicated negotiations necessary to retain the support of the radicals. The central issues of domestic policy -- Irish and English poor laws, the penny post, education -- held no appeal for Melbourne and were also delegated to Russell. He had a little more appetite for some contentious issues that arose in colonial policy. The rehabilitation of Lord Durham, appointed governor-in-chief of British North America in January 1838, was an imaginative move -- a radical sent to suppress rebellion and at the same time lay the foundation for self-government -- although it foundered finally on the bad personal relations subsisting between governor and premier. On Canada and also on Jamaica, Melbourne had cause to criticize his colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg, but personal loyalty to this old Canningite caused him to stave off calls for his resignation until early 1839, when he finally accepted Glenelg's replacement, first by Lord Normanby and then by Lord John Russell. 
Aside from habitual inclination, the principal reason for Melbourne's progressive disengagement from politics after 1837 was his involvement in a new romance, one peculiarly justifiable as in the line of duty. The object of his affections was the young Queen Victoria. She came to the throne in June 1837, aged eighteen and unmarried, and immediately latched onto Melbourne as a mentor preferable to her domineering mother, the duchess of Kent. Melbourne, for his part, was lonely. He had been hurt by the Norton fiasco of 1836 and also, in a different way, by the death of his invalid son, Augustus, in November of the same year. He now recognized the potential for the most satisfying relationship of his life. As her subject (and a sixty-year-old one, at that) flirtation with Victoria was not in question. But he could expose all of his foibles -- his loose talk, his cynicism, his odd mannerisms, indeed his occasional outbursts of naked emotion -- without fear of reproof or ridicule from a devoted young woman, while simultaneously doing his duty as man and statesman by tutoring her in society and politics. For her part, she could depend on him totally without impropriety, and yet by virtue of her status and her own strong will never quite appear dependent or lose the power to command. Melbourne liked both her dependence and her authority: she was Caroline within safe bounds. 
Most of the attention lavished on their relationship has necessarily focused on its impact upon the monarch -- her education and character formation. Its impact upon Melbourne was greatly to increase his happiness and also to limit further his political effectiveness. Riddance of William IV, who had carped at and quarrelled with Melbourne incessantly, would have benefited any premier. But only this one would have wasted the time gained -- and more -- in 'causerie' with the queen. He acted as her private secretary and had his own bedroom at Windsor. 
In 1839 this excessive intimacy got Melbourne into two bad scrapes. Early in the year, Victoria developed the idea that two of her 'betes noires' at court -- her mother's agent, Sir John Conroy, and a tory lady-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings -- were romantically involved. When Lady Flora began to display signs of illness and a distended stomach, this idea budded into the notion of an illicit pregnancy. Melbourne's idle chatter encouraged this notion and at first he did nothing to ascertain its truthfulness. Rumour was allowed to fester and ultimately Lady Flora was submitted to a humiliating examination by the queen's doctor, Sir James Clark. Her relatives and their political allies generated much righteous indignation. Melbourne was made to seem cruelly partisan and manipulative. The affair flared up again when Lady Flora died in July -- a post-mortem revealed the 'pregnancy' to be an enormous liver tumour -- and both premier and queen were heckled in public. 
By then, however, their relationship had already plunged Melbourne into a second, more severe crisis. On 6 May enough radicals had voted against the government in a division on the government of Jamaica to bring their majority down to five. Melbourne and Russell agreed that resignation was the only recourse. Victoria was appalled. 'All, ALL my happiness gone', she keened to her journal. 'That happy peaceful life destroyed, that dearest kind Lord Melbourne no more my minister' (Ziegler, 273). Again Melbourne indulged the queen in her partisanship. He encouraged her to think she could keep her whig ladies-in-waiting and, perhaps inadvertently, gave her courage to rebuff Peel's and Wellington's requests on the composition of her court. His partiality was to the queen rather than to office; he had to be pressed by the cabinet to make a political point of the queen's wishes. The upshot of this 'bedchamber' crisis was that the whigs were kept in office. 'I will not abandon my Sovereign in a situation of difficulty and distress', Melbourne told the Lords on 14 May. Again it appeared that the elderly subject was unchivalrously manipulating the young monarch for personal gain. The radicals were brought back into line by the minor concession of a free vote on the ballot -- it lost comfortably -- and the government carried on, as it might have done anyway, had Melbourne not resigned in the first place. Further damage from this anomalous situation was prevented by arrangements for the queen's marriage to her cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. 
The loss of intimacy this marriage entailed deprived Melbourne of his last compelling reason to remain in office. Yet the circumstances of his departure were no more under his control than had been his arrival. After dealing with the royal marriage his main preoccupation in 1840 was the old one of mediating between Palmerston and Holland over relations with France. Palmerston had become the premier's brother-in-law in December 1839, when he had finally been able to wed his lover, Emily, upon Lord Cowper's demise. He was now insisting on a check to French pretensions in the Middle East, where France's client Mehmet Ali was undermining the integrity of the Ottoman empire. The threat of war with France hung over the cabinet all summer and into the autumn. Ultimately war was averted and still Mehmet Ali was contained -- a victory for Palmerston's sabre-rattling policy, though some said also for Melbourne's quiet diplomacy within the cabinet and with the French. 
At the start of 1841 Russell and the more committed whigs proposed a partial embrace of the anti-cornlaw issue as a device, if not to avert loss of office, at least to leave office on a point of liberal principle. Cabinet discussions over the 1841 budget were heated and divided over whether and how much to reduce the corn duties. The story goes that after the climactic meeting in March, Melbourne stopped his departing colleagues to ask: 'By the bye, there is one thing we haven't agreed upon, which is, what we are to say. Is it to make our corn dearer or cheaper, or to make the price steady? I don't care which: but we had better all be in the same story. (Walpole, 1.369)' True or not, the anecdote reproduces accurately Melbourne's attitude at the time; in principle opposed to reducing protection, he was in practice willing to accept his cabinet's judgement on matters of political necessity. Russell hoped to be beaten on the corn duties and to go to the country on the issue, but before it was broached Peel won a vote of no confidence on the reduction of duties on sugar. At this stage (4 June) Melbourne wanted to resign, but his colleagues were keen to have their election and forced him to dissolve parliament instead. To Melbourne's great relief, the government lost its majority in the ensuing election and he resigned at the end of August. Maintaining his reputation for probity to the end, he declined the queen's pressing offer of the Garter. 
Melbourne confessed to the queen that he had aged greatly during his last year in office. Freedom from responsibility lightened his step somewhat, though he missed his frequent meetings with the queen and regretted her new absorption in her husband. He made few moves actively to oppose Peel's government, but neither did Russell. He spent more time with the Palmerstons and resumed more frequent contact with Mrs Norton. But his temper was shorter and his manners in public more abrupt; he began finally to lose his good looks (hitherto retained despite a certain middle-aged portliness) and his sensual appearance of indulgence and self-indulgence. Then in October 1842 he was brought down by a stroke which paralysed the left side of his body. Recovery was only partial, and thereafter he was increasingly confined to Brocket, where he was cared for by his brother Fred (now Lord Beauvale) and his sister-in-law, Adine. 
Whig opposition revived gradually but Melbourne was not a participant. Yet when it looked for a moment in December 1845 as if Russell might be able to form a government, some people imagined that Melbourne might return, if only in a decorative role. Melbourne ruled himself out on the grounds that he was unsympathetic to repeal of the corn laws, but this was merely a graceful excuse. He was by now making only rare forays from home and, after a series of seizures, he died at Brocket on 24 November 1848, some months short of his seventieth birthday. He was buried in the family vault at Hatfield, near Brocket. 
Melbourne has always been more interesting to posterity as a psychological than as a political study. Able to view him safely as the product of a bygone age, even earnest Victorians retailed with relish anecdotes of his incredible carelessness and cynicism, and of his relations with Caroline, Mrs Norton, and Victoria. Many of these stories derive from Greville, who was perhaps inclined to exaggerate Melbourne's illiberalism, owing to Greville's own politics and his friendship with Melbourne's half-tory brother Fred. The general impression of political frivolousness and sexual peccadillo was then greatly reinforced by Lord David Cecil's brilliant two-volume biography (1939, 1954). In particular the first volume, 'The Young Melbourne', with its panoptic prologue on Regency high society, 'The World', gave a seductive portrait of aristocratic wit and sensuality before the dark Victorian night set in that appealed greatly to both dandies and moderns. 
Cecil's view was that Melbourne was psychologically complex but politically simple, an aristocratic amateur, and thus in the 'industrial age' a political anachronism. Little evidence was presented to complicate this portrait until Philip Ziegler's more detailed, more accurate, and better-documented political biography of 1976. Ziegler accepted much of Cecil's psychologizing -- and added new evidence relating to Lady Branden -- but hotly disputed the political conclusion, arguing that Melbourne's diplomatic and tactical skills were crucial to keeping together the whig cabinets of the 1830s and holding the middle ground between toryism and radicalism. Ziegler's revision has been supported to some extent; certainly Melbourne's aristocratic background is no longer viewed as a handicap. But Melbourne had no part in the new moral, economic, and religious thinking that allowed other aristocrats -- including his fellow Canningites, even Palmerston -- to refurbish their image as governors for a wider audience and to deal with modern problems of legislation. His peculiar noncommittal style was unique. It did allow him to play political umpire and serve as a reassuring anchor of integrity in the troubled seas of reform. But the limits to this role are underscored by L. G. Mitchell in his biography 'Lord Melbourne' (1997), which returns to the social and psychological ground broken by David Cecil. Future biographies may well follow in Cecil's and Mitchell's path, for whatever depths William Lamb may still be hiding from us are probably more of private than of public import.

Lambarde, William (1536-1601), antiquary and lawyer, was born on 18 October 1536 in the parish of St Nicholas Acons, London, the elder son of John Lambarde or Lambert (1500-1554) and his first wife, Juliana (died 1540), daughter of William Horne (died 1544), grocer of London. His father, a younger son of William Lambert of Ledbury, Herefordshire, and Alice Baker, was a warden and master of the Drapers' Company, merchant adventurer, alderman of London from 1547, and sheriff of the city in 1551-2. He purchased numerous properties in London and Southwark, the manor of Hedington, Wiltshire, and the manor of Westcombe in East Greenwich, Kent, and he secured a coat of arms on 15 July 1551. At his death on 4 August 1554 and the subsequent death of his second wife, Alice, the following 12 August, his two sons and heirs, William and Giles (1538-1581) were under age. William, the ward of Edmund Hensley, esquire, was found to be of legal age on 23 November 1557. Retaining Westcombe and some London property, he sold most of the remainder of his inheritance between 1559 and 1574 for a total of $1868. Giles, apprenticed in 1554 to his father's friend and fellow draper, John Calthorp, inherited property valued at $52 3's'. 4died per annum and became a controversial, litigious freeman of the Drapers' Company. 
Lambarde's early education is obscure. He may have been the William Lambert enrolled in 1549 at Jesus College, Cambridge, but he later stated in his 'Alphabetical Description of the Chief Places in England and Wales' (1730) that he owed more to Oxford University than to Cambridge, and he was an early donor to the library of Christ Church. On 15 August 1556 he entered Lincoln's Inn, and was named a master of the inn's revels in 1558 and a Christmas steward in 1559. A powerful case has been made that he was the William Lambert who sat for Aldborough, Yorkshire, in the two sessions of the parliament which began in 1563. This individual played a vital role in the debate on the royal succession, and in 1584 wrote an innovative treatise, 'Notes on the procedures and privileges of the House of Commons', first published anonymously in 1641. On 5 November 1566 Queen Elizabeth forestalled a petition from parliament on her marriage and the settlement of the succession by informing a delegation from the Lords and Commons that discussion of these topics should cease. On 8 November Lambarde reopened the issue in the Commons with a learned oration advocating a return to the proceedings. This action led directly to the queen's express commandment forbidding debate, Paul Wentworth's questioning of this possible breach of the liberty of free speech in the Commons, and Elizabeth's eventual, reluctant withdrawal of her prohibition. Lambarde's treatise of 1584 later identified these events as constituting an important precedent for the house, but his involvement was the direct result of his staunch protestantism and concern at the prospect of a Catholic succession, rather than abstract constitutional principle. 
Following his call to the bar on 15 June 1567, for two decades Lambarde devoted himself to county administration, his estates, and his scholarship. His first historical researches, undertaken at Lincoln's Inn with the encouragement of Lawrence Nowell and originating within the antiquarian circle of Archbishop Matthew Parker, who promoted Anglo-Saxon research as a firm foundation for the Church of England, led to the publication of 'Archaionomia' (1568), dedicated to Sir William Cordell. Only the second book to print Old English, this was a pioneering collection and paraphrase in Latin of Anglo-Saxon laws and treaties, together with laws of Edward the Confessor and William I. It was heavily dependent on Nowell's 'improved' translation of the originals and at this date some significant manuscripts like the 'Textus Roffensis' were known to neither Nowell nor Lambarde; the latter recognized this later and amended accordingly his own copies of the book, which survive in the Bodleian and Huntington libraries. However, the work was immediately highly influential, and was crucial to subsequent scholarship. Lambarde's achievement was commended by Parker and acknowledged by John Foxe, and had particular importance in an age when the definition and direction of historical studies were intimately connected to the religious and political conditions and when antiquarianism was an essential part of the search for precedent and authority in all aspects of life and thought. 
Lambarde's involvement in county administration began with his appointment in 1568 as a commissioner of sewers for Kent, where he had been acquiring small additional plots of lands for the previous five years. On 11 September 1570 he married Jane (1553-1573), eldest daughter of George Multon (1504-1588), esquire and justice of the peace of St Clere, Ightham, Kent, and Agnes Polhill (1515?-1591). Jane's dowry included the lease of St Clere manor; although she died childless on 21 September 1573, Lambarde resided there until 1583 and held the manor until 1588. It was on his marriage and move to the county, as he later explained to Sir Henry Sidney, that, having already collected some notes for a topographical dictionary, he conceived the novel idea of a systematic survey of Kent. What was in time intended as the first instalment of a historical topography of England was completed in draft in 1570, read in manuscript by Parker and Lord Burghley, and published as 'Perambulation of Kent: Containing the Description, Hystorie and Customs of that Shyre' (1576). The earliest county history, based on wide and critical reading (partly informed by Lambarde's protestant suspicion of monks and their works), it draws also on 'Domesday Book' and on royal charters, and includes in its climatic, economic, social, religious, and historical survey a short investigation of the see of Canterbury; a discussion of the local inheritance custom of gavelkind is appended. While Lambarde was uninterested in pre-Anglo-Saxon history (unlike William Camden) and exhibited no appreciation of landscape, his book 'is packed with learned information' and 'eminently readable' (McKisack, 137). The project to publish on other counties was eventually abandoned in 1585, when Lambarde learned of Camden's similar undertaking, but his interim researches were finally published as 'Dictionarium Angliae topographicum et historicum' (1730) and his marginal notations survive in the books he consulted now in the British Library, including John Price's 'Historiae Brytannicae defensio' (1573) and Alexander Neville's 'De furoribus Norfolciensium Ketto duce' (1575). 
Lambarde was put on the county commission of the peace on 6 August 1579 (sworn on 3 June 1580) and became of the quorum in 1584. For the first eight years of his service in the western division of Kent he kept a memorandum book, his 'Ephemeris', containing notes on some aspects of his work, including the issuing of recognizances for keeping the peace, the licensing of ale houses, and provision for bastards. Twenty-nine of his erudite, contemplative charges to the quarter session juries and local commissions between 1582 and 1601 survive in the Folger Shakespeare Library; they probably represent only a quarter of those he actually delivered. He praised English justice, but was sharply critical of the shortcomings of the juries, which had led government to circumvent them through such agencies as Star Chamber, and thus curtail liberty. Extolling the blessings of peace and deploring the disorders attendant on war, he showed a dislike of foreigners and inveighed, among other things, against ale houses, vagabonds, and engrossers, but he made little reference to national problems and none to felony or murder. His own activities in local government, alongside his friends and associates William Brooke, Lord Cobham, Sir Thomas Fane, Thomas Leveson, and Thomas Wotton, included the recusancy commission (not mentioned in 'Ephemeris'), the organization of musters, beacons, and markets, prerogative taxation, the stewardship of the manor of Gravesend, and the wardenship of Rochester Bridge corporation. His desire to study the historical development of every office he held led to the highly praised 'Eirenarcha, or, The Office of the Justices of Peace' (1582). Reprinted twelve times before 1620, this treatise long remained the standard authority. 
On 28 October 1583 Lambarde married his second wife, Sylvestra or Silvester (1554-1587), widow of William Dallison (died 1581) of Gray's Inn, daughter-in-law of Sir William Dallison, justice of queen's bench, and daughter and heir of Robert Deane or Dene (died 1577) of Halling, Kent, and Margaret White (died 1594). After Sylvestra's death on 1 September 1587 from complications following the birth of their twin sons, Lambarde secured the wardship of her son Maximilian Dallison (died 1631) and a lease of their Halling residence. He made a third marriage locally, on 13 April 1592, to Margaret ('b'. 1544), widow successively of John Meryam and Richard Reder (died 1582), yeoman, both of Boughton Monchelsea, and daughter of John Payne of Frittenden, yeoman. In 1598 the Lambardes moved to Westcombe. 
In his 'Ephemeris' Lambarde emphasized the rule of law as the foundation of society, 'the outward guides and masters of our lives and manners' (Lambarde, 'Ephemeris', 76). By 1591 he had completed his greatest achievement in legal history, 'Archeion, or, A discourse upon the high courts of justice in England', which although it circulated extensively in manuscript, was published by his grandson only in 1635. Here he propounded a vision of political society grounded in historically validated laws and customs. He sought to trace the two essential components of this system of government, the common law and the prerogative, to an equally distant Anglo-Saxon past. As for parliament, Lambarde wrote, 'I see not how I can derive it from any other time, than from that, in which the 'German' or 'English' did set their first foot on this 'Land', to invade it' (W. Lambarde, 'Archeion', ed. C. H. McIlwain and P. L. Ward, 1957, 126-7). For him, the establishment of a firm basis for contemporary society could only mean an appeal to the past, and his conclusions were considered valid by those who began, as he did, with a belief in the continuity of institutions which could change their name and structure but not their essential functions. The precise extent of the prerogative and of the common law was a contentious issue, and Lambarde's writings and actions revealed a consistently high opinion of the latter, although not at the expense of the essential function of the former. 
Lambarde was a consistent and vocal proponent of ethical propriety and reform in the practice of the law. His direct employment by the crown was long delayed, his career perhaps impeded by his controversial action in 1566, and employment at Westminster came only with the rise to prominence of his close friends, especially Sir Thomas Egerton. In 1589 Lambarde was made deputy to Lord Burghley as master of the alienations office of chancery, in June 1592 a master in chancery extraordinary, and in 1597 a master in ordinary and deputy keeper of the rolls (to Egerton). It was in chancery that his direct influence was most effective, especially when he acted in association with Egerton. Here he attempted to restrict the growing equity jurisdiction to justifiable causes. It was he who prepared the earliest collection of chancery precedents, the so-called Cary's reports, printed in 1650, which quickly became authoritative and had a pronounced effect on moulding court procedure. As in his treatises on the House of Commons and the office of alienations, it was the identification and codification of precedents that comprised his contribution to the establishment of theory out of past and contemporary practice. 
On 14 June 1597 Lambarde, who had been active in the Society of Antiquaries, and who on this occasion was described as 'a man of great reading, learning and experience' ('Black Books', 2.51), became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn, having been an associate bencher since 1579. In January 1601 he became keeper of the records in the Tower of London and quickly produced a historical description of the royal manuscripts, 'Pandecta rotulorum'. When he presented this to the queen, in an audience at Greenwich Palace he recounted in notes preserved among his family papers, he found Elizabeth an intelligent and appreciative recipient, who questioned him in detail over the content and its meaning. Having dispensed her equally elderly guest from the necessity of kneeling before her, she reportedly avowed that 'she had not received since her first coming to the crown any one thing that brought so great delectation unto her' and finally left him with a 'Farewell, good and honest Lambarde' (McKisack, 82). 
While in royal service Lambarde made his most sustained land purchases. Between 1593 and 1597 he paid $1760 for the Kentish properties that comprised his most significant acquisitions. Together with Westcombe they formed the basis for his family's landed estate. The earlier sales of portions of his inheritance had all been directed towards the costs of $2739 for the foundation of his model almshouse, the College of Queen Elizabeth, at East Greenwich in 1576. Later, as an executor for the estate of William Brooke, Lord Cobham (died 1597), he adopted the college's rules for use in Cobham's newly established almshouse, of which he and Thomas Leveson were the first presidents. 
Having already obtained an unparalleled reputation for learning, piety, civic virtue, and trustworthiness, Lambarde died at Westcombe at 3 a.m. on 19 August 1601, and was buried in the parish church of St Alphege, East Greenwich; his funeral monument was moved in 1710 to the Lambarde chapel in St Nicholas's Church, Sevenoaks. He had complained of diminished eyesight since 1587, and in August 1586 had told Egerton that he had been gravely sick three times in the previous three years, 'in these Dogdays and (as it were) hearde 3 peales rong for me' (Hunt. L., MS EL 39). By the terms of his will, dated 16 May 1597, the estates in Kent descended to his eldest son, Multon (1584-1634), of Lincoln's Inn; Multon was knighted in 1608 and married Jane (1594-1674), daughter of Sir Thomas Lowe, alderman and sometime lord mayor of London. Lambarde's younger sons, Fane and Gore, the twins born in 1587, were given equal life interests in the London property on attaining the age of twenty-two; both appear to have died young and childless. Their only sister, Margaret (1586-1611), received a marriage portion of $800. On 5 May 1609 she married Thomas Godfrey (1585-1664) of Kent, then gentleman servant to Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, and later sewer of the chamber to James I and father of Edmund Berry Godfrey. Lambarde's library remained at Sevenoaks until 1924, when it was dispersed by sale and bequest.

Lambart, Charles, first earl of Cavan (c.1600-1660), army officer and landowner, was the eldest son of Oliver Lambart, first Baron Lambart in the Irish peerage (died 1618), servitor in co. Cavan, and Hester, daughter of Sir William Fleetwood of Carrington Manor in Bedfordshire. He became second Baron Lambart on his father's death between 1 and 10 June 1618 and was given in wardship to his mother on 26 April 1619. The Lambarts were lineally descended from Ralph de Lambart, a soldier of fortune, who fought at Hastings in 1066. Prior to his death Oliver Lambart had sold and mortgaged the lands he had been granted in co. Cavan and elsewhere. However, in the plantation schemes for the province of Leinster in 1622 his son Charles had a grant of 1296 acres in co. Westmeath and King's county. In 1626 and 1628-9 Charles sat in the English House of Commons representing the borough of Bossiney in Cornwall. On 4 November 1634 he spoke for the first time in the Irish House of Lords, where he was to become a leading speaker. He married Jane, daughter of Richard Robartes, Lord Robartes, of Truro, and sister of the first earl of Radnor. They had a large family of whom Richard, the second earl, died a lunatic in the same year as his father. Oliver, their third son, having survived the second son, succeeded to the family estates under the terms of his father's will. The family maintained possession of their estates in Beauparc, Slane, co. Meath, until late in the nineteenth century, thereby living up to the family motto 'Ut quocunque paratus' ('Prepared on every side'). 
On 6 March 1627 Lambart was made seneschal for the government of co. Cavan and the town of Kells in co. Meath. The seneschals were established in the mid-sixteenth century in Ireland and the powers of the office included the exercise of martial law. Although intended to be a temporary expedient, the system continued late into the Tudor century to stabilize Gaelic lordships until conventional sheriffs could be appointed. Lambart's military expertise was recognized when he took over Lord Moore's infantry company on 17 May 1628. He was not, however, a provident estate manager, for in 1633 he conveyed various manors around Carrick in co. Westmeath, and Crover and Mountnugent in co. Cavan -- a few of his father's inheritances -- to a Richard Nugent. The Lambart estates suffered much on the outbreak of the 1641 Ulster rising. 
In the Irish House of Lords Lambart played a prominent part in pressing home the attack for the impeachment of Wentworth. This was a courageous action because the Irish lords were predominantly Old English. Lambart was particularly vocal on the side of the New English to back up the English House of Commons in the attack on Wentworth. His speeches in the House of Lords and his letters indicate a forthright temperament and a just and fair man devoted to the public good. His support was important constitutionally because under Poynings' law (1494) the Irish parliament could claim the right of impeachment only by claiming that English precedents were legally binding in Ireland. Wentworth had used that ancient law as a weapon against the legislature in his tyrannical government of Ireland. 
When the Ulster rising of 1641 threatened to engulf the entire country Ormond ordered Lambart to raise a regiment of foot, one of three such regiments, in November 1641. Many of his recruits were refugees from Ulster, and Richard Lambart, his brother, was appointed to a captaincy. Lambart's diplomatic skills were also now recognized when the government chose him as one of the commissioners to negotiate peace with the Ulster rebels. Their efforts failed. In the ensuing warfare that preceded Oliver Cromwell's descent on Ireland, Lambart distinguished himself as a military commander. When Sir Charles Coote left Dublin in 1642 Lambart became military governor of the city, and on receipt of the news of Coote's death he was confirmed in that post by order of council of 12 May 1642. At the same time he was appointed a privy councillor. In February 1643 he aided Ormond in the rout of the rebels at Kilsallaghan, 8 miles north of Dublin near Swords. By May 1643 his cavalry incursions into the south Dublin suburbs at Dean's Grange, Carrickmines, and north Wicklow cleared the Dublin environs of rebel activity. In the disposition of his troops for the defence of the city, Lambart's men were stationed in the streets surrounding the castle -- especially in Francis, Thomas, and Patrick streets. As a commander, Lambart inevitably clashed with the civil authorities because he often rode roughshod over the dictates of the common law in precipitate military procedures. 
Charles I sent Edward Somerset, earl of Glamorgan, as his personal envoy to Dublin to assist Ormond, but more immediately to get troops sent into England to aid the king as quickly as possible. The northern confederates distrusted Glamorgan; so too did Ormond, who had him arrested in December 1645 six months after his arrival in Ireland. Lambart then became involved in the examination of Glamorgan and may have helped to procure his release in January 1646. Throughout Ormond's peace efforts in 1646 Lambart supported him. He pointed out to him that those opposed to peace were planning an attack on Kilkenny, where the supreme council held its sessions, 'to keep moderate and well affected men from attending the assembly' (J. Lowe, ed., 'Clanricarde Letter Book', 1983, 342). He was made earl of Cavan and Viscount Kilcoursie in April 1647, but under the parliamentary army control of Ireland the royalist earl of Cavan was reduced to straitened circumstances. 
For the last decade of his life Cavan seems to have lived in comparative obscurity. He got a lease of the manors of Clontarf and Arlaine with a pension of 30's'. a week for himself and $1 for his wife, who died in 1655. Cavan died on 25 June 1660, in Dublin, and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.

Lambert, Oliver, first Baron Lambart of Cavan (c.1560-1618), soldier and administrator, was son and heir of Walter Lambert (died 1596?), alderman of Southampton, and his first wife, Rose, daughter of Sir Oliver Wallop of Farleigh Wallop, Hampshire. He was educated at Furnival's Inn and Lincoln's Inn from 1578, but became a professional soldier. He went to Ireland in the early 1580s, probably through his Wallop connection. There he served under Sir John Norris in an expedition by the lord deputy, Sir John Perrot, against the Scots in co. Antrim and co. Down in 1584, in which he was wounded; captured by two sons of Shane O'Neill on his way to Dublin in October, he was used by them as an intermediary. 
Lambert returned to England in March 1585, with recommendations to Burghley and Walsingham from both Perrot and Norris and his uncle Sir Henry Wallop. In June 1585 he received a pension of $50 per annum and in August (under the treaty of Nonsuch) he accompanied Norris to the Netherlands. There he took part in the capture of Doesburg in September 1586 and was appointed its governor by the earl of Leicester. Later, in an important offensive in the Dutch revolt, he distinguished himself in the recapture of Deventer in June 1591. In June 1592 he took part in the siege of Steenwijk, but being wounded there was sent to Ostend rather than to campaign in France, and later returned to England for a time. Early in 1596 he was sent from the Low Countries by Sir Francis Vere to the earl of Essex with a warning of a plot against the queen and a strong recommendation for employment. Accordingly, he took part in the English expedition against Cadiz in 1596, as colonel and quartermaster, and was knighted by Essex for his valour. 
In the aftermath of this expedition, and amid English fears of a Spanish response, Lambert was selected to organize defences in Hampshire, with recommendation to noblemen there, including Lord Mountjoy. His military appointments in England in 1597 and early 1598 included the superintendence of the musters in Wiltshire and the responsibility, in recognition of his knowledge and experience in martial affairs, to transfer soldiers levied in Kent to Ostend. Now, also, he was returned to parliament for Southampton and served on parliamentary committees in December 1597 and January 1598. In 1598, back in the Low Countries, he was a captain in the English garrison at Flushing and, in 1598 also, joint promoter of a minor privateering voyage conducted from Southampton. In 1598 he married Hester (1579?-1639), daughter of William Fleetwood, then receiver-general of the court of wards and later an advocate for him with Sir Robert Cecil. 
In April 1599 Lambert returned to Ireland with soldiers withdrawn from the Netherlands to support Essex's appointment and campaign there against Hugh O'Neill and his confederates. To Essex, Lambert was one of only few officers there with any substantial experience of warfare, and when Essex left Ireland prematurely in September, he left Lambert as chief commander in Leinster answerable to the earl of Ormond, and, provisionally, marshal of the camp. Acutely conscious that his association with Essex could jeopardize his new position, Lambert sought to assure it by overtures to the now-ascending Sir Robert Cecil. The ongoing war in Ireland contributed to his success in this. The privy council and the queen commended him to the new lord deputy, Mountjoy, as, unlike many, a commander of activist temperament; and, now involved in various engagements especially in Leinster, from 15 April 1600 he was sergeant-major of the army there. In the summer of 1601 Mountjoy appointed him governor of Connaught (from September, and constable of Athlone Castle from 1 October), for which office he had offered Cecil $500 in February. This was essentially a military command in that province, but he was also to act in restraint of O'Donnell should a rumoured Spanish landing in Ireland occur. His advancement, however, provoked jealousies, with another officer informing Cecil that not only was Lambert still ill-disposed towards Cecil himself but that he acted sternly and oppressively in Connaught also. After the defeat of the Spaniards and their Irish allies at Kinsale, in which he took part, Lambert suppressed the uprising in the province and was by March 1602 arguing that the instruments of civil government through the assizes and the collection of composition rents should be brought into force there again. At both Galway and Sligo in 1602 he carried out some work of fortification as precaution against a further Spanish landing. 
With the end of war in 1603 a new phase in Lambert's Irish career began. On instructions from London on 9 September, he was made a privy councillor in the Dublin government, ordered to benefit from a grant of confiscated lands of $100 annual valuation, and replaced (with a pension) in Connaught by the earl of Clanricarde. By 1606 he had built up an estate, some of it at Kilbeggan, Westmeath, where he now lived, and a house in Dublin; as an indication that he intended to build his fortune in Ireland, he sold property in Southampton in 1607. In the summer of 1606 he took part in a journey into counties Monaghan, Cavan, and Fermanagh by Lord Deputy Sir Arthur Chichester to investigate landownership, with a fee of $1 per day. After the flight of the earls in 1607, one of whom, O'Donnell, pronounced him to have been opprobrious, Lambert was sent to London to report, and returned in November with confirmation of a lease of termon lands in co. Cavan. On the outbreak of O'Doherty's rising in April 1608 he was one of those dispatched north to repress it, and in 1609 was one of the commissioners appointed to survey the escheated lands in the six Ulster counties in preparation for plantation there. In 1610 he was a commissioner to implement that plantation, and was paid for that and for a later visit to London on government business which lasted until 1611. 
Lambert benefited personally from the plantation in Ulster, receiving an estate by patent in June 1611 as a servitor in Clonmahon barony, co. Cavan. Later he got custody of O'Reilly's old castle at Cavan provided he carry out defensive building there at his own expense. When parliament was summoned in 1613, he was returned for co. Cavan amid controversial circumstances and with the native Irish freeholders protesting that he did not live in that county. The final military episode of his life was a naval one involving Scotland. Late in 1614 he was dispatched from Ireland with an expedition to retake Dunyvaig Castle on Islay which had been held as a royal fortress (under the command since 1610 of Andrew Knox, formerly bishop of the Isles and now of Raphoe) as a curb on the MacDonalds of the Isles, and which they had again recently seized. This was achieved early in February 1615, after which Lambert returned to Ireland. In April the king instructed Chichester to thank him for his success, and on 17 February 1618 Sir Oliver was created Baron Lambart of Cavan. 
Lambart died on a visit to London later that year, probably on 9 June, and was buried on 10 June in Westminster Abbey. He had two sons, Charles, who succeeded him as second baron, and Carew, the latter inheriting lands in co. Roscommon. One daughter died young and the other two married in England. By the time of his death, he had, by acquiring another grantee's estate, extended his holdings of plantation land in Cavan, rented mostly to its Irish occupiers, and had built two flankered bawns at strategic places there. His wealth lay essentially in the lands accumulated in Ireland, which were confirmed by patent to his widow and sons in 1622. By his will he provided that his two daughters should receive an inheritance of $1500 each, and made smaller bequests to others including John Wallop and Thomas Fleetwood. If he were one of the more successful English figures in the Ireland of his times, and if his career manifests the many and interlinked theatres in which England operated in that era, it demonstrates also the magnitude of the change brought about in Ireland during his lifetime.

Lambart, Richard Ford William, seventh earl of Cavan (1763-1837), army officer, born on 10 September 1763, was the only son of Richard, sixth earl (died 1788), and his second wife, Elizabeth (died 1811), eldest daughter of William Davies, a commissioner of the navy. He succeeded his father in 1778. He was appointed ensign in the Coldstream Guards on 2 April 1779, lieutenant in 1781, captain-lieutenant in 1790, captain and lieutenant-colonel on 23 August 1793, second major on 9 May 1800, and first major on 19 November 1800, having in the meantime attained major-general's rank in 1798. He was wounded at Valenciennes on 3 January 1793, and commanded a brigade in Ireland (Londonderry) in 1798-9, and in the Ferrol expedition and before Cadiz in 1800. He commanded a line brigade in Egypt in 1801, and, when General George James Ludlow was removed to a brigade of the line on 9 August, Cavan succeeded to the command of the brigade of guards. As part of Eyre Coote's division the brigade was sent to attack Alexandria from the westward. The city surrendered on 2 September 1801. When Lord Hutchinson left in October, Cavan succeeded to the command of the whole army remaining in Egypt, including the troops under David Baird. Cavan held a brigade command in the eastern counties in England during the invasion alarms of 1803-4, and in 1805 was lieutenant-general commanding in the Isle of Wight. He was a knight of the Crescent, and was one of the six officers, besides Lord Nelson, who received the diamond aigrette. He became a full general in 1814, and was in succession colonel-commandant of a 2nd battalion 68th foot, and colonel of the 2nd West Indian and 45th regiments. He was governor of Calshot Castle, Hampshire, from 1813 until his death. 
Cavan married first, on 8 July 1782, Honora Margaretta (died 1813), youngest daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Gould (1710-1794), and second on 11 August 1814, Lydia, second daughter of William Arnold of Slatswood, Isle of Wight. With his first wife he had three sons and three daughters; the only surviving son, George Frederick Augustus Lambart, Viscount Kilcoursie, predeceased his father, leaving a large family. With his second wife, who died on 7 February 1862, Cavan had three sons and a daughter. He died at Stanhope Place, Hyde Park, on 21 November 1837, and was succeeded by his grandson.

Lambe, John (1545/6-1628), astrologer, of unknown parentage, probably originated in Worcestershire. According to his own later evidence he was first a teacher of reading and writing in English to the families of gentry. Without any training he began to practise medicine, assuming the title of 'doctor', then took up fortune telling. He was arrested in 1608, the charges being that during the previous December, at Tardebigge, Worcestershire, he attempted to disable or sap the strength of Thomas, sixth Lord Windsor, and in May 1608, at nearby Hindlip, he invoked evil spirits. Lambe was held in Worcester Castle, where he contrived to demonstrate his skill and powers to his many visitors. At his trial judgment was suspended on the first charge and stayed on the second. 
Within two weeks of Lambe's trial some forty people, including sheriffs, justices, and others who had been present in court, died. The true cause was probably gaol fever, carried by an infected prisoner into the court, but a petition was raised for Lambe's transfer, and he was moved to London's king's bench prison. There he lived in some comfort in two rooms, with servants. He employed laundresses, who worked partly in his rooms and found their custom in the surrounding district. He continued to receive visitors and to practise as before, and during this period he met and became a protege of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham and favourite of James I. 
This comfortable if confined life was brought to an end on 16 June 1623 when Lambe, then aged seventy-seven, was indicted for the rape of Joan Seger, a girl of eleven who had been sent to his rooms at the prison with a basket of herbs. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang, but was first questioned by James Ley, lord chief justice. Details of Lambe's early life emerged from Ley's report to the secretary of state summarizing Lambe's evidence and defence. Ley found that the girl's father owed Lambe money, and that the charge of rape had only been laid some weeks later when Lambe tried to recover this debt. Ley decided that on the evidence the rape charge was not proved and on 4 June 1624 Lambe was pardoned and released. He then rented a house near parliament, where he lived for over a year. 
Lambe's relationship with the hated Buckingham and his supposed magical powers on Buckingham's behalf were common knowledge, which was why the mob continuously watched him. On 12 June 1626 a freak storm caused a mist to rise from the Thames near to York House, Buckingham's residence. 'This occasioned the more discourse among the vulgar, in that Dr Lamb appeared there upon the Thames, to whose Art of Conjuring they attributed that which had happened' (Rushworth, 391). Buckingham's mother consulted Lambe about her son's fate; he showed her in a glass the figure of a big fat man with a long dagger, who would kill her son. Lambe was cited as a lover and supplier of charms to Lady Purbeck, Buckingham's sister-in-law. Charges of sorcery and adultery in that matter, made in November 1627, were later dropped, but in December he was again imprisoned, for inducing a Westminster scholar 'to give himself to the Devil' (Birch, 252). 
For some time Lambe had claimed that he had been licensed to practise as a physician by the bishop of Durham. However, on 18 December 1627 he was examined by the College of Physicians of London and found to be ignorant of the language and practice of medicine. His plea was that he just pretended to examine and treat people, in order to acquire a little money. 
On Friday 13 June 1628 Lambe went to the Fortune Theatre, a popular haunt of the lower classes. He was recognized by some lads, who waited outside for him and then followed him, attracting thereby a larger gathering; Lambe's reaction was to hire some sailors to act as a bodyguard. They kept the crowd at bay while he supped at the Horseshoe tavern off Moor Lane. He then entered the City at Moorgate, followed by a now hostile crowd who pelted him with stones. He took shelter in the Windmill tavern, at which the crowd took vengeance on his bodyguard. The tavern keeper, fearful for his own safety, forced Lambe to leave; he managed to sneak out unseen and find refuge in a nearby house, but was discovered by the mob and again ejected. Emerging on the street, he was surrounded, and stoned and clubbed into unconsciousness. He was carried into a compter (a small lockup) in the Poultry, where he died early on 14 June. In his pockets were found a crystal ball, knives, pictures, a gold nightcap, and 40 shillings. He was buried the next day in the churchyard of St Mildred Poultry. Buckingham was stabbed to death two months later. 
No one was ever brought to trial for Lambe's killing. The City authorities were severally admonished for failing to prevent his death and find his killers, and in 1632 the king's bench imposed a fine of $1000 on them, which was raised by a levy on the City companies. In September or October 1628 there appeared 'A briefe description of the notorious life of Iohn Lambe, otherwise called Doctor Lambe. Together with his ignominious death'. Supposedly published in Amsterdam, it bore no author's or printer's name; it was, however, printed in London, and was followed by many broadsheets and ballads commemorating a strange life and a horrific death.

Lambe, Sir John (c.1566-1646), civil lawyer, was the first of four children of John Lambe of Northampton and Elizabeth Aylett. He matriculated in 1583 from St John's College, Cambridge, where a novel conformist divinity was developing, and graduated BA in 1587. He then made a pilgrimage to Rome, returning to proceed MA in 1590. His ruthlessly ambitious career began in the Peterborough diocesan courts in 1590, and from 1603 until 1628 he held the office of registrar. By 1607 he was married either to Anne Crompton (died 1624) or to an unknown first wife; he and Anne had two daughters (born in 1619 and 1621), one of whom, Barbara, married Basil Feilding, later earl of Denbigh. 
In Northampton Lambe joined an embattled faction of avant-garde conformists led by John Buckeridge, Richard Butler (a close university friend), and David Owen, whose outlook was characterized by political absolutism, rabid anti-puritanism, anti-sabbatarianism, and an insistence on full ceremonial conformity. Thus in 1604 Lambe wrote to another university friend, Richard Neile, describing the anti-papist panic in Northampton following the recent clerical deprivations for nonconformity as a puritan threat to social order. He lodged with Butler at Spratton from 1605. During 1606 there commenced legal disputes with Lewis Tresham over land at Rothwell and with Jerome Lowe, who had violently interfered with Lambe's collection of tithes from the leased rectory of Yardley Hastings. As a result of the latter, Lambe and his wife were lampooned as papist sympathizers in satirical poems circulating among his puritan enemies around Northampton. In retaliation Lambe in 1607 brought proceedings against his opponents in the Star Chamber by raising, in a letter to James I, the spectre of a popular puritan threat to monarchy in the wake of the midland revolt. After 1608 he moved back to Northampton and at some time before 1615 lived at Tower Close. From 1611 until 1617 Lambe was the surrogate of Christopher Wyvell, the chancellor of Lincoln diocese, and there became associated with John Williams, to whose patronage, according to Williams's biographer, John Hacket, Lambe, who allegedly possessed the mien of a prize-fighter, owed his rise to power. 
Between 1615 and 1629 Lambe was chancellor of Peterborough diocese, and supported a clique of like-minded clergymen whom he appointed his surrogates in the church courts -- the most zealous being Robert Sibthorpe (his brother-in-law), David Owen, and Samuel Clarke. Lambe now tried to turn the Calvinist evangelical Jacobean church in a conformist direction. The county town bore the brunt of their campaign: ceremonial conformity, particularly lay reception of the communion kneeling, was enforced with a severity and a contempt for puritan equivocation almost unknown in the Jacobean church; the godly practices of holding prayer meetings and gadding to sermons were proscribed, and an abortive attempt was made to enforce the anti-sabbatarian 'Book of Sports' (1618) and the observance of various holy days. In 1616, when his puritan enemies in Northampton and Sir Edward Montague retaliated by bringing articles to Judge Sir Edward Coke's attention charging him with persecuting them in the church courts, Williams persuaded Cambridge University to award Lambe an LLD. This made him eligible for the commissaryship of the archdeaconry of Leicester to which Neile, now bishop of Lincoln, appointed him in 1617. From 1619 until 1640 Lambe served as a JP for Northamptonshire: in 1620 he moved to Rothwell. When his Northampton opponents sought redress for a second time from the 1621 parliament, Williams, now lord keeper, again saved him -- Lambe's letter to James I describing a puritan conspiracy to undermine royal authority -- by securing a knighthood which was conferred on 26 July 1621 at Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire. The king appointed him the same year to the court of delegates. When Archbishop Abbot accidentally killed a gamekeeper Williams recommended that the duke of Buckingham seek legal advice from Lambe on how to proceed. After 1624 Lambe married Elizabeth Kimbould; there were no children of this union, and she predeceased him. A quarrel arose in 1626 over the registrarship of the archdeaconry of Leicester, Lambe backing his subordinate, Henry Allein, against John Pregion. In an emergent split from Williams, Lambe's party accused the now bishop of Lincoln of stymieing a high commission investigation into Leicester puritanism. Allein (backed by Lambe and Sibthorpe) in 1627 charged Pregion with leniency towards, and sympathy with, puritans. Williams rejected the case, and when Allein appealed to the privy council in 1628 Lambe and Sibthorpe gave evidence against Williams. But unlike his erstwhile patron, Lambe was secure in royal favour: appointed a high commissioner in 1629 he obtained through Neile a royal pardon for Sibthorpe's defence of the royal prerogative ('Apostolike Obedience'), which the parliament of that year condemned. Examined by parliament, Lambe was saved by the dissolution. Williams's attempts to oust Lambe from his own Leicester office and replace him with his secretary, Walter Walker, led to a verdict for Walker in the court of king's bench, whose judge, Sir James Whitelocke, claimed Lambe had given 'the greatest affront to the Court that ever was' (Slatter, 55), but Lambe in 1632 persuaded Charles I to issue a royal command halting proceedings at common law. The matter had become part of the continuing Laud / Williams rivalry which climaxed in the latter's suspension from office. 
Promoted to dean of the court of arches by his ally Archbishop William Laud in 1633, Lambe enforced as zealously as anyone the conformist policies he had so long preferred. In 1634 he advocated Laud's right to visit the diocese of Lincoln when Williams proved obstructive, and provided legal advice to Sir Thomas Wentworth on the Irish church. Lambe blocked the appeals of provincial parishes against Laudian policies, as in the cases of the churchwardens of All Saints (Northampton) and Upton, who were punished by Sibthorpe and Clarke for opposition to the altar policy: puritan scruples were condemned as seditious. As a high commissioner Lambe participated in the highest profile prosecutions of the personal rule, including those of Henry Burton, John Bastwick, William Prynne, Peter Smart, John Lilburne, and Sir Robert Howard. According to Laud at his trial, Lambe disobeyed the archbishop's order in 1638 to suppress John Cowell's absolutist work 'The Interpreter'. He reinforced the actions of his Peterborough subordinates by prosecuting Miles Burkit for opposing the altar policy and Sir Richard Samwell for aiding him. The puritan prayer meetings of several Northamptonshire JPs were also targeted. By 1635, as commissary for the archdeaconry of Buckingham, he punished leaders of opposition to the 'Book of Sports', while in Leicester archdeaconry he enforced the strictest Laudian altar policy. Lambe was a leading promoter of Laud's metropolitical visitation in Lincoln and Peterborough dioceses, accompanied the archbishop on his visitation of St Paul's Cathedral, successfully upheld the archbishop's right to visit Oxford University, and personally acted as visitor of Merton College. As one of the visitors of Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire archdeaconry, Lambe ordered the raising of an annual levy to support a church organ and organist. He intervened repeatedly in Sibthorpe's many local disputes and shared the view that opposition to the prerogative tax of ship money was the result of puritan sedition. Lambe also brought Sibthorpe's defence of George Plowright against impressment for the bishops' war to the attention of the privy council, where the verdict went against Sibthorpe. 
At the zenith of his fortunes Lambe was chancellor to Queen Henrietta Maria from 26 January 1640 until 1642, and played a leading role in convocation's framing of new ecclesiastical canons. In August 1640 he detected a group of London clergy meeting to oppose the 'etcetera oath' and proceeded in arches against clergy meeting at Kettering, who refused to swear the oath as illegal and sympathized with Scottish propaganda in the bishops' war. Lambe shared Sibthorpe's view that the conflict was the culmination of a puritan plot to subvert church and state. A flurry of petitions of grievance led in 1641 to his being sent for as a delinquent by the Long Parliament, which declared illegal many of the verdicts in which he had participated, fined him heavily, and sequestrated his property. Parliament even considered impeaching him; scurrilous pamphlet literature and cartoons linked him closely with the archbishop. By 1642 church court activity had ceased. Lambe was named in the commission of array for Northamptonshire, and after the outbreak of civil war he fled to royalist headquarters at Oxford in 1643, was incorporated as a member of the university on 9 December, and remained until the surrender in 1646. On his return to London to compound for his estates he died intestate (leaving a fortune reputedly valued at $5000), probably at The Bell inn, Carter Lane, and was buried at the church of St Andrew by the Wardrobe, London, on 21 November 1646.

Lambe, Robert (bap. 1711, d. 1795), Church of England clergyman and antiquary, was baptized at St Nicholas's Church, Durham, on 15 August 1711, the son of John Lambe, mercer, of Durham. He was educated at Durham grammar school and at St John's College, Cambridge, whence he matriculated in 1728 and graduated BA in 1734. He was ordained deacon at Lincoln on 23 September 1733 and priest at Norwich in October 1735, whereupon he was appointed a minor canon of Durham Cathedral. In 1747 he obtained the curacy of South Shields and a few weeks later received the living of Norham, Northumberland, which had become vacant. He remained at Norham for the rest of his life and married there, on 11 April 1755, Philadelphia Nelson (died 1772), the daughter of a Durham carrier. According to James Raine's account of his courtship Lambe had seen her only once, many years before he suddenly decided to propose. In his proposal letter he invited her to meet him on Berwick pier and asked her to carry a tea caddy so that he could identify her; he then absent-mindedly failed to meet her on the appointed day but none the less his suit was successful. The couple had a daughter, Philadelphia ('b'. 1756), who married Alexander Robertson of Berwick, and two sons, Robert (1759-1771), and Ralph, who died in infancy in 1764. 
Lambe's publications reflect his wide-ranging historical interests; the first was 'The History of Chess' (1764; 2nd edn, 1765). His principal work, 'An Exact and Circumstantial History of the Battle of Flodden' (1774), appears to have been based on Thomas Gent's edition of a manuscript belonging to John Askew of Pallinsburn, Northumberland, and was embellished with Lambe's notes, which, he claimed, recorded authentic historical events. However, stories such as his description of St Cuthbert's body floating down the Tweed in a stone coffin were the product of his mischievous imagination. Likewise he maintained that his poem 'The Laidley Worm of Spindleston Heugh' was translated from a song composed by a mystical bard living in the Cheviots in the thirteenth century. This hoax fooled William Hutchinson, who included the poem in his history of Northumberland, and some of Lambe's purported archaeological discoveries were also practical jokes intended to catch out his fellow antiquaries. 
Lambe died at Edinburgh on 7 May 1795 and was buried in Eyemouth churchyard, Berwickshire. His wife, who had predeceased him, had been buried at Gilligate, Durham, on 13 January 1772.

Lamb, Thomas (d. 1686), linen draper and philanthropist, was for many years confused with a namesake, a soap-boiler by trade: remarkably, both men were prominent General Baptists. The overwhelming evidence that they were not the same individual includes a petition subscribed in 1656 by two London Baptist congregations, each in fellowship with a different Thomas Lamb. The soap-boiler was to stay with the Baptists for the rest of his life, but the linen draper soon abandoned them. This was neither his first nor his last change of judgement about the nature of the church. 
We first hear of Lamb in 1641, when he was listed in the poll tax returns for London as a freeman of the Leathersellers' Company, trading at the premises of the liveryman leatherseller Henry Heald of Gracechurch Street. The following year he invested $50 in the Irish Adventurers; later, he was involved in exporting cloths to France and acquired interests in the excise farm. He was a member of the church gathered in the London parish of St Stephen's, Coleman Street, by John Goodwin. For some time, during the civil war, Lamb kept the company of William Walwyn. They sampled the wide range of sermons then available in London and debated the issues which now divided the parliamentarian camp. In matters both of church government and of civil politics the gathered, or 'independent', churches, and not least that of John Goodwin, were exerting great influence in London and aroused the hostility of the presbyterian ministers. But by 1646-7 there had crystallized a Leveller current, whose spokesmen, including and especially Walwyn, attacked the Independents from the left. Thomas Lamb was saddened by his criticism of Goodwin's writings, and the two men became estranged. 
Lamb remained in the Coleman Street church and became one of its elders; in 1651 he composed one of the hymns of thanksgiving sung by the congregation after the battle of Worcester. This work is not of the highest poetic quality, but it is still of interest. At once pious, patriotic, and radical, Lamb rejoiced that God had frustrated the designs of the defeated royalist 'princes and great men': '
He crusht their rage and cruelty 

The proud which did advance; 

The wicked he hath now brought low, 

And trodden down their place... 

Oh ye sons, ye saints of God, 

What say you to this sight, 

Shall not the goodness of your God 

Be greatly your delight? 
(Goodwin, 'Hymns', 8-10)' Lamb formed a lasting friendship with another prominent member of Goodwin's church, the merchant William Allen (who must also be distinguished from a namesake, the adjutant-general). In 1653 Allen, influenced by the former clergyman and future Quaker Samuel Fisher, was converted to the cause of anti-paedobaptism. Thomas Lamb soon followed suit, and after briefly espousing mixed communion the two men led twenty of Goodwin's members out of his congregation. Despite protestations of mutual respect, an unbrotherly exchange of pamphlet-fire followed. Lamb's contribution was 'Truth Prevailing Against the Fiercest Opposition' (1655), an attack upon Goodwin's 'Water Dipping No Firm Footing for Church-Communion' (1653); other salvoes were released by Allen, a more dedicated and effective controversialist than his friend, and, for Goodwin, by John Price. 
Lamb and Allen had shared in John Goodwin's Arminianism, and this helps explain why it was to the General Baptists that they now attached themselves. More was involved than a shift from one set of church ordinances to another. Goodwin's congregation was wealthy and sophisticated, and its former members seem initially to have sought fellowship with another which might match 'such means of Edification as they had left' (Sylvester, appx 3.51). This, however, could not be found, and a new congregation was gathered in Lothbury. Lamb and Allen were able to attend an intercongregational meeting of General Baptist churches in London, signing as elders its resolution, 'The Humble Representation and Vindication' (1654). This document noted the religious freedom which the protectorate seemed to promise, and urged local churches not to be drawn into agitation against it. But Lamb's congregation was one of several which protested at the imprisonment in 1655 of John Biddle, whose unorthodox Christological views were attracting some General Baptists. 
In 1656 a second intercongregational meeting passed a resolution condemning mixed marriages. Lamb did not sign this, perhaps partly because within the churches of his new faith there were few potential partners whose social position matched that of his unmarried daughters. But principles were also involved. Hostility to mixed marriages was part of a larger trend within General Baptism towards the erection of barriers between the saints and the profane world. Lamb was provoked to a wider questioning of the road he had chosen. He reread works by such men as Richard Baxter and his old pastor John Goodwin, and began to waver once more on the issue of baptism. 
By 1658, Thomas Lamb had become deeply concerned about the whole basis of his religious communion. At this point his wife, Barbara, played a vital role -- perhaps not for the first time, for John Goodwin charged that 'a female head' had engineered the schism of 1653 (J. Goodwin, 'Triumveri', 1658, preface, section 4). She certainly initiated the correspondence which led to the prodigal's return. On 12 August 1658 Barbara wrote secretly to Richard Baxter, revealing her husband's inner turmoil. Conversations with the presbyterian Thomas Manton and with the presbyterian and future bishop Edward Reynolds, she reported, had strengthened his growing sense that he had been mistaken in opting for a narrow communion. Lamb could no longer keep silent about his doubts. As a result, the congregation which looked to him for leadership, now 120 strong, 'grow offended and disturbed' (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.325). Barbara Lamb grasped well the main lines of her husband's difficulties. In choosing Baxter as confidant, she also showed her understanding of the means to resolve them. Concern was growing at this time for a more settled accommodation between the godly of several persuasions. Richard Baxter was a veteran campaigner in this cause. When Lamb wrote to him in September, Baxter simply encouraged him to explore further the logic of his own development. Once more, William Allen seems to have travelled the same road as his friend, and the two may well have exerted reciprocal influence. Both men now found that they had erred in rejecting the operational significance for Christians of the concept of the universal church. Gently encouraged by Baxter, Lamb and Allen now began to canvas among their Baptist friends the merits of open communion with the unbaptized. 
In the pursuit of this goal, Lamb's early candour undermined his credit with his church. For a while, his colleague William Allen was listened to with more sympathy, and they succeeded in involving other leading Baptists in discussions. But most members were unalterably opposed to opening their communion, and the larger drive towards accommodation with religious moderates foundered when the end of the protectorate brought to the radicals sweeping, if ephemeral, gains in influence. By January 1659 Lamb had already resumed his attendance at Goodwin's lectures. Acutely aware of the poverty of his congregation, he hesitated to abandon it, and vowed to stay until midsummer. But his authority in Lothbury was already fatally undermined. He was forced to listen to the 'Reproaches of my dear friends that pour contempt upon me daily, as a most dreadful Apostate, a Judas' (T. Lamb to R. Baxter, 15 Jan 1659, Sylvester, appx 3.64). The hostile reception accorded to his ideas probably deepened Lamb's estrangement from his church and its democratic habits, for he became 'clog'd with scruples about popular government' (ibid., 65). Half the congregation now boycotted his services, and steps were taken to subject him to disciplinary proceedings. In April Lamb resigned, and soon repudiated as schismatic not only his second baptism but also religious Independency itself: this, he now thought, was incorrigibly opposed to the universal church. By early July, reported William Allen, Lamb had begun to see as schismatic the Reformation itself; shortly after, he stayed with Baxter at Kidderminster, and it may be that the veteran controversialist was able to help his unstable visitor renew his confidence in the foundations of protestantism. (Baxter, however, explicitly stated that he was not responsible for the abandonment by Lamb and Allen of their belief in believers' baptism.) 
After the Restoration, Lamb penned two books against the Independent religion, including 'A Fresh Suit Against Independency' (1677), which was honest enough to recall his own youthful errors, and which paid tribute to his friend William Allen, now dead. He was probably resident, during these years, at a house, mentioned in his will, at St Bartholomew's Close; it was from St Bartholomew-the-Great that Barbara Lamb had appealed to Baxter. The 'Mr Lamb of Bell Alley, Coleman Street' listed in 1677 as a London merchant may very well be our man, since our main source for his later life is Richard Lucas, vicar of Coleman Street. The reference is probably to Lamb's business address. He must certainly have prospered in his trade, for he was elected master of the Leathersellers' Company in 1673-4. Many years before, the impoverishment of his Baptist brethren had troubled Lamb's conscience. Troubling memories and present prosperity may each have sharpened his awareness of poverty. At any rate, philanthropy became his consuming interest: 'continually thronged by flocks' of impoverished clients, 'several hundred prisoners, were by him, with great travail and expense set free' (Lucas, 20, 19). So recalled Lucas, who preached the sermon at Lamb's funeral on 23 July 1686, dedicating the published account to his eldest son, John Lamb (1649/50-1708), the vicar of Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire. Barbara Lamb, 'an extraordinary intelligent woman' as Richard Baxter remembered her (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.323), had died, probably shortly before her husband.

Lambe, William (d. 1580), philanthropist, was the son of a lesser gentleman of Sutton Valence in Kent. A man about whom, had it not been for his acts of philanthropy, little at all would have been known, his charity was celebrated in a posthumous life by Abraham Fleming, the compiler of Holinshed's chronicles, who in fashioning him as an exemplar of protestant piety made sure that his reputation endured. According to his biographer, Lambe 'hath bene seene and marked at Powles crosse to have continued from eight of the clock until eleven, attentively listening to the Preachers voice, and to have endured the ende, being weake and aged, when others both strong and lustie went away. (Fleming)' It was also reported that during his last illness he was visited by Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's, and by John Foxe the martyrologist. Lambe was apparently the author of his own book of prayers, 'The Conduit of Comfort' (1579), but it was probably ghost written by Fleming. The preamble to his will seems to breathe the spirit of the godly, as he looked forward to being accepted as 'one of the children of Abraham' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/62, fol. 157). But Fleming felt it necessary to defend Lambe against 'privie whisperings' that he was a papist sympathizer, and there is no doubt that he had moved in a much more conservative milieu in his early life. 
Stow describes Lambe as a gentleman of the royal chapel under Henry VIII (Stow, 1.316), but it would be more accurate to say that he had held a post in the chapel vestry, for which there is evidence from the chapel lists of 1520 and 1524. The men of the vestry were responsible for looking after the chapel accoutrements and plate. Lambe's friendships towards the end of his life, both with establishment figures such as Alderman Rowland Heyward and with the much more conservative master of the rolls, Sir William Cordell (the latter two being his executors), suggest that like many of his generation he stood precariously between two worlds. Although prosperous, he was never a tycoon -- his subsidy assessments of $100 in 1541 and $50 in 1577 placing him among the top 700 to 800 citizens, but at the bottom of that group. He had dabbled in monastic lands, and in 1543 bought a package of metropolitan properties formerly belonging to the foundations of Rowley, St John Jerusalem, and St Bartholomew, Smithfield. He resided from 1541 in a property in Mugwell (or Monkwell) Street, adjacent to the former hermitage chapel of St James at London Wall. 
The acquisition of property brought its inevitable tensions with the principles of charity, so that even this paragon, who during his lifetime is supposed to have distributed moneys anonymously among the poor of St Giles Cripplegate, was cast as one of the social villains of the metropolis when required by the court of aldermen in February 1574 to enter a recognizance not to take more poor tenants into his 'pestered' alley in Cripplegate. Lambe's close friendship with Heyward explains his entry to the Clothworkers' Company by redemption in 1568 at an unusually advanced age, and his evident willingness to vest the company with responsibility for the management of his charities perhaps explains the extraordinary step that they took in electing him to the mastership in 1569 after a very brief association with their guild. Lambe's willingness to participate in civic administration is confirmed by his service on the court of governors of Christ's Hospital from 1571 to 1579. 
In spite of having married three times (the identity of his wives is unknown apart from their forenames, Joan, Alice, and Joan), Lambe was childless, and it was this circumstance which encouraged his philanthropy. Among the major projects he undertook during his lifetime was the foundation of almshouses at Sutton Valence in Kent in 1574, followed by a grammar school there in 1576, and the building of Holborn conduit (the latter at a cost of $1500) in 1577. The Clothworkers, who administered the Sutton Valence charities, were also the recipients of properties in the parishes of St Stephen, Coleman Street, and St Olave, Silver Street, together with the chapel of St James on London Wall, the former hermitage of the abbey of Gerendon in Leicestershire. In return the company were instructed to see that sermons were preached in the chapel four times a year and that a chaplain say divine service three times a week, as well as providing clothing each year for twelve poor men and twelve poor women, and an annuity to the poor of the parish of St Faith. Lambe's charity had its sharp edge: while requiring that his servants be kept for up to six months after his death, he nevertheless insisted that they should be treated in this way only if 'they repair to church and sermons and spend their time in other godly exercises' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/62, fol. 157). He died on 21 April 1580 and was buried in a vault under a tomb he had already constructed in the parish church of St Faith under St Paul's.

Lambe, William (1765-1847), physician and vegetarian, one of the four children of Lacon Lambe, an attorney, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Berington and sister of the Catholic divine Joseph Berington (1746-1827), was born in St Peter's parish, Hereford, on 26 February 1765. He was educated at Hereford grammar school and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1786, MB in 1789, and MD in 1802. He became a fellow of his college on 11 March 1788. 
In 1794 Lambe married Harriet Mary (died 1804), daughter of Captain John Walsh. They had six children: Harriet ('b'. 1794); Mary ('b'. 1796), who married the lawyer Saxe Bannister (1790-1877); Lacon William (1797-1871), who became a physician; Anne ('b'. 1800); Augusta ('b'. 1801); and Elizabeth (died 1804). After his wife's death from scarlet fever Lambe married in 1809 Sophia Ann ('c'.1772-1815), daughter of Arthur Saunders, a physician; they had a daughter, Catherine (1810-1860). 
Following his marriage in 1794, Lambe gave up his fellowship at Cambridge and moved to Warwick, where he succeeded to the practice of a friend, Walter Landor (father of the poet Walter Savage Landor). Here he also became friendly with Samuel Parr and William Roughead, and he soon published his analyses of the Leamington spring water. The results of further chemical examination of these waters were published by him in the 'Transactions' of the Philosophical Society of Manchester and formed the basis of several later books. 
Lambe moved to London shortly after 1803, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1804. He held both the censorship and Croonian lectureship on several occasions between 1806 and 1828, and he was Harveian orator in 1818. His London practice was neither very large nor remunerative. Lambe lived in Kentish Town, but kept a consulting room in 2 King's Road (later 14 Theobald's Road), Bedford Row, where he attended his patients three times a week. Many of them were poor people, from whom he would accept no fees. He also taught botany at the Aldersgate Street school of medicine, and was appointed physician to its dispensary in 1810. 
Lambe's ill health led him to become a vegetarian at the age of forty-one. He also preferred to drink only distilled water. In 1813 he wrote that his only regret about such a regimen was that it had not been adopted much earlier in his life (Wyndham, 9). He published 'A medical and experimental enquiry into the origin, symptoms, and cure of constitutional diseases' (1805) and 'Reports of the effects of a peculiar regimen on schirrhous tumours and cancerous ulcers' (1809). Lambe's ideas were supported by Shelley, with whom, along with Keats, he was acquainted. Later in life Lambe became somewhat rigid in his vegetarianism. It is said that 'he carried his convictions about vegetable diet to such an extent that it well-nigh became a religious belief and he its despotic high priest' (ibid., 23). One of Lambe's grandsons later recalled: 'the old man's sudden appearance at the garden gate while the family were breakfasting off (among other things), a ham, great commotion was caused, the ham being thrust into a cupboard and all stray pieces heaped on the plate of a carnivorous governess, who, being ignorant of the reason, looked on in bewildered amazement. (Wyndham, 24)' Shelley's biographer, Jefferson Hogg, wrote that the last time he met Lambe 'he told me he had breakfasted on one cauliflower and was just about to dine on another' (Wyndham, 27). 
Lambe retired from practice about 1840, and died at Henwood, Dilwyn, Herefordshire, on 11 June 1847. He was buried in the family vault in the churchyard of that parish.

Lambert, Aylmer Bourke (1761-1842), botanist, was born on 2 February 1761 at Bath, the only son of Edmund Lambert (died 1802), landowner, of Boyton House, Wiltshire, and his first wife, the Hon. Bridget Bourke (died 1773), daughter and heir of John Bourke, eighth Viscount Mayo. As a child he began to collect objects to form a little museum, and amassing botanical collections, together with horticulture, became a lifelong obsession. He was educated at Newsome's School in Hackney but spent his holidays at Hanford, Dorset, with Henry Seymer (1714-1785), brother of his father's second wife, a keen naturalist and gardener. Through Seymer, young Lambert came to know Richard Pulteney (1730-1801), the botanical historian, and Margaret, dowager duchess of Portland (1715-1785), likewise a botanist and gardener. 
In January 1779 Lambert entered St Mary Hall, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner. However, although he became well acquainted with the Oxford botanists Daniel Lyons (1762-1834) and John Sibthorp (1758-1796) and continued to develop his interests in the subject, he left Oxford in 1782 without taking a degree. In December that year he married a young widow, Catherine Webster, 'nee' Bowater (died 1828), whose gracious hospitality and charm endeared her to Lambert's many botanical friends. Among these were Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820) and James Edward Smith (1759-1828). 
When Smith, together with Samuel Goodenough (1743-1827) and Thomas Marsham (died 1819), founded the Linnean Society of London in 1788, Lambert became a member and was appointed a vice-president in 1796. (At his death in 1842 he was the last remaining original member.) He contributed to the society's 'Transactions' a few small papers. 
A keen field botanist, Lambert formed a herbarium of British and Irish plants. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1791. Interested in many branches of natural history, in 1829 he joined the Wiltshire historian Sir Richard Colt Hoare (1738-1838) in the excavation of tumuli, subsequently becoming a member of the Society of Antiquaries. Near Boyton he found, for the first time in Britain, 'Cirsium tuberosum' ('Cnicus tuberosus'), a rare species of thistle. 
In 1789 Lambert went to Connaught in Ireland and in 1790 he did much botanizing in Mayo. There he met the ailing veteran Irish botanist Patrick Browne (1730-1790), who gave him his list of plants of Mayo and Galway. Lambert ultimately gave the list to Smith, but it remained unpublished until 1995. In 1797 Lambert published 'A Description of the Genus Cinchona' but he was already planning a grand folio book on conifers, 'A Description of the Genus Pinus', with engraved plates drawn by Ferdinand Bauer (1760-1826), among the finest (and most expensive) conifer illustrations ever produced. The latter was published in seven parts between 1803 and 1807 in a manner so irregular that copies vary in contents; a plain copy cost 10 guineas, a coloured one 40 guineas. A second volume, largely the work of Lambert's herbarium curator and librarian, David Don (1799-1841), was published in 1824. A second edition, published between 1828 and 1837, included conifers other than 'Pinus', together with an account of Lambert's herbarium by Don. The variation between copies, indicative of Lambert's lack of control over their issue, has made the work, Lambert's major claim to botanical fame, a bibliographer's nightmare. 
On his father's death in 1802 Lambert became a wealthy man of leisure, owning Boyton House (the family property since 1527) and houses in Salisbury and London. He also received income from sugar plantations in Jamaica and estates in England and Ireland. Year by year he acquired, both by gift and by lavish purchases, many collections of dried plants (herbaria). However, he did not organize these into one scientific sequence for research purposes -- as Banks, Hooker, Lindley, and Bentham did -- but merely kept them as separate lots, which made their consultation difficult and led ultimately to their sale and disastrous dispersal in 1842. Yet Lambert did make his collections freely available for study by others, particularly foreign visitors such as Augustin Pyramus de Candolle (1778-1841). He was overjoyed when such visitors found species new to science within the herberia. David Don, especially, based accounts of genera on the specimens under his care, as also did his brother George Don (1798-1856) in his 'A General System of Gardening and Botany' (1831-8). 
Lambert, a genial and generous (if eccentric) man, needed and enjoyed the intellectual support and friendship of strong-willed botanists such as Banks, Smith, David Don, and William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865). Of these, only Hooker survived during Lambert's last years. Towards the end, Lambert's income greatly diminished but his expenditure did not. His financial and domestic affairs became chaotic, his debts staggering. Ill health and family disputes marred the end of his life. He died on 10 January 1842 at Kew and was buried in the church at Boyton House. 
Lambert's will directed that his herbarium should be offered to the British Museum provided the trustees paid his debts, apparently amounting to $2500 even after sale of his London house, botanical library (comprising 689 items), and paintings. This the trustees declined to do. As a result, his botanical acquisitions, described at the time as being in a state of great confusion, were dispersed in three days (27-29 June 1842) by auction. A detailed study of the history and subsequent whereabouts of Lambert's collection ('Taxon', 19, 1970, 489-656) showed that it had been widely dispersed. Portions of the collection were preserved at Cambridge, Geneva, Florence, Kew, Oxford, and Philadelphia; the part which had gone to Berlin was destroyed in the Second World War. It was a sad end to Lambert's ambition and efforts, and a disaster to botany through the scattering of type-specimens. The generic name 'Lambertia' Smith commemorates him.
