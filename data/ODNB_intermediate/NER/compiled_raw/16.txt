Brendan of Clonfert (d. 577), whose feast day is 16 May and who is associated with Clonfert in Galway and Ardfert in Kerry. The previous saints have all been mentioned, at best, in the martyrologies, except that Beoaed's generosity was celebrated in a Middle Irish poem; Brendan, however, was celebrated in a series of lives as well as in the 'Navigatio sancti Brendani'. The relationship and dates of the texts have been disputed, but they indubitably bear witness to an enduring and widespread cult. Although Clonfert was the resting-place of his body, the cult far transcended the kingdom of the Ui Maini, within which Clonfert lay. Indeed, the fourteenth-century text 'The customs of Ui Maini' shows that other, more local saints, such as

Brice Douglas (d. 1222), a son of William Douglas and prior of Lesmahagow in Lanarkshire, as bishop of Moray in 1203; the Brice (not a common name) who was a parson and dean of Christianity in Moray between 1188 and 1203 would be a Moray cousin. Bishop Brice brought his brother Freskin, parson of Douglas, to be dean, and three other brothers to be canons, of the cathedral chapter which he established in 1206-8 at Spynie, with the customs of Lincoln; hitherto the see had been peripatetic. 
In November 1215 Brice was one of the Scottish bishops at the Fourth Lateran Council, and he had to visit the curia again in 1218 to seek absolution for ignoring the recent interdict on Scotland. In the same year his archdeacon and cathedral chancellor accused him at the curia of extortion of an eighth, or even a third, from his flock, of taking procurations without visitation, and of demanding money from ordinands and to grant divorces, money which he spent on women of ill fame. The truth of these allegations is unknown. Brice died in 1222. 
Brice's brother, Archibald Douglas, had two sons: William and Andrew. From the latter descended the Douglases 'of Lothian', or 'of Dalkeith', later earls of Morton. The former, William, lord of Douglas, died 'c'.1270-74, when the lordship of Douglas, with the manor of Fawdon in Northumberland which he had bought, passed to his son (possibly second son)

Robert (IV) de Brus, lord of Annandale (c.1195-1226x33). He was of age in 1215, when King John made him minor conciliatory grants on the eve of, and soon after, conceding 'Magna Carta'. Unlike his distant cousin Peter de Brus, lord of Skelton, he played no known part in the civil and Anglo-Scottish wars of 1215-17, though Alexander II would surely have demanded his knight-service. He attested the marriage settlement of that king at York in 1221 and owed scutage until 1226, but is not recorded thereafter. His marriage to Isabel, second daughter of David, earl of Huntingdon, which annals once attributed to John Fordun placed before Earl David's death in 1219, was probably not long before, and there is no authority for the often repeated claim that his son was born in 1210. This marriage would have given him some lands in the south which perhaps kept him in England. Robert (IV)'s death has been placed wrongly in 1245: his fief of Hart was in his kinsman's wardship when Richard Poor was bishop of Durham (1228-37), and the bishop's grant of privileges to the borough of Hartlepool in September 1230 may place the wardship that early; indeed there is no evidence that he was alive after 1226, and he was certainly dead by March 1234. He died on 21 April or 26 August, between 1226 and 1233, and was buried at Guisborough Priory. Isabel died in 1251 and was buried at Sawtry Abbey in Huntingdonshire. They had one son, Robert (V) de Brus.

Buite mac Bronaig (d. 519/20), whose feast day was celebrated on 7 December. This lay north of the River Boyne in an area which remained under Ciannacht control even after, in the early eighth century, the territory around Duleek was taken from them by the Ui Neill of Brega. A cadet branch of the ruling dynasty of the Ciannacht Breg held the abbacy of Monasterboice for much of the eleventh century and included the important Middle Irish poet Flann Mainistrech (Flann of Monasterboice). The strength of the church in the post-viking period is also demonstrated by the surviving high crosses. The annals fix Buite's obit by asserting that it occurred in the same year as the birth of St Columba; the information may, therefore, have been part of the Iona annals which seem to have covered the period from the sixth century up to the 740s. His genealogy attributes Buite to the Ciannacht Breg. The Latin life is post-Norman, seeking to associate Buite with Mellifont, the Cistercian monastery founded close to Monasterboice in 1140. Unusually for an Irish saint, there is special mention of the finding of his relics, both in the twelfth-century martyrology of Gorman and also in the Latin life. The first part of the life ends, first, with Buite being taken up to heaven 'like a second Elijah' on 1 May (Plummer, 'Vitae sanctorum Hiberniae', vol. 1), then being returned to earth after unusual divine attention had been paid to the complaints of the brethren; finally, the saint died on 7 December having thus been enabled to live to see and declare the day on which Columba was born. The life further claims, via prophecy on the part of Buite, that, thirty years after Buite died, Columba came to Monasterboice, revealed the site of the saint's burial and prescribed the bounds of the cemetery. The life's version suggests, therefore, that the saint's body remained buried in the cemetery but was indicated by some sign. The treatment would thus be the same as that accorded to Columba himself in the time of Adomnan (died 704) and would not reflect the growing practice of elevation and enshrinement found in the eighth century. It is possible that the appearance of a second feast day, 16 May, in the martyrology of Tallaght, may indicate that a form of this story was already current in the ninth century, even though the days do not agree (1 and 16 May).

Frances von Bunsen, Baroness von Bunsen in the Prussian nobility (1791-1876)], hostess and biographer, in the chapel of Niebuhr's residence, the Palazzo Savelli. The couple had ten children, five sons and five daughters, including the biblical scholar Ernest Christian Ludwig de Bunsen. Born at Dunston Park, Berkshire, on 4 March 1791 and educated by her mother at Llanofer, Frances von Bunsen did not visit her native country for twenty-one years after her marriage. A dedicated mother, she shared her husband's strong Christian convictions. She also contributed to her husband's career: her British background allowed Bunsen to penetrate to the heart of the high-powered English community. Many of the friendships he and his wife built up in the early years of their marriage turned out to be of great importance in their later life.

Cadwaladr ap Gruffudd (d. 1172), king in Wales, Owain's younger brother, is first mentioned in 1136. On Owain's accession in 1137 he was granted, or confirmed in possession of, Anglesey and Meirionydd, and the following year he received the northern half of Ceredigion after its conquest from the Normans. Until 1157 his relations with Owain were strained: on the one hand, he may well have nursed ambitions of supplanting his brother as king of Gwynedd, while, on the other, Owain's sons Hywel and Cynan sought to occupy their uncle's lands. In 1140 Cadwaladr joined with his brother in complaining to Bishop Bernard of St David's about the election of Meurig to the see of Bangor, but by the beginning of the following year Cadwaladr had allied himself, quite possibly to strengthen his hand against Owain, with Ranulf (II), earl of Chester (died 1153), leading a contingent of Welsh troops alongside the latter at the battle of Lincoln against King Stephen on 2 February 1141. Cadwaladr greatly angered Owain in 1143 on account of his apparent complicity in the murder of Anarawd ap Gruffudd ap Rhys, to whom Owain had planned to give his daughter in marriage, and as a result he was driven out of northern Ceredigion by Hywel ab Owain and also, apparently, from Anglesey, until restored after threatening Owain with a military force hired in Ireland. However, Cadwaladr's position in Gwynedd remained precarious. In 1147 he was driven out of Meirionydd by his nephews, Hywel and Cynan; in 1149 he transferred his portion of Ceredigion to his son, Cadfan, and in the following year Cadfan was seized, together with his land and castle of Llanrhystud, by Hywel ab Owain; and in 1152 he was expelled from his only remaining territory of Anglesey. Meanwhile the alliance with Ranulf continued, as is shown by charters of the late 1140s and early 1150s in which Cadwaladr witnesses as king of Wales ('rege Waliarum') and king of north Wales ('rege Nortwaliarum'). These styles suggest that Ranulf encouraged his ally's regal ambitions in Gwynedd so as to make trouble for Owain, whose expansion into Tegeingl and Ystrad Alun by 1150 posed a threat to the earl's authority. By 1153 Cadwaladr had married Aliz de Clare, quite possibly to be identified with Adeliza, widow of Richard de Clare (d. 1136), the former Norman lord of Ceredigion, and thus Ranulf's sister; the marriage may have been intended to strengthen Cadwaladr's claims to Ceredigion, control of which passed to the sons of Gruffudd ap Rhys of Deheubarth by 1153. This was not his first marriage, however, for his son Cadfan was already an adult by 1149; indeed, the late medieval genealogical tract referred to above states that Cadwaladr had children with four women in all. The support given by Cadwaladr to the Angevin cause in Stephen's reign stood him in good stead after his expulsion from Gwynedd in 1152, for by 1155 or 1156 he had been granted the estate of Ness in Shropshire by Henry II, who ensured that he was restored to his lands in north Wales following the campaign of 1157 (in which Cadwaladr fought on Henry's side). These Angevin connections probably explain why Cadwaladr patronized the Augustinian abbey of Haughmond in Shropshire, to which, as early as the 1140s, he granted the church of Nefyn in Llyn, for Haughmond (situated only 10 miles away from Ness) received benefactions from Ranulf of Chester and other Angevin supporters. After 1157 Cadwaladr remained loyal to Owain Gwynedd for the rest of the latter's reign. Together with his nephews Hywel and Cynan he took part in Reginald fitz Henry's expedition against Rhys ap Gruffudd in 1159, he participated in the campaign against Henry II in 1165, and he fought alongside his brother in the campaigns which led to the occupation of Tegeingl in 1167. Famed, according to Gerald of Wales, for his outstanding generosity, Cadwaladr outlived Owain by about fifteen months, and was buried beside his brother in Bangor Cathedral in 1172.

Cadwgan ap Bleddyn (d. 1111), son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and an unidentified mother, appears to have inherited a share of Powys after his father's death in 1075. Cadwgan first appears in the Welsh chronicles in 1088 when he joined his brothers Madog and Rhiryd in expelling Rhys ap Tewdwr from Deheubarth, but Rhys soon returned and defeated the sons of Bleddyn at Llech-y-crau; Madog and Rhiryd were killed but Cadwgan escaped and returned after Rhys's death to plunder Dyfed towards the beginning of May 1093. Cadwgan played a leading role in the Welsh revolt against the Normans which began in spring 1094, defeating a Norman army sent against Gwynedd. However, in 1098 Cadwgan was forced to flee to Ireland together with Gruffudd ap Cynan (died 1137) in the face of an attack on Gwynedd and Anglesey led by the earls of Chester and Shrewsbury, and on his return the following year he made peace with the Normans and was granted a portion of Powys and also Ceredigion, presumably under the overlordship of Robert de Belleme, the new earl of Shrewsbury. Although Cadwgan, together with his brothers Iorwerth and Maredudd, supported Robert's revolt in 1102, he retained his lands in Powys and Ceredigion after the earl's fall and indeed increased his power following the imprisonment of both Maredudd and Iorwerth.

Caillin mac Niataig (fl. 6th cent.?) lay to the north of the heartlands of Mide, at Fenagh, in modern co. Leitrim. Fenagh is in the drumlin belt, in an area of poor lands and, in the early period, marginal dynasties. Once the area had been conquered by what claimed to be a cadet branch of the Ui Briuin of Connacht -- a branch that became the O Ruairc (O'Rourkes) of Breifne -- however, the fortunes of Fenagh and of St Caillin improved. The main information comes from the 'Book of Fenagh', written in 1516 for the family regarded as the heirs of Caillin, the Ui Rodaigh (O'Roddys). Its concern is with the dues and fees paid to Fenagh; stories about Caillin serve to justify such claims. His feast day was celebrated on 13 November.

Caimin (d. 644?), one of the claimed founders of the monastery of Inis Celtra (Holy Island) on Lough Derg, is commemorated in the martyrologies on 25 March. The saints' genealogies are unsure of the identity of his father, who is named both Colman and Dimmae. His maternal genealogy is more important, however. Under the year 662 in the annals of the four masters, Caimin is described as the uterine brother of Guaire Aidne (died 633), an Ui Fhiachrach king of Connacht, and a central figure in a series of tales from the region. The kingdom of Ui Fhiachrach Aidne (south-west Galway) bordered on Munster. Moreover, Guaire was linked through blood and friendship with a number of west Munster figures, so much so that one critic has detected the remains of a literary cycle surrounding Guaire, which described political events in the seventh and eighth centuries and was written no later than the ninth. Caimin's cult suffered through possible confusion with Cummene Fota (d. 662), abbot of Clonfert ['see under 'Connacht, saints of], and through the dominance of Colum mac Crimthainn, the patron of Inis Celtra. One unpublished Irish metrical life celebrates the saint. His main claim to prominence, however, was his conflict with Guaire Aidne in the eleventh-century saga 'Cath Cairn Chonaill'. In the battle of Carn Conaill (649), Diarmait, son of Aed Slaine, joint king of Tara with his brother Blathmac, defeated Guaire. In the saga account, however, Guaire's defeat is the direct result of Caimin's curse, for the king had outraged the saint. Guaire is saved through repentance, and reconciliation with the church. The church of Inis Celtra itself flourished despite viking incursions up the Shannon. It formed part of the 'paruchia' of Terryglass. Impressive remains, including earthworks from the early monastic settlement, several churches, a round tower, and two high crosses, can still be seen on Holy Island.

Cainnech moccu Dalann (521/7-599/600) was the abbot and founder of Aghaboe (Achad Bo Chainnig) and Kilkenny (Cell Chainnig) in Osraige. He is commemorated on 11 October in the martyrology of Tallaght and the annals of Ulster record his birth in either 521 or 527 and his death in either 599 or 600. His cult spread widely, and there are several Scottish dedications to the saint, including St Andrews (Cill Rigmonaig). He was also imagined to be the pupil of the Welsh saint, Cadog of Llancarfan. Cainnech's father, Luigthech (Lugaid), was of the Corco Dalann, who lived near Derry. His mother is named as Mella. Cainnech's northern pedigree is matched by connections with northern saints. He appears as Comgall's companion both in the life of that saint and in the recensions of his own life, the oldest of which is eighth- or early ninth-century. Additionally, the lives often place him in the company of Columba (Colum Cille), drawing some of their passages from Adomnan's seventh-century life of that saint.

Cairnech (fl. 5th-early 6th cent.) of Dulane (Tulen, or Tuilian), Meath, another early saint of probable British origin, is with little doubt identical with the British saint, Carannog (Carantocus). They have the same feast day, 16 May, and the first life of the latter explicitly identifies the two saying that 'he changed his name in their [the Irish] language to Cernach' ('Vita prima', ed. Wade-Evans, chap. 2). It also admits that Carannog was buried in his chief Irish monastery. On the other hand, the first life's understanding of the geography of Cairnech's Irish cult is limited: it plainly thinks that he was primarily a Leinster saint, probably being led astray by the proximity of Leinster to Ceredigion in Wales, where the life appears to have been written. In one of the notes to the 'Felire Oengusso' he was said to be of the Cornishmen, but the Welsh lives associate him with Ceredig ap Cunedda, the eponymous founder of the kingdom of Ceredigion. They thus connect him with his principal Welsh church at Llangranog, Cardiganshire; on the other hand, the first life also makes him the saint of Carhampton, 3 miles south-east of Minehead in Somerset, although it fails to mention Crantock (from 'Carantoc'), just to the west of Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall. The 'Felire Oengusso''s notion that Carannog was a Cornishman may stem from some link between Ireland and Crantock. In Brittany a parish in Finistere was dedicated to Carantec; so also Tregarantec in Leon. The cult was, therefore, widespread by the twelfth century, the latest possible date for the Welsh life and the date also of the Irish saga of the triple death of Muirchertach mac Erca, king of Tara, in which Cairnech is a principal character ('Aided Muirchertaig meic Erca'). It is likely that this saga was written at Cairnech's main Irish church, Dulane.

She was a saint of the Benntraige in the south of Munster, and is known mainly through an episode which occurs towards the end of the Irish life of Senan but was probably originally independent. Canir, it is said, journeyed to Inis Cathaig, where she wished to die and be buried. Senan at first refused to allow this because she was a woman. Eventually, he relented, moved by Canir's stubbornness, rather than by her impassioned plea for equality.

Carthach mac Fianain (fl. late 6th cent.), whose feast day is 5 March. The latter was identified as the son of the king of Munster and the sexually straying pupil of Ciaran of Saigir. Mo Chutu became abbot of Rahan in the lands of the southern Ui Neill. The annals of Ulster record his expulsion from Rahan in 637 during Easter, which may refer to an episode in the Easter controversy that raged in the Irish churches during the seventh century. As a Munster cleric Mo Chutu would have taken a pro-Roman approach which could have led to his expulsion. Following this, Mo Chutu travelled to Desi where he founded the great monastery of Lismore. In the several recensions of his life, both Irish and Latin, which go back to an eleventh- or twelfth-century Latin original, the Easter question is a non-issue. Instead, Mo Chutu stands against the tyrannical actions of the Ui Neill kings and is welcomed by the Desi. He appears as an equally heroic figure in the saga 'Indarba Mo Chutu a r-Raithin' ('The expulsion of Mo Chutu from Rahan'). It must have been a matter of satisfaction to the hagiographers that Lismore surpassed Rahan in importance, becoming one of the great monasteries of the province and easily surviving the vikings. It was patronized by the kings of Munster, particularly the Mac Carthaig of Desmond, and was prominent in the church reform movement. Its influence was such that it surpassed Ardmore, the rival Desi church, and became the see of the diocese of Lismore.

Hugh Chamberlen the younger (1664-1728) and to his cousin Middleton Walker. Hugh the younger held political and religious affiliations very different from those of his father, who was a whig and a Baptist. Hugh the younger -- a tory and a member of the Church of England -- was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, studied medicine in Leiden, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 2 April 1694. In striking contrast to the turbulent relationship of previous generations of the family to the college, he served as censor in 1707, 1718, and 1721. He married three times, his first wife being Mary Bacon and his third Mary, Lady Crew. He was a highly fashionable man-midwife, employed for example by the tory Stafford family; after the death of the duke of Buckingham, Hugh lived openly with his widow, Catherine, parting from her in November 1727. He subscribed to books by tory authors including Thomas Hearne, Matthew Prior, and John Gay. On his monument in Westminster Abbey, erected in 1729 by Edmund, duke of Buckingham, the family medical tradition is represented by the snake of Asclepius, and reference is made to Hugh the elder and Dr Peter. 
However, other English practitioners associated with the Chamberlen family used the forceps while the family was still active in midwifery. Among these was James Douglas, associated with Paul Chamberlen, and who attended Chamberlen patients when a family member was not available. Douglas used instruments unsuccessfully in a case he attended in 1702, and his own account of the event states that he was unable to fasten what he describes only as 'the thing' in such a way that he could exert traction with it. Douglas may have obtained the instruments while studying in the Dutch republic, possibly in Utrecht, or may have been taught their use by Hugh the elder. It is known that Hugh the elder sold two instruments to a group of Dutch surgeons, including Rogier van Roonhuysen, about 1694, and that they kept the knowledge secret until about 1750. As for France, a few French surgeons were using the forceps from 1717 onwards, employing them however not to deliver live children, but to extract a dead foetus. 
As Hugh the younger had three daughters, his death in 1728, followed by that of Middleton Walker on 16 November 1732, marked the end of the Chamberlen family medical tradition; the design of the forceps was published in 1733. In the same period, three midwifery instruments emerged on the scene in England, France, and the Dutch republic: the forceps, the vectis, and the fillet. The forceps consisted of two blades by which the foetal head could be grasped and traction exerted; the vectis was a single curved blade which could be used to alter the position of the head; the fillet comprised a rigid handle and a flexible strip that could be looped around the head before exerting traction. But, in addition to Douglas, several practitioners in the London area were using the forceps before 1732; Hugh the younger, having no male heir, perhaps sold the secret for a fee to a few individuals in the period from about 1710 to 1720. 
Nevertheless, it remained impossible to identify the forceps securely as the Chamberlen secret hinted at by Dr Peter and probably underlying the practice of his father and uncle; after 1733 some practitioners in England continued to suggest that the secret had been a manual technique rather than a medical instrument. The fillet was particularly difficult to use, so that part of the secret could have been instruction in the best technique. By 1750, opinion had generally settled on the forceps as the Chamberlens' device. But in 1813, Peter Chamberlen's own medical instruments were discovered under the floorboards of the attic at the house where he had died. These included not only three sets of the forceps, vectis, and fillet, with one example of what is apparently an earlier version of the forceps, but also the hooks used to remove a dead child. Wilson thus argues that 'all the three early-modern instruments for delivering a living child by the head originated with the Chamberlens' (Wilson, 57).

Paul Chamberlen (1635-1717), born on 22 October 1635, was a quack doctor living in Great Suffolk Street, best known for the 'anodyne necklace' he sold for 5's'. It came with liquid coral, which could be rubbed on to the gums to aid teething; the necklace was also marketed to ease pain in childbirth. When his brother Hugh left London for Scotland in 1699, Paul advertised in the 'London Post' to assure his clientele that he remained in London, and had not deserted his practice. His patients included the duchess of Hamilton; unlike his brother, he appears to have been on good terms with midwives and, in 1706, he wrote to Hans Sloan recommending the midwifery skills of Mrs Bizzel. He died on 3 December 1717 and was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields; his wife, Mary ('nee' Disbrowe), died in the following year. 
It was through Hugh the elder that the claims of a family secret were first made public. In 1673, in the preface to 'The Accomplisht Midwife', his translation of Francois Mauriceau's 'Traite des maladies des femmes grosses', Hugh claimed that, with his father and two of his brothers, he possessed the secret of how to deliver a living child if it presented by the head but the birth was obstructed. He implied that the secret was a skill rather than a device, 'a Way to deliver Women in this Case, without any prejudice to them or their Infants'; however, this phrasing may have been intended to draw attention away from any suggestion that the secret was some form of instrument. Traditionally, surgeons used hooks in such deliveries, killing the child in the process if it were not already dead, so that their arrival was greeted with despair. In 1678 one of the family -- either Hugh or his father, Dr Peter -- proposed to the crown that the family secret could be passed on to '2 or more discreet persons in each county of England and Wales' ('CSP dom.', '1678', 610). The offer was not taken up; a petition by Hugh to the College of Physicians for 'a patent relating to midwifery' in 1687 also failed. It is possible that few believed in the secret, which smacked of typical quack methods more characteristic of Paul's practice; Hugh's political notoriety may also have contributed to the lack of wider interest in his claims at this time. 
In 1694 Mauriceau's 'Observations' gave his version of the events of 1670, when Hugh had met him in Paris, alleging that Hugh had offered to sell the secret for 10,000 crowns, and that he had then tested Hugh by allowing him to attempt to deliver a woman of whom he had previously despaired. Despite his boasts, Hugh had failed. But by the 1690s Hugh was working on other schemes; in particular, like his father in 1649 and his brother Paul in 1705-6, he was continually bombarding parliament with banking proposals. 
The family midwifery practice meanwhile passed from Hugh to his son

Peter Chamberlen the younger (1572-1626), born on 15 February 1572 in Southampton and also a member of the Barber-Surgeons, shared his brother's interest in midwifery. In 1616 the brothers responded to a petition from the London midwives to form a college; in supporting this unsuccessful request, the Chamberlens stated that they both practised midwifery, although only Peter the younger appears to have held a licence from the bishop of London. Peter the younger shared his brother's disregard for the boundaries between surgical and medical practice, and also fell out with his fellow surgeons. When accused by the College of Physicians, in 1600, of treating syphilis by diet and purging, he confessed, but he was also fined by the Barber-Surgeons' Company for absence from lectures on a number of occasions between 1602 and 1606. He married Sara Delaune, the daughter of a French protestant minister and sister of Gideon Delaune, the royal apothecary. In 1607 Peter was accused of prescribing medicines to three patients; in his defence, he claimed that he was following the advice of his father-in-law, William Delaune, who was also licensed by the College of Physicians. He began the procedure of being examined for the college in 1610, but proceeded no further, and was threatened with imprisonment by the college in 1620 after altering a prescription written by Dr Argent. He died after 12 August 1626 and was buried at Downe on 16 August. 
Peter the younger had eight children: Peter, Sarah, William, Ann, Henry, Robert, Nathaniel, and Marguerite. Of these Peter Chamberlen (1601-1683) and Nathaniel Chamberlain (bap. 1612) were physicians. Peter was usually known as Dr Peter not only to distinguish him from his father and uncle of the same name, but also to emphasize that he was qualified as a doctor of medicine rather than as a barber-surgeon. In the 1630s he too tried to organize the London midwives into a college, with himself as governor; a claim made in this context, that Dr Peter was particularly enthusiastic about the use of iron instruments in difficult cases, may be the first hint of there being a 'family secret' underpinning the Chamberlens' success in midwifery. Dr Peter was expelled from the College of Physicians in 1649 when, following the execution of Charles I, the college became more conservative and began to take action against empirics and others challenging its authority. He was reinstated as physician-in-ordinary by Charles II in 1660. 
In 'A Voice in Rhama' (1647) Dr Peter stated that his was an 'Asclepiad-family', to which he owed his knowledge of both medicine and drugs. The medical character of the family continued into the next generation: his daughter Elizabeth married Colonel William Walker, and their sons Chamberlen (died 1731) and Middleton were both doctors, in Dublin and London respectively, while of his fourteen sons, four practised some form of medicine. The best-known of these is Hugh Chamberlen the elder, whose own son (also Hugh) was also in practice. Nathaniel studied at Pembroke College, Oxford (BM 30 June 1636). John, who died in 1699 in the parish of St Clement Danes, was a physician who practised midwifery. Another son,

Peter Chamberlen the elder (c.1560-1631) appears to have stayed in Southampton with his wife, Anne, until the death of his father, being admitted to the Barber-Surgeons' Company only in 1598. In London he was based in Mark Lane, and attended the queens of James I and Charles I. The first evidence of his reluctance to restrict his activities to surgery was in December 1609, when the College of Physicians summoned him to appear before the president and censors. He failed to attend, and was later fined 40's'., which was halved at appeal in March 1610. In November 1612 he was again fined by the College of Physicians for usurping the role of a physician. Imprisoned in Newgate, he was released only after the intervention of the archbishop of Canterbury and the lord mayor, who may have been influenced by Thomas Chamberlen, Peter's cousin and the master of the Mercers' Company. He was listed in 1614 as a surgeon to Queen Anne; his will mentions a diamond ring which she gave him. He was the sole attendant to Henrietta Maria when she miscarried at Greenwich in 1628, and was present at the birth of the future Charles II in 1630, although this was managed by the French midwife Mme Peronne. He died in December 1631 and was buried in St Dionis Backchurch; at this time he seems to have been living mainly in Downe, Kent, where he owned land, and where his brother Simon also resided. His wife, Anne, predeceased him; his only child was a daughter, Esther.

Francis Chesham (1749-1806) exhibited engravings at the Society of Artists in 1777-8 and 1780. He worked for a number of publishers, specializing particularly in landscape views, although he also engraved, for instance, the designs of Charles Catton for the third volume of 'The English Peerage' (1790). For Boydell, he engraved the plate of 'Admiral Parker's Victory' (1782), after Robert Dodd, and two of George Robertson's views of Coalbrookdale, the others being by Lowry and Fittler.

Ciaran mac int Shair (c.515-548/9) of Clonmacnoise (feast day 9 September), was described as 'mac int shair' ('son of the wright'), but his father's name was Beoan; he came from the Cruithnian people of Latharnae, who gave their name to the modern town of Larne; his mother, Dar Erca, was later said to be Patrick's sister, but this was Patrician propaganda of a familiar kind. The monastery of Clonmacnoise (Cluain Moccu Nois) was founded a year before his death. Its border location on the east bank of the Shannon and the comparatively humble, and distant, situation of the Latharnae were exploited in two directions. First, as with the monastery of Clonfertmulloe in the north of Munster, the abbacy was not attached to any one family. Abbots were recruited from a wide variety of kindreds, so creating links with many kingdoms. Second, Clonmacnoise extended its influence not just in Meath but also, and especially, in Connacht. In the Middle Irish genealogies of the saints, it is said that the Connachta followed Ciaran, the Ui Neill Columba. The acquisition of lordship over Connacht churches by Clonmacnoise was said by Tirechan, writing 'c'.690, to have spread in the recent past. The prestige of Clonmacnoise within Connacht is demonstrated by the ecclesiastical edicts, 'canai', promulgated in the province in the name of Ciaran in the eighth century. But the monastery was also patronized by the Ui Neill and especially by Cland Cholmain; the west cross was put up at the expense of a late ninth-century king of Tara, Flann Sinna, who is very probably represented, together with the abbot, on one of its panels.

Ciaran mac Luaigne (fl. 450-500), bishop and patron of Ossory, was also imagined as flourishing in the sixth century. His main foundation was the great monastic church of Saigir (Seir Kieran). He is commemorated on 5 March in 'Felire Oengusso' and he is often referred to as 'sen', old, Ciaran to differentiate him from his namesake, Ciaran of Clonmacnoise, the founder of Clonmacnoise ['see under 'Meath, saints of]. The hagiographical tradition devoted to Ciaran is complex. There are two Latin and two Irish lives. The fuller of the Latin texts is that preserved in 'Codex Kilkenniensis', in comparison with which the life in the Salamanca collection is abbreviated. Both are difficult to date. Of the Irish lives, one is a translation of the longer of the Latin lives, while the second Irish life, as it stands, is a post-Reformation production. Nevertheless, the latter contains the oldest materials, particularly in its pro-Munster treatment of Osraige politics. In these lives Ciaran is portrayed as a wild man, dressed in skins. His first monks are forest animals. Otherwise, his pre-Patrician career follows that of Ailbe. Unlike the latter, however, Ciaran is always subordinate to Patrick, whom he first meets in Italy. Indeed, his lives make little mention of Ailbe, Declan, and Ibar. They are more interested in extending the rights of Saigir.

Clement, John (d. 1572), physician, was probably a native of Yorkshire. He was educated at John Colet's newly established St Paul's School under William Lily, and possibly for a time at Oxford. He made an early acquaintance of Sir Thomas More, who took him into his family, made him tutor to his children, and treated him with great kindness. He accompanied More on his Flanders embassy of 1515 and appears in the discussion that introduces 'Utopia': 'John Clement, my pupil-servant, was also present at the conversation. Indeed, I do not allow him to absent himself from any talk which can be somewhat profitable, for from this young plant, seeing that it has begun to put forth green shoots in Greek and Latin literature, I expect no mean harvest some day. (More, 'Utopia', 41)' In April 1518 Clement passed into the service of Cardinal Wolsey. On learning of this, Erasmus, whom he had met while in More's household, sent him a warning not to overwork, and not to write at night if he could; if he must, he must learn to do so standing up ('Correspondence', 5.392). He did not remain with the cardinal in person, but was sent to Oxford, where he settled at Corpus Christi College as reader in rhetoric and humanity, a post Wolsey had just created. Michaelmas 1518 saw Clement lecturing, a proud More informed Erasmus, 'to a larger audience than anyone has ever had before; it is remarkable how popular he is', even impressing Thomas Linacre with his learning ('Correspondence', 5.215). In 1519, however, Clement devoted himself to medicine. He travelled to Louvain in Brabant for further study, and then made his way to Italy, visiting Erasmus at Basel 'en route'. Clement stayed in Italy for several years, graduating MD on 30 March 1525 at Siena. About this time he assisted in the editing of the Aldine Greek edition of Galen's works, printed at Venice in 1525-6. Among his colleagues in that project was Thomas Lupset, who had been his successor at Oxford. 
Clement returned to England in 1525 and moved into More's old house, The Barge, in Bucklersbury, London. That year he obtained the minor court title of sewer of the chamber. In 1526 he married Margaret Giggs (1508-1570) ['see 'Clement, Margaret], More's adopted daughter whom he had taught while tutor to the family. By 1528 he was receiving regular half-yearly payments of $10 from the court as a 'phisicion'; and he was one of the physicians sent by Henry VIII to Wolsey when the cardinal lay languishing at Esher in 1529. On 1 February 1528 Clement was admitted a member of the London College of Physicians. On 16 April following he became an elect, and was consiliarius from 1529 to 1531 and in 1547. 
Clement was imprisoned with More in the Tower of London in 1535 for refusing to take the oath of supremacy. Margaret, his wife, was a devout Catholic who secretly took food to the priors of the Charterhouse when they were chained in the Tower for the same reason. When More was executed she was the only one of his household to attend the execution and it was she who retrieved the headless corpse for burial. Clement was released after a while and his fortunes seem to have suffered no long-term harm. His royal payments as physician continued until 1540, and in 1544 he was elected president of the College of Physicians. 
Under Edward VI, Clement was less fortunate. In July 1549 he fled abroad to Louvain, where he was joined in October by his wife, and in December by his daughter Winifred ('b'. 1527) and her husband William Rastell, More's nephew. He remained in the colony of English religious exiles supported by Antonio Bonvisi in Louvain until 19 March 1554, when he returned to England. During Mary's reign he practised at Marshfoot in Essex, but by 1560, soon after Elizabeth's accession, he again left the country. 
Clement and his family next lived for a time at Bergen, before moving to Mechelen where he became one of the English colony's most important members. He died at his house in Blockstraate in St John's parish, Louvain, on 1 July 1572, and was buried the next day near the high altar of the cathedral church of St Rumbold, close to his wife, who had died on 6 July 1570. In addition to Winifred, Clement had a son, Thomas, who was a godson of More, and several other daughters, including Dorothy, who became a Poor Clare in 1571 at Louvain, and Margaret, who entered St Ursula's convent there. 
Clement was not a prolific writer, but he did translate several religious works from Greek into Latin, including 'The epistles of Gregory Nazianzen', 'The homilies of Nicephorus Calixtus concerning the Greek saints', and 'The epistles of Pope Celestine I to Cyril, bishop of Alexandria'. In this work he was assisted by Margaret, his wife. Clement also owned an important library of Greek and Latin manuscripts.

Clement, Margaret (1508-1570), adopted daughter of Sir Thomas More, is of obscure parentage. She was described by the biographer of her daughter Margaret as having been 'a gentleman's daughter of Norfolk' (Durrant, 183); a family named Giggs lived in a building adjoining Bucklersbury in London, at first the home of Thomas More and thereafter of the physician John Clement (d. 1572) after his marriage to Margaret in 1526. In the portrait of the More family by Holbein, Margaret Giggs is described as 'cognata', a relative, so it seems to be in that capacity that she was adopted to keep More's eldest daughter, also a Margaret, company. More spotted her intelligence and piety, and she was taught in his 'school' along with his other daughters and close friends. Her teacher in Greek, for a time, was her future husband. She had a reputation for having a sense of humour, and Vives praised her Greek. 
Margaret Giggs acted as More's almoner when he was lord chancellor and looked after his objects of personal piety, including his hair shirt. When More was in the Tower, Margaret lent him her 'algorism stone', a slate for calculations or, in his case, for jotting down thoughts best kept from prying eyes. Margaret was one of the few eyewitnesses to his execution and the only member of his household present. As promised, the king permitted her to recover the body for burial; she was also one of those to whom the emperor, Charles V, conveyed condolences on More's death. 
By the time that Margaret Giggs married John Clement he was rapidly making his reputation as a doctor. The matrimonial home held a portrait of Thomas More, and it was full of books in Greek and Latin as well as glasses and 'earthern painted pots' with medicines inside. Margaret's first child was born in 1527 and her last (the eleventh) in 1540. Amid the rigours of childbirth Margaret found time, in May 1537, to minister to the Carthusians who were imprisoned in Newgate without trial and chained to a post without access to food or sanitation. Margaret bribed the gaoler and for a time kept them fed and clean until their very survival alerted the king to the succour they were receiving. 
The Clements had to flee on the accession of Edward VI, first to Bruges and Louvain but ultimately to Mechelen. In the reign of Mary they made a brief return to England both to reclaim their confiscated property (carefully listed by Margaret) and to attempt to regain possession of their houses in London and Hornchurch. The reign of Elizabeth saw them in exile again and Margaret died in Mechelen on 6 July 1570. She was buried in the cathedral of St Rumbald. Two of her daughters entered the religious life, while her eldest married William Rastell. Her gifts were directed to serving her family, the religious, and the poor. A drawing of her by Holbein, erroneously inscribed Mother Iak by a later hand, suggests a thoughtful and rather serious woman.

Clement, William Innell (1779/80-1852), newspaper proprietor, was born probably in London, of humble parents, and received only a scanty education. He married, first, at St Clement Danes, Westminster, on 13 April 1800, Jemima Jones; and second, at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 19 July 1811, Maria Isabella Jones. He became one of the leading newsvendors in London, and in 1814 extended his press activities when he bought 'The Observer', which had been founded in 1791. Two years later he was accepting moneys from the government in return for supporting them, and for distributing free copies of the paper. Clement aimed at making 'The Observer' the leading Sunday newspaper -- 'a seventh-day paper'; and by not printing until four o'clock on Sunday morning he was able to provide the latest news. 
In 1819 Clement's deputy publisher, George Goodger, revealed that 'The Observer' sold 10,850 copies on a Sunday, plus a further 2000 of its Monday print, all of which were stamped. However, he believed that 10,000 other copies, unstamped, were given away, under the pretence of being specimen copies. Postmen were each sent approximately 200 copies of the paper, and were asked to distribute them without charge. One postman said he 'was given two or three shillings for his trouble. He delivered them to the lawyers, doctors and gentlemen of the town' (Griffiths, 154). Clement himself admitted that free distribution of 'The Observer', on behalf of the government, extended to Bath and Dublin. 
Apart from owning 'The Observer', Clement was by this time also the publisher of William Cobbett's 'Weekly Register', but it proved not to be a happy relationship: Cobbett, upon the suspension of the 'Habeas Corpus Act' in 1817, fled to America and remained there until 1819. In the summer of 1820 Clement, based at 192 Strand, London, sold the property and his newsvending business to W. H. Smith, and the following year, upon James Perry's death, he bought the 'Morning Chronicle' for $42,000, retaining John Black as editor. However, the purchase of the 'Chronicle' was not a success, and he had been obliged to raise the greater portion of the money by bills. Through these transactions he became involved with Messrs Hurst and Robinson, upon whose bankruptcy he suffered greatly. 
To make 'The Observer' an even more popular and influential paper, Clement continued to spend money on the title, and he was fortunate that in Lewis Doxat he had a most successful editor-manager. Doxat, who served the paper for fifty-three years, revelled in the fact that 'he never wrote an article on any subject whatever'. During those years, Clement believed in 'a well-paid and well-informed staff', and as a result, with the use of new typography and woodcuts, the contents of the paper improved greatly -- especially at the time of the Cato Street conspiracy in 1820, when circulation doubled. However, Clement overreached himself when, ignoring the express injunction of the lord chief justice who presided over the trials of the Cato Street conspirators, he 'unlawfully and contemptuously' published in 'The Observer' an account of the trials of Thistlewood and Ings. Clement was fined $500 for contempt of court, but the fine was never paid. 
In 1824 or 1825 Clement bought 'Bell's Life in London', which was to become the leading sporting paper and extremely prosperous; during the next twenty years he saw its circulation rise from 3000 to more than 30,000. The editor was Vincent George Dowling, who remained in charge until his death in October 1852. Dowling was also the chief reporter on 'The Observer', and in the pay of the Home Office. During those years Lord Palmerston wrote editorials for the paper in support of his foreign policy, and he paid Clement from secret service funds. At his peak, in 1828, Clement owned four major London titles: 'The Observer', the 'Morning Chronicle', 'Bell's Life in London', and 'The Englishman'. But, within six years, despite support from the whigs, he was forced to sell the loss-making 'Chronicle' to Sir John Easthope for an estimated $16,500. William Clement remained in charge of 'The Observer' until his sudden death from apoplexy at Hackney, Middlesex, on 24 January 1852. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 31 January.

Clements, Michael (b. in or before 1735, d. c.1797), naval officer, is of unknown origins. Between 1748 and 1749 he served in the 'Syren' in the East Indies. His lieutenant's passing certificate (TNA: PRO, ADM 107/4, p. 334) gives his age in December 1755 as 'twenty and upwards'. In May 1757 he was first lieutenant of the frigate 'Unicorn' when she engaged and captured the 'Invincible', a large Malouin privateer. Captain Thomas Graves of the 'Unicorn' was killed, and Clements, after conducting the fight to a successful issue, brought the prize into Kinsale and went out again in pursuit of the privateer's consort, which he also captured and brought in. For this good service Clements was immediately promoted to the command of the buss 'London', and four months later (29 September) to post rank and the command of the frigate 'Actaeon'. Clements continued in her, attached to the Channel Fleet, until June 1759, when he was moved into the 'Pallas' (36 guns), also with the fleet blockading Brest and Quiberon Bay, and specially employed, with the other frigates, in cruising against the enemy's privateers and in communicating with the home ports. By a fortunate accident, the 'Pallas', in company with the 'Aeolus' and 'Brilliant', put into Kinsale in the last days of February 1760, just as a message came from the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant of Ireland, that Thurot's squadron was at Belfast. They immediately put to sea again, and, coming off Belfast on the morning of 28 February, succeeded in capturing all Thurot's ships with little loss. The 'Pallas' continued on the same service until the end of the year, and was then sent to the Mediterranean, where she remained until after the peace, and returned to England in December 1763. 
On paying off this ship Clements refused to give a certificate to the master, whom he reported as 'inattentive to his duty'. The master in revenge laid an accusation of waste and malversation of stores against his captain. After an inquiry at the Navy Office the charge was, in November 1765, pronounced groundless and malicious. In 1769 he commanded the 'Dorsetshire' (70 guns) guardship at Portsmouth, which in 1770 was sent to the Mediterranean as part of the British fleet watching the French at Toulon. In March 1778 he was appointed to the 'Vengeance' (74 guns), which he commanded in the action off Ushant on 27 July and in the October cruise under Admiral Augustus Keppel. He was afterwards a witness for the defence in the admiral's trial, and spoke very strongly in the admiral's favour. A few months later he was compelled to resign his command owing to poor health, and he never received another. In July 1780 he applied for leave to go abroad with his family, his residence (since at least 1767) having been Weybridge, Surrey. Clements chose Tuscany and finally asked for a passport for himself, his wife, and daughter for Ostend. 'When my health shall be re-established', he added, 'I shall be happy to return and follow my profession with every zeal to regain that reputation which at present appears to me so much sullied.' His name continued on the list of captains until 1787, when there was a very large retirement. Then, or a year or two later, he was made a rear-admiral on the superannuated list; he is believed to have died about 1797.

Clench, Andrew (d. 1692), physician and victim of murder, was the son of Edmund Clench of Ipswich. He matriculated from St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1663, and was created MD at Cambridge by royal mandate on 29 March 1671. Clench was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians on 22 December 1677, and a fellow on 23 December 1680; he had become a fellow of the Royal Society in April of that year. Between 1682 and 1687 Clench came into conflict with the College of Physicians over his criticism of the college and its fellows, and because of his friendship with the empiric Samuel Haworth. 
Clench lived in Brownlow Street, Holborn, London. He was murdered between nine and eleven o'clock on the night of Monday, 4 January 1692. 'This week', wrote John Evelyn in his diary: 'a most execrable murder was committed on Dr Clench, father of that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed. Under pretence of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him in it, and sending away the coachman under some pretence, they left his dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening.' A swindler named Henry Harrison, to whose mistress Clench had lent money, was convicted of the murder and hanged on 15 April 1692. Clench and his wife, Rose, had two sons, Edmund and John. From his will, we learn that he possessed property in Norfolk and Suffolk.

Clench, John (c.1535-1607), judge, was the son of John Clench of Wethersfield, Essex, and Jane, daughter of John Amyas of the same county. His grandfather, also John Clench, came from Leeds in Yorkshire. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1556, called to the bar in 1563, and served as reader of Furnival's Inn for three years from 1566 to 1569; these readings were on the 'Statutes of Wills' and the statute 'De conjunctim feoffatis'. In 1570 he was called to the bench of Lincoln's Inn, where he delivered a reading in 1574 and was treasurer from 1578 to 1579. He became recorder of Ipswich in 1575. In 1580 he was created serjeant-at-law, his patrons at the ceremony being the earl of Oxford, Lord Wentworth, and Sir William Cordell. A year later, on 27 November 1581, he was appointed one of the barons of the exchequer, and on 29 May 1584 he was translated to the queen's bench. 
Clench married Katherine, daughter of Thomas Almot of Creeting All Saints, with whom he had five sons and eight daughters. It was said that Elizabeth I referred to him as 'her good judge', but he was never knighted. By 1602, being 'so decrepit that he could not well travel outside his country' (Yale U., law school, MS G. R29.15, fol. 31), he was discharged from attendance at court; and on 17 September he was granted a pension. He died on 18 or 19 August 1607 at Holbrook, Suffolk, where he was also buried, and where there is a large monument bearing his effigy in robes. A three-quarter-length portrait in oils formerly existed in a number of versions, and was the basis of the quarter-length etching by Hollar dated 1664 for Dugdale's 'Origines juridiciales'. Clench was a reporter of cases from 1571 to 1592. His autograph reports, never published, together with notes of his Furnival's Inn readings, are now in the British Library (Harley MS 4556); and there is an incomplete copy at Yale. His eldest son, Thomas (died 1624), followed his father as a barrister of Lincoln's Inn and reader of Furnival's Inn; he served as member of parliament for Suffolk in 1620. Another son, Robert, was principal of Clifford's Inn from 1624.

Clennell, Luke (1781-1840), artist and wood-engraver, was born on 8 April 1781 at Ulgham, near Morpeth, Northumberland, and baptized there on 11 May, the second of the seven children of John Clennell, farmer. His powerful natural gifts as a draughtsman were evident from an early age. After attending Ulgham village school he was placed briefly with his uncle, a grocer and tanner in Morpeth. His graphic talent is said to have so impressed the young Lord Morpeth, son of the earl of Carlisle, that an introduction was made to Thomas Bewick (1753-1828), to whom he was indentured for seven years on his sixteenth birthday, 8 April 1797 ['see 'Bewick, Thomas, apprentices]. Bewick was at the height of his powers, having just put to press his first volume of the celebrated 'British Birds'. Clennell was fortunate in the timing of his training and before long was contributing to the production of the second volume of the 'Birds'. His tailpiece vignettes are distinctive in the vigour of their cutting and are clearly the work of a confident hand; some are of his own design and some exquisitely finished preliminaries survive in private hands; these anticipate his success as a watercolourist during his later brief career in London. 
During the latter part of Clennell's apprenticeship Bewick's workshop had been engraving blocks for James Wallis, a London bookseller who was publishing editions of Shakespeare's plays and Hume's 'History of England'. Charlton Nesbit, a former apprentice by then working in London, had also been commissioned by Wallis, and he may have been the spur to Clennell's move south. Here Clennell flourished, securing the full fee for work from which his master had previously deducted half. He was soon introduced to a wider circle of artists and engravers and on 27 August 1809 married, at St Pancras Church, Elizabeth, the daughter of Charles Warren, a leading metal-engraver employed by the book- and printsellers. They lived in London first at 9 Constitution Row, Gray's Inn Lane, and then in 1813 moved to 33 Penton Place, Pentonville. Among his commissions were wood engravings for 'The Hive of Ancient and Modern Literature' (1806), William Falconer's 'Shipwreck' (1808), William Beattie's 'The Minstrel' (1808), John Lawrence's 'The History and Delineation of the Horse' (1809), 'The Antiquarian Itinerary' (1815), and 'Recreations in Natural History' (1815). For the latter, and for some of the illustrations in Mrs Barbauld's edition of the 'British Novelists' (1810), copperplates were engraved by various hands after Clennell. There are thirty of his drawings for the novels of Smollett, Sterne, and others, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and his lively figures and the vigorously expressed narrative content show a marked contrast to the more staged and delicate work of the other illustrators of the day such as Richard Corbould and Richard Westall. His name is often remembered for the cuts he engraved after drawings by Thomas Stothard, for Samuel Rogers's 'Pleasures of Memory' (1810), although these are no more than very sensitively worked reproductive engravings in the black-line manner. 
Clennell's powers as a painter were recognized by Benjamin West, whose motif for the Highland Society of London's diploma he had engraved on wood in 1809, and it is said that it was West who encouraged him to move away from engraving. He was soon exhibiting with the various societies of painters in watercolours and in 1812 was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. 
By 1814 Clennell had produced sixty-eight large drawings for most of the plates in Scott's 'Border Antiquities' engraved by Storer and Greig. Examples are to be seen in the Laing Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, and in the Victoria and Albert Museum. They show all his skilful freedom in handling and effect, and much of the influence of Peter DeWint, and of Francois Francia and Thomas Girtin. His colouring is generally rich and sombre and his rustic figures are particularly characteristic, often with gesturing hands and prominent thumbs, and possibly reflecting what may have been his own sturdy build. Other examples of his work are rare, but some are to be found at the Paul Mellon Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut, the British Museum, the Natural History Society of Northumbria, Newcastle upon Tyne, and in private hands. He was given to signing his engravings and drawings within and as part of his designs, as for example on a packhorse's load or on an inn sign or turnpike notice, either simply with initials or with his name in a running hand. 
Clennell had also taken to painting in oils. His first major subject, 'Sportsmen Taking Refreshment at the Door of a Country Ale House', was exhibited at the British Institution in 1813. His fine 'The Baggage Waggon in a Thunderstorm' was shown at the Royal Academy in 1816, based on an earlier watercolour of 1810; versions of this subject can now be seen at the Laing Gallery and at the Paul Mellon Center for British Art, New Haven. In the same year he won a premium from the British Institution for his 'Final Charge of the Life Guards at Waterloo', a composition 'full of fire and furious movement' (Dobson, 196). 
The most substantial work of Clennell's career brought it to a tragic end. In 1814 a banquet was held at London's Guildhall to celebrate what was thought to be the end of the Napoleonic wars, and the earl of Bridgewater commissioned Clennell to make a record of the occasion. The canvas measured 4 ft 2 in. by 6 ft 3 in. and was to contain the portraits of more than a hundred of the guests. Sketches had to be made of them, accommodating all their foibles and vanities as sitters. In 1817, when this had been accomplished and the composition established, a depression seems to have descended on Clennell, who became more and more dejected; eventually he turned the picture to the wall and refused to discuss it. He was shortly afterwards, at thirty-six, committed to a London asylum. A print of the 'Final Charge of the Life Guards' engraved by W. Bromley was published in 1819, from which a subscription was raised to support Clennell's wife and four children. The incomplete picture of the 1814 banquet was later finished by other hands and is now after a long period of misattribution restored to Clennell's name in the Guildhall, London. By 1827 Clennell was living with relatives in Northumberland before his uncontrolled insanity led to his incarceration in a Newcastle asylum. He died on 9 February 1840 and was buried in St Andrew's churchyard, Newcastle upon Tyne. 
Two self-portraits exist, one a sketch in the Laing Gallery, the other in oils as a figure in the Guildhall painting. They show a strong head but little of Clennell's figure, which the engraver Edward Willis described as 'small and in-kneed', adding that Clennell had 'a peculiar look with his eyes' (MS records for Chatto's 'Treatise on Wood Engraving', 1839, London Library). William Bell Scott described Clennell's son Luke as 'a short man of Herculean build and bluff face, full of energy and possessed of an impulsive mental force which I feared from the first moment I saw him'; Scott went on to tell of the son's decline into insanity at the same age as his father ('Autobiographical Notes', 198-201). It may be reasonable to suppose that the son's sturdy frame was inherited. A further, unnamed, witness spoke of how much he loved Clennell: 'he was always so mild, so amiable, in short, such a GOOD fellow' (Dobson, 200). 
Some of Clennell's watercolours for tailpiece subjects are in the British Museum and the Natural History Society of Northumbria, Newcastle upon Tyne. The Victoria and Albert Museum and the Laing Art Gallery hold many of his landscape and genre watercolours, including, in the latter, several for Scott's 'Border Antiquities' (1814). Examples of his oils are in the Laing Art Gallery, the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut, and the Guildhall Art Gallery, London. Some of his original woodblocks are in the Newberry Library, Chicago, the Central Library, Newcastle upon Tyne, and in private collections.

Clenock, Maurice (c.1525-1580?), Roman Catholic ecclesiastic and administrator, was probably born in Clynnog Fawr, Caernarvonshire. He was educated at Oxford, possibly at Christ Church, proceeding BCL in 1548 after more than twelve years of study, by his own account. He lectured there on civil law for six years. He claimed to have studied law for a further eight years in Louvain (as well as theology for two years), Bologna and Padua, probably after he left England in 1559. He compounded for the rectorship of Gatcombe, Isle of Wight, to which Sir Geoffrey Pole had presented him, on 4 September 1554. He had become prebendary of Botevant in York Minster by 22 July 1556, but almost certainly never resided and resigned on 25 February 1561. Cardinal Pole appointed him dean of Shoreham and Croydon on 31 August 1557, after Clenock had obtained the rectory of Shoreham through other means, as well as that of Orpington, Kent, from Pole. Clenock was then identified as Pole's chaplain and domestic. He alleged that Pole made him chancellor of the prerogative court of Canterbury and dean of Canterbury peculiars, as well as legatine auditor, confessor to Pole and his household, and the cardinal's almoner and personal secretary, but only the first (between about August and October 1558) can be documented and Clenock was unusually called 'custos'; most of the rest seems unlikely, since Pole never identified him as anything more than chaplain, whether in an act of December 1557 or in his will, which Clenock witnessed. 
Thomas Goldwell, bishop of St Asaph, presented Clenock to the rectory of Corwen or Curr Owen on 20 November 1556. He was probably the 'Mr Maurice' who had a room in Lambeth Palace at Pole's death in 1558. At about that time he was nominated bishop of Bangor, but was never consecrated. When Elizabeth came to the throne he is said to have surrendered his preferments and to have had a licence to leave the realm, but he was certainly deprived of Orpington, perhaps not until 27 December 1566. Although in 1560 he accompanied Pole's former agent, Vincenzo Parpaglia, on an abortive mission to Elizabeth, by the following year he was urging Cardinal Morone, protector of England, to induce Philip II to depose the queen. Thereafter he went first to Louvain and then to Rome, about 1563, perhaps in company with Goldwell, although they very quickly came to head opposing factions there. Probably after his arrival in Rome an anonymous reporter judged him 'a good man, but... no preacher' and suitable for Bangor, should the pope decide to fill the see. 
Once in Rome, Clenock became Morone's client. By 1564 he had entered the English Hospice, and in the following year became its warden; he kept rooms there until 1578. He almost immediately found himself in conflict with a faction of the hospice led by Nicholas Morton, which was backed by Goldwell. An attempt to depose Clenock in 1565 was thwarted by Parpaglia and Morone's auditor. Elected warden again in 1567 Clenock refused and became a chamberlain instead, a position which he held again in 1569-71 and 1573, at which time he was said to be without means of subsistence. His catechism, 'Athravaeth Gristnogaul' ('Christian teaching'), with an introduction by Gruffydd Robert, appeared in Milan in 1568. 
In 1575 and 1576, probably in co-operation with Owen Lewis, Clenock drafted several detailed plans for an invasion of England. He also proposed that Lewis be made a cardinal. During the discussions of these plans in Rome the decision was taken to convert the hospice into a college, and on 26 May 1576 Clenock again became warden. Within a year a proposal was floated that the Jesuits take over. The English students quickly rebelled against Clenock's government, alleging among other things that he favoured Welshmen. Morone firmly backed Clenock, separating hospice and college and extending Clenock's term as warden of the latter to two years and then making him perpetual rector in 1578, assisted by two (later three) Jesuits. Clenock traced the origins of his terminal difficulties to his refusal to remove Goldwell from his rooms at the hospice. Morone, in tandem with Lewis, tried to quash the rebellion, but the English party with backing from the Jesuit Robert Persons induced Pope Gregory XIII to remove Clenock, probably on the grounds that he was interfering with their missionary vocation. Clenock retired to Rouen and, embarking thence for Spain, was drowned at sea, probably in 1580.

Clephane, John (1701/2-1758), physician, was born in Scotland, probably the eldest of the three sons and two daughters of Colonel William Clephane (died 1727), a Jacobite who escaped after the 1715 rebellion, and Elizabeth, daughter of James Cramond, priest of the Scottish Episcopal church. Between 1716 and 1724, suspected of being a Jacobite, he took a full arts and divinity course at St Andrews University. He then matriculated in the faculty of letters at Leiden in 1724 and studied medicine under Boerhaave, with whom he later corresponded. About 1725 he joined his father in Antwerp but returned to Scotland after his father's death. On 29 May 1729 he received an MD at St Andrews, with testimonials from Adam Murray MD, Thomas Carmichael, and James Blair. 
In 1731 Clephane was in Groningen, supervising the studies of Lord Sherard Manners, and between 1731 and 1737 he travelled as tutor to the younger sons of the duke of Rutland, lords Robert and Charles Manners. In 1735, living in the Rutland house in Cavendish Square, London, he is said to have been engaged to Lady Diana Grey, but in 1736 she married George Middleton and Clephane remained a bachelor. In 1739 Clephane travelled with Lord Maunsel to Italy and set out in October 1740 on a similar journey as tutor to John Bouverie; their time in Florence was recorded in letters from Horace Mann to Horace Walpole. Clephane was again in Italy in 1744 with Lord Montrath. 
By 1746 Clephane was practising medicine in London, and through Lord Sandwich he was appointed on 16 April as physician to the force, under General Sinclair, that failed to destroy the French East India Company stores at Port L'Orient, Brittany. He also met the philosopher and historian David Hume, Sinclair's secretary, who was to become a lifelong friend. On 8 January 1747 Clephane was elected FRS, and was described by Richard Mead as 'well skilled in Natural History, Chemistry and other branches of useful knowledge' (Royal Society, fellowship certificate). Four months later Lord Sandwich found him employment as physician to the army hospital at Osterhout, Flanders, after which in 1749 he was briefly superintendent of the army hospital at Ipswich. 
Placed on half pay and back in London, on 8 May 1751 Clephane was appointed physician to St George's Hospital. By 1752 he was living in Golden Square, and on 25 June he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. He was soon involved in disputes between the licentiates and the college, and in July 1752 he took out a writ against the college to recover the fees that, possibly illegally, he had been forced to pay for his licence. The college, fearing to lose the case, repaid the fees in December and the case was withdrawn. As a doctor, Clephane was interested in the possible connection between weather and disease, but his records were never published. He was an original member of the Society of London Physicians, founded in 1754, and published articles in its 'Medical Observations and Inquiries' (vol. 1, 1757) on the successful treatment of lockjaw and the history of gout powder. 
Although unwell, Clephane was recalled to military service in 1758 as physician to a force assembled in the Isle of Wight to destroy French ports. At the beginning of August he was taken ill on his ship, which was lying off Cherbourg, and he returned to the Isle of Wight, where he died on 11 October; his place of burial is not known. A classical scholar with interests outside medicine, he had correspondents in Britain and on the continent. Far from wealthy, he helped his relations financially when he could. His sister Elizabeth, married to Hugh Rose of Kilravock, administered his estate and was residuary legatee, and a collection of Clephane's papers are among those of the Roses of Kilravock at Register House, Edinburgh. William Hunter sent Elizabeth a copy of 'Medical Observations and Inquiries', praising Clephane's 'knowledge both natural and acquired' and 'his amiable and conciliating temper' that preserved harmony in the society (Innes, 462). Elizabeth may have given Clephane's medical papers to Hunter; they were later in the Hunterian Library, Glasgow University. Clephane is now mainly known as a correspondent of David Hume, through the publication of Hume's letters to him by J. H. Burton in his 'Life of David Hume' (1846). No letters from Clephane to Hume are known.

Clerisseau, Charles-Louis (bap. 1721, d. 1820), architect and architectural draughtsman, was baptized in Paris on 28 August 1721, the son of Jean Clerisseau, seller of perfumed gloves, and his wife, Jeanne Rosselet. By 1745 he was attending the Academie Royale d'Architecture as a pupil of the architect Gabriel-Germain Boffrand. In 1746 he won the grand prix, which led to three years' study in Rome as 'pensionnaire' of the Academie Francaise. He arrived in Italy in 1749, and stayed there until 1767. On 1 December 1763 he married Therese, daughter of the sculptor Pierre L'Estache ('c'.1688-1774). 
Clerisseau was one of a succession of young architects and artists in Rome who, since the early 1740s, had been sowing the seeds of neo-classicism. He found his metier (and lifelong bread and butter) in the production of views, mainly in gouache, of real or idealized classical ruins. His contacts included friendships with Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Johann Joachim Winckelmann. While in Italy he acted as architectural mentor to Sir William Chambers, and, more significantly, to Robert and James Adam, thus profoundly influencing the course of neo-classicism in Britain. His contact with Chambers, datable to between 1751 and 1754, is recorded only in a lost drawing, begun by Chambers and finished by Clerisseau, and some gossip from Robert Adam: 'I have also got acquaintance with one Clerisseau who draws in architecture delightfully in the free manner I wanted.' Chambers, he wrote, 'owes all hints and notions to this man with whom he differed and to whom he behaved ungratefully' (McCormick, 23). On arriving in Italy in 1755, Adam had placed himself entirely in Clerisseau's hands. Clerisseau both selected objects for study and taught Adam to draw in his characteristically picturesque manner. Adam saw that Clerisseau's draughtsmanship could be useful for the publications essential to future success. A plan for a revised edition of A.-B. Desgodetz's 'Edifices antiques de Rome' came to nothing, but in 1757, the year in which he left Italy, Adam engaged Clerisseau on a regular basis for the production of most of the drawings and the arrangements for engraving his 'Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian in Spalatro in Dalmatia', published in 1764. In 1760-61 James Adam also studied under Clerisseau. By this time Robert's relationship with Clerisseau had turned from one of admiring friendship to that of employer and employee -- Clerisseau was refused extra money and proper recognition for his work on 'Spalatro'. 
In 1767 Clerisseau left for France, and in 1769, as 'painter of architecture', became a member of the Academie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. In 1771 he moved to Britain, according to Edward Edwards at the invitation of Robert Adam, but also perhaps to be nearer the British patrons who were the principal admirers of his pictures. He exhibited four pictures, a bath and a sepulchral chamber 'composed after the manner of the Ancients', a view of the Forum of Nerva, and a triumphal arch, at the Royal Academy in 1772 (when living at Great Marlborough Street) and also exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1775, 1776, and 1790. Of design activities there is less evidence. There are drawings of ornament (RIBA) made by pupils, perhaps those of Robert Adam, but corrected by Clerisseau. In 1774 he designed for Lansdowne House (an Adam project) a gallery (not executed), and an aedicule for the garden. Although his movements after 1771 are uncertain, Clerisseau was certainly back in Paris by 1775, where he carried out schemes of interior decoration. In 1775 he designed a 'Roman house' and a triumphal arch (unexecuted) for Catherine the Great, who made him her 'premier architecte'. The Russian designs are among the 1170 Clerisseau drawings bought by Catherine (The Hermitage, St Petersburg). The next largest collection is at Sir John Soane's Museum, London. In 1778 he designed his only major executed building, the Palais de Justice at Metz. In 1815 he was made a member of the Legion d'honneur, but his last twenty-five years were inactive. He died at his home, 14 rue Moliere, Auteuil, outside Paris, on 19 January 1820, leaving an exceptional architectural library. Clerisseau's difficult character and proud and prickly behaviour while doing business may account for the failure of many of his schemes.

Clerk, Sir George, of Penicuick, sixth baronet (1787-1867), politician, was the elder son of James Clerk of the East India Company and his wife, Janet, daughter of George Irving of Newton, Lanarkshire, and grandson of Sir George Clerk Maxwell; he was born on 19 November 1787, and educated at the high school, Edinburgh, and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he was admitted on 21 January 1806. His father died in 1793, and in 1798 he succeeded his uncle, Sir John Clerk, as the sixth baronet. He was admitted an advocate in 1809, and created a DCL of Oxford on 5 July 1810. At a by-election in July 1811, supported by the Melville family interest, he was elected MP for Midlothian (Edinburghshire), for which he sat until 1832. From a family strongly tory, Clerk was on 5 March 1819 appointed one of the lords of the Admiralty in the Liverpool administration. He held this post until May 1827, when he became clerk of the ordnance. He was gazetted one of the council of the duke of Clarence, the lord high admiral, on 4 February 1828, but upon the duke's resignation was reappointed a lord of the Admiralty. On 5 August 1830 he became under-secretary for the Home department for the few remaining months of the Wellington administration. 
At the first general election after the passing of the 'Reform Bill', which took place in December 1832, Clerk lost his seat for Midlothian, being defeated by Sir John Dalrymple, the whig candidate, by 601 to 536. He was re-elected, however, in January 1835 for his old constituency, but at the next general election, in August 1837, was defeated by William Gibson Craig. In April of the following year he was elected unopposed for the borough of Stamford, which he also represented in the succeeding parliament. In July 1847 Clerk was returned for Dover -- despite opposition from an extreme protestant -- but, after unsuccessfully contesting that constituency in July 1852 and March 1857, made no further attempt to re-enter parliament. He held the post of secretary to the Treasury in Sir Robert Peel's administration from December 1834 to April 1835, and from September 1841 to February 1845. On 5 February 1845 he was appointed vice-president of the Board of Trade, and was at the same time sworn of the privy council. In the same month he was made master of the Royal Mint on the retirement of W. E. Gladstone. Clerk held both these offices until July 1846, when Sir Robert Peel's second administration came to an end. For many years he was an able and zealous supporter of the tory party, and particularly of Peel, a friend from his Oxford days. He was an earlier convert to free trade than the majority of his party ('Hansard 3', 83.1420-39), and continued to belong to the Peelite section until it was finally broken up. 
On 13 August 1810 Clerk married Maria (died 7 Sept 1866), second daughter of Ewan Law of Horsted Place, Sussex, with whom he had eight sons and four daughters. He was president of the Zoological Society 1862-7, FRS, chairman of the Royal Academy of Music, an elder of the Church of Scotland, and a deputy lieutenant of Midlothian. He died on 23 December 1867, at Penicuik House, near Edinburgh, in his eighty-first year. He was succeeded in the title by his eldest son, James; James Clerk Maxwell was his great-nephew.

Clerk, Sir George Russell (1800-1889), administrator in India, was born at Worting House, Hampshire, in 1800, the eldest son of John Clerk (1759-1842) and his wife, Anne (died 1820), daughter of Carew Mildmay of Shawford House, Hampshire. In 1815 he was nominated to the Bengal civil service and entered the East India Company's college at Haileybury. 
Clerk arrived in Bengal in February 1818 and initially appeared destined for a career in the secretariat; as early as 1822 he was first assistant to the secretary in the secret and political department. Some time in the 1820s, however, he began an affair with Mary, wife of Colonel Stewart, but was unable to marry her until Stewart died some years later. When Calcutta society refused to receive Mary, Clerk, who had been disinherited by his father over the affair, opted for a career on Bengal's far-flung western frontier. 
In 1829 Clerk became first assistant to the resident in Delhi; in 1831, political agent at Ambala; in March 1840, agent to the governor-general for the affairs of the Punjab; and, finally, in October 1842, envoy to the court of Lahore. He effectively controlled British relations with Lahore from 1831 until 1843, and, in contrast to Auckland's pro-Afghanistan policy, advocated the construction of a strong Sikh buffer state in the Punjab to break what he saw as the chain of Islam running from central Asia to Hindustan. 
In 1843 Clerk was appointed lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces. Distrustful of the social-engineering objectives of the utilitarians, he briefly interrupted the levelling land revenue policies then in vogue in the North-Western Provinces, before being promoted in November 1844 to a seat on the executive council in Calcutta. In January 1847 he was appointed governor of Bombay, but was forced by ill health to retire early the following year. 
Back in England, Clerk declined the governorship of the Cape of Good Hope, but went instead to South Africa in 1853 as a commissioner to negotiate the boundaries of the Orange Free State. In 1857 he became secretary of the India board and in 1858 permanent under-secretary of state for India. In May 1860 he again accepted the governorship of Bombay but two years later, as before, was compelled by ill health to resign. In 1863 he was appointed to the secretary of state's council for India, which position he retained until his retirement in 1876. 
Clerk was a Conservative, who trusted to experience and common sense rather than political theorizing. He disapproved, on both financial and moral grounds, of the annexations of Sind, the Punjab, and Oudh, arguing that the rebellion of 1857 was largely the result of Britain breaking faith with her former allies. He disliked evangelicalism and was scathing about missionary hopes of universal Christianization. 
Clerk was made a KCB in 1848, KCSI in 1861, and GCSI in 1866. He died at his home, 33 Elm Park Gardens, Middlesex, on 25 July 1889 and was buried at Bournemouth. He was survived by his three sons: the eldest, Claude, who was born in 1833 and became tutor to the nizam of Hyderabad; General Sir Godfrey Clerk (1835-1908); and Colonel John Clerk (died 1919). Mary Clerk had died in 1878.

Clerk, John (1481/2?-1541), diplomat and bishop of Bath and Wells, was probably one of several sons of Clement Clerk of Much Livermere, Suffolk, and very likely the John Clerk of Norwich diocese dispensed in 1501 to hold a benefice despite being aged only nineteen. 
Having graduated BA from Cambridge in 1498, and MA in 1502, Clerk went to study law at Bologna, where he became a doctor of canon law in 1510 (he was generally, and probably rightly, credited with the doctorate of both laws). He took service in the household of Cardinal Bainbridge at Rome, and was briefly chamberlain of the English Hospice in Rome, but returned to England after the cardinal's death in 1514. Having transferred to the service of Cardinal Wolsey, he was appointed dean of the Chapel Royal in 1516, and by now had a clutch of parochial benefices as well, though it is not always possible to be certain that a benefice held by one of the many John Clerks was actually held by him. He certainly held the rectories of Rothbury, Northumberland (1512-23); Portishead, Somerset (1513-19); Ditcheat, Somerset (resigned by 1519); Ivychurch, Kent (1514-23); and South Molton, Devon (1519-23). To these he added the archdeaconry of Colchester and the deanery of St George's, Windsor, in 1519. 
John Clerk occupied a prominent place in English politics throughout the chancellorship of Cardinal Wolsey, to whose patronage he owed his choicer ecclesiastical preferments, including, as he later remarked with gratitude, his promotion as bishop of Bath and Wells in 1523. At first his role was essentially that of the confidential intermediary between the king and the cardinal. In 1519 he was appointed a judge in Star Chamber, and he would often figure as judge or arbitrator thereafter, for example between the marquess of Dorset and Lord Hastings in 1527. Indeed, for just under a year, from 20 October 1522, he was master of the rolls. But it was as a diplomat that he found his metier. In 1519 he embarked upon the first of many missions, dispatched back to Rome (and 'en route' putting in an appearance at the court of Louise of Savoy). Attendance at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520 was perhaps hardly diplomacy of the highest order, but in his second mission, once more to Rome (1521-2), he was entrusted with the prestigious task of presenting to Pope Leo X a fine copy of Henry VIII's refutation of Luther, the 'Assertio septem sacramentorum', with verses personally inscribed by the king. The ceremony itself, on 2 October 1521, was in secret consistory rather than in the glare of publicity for which he had hoped. But he made the best of it, and marked the occasion with a lengthy oration which was subsequently printed and bound with the 'Assertio' when it was generally released early next year. 
Clerk's third mission to Rome followed in 1523-5. At an early stage he was provided to the see of Bath and Wells, succeeding his patron, Wolsey, and took advantage of the opportunity to be consecrated bishop in Rome itself in 1523. Having left Rome in December 1525, he served as ambassador at the French court from July 1526 to September 1527, and again from March to November 1528. John Clerk was manifestly an able and effective diplomat. The frequency with which he served in this capacity is perhaps sufficient testimony, but to this we can add the quality of his dispatches, which were regular and packed with information. Moreover, he got results. Henry VIII was delighted with the papal title 'Fidei defensor' which Clerk wheedled out of Leo X (and preserved through Leo's death and the election of his successor, Adrian VI). And he continued to serve his patron as well as his king. It was Clerk who secured the series of bulls in the early 1520s which conceded to Wolsey unprecedented powers as papal legate in England. 
Clerk's political career was stopped in its tracks by the king's Great Matter. Despite the lead of his patron and the example of most of his colleagues in the cardinal's service, Clerk affiliated himself at an early stage to the camp of Katherine of Aragon. When Henry VIII was trying to win over Sir Thomas More to his cause, the king gave More some papers to guide his thoughts, and then suggested that Clerk and Cuthbert Tunstall should look over them with him. Although this has been interpreted as meaning that Clerk and Tunstall were intended to persuade More, the latter's subsequent excuse to the king, that neither he nor the others were really competent to judge of the issues raised, shows that all three were in the same boat, as men whom Henry wished to have on his side. Both Tunstall and Clerk were to be among the counsel appointed for Queen Katherine in the tribunal which convened at Blackfriars in 1529 to adjudicate on the validity of the marriage. For the tribunal itself Clerk composed a treatise on the queen's behalf, but it is not known to have survived -- Clerk himself and More are known to have burnt copies. Clerk's involvement in the divorce proceedings was not limited to his evident contacts with More. His chaplain was in contact with Queen Katherine via the latter's almoner, and he also discussed the case with John Fisher. When the opinions of foreign universities were presented to the House of Lords in 1531, and Henry's advisers spoke in their support, Clerk made a formal protest. And finally, when in April 1533 convocation was asked to deliberate on whether or not the pope had power to dispense for marriages such as Henry's, Clerk was one of the few who dared vote in favour of papal authority. This consistent record of opposition is enough to render entirely incredible earlier suggestions that he assisted Cranmer in producing works on the divorce and the supremacy. 
Clerk paid literally as well as metaphorically for his temerity in opposing the king. His obvious loss of favour is reflected in the fact that no further use could be found for his manifest diplomatic talents in the 1530s. When in autumn 1529 Henry VIII pushed three bills through parliament encroaching upon ecclesiastical privilege, Clerk joined Fisher and Nicholas West of Ely in appealing to the pope against these statutes -- and was briefly imprisoned with them for his pains. Not only did his diocese contribute substantially to the $100,000 subsidy which convocation had voted to the king in January 1531, but later that year Clerk himself was mulcted of $700 for the escape of seven prisoners from the episcopal gaol -- the conventional penalty but one usually remitted. 
There were limits to Clerk's resistance. He bowed to pressure in 1533, and not only attended the coronation of Anne Boleyn himself, but joined with Gardiner and Tunstall in urging Thomas More to do likewise (in vain). He and the canons of Wells subscribed to the royal supremacy on 6 July 1534. Having signed a formal renunciation of papal authority on 10 February 1535, he was assiduous thereafter in enforcing the royal supremacy. He even wrote to Cromwell to excuse one of his canons, who through a slip of the tongue had prayed for Katherine of Aragon instead of Anne Boleyn -- though this should also be seen as a sign of the fear and anxiety which then prevailed: Clerk was obviously concerned as much to protect his own back as his canon's. He also found it expedient to offer Cromwell a pension on one of his best manors as a Christmas present. Cromwell clearly had a complete ascendancy over Clerk, whose letters to Cromwell are abject and subservient. Cromwell and Henry VIII picked some of Clerk's ecclesiastical plums in the later 1530s. Not only did Henry take away the gift of the archdeaconry of Wells in 1537, but he also forced Cromwell upon him as dean of Wells -- the appointment of Cromwell as a lay dean must have stuck in Clerk's throat. Clerk's brother Thomas turned the situation to his advantage. Soon after Cromwell's appointment as dean, Thomas Clerk is found described as a servant of Cromwell, and he acquired a respectable share of former monastic property. John Clerk, though, found himself on the wrong end of redistribution, as Henry took a bite out of the bishop's estates. Like many of his colleagues, Clerk was persuaded to surrender his London residence (Bath Place) into the king's hands, receiving in exchange the former convent of Franciscan nuns in Aldgate. 
For most of the 1520s Clerk was scarcely a model bishop. Fully occupied with diplomatic or conciliar business, he was not resident in his diocese, which he cannot be shown to have entered prior to September 1530. It was managed in his absence by administrators who had already grown accustomed to doing without their bishop for nearly twenty years. The temporalities of the diocese were from the start largely managed by Thomas Clerk, who accumulated a substantial position in Somerset, resided at an episcopal palace in Wookey, and, having served in Edward VI's first parliament as MP for Wells, died a wealthy esquire in 1555. Wolsey's political eclipse and John Clerk's personal commitment to the cause of Katherine of Aragon combined to cause the bishop to spend far more of his time in his diocese in the 1530s. Curiously, the surviving episcopal register for Clerk's episcopate terminates in June 1534, at just about the time when other sources show Clerk beginning to take a serious interest in his diocese. Rough notes kept by his vicar-general show Clerk conducting a thorough visitation of his diocese in July -- perhaps some sort of general stocktaking exercise. It looks as though Clerk was packed off to his diocese in 1534 primarily in order to oversee the enforcement of the oath to the succession, and with a general hint that there was no need for him to hurry back to London. Presumably a fresh register was commenced to mark the new diocesan regime, and it may have been lost because it remained with the bishop rather than at Wells: Clerk died away from his diocese. There is no reason to believe that the absence of a surviving register denotes administrative failings. Clerk's capacity was trusted enough for him to be put in charge of the ecclesiastical valuation of Somerset early in 1535, a task which he completed on time in September. Records survive of his visitation of Glastonbury Abbey in 1538, and the impression derived from the fragmentary documentation of his personal episcopate is that of a diligent pastor. 
Clerk's political marginalization in the 1530s was not helped by his well-known religious conservatism. He had made no secret of his contempt for Lutheran teachings in his oration to Leo X, and he was occasionally involved in heresy proceedings in England. Early in 1526 he was one of those bishops deputed by Wolsey to hear the case of Robert Barnes, one of whose answers in court so displeased Clerk that he colourfully told him he would see him fry for it (though he had to wait nearly fifteen years for this denouement). In April 1529 he took part in proceedings against John Tewkesbury, and he took cognizance of some accusations of heresy during his visitation in 1534. His general religious conservatism remained in evidence throughout the 1530s. He was one of the bishops who signed a statement in favour of pilgrimage, probably early in 1537 in the context of the preliminary discussions which were to lead towards the 'Bishops' Book' ('The Institution of a Christian Man'), during which he was noted by Alexander Alesius as speaking on the conservative side. However, although his name appears in the 'Bishops' Book', he had no direct role in its composition (when he wrote to Cromwell in October 1537 to thank him for sending a copy, it was evidently the first he had seen of it). In 1539 Clerk was involved in the passage of the 'Act of Six Articles', and in the same year he led a commission, with bishops Sampson of Chichester and Rugg of Norwich, to look into reports of heresy in Calais. 
The conservative backlash in religion which set in during 1539 marked not only the beginning of the end for Cromwell, but also a new political dawn for Clerk, whom the fiasco of the Cleves marriage in 1540 brought back to the centre of events. He was chosen to take the news of the annulment of that marriage to the duke of Cleves, hardly an easy mission -- Clerk himself remarked on the inconsistencies in the case against the marriage, but it was doubtless welcome for what it signified, namely Cromwell's fall. But the dawn proved false. Clerk fell ill at Dunkirk on his way back from Cleves, and made his will there on 27 September. There were the usual rumours of poison, but as one of his servants on the voyage had fallen ill and evidently later died, the less romantic explanation of infectious disease seems more probable. Clerk apparently expected to die soon, as he provided for burial at Calais. He bequeathed $180 for doles, obits, and masses for his soul, besides a 'remembraunce' of $100 for King Henry and gifts for bishops Tunstall and Gardiner. Clerk recovered enough to make the crossing to England, but he died in London on 3 January 1541 at his residence in Aldgate, and was buried in St Botolph's Church there.

Clerk, John (d. 1552), author, is of obscure early life and education; Anthony Wood claimed that he studied at the University of Oxford, but this is doubtful. Clerk was employed at Kenninghall as the tutor for Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, until the latter's residence in Windsor from about 1530, and remained with Surrey's father, the duke of Norfolk, as his secretary. Upon the duke's imprisonment in 1546 Clerk appears to have searched for another patron, dedicating a portion of his work to Charles Stourton. Clerk was apparently conservative in matters of religion, 'an open enemy to the gospel and all godly preachers' according to martyrologist John Foxe ('Acts and Monuments', 8.634) although Bale simply calls him 'pius ac christiane doctus' ('learned in matters of the faith'; Bale, 'Index', 193). 
Clerk's works are largely showcases for his linguistic ability, and document his search for patronage. His translation from the French of a Spanish treatise on courtly behaviour, 'Lamant mal traicte de samye' (1543?), dedicated to Surrey, acknowledges Surrey's own skill as a translator while advertising Clerk's facility in capturing 'thintencion of thauthor'. Better known is his 'Opusculum plane divinum de mortuorum resurrectione et extremo juditio' (1545). In this Catholic redaction of biblical accounts of the general resurrection of the dead and the last judgment Clerk urges Christians to ensure their salvation by performing the traditional corporal works of mercy described in 'Matthew'. Unlike a growing number of his reformist contemporaries, who saw in Rome's primacy signs of the approaching second coming of Christ, Clerk asserts only that, since the time of the parousia is unknown, all Christians should heed the gospel admonition to be prepared. A second edition followed in 1547, shorn of the dedication to Surrey (recently executed for treason) but containing a set of grammatical tables in French and Italian, and dedicated to Stourton, a young aristocrat perhaps as much in need of a tutor as Clerk was of a patron. 
In 1552 Clerk was examined by the council for 'lewd prophecies and slanders' and books of necromancy found in his rooms. He was sent to join his former patron the duke of Norfolk in the Tower, where he committed suicide by hanging himself, on 10 May 1552.

Clerk, Sir John, of Penicuik, second baronet (1676-1755), politician and antiquary, was born at Edinburgh on 8 February 1676, the second child and eldest son of Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, first baronet (1649/50-1722), landowner and coal owner, and his first wife, Elizabeth Hendersone, who died aged twenty-five leaving seven children. With his second wife the first Sir John had a further nine children. Clerk's merchant grandfather, John Clerk (1611-1674), had bought the estate of Penicuik, Edinburghshire, and the first baronet had developed the coal reserves there. Clerk was educated at Penicuik parish school and Glasgow University, before being sent for legal study to Leiden in the Netherlands. After three years there, during which he developed considerable skill on the harpsichord and became a close friend of Herman Boerhaave, he went on a two-year European tour. He spent considerable periods of time in Vienna, Rome, and Paris, and acquired an enthusiasm for Italian music and Roman antiquities. 
On returning to Scotland, Clerk was admitted advocate in 1700, and on 23 February 1701 married Lady Margaret Stewart, eldest daughter of the third earl of Galloway. She died in childbirth within the year, leaving him with a son who died aged twenty-one. The marriage brought Clerk into politics as a firm supporter of the proposed Hanoverian succession and an adherent of the Church of Scotland. He represented Whithorn in the Scottish parliament (1703-7), a constituency under the control of his father-in-law, and came into the political circle of the second duke of Queensberry. In 1703-4 Clerk served on a commission to examine the public accounts; he was one of a small group who made a thorough investigation into the leakage of public money, and he wrote the commission's report. He thus gained a reputation for public finance, which led to his appointment in 1706 as one of the thirty-one Scottish commissioners for the treaty of union with England. His 'Memoirs' (not published until 1892) are one of the few historical sources for the treaty negotiations. It was Clerk who checked the calculation for the Equivalent, the recompense to be paid to Scotland for accepting the burden of a share in the interest payments on the English national debt. He served as one of the Scottish members for the first parliament of Great Britain in 1707, and was involved in the transfer to Scotland of the exchequer bills for the Equivalent and the return of the retired notes. He retired from politics in 1708, having been appointed a baron of the newly created court of the exchequer in Scotland, a semi-sinecure which gave him $500 a year. His second marriage, on 15 November 1709, was to Janet Inglis (died 1760), daughter of Sir John Inglis of Cramond, baronet; they had nine sons, including John Clerk of Eldin (1728-1812), naval writer, and seven daughters. 
Clerk inherited the family estate and the baronetcy in 1722. His income, talents, interests, and occupation gave him opportunities for cultured leisure activities. He improved his estate, planting trees and modernizing the tenancies, gave advice to landed neighbours on their coalmines, and designed and commissioned the construction of a new house, Mavisbank, at Loanhead, Edinburghshire. Clerk wrote and played music, and cultivated literary figures, the most notable of whom was the poet Allan Ramsay (1686-1758). Clerk was one of the earliest and most constant patrons of Ramsay, who used to spend a portion of each summer under his roof. The premature death of Clerk's first son in 1722 was made the occasion for an elegy by Ramsay. After the poet's death an obelisk was erected in his memory at Penicuik. 
Clerk followed up his enthusiasm for Roman remains and the classics with excavations, and made a collection of Roman finds. At Penicuik House he accumulated a valuable collection of antiquities, which brought him membership of the Society of Antiquaries in 1727. He served on the board of trustees for manufactures from its start, was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1729, and was also president of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society. He died on 4 October 1755, at Penicuik House, and was succeeded as third baronet by his son James (died 1782). From 1760 James began the redesign of Penicuik in the Palladian style. 
Sir John Clerk published a number of works on political and antiquarian themes, and many other writings were still in manuscript form at his death. 'An Essay upon the Intended Limitations' (1703) was a response to criticisms of the union with England; and it was followed by two further pamphlets, 'A Letter to a Friend Giving an Account of how the Treaty of Union has been Received' (1706) and 'An Essay upon the XV. Article of the Treaty of Union' (1706). A manuscript entitled 'Observations on the present circumstances of Scotland', comprising a balanced review of the economy, was first published by the Scottish History Society only in 1965 ('Miscellany', 10). With the chief baron of the exchequer he wrote 'A Historical View of the Forms and Powers of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland', published in 1820. Two short papers by Clerk also appeared in 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society': in 1731 'De stylis veterum et diversis chartarum generibus', and in 1738 'An account of the observation of the late solar eclipse made at Edinburgh on February 18th 1736-7'. In 1750 he published 'Dissertatio de monumentis quibusdam Romanis in Boreali Magnae Britanniae parte detectis anno MDCCXXI'. He wrote over many years a long Latin paper, 'De imperio Britannico', a history of English-Scottish relations. It was summarized and translated and published for the Scottish Historical Society in 1973. His musical compositions, mostly pieces for chamber orchestra, almost entirely remain in manuscript. 
Clerk's 'Memoirs' give a view of the culture of Scottish landed society, especially at the time of the union with England; they also provide perceptive comments on the economy. Although not published until 1892, the editor noted that 'the passages, in particular, which deal with his two interviews with Queen Anne, if they want the dignity of formal history... bring us close to the time and the scenes' ('Memoirs', 15).

Clerk, John, of Eldin (1728-1812), naval writer, was born at Penicuik, Edinburghshire, on 10 December 1728, the seventh son of Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, second baronet (1676-1755), politician and antiquary, and his second wife, Janet, 'nee' Inglis (died 1760). His wealthy family background encouraged an open-minded attitude. He was educated at Dalkeith grammar school and started medical studies at Edinburgh University, though he did not complete them. He entered the world of business, and in 1733 there was a mention of him as a merchant in Edinburgh. He was also involved in the coalmining industry and showed considerable interest in geology, which he studied at university with a fellow student, James Hutton. A true child of the Enlightenment, Clerk was also active in the mid-eighteenth-century Edinburgh elite, including Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, Hugh Blair, and David Hume. In 1753 he married Susannah, the daughter of William Adam of Maryburgh and the youngest sister of the architects Robert, John, Adam, and William. John and Susannah had four daughters and a son, John Clerk, Lord Eldin. 
Clerk displayed a passion for harbours and shipbuilding in his youth. His interest in the navy grew in the 1770s when he had frequent contact with Captain Alexander Edgar, who had taken part with John Byng in the battle of Minorca (1756). The American War of Independence was the actual starting point of his work on naval tactics. He improved his knowledge of major battles by reading histories, newspaper articles, and logbooks which enabled him to reconstruct battles. He then put his analyses to the test with the aid of cork models floated on water, an original method distinct from the abstract conceptions favoured by French tacticians such as Bigot de Morogues and Bourde de la Villehuet. In the late 1770s Clerk spoke of his work to Richard Atkinson, a friend and secretary to Admiral George Rodney. In an account written in 1804 Clerk also claimed he had given a memorandum to Rodney advising him on the tactical devices he might employ. Disappointed not to see his ideas implemented, Clerk decided to publish his research himself. He was further stimulated by the British defeat at Yorktown when a larger home force lost to the strategy of the French navy. 
In 1790 Clerk published part one of 'An Essay on Naval Tactics'. The study was distinctive as one of the first British accounts of tactics, as opposed to a work in French translation, and for its criticism of the current Royal Naval practice of looking more to signal books to the detriment of fighting instructions. Clerk's focus on practical tactics, developed during the course of the 1790s, sought to redress this habit; parts two, three, and four of the 'Essay' were published in 1797. 
Clerk died on 10 May 1812. After his death there arose a tremendous controversy regarding the true origin of the manoeuvre he is said to have devised: an attack on the enemy's lee side and breakthrough of their battle line, as Admiral Rodney had done at the battle of the Saints (12 April 1782). In an article published in the 'Quarterly Review' (1829) Howard Douglas, the son of Rodney's flag officer, Sir Charles Douglas, maintained that his father, not Clerk, had invented this tactic. The claim triggered a response from Clerk's supporters in the 'Edinburgh Review' (1830), where it was alleged that Rodney and Douglas had read Clerk's report, passed on by Richard Atkinson, on the morning of the battle. In 1832 Howard Douglas asked why the first part of Clerk's 'Essay' had not included a reference to the manoeuvre, and accused Clerk of appropriating Rodney's innovation as his own and of plagiarizing Paul Hoste's 'Art des armees navales' (1697). Clerk himself had maintained in 1804 that his ideas were not fully developed at the time of the battle of the Saints, and that his thinking had not finally come together until the late 1790s, when he published details of the manoeuvre. 
Clerk's abilities as a tactician may have been overrated by friends and disputed by his critics. Nevertheless, he remains an author of the highest order, who attempted to understand manoeuvres while looking for effective ways to bring the battle to a decisive conclusion. Clerk's 'Essay' certainly helped to inspire a later generation of naval officers, notably Admiral Adam Duncan at the decisive battle of Camperdown (11 October 1797), and was subsequently translated into French, Portuguese, Russian, and Dutch.

Clerk, John, Lord Eldin (1757-1832), judge, was born in April 1757, the eldest son of John Clerk of Eldin (1728-1812), the author of 'An Essay on Naval Tactics', and his wife, Susannah Adam, sister of the celebrated Adam brothers, the architects. Though originally intended for the Indian Civil Service, he was apprenticed to a writer of the signet. His interest as a young man in debating and essaying upon literary, philosophical, and political topics can be inferred from his election to the recently established Speculative Society of Edinburgh during its 1777-8 session. He appears to have been an active member and was elected a president for the 1782-3 session. After serving his articles he practised for a year or two as an accountant, and eventually was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 3 December 1785. 
Clerk soon made his mark at the bar, where he acquired so extensive a practice that, it is said, at one period of his career he had nearly half the business of the court in his hands. As a pleader he was remarkable, both for his acuteness and for his marvellous powers of reasoning, as well as for his fertility of resource. Possessed of a rough, sarcastic humour, he delighted in ridiculing the bench, and was in the habit of saying whatever he liked to the judges without reproof. When appearing as defence counsel for the co-accused in the sensational trial of Deacon William Brodie in 1788, he gained notoriety for his intemperate exchanges with the trial judge, Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield. On another celebrated occasion, probably between 1819 and 1823, after a prolonged wrangle, he was compelled by the court to apologize to Sir William Miller, Lord Glenlee, for a fiery retort. Even then, the apology was scornful: 'since 'your Lordships insist upon't', I now make an apology to Lord Glenlee, IN RESPECT OF YOUR LORDSHIPS' COMMANDS!!' ('Journal', 2.210). Apart from the trial of Deacon Brodie, his other prominent court appearances included appearing for the defence alongside his fellow advocates Francis Jeffrey and Henry Cockburn in the so-called state trials for sedition in 1817. 
In politics Clerk was a keen whig. He made a notable contribution to the movement for burgh reform in the 1780s, serving on the standing committee which promoted (unsuccessfully) two parliamentary bills which addressed the reform of burgh government and parliamentary representation. On 11 March 1806 he was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland in the Grenville administration, where he played a leading role alongside Henry Erskine, the lord advocate, in attempting to reform the moribund court of session, sponsoring a radical parliamentary bill in 1807. Although the attempt failed owing to the fall of the ministry, it enshrined principles which provided the basis of the reforms of the subsequent two decades. 
Clerk's practice at the bar had been for some time falling off, and his health had already begun to fail, when on 10 November 1823 he was appointed an ordinary lord of session in the place of William Macleod Bannatyne, Lord Bannatyne. Assuming the title Lord Eldin, he took his seat on the bench on 22 November. As a judge he was not a success; his temperament was not a judicial one, and his poor health rendered him unfit for the office. After five years of judicial work he resigned in 1828, and was succeeded by John Fullerton, Lord Fullerton. 
Clerk had a considerable taste for fine arts, and occasionally amused himself in drawing and modelling. In appearance he was remarkably plain, and paid no attention to his dress. One of his legs was shorter than the other, leading to the anecdote that when walking down High Street one day from the court of session he overheard a young lady saying to her companion rather loudly, 'There goes Johnnie Clerk, the lame lawyer.' Upon which he turned round and said, 'No, madam, I may be a lame man, but not a lame lawyer.' Henry Cockburn remembered his 'very bushy eyebrows, coarse grizzly hair, always in disorder, and firm projecting features', which 'made his face and head not unlike that of a thorough-bred shaggy terrier' (Cockburn, 'Life of Lord Jeffrey', 1.200). He also described him as 'honest, warm-hearted, generous and simple' (ibid.) but suffering from 'infantine self-deification' (ibid., 1.201). His consulting room was overrun by his collection of art, literature, and animals: 'all manner of trash, dead and living, and all in confusion' (ibid., 1.204). 
Clerk died unmarried at his house in Picardy Place, Edinburgh, on 30 May 1832. His collection of pictures and prints was sold by auction at his house in March 1833, a serious accident occurring when the floor gave way. It is reputed that the sale lasted fourteen days owing to the immense size of the collection.

Clerk, Josiah (bap. 1639?, d. 1714), physician, may have been the son of Josias Clerk baptized at Romford, Essex, on 4 January 1639. He was educated at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, and was admitted as a pensioner of Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 1 May 1656, and took the two degrees in medicine, MB in 1661, MD on 3 July 1666. He was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians on 26 June 1671, a fellow on 29 July 1675, and was appointed censor in 1677 and 1692. On the death of Sir Thomas Witherley he was named elect on 16 April 1694, delivered the Harveian oration in 1708, was consiliarius in 1707, 1709, 1710, 1711, and 1712, and was elected to the presidentship, void by the death of Dr Edward Browne, on 13 September 1708, being re-elected at the general election of officers on the 30th of the same month. Clerk 'being indisposed by many bodyly infirmityes, and also aged', was unable to act; he accordingly resigned on 18 December, and Charles Goodall was appointed on 23 December 1708. Clerk had been chosen treasurer on 16 April 1708, and retained that office as long as he lived. Clerk died at his house in Fenchurch Street, London, in the autumn of 1714, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. In the annals of the college cited by Munk the date of Clerk's death is given as 8 December, which is erroneous. His will (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/542/188) was proved on 14 October. He desired 'to be decently, tho' very privately, buried by night in the vault in St. Olave Hart Street Church, where my honoured mother and my children lye, if it may be done with conveniency'. He was survived by his wife, Abigail, and their daughter, Elizabeth, who was married to Richard Wilshaw.

Clerk, Matthew (1659-1735), Presbyterian minister, was born near Kilrea, co. Derry, of parents who are unknown. His early years are obscure but he was an officer in Derry during the siege (1688-9), and received a bullet wound on the temple, leaving a sore, over which he wore a black patch to the end of his days. It was not until after the siege that he began his studies for the ministry. He was ordained in 1697 by the Route presbytery as minister of Kilrea and Boveedy, co. Derry. In 1721 he was the sole dissentient from the synod's 'charitable declaration', an attempt to reach a compromise with the minority of clergymen who opposed subscription to the Westminster confession of faith. Next year he, with two others, entered a strong protest against making any concessions to the non-subscribing party. This party attacked him in his own presbytery, but though the matter was referred to the synod the non-subscribers were too much occupied in defending themselves to proceed with it. Clerk's literary contribution to the controversy, 'A Letter from the Countrey, to a Friend in Belfast, with Respect to the Belfast Society' (1722), was the first on either side which appeared with the author's name. His friends considered his manner of writing not sufficiently grave in tone. 'I don't think', wrote Livingstone of Templepatrick to Wodrow on 23 June 1723, 'his reasoning faculty is despisable, but I wish it were equal to his diverting one, for I think he is one of the most comical old fellows that ever was' ('DNB'). 
On 29 April 1729 Clerk resigned his charge and emigrated to New Hampshire. On landing he found that James Macgregor, formerly minister of Aghadowey, and founder of the township of Londonderry on the Merrimac, had died on 5 March. He succeeded him as minister, and also engaged in educational work. Clerk had already been twice married, of which no details are known, and eventually married Macgregor's widow as his third wife. He was a strict vegetarian, but his abstemious diet did not subdue his violent tendencies. Among the anecdotes told of him is one of his criticizing St Peter: 'He only cut off a chiel's lug, and he ought to ha' split doun his heid' ('DNB'). Clerk died on 25 January 1735. He was carried to his grave by old comrades at the Derry siege.

Clerk, William (d. 1655), civil lawyer, was admitted as a scholar to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1605. By its statutes Trinity Hall was committed to the study of the civil law, which was derived from Roman law and governed ecclesiastical, maritime, and international affairs. Clerk was a fellow of the college from 1609 to 1634, taking the degrees of LLB in 1610 and LLD in 1629. In 1631 he published a pamphlet entitled 'An Epitome of Certaine Late Aspersions Cast at Civilians'. This was a contribution to the continuing defence of the civil law against the encroachments of the common lawyers, and aimed to refute criticisms of the civil law made in the preface to Sir John Davies's 'Primer report des cases & matters en ley' (1615). 
By the 1620s Clerk was seeking to become established as a practitioner in the civil law courts. In 1624 he was appointed as joint commissary of the exchequer and prerogative court of York, but never assumed the post. He obtained full membership of Doctors' Commons in 1629, and probably by 1634 had become official of the archdeacon of London. From 1635 until 1640 he was active as an advocate in the London courts, and was also appointed to a number of commissions for piracy. 
Although parliament abolished the ecclesiastical courts in 1646, there was still a need for the expertise of civil lawyers. From 1647 Clerk served as a judge in the court of admiralty, and was also president of Doctors' Commons. The outbreak of war with the Dutch in the spring of 1652 led to a considerable increase in the business being handled by the admiralty court, and in recognition of this Clerk's salary was set at $200 per annum. 
As a judge Clerk frequently had to deal with cases of international importance. The most celebrated of these was the trial of Don Pantaleone Sa, the brother of the Portuguese ambassador, for his involvement in the murder of an innocent bystander during a street disturbance. Don Pantaleone claimed he had authority to act as ambassador in his brother's absence, and thus had diplomatic privilege, even though the crime of which he was accused was against the law of nations. Clerk was one of a committee of six judges appointed to consider whether Don Pantaleone could be tried. The committee decided that a trial was permissible, and a special commission of three common law judges, three civil law judges, including Clerk, and three laymen was appointed to hear the case, with a mixed English and foreign jury. In spite of his claim to ambassadorial status Don Pantaleone was found guilty, and executed on 10 July 1654. 
Clerk was buried on 3 August 1655, and appears to have continued working until his death, which probably took place in London. He left a wife, Mary (died 1674), and a daughter, Elizabeth. His achievement was to help in keeping the civil law alive in the unsettled political conditions of the civil war and interregnum.

Maxwell, Sir George Clerk-, fourth baronet (1715-1784), agriculturist, was born at Edinburgh in October 1715, the second son of Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, second baronet (1676-1755), and Janet, daughter of Sir John Inglis of Cramond. He was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Leiden. From his father he received the lands of Drumcrieff in Annandale, and through his marriage to Dorothea Clerk-Maxwell, daughter of his uncle William and his wife, Agnes Maxwell, heiress of Middlebie, Dumfriesshire, he obtained the lands of Middlebie; he also adopted his wife's surname. They had five sons and four daughters. 
Clerk-Maxwell was king's remembrancer in the exchequer from 1761, a commissioner of the customs in Scotland from 1763, and a trustee for improving fisheries and manufactures in Scotland. He worked hard to promote the agricultural and commercial interests of the country. At Dumfries he set up a linen factory and he initiated a variety of projects for the mining of lead and copper in the county. In 1755 he sent two letters concerning the usual method used to treat wool to the trustees for the improvement of the fisheries and manufactures of Scotland, and these were published by the board in 1756. He was also author of a paper on shallow ploughing, published by the Philosophical Society in Edinburgh ('Essays and Observations', 3, 1774). A clever draughtsman, he etched a variety of views of Scotland. On the death of his elder brother in 1782, he succeeded to the baronetcy and estates of Penicuik. He died on 29 January 1784, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, John Clerk.

Maxwell, James Clerk (1831-1879), physicist, was born on 13 June 1831 at 14 India Street, Edinburgh, the second of the two children (a daughter died in infancy) of John Clerk Maxwell (1790-1856), landowner, and his wife, Frances (1792-1839), daughter of Robert Hodshon Cay of North Charlton, Northumberland, and his wife, Elizabeth. His father, the younger brother of Sir George Clerk, sixth baronet (1787-1867), took the name Maxwell as heir to the estate he inherited from two marriages between the Clerks of Penicuik and heiresses of the Maxwells of Middlebie. This estate consisted of farmland near Dalbeattie in Kirkcudbrightshire, and it was in the house Glenlair, built there by his father, that Maxwell spent his early years and where he later did much of his writing. 
At first educated privately at Glenlair Maxwell entered Edinburgh Academy in 1841, where some eccentricity of behaviour earned him the nickname Dafty from his contemporaries. There he established lifelong friendships with Lewis Campbell (who became his biographer) and Peter Guthrie Tait (his closest scientific correspondent). According to his own account his early interest in science was aroused by his delight in the forms of regular geometrical figures, his view of mathematics as the search for harmonious and beautiful shapes. Accompanying his father to meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Scottish Society of Arts during the winter of 1845-6, he became aware of the work of David Ramsay Hay, the Edinburgh decorative artist. Hay was engaged in studies which aimed to explain the harmony of the form of geometrical figures and the aesthetics of colour combinations by mathematical principles. At this time Hay was studying the forms of oval curves, stimulating Maxwell to develop an ingenious method of drawing ovals using string round pins placed at the foci, by analogy with the string property of the ellipse. Promoting his son's work, John Clerk Maxwell approached James David Forbes, professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University, who presented a paper by Maxwell to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in April 1846. Forbes remarked on the relation of these curves to the Cartesian ovals, prompting Maxwell to make a more formal study of ovals. 
Maxwell's interest in the study of colour was aroused when, in April 1847, he accompanied his uncle John Cay to the laboratory of William Nicol, inventor of the polarizing prism; this led him to investigate the chromatic effects of polarized light in crystals and strained glass, 'gorgeous entanglements of colour' as he described them in 1870 ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 2.563). 
In the autumn of 1847 Maxwell entered Edinburgh University, attending Sir William Hamilton's class in logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland's in mathematics, and Forbes's class in natural philosophy. He was impressed with Hamilton's lectures, which encouraged his abiding concern to establish the conceptual rationale of his physics by appeal to philosophical argument. Formal study helped to shape the direction of his own original investigations, largely pursued during the summer months spent at Glenlair. At the end of his first year he wrote a paper on analytical geometry, a comprehensive memoir on rolling curves, presented by Kelland to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. During the following two years he pursued his interest in the chromatic effects of polarized light, and Forbes's interest in the physics of materials helped to shape the scope of his systematic paper 'On the equilibrium of elastic solids' of 1850 (Niven, 1.30-73), written during his third session. This memoir, remarkable in its breadth of coverage and depth of analysis, is grounded on the mathematics of elastic bodies, with Maxwell mastering contemporary theory including major recent work by the Cambridge mathematician George Gabriel Stokes; it embraces the study of special cases of torsion and compression, and discussion of Sir David Brewster's work on induced double refraction in strained glass. 
During his third session at Edinburgh in 1849-50 Maxwell continued to follow the traditional broad Scottish course of study, attending classes in chemistry and moral philosophy, but soon began preparations to go up to Cambridge, settling on Peterhouse (where Tait was an undergraduate), though migrating to Trinity College after his first term. He arrived at Cambridge in October 1850 as an accomplished mathematician and physicist, recommended by Forbes to William Whewell, master of Trinity. In October 1851 he became one of the pupils of William Hopkins, the pre-eminent mathematical coach of the period. According to Tait, Hopkins was appalled at the disorder of Maxwell's mathematical reading but impressed with the breadth of his knowledge, and soon realized his extraordinary promise as a physicist. The Cambridge mathematical tripos emphasized mixed mathematics, including mechanics and the theory of gravitation, as well as geometrical and physical optics, including study of the wave theory of light, the subject of Stokes's lectures on hydrodynamics and optics which Maxwell attended in May 1853. In the summer of 1853 the strain of preparing for the examination occasioned 'a sort of brain fever', as Campbell described it (Campbell and Garnett, 170), an emotional and religious crisis which reinforced a contemplative dimension to his thought, a view of science inspired by religious values. In the tripos examination in January 1854 Maxwell graduated second wrangler to Edward John Routh, but was bracketed equal Smith's prizeman with Routh in the examination for Smith's prizes which followed. He was unsuccessful at his first attempt to be elected a fellow of Trinity in 1854 (being weak in classics), but was elected in October 1855. It was at this time that he read Whewell's writings on the history and philosophy of the sciences. He later often made allusion to Whewell's notion of fundamental ideas, concepts whose negation could not be intelligibly conceived, in his emphasis on the non-empirical status of basic scientific principles. 
Trinity offered a wide range of friendships, and in the winter of 1852-3 Maxwell was elected a member of the Apostles club: the papers he presented on philosophical topics, including the philosophy of science, established him as a leading intellectual (as well as a recognized mathematician) among this select group. Along with some other members of his circle, including Richard Buckley Litchfield, he became active in Frederick Denison Maurice's Christian socialist movement, and taught classes for artisans in Cambridge, and later in Aberdeen and London. 
In February 1856, responding to his father's desire that he spend more time at Glenlair, Maxwell applied for the professorship of natural philosophy at Marischal College, Aberdeen, mustering an impressive clutch of testimonials. Even though his father died in April 1856 before the appointment was made, Maxwell decided to accept the post when it was offered, commencing his duties in Aberdeen with an inaugural lecture on 3 November 1856, emphasizing, in Cambridge style, the basis of physical explanation in the application of the laws of motion, but also stressing the religious value of natural philosophy and its role within the Scottish curriculum. He devoted considerable effort to his teaching in Aberdeen, introducing elements of mathematical physics to his more advanced students. 
On 2 June 1858 Maxwell married Katherine Mary Dewar (1824-1886), daughter of the Revd Daniel Dewar, principal of Marischal College. The marriage, which was childless, was not popular among his family. He and his wife were united by shared Christian commitment (he served as an elder of the Church of Scotland). In 1860, following the recommendation of the parliamentary commissioners that King's and Marischal colleges be joined to form the University of Aberdeen, with a single class and professor in each subject, he was made redundant. By this time he was a candidate for Forbes's post at Edinburgh, but Tait was appointed. However, in July 1860 he was appointed professor of natural philosophy at King's College, London, a post he held, living at 8 Palace Gardens Terrace, Kensington, until his resignation in March 1865. His study of engineering structures developed from his teaching at King's College; his work on graphical analysis and reciprocal diagrams in statics led to the award of the Keith prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1869-71. 
In the summer of 1849, while Maxwell was still a student at Edinburgh, Forbes introduced him to experiments on colour mixing. These consisted in observing the hues generated by adjustable coloured sectors fitted to a rapidly spinning disc, using tinted papers supplied by D. R. Hay, whose 'Nomenclature of Colours' (1845) exhibited an elaborate system of colour plates which distinguished variations in colour. Maxwell's approach to colour vision was shaped by the attempts by Hay and Forbes to provide a nomenclature for the classification of colours; by Forbes's method of experimentation and his use of a triangle of colours to represent colour combinations; and by the work of another Edinburgh acquaintance, George Wilson, on the problem of colour blindness. In the early 1850s the study of colour vision was significantly advanced in major papers by Hermann Helmholtz and Hermann Grassmann, work which Maxwell absorbed into his own theory in 1854-5. 
Maxwell adopted Thomas Young's three-receptor theory of colour vision; his claim that red, green, and violet should be considered the primary constituents of white light; the suggestion by Young and John Herschel that John Dalton's insensibility to red light was caused by the absence of one of the three receptors; and Young's colour diagram, with red, green, and violet placed at the vertices of a triangle, points within the triangle representing colour combinations. Maxwell showed that this depiction of colour combinations was equivalent to their representation by loaded points on Isaac Newton's circle of seven principal colours with white at the centre, and that colour combinations could also be expressed in terms of variables of spectral colour, degree of saturation, and intensity of illumination. 
In his 1855 paper 'Experiments on colour, as perceived by the eye' (Niven, 1.126-54) Maxwell extended Forbes's experiments, devising a spinning top in which a second set of coloured sectors of smaller diameter was added, enabling accurate colour comparisons to be made, and obtaining quantitative colour equations which could be manipulated algebraically. He confirmed Forbes's observation that green did not result from spinning yellow and blue coloured papers, in accordance with Helmholtz's finding that green was not obtained by the mixture of spectral yellow and blue. This challenged the identity of the mixing rule for lights and pigments, supposed by Newton. The paper concluded with observations made by colour deficient observers. 
In colorimetry Maxwell had established quantitative techniques and a unified theory, but he sought to make more accurate measurements, devising a series of colour boxes in which spectral red, green, and blue were mixed in varying proportions and directly compared with white light. These researches included a study of the variations of colour sensitivity across the retina, the investigation of the yellow spot on the retina, and the projection of the first trichromatic colour photograph in a lecture at the Royal Institution, London, in May 1861. This work led to the award of the Royal Society's Rumford medal in 1860, following the submission of his paper 'On the theory of compound colours' to the 'Philosophical Transactions' (Niven, 1.410-44) and his appointment to read the paper as the society's Bakerian lecturer. As he was not -- until May 1861 -- a fellow of the Royal Society, he was found to be ineligible for this appointment. 
Maxwell made important contributions to geometrical optics in the 1850s. Developing a theorem due to Roger Cotes, he developed a new approach to the theory of optical instruments in which theorems expressing geometrical relations between an object and image were separated from discussion of the dioptrics of lenses. This approach was subsequently developed independently by Ernst Abbe; these methods became standard. In 1873-4 he generalized his mathematical method, appealing to concepts of projective geometry, and developed William Rowan Hamilton's idea of the characteristic function as a method of investigating lens systems. 
In March 1855 the subject of the University of Cambridge's Adams prize for 1857 was advertised as a study of 'The motions of Saturn's rings'. This was a problem in dynamics within the Cambridge tradition of mixed mathematics; indeed, Whewell had set a Smith's prize question in 1854 requiring candidates to show that Saturn's rings were not rigid bodies, but possibly fluid. In his classic study on the rings of Saturn Pierre Simon Laplace had established that the motion of a uniform solid ring would be dynamically unstable, while Joseph Plateau had recently suggested that Saturn's rings could be formed from the rotation of a fluid. The problem of Saturn's rings was of current interest to astronomers: in 1850 George Bond had noticed a dark ring interior to the two familiar bright rings, and Otto Struve had claimed that this ring was a new formation. 
Maxwell's prizewinning essay ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 1.438-79), completed in December 1856, was divided into two parts: on the motion of a rigid ring, and on the motion of a fluid ring or a ring consisting of loose materials. The argument rested on potential theory, Taylor's theorem, and Fourier analysis; to establish the conditions of stability of the rings he devised a mathematical method that was acclaimed by George Biddell Airy, the astronomer royal, in his review of the published memoir. He was to employ the same method in establishing stability conditions in his paper 'On governors' in 1868 (Niven, 2.105-20). 
With regard to Saturn's rings, Maxwell began with the work of Laplace, concluding that a solid ring would only be stable if it was so irregular as to be inconsistent with the observed appearance of the rings. In the essay submitted for the prize he argued that if the rings were in motion they could be fluid, with waves in the fluid in the plane of the rings, and he considered the effect of disturbing causes such as the friction of the rings and gravitational irregularities, concluding that the ring system could have changed in form over time. 
After the award of the prize (worth about $130) in May 1857 Maxwell began to revise the argument of his essay, corresponding with two of the examiners, William Thomson and James Challis. He soon corrected errors which had compromised his treatment of the case of a solid ring, and turned to the task of reconstructing his discussion of the condition of stability of a fluid ring. By November 1857 he had discarded his theory of waves in a fluid ring, and established that a liquid continuous ring was not dynamically feasible. He now concluded that the ring system of Saturn consisted of concentric rings of satellites; this formed the argument of his memoir 'On the Stability of the Motion of Saturn's Rings' of 1859 (Niven, 1.288-376). To facilitate understanding of systems of waves in a ring of satellites he devised a model, a wheel on a cranked axle to which particles were attached; on rotation of the wheel the particles moved in wave patterns. 
The memoir on Saturn's rings consolidated Maxwell's reputation as a mathematical physicist. The problems generated by this investigation also played a role in initiating his work on the kinetic theory of gases in 1859. In considering the rings as a system of particles he noted that he was unable to compute the trajectories of these particles 'with any distinctness' (Niven, 1.354). This problem alerted him to discuss the complex motions of gas particles, where he introduced a probabilistic argument, and in 1864 he attempted to apply the statistical method of his theory of gases to compute the motions of the particles of Saturn's rings. This endeavour proved abortive and remained unpublished. The problem of calculating the motions of particles was considered further in his 1873 essay (written for his Cambridge colleagues) on science and free will ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 2.814-23), where he discussed the motion of a mechanical system subject to instabilities at points of singularity. Such instabilities were incalculable; he concluded that the physics of particles did not imply determinism. 
In completing his work on Saturn's rings Maxwell had drawn on data on gas viscosity to establish the effect of friction in disturbing the stability of the rings. In the spring of 1859 he became interested in a paper by Rudolf Clausius on the theory of gases considered as particles in motion; his work on Saturn's rings had alerted him to the problem of computing such motions. To explain the slow diffusion of gas molecules Clausius had calculated the probability of a molecule travelling a given distance (the mean free path) without collision. Maxwell had been interested in probability theory as early as 1850; his interest may have been aroused by an essay by John Herschel on Adolphe Quetelet's theory of probabilities, and there are similarities between Maxwell's derivation of the distribution law in his paper 'Illustrations of the dynamical theory of gases' of 1860 (Niven, 1.377-409) and Herschel's proof of the law of least squares. 
Maxwell advanced on Clausius's procedure by introducing a statistical formula for the distribution of velocities among gas molecules, a function identical in form with the distribution formula in the theory of errors. Writing to Stokes in May 1859 he explained that he had undertaken the study of the motions of particles as an 'exercise in mechanics', but he looked for confirmation of his argument in work on gaseous diffusion; he hoped to be 'snubbed a little by experiments' ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 1.610-11). He was able to calculate the mean free path of molecules, and established the unexpected result that the viscosity of gases was independent of their density. 
Maxwell then turned to investigate the viscosity of gases at different temperatures and pressures by observing the decay in the oscillation of discs torsionally suspended in a container, experiments presented as the Royal Society's Bakerian lecture in 1866. He found that gas viscosity was a linear function of the absolute temperature, and he suggested, in his major paper 'On the dynamical theory of gases' of 1867 (Niven, 2.26-78), that gas molecules should be considered as centres of force subject to an inverse fifth power law of repulsion, a result in agreement with this experimental finding. He presented a new derivation of the distribution law, demonstrating that the velocity distribution would maintain a state of equilibrium unchanged by collisions. His theory of gases was 'dynamical' or 'kinetic', as he later termed it ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 2.654), in that he supposed particles in motion. In the 1870s he came to contrast the certain predictive power of dynamical laws (Newton's laws of motion) with the inherently uncertain knowledge generated by the statistical method of his theory of gases, which, he argued, 'involves an abandonment of strict dynamical principles' (Niven, 2.253). 
In drafting his paper 'On the dynamical theory of gases' Maxwell found that his theory seemed to have the consequence that energy could be abstracted from a cooling gas, a result in conflict with the second law of thermodynamics, stated in the early 1850s by Clausius and Thomson as denoting the tendency of heat to pass from warmer to colder bodies; this implied 'a collision between Dynamics & thermodynamics' ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 2.269). While he corrected his argument and resolved the difficulty (reconstructing his analysis in 1873), it is likely that reflection on the problem led him to consider the bearing of his theory of gases on the interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. 
Maxwell first formulated the famous 'demon paradox' in a letter to Tait in December 1867. The term 'demon', which Maxwell did not use, was coined by William Thomson to describe the theoretical being invented by Maxwell for his thought experiment. It was incapable of doing work but was able to manipulate valves which move without friction. The purpose of Maxwell's 'finite being' was to suggest how a hot body could take heat from a colder body so as to 'pick a hole' in the second law of thermodynamics ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 2.331-2). As he later explained to Tait, his intention was 'to show that the 2nd law of Thermodynamics has only a statistical certainty' (ibid., 3.186). 
In other words, because of the statistical distribution of molecular velocities in a gas at equilibrium there will be spontaneous fluctuations of molecules taking heat from a cold body to a hotter one. However, it would require the action of the 'finite being' to manipulate molecules so as to produce an observable flow of heat from a cold body to a hotter one, and violate the second law of thermodynamics; hence the law is statistical and applies only to systems of molecules. Moreover the law is also time directional, expressing the irreversibility of physical processes, while the laws of dynamics are time reversible. Thus the second law of thermodynamics is a statistical expression, not a dynamical theorem, as supposed by Clausius and Ludwig Boltzmann. Their opinion, Maxwell joked to Tait in December 1873, was in the realm of cloud-cuckoo-land where the 'German Icari flap their waxen wings' ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 2.947). 
Maxwell expounded his ideas on thermodynamics in various essays in the 1870s and in his 'Theory of Heat' (1871), where he first made public his demon paradox. Intended as a popular exposition of the subject, this text contained an important new result, the 'Maxwell relations' between thermodynamical variables. During the 1870s he made further contributions to molecular physics: on the estimate of molecular diameters, and on intermolecular forces and the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states of matter. He also discussed the structure of molecules, which bore on one of the major problems in his theory of gases: the discrepancy between the measured values of the specific heat ratios of gases and those calculated (by the equipartition theorem) from the kinetic theory. His 1873 lecture 'Molecules' reviewed the subject; his conclusion that the identity of spectra showed an atom to be like a manufactured article, which 'precludes the idea of its being eternal and self-existent' (Niven, 2.376), used molecular physics to combat materialism. 
In a paper of 1878 Maxwell developed work by Boltzmann, formulating the ergodic theorem that a system in equilibrium will, if undisturbed, pass through every state compatible with its total energy, and he introduced the concept of ensemble averaging, foreshadowing work by J. Willard Gibbs and Albert Einstein. In a paper on rarefied gases, of 1878-9, Maxwell explained William Crookes's radiometer, much discussed in the 1870s. He demonstrated that the effect of radiant heat in spinning the radiometer vanes was due to the slip of gas over their surface, generating tangential stresses. His quantitative treatment of the effect was stimulated by reading a paper by Osborne Reynolds as a referee for the Royal Society. Maxwell made public both his acknowledgement and criticism of Reynolds's paper; but Reynolds took offence, difficulties abetted by Maxwell's terminal illness. 
Writing to Thomson in February 1854, after graduating at Cambridge, Maxwell declared his intention to attack the science of electricity. In the preface to his 'Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism' (1873) he recalled that he had commenced his work by study of Michael Faraday's 'Experimental Researches in Electricity' (1839-55). At the time he considered Faraday's experimental discoveries, of electromagnetic induction, the laws of electrochemistry, and magneto-optical rotation (the Faraday effect), to form 'the nucleus of everything electric since 1830' ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 1.582). Faraday had explained magnetism in terms of lines of force traversing space, and electrostatics by the mediation of forces by the dielectric. Guided by Thomson, Maxwell advanced beyond the work of his mentor in grappling comprehensively with Faraday's concept of the magnetic field. He supposed that electric and magnetic forces were mediated by the agency of the field, contiguous elements of the space in the neighbourhood of the electric or magnetic bodies. He expressed the essence of his field theory in a draft in 1855: 'Faraday treats the distribution of forces in space as the primary phenomenon' ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 1.353). In his paper 'On Faraday's lines of force' of 1856 (Niven, 1.155-229) he presented a geometrical model of lines of force in space, a representation resting on potential theory and the geometry of orthogonal surfaces, given embodiment by the physical analogy of the flow of an incompressible fluid (Niven, 1.156-8). He formulated theorems of electromagnetism, expressing the relation between magnetic forces and electric currents. 
The analogy of streamlines in a fluid was proposed as illustrative of the geometry of the field, but Maxwell sought a theory of the field grounded on the mechanics of a mediating ether. He found its basis in Thomson's 1856 proposal that the Faraday magneto-optical rotation could be explained by the rotation of vortices in an ether. As early as 1857 Maxwell began to develop the idea of orienting molecular vortices along magnetic field lines, culminating in the publication of his paper 'On physical lines of force', published in four parts in the 'Philosophical Magazine' in March, April, and May 1861, and in January and February 1862. He posited a honeycomb of vortices in which each vortex cell was separated from its neighbour by a layer of spherical particles, revolving in the opposite direction to the vortices. These 'idle wheel' particles communicated the rotatory velocity of the vortices from one part of the field to another. In this ether model, the most famous image in nineteenth-century physics, the analogy provides mechanical correlates for electromagnetic quantities. The angular velocity of the vortices corresponds to the magnetic field intensity, and the translational flow of the idle wheel particles to the flow of an electric current; the field equations are based on the rotation of molecular vortices in the ether. He emphasized that while the theory was mechanically conceivable, the model itself was provisional and temporary, even awkward, hardly 'a mode of connexion existing in nature' (Niven, 1.486), an argument that has generated much philosophical discussion about the role of models in physics. 
It is likely that Maxwell originally envisaged the paper as being limited to discussion of magnetism and electric currents. But during the summer of 1861, while modifying the ether model to encompass electrostatics, he obtained an unexpected consequence, the electromagnetic theory of light, as he termed his theory in 1864 ('Scientific Letters and Papers', 2.194). He introduced a displacement of electricity as an electromagnetic correlate of the elastic deformation of the vortices, an elastic property which allowed for the propagation of transverse shear waves. He established the close agreement between the velocity of propagation of waves in an electromagnetic medium (which he demonstrated to be given by the ratio of electrostatic and electromagnetic units, established experimentally), and the measured velocity of light. This led him to assert that he could 'scarcely avoid the inference that 'light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena'' (Niven, 1.500). 
Maxwell's introduction of the displacement current and his derivation of the electromagnetic theory of light have aroused claims that his argument lacks internal consistency and was subject to 'ad hoc' adjustment. Analysis of his conceptualization in terms of his mechanical ether has shown that the argument is internally consistent, and that the electromagnetic theory of light rests on parameters established by experiment. He completed the theory by a quantitative treatment of the magneto-optical effect in terms of the rotation of molecular vortices, but was dissatisfied with the appeal to a mechanical model. He sought to base his theory on firmer theoretical ground, and to confirm its experimental basis. 
The demands of the new technology of cable telegraphy prompted the determination of a standard of electrical resistance to aid engineers in establishing quality control, and in 1862 Maxwell joined the British Association committee on electrical standards. In May and June 1863, with Fleeming Jenkin and Balfour Stewart, he made an accurate measurement of electrical resistance in absolute units (of time, mass, and space), employing a method devised by Thomson, in which the resistance of a rotating coil was calculated from the measurement of the deflection of a magnet placed at its centre. His paper 'On governors' (1868) was the product of study of the governor designed by Jenkin for these experiments. The standard unit of resistance was issued in the spring of 1865 (though its accuracy was soon held up to question). As part of the committee's report in 1863, Maxwell and Jenkin wrote a paper introducing dimensional notation, expressing physical quantities as products of powers of mass, length, and time. For every electrical quantity there are two absolute units, the electrostatic and the electromagnetic, the ratio of these units being a power of a constant with the dimensions of a velocity. As Maxwell had established, this ratio was the velocity of waves in an electromagnetic medium, and he determined to establish its value with greater precision. Assisted by Charles Hockin, in 1868 he obtained a value for the ratio of units by an experiment balancing the (electrostatic) force between two oppositely charged discs against the (electromagnetic) repulsion between two current carrying coils (Niven, 2.125-43). The measured value still diverged from the latest value for the velocity of light, and in the 'Treatise' (1873) he merely claimed that the electromagnetic theory of light was 'not contradicted by the comparison of these results' (vol. 2, p. 388), a near equivalence which was seen to provide evidence in favour of the theory. 
In 'A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field' of 1865 (Niven, 1.526-97) Maxwell achieved a more general and systematic presentation of his theory. The mechanical ether model was abandoned, yet he retained the mechanical foundations of his theory by grounding the eight sets of general equations of the electromagnetic field (the forerunners of the four Maxwell equations, as reformulated in the 1880s by Oliver Heaviside and Heinrich Hertz) on the Lagrangian formalism of abstract dynamics. But in detaching his theory from the model he altered the interpretation of the displacement current, leading to a loss of consistency, a problem resolved in the 'Treatise' where he interprets the displacement current as manifested as electric charge. In Maxwell's field theory, electric charge is emergent from the field. 
Maxwell began writing the 'Treatise' in late 1867 and had completed a draft two years later. Interrupting the work to write the 'Theory of Heat', he resumed in November 1870, his major concern being the amplification of the mathematical argument of the book. In the 'Treatise' Maxwell emphasized the expression of physical quantities freed from direct representation by a mechanical model, a style of mathematical physics that became influential. He enlarged the physical geometry and mechanical foundations of his earlier papers, deploying four fundamental mathematical ideas: quaternions (vector concepts, invented by W. R. Hamilton and developed by Tait), integral theorems (Stokes's theorem, transforming line into surface integrals), topological ideas (J. B. Listing's topology of lines and surfaces), and the Lagrange-Hamilton method of analytical dynamics (as developed by Thomson and Tait in their 'Treatise on Natural Philosophy' of 1867). Maxwell's use of vector functions -- he introduced the term 'curl' -- was especially influential, vectors becoming pervasive in later physics, and the work abounds with innovative examples of mathematical physics, such as the polar representation of spherical harmonic functions, and the treatment of Green's function and reciprocity theorem. 
The 'Treatise' is divided into four parts -- on electrostatics, electricity in motion, magnetism, and electromagnetism -- and offers a systematic presentation, including discussion of electrical instruments and measurements. Maxwell's distinctive theory becomes most explicit in the final part: here he presents the general equations of the electromagnetic field, the electromagnetic theory of light, and the dynamical basis of his field theory. The work concludes with a rebuttal of contemporary theories (by Wilhelm Weber, Bernhard Riemann, and Enrico Betti) deriving from the tradition of considering forces acting at a distance without the mediation of a field. Maxwell argues that these theories cannot satisfactorily explain the transmission of energy, for 'there must be a medium or substance in which the energy exists'. Mediation by an ether, the seat of the electromagnetic field, is the keystone of his theory, and he stresses that it was his 'endeavour to construct a mental representation of all the details of its action' (J. C. Maxwell, 'Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism', 1873, 2.438). 
In 1865 Maxwell had resigned his post at King's College, London, and subsequently retired to private life at Glenlair, where he continued with his scientific work. As an examiner for the mathematical tripos at Cambridge in the late 1860s he had set a few questions on the theories of heat, electricity, and magnetism, fostering calls within the university for the introduction of these subjects into the tripos. The university sought the establishment of a new professorship to teach these physical subjects. The chancellor of the university, the seventh duke of Devonshire, offered funds for a laboratory (which came to be named after his family), and Maxwell was appointed to the professorship of experimental physics in March 1871. In his inaugural lecture in October 1871 Maxwell presented experimental physics as liberal culture rather than workbench practice, but emphasized the value of precision measurements, experiments which became the norm of research at the Cavendish Laboratory when it opened in April 1874. He designed the laboratory and acquired the instruments, paid for largely by the duke of Devonshire and by Maxwell himself. 
Maxwell's lectures on heat, electrostatics, and electromagnetism were designed to meet the expanded syllabus for the mathematical tripos, still overwhelmingly dominant as the educational path for prospective physicists at Cambridge. He gathered a small group of Cambridge graduates, including William Garnett (who became demonstrator and gave introductory lectures on physics and on laboratory methods) and George Chrystal; they were joined by Arthur Schuster, who had described experiments which suggested a deviation from Ohm's law. Under Maxwell's direction Chrystal undertook exhaustive tests, which Maxwell and Schuster reported to the British Association in 1876, confirming the accuracy of the law. Maxwell began to devise experiments to re-determine the standard unit of resistance, thwarted by Chrystal's departure for St Andrews in 1877. 
Following his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in May 1861 Maxwell had refereed a wide range of papers for the 'Philosophical Transactions', a task which continued unabated in the 1870s; he often wrote substantive essays offering significant commentary. Literary work, including richly informative reviews for 'Nature', formed an important part of Maxwell's activity during this final period of his life. He also published jocular scientific poems under his thermodynamic 'nom de plume' 'dp/dt', derived from an expression for the second law of thermodynamics in Tait's 'Sketch of Thermodynamics' (1868), 'dp/dt' = 'JCM'. His edition of 'The Electrical Researches of the Honourable Henry Cavendish' (1879) is a classic of scientific editing, locating Cavendish within his own period and -- by undertaking experimental tests of his results and recasting his ideas into a modern idiom -- relating Cavendish's work of the 1770s to the physics of the 1870s. Some of these investigations were incorporated into the second edition of the 'Treatise', published posthumously in 1881. The text 'Matter and Motion' (1876) contains subtle discussions of absolute space and the status of the laws of motion. As one of the scientific editors of the ninth edition of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica' Maxwell contributed several articles. The classic article on 'Atom' reviewed the subject from antiquity to contemporary developments, displaying his knowledge of the history of science. In 'Ether' he discussed the problem of detecting the earth's motion through the ether. His suggestion that light be propagated in opposite directions and that ether drag be detected by measuring any variation in its velocity, shortly led Albert Abraham Michelson to undertake his ether drift experiments, yielding a null result. 
Maxwell died of cancer at his home, 11 Scroope Terrace, Cambridge, on 5 November 1879. He was buried at Parton churchyard, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. 
In the 1870s Maxwell's scientific reputation was burgeoning, leading to the award of honorary doctorates from the universities of Edinburgh, Oxford, and Pavia, and the membership of academies in Amsterdam, Gottingen, Vienna, Boston, Philadelphia, and New York. His reputation initially rested largely on his kinetic theory of gases and statistical methods, further developed in the 1870s by Boltzmann. The impact of the 'Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism' was at first muted, but within a few years of his death his field theory shaped the work of Maxwellian physicists: George Francis FitzGerald, Oliver Heaviside, Joseph John Thomson, and others. Following Hertz's production and detection of electromagnetic waves in 1888, Maxwell's field theory and electromagnetic theory of light came to be accepted and regarded as one of the most fundamental of all physical theories. Maxwell's equations gained the status of Newton's laws of motion, and the theory was basic to the new technology of electric power, telephony, and radio. His reputation and the status of Maxwellian physics was enhanced by the advent of 'modern' physics in the twentieth century, understood as resting on his conception of the physical field and appeal to statistical descriptions. 
Although Maxwell's career traversed a period which saw the rapid professionalization of scientific endeavour, and he contributed to this development through his management of the Cavendish Laboratory, he should not be regarded as a professional scientist himself. His way of life was that of a Scottish laird, who often relied on inherited property in pursuing his own scientific interests. Indeed, in his more popular writings he expressed his traditional stance on the cultural values of science, lacking sympathy with the secularism which was becoming common in the 1870s. In his biography Lewis Campbell portrayed Maxwell as a natural philosopher pursuing science as an avocation; this has been an abiding image.

Clerke, Bartholomew (c.1537-1590), civil lawyer, was the son of John Clerke (died 1573), of Wells, Somerset, a notary public and proctor of the arches, and Anne, daughter of Henry Grantoft of Huntingdonshire. He was educated at Eton College ('c'.1550-1554) and King's College, Cambridge, where he was elected scholar on 23 August 1554 and proceeded BA in 1559. Appointed professor of rhetoric 'c'.1563, Clerke was proctor in 1564 and took part in the public disputation for doctors' degrees in philosophy that was held in the presence of the queen on her visit to the university. Rumours circulated of his unsoundness in religion -- perhaps explained by his letter of December 1565 to William Cecil as chancellor of the university complaining of those who, 'though otherwise good and religious men', were too fond of wrangling about trifles, and 'feigned to themselves unheard of laws of conscience', notably in respect of the wearing of the surplice in ministration and the use of the traditional priest's square cap, both of which they rejected as popish. Clerke dubbed them 'fanatici superpellicani & galeriani' ('surplice and cap fanatics') who 'infected many with their venom, not to say anabaptistical principles' (Strype, 'Parker', 197, bk 3, appx 43). 
Clerke's studies, meanwhile, embraced both modern languages and the law, and at some stage they took him to France, where he was offered but declined a public readership at Angers. In 1568 he was recommended by Cecil and others to succeed Roger Ascham as Latin secretary to the queen, but the office was already promised to another, and in 1569 Clerke again served as university proctor. Through the influence, in all probability, of the poet turned statesman Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, Clerke was elected member for Bramber in the parliament of April 1571, and shortly thereafter accompanied his patron to Paris on an embassy to congratulate Charles IX on his marriage. On his return he resided for some months in Buckhurst's household where he worked on a much admired translation into Latin of Castiglione's 'Il cortigiano' ('The courtier'), a series of discourses expounding the humanist values of the Italian Renaissance in which scholarship was allied to refinement and gentility. As elsewhere in Europe, the book became fashionable reading for the aristocracy, and Clerke's version went through three further editions in Elizabeth's reign (1577, 1579, and 1585). It was prefaced with letters of commendation from Edward de Vere, the earl of Oxford (to whom, it appears, Clerke had been tutor), Buckhurst, and John Caius. 
Clerke proceeded LLD in 1572. His legal studies made him the ideal choice when Archbishop Parker heard that Burghley was looking for a scholar to refute Nicholas Sander's attack ('De visibili monarchia ecclesiae') on the legitimacy of the queen's title. Parker reported that 'for his more estimation I have honested him with a room in the Arches... and he shall not want my advice and diligence' (Bruce and Perowne, 411). His work was forwarded to Burghley for approval and published in 1573 ('Fidelis servi subdito infidelio responsio, una cum errorum et calumniarum examine quae continentur in septimo libro a Nicholao Sandero conscripto'). In January of that year Clerke became a member of Doctors' Commons, and in May, by Parker's patronage, succeeded Thomas Yale as dean of the arches. The queen ordered Parker to rescind the appointment, on the pretence that he was too young to hold the post, but Clerke refused to be intimidated, pointing out that others had been preferred as young as he was and that to dismiss him would be to discredit him in his profession; he challenged a trial of his competence, and repeated that 'he would rather render his life than the office' (ibid., 417-32). Parker respectfully held his ground, the appointment stood, and other offices followed. In November 1573 Clerke was member of a commission to visit the church, city, and diocese of Canterbury; in 1577 he was appointed a master in chancery and in 1578 became a judge of the court of audience. According to Aylmer he was one of the few lawyers who was 'painful' and who did not 'follow his private gain' (Strype, 'Aylmer', 62). 
Clerke figures prominently in the judicial records of the period 1572-89. In December 1585 Clerke and Henry Killigrew were sent as members of the earl of Leicester's council of state to the Netherlands. Clerke's links were with the peace faction represented by Lord Burghley and the earl of Sussex, and Leicester would have preferred someone else, describing him as having 'good will, and a pretty scholar's wit', but 'no great stuff in him -- he is too little for these big fellows' (Bruce, 33). Clerke for his part was pessimistic as to the outcome of the expedition. In a series of letters to Burghley he wrote that 'here all is full of jealousies and mislikes' ('CSP for.', '1586-7', 75). The financial support of the states was much less than they had been led to expect, and there were tensions between the states and the earl. He found his work uncongenial and the climate unhealthy. His diligence, however, earned him Leicester's belated respect, and in October he was dispatched back to England on a special mission to the queen. In a memorandum of November 1586 he gave his opinion 'on the Queen's proceedings in the Low Countries', advising that a limited campaign of defending the four provinces was the only realistic option (ibid., 247-9). By April 1587 he was back at The Hague to assist Buckhurst and Sir John Norris in exploring the possibility of a peace settlement with Spain and to allay Dutch discontent at Leicester's conduct. On neither count was the mission successful, and in July, much to his relief, he was again recalled to England. 
In 1573 Clerke inherited, along with his brother Francis, the lease of his father's farm at Merton in Surrey. He married, at some date after 1575, Eleanor Haselrigge (died 1594), widow of Thomas Smith of Mitcham in Surrey, where they lived until 1583, when he bought the manor of Clapham. Clerke died at Clapham on either 15 or 16 March 1590, having added a codicil on 15 March to his will, which was proved two days later. He left the manor, together with leases of land at Grantchester, Waddon Mills, the parsonage of Ashe, and meadowland at Vauxhall to his son, Francis, his wife having in all cases a life interest. Provision was also made in his will for his daughter, Cecily (he hoped, God willing, that she would marry someone of his own name), his stepchildren and 'the poor children' of his wife's brother John. Among several items of jewellery mentioned is a 'great cross of diamonds and rubies I had of the Lady Frances, Countess of Sussex'. Clerke wanted a simple funeral, but left money for the building of a small chapel 'close to Clapham Chancel north window' to contain a family tomb. The present church of St Paul's has preserved all that remains of this -- the figure of his son, kneeling, and the epitaph on Clerke and his wife.

Clerke, Charles (1743-1779), naval officer and circumnavigator, was born in Weatherfield, Essex, the son of Joseph Clerke, a farmer. He had a brother, Sir John Clerke, and a sister who married Paul Henry Maty. He entered the navy in 1755 as captain's servant and midshipman in the 'Dorsetshire', served continuously during the Seven Years' War, and was on board the 'Bellona' when she captured the 'Courageux' on 13 August 1761. During the action Clerke was stationed in the mizen-top, and when the mizen-mast was shot away fell with it into the sea. After the peace he was appointed able seaman and midshipman in the 'Dolphin', and sailed with Commodore the Hon. John Byron on his voyage round the world in 1764 to 1766. On his return he communicated to Matthew Maty, secretary of the Royal Society, an account of the great height of the Patagonians, among whom he says they saw 'hardly a man less than eight feet; most of them considerably more'. The letter was read to the society on 12 February 1767, and published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1767 (57, 1768, 75-9). In 1768 he was appointed as master's mate to the 'Endeavour', with Captain Cook, and again sailed round the world on that expedition in 1768 to 1771. During the 'Endeavour''s stay in Tahiti, Clerke was associated with a girl known as Mrs Tate. He was ordered by Cook to act as lieutenant in a vacancy on 27 May 1771, during the voyage, as he was 'a young Man extremely well quallified for that station' ('Journals', 1.472) and was confirmed in that rank on the expedition's return to England on 31 July 1771. He sailed as second lieutenant of the 'Resolution' in Cook's second voyage round the world in 1772 to 1775. 
On his return to England, Clerke was advanced to the rank of commander on 26 August 1775, and when Cook's third expedition was fitting out in 1776, Clerke was appointed to command the 'Discovery'. Before the 'Discovery' sailed, Clerke was committed to the king's bench prison for debt, having apparently made himself security for his brother Captain Sir John Clerke RN, who had sailed for the East Indies without discharging his debts. Eventually Clerke managed to extricate himself from prison and rejoin the 'Discovery' in Plymouth, catching up with Cook in Table Bay. On the death of Captain Cook on 14 February 1779, Clerke succeeded to the command of the expedition, which, however, he did not long enjoy, dying six months later of tuberculosis he had contracted in prison. During these six months he had given proofs of his ability, energy, and devotion. In accordance with Cook's orders he had taken the expedition once again through Bering Strait into high latitudes in an attempt to return to England by the north-west passage or failing that the north-east passage. Being obstructed by pack ice he was forced to turn back, realizing that any further attempt would not only be fruitless, but also dangerous. The climate proved extremely trying to his condition and he died on 22 August 1779 within sight of Kamchatka and was buried with full military honours on 30 August under a tree, on rising ground in a valley on the north side of the Russian settlement of Petropavlovsk in Avacha Bay.

Clerke, Francis (fl. 1564-1594), civil lawyer and jurist, whose origins are unknown, spent most of his professional career as a proctor in the courts of the archbishop of Canterbury in London and also in the admiralty courts. In a preface to a work written in the 1590s, he made known that he had been active in the court of arches during the previous thirty-six years. As was customary, he would first have spent some years in the equivalent of pupillage, since the contemporary records of the courts show his formal admission as a proctor in 1564. In 1583 a Francis Clerke was admitted to Gray's Inn; it was not unusual for a civil lawyer to be so welcomed by the common lawyers. If this is the same person, he came from Stevenage. It has also been suggested that he was related to Bartholomew Clerke (died 1590), dean of the court of arches, but again the possibility rests only on the coincidence in profession and name. Unlike advocates, proctors commonly entered practice after leaving university without having taken a degree or even without having attended a university at all, and one of these was evidently the path Clerke took. However, he supplicated for, and received, the BCL from Oxford in 1594, professedly so that he could lay claim to that distinction on the title-page of his soon to be published book, the earliest copies of which, though all in manuscript, date from the mid-1590s. 
Most of what can be known about Clerke must be derived from his two works, which were used by practitioners as long as the courts about which he wrote flourished. Lord Hardwicke later described him as 'an author of undoubted credit' ('Sir Henry Blount's case'). Clerke's close familiarity with the courts and his stated goal of helping practising civil lawyers overcome the limitations of academic training lend credence to the description. The longer of his works, 'Praxis in curiis ecclesiasticis', was published after Clerke's death, in Dublin in 1666, and in London in 1684. However, it circulated widely in manuscript beforehand, and many manuscript copies have survived in local and diocesan archives -- testimony to its utility in understanding the procedure employed in all English ecclesiastical courts. The Latin is unvarnished, and substantive law is related to its discussion of procedure. Unfortunately, the long gestation period of a printed edition led to the introduction of errors, and no satisfactory edition has ever been produced. It was largely overtaken by Henry Conset's 'Practice of the Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Courts' (1684), which itself relied heavily on Clerke's work. 
Many similar works were written during this period by continental jurists. They combined descriptions of the special features of particular courts with more general treatments of procedural law in the 'ius commune'. Typically, they moved through the steps in litigation, from citation to sentence and appeal. Clerke followed that model but, unlike most continental writers, he provided no citations to the works of learned jurists. Many manuscript copies carry marginalia, made later by the proctors and advocates who did provide them. 
Clerke's second and shorter work, 'Praxis curie admiralitatis Angliae', is similar in approach to the first. The admiralty courts used the same basic procedure as the church's courts, but they varied it, as for example in allowing 'in rem' attachments of vessels appropriate to general maritime law. This work enjoyed a longer currency, perhaps because of a lack of effective competition. The first edition, published in London in 1667, was reprinted in 1679. Other editions, some produced with facing translations, appeared in 1722, 1743, 1798, and 1829, the second of these edited by Francis Hargrave. John Elihu Hall translated the text and added American notes in a version published in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1809. No trace of Clerke's will has survived, and even the date of his death is unknown.

Clerke, Gilbert (bap. 1626, d. c.1697), mathematician and theologian, was born at Uppingham, Rutland, and baptized there on 19 March 1626. He was a son of John Clerke, headmaster of Uppingham School. He was educated at Geddington, Northamptonshire, and from 1637 at Oundle School. In 1641 he entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge; he graduated BA in 1644-5 and took his MA in 1648, when he was elected to a fellowship. He was the first fellow of Sidney to be nominated as proctor, serving in 1652-3. He took Presbyterian orders in 1651, but in 1655 resigned his fellowship and left Cambridge because of religious scruples. He later claimed to have been one of those who introduced the teaching of mathematics and of the new philosophy at Cambridge. 
Clerke's earliest published writings, 'De plenitudine mundi' (1660) and 'Tractatus de restitutione corporum' (1662), reveal that he was a convert to Descartes's philosophy. They defend the Cartesian theory of matter, concentrating on Descartes's denial that a vacuum might exist in nature. Clerke criticized the alternative theories of Bacon, Ward, and especially Hobbes, whose linguistic critique of Descartes and denial of the reality of the spring of air he derided. Although he was familiar with Torricelli's findings and with Boyle's air-pump experiments (which indicated the existence of a vacuum), he believed that these exemplified the action of a subtle ether that could penetrate glass and that filled all space. In the 'Tractatus' he was nevertheless also critical of Boyle's Jesuit opponent Francis Line (Linus). 

'Tractatus de restitutione corporum' was dedicated to Sir Justinian Isham, second baronet, a pupil of Clerke's father who became his patron during the 1660s. After leaving Cambridge, Clerke moved eventually to a moated house, Bleakhall, outside Loddington, Northamptonshire, which he filled with elegant objects, and where he established a small pipe works. This was a short distance from the Isham estate at Lamport, where Clerke was a frequent visitor, acting as mathematical tutor to the Isham children. Between 1677 and 1683 he lived chiefly at Lamport, managing the estate for his former pupils Sir Thomas Isham, third baronet, and Sir Justinian Isham, fourth baronet, during their long absences abroad and in London. He was an efficient steward, who warned of the dangers posed by youthful profligacy. With the Ishams, Clerke pored over accounts of reflecting telescopes in the Royal Society's 'Philosophical Transactions' and experimented with one of Morland's speaking trumpets. At Lamport he observed the comet of 1681, and made precise calculations of latitude that were later used by Morton to establish the boundaries of Northamptonshire. In 1682 he published 'Oughtredus explicatus', an edition of Oughtred's 'Clavis', dedicated to Sir Justinian Isham, fourth baronet. This edition, which was criticized by John Collins, represented the culmination of work begun by Clerke in the early 1660s. He advised local gentlemen on the manufacture and setting up of dials, the subject of his 'Astronomica specimina' (1682) and 'The Spot-Dial' (1687). 
Clerke shared the Ishams' interest in cases of witchcraft and spirit possession. His account of a haunted house near Daventry in 1658 was later included by Glanvill and More in 'Saducismus triumphatus' (1681); subsequently he investigated disturbances at Brixworth and Bowden. He remained sceptical about the true causes of such phenomena, and was critical of the treatment of the children who were said to have been bewitched at Bowden in February 1673. In 1681 he corresponded with Richard Baxter on subjects raised by Baxter's disputes with Stillingfleet, expressing his sympathy for the writings of Socinus and discussing the nature of the Trinity, the atonement, and original sin. He stressed his independence in religion, writing that he could neither subscribe to the 'Thirty-Nine Articles' nor to Socinus's opinions concerning the Trinity. These matters were taken up in the anonymous 'Tractatus tres' (1695), to which Clerke contributed the first two treatises. He was concerned to demonstrate the pre-eminence of God the Father, arguing that the interpretation of the Trinity found in the Nicene creed was a result of the corruption of Christianity by Platonism. He suggested elsewhere that this corruption had been predicted in the books of 'Daniel' and 'Revelation'. 
Clerke was not an original theologian but relied heavily on the writings of Sandius and Zwicker. The theologian George Bull argued that he had misrepresented Clement of Alexandria. At his brother's invitation, Clerke moved from Lamport to Stamford Baron, Northamptonshire, about 1683. There he continued to teach and practise mathematics, one of his pupils being the young William Whiston. Clerke was among the first readers of Newton's 'Principia', and wrote to its author in 1687 to criticize the book's obscure terminology. From his brother he inherited an estate at Luffenham, Rutland, worth $40 a year. He is thought to have died about 1697.

Clerke, Henry (1621/2?-1687), physician, was one of several children of Thomas Clerke (1580-1663) of Willoughby, Warwickshire. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1638, when his age was entered as sixteen, and spent the remainder of his life within Magdalen College, where he obtained a demyship, graduated BA in 1641, and proceeded MA in 1644. From 1642 to 1667 he held a fellowship, submitting to the parliamentary visitors' examination in 1648 and having no trouble retaining his position in 1660 when the surviving expelled fellows returned. He was reader in logic in 1643, bursar in 1653, 1656, and 1662, and vice-president in 1655 and again in 1663. 
Clerke was created BM in January 1648, admitted to practise medicine the following February, and took the MD by accumulation in 1652, being incorporated in Cambridge in 1673. From 1652 to 1671 he deputized for William Petty as Tomlins reader in anatomy. He was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians in 1658 and elected fellow in 1669. Clerke was one of the group of virtuoso-physicians who gathered at Petty's house from 1649 and, after his departure, at John Wilkins's lodgings at Wadham College, to perform dissections and discuss apothecary matters and other scientific topics. John Evelyn, Henry Oldenburg, and Robert Boyle were among their visitors. In 1657 the group migrated to Boyle's house where they had access to his scientific apparatus. Clerke was an early member of the Royal Society, and the first from Magdalen, being elected on 24 October 1667, but he paid his subscription only for 1667-9 and played no part in its London meetings. 
Following the death of Thomas Pierce, president of Magdalen College, Clerke was elected in his place on 5 March 1672, and in order to fully qualify for the office he soon afterwards took holy orders. He was appointed vice-chancellor on 9 October 1676. He married, probably in the 1660s, Catherine (1635/6-1669), fourth daughter of William Adams of Charwelton, Northamptonshire. They had a son, Henry, who died in the same year as his mother, and a daughter, Catherine, known around the college as the Infanta, possibly because of the haughty air she adopted as the president's daughter. She married in 1682 Richard Shuttleworth (1666-1687) of Gawthrop (or Gawthorpe) Hall, near Burnley, Lancashire, at that time a gentleman commoner of Trinity College and considerably younger than his wife -- he was still in his minority at the time of his father-in-law's death, by which time they had three children. In the summer of 1685 Clerke went on a tour of Yorkshire with his daughter and son-in-law, calling on the way back at Willoughby and Nottingham. 
Clerke died at Gawthrop Hall on 24 March 1687, allegedly aged sixty-eight, and on 9 April was buried with his ancestors at Willoughby. He left the furniture and linen in his college lodgings to one of his sisters and her daughter, who may have been looking after him there. He made generous bequests to his immediate family, part of this to come from the sale of his books; to his college the sum of $50 to buy a gilded bowl and cover to be placed on the altar; and lesser sums to various parishes. The college erected and subsequently restored a monument in the church at Willoughby commemorating him as a great benefactor.

Clerke, Richard (d. 1634), Church of England clergyman, was born in London, the son of George Clarke (died 1607). He matriculated as a pensioner from Christ's College, Cambridge, in December 1579 and graduated BA in early 1583. Elected that year as a fellow, he proceeded MA in 1586. As a leader of the minority conformist faction in this generally puritan college, in 1590 he came to blows with the strongly Calvinist George Downame, later bishop of Derry. That October, Clerke and a colleague, John Powell, wrote to Lord Burghley complaining that they had not been promoted within Christ's because 'we do not favour the party of those who through portents of new opinions and treading down of all laws would attack the jugular of the college' (Bondos-Greene, 200). Burghley effected a reconciliation in November, but in the fellowship elections of 1596 Clerke, who had proceeded BTh in 1593 and who was that year Lady Margaret preacher, encountered further trouble when he opposed the candidature of Thomas Rainbow, whom he considered a 'schismatic'. 
In 1597 Clerke was instituted as vicar of Minster, in the island of Thanet, and the following year, having proceeded DTh, he relinquished his fellowship. Within a short time he married; his wife's name is unknown, but a son, Martin, perhaps their eldest child, who graduated from Christ's early in 1621, was probably born before 1602. On 8 May 1602 Clerke was collated to the office of six-preacher in Canterbury Cathedral; regular baptisms and burials of members of his family suggest that from at least early 1605 he was often resident in the city. A learned Hebraist, he was chosen as one of the translators of the Authorized Version of the 'Bible' and worked on the first section from 'Genesis' to 'Kings'. He sufficiently impressed the king to become the latter's apparently preferred candidate to succeed Edmund Barwell (died 1609) in the mastership of Christ's College, but at the last minute James I ordered the earl of Salisbury to institute Valentine Cary on the stated grounds that Cary was unmarried and childless. Compensation came to Clerke successively in the form of the Kentish rectory of Shargate and vicarage of Monkton with Birchington, which he held with Minster respectively from 1609 to 1611 and from 1611 until his death. 
Having given birth to at least ten children, Clerke's wife died, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral on 8 October 1620; most of the children also predeceased their father. Having married again, Clerke died in 1634 and was buried in the cathedral on 29 September. His will gave little to his two 'unkinde sonnes', Martin and James; his daughter Katherine, who was under nineteen, was left to the guardianship of her maternal relatives, including her great-aunt, 'the elder Lady Oxinden'. Other beneficiaries included his widow, the hospitals of St John's, Canterbury, and St Nicholas, Harbaldown, the schools of St Paul's, London, and Christ Church, Canterbury, and Christ's College. He also confirmed a deed of 1625 setting aside $120 for loans to farmers at Minster to improve their stock. Seventy-four of his sermons were edited by Charles White and published as 'Sermons Preached by that Reverend and Learned Divine Richard Clerke' (1637). According to William Prynne's account in his 'Canterburies Doome' (1646) of the testimony given by White at Archbishop William Laud's trial, Laud's chaplains and licensers made extensive alterations to Clerke's text, purging much of his anti-Catholicism and seeking to give his moderate Calvinism an Arminian gloss. Passages affirming the pope to be Antichrist, attacking the mass, and criticizing monks and clergy were removed, while his restriction of salvation to an elect few was replaced by a doctrine approaching universal grace. However, taken at face value Clerke's collected works still represent not so much full-blown Laudian ceremonialism as 'a Whitgiftian (but distinctly pre-Laudian) Conformist churchmanship' (Collinson, 183). Visitation sermons apart, their message was generally non-controversial, valuing equally prayer, preaching, sacraments, and the decency of actions such as kneeling at communion. Such a message sits reasonably comfortably with the anti-puritanism of his younger days.

Clerke, Thomas Henry Shadwell (1792-1849), army officer and military journalist, was born at Bandon, co. Cork. Intended for the army, a profession also adopted by his brothers, St John Augustus Clerke, who died a lieutenant-general and colonel in the 75th foot on 17 January 1870, and William Clerke, afterwards a major in the 77th foot, he was sent to the Royal Military College, Great Marlow, where he distinguished himself, and was appointed to an ensigncy without purchase in 1808. As a subaltern in the 28th and 5th foot he served through the Peninsular campaigns until he lost his right leg in the engagement at Redinha in 1811 and was incapacitated for further active service. On the recommendation of Lord Wellington he was promoted to a company in the 1st garrison battalion, with which he served until its reduction in 1814. He afterwards served with the 2nd battalion 57th, and on the army depot staff. He was promoted to a majority unattached in 1830, and was made KH in 1831. 
Clerke became first editor of 'Colburn's United Service Magazine' in January 1829, and so continued until July 1842. On the death of Colonel Gurwood, he was entrusted with the task of seeing through the press the last volume of 'Selections from the Wellington Despatches'. Although his name does not appear as the author of any scientific or other works, he was an active member of the British Association and of various learned societies. At the time of his death he was a fellow of the Royal Society (elected 10 April 1833), a vice-president of the Royal United Service Institution, of which he had been one of the founders, and a fellow of the Royal Astronomical and Geological societies; for a short time he had been honorary foreign secretary of the Royal Geographical Society. Clerke died at his residence in Brompton Grove, London, of 'paralysis', on 19 April 1849.

Clerke, William (fl. 1575-1594), writer, matriculated as a sizar of Trinity College, Cambridge, in June 1575. He became a scholar of that house and in 1578-9 proceeded BA. In 1581 he was elected a fellow of his college and in 1582 he commenced MA. He may also have been the William Clerke of St Paul's School who received money from Robert Nowel's estate on 3 June 1579 and 20 February 1580 for attendance at Cambridge. In 1594 Clerke published 'The triall of bastardie... annexed at the end of this treatise, touching the prohibition of marriage, a table of the levitical, English, and positive canon catalogues, their concordance and difference'. He may also have written 'Polimanteia, or, The meanes lawfull and unlawfull, to judge of the fall of a common-wealth against the frivolous and foolish conjectures of this age' (1595), the author of which is identified as 'W. C.' in the dedication to Robert Devereux, earl of Essex.

Clerke, Sir William Henry, eighth baronet (1751-1818), Church of England clergyman, was born on 25 November 1751 in Jamaica, the second son of Francis Clerke (1724-1760) of Weston, Oxfordshire, and Susannah Elizabeth Ashurst. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in December 1769; he was subsequently a member of All Souls College, Oxford, and he took his BCL degree in October 1778. In 1778 Clerke succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his elder brother, Francis, the favourite aide-de-camp to General John Burgoyne in North America, who was mortally wounded at Saratoga. When he was dying Francis asked Burgoyne to endeavour, on his return to England, to procure preferment for William, who had taken orders. The twelfth earl of Derby -- at the prompting, no doubt, of General Burgoyne, who had married the earl's aunt -- presented Clerke to the rectory of Bury, Lancashire, to which he was instituted on 6 February 1778. 
Clerke's religious and political views appear to have been those of a conventional high-church tory. He was well received on his arrival in Bury and as rector was remembered as good natured and charitable to the poor. In particular, he paid much attention to the physical health of his parishioners; he vaccinated the children of the local poor and for a considerable time even travelled to Rochdale once a week to perform the same operation. On the occasion of an outbreak of fever he issued, in 1790, 'Thoughts upon the means of preserving the health of the poor by prevention and suppression of epidemic fever', a pamphlet advocating the use of quarantine, improved cleanliness, and extensive lime whitewashing as a means of controlling the disease. These suggestions, perhaps partly inspired by Clerke's own extensive involvement in the lime trade, were supported by an appeal for paternalistic involvement on the part of employers of labour and by a long letter on the pamphlet's subject matter by the philanthropic Dr Thomas Percival. 
In May 1792 Clerke married Byzantia (died 1815), daughter of Thomas Cartwright of Aynho; they had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, William Henry (1793-1861), became ninth baronet and he served in the Peninsular War and at Waterloo. The two younger sons both went into the church and the youngest, Charles Carr, became archdeacon of Oxford and a canon of Christ Church. At a time when a French invasion was feared Clerke printed 'A sermon preached in the parish church of Bury on the 18th October 1798, on the occasion of the colours being presented to the Bury Loyal Association' and 'A Serious Address to the People of this Country'. Appended to the sermon was the speech made on the reception of the colours by the lieutenant-colonel commandant of the Bury Volunteers, the first Sir Robert Peel, whose second wife was Clerke's sister. Another of Clerke's publications is his undated 'Penitens, or, The dying tradesman, extracted from the books of a late pious writer: to which is added prayers'. 
In addition to the manufacture of lime, Clerke involved himself energetically in a number of agricultural pursuits and enterprises. These included farming the extensive rectory lands, often taking a turn at the plough and participating in the harvest. He built his own corn mill and became a significant dealer in both corn and malt. Unfortunately Clerke's enthusiasm for business exceeded his aptitude, and he borrowed extensively, sometimes at high rates of interest, to support his enterprises and he suffered from the dishonesty of some of his associates. Eventually, his financial embarrassments grew to such an extent that his living was sequestered for the benefit of his creditors. He died on 10 April 1818, in the Fleet prison, where he was incarcerated for debt, his wife having died three years previously on 30 April 1815.

Clevland, Augustus (1754-1784), East India Company servant, was born in London on 19 September 1754, the son of John Clevland (1706-1763), MP and secretary to the Admiralty, of Tapley, Devon, and his second wife, Sarah ('fl'. 1749-1763), daughter of Richard Shuckburgh of Longborough, Gloucestershire. His eldest half-brother, John Clevland (1734?-1817), followed his father into the Admiralty and was the MP for Barnstaple from 1766 to 1802. Augustus was one of the younger of John Clevland's seven surviving children and was still a child when his father died in 1763, heavily in debt to the Admiralty, but the Clevlands were well connected, and in 1770, after a brief course of financial instruction in Greenwich, Augustus secured a writership in the East India Company's Bengal establishment. His patron among the company's directors, Frederick Pigou (1711-1792), former chief supercargo of Canton, was the patron also of his relation and intimate friend John Shore (1751-1834), later first Lord Teignmouth and governor-general of Bengal. 
Clevland arrived in India about 1771 and was appointed assistant collector of Bhagalpur; he was promoted to collector in 1775. Bhagalpur was a jungly district to the west of Bengal proper, agriculturally rich along the plains which straddled the Ganges, but bordered on the south-east and west by the Rajmahal and Kharakpur hills respectively. The hills were the preserve of aboriginal peoples -- 'tribals' -- who were incorporated only loosely into the political and religious life of the plains, and who gave the district its ancient reputation for 'refractoriness'. As collector, Clevland understood that he would never get more revenue from those who lived on the plains until he proved that the British could contain the hill peoples who frequently raided them. In spite of initial government scepticism, he persisted with a plan to conciliate the hill chiefs and their followers by creating a militia or corps of hill rangers which respected the internal authority of the chiefs and shielded them from the interference of the company's regular courts. Hill chiefs who joined Clevland's corps were rewarded with honours, cash, feasting, uniforms, and, eventually, firearms. The landlords of the plains mostly welcomed the initiative and the revenue collections increased accordingly, but some, such as the Rani Serbissery of Sultanabad, correctly perceived in Clevland's taming of the hills the loss of their own autonomy as well and turned themselves into outlaws rather than submit to company control. For the most part, however, Clevland's experiment was regarded as a triumph. The hill peoples entered British Indian imperial lore as the first in a long line of stereotypical 'loyal savages', while Clevland amassed increased authority on the strength of their pacification, including the exclusive right to oversee the administration of justice by the hill chiefs. 
Clevland's other notable achievement was the creation of the first invalid 'thana', a settlement of invalided soldiers from the Bengal army designed to colonize marginal lands, thus extending the boundaries of company influence while also boosting the land revenue. Credit for the idea belongs to Captain James Browne, an officer in charge of the jungle tarai, but it was to Clevland that, in 1779, Warren Hastings, the governor-general, entrusted the first experiment. He began by settling over 180 retired Indian sepoys on the fringes of the Rajmahal hills, parcelling out to each settler a substantial tract of land, the size of which was determined by the rank he had attained in the army. Under his watchful eye, the newcomers soon formed a well-armed and disciplined buffer between the cultivators in the plains and the raiders of the hills. It was another, vital step in Clevland's mission to tame the hill frontier, and invalid 'thanas' were soon established on other frontiers: they had become 'the vanguard of colonial expansion westwards' (Alavi, 101-2). 
Clevland was a brilliant administrator who combined ambition and seriousness of purpose with considerable personal charm and generosity. He quickly became a favourite of Warren Hastings, and Hastings's wife, Marian, descended on him for weeks at a time in his magnificent riverside mansion. Another visitor to enjoy Clevland's hospitality, and also his munificent patronage, was the painter William Hodges, who immortalized Clevland's hill rangers in paint and the 'ingenuity, address, and humanity' (Hodges, 90) of Clevland himself in his published reminiscences, 'Travels in India' (1793). 
The support of Hastings and also of John Shore, who was emerging as Bengal's foremost authority on land revenue, ensured that Clevland's demands for further powers were rarely disappointed. In 1783 he made his most far-reaching proposal yet, a request to be personally granted the revenue-collecting contract for the whole of Bhagalpur which, if allowed, would have turned him into a jungle king of 'Heart of Darkness' proportions. The court of directors had explicitly forbidden revenue farming by company employees, but such was Clevland's reputation that Hastings's council agreed to ask the directors to waive the prohibition in his case. Before they could rule, however, Clevland sickened with fever and dysentery. In early 1784 he boarded the 'Atlas', bound for the Cape of Good Hope, but died at sea on 13 January 1784. He was twenty-nine. His body was returned to Calcutta and interred there on 30 January 1784 in the South Park Street burial-ground, where Hastings subsequently had a substantial monument erected to him at public expense. Shore penned a monodic lament on his lost cousin, and his estate, including twenty-one paintings by Hodges, was eventually sold off for funds to be remitted to his sisters and their children in Britain. He had never married. The most famous memorial to him, however, was the cairn erected at Bhagalpur out of Rs28,000 subscribed by local landlords. Forty years later, Bishop Heber found both the monument and local memory of Clevland intact; indeed, the longevity of Clevland's reputation acquired historical importance in itself. With his death, Bhagalpur's drift to personal rule was halted and the company gradually imposed more rigorous controls on the aspiring rajas in its service, but for advocates of a paternalistic, socially conservative imperialism, Clevland's example shone forth as the perfect means to conciliate a rude and savage people. The belief that his memory lived on in Bhagalpur was as reassuring to them as it was to the hill peoples who had originally accepted him as their overlord.

Cleveland, John (bap. 1613, d. 1658), poet, was baptized on 20 June 1613 at Loughborough, the son of Thomas Cleveland (died 1652) and Elizabeth Hebbe (died 1649). He was the second of their eleven children, not all of whom survived, and their eldest son. Thomas Cleveland was then assistant to the rector of the parish church as well as usher at Burton's Grammar School. In 1621, however, he became vicar of Hinckley. 
Cleveland's education continued with his admission to Christ's College, Cambridge, on 4 September 1627. He was enrolled as a lesser pensioner and his fees were therefore $50 a year, a substantial sum in those days and one indicating that his family had become financially comfortable since the time when his father had been trying to glean an adequate income from two jobs. John's tutor at Christ's was William Siddall, who stood high in seniority -- perhaps second -- among the fellows. 
The years at Cambridge were distinctly productive for Cleveland with regard to both academic achievement and the writing of poems. In September 1629 he was selected to deliver the Latin speech of welcome to the earl of Holland, who was chancellor of the university. The earl was accompanied by the French ambassador. Later, though perhaps while he was still an undergraduate, John acted as 'father' (that is, master of ceremonies) at the Cambridge revels. If his having been selected to make the Latin speech to the university chancellor suggests the esteem accorded his Latinity and his rhetorical skills, his appointment as father of the revels implies that he was not merely well liked by students and fellows but also esteemed for his wit. Aubrey described him as 'a comely plump man, good curled haire, darke browne' ('Brief Lives', 1.174-5). 
In any event, although John's role as father may not strictly count as one of his academic achievements, there were certainly others. He graduated BA early in 1632, was elected to the Hebblethwaite fellowship at St John's College in 1634, and proceeded MA in 1635. Two of the students under his guidance were Samuel Drake and John Lake; they compiled the 1677 edition of his works. Anthony Wood's claim that John proceeded MA from Oxford as well as from Cambridge remains unsubstantiated. It should be added that, although fellows of St John's College were obliged to take holy orders within six years of their elections, John did not. He was admitted to the law line in 1640. Between 1635 and 1637 he became rhetoric reader. His duties involved writing orations and also letters on behalf of St John's, for example to the archbishop of Canterbury and to Lord Herbert of Cherbury. In 1636 he delivered an address to Charles Lewis, son of Frederick, the elector palatine, and of King Charles's sister. In March 1642 he addressed the king himself. The king apparently liked the speech and ordered that a copy be sent him after his departure that evening from the university. Cleveland also contributed verses to two university miscellanies. One of these was an elegy for the death of Edward King, and was published in the same volume as fellow Christ's man John Milton's 'Lycidas' ('Juxta Edouardo King', 1638). It is among the earliest of Cleveland's datable poems, but reveals qualities to be seen throughout his verse as a whole. Writing in the tradition of the 'literature of tears' (primarily though not solely a religious literary tradition in seventeenth-century English verse), Cleveland portrays his grief as being a virtual re-enactment of King's death. '
My tears will keep no channells, know no laws 

To guide their streams; but like the waves, their cause, 

Run with disturbance, till they swallow me 

As a description of his miserie. 
('Juxta Edouardo King', ll. 13-16)' Such hyperbole and catachresis (an extravagant metaphor using words in an alien or unusual way) recur in many of Cleveland's poems. Sometimes he uses the figures to indicate intense anger, as in his political poems; sometimes to indicate wonder in celebration of the ineffable, as in poems extolling the king; sometimes, as in various erotic poems, he uses them for comic effect. The elegy also shows John Donne's influence on Cleveland: notably in the tendency to paradox and epigram. 
It has been argued that many of Cleveland's amatory and non-political poems were written while he was still at university -- June 1642 is the last sure date that marks his presence there. They show him fully engaged in the social and political upheavals of the times, with mocking denunciation of the king's enemies running through the verses. In 1640 Cleveland opposed Oliver Cromwell's campaign for election to the Long Parliament. As Samuel Drake and John Lake later described the event: 'When 'Oliver' was in Election to be Burgess for the Town of 'Cambridge', as [Cleveland] engaged all his Friends and Interests to oppose it, so when it was passed, he said with much passionate Zeal, That single Vote had ruined both Church and Kingdom. (Drake and Lake, foreword, sig. Ab'v')' More vigorous political action on Cleveland's part would follow, and it is as political satirist that he is chiefly famous. In 'Upon the Kings Return from Scotland', for example, he represents Charles I as a godlike figure, a sun king who is also the soul of the state (ll. 1-8), and the guarantor of both its peace and of its established religion (ll. 35-40). 'To P. Rupert', in harmony with that poem, portrays the prince as mysteriously the embodiment of past, present, and future heroic virtue (ll. 55-70), standing between the state and those who would confound it (ll. 155-72). Drawing upon the resources of royalist polemic and adding to them, the poems suggest that law and religion, reason and virtue are centred on the monarchy. The enemies of the crown are presented as men who would undo the law, who promote a parody of true religion, and who are (often wilfully) self-deluding creatures driven by unreason and expediency. They are the instigators of anarchy, who would turn the world upside down and so erase all decorum. In 'A Dialogue between two Zealots, upon the &c. in the Oath', for example, two puritan divines construct a crazy, self-interested, apocalyptic fantasy around the ampersand in the so-called etcetera oath of 1640 legitimizing the new ecclesiastical canons. Another satire, 'Smectymnuus, or, The Club-Divines', continues Cleveland's portrait of the puritan grotesque in its depiction of the five ministers who under that name published anti-episcopal pamphlets in 1641. 
Some time after June 1642 Cleveland left Cambridge, which was a difficult place for an outspoken royalist to live, as violent hostilities had begun between parliamentary supporters in the town and members of the university. He joined the king at his headquarters, established at Oxford in November. There John wrote 'The Rebell Scot' and 'The Character of a London-Diurnall'. The former, a satirical poem against the Scots, is now perhaps the best-known poem in the Cleveland canon; certainly it is the most famous of his verse satires. The speaker of the satire derides the Scots as being the bestial inhabitants of a wilderness whose wretched poverty drives them abroad as mercenaries. Early in the poem the speaker is quick to suggest the unnaturalness of a Scottish threat to England and his fury at such a prospect (ll. 3-7). He thereafter says: '
Nature her selfe doth Scotch-men beasts confesse, 

Making their Countrey such a wildernesse: 

A Land that brings in question and suspense 

Gods omnipresence, but that CHARLES came thence: 

But that 'Montrose' and 'Crawfords' loyall Band 

Atton'd their sins, and christ'ned halfe the Land. 
(ll. 47-52)' The Scots are pictured as creatures whom nature has excluded from civil life (elsewhere in the poem they are portrayed as having no sense of the common weal; see ll. 63-80). They and their country have been definitely brought into the divine order of things only because of the English monarch's recent visit to Scotland and the redemptive, military power of his representatives. 'The Character of a London-Diurnall', a prose satire ridiculing the London newsbooks, was published anonymously early in 1645. The London newsbooks reported lies, Cleveland's speaker declared, not news, and inflated their accounts of parliamentary victories. 'A Diurnal is a puny Chronical', Cleveland wrote, 'scarce Pin-feather'd with the wings of Time. It is History in Snippets: The English 'Iliads' in a Nutshel: The Apochryphal Parliament's 'Book of Maccabees' in single sheets. (J. Cleveland, 'The Character of a London-Diurnall', 1645, 108)' The satire also contains a vigorous caricature of Cromwell. The publication of the pamphlet was noted by Marchamont Nedham in 'Mercurius Britannicus' on 10 February, though Nedham waited until the following week to print his attack. Many other newsbooks printed their responses, and three pamphlets were published attacking 'The Character' in three weeks. A later 'character' continued the attack. With Nedham's 'Mercurius Politicus' (1650) in his sights, Cleveland suggested: 'It is time that we had our State-scold to the Ducking-stool' (quoted in J. Raymond, 'The Invention of the Newspaper', 1996, 219). 
From approximately spring 1645 to that of the following year Cleveland served as judge advocate with the royal garrison at Newark. His appointment was noticed by the opposite faction in the 'Kingdome's Weekly Intelligencer': 'But to speak something of our friend Cleveland, that grand malignant of Cambridge, we hear that now he is at Newark, where he hath the title of advocate put upon him. His office and employment is to gather all college rents within the power of the king's forces in those parts, which he distributes to such as are turned out of their fellowships at Cambridge for their malignancy. ('Kingdome's Weekly Intelligencer', no. 101, 27 May 1645, 811)' The king left Newark just before the city was besieged by the Scots in November 1645 and it was Cleveland who wrote in refusal of a demand for the city's surrender. However, on 5 May 1646 the king surrendered himself to the Scots at Southwell, not far from Newark. The Scots' demand for the city's surrender was agreed to by the king and surrender was made on 6 May. There seems little evidence to support a story that, after the surrender, Cleveland was tried and disdainfully dismissed by David Leslie, commander of the Scottish forces. 
Following the popularity of 'The Character of a London-Diurnall' ('ESTC' notes four variants of the 1645 edition), Cleveland published 'The Character of a London-Diurnall: with Several Select Poems' (1647). This was the first time that many of the poems had been published, and it shows how Cleveland's political satires helped to secure his place in popular taste. Eight different variants of this edition exist from 1647. In the same year another volume of mixed prose and poetry was published, 'The Character of a Moderate Intelligencer with Some Select Poems'. Cleveland's works proved tremendously successful. 'Poems by J. C. with Additions', first published in 1651, was reprinted in 1653, 1654, 1656, 1657, 1659, 1661, 1662, 1665, and 1669. Other volumes of his poetry and prose were published in 1658, 1659, 1677, and 1687. Yet another indication of his popularity is the many works not by Cleveland that were published under his name by booksellers keen to exploit his fame. 
Not much seems to be known about what happened to Cleveland after the war. There has been a reasonable assumption that, in Berdan's words, '[l]ike the great majority of the unfortunate cavaliers, he wandered about in complete dependence upon his more fortunate friends' ('Poems', ed. Berdan, 39). He may sometimes have worked on royalist newspapers in London but that remains uncertain. It is certain, on the other hand, that when he was arrested on 10 November 1655 he admitted to having been in London about a year beforehand. His arrest probably took place at Norwich, where he was living in the house of an Edward Cooke. He claimed to be Cooke's private tutor but those who arrested him seem to have been uneasy about the claim, for Cooke was well known as a royalist sympathizer who drew other such folk about him; moreover, Cleveland's genteel garb but lack of funds, along with his role at Newark and his acknowledged abilities, excited suspicion. Consequently he was imprisoned at Great Yarmouth for three months, whereupon he wrote to Cromwell and obtained his release (the exact date of which is not known). The letter to Cromwell has been admired for the way in which its author pleads his cause without demeaning that of his party. 
After his release Cleveland appears to have had no fixed abode. There is a likelihood that from the latter half of 1657 he lived at Gray's Inn, London, and that he received financial support from a John Onebye who came from Hinckley, where the poet's father had been vicar. Cleveland died in London of an intermittent fever on 29 April 1658. He was buried on 1 May at the church of St Michael Royal, College Hill, London, and the preacher at his funeral was Dr John Pearson, one of his contemporaries at Cambridge. 
In 1675 Edward Phillips described Cleveland's high standing as a poet: 'a Notable High soaring Witty Loyalist... he appear'd the first, if not only, Eminent Champion in verse against the 'Presbyterian' Party'. He also noted that some 'Grave Men' declared Cleveland to be 'the best of English Poets' (E. Phillips, 'Theatrum poetarum', 1675, 104-5). But the decline of his reputation, so high during Cleveland's lifetime, had already begun by this point. His use of catachresis, and the influence of that use, were attacked in Dryden's 'An Essay of Dramatick Poesie', 'that which the world has blam'd in our satyrist Cleveland; to express a thing hard and unnaturally, is his new way of Elocution'. Dryden also observed that Cleveland expressed 'common thoughts in abstruse words' (J. Dryden, 'Essay of Dramatick Poesie', 1668, 42-4). The disparagement just quoted is, however, almost immediately followed by praise for lines 63-4 of 'The Rebell Scot'. Samuel Johnson famously added to Dryden's dispraise of Cleveland in his 'Life of Cowley'. The revival of Cleveland's reputation in more recent times effectively dates from Berdan's edition of the poems in 1903.

John Cleveley the younger (1747-1786) and 


@@@@@


doc= 5637


Cleveley family (per. c.1747-1809), marine painters, came to prominence with John Cleveley the elder (c.1712-1777), the son of Samuel Cleveley, a joiner of Newington Butts, Southwark, who was already dead when, perhaps aged about fourteen, his son was apprenticed on 3 November 1726 to another joiner, Thomas Miller. Later he was turned over to John Hall, a shipwright and Deptford boat builder. He first appears in the Deptford rate books (St Paul's parish) in July 1742, for a house in or near Slade's Court, and on 9 June 1743 was sworn a freeman of the Shipwrights' Company on the testimony of Hall and William Houlder, shipwright, although he must then have been long out of indentures. Cleveley's main career was spent as a shipwright in the royal dockyard at Deptford. He lived in King's Yard Row, Dogg Street, at least from 1747, died there in May 1777, and was buried on 21 May at the parish church of St Paul's, Deptford. Letters of administration granted to his widow, Sarah, on 14 June 1778 refer to him both as lately of that parish and as 'Carpenter belonging to his Majesty's Ship the 'Victory' in the pay of his Mys Navy' (General Register Office for England, AA 1777 Farrant). 'Victory' was held in ordinary (reserve) at Chatham from her launch in 1765 until first commissioned for sea in March 1778, so Cleveley may latterly have been attached to her in some capacity, although not as her regular carpenter. 
How Cleveley learned to paint is unknown, although it may have been been through association with ship painters, whose opportunities increased from 1704 when the Admiralty reduced carved ship decoration in favour of painting. The earliest date yet found on his work is 1747, and he specialized in shipping and Thames shipbuilding and launching scenes, especially at the Deptford yard. He also produced other marine views (including of shipbuilding in East Anglia), Hanoverian comings and goings in the royal yachts, sea fights, and ship portraits. The last tend to be repetitive, often with little more than a change of name. Little of the artist's work was engraved, but he contributed shipping to the prints of Sheerness, Chatham, and Plymouth dockyards (1755-6) by Thomas Milton, and possibly those of Deptford, Woolwich, and Portsmouth (1753-4) in the same set. Cleveley was a good draughtsman and colourful painter. His art combines a valuable historical record with much human detail and at its best has an unpretentious grandeur. While not the equal of Samuel Scott, he must have known the latter's work and perhaps that of Canaletto's English period (1746-55). He exhibited at the Free Society from 1764 to 1776, but confusion at the time with his son John ['see below'] makes it unclear how many of the forty-three pictures listed under his name for those years may have been by the younger man. His work is widely dispersed, but the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, has sixteen paintings, the most impressive being a fictitious placing of the 'Royal George' (launched in 1756) off Deptford at the launch of the 'Cambridge' in 1755. This too was a composition he repeated. No portrait of Cleveley is known, but he sometimes seems to have included himself in his work: a view of the 'Buckingham' on the stocks at Deptford (dated 1752 and also at Greenwich) shows a sturdy, respectably dressed figure drawing the scene depicted. 
Cleveley and his wife, Sarah (1722-1798), had seven known children: John and Hannah ('bap'. 1744 and 1747) presumably died in infancy. Another Hannah was baptized in 1750 and Rebecca in 1754. A younger son, James ('bap'. 29 June 1752), was a ship's carpenter and served as such under Captain Cook in the 'Resolution', on Cook's third Pacific voyage (1776-80). 
The couple's other two children were John Cleveley the younger (1747-1786) and Robert Cleveley (1747-1809), twin sons born at Deptford on 25 December 1747 and baptized on 7 January 1748 at St Paul's, Deptford, as were all their siblings. John was apprenticed to his shipwright father on 3 May 1763 but did not complete this training. Instead, probably through his father's artistic connections, he learned to paint in watercolours and do tinted drawings from Paul Sandby, then the drawing instructor at the Royal Military Academy in nearby Woolwich. He was presumably taught oil painting by his father, and was arguably a better painter, but he was known primarily as a watercolour painter and draughtsman, winning a premium for this from the Society of Arts. Many of his drawings were also engraved. While his father signed his paintings 'I. Cleveley', he signed as 'Jno Cleveley, Junr.' at least until 1782. He first exhibited two drawings at the Free Society in 1767, but, of the oil paintings listed under his father's name there up to 1776, some were probably his, as were all twenty-one from 1778 to 1783. All thirty-eight works credited to John Cleveley at the Royal Academy from 1770 to 1786 were presumably his. After first showing drawings there in 1770-71 he was appointed draughtsman to (Sir) Joseph Banks's expedition to Iceland in 1772, and he exhibited two drawings of Iceland at the Royal Academy in 1773. He is widely reported to have been on Captain Phipps's Arctic expedition, which sailed in the 'Racehorse' and 'Carcass' on 3 June 1773, an error springing from his various drawings of it, including those engraved in Phipps's published account and elsewhere. It is now known that these were done at home from sketches brought back by Midshipman Philippe d'Auvergne, later last duc de Bouillon (1754-1816). Cleveley's views of this subject are mainly in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the National Maritime Museum, but which were the pair exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1774 is uncertain. On 23 June 1773 Cleveley himself was present at George III's review of the fleet at Spithead; he exhibited two drawings of it at the academy in each of the years 1774 and 1775, of which three are now in the National Maritime Museum. He also painted this in oils. In 1774 he moved from Deptford to Brewer Street, Golden Square, and from 27 August 1775 to January 1776 he made a voyage to Lisbon. This also produced exhibited views, and a bound-up volume of thirty-seven watercolour and wash drawings from it was sold at Sothebys in 1983 and subsequently dispersed. A number of later watercolours, one shown at the academy in 1781 (and a painting of 1784), were of episodes on Captain Cook's last Pacific voyage (1776-80) and four engraved in aquatint by Francis Jukes were advertised as being based on sketches brought back by his brother James, in the 'Resolution'. 
John Cleveley the younger's exhibited oil works show a broad range of marine subjects, mostly of British and north European situation, but there are few in public collections: the National Maritime Museum has only one confirmed example, with drawings, which are more widely encountered. He died in London on 25 June 1786, probably in Pimlico, which was his Royal Academy exhibiting address from 1783. Nothing has emerged to support the 'Dictionary of National Biography' inference that he may have died in Deptford, whence he had last sent a picture to the academy in 1781 -- probably from his mother's house, since she remained at King's Yard Row until her death in March 1798. 
Robert Cleveley was John Cleveley the younger's twin brother. There is no report of his being taught, as John was, by Paul Sandby, although opportunity and his fine watercolour style make this possible, and he, too, probably learned oil painting from his father. In 1795 a Deptford Dockyard official told Joseph Farington that 'when young he was bred as a Caulker', but disliked it, was laughed at for working in gloves, and gave it up (Farington, 'Diary', 2.308). Probably through his father, he instead gained the 'interest' of Captain William Locker, a significant naval patron of artists. On 4 October 1770 he volunteered for the navy in London, and on 23 October was appointed Locker's clerk in the frigate 'Thames'. He remained in her when George Vandeput took over command in 1773. Vandeput was later described as 'a judicious critic in the arts [and] a great admirer of pictures, particularly those on nautical subjects' ('Naval Chronicle', May 1800, 332). In December 1773 Cleveley followed Vandeput into the 'Asia', which sailed for the North American station until 1777. According to Farington, Vandeput was 'his great friend' (ibid.) in career terms, and on his return he was appointed purser of the storeship 'Camel' (on 31 October 1777), then of the 'Monsieur' (in July 1780). In July 1783 Cleveley was with Vandeput when he took Prince William (later duke of Clarence and William IV) to Hanover, in the royal yacht 'Princess Augusta', and sailed with him on her again in June 1786 when princes Ernest, Augustus, and Adolphus were sent to Gottingen University. On both occasions he was officially mustered as 'assistant to the Clerk of the Kitchen' in the royal entourage. He was also purser of the 'Melampus' (from August 1783), the 'Portland' (December 1783), the 'Swiftsure' (July 1802), and the 'Sussex' (from January 1805 until his death). Most of these ships were stationed in home ports -- the 'Portland' 'in ordinary' and on harbour service at Portsmouth throughout his nearly eighteen years in her, and the 'Sussex' a hospital ship at Sheerness. This explains both how he also sustained a painting career and why he was sometimes referred to as an artist as 'of the Royal Navy' at least until 1795. His will, dated 1808, names him as purser of the 'Sussex' and circumstantially confirms that he was the Robert Cleveley who married Catherine Collett or Collitt at St Pancras on 31 January 1787. 
Although Robert Cleveley produced shipping and coastal views at home and abroad, he was best-known as a painter of the naval actions of the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary Wars, of which many were engraved. He exhibited fifty-one works, including drawings, at the Royal Academy from 1780 to 1803, but not in all years. This was as an 'Honorary Exhibitor' from 1780 to 1786 and as 'of the Navy' from his second appearance in 1782 until 1788, when he sent pictures from the first of three Westminster addresses. Two huge and admired paintings of the beginning and end of Lord Howe's victory at the battle of 1 June 1794 were shown at the premises of the printseller A. C. de Poggi, at 91 New Bond Street, in 1795-6, from which T. Medland and B. T. Pouncy engraved large subscription prints. A separate text booklet includes Cleveley's large fold-out plan of the battle, probably the most detailed of the period. The oils remained together until auctioned at Sothebys in 1981. In 1796 J. F. Rigaud also employed Cleveley to 'retouch' the shipping in his painted ceiling of the court room at Trinity House (now destroyed). From 1791 or 1792 Cleveley was marine draughtsman to the duke of Clarence, and he also became marine painter to the latter's elder brother, the prince of Wales. There are four paintings by him in the National Maritime Museum, which also has drawings and prints, and many elsewhere. In his will, dated 4 April 1808, he gave his address as 'late of Devonshire Street, Portland Place'. He died on 28 September 1809 after accidentally falling 25 feet down a cliff at Dover while visiting a relative there with his wife. A half-length portrait of Cleveley in civilian dress, stipple-engraved by Freeman after Sir William Beechey, was published in the 'Monthly Mirror' in 1810.

Cleverley, Samuel (d. 1824), physician, was the son of William Cleverley, a shipbuilder of Gravesend, Kent. After some schooling at Rochester he appears to have been apprenticed to the Rochester surgeon William Cowper in 1787 before spending two years at the borough hospitals of Guy's and St Thomas's in London. He then moved to Edinburgh, where he took the degree of MD on 24 June 1797 (his inaugural essay was entitled 'De anasarca'). Cleverley next travelled to the continent to carry out further study, and visited Halle, Gottingen, Vienna, and Paris. He was held prisoner in France for eleven years, being confined successively at Fontainebleau, Verdun, and Valenciennes, where he spent the greater part of his detention and where on his arrival he found the prisoners in great need of medical assistance. 'He accordingly proposed to the Committee of Verdun to give them his gratuitous care, which was gladly accepted, and a Dispensary was, in consequence, established, though not without great difficulties, from the French military authorities' ('Authentic Memoirs', 481-2). Cleverley was allowed to return home in 1814, when he received for his services at Valenciennes the grateful thanks of the managing committee of Lloyd's. Cleverley eventually settled in London, where he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, on 22 December 1815, and appointed one of the physicians to the London Fever Hospital. He died at his house in Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square, on 10 November 1824.

Clitheroe, Robert (d. 1334), administrator, came of a family originating at Clitheroe, Lancashire. He held the nearby manor of Bailey, and had licence in 1330 to alienate it to the abbot and convent of Cockersand, for the provision of two chaplains to celebrate divine service daily, in the chapel of St John the Baptist at Bailey, for the souls of Robert and his parents, who are identified by Whitaker as Jordan de Cliderhou and his wife, Cicely. At his trial in the autumn of 1323 it was stated that Clitheroe had been a clerk of the king's chancery for thirty years. This strengthens the case for his identification with the Robert Cliderhou summoned as one of sixteen clerks of the council to the parliament which was called to meet at Lincoln in July 1312, but which actually met at Westminster in August. The trial also identified him as an escheator north of the Trent; he was appointed on 19 February 1315 and was succeeded by Robert Sapy on 27 September 1316. He was also probably the Robert Cliderhou empowered to examine and correct the assessment of the fifteenth in the city of York in September 1316. The name Robert Cliderhou occurs as that of a judicial commissioner of assize or oyer and terminer in various counties between 1310 and 1331, and a Robert Cliderhou was joint keeper of the bishopric of Worcester from 21 October 1313 to 17 February 1314, but it is not certain that these are all references to the same person. 
Clitheroe was instituted as rector of Wigan on 22 September 1303; his death caused a new presentation to be made on 15 June 1334. The court of king's bench sat at Wigan in October and November 1323, in the aftermath of the rebellion of Thomas, earl of Lancaster. Jurors found Clitheroe guilty of sending, at his own expense, two well-mounted men-at-arms (one of them his son Adam) and four footmen, armed with swords, knives, and bows and arrows, to aid Lancaster against the king, and also of preaching publicly in his church at Wigan in support of the earl, calling his enterprise lawful and the king's unlawful, and promising to absolve from their sins those willing to go to the earl's aid, charges which he denied. He was committed to prison, and subsequently bailed, and he paid a fine of $200. Later, in an undated petition attributed to Edward III's reign, he sought redress of grievances arising from these circumstances, but was told that nothing could be done because he had voluntarily agreed to the fine. The episode is a rare illustration of political intervention from the pulpit, and seems to need explanation, since even after his rebellion, Clitheroe continued in royal employment and protection, being still described as king's clerk, for example, in October 1330. One suggestion for the cause of Clitheroe's discontent is that in 1322 he was smarting over accusations made in 1320 that he had committed extensive peculation during his period as escheator.

Cliffe, Henry (c.1280-1334), administrator, was probably born at Cliffe near Selby. An MA by 1307, possibly of Oxford, in 1329 he attested the conveyance of a messuage, La Oriole, which gave its name to Oriel College, Oxford. Between 1316 and 1319 he occurs as chancellor of the Winchester diocese, but his life's interest was to be in royal service. A chancery clerk, he first appears as a temporary keeper of the great seal in 1318 and continued as such at intervals until 12 December 1324. He was also appointed to audit petitions at the York parliament of October 1318 and to respond to them at the Westminster parliament of 1320. A clerical proctor in various parliaments, he represented the dean and chapter of York five times between 1324 and 1332. After serving as keeper of the privy seal from April until July 1325 he was appointed keeper of the chancery rolls, an office he retained until the end of Edward II's reign. Following Isabella's coup in 1326 he was a keeper of Edward II's great seal -- by a legal fiction affixed in the name of the 'keeper of the realm' -- and was with her at Hereford to receive the captured chancery rolls. During Edward III's reign, apart from minor intervals, he remained in office and with custody of the rolls until 8 January 1333, being by virtue of his clerkship attached to the household of Queen Philippa. 
Cliffe's first benefice (1307) was Collingtree rectory with Melton (Northamptonshire). Royal patronage brought others in various counties but, as a chancery clerk, he could not have been forced to reside in any of his rectories. Dean of Tamworth between 1317 and 1319, he subsequently held canonries of York (with Apesthorpe prebend), Salisbury, Wells, and Chichester, being treasurer of the last by 1333. Regularly described as 'clerk', he doubtless did not proceed to higher orders. In 1325 he secured a mortmain licence for a chantry in St Gregory's Priory, Canterbury. The proving of his will in 1334 is the only evidence for the date of his death. It includes bequests to his brother John and John's wife, Emma, and their seven young sons, as well as $20 for the marriage portion of their daughter Isabella. John was also to receive the stock at Apesthorpe and there was a bequest for the parishioners there. Cliffe left $2 apiece to the Dominican, Franciscan, Carmelite, and Augustinian friars of both York and London and other sums to the nunneries of Stratford (also to Alice de Clyffe, a nun there), Clerkenwell, Haliwell, and the Minories outside Aldgate. He wished his body to be buried in the Augustinian priory of Drax, near Cliffe.

Clifford, Anne, countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery (1590-1676), noblewoman and diarist, was born at Skipton Castle in Craven in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 30 January 1590, the only surviving child of George Clifford, third earl of Cumberland (1558-1605), and his wife, Lady Margaret (1560-1616) ['see 'Clifford, Margaret, countess of Cumberland], youngest daughter of Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford. She was brought up in her father's houses at the Charterhouse and in Clerkenwell and at the homes of her mother's Russell relatives, Chenies in Buckinghamshire and North Hall in Hertfordshire. She was educated by her mother and her Russell relatives, all intellectually gifted, her governess Anne Taylor, and until 1602 her tutor, the author Samuel Daniel. The composer Jack (John) Jenkins taught her to play the lute in 1603. She had a dancing master, Stephen, and performed in masques at James I's court. 
Lady Anne's mother was her mentor and remained her exemplar. She and Daniel in particular inspired in their pupil a love of literature, history, the classics, and religious works and fostered her precocious autodidactism and critical bent. To them she owed her piety and biblical knowledge, though she eschewed their puritan convictions. Reading (more often being read to) was for her a lifelong pleasure and a solace in periods of trouble and depression. Having inherited her mother's library, she built up, to quote her officer George Sedgewick, 'a library stored with very choice books, which she read over, not cursorily, but with judgement and observation'. Her breadth of knowledge surprised John Donne, who remarked that 'she knew well how to discourse of all things, from predestination to slea-silk'. Bishop Edward Rainbow attests that her conversation could be not only 'useful and grave, but also pleasant and delightful' (Spence, 'Lady Anne Clifford', 189-90, 14, 223). 
Lady Anne's life was dominated by the great inheritance dispute caused when her father in 1605 bequeathed his estates (for financial reasons) to his brother Francis Clifford, fourth earl of Cumberland, leaving her instead a $15,000 portion. Countess Margaret, as her guardian, initiated claims on Anne's behalf to both the Cliffords' baronial titles, which the earl marshal's court refused in 1606, and the estates. Her archival researches demolished Earl Francis's case for all the estates in the court of wards in 1607, the judges deciding the Skipton properties (though not the other Craven manors) were rightfully Anne's, although her uncle kept possession. 
Lady Anne married, on 25 February 1609, Richard Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, third earl of Dorset (1589-1624), with whom she had three short-lived sons and two daughters, Margaret and Isabella. From 1612 her husband Dorset took charge of her lawsuits, complicating the issues because he stood out for the maximum gain, but in 1615 the court of common pleas decided that he and Anne could have the Skipton and Westmorland estates or the portion, but not both. After her mother's death in May 1616 Anne was isolated, refusing to yield her claim on all the estates despite unpleasantness from Dorset and incessant pressure from James I's courtiers. She suffered a period of ill health and withdrawal. Worse followed when she refused to accept the king's award in February 1617 which settled the dispute by giving all the estates to Earl Francis and his male heirs and $17,000 in compensation to Dorset and Anne, which her husband then pocketed. 
Countess Anne's marriage had been deeply scarred by the bitter quarrels with Dorset -- over the estates, his profligacy, and his infidelities. She became perforce far more independent-minded, self-reliant, and worldly-wise. She helped with cash her uncle's Westmorland tenants who opposed him in the law courts and supported his political opponents in the north-west. She also indulged her artistic and literary tastes by erecting monuments to her cousin Lady Frances Bourchier in Chenies church, to her mother in Appleby church, and in 1620 to Edmund Spenser, a favourite author, in Westminster Abbey. Her burgeoning interest in her family's history and her father's achievements led her to commission an illustrated volume of his sea enterprises and the antiquary St Loe Kniveton to write up her mother's legal archives in two books. Her own diary for these years has survived in part. 
Dorset's death in 1624 made Countess Anne wealthy, with a generous jointure of $2000 a year landed income in Sussex and Essex, and independent. Her daughters' welfare and her claim for the estates were her overriding concerns, hence her purchase of their wardships from the crown. Besides living with her relatives, she frequented the court, with an eye to Lady Margaret's marriage and her own. The suitable match for Lady Margaret was John, Lord Tufton, later second earl of Thanet (1609-1664), the wedding being celebrated on 21 April 1629. The countess added to the Sussex manors provided by Dorset for Lady Margaret's portion several from her own jointure holding. Feeling the need for greater financial security and political support in her campaign for the estates because Earl Francis's heir, her cousin Henry Clifford, had been elevated to the Lords, she married, on 3 June 1630, Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery and fourth earl of Pembroke (1584-1650), Charles I's lord chamberlain. He brought her great wealth, power, royal influence, and a life at court, what she needed to counter 'the envie, malice and sinister practices' of her enemies Henry Clifford and her brother-in-law Edward, fourth earl of Dorset, who resented her occupying so much Sackville property (Spence, 'Lady Anne Clifford', 94). 
With Henry Clifford lacking male heirs, Countess Anne could anticipate the king's award taking effect at his death. She reached an agreement with Pembroke in December 1634 which ensured her possession of the Westmorland lordships while he would hold Skipton on a life interest and raise $5000 there towards her daughter Lady Isabella's portion. Soon after they had a great quarrel -- over the estates or his infidelities -- and he banished her from London. For eight years she and Lady Isabella lived at his Wiltshire houses, although he joined with her in making formal claims to the estates. On the outbreak of the civil war in 1642 Pembroke requested her to reside in his Baynard's Castle in London to safeguard his rich household belongings, which he moved there. She did not leave for six years and negotiated from there Lady Isabella's marriage on 5 July 1647 to James Compton, third earl of Northampton (1622-1681), the portion being Sussex manors Dorset had assigned Isabella in 1624. 
Although the hostilities prevented Countess Anne from entering her estates following Henry Clifford's death in December 1643, she appointed officers in Westmorland and also in Craven, Pembroke's interest notwithstanding. His death in January 1650, six months after she had ridden north, brought her a second jointure estate, in Kent, worth $2000 a year in rents, adding to her now great landed wealth. Moreover, she now had the freedom of action to overthrow the king's award. In Westmorland the issue was the rate of entry fines set by the award. Determined and abrasive, she was successful in November 1656 after years of costly litigation and ejections of tenants in a manner which tarnishes her image. Her object in Craven was to oust Henry Clifford's heirs, Richard Boyle, earl of Burlington (1612-1698), and his countess, Elizabeth, from the properties awarded Earl Francis in 1607. Their Skipton town and her own Silsden tenants bore the brunt of her litigation until she conceded defeat in 1657. But she widened her campaign by championing her Clifford fee as a liberty separate from Staincliffe wapentake which was in Burlington's hands. This alarmed the Yorkshire political establishment who, fearing her love of controversy and lawsuits, blocked her by resort to the courts. Burlington's retaliation, invoking the financial safeguards of the award, threatened not just Countess Anne's Sussex jointure estates but also the Dorsets', Thanets', and Northamptons' interests in them. It appears to have succeeded in curbing Countess Anne's claims to Burlington's Craven properties. She was particularly intransigent during the 1660s, exploiting her powers as hereditary sheriff of Westmorland to defy court orders over paying rents to Sackville College, the East Grinstead almshouses she and Dorset had founded. 
The last thirty years of Countess Anne's life, starting at Baynard's in 1646, were immensely creative. She commissioned there two copies of the great triptych, one for each daughter, an exaltation of her noble family and her right to the inheritance (painted by Jan van Belcamp and possibly Peter Lely). She had Kniveton's volumes rewritten and expanded, with contributions from the antiquary Roger Dodsworth, into three great books of record (three copies), a documentary assertion of her title. At Skipton Castle in 1652 she inserted in them her summary of the lives of her forebears and thereafter entered yearly a memorial of her life. Subsequently, she added to her collections two histories of her forebears compiled by the judge and antiquary Sir Matthew Hale, two copies of Earl George's voyages, a book of heraldry, genealogies, and a volume of her mother's letters, which, with the numerous legal documents, mark her as a family historian of special note. 
Countess Anne has an outstanding reputation as a builder, restorer, and conservator, a passion indulged on her ancestral estates from 1650 as a very wealthy landowner with about $8000 gross yearly income. In Westmorland she repaired her four castles: Appleby, Brougham, which had been damaged in the civil war, Brough, which had burnt down in 1521, and Pendragon, destroyed by the Scots in 1341. In Craven she restored Skipton Castle so far as she was allowed, following its slighting by parliament in 1648, and Barden Tower, which had been disroofed by the combatants. Her restoration of churches helped revitalize religious observance on her estates, where she defiantly continued to use the proscribed 'Book of Common Prayer' through the 1640s and 1650s, and, unlike her castles, the churches are all still standing. In Westmorland her work is visible at St Lawrence and St Michael's, Bongate, Appleby, at St Wilfrid's and St Ninian's (Ninekirks), Brougham, at St Mary's Chapel, Outhgill, Mallerstang, and at her oratory at Appleby Castle. Her renovations at Holy Trinity, Skipton, and the chapel of Barden Tower were extensive. In 1632 she had, with Pembroke's help, completed the building and endowing of her mother's Beamsley almshouses near Skipton. Between 1651 and 1653 she erected almshouses in Appleby, St Anne's Hospital, initially a retirement home for her women attendants. Plaques on all her buildings publicized her inherited rights to her father's lands and titles. Even more illuminating of her sense of ancestral pride and title were the coats of arms on the triptychs, the inner walls of the hospital, and her fine monuments in Skipton church to her father and in Appleby church to herself. The last also bear uncompromising inscriptions. Her most public demonstration was the shields and inscription on the Countess's Pillar, which she erected near Brougham in 1654 to mark her last parting from her mother. Her other monuments commemorated Samuel Daniel, in Beckington church, Somerset, and her clerk of works, Gabriel Vincent, who directed all her building, in Brough church. 
Countess Anne spent the last twenty years of her life as a grand lady, dressed in her favourite black. Her brown eyes and, when young, brown hair worn waist length, complemented a shapely figure, of which she was very proud. In spite of her small stature -- less than 5 feet tall -- she had a formidable presence, and the strength of will which was a frequently remarked facet of her complex personality is revealed in portraits of her from her middle twenties in a stubbornness about the mouth and chin. Latterly she progressed from castle to castle, receiving in audience a stream of titled relatives and friends who came to pay their respects to her. Living frugally herself, she kept rigorous account of her finances. Her household was a place of piety, charity, and hospitality, her regime beneficent, religious, and, in the best sense of the term, baronial. It ended on 22 March 1676, in Brougham Castle. She was buried on 14 April in the vault she had built for herself in St Lawrence, Appleby.

Clifford, Arthur (1777-1830), family historian, was born on 5 July 1777, the fourth son of the nine children of Thomas Clifford (1732-1787), fourth son of Hugh Clifford, third Lord Clifford of Chudleigh (1700-1732). His mother was Barbara Aston (1744-1786), youngest daughter and coheir of James, fifth Lord Aston of Forfar (1723-1751); through her the estate of Tixall, in Staffordshire, came into the Clifford family. With his twin brother, Lewis (died 1806), Arthur Clifford became a pupil at the English College at Douai in September 1786; when the college was taken over by French revolutionary forces, both were imprisoned, with the professors and other students. After their release, they returned to England, and reached London in March 1795; Lewis later wrote a brief account of their captivity. After spending a term at Stonyhurst College, Arthur Clifford rejoined some of his former fellow prisoners at St Edmund's College, Old Hall Green, near Ware, in late 1795. In May or June 1809 he married Eliza Matilda (died 1827), daughter of Captain John Macdonnell of Leagh, Inverness-shire; the couple had one daughter and two sons, the eldest of whom, Arthur Lewis (1818-1841), became a Jesuit. 
In 1809 Clifford published 'The State Papers and Letters of Sir Ralph Sadler' (2 vols.); Sadler's granddaughter Gertrude had married Sir Walter (later Lord) Aston (1584-1639) and Clifford drew his materials from original manuscripts found at Tixall. Allegedly stored in an old oaken box and preserved by female members of the family from destruction, the papers had been deciphered, copied, and generally prepared for publication by John Kirk (1760-1851) in the 1790s. Thus Clifford's part in the preparation of the collection for publication must have been relatively small, as Sir Walter Scott wrote both the memoir of Sadler's life and the historical notes that accompanied the work. These tasks interrupted Scott's writing of 'Marmion' (1808), and involved the poet in correspondence with the Durham antiquary Robert Surtees (1779-1834). 'The State Papers and Letters' received an unfavourable review in the 'Edinburgh Review', where the critic opined that 'its inaccuracy is still more remarkable than its beauty... the whole publication bears the marks of great negligence and precipitancy on the part of all concerned' ('EdinR', 16, August 1810, 461). Nevertheless, it was a far more complete publication than the earlier 1720 collection of Sadler's papers. 
At Tixall, Clifford also found letters and papers relating to the family of Sir Walter Aston; this discovery led to his publication in 1813 of 'Tixall Poetry', a collection of poems either written or transcribed by members of the Aston family, concluding with Clifford's own verses. Among these was his 'Midnight Meditation among the Ruins of Tixall', also published separately. 'Tixall Poetry' was the subject of two complimentary essays in Nathan Drake's 'Evenings in Autumn' (2 vols., 1822). Of more note, however, was Clifford's collection 'Tixall letters, or, Correspondence of the Aston family and their friends during the seventeenth century' (1815), which sheds light on the family life of the seventeenth-century Catholic gentry. It includes interesting correspondence relating to Walter Aston's conversion to Roman Catholicism and the courtship by his son Herbert (promoted avidly by his sister Constantia) of his future wife, Catherine Thimelby, as well as the letters of Winefred Thimelby, an abbess in Louvain, to Herbert. Clifford also published 'Collectanea Cliffordiana' (1817), a miscellany of material relating to his family, including a tragedy from his own pen; in the same year he also published, with his elder brother Sir Thomas Hugh Constable Clifford, 'A Topographical and Historical Description of the Parish of Tixall'. 
Both these works were published in Paris: Clifford's unfortunate experiences during the revolutionary years do not seem to have prejudiced him against France, as he lived and wrote for many years in the French capital. In addition to editing a paper for the French publisher Galignani, he also wrote guides for him to Paris (n.d.), France (1822), Italy (1823), and Switzerland (1823). He also seems to have acted as editor of the 'Antiquities and Anecdotes of the City of Paris' (n.d.). Clifford also published (in Oxford) several works on the teaching of languages, especially Greek and Latin. He died at Winchester on 16 January 1830.

Clifford, Sir Augustus William James, first baronet (1788-1877), naval officer and court official, was born abroad on 26 May 1788, the illegitimate son of William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire (1748-1811), and Lady Elizabeth Foster (1757-1824) ['see 'Cavendish, Elizabeth Christiana], daughter of the fourth earl of Bristol and wife of John Thomas Foster MP (died 1796); she married Cavendish on 19 October 1809. He was educated at Harrow School (1796-9). Throughout his career he benefited from the generosity of his half-brother, the sixth duke, who settled $2000 a year on him on their father's death in 1811, and an even more generous settlement at his marriage in 1813. He entered the navy as a midshipman in May 1800, under the auspices of Earl Spencer, then first lord of the Admiralty, and was promoted to a lieutenancy in 1806. He served at the capture of St Lucia and Tobago in 1803, and throughout the operations in Egypt during 1807, and was involved in the capture of a convoy in the Bay of Rosas in 1809 (for which he received a medal), and in the operations on the coast of Italy in 1811 and 1812. After this, as captain, he was for many years actively employed in naval duties, being several times mentioned in the 'London Gazette' for his courage in cutting-out expeditions and on other occasions. For some time he was in attendance on the lord high admiral, the duke of Clarence (afterwards William IV), and in 1828 he took Lord William Bentinck as governor-general to India. This was his last service afloat, and he was not actively employed after 1831. 
Clifford obtained the rank of rear-admiral in 1848, vice-admiral in 1855, admiral of the blue on 7 November 1860, and admiral of the red in 1864, becoming retired admiral on 31 March 1866. He was whig MP for the duke of Devonshire's Irish pocket boroughs: Bandon Bridge (1818-20), Dungarvan (1820-22), and Bandon Bridge again (23 July 1831 to 3 December 1832). He was nominated CB on 8 December 1815, knighted on 4 August 1830, and created a baronet on 4 August 1838. 
The duke of Devonshire, then lord chamberlain, appointed Clifford on 25 July 1832 gentleman usher of the black rod, which office he held, much to his satisfaction, until his death. On various occasions between 1843 and 1866 he acted as deputy lord great chamberlain of England, in the absence of Lord Willoughby d'Eresby. He was a patron of the arts, and formed a collection of paintings, sculpture, etchings, engravings, and 'bijouterie'. He died at his residence, Royal Court, in the House of Lords on 8 February 1877. 
On 20 October 1813, Clifford had married Lady Elizabeth Frances Townshend, sister of John, fourth Marquess Townshend. She was born on 2 August 1789, and died at Nice on 10 April 1862. They had three sons and two daughters; Captain William John Cavendish Clifford RN (1814-1882) succeeded his father as second baronet. The baronetcy became extinct in 1895.

Clifford, Sir Conyers (d. 1599), soldier and president of Connacht, was the eldest son of George Clifford of Bobbing Court in Kent and his wife, Ursula, daughter of Roger Finch. William, Richard, Thomas, and Conyers Clifford went to Ireland as a family group in the 1570s (the precise relationship between them is unknown), and settled in co. Roscommon under the auspices of the Connacht presidency. William was sufficiently well established as a landowner by 1585 to be allowed concessions in the 1585 composition agreement. Conyers was attached to Roscommon Castle while serving with Sir Nicholas Malby during the early 1580s. However, his military experience was limited and was gained mainly while serving in Europe, usually under the earl of Essex. He was taken prisoner at Lisle in September 1588 but was exchanged for a Spanish prisoner. He was praised for his 'forwardness and good directions' when serving as a captain under Essex during the siege of Rouen in 1591 and was knighted in that year. Through his association with Essex, Clifford represented Pembroke borough in the parliament of 1593. Together with his brother Nicholas he was conferred with the degree of MA by the University of Cambridge at a special congregation in 1594/5. He married, after 1594, Mary, daughter of Francis Southwell, of Wymondham Hall, Norfolk, widow of Thomas Sydney of Kent and of Nicholas Gorges of London (died 1594). They had two sons, Henry and Conyers, and a daughter, Frances, who died young. Clifford's wife survived him, and subsequently married Sir Anthony St Leger; she died on 19 December 1603, aged thirty-seven. 
Clifford again served with Essex in 1596 during the Spanish siege of Calais. He was sergeant-major in the expedition against Cadiz later in the same year, had charge of the 'Dreadnaught' with Alexander Clifford, and served on the council. His share of the plunder, $3256, was among the highest recorded. The Nine Years' War was in progress in Ireland when Clifford was appointed chief commissioner of Connacht on 2 December 1596. Having arrived in Dublin on 4 January 1597, he was dispatched to Connacht on 8 February to replace the suspended Sir Richard Bingham. He was effective in limiting the impact on Connacht of the war in Ulster, although hampered by the numbers of Irish in the ranks of his soldiers. He was respected by the Irish as 'better and more faithful to his promises' than Bingham had been (O Clerigh, 1.133). He recaptured Sligo Castle from O'Donnell in March 1597, but was defeated at Ballyshannon in July-August in an attempted two-pronged military offensive on Ulster. 
Officially appointed president of Connacht with effect from 1 January 1598 (by letters patent dated 4 September 1597), Clifford was normally based at Athlone Castle thereafter. His annual fee was $140 and he had a lease of the manor and demesnes of Athlone and Ballymote, and of the abbey of Boyle. He regarded his instructions for the civil government of Connacht as impractical until military victory had been achieved in Ulster. In summer 1599 he led a military expedition north towards Collooney to relieve O'Connor Sligo, then being besieged by Hugh O'Donnell. On 5 August 1599 Clifford was fatally shot by O'Donnell's supporters in an ambush in the Curlew Mountains just north of Boyle, co. Roscommon. Over 200 of his soldiers were killed in the ambush. His body was buried in the monastery at Trinity Island in Lough Key, but his head was taken to Collooney by Brian Oge O'Rourke to be displayed before O'Connor Sligo as a trophy. The King family erected a small tower to mark the spot where Clifford died in the townland of Garroo.

Clifford, George, third earl of Cumberland (1558-1605), courtier and privateer, was born on 8 August 1558 in Brougham Castle, Westmorland, the eldest son of Henry Clifford, second earl of Cumberland (1517-1570), and his second wife, Anne ('c'.1538-1581), daughter of William, third Baron Dacre. He spent his early years on his father's estates near his birthplace, and at Skipton Castle in Yorkshire; his education at this stage was Roman Catholic. In January 1570 his father died and George inherited the title and estate, although since he was under age he became a ward of the crown. The wardship was granted to Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, with whom George's father had already been in negotiations concerning the boy's marriage to one of Bedford's daughters. George therefore went to live among the devoutly protestant Russells at Chenies in Hertfordshire. In 1571 he became a student at Trinity College, Cambridge, with the master and future archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, as his tutor. According to his daughter Anne Clifford, who was his first biographer, it was his love of mathematics which led him to take an interest in navigation. Having graduated MA at Cambridge in 1576, he may also have undertaken a more informal course of study at Oxford. 
On 24 June 1577 in the church of St Saviour, Southwark, in the presence of the queen, Cumberland wed Lady Margaret Russell ['see 'Clifford, Margaret, countess of Cumberland (1560-1616)], the daughter of his guardian, the earl of Bedford. This marriage had long been planned by the families. They had a daughter, Anne, and two sons, Francis and George, both of whom died young. The marriage is reckoned not to have been happy, although the evidence of letters the earl wrote from time to time to his 'sweet Meg' suggests that this was not always the case. The countess worried about the immense debts her spendthrift husband built up and described her life as 'a dance to the pilgrimage of grief' (Williamson, 'George, Third Earl of Cumberland', 285), which suggests a depressive character. The earl had at least two illegitimate children with different mistresses. At some point in the 1590s the couple began to live apart, although a reconciliation was effected as Clifford lay dying and after he had written begging his wife's forgiveness. 
His education and marriage complete, Cumberland became a courtier of Queen Elizabeth. He was never a major political figure under Elizabeth, and was not given a place on her privy council; he did not receive, to his chagrin, a military command under the queen, nor could he be described as one of her most powerful favourites. Nevertheless, he was a most loyal courtier and played an important ceremonial role at court. He enjoyed royal favour, and the distinction of a royal nickname; he was Elizabeth's 'rogue'. It seems likely that the queen underestimated Clifford's abilities, but it is understandable perhaps that she should. His most important promotion at court was achieved in 1590, when he was made the queen's champion, a position he held until her death. The main duties involved in this post were to perform at the jousts, especially those held annually to commemorate the queen's accession, when he also gave a speech, some examples of which have survived. Clifford entered enthusiastically into the rich life of a courtier. To quote his puritanical daughter, who perhaps was remembering her mother's views on this: he had 'an extreme love for horse races, tiltings, bowling matches and shooting... and hunting, and all such expensive sports did contribute the more to the wasting of his estate' (Williamson, 'George, Third Earl of Cumberland', 17). He played a more serious role in affairs from time to time, sitting in 1586 on the commission which tried Mary, queen of Scots, and attending her execution the following year at Fotheringhay. 
It was partly to recoup some of his losses as a gambler and a courtier that in 1586 Cumberland began his career as a privateer. The war with Spain was just beginning, and Cumberland was also keen to do his patriotic duty and win honour and glory in the maritime sphere, which had interested him since his student days. The first privateering venture he financed he did not himself accompany. Four ships, including two which he had just purchased, the 'Red Dragon' and the 'Bark Clifford', sailed from Gravesend under Robert Withrington, with instructions to emulate Drake and sail round the Horn to the south seas, where much valuable plunder was to be had. Instead the small fleet turned back without leaving the Atlantic, and gained a few minor prizes off Brazil at the loss of a number of lives. The venture was a considerable waste of money. 
The escalating conflict with Spain allowed Cumberland to gain his first personal taste of naval action. In 1587 he sailed across the channel in an attempt to help protect Sluys from the duke of Parma. He arrived too late to prevent the fall of Sluys and instead visited the earl of Leicester's camp at Bergen-op-Zoom. Cumberland played a brave part in the Armada campaign of 1588, offering his two ships for service in the English fleet, and serving himself on board a royal ship, the 'Elizabeth Bonaventure'. He was included in Howard's council of war, fought courageously at the battle off Gravelines, and after the Spanish had retreated north of Harwich he was sent by the admiral to report to the queen at Tilbury. He then returned to the fleet, to help guard against any attempt by Parma to invade from the Netherlands. The earl completed this eventful year by setting out on the first privateering voyage which he himself accompanied, commanded, and financed. The queen lent two royal ships for this expedition, which was intended to intercept enemy shipping in the channel. Cumberland took one insignificant prize, but the royal ship the 'Golden Lion' lost its mast while at anchor in a storm. 
During the next ten years Cumberland engaged, either as commander or as promoter, in a privateering voyage every year. The expedition of 1589 was, unusually, a financial success, although with more luck it might have been much more lucrative still. Cumberland commanded the 'Victory', a royal ship, and took three of his own. He was accompanied by two professional naval commanders, Christopher Lister and William Monson, the latter a man with whom he was to work on other occasions, and with whom he later quarrelled violently. They sailed for the Azores, but narrowly missed intercepting both the Portuguese carracks returning from the East Indies and the Spanish silver fleet sailing from the West. They did take one very rich prize, worth apparently $100,000, but it sank in a storm in Mount's Bay, off Cornwall, as it was being escorted home. Nevertheless, some of its cargo was salvaged, and this, together with the other vessels taken and the proceeds from pillaging Santa Cruz, in the Azores, enabled Cumberland to make a profit on this expedition. He showed his bravery during the voyage, being wounded in an action at St Marie in the Azores, and sharing the considerable suffering of his men as they struggled home with low stocks of water and the wind against them. 
In 1590 Cumberland financed two small privateering ventures, which sailed without him and probably broke even financially. The expedition of 1591 he accompanied himself. It involved an attempt to blockade the coast of Spain, while Lord Thomas Howard patrolled the Azores awaiting the Portuguese carracks. Cumberland did not show a profit on this expedition, although his action in dispatching one of his ships to warn Howard of the approach of a Spanish fleet saved much of the Royal Navy from danger. In 1592 Cumberland, undaunted by his previous financial failures, planned to take an expedition across the Atlantic and to harry the Spanish West Indies. He was held up at Plymouth for three months by bad weather, thus missing the chance to cross the ocean, and when the fleet departed with the more limited goal of the Azores, he did not accompany it; it was led instead by John Norton. It joined up with a royal fleet under Sir John Burgh, and together they captured the great Portuguese carrack the 'Madre de Dios' and her cargo of spices, silks, and jewels, estimated to be worth $500,000. Much of the profit from the voyage was lost, plundered by the sailors, and the queen claimed the main share of what was left. This led to a rather bitter dispute between Elizabeth and Cumberland, which ended in the earl's recovering $36,000, which eased his financial position a little while tempting him to continue to try his luck as a privateer. 
The following year Cumberland understandably set off for the Azores again, hoping to net another carrack. The voyage was cut short, however, by the earl's illness. He was close to death and his life was only saved by Captain Monson, at great personal risk, securing a cow from the island of Corvo in order to supply him with milk. The bulk of the fleet turned for home to enable their leader to recover his health. In 1594 Cumberland, who from now on worked increasingly closely with syndicates of London merchants, dispatched another fleet to the Azores. It came tantalizingly close to capturing two great carracks, the 'Cince Chagas' of 2000 tons, and the 'San Felipe' of 1500 tons; but the first ship sank after being set on fire in the fight, and the second fought off the privateers. The losses to the earl on this expedition were considerable. Undaunted by this reverse, he commissioned late in 1594 the building at Deptford of the largest ship ever built by an English subject, the 600 ton 'Malice Scourge', which cost $6000. The expedition of 1595 was a somewhat limited affair, which the earl did not accompany, but the 'Malice Scourge' was at least given her sea trials. 
Weighed down with debts, Cumberland suffered two further barren years. Efforts to prosecute a successful expedition early in 1596 were frustrated when the queen ordered him to return to England to station himself off Dover for defensive purposes as the Spanish attacked Calais. The following year his voyage was cut short again, this time when the 'Malice Scourge' lost her main mast in a storm no more than 40 leagues out at sea, and was forced to limp home for repairs. 
In 1598 Cumberland set out on his last and most glorious expedition, financed by him and his London merchant backers. He took a substantial fleet of twenty vessels, six of which he owned himself, with 1000 seamen and 700 soldiers. After taking a few prizes on the way, the fleet arrived in the West Indies, where Cumberland succeeded in taking San Juan de Puerto Rico. This town had been previously attacked unsuccessfully in 1595 by Drake. Cumberland displayed considerable military skill in devising a successful means of capturing this strongly defended town. He entered the thick of the fighting and would have drowned, having fallen in full armour into a defensive moat, had he not been rescued by one of his officers. The capture of the port proved to be of no great value, however. Like many English strategists, Cumberland had high hopes of establishing a permanent settlement in the West Indies from which to attack the Spanish. But the reality was very different. His men began to die of dysentery in increasing numbers, and in the end he was forced to abandon his conquest and sail home, with very little plunder to show for his expensive investment. He had, however, succeeded in disrupting the economy of the great Spanish empire: as a result of his raid the plate fleet did not sail to Spain in 1598. Although this was the last privateering expedition of the earl, he continued to take an interest in maritime matters; in 1601, when the East India Company was founded, he was one of the original members, and his ship the 'Malice Scourge' was commissioned as one of the first merchantmen employed by the company. 
Cumberland's last years were spent in desperate efforts to clear his debts. He seems to have become, rather late in life, more responsible, surprising his friends with a new restraint as a gambler. He began a concerted effort with his estate officials to recover some control over his lands. A process of renegotiating the terms on which his property was leased began, in the course of which large sums of money were raised, which were then used to pay off his debts. He remained active in the life of the court at the end of Elizabeth's reign, sitting on the commission which condemned his friend the earl of Essex in 1601. He was able to transfer his loyalty successfully from Elizabeth to James I. In 1603 he rode north to welcome the new king into his kingdom. James was quick to recognize the value of Cumberland, and appointed him to his privy council. The earl was given an important role to play in the new Stuart settlement of the Anglo-Scottish border. He was appointed warden of the west and middle marches and applied himself assiduously to the pacification of this area, a project which was greatly assisted by the union of the two crowns, and in which as a landowner on the border he had a personal stake. 
Cumberland had lived a full and unhealthy life. He died from 'a bloody flux' (Spence, 215) -- probably dysentery -- on 29 October 1605 at the duchy house by the Savoy in London. Not being survived by any of his sons, in his will he left his lands and titles to his brother Francis Clifford, which would be the cause of a major dispute when his daughter Anne questioned this settlement. He was buried on 29 December 1605 in the family vault at Holy Trinity, Skipton. 
There are many portraits of Cumberland, which show him resplendent as a dazzling aristocratic courtier. Perhaps the best example hangs in the National Maritime Museum; the work of Nicholas Hilliard, it depicts Cumberland as the queen's champion, his hat adorned with the jewelled glove given to him by Elizabeth as a token. Two centuries ago the great antiquary William Whitaker took a look at his embalmed body in the crypt of Skipton church and reported with relish that the portraitists had none of them shown the three warts on his cheek. The judgement of Whitaker on the character and achievements of Cumberland has left its mark on his later biographers. He was 'a great but unamiable man' whose story 'admirably illustrates the difference... between fame and virtue' (Whitaker, 2.354). Whitaker acknowledged the earl's military prowess but condemned him as an unkind father, a faithless husband, and a poor manager of his estates. What Whitaker neglected to weigh in the balance was Cumberland's pious commitment to his family's tradition of absolute loyalty to the Tudor crown. His estate and his marriage were to some degree sacrificed to this.

Clifford, Henry, tenth Baron Clifford (1454-1523), magnate, was the eldest son of John Clifford, ninth Baron Clifford (1435-1461), and his wife, Margaret Bromflete (died 1493). A pillar of the house of Lancaster, John Clifford was killed in 1461, on the day before the battle of Towton, and was subsequently attainted, his family's lands being mainly granted to the Nevilles and Stanleys. But there is no evidence, later stories to the contrary notwithstanding, that the seven-year-old Henry Clifford was ever pursued by vengeful Yorkists, and the legend of the Shepherd Lord first recounted by Edward Hall in the mid-sixteenth century -- telling of the young fugitive brought up among remote sheepfolds, so that he never learned to read, while his younger brother Richard was smuggled overseas, where he died -- hardly stands up to scrutiny. Henry Clifford was later to be not just literate but even bookish, owning volumes on law and medicine, and developing a taste for astronomy and alchemy, while his brother is recorded in England as late as 1499. It may be that the Clifford heir thought it prudent to keep a low profile, but the fact that in 1466 Henry Harlington of Craven could bequeath him a sword and a silver bowl suggests that even then he stood in no perceptible danger. The possibility that he would recover his inheritance arose briefly in 1470-71, during the readeption of Henry VI, when John Neville, Marquess Montagu, was granted the Clifford lordship of Skipton specifically during Henry Clifford's minority. But though this prospect disappeared when Montagu, with his brother the earl of Warwick, was killed at Barnet on 14 April 1471, Clifford was no more imperilled by his Lancastrian connections than he had been before, and on 16 March 1472 Edward IV granted him a formal pardon. 
The king's clemency did at least give Clifford the prospect of succeeding to his mother's hereditary estates, based on Londesborough in the East Riding of Yorkshire, but she lived until 1493, and there is no evidence as to how he passed the years from 1472 to 1485, beyond engaging in at least one liaison which brought him an illegitimate son. The overthrow of Richard III on 22 August 1485 changed Clifford's position at once. In September he was appointed a commissioner in Yorkshire and a JP in Westmorland, and in November he successfully petitioned parliament for the reversal of his father's attainder, so obtaining restoration of the Clifford lands and title. Henry VII needed loyal supporters in the north of England, his predecessor's power base, and he built up the position of the new Lord Clifford accordingly. In May 1486 he was granted the offices of chief steward of the lordship of Middleham and bailiff of the franchise of Richmond, and about the end of that year he married Anne St John (died 1508), daughter of the king's mother's half-brother. In 1494 Clifford was dubbed a knight of the Bath. He remained almost unfailingly loyal to the crown, campaigning against the Scots in 1497 and leading a force at Flodden in 1513, and perhaps acting as a member of the council headed by Archbishop Thomas Savage, through which Henry VII endeavoured to extend his power in Yorkshire. But at the same time he used royal service as a means of rebuilding his family's position in the north. 
Clifford's activities on his own behalf were not always well received. In April 1486 he notified the authorities in York that he intended to come to that city, there 'to mynistre as myn auncistres haith done here to fore in all thinges that accordith to my dewtie...' (Attreed, 479-80), only to be firmly informed by the city fathers that no member of his family had ever exercised authority there. In spite of this rebuff, when Yorkist rebels approached York in June 1487 in the name of Lambert Simnel, Clifford was forward to defend the city, although in the event his performance was somewhat inglorious, since he was defeated in a night-time skirmish and lost his baggage. In 1488 he and his wife joined York's Corpus Christi Guild, but he was still regarded with suspicion there, for in May 1489 the citizens refused to admit him to the city, on the grounds that his claims represented a threat to the rule of the mayor and aldermen. They were probably right to suspect his intentions; in 1513 Clifford demanded the leadership of the city's troops, and was once more refused. 
Clifford was more successful on his home territory, in the West Riding of Yorkshire and in Westmorland. He moved round properties where no Clifford had been seen for a quarter of a century, staying in castles that he repaired or rebuilt; his works at Skipton and Barden were particularly extensive. To raise money Clifford exploited his feudal rights of wardship and marriage -- in 1518, for instance, selling the marriage of the heir to Askham in Westmorland for 100 marks -- and applied himself to the improvement of his own estates, on one occasion provoking a suit to the council against his enclosures. Such was his success that by 1496 a year's revenue from the lordship of Skipton amounted to little less than $300, and at his death his total annual income was assessed at $1332 2's'. 4died, placing him in the top third of the English nobility for wealth. Full coffers gave Clifford the means to make friends and form alliances in circles lay and ecclesiastical. He was a benefactor to the monasteries of Shap, Bolton, Guisborough (where in 1508 he and his wife were enrolled in the priory's confraternity), and above all Mount Grace, which benefited substantially from his munificence. He established links with northern gentry families both through marriage alliances, for instance bestowing his daughters Margaret and Dorothy on Cuthbert Radcliffe and Hugh Lowther respectively, and through retaining fees. In 1493 he indented to pay Ralph Eure, the son of Sir William Eure, 10 marks yearly for services done and to be done. And no doubt he hoped to win approval through lavish hospitality, like the 'great Christmas' recorded as held at Brough in 1521, shortly before a fire largely destroyed the castle. 
Restoring his lordship was not an easy business for Henry Clifford, whose frequent abrasiveness as landlord and neighbour several times prompted or threatened disorder, and so led to royal disapproval, at a time when the king was paying a good deal of attention to the extension of his authority and the maintenance of order in the north. Henry VII may have hoped to bring Clifford under closer control by a 'quo warranto' action challenging the latter's hereditary shrievalty of Westmorland, and although Clifford was eventually confirmed in his family's traditional rights, he appears to have fallen foul of the king again by leading resistance to royal taxation in Yorkshire, and was heavily fined. None the less Clifford attended Henry VII's funeral in 1509, and lent 1000 marks to Henry VIII in 1522. The fact that his wife was the king's kinswoman by marriage had not saved Clifford from royal displeasure, indeed, it may have served to lower him in Henry VII's eyes, for his marriage to Anne St John proved unhappy, thanks at least in part to Clifford's infidelity (he had two or three illegitimate children), and by 1499 a separation was being mooted. In the end the couple remained together until Anne died in 1508. By July 1511 Clifford had remarried; his new wife was Florence Pudsey (died 1558), widow of Sir Thomas Talbot. This marriage, too, turned out badly, culminating in a suit which Florence brought in the church court at York, demanding restitution of her conjugal rights. Her husband's riposte was to accuse her of adultery with one of his household officers. Even so, Lord Clifford's second marriage, like his first, was to endure. 
In addition to his marital difficulties, Henry Clifford also found himself at loggerheads with his son and heir, another Henry Clifford, who was born about 1493, and brought up at court with the future Henry VIII. Some time after 1511 Lord Clifford complained of his son's unruliness and extravagance, not least the way in which he paraded in cloth of gold, 'more lyk a duke than a pore baron's sonne as hee ys' (Whitaker, 327). If the son had ideas above his station, the responsibility was largely his father's, who not only placed him at court but also set about marrying him into the high aristocracy. A union with the Talbots was brought to nothing by the bride's early death, but late in 1512 arrangements were successfully made for Henry Clifford to marry Margaret Percy, daughter of the earl of Northumberland. The son's wild ways may also have been prompted by frustration at his father's longevity. By September 1522, however, when Lord Clifford was described as 'feebled with sickness' ('LP Henry VIII', 2.2, no. 2524), young Henry did not have long to wait for his inheritance. Lord Clifford died on 20 April 1523, and was buried in the following year at either Bolton or Shap. From his first marriage he left two sons and four daughters, from his second marriage a single daughter. His heir's elevation to be earl of Cumberland in 1525 owed much to Henry Clifford's labours to revive the fortunes of his family.

Clifford, Henry, first earl of Cumberland (c.1493-1542), magnate, was the elder son of Henry Clifford, tenth Baron Clifford (1454-1523), magnate, and his first wife, Anne (died 1508), daughter of Sir John St John of Bletsoe, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Alice. He had a brother, Sir Thomas Clifford (died 1543), a notable soldier, who acted on his behalf as constable of Carlisle between 1525 and 1529 and captain of Berwick, Northumberland, until 1538, four sisters, and a surviving half-sister. According to his great-granddaughter, Anne Clifford, countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery (1590-1676), he was 'bred up for the first part, in his childhood and youth, with the said king [Henry VIII]... Which engrafted such a love in the said Prince towards him that it continued even to the very end' (Dickens, 140). There is indeed evidence that he was educated at court. 
Clifford was made KB at the coronation of Henry VIII on 23 June 1509. He was not, however, one of the king's circle of chivalric companions or 'minions', nor does he ever seem to have sought a military reputation. As a young man he was criticized by his father for his ostentation, dressing 'more like a duke than a poor baron's son as he is', for assaults on Lord Clifford's servants, and for extorting leases of tithes from unwilling monastic houses (T. D. Whitaker, 'The History and Antiquities of the Deanery of Craven', 3rd edn, 1878, 327). He married Margaret (died in or before 1516), daughter of George Talbot, fourth earl of Shrewsbury, and his first wife, Anne. She died only a year or two after the marriage and there were no children. Clifford married for a second time about 1516. His wife was Margaret ('c'.1492-1540), first daughter of Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland, and his wife, Catherine. They had two sons, Henry Clifford, second earl of Cumberland (1517-1570), and Sir Ingram Clifford (1518?-1578/9), and four daughters. In 1517 Clifford was imprisoned for a time in the Fleet prison for unknown offences. He succeeded his father on 20 April 1523, when he was said to have been about thirty, and was created earl of Cumberland on 18 June 1525 as part of a reorganization of the government of the north. At the same time the king's bastard son, Henry Fitzroy, was created duke of Richmond and earl of Nottingham, and Thomas Manners, twelfth Baron Ros, earl of Rutland. Cumberland was then in October appointed deputy warden of the west marches against Scotland under Richmond over the claims of William Dacre, third Lord Dacre of Gilsland. This experiment was not seen to be a success. Despite the title adopted for their earldom, the Clifford heartlands were in the West Riding of Yorkshire, around Skipton, and in the Eden valley, Westmorland, where they had castles at Brougham and Appleby. Cumberland had little standing in Cumberland or on the west marches, and found himself compelled to compete for offices and authority against Dacre. In late 1527 he was allowed to surrender the wardenship and Dacre was appointed in his place before 26 June 1528. Cumberland however remained in charge of Carlisle until August 1529, impairing Dacre's effectiveness as warden and provoking Dacre-inspired riots in the city. 
Cumberland supported Henry's divorce from Katherine of Aragon and, with other nobles, signed a letter to Clement VII, asking him to grant it, on 13 July 1530. In 1534, in ways that are not clear, he was complicit in the fall of Dacre and in the charges of treasonable communication with the Scots brought against him by Sir William Musgrave. Dacre was acquitted at a trial by his peers in July but subsequently fined $10,000 and deprived of his offices by the king. Cumberland was appointed warden of the west marches for a second time in September and again his record was mixed. He could not secure the co-operation of the Dacres and once more was forced to compete for the monastic and crown stewardships that were held by them as adjuncts of the warden's office. Dacre also maintained that Cumberland had purloined his goods after his arrest: this grievance was still a sore point between the families as late as 1554. The tensions between the Clifford and Dacre factions were made plain when Richard Dacre attempted to stab Musgrave in the presence of Cumberland's son, Henry, Lord Clifford, in Carlisle on 9 December 1536. As a result Cumberland, Musgrave, and Dacre and their various supporters were severely admonished by Henry VIII in a letter of 24 January 1537. Cumberland's friends on the privy council urged him on 31 January to take the opportunity to surrender the wardenship, reminding him of his reluctance to accept the office in the first place. He wrote to the king offering to resign, but seems to have remained titular warden until the end of his life. The day-to-day responsibilities passed to Thomas Wharton. There is little evidence to suggest that Cumberland sought what was almost certainly an unattractive office on the borders. Rather he was used as an alternative at moments when the Dacres were politically out of favour. His own interests seem to have lain entirely in expanding his family's influence in the West Riding. It is striking that neither he nor his heir took the opportunity to acquire monastic lands in Westmorland, many of which (including Shap, where the tenth Lord Clifford may have been buried) were purchased by Wharton. 
Cumberland's loyalty to the king is seen most clearly during the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536-7. He was initially instructed to lead a force to Hexham, Northumberland, where the monks had barricaded themselves in the monastery in defiance of the commissioners sent to suppress it. He appears to have attempted to reach Hexham about 16-17 October 1536, but to have been beaten back to Skipton. He took refuge in his castle and faced a short siege from a party of the Richmondshire commons who deviated to Skipton on their way to Pontefract, West Riding, apparently with the aim of recruiting Cumberland to their cause. The force he had gathered (probably to lead to Hexham) melted away and he was left to defend Skipton with household servants alone. A party of Clifford women including Eleanor Clifford, 'nee' Brandon (1519-1547), Cumberland's daughter-in-law, were stranded at Bolton Priory and were led back through the rebels' lines by the earl's steward and cousin, Christopher Aske, brother of Robert Aske, the grand captain of the pilgrims. Cumberland was impotent to influence the course of the pilgrimage. While he made much of his defiance, the truth is that he was in fact trapped in his castle by an insurrection of his own tenants, who attacked his houses and killed his deer. A delegation was sent to him to try and persuade him to attend the York conference on 22 November but his refusal to lend any weight to the Pilgrimage of Grace was total. Henry, Lord Clifford managed the defence of Carlisle against the Cumberland commons. In the new year Cumberland appears to have tried to implement the king's instruction to seize the captains of the rebellious commons. His attempt to seize their leaders around Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland, prompted a renewal of the conflict in Westmorland and Cumberland. A second attempt to besiege Carlisle failed after the castle garrison under Cumberland's bastard, Thomas Clifford (died in or after 1555), issued from the town and, with the aid of a force led by Sir Christopher Dacre, routed the commons on 16 February 1537. Henry's gratitude made it impossible for Cumberland to be dismissed from the wardenship, hence the arrangement where Wharton took over the duties but was denied the title. Cumberland was elected to the Order of the Garter on 23 April 1537 to reward his loyal service. 
When Cumberland had livery of his lands on 18 July 1523, they had a gross annual rental of $1332. He had already acquired the manor of Carleton in Craven in 1514 but made no further acquisitions until he secured the Craven manors of Marton Priory by purchase from Charles Brandon, first duke of Suffolk, in 1541. In April 1542 he was granted by letters patent the Craven estates of Bolton Priory -- a house with which the Cliffords were traditionally associated as founders -- worth nearly $400 per annum, in reward for royal service. The augmented estates were valued at $1720 per annum in the earl's inquisition post mortem. As a landlord, Cumberland needs to be defended against the assertions that he was raising the cornage rents of his tenants in Westmorland and that he was rapacious in his treatment of tenants in Craven. He was, however, a notable encloser. Some of his Craven enclosures were destroyed in riots in May 1535, and his new fences in the Eden valley were thrown down in the unsettled conditions of the winter of 1536. Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, was particularly critical of Cumberland's estate policies: 'he must be brought to change his conditions, that is to say, not to be so greedy of getting money of his tenants and others under him' ('LP Henry VIII', 12/1, no. 919). His predatory manner may also be seen in his dealings with Furness Abbey over their manor of Winterburn in Craven. Cumberland clearly coveted this manor. He later claimed to have a lease from 1531, but it was known from 1536 onwards that this was a forgery, made after some of the monks, during the vacancy of 1531, broke into a chest and applied the convent seal to some blank parchments. While the facts were well established, Cumberland insisted on the validity of this lease and persistently ejected the manor's tenants. 
Cumberland died on 22 April 1542 and was buried on 2 May at Skipton, where his tomb may still be seen in the parish church. His will, dated 2 April 1542 and proved on 4 June 1543, suggests orthodox religious tastes: he left money to pay for the singing of a requiem and dirge by every curate in Westmorland and Craven willing to do so, and for an obit to be established in Skipton parish church. His wife predeceased him, dying on 25 November 1540 at Skipton.

Clifford, Henry, second earl of Cumberland (1517-1570), magnate, was the eldest of the six children of Henry Clifford, first earl of Cumberland (c.1493-1542), and his second wife, Margaret ('c'.1492-1540), daughter of Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland. He was educated at home and then at court, where he spent much of his youth. He also attended the duke of Richmond in the latter's household at Pontefract Castle, and was made knight of the Bath at Queen Anne's coronation in 1533. In June 1535 he married Henry VIII's niece Eleanor (1519-1547), daughter of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, and Mary, daughter of Henry VII and widow of Louis XII of France. His father built for them the octagonal tower and long gallery extension at Skipton Castle. Clifford escorted Lady Mary Tudor at the funeral of Queen Jane at Windsor on 12 January 1537, and represented his father when Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves in January 1540. That year he served in the king's chamber, as a carver. 
Clifford was prominent in the military crises of Henry VIII's later years. In 1536 he rallied the Carlisle townsmen to stand firm against the rebels. He played some part in the defence of the west march in 1541, and from September 1542 until 1544, following his father's death, he was continually employed mustering his Yorkshire tenants and leading them on the borders. He was proposed as warden-general for all the marches, but the king preferred a more experienced man, in John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. Instead, Clifford was appointed to the council of the borders, and was rewarded in 1544 by being added to the council in the north. He repeated this service during Elizabeth I's Scottish campaign of 1559-60. It was his military outlay, rather than court life, which forced him to sell lands during the 1540s. Even so, the rental from his estates at his death amounted to some $2000 per annum. 
Clifford was tall, slender, and dark-haired, a learned man with a fine library whose interests were alchemy, astrology, and distilling. These he indulged after Countess Eleanor's death in 1547, a blow which so prostrated the earl that he was laid out for dead, according to family tradition recovering his strength by sucking milk from a woman's breasts; thereafter he retired to his northern castles, rarely visiting the court. He was instrumental with William Ermysted in founding Skipton grammar school. A testimony to his cultural concerns and pride in his royal marriage is the organ he presented to Carlisle Cathedral in 1542. The organ case, of Italian design, displays on its heraldic panels the coats and supporters of the Cliffords and Brandons. The oldest in England, it is now in St Lawrence's, Appleby. 
Clifford's absence from court exposed him to political intrigue. His parliamentary patronage in Westmorland and friends in the privy council enabled him to obstruct Thomas, Lord Wharton's bills in 1549 and 1558 to deprive him of his hereditary sheriffwick of Westmorland and punish his servants. He was potentially dangerously exposed in 1553 when his only child, Margaret, heiress to the great Clifford inheritance and with a claim to the throne, was drawn by John Dudley, now duke of Northumberland, into his schemes to achieve his own dynastic ambitions and perpetuate the protestant regime. But Northumberland's proposal, that Margaret should marry his own son Lord Guildford Dudley, came to nothing, and on Mary Tudor's accession Clifford was swift to extricate himself by demonstrating his loyalty to her. His inheritance worries only ceased well after his second marriage in 1554 to Anne ('c'.1538-1581), daughter of William, third Baron Dacre of Gilsland, with the birth in 1558 of George Clifford, the future third earl (1558-1605). (His second son was Francis Clifford (1559-1641), eventually the fourth earl.) This marriage also served to heal a long-running dispute between the Dacres and the Cliffords. 
Clifford's initial support for Queen Mary was unequivocal. A traditionalist in matters of religion, he welcomed her restoration of Catholicism and used his electoral patronage in Westmorland to return members of like mind, but he became disenchanted with her later policies. Under Elizabeth he was accused of protecting popish priests in the north. However, the agreement he reached in 1565 for George's marriage with Margaret, daughter of Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, signalled his alignment with the strongly protestant group at court under Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. At the time of the 1569 uprising he was suspected of sympathy, at the very least, with the rebels, but again demonstrated his loyalty to the Tudor crown by holding Brougham Castle for the queen. He died there on 8 January 1570 and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Skipton.

Clifford, Henry, fifth earl of Cumberland (1592-1643), local politician and royalist army officer, was born on 28 February 1592 at Londesborough in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the second, surviving son of Francis Clifford, fourth earl of Cumberland (1559-1641), and Grissell ('bap'. 1559, died 1613), elder daughter of Thomas Hughes of Uxbridge, Middlesex, and widow of Edward Neville, Lord Bergavenny. He was educated at first privately and then, until about 1606, at Dean John Higgins's school at Well, near Ripon. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in January 1606, and graduated BA in 1609; and in 1610 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, London. He was created knight of the Bath on 3 June 1610. After his marriage on 25 July 1610 at Kensington to Lady Frances Cecil (1594-1644), daughter of Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, he spent a year at M. de Pluvinel's academy in Paris. 
Clifford was a tall, dark-haired, scholarly man, a lutenist and poet, skilled in mathematics and architecture, and accomplished in field sports. Although, because of his family's financial problems, he could not, in Clarendon's words, 'live with the lustre of his ancestors' (Clarendon, 'Hist. rebellion', 2.286), his conviviality towards the Yorkshire gentry gave him the social leadership of the county. He was a patron of musicians and players, planning the songs and masque when Earl Francis entertained James I at Brougham Castle in August 1617, and staging the first full-text presentation of Milton's 'Comus' at Shrovetide 1637 in Skipton Castle where, in 1628, he had converted the outer gatehouse into a showpiece neo-Platonic grotto. He is credited with designing the monument to Countess Grissell, commissioned in 1631 from Nicholas Stone, in All Saints', Londesborough. From 1631 to 1638 he maintained in his household the Dutch painter Hendrick de Keyser the younger. His poems survived in manuscript among his family papers but are lost except for his 'Poetical Translations of some Psalms and the Song of Solomon', now in the Bodleian Library. 
At court Clifford jousted, carried banners at royal funerals, and escorted foreign dignitaries into the king's presence. With his son-in-law Richard Boyle, Lord Dungarvan, he met the Dutch lords at Thames wharf on 1 January 1641 to negotiate a marriage between William of Nassau and Princess Mary. In 1614 and 1621 he was elected MP for Westmorland and on 17 February 1628 he was summoned to the Lords as Baron Clifford. Having taken over from his ageing father from 1621, he dispensed his family's political patronage in Westmorland and the boroughs of Appleby and Carlisle. By 1619, when he was appointed to the council in the north, he had become the active lord lieutenant first of Cumberland and then Westmorland and Northumberland (offices jointly held with Earl Francis and the Howards, earls of Suffolk), and governor (with Earl Francis) of Carlisle Castle; and from 1641 he was hereditary sheriff of Westmorland. His responsibilities embroiled him in factional rivalry with Lord William Howard of Naworth. 
Clifford was prominent in the bishops' wars. Having been appointed governor of Newcastle on 20 February 1639, he completed Sir Jacob Astley's work in preparing its defences and recruited a well-equipped cavalry troop. Given command in Cumberland and Westmorland on 26 March by the lieutenant-general, the earl of Essex, he speedily raised the trained bands to garrison Carlisle, where a Scottish incursion was feared imminent. He saw to their replacement by Sir Francis Willoughby's veteran Irish levies and the safe delivery of ordnance and ammunition sent by sea from Cornwall. Later he raised the trained bands again to secure the frontier defences. However, acting as a conduit between Lord Deputy Wentworth and the court at Berwick and working to prevent the dismembering of Willoughby's force undermined Clifford's position. The lord general, the earl of Arundel, replaced him with his son Sir William Howard, but Clifford refused before Charles I to yield Carlisle Castle to him. 
Clifford's disgruntlement did not diminish his commitment during the Second Bishops' War (1640). But it may have given the king's opponents expectations of gaining his support in 1642: on 9 February they nominated the earl of Cumberland (as he had become on his father's death the year before) lord lieutenant of Westmorland. These expectations were unrealistic because Cumberland was a committed royalist who abhorred alike 'all manner of poperye and sismatticall opinions' (Clay, 389). However, he showed some ambiguity after Charles I, responding to the majority gentry views, appointed him commander in Yorkshire in July. During August Clifford acted with urgency, seizing the key castles of Pontefract, Sandal, and Knaresborough and appointing Colonel Sir Philip Musgrave commander in Westmorland. At his own expense he readied Skipton Castle for war and began to recruit in Craven a company of foot and a cavalry troop. Yet he strove to keep Yorkshire at peace, negotiating a truce, the treaty of Rothwell, on 29 September, with his near neighbour Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, and other roundhead leaders in the county, only to see it broken by Sir John Hotham in Hull, and by intransigent parliamentarians in Whitehall. 
As Sir Philip Warwick commented, Cumberland's 'genius was not military' (Warwick, 257). He had little military experience and relied on his subordinates such as Sir Thomas Glemham who, lacking adequate forces, suffered reverses which put the whole county at risk. Negotiations with the earl of Newcastle to come to their aid were done with Clifford's cognizance, although he yielded his command in December with reluctance. He retired to Skipton Castle, appointing as governor there in January 1643 Colonel Sir William Mallory, one of his officers in the First Bishops' War. He continued to finance recruitment and also took some part in administration. Following the royalists' defeats in Lancashire in May, he moved to Sir William Robinson's house, Minster Yard, York, where he died of a fever on 11 December, aged fifty-one. His cortege had a military escort to Skipton, with a parade and cannon salute before his interment on 31 December in Holy Trinity Church, Skipton. His countess died at York on 4 February 1644 and was buried in the minster. 
By Cumberland's death the Cliffords' earldom of Cumberland became extinct. The barony of Clifford (1299) fell to Lady Anne Clifford but that of 1628 passed to Clifford's sole surviving child, Elizabeth, Lady Dungarvan, countess of Cork (and later countess of Burlington). His estates were divided between them in accordance with the terms of the king's award of 1617 which settled the family's great inheritance dispute. An original portrait of him by Mytens is in the Devonshire collections. His daughter commemorated him prominently in 1644 by placing his shield on Clifford's Tower, York, beneath the coat of arms of Charles I.

Clifford, Henry (1768-1813), Roman Catholic layman and lawyer, was born on 2 March 1768, the second of the eight sons of Thomas Clifford (1732-1787) of Tixall, Staffordshire (brother of Hugh, fourth Baron Clifford), and his wife, Barbara (died 1786), youngest daughter and coheir of James, fifth Baron Aston. His mother was the niece of Thomas and Edward, eighth and ninth dukes of Norfolk respectively, and of George, fourteenth earl of Shrewsbury. His elder brother was Sir Thomas Hugh Clifford, topographer and botanist. He was educated at the English Jesuit Academy at Liege, and admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 23 January 1788. He was called to the bar in February 1793, soon after the passage of the 'Catholic Relief Act' of 1791. 
Clifford was a prominent activist on behalf of the Catholic Committee and claimed personally to have collected the signatures of 1300 'loyal Catholics' to the committee's protestation (1789) which denounced the theory that the pope could dispense from civil oaths and explicitly denied papal infallibility. In his 'Reflections on the Appointment of a Catholic Bishop to the London District' (1791) he criticized the appointment of John Douglass as vicar apostolic, urging the rival claims of Joseph Berington, a candidate more acceptable to the liberal aristocracy and gentry. When the Catholic Committee was reconstituted as the Cisalpine Club he chaired its first meeting in April 1792, and was its secretary and treasurer for three years. 
Clifford deployed his eloquence and legal learning in the cause of civil liberties, achieving popular fame as the champion of the 'O.P.' (Old Price) demonstrators in the autumn of 1809. When the rebuilt Covent Garden Theatre opened to the public in September 1809, the increase in the price of tickets and the extension of private boxes provoked rowdy protests. Clifford joined the demonstrators and took a successful action against the theatre manager, whom he sued for wrongful arrest. His victory in the courts in December forced the proprietor, John Kemble, to yield to the demands of the pit, and Clifford was hailed as 'another Hampden in the cause of disenthralment' ('The Covent Garden Journal', 1.92). 
In January 1813 Clifford married Anne Teresa, youngest daughter of Edward Ferrers, of Baddesley Clinton, Warwickshire. He died three months later at Bath on 22 April 1813.

Clifford, Sir Henry Hugh (1826-1883), army officer, third son of Hugh Charles Clifford, seventh Baron Clifford of Chudleigh (1790-1858), and Mary Lucy (1799-1831), only daughter of Thomas Weld of Lulworth Castle, Dorset, was born on 12 September 1826 at Irnham Hall, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Prior Park, near Bath, Stonyhurst College, and the University of Fribourg, and commissioned as a second lieutenant in the rifle brigade on 7 August 1846. He served in South Africa, fighting in the Cape Frontier War (1846-7), and then against the Boers at the battle of Boomplaats (29 August 1848). On the outbreak of a war against the Basuto in 1852 he again went to Africa, where he was present at the battle of Berea Mountain (20 December 1852). He left in November 1853. He also served in the Crimean War, and was appointed aide-de-camp to Colonel Sir George Buller, brigade commander in the light division. He was present at Alma and Inkerman, and for his bravery at the latter was awarded the Victoria Cross. In May 1855 he was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general, and remained in the Crimea until the end of the war. He was then promoted brevet major, and awarded the legion d'honneur and the Mejidiye (fifth class). He married on 21 March 1857 Josephine Elizabeth (died 1913), only child of Joseph Anstice of Madeley Wood, Shropshire, professor at King's College, London; they had six daughters and three sons. 
Clifford was sent to China on the outbreak of hostilities, and as assistant quartermaster-general was present at the operations between December 1857 and January 1858 which resulted in the capture of Canton (Guangzhou). For his services he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel. On his return to England he began a long term of service on the staff; he was assistant quartermaster-general at Aldershot (1860-64) and at headquarters (1865-8), aide-de-camp to the duke of Cambridge (1870-73), and assistant adjutant-general at headquarters (1873-5). In April 1879 Clifford was sent by Cambridge to South Africa to reorganize army transport and repair relations between the military and civil authorities. He was successful in this task, although his own relationship with the field commander, Lord Chelmsford, was frosty. His labours were fully acknowledged by Sir Garnet Wolseley. He was gazetted a CB on 2 June 1869 and a KCMB on 19 December 1879, and was major-general of the eastern district of England from April to September 1882. Sir Henry died of cancer at his home, Ugbrooke Park, near Chudleigh, Devon, on 12 April 1883, and was buried at the chapel there.

Clifford, Hugh Charles, seventh Baron Clifford of Chudleigh (1790-1858), aristocrat, eldest son of Charles, sixth Baron Clifford (1759-1831), and Eleanor Mary (died 1835), daughter of Henry Arundel, eighth Baron Arundell of Wardour, was born at New Park, Somerset, on 22 May 1790, the eldest boy in a family of twelve. The family were Roman Catholics and he was educated at Stonyhurst, and in 1814 attended Cardinal Consalvi to the Congress of Vienna. He served as a volunteer through a large portion of the Peninsular campaigns. He succeeded his father in 1831 and took his seat in the House of Lords, the first of his family to do so since 1678. He supported the whigs, but seldom took part in the debates except on questions connected with Roman Catholicism. In his later years he lived chiefly in Italy, near Tivoli. On 1 September 1818 he married Mary Lucy (1799-1831), only child of Thomas (afterwards Cardinal) Weld of Lulworth Castle, Dorset; they had two daughters and four sons. The eldest son, Charles Hugh Clifford, became eighth baron; the third was Sir Henry Hugh Clifford. The other sons took orders in the Roman Catholic church, and one daughter became a nun of the Sacre Coeur. Clifford was the author of a number of political pamphlets on Ireland, India, and the corn laws. He died at Rome on 28 February 1858 of the effects of a wound in the ankle, and was buried beside his father-in-law, Cardinal Weld, in Rome, on 2 March 1858.

Clifford, James (bap. 1622, d. 1698), Church of England clergyman and musician, son of Edward Clifford, a cook, was born at Oxford, in the parish of St Mary Magdalen, where he was baptized on 2 May 1622. He had three brothers and two sisters. He was a chorister at Magdalen College from 1632 to 1642 and was educated in the choir school, but he took no degree at Oxford. On 1 July 1661 Clifford was appointed tenth minor canon of St Paul's Cathedral, London, where he later became sixth minor canon (1675), senior cardinal (1682), and sacrist (1682). He was for some years curate of St Gregory by St Paul's, a post he seems to have resigned before September 1695, in which month he was succeeded by Charles Green. He was also chaplain to the Society of Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street. 
In 1663 Clifford published the first edition of the work for which he is best known, 'The divine services and anthems usually sung in the cathedrals and collegiate choires in the Church of England'. This is a collection of the words of 172 anthems by composers ranging from William Byrd and Thomas Tallis of the Elizabethan period to Henry Lawes and William Child, both of whom were active church musicians until the prohibition of choral services during the civil war. In 1664 Clifford published a second edition with many additions, which took the total to 406 anthems and included brand new works by Matthew Locke, Pelham Humfrey, and John Blow. 'The Divine Services' also contains 'Brief directions for the understanding of that part of the divine service performed with the organ in S. Pauls Cathedral', a 'Scale or basis of musick' by Ralph Winterton, regius professor of medicine at Cambridge, and a 'Psalm of Thanksgiving', sung by the children of Christ's Hospital, set to music by Thomas Brewer. The book is a valuable record of Restoration choral regeneration. 
In 1694 Clifford published 'A catechism containing the principles of Christian religion... with a preparation sermon before the receiving of the holy sacrament of the Lord's supper'. He was twice married. His first wife's name is unknown, but on 30 May 1667 he obtained a licence for his marriage at St Dunstan-in-the-West, or the chapel of Serjeants' Inn, with Clare Fisher of the parish of St Gregory by St Paul's. His son was baptized at St Gregory's on 2 May 1679 and buried there in 1684. Clifford died in September 1698. His will (dated 16 June 1687) was proved on 26 September by his widow, who after her husband's death lived with her daughter in Wardrobe Court, Great Carter Lane, where the two women kept a school for small children. By his will Clifford left all his music to be divided among the minor canons of St Paul's.

Clifford, John, ninth Baron Clifford (1435-1461), soldier and magnate, sometimes known as 'the Butcher', was born at Conisbrough Castle in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 8 April 1435, the eldest son of Thomas Clifford, eighth Baron Clifford (1414-1455), and his wife, Joan Dacre ('b'. before 1424, died before 1455). Conisbrough was the dower house of his great-aunt Maud, countess of Cambridge, who was one of John's godparents, and later left him twelve silver dishes in her will. Nothing else is known of his childhood and youth, and it is in keeping with the rest of his short adult life that he should be next recorded on 24 August 1453, supporting the Percys, allies of the Cliffords since the 1390s, in their confrontation with the Nevilles, equally long-term adversaries in north-west England of the Cliffords, on Heworth Moor near York. In the following year he became a father. His wife was Margaret (died 1493), daughter and heir of Henry Bromflete, Lord Vescy, and their marriage appears to have formed part of Thomas Clifford's programme of expanding his interests in parts of the north relatively free from Neville domination. Husband and wife would later join the York Corpus Christi Guild. 
On 22 May 1455 Thomas Clifford was killed in battle with the duke of York and the Nevilles at St Albans. John Clifford was still a few months under age, and not until 5 July 1456 did he enter into his inheritance. To an already prolonged contest with the Nevilles for pre-eminence in the north-west he brought additional bitterness arising from a desire for vengeance. For a while the conflict was precariously contained by Yorkist control of government, and by the efforts of king and council to make peace. On 24 March 1458 it was arranged in King Henry's name that Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, should pay 1000 marks ($666 13's'. 4died) to John Clifford and his brothers and sisters, in compensation for their father's death. But the fact that Clifford, ominously described as one of 'the yong lordes whoos fadres were sleyne at Seynt Albonys' ('English Chronicle', 77), had earlier arrived in London alongside the sons of the earl of Northumberland, also killed at St Albans, at the head of a force of 1500 men, forcibly underlines the difficulties facing any would-be peacemaker. The king's settlement, and the ceremonious 'loveday' that followed it, had little effect. Queen Margaret became ever more dominant in government, and Clifford's energy made him an increasingly important supporter of the Lancastrian cause -- a propaganda poem of 1458 names him as one of the components of the 'well good sayle' of the ship of state (Robbins, 192-3). 
Clifford became increasingly active away from the court. A JP in Westmorland since 1456, in July 1458 he was also appointed to the bench for the West Riding of Yorkshire. Summoned to the Coventry parliament of November 1459, he took the oath of allegiance to the king, queen, and Prince Edward on 11 December. Eight days later he was granted the honour and castle of Penrith, forfeited by the earl of Salisbury; the Nevilles' control of Penrith had been particularly obnoxious to the Cliffords, thanks to its proximity to their own lordship in north Westmorland and their castle at Brougham. On 8 April 1460 Clifford was appointed warden of the west march, another office recently monopolized by the Nevilles. The fact that he was ordered to raise men in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Northumberland to resist the duke of York and other rebels indicates how he was expected to use the resources of his wardenry. On 8 October 1460, following the Yorkist victory at Northampton, Clifford was ordered to surrender Penrith to Salisbury. Two days later the duke of York claimed the throne, precipitating an all-out dynastic conflict. 
Clifford had been summoned to the parliament that was to debate York's claims, but does not appear to have attended it. He had probably remained in the north, where he was one of the lords who assembled at Hull to meet with Queen Margaret, and subsequently gathered in council at York, before setting out to destroy the tenants of the duke of York and earl of Salisbury. Clifford was himself later said to have engaged in pillage, and also to have recruited men by 'moost drad proclamations' ('RotP', 6.20). On 31 December 1460 the Lancastrians overwhelmed York and his men at Wakefield. Clifford was knighted by the duke of Somerset immediately before the battle, which subsequently brought him considerable notoriety, much of it first reported only several decades after the event. It is John Leland, writing in the years around 1540, who reports that Clifford 'for killing of men at this bataill was caullid the boucher' ('Itinerary', 1.41). To Leland's general attribution of slaughter and mayhem has been added a more specific charge, the slaying of the young Edmund, earl of Rutland, York's second son. This is first ascribed to Clifford in the 'Annales' of William Worcester, a contemporary source. But whereas Worcester records baldly that Clifford killed Rutland on Wakefield Bridge as he fled from the battle, Edward Hall, in his 'Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre & Yorke', completed about 1532 and published in 1548, provides an altogether more circumstantial account of the deed (later heavily drawn upon by Shakespeare). Here Rutland, his age reduced from seventeen to twelve, and accompanied by a tutor, pleads voicelessly for mercy, 'for his speache was gone for feare', but is pitilessly struck down by Clifford, with the words 'By God's blode, thy father slew myne, and so wil I do the and all thy kyn' (Hall, 250-51). This may indeed have been how Clifford felt towards York and his family, but whether he actually voiced his feelings thus may be doubted. 
Following their victory at Wakefield, the Lancastrians moved south, Clifford among them. He fought at the second battle of St Albans, on 17 February 1461, and it was reportedly in his tent that Henry VI was afterwards reunited with Queen Margaret and Prince Edward. But the Lancastrians lost the initiative by failing to capture London, and retreated north, with the Yorkists in slow pursuit. On 28 March there was a sharp contest for the passage of the Aire at Ferrybridge. A force led by Clifford captured the bridge, but was itself attacked in the flank by Yorkists who had crossed the river upstream, and Clifford was killed -- according to tradition he fell at Dittingdale, near Castlebridge, struck in the throat by a headless arrow. His body seems to have been cast into a common burial pit. Following the shattering defeat of the Lancastrians at Towton on the following day, Clifford was attainted and his lands forfeited; his Westmorland estates were later granted to the earl of Warwick. The tribulations undergone by his young heir, Henry Clifford, the so-called Shepherd Lord, appear to be mythical, but the ruin of the family was for the time being complete. John Clifford left two sons and two daughters. His widow, who lived until 1493, married Sir Lawrence Threlkeld, a Westmorland landowner, with whom she had one son and two daughters.

Clifford, Margaret, countess of Cumberland (1560-1616), noblewoman, was born at Bedford House, Exeter, on 7 July 1560, the youngest child of Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford (1526/7-1585), and Margaret (died 1562), daughter of Sir John St John of Bletsoe. Following her mother's death in August 1562 she lived for seven years with her aunt Mrs Elmes of Lillford, Northamptonshire, and afterwards at Woburn, receiving an extensive education, judging by the wide-ranging scholarly interests she later displayed. 
On 24 June 1577 at St Saviour's, Southwark, Lady Margaret married George Clifford, third earl of Cumberland (1558-1605), her father's ward. Although her affection towards him remained undiminished, his courtier profligacy and infidelity led to their separation in 1600. The early death of both their sons caused the countess anguish and thereafter she devoted herself to the welfare of her surviving child, Lady Anne Clifford (1590-1676). Lady Anne describes her mother as having a 'very well favoured face with sweet and quick gray eyes and a comely personage' (Williamson, 'Lady Anne Clifford', 36-8). Intelligent with many practical as well as intellectual interests, Countess Margaret was an exceedingly pious lady, a zealous puritan who helped foster the spread of her beliefs from the earl's Skipton Castle in the West Riding of Yorkshire. When building Beamsley Hospital, the almshouse she founded for widows near Skipton in 1593, she stressed the centrality of religious devotion by choosing the style of the round Romanesque churches. 
Countess Margaret was extremely well-read, patronized the translation of foreign authors, and attracted dedications, especially from puritan writers. Her marital plight inspired verse letters from Samuel Daniel and perhaps Fulke Greville, and her piety was praised in Emilia Lanier's religious poems. Part of her revealing biographical letter survives. She also had a scientific and entrepreneurial bent. She practised alchemy, distilled medicines, and invested in lead-mining in Craven and in experiments to smelt iron with coal. Emulating her husband, she invested in the East India Company. She erected a monument in Hornsey church, Middlesex, to Richard Cavendish, her lead-mining associate who died in 1601. 
'Her Spirit', Lady Anne rightly said of Countess Margaret, 'never yielded to ill fortune or opposition' (Williamson, 'Lady Anne Clifford', 38). When Earl George excluded Anne from his inheritance in favour of his brother Francis Clifford, fourth earl, the countess amassed documentary evidence with the aid of the antiquary St Loe Kniveton which in 1607 undermined Earl Francis's pleas in the court of wards. This archive formed the core of the three great books of record of the Clifford family that Lady Anne later compiled. Furthermore, she vigorously overcame by litigation the opposition of her Westmorland jointure tenants. According to Lady Anne, she was worldly-wise, Sir William Wentworth correctly judging her 'much experienced and verie pollitique' (Cooper, 30). Countess Margaret died aged fifty-five, on 24 May 1616, at Brougham Castle, Westmorland. She was buried on 7 July in Appleby church, where her daughter erected a fine monument to her with a lifelike effigy, attributed to Maximilian Colt.

Clifford, Martin (c.1624-1677), headmaster and author, eldest son of Henry Clifford, gentleman, and his wife, Cecily ('bap'. 1600), daughter of Bishop Martin Fotherby of Salisbury and his wife, Margaret Winter, was presumably born in London. His parents were married in All Hallows Church in Lombard Street, London, on 17 December 1623 and his younger brother, Francis, died as a baby in 1625. By the time his sister, Mabel, died in 1639 at the age of ten, his father was already dead. 
Clifford attended Westminster School as a king's scholar and liberty boy. In 1640 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a contemporary of the duke of Buckingham and of Abraham Cowley, with whom he would conduct a lifelong friendly and learned correspondence. Like most eldest sons of the gentry, he did not graduate, but he had acquired 'good learning, and might have been eminent had not the wars hindred his progress' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 3.999). What became of him during the civil war is not known. According to Warren's contemporary life, he was 'always loyal to his King' (Warren, 144) and it seems that he followed the court into exile. A letter from Abraham Cowley to the duke of Ormond on 26 December 1659 suggests that at that time Clifford was in Brussels. 
After the Restoration, Clifford became Buckingham's secretary and lived at the Savoy. As an unrepentant drinker and talented and biting poet, Clifford was much sought after among the court wits. In May 1669 he mocked in verses Edward Howard's prolix and bombastic heroic poem 'The Brittish princes', while in four defamatory letters, probably written between January 1671 and July 1672 (Winn, 579), he charged John Dryden with plagiarism. The latter circulated by transcripts until their posthumous publication as 'Notes upon Mr. Dryden's Poems in Four Letters' (1687). It was said that he had a hand, along with Cowley, Thomas Sprat, and Edmund Waller, in producing the famous 'Rehearsal' by Buckingham, and according to Evelyn he was involved with Buckingham, Sprat, Waller, and Evelyn himself in promoting a society aimed primarily at the improvement and the polishing of the English tongue (J. Evelyn, 'Diary and Correspondence', ed. W. Bray, 1906, 3.455-6). 
In 1671 Clifford was elected master of the Charterhouse, probably through the influence of Buckingham. His meagre salary was raised by the mediation of the earl of Shaftesbury. During the years of his mastership he loved conversing on poetry, religion, and human nature with Dame Sarah Cowper (1640-1719), who wrote that 'Because he treated Fools according to their Folly, it gott him the Charecter of ill Nature; but I never knew him other than Compassionate, Charitable, generous and Just'. In spite of her assertion that he was, 'no Contemner of Religion, or such as maintain the principles of it, but wou'd express great Veneration for Bp Wilkins Dr Tillot: Dr Barrow and the like' (Herts. ALS, D/EP F30, fol. 131), and although his office demanded adherence to the established church, Clifford seems to have been a covert deist. 
In 1674 Clifford published anonymously in London 'A Treatise of Humane Reason', which stirred up a ten-year controversy by advancing the hypothesis of salvation even for an honest erring conscience. It was frequently reprinted. Not long after its publication Bishop Benjamin Laney of Ely dined with many 'persons of quality' in the Charterhouse, when he was asked about his opinion on that book. Undoubtedly unaware that he was in the presence of its author, the bishop answered that 'twas no matter if all the copies were burnt and the author with them, knowing by what he had read in the book that the author makes every man's private fancy judge of religion' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 3.999). 
On 10 December 1677 Clifford died at Sutton's Hospital in the Charterhouse, 'not much lamented by the Pensioners' (Warren, 144), and was buried on the 13th in the chancel of St Margaret's, Westminster. His funeral was attended by many lords including the duke of Buckingham. In 1682 the Unitarian author William Popple (1638-1708) published a French translation of Clifford's treatise introduced by a longer preface justifying the opinions in it, with the title 'Traite de la raison humaine traduit de l'anglois' (1682). This aroused great interest among the Huguenot refugees in Holland.

Clifford, Richard (d. 1421), bishop of London and administrator, had a brother, Robert (died 1423), who was an esquire of Tonbridge, Kent, and was a kinsman of Thomas Fishbourne, anchorite and first confessor to the new Bridgettine nunnery at Syon, Middlesex. This is the total of firm evidence about the bishop's family, despite repeated and extensive efforts to link him with the great northern baronial family and with Sir Lewis Clifford (died 1404), the Wycliffite, who was of an established Devon family. The future bishop, Sir Lewis, and Thomas, sixth Lord Clifford, were all in Richard II's household in the 1390s. Fishbourne and Robert Clifford both had some landholdings in the north. There is some inconclusive heraldic evidence. If Richard was indeed kin to the baronial family, there is no indication that this was significant in his career. A second Richard Clifford, who was archdeacon of Middlesex between 1418 and 1422, and received considerable patronage from the bishop, was almost certainly a close kinsman, but there is no evidence that he was the bishop's nephew. 
The elder Richard Clifford was a graduate: a master by 1397 and bachelor of civil and canon laws by March 1398, perhaps of Oxford, where he later proposed to found a college. On 23 July 1380 he appears as a king's clerk, when he was presented by the crown to the mastership of the free chapel of Jesmond, Northumberland, a county where his brother had lands. By 1394 he held or had held six rectories and sixteen other preferments, most of them by royal nomination. Clifford was at the heart of the household, being clerk of the chapel and close to the king. He performed no external commissions. In April 1387 the king wrote to the pope on behalf of his 'dear clerk' (Perroy, 50-51). Probably he remained with the king in the midlands throughout this year. He was with him at Woodstock on 11 October 1387 as Richard prepared to face the lords appellant, and was detained by them in the Tower of London on 8 February with a view to being tried in parliament. In the event, he was probably not charged, but he was released, by mainprise of three leading border knights, on condition of appearing in the next parliament, living in his own house, and having no contact with the king. 
Once the king recovered his authority, Clifford was recalled promptly to his side and became keeper of the great wardrobe on 28 November 1390. Alongside his many preferments, he obtained the farm of the alien priory of Burstall in Holderness on 12 January 1392, bringing his brother in as co-beneficiary a year later. On 29 August 1394 he became archdeacon of Ely. On 1 December 1395 he was elected, presumably with Richard II's support, to the see of Salisbury, but the pope had already translated Bishop Richard Medford of Chichester, who had at least as long and serious claims to the king's sympathy, and was accordingly successful. On 23 February 1397 Clifford exchanged his archdeaconry of Ely for the more prestigious one of Canterbury. On 28 March 1398 he was admitted as dean of York. Apart from these three dignities, Clifford held no fewer than six further preferments at some time between 1394 and 1401. Throughout his career Clifford shuffled his pack to increasing self-advantage. On 14 October 1399 Henry IV would ratify his tenure of the deanship, the archdeaconry, four prebends, and one mastership of a hospital. At least half the bishoprics in England were worth less than these. Accordingly, since Clifford wanted to be a bishop, it was reported that he was even intriguing to oust Ralph Erghum, the veteran servant of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, from the see of Bath and Wells in the late 1390s. In January 1398 Clifford took pains to obtain a prebend in Wells as a base. 
On 14 November 1397 Richard II appointed Clifford as keeper of the privy seal, as part of his extension of firm personal control over all arms of the government after his coup against his major enemies. This may well have saved Clifford's career. He was appointed an executor of the king's will on 16 April 1399, and an attorney for several of the leading figures accompanying the king's expedition to Ireland. He himself remained behind to help govern England in the king's absence, but he was not among the king's intimates at the heart of this caretaker regime. Accordingly, if still remarkably, he was not only able to survive the king's fall, but was reappointed without a break by Henry IV as keeper of the privy seal on 30 September. Furthermore, ostensibly by petition of the Commons in parliament, he was declared loyal on 10 November, notwithstanding his exclusion from the general pardon issued by Richard II's opponents back in 1388. He remained uncontentiously in office, and is found being summoned to the king at Leeds Castle, Kent, on 5 April 1400 to explain an existing treaty with the duke of Gueldres. 
So confidently had Clifford adapted to the new dynasty that he continued his campaign to gain Bath and Wells. Once Erghum had at last died, Clifford gained papal provision on 12 May 1400. However, the king was supporting Henry Bowet, once as formidable a Ricardian careerist as Clifford, but one who had transferred into John of Gaunt's service and shared Henry's own exile. Bowet had gained election by the chapters. Deadlock ensued. On 2 March 1401, the Commons in parliament urged Clifford's cause, as having failed to gain Salisbury in 1395 and as an excellent keeper of the privy seal. The king responded that both candidates were excellent, and he would work for both of them. This is so rare an entry by either house in parliament into an episcopal appointment that the possibility that it was stage-managed must be considered. The Cistercian monk Tideman Winchcombe, formerly Richard II's all-night drinking partner and physician and reputedly also a magician, died on 1 June, leaving the see of Worcester available. Quite likely this event had been as long expected as it was universally welcomed. The king sent the monks a licence to elect on 20 June, and Clifford became their choice seven days later. He received custody of the temporalities five days later (2 July), albeit forfeiting at the rate of $100 p.a. on 6 August to the royal household. The papal translation was issued briskly on 17 August. He received the bulls in London on 20 September, the temporalities the next day, and was consecrated in St Paul's on 29 October. Worcester was just about sufficient for Clifford in terms of income and status. Bowet, of course, took up Bath and Wells. 
Clifford resigned as keeper of the privy seal at once, on 3 November 1401, as was often customary at this time, but he seems to have remained active as a counsellor around the government. Apart from January-April 1403 (during which visit he was enthroned on 4 February), July-August 1403, September-December 1404, and March-September 1407, he was absent from his diocese. During his spell of residence in 1404 he appointed proctors to the parliament at Coventry, having a rash of white spots all over his body and being quite unable to ride. On 6 May 1402 he had left London as an escort of Princess Blanche to her marriage (6 July) with the son of Ruprecht, king of the Romans. He returned to London on 29 July. In March 1404 he was appointed a member of the council, but was not included in its next formal reconstitution on 22 May 1406. It is possible that he was, at least by now, identified with Archbishop Thomas Arundel in politics. 
On 22 June 1407 Clifford was translated to the see of London. He received the papal bulls on 13 October and the temporalities seven days later. He was engaged in extending the truce with Scotland in this year, but otherwise seems to have been little involved in government affairs. His only commission of any note was to hear an appeal from the court of admiralty on 22 August 1409. However, when Archbishop Arundel was restored to power in 1412, Clifford subsequently reappeared in attendance at meetings of the royal council. He also acted as an assessor at the trial of the heretic Sir John Oldcastle on 23 September 1413. 
Clifford's public career was now in its twilight, and the accession of Henry V confirmed this. None the less, he retained full health. On 9 April 1416 he was even appointed to reinforce the delegation of the province of Canterbury to the Council of Constance, with letters of protection on 9 July. On 20 July he was also named as a delegate of the crown, an interesting piece of evidence that Henry V believed that Clifford would respond loyally to his policy of bringing the English 'nation' to heel under collective episcopal leadership. Clifford arrived at Constance on 7 October 1416, and made such an impression that he was even considered as a possible choice for papacy. In the event, it was he who nominated Odo Colonna on 11 November 1417, and conducted his coronation as Martin V. 
The mayor and aldermen of London, with whom he enjoyed good relations, urged Clifford to come home as soon as he could. Their reasons are unknown, but some oblique light might be cast on their appeal by the fact that his diocesan administration was in unusual disarray, with no fewer than five vicars-general in succession during his absence. As for himself, he gained licence on 19 April 1418 from Martin V to be allowed to appoint coadjutors should he become too weak or old to administer his diocese. He probably travelled from Constance to join Henry V in France, although his whereabouts there are unknown. On 20 June 1418 he was granted letters of attorney by the king in France because he was 'going abroad' (that is, out of the Lancastrian realm). He is then to be found in Cologne in November 1418 and still in February 1419, presumably on royal business and once more dealing with the former Princess Blanche. 
Clifford was still absent from his diocese on 10 May 1419 but had returned by 9 June. His public life was over. Martin V wrote to him on 27 April 1421, to express both friendship and anxiety for news of his good health. Perhaps the pope was moved by knowledge that Clifford's health was far from good. However, the bishop did not change the uncomplicated will he had made on 20 August 1416 when setting out for Constance, which suggests that his final illness was sharp. His burial was to be in St Paul's Cathedral or whatever 'honest' place God pleased. Saints Peter, Paul, and Earconwald were invoked as special patrons. The bishop designated $100 for his funeral and a marble stone, $100 for paupers on his estates, $100 for paupers in hospitals and prisons, and 1000 marks for poor scholars at his proposed college in Oxford -- which was currently just Burnell's Inn -- with $40 to the master and fellows. His brother, Robert, was left plate and bedding, and was also named as principal executor, with instructions to reward the bishop's household and then distribute the rest of his possessions for the good of his soul. Clifford died on 20 August 1421 and was buried in the cathedral, on the site where the shrine of St Earconwald had formerly stood. There are many signs from throughout his career that his personal reputation stood far higher than official records alone indicate.

Clifford, Robert, first Lord Clifford (1274-1314), soldier and magnate, was born about the beginning of April 1274, the son of Roger de Clifford the younger (died 1282) and his wife, Isabella de Vieuxpont (died 1291), coheir with her sister Idonea to the lordship of Westmorland. The Cliffords had previously been a family powerful in the Anglo-Welsh marches. The Vieuxpont marriage led to their becoming one of the most important northern baronial dynasties. Aged only eight when his father was killed in Wales, Robert Clifford's wardship appears to have been granted to Edmund of Cornwall, the king's brother, but to have been effectively disposed of by Robert's mother, who entrusted the upbringing of her son to Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester (died 1295); only in 1291 did Edmund recover the custody. In 1294 Clifford was said to be in the king's wardship, and he was with Edward I in Wales in the spring of 1295. He had livery of his estates on 3 May 1295, but was still trying to recover usurpations suffered during his lengthy minority more than fifteen years later. The task was complicated by the demands of war and public office in Scotland and the north of England, almost as soon as Clifford entered upon his inheritance. In 1296 he accompanied the king to Scotland, and in July 1297 he was appointed captain of the king's castles in Cumberland. At the end of that year he led a destructive raid into Annandale which defeated the local levies and burnt ten villages. In the following February another raid left Annan in ashes. 
On 22 July 1298 Clifford fought at Falkirk as a household banneret, and after the victory, on 25 November, he was made captain and king's lieutenant in north-west England and in Scotland to the boundaries of Roxburghshire, an office he still held in the following July. Nor was this the only responsibility entrusted to him, for on 7 July 1298 he became keeper of Nottingham Castle and justice of the forests north of the Trent, positions he would occupy to the end of the reign. As a reward for his labours, on 26 September 1298 Edward I granted Clifford Caerlaverock Castle and the lands of Sir William Douglas, in the process initiating a feud between the Cliffords and the Douglases which would last for a century. A series of personal summonses to parliament which began on 29 December 1299 has led to his being styled Lord Clifford. In 1300 he accompanied the king on the Caerlaverock campaign. He engaged himself to serve in Scotland over the winter of 1301-2, and accompanied the king there in 1304, participating in a successful attack on the Scots near Peebles about 1 March. Later that year he joined the forces of the prince of Wales, and with them took part in the siege of Stirling Castle. But though he remained close to Prince Edward, who in August 1305 described him as 'our dear and well loved knight' ('Letters of Edward, Prince of Wales', 92), he also continued to serve the king, on whose behalf he was keeper of the see of Durham in 1302-3 and 1305-7, and by March 1306 he was back in Scotland, as keeper of Selkirk. Shortly afterwards he was one of the English captains ordered to attack the rebellious Robert Bruce, and in February 1307 is recorded as pursuing Robert in Galloway. He was unable, however, to prevent James Douglas from capturing Douglas Castle and massacring the garrison that Clifford had placed in it. 
Loyal and energetic service to Edward I did not hinder Clifford from safeguarding and extending his own interests in the north of England. In May 1306 he was granted Hart and Hartlepool in the bishopric of Durham, forfeited by Robert Bruce, and in February 1307 the king gave him lands in Cumberland forfeited by Sir Christopher Seton. But Westmorland remained fundamental to his regional standing and authority, and he enhanced his position there by adding to his estates (he acquired the manor of Brough Sowerby in 1298), by building up a loyal following among the gentry of the region, several of whom served repeatedly under his leadership in Scotland, and by the prestige to be had from large-scale architectural projects. In the years around 1300, possibly as a result of a visit in that year by Edward I and his court, Clifford made substantial additions to Brougham Castle, finally gaining the seal of royal approval in the form of a licence to crenellate in 1309. 
Trusted by Edward I and close to Prince Edward, Clifford was one of four leading barons whom the former on his deathbed is said to have begged to have the prince crowned as soon as possible, and to keep Piers Gaveston out of England -- 'and thai grantede him with god wille' ('Brut: England', 1.202-3). Early in the new reign Clifford was appointed marshal of England, and presumably organized Edward II's coronation on 25 February 1308. He had already subscribed to the declaration issued by a number of barons at Boulogne on 31 January, undertaking to preserve the rights of the crown, thereby suggesting his willingness to support the new king in the face of mounting baronial discontent. On 12 March 1308 he was relieved simultaneously of the marshalcy, Nottingham Castle, and his forest justiceship, but this can hardly be construed as resulting from loss of favour at court, for on 20 August he was appointed captain and chief guardian of Scotland. On 13 October, moreover, it was 'by the command of our lord the king' (books of record, 2.66-7) that he concluded negotiations with his maternal aunt Idonea and her second husband, John Cromwell, which resulted in his reuniting the lordship of Westmorland, divided since the mid-1260s. More probably Edward II had decided to build up Clifford's position in the north of England, at a time when the English position in Scotland was coming under growing pressure. It is likely to have been for the same reason that a sequence of three royal grants made between March and September 1310 gave him the castle and honour of Skipton in Craven in Yorkshire. He subsequently carried out important works on Skipton Castle. That his daughter Idonea should have married Henry Percy, second Lord Percy, with whose father Clifford many times campaigned against the Scots, is a pointer to the extent to which he came to identify himself with the nobility of northern England. 
Clifford served regularly in Scotland and on the Scottish borders in the early years of Edward II's reign. On 26 October 1309 he was appointed keeper of the Carlisle march, and on 20 December following was ordered to act as warden of Scotland, with a force of 100 men-at-arms and 300 foot soldiers. He had relinquished that office by 1 April 1310, but on 17 July received a protection as he was about to set out for Scotland, and was said to have parleyed with King Robert at Selkirk in December. On 4 April 1311 he was appointed keeper of Scotland south of the Forth, with his headquarters at Berwick, and in November led a raid upon the Scots in which eleven of his knights lost their horses. But he was increasingly distracted from his duties in the north by his involvement in English politics, particularly as these were directed against Piers Gaveston. Clifford may have been influenced in this by the grant to Gaveston of the honour of Penrith in December 1310, perhaps fearing that Gaveston might become his rival for pre-eminence in north-west England. But as Gaveston had formerly held the more valuable lordship of Skipton, subsequently granted to Clifford, the latter had arguably gained more from royal favour, and it is likely that Clifford was moved principally by the general baronial hostility towards the favourite, and by his own undertaking to the king's father. He was not one of the ordainers, and Edward II probably regarded him as basically well disposed; when Skipton was resumed under the ordinances on 21 October 1311, it was restored to Clifford on 13 November following. 
Nevertheless, Clifford was active against Gaveston in 1312, holding the borders to prevent his seeking Scottish aid, and later besieging him in Scarborough Castle. Though not involved in Gaveston's death, he appears to have taken some of the valuables that the king and Gaveston abandoned in Newcastle -- some jewels were later returned to Edward from Clifford's London house. Gaveston was executed on 19 July 1312, and for over a year Clifford was continually active as an intermediary on behalf of the earls of Lancaster and Warwick in their negotiations with the king, receiving a series of safe conducts and letters of protection. On 14 October 1313 the barons responsible for Gaveston's death received pardons, and two days later Clifford himself obtained a general pardon. Although the reconciliation between the king and his leading opponents was superficial, it allowed Edward II to turn his attention to Scotland. Summoned to attend a muster at Berwick on 10 June 1314, Clifford took part in the campaign that culminated in the battle of Bannockburn. On the day before the main engagement, he was one of two leaders of an English force that tried to get behind the Scottish force drawn up in front of Stirling Castle, either to cut off its retreat or to make contact with the castle garrison. But his men could not break the ranks of the enemy infantry, and were eventually scattered; Clifford's own withdrawal was regarded by one chronicler as shameful -- he had been 'disgracefully routed' ('Vita Edwardi secundi', 51). Perhaps anxiety to recover his honour made him over-impetuous, for on the following day, 24 June, he charged into action in the English vanguard and was killed. 
The Scottish king demanded no ransom for the return of Clifford's body, which was taken to Carlisle, and almost certainly interred at Shap Abbey, where Clifford had founded a chantry for his parents. By 1295 he had married Maud, daughter of Thomas de Clare of Thomond, the brother of the earl of Gloucester in whose household Clifford was brought up. The marriage brought the Cliffords Irish estates of greater potential than actual value. Robert and Maud Clifford had two sons, Roger (died 1322) and Robert (died 1344), both minors at their father's death. A daughter, Margaret (died 1382), married Peter (V) Mauley, third Lord Mauley ['see under 'Mauley family]. Roger Clifford became the ward of Sir Bartholomew Badlesmere, whose influence doubtless helped carry him into opposition to the crown. A committed Lancastrian, in 1322 Roger fought in the baronial army at Boroughbridge, where he was wounded and captured. He was hanged at York on 23 March. The Clifford estates, forfeited for Roger's treason, were restored in 1327 to his brother Robert, with whose descendants the Clifford line continued. Maud Clifford, forcibly abducted in 1315 by Jack the Irishman, the keeper of Barnard Castle, married Sir Robert Welle, one of her rescuers, and died in 1325. Her first husband seems to have been widely trusted and admired. His martial prowess was acknowledged by the Scots: for John Barbour he was 'The lord clyffurd that wes so stout' (Barbour, 1.277). And the 'Song of Caerlaverock' (admittedly a work that Clifford may have sponsored himself) praises his wisdom and prudence, describes his 'much honoured banner', and declares that 'If I were a young maiden I would give him my heart and person, so good is his fame' ('Roll of Caerlaverock', 12).

Clifford, Sir Roger de (b. c.1221, d. in or before 1286), baron and soldier, was the son of Roger de Clifford of Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire (died 1230/1231), younger son of Walter de Clifford, lord of Clifford, near Hay, Herefordshire, and of Sybil ('fl'. 'c'.1221-1253), daughter of Robert of Ewyas and widow of Robert de Tregoz and William of Newmarch. A minor at his father's death, Roger was in the custody of his uncle Walter, lord of Clifford, until he came of age, probably in 1242. He inherited lands in Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and Berkshire from his father, held predominantly from his cousin, another Walter de Clifford. In 1248 he was granted a weekly market and annual fair at Tenbury. He spent the early part of his career as a knight of Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester. In 1248 he went on pilgrimage with the earl, and in 1254 he travelled with him to join Henry III in Gascony. 
By the end of 1258 Clifford had joined the new political grouping which grew up around the Lord Edward, but in 1262 he was associated with Roger of Leybourne, who was accused of misappropriating funds from Edward. At this time Clifford, together with many of Edward's former intimates, abandoned the prince and joined the supporters of Simon de Montfort, and in May 1263, as a representative of the lords of the Welsh marches, wrote to the king urging him to uphold the provisions of Oxford. That August he and his fellows were forbidden to take part in tournaments, or to take up arms without royal licence, but despite this he was given command of the castles of Marlborough and Ludgershall. During 1263 Clifford campaigned in the Welsh marches with Roger of Leybourne and others, but by August they had been reconciled with the king and Edward. Clifford was pardoned for his activities, and in December was appointed sheriff of Gloucester, thereafter remaining loyal to Henry III. On 5 April 1264 he was present at the siege of Northampton, where he captured Simon de Montfort the younger. Himself taken at the battle of Lewes on 14 May, Clifford was released with the other marcher lords on condition that he would attend parliament when summoned, but he failed to do so. In October he besieged the castle at Hanley of Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester (son of his former lord). 
In January 1265 Clifford was among those offered safe conducts to withdraw to Ireland for a year, but remained in England where he took part in negotiations between the Lord Edward and the barons. He fought for the king at Evesham, and played a role in the subsequent pacification of England. In August he was appointed justice of the forest south of the Trent, an office he held for the next sixteen years, and keeper of the peace in Westmorland. At this time he also served as constable of Gloucester and in various minor offices, and was twice sent to the marches to hear complaints on the king's behalf. He received substantial rewards for the services he performed for Henry III and his son. In 1261 he was granted a pension of 50 marks a year, and three years later Edward granted him land worth 100 marks in the honour of Monmouth. After Henry III's victory at Evesham he was given lands of rebels in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and elsewhere, and was pardoned a debt of nearly $400. He also received the custody of Isabel, eldest daughter and coheir of the former rebel Robert de Vieuxpont, and married her to his own son Roger. 
In 1270 Clifford joined the Lord Edward's crusade, and was one of the executors of the will made by him at Acre in 1272. After he took the cross he was promised the next available wardship worth more than $500 p.a., because he had 'borne himself laudably in the king's service' ('CPR', '1266-72', 448). While returning from the crusade through France he married a lady mysteriously designated the countess of Lerett, or Lauretania, whose identity remains obstinately impenetrable. It would seem that all that can be said of her is that she outlived her husband and was buried in Worcester Cathedral after her death in 1301. His first wife had probably been Hawisia, widow of John de Boterel, whose marriage was granted to Clifford's father for his son's use in 1230. In 1274 he negotiated a truce with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and in 1275 he acted as Edward I's proctor at the 'parlement' of the king of France. In the following year he temporarily lost the custody of Eardisley Castle, when his bailiffs there threw the king's writ in the face of a royal messenger and threatened to kill him unless he left immediately. Between 1277 and 1280 he served as a justice on eyre for the forest, and in 1279 he was appointed justice of Wales. In 1282 Clifford was dragged from his bed and taken prisoner after a surprise attack on his castle of Hawarden by the Welsh prince Dafydd ap Gruffudd. His son, Roger the younger, was killed in the same year during an assault on Anglesey. 
Clifford was still alive in 1284, when he granted $10 to Westwood Priory, Worcestershire, and settled the manor of Severn Stoke on his younger grandson, another Roger. It may have been at this time that he founded a chantry in the parish church at Tenbury. He seems to have suffered some financial difficulty in his later years, for in the late 1270s he sold property in London to the city for 300 marks, and in December 1283 he and his heirs were pardoned half his outstanding debts to the king. He was dead by 3 April 1286 when his goods were impounded on account of debts owed to the crown, although the private property of his widow was exempted from this order. He was succeeded by his grandson, Robert Clifford (1274-1314), who inherited substantial property in Westmorland from his mother, Isabella de Vieuxpont (died 1291), and was the first member of his family to receive a personal summons to parliament.

Clifford, Roger, fifth Baron Clifford (1333-1389), magnate, was born at Brougham Castle in Westmorland on 20 July 1333, the second son of Robert Clifford, third Lord Clifford of Westmorland (1305-1344), and Isabel, daughter of Maurice, Lord Berkeley. His elder brother, Robert Clifford, died early in 1346, married but without an heir of his body, leaving the twelve-year-old Roger heir to the Clifford lands and title; on 17 March Roger's wardship was entrusted to Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, whose daughter Maud (died 1403) he was subsequently to marry. It was doubtless under Warwick's guidance that Clifford, still in his teens, fought in the sea battle of 1350 known as 'les Espagnols sur Mer'; in 1355 he accompanied Warwick to France in the first division of the army led by Edward, the Black Prince. By then he had attained his majority; he was granted livery of most of his lands on 14 May 1354, though not then quite of full age, and proved his age on 10 August following. 
Clifford was to have trouble recovering his family's position in the north of England. To the normal difficulties resulting from an extended minority were added those arising from his mother's second marriage, to Sir Thomas Musgrave of Musgrave, who even after Isabel's death in 1362 tried to keep Clifford out of his mother's dower lands at Skipton, and was dislodged only by litigation in king's bench in 1366. His problems may have helped make Clifford a careful manager of his estates, which he augmented where possible -- he acquired lands at Lamonby, in south Cumberland, and in Appleby. In 1357 he settled Hart and Hartlepool in the bishopric of Durham on himself and his wife, and in 1373 did the same with Brougham, which would be his widow's dower house. In addition he conveyed estates to his eldest son and his brother, both named Thomas. Clifford also speculated in the wardship and marriage market. In 1371 he agreed to pay $240 per annum for nearly three years for the wardship of Ralph, heir to the barony of Greystoke, while in 1388 he paid 500 marks ($333 6's'. 8died) for the marriage of the son and heir of Lord Ferrers of Groby ['see 'Ferrers family (per. c.1240-1445)]. Moreover he strengthened his local position by retaining members of the Cumbrian gentry; in 1368, for instance, he retained Sir Robert Mowbray, lord of Bolton in Allerdale, for $10 per annum in peacetime and $33 6's'. 8died in time of war, but then replaced the peacetime fee with a lease of the manor of Skelton at a highly favourable rent. 
Clifford needed retainers like Mowbray, for he was continually involved in national affairs. In 1359-60 he served in Edward III's expedition to France, and went to France again in the king's retinue in 1369; as part of his preparations for the latter campaign he made an indenture at Brougham with Sir Richard Flemyng of Coningston on 10 July 1369, retaining Flemyng for war in the king's army. Clifford had considerable estates in Ireland, and was more than once ordered to go there to help uphold the English position against native attacks. Finally in September 1379 he was retained by Edmund Mortimer, earl of March, to serve in Ireland for a year with a force of five knights, thirty-four esquires, and forty mounted archers; whether he actually went is uncertain. Clifford was first summoned to parliament on 15 December 1357, and thereafter was regularly summoned to parliaments and councils. He was a trier of petitions in 1363, 1373, 1376, and in both the parliaments of 1377; in November 1381 he was among the lords who demanded the repeal of manumissions granted during the peasants' revolt. 
But Clifford was above all, and to an increasing extent, involved in the defence of the north of England against the Scots. He was first ordered to be ready to defend the borders in November 1356, and received his first commission as a march warden in May 1366. Altogether he received twenty-four such commissions, usually for the west march alone, but on three occasions for the whole of the English border area, and also a number of other appointments relating to the security of the north. In August 1374, for instance, he was one of the commissioners appointed to try to settle the long-running dispute between the Percys and the Douglases over Jedworth Forest. In spite of the fourteen-year truce of 1369 (to which Clifford was one of the English signatories) the borders were never truly at peace. In the autumn of 1372 Clifford was licensed to send an attorney to parliament, so that he could take precautions against a threatened Scottish attack, while after 1377, when the Scots ceased to pay David II's ransom, he became ever more active on the marches. Sheriff of Cumberland in 1377-8, in February 1379 he was made a commissioner of array to enable him to resist invasion. In March 1380 he was instructed to remain on the west march with forty men-at-arms and fifty mounted archers, and in November that year he was one of the deputies of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, appointed to hold a march day with Sir Archibald Douglas. In 1382 he was one of the lords ordered to stay at home in the north for its defence, and on 29 May he was appointed to keep Carlisle Castle for a year. 
Efforts to keep the peace continued; in April 1383 Clifford attended a march day with the earl of Douglas. But the imminence of open war led in December 1383 to an order for the sheriffs of Cumberland and Westmorland to supply masons to carry out repairs to Clifford's castles, and on 2 February 1384 the truce expired. Clifford was at Appleby in October that year, and acted as one of the commanders of the English army's rearguard when Richard II invaded Scotland the following summer. As part of his contribution to the defence of the north-west, he carried out substantial works on Brougham Castle, attested by a stone inscribed 'Thys Made Roger' which was originally placed over the entrance to the great hall, but is now set above the gatehouse arch. But political dissension weakened the English defences, and in August 1388 a Scottish invasion penetrated into north Westmorland and devastated a number of Clifford's estates, including Brougham, Brough, and Appleby. Clifford may not have been there at the time; in May 1388 he had joined the earl of Arundel's expedition to Brittany, possibly as a gesture to take pressure off his eldest son, Thomas Clifford, who was out of favour with the lords appellant, of whom Arundel was one. 
In January 1389 Clifford was appointed a warden of the west march for the last time; he appears to have retreated to Skipton, where he is recorded on 8 May, and it was most likely there that he died of a stroke, on 13 July 1389, having restored his family to a place in the forefront of the northern baronage. He was justly remembered by his descendants as 'one of the wysest and gallantest men of all the Cliffords of his race' (books of record, 2.293). Recorded as a benefactor of the nuns of Arthington, Roger Clifford was probably buried at Bolton Priory, of which he was the patron. His wife, Maud, survived him, dying on 28 February 1403. They had two sons, Thomas, who succeeded as Baron Clifford, and William, who married Anne, daughter of Thomas, Lord Bardolf, and who contrived to flourish under both Richard II and Henry IV, in spite of his support for the Percys in all three of their rebellions against the latter king. They also had two daughters, Katherine, who married her father's ward, Ralph Greystoke, third Baron Greystoke ['see under 'Greystoke family (per. 1321-1487)], and Margaret, who married Sir John Melton. A son Roger, mentioned in a deed of 1365, may have been illegitimate, or may have predeceased his father.

Clifford, Rosamund (b. before 1140?, d. 1175/6), royal mistress, was the daughter of Walter Clifford and Margaret, daughter of Ralph de Tosny, and was born probably before 1140. She is linked to Henry II by a grant, recorded in the hundred rolls of 1274, made by the king of the manor of Corfham to Walter Clifford, 'for the love of Rosamund his daughter' ('Rotuli hundredorum', 2.93-4); but her time living openly as the king's mistress was short indeed. Gerald of Wales, writing just before 1200, said that soon after Henry II had been reconciled with his sons (1174), he imprisoned his wife, Eleanor, and 'having long been a secret adulterer, now openly flaunted his mistress, not that rose of the world ['rosa-mundi'] of false and frivolous renown, but that rose of unchastity ['rosa-immundi']' ('Gir. Camb. opera', 4.21-2). Elsewhere Gerald says that Rosamund was still young when she died, and his contemporary Roger Howden states that, for the love of her, Henry II bestowed many benefits on the convent of Godstow (on the Thames just north of Oxford), where she was buried, and adds that the king gave the convent, which was previously impoverished, many valuable endowments including 'noble buildings'. These grants are well documented in the pipe rolls and Godstow's cartulary: they include two churches at Wycombe and Bloxham and substantial sums of money for building materials from 1175/6 to 1177/8, suggesting that Rosamund died in the first of those accounting years. At about the same time Walter Clifford granted valuable assets to the abbey including several mills and a meadow for the souls of his wife and his daughter Rosamund. And about 1180, according to the English register of Godstow, Bernard de St Valery granted the king the patronage of the abbey 'by a silken thread [cloth] whereof was made a chasuble' (Clark, 1.129-30), so that Rosamund's resting-place was henceforth a royal foundation. The results of this patronage became apparent to Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, when he visited Godstow Abbey in 1191. Here he found Rosamund buried in a magnificent tomb adorned with hangings, lamps, and wax candles, and set in the middle of the church choir in front of the high altar. Disgusted at such profanation he gave orders for her body to be disinterred and reburied outside the church. Higden and others say that she was placed in the chapter house, where her tomb had the inscription: '
This tomb doth here enclose the world's most beauteous Rose, 

Rose passing sweet erewhile, now nought but odour vile. 
(Speed, 471)' As the rhyme suggests, by the fourteenth century Rosamund Clifford had become a figure of romance and legend, much of it associated with her death. In the earliest account of this, in the mid-fourteenth-century 'Croniques de London', Queen Eleanor (who is here confused with Eleanor of Provence, the wife of Henry III) causes Rosamund to be bled to death in a hot bath at Woodstock, after which the king has her body interred at Godstow. Higden, in his colourful 'Polychronicon', describes how at Woodstock 'King Henry had made for her a house of wonderful workmanship, a labyrinth of Daedelian design' ('Polychronicon', 8.52). But in spite of Henry's efforts to hide her from the jealousy of the queen, Eleanor tracked Rosamund down by following her silken embroidery through the maze. What happened next Higden did not know, only that Rosamund's death followed. Still later sources, of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, filled this gap in the story, representing the queen as confronting her beautiful rival and offering her the choice of death by poison or the dagger. Rosamund chose the poisoned bowl, and the grieving king buried her at Godstow. Here the bones of the real Rosamund may have remained until the Reformation, when John Leland (died 1552), as cited by Dugdale, recorded that 'Rosamund's tomb at Godstow nunnery was taken up a-late. It is a stone with this inscription: 'Tumba Rosamundae'' (Dugdale, 4.365). Leland's near contemporary Thomas Allen, who died in 1632 at the age of ninety, said that before its destruction her tomb had contained 'enterchangable weavings drawn out and decked with roses red and green, and the picture of the cup out of which she drank the poison, given her by the queen, carved in stone'. Thomas Hearne, who preserved Allen's account, also recorded local tradition as still pointing out Rosamund's stone coffin in his own time ('c'.1711), although Hearne himself regarded it as 'no more than a fiction of the vulgar' (Hearne, 3.739). 
A sketch of Everswell, adjoining Woodstock Palace, made by John Aubrey in the seventeenth century shows a complex of buildings with pools, a cloister, and a garden. Woodstock was a favourite residence of Henry II and the pipe rolls record that substantial sums were expended on the palace, grounds, and spring during his reign. The spring was known later as 'Rosamund's well', and nearby was a building first called 'Rosamund's chamber' in a pipe roll of 1231. It is likely that much of the villa complex in this area, including its cloister and pools, was laid out by Henry II, perhaps inspired by the rural pavilions of the Norman kings of Sicily. Another influence may have been the romance of Tristan and Isolde, a version of which was probably written for the king. Tristan and Isolde meet in secret in an orchard, and communicate by dropping twigs into the stream that runs through her chamber. Everswell's buildings included a similar orchard, spring, and bower for the secret meetings of Rosamund and Henry II.

Clifford, Thomas, sixth Baron Clifford (1362/3-1391), magnate, was the eldest son of Roger Clifford, fifth Baron Clifford of Westmorland (1333-1389), and his wife, Maud Beauchamp (died 1403). His father started providing for Thomas's future when he was still an infant, in 1365 granting him the Westmorland manor of King's Meaburn for life. Then in 1373 arrangements were made for his marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas, Lord Ros of Helmsley, which had taken place by 2 November. It was apparently a condition of the match that Roger Clifford should settle lands worth $100 on the couple -- he conveyed estates worth 40 marks in 1379, and lands in Brough in 1383. By then Thomas Clifford had entered public life. On 26 October 1379 his father, preparing to go to Ireland, and presumably wishing to ensure that his Cumbrian retainers had Clifford leadership in the event of a Scottish invasion, made an indenture with John Lowther, under which Lowther was to wait upon Thomas, and take him to battle should war break out. 
At that date Thomas Clifford had also started to attend the court -- on 4 May 1379 he secured a pardon for a Yorkshireman's killer. In October 1382 he was one of three 'king's kinsmen and young knights' licensed to hunt in the royal forests ('CPR', '1381-5', 176), and in December that year he was described as one of the king's chamber knights. On 23 October 1385 he received an annual grant of 200 marks, which was converted first into the custody of four manors in the south-west, and then, on 9 January 1387, into the keepership of the forests north of the Trent. Clifford was not allowed, probably did not wish, to forget his northern interests. On 16 December 1384 he was granted the custody of Carlisle Castle for life -- an office he shared with John Neville (died 1388) -- and in March 1386 he was appointed a warden of the west march. When the appellants took power at the end of 1387, Thomas Clifford was one of a number of Richard II's friends who were ordered to leave the court, with the proviso that they be ready to appear before the next parliament. If Clifford did leave, he soon returned, since in September 1388 he was master of the king's horses, and was again described as a chamber knight in May 1389. 
Soon afterwards, on 13 July, Clifford's father died. Aged twenty-six, Thomas was the only Clifford to succeed to his peerage title as an adult before 1523. On 9 October he reaped the benefits of royal favour when he was pardoned the relief due from his lands. On 6 December he was summoned to parliament as a peer. Thomas Clifford was a warlike and adventurous man. In July 1386 he had challenged Sir Jacques de Boucicault, a notable practitioner of chivalry, to joust; in 1387 he was licensed to perform feats of arms in the Anglo-Scottish borders; in 1388 he jousted at Calais. In 1390 (presumably between 26 May and 16 June, dates on which he is recorded in England) he took part in the international tournament held at St Inglevert near Calais, 'honourably and valorously', according to Froissart (Froissart, 2.436), and another French chronicle also describes him as participating in the crusade against Mahdiyya in north Africa later that year. By the end of 1390 he was back in England, and he was at Skipton on 19 January 1391. He was already planning to go abroad again, for on 11 January it was granted that should Clifford die overseas, his attorneys were to have the profits from his estates for a year to pay his debts. 
In the middle of February 1391 Clifford set off for the Baltic, with other young English nobles. During the summer, while he was at Konigsberg, he became involved in a quarrel with Sir William Douglas, an illegitimate son of the earl of Douglas. The two men were old adversaries. Their families had been at feud since 1298, when Edward I granted the Douglas lands in Scotland to the first Lord Clifford. It was doubtless in connection with this that some time before 1390 Clifford challenged Douglas to combat, and that on 6 June 1390 Douglas received a safe conduct to come to England for a suit against Clifford in the English military court. Their encounter in Konigsberg led to a furious brawl in the city streets in which Douglas was killed. Clifford seems to have been overcome by remorse, for he set off for Jerusalem and died on the way there, on an unidentified Mediterranean island, in a state of deep penitence. The exact date is uncertain -- English sources favour 4 October 1391. 
Thomas Clifford had apparently been a happily married man -- he was later referred to by his widow, who lived until 26 March 1424, as 'my most dear lord and husband' (books of record, 2.329). They had two children, a son, John Clifford (died 1422), aged two at his father's death, who succeeded to the lordship, and a daughter, Maud, who was married successively to John Neville, Lord Latimer, from whom she was divorced, and to Richard, earl of Cambridge, executed for treason in 1415. Maud lived until 1446, and remembered her nephew, Thomas Clifford, and great-nephew, John Clifford, in her will.

Clifford, Thomas, eighth Baron Clifford (1414-1455), magnate, was born at Skipton Castle on 20 August 1414, the son of John, seventh Baron Clifford (1388/9-1422), and his wife, Elizabeth Percy (died 1436). Thomas was not quite eight when his father was killed in France, on 13 March 1422, leaving him heir to the baronies of Westmorland, centred upon Appleby, and Skipton in Craven, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In February 1423 his mother and grandmother (Elizabeth Ros, widow of Thomas Clifford, sixth Baron Clifford) paid 800 marks for his marriage and wardship, and on 1 August 1424 entered into an agreement with Thomas, Lord Dacre, whereby Thomas Clifford was to marry Dacre's daughter Joan ('b'. before 1424, died before 1455). The match maintained a political alignment originating in John Clifford's minority, linking the Cliffords with the Percys and the offspring of the first marriage of Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland (who included Thomas Dacre's wife, Philippa), in opposition to the children of Westmorland's second marriage, headed by Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury. 
John Clifford had been only two when his father died in 1391. In 1396 Richard II granted the lordship of Penrith, at the southern end of Cumberland, to Ralph Neville, in 1397 made Neville earl of Westmorland, and early in 1398 gave him the shrievalty of the latter county, in flagrant disregard of the Cliffords' hereditary right in that office. Three months later this last grant was revoked, as a result of opposition which may well have been led by the Percys, but Clifford suspicion of Neville ambitions in the north-west, so close to their own power base, persisted. In 1404 the first earl of Northumberland, acting with the consent of John Clifford's mother, married John to his own daughter Elizabeth, in the process overriding a grant of John's marriage made in August 1403 to Joan Beaufort, the earl of Westmorland's second wife and the earl of Salisbury's mother. When the elder Elizabeth Clifford died in 1424, it can have done nothing to appease Clifford fears that the lordship of Brough, part of her dower, should during her grandson's minority have been awarded to Salisbury, to help him maintain himself in the office of warden of the west march. Two years later Thomas Clifford's mother remarried; her new husband was Ralph Neville, second earl of Westmorland, who was then engaged in a bitter dispute with Salisbury over the first earl's estates. 
Under the indenture of 1424 Thomas Clifford was brought up by his father-in-law, Lord Dacre, who in February 1434 was ordered to bring him before the king's council. He was now twenty years old, and it may have been decided to send him to France -- 'The sonne and heire of the lord Clifford, after lord Clifford' was said to have been a member of the duke of Bedford's retinue before the latter's death in the following year (Stevenson, 2.435). In 1435 he came of age and had livery of his lands, including Brough. On 1 May 1436, no doubt under compulsion, Clifford made a release for wastes perpetrated on his lands to the earl of Salisbury, who in the meantime had been confirmed in his office of steward of the lordship of Kendal. However, Clifford's own resources increased when his mother died on 16 October 1436, giving him possession of her dower. He also began to take part in public affairs. In August 1436 he was a commissioner to resist the Scots when they attacked Berwick and Roxburgh. On 10 December he received his first summons to parliament. From 1437 he was regularly a JP and a commissioner in Westmorland and the West Riding of Yorkshire. But unlike his father and grandfather, he did not risk dissipating his strength in campaigns and other adventures overseas -- reports of his military prowess in France in the sixteenth-century writings of Polydore Vergil and Edward Hall are unsubstantiated by contemporary records, and can be discounted. 
Instead Clifford made strenuous efforts first to recover and then to maintain his family's position in the north-west. In 1437 he is recorded as carrying out substantial works on Skipton Castle -- which explains why he spent that year at Conisbrough Castle, the dower house of his aunt Maud, countess of Cambridge. When Maud died in 1446, her bequests to her nephew included a bed which was to remain forever at Skipton. Clifford also financed a new hall and chapel at Appleby Castle, completing the work in 1454. His political activities between 1437 and the early 1450s are not in general well documented, but their pattern is clear enough. He continued to resist the earl of Salisbury, in the process allegedly countenancing, or even instigating, some of the disorders which troubled the peace of Cumbria during these years, and he maintained his alliances with the senior line of Nevilles and with the Percys. When on 8 August 1444, in two separate transactions, he conveyed his principal estates to two groups of feoffees, one group was headed by Sir John Neville, the second earl of Westmorland's brother, and the other by the earl of Northumberland. One of his daughters, Anne, married Sir Richard Tempest, and another, Elizabeth, married successively Robert Plumpton (died 1450) and William Plumpton (died 1461), sons of Sir William Plumpton (died 1480); both the Tempests and the Plumptons had close links with the Percys. 
In 1448-9 there was a sharp outbreak of Anglo-Scottish hostilities. Clifford was among the northern lords sent to defend the marches, and thanked for their services afterwards. And once the fighting was over, he was several times commissioned to negotiate truces with the Scots, and to maintain them once they were agreed upon. Yet although his interests always lay primarily in the north, Clifford did not neglect to maintain links with the court and central government. He was regularly summoned to parliament, though he did not always come -- in 1454 he was fined $40 for failing to attend. In 1444 he accompanied the earl of Suffolk to France to bring Margaret of Anjou to England. In 1448 he was a supplementary feoffee for the duchy of Lancaster estates under Henry VI's will. He was also a feoffee for the first duke of Buckingham, and an executor for John Talbot, later second earl of Shrewsbury. His sons Roger and Robert married into the Courtenay and Berkeley families respectively. 
Although it is possible that he had shown hitherto underappreciated military or organizational skills in the war against the Scots, his contacts with the court and southern nobility may provide one explanation for Clifford's appointment in March 1452 to assemble ships and sailors for the relief of Calais, threatened by the French. Another may lie in a growing involvement with north-east England, especially with the East Riding of Yorkshire. In 1451 he was granted the subsidy and alnage on cloths in Yorkshire, York, and Hull, and in the early 1450s he was among the noblemen cultivated by the townsmen of York and Hull. Above all, some time before 1454 his eldest son, John Clifford, married Margaret, daughter and heir of Henry Bromflete, Lord Vescy, an important landowner in the East Riding. Perhaps Clifford hoped to give himself greater freedom for manoeuvre by expanding into a region where the Nevilles were considerably less powerful than the Percys. 
Although Clifford was among the lords who confronted the duke of York at Dartford in February 1452, in this he was probably showing loyalty to the king rather than a personal hostility towards the duke. There can be little doubt, however, about his animus towards the earl of Salisbury, as he showed in October 1453, when he joined the Percys in a confrontation with the Nevilles at Topcliffe which only just failed to turn into outright battle. In January 1454 he was reported to be in alliance with the duke of Exeter and Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, in enmity to the Nevilles. Perhaps he had doubts about the wisdom of associating with Egremont, for when York became protector on 27 March 1454, Clifford was prepared to act with him in a commission of oyer and terminer in Yorkshire, and was even instructed to act against Egremont's 'misgovernance and assembles' in Westmorland ('Proceedings... of the Privy Council', 6.194-5), though he cannot be shown to have done so. But when York's protectorate ended in January 1455, Clifford continued to be associated with the court. He was present when his enemy Salisbury resigned as chancellor on 7 March, and was among the king's supporters when they confronted York and the Nevilles at St Albans on 22 May. Indeed, he played a leading part in the battle, so much so that attempts were made afterwards to blame him for its having taken place. When the fighting began he 'kept so strongely the barreres of the same towne' ('John Vale's Book', 192) that the Yorkists were forced to make a flank attack to break into the town. But when they did so Clifford was killed, perhaps the victim of Neville score-settling, though once the battle was lost his prominence in the fray was such as to place him in great peril. His body, which was at first left lying in the street, was later buried in the lady chapel of St Albans Abbey church. His wife Joan Dacre, by family tradition, 'dyed butt a litle before him' (books of record, 2.432). They had four sons -- John, Roger, Robert, and Thomas -- and five daughters -- Elizabeth (who married, in succession, the brothers Robert and William Plumpton ['see under 'Plumpton family]), Maud, Anne, Joan, and Margaret.

Clifford, Thomas, first Baron Clifford of Chudleigh (1630-1673), politician, was born at Ugbrooke Park, Devon, on 1 August 1630, and baptized at the nearby parish church of Chudleigh on 12 August. He was the second child and eldest son of Hugh Clifford, a relatively obscure minor gentleman who led a cadet branch of the great medieval house of Clifford and died on 12 February 1640 leaving an estate worth $374. His mother was Mary, eldest daughter of Sir George Chudleigh of Ashton, Devon. 
Nothing more is known of Clifford until his matriculation at Exeter College, Oxford, on 21 May 1647, a place which he quitted after only a year; almost certainly because he was expelled for royalist and Anglican views in the purge of the university conducted in 1648. His devout Anglicanism -- together with his taste for classical poets and Ben Jonson -- is proved by the commonplace book which he began to keep at university, and his mother's family had become prominent royalists. He seems to have moved directly from Oxford to the Middle Temple, and may have travelled in Europe thereafter; if so, however, his experiences must have been negative, because he never learned another modern language and his attitude towards foreigners was almost consistently hostile. 
Clifford married Elizabeth (died 1709), eldest daughter of William Martyn of Lindridge, his immediate neighbour, on 27 June 1650. It was clearly a love match and the union was an outstanding success, productive of lasting close affection and seven sons and eight daughters. It also seems to have significantly augmented Thomas's wealth, for by 1659 his estate was worth $1490. 
During the whole of the 1650s Clifford seems to have lived at Ugbrooke in domestic bliss and political quarantine, being kept out of any employment by the regimes of the interregnum. It is wholly appropriate, therefore, that his first engagement with public life was in an action which helped to pull down the republic: his prominent role in a meeting of Devon gentry at Exeter in January 1660 which demanded the readmission of the secluded members to the Long Parliament. When that readmission brought about the dissolution of the parliament, he was elected to the convention which succeeded it for the nearby borough of Totnes, and reoccupied the same seat in the Cavalier Parliament of the next year. With the Restoration his pent-up energy and ambition was released. He became one of a clique of young gentlemen from Devon and Cornwall who formed around the comptroller of the household, Sir Hugh Pollard, and could be relied upon to defend the court interest, especially in the Commons. Rewards came swiftly, in an appointment as an extraordinary gentleman of the privy chamber on 21 December 1660 and in a lease of crown land in 1662. It was apparently through Pollard that he formed a friendship -- fast by late 1662 -- with Sir Henry Bennett, subsequently Lord Arlington, who became a powerful and consistent patron to him. 
Most of Clifford's early speeches in parliament have been lost, but it is possible to discern a pattern whereby he supported not merely royal policy but toleration for Catholics and protestant dissenters; the latter stance mirrored that of Arlington, but also seems to have reflected his own interest in the reconciliation of rival forms of Christianity. He also demonstrated a quick temper, most dramatically by coming to blows with Andrew Marvell in the House of Commons itself during a break between business. 
Clifford's real rise to prominence in the house, and in national life, came about in the debates preceding the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665-7. He emerged as one of the most passionate and persuasive of the speakers who, in the course of the year 1664, led the Commons into supporting an aggressive royal policy towards the Dutch and voting enormous supplies for operations against them. Appreciation for his services came in the form of a knighthood during the summer, and a further lease of crown land and a share in the farm of wine and liquor licences in Ireland during the early part of 1665. He also obtained further honour, employment, and profit from the administrative machinery set up to fight the war, being made one of the commission set up to care for sick and wounded sailors and prisoners of war on 27 October 1664, and a sub-commissioner for prizes on 4 January 1665. On 18 January he was appointed, in addition, to the commission which managed the estates of the king's son, the young duke of Monmouth. All this testifies to a belief in his financial acumen and capacity for industry, and he acquitted himself so well as a sub-commissioner that on 28 June the value of a whole prizeship was awarded to him in recognition of the money which he had made and saved the government. 
This achievement is the more remarkable in that for most of the summer Clifford was on active service with the fleet, as a volunteer. He was present at the great battle off Lowestoft on 3 June 1665 and the less successful attack on the Dutch ships in the harbour at Bergen on 2 August, in which he played a prominent part as an agent in the complex negotiations with the Danish governor. The courage and energy which he displayed in these actions, and the clarity and impartiality of the reports which he sent back to Arlington, caused him to be appointed on 29 August as an ambassador-extraordinary to the crowns of Denmark and Sweden. The period from September until January was consumed in this mission to negotiate an alliance against the Dutch, which was rendered fruitless by wider European developments. 
Upon his return to England, Clifford recommenced his duties as a commissioner and rejoined the fleet for the opening of the 1666 fighting season. He witnessed its two main clashes, the four-day battle of 1-4 June and the St James's day fight of 25 July, and won the especial regard of Prince Rupert. The latter recommended him for a command on 1 July and chose him to carry the official report of the victory on the 25th to the king. During August and September he divided his time between patrolling with the navy and acting as a commissioner for sick and wounded ashore. Pepys noted him as 'much set by at court for his activity in going to sea, and stoutness everywhere, and stirring up and down' (Pepys, 17 Sept 1666). 
This fine reputation, and the continued support of Arlington, earned Clifford a major office on 28 November 1666, when he succeeded to Pollard's post as comptroller of the household. On 5 December he was sworn of the privy council, and on 22 May 1667 he was placed on the newly established commission to manage the Treasury, a body of men chosen specifically for their skill in fiscal affairs. His particular ability in that regard was recognized again upon 14 June 1668, when he was promoted treasurer of the household. Clifford had thus become one of the leading figures of the court, and in the process became famed both for the munificence of his hospitality and for his patronage of writers. The greatest of these was Dryden, who repeatedly expressed gratitude to him and later gave him the dedication of his tragedy 'Amboyna'; it seems very likely that it was Clifford who obtained Dryden the office of poet laureate in 1670. Clifford's own patron during this period remained Arlington, who was now the king's chief minister, and he continued to follow the latter's inclinations in parliament -- abstaining during the attack on Clarendon in 1667 and arguing for religious toleration in 1668. The only point at which his views departed from those of his benefactor was over the triple alliance of 1668 in which England joined with its recent enemies, the Dutch. Clifford's detestation of the latter, expressed to such effect in 1664, had become instinctual, and he could never bring himself to speak well of the partnership with them. 
This being so, Clifford must have been mollified by a new employment to which he was put in 1669, as secretary in the clandestine negotiations with the French which were to culminate in the secret treaty of Dover in May 1670. Clifford's appointment to this post must have owed much to the fact that Arlington was the only minister involved in the negotiations. He was in some respects very badly equipped for it, having no knowledge of the French language and regarding France itself with a suspicion which he accorded to all foreign nations, and which was only too patent to the French ambassador, Colbert de Croissy. In others, however, he was ideal. He was totally devoted to the service of his royal master -- something indicated by the manner in which he had repeatedly defended the king's prerogative whenever it had become a matter for debate in the Commons. His dedication and discretion in a highly dangerous and secret negotiation could be deemed absolute; and the truth of this is proved by the manner in which the English copy of the secret treaty, and the working papers of the talks, remained hidden at his seat of Ugbrooke until the nineteenth century. Clifford also possessed technical abilities suited to the work, most of all his ability to draft documents swiftly and accurately. It must have counted for a great deal, moreover, that the two central aspects of the agreement with the French were both very congenial to his own views. One was an alliance against the Dutch, whose power was finally to be broken in a sudden joint attack. The other was an undertaking by Charles II that, if given French financial assistance, he would declare himself to be a Roman Catholic and so attempt to lead his subjects back to the Church of Rome. 
This was a course upon which Clifford's own feet were now set -- probably by the time that the overture to France was made, and certainly by that of the completion of the treaty on 22 May 1670, when he acted as one of the signatories. His commonplace book, kept faithfully since his time as an undergraduate, shows a gradual, if undated, shift from an interest in Anglican devotional works to those more suited to a Catholic. To describe him as a convert at this stage, however, would be seriously misleading; he was, rather, an Anglican who wished to reconcile his church with that of Rome by a process of negotiation and compromise. The secret treaty had stipulated that Charles's declaration of Catholicism would precede the attack on the Dutch, and Clifford accordingly gave thought to the practical details of how it might be effected. He advised the king to repair key fortresses and place them and his guard regiments in safe hands, while preparing a promise of liberty of conscience to all of his subjects who did not feel able to follow his change of faith. At the same time he drafted instructions for an envoy to be sent to the pope to acquaint him with the venture and secure his co-operation; and he worked with a prominent English Benedictine, Hugh Cressy, to draw up possible terms for the reunion of the faiths, by which the pope would write off all land formerly confiscated from the church in England, agree to toleration of protestants, and accept compromise over the questions of the liturgy, communion, reordination, and clerical marriage. All these efforts were in vain, for Charles himself never showed any interest in them. It seems likely, indeed, that his profession of interest in conversion had been a diplomatic ploy to win the friendship of France and to get money from there, and it gradually became eclipsed by preparations for the war with the Dutch. 
Clifford was certainly given ample recompense for these valuable and delicate services, and for those which he continued to give in his official duties in the household and Treasury. In 1669 he obtained a valuable lease of crown land in Buckinghamshire, which was given to his heirs in perpetuity in 1671. In the latter year, also, he was given an annual pension out of the estates of the dean and chapter of Exeter. By this time he had become one of the most important of royal councillors, sitting on the select committee for foreign affairs, which (despite its name) functioned as the principal body for the making of policy in all areas. Although his most obvious expertise was in financial matters, he contributed fully to all debates and played a key part in two celebrated initiatives upon the eve of the war. One was the stop of the exchequer on 2 January 1672, by which all payments to government creditors were suspended in order to release the full income of the state for military measures. There seems to be little doubt that the idea for it was Clifford's own, and its bold and ruthless nature has the full stamp of his character; it is equally obvious why, despite much argument, it was accepted by the rest of the privy council, for it provided such a simple and effective solution to the acute short-term problem of how to equip a fleet for a surprise attack. Clifford also supported the second dramatic measure, the declaration of indulgence on 15 March which licensed public worship for protestant dissenters and private worship for Catholics. It was so completely in harmony with the views that he had expressed consistently for ten years that his enthusiasm for it is hardly surprising; what is worth emphasizing is that this was shared by all the rest of the committee for foreign affairs, with the sole exception of Charles himself, who was persuaded into it only with difficulty. 
On 22 April 1672 Clifford was elevated to the peerage with the title of Baron Clifford of Chudleigh as part of the general round of creations and promotions accorded to the king's chief minister and councillors to encourage them at the outset of the war. In May he made a last attempt to persuade Charles to form plans for his declaration of allegiance to Rome, and then turned his energies to the prosecution of the war, this time at the level of high financial administration and policy making. In June, when the Dutch seemed to be ready to sue for peace, he outstripped all other members of the foreign affairs committee in pressing for harsh terms, involving either the dismemberment of the Dutch state or the annexation of part of it by England. His colleagues agreed upon a much more moderate package, and it was Arlington, sent as one of the plenipotentiaries, who ensured that it was more moderate still. Despite this it was rejected, but the difference in attitudes to the Dutch between Clifford and his old benefactor, which had briefly opened over the matter of the triple alliance, had reappeared in much more glaring form. This may have been assisted by the growing friendship between Clifford and a still more powerful figure, the heir presumptive to the throne, James, duke of York. The latter had travelled in parallel with him in an increasing sympathy for the Church of Rome and support for a royal declaration of reconciliation to it. During the summer of 1672 the connection between the two men became obvious, as Clifford effectively looked after James's affairs while the royal duke commanded at sea. 
By autumn the switch of allegiance had become obvious, and was dramatically illustrated on 28 November when Charles formally dissolved the Treasury commission and vested ultimate control of state finances in Clifford, with the revived office of lord treasurer. James later claimed the credit for having persuaded his brother into the choice, and indeed it can be argued that of all Charles's leading servants he was the best qualified for the job. Arlington, however, saw things differently. He had been expecting to receive the post himself, only to see it awarded to somebody whom he had himself helped to power. His sense of betrayal, and of ingratitude upon the part of a former client, made a complete and lasting rupture in relations between the two men. At this cost, Clifford accepted the office and set about it with the systematic hard work which he had brought to all his previous duties. Each Saturday he personally drew up lists of all the moneys to be paid out by the Treasury, and his care is visible in every other department of its activities. A story often repeated by historians, that at his suggestion the fleet was kept at sea all winter because the government could not afford to pay it off after the summer campaign, is a political libel. In fact the sailors were paid in full during the autumn, and -- due in large part to French subsidies and a trade boom but also to sound management -- the government actually concluded the first year of war in financial surplus. 
In the winter of 1672-3 Clifford reached the apogee of his career. He was now both in office and influence one of the great ministers of state, and has traditionally been grouped with Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale in a government known (from the first initials of their titles) as the Cabal. The perception of their pre-eminent importance is correct, but at no time did they function as a group; the last three were all allied against Clifford and Arlington, while these were divided by their quarrel in November, and Clifford was closest to the duke of York, who was by definition not a minister or court official but clearly an important figure in policy discussions at this time. On the other hand, apart from the pleasing coincidence of the initials, there is one good reason for applying the nickname to the ministry: that Clifford himself used it, although in a different spelling and in the common contemporary sense of a small group of people engaged in secretive business. In a letter to Lauderdale in 1672 he referred to the leading royal advisers as 'the caball' (BL, Add. MS 23135, fol. 203). 
Clifford was now adopting the lifestyle of a magnate as well as the responsibilities of a minister. He commenced the emparking and rebuilding of his ancestral home of Ugbrooke, purchased fine Dutch and Flemish paintings, commissioned portraits and landscape scenes from artists such as Lely and Dankers, and had tapestries of 'New Testament' scenes made at the Pointz factory in Hatton Garden; several of these works survive at Ugbrooke. His whole position, however, was to be destroyed by a single financial circumstance: that the government had only half the money needed to send the navy out against the Dutch in the approaching summer of 1673. The remainder could be obtained only by a parliamentary grant, and the members of the Cabal, including Clifford, made strenuous efforts to canvass MPs with whom they had ties in preparation for the spring session. All were in vain; when that session opened in February, the Commons, deeply suspicious and resentful of the crown's policy towards religion, made the vital grant conditional upon the recall of the declaration of indulgence and the passage of a statute, which became known as the 'Test Act', to make the holding of public office conditional upon the taking of Anglican communion. 
Clifford, accompanied by York, Ashley (now earl of Shaftesbury), and Lauderdale, urged the king vehemently to sacrifice the taxes, and the Dutch war, rather than agree to these demands. Arlington and lesser advisers, supported by the French, counselled the opposite course, and it seems likely that Charles's own natural inclinations, which had been against the declaration of indulgence, were upon their side. At any rate he withdrew the declaration on 8 March, an act which expedited the grant of supply but did nothing to slow the progress of the bill for a religious test. Charles himself seems to have regarded this without alarm, and even encouraged its progress to please the Commons -- apparently because he believed that it would actually have the effect of pushing his brother, and Clifford, back into the Anglican fold. Clifford himself, who must already have been facing the opposite likelihood, became the only minister to oppose the bill, delivering a speech of frantic denunciation when the measure reached the House of Lords in mid-March. With the king seeming to countenance the measure, and Shaftesbury overtly doing so with the prestige of the office of lord chancellor, these efforts were unavailing, and the bill passed into law at the end of the month. 
The 'Test Act' supplied Clifford with a succeeding interval of two months in which to reach a decision upon his response. To state that the act exposed him as a Roman Catholic would be false; rather, it forced him to make a formal conversion. Until this point his position had remained that of an Anglican who, in the words of his friend John Evelyn, jotted down in 1671, was 'a little warping to Rome' (Evelyn, 3.577, 17 May 1671). On 17 July of that year a chapel had been consecrated at Ugbrooke according to the rites of the Church of England, although dedicated to Cyprian, proponent of the unity of Christendom. The chapel at Clifford's London residence as lord treasurer was also Anglican, and on 8 April and 18 June 1673 he attended the successive weddings of his two eldest daughters there, conducted by a minister of the Church of England. He postponed the resignation of his offices for the longest possible duration permitted by the 'Test Act', until 19 June; and only after that did he commence, and adhere to, the open practice of Catholic worship. It seems very likely that his loyal and straightforward nature would have dictated his resolution once the reunion of the churches seemed to be indefinitely postponed and he had come to regard that of Rome as the essential one. It may also be argued, however, that his decision was influenced to some extent by that of his great friend and patron the duke of York, who took the same course and resigned his own posts on the preceding day. 
It was now perfectly possible for Clifford to remain a prominent figure at the royal court, relieved of the burdens of office while enjoying the new financial and social position which they had bequeathed. He chose instead to retire completely from public life, and prepared for a resumption of that relaxed existence of provincial seclusion which he had known in the 1650s. Even this, however, was to be denied to him by destiny, for he died at Ugbrooke on 17 October, and was interred in the chapel there two days later. Some mystery and controversy hangs over the circumstances of his end. It is clear that his health had been declining for years under the strains of his public position and duties. By September 1671 he was already expressing fatigue, and envy for ministers who had retired honourably from office. In the summer of 1672 he was seriously ill and obliged to take the waters at Bath to assist a recovery. Writing to Sir Joseph Williamson at that time, he commented that 'I am ever in pain' ('CSP dom.', '1672', 414). Immediately after his resignation in the following year he was found taking another rest-cure at a spa, this time Tunbridge Wells. No doubt the terrible emotional pressures which preceded that event had taken their toll, but it is also beyond doubt that he was suffering from a real complaint, subsequently diagnosed as urinary stones. He made his will ten days before he died, suggesting the recognition of a mortal illness. On 13 October a correspondent in London confirmed that his doctors 'expect nothing but his death' and that the cause was indeed an exceptionally severe attack of stones (Christie, 2.40). 
There would therefore be no question over the manner of Clifford's end, and a persistent if subdued rumour that he had committed suicide could be dismissed as religious rancour, were it not for the remarkably circumstantial account of his death by self-induced strangulation recorded by Evelyn. It must be noted, however, that Evelyn's source seems to have been at least secondhand, and that he himself thought the matter 'not confidently affirm'd' (Evelyn, 4.21, 18 Aug 1673). It seems likely, therefore, that the story was a libel. 
Clifford's talents as an administrator and minister are undoubted. The lucidity of the reports which he made to Arlington and others during his service at sea and as a diplomat is as patent to the historian as it was to his recipients. The letters which he wrote as a financial officer are equally fluent and shrewd, and his acumen in monetary matters is as obvious as his industry and dedication in them. He enjoyed a reputation for probity in office even among his enemies; after his resignation an observer of metropolitan affairs could say that all thought him 'an exact honest man and uncorrupted' (Christie, 1.46). Pepys considered that he spoke 'very well and neatly' in the House of Commons (Pepys, 5.294, 11 Oct 1664). 
Clifford's self-discipline in business was balanced, however, by an exceptionally quick temper and passionate nature, well expressed in the leonine features and stubborn mouth which are displayed in his portraits. Colbert de Croissy, who generally thought well of him, rued his 'excessive ardour' (Croissy to Louis, 17 April 1673, Correspondance politique, Angleterre, 106). It was a combination of the total dedication with which he pursued practical tasks, the emotional fervour with which he invested ideological causes, the utter lack of flexibility or moral relativism with which he viewed the world, and an ingrained natural piety which made him such an impressive figure and ultimately led to his political ruin. He was succeeded in his title and estates by his fourth son, Hugh, and perhaps his most enduring achievement may be accounted his foundation of one of England's most remarkable noble Catholic families.

Clifford, Walter de (d. 1190), landowner and soldier, was the son of Richard fitz Pons and Maud, the daughter of Walter of Gloucester. Richard was still alive in 1128 but had died by 1138, when Walter de Clifford exchanged his manor of Glasbury for that of 'Esleche' held by Gloucester Abbey. By that same year Walter held Clifford Castle and the Herefordshire 'Domesday' reports that he held it in the 1160s, along with the manors of Hampton, Hamnish, Rochford, Dorstone, 'Burchstanestone', 'Roenoura', Hanley, and 'Madme' -- all lands which his uncle Drew fitz Pons had held in 1086. By 1116 Richard fitz Pons had established a castle at Llandovery from which he dominated Cantref Selyf in central south Wales. Walter de Clifford inherited this castle but lost it in a resurgence of Welsh power about 1140. From 'c'.1143 to 1155 he was a prominent member of the retinue of Roger, earl of Hereford, and worked to assist Roger's ambitions in the southern march. In 1158 his position in south Wales was restored. The 'Brut y tywysogyon' reports that in that year Clifford raided the lands of Rhys ap Gruffudd, the Lord Rhys (died 1197), who, after his complaint about this to Henry II went unheeded, retaliated by besieging and capturing the castle. Clifford clearly continued to be active in southern Wales, for the pipe roll for 1160 reports that $44 7's'. 6died was paid to troops in Cantref Bychan through him. In 1163 he killed Cadwgan ap Maredudd. The 'rapprochement' reached between Henry II and Rhys in 1171 gave the latter possession of Cantref Bychan and deprived the Cliffords of their foothold there. 
The children of Walter de Clifford and his wife, Margaret de Tosny, who was probably the daughter of Ralph de Tosny, included another Walter, who may have been the eldest son, Richard, and Rosamund Clifford (b. before 1140?, d. 1175/6). Rosamund lived openly with Henry II as his mistress in the mid-1170s. It was probably because of this relationship that the king granted the Shropshire manor of Corfham to Clifford in 1177. He held this from the king in chief for the service of one knight's fee. After Walter de Clifford's death in 1190, Richard inherited Clifford. He may have died in 1199, for the younger Walter succeeded to Corfham and other lands in that year.

Clifford, William (bap. 1594, d. 1670), Roman Catholic priest, was baptized on 10 November 1594 at Louth, Lincolnshire, the son of Henry Clifford of Brackenborough, Lincolnshire, and Elizabeth Thimelby (1565-1642) of Irnham, Lincolnshire, who after the death of her husband became a professed canoness of St Augustine at Louvain. He was descended from the family of the barons Clifford, to which he may have become male heir in 1643, but his humility prevented him from asserting an erroneous claim to the barony. He was educated in St Alban's, the English college at Valladolid, where he was ordained priest and after a short stay at Douai he was sent to England. In May 1630, after ten years work on the mission, he was sent by Bishop Richard Smith, the vicar apostolic of England, to become vice-president and procurator of the English College at Lisbon. He left in 1634 for Rome, from where he returned to England in 1636. He was made a member of the chapter in 1638 and then in 1640 was appointed superior of the College de Tournai at Paris, which Cardinal Richelieu had founded for the higher education of the English clergy. Between 1655 and 1658 he was recommended to become vicar apostolic but he declined this honour. During the latter years of his life he resided in the Hopital des Incurables at Paris, where he spent the greater part of his time in ministering to the wants of the poor inmates. He died there on 30 April 1670, and was buried in the churchyard belonging to the hospital. A copy of the inscription on his tomb is preserved in the archives of the archbishop of Westminster. 
Clifford wrote two works of spiritual direction, 'Christian Rules Proposed to the Vertuous Soul' (1655) and 'A Little Manual of the Poor Man's Dayly Devotion' (1669) as well as a translation of the 'Spiritual Combat' of Lorenzo Scupoli.

Clifford, William Kingdon (1845-1879), mathematician and philosopher of science, was born on 4 May 1845 at Exeter, the eldest son of William Clifford, a justice of the peace who died in 1878. His mother, whose maiden name was Kingdon, died not long after he was born. Clifford's studies at Mr Templeton's school in Exeter prepared him for entrance in 1860 to King's College, London, where he pursued a wide range of classical, literary, and scientific subjects. He developed an interest in mathematics and obtained a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1863. He won the college declamation prize in 1866 for an oration on Sir Walter Raleigh and in November of that year he was elected to a university debating club, the Cambridge Conversazione Society, also known as the Apostles. A common memory of his friends from student days was of Clifford's gymnastic feats. Though slight, he demonstrated considerable dexterity and strength; he could, for example, do pull-ups with only one hand on the horizontal bar. In the Apostles, Clifford met a fellow third-year student, Frederick Pollock, who was studying the classical curriculum and who became one of Clifford's closest friends. Pollock's introduction to Clifford's 'Lectures and Essays' (1879) is a principal source of biographical information about him and, in particular, tries to document what little is known about Clifford's seemingly gradual movement away from his high-church upbringing. A major influence in this direction came from reading the authors that Clifford and Pollock most often discussed: Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Benedict de Spinoza, and Giuseppe Mazzini. 
In 1867 Clifford was ranked second wrangler in the university mathematical tripos and was second Smith's prizeman. His friends were surprised at his doing so well in the face of all his non-mathematical activities and the small amount of time he appeared to put into studying for the examination. The following year he was elected a fellow of Trinity College and gave his first public discourse to a large audience, 'On some of the conditions of mental development', at the Royal Institution in London. This talk, which applied Herbert Spencer's ideas on biological evolution to the development of the mind, established him as an effective and popular speaker on scientific topics. Until 1875, when failing health curtailed his public speaking, Clifford addressed general audiences on topics such as the history of the sun, the evidence for an ether, the relation between science and poetry, and Charles Babbage's calculating machines. 
In 1870 Clifford received his MA and went on the English expedition to observe the solar eclipse of December that year in the Mediterranean. In spite of the wreck of his ship near Catania, Italy, this trip gave Clifford a taste for travel and a love of the Mediterranean region. He moved from Cambridge in 1871 to take up the professorship of applied mathematics at University College, London. In 1874 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society for, among other things, his distinction in 'the metaphysics of geometrical and physical science' (RS archives, election certificate, 1874). On 7 April 1875 he married Lucy ['see 'Clifford, (Sophia) Lucy Jane (1846-1929)], daughter of John Lane. They had two daughters. Clifford's friends described him as having an amicable attitude towards everyone but enjoying himself most when planning children's parties and joining in the entertainment. Although he practised his athletic abilities beyond his student days, he was not particularly careful about his health and was known to stay up all night on occasion in order to complete a mathematical project. In 1876 he had symptoms of a pulmonary disease and reluctantly took a six-month leave of absence. His friend Leslie Stephen, later to become editor of the 'Dictionary of National Biography', began a subscription to pay for a trip to the warmer climate of Spain and Algiers. This mitigated Clifford's continuing weakness but in early 1878 his condition worsened to such an extent that, following medical advice, he and his wife travelled to the Mediterranean. Again he seemed improved on his return but the next year a relapse caused them to journey to Madeira where he remained for the last few months of his life. 
Clifford's years of illness were at the same time among the most mathematically productive of his short life, and he was encouraged to continue by some of the leading mathematicians of the day. Olaus Henrici reported on 26 June 1878 (Royal Society Library, RR.8.84) on a paper submitted by Clifford to the Royal Society, entitled 'Classification of locii', that the work was a 'very important one and the simplicity of the methods used... fully worthy of the genius of Clifford'. Although, 'owing to the bad state of health of its author' the work was still 'fragmentary and under ordinary circumstances' not publishable, he nevertheless recommended that it 'be printed as it stands, with the addition perhaps of one or two explanatory notes' since Clifford was in no condition to correct the manuscript. Such notes supplied by Henrici and others to this and other works in the 'Mathematical Papers' (1882) are a useful, indeed essential, adjunct to Clifford's original presentations. 
On his death, Clifford's wife gave his unfinished manuscripts to those of his colleagues who were willing to complete them and see to their publication. One such manuscript, for a book concerned with the bases of pure and applied mathematics, was completed by Karl Pearson and published in 1885 as 'The Common Sense of the Exact Sciences'. Though Clifford intended the work to be readable by the layperson, it was more than a popularization of mathematics since it contained many original ideas. Bertrand Russell, in a preface for the 1946 edition, described his enthusiasm in reading the book at the age of fifteen in 1887. Russell had been puzzling over Euclid's geometry and was delighted to find that there was a rationale for geometry, and mathematics generally, that he found lacking in Euclid's presentation. 
Most of Clifford's mathematical work centred on geometry which, considered as the study of space, he regarded as an empirical science. He believed that Immanuel Kant's argument for an a priori, universal component in mathematics was justified by discoveries about human development, perception, and language made since Kant's time by Darwin, Spencer, and Max Muller. Clifford readily adapted to his own use the work on invariant theory by the leading British mathematicians of the time, Arthur Cayley and James Joseph Sylvester. His discovery of a generalization of quaternions, which he termed 'biquaternions', and of the algebra associated with them (and later named after him), was built upon the work of the Irishman William Rowan Hamilton, who discovered quaternions, and of the German Hermann G. Grassmann, whose ideas Clifford helped to propagate in the English-speaking world. Clifford also used Hamilton's quaternions in his 'Elements of Dynamic: an Introduction to the Study of Motion and Rest in Solid and Fluid Bodies' (1878). Though quaternions themselves did not continue to play such a direct role in physics, the notions Clifford derived from them, such as the divergence of a vector, and the vector and scalar products, continued to be useful in twentieth-century physics. Clifford's biquaternions, on the other hand, found applications (unanticipated by Clifford) in the representation of the wave function in quantum physics. 
Invariant theory and biquaternions, though algebraic topics, have strong connections in Clifford's work to geometry and in particular to the non-Euclidean geometries that were discovered earlier in the nineteenth century but became incorporated into the main body of mathematics only during his lifetime. Intrigued by the possibility that one of these new geometries could describe the physical world better than the traditional Euclidean geometry, he made new discoveries concerning all of them but singled out as his favourite candidate the elliptic geometry. He discovered a surface (since named the 'Clifford surface') in elliptic space with the unexpected property of supporting parallel lines ('Clifford parallels'). In an abstract for proposed work in 1870 he posited that motion of matter could be explained by the variation of the curvature of space. This anticipation of one of the features of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity forty years later came from his reading of the German mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, whose key work in this area Clifford translated into English ('On the hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry'). 
Many of Clifford's popular lectures and writings strongly upheld scientific reasoning over religious dogma. His lively, aphoristic style and authoritative and wide-ranging knowledge made him an influential spokesman for a certain view of the scientific spirit of the late nineteenth century. His creed expressed in 'The ethics of belief' (1876), that 'it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence' (Clifford, 'Lectures', 1.186), was approvingly cited by others such as the psychologist William James in his 'Will to Believe' (1897). Scientific progress for Clifford was made by having doubts, not faith. His anti-religious stance was so rigorous that, as James Sully expressed it in a review of 'Lectures and Essays', Clifford had a 'religious abhorrence of religion' and thus could be said to have adopted a dogmatism comparable to that of his high-church upbringing ('The Academy', 17, 1880, 133-4). Clifford was the basis for William Hurrell Mallock's young materialist, Mr Saunders, in 'The New Republic' (1877), an unflattering caricature that Mallock moderated somewhat in the version that appeared shortly after Clifford's death. One of the tenets of Clifford's alternative to the usual religious views was his version of a psychological atomism that asserted that 'Reason, intelligence, and volition are properties of a complex which is made up of elements, themselves not rational, not intelligent, not conscious' (Clifford, 'Lectures', 2.87). Twentieth-century theories of self-organization may have made Clifford's notion scientifically more acceptable, but his views undoubtedly appeared rather extreme in his time. 
Clifford sought to formulate an ethic consistent with his philosophical and scientific positions and, like Spinoza, one that had geometrical certainty. He felt that the theory of evolution, when applied to societies, provided the best available scientific foundation for ethical beliefs and that the theory implied that the survival of the community depends on how well it treats its members. Ethics is thus a matter for the community, not for 'self-regarding' individuals, and happiness is desirable only if it makes for a more efficient citizen. Society must support creative activity and the search for truth by an individual, wherever that may lead, since a knowledge of the truth has great social importance. The formality of his ethics, however, contrasted with his more flexible and open personal manner: 'All this, by the way', he wrote to Frederick Pollock's wife, 'is only theory; my practice is just like other people's' (Clifford, 'Lectures', 1.49). 
Clifford died at Madeira on 3 March 1879. He was buried in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex. His friends began a subscription for a pension to benefit his family which otherwise would have been without income. His wife, Lucy, maintained their social circle and became a confidante of literary figures such as George Eliot, James Russell Lowell, and Henry James. She wrote a number of novels, her first and best known being 'Mrs Keith's Crime' (1885). She died on 21 April 1929 and was also buried in Highgate cemetery.

Clift, William (1775-1849), museum curator and scientific illustrator, was born at Burcombe, near Bodmin, Cornwall, on 14 February 1775, and was baptized (as William Cleft) in the Bodmin parish church on 12 April that year. He was the youngest of the seven children (Elizabeth, Joanna, Robert, Thomas, John, one of unknown name, and William) of Robert Clift (1720-1784), a miller, whose death left his wife, Joanna, 'nee' Coutts ('bap'. 1733), a seamstress, and family in poverty. Clift was sent to school at Bodmin, and his abilities at illustration drew the attention of Walter Raleigh Gilbert of The Priory, Bodmin (one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to George III), and his wife, Nancy Hosken, 'a lady of great accomplishments'. Mrs Gilbert had been a schoolfellow of Anne Home, who married the celebrated surgeon John Hunter (1728-1793) in 1771. Mrs Gilbert recommended Clift as an apprentice to Hunter to replace his former anatomical assistant, William Bell, emphasizing his abilities as an artist. Clift arrived in London on 14 February 1792, and was accepted by Hunter as his apprentice for a six-year period without the payment of the standard apprenticeship fee, on the understanding that he was to make drawings, copy dictation, and assist in the care of the anatomical museum which Hunter had created on the property between his two residences on Castle Street and Leicester Square. 
While Hunter lived this arrangement proved satisfactory to both of them: Clift assisted Hunter with his dissections and wrote from his dictation from early morning until late at night. Hunter's sudden death on 16 October 1793 passed his two residences to his wife, Anne, and his son John and daughter Agnes. His massive collection of 18,682 anatomical preparations was willed to his brother-in-law Everard Home and assistant, Matthew Baillie, with instructions to offer it for sale to parliament. Wartime economies made parliament reluctant to purchase it, however, and during negotiations for sale Clift was engaged during 1793-9 by Hunter's executors to watch over the collections, living with an old housekeeper in Hunter's residence on Castle Street; for this he received a meagre income. He was solely responsible for the safety and preservation of the collection, and guarded it with zeal. Fearing for its safety Clift copied out for private keeping nearly half of Hunter's unpublished manuscripts (thus saving this material from Home's intentional destruction of the main body of the original manuscripts in 1823). Clift was a tireless curator and when parliament agreed to purchase the collection in 1799 it was reported to be in a better state than at its owner's death. The Company of Surgeons, incorporated in 1800 as the College of Surgeons of England, was asked by parliament in 1799 to assume the charge of the collection, to which it agreed in December that year. 
One of the first acts of the trustees of the new college was to retain Clift's services, dignifying him with the title of conservator of the Hunterian Museum at a salary of $80 per annum. From that date his time and talents were devoted to the collection. Under his supervision Hunter's collections were twice moved without damage, first in 1806 from their Castle Street location to a temporary warehouse on Lincoln's Inn Fields, where they remained until 1813 while the original College of Surgeons buildings were constructed, and again during the rebuilding of the museum and college in 1834-7. Clift was a scrupulous record-keeper and his surviving diaries covering the years 1811 to 1842 supply a detailed insight into the workings of the College of Surgeons, the Hunterian Museum, and London scientific life generally. He lived to see the museum enriched and enlarged to become the foremost museum of comparative anatomy in the world. On 21 January 1801 Clift married Caroline Harriet Pope (1775-1849) at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. His only son, William Home Clift (1803-1832), a fine illustrator whom Clift was preparing as his successor, died on 17 September 1832 from injuries sustained in a carriage accident. His only daughter, Caroline Amelia Clift, was born in September 1801 ('bap'. 10 January 1802) and died on 7 May 1873. She married Clift's assistant Richard Owen (1804-1892) at St Pancras New Church on 20 July 1835; their only child, William (1837-1886), left one son, Richard Startin Owen. 
Clift's dedication to science and his reputation for care and thoroughness gave him a standing in the scientific community that went beyond his limited scientific publications. He was praised by the surgeon John Flint South, Sir Benjamin Brodie the elder (1783-1862), Sir Joseph Banks, William Wollaston, and Humphry Davy, and through the influence of the latter was elected FRS on 8 May 1823. He was also a member of the Society for Animal Chemistry, a small London scientific association created as an assistant society of the Royal Society of London in 1809, and drawn from members of the Royal Institution and the College of Surgeons. This group was dedicated to the study of physiology and animal chemistry, communicating results through publications in the 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'. It died out in 1825. 
Clift was also interested in palaeontology and geology and was a fellow of the Geological Society. His knowledge of palaeontological and geological issues was acknowledged by Gideon Mantell, Georges Cuvier, and Charles Lyell. Clift's skills as an anatomical illustrator were early displayed in print in Matthew Baillie's 'A series of engravings... to illustrate the morbid anatomy of some of the most important parts of the human body' (1799-1803), for which he was the unnamed illustrator. Similarly, many of the 320 illustrations in Home's 100 papers on anatomical subjects in the 'Philosophical Transactions' were by Clift. Clift himself contributed papers to the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1815 and 1823, to the 'Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal' for 1831, and to the 'Transactions of the Geological Society' in 1829 and 1835. His paper 'On the fossil remains... found on the left bank of the Irawadi' in the 'Transactions of the Geological Society' for 1829 was reprinted in an appendix to John Crawfurd's 'Journal of an Embassy from the Governor General of India to the Court of Ava' (1829). Richard Owen published in 1861 two volumes of 'Essays and Observations on Natural History, Anatomy, &c., by John Hunter', drawn in the main from the private copies made by Clift of Hunter's manuscripts between 1793 and 1800. Clift himself had contemplated their publication and drawn up some notes for that purpose, but never carried this out. Some of these had been previously published in part in Owen and Clift's 'Descriptive and illustrated catalogue of the physiological series of comparative anatomy contained in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons' (1833-1840), but the whole collection was not placed in Owen's hands until a short time before Clift's death. With Owen's assistance, Clift was also the primary compiler of the 'Catalogue of the Hunterian Collection of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of London' (1830-31). 
In 1842 Clift retired from full-time duties at the museum and moved with his wife to Stanhope Cottage, Mornington Crescent, Hampstead Road; he was replaced as curator by his son-in-law. Caroline Clift died on 8 May 1849 and Clift himself died of unspecified causes at his home shortly afterwards, on 20 June 1849. Both were buried in Highgate cemetery. His esteem in the scientific and medical communities is indicated by several laudatory obituaries that appeared on his death in such periodicals as 'The Lancet' and the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'. 
Clift's personal effects were sold at auction in August 1849, and his papers were either retained by the College of Surgeons, were passed to Owen, or were acquired at auction. Those in the possession of Owen, including the main collection of the Clift correspondence, are now in the Natural History Museum as part of the Owen papers. An additional collection of manuscripts was obtained by the College of Surgeons in 1945 from materials that had been in the possession of Thomas Madden Stone, assistant librarian to the college from 1832 to 1853.

Clifton, Francis (d. 1736), physician, was the fourth and youngest son of Josiah Clifton, merchant, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and his wife, Mary, only child of Thomas Fenne of the same town. Choosing to join the medical profession, he entered Leiden University on 23 May 1724, and graduated as doctor of medicine there in September of the same year. His inaugural dissertation, 'De distinctis et confluentibus variolis', was later published. 
Clifton afterwards settled in London, where his classical and scientific learning won him the friendship of many eminent men, among them Sir Hans Sloane, on whose proposition he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 22 June 1727. The same year he published 'Hippocratis Coi operum quae extant omnium secundum leges artis medicae dispositorum, editionis novae specimen', and in 1732 he published a proposal to print a new edition of the works of Hippocrates; however, lack of sufficient subscriptions meant that it never appeared. Clifton received the honorary degree of MD from Cambridge on 26 April 1728, during the visit of George II; he was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 23 December in the same year and a fellow on 22 December 1729, and gave the Goulstonian lectures in 1732. He also held the appointment of physician to the prince of Wales, which he resigned in 1734, when he abruptly left London for Jamaica. 
Writing to Sir Hans Sloane from Kingston, Jamaica, on 3 June 1736, Clifton says: 'My misfortunes came so fast upon me, and my brother's provocations were so frequently repeated, that I was hurried in a manner to death about 'em' (BL, Sloane MS 4041, fol. 9). He died there a few weeks afterwards, leaving a widow, Sarah Banckes, daughter of a merchant in Leadenhall Street, London. There were no children of the marriage. In the letters of administration granted on 6 November 1736 to his widow, Clifton is described as 'late of the parish of St George, Hanover Square, Middlesex, but at Kingston in Jamaica, deceased'. His widow survived until 1747, and was buried in the parish church of St Andrew Undershaft (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/754, sig. 145). 
At the time of his death Clifton was engaged in drawing up an account of the diseases of Jamaica, but left it unfinished. Among his other works was 'The State of Physick, Ancient and Modern, Briefly Considered', in which he maintained that Hippocrates had anticipated Newton in his idea of the system of gravitation. A French version by the Abbe Desfontaines was published at Paris in 1742.

Clifton, John Charles (1781-1841), music teacher, was born in London on 7 November 1781. His father intended him to become a merchant, but his early talent for music was such that he was placed in the care of a relative, Richard Bellamy, with whom he studied music for five years. He then became a pupil of Charles Wesley, and eventually decided to follow music as a profession, giving up a position as a clerk in the Stationery Office which he had held for about two years. 
Clifton's first professional engagement was at Bath, where he conducted the Harmonic Society. In 1802 he went to Dublin and became a music master, and in 1816 he produced there a successful piece, 'Edwin and Angelina' (after Goldsmith), written with Sir John Stevenson. He also organized, with Stevenson, a large-scale concert in aid of famine relief in Ireland. About 1816 he invented an instrument to aid sight-singing called the 'Eidomusicon', which does not appear to have been patented. About the same time he finished a plan of music education detailed in his 'Theory of Harmony Simplified', and about 1817 lectured in Dublin on both the plan and the invention. In 1818 Clifton moved to London in order to have his ideas published, but the project proved too expensive and impractical. He then adopted the Logierian system of musical instruction, and for some years was a teacher of repute in London; he also became an associate of the Philharmonic Society. He married the proprietress of Teresa House, a ladies' boarding-school in Hammersmith, where the last years of his life were spent, and where he taught singing and the piano for a time. His compositions consist chiefly of songs and glees, one of which gained the prize offered by the Manchester Glee Club. 
Around 1838 Clifton's mental health deteriorated and he became possessed with the idea that he was enormously wealthy; the delusion grew to such an extent that it was found necessary to place him under a gentle restraint. The 'Musical World' (25 November 1841) described how, 'even during this time, the generosity of his heart was made manifest by his anxiety to make very handsome presents to his friends and acquaintances'. He died at Teresa House on 18 November 1841.

Clifton, Richard (c.1553-1616), separatist minister in the Netherlands, was born at Normanton, Derbyshire, the eldest son of Thomas Clifton of Normanton and his first wife. On 12 February 1585 Clifton was instituted to the vicarage of Marnham near Newark, Nottinghamshire. On 11 July 1586 he was instituted to the rectory of Babworth, near Retford, in the same county. That September he married Anne ('c'.1555-1613), daughter of I. Stuffen of Warsop, Nottinghamshire. The couple had at least three sons born at Babworth: Zachary (12 May 1589), Timothy (29 September 1595), and Eleazer (1 November 1598). Three daughters, also born at Babworth, died in infancy. 
In May 1591 Clifton was charged in the Nottingham archdeaconry court with various misdemeanours, including failure to read the injunctions, to announce saints' days, to wear the surplice, and to use the cross in baptism. No punishment seems to have been imposed. However, on 15 March 1605, having been warned several times, Clifton was presented in the court of chancery at York for nonconformity to the new canons. He was ordered to confer with William Palmer, chancellor of York Minster, and in the hope of his future conformity was respited until 12 April. Then, in a hearing before Archbishop Matthew Hutton, he was deprived of his living and suspended from the ministry. On 6 March 1607 he was cited in the chancery court for continuing to preach unofficially, as the 'pretended minister' or curate at Bawtry, a village near Scrooby, in south Yorkshire. William Bradford, first governor of Plymouth, New England, recalled having enjoyed his 'illuminating ministry' in this period (Burgess, 90). Clifton did not answer the charge; he was excommunicated on 20 March, but five days later this was suspended in the hope of his appearance; on 24 April he failed to attend and the sentence was reimposed. 
By this time Clifton had formally separated from the Church of England. Although undoubtedly leader of the Scrooby group, which supplied the nucleus of the Pilgrim Fathers, he was associated by this time with John Robinson and John Smyth, the future Baptist, of nearby Gainsborough. Clifton appears to have had differences with both men, even before all three took ship for the Low Countries. On arrival in Amsterdam in August 1608, he can only have been about fifty-five, but he appeared as 'a grave and fatherly old man... having a great white beard' ('A dialogue or summe', 'Publications of the Massachusetts Colonial Society', 22, 139). In the factional disputes developing among the emigres, Clifton soon aligned himself with the separatist 'Ancient church' of Francis Johnson and Henry Ainsworth. In spring 1609, John Robinson, weary of internecine conflict, decamped to Leiden with his followers. These included most of the original Scrooby members, but not Clifton, who remained with Johnson in Amsterdam. Meanwhile, Smyth had embraced believer's baptism, and in early 1610 Clifton issued 'A Plea for Infants and Elder People' against him. In December, when Ainsworth abandoned the Ancient church, Clifton replaced him as its teacher. It seems that he was not ordained to this position, perhaps because Johnson felt that the Dutch synods would have interpreted the reimposition of hands upon him as a denial of the legitimacy of his English episcopal ordination. It was in his capacity as teacher of the church that Clifton issued 'An Advertisement Concerning a Book' (1612) against his predecessor. According to the family 'Bible', his wife, Anne, died in Amsterdam on 3 September 1613, 'aged fifty-eight'. Richard Clifton died on 20 May 1616, also at Amsterdam, 'aged sixty-three', and was buried in the South Church there. Their sons Timothy and Eleazer died in the city on 7 June 1663 and 18 January 1669 respectively.

Clifton, Robert Cox (1810-1861), Church of England clergyman, the son of Robert Cox Clifton, a clergyman who was many years British chaplain at Bruges, was born at Gloucester on 4 January 1810. The earlier part of his education was received under his father's care at Worcester, and in 1827 he went to Oxford, where he matriculated at Worcester College. He proceeded BA in 1831 and MA in 1834, and was ordained in 1833 by the bishop of Oxford. In 1833 he was elected fellow of his college. Before taking his first curacy, which was in Berkshire, he spent some time in Oxford as a tutor. 
In 1837 Clifton was appointed to the office of clerk in orders at the Manchester collegiate church, and on 6 December 1843 was elected to a fellowship by the collegiate chapter. When the church was made a cathedral, he became a canon there. In 1843 he became rural dean and rector of Somerton in Oxfordshire, which benefice he held, with his Manchester preferment, until his death. 
Clifton took a very active part in the administration of public charities and religious societies in Manchester, and was a trustee of Owens College. Clifton was an admirable man of business and an influential and useful member of the cathedral chapter. He was active in the division of the parish of Manchester in 1850 and published a pamphlet on it. He also published several occasional sermons and other pamphlets, including 'A Letter to the Rev. Dr Hook on the Subject of National Education' (1846). He died at his rectory at Somerton on 30 July 1861, his wife, Charlotte Hornsby Clifton, surviving him.

Cline, Henry (1750-1827), surgeon, born in London, was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London. His sister, Frances, was the mother of the surgeon Joseph Henry Green (1791-1863). At the age of seventeen Cline was apprenticed to Thomas Smith, one of the surgeons to St Thomas's Hospital, London, and during his apprenticeship he frequently lectured for Joseph Else, then lecturer on anatomy. On 2 June 1774 Cline obtained his diploma from Surgeons' Hall. In the same year he attended a course of John Hunter's lectures, and as a result became a strong supporter of Hunter. In 1775 Cline took a house in Devonshire Street, and married a Miss Webb, lecturing on the day of his marriage. They had at least one son and one daughter. When Else died in 1781, Cline bought his preparations from his executors, and was appointed to lecture on anatomy. Three years later, on the death of his old master, Smith, Cline succeeded him as a surgeon to St Thomas's. 
According to Astley Cooper, who became his pupil in 1784, Cline was 'in surgery cool, safe, judicious, and cautious; in anatomy sufficiently informed for teaching and practice' (Cooper, 1.98). Despite such ability, Cooper considered that Cline liked 'other things better than the study or practice of his profession' (ibid.). A democrat at a time when the term was synonymous with 'subversive', Cline was a friend of Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, visiting the former when he was confined in the Tower and giving evidence for the latter at his treason trial in 1794. For years afterwards Cline held an annual dinner at his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields to commemorate Horne Tooke's acquittal. Cline also used his influence to secure Astley Cooper's safety during his stay in Paris in 1792. A patriot in the true sense of the word, and a deist in religion, Cline was a man of integrity. His character, said Astley Cooper, 'was that of Washington; he would have devoted himself to what he considered to be the advantage of his country, and surrendered whatever distinction he might have attained when he had accomplished his object' (Cooper, 2.338). After living for some years in Jefferies' Square, 12 St Mary Axe, Cline moved in 1796 to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he remained for the rest of his life. 
In 1796 Cline was elected a member of the court of assistants of the Surgeons' Company; but the fact that his election took place at a meeting when neither of the two governors was present (one having just died) was found to have contravened the act of incorporation. 
In 1808 Cline, having become interested in agriculture, bought some land at Bounds Green in Middlesex. This venture, together with his interest in politics, lost him the chance to increase his income. Although Cline earned about $10,000 in 1810, Astley Cooper considered that it could have been far more, had he devoted himself to cultivating his practice. In 1810 Cline became an examiner at the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1812 resigned his appointments at St Thomas's, to be succeeded as surgeon by his son Henry (died 1820). In 1815 he became master of the College of Surgeons, and in the following year delivered the Hunterian oration (never published); he gave the oration again in 1824. In 1823 Cline was president of the college, the title having been changed from that of master in 1821. He died at his home at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 2 January 1827, a short time after catching an ague. His only publication was 'On the Form of Animals' (1805).

Clint, Alfred (1807-1883), marine painter, was the fifth and youngest son of George Clint ARA (1770-1854), painter and engraver, and his first wife. He was born in Alfred Place, Bedford Square, London, on 22 March 1807. A pupil of his father, Clint also studied from life with a society of students meeting first in Drury Lane and later at the Savoy. He was also at one time a member of the Clipstone Street Artists' Society, a sketching club. Ottley states that Clint initially painted portraits, as did his father, but that an unstated health problem compelled him to take up landscape painting, in which he was self-taught. 
Clint exhibited for the first time in 1828 at both the Society of British Artists' galleries in Suffolk Street, London, and the British Institution. In the following year his 'Study from Nature' was accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy. By the close of his career he had exhibited in excess of 400 landscapes and coastal views at these three institutions and others, by far the majority having been shown at Suffolk Street. Clint proved a capable administrator: he was elected a member of the Society of British Artists in 1843 and for some years held the office of secretary. He succeeded Frederick Yeates Hurlstone as president in 1869 and on retiring in 1881 was made honorary president. With others, he instigated both the Artists' Amicable Fund and the short-lived Institute of Fine Arts. 
Clint is now best-known as a marine painter, especially of views taken on the south coast of England and the Channel Islands. He also painted views of the British countryside, accompanying the actor George John Bennett on the second of his Welsh journeys, and contributed twenty etchings to Bennett's 'The Pedestrian's Guide through North Wales', published in 1838. Paintings bearing Welsh titles were exhibited at Suffolk Street and the Royal Academy in 1839 and 1840. His 'Hampstead from the South-East' ('c'.1852-3) is in the Tate collection, and 'Morning: London from Highgate' of 1841 is in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. These two London scenes are quiet and contemplative in mood, but frequently the groups of figures included by Clint animate the landscapes, while shipping and rough seas enliven the coastal views. In 1855 Clint wrote 'Landscape from Nature', being the second part of John Samuelson Templeton's 'The Guide to Oil Painting' in a series published by George Rowney & Co., suppliers of artists' materials. 
For the last five years of his life Clint was forced to give up painting owing to failing eyesight. He died at his home, 54 Lancaster Road, Westbourne Park, London, on 22 March 1883, his seventy-sixth birthday. He was buried in the same grave as his father in Kensal Green cemetery and his remaining works were sold by Christies in February 1884.

Clint, George (1770-1854), theatrical genre painter and engraver, was born in London at Brownlow Street, Holborn, on 12 April 1770, the son of Michael Clint, a hairdresser in Lombard Street, and his first wife. The family came from Hexham in Northumberland. Clint received a simple education in Yorkshire. He had several false starts before taking up painting, first as a fishmonger's apprentice, then in an attorney's office, and finally as a house-painter. During this period he married his first wife, the daughter of a small farmer in Berkshire, with whom he had five sons and four daughters. Clint began as a miniature painter with a painting room in Leadenhall Street, London. From Edward Bell, the nephew of John Bell the publisher, a mezzotint engraver best-known for his plates after George Morland, Clint learned the technique of mezzotint engraving that he practised throughout his career. Among his early engravings are 'The Frightened Horse' after George Stubbs, and 'The Death of Nelson' after W. Drummond. The precise date when Clint embarked on an artistic career is uncertain, but from the path of his development and the date of his first oil painting exhibited at the Royal Academy (1802) it can probably be assigned to the mid-1790s. From his wife's approach to Sir William Beechey for an opinion on his first attempt at oil painting, a portrait of his wife, a lasting friendship grew between Clint and Beechey. At about this time Clint's friend Samuel Reynolds, the mezzotint engraver, advised him to take up watercolour portraiture. Clint eked out his income by painting copies of prints after Morland and David Teniers, and many copies of 'The Enraged Bull' and 'The Horse Struck by Lightning' by Stubbs. Sir Thomas Lawrence was impressed by Clint's engraving skills and gave Clint several of his portraits to engrave. A misunderstanding over the engraving of Lawrence's portrait of Lord Ellenborough which Clint believed had been promised to him but which Lawrence disposed elsewhere led to a rupture in their relationship that damaged Clint's engraving practice. 
A significant event in Clint's career was his engraving of G. H. Harlow's theatrical painting 'The Trial Scene from 'Henry VIII'' with portraits of the Kemble family, published in January 1819. Harlow's picture was an attempt to raise the status of theatrical genre painting to that enjoyed by history painting. Clint's engraving of this work established his reputation for treating theatrical subjects. Clint practised as a portrait painter throughout his career, but is chiefly remembered for his theatrical scene paintings. He also painted numerous theatrical portraits. His principal patrons were Lord Egremont and the celebrated actor Charles Mathews the elder. Between 1802 and 1817 the Royal Academy catalogues show that he frequently changed his studio address (all in London), suggesting that his commissions during this period were haphazard and uncertain. From 1817 he remained for over twenty years at 83 Gower Street, London. Throughout the 1820s he exhibited at the Royal Academy a number of theatrical scenes with portraiture from a scene in 'The Clandestine Marriage' (1819) to a scene from 'Love, Law and Physic' (1830; both Garrick Club, London). The most ambitious of these works is his large painting of Edmund Kean in 'A New Way to Pay Old Debts' (1820; Garrick Club), which approaches the scale of a history painting, but he did nothing else in the same vein. His works of this period generally derive from ephemeral comedies and farce. Clint was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1821 presumably on the strength of his scene from 'Lock and Key' (Garrick Club), exhibited in the same year. 
In the 1830s Clint's theatrical scenes changed to subjects from Shakespearian comedy painted without portraiture and so distanced from the working stage. Typical of those scenes are the three works painted for Lord Egremont exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1833: 'The Carousing Scene' and 'The Duelling Scene' from 'Twelfth Night', and 'Falstaff Relating his Gadshill Adventure' from '1 Henry IV' (Petworth House, Sussex). This change of style was not to a purely literary representation of dramatic subjects since the spatial and compositional restrictions of the stage remained. Clint was a painter of the comic. His only scene from tragedy was from the working stage: 'Mr. Young in 'Hamlet'' (V&A), shown at the Royal Academy in 1831. In his colouring Clint was influenced by the work of seventeenth-century Netherlandish masters, including Van Dyck. The largest collection of Clint's theatrical works is in the Garrick Club, London, which owns six of his scene paintings and ten theatrical portraits. 
Full membership of the Royal Academy was an important goal for Clint. His failure to achieve this led to his resignation from the academy in 1836. In that year he gave evidence hostile to the Royal Academy to the House of Commons select committee on arts and manufactures. He seems to have had a difficult temperament. While he was not directly involved in current debates on the direction and content of the visual and dramatic arts, Clint's work stands at the intersection of painting and the theatre and is emblematic of those debates. 
The poverty Clint knew for most of his life was eased by some property that came to him with his second wife, which helped to augment his income from painting and engraving. He retired to 1 Albert Cottages, Montpellier Road, Peckham, Surrey, and moved near the end of his life to 32 Pembroke Square, Kensington, where he died, a widower, on 16 May 1854. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. Clint had a pupil, (Robert) William Buss, who was the author of his obituary in the 'Art Journal' (July 1854). Of his sons, Scipio Clint (1805-1839) became a medallist, and Alfred Clint (1807-1883) became a marine painter.

Clint, Scipio (1805-1839), medallist and sculptor, was one of the nine children of the portrait painter and engraver, George Clint ARA (1770-1854). He was awarded a gold medal at the Society of Arts in 1824 and 1826. On 20 August 1828 he married at St Clement Danes, Westminster, Ann Randall Anderson, with whom he had four children. He was appointed medallist to William IV in 1831 and seal engraver to Queen Victoria in 1838.

Clinton, Charles (1690-1773), surveyor and landowner, was born in Corbay, co. Longford, the grandson of an officer of Charles I's army who had settled in Ireland. He married Elizabeth Denniston (died in or after 1773), who was of Scots-Irish descent, some time before the family left for America in May 1729. The couple had seven children, three of whom were born in Ireland; two died during the voyage to America. The family's decision to leave Ireland was prompted by the religious intolerance of the dominant Anglican landowners toward their Presbyterian faith. In 1729 Clinton leased his land to Lord Granard and chartered a ship, the 'George and Anne', to carry four hundred relatives and friends to Philadelphia. Clinton landed at Cape Cod in early October after a passage that saw ninety deaths from a measles epidemic. Clinton's diary record of the crossing was published in the fourth volume of 'Olde Ulster' (1905-14). 
In the spring of 1731 Clinton moved to Ulster county, New York, where he purchased land at Little Britain, about 8 miles from the Hudson River. An educated man who was learned in mathematics and literature, Clinton was employed by the New York surveyor-general, Cadwallader Colden, to assist in his survey of the province. Colden later recommended Clinton to a distant relation, Governor George Clinton, who in turn nurtured the early career of Clinton's youngest son, George Clinton (1739-1812). 
On 24 March 1758 Charles Clinton was appointed lieutenant-colonel of James De Lancey's force, and he served in the Anglo-American expedition against Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario in August that year. In 1769 he became first judge of the Ulster county court of common pleas, an appointment he held until his death in Little Britain on 19 November 1773. Of his surviving children, James (1736-1812) served as a revolutionary military officer and was the father of De Witt Clinton (1769-1828), later New York's mayor and state governor. George Clinton became governor of New York and was vice-president of the United States between 1804 and his death in 1812.

Clinton, Charles John Fynes (1799-1872), Church of England clergyman, born on 16 April 1799, was the third son of the Revd Charles Fynes, later Fynes Clinton (1747?-1827), prebendary of Westminster, and his wife, Emma, 'nee' Brough (died 1831); Henry Fynes Clinton, the chronologist, was his brother. He was educated at Westminster School and at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1821. He was ordained priest in 1824, and was appointed vicar of Orston in 1827 and rector of Cromwell in 1828; both were in Nottinghamshire, the livings being owned by his relative, the duke of Newcastle. He held Orston until 1855 and Cromwell until his death. In 1842 he published 'Twenty-One Plain Doctrinal and Practical Sermons' (which suggest an evangelical turn of mind) and in 1853 edited and completed for publication 'An Epitome of the Civil and Literary Chronology of Rome and Constantinople', which had been left unfinished by his brother Henry. In 1854 he edited and published the 'Literary Remains' of his brother. He married, first, in 1826, Caroline, 'nee' Clay (died 1827), and second, in May 1829, Rosabella, 'nee' Matthews (died 1871). His second marriage produced seven sons. He died at 3 Montague Place, Russell Square, London, on 10 January 1872, three weeks after his second wife.
