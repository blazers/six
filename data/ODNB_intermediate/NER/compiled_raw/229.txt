Plumpton family (per. c.1165-c.1550), gentry, of Plumpton near Knaresborough in the West Riding of Yorkshire, receive their first historical notice in the mid-1160s when Sir Nigel of Plumpton (fl. c.1165) is mentioned as holder of a knight's fee of the Percy barony of Spofforth. Peter of Plumpton (fl. 1215), and heir, backed the baronial opposition to King John in the early thirteenth century and, as a result, was deprived of his estates: only following the king's death, when he swore fealty to Henry III, was his inheritance restored. Thereafter little is heard of the family until, in 1331, Sir William [i] Plumpton (d. 1361) represented Yorkshire in parliament. Sir Robert [i] Plumpton (1341-1407), Sir William's son and heir, campaigned in both France and Scotland in the later fourteenth century, and certainly made a prestigious match when he secured the hand of Isabel, daughter of Henry Scrope, first Baron Scrope of Masham, and sister of Richard Scrope who became archbishop of York in 1398. In the short term, however, this marriage proved a distinctly mixed blessing for the family. Sir Robert's eldest son, Sir William [ii] Plumpton (d. 1405), albeit after providing generously for the succession by producing at least nine children with his wife, Alice (died 1423), daughter of John Gisburn, a citizen, merchant, and three times mayor of York, became embroiled, partly as a consequence of the Scrope connection, in a major rebellion against the first Lancastrian king, Henry IV, in 1405. Not only was his uncle Richard Scrope a prime mover in the insurrection but so was Plumpton's probable patron Henry Percy, first earl of Northumberland, and, when the rebellion failed, both the archbishop and Sir William were executed at York in June 1405. Plumpton's head was placed on the city's Micklegate as a dire warning against future acts of treason. Fortunately for the family, however, this proved the limit of Henry IV's vengeance. The king allowed Sir William's widow to retain the Plumpton manors of Grassington and Studley Roger, as well as goods to the value of $40 out of her late husband's estate for the maintenance of her children, and the family was spared the disastrous political, social, and financial consequences of attainder: indeed, both Sir William's father and his eldest son rapidly obtained royal pardons. By the time Sir Robert [i] Plumpton died on 19 April 1407 his son's treason had already become no more than an uncomfortable memory. 

Sir Robert [ii] Plumpton (1383-1421), eldest son and heir of Sir William [ii], secured a notably advantageous marriage (by November 1401) to Alice Foljambe, a wealthy heiress who brought with her substantial estates in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire: as a result, the Plumpton sphere of influence, hitherto largely confined to the West Riding, came also to embrace a great swathe of territory in the north midlands. A firm supporter of the Lancastrian regime and a retainer of Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland (died 1455), who was restored to royal favour by Henry V between 1414 and 1416, he established a tradition of loyal service that his son and grandson were to maintain for most of the rest of the century. Percy patronage probably helps to explain his appearance on several government commissions and, more importantly from his family's point of view, his appointment in April 1414 as steward of the royal honour of Knaresborough and constable of Knaresborough Castle, posts that carried not only a generous salary but also the potential for greatly enhancing his prestige and power in the local community. Sir Robert's eminence in his home county is reflected in his return to parliament by the electors of Yorkshire in 1411 and 1416, while his new status as a prominent midlands landowner is underlined by his representation of Nottinghamshire in the Leicester parliament of 1414. Like so many knights he also joined Henry V's French campaigns. Retained for life at a fee of 20 marks per annum in October 1415 to serve the king's brother John, duke of Bedford, in peace and war, he left Southampton in April 1418 in a force commanded by Henry, Lord Fitzhugh, to take part in Henry V's conquest of Normandy; moreover, although he returned to England in 1419, he once more set sail for France in October 1420 with a retinue of eight archers, and died on 8 December 1421, probably at the siege of Meaux. 
Sir Robert [ii] Plumpton's eldest son and heir, Sir William Plumpton (1404-1480), similarly served the crown in both France and England: indeed, his loyalty to the house of Lancaster, no doubt reflecting the political affiliations of his Percy patrons, caused him great trouble once Edward IV had secured the throne in 1461. Like his father he grasped every opportunity to enhance his family's social status and local influence, not least by a ruthless exploitation of the marriage market. Just as he himself had been married at an early age, to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Brian Stapleton (died 1464), in order to establish a beneficial alliance between the Plumptons and their prosperous near neighbours the Stapletons of Carlton, so he treated his own children in a fashion cavalier even by fifteenth-century standards. From his first marriage he had two sons, Robert [iii] and William [iii], both of whom predeceased him and who married, successively, Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Clifford, eighth Baron Clifford of Westmorland (d. 1455). The daughters of this first, Stapleton, marriage were married into prominent local families, including the Roos of Ingmanthorpe, the Middletons of Kirkby Overblow, the Beckwiths of Clint, the Goldsboroughs, the Hamertons, and the Darells of Sessay. His only surviving son, from his second marriage, to Joan Wintringham of Knaresborough, married into the Gascoignes of Gawthorpe. 
Despite the catastrophic results of these devious manoeuvrings in the marital stakes, which led to years of litigation and substantial losses of land, this surviving son, Sir Robert Plumpton (1453-1525) ['see under 'Plumpton, Sir William (1404-1480)], entertained similar ambitions respecting his own children. Perhaps, too, such family priorities help to explain why no later medieval Plumptons became monks or nuns, or joined the ranks of the friars, and only two enjoyed careers as secular clerics. Sir Robert [ii]'s brother George became rector of Grasmere, Westmorland, in 1439 and of Bingham, Nottinghamshire, in 1447, and retired to Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire, 'c'.1451, where he was still living in 1459; and Richard Plumpton, nephew of Sir William (died 1480), became a chaplain and was probably still alive in 1519. Religious bequests, including the foundation of chantries at Ripon (in 1345) and Spofforth (in 1450), suggest that spiritual considerations were by no means absent from their minds, but it was only in the sixteenth century, when the family estates had been much depleted as a result of the failure of Sir Robert Plumpton (died 1525) and his son William [iv] Plumpton (1485-1547) to resist rival claims to their inheritance, that religion came to the fore: in the 1530s William's son, Robert [iv] Plumpton (1516-1546), became a convert to protestantism, and in Elizabeth I's reign, ironically, the Plumptons became renowned in northern England for their unswerving loyalty to Roman Catholicism. By then, however, the family's political, economic, and social position had long since passed its fifteenth-century heyday. 
Thanks to the survival of the Plumpton correspondence, a collection of about 250 family letters ranging in date from 1461 to 1552, and the coucher book, a cartulary of almost a thousand charters, deeds, and miscellaneous records (the earliest dating from the twelfth century), the Plumptons are the best-documented of all later medieval Yorkshire gentry families. Both letters and papers probably owe their survival, in the first instance, to the prolonged and acrimonious wrangles between the heirs of Sir William Plumpton (1404-1480) for possession of his inheritance and, thereafter, to their transcription in the early seventeenth century ['see also 'Babthorpe family (per. c.1501-1635)]. By the time that Thomas Stapleton (1805-1849) began work on the archive in the early nineteenth century, the originals had vanished. Nevertheless Stapleton, using the seventeenth-century transcripts, was able to publish a scholarly edition of the letters for the Camden Society in 1839 and, in a long introduction, to include many items from the coucher book as well. A new edition was published by the Camden Society in 1996. 
The letters and papers make possible unusually full portrayals of Sir William Plumpton (died 1480) and his son, Sir Robert Plumpton (died 1525), and reveal the dynamics of gentry relationships at the time, especially evident in the litigiousness provoked by Sir William's eccentric marriage policy. Several of his legal advisers figure in the correspondence: during the 1460s Brian Roucliffe (died 1494), baron of the exchequer, served Sir William in this capacity, and in the 1460s and 1470s also Godfrey Green, who was notably active in conducting legal suits and reporting on their progress. Edward Plumpton (a trained lawyer and possibly a nephew of Sir William), John Pullan, and George Emerson frequently acted in a similar vein for Sir Robert.

Noel, John Baptist Lucius (1890-1989), mountaineer and photographer, was born on 26 February 1890 at Newton Abbot, Devon, the third and youngest son of Colonel the Hon. Edward Noel (1852-1917) and his wife, Ruth Lucas (died 1926), daughter of W. H. Lucas of Treniffle, Cornwall. He was baptized Baptist Lucius and added the name John by deed poll in 1908. His father, the younger son of the second earl of Gainsborough, was a prominent soldier and military historian. Noel was educated at Lausanne, Switzerland, but often skipped classes to visit the mountains. His mother was an artist and encouraged him to study painting in Florence. His father's influence prevailed and he attended Sandhurst, though he passed into the regular army, not the Indian army, to his father's disappointment. In 1909 he was commissioned as second lieutenant, and applied to join the East Yorkshire regiment since it was stationed in northern India. 
Noel's regiment spent summers in the hills of the Himalayas and he spent his leave plotting routes through the forests of Sikkim towards Tibet. After being promoted lieutenant in 1912, he took his leave in 1913 and travelled in disguise and without permission across an unguarded pass into Tibet with three Himalayan guides. Tibetan authorities forced Noel to turn back when he got within 40 miles of Mount Everest, 'nearer at that time than any white man had been' (Noel, 62). When war started in 1914, Noel was on leave in Britain and joined the King's Own Yorkshire light infantry, as his own regiment was still in India. During the retreat from Mons he was taken prisoner by the Germans. He escaped and made his way through enemy lines, travelling at night by the stars. He rejoined his regiment at Ypres and was promoted captain in 1915, the year of his marriage to Sybil Graham (died 1939), an actress whom he had met in Kashmir. He was decorated with the 1914-15 star, the British war medal, and a victory medal. In 1917 he became an instructor in the machine-gun corps and was temporary major from 1918 to 1920. From 1920 he served as revolver instructor at the small arms school at Hythe, Kent, and wrote several pamphlets on revolvers and automatic pistols, as well as publishing, jointly with his wife, a collection of cooking recipes for soldiers. 
In 1919 Noel gave a lecture on his pre-war travels in Tibet at the Royal Geographical Society. Sir Francis Younghusband orchestrated the press coverage of Noel's paper to generate interest in a British expedition to climb Everest, an effort that bore fruit in 1921, when Tibet gave permission for the ascent. Noel joined the second Everest expedition in 1922 as photographer and film-maker. He had been interested in cinematography since the age of fourteen, when he saw Herbert Ponting's Antarctic film sixteen times. After the war, when he was stationed in northern Persia guarding oilfields, he made a short film about the caviar industry on the Caspian Sea. Since the army would not grant him leave for Everest in 1922, Noel retired and was granted the rank of major. 
Noel's silent film 'Climbing Mt. Everest' (1922) combines elements of adventure film and ethnographic travelogue. Extended sequences depict the manners and customs of Tibet, 'devil dances' at the Rongbuk monastery at the foot of Everest, as well as the ascent of the mountain. Noel's technical achievements -- filming with a Newman Sinclair camera at 23,000 feet and developing film under harsh conditions in a tent at 16,000 feet -- were overshadowed by the expedition's failure to reach the summit. 
In 1924 Noel formed Explorer Films Ltd, with Younghusband as chairman, and paid $8000 for the film and photographic rights to Everest. He posted letters from Tibet with his own Everest stamp, and sent his film to Darjeeling for developing by Arthur Pereira, who in turn sent extracts to Pathe news. Noel also made innovative use of telephoto lenses and time-lapse film techniques. His silent film 'The Epic of Everest' (1924) contrasted the masculine climbers with the mystical Tibetans, and suggested that spiritual forces on Mount Everest might be responsible for the disappearance of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. Noel exhibited his film in London with dances by a group of monks from the Tibetan Buddhist monastery at Gyantse. Officials in Tibet, Sikkim, and Bhutan were offended by certain scenes in the film and by the performances of the monks, who had not been given permission to leave Tibet. The Dalai Lama saw pictures of the monks in newspapers and said he considered 'the whole affair as a direct affront to the religion of which he is the head' (Hansen, 737). The controversy over the 'dancing lamas' led to the cancellation of future Everest expeditions and a chill in Anglo-Tibetan relations, and Noel became 'persona non grata' among British diplomats, geographers, and mountaineers for almost thirty years. 
Noel's American lecture tour without the monks enjoyed great success, as did the American edition of his book 'Through Tibet to Everest' (1927; repr., 1931, 1989), which was not as well promoted in Britain. His wife also published 'Magic Bird of Chomolungma' (1931), about Tibetan folk-tales she had collected in Tibet in 1924. British diplomats curtly rebuffed Noel's attempts to organize Himalayan expeditions in the 1930s. He filled out an application to become a naturalized American citizen, but the paperwork was misplaced. 
Noel was Roman Catholic, and one of his uncles was private secretary to several popes. Pope Pius XI, who was also a climber, sent his blessings to Noel's Everest endeavours and invited him to the canonization of St Bernadette at St Peter's in Rome in 1933. Noel surreptitiously shot the only photographs of the ceremony, with a camera disguised as a prayer book. He occasionally lectured on St Bernadette's story, and his photographs of the canonization were later given to the Society of Our Lady of Lourdes. 
After his first wife died in 1939, Noel married Mary Sullivan (died 1984), daughter of John Sullivan, clerk, on 17 November 1941 at the church of the Immaculate Conception, Barnstaple, Devon. They had one daughter, Sandra, in 1943. During 1941-3 he joined the intelligence corps and was restored to the rank of captain. He worked out the best supply-route from India to Burma, and it was briefly known as the Noel Road before being renamed the Stilwell Road. In 1944 he moved to Smarden, Kent, and restored several old homes. 
After the first ascent of Everest in 1953, Noel began to give mountaineering lectures again with his films and hand-coloured photographs. Younger climbers and film-makers often visited him at Romney Marsh, Kent, to hear his eyewitness account of the disappearance of Mallory and Irvine, and he became something of an elderly sage from the 1960s to the 1980s. Footage from his Everest films appeared in many subsequent mountaineering films and television programmes. Noel's version of events also strongly influenced histories of the Everest expeditions written during this period. 
Noel stood 6 feet 2 inches in his prime, and was known for his showmanship, mischievous humour, and an imperious demeanour that mellowed with age into an Edwardian charm. He died of pneumonia and great old age on 12 March 1989 at Ashford Nursing Home, 407 Hythe Road, Ashford, Kent. He was cremated at Charing and a memorial service was held on 24 April at St Mary's, Cadogan Street, London. No diaries or papers survived, but his films and photographs remain a vivid and lasting legacy.

Angus, Marion Emily (1865-1946), poet, was born on 27 March 1865 at 23 Park Place West, Sunderland, the third of six children of the Revd Henry Angus (1833-1902) and Mary Jessie Watson. While her father's family background was mainly clerical, Marion Angus's maternal grandfather was a notable social reformer: William Watson, sheriff-substitute of Aberdeen from 1829 to 1866, who founded in that city in 1841 the first industrial school for street children. The first published work by Marion Angus was an affectionate memoir of her grandfather entitled 'Sheriff Watson of Aberdeen: the Story of his Life and his Work for the Young' (1913) which, as well as offering a vivid portrait of the humane and energetic sheriff, illuminates many aspects of the social history of his period of office. Henry Angus graduated AM from Marischal College in 1852, attended the United Presbyterian College, Edinburgh, and was ordained in Union Chapel, Sunderland, on 2 March 1859. Minister of Trinity Church, Sunderland, for seventeen years, he accepted a call to Erskine United Free Church, Arbroath, in 1876 and moved back to north-east Scotland with his family. He retired from the ministry in 1900 and died in 1902. His invalid widow moved to Inchgowan, Cults, on the outskirts of Aberdeen, where Marion and her sister Ethel ran a private school. The Cults house was given up at the beginning of the First World War. Ethel joined a Voluntary Aid Detachment and was injured in an air raid on the base hospital at Calais where she was working, while Marion worked in the canteen at Stobbs camp. Her nephew records that 'She was much exhausted by this work, with its long hours and hard conditions, but she spoke after it with the greatest respect and admiration for the ordinary private soldiers, and their simple good sense and kindliness' (W. S. Angus to Nan Shepherd, 7 Nov 1968; in Aberdeen University MS 2737). 
Marion and Ethel lived briefly in Peebles after the war, but disliked the town, and Marion moved back to the north-east in 1921, buying Zoar, Springfield Road, Aberdeen. It was in the 1920s that Marion began to publish the poems which established her as one of the group of vernacular poets who were forerunners of the 'Scottish Renaissance' of the inter-war years. Her Scots verse, along with that of Violet Jacob and Lewis Spence, marked a break with the exhausted post-Burns tradition, and anticipated the work of C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid). She did not start to write poetry until after 1918 and her first volume of poems, 'The Lilt', was published in 1922, the year Grieve's first experiments in Scots appeared in the 'Dunfermline Press'. Five more volumes of poetry followed: 'The Tinker's Road and other Verses' (1924), 'Sun and Candlelight' (1927), 'The Singin' Lass' (1929), 'The Turn of Day' (1931), and 'Lost Country and other Verses' (1937). The association with Grieve, and the cultural initiatives he promoted so energetically in the 1920s and 1930s, stemmed from Grieve's inclusion of her work in his 'Scottish Chapbook' and 'Northern Numbers' and from the qualified approval he accorded her poetry in his polemical articles on contemporary cultural life in the 'Scottish Literary Journal' in 1925 and 1926. In addition, three of her six volumes of verse -- 'Sun and Candlelight', 'The Singin' Lass', and 'The Turn of Day' -- were published by Porpoise Press, founded by George Malcolm Thomson and Roderick Watson Kerr in 1922, and very much an expression of the new cultural climate in Scotland. She also contributed to the new medium of radio. 
Ethel fell seriously ill in the late twenties, and spent the remainder of her life in hospital in Glasgow. Until her sister's death in 1936 Marion lived with relatives or in rooms to be within reach of her. The Aberdeen house was sold, but Marion Angus maintained her connection with her beloved north-east, spending her summers on Deeside. In 1945, too frail to live on her own, she returned to Arbroath to Hayshead House, where an old friend was housekeeper. Marion Angus died there on 18 August 1946; she was cremated at Aberdeen and her ashes scattered on Elliot Links, Arbroath. 'Selected Poems', edited by Maurice Lindsay and with a memoir by her friend Helen Cruickshank, appeared in 1950. 
Helen Cruickshank notes in her memoir that Marion Angus did not have a high opinion of Grieve as a poet, and that she disapproved of his experiments in 'synthetic' Scots. However, like Grieve and the other 'Renaissance' poets, she went back beyond Burns and found inspiration in earlier Scottish traditions -- most notably in ballad and folk-song. In poems like 'The Seaward Toon' and 'In the Streets Thereof', she synthesizes elements of the folk tradition with powerfully suggestive religious images to convey kinds of experience beyond the rational and explicable. Both poems warn against a defensive and prudential attitude that cuts the individual off from the fuller life of the sense and imagination. Marion Angus is a poet of the social and psychological margins: her poems hint and suggest rather than state, often conveying repressed or unreturned feelings and liminal states; her characters are often the outcast and rejected. Women's experience is at the centre of her work, and it offers a welcome contrast to the mainly male-dominated poetry of the 'Renaissance' movement. Her chief quality as a poet has been best summed up by Nan Shepherd: 'We know that this is our country and these are our people, but we did not know they were quite like this' (Nan Shepherd, 'Marion Angus as poet of Deeside', 'Deeside Field', 2nd ser., 6, 1970, 8-16).

Shepherd, Anna (1893-1981), author and college teacher, was born on 11 February 1893 at Westerton Cottage, East Peterculter, near Aberdeen, the second child of John Shepherd, a civil engineer, and Jane Smith Shepherd ('nee' Kelly). Her paternal grandparents were farmers from Strachan and Drum; her mother's father was a well-known tailor in the city of Aberdeen, and her mother's uncle was the renowned local architect Dr William Kelly. Nan Shepherd had one elder brother, Frank, who became a civil engineer like his father, and died in South Africa, where he had gone to recuperate after serving in the First World War. 
'I have had the same bedroom all my life', Shepherd once said. She lived in a house called Dunvegan, 503 North Deeside Road, in the village of Cults, 3 miles from Aberdeen; her family moved there a month after her birth. She attended Cults primary school (and went back in her eighties to tell enthralled pupils what it was like to be taught there at the turn of the century), then she proceeded to Aberdeen High School for Girls, then studied at the University of Aberdeen, graduating MA in 1915. Upon graduating she joined the staff of Aberdeen Training Centre for Teachers (later Aberdeen College of Education), becoming lecturer in English in 1919. She taught there until she retired in 1956, after which she edited the 'Aberdeen University Review' from 1957 to 1963, writing essays on subjects such as Hugh MacDiarmid, the poet Charles Murray, and women in the university from 1892 to 1942. In 1964 the University of Aberdeen awarded her an honorary doctorate. 
In 1928, when Shepherd was thirty-five, she published her first novel. 'The Quarry Wood', a novel which honours in its descriptions the university she loved so much, is the story of the emotional and intellectual education of its young heroine, Martha Ironside, who fights for the money and space for a school and university education, then comes to understand that the learning process involves the world beyond books too, a world of 'sharny boots and hacked hands seamed with dirt', that ideals are best tempered with reality, and that nature is a pretty good partner for intellect. Shepherd's next novel was 'The Weatherhouse', published in 1930, and her third and final novel, 'A Pass in the Grampians', was published in 1933. Both of these, like 'The Quarry Wood', deal with the clash between tradition and modernity, and are set lovingly in small communities in the north-east of Scotland, full of the rich, harsh speech of its people and the bleakness and the splendour of its mountains and weather. As Roderick Watson puts it: 'Nan Shepherd manages to invest the dourness of the Scottish land... with imagination and grace' (Watson, 'Introduction', 'The Weatherhouse'). All three novels deal with the getting of wisdom and the challenging of convention; each one has its own lively, clever young woman trying to sort out self-knowledge from self-deception; each has a democratic layered narrative that builds up a picture not just of the individual but of the workings of community and communal responsibility; and each one has, in its tenacious narrator, the promise of a tolerant, humorous, intelligent, and ever open mind. 
Shepherd's love for her native Aberdeenshire and the nearby Grampians is displayed throughout her work. She was an avid hill-walker and climber, and this is celebrated in her final two books. As a student she had published several poems in the student magazine, 'Alma Mater', which she also edited, but it was not until 1934 that she published 'In the Cairngorms', her slim volume of poems. Almost all of her poetry, from her early work to late unpublished pieces now in her archive at the National Library of Scotland, hymns the combination of nature and intellect, and 'In the Cairngorms' is like the novels in its sense of 'the mind's own fineness' passionately engaged with the vastness, beauty, and ultimate indifference of rock, water, light, and air. The collection ends on a series of bruised and oblique love sonnets; 'very few people understand them,' she said once, 'which makes me feel better'. 
Shepherd's final book, 'The Living Mountain', a series of meditations on the Cairngorm Mountains, was written in the 1940s and, after one publisher's 'courteous and negative' refusal, left unpublished in a drawer until 1977. 'It was written during the latter years of the Second War and those just after. In that disturbed and uncertain world it was my secret place of ease', she wrote in the foreword. This Zen-like 'pilgrimage to the mountain' is delightful, an enlightened fusion of philosophy and reportage on the forms and force of life everywhere in the beloved landscape: 'I can imagine the antiquity of rock, but the antiquity of a living flower -- that is harder. It means that these toughs of the mountain top, with their angelic inflorescence and the devil in their roots, have had the cunning and the effrontery to cheat, not only a winter, but an Ice Age. (Shepherd, 'The Living Mountain')' Friends and former students remember a similar and joyful tenacity of spirit in Shepherd herself, as well as her sense of humour, her spellbinding teaching talent, and a feminist approach in her lectures years ahead of her time. A fellow member of staff at the college of education remembered how 'on my first morning I found a posy from her garden on my desk. That was typically Nan'. She was, friends recall, 'a lovely woman, with masses of auburn hair, and possessed of a fine speaking voice of a rare range', 'a tall slim figure with a halo of chestnut plaits'. Photographs of the young Nan Shepherd show a face full and open, likeably stubborn, a woman with beautiful hooded eyes that are at once determined and unsure, long luxurious hair, and an almost devil-may-care penchant for an arts-and-crafts style in clothes. In photos at the end of her life, her weather-lined face has lost none of its strength, and the eyes are still that mixture of sharp, direct, and self-protective. 
Long friendships with Neil Gunn, Charles Murray, Agnes Mure Mackenzie, Willa Muir, Helena Shire, and many other writers, characterized Shepherd's life. When Lewis Grassic Gibbon died, she organized a trust fund for his bereaved wife and family; after the deaths of the poets J. C. Milne and Charles Murray she helped bring about publication of their last poems. But the most arresting story of her generosity and her bearing can be found in Jessie Kesson's warm recollection of the 'lady' Kesson fell over the feet of in a train carriage one dramatic day in 1941 when she was a milkmaid at an Aberdeenshire farm. Several weeks after the talkative train journey the lady wrote to tell her to write a story for a local competition, then offered to help, if necessary, with the entry fee of 7's'. 6died Kesson 'won the first prize of a Book Token, and learned the name of the Lady in the train', a good friend and helpful critic for the rest of her life. 'I was graced by Nan Shepherd', Kesson concludes (Kesson, 'Nan Shepherd in recollection'). 
Nan Shepherd seems to have valued her privacy highly, and was modest to the point of dismissiveness about her own fiction. In 1976 a local newspaper interviewed 'the forgotten authoress of Cults'. The journalist, caught off-balance by the old lady's intelligence, sat amazed as Shepherd, laughing, 'a twinkle in her eye', waved old reviews in the air that proclaimed her a writer of genius, saying, as if nothing could matter less, 'that's what you call a passing reputation'. She 'didn't really like writing', she said; and only wrote when she felt there was 'something which simply had to be written'. Then one day 'it just didn't come to me any more'. She once told Neil Gunn that she really wasn't a 'literary person': 'there's a great big bit of me detached and amused, and quite often cynical, that weighs the wind of the spirit with the weights of corn and potatoes and things' (F. R. Hart and J. B. Pick, 'Neil M. Gunn: a Highland Life', 1981). The pragmatic romanticism this comment (and all her work) reveals is right at the heart of twentieth-century Scottish fiction. Her complex and remarkable novels were forgotten after their publication, and Shepherd remembered as a prescient critic of Hugh MacDiarmid and a correspondent with Neil Gunn, until the reprinting of her work in the 1980s and 1990s showed her to be a forerunner of Lewis Grassic Gibbon, a quiet pioneer of narrative structure, and one of Scotland's finest novelists of the early twentieth century. 
After years of teaching, encouraging, and tending others (her invalid mother died when Shepherd was sixty, after which she nursed their old housekeeper, Mamie Lawson, until she died in the early 1970s), Nan Shepherd became ill in her late eighties and lived for some time at the nursing home Annesley House, in Torphins. She died in Aberdeen at Woodend Hospital on 27 February 1981, at the age of eighty-eight.

Kellas, Alexander Mitchell (1868-1921), chemist and mountaineer, was born on 21 June 1868 at 28 Regent Quay, Aberdeen, the son of James Fowler Kellas, secretary to the local marine board, and his wife, Mary Boyd, 'nee' Mitchell. He was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and then attended Aberdeen University, Heriot-Watt College in Edinburgh, and Heidelberg University, where he gained a PhD. He was for a period assistant to Sir William Ramsay at University College and taught chemistry to medical students at the Middlesex Hospital. Kellas was keenly interested in chemistry and even more enthusiastic for mountaineering. The two interests combined to make him pre-eminent for a time in the field of high-altitude physiology. He was able to combine research at low pressure in the laboratory with practical studies at altitude in the Himalayas. 
Kellas had a great love for wild mountain places. He was not given to technical climbing but was supremely interested in mountain geography and exploration, in the course of which he reached numerous unclimbed Himalayan summits. He began mountaineering in the Cairngorms while a student at Aberdeen University. During the next few years he came to know most of the highlands and at the same period climbed in Switzerland. 
In his late thirties Kellas made his first visit to the Himalayas. He made six expeditions to Sikkim from 1907 to 1920. He did a phenomenal amount of climbing and yet very little is known about him because he was of a retiring nature and wrote so little of his remarkable, if not unique, achievements. Unusual in that he generally climbed without European companions, he was accompanied by an ever loyal group of local porters whom he trained in the basic alpine skills. He possessed phenomenal energy and tenacity: during one season in 1910 he made ten first ascents above 20,000 feet, including Sentinel Peak (21,292 feet), Pauhunri (23,375 feet), and Chomoyummo (22,400 feet). In 1909 he had twice attempted to climb Pauhunri, getting within 200 feet of the top. The summit was obviously important enough for him to return in the following year in order eventually to reach it. 
During the First World War, Kellas channelled all his energies into high-altitude research and the effect of diminished atmospheric pressure on human physiology, a subject of great importance to the Air Ministry. Several papers were published in the 'Geographical Journal', including 'A consideration of the possibility of ascending the loftier Himalaya', which concluded that 'a man in first-rate training, acclimatized to maximum possible altitude, could make the ascent of Mount Everest without adventitious aids, provided that the physical difficulties above 25,000 feet are not prohibitive' ('Geographical Journal', 49, January 1917). Seventy years later this observation became reality, with Messner and Habeler making the first ascent of Everest without 'canned' oxygen. 
In 1919 Kellas suffered a breakdown in health from overwork, resigned his lectureship in London, and returned to Aberdeen. To the surprise of his friends he recovered the following year and set out again for the Himalayas to carry out more experiments at altitude on himself and his high-altitude porters (or 'coolies' as they were termed at the time). He reached a height of 23,622 feet on Kamet. Although he reached Mead's Col, he could not persuade his porters to pitch camp in the intense cold. After several months in the Garhwal he travelled over to Sikkim, where in November 1920 he climbed north of the Kang La to obtain photographs of the peaks north of Everest that were then unknown. 
Amazingly Kellas returned to the Kang La region in April 1921 and climbed a higher peak to see more of Everest's north side. He then climbed Narsingh (19,110 feet) before turning his attention to working out a way through the icefall on Kabru. He had time to reach only 21,000 feet. He returned to Darjeeling just one week before he was to join the first expedition to Mount Everest, led by Charles Kenneth Howard-Bury. 
Kellas was chosen to be a member of the climbing team of four. This may seem surprising considering he was fifty-three. The Everest committee had few reservations, despite his age, because he had far more experience of high-altitude climbing than any contemporary. No other climber had such a grasp of the mysteries of the effects of rarefied air upon humans. He had alone built up a good rapport with the Sherpa Bhotias hill men and, by emphasizing the importance of adequate training and of treating them with respect, had shown their value to any mountaineering enterprise. 
After only a week of rest from his attempts to see more of the Everest region and his prolonged work on Kabru, Kellas had no time to recuperate properly for the rigours of the Tibetan plateau. He went down with dysentery and had to be carried on a stretcher. Just before Kampa Dzong the accumulated strain of his spring climbing, the biting cold of the plateau, and rampant dysentery overtaxed his heart. He died, on 5 June 1921, among his faithful porters, as he had insisted his countrymen went on ahead. 'The old gentleman (such he seemed) was obliged to retire a number of times en route and could not bear to be seen in this distress' as Mallory, appalled at the situation, wrote at the time (Unsworth, 37). 
Kellas was buried on a hillside to the south of Kampa Dzong in sight of the peaks of Sikkim, where he had made so many first ascents. From the same place the summit of Everest was visible 100 miles to the west. Howard-Bury concluded, 'He lies, therefore, within sight of his greatest feats in climbing and within view of the mountains that he had longed for so many years to approach -- a fitting resting place for a great mountaineer' (Howard-Bury, 54).

Spencer, (Charles) Bernard (1909-1963), poet and broadcaster, was born on 9 November 1909 in Madras, India, the third of three children of Charles Gordon Spencer (1869-1934), a high court judge in the Indian Civil Service who was later knighted, and Edith Mary (died 1936), daughter of Colonel Hugh Pearce Pearson, of the Indian army. 
In 1911 Bernard, as he was habitually known, joined his brother, John ('b'. 1907), and sister, Cynthia ('b'. 1904), in England, where he was brought up by relatives and guardians in Hampshire and Oxfordshire. Spencer's education followed an expected course for a young man of his background. He attended Heddon Court preparatory school in Stevenage and Marlborough College (1923-7), where his contemporaries included Louis MacNeice, John Betjeman, and Anthony Blunt. Aesthete rather than athlete, he filled his spare hours at Marlborough with poetry and painting, and pursued these interests at Corpus Christi College, Oxford (1928-32), where he read classics. He contributed poems, reviews, and art criticism to 'Oxford Outlook', and in 1930 co-edited the influential annual 'Oxford Poetry' with Stephen Spender. Spencer left university with a third class in classical moderations and a second in Greats and no clear ambitions. From 1932 to 1940 he held temporary posts teaching at preparatory schools in London and the home counties, all the while continuing to publish poems in periodicals and anthologies. His pre-war reputation as a junior member of the Auden generation was secured with contributions to 'New Verse', the most important poetry magazine of the 1930s, where he also served as assistant editor under Geoffrey Grigson from 1935 to 1938. He confirmed a quiet but resolute rebellion against class expectations by marrying a repertory actress, Nora Kathleen Gibbs (1909/10-1947), on 1 August 1936. 
Spencer's first British Council appointment, in January 1940, as a lecturer at the Institute of English Studies in Salonika, changed his life and art. He discovered the major inspiration for his poetry, the Mediterranean south, the cultures and landscapes of this 'explosive, crushed-blue, nostril-opening sea' (Spencer, 19). Poems like 'Delos', 'Aegean Islands, 1940-41', and 'Greek Excavations' explore the region's ancient past, often identifying the melancholy continuities of history, as they celebrate the tactile immediacy of a living world. Greece also offered him a more cosmopolitan literary circle, with his fellow British exile Lawrence Durrell, and, in the vanguard of contemporary Greek poetry, George Seferis and Odysseus Elytis. The German invasion cut short Spencer's idyll, and he was evacuated in January 1941 to Egypt, where he spent the war years teaching at Fuad I University in Cairo. He, Durrell, and Robin Fedden edited 'Personal Landscape' from 1942 to 1945, 'one of the rare 'little' magazines that have made literary history in our time' (Lehmann, 339). The editors enshrined a distinctive poetry of exile, at once modernist and European, with the best of their own work, many of the important war poems of Keith Douglas, as well as translations of Rilke and Cavafy, and contributions from Seferis. 
In London after the Second World War, Spencer did occasional broadcasting as a presenter, reader, and scriptwriter for the BBC Third Programme and the Home Service, but the expatriate life had taken a hold, and the particular allure of the Mediterranean beckoned once again. Spencer secured an appointment with the permanent overseas service of the British Council and was posted to Palermo in September 1946, the year that his first volume of poems, 'Aegean Islands', appeared. His duties in Sicily came to an abrupt end when his wife succumbed to tuberculosis and died in Rome on 13 June 1947. After three months working at the British Institute in Turin, Spencer, now suffering from the disease himself, underwent treatment at a clinic in Leysin, Switzerland. A long convalescence delayed a new assignment until September 1949, when he was posted to the British Institute in Madrid. Spencer served there until 1955, returning in 1958 for another four years after two interludes teaching in Athens (1955-6) and Ankara (1958). He adapted well to the western end of the Mediterranean as he had before to the Aegean. With his trim figure, casual elegance, and patrician good looks, he was a popular teacher, wry, self-deprecatory, and an elegant raconteur. His reputation as good company had followed him from pre-war London to Greece to Egypt, and now to Spain. 
Spencer was never prolific, and he could be reticent about publication, but in the last five years of his life there was a new creative energy at work. His second and third volumes, 'The Twist in the Plotting' and 'With Luck Lasting', appeared in 1960 and 1963 respectively. These later poems, vivid with sensuous particulars, record both the anomie and the unexpected miracles of urban life. During his second posting to Spain he met Anne Margaret Helen Marjoribanks ('b'. 1938), an English teacher and secretary at the time of marriage, whom he married in Madrid on 29 September 1961. His final posting, in January 1962, was to Vienna. Despite the unaccustomed distance from 'the promise of the South' (Spencer, 34), it was a hopeful time. His only child, Piers Bernard, was born there in July 1963, and a collected edition was planned. What seemed like a new beginning was once again undone. In the summer of 1963 he began to suffer from blackouts and memory loss, and on 10 September, now seriously ill, he was admitted to a clinic for tests. He apparently wandered away, undetected, and was found dead the following morning on a railway line in Vienna, having been struck by a train. The nature of his illness and the exact circumstances of his death have never been established. He was cremated on 17 September in Vienna, and his ashes were returned to England, where they lie beside his parents' grave in the estate church of Wheatfield House, Wheatfield, Oxfordshire. He was survived by his wife, Anne. 
Bernard Spencer's 'Collected Poems' was published in 1965, and a substantially expanded volume appeared in 1981. Approximately 100 poems appear in the later edition, and show the continuity of his vision over thirty years and the landscapes of seven countries. Spencer's very rootlessness -- he was always the alert stranger -- offered a bracing alternative to the dictates of settled metropolitan taste. He is a poet of exact momentary observation and of the long historical view, and that apparent paradox is his great strength.

Gray, Francis James (1880-1935), politician, was born in Oxford on 31 August 1880, the only son of Alderman Sir Walter Gray and his wife, Emily Alice Savage. 
Frank Gray was educated at Rugby School and at F. B. Harvey's crammer in Woodstock before being articled as a solicitor's clerk to Dr Harry Galpin, the Oxford City solicitor, in 1898. His articles were transferred to the Hon. Robert Lyttelton in London in 1902, and after passing his final law exams he remained with Lyttelton until 1906. On returning to Oxford, he set up as a solicitor in partnership with Andrew Walsh and, with influential local contacts, soon built up a successful local practice. He achieved local celebrity in 1913-14 when he and William Richard Morris roused public opinion in a battle to bring motor buses to Oxford. On 11 July 1914 he married Eveline Reine Panton, with whom he had one daughter; the couple separated in the early 1930s. 
Gray's friendships with a chimney sweep, a bookmaker, and other dubious local characters demonstrated his unconventional nature and, despite exemption from conscription, he enlisted in the army on 13 February 1917. Refusing a commission, he served as a private until the armistice, seeing action at Passchendaele before securing a staff appointment. His wartime experiences encouraged him to stand for parliament, but he was defeated as the Liberal candidate for Watford in March 1918. He retired as a solicitor in 1919 and campaigned on behalf of farm workers before unsuccessfully trying to get a job as a miner in Warwickshire in order to expose working conditions in the pits. 
In 1920 Gray was adopted as the Liberal candidate for Oxford City and in November 1922 his populist style won him a majority of 3806 in a seat which the Conservatives had held since 1885. An active MP at Westminster, Gray nursed his constituency by holding regular surgeries and by his involvement with many local institutions. He defended the seat in November 1923 when his support for free trade led to a bitter dispute with his former friend W. R. Morris. He was re-elected with a reduced majority of 2693 and was rewarded with the post of junior whip, but he was soon found to have exceeded his election expenses. A petition was filed in February 1924 and Gray's inexperienced agent was found guilty of corrupt practices; Gray himself escaped censure but his election was declared void. He stood for parliament again at Central Portsmouth in October 1924, but was heavily defeated. He blamed the disappointing result on the effects of the Zinoviev letter. 
Freed from parliamentary commitments, Gray served on the Oxfordshire county council and Ploughley rural district council, but he found local government frustrating and concentrated his energies elsewhere. A long-term interest in tramps encouraged him to disguise himself as a vagrant and see for himself the conditions in local workhouses. After the repeal of the poor law in 1929, he established Frank Gray House in the former Bicester workhouse to help reclaim young vagrants; he also welcomed many tramps at his home in Shipton Manor, Shipton-on-Cherwell, and tried to find useful work for them. In 1926 he flirted with exploration, using two standard Jowett cars to drive across Africa from Lagos to the Red Sea. In 1928 he helped to establish the 'Oxford Mail', the city's first evening newspaper, and then threw himself into a scheme to develop a zoo, pleasure garden, and associated housing at Kidlington as a gateway to Oxford. 
Frank Gray was a smallish man who typically wore a black tie and black coat with checked trousers and a grey Homburg hat. A colourful and restless personality, he enlivened one quiet evening by racing a guest to London, ramming the other man's car when he looked like losing; in August 1923, he courted publicity by challenging a fellow MP to a walking race from Banbury to Oxford in full infantry kit. After a period of illness, Gray went to South Africa to recuperate, but had a stroke on the return journey and died at sea on 3 March 1935. His coffin was carried on a flower-bedecked fire engine from Shipton Manor and he was buried at Wolvercote cemetery, Oxford, on 6 March 1935.

Carmichael, Amy Beatrice (1867-1951), missionary, was born on 16 December 1867 in Millisle, co. Down, Ireland, the daughter of prosperous middle-class Presbyterian parents, David Carmichael (died 1885), flour miller, and his wife, Catherine Jane Filson (died 1913). She received her education from a succession of governesses, Marlborough House, Harrogate -- a Wesleyan Methodist boarding-school in Yorkshire -- and at Victoria College, Belfast. However, a financial crisis in the family business and the death of her father in April 1885 put an end to her academic prospects. 
Religion played an important part in the Carmichael family household, and from an early age Amy became involved in both spiritual and practical work in Belfast, holding prayer and 'Bible' meetings for neighbourhood children and schoolfriends. She organized classes for the mill girls of Belfast which were so successful that a new hall was built to accommodate them. The Welcome, as it became known, was a lively and innovative centre of evangelistic endeavour. In 1889 both she and her mother were invited to Manchester to work for the city mission there, but ill health brought Amy's part in this endeavour to a speedy conclusion. At this stage Robert Wilson, a Quaker and co-founder of the Keswick Convention, became a major influence in her life. It was while staying at his home in Cumberland, deeply engaged with the religious work of her host, that Amy received the 'call' to missionary work. 
Carmichael arrived in south India in 1895, via Japan and Ceylon, sustained always by the certainty of a divine purpose guiding her life, and, like so many evangelists of the period, believed that her religious mission transcended denominational labels. At first attached to the Church of England zenana mission, she later joined forces with a Church Missionary Society missionary, and, forming her own band of sisters, spent a total of seven years itinerating in the Tinnevelly district, before settling in Dohnavur, Tinnevelly district, south India, which was to be her home until the end of her life. 
A central concern of the Christian community which Carmichael established there was the fate of young girls ('devadasis'), ceremonially married to the deity in the temple, an ancient ritual which seems to have degenerated into prostitution. These girls and, from 1918, boys, who were vulnerable to exploitation, were a central focus of her mission which provided such children with a Christian home, and education and training which would equip them for adult life. The settlement gradually expanded, with outposts in the village, nurseries, schools, a hospital, and a house of prayer added as needed; within forty years the community at Dohnavur numbered more than 600. Despite growing numbers, however, the pattern of life was that of a family, not an institution, with the evangelists sharing in the practical work of teaching, doctoring, nursing, engineering, and farming. Financially too, the institutional approach was rejected; no fund-raising appeals were launched or authorized, instead 'Indian and European, men and women, live and work together... each contributing what each has for the help of all' (Carmichael, 'Gold by Moonlight', 183). 
Amy was a prolific writer, particularly after a fall in 1931 which severely restricted her movement. She published thirty-eight books in the course of her life, mostly on the work at Dohnavur. Her books, frequently reprinted and translated into many languages, were important, not only in spreading the word about the work at Dohnavur, but in inspiring and influencing later generations of young Christians. Passionately committed, and unconventional by any standards, the intensity of her faith and her frankness about the difficulties of missionary work in India often attracted the hostility of other Europeans, as did her behaviour. She adopted Indian dress, for example, and insisted that those who worked at Dohnavur would do so without expectation of a salary since no appeals for money were ever made, except through prayer. Knowledge of her work was spreading, however, and others were more appreciative of the Dohnavur initiative. In 1919 she was awarded the kaisar-i-Hind medal for services to the people of India. A greater cause for celebration was the passing of the 1947 act of the Madras state parliament which made it illegal to dedicate young girls to temple service -- a cause given wide publicity by Amy's intervention and in works such as 'Lotus Buds' (1909) and 'Things as They Are' (1903). 
In 1927 the Dohnavur Fellowship was legally established as an independent body, thus ending the loose association with the Church of England zenana mission, already diluted as workers joined from a variety of countries and backgrounds. The ethos of Amy Carmichael's mission was by then quite unique. The celebration of 'coming days' (when a new child arrived at the community), the 'meetings of vision' between Christmas and the new year, and the triumphant funeral processions clearly bear the imprint of its founder, in particular her close knowledge of the local way of life and her love of nature. An abundance of flowers, the study of birds and insects, and a great deal of singing seem to have been the hallmarks of a community deeply concerned with the happiness and well-being of children, although the founder herself always maintained a strict discipline. Perhaps the greatest testimony to her leadership, however, is the fact that the community survived both the ending of British rule in India and her own death in 1951. Continuity was ensured by adapting both the ethos and the work of Dohnavur to the India of the late twentieth century, and although the fellowship members are now all of Indian nationality, the work still continues today. Amy Carmichael died at Dohnavur on 18 January 1951, and was buried there the same day.

Seabury, Samuel (1729-1796), first bishop of the Protestant Episcopal church in the United States of America, was born on 30 November 1729 at Groton, Connecticut, the son of Samuel Seabury (1706-1764) and Abigail Mumford. His father was a missionary, under the jurisdiction of the bishop of London, working for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). The young Seabury attended Yale College (1745-8), where he studied ten subjects and subscribed to penal laws which forbade him 'to play at swords (nor) go into any tavern' (Dexter, 2.7). Having graduated BA (and later proceeded MA), he worked as a catechist before going to Edinburgh University (1752) to study medicine for one year -- regarded as a basic necessity for one proposing to become a missionary. He was examined by the SPG and ordained deacon and priest in 1753 with the hope that he would 'prove a very diligent and useful missionary' (SPG, abstract of proceedings, 1753-4, 57, Bodl. RH). 
After returning to the colonies Seabury was successively rector of New Brunswick, New Jersey, of Jamaica, of Long Island, and of Westchester, New York, where he served until 1776. On 12 October 1756 he married Mary (1736-1780), the daughter of Edward Hicks of New York, with whom he had six children. He reported regularly to the SPG in London, expressing, among other things, his concern 'that Quakerism is the seat of Infidelity' (SPG, letters, 1759, 114, Bodl. RH) and noting 'the differences encountered by the number of Deists' (ibid., 1762, 160). As a result of his experience at Westchester he pleaded for an episcopate in the colonies to confirm communicants and sustain the work of the American mission. His letters also show his awareness of colonial resentment of Britain's policy of imperial taxation, though he remained totally loyal; in 1766 -- the year of the 'Declaratory Act' -- he was one of 312 signators 'determined to support the Constitution at the hazard of lives and property' (Beardsley, 23). Seabury's convictions were put to the test when he was briefly imprisoned in 1775 by the revolutionary forces in Connecticut, following the publication of a series of pamphlets attacking patriot institutions including the continental congress. In a long letter to the SPG he reported that he had closed his church. 'There would be neither prayer nor sermon' until he could pray for George III, he wrote, while assuring the society (which paid him $50 a year) that he would not leave his mission 'so long as it was practical to stay' (SPG New York Letters B2 and 3, 29 Dec 1776, Bodl. RH). This, and subsequent letters, give a graphic account of troop movements while conceding that both revolutionaries and loyalists plundered and foraged. Seabury accepted an appointment as a chaplain to the king's forces under General William Hume and spent much of the war in New York. His loyalty and piety were rewarded with an honorary doctorate of divinity from the University of Oxford (1777). The SPG, 'sensible of his great worth' (annual report, 1777, 46), continued to pay his stipend until a change of policy as late as 1785; thereafter friends in Britain ensured him an income for the rest of his life. 
In early 1783 Seabury was invited by a group of ten Connecticut clergymen led by the Revd John Rutgers Marshall to become the first bishop of a national episcopal church in the United States. In July 1783 he travelled to England to seek consecration as their bishop. The stumbling-block, however, was the obligation to take an oath to the crown, to which Seabury, now a citizen of the United States, could not subscribe. Moreover, an Erastian church could not justify consecration without the consent of the state of Connecticut. Instead Seabury, recalling his Scottish links of thirty years earlier, approached the Scottish nonjuring bishops, the descendants of ministers who had refused to swear the oath of allegiance to William and Mary. At first they too were reluctant to grant Seabury's request until they received assurance that Britain recognized the United States. The Scottish bishops also received the implicit support of the archbishop of Canterbury, who asked that the Scottish prelates 'would not send the suppliant away empty-handed' (letter of 20 Nov 1783, Wilberforce, 205). Delays continued throughout 1784. Seabury wrote home that 'the expense of continuing another winter is greater than will suit my purse' (letter to Myles Cooper, 1 Aug 1784, Beardsley, 114), while the nonjuring Bishop John Skinner noted that he did not want it to be thought 'we always fished in troubled waters' (Beardsley, 107). It was not until 14 November that Seabury was consecrated as bishop of Connecticut in a discreet ceremony at a house in Aberdeen in the presence of three of the four Scottish bishops. 
An agreement, known as the 'Concordat', was signed acknowledging full communion between the episcopalians of Scotland and Connecticut. In particular, the new bishop -- the first protestant bishop on American soil -- agreed to recommend that the form of communion service to be followed in the United States should be closer in style and theology to the Scottish office of 1746 than to the English 'Book of Common Prayer' (1662). 'By gentle methods of argument and persuasion to introduce it by degrees into practice' ('Concordat', article 5, GD 530/571/14, NA Scot.), was the guidance. Bishop Skinner wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury that Seabury seemed 'a truly pious, prudent and well-principled man' ('Scottish Guardian', 25 Nov 1884). 
Finally, in May 1785 Seabury returned home to New London, Connecticut. Two years later William White and Samuel Provoost were able to be consecrated in London, after an act of parliament (1786) had allowed such consecrations of men from outside the British dominions. Skinner wrote to Seabury hoping that there would 'be no occasion for two separate communions among the episcopalians' (Skinner to Seabury, 20 June 1787, Skinner, 67). He had no need to fear. Seabury, by 'gentle methods', brought 'a harmonious conclusion' (Wilberforce, 215) between the English and Scottish traditions when the prayer book and constitution of the Protestant Episcopal church in the United States were approved in 1790. Seabury was appointed the first presiding bishop and also assumed the see of Rhode Island. 
Seabury spent the remainder of his life in the quiet pastoral care of his scattered flock. A contemporary saw him as someone to whom 'theological niceties were (an) aversion' (Abraham Jarvis, 5 May 1796, Beardsley, 361). He remained a poor man on his meagre $50 a year, and it was as a friend and physician to the deprived that he was remembered. Yet he had an awareness of the dignity of his office with a modesty of manner. To the question, 'How old are you, bishop?', he replied 'Old enough to be better than I am' (Beardsley, 365). He was robust in appearance, with a clear, sonorous voice, and it was at the end of a four-week journey of 134 miles on horseback through his two dioceses that he died, of apoplexy, on 25 February 1796 in New London. He was buried three days later in the public burial-ground there. The links he established with the Episcopal church in Scotland are commemorated in the enlargement, in 1948, of St Andrew's Cathedral in Aberdeen and in the consecration, in 1956, of a new bishop of Aberdeen by the then bishop of Connecticut.

Lade, Michael (bap. 1737, d. 1799), racehorse owner and miser, was baptized at St Peter and St Paul's church, Boughton under Blean, Kent, on 10 July 1737, the son of Michael Lade and his second wife Elizabeth Dadd, the daughter of Thomas Adams, and widow of David Dadd of Boughton. From 1748 he was educated at King's School, Canterbury, and after April 1755 at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1759. On 1 April 1757 he was admitted to the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar on 6 February 1761. On 10 November 1773 he married Sophia, Lady Cranstoun (died 1799), the widow of James Cranstoun, sixth Baron Cranstoun, and daughter of Jeremiah Brown of Abscourt, Surrey. Seven years later he stood as MP for Canterbury but polled just 28 votes. In May 1787 he took the lease of Cannon Park, Kingsclere, Hampshire. He was soon racing horses, but only at nearby meetings to save money. His first appearance in the sporting press in 1794 set the tone for most future comment. His racing groom and jockey, John Scott, had sued for unpaid wages, an action which Lade, as a lawyer, stopped by an injunction in the exchequer. Scott had to have this put aside at Hampshire assizes, where an agreed arbiter ordered the payment to Scott of the considerable sum of $165 as damages and all legal costs. 
Lade made two excursions to Newmarket, where he enjoyed his one and only major success as a racing man by winning the important Oatland Stakes in 1797 with his bay colt by Dungannon out of Letitia. There then followed an impressive list of failures -- at Ascot Heath, Stockbridge, Burford, Egham, and Reading. Newmarket in the following year proved equally disastrous and Lade died some months later with his stable completely neglected and his horses looking so wretched at auction that many went for only 2 or 3 guineas. 
Personally, Lade was as unattractive as his horses. He appeared to have few if any friends, and was reported as seldom seen in company on the racecourse or anywhere else; he was also said to be 'cynically rigid and innately parsimonious'. His obituary in the 'Sporting Magazine' pulled no punches and referred both to his titled wife who brought him some $5000 a year but who was mentally incapacitated, and to the ladies he kept in Pall Mall and at Turnham Green, though 'he was a total stranger to the powers of attraction and we may safely presume that 'his amours' were regulated much more (on the part of the ladies) by interest than affection'. His will (proved 7 February 1800) referred to his relationship with Bevilia Gordon (died 1816) to whom he left property and with whom he had a daughter Anne Maria Gordon. In short, 'he 'lived' without regard, so he 'died' without 'regret'' ('Sporting Magazine', vol. 15). His wife, Sophia, died on 26 October 1799; Lade died, probably at his London address, Stamford Brook, Hammersmith, in late November and was buried with his wife at St James's Church, Westminster, on 2 December 1799.

Brayfield, John James (1752/3-1821), writer on sport, was the only son of Sarah Brayfield (1732/3-1820) of Camberwell, Surrey, and possibly of George Brayfield (died 1785), a former governor of London's St Bartholomew's Hospital, who died suddenly in the Strand in September 1785. On 27 December 1773 he married Elizabeth Childs (died in or after 1821) at St Leonard, Shoreditch, London. Little more is known of Brayfield's life apart from what appears in an obituary in the 'Sporting Magazine' for March 1821. This describes him as a lifelong habitue of London fairs, boxing matches, races, and 'diversions of every kind' from the 'ring made by the first rate amateurs of the fancy' (that is prizefights) down to the weekly badger-baiting in Black Boy Alley. The latter pastime was said to have been stopped by the intervention of the Society for the Reformation of Manners in 1803, though a later revival is possible. To this catalogue of spectacles Brayfield also added public hangings, being a 'constant at Newgate executions'. 
Brayfield was almost certainly the J. J. B. responsible for some of the more interesting and perceptive contributions to the sporting press during the early nineteenth century. The 'Sporting Magazine's' essay 'On the art of swimming' (June 1811), for example, was aimed at young readers, particularly those whom 'pleasure or other motives' took to the coast. J. J. B. provided a discussion of buoyancy aids such as corks and bladders (of which he approved), and his thoughts on the best way to learn: walking into the sea breast-deep and then repeatedly throwing an egg towards the shore and then diving towards the object. In a more substantial article two years later, 'The importance of regulating the diversions of people', J. J. B. drew attention to the then widespread alarm at the degeneracy of modern popular recreations, such as gurning, sack-racing, and competitions to eat hot puddings, which he considered a far cry from the former pastimes of long bow or cudgel play. Equally deplorable was the equation of cards and dice as the 'chief sports' of the 'quality of both sexes'. His recommendation that country gentlemen encourage 'manly and innocent sports' was both a means of fostering well-being and an instrument of social control by making the tenantry 'brave and good subjects'. 
Brayfield is thought to have lived in the parish of St Giles, Camberwell. He died aged sixty-eight and, according to the parish registers of St Botolph, Aldersgate, London, was buried, probably at St Botolph's, on 16 February 1821. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, who was later described as living in St Luke's parish, Middlesex, and who received an annuity in Brayfield's will (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1642, sig. 248). Other bequests were made to a grandson, J. J. B. Willis, the son of Brayfield's natural daughter married to a John Willis.

Winstone, James (1863-1921), trade unionist, was born on 9 February 1863 at Waunfawr, Machen Lower, near Risca, Monmouthshire, the son of William Winstone, master mason, and his wife, Hannah, 'nee' Edmunds, whose previous married name was Wilton. His father died young and, at the age of eight, Winstone left school to work at a brickworks to support his widowed mother. He then became a colliery boy at Risca united colliery, where he worked for fourteen years. He gained a reputation as a trade union militant and had to leave the colliery for a time before returning as a checkweighman. On 15 May 1886 he married Sarah Jane Ivin 
(or Iven; 'b'. 1862/3)
, the daughter of Richard Ivin, a foundry labourer. They had seven children, two of whom died in infancy. 
Winstone worked with William Brace and others in fighting the sliding-scale wage system operating in the Welsh coalfield since the mid-1870s, and became agent for the eastern valleys district in 1891. He was a founder of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), created after the momentous six months' coal stoppage in 1898, and became executive member for the Tredegar district. About this time he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He was an active Baptist and strong supporter of the temperance movement. He was elected a member of Abersychan district council, becoming chairman in 1911, and from 1906 was also a member of Monmouthshire county council. Apart from being active in local government, he stood for parliament in the general election of 1906 as candidate for Monmouth Boroughs. He polled well in the docks areas of Newport among Irish electors, but finished third, well behind the Liberals. 
In the early years of the SWMF, Winstone was always associated with men like Vernon Hartshorn, George Barker, and C. B. Stanton, who sought to reform and radicalize the federation executive and make it far more aggressive in fighting the coal owners. Winstone himself denounced the conciliation board and declared that any reconciliation of capitalism with labour was 'an impossibility'. He was prominent in the turbulent history of the rapidly expanding Welsh coalfield in the years from 1906 onwards, with the riots at Tonypandy, battles over an eight-hour day and wage payments in 'abnormal places', and the strike for a national minimum wage for miners in 1912. He was also active in promoting the Central Labour College as a breakaway from Ruskin College, and became president of the Plebs League formed by Noah Ablett and others to promote class-conscious workers' education in the coalfield. 
In 1912 Winstone succeeded William Brace as vice-president of the SWMF after the latter had replaced the aged William Abraham (Mabon) as president. At the same time Winstone, unlike others on the radical wing, sought to retain contacts with the Labour Party rather than proceed along the syndicalist path advocated in the Unofficial Reform Committee's pamphlet 'The Miners' Next Step'. When war broke out in August 1914, he was in a powerful position on the SWMF, and even more so in June 1915 when he followed William Brace as acting president of the federation. He thus led the remarkable wartime strike by the Welsh miners in July 1915 on behalf of a new, higher standard wage rate. Despite the scandalized outcry from critics, the federation forced Lloyd George to visit Cardiff to negotiate, and the outcome was a standard rate for miners of 3's'. 4died a day plus 50 per cent. 
On the other hand, unlike Ablett and others on the far left, Winstone supported British participation in the war and took part in recruiting campaigns; a son of his served in the army in France. A momentous episode came in November 1915 when Keir Hardie, MP for Merthyr, died. After much local conflict, Winstone was nominated official Labour candidate by the local Labour Representation Committee. But he was then opposed, on a 'patriotic labour' basis, by the erstwhile radical, C. B. Stanton, the miners' agent for Aberdar. Since Winstone vehemently opposed conscription, the by-election became a touchstone for the workers' view of the war. It was an angry contest; visiting ILP speakers such as Ramsay MacDonald were denounced as 'pro-German'. At one time Winstone appeared to challenge the aggressive Stanton to a bare-knuckle fight. But in the end Stanton defeated Winstone comfortably by over 4000 votes. 
Winstone lost again in Merthyr, much more narrowly this time, to a Lloyd George Liberal, in the 'coupon' general election of December 1918, when opponents attacked him as a pacifist and a Bolshevik. He remained a powerful force in mining unionism, serving as a south Wales representative on the Miners' Federation of Great Britain executive from 1915 to 1918 and from 1920 to 1921, while in 1920 he succeeded Brace as president of the SWMF. He gave evidence before the Sankey commission in 1919, advocating state ownership of the mines, and also campaigned for British forces to be removed from Ireland and the Soviet Union. In local community affairs, he served as chairman of Monmouthshire county council in 1920, was a member of the Pontypool board of guardians for a time, a magistrate, and a governor of the University of Wales. He was heavily embroiled in the post-war economic downturn in the coalfield and the inter-union tensions leading to the collapse of a proposed general strike on 'Black Friday', 15 April 1921, but then he fell ill. After an operation, he died of appendicitis at 20 Endsleigh Gardens, St Pancras, London, on 27 July 1921. It was recorded that 25,000 attended his funeral and that he left barely $250. 
Winstone was a remarkable and selfless workers' leader during the industrial turmoil in the Welsh coalfield between the 1890s and the 1920s. He was a passionate man, without perhaps the tactical shrewdness of others such as Vernon Hartshorn. But both in industrial relations and in local government he could harness socialist idealism to constructive reform, as in his advocacy of municipal housing. In their era of greatness, James Winstone was not the least of the Welsh miners' leaders.

Johnson, Tom (c.1750-1797), prize-fighter, was born Thomas Jackling in Derby. He was known as Tom Johnson throughout his professional life. He was working in London as a corn porter in 1781 when he took on his first professional fight, beating the once great veteran Stephen Oliver, who rejoiced in the nickname of Death. The fight linked two great eras of boxing as Oliver had appeared in the old amphitheatres of Figg, Taylor, and Broughton in its first age and Johnson was to become the first champion of the next, though before then he had several minor bouts, all for stakes of 50 guineas at most. 
In 1786 the prince of Wales and his two brothers, the dukes of Kent and Clarence, began to take an active interest and pugilism became the fashion. Johnson was clearly the best boxer of the day and in January 1787 he met Will Ward for a fight for 200 guineas a side before a large crowd at Oakingham, Berkshire. The vogue proved strong enough to survive a disappointing fight which Johnson won easily, but he himself failed to appreciate the change in his sport's fortunes, and took on the ponderous slogger Fry for a mere 50 guineas in the following summer when most of the new gentry enthusiasts were out of town and little interest was aroused. This was the last of his old-style skirmishes. The stake money that he attracted grew impressively, from 300 guineas for the two fights with the Irish challenger Michael Ryan, to 500 for the fights against Isaac Perrins and Ben Bryan. By the time of the Perrins fight Johnson was beginning to show his age and won only after a hard struggle over sixty-two rounds. This contest in particular brought him riches such as he had never known before. His backer, Thomas Bullock, a well-known sportsman, won $20,000 on the fight and made his fighter (who also took two-thirds of the gate money) a present of $1000. 
As a boxer Johnson was one of the earliest to make justifiable claims to be 'scientific' in that he would cautiously assess the strengths and weaknesses of an opponent and concentrate attacks on his most vulnerable areas, a discretion and care which did not, however, extend to his life outside the ring. He was said to have had property worth $5000 by the late 1780s but money slipped rapidly through his fingers. He found himself forced to defend his championship against Ben Bryan in January 1791 when he was over forty and unfit. He injured his hand on a ring railing, lost his usual composure, and was defeated. Thereafter his decline was both sad and rapid. It was said of him that while working as a porter in his younger days he once took the place of a sick colleague by carrying twice a normal load, covering for the absentee so that his wages would continue to be paid and his wife and children sustained. Unfortunately there was little sign of such generosity of heart in his post-ring life. 
Johnson took over The Grapes, Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and soon turned it into what was little short of a gambling den and resort of criminals. He gave reluctant and shifting evidence at Chelmsford assizes at the trial of John Wiltshire, accused of robbing two travellers from Newmarket. Johnson was then reduced to taking his gambling table to fights and making a nuisance of himself at the cockpit, refusing to pay up on losing bets and offering to fight instead. He moved to Ireland, first to Dublin then to Cork, found attempts to profit from his pugilism unrewarding, and again took to his gambling table. His deterioration was rapid. Both his health and his spirit were broken and he died there on 21 January 1797.

Goddard, Julia Bachope (1825-1896), children's writer and animal welfare campaigner, was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, on 11 July 1825, the eldest daughter in the family of at least four daughters and three sons of Samuel Aspinwall Goddard (1796-1886) and his wife, Jemima, 'nee' Bachope (1800-1875). Her father, who was from Brookline, Massachusetts, had settled in Birmingham, where he was an iron merchant and gun manufacturer, also writing pamphlets on free trade and currency reform; he was the consul of the United States in Birmingham, and became a naturalized British subject. Details of Julia Goddard's early life are obscure, but she remained for most of her life in the family home at Edgbaston with her parents and unmarried brother and sister. In 1863 she published her first children's book, 'Karl and the Six Little Dwarfs'; more than twenty-five others were to follow. Clearly written and well presented, they earned Goddard considerable popularity among contemporaries. Since her death, however, her writing has rarely even merited a mention in bibliographical reference works. She also wrote a number of pieces for contemporary journals and magazines and was a frequent contributor to the 'Birmingham Daily Post'. 
Many of Goddard's children's books, such as 'The Four Cats of the Tippertons and other Stories about Animals' (1881), focused upon the treatment of animals, reflecting her lifelong endeavour to improve their condition. She was, according to one contemporary animal welfare publication, 'one of the hardest and yet most unpretentious workers the movement has yet possessed' ('Animals' Friend'). Goddard does not appear to have been associated with the more radical elements in the animal rights' movements or anti-vivisection campaigns: she was not herself a vegetarian, arguing instead for more humane methods of animal slaughter. Indeed, she personified a particular brand of moderate humanitarianism, advocated by publications such as the 'Animals' Friend', which applauded her work, and to which she contributed. 
Goddard's abiding aim was to ensure that all children were instructed in the correct and humane treatment of animals, arguing that 'The subject must be taught as much as any other subject of education' (Goddard, 87-8). She believed that such a move would not only contribute greatly to an improvement in animal welfare but also have a dramatic effect in uplifting the morality of the young. She persistently urged the Department of Education to make the proper treatment of animals a compulsory element in the school curriculum; while she did not achieve this goal, the department did recommend teachers to include such lessons in their pupils' reading courses. Goddard encouraged and publicized the works of writers such as the Revd J. G. Wood and F. H. Harkwell, who wrote books designed for teachers' use on natural history and kindness to animals. 
Goddard was best remembered for her establishment of an annual prize to school pupils in her home town, Birmingham, from 1876 onwards. This was in keeping with her philosophy that positive inducements and not merely punitive measures were required if a sea change was to be effected in the country's treatment of animals. The scheme, which she devised with the assistance of J. A. Langford, a former secretary of the Birmingham Co-operative League, was awarded on the basis of essays on the subject of animal welfare and 'viva voce' examinations. It involved Goddard in the judging of up to two thousand essays each year and the organization of large public meetings to award the prizes. Such local dignitaries as John Bright and George Dawson publicly endorsed the scheme. Goddard was also known locally for her establishment of a competition to improve the treatment and conditions of horses and donkeys for hire in Sutton Park. 
From 1894 Goddard suffered from extremely poor health following a severe attack of influenza. This, combined with her failing eyesight, forced her to give up her work. She died unmarried of a cerebral haemorrhage on 30 September 1896 at her cottage in Little Aston, near Sutton Coldfield, which she shared with her sister, Fanny Goddard. Her funeral took place on 5 October at Edgbaston church.

Whately, (Elizabeth) Jane (1822-1893), religious author, was born on 1 June 1822 in Oxford, the eldest child of the Revd Richard Whately (1787-1863), and Elizabeth Pope (died 1860). She had three sisters and one brother. She spent the first few years of her life in Suffolk, where her father had been presented to the living of Halesworth. The family returned to Oxford in 1825, when her father took up the principalship of St Alban Hall. Her sister described the young Jane (as she was known) as 'earnest and thoughtful'. Her mother, who was herself an author of some religious works, took charge of Jane's education, although Richard Whately saw to it that all of the children had some grounding in Latin. Jane's early interests, however, mirrored her mother's and she showed an early interest in, and aptitude for, music, French, and Italian. On her family's relocation to Dublin in 1831, when her father became archbishop, Jane's education was continued by a governess and 'the best masters Dublin then possessed'; as a bright eldest daughter Jane also pursued subjects 'not then usual for girls' (Wale, 11, 9). Since her governess could not provide this, she shared her brother's lessons with the Revd Blanco White as well as receiving instruction from her father. 
Jane benefited from her father's Oxford connections: when in London they stayed with the Nassau Seniors and summer holidays often included a visit to the Arnolds at Rugby. Richard Whately evidently encouraged his children in their pursuits, offering affectionate criticism; 'A Selection of English Synonyms' (1851; many later editions) is one result of his interest. With her mother and sisters Jane was active in local philanthropic endeavours; she and her sister Mary Whately taught for the Irish Church Mission Society. Italians living in Dublin were also a focus of her attention, as was the cause of converting Spain to protestantism. As the eldest daughter of an archbishop Jane had extensive social and domestic responsibilities which increased after the death of her mother in 1860. As her two surviving sisters (the youngest had died in 1859) were living abroad for health reasons, the burden of caring for the ailing Richard Whately as well as her brother's children fell on her. 
The death of Archbishop Whately in the autumn of 1863 marked the end of Jane Whately's settled residence in Dublin and the development of her literary and missionary career. Before her father's death Jane had written a few small works based on her own 'Bible' study, co-authored a book on mothers' meetings, and produced a biography of Martin Luther as well as the 'Selection of English Synonyms'. After her father's death Jane began work on his biography; she began in 1864 by publishing a collection of his sermons and 'Miscellaneous Remains from the Commonplace Book of Richard Whately'. Her 'Life and Correspondence of Richard Whately, D.D.' (1866) was completed with the assistance of her father's pupil and friend Nassau Senior. She later published abridged versions of Richard Whately's 'The Kingdom of Christ Delineated' (1877) and 'The Errors of Romanism' (1878). 
Jane seems to have had stronger evangelical leanings than her father and was ever ready to elucidate the dangers of Roman Catholicism; a substantial portion of her published works deal with this subject, for example: 'Maude, or, The Anglican Sister of Mercy' (1869) and 'Romanism in the Light of the Gospel' (1882). The bulk of her writings, however, took home and foreign missions as their subject. Indeed, missionary journeys dominated Jane Whately's later life. Until her sister Mary's death in 1889, Jane spent most winters at her sister's mission in Egypt where she established a school for girls. Jane never acquired a facility for Arabic, so the girls were taught in French and English. Summers were spent largely in France or Switzerland with her sister Henrietta and her family. Throughout her life Jane was troubled by asthma and many of her travels (whether to Egypt, Spain, or Italy) were intended to improve her health. These sojourns were transformed by Jane into missionary opportunities -- when travelling she was known to take tracts with her and speak openly to passers-by. Her health weakening, Jane was advised to winter in Guernsey; she died there, unmarried, at St Peter Port on 19 February 1893 and was buried on the island.

Whately, Mary Louisa (1824-1889), educationist and missionary, was born on 31 August 1824 at Halesworth in Suffolk, where her father was rector. She was the third child and second daughter of the five children of the scholar Dr Richard Whately (1787-1863), later archbishop of Dublin, and Elizabeth (died 1860), a charity worker who wrote on religious matters, the daughter of J. C. Pope of Hillingdon Hall, Uxbridge. When Richard Whately became principal of St Alban's Hall in 1825 the family moved to Oxford. In 1831 he was appointed to the see of Dublin: the family lived in Dublin in winter and in the summer at Redesdale, 5 miles from the city. The children were educated at home by their parents; they helped their mother to visit the Irish poor in their homes and taught in the village school built by their father. 
In 1849, while accompanying her brother to France and Italy for his health, Mary Whately painted and learned Italian. On her return to Ireland she put much energy into the ragged schools (for children whose parents could not afford fees) and homes of the Irish Church Mission; she also visited poor Italians in Dublin. Through this work she gained first-hand experience of teaching people of different languages and cultures. In 1856-7 Mary Whately travelled to Cairo and the Holy Land with a friend; unfortunately her journals of this visit were lost. However, a fellow traveller described how, faced by Bedouin with flashing weapons, she began to sketch the scene. 'By the life of the Prophet!' exclaimed the chief. 'The Englishwoman is writing us down!' and, with a friendly greeting, wheeled and galloped off (Porter, 229-33). 
In 1860, when her mother and her youngest sister had died, Mary Whately returned to Cairo to open the first school in Egypt for poor Muslim girls. She soon had thirty pupils and began to train teachers. She learned Arabic and was joined in her work by a Lebanese missionary to Muslims, Mansoor Shakoor, and his brother, Yousif; they, and later Mansoor's wife, worked with her for over twenty years. After visiting Ireland briefly in 1863 when her father died, Mary returned to Egypt to settle. She and the Shakoors opened a boys' Sunday school and later a ragged school for boys. She recorded her experiences in a lively and anecdotal style in 'Ragged Life in Egypt' (1861) and 'More about Ragged Life in Egypt' (1863). From time to time she returned to Europe, and in 1866 took with her Mansoor Shakoor and his betrothed wife (whom Mary raised as her adopted daughter and educated). 
Mary Whately's work was funded by her own small income and donations. The schools became a regular visit on the itinerary of British travellers in Cairo, and in 1869 she was given a grant of land by the khedive. There, following Shakoor's plans, she built her house, a school, and mission buildings. The number of children in the two schools rose to some 500. The boys followed a full curriculum, covering basic academic and vocational subjects, while the girls (of whom there were about 100 in 1872) learned to read and write in Arabic, to sew, and embroider. A few girls progressed to a full elementary curriculum. 
Mary Whately also took her Christian mission to the houses of the Egyptian poor, to the Bedouin camps in the desert, and to the villages along the Nile, working first with Shakoor and, when he died in 1872, with his widow. They told the stories from the 'Bible' and distributed Arabic scriptures. In some villages they were coldly received, but more frequently they were welcomed. Whately wrote of her close relationship with these people in 'Among the Huts in Egypt' (1872) and 'Stories of Peasant Life on the Nile' (1888). In 1879, with the help of a Syrian doctor who married into the Shakoor family, she opened a medical mission, which was soon caring for some 3000 patients a year. At the dispensary she explained the 'Bible' stories 'in her simple and graphic way in the colloquial Arabic the people understood' (E. J. Whately, 78). The ragged schools flourished and her elder sister, Elizabeth Jane Whately (1822-1893), joined her and opened a private school for the 'mixed multitude' of foreign residents in Cairo. 
In 1881 the 'Arabi rebellion' forced Mary Whately to withdraw from Egypt for a time, but she soon returned. On her visits to Europe she 'eloquently pleaded for Egypt and Islam at meetings and on every occasion that offered' (E. J. Whately, 82). She wrote and illustrated a number of books about everyday life in Egypt, as well as old family stories written in Spain and Switzerland, a memoir of Shakoor, and interesting fictional works 'illustrative of Egyptian manners and customs'. 
An intrepid and far-sighted woman, Mary Whately was strongly opposed to slavery and deplored the status of women in Egypt, hoping that one day they would 'come and go as one created to be neither a toy nor a drudge, but a helpmeet to man' (E. J. Whately, 126). Her writing promoted understanding of modern Egypt among her readers. 
Mary Whately died in Cairo of a chest infection on 9 March 1889, shortly after one of her mission journeys up the Nile, cared for to the end by Mrs Shakoor. She was buried in Cairo on 9 or 10 March. Her schools did not survive her for long, but the Church Missionary Society, which had supported her work with several annual grants, had heeded her prompting to start a second Egypt mission to evangelize Muslims and had worked in the country from 1882.

Williams, Sarah (1837/8-1868), poet and novelist, was the only daughter of Louisa and Robert Williams (died 1868), a successful Welsh businessman living in Kentish Town. She was to attribute her poetic talent to Welsh ancestry. Her cosseted upbringing in a quietly pious, apolitical dissenting family included early schooling from a governess. Family holidays were spent in Wales and on the south coast of England, and included a trip to Paris. Her childhood self-appellation, Sadie, became her literary pseudonym. 
In the early 1850s Sarah Williams attended Queen's College, Harley Street, London, where her literary talent was recognized and fostered by the subsequent principal, Edward Hayes Plumptre (1821-1891), a man renowned for his encouragement of women's education. Illness curtailed this phase of her education. An introduction to Alexander Strahan (1833-1918), the evangelical publisher, obtained for her the entree to 'Good Words', the 'Sunday Magazine', and 'The Argosy', to which she contributed a series of humorous sketches, 'The Foozy Papers', and poems. A posthumously published collection of poetry, 'Twilight Hours' (1868), is remarkable for the wide scope of lyric forms and genres, ranging from children's verse, religious, and pastoral to a lovers' correspondence in verse, 'Sospiri volate'. Her interest in the speaking voice is reminiscent of the Brownings, and the timbre sometimes more akin to Christina Rossetti's, but a distinctive voice emerges. An attentive ear for dialogue is also the distinguishing feature of her prose. Her only complete novel, 'The Prima Donna', the Gothic plot of which she had first used for a narrative poem, was posthumously published in 1884. Half of all her earnings were devoted to charities for the sick and the poor. 
The pain of Sarah Williams's incurable cancer may have explained the abstracted air upon which observers frequently remarked. She was reputed to have 'a face, which without beauty, attracted and arrested one' (Mayo, 205). After her adored father's unexpected death in January 1868 she decided to risk an operation in the hope of prolonging her life and moving with her mother to Wales. To her great friend, Bessie Palmer, she expressed her dilemma thus: 'Bangor, or heaven, Bessie, -- Bangor or Heaven' (ibid., 207). The operation was unsuccessful and she died at her home, 95 Queen's Crescent, Kentish Town, on 25 April 1868.

(Matilda) Blanche Gibbs (1817-1887), philanthropist]. She was born in Eastgate Street, Gloucester, on 17 December 1817, the third and youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Crawley-Boevey, third baronet (1769-1847), and Mary Albinia (died 1835), eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Hyde Page. Her father was the first cousin of Henry Gibbs's wife, Caroline, and her brother Charles Crawley. The visit of William and Blanche Gibbs to Rome in 1840 reflected and confirmed their shared commitment to the restoration of Catholic practices in the Church of England as preached by the Oxford Movement. They had seven children: Dorothea (1840-1914), Antony (1841-1907), Alice Blanche (1843-1871), William (1846-1869), George Abraham (1848-1870), Henry Martin (1850-1928), and Albinia (1853-1874). At his marriage Gibbs moved from his brother's house in Bedford Square to 13 Hyde Park Street. On his brother's death in 1842 Gibbs became the sole partner in Antony Gibbs & Sons.

Durant, Susan Durant (1827-1873), sculptor, was born in Stamford Hill, Middlesex, on 8 July 1827, the second daughter of George Durant (1784-1872), silkbroker, and his wife, Mary Dugdale ('fl'. 1788-1861), both of whom were from Devon. Susan Durant became interested in sculpture when spending a winter in Rome with her parents as a young girl, and decided to adopt it as a profession. She studied with the French sculptor Baron Henri de Triqueti (1804-1874), remaining his pupil and assistant throughout her life, making frequent trips to his Paris studio though maintaining an independent studio in London. In 1847 Durant received the Society of Art's prestigious silver Isis medal for an original portrait bust in plaster. This may have been one of two she exhibited in the Royal Academy that year; she subsequently exhibited almost every year until her death. 
From her large social circle in London Durant obtained a clientele for commissions and models for portraits, usually in marble, such as 'George Grote', the historian, whose wife campaigned for women's rights (exh. RA, 1863; University College, London). Often her subject was the active woman, for example, 'Harriet Beecher Stowe' (exh. RA, 1857; plaster version, Castle Howard; marble, Harriet Beecher Stowe Center, Hartford, Connecticut) and 'Ruth' (exh. RA, 1869; priv. coll. France). Her early neo-classical works, for example her self-portrait (exh. RA, 1853), reflecting her Roman studies, gave way to a more naturalistic style influenced by Triqueti, sometimes incorporating his polychromatic marble inlay technique, as in 'Nina Lehmann' (1871; priv. coll.). She exhibited two 'ideal' subjects in the Great Exhibition of 1851, and lent 'Robin Hood' (exh. RA, 1856; Society of Female Artists, 1858) to the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester. 
In 1866 a contemporary described Durant as 'a tall and very comely young woman... with rounded limbs... flashing face and massive rippling chestnut hair... superbly drest [in Paris fashions presumably]... full of graceful fun' (Dunford, 89). Charismatic, at ease in society, she charmed all her clients, especially the ageing Grote, and certainly her master, Triqueti. She had a private income but chose to conduct her career on a professional basis to avoid accusations of amateurism and to enhance her status as an artist. She ran her elderly father's household, even from Paris. She supported women's access to the vote, education, and the professions. In 1863 she was the only woman out of fourteen sculptors commissioned by the corporation of London to execute figures from English literature for the Mansion House. Her 'Faithful Shepherdess' (exh. RA, 1863) earned her $500, was compared favourably with entries by her male competitors, and was 'the first important commission for a public work of sculpture given to a lady in this country' ('ILN', 1863, 587). 
Soon afterwards Triqueti introduced Durant into the royal circle and she received a succession of commissions from Queen Victoria including high-relief marble medallions of the queen, Prince Albert, and their children for the Albert Chapel, Windsor Castle (exh. RA, 1866-9; plaster and marble versions, Royal Collection, Osborne; bronze reductions, NPG). Durant worked regularly at Windsor, Osborne, and Potsdam, and taught Princess Louise sculpture, becoming a royal favourite. She captured naturalistic details of hair, features, and costume and enjoyed a facility for achieving a likeness which was recognized by contemporary critics and appreciated by the queen and her family. Durant's most important commission was that from Queen Victoria for a monument to King Leopold of the Belgians for St George's Chapel, Windsor. This monument of the recumbent king with his hand resting on a lion, and behind him two low-relief angels holding the shields of England and Belgium was installed to the queen's satisfaction and to critical acclaim in 1867, but removed in 1879 to the recently renamed Leopold Room in Christ Church, Esher. 
At the height of her career, and having completed a further portrait of Queen Victoria for the Inner Temple (exh. RA, 1872), Durant was struck down by ill health. She died of pleurisy on 1 January 1873, in Paris, and was buried in Pere Lachaise cemetery. She was unmarried. Her early death was regretted by her royal clients and many friends, some of whose unfinished portraits remained in her studio. One, 'Dr Elizabeth Garrett Anderson', formed her last Royal Academy exhibit that year. Susan Durant left provision in her will for an infant, Henry Paul Harvey Durant ['see 'Harvey, Sir (Henry) Paul], who was her child by Triqueti.

Mingana, Alphonse (1878?-1937), Syriac and Christian Arabic scholar, was born on 23 December probably in 1878 (not 1881 as usually stated) in Sharansh al- 'Ulya in the district of Zakho, vilayet of Mosul (now northern Iraq), the eldest of the eight children of Paolos Mingana, Chaldean Catholic priest, and his wife, Maryam Nano, both of Burjan. He had an extraordinary facility with languages. Brought up speaking neo-Aramaic, he was sent in 1891 to the Syro-Chaldean Seminary of St Jean in Mosul where, in addition to the usual theological education, he studied Arabic and Syriac -- taught by the great Ya'qub Awgin Manna (1867-1928) -- Turkish, Persian, Kurdish, biblical Hebrew, Latin, and French. 
After being ordained priest in 1902, when he assumed the religious name Alphonse, Mingana taught Syriac in the seminary. From 1903 to 1910 he was also corrector of Syriac and Arabic books for the Dominican Press in Mosul. This period is remarkable, however, for two publications which established Mingana's controversial reputation. In 1905 he published an edition of the works of Narsai, an important fifth-century theologian, which included in its introduction a passage without any textual basis, despite Mingana's claims. In 1907 he published the Syriac chronicle of Mshiha-Zkha from a manuscript said to be of the tenth century but subsequently revealed to be an early twentieth-century work whose scribe admitted having 'aged' it on Mingana's instructions. Most scholars decided that Mingana had composed the chronicle himself, and repeated charges of forgery, though never substantiated, were to dog his career. Ironically one of his footnotes to the chronicle, in which he questioned the historicity of Mar Mari, one of the apostles credited with founding the Syrian churches, angered the Chaldean patriarch who in 1910 removed Mingana from his seminary position. 
In March 1913, having severed his connections with the Chaldean church, Mingana left for England where he was welcomed and employed as a teacher of Arabic and Hebrew by J. Rendel Harris, the director of studies at Woodbrooke, a Quaker college in Selly Oak, Warwickshire. Mingana, who from 1914 assumed the title Doctor, collaborated with Harris to produce the celebrated edition of the 'Odes and Psalms of Solomon' (1916; 1920). While at Woodbrooke, Mingana met Emma Sophie Floor (died 1974), a Norwegian Lutheran from Stavanger, the daughter of a bookseller. They were married on 14 July 1915 at a Quaker meeting-house in King's Norton, and had two children: John, born in 1916, and Marie, born in 1918. 
From 1915 until 1932 Mingana was employed by the John Rylands Library, Manchester, to produce a catalogue of its Arabic manuscripts (published in 1934). For a few years (1916-23) he was a special lecturer in Arabic at the University of Manchester, although he never enjoyed public speaking. During the First World War, Mingana produced vocabularies for the use of the British armed forces in the Middle East and in 1920 he was naturalized as a British citizen. 
The remainder of Mingana's life was to be dominated by his passion for manuscripts. Largely at the expense of Dr Edward Cadbury, Mingana travelled in 1924 and 1925 to Syria and Iraq and in 1929 to the Sinai and Upper Egypt where he acquired more than 2000 Syriac and Arabic manuscripts. The majority of these, constituting one of the largest such collections in the world, went to the college in Selly Oak where he himself catalogued them (1933-9). From 1932 he lived not far away, at 168 Middleton Hall Road, King's Norton, in a house named Manuscripta. Some Syriac manuscripts went to the John Rylands Library, although Mingana replaced ten of the most important of these with inferior texts from Selly Oak. He published many Syriac and Arabic texts in the series 'Woodbrooke Studies' (1927-34), followed in 1935 by Job of Edessa's 'Book of Treasures'. He died at his home on 5 December 1937.

Grey, Sir Roger de (1918-1995), artist, was born on 18 April 1918 at Colehatch, Tylers Green, Chipping Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, the second son and youngest of three children of Nigel Arthur de Grey (1886-1951), naval intelligence officer, and his wife, Florence Emily Frances Gore (1883-1963). Both his parents were of aristocratic descent. His father was deputy director of GCHQ at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. Inspired by tales of his uncle the painter Spencer Gore, Roger in his teens affected flamboyant 'aestheticism'. He was bullied at Eton, although he found a mentor in the assistant drawing master Robin (later Sir Robert) Darwin. 
De Grey studied at the Chelsea School of Art (1936-9 and 1945-7). During the war he served in the Royal West Kent yeomanry until 1942 and then saw action as a captain in the Royal Armoured Corps. On 2 May 1942 he married the painter Flavia Hatt Irwin ('b'. 1916), daughter of Clinton Irwin, a retired army officer. They had two sons and a daughter by late 1952. In 1947 de Grey moved to Newcastle upon Tyne to become lecturer in painting at the King Edward VII School of Art at King's College, then part of Durham University (and headed by Darwin). Lawrence Gowing and Victor Pasmore were influential colleagues. Promoted to master of painting in 1951, de Grey followed Darwin to London two years later as senior tutor at the Royal College of Art (RCA). 
Agnews Gallery mounted de Grey's first one-man exhibition in 1954. He specialized in contemplative evocations of nature: tightly composed still lifes and landscapes in soft muted colours which revealed a particular appreciation of Cezanne. Dappled sunlight and blue-green vegetation are characteristic of his work, which belongs to a recognizably British strand of post-impressionism. This was remote from the trend-setting pop art pioneered around 1960 by such RCA students as Peter Blake and David Hockney, but de Grey endeavoured to provide encouragement and defend new art against undiscriminating criticism. In 1973 he left the RCA to become principal of the City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, recently separated from the City and Guilds Institute. Retaining the job for the rest of his life, he did much to form the character of the school by having all students taught life drawing, promoting traditional crafts, and starting courses in restoration and conservation. 
De Grey was elected an associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1962 and a full academician in 1969. His close involvement began when he joined the academy's exhibitions committee (1975) before serving as treasurer from 1976 to 1984. The financial position was at first precarious, but he introduced corporate sponsorship of major exhibitions and saved the loss-making summer exhibition by levying a 15 per cent commission on sales. On 6 December 1984 he became the twenty-first president of the Royal Academy, eager to carry on the modernizing work of Sir Hugh Casson and to return the academy to the mainstream of contemporary art. By abolishing the apprentice status of associate, which some painters and architects reckoned demeaning, he attracted a number of prestigious new academicians -- such as Blake, Hockney, R. B. Kitaj, Norman Foster, and Richard Rogers -- who may have been wary of the society's past reputation for anti-modernism. De Grey did not deem it the president's task to pontificate about art. He appeared a gentle, approachable man. Quizzical friendliness cloaked any nervousness; his conversation was light and informal. Slender and spry, fond of hamburgers and chewing gum, he usually dressed in pale tweed tones enlivened by brightly coloured woollen tie and socks. 
By strengthening the international contacts of the Royal Academy, de Grey enabled it to stage loan exhibitions more ambitious than ever before. There were monographic shows devoted to Monet, Goya, Mantegna, Frans Hals, Poussin, Chagall, Sickert, and Henry Moore, and such synoptic shows as 'The Age of Chivalry' (1987) and 'The Art of Photography' (1989). The president concerned himself with every detail of presentation and publicity, and hotly insisted on the highest standards. He was also a very successful fund-raiser, hosting breakfasts, luncheons, and dinners in London and the USA. A donation by the American philanthropist Arthur M. Sackler made it possible for the academy to replace the old Diploma Galleries at Burlington House with the Sackler Galleries, which opened in June 1991, the month when de Grey received a knighthood (KCVO). He retired as president in April 1993 at the compulsory age of seventy-five. 
Much as he enjoyed being at the centre of things, de Grey had continued to produce about a dozen large works a year. His studio was a converted barn across a field from his country home at 5-6 Camer Street, Meopham, Kent. He made many studies on the theme 'interior/exterior', showing the view from within to without, with the blurring and reflections of window glass. Probably his most distinctive landscapes were painted late in life in south-west France, where he owned a house from 1977. 
De Grey died on 14 February 1995 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London after minor surgery to cure an intestinal infection. His wife survived him. A dedicated painter, administrator, and teacher, he had thrived on juggling all three activities.

Durrell, Gerald Malcolm (1925-1995), author, naturalist, and animal conservationist, was born in Jamshedpur, India, on 7 January 1925, the fifth and youngest child of Lawrence Samuel Durrell (1884-1928), civil engineer, and his wife, Louisa Florence, 'nee' Dixie (1886-1964). Lawrence George Durrell (1912-1990), poet and novelist, was his eldest brother; a second child died in infancy, but another brother and sister survived to adulthood. Following the death of Durrell's father in April 1928, the family uprooted themselves from India and went to England, moving to Bournemouth early in 1931. There Durrell indulged his passion for small creatures of all kinds, announcing to his mother when he was six that he would have his own zoo one day -- an ambition he was to pursue with extraordinary single-mindedness. Meanwhile his entire formal education amounted to two terms at a prep school. In 1935 the Durrell family again moved, settling on the Greek paradise island of Corfu. This was perhaps the great defining moment in Durrell's life. There he lived out an idyll of which other children could only dream. In the three books he later wrote about his Corfu childhood -- notably 'My Family and other Animals' (1956) -- he described his forays on foot to look for wildlife, and the impact his pet scorpions and snakes had on the rest of the household. Out of a bevy of eccentric private tutors, two laid the foundations of the man of achievement he became. The first was his brother Lawrence, who instilled in him a passion for language and encouraged him to take his first steps in creative writing. The second was a Corfiot medic, Dr Theo Stephanides, a biologist and polymath, who gave the boy a marvellous grounding in field biology and a broad appreciation of life on earth in all its diversity. 
With the onset of the Second World War the Corfu years came to an end and Durrell returned to Bournemouth with his mother. In 1945, after various odd jobs with animals, he became a student keeper at Whipsnade Zoo, where he learned the basics of large animal husbandry and first became aware of the role of man in the extinction of species. At the age of twenty-one he inherited $3000 from his father's legacy. This enabled him to fulfil another ambition -- to collect wild animals for zoos. Between 1947 and 1951 he undertook two major collecting expeditions to the British Cameroons and another to British Guiana. 
On 26 February 1951 Durrell married Jacqueline Sonia (Jacquie) Rasen ('b'. 1929), a student opera singer, who staunchly encouraged him in the next turn in his life. Jacquie encouraged his zoo ambitions and persuaded him to write his first book, 'The Overloaded Ark' (1953), about his first Cameroons expedition, and two further animal books in quick succession -- 'Three Singles to Adventure' (1954) and 'The Bafut Beagles' (1954). The freshness of these books, their charm, their ebullient humour, their totally new approach to wild animals and wild places, and the vivid, lyrical quality of their descriptive writing ensured their instant success worldwide. Almost overnight Durrell became one of the finest nature writers of the century, an inspiration to millions. Now a fully-fledged professional author, he set off on more collecting expeditions, resulting in further animal travel books including 'The Drunken Forest' (1956), set in Argentina and Paraguay, and 'Zoo in my Luggage' (1960), featuring one of the great characters of travel literature, Durrell's regal African drinking companion, the legendary Fon of Bafut. But it was his classic evocation of his childhood idyll in Corfu, 'My Family and other Animals', that brought him true fame and fortune. 
Durrell had never forgotten his boyhood ambition of founding a zoo of his own. In 1957 he returned from the Cameroons with a large collection of animals that was to form its nucleus. This was later transferred to Jersey, where he had taken a lease on the house and grounds of Les Augres Manor, Trinity, and was first opened to the public on 29 March 1959 as Jersey Zoo, which has become one of the world's finest small zoos. As a conservationist Durrell was a pioneer a long way ahead of most of the field. He had always intended that Jersey should become a conservation zoo dedicated to the breeding of animals in danger of extinction and their eventual return to the wild. With the founding of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust on 6 July 1963 his life's mission got under way. Within a few years the trust had established breeding groups of many species of endangered mammals, reptiles, and birds, and had begun to return their progeny to the wild. In 1976 Durrell created what he called a mini-university in a manor house adjacent to the zoo to provide intensive training for conservation workers from around the world, so that they could begin the process of saving species in their country of origin -- arguably the greatest innovative achievement of his life. By 2000 more than 1000 students from over 100 countries had received training at the International Training Centre. Durrell also established affiliate organizations in the United States and Canada to fund his work, which have since become international organizations in their own right. In 1989 the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) was founded at the University of Kent. 
For his contributions to animal conservation and animal literature Durrell received many honours. Though he had received virtually no formal education, he was awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of Yale (1977), Durham (1988), and Kent (1989), and among other honours was appointed officer of the Golden Ark by Prince Bernhard in 1981, and OBE in 1982. Over the years the private man became a public figure of international stature. Slim and lissom as a young man, with film star looks and a debonair aura, Durrell rounded out in maturity into a larger than life, bacchanalian figure, endowed with immense charisma and a hilarious sense of humour -- but also a proneness to depression and despair. In reality he was a latter-day St Francis confronted with an animal holocaust that St Francis could not have envisaged in his worst nightmare. His struggle to save the animal world was eventually to cost him his health, his happiness, and his marriage. 
In 1976 Durrell separated from his first wife. The next year, while on one of his many lecture tours to the USA, he met Lee Wilson McGeorge ('b'. 1949), a zoology graduate working on a PhD at Duke University, North Carolina. After their marriage in 1979 they travelled the world together, collecting endangered animals for Jersey Zoo, monitoring overseas conservation projects, jointly and singly authoring books (notably 'The Amateur Naturalist', 1982, with sales of several million worldwide), and taking part in many major documentary television series broadcast on networks around the world. In all Durrell wrote and presented more than 175 television documentaries, and wrote forty-two books, published in more than thirty countries. He died in Jersey on 30 January 1995 from complications following a liver transplant. He was survived by his second wife (there were no children of either marriage), who took over the reins as honorary director of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, later renamed the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in honour of its founder, to help carry on the task of animal conservation at the cutting edge in the twenty-first century.

Du Sautoy, Peter Francis (1912-1995), publisher, was born at 29 Hagley Road, Halesowen, Worcestershire, on 19 February 1912, the son of Edward Frank Du Sautoy, mechanical engineer and brick manufacturer, and his wife, Mabel Emmeline Annie Howse. His father served with distinction in the First World War and became a colonel in the army. He was educated at Uppingham School and Wadham College, Oxford, where he was a senior classical scholar and took a first in Greats. His literary interests were not reflected in any way in his family background. After a brief spell as a private tutor, and then as an assistant master at Newcastle under Lyme grammar school, he worked in the department of printed books at the British Museum with Angus Wilson in 1935, and then in the city of Oxford education department for three years. On 18 December 1937 he married Phyllis Mary 
(known as Mollie; 'b'. 1910/11)
, daughter of Sir Francis Floud. They had two sons. He served with the RAF during the Second World War. 
In 1946 Du Sautoy joined the publishers Faber and Faber; his aptitude for administration quickly led to his becoming general manager of the company. The founders and directors of the firm -- Geoffrey Faber, Richard de la Mare, and T. S. Eliot, all literary figures and writers in their own right -- devolved much of the responsibility for running the business onto him. He was promoted to the board later in the same year, and he took over the development of their activities in the United States, and the rights and contracts portfolios. Although he enjoyed the literary atmosphere of the firm and the meetings of the book committee, he also gave his time to other sides of the Faber list (which provided much of their profits), such as medicine and nursing, so that this shy and fastidious man sometimes found himself at nursing exhibitions, selling books on gynaecology to midwives. During his early years with Faber, he was reticent on policy matters, accepting the decisions of his eminent colleagues. He kept up a voluminous correspondence with authors, but did not try to write creatively himself, observing on occasion that a publisher had to be more of a politician than an artist. But from the beginning he involved himself in editorial work, taking a particular interest in the poetry list, and he succeeded Eliot as poetry editor. When he became vice-chairman of the firm in 1960, and chairman in 1971, he felt more free to decide the character of the house, and to introduce more variety into the catalogue. He expanded the juvenile list, and started Faber Music, which was run by a new generation of musical scholars, notably Donald Mitchell, who brought Benjamin Britten's music to the firm. Du Sautoy commented that the atmosphere of this new branch was akin to the excitement of the early days of Faber in literature. 
Du Sautoy was trusted by both writers and publishers, and faithfully carried out his instructions where he was given posthumous responsibility. He destroyed T. S. Eliot's private correspondence after the poet's death, as he had been asked to do, to the great chagrin of Eliot's biographers. He also administered the estates of Ezra Pound and James Joyce, and was involved in textual controversies over the latter. A strong supporter of the net book agreement, which for most of the twentieth century protected publishers and booksellers from competition, thereby ensuring a rich literary culture and enabling slower-selling books to remain longer in print, he gave evidence in 1962 before the restrictive practices court, and was active in many book-trade causes. On behalf of the Publishers' Association he travelled with many delegations to other countries. For these activities he received the OBE in 1964 and the CBE in 1971. 
Du Sautoy retired from active participation in the firm in 1975, although he remained chairman until 1977. He was sometimes asked to arbitrate in disputes that arose among other publishers who did not want to go to law. He was eminently fair and imaginative in such matters, and proved that he would have made an excellent judge. He retired to Aldeburgh in Suffolk where he became an active member of the Aldeburgh Festival committee, which enabled him to indulge his taste for music, and brought his talent for decision making once again into play. He chaired conferences and lectures there, and derived great pleasure from the many activities of the festival, which went through a difficult period after Britten's death in 1976: Du Sautoy's firm presence on the board was a major, but under-appreciated, factor in the festival's survival. He also played a part in literary events in Suffolk, and became president of the Ipswich and Suffolk Book League. He died at his home, 31 Lee Road, Aldeburgh, on 17 July 1995, survived by his wife. He left an extensive correspondence and a number of penetrating essays, and a reputation as one of the last of the gentlemen publishers.

Ennals, David Hedley, Baron Ennals (1922-1995), politician, was born at Walden, Mellish Road, Walsall, Staffordshire, on 19 August 1922, the second of the three sons of Arthur Ford Ennals, master draper and subsequently funeral director, and his wife, Jessie Edith, 'nee' Taylor. He was brought up in a devoutly Baptist family and all three brothers were to fill significant public roles: all were concerned with the plight of the less privileged, and each had a strong interest in international affairs. Like his two brothers, Ennals was educated at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall. He left having gained an English Speaking Union scholarship to the Loomis Institute in Connecticut, USA. On his return he worked as a journalist for the 'Wolverhampton Express and Star' until he was old enough to enlist with the Staffordshire regiment. In the invasion of Normandy he served in the Reconnaissance Corps. He was wounded, captured, and held in a German prison hospital, reaching home in 1946 after a long period when he was missing, presumed dead. While recovering from his injuries, especially to his right arm which never fully recovered, he worked as a regional officer for the United Nations Association. 
In 1947 Ennals became secretary of the Council for Education in World Citizenship. He stood as a Liberal candidate for Richmond but failed to get elected in 1950 and 1951. On 10 June 1950 he married Eleanor Maud Caddick ('b'. 1924/5), secretary, daughter of Reginald Victor Caddick, company director; there were three sons and a daughter of the marriage. In 1952 Ennals became secretary of the United Nations Association (1952-7). In this post he showed great energy and raised its profile at a time when there were few competing internationally focused pressure groups. It was his work there that helped him gain his next position, as secretary to the international department of the Labour Party's head office at Transport House, in 1957. This was almost a one-man band, so limited were the party's resources at that time. It was also a period when the great debate about nuclear disarmament nearly tore the party asunder. Labour was in opposition throughout this period, so Ennals was its main source of professional advice on British foreign policy. He managed to chart a difficult path between the entrenched party groups. He wrote the chapters in the briefing book for Labour candidates before the 1964 general election, 'Twelve Wasted Years' (1963). It was characteristic that he devoted a whole chapter in the brief space allotted to international affairs to the United Nations. 'It has thus been the Party's policy constantly to urge an 'increase in the authority of the United Nations' -- not as an end in itself but as a step toward eventual world government' ('Twelve Wasted Years', 369). This probably captured Ennals's central, driving utopian dream. 
Ennals became Labour MP for Dover in October 1964, a victory that reflected a prodigious amount of constituency work. Both his own majority and that of Labour nationally were tiny. In March 1966 the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, won a much larger majority. Ennals was one of the few new MPs to be given a junior ministerial post in the new government, being made parliamentary under-secretary of state for the army (1966-7). He was well fitted for this post. He was then moved to a similar position in the Home Office (1967-8), where he was deputy to James Callaghan and had to take responsibility for the 'Commonwealth Immigrants Act' (1968) limiting the entry of east African Asians. It caused Ennals considerable personal and family discomfort. His younger brother, Martin, fought the measure. His next post was that of minister of state (1968-70) at the new Department of Health and Social Security. The secretary of state, Richard Crossman, saw Ennals as extremely hard working and loyal. Then came the June 1970 election, Labour's defeat, and the loss of Ennals's own seat. He went back to a campaigning job, this time as campaigning director of the National Association for Mental Health (later renamed MIND). 
In February 1974 Ennals was elected Labour MP for Norwich North. He returned to his old interests as minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1974-6). There he dealt with a wide range of issues and showed himself assured and informed. This was the nearest he was to get to what must have been his ultimate ambition -- to be foreign secretary. He had risen steadily and was now just one rung below that coveted position. It was not to be. Wilson resigned as prime minister in April 1976 and James Callaghan took his place. Ennals had supported Callaghan in his leadership bid but he was not rewarded with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Instead he went to the Department of Health and Social Security, as secretary of state (1976-9). This was the peak of his career but it was also a painful and difficult period. The economic crisis, and the International Monetary Fund visit and its aftermath, left the Labour government with little choice but to constrain severely public spending. Ennals was a surprise replacement for Barbara Castle, who had carried through some major reforms -- to pensions, to the National Health Service, and to the benefits system, introducing a cash benefit for all children paid to the mother (child benefit). This was at a period when the government was seeking to impose strict limits on wage increases. The chancellor (Denis Healey) and the prime minister became convinced that the loss of child tax allowances and the reduction in take-home pay this involved would fatally undermine the pay policy. They had been told as much by trade union leaders, they claimed. The cabinet decided to limit drastically the new child benefit scheme. Ennals's first major announcement as secretary of state was the backtracking on this major reform, which was the pride of Barbara Castle. She put on one of her most devastating performances in the House of Commons, attacking his announcement as 'an abandonment of one of this Party's major reforms' ('Hansard 5C', 912, 1975-6, 287). The contents of the cabinet discussion were leaked and published in 'New Society'. This provoked a furious row within the Labour Party, with Barbara Castle leading the attack, and with the opposition able to quote freely from attacks by the Child Poverty Action Group. Ennals also conspicuously failed to implement Castle's policy restricting the number of private pay beds in the National Health Service. Meanwhile, the limits on public-sector pay were increasingly opposed by health service unions. Ennals personally intervened to try to stop ambulance workers ceasing even to meet emergency calls. An agreement was reached with union leaders, but it was rejected by local branches. He himself was ill during much of this period. In March 1979, before he was to meet the unions again, he was taken into Westminster Hospital with leg thrombosis. He was refused tea, mail, and other services by the ancillary workers' union. Only a few weeks later the Labour Party lost the general election called as a result of the no-confidence vote largely prompted by the 'winter of discontent'. It was a sad end to such a promising and idealistic ministerial career. Just before leaving office, however, Ennals did appoint the Black committee, whose report on health inequalities was to become a landmark. 
Ennals's first marriage ended in divorce in 1977, and on 4 July the same year he married (Katherine) Gene Tranoy ('b'. 1926/7), a divorced schoolteacher, and daughter of Walter Eugene Wilkins, consultant surgeon. Following the 1979 general election Ennals remained on the back-benches. He lost his seat in the June 1983 election, whereupon he was made a life peer, as Baron Ennals of Norwich. He was for many years his party's health spokesman in the House of Lords, and was a prominent supporter of a wide range of liberal causes. He was chairman of the Gandhi Foundation (1984-95) and of the Children's Medical Charity (1984-95), and president of the Tibet Society (1988-95) and of MIND (1989-95). He died of pancreatic cancer at his home, the Garden Flat, 6 Glenloch Road, Belsize Park, London, on 17 June 1995. He was survived by his second wife and the four children of his first marriage. Phuoc Ky Ennals, a Vietnamese orphan whom Ennals had informally adopted in 1975, predeceased him in 1993, as a result of an accident on an army firing range.

Everett, Kenny (1944-1995), broadcaster and comedian, was born on 25 December 1944 at 14 Hereford Road, Seaforth, Liverpool, the son of Thomas Cole, Mersey tugboat mate and later tugboat captain, and his wife, Elizabeth Margaret, 'nee' Haugh. He was educated at St Bede's secondary modern school, Liverpool. While growing up he was inspired by radio comedy, especially wacky programmes such as 'The Goon Show', and developed a talent for mimicry. On leaving school he worked in a bakery, where he cleaned sausage-roll trays for three months, before joining an advertising agency and, two years later, moving on to the advertisement department of a shipping publication, the 'Journal of Commerce'. Longing to break into radio, he bought two tape recorders and started to make his own programmes of music and comic monologues, drawing on the style of BBC Light Programme host John Jackson, who skilfully edited clips from comedy albums. After he sent a tape to the BBC 'The Maurice Cole Quarter of an Hour Show' was broadcast on the Home Service programme 'Midweek', with the young hopeful being interviewed by its presenter, Ronald Fletcher. However, Cole failed to impress producer Derek Chinnery at a subsequent audition, and he returned to Liverpool. Hoping that the independent pirate stations might be more sympathetic to his irreverent style, he sent the same tape to the original Radio London and was immediately taken on as a disc jockey, at $15 a week. Radio Luxemburg and offshore pirates such as Radio Caroline and Radio London were giving young people who had grown up since the Second World War the pop music they wanted, in sharp contrast to the BBC's stuffier approach. 
Like other pirate radio disc jockeys at Radio London such as Ed Stewart, Dave Cash, and Pete Brady, who all later joined BBC Radio 1, Cole had to change his name for legal reasons. As a result he became Kenny Everett, after an American film comedy star named Edward Everett Horton, and began a controversial broadcasting career that combined inventive brilliance with unremitting disrespect, which frequently landed him in trouble. His time at Radio London was short as a result of his sacking for criticizing the sponsor of the station's evangelist programme, 'The World Tomorrow'. However, after a short time at Radio Luxemburg, he once again sought to work for the BBC, at a time when it was planning the launch of Radio 1, Britain's first land-based pop station, and the government was outlawing the pirates through the 'Marine Offences Act'. In May 1967 he was heard reviewing the Beatles' classic album 'Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' for the BBC's Light Programme, which four months later was turned into the new Radio 1 and Radio 2. Everett, who along with other former pirate disc jockeys joined Radio 1, presented the Wednesday edition of 'Midday Spin' before hosting his own Sunday-morning show, and in 1968 landed a 45 minute weekday evening programme, 'Foreverett'. When that finished after five months, he presented a Saturday-morning programme. However, he upset his bosses again when in 1970 he made a quip about the transport minister John Peyton's wife, Mary, who had just passed her driving test -- 'probably slipping the examiner a fiver', he jested. He was sacked but two years later was asked to return to the BBC to present a Saturday-morning show for Radio 1, which was safely recorded at his studio in Wales the previous day, ensuring that nothing offensive would slip into the programme. In 1969 he married Lee Middleton, with whom he co-authored 'The Lee and Kenny Everett Cookery Book' (1976). There were no children of the marriage. 
Everett was let out of the BBC's straitjacket when he joined Capital Radio in London, which started broadcasting as the first independent pop music station in Britain, in October 1973. He landed the plum job of presenting the breakfast show and revived his Radio London partnership of the 1960s with Dave Cash by teaming up with him again in 'The Kenny and Cash Show', an early treat for listeners to the new commercial station. Eighteen months after joining Capital he took an overdose of Mandrax, which he used as a sleeping pill, although he admitted in his autobiography, 'The Custard Stops at Hatfield' (1982), that he had been taking drugs and drinking since the 1960s. He moved to weekend shows on Capital until his departure from the station in 1980. During his time there he created the serial 'Captain Kremmen', whose hero waged intergalactic battles with the man-eating Krells. This space cowboy was inspired by Everett's childhood memories of comic-book superheroes such as Dan Dare and Flash Gordon. 
Everett's next step was into television. He had previously co-presented the 1968 series 'Nice Time' with Jonathan Routh and Germaine Greer and hosted his own programme, 'The Kenny Everett Explosion', in 1970, as well as being the voice behind the prizes in Bob Monkhouse's noughts-and-crosses game show, 'Celebrity Squares'. But he made his biggest impression to date in 'The Kenny Everett Video Show' (1978-80) on ITV, featuring electronic trickery and madcap sketches in which he unleashed such characters as leather-clad biker Sid Snot and fastidious hair stylist Marcel Wave, as well as a cartoon-strip serial of Captain Kremmen. They were accompanied by Arlene Phillips's scantily clad, raunchy dance troupe Hot Gossip, and the buxom Miss Whiplash, played by Cleo Rocos. The programme won international awards and Everett's voice helped another television game show to success, with the launch in 1979 of 'Blankety Blank', hosted by Terry Wogan. After another ITV show, 'The Kenny Everett Video Cassette' (1981), the zany star switched channels to the BBC for 'The Kenny Everett Television Show', subsequently retitled 'The Kenny Everett Show' (1982-8). Although the programme lost the bite of the original ITV series -- the equivalent of switching from Radio 1 to Radio 2 -- Everett still attracted audiences of up to 15 million with a repertoire of characters that now included the skinhead yob Gizzard Puke, Beau D'Iddley of the foreign legion, and drag starlet Cupid Stunt, complete with latex boobs. Everett insisted throughout that it was 'all done in the best possible taste', a line from the mouth of Cupid, who would cross her legs with a total lack of discretion. Another new creation in the BBC series was the 'Bee Gees', with Everett playing all three pop star brothers as well as the interviewer asking them questions, which were answered with lines from their songs: 'How do you sell so many records?' -- 'Because we're living in a world of fools'. 
Lending his support to the Conservative Party during the 1983 British general election campaign, Everett caused uproar with his call of 'Let's bomb Russia!' as he took to the stage at a Young Conservatives' rally. This error of judgement, followed by a threat to kick away Labour Party leader Michael Foot's walking stick, led to widespread criticism and his own vow to keep out of politics in future. One new experience for him was acting in a feature film, playing a tin-legged, schizoid scientist investigating a sinister manor house in the spoof horror picture 'Blood Bath at the House of Death' (1983). When Everett's television series finally finished, his screen profile diminished, although he hosted the science-based quiz 'Brainstorm' (1988) and the daytime quiz show 'Gibberish'. By then he had once more returned to and left BBC radio. Presenting a Radio 2 show, he was again sacked in 1984, this time for telling an offensive joke about the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Four years later he experienced another revival when he joined the newly launched Capital Gold, playing classic pop hits on the London station that also hired former Radio 1 disc jockeys Tony Blackburn and David Hamilton. Everett savoured his six years with the station and enjoyed his longest run in a daily radio show. In 1991 he also took to the West End stage as the Billiard Marker in composer Mike Batt's short-lived musical 'The Hunting of the Snark', based on Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem and performed at the Prince Edward Theatre. In 1994 Everett's contribution to broadcasting was recognized with a gold award from the Sony Radio Awards judges, who noted that his comic talent and wacky style had 'consistently bewitched audiences'. 
Everett left Capital in 1994 after being diagnosed with AIDS, having known that he was HIV-positive since 1989. His marriage to Lee Middleton was dissolved in 1984 and he subsequently lived with a former Soviet Red Army soldier, Nikolay Grishanovich, who died of AIDS in 1991. Everett died of AIDS-related bronchopneumonia on 4 April 1995 at his home, 91 Lexham Gardens, Kensington, London, and was cremated following a funeral service at the church of the Immaculate Conception, Mayfair, on 10 April.

Fisher, Patricia, Lady Fisher (1921-1995), politician and charity worker, was born on 5 April 1921, the only child of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Walter Dorling Smiles (1883-1953) of Portavo Point, Donaghadee, co. Down, politician, and his wife, Margaret, 'nee' Heighway, of Manchester. She was the great-granddaughter of Samuel Smiles, author of 'Self-Help', and her great-aunt was Isabella Beeton, the cookery writer. Walter Smiles's career exporting tea took the family to Assam in the 1920s before he returned to Britain and entered parliament as Conservative MP for Blackburn (1931-45), then Ulster Unionist MP for County Down (1945-50) and North Down (1950-53). Her education was completed in London at Bangor collegiate school and Glendower School, and over a two-year period in Florence, Lausanne, Munich, and Paris, where she learned the local languages. During the war she worked at London's Ulster Canteen and at a children's hospital in Northern Ireland. While working there she met Captain Neville Montagu Ford (1906-2000), a professional cricket player and son of the Revd Dr Lionel Ford, headmaster of Harrow School and dean of York. They married on 22 February 1941 in the presence of the prime minister of Northern Ireland. 
Patsie Ford, as she was known, lived in Cheshire with her husband and two daughters, but after her father drowned on the 'Princess Victoria' in January 1953 she was nominated as the Unionist candidate for his constituency of North Down. Her unopposed return made her Northern Ireland's first woman MP. Few women had succeeded in the martial world of Northern Irish politics and it was unsurprising that its first woman MP was chosen in succession to a male relative. She had worked on her father's campaigns but was an inexperienced public speaker and so took lessons. Unfortunately in her maiden speech to the house she had to apologize for her 'Sunday Express' article on an all-night sitting, which mentioned finding Bessie Braddock and Edith Summerskill napping on two beds in the lady members' room and snoring. The matter was referred to the committee of privileges, which decided that new members deserved latitude, and her apology sufficed. 
Patricia Ford's later speeches focused on Northern Irish issues, such as pensions for Royal Irish Constabulary widows, and she strongly supported equal pay. In 1954 she and three other women MPs rode suffrage-era horse-drawn carriages to parliament and delivered a massive equal pay petition. She joined the House of Commons Yacht Club and pursued the pastime that she had begun at Donaghadee. A keen sportswoman who enjoyed golf, tennis, skiing, and skating, she was at nearly 6 feet the tallest woman MP. Her public-speaking instructor praised her musical voice, and she was known for her vivacity, free spirit, and irreverent sense of humour. With this temperament she may have found parliament uncongenial, particularly after her inauspicious debut, and she disliked the juvenile incivility of many male MPs. She stood down in May 1955 but remained politically connected by marrying the Conservative MP Nigel Thomas Loveridge Fisher (1913-1996) on 28 August 1956, shortly after her first marriage had been dissolved. 
Nigel Fisher belonged to the Conservative Party's liberal wing and Patricia Fisher was of similar outlook. Her open-mindedness in attending a wedding at Brompton Oratory in 1962 prompted a highly publicized expulsion from the Loyal Orange lodge women's section, yet this willingness to reach across the sectarian divide enabled her to contribute more to society than she had done in politics. After visiting the devastated Catholic neighbourhood of Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in 1972 and seeing the dangers that mothers faced in raising their children she founded the Women Caring Trust to improve children's lives in areas racked by violence. Funding came partly from a national appeal, a charity shop in her husband's constituency of Surbiton, and an annual Lords versus Commons swimming contest. The trust supported mobile playbuses, integrated schools, youth clubs, holiday homes, and various classes for mothers and teenagers from both sides of the community. Noting that men had failed to resolve the Irish problem, Patricia Fisher hoped that women could succeed as peacemakers, and her own legacy was not only to brighten young lives but to foster tolerance and understanding among those who were to shape Northern Ireland's future. She served as co-chairman of the trust for nineteen years (sharing the duties with Catholic women) and was president from 1991 until her death, on 23 May 1995. She was survived by her husband, Sir Nigel Fisher, the two daughters of her first marriage, a stepson, and a stepdaughter.

Townsend, Peter Woolridge (1914-1995), air force officer and official in the royal household, was born in Burma on 22 November 1914, into the large family of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Copleston Townsend ('b'. 1864), an officer in the Indian army and district commissioner in Burma. He was educated at Haileybury College (which he loathed, and where he was remembered as shy and studious) before entering the Royal Air Force College at Cranwell in 1933. By the age of twenty-seven he held the rank of wing commander, and following the outbreak of the Second World War he proceeded to display gallantry of the highest order. Flying initially in a Hurricane, later in a Spitfire, he brought down the first German bomber to crash in England since the First World War, and in the space of three years he was mentioned in dispatches and received the DSO and the DFC and bar. He was ultimately promoted group captain. 
On 17 July 1941 Townsend married (Cecil) Rosemary Pawle (1921-2004), the daughter of Colonel Hanbury Pawle, of Widford, Hertfordshire. The marriage resulted in the birth of two sons, but it was soon under strain. Meanwhile, Townsend was seconded in 1944 on what was initially to have been a three-month appointment as an equerry to George VI. In 1947, his secondment having been extended (he eventually served at court for nine years), Townsend accompanied the king and queen and the two princesses on their strenuous tour of South Africa. There was at this time no question of any romance between Townsend and Princess Margaret ['see 'Margaret Rose, Princess]. After only three years with the king he was appointed CVO in recognition of his contribution to the success of the tour, and in 1950 he became deputy master of his majesty's household. Meanwhile, Townsend's marriage had ended in divorce, although he had been the 'innocent party'. 
On the death of George VI in 1952 Townsend moved to Clarence House as comptroller to Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, and was appointed an equerry to the new queen, Elizabeth II. Now in even closer proximity than before to Princess Margaret, who was also living at Clarence House, Townsend and the princess fell in love; the intimate nature of their relationship was provocatively broadcast to the world on coronation day 1953, when the princess brushed some fluff from Townsend's uniform. The man in whom Townsend chose to confide was Sir Alan Lascelles, private secretary to the king and someone who had played a prominent part only seventeen years before in the abdication crisis. 'Either you're mad or bad', Lascelles told him ('The Times', 21 June 1995). He was neither, and in later years, when Lascelles lived in retirement at Kensington Palace, Princess Margaret declined to speak to him on the grounds that she considered him to have been the man who had ruined her life. 
With memories of the abdication still raw, the establishment moved swiftly to separate the 38-year-old group captain and the 23-year-old princess, only third in line of succession to the throne. On the eve of a visit to Rhodesia by the queen mother and Princess Margaret, Townsend, instead of accompanying them, was whisked away to Brussels as air attache. Under the 'Royal Marriages Act' of 1772 Princess Margaret required the consent of the monarch to marry, and to her grandmother Queen Mary and to her mother the situation which had resulted in the abdication had been anathema. Such were the social rules at the time that as a divorcee Townsend would not even have been granted entrance to the royal enclosure at Ascot. A cooling-off period was the best the royal family could hope for at this stage, but Townsend and the princess remained in constant touch, with the princess turning for advice not to the impetuous archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, but to a young Cambridge chaplain, Simon Phipps, later bishop of Lincoln and godfather to her son. 
Although on attaining the age of twenty-five Princess Margaret could have sought the consent of parliament to her marriage had permission been withheld by the queen, there was never any question of such a constitutional hiatus; there was, indeed, no serious possibility of the marriage ever taking place without the princess renouncing her rights to the throne, which Townsend would never have allowed her to do. In 1955, with Townsend's support and in the face of intense press speculation, the princess issued a dignified announcement that 'mindful of the Church's teaching that marriage is indissoluble' she had decided not to marry Group Captain Townsend. The irony of her later failed marriage to Lord Snowdon only added poignancy to the memories of a genuine but sadly unrealistic love affair. 
Group Captain Peter Townsend left England shortly after the princess's announcement, and travelled round the world, working on a book, 'Earth my Friend', which was published in 1959. In the same year he made a second, very happy, marriage, to Marie-Luce Jamagne, the daughter of Franz Jamagne of Brussels, with whom he had a son and two daughters. He travelled extensively in Africa, India, South America, Canada, and the United States, and eventually settled down with his wife in France, where he commenced a successful career as a writer, producing a number of books about the battle of Britain and about the impact of war on the individual, and, in 1978, a balanced and charitable autobiography, 'Time and Chance'. Possessed of natural diffidence, generosity, charm, and the modesty that became a hero, he made no secret in old age of his relief that things had turned out the way they did. He died at his home, La Mare aux Oiseaux, Route des Grands Coins, St Leger-en-Yvelines, France, on 19 June 1995. He was survived by his wife, his two sons from his first marriage, and his three children from his second.

Charles Burrell (1847-1929), one of three sons who entered actively into the business in the 1870s. The younger Charles went to Thetford grammar school, and received some technical education at King's College, London. After initial training in the firm he became a general manager, steadily taking over more and more responsibility from his father. Under his leadership the firm grew from about 200 employees in 1870 to 400 in 1913, comfortably the largest employer in Thetford. Charles Burrell was a highly regarded local figure and, like his father, was engaged in the civic life of Thetford. He was elected to the council in 1874 and served continuously for the fifty-five years until his death, in later years as an alderman. He was mayor seven times, and was a justice of the peace for the borough and the county. He was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and of the council of the Smithfield Club from 1916 to 1925. He was married twice, in 1873 to Sarah Annie Thomas (died 1910) and in 1912 to Annie Phillis Wilberforce (who survived her husband). He died at Thetford on 12 November 1929.

Robert George Burrell (1849-1904) was sales director for the family firm and travelled extensively throughout Europe and Russia between 1875 and the 1890s, when heart disease began to restrict his activities. He was also active in the town, and was elected to the borough council in 1882. Robert Burrell served as mayor for three years consecutively (1888-91) and became an alderman in 1901. He was a justice of the peace for the borough, and a major in the Norfolk Volunteers. He was president of the local Conservative association from 1885 to 1898, and his involvement in local charities included the governorship of Thetford School and the hospital foundation. In 1882 he married Ellen Alborough Cockayne (who survived her husband). Robert Burrell died from a heart attack on 7 September 1904.

Frederick John Burrell (1855-1927) was the third son of Charles Burrell the elder to become active in the firm, and he was the one who inherited the family's technical genius to fullest measure. Most of the technical developments and soundness of the engineering of Burrell products in the 1880s and 1890s were due to him. His inventiveness was not confined to his own firm's products. Among the patents registered in Frederick's name were those for a machine for freezing ice cream, a bacon-slicing machine, and burglar-proof fasteners for sash windows. He was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He had an unhappy marriage, and from the late 1890s his health deteriorated. His involvement with the management of the firm ceased about 1900, and he died of pneumonia on 15 October 1927, at St Andrew's Hospital, Thorpe, Norfolk. 
From modest beginnings as a country firm repairing agricultural implements, Charles Burrell & Sons Ltd had, by the end of the nineteenth century, become an important manufacturer of agricultural machinery. The steam engines developed by Charles and his sons were well known throughout Europe, and their traction engines and road locomotives were especially popular with travelling showmen. However, Burrells remained a modest enterprise compared with such competitors as Aveling and Porter Ltd and John Fowler & Co. (Leeds) Ltd; and the retirement of Charles Burrell the younger, soon after the end of the First World War, led to the firm's being taken over by Agricultural and General Engineers Ltd.

Richard [ii] Garrett (1779-1837), who was born on 4 August 1779 at Leiston, took over the management of the forge in 1805. In 1806 he married Sarah, daughter of John Balls of Hethersett, near Norwich. This match was of great significance for Garrett's business, for John Balls was the designer of improved threshing machines that used an open drum with beater bars, a principle of operation that became standard. The couple had three sons, Richard ['see below'], Balls, and Newson. Garrett and his father-in-law began to manufacture threshing machines at Leiston and the firm began to grow. By the time Garrett died (on 6 June 1837 at Leiston) there were about sixty employees.

Richard [iii] Garrett (1807-1866) was born on 1 February 1807, also at Leiston. Aged only nineteen he took over responsibility for the finances of the engineering works in 1826. Ten years later he took over general management of the business from his father. Under his direction the firm became one of the leading agricultural engineers of East Anglia, employing about 500 people in the 1850s. In consequence the family advanced from being well-to-do tradesmen to respectable gentlemen-manufacturers. The design of threshing machines continued to develop, with the introduction of portable machines. Garretts started to produce steam engines to provide power for their threshing machines. Two other products for which Garretts became especially noted during the mid-nineteenth century were seed drills and horse hoes. Later machinery included traction engines for ploughing, and also steamrollers; the latter began to carry the distinctive Garrett trade mark on their funnels: a prancing horse in gleaming brass. Machinery from the Leiston works was exported worldwide, and sales were particularly good in Germany and Russia. 
Leiston, near the Suffolk coast, was fairly isolated as the base for an agricultural engineering concern of national renown, and to counteract this Richard [iii] Garrett joined the promoters of the East Suffolk Railway. This railway company built the branch line, opened in 1859, that connected Leiston to the national network. Another of his business interests was the Camden Brewery, in north London, which he had founded. He was also involved in the discussions that led to the foundation of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and served as a member of the society's council from 1846 to 1856. Garrett married Elizabeth Dunnell in 1828. They subsequently moved from Leiston to live at Carlton Hall, Saxmundham. He served as justice of the peace and as deputy lieutenant for the county. In 1855 he retired from management of the engineering works, though remaining a partner, and moved to St John's Wood, London. He died on 26 June 1866 at Carlton Hall and was buried in Carlton churchyard.

He was born at Woodbridge, Suffolk, on 12 October 1757, and at the age of twenty-one set up on his own account at nearby Leiston as a bladesmith. It was a small-scale business, making principally sickles and employing at most eight to ten men. He married Elizabeth Newson in 1778, and they had at least one son. In 1805 Garrett retired from this business and worked as a farmer until his death at Leiston, on 20 September 1839.

Garrett, Newson (1812-1893), maltster and brewer, was born on 31 July 1812 at Leiston, Suffolk, the third son of Richard Garrett (1779-1837) ['see under 'Garrett family], agricultural engineer, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of John Balls, engineer, of Hethersett, Norfolk. Educated at Grundisburgh School, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, Newson had little interest in his studies. 
An ambitious young man, determined not to be overshadowed by his eldest brother, Richard Garrett (1807-1866) ['see under 'Garrett family] -- who was to inherit the family business -- Newson Garrett subsequently moved to London. Here he was befriended by Richard's father-in-law, John Dunnell, landlord of The Beehive inn, Crawford Street, Marylebone. On 5 April 1834 Garrett married his younger daughter, Louisa (1813-1903) and for seven years managed Dunnell's pawnbrokers shops; first at 1 Commercial Road, Whitechapel, then, from 1838, at 142 Long Acre, off St Martin's Lane, Westminster. However, after the death in 1838 of their third child, Garrett decided to return to the healthier climate of Suffolk. Three years later he purchased the Snape corn and coal merchant's business and shipping interests of Robert Fennel and settled his wife and young family at The Uplands, in Aldeburgh. 
Newson Garrett's business grew apace. Within three years he was sending about 17,000 quarters of barley to London and Newcastle. He was soon building his own barges and in 1848 was appointed agent for Lloyds. He constructed a gasworks, acquired a local brickworks and built numerous cottages. In 1852 he built Alde House, an impressive mansion overlooking the town of Aldeburgh (complete with ice-house and turkish bath), and two years later designed and built maltings at Snape Bridge. In 1859 the capacity of the maltings was doubled, and the adjoining Bridge House, the family's winter residence during the malting season, completed. Despite his substantial shipping interests -- he owned half the twenty-four ships in the port -- Garrett was keenly aware of the potential of the railways and, by guaranteeing regular freight, persuaded the East Suffolk Railway Company to extend a private line to his maltings. Finally, to consolidate his interests, he became a partner in the Bow brewery, London. When in 1882 the brewing company (one of the earliest to take company status) was registered as Smith, Garrett & Co. Ltd, with a capital of $450,000, Newson and his son Edmund (who managed the brewery), were among its first directors. Shortly after, the malting business of Newson Garrett & Son was similarly incorporated, with Garrett and his youngest son, George (the manager) as directors. 
Newson Garrett, fair-haired and blue-eyed, was strikingly handsome, self-confident, and impetuous. Indeed, according to one contemporary, 'none of his virtues were passive' (Manton, 29). Intense rivalry with his brother Richard, fuelled by the shift in Garrett's political allegiance from Conservative to Liberal radical, culminated in a bitter rift. Despite the fact that their wives were sisters, they are said not to have spoken to each other for thirty years. Newson Garrett's involvement in civic life was equally stormy. He served the Aldeburgh corporation (a self-elected body until 1885) as burgess and, for forty years, as bailiff. Many of the older members resented the pushy newcomer; in particular his altercations with the rector of Aldeburgh and frequent defection to the Union Chapel were both a scandal and delight to the town. Yet he was regarded with affection and respect. When, following the report on the 1880 'Municipal Corporation Act', the corporation was reformed, Garrett was elected its first mayor, serving again in 1886 and 1890 and as alderman, 1888-93. He was also Aldeburgh's first county councillor and alderman, 1889-92. He was a justice of the peace, commanding-lieutenant of the local volunteer company, branch-chairman of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and founder of the Adair Lodge of freemasons. 
Newson and Louisa Garrett's large family of ten surviving children inherited intellect and determination in full measure. Three of their six daughters achieved notable firsts: Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was Britain's first legally qualified woman doctor; Millicent Fawcett, first president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies; and Agnes Garrett, London's first woman interior designer. Notably, their brother Sam, president of the Law Society, was the first to employ female pupils. Among Garrett's grandchildren, Millicent's daughter, Phillippa, and Alice's son, Philip Cowell, were both senior wrangler at Cambridge University. To them all, Newson gave his wholehearted support and was fiercely proud of their success. At every opportunity he gathered them round him. Typically, he laid out the 35 acres surrounding Alde House as a private estate of large houses and gardens for his children. Newson Garrett died at Alde House on 4 May 1893 following a heart attack and was buried four days later in the family vault at Aldeburgh churchyard. The maltings at Snape subsequently formed the venue for the Aldeburgh music festival founded by Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears.

Bacon, Thomas (1700?-1768), Church of England clergyman and musician, was probably born either in the Isle of Man or Cumberland. He had at least one brother. He is known to have been in charge of a coal depot in Dublin in 1737, the year in which he published 'A Compleat System of the Revenue of Ireland'. In the same year he married a widow who kept a Dublin coffee house in Essex Street; this became known as Bacon's Coffee House. 
In January 1742 Bacon established a newspaper, the 'Dublin Mercury', at the coffee house premises. Samuel Richardson's novel 'Pamela' was first advertised in Ireland in this newspaper, and on 10 April 1742 it announced the first public performance of Handel's 'Messiah'; the performance was reviewed in a later issue. In September 1742 Bacon received authorization to print the 'Dublin Gazette', the official newspaper of Ireland, but in July 1743 he ceased its publication without giving prior notice. 
Soon after abandoning publishing Bacon studied for holy orders with Thomas Wilson, the bishop of Sodor and Man, his aim being to emigrate to Maryland, where his brother Anthony had prospered as a merchant. He was ordained deacon by Wilson on 23 September 1744 and as priest on 10 March 1745. Anthony Bacon returned to England in 1748, and traded successfully in London. 
Accompanied by his wife and son John (Jacky), Thomas Bacon left the Isle of Man in June 1745 and arrived in Maryland in August or September. He took up residence in Talbot county, located on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay, and there served as curate of St Peter's parish until his appointment as rector in March 1746. It was there that he began to make a name for himself, not only as a clergyman, but also as a musician and composer. Bacon was an excellent violinist and cellist, and enjoyed visiting the homes of friends for dinner, discussion, and music. He often crossed Chesapeake Bay to visit Annapolis, the capital of Maryland, and the site of much social activity. He became an honorary member and chief musician of the Tuesday Club, a very exclusive group of men. Bacon composed several 'birthday odes' and occasional music for the club, and was dubbed 'Signior ('sic') Lardini', a pun on his surname. He remained chief musician until 1754. 
As a clergyman Bacon especially espoused social reform and was an advocate of education for poor children and slaves. At St Peter's parish he preached several sermons between 1749 and 1753 which were published and sold in aid of establishing a charity school. He even travelled to Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia, to solicit funds by preaching and performing. In May 1755 the building was completed, but the school never achieved success. 
The mid-1750s proved to be a turning point for Bacon. His wife died in 1755; he was charged with rape later that year (eventually he was acquitted); and his son was killed in the local wars against the French and Indians. In 1757 he married Elizabeth Bozman (died 21 July 1768), a parishioner from a nearby village. He had been the officiating priest at her marriage, only two years before, to the Revd Thomas Belchier, who was found to be a bigamist. However, Bacon married Elizabeth without previously publishing the banns of marriage and obtaining a marriage licence. He was indicted and fined, but the indictment was later dropped. 
Along with his wife and three daughters Bacon left Talbot county in 1758 for All Saints' parish, Frederick county, where he was asked to serve as curate; he did not become rector there until 1762. All Saints' was the most desirable living in Maryland, worth almost $1000 a year, and while there Bacon sought permission from the general assembly of the provincial government to compile and publish a new edition and index of colonial laws. However, though his 'Laws of Maryland' was completed in 1762, it was not printed until 1765. He made an unsuccessful attempt to commit the parish vestry to contributing to the establishment of a charity school in Frederick. By 1767 Bacon's health had declined badly; he died at Frederick, deeply in debt, on 26 May 1768. On that day John Cary wrote to Bacon's dear friend Walter Dulany that 'Our worthy, our good, and sincere friend, the Revd Mr. Bacon is now no more; he departed this life about ten minutes ago, sincerely lamented by all honest men here' (Dulany MS I, fol. 20).

Carte, Helen (1852-1913), businesswoman and theatre manager, was born on 12 May 1852, at Wigtown, Scotland, the second daughter of George Couper (or Cowper) Black (1820- 'c'.1874), procurator fiscal, and his wife, Ellen Barham (1823-1875?). Originally christened Susan Helen, she early reversed her names and later changed 'Black' to 'Lenoir', the original surname of the Black family in seventeenth-century France. 
Between 1871 and 1874 Helen Black passed with honours the examinations in mathematics, logic, and moral philosophy at the University of London, for which she was privately tutored since the university did not admit women to courses or degrees. When, around this time, her widowed mother emigrated to Australia, Helen stayed behind, first briefly as a teacher, then as an actress -- a strange choice for a woman as essentially shy and private as she. Nevertheless by 1877 as Helen Lenoir she had appeared at Dublin and Glasgow in 'The Great Divorce Case', and had been engaged to play in India. This engagement, however, was formally broken so that she could join Richard D'Oyly Carte's theatrical organization at the Opera Comique. 
As Carte's secretary, Helen soon proved indispensable. She was a 'workaholic', enjoying minutiae, even drudgery, as well as larger details of successively mounting operas by W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, of building the Savoy Theatre and the Savoy Hotel, into which she introduced the new hydraulic passenger lifts. She also assisted Carte in arranging American lecture tours for Oscar Wilde, Matthew Arnold (who called her Carte's 'American brain'), and others. As Carte's business associate, she frequently crossed the Atlantic to superintend American productions and tours of what became known as Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy Operas. In 1886 Carte raised Helen's salary to $1000 a year with an additional 10 per cent on net profits. When she demurred, he wrote, 'You know very well, and so do all those who know anything about my affairs, that I could not have done the business at all, at any rate on nothing like the same scale, without you' (D'Oyly Carte MSS). Eighteen months later on 12 April 1888 she became his second wife, Sir Arthur Sullivan acting as his best man. 
As the editor of 'The Era' wrote in Helen Carte's obituary, 'She never took advantage of anybody; but I never heard of her letting anybody take advantage of her' ('The Era'). Yet she was very tactful, maintaining a more or less even balance among the often conflicting temperaments of Gilbert, Sullivan, and Carte; dealing sympathetically with problems, personal and professional, of the D'Oyly Carte London and touring companies; always emending her typewritten letters by hand to show she had read them herself. 
In person Mrs Carte was small and slim, but very energetic. A dog lover, she was also so generous to humans that King George V conferred on her the order of the League of Mercy in 1912. James McNeill Whistler, one of her friends, did an etching of her and told her she was delightful. He himself mixed the paint for the Cartes' Adelphi Terrace flat, including his favourite yellow. 
During Carte's last, invalid years, Helen Carte oversaw every detail of their far-flung organization. Lonely after his death in 1901, she married Stanley Carr Boulter, a barrister, in 1902, but continued to use the name Carte for all her business dealings. Contemporary newspapers describe her on opening night of the 1906 revival of 'The Yeomen of the Guard', when she and Gilbert took three curtain calls: dressed in white, carrying white flowers, she peeped out shyly and trembled visibly at a 'hurricane' of applause. Illness prevented her from attending the last night of the 1909 Gilbert and Sullivan revivals, and she then gave up the management of the Savoy Theatre. 
After another illness lasting several months, Helen Carte died in London on 5 May 1913 of cerebral haemorrhage complicated by acute bronchitis. At her wish, her funeral at Golders Green crematorium on 7 May was private. She was perhaps the foremost businesswoman of her era.

Lane, Sarah (1822/3-1899), actress, playwright, and theatre manager, was born in the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, London, the daughter of William Borrow, cab proprietor, and of Sarah Fowles. She made her debut at sixteen, as a singer at the Ironmonger-Row Saloon in Clerkenwell. She is also reported to have performed at the Bedford Saloon in Camden Town. For most of her life she was identified with the Britannia Theatre in Hoxton, where she progressed from a player in a saloon to the actress, manager, and playwright known as the Queen of the Brit. 
In 1841 Samuel Haycraft Lane had opened the Britannia Saloon, where Sarah, under the name Sara Wilton, was engaged as a singer and actress in or about 1843. Following the death of Samuel Lane's first wife, he and Sarah married, probably in 1846; they had no children. During the following thirty years the Lanes built the Britannia into a large and increasingly 'respectable' venue. The saloon early on had something of an unsavoury reputation: a police report from 1844 insists that 'there can be no doubt that this place is calculated to corrupt the morals of the growing youth in that low and thickly populated neighbourhood' (TNA: PRO, LC 7/6). The saloon become a theatre in 1858, when it reopened in much-expanded and lavishly redecorated form, with a seating capacity of over 3000 and a reputation for good catering. During this time Sarah Lane became an enormously popular performer, known for saucy comic and melodramatic heroines. The 'Touchstone' reported that Lane was 'chiefly remarkable for the wonderful versatility of her powers' ('Touchstone, or, The New Era', 22 June 1878); 'The Era' observed that 'a collection of the pungent and sparkling figurative sayings which this lady is accustomed to utter in her different characters could make a considerably large and amusing book of proverbs, emblems, and repartees' ('The Era'). Lane's particular speciality was the feisty female who battled the villain, stepped out of her place, and wrought the happy ending. Typical is the role of Florence Langton in C. H. Hazlewood's 'Mother's Dying Child', 1864, who, repeatedly insisting 'my natural curiosity must be satisfied', adopts no fewer than four identities as she pursues the villain who threatens her family. 
The Lanes were quite prosperous by the 1860s, and spent a good deal of time and money yachting, travelling (during the summer months), and shopping. Sam Lane died in 1871; upon his death Sarah became the lessee of the Britannia Theatre, a position she held until her death in 1899. In running the theatre, Lane occasionally came into conflict with her nephew, A. L. Crauford, who replaced her as manager of the Britannia in 1882. In addition to acting and to managing the theatre, Lane also became a playwright -- she wrote eight plays for the Britannia between 1873 and 1881, usually adaptations from the French. By the mid-1880s she had ceased to be a regular performer at the Britannia, but she did continue to appear in the annual pantomime and in the Britannia Festival that closed the season in December. At the festival -- unique to the Britannia -- the members of the company would each appear in his or her most popular role of the season, and Sarah Lane would distribute gifts and be strewn with flowers. She made her last appearance at the Britannia during the annual festival performance in 1898. The pantomime remained to the end a great draw, attracting attention from West End critics such as George Bernard Shaw, who favourably compared the wit and wholesomeness of the Brit's pantomime to what he saw as the cynicism and lewdness of the 'expensively dreary' productions of the West End ('Saturday Review', 9 April 1898). 
In her later years Lane was much venerated in the Hoxton community, which had grown progressively poorer in the last decades of the century; she, by contrast, left a substantial personal estate. She died of dropsy, aged seventy-six, at 81 Finchley Road, London, on 16 August 1899, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.

Scott, Jane Margaret (bap. 1779, d. 1839), theatre manager and actress, one of at least four children of John Scott (1752-1838) and his wife, Elizabeth (1750-1829), was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 6 June 1779. Her father was a prosperous London 'watercolour preparer' who also sold optical instruments at 417 Strand. She was educated in music, and began her working life giving singing lessons. In 1804 John Scott converted a warehouse behind his shop for the performances of her and her pupils, and then demolished twelve properties in an adjoining alley, Bailey's Court, to erect the Sans Pareil Theatre (which later became the Adelphi). Here Jane Scott, like Charles Dibdin at his Sans Souci Theatre, offered a solo entertainment, singing her own compositions to her own piano accompaniment, varied with her father's light shows. They soon gathered a theatrical company; in 1806 the theatre was licensed for entertainments, in 1807 for pantomime, and by 1809 for burletta. 
Jane Scott's artistic ambition met the challenge of modern entertainment. She encouraged performers who went on to substantial careers, such as Caroline Giroux (Mrs Serle), George Davidge, and Richard Flexmore, and with her core company she participated in the development of new kinds of theatre. Almost the only personal information we have from a contemporary is that she was generous towards the work of others. She was artistic director, she performed leading roles, and she wrote prolifically: the bills often boasted that the whole evening's entertainment was written by her. In 1809 came her first burletta, 'Mary the Maid of the Inn', and in December 1810 a melodrama, 'Disappointments'; in 1811 she produced her first farce, 'The Animated Effigy', and a comic operetta, 'The Lowland Romp'. Between 1806 and 1819 she wrote more than fifty stage pieces, comic and serious, spectacular and simple. These included translations from the French ('The Conjuror', 1815) and French-style vaudeville ('The Dinner of Madelon', 1816), but also English farces ('Whackham and Windham', 1814), adaptations from the fiction of Maria Edgeworth and Walter Scott ('The Row of Ballynavogue', 1817; 'The Fire Goblin', 1819), history plays ('The Forest Knight', 1813), fairy plays ('Fairy Legends', 1818), topical plays ('The Fortunate Youth' 1818), and Gothic melodramas -- one with a subplot for the dancer Giroux ('Asgard the Demon Hunter', 1812), another with a leading role for herself ('Camilla the Amazon', 1817) -- and at least one pantomime each year, accommodating the skills of rope-walking monkeys and juvenile clog dancers. She wrote one melodrama, 'The Old Oak Chest' (1816), that was printed and widely staged beyond her own theatre. This play, a story of oppressive rulers and heroic pirates, was popular in the illegal cheap theatres that sprang up to challenge the beleaguered theatres royal. 
The Sans Pareil was itself politically significant: it was sanctioned by the lord chamberlain, Lord Dartmouth, and challenged the long-standing duopoly of the stage in London with new providers of entertainment. Jane Scott and her father, coming from outside the established theatrical networks, thus became participants in the battle for a 'free' stage. Jane Scott's theatre is also embedded in the artistic developments of her time, mediating Gothic and Romantic sensibility to pleasure-seekers in the nascent West End. She had her finger on the pulse of a new world of entertainment for all, and her management of the theatre she created is important for its responsive and intelligent reading of the new audiences and the provision of exciting work for them to enjoy. 
It is indicative of her practical, self-sufficient relationship to her work that Jane Scott never appeared elsewhere than in her own theatre, and when she retired in April 1819 (her father having sold the theatre at a handsome profit) she never appeared again, nor published any of her writing. On 11 April 1822 she married a half-pay naval officer, John Davies Middleton (1790-1867), and by the terms of her settlement was able to retire on a comfortable personal income to her own house, Mole House, Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father went on to buy the Olympic Theatre and thus to invest, from 1830, in the managerial talents of another woman, Madame Vestris. When he died in 1838 he left the Olympic (and an inn in Hersham) to his daughter. Jane Scott had no children. She died of breast cancer on 6 December 1839 in Walton-on-Thames and was buried in the family vault in the parish church of St Mary with St John. Her legacy of a model of theatre work radically different from the pompous vacuities of the 'legitimate' stage was long either vilified or ignored by critics and historians, and only began to be recognized at the end of the twentieth century.

Biggs, Matilda Ashurst (1816/17-1866), campaigner for women's rights and supporter of Italian independence, was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, the second daughter of William Henry Ashurst (d. 1855) and his wife, Elizabeth Ann Brown (died 1854), of Muswell Hill, Middlesex. Elizabeth Ann Ashurst (known as Eliza), Caroline Stansfeld, and Emilie Venturi were her sisters. Her father, a successful radical solicitor, held advanced views on the rights of women, and the household in which she and her sisters grew up was a centre of political discussion and activity on the radical causes of the day. On 11 October 1837 she married Joseph Biggs (1809-1895) ['see under 'Biggs, John (1801-1871)], the youngest brother and partner in the family hosiery firm in Leicester. The Biggs family had a reputation as progressive employers; Joseph's two elder brothers, John (1801-1871) and William (1805-1881), were prominent radical leaders in municipal politics, who became MPs, respectively, for Leicester (1856-62) and for Newport, Isle of Wight (1852-7). 
Matilda and Joseph Biggs settled in Leicester. Although the marriage was to produce four daughters Matilda's was not to be a life of quiet domesticity. She continued to share her family's interest in the anti-slavery question and attended the world anti-slavery convention in London in June 1844 with her father and sister Eliza. The exclusion of the American female delegation from participation in the proceedings led her to a lifelong interest in the political emancipation of her sex. During 1847 she circulated in Leicester one of the earliest printed leaflets in favour of female suffrage, sent to her by a fellow anti-slavery campaigner, Anne Knight (1786-1862). Later in 1859 Biggs openly criticized the Northern Reform Union's refusal to campaign on universal suffrage, writing to the 'Newcastle Chronicle': 'I feel it an injustice that I, who am equally taxed with men, should be denied a voice in making the laws which affect and dispose of my property, and made to support a State, where I am not recognised as a citizen... The Northern Reform Society, which takes its stand upon 'justice', should claim for us at least that we be exempted from the duties, if we are to be denied the rights belonging to citizens. (19 Feb 1859; Biggs, 839)' Biggs also sought to improve the condition of women through local philanthropy; together with her sister Emilie she established a rescue home for prostitutes in Leicester. 
The other great cause of Biggs's life, which she shared with her sisters, was that of an independent and unified Italian republic. Following Giuseppe Mazzini's introduction to the Ashurst family in 1844 she developed a long and close, if somewhat stormy, friendship with the Italian revolutionary, though she did not succumb to his religious ideals. Through her marriage she brought Mazzini into contact with the world of English provincial radicalism; his letters to her reveal her long-standing commitment to the cause of Italy through local fund-raising and propaganda activities. For a period in 1850 she was also actively involved in clandestine activity in the south of France. In order to finance republican ventures Mazzini started a scheme of selling bonds, redeemable by the future government of a liberated Italy. His fellow conspirator, Felice Orsini, was given the concession for Piedmont, and Biggs journeyed from England to help distribute the bonds among French and Italian sympathizers. She also accompanied Orsini with letters of introduction from Mazzini to encourage a common front among the leaders of the various national independence movements of Europe. After Orsini's arrest she raised funds on his behalf. 
In 1851, following a winter sojourn in Genoa with her sister Emilie, Biggs returned to England, where she and her sister were among the original seventy-five women who joined the council of the Society of the Friends of Italy. Thereafter her activities appear to have been confined to subscription campaigns and letter writing. In April 1854 Mazzini wrote to her: 'Go on you, and your pretty aides-de-camp, writing for Italy, and creating sympathies for a possible movement' ('Scritti', 52.116-17, 18 April 1854). During the Polish uprising of 1863 she pressed Mazzini to use his influence to bring aid to the insurgents but none was to be forthcoming. 
By 1852 Joseph Biggs had retired from business, probably owing to poor health, and the family moved to Barden Farm, near Tunbridge Wells. In the early 1860s Biggs & Sons Ltd came close to bankruptcy and the scale of business was drastically curtailed, with a consequent diminution in the family's income. Moreover, Matilda's health also was now failing. In July 1865 Mazzini wrote to Emilie, confirming that she was in the last stages of consumption: 'The first impression had been favourable; but long attentive watching makes me despair. I think she is glad of my visits' ('Letters to an English Family', 3.109). She died at Barden Farm on 15 October 1866 and was survived by her husband and four daughters. Little is known of the eldest, Elizabeth Ashurst Biggs (1838-1905), or of Ada ('b'. 1859), the youngest. The second child, Caroline Ashurst Biggs (1840-1889), became a prominent suffragist in her own right. 
The third daughter, 
Maude Ashurst Biggs was a longstanding member of the council of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland, which had been established under mainly aristocratic patronage in 1832 to provide material support to Polish emigres. Under the aegis of the association she published a pamphlet in 1886 entitled 'The Forgotten Nation'; in this she expressed support for the constitutional rather than revolutionary claims for a Polish nation, drawing attention to the continued religious persecution of Poles in the Russian territories and the Bismarckian programme of 'Germanization' in the Prussian provinces. This had resulted in the forced expatriation of many thousands of Poles with subject status in the Russian and Austrian territories. Some of these Poles had emigrated to London, where they received material help from the Literary Association alongside the dwindling number of emigres who had gone to England after the events of 1830 and 1863. 
During the late 1890s Biggs lived in Paris, where she was in contact with the close circle of Polish emigres, including Ladislas Mickiewicz, son of the famous poet. In 1898 they corresponded about the possibility of publishing the letters of Mazzini to her mother on the Polish cause. These were finally published in the 1920s by E. F. Richards in 'Mazzini's Letters to an English Family'. Biggs lived to witness the creation of a new Poland following the First World War. In 1920 she published a translation of a collection of Polish fairy tales and in 1924 she wrote a history of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland from 1832 to the present day. She maintained a watchful and maternal eye on developments in Poland during the last years of her life. Fearing the destruction of its primeval forests from economic development she wrote: 'as one to whom the national, romantic and poetic memories of Poland are hardly less dear than to the Poles themselves, I trust that they will not for the mere sake of material gain, suffer to perish all that natural beauty so deeply associated with the historic past and with the immortal memory of Mickiewicz, poet and patriot alike. ('The Times', 28 July 1924)' After her residence in Paris Biggs lived in Hampstead and later settled at Idbury Manor, Kingham, Oxfordshire. There she set up the Village Press, a small publishing house under whose imprint she published extracts of her father's diary of his journey to America in 1837, 'To America in Thirty-Nine Days: before Steamships Crossed the Atlantic', which remains a well written and interesting account of social and economic life in New York during the early mid-nineteenth century. Other titles that she published included a history of the Women's Institute by J. W. Robertson Scott and a volume of poems by Theo Varlet, translated by Malcolm McLaren. 
Biggs died, unmarried, at Idbury Manor on 14 July 1933. In keeping with her feminist heritage she made small bequests to the Society for the Employment of Women and to the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital for Women, as well as a legacy to the Home for Lost and Stray Cats, London.

Torr, Dona Ruth Anne (1883-1957), historian, was born on 28 April 1883 at Carlett Park, Eastham, Chester, the third daughter in the family of four daughters and two sons of William Edward Torr (1851-1924) and his wife, Julia Elizabeth Holmes. Her father, a clergyman, inherited the estate of Carlett Park, Eastham, Cheshire, in 1880, when he also became the vicar of Eastham. He was later an honorary canon of Chester Cathedral. Her second brother, William Wyndham Torr, became a brigadier and served as British military attache at several embassies. Scarcely anything more is known about her family. She seems to have kept her private self under a veil, and remained throughout a somewhat 'reticent' figure (Schwarz, 67). It may be guessed that, like a good many left-wing sectaries of her time, she inherited from a religious upbringing a Christian ethic of her own shaping. 
Dona Torr was growing up at a time when educated young women were beginning to strike out on their own. She was educated by private tuition at home at Carlett Park, but went on to study at Heidelberg and at University College, London, where she studied English and Greek philosophy. At University College between 1911 and 1914 she helped to organize student debates, was vice-president of the women's union committee, and was on the editorial board of the union magazine. Her wide education gave her a good knowledge of languages and the arts; in her youth she was also an enthusiast for horse-racing. She reacted strongly against the First World War and soon after the war joined the Labour Party. Her first employment was on the staff of the pro-Labour 'Daily Herald'. She became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain on its founding day, 31 July 1920, and proved an exemplary party member, taking on whatever responsibilities came her way, including editorial work on the party's weekly organ, 'Workers' Life', and acting as a translator at the Fifth Congress of the Communist International. In 1926 during the general strike she could be seen on a bicycle distributing leaflets. Unassuming on her own account, she could be a stickler for observance of party rules when she felt they were being neglected. She married one of her comrades, Walter Milton Holmes, a journalist; they were both given places on the colonial committee set up in 1925 to improve contacts with the small struggling communist parties or groups in India, Egypt, and elsewhere. 
Torr's own special interest was history, and a cluster of young historians in the party owed much to her encouragement. She helped to keep them from theorizing too much on mechanical lines, a temptation into which the Marxist concept of history-writing as a science has sometimes led its students. One initiative of hers was a plan for a series of small books made up of extracts from important Marxist texts. It was designed to show ordinary readers how great a part the people had played in events. Unluckily her own contribution, 'Marxism, Nationality and War', came out in 1940, when the party was committed -- an astounding 'volte-face' -- to the Moscow line of opposing war against Nazi Germany. 
Far more helpful were her translations from German. Here her biggest undertaking was an anthology of letters of Marx and Engels, to each other and to numerous friends. Her edition, which came out in 1934, shines by the way it turns into idiomatic English the colloquial writing of two foreigners, both gifted writers, who spent most of their lives in England. The volume is moreover an invaluable storehouse of Marxist thinking. But it was to the recent history of her own country, and the struggles of its working class, that Torr's thoughts were increasingly turning. She had begun early to plan a life-and-times, on a grand scale, of Tom Mann, one of the outstanding heroes of British labour, whom she came to know and greatly admired. He was remembered above all for leading the great London dock strike of 1889. It cost Torr twenty years to get a first volume nearly ready; by then some help was needed from two of her closest allies, Christopher Hill and A. L. Morton. It was a well-earned return for her generosity in helping other writers. 'Tom Mann and his Times' appeared in 1956. 
In 1954 a collection of essays, 'Democracy and the Labour Movement', edited by John Saville, was presented to Torr by some of the historians among whom she had worked. Its preface described her as 'a pervading influence for a whole generation of Marxist historians'. In July of that year a week-long conference on English history was held at Hastings, with many of her disciples among the participants. She was too unwell by then to be one of the speakers; someone carried away an image of her as a benign lady abbess among her flock. But nemesis was hanging over the party to which she had given so much. In 1956 the Hungarian rising against Soviet rule broke out, and was suppressed by force. The party leadership dutifully endorsed Moscow's mailed fist; a large minority of the membership refused to follow. The shock to Dona, still loyal to the old faith, must have been very severe. She died at Edgware General Hospital, Hendon, Middlesex, on 8 January 1957, and was cremated six days later at Golders Green. Her husband survived her. Their partnership had proved happy. Dona did most of her work at home, while Walter did most of the housework and all the cooking. The atmosphere was recalled by the historian Dorothy Thompson, a close friend who often stayed with them, as 'always warm and friendly' (private information).

Hodgkinson, George Edward (1893-1986), local politician, was born on 9 August 1893 at 21 Villa Street, Beeston, the eldest of four sons born to Walter Hodgkinson (1872- 'c'.1943), a lace-making-machine minder, and his wife, Charlotte Wormell (1876-1907). He attended Nether Street elementary school in Beeston until he was thirteen. After several jobs with engineering firms he enrolled for evening classes at Nottingham University and completed his engineering education at the Harris Institute in Preston. He was much influenced by the harsh working conditions he witnessed, and in 1913 he joined the Independent Labour Party and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers on the same day. 
In September 1914 Hodgkinson moved to Coventry, where he worked as a turner. On 26 December that year he married (Victoria) May Smith (1892/3-1925), daughter of Herbert Smith, waggon examiner. By 1915 he had become the leading shop steward at the Radford Daimler factory. In 1919 he was nominated for a place at Ruskin College, Oxford. His experiences there are vividly recorded in his surviving correspondence with his first wife. He returned to Coventry in 1920 to find his reputation as a shop steward had preceded him. He was often victimized, and, with a young family to support, he was driven to seeking poor relief before regaining employment with Daimler in January 1923. 
In October 1923 Hodgkinson began work as the full-time Coventry Labour Party agent. His dynamism helped transform the local party: the debt of $240 was cleared, women's sections were established, and the membership increased significantly. In 1936 Richard Crossman became the local Labour candidate. Crossman and Hodgkinson became close friends: Hodgkinson admired Crossman's intellect and energy, while Crossman learned much from Hodgkinson's expertise in party management. After the death of his first wife in 1925, Hodgkinson married, on 7 May 1927, Carrie Wilson (1895/6-1997), a tailor, daughter of Thomas Arthur Wilson, iron polisher. 
Hodgkinson's career in local government began in 1928 when he won the Radford ward. Nine years later, the Labour Party won control of Coventry council for the first time. He led the council for a year before making way for Sidney Stringer; between them, they dominated the Labour group. Hodgkinson played a pivotal role in co-ordinating the local response to the devastation caused by the German air raid on Coventry in November 1940. He was instrumental in restoring gas supplies and in establishing communal restaurants. After the war his enthusiasm for the bold changes envisaged by the city architect, Donald Gibson, helped persuade his fellow councillors to accept them. He was mayor of Coventry in 1944-5 and, as his membership of strategic committees continued unabated throughout the 1940s and 1950s, he played a major role in Coventry's post-war development. His hopes of a parliamentary seat were, however, dashed in 1945 when the Labour Party vetoed his nomination on the grounds that he was a paid official. In 1949 he was appointed OBE. 
Though Coventry council achieved much in the post-war period, there was a feeling that the local Labour Party was increasingly out of touch with the social trends of the 1950s. Hodgkinson's public pronouncements sometimes betrayed a hint of puritanism which sat uneasily with the prevailing mood of an age of increasing affluence. Although his ability to express his political views was circumscribed by his being a party agent, a position he finally relinquished in 1958, there is no doubt that his sympathies were with the left. 
Hodgkinson was a frequent visitor to eastern Europe after the war and deplored what he considered to be the crude distinctions made between the eastern bloc and western Europe. In 1967 he lost his council seat when Labour was swept from power in Coventry. His autobiography, written at Crossman's insistence, was published in 1970 and he continued to live an active life thereafter, particularly as a campaigner for international understanding. He was a genial, sincere man: a near teetotaller, he lived in a council house on principle until his death. He was an accomplished fisherman, who competed in the 1936 All England championships. His life was an epitome of dedication to the labour movement and its ideals. He died on arrival at Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital on 19 August 1986 as a result of a heart attack while at the wheel of his car; his body was cremated at Canley crematorium. He was survived by his wife, a daughter from his first marriage, and a son from his second.

Furlong, Alice Maud Mary (1871-1946), poet, was born on 17 January 1871 at Knocklaiquin Lodge, near Rathfarnham, co. Dublin, one of the four children of James Walter Furlong (died 1897) and his wife, Mary Josephine Murtagh (died 1897). Her father was a Wexford man and had at one stage been a leather merchant but later became the sporting editor of a Dublin newspaper. Her childhood was spent at Fernvale, Broohernabreena, Tallaght, in co. Dublin. 
Furlong's sister, Mary (1866-1898) was a published poet and Alice Furlong began to publish her own poems about 1892. Throughout her career her poems appeared in a number of newspapers and journals such as the 'Shan Van Vocht', the 'Irish Press', 'United Ireland', 'Sinn Fein' and the 'Weekly Independent'. Much of her work was published in the 'Irish Monthly'. The editor of that journal, Mathew Russell, took a keen interest in Furlong's work and was instrumental in having her first and only volume of poetry, 'Roses and Rue', published in 1899. It was well-received, one reviewer noting that it contained 'Irish poems inspired by passionate patriotism' (Russell, 393). Many of her poems were strongly nationalist and Catholic in flavour. Her second published volume was a book of Irish fairytales and mythology, 'Tales of Fairy Folks, Queens, and Heroes', which appeared in 1907. She was popular in her day; one obituarist went so far as to say that she 'was for some years supreme amongst the living poets of this century... it is not too much to claim that between the death of Yeats and her own she had a mastery of pure lyric song unequalled by any other Irish poet. (Little, 138)' Furlong lived near the writer Katharine Tynan and was also an acquaintance of the nationalist activists Maud Gonne and Jennie Wyse Power. The family home in Tallaght was the gathering place for a number of writers such as W. B. Yeats, Dora Sigerson, and the Fenian John O'Leary. Furlong was active in the Irish nationalist movement. She was elected vice-president of the ad hoc committee, later called the Patriotic Children's Treat Committee, which had been formed in 1900 in order to organize a treat for those children who had not attended that arranged on the visit of Queen Victoria. In October 1900 Furlong was also elected as one of the four vice-presidents of Inghinidhne na hEireann (Daughters of Ireland), an organization which had a specific cultural purpose and promoted the Irish language and Irish literature. She had begun to learn the Irish language shortly after the setting up of the Gaelic League in 1893, and in July 1908 she was awarded a certificate as a teacher of Irish. 
Although Furlong published in both Irish and English, after 1916 she wrote mostly in Irish, publishing under the names Eilis Ni Phartholain and Eilis de Fhurlaing. Her Irish-language publications appeared in 'Fainne an Lae' and 'An Claidheamh Soluis', and her poem 'Dublin Easter 1916' was sold as a leaflet to support the Irish National Aid Association. She published lessons for beginners in Irish in 'Nationality' in 1918, and her poems continued to appear in the 'Irish Monthly' in the 1930s. Alice Furlong died, unmarried, at her home, 378 Harold's Cross Road, Dublin, on 20 October 1946, of heart disease. She was buried in Tallaght graveyard.

Gyles, Margaret Alethea (1868-1949), artist and poet, was born in Kilmurry, co. Cork, Ireland, the daughter of 'mad' George Gyles and his wife, Alithea Emma, daughter of the Hon. and Revd Edward Grey, bishop of Hereford. Her family, from Minehead, Somerset, had settled in Youghal about 1649, and was 'so haughty that their neighbours called them the Royal family' (Yeats, 'Autobiographies', 237). 
Severing herself from her family and surviving by 'selling her watch, and then by occasional stories in an [unidentified] Irish paper', Gyles attended an art school in Stephen's Green, Dublin, in the late 1880s. Living in poor accommodation and starving, she was taken by E. J. Dick to live in the 'household', a theosophical commune at 3 Ely Place, which included his wife and George Russell (A. E.). To W. B. Yeats, who joined them in 1891, she seemed 'a strange red-haired girl, all whose thoughts were set upon painting and poetry'. Quarrelling with the Dicks, she returned to 'starvation and misery [which] had a large share in her ritual of worship' (Yeats, 'Autobiographies', 237-8). 
At 53 Mountpleasant Square, Dublin, Gyles wrote a never-published novel, 'The woman without a soul' (MS, NL Ire.). Its black magician is loosely based on the mysterious Captain Roberts whose rituals involving animal sacrifice are described in 'The Sorcerers', in Yeats's 'The Celtic Twilight' (1893). Late in 1891 or early in 1892 Gyles moved to London where she studied at Pedders, then at the Slade School, financed by one of her Grey relatives. By 1896 she had established herself in her 'studio' at 86 Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square. Her friends included Lady Colin Campbell, art critic of 'The World' (Gyles almost certainly providing the cover design for 'A Woman's Walks', 1903), and the artist Mabel Dearmer of the 'Yellow Book' circle. '[S]huddering from her rustic surname', Oscar Wilde urged 'Ah! you must call yourself Althaea Le Gys' (Clifford Bax, ALS, U. Reading L.). 
The 'Pall Mall Magazine' took Gyles's poem 'Dew-time' in October 1894. It was influenced by A. E., illuminated by Gyles, and was followed by others derivative of Yeats and, from time to time, worked over by him. Her drawing 'The Offering of Pan' appeared in 'The Commonweal' in June 1896 and her illustration for T. W. Rolleston's 'Deirdre: the Feis Ceoil Prize Cantata' in 1897. Gyles was not a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, but she and Yeats collaborated closely over the cabbalistic iconography of her wraparound design for 'The Secret Rose' (1897), with its Celtic and medieval knotwork inspired by the eleventh-century sacramentary of Fleury attributed to Nivardus of Milan. Yeats analysed her work in 'A symbolic artist and the coming of symbolic art' ('The Dome', December 1898) and she was accepted again by A. H. Bullen, T. Fisher Unwin, Elkin Mathews, and Hodder and Stoughton, as she and Yeats collaborated on programmes for talismanic designs to his 'total books', 'The Wind Among the Reeds' and 'Poems' (1899). The spinal design of the latter was used until 1927. 
Aleister Crowley claims to have witnessed Yeats, with Gyles, attempting an astral vision of a red and white hawk and deer in his rooms at Woburn Buildings. Crowley told Richard Ellmann in 1946 that when Gyles sought to save herself from his insidious aura, Yeats ordered her to obtain a drop of Crowley's blood so that Yeats might overcome black magic with white. She compromised on a hair from his head and one of his books, which she dropped as she fled when Crowley confronted her with a skeleton in his 'sanctum sanctorum'. Yeats used the hair for his invocations, and Crowley wrestled with a 'vampire for ten nights' (McFarlin Library, University of Tulsa, Richard Ellmann papers). Ellmann relates that Gyles then 'gave way entirely to [Crowley's] baleful fascination', but Crowley was perhaps remembering only his fictional characters Count Swanoff (himself), Hypatia Gay (Althea), and Will Bute (Yeats) in his short story 'At the Fork of the Roads', published in 'The Equinox' (1909). 
In Paris early in May 1899 Gyles agreed to illustrate Wilde's 'The Harlot's House' for the publisher, pornographer, and patron of Aubrey Beardsley, Leonard Smithers (1861-1907). Soon they were caught up in an ostentatious affair. She executed five coloured drawings which Smithers described as 'weirdly powerful and beautiful' and eventually published in the pirate edition in 1904 (Sherard, 342). At the height of her energies, postponing all other work to finish the illustrations for 'The Harlot's House', she was plainly in love with 'so 'excellent' a person as Mr Smithers' (Finneran and others, 56). Martin Secker would often see them playing chess in the domino room at the Cafe Royal. The gold-stamped covers for Ernest Dowson's 'Decorations' followed in December 1899, using a stylized rose, which Yeats identified as her 'central symbol', on the white parchment top board, and a pattern of thorns and foliage on the back. Four swirling birds pecking at a heart between a sun and moon surrounded by stars form the top board of John White-Rodyng's 'The Night' (1900). 
By November 1899 Gyles had deposited her valuable books with W. B. Yeats -- he refused Smithers's 'improper Japanese ivories' -- before the bailiffs arrived. In mid-September 1900 Arthur Symons found her in bed in a bare room at 15 Granby Place, Hampstead Road, 'without a thing in the place, except five books (one a presentation copy from Oscar Wilde) and one or two fantastic gold ornaments which she used to wear; chloral by her side, and the bed strewn with MSS', wanting to read his article on Ernest Dowson. Dowson had died on 23 February 1900 but she told Symons 'When I meet him I'll tell him about it!' Symons sold her poem 'For a Sepulchre' to the 'Saturday Review'. Gyles, recovering in the Hospital for Diseases of the Chest in the City Road, apologized to the bankrupt Smithers for not raising money from her people to save him. Back in Granby Place by Wilde's death on 30 November, she offered Smithers $6 to go to Wilde's funeral. He refused. 
Faith Compton Mackenzie portrayed Gyles and her relationship with Smithers in 'Tatting' (1957). Gyles appeared as Ariadne Berden who: 'after treating reasonable admirers with prudish contempt, had fallen into the arms of an abominable creature of high intelligence, no morals and the vivid imagination which was perhaps what she had been waiting for... Ariadne lost caste, and when the affair ended after more than a year of heady intoxication, and with a certain amount of inspired work, she collapsed. (F. C. Mackenzie, 'Tatting', 1957, 12)' For Symons, Smithers was 'a drunken brute whom no one could stand' who had 'left her as soon as he had alienated her other friends' (Columbia University, Arthur Symons papers). 
By 1902 Gyles was once again ill, but survived to tell untrustworthy 'romantic tales of her night escape from a terrible sanitorium' (Symons, 167). Her productive life as a designer was over. Her cover design for 'The Shadowy Waters' (1900) uses only the rose from her rejected frontispiece portrait of Yeats for 'The Wind Among the Reeds' (her only surviving original work, now in the British Museum), and while her spinal design from 'The Secret Rose' is reused on the 1902 edition of 'The Celtic Twilight' it is unclear whether she executed the small gold emblem on the top board (three fletched arrows pointing through a crescent moon). Her front and rear cover designs for 'The Wind Among the Reeds' were redrawn when full vellum bindings were produced in 1903, but it is unlikely that she redrew them herself. Yeats refused her spinal designs on several books. 
Gyles continued intermittently to publish verse in the 'Saturday Review', the 'Candid Friend', and 'The Kensington', 'The Venture', 'The Academy', 'Orpheus', and 'The Vineyard', organ of the Peasant Art Guild at Haslemere. Her close friend and patron Cecil French, who bought her fine portrait of Yeats, recalled her 'considerable reputation around 1900. She was a most difficult being with noble qualities, who invariably became the despair of those who had helped her.' French also records that her projected collection of verses was 'at one time actually in type (I saw it). She flatly refused to correct the proofs, saying the effort would kill her; nor was anyone else allowed to correct the proofs. The publisher was not pleased' (U. Reading L.). Typescripts of her verses survive in A. H. Bullen's archive in Stratford. 
Arthur Symons, however, claimed that he had introduced her to a London publisher who was happy with her verses but rejected the dedication she insisted on: 'To the beautiful memory of Oscar Wilde'. In 1904 Thomas B. Mosher, the pirate publisher, rejected the poems pressed on him on behalf of the 'quite unmanageable and unpractical' author (Symons, 171-2). Her last book cover may well be that of Arthur Humphrey's Wilde anthology, 'Sebastian Melmoth' (1905). In March 1907 she was 'comparatively prosperous', writing: 'art notes for Frank Harris, and reviewing novels. She even does an occasional drawing, and has never been known to look upon the world with so little malice. She has quite a group of friends, but changes them completely every six months. (Yeats, 2 March 1907, Berg Collection, NYPL)' Yeats affirms that by 1908 she had ended a love affair by reading Browning to her lover in the middle of the night (Wade, 511). Faith and Compton Mackenzie visited her in Paradise Walk, Chelsea, where she was living in 'an atmosphere of squalid poverty', spending her time 'lying upon a broken-down truckle-bed', an episode which finds its way into 'Tatting', where the room is adorned with a Beardsley 'solitary on the whitewashed wall, a delicious riot of satyrs and fauns' (F. C. Mackenzie, 'Tatting', 1957, 97-8). Compton Mackenzie invited her to Cornwall in May 1908: 'She looked rather like a part of the decorations of a harvest festival which had been caught up unwittingly by one of the congregation and dragged outside. Her large-brimmed black hat was wreathed with poppies; her green silk dress hung upon her... Her cheeks, no doubt once rosy and bloomed with youth, were now pale; her hair, no doubt once autumn-gold, was now dead as a faded rug; her pale blue eyes lacked lustre... In a tiny cottage she was an intolerable nuisance. (Mackenzie, octave 4, 36-9)' In February 1906 Gyles had offered Grant Richards an 'alphabet' which she was designing, 'The alphabet of the wonderful wood', but it was one of many projects never completed (University of Texas, Ransom HRC). Beginning with the letter U, she painted 'an entrancing water-colour of a very white unicorn against a very blue sky, and did no more'. Eleanor Farjeon, who occasionally typed her poems, thought her 'quite exquisitely gifted, as a writer and an artist; with the sort of temperament that stood in her own light', she was 'fascinating and exhausting', and 'filled the air with fantastic talk and anecdotes on the 'nineties''. Her hands were the most beautiful Farjeon had ever seen but 'quite the dirtiest' (letter, U. Reading L.) 
In 1914, as John Meade, Gyles published 'Letters to Children about Drawing, Painting, and Something More'. She continued to write, paint, drift, be ill, and to gravitate towards small arts and crafts or religious communities (such as the Order of the Holy Mount, Folkestone), supported by increasingly disgruntled patrons including Clifford Bax, who thought her a parasite. Urged by Grant Richards to write her memoirs of the 1890s, she wrote a novel, 'Pilgrimage', in Folkestone about 1919, which Richards rejected in February 1921. The characters include Pascoe, an Irish theosophist, mystic folklorist, and painter (George Russell), and Benador Quested, a dark-eyed mystical poet and animal lover (Yeats) who runs a donkey sanctuary in Devon (MS, U. Reading L.). In January 1924 Richards was still asking her for her memoirs. In the 1930s Eleanor Farjeon had a 'sudden wild letter' from her. She was living in a Brixton basement, in an 'awful state' with a big mongrel dog (U. Reading L.). Her last address was 19 Tredown Road, Lewisham, where she lived in a room empty but for a chaise longue, some bric-a-brac, and the manuscripts now in the University of Reading. She died on 23 January 1949 in a nursing home at 69 Crystal Palace Park Road, Beckenham, Kent, leaving $611 1's'.

Joyce, Nora Joseph (1884-1951), wife and muse of James Joyce 1882-1941, was born on 21 or 22 March 1884 at the Galway union workhouse hospital, co. Galway, Ireland, the second of eight children born to Thomas Barnacle (1846-1921) and Honoraria (Annie) Healy ('c'.1859-1939), of Sullivan's Lane, Galway. Nora was educated at the Convent of Mercy national school in Galway. Fostered as a child with her grandmother, she worked from the age of twelve at the Presentation Convent, Galway; then, having run away from home in 1904, as a chambermaid at Finn's Hotel, Leinster Street, Dublin. On 10 June 1904 on Nassau Street in Dublin her auburn hair, confident figure, and bold walk caught the eye of the young writer James Joyce. Their first evening together so changed Joyce's life that he later set the entire action of his great novel 'Ulysses' (1922) on that day, 16 June 1904. 
The young couple ran away unmarried to the continent on 8 October 1904, settling in Habsburg Austria -- first in Pola, next in Trieste, where Joyce taught English in a Berlitz school. Their first child, Giorgio (1905-1976), was born, and they were soon joined by Joyce's brother Stanislaus (1884-1955), who became a permanent resident there. In the following year the family moved to Rome, where Joyce worked in a bank and also wrote 'The Dead', the last and greatest of his short story collection 'Dubliners' (1914). Nora is widely thought to be the model for the red-haired Gretta Conroy in that story. When they returned to Trieste, the couple's second child, (Anna) Lucia Joyce (1907-1982), was born, and two of Joyce's unmarried sisters, Eileen (1889-1963) and Eva (1891-1957), came from Dublin to join the household (Eva stayed only briefly). By now the Joyce family spoke Italian at home and Nora ceased active practice of her religion out of respect for Joyce's apostasy. 
During the Trieste years Nora's portrait was painted by the artist Tullio Silvestri, who said she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She also attracted the attentions of Roberto Prezioso, editor of the 'Piccolo della Sera', and Joyce broke with this good friend out of jealousy. Joyce's terror of being cuckolded underlay the novel 'Ulysses', which he had begun to write, and also his play 'Exiles' (1918). 
With the outbreak of the First World War, the Joyces (without Stanislaus and Eileen) took refuge in Zurich. Joyce continued to work on 'Ulysses', and in 1918 Nora played Cathleen in the English Players' production of J. M. Synge's 'Riders to the Sea', directed by Joyce. In Zurich, Ottocaro Weiss (a Triestine banker) made his admiration of Nora known. There is no evidence that she was ever unfaithful to Joyce, rather that he was manipulating his jealousy for his own literary purposes. She wept to Frank Budgen, a close friend of Joyce's, 'Jim wants me to go with other men so that he can write about it' (Budgen, 188). 
With the war's end, the Joyces returned to Trieste but the city, now part of Italy and no longer a major port, was dull. Ezra Pound persuaded Joyce to move his family to Paris, which he did in 1920. Nora began mastering her third foreign language, and with the money lavished on them by Joyce's selfless English patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, she learned the delights of the Paris couture houses. Joyce, increasingly troubled by failing sight and more than ever dependent on Nora's strength, indulged her. She was never over-respectful. She refused to read 'Ulysses'. When he became a literary celebrity after the publication of 'Ulysses', she told friends, 'I've always told him he should give up writing and take up singing' (Ellmann, 561). Of 'Work in Progress', the developing 'Finnegans Wake', she said to him 'Why don't you write sensible books that people can understand?' (Ellmann, 590). 
Nora made a full recovery from two operations for uterine cancer in November 1928 and February 1929. With Joyce she moved briefly to London in 1931. They married on 4 July at the Kensington register office, 'for testamentary reasons', Joyce told the press. (Both Nora and James Joyce remained British subjects all their lives.) Nora was happy to be married at last. However, the unexpected press publicity upset her family in Galway and also Lucia Joyce, who had thought her parents were married already. Shortly afterwards the Joyces returned to Paris, where they lived during the 1930s. Those years were marred for Nora by her daughter's severe mental collapse, but brightened by the marriage of her son to Helen Kastor Fleischman of New York, and by the birth of her grandson Stephen James Joyce on 15 February 1932. 
The Joyces left Paris in late 1939 in advance of the Nazis' entry, leaving Lucia behind in a psychiatric clinic in Brittany, but accompanied by their son (whose wife too had suffered a psychiatric illness) and their grandson. They lived in the village of St Gerand-le-Puy near Vichy. In December 1940, with the help of Swiss friends, they moved back to Zurich. A month later Joyce died unexpectedly from a perforated ulcer and was buried in Zurich's Fluntern cemetery. 
As a widow Nora remained in Zurich, with her loyal son nearby. She resumed the practice of her Catholic religion. In the post-war years she hoped to have her husband's body returned to Ireland in honour, as W. B. Yeats's had been in 1948, but in the puritanical Ireland of Eamon de Valera, Joyce remained a scandalous writer. From Zurich, living in pensions, Nora was sought out by the increasing numbers of Joyce scholars, who experienced the tart tongue and Irish common sense so prized by Joyce, for whom, as they wandered Europe, she had been his portable Ireland. Asked her opinion of Andre Gide, the widow replied, 'When you've been married to the greatest writer in the world, you don't remember all the little fellows' (Ellmann, 743). As for Joyce's favourite authors, she replied, 'He spent a good deal of time reading himself' (Maddox, 475). Upon her death on 10 April 1951, from uraemic poisoning, she too was buried in Fluntern cemetery, though in a separate grave; in 1966 the bodies were reinterred in a new joint grave. 
Nora's influence on Joyce, both personal and literary, was long underplayed by Joyce scholars, who tended to see her as an unworthy and uneducated consort of the great writer. Yet she was the model for his principal women characters, including Bertha in his play 'Exiles' and Anna Livia Plurabelle in 'Finnegans Wake'. In time, however, scholars came to note the connection between Nora, with her unpunctuated writing and uninhibited speaking styles, and Joyce's most famous female creation, Molly Bloom, whose earthy rambling soliloquy brings 'Ulysses' to a close. Nora was the subject of portraits by at least two painters, Tullio Silvestri and Myron Nutting, and the photographer Berenice Abbott, while two biographies and a film ('Nora', directed by Pat Murphy) have chronicled her life. Her mother's home at Bowling Green in Galway is now a museum.

Laverty, Maura (1907-1966), journalist and writer, was born on 15 May 1907 in Rathangan, co. Kildare, Ireland, the second eldest of thirteen children of Michael Kelly, variously a farmer, draper, and merchant, and his wife, Maryanne Tracey, a dressmaker. The family lived on an estate of 200 acres but her father's gambling ruined the family financially. On his death Kelly's mother turned to dressmaking to support herself and nine surviving children. Kelly's grandmother, who is idealized in one of her novels, also had a dressmaking business in Kildare. Kelly boarded at the Brigidine convent in Tullow, co. Carlow, with the intention of being a teacher, but she appears to have been an unwilling pupil. 
At the age of nineteen Kelly went to Bilbao in Spain as a governess. She was treated badly and had a couple of unhappy love affairs, including a short engagement to a Hungarian called Peter, which was soon broken off. She later acted as secretary to the writer Princess Bibesco and also earned a living as a 'foreign correspondent', at the Banco Calamarte and as a freelance journalist in Madrid working on the daily 'El debate'. In 1928 she returned to Dublin and worked as a journalist and broadcaster with the newly established national broadcasting station Radio Eireann. In Dublin, on 3 November 1928, she married the journalist Seamus (James) Laverty, with whom she had corresponded while in Spain; they had a son and two daughters. The family's finances were precarious (her husband lost money through a business venture with the Irish sweepstake), and Maura Laverty began to write in the 1940s to support her family. The marriage ended in separation. Laverty remained with Radio Eireann; she was in charge of women and children's programmes and hosted the electricity supply board's radio programme for eleven years, discussing books, poetry, and matters of interest to women. 
Laverty's first book, 'Flour Economy' (1941), was a popular self-help book on how to overcome wartime shortages. Her first novel 'Never No More' (1942) was based on her own life growing up in Kildare and inspired by her grandmother's cooking. It was enormously successful and well received by such critics as Sean O'Faolain. The 'New York Times' noted that it was a 'book written as only one of Irish blood could write it, breathing a civilisation that has never succumbed to industrial strain or to overexigencies of modernity' (Binchy, xvii). Two of her novels were banned in Ireland for their sexual and political content: 'Alone we Embark' (1943; published as 'Touched by the Thorn' in the USA), with a central character who undertakes two unhappy marriages, which received the Irish women writers' award in 1944, and 'No More than Human' (1944), a sequel to 'Never No More', the story of a Kildare girl working as a governess in Spain. In 1945 she published a children's story, 'The Cottage in the Bog' ('Gold of Glanaree' in the USA), and in 1946 she brought out 'Lift up your Gates' (1946), a study of slum life in Dublin which was later republished as 'Liffey Lane' in 1947. In the same year she published another cookery book 'Kind Cooking' illustrated by Louis le Brocquy which was the Irish non-fiction book of the month in America. In 1948 she scripted an election campaign film for Clann na Poblachta entitled 'Our Country' and directed by Liam O'Leary. This highlighted the problems of Ireland in the 1940s. The narration is interspersed with footage of dole queues and dirty tenements contrasted with shop windows stocked with imported luxury goods. In 1949 she produced another children's book, 'Green Orchard'. 
In the 1950s Laverty adapted 'Liffey Lane' as a series of plays including 'Tolka Row', subtitled 'A Play of Dublin Life', which was an exploration of the day-to-day life of the Nolan family set on the fringes of Dublin city. Her cookbook 'Full and Plenty' (1960) made her a much loved national figure. In 1964 Laverty adapted 'Tolka Row' for television with the script editor Carolyn Swift. It became a long-running, popular weekly serial for Radio Telefis Eireann and was its first soap opera. In the 1960s Laverty also presented her own radio programme featuring 'agony aunt' advice, listeners' letters, and recipes. 
Laverty had suffered some ill health early in 1966 and had been hospitalized with a broken hip in March of that year. She died of a heart attack at 30 Butterfield Drive, Rathfarnham, Dublin, in July 1966, having left hospital in June. In 1995 her fairy tales were collected in 'The Queen of Aran's Daughter' with illustrations by her daughter Barry Castle. She is fondly remembered for her cookbooks, and 'Never No More' and 'No More than Human' appeared as 'Virago Classics' in the 1980s.

Ni Chonaill, Eibhlin Dhubh (b. c.1743, d. in or after 1791), poet, was one of the twelve surviving children of the twenty-two children of Domhnall Mor O Conaill (died 1770) and his wife, Maire Ni Dhuibh ('c'.1705-1795), of Derrynane, co. Kerry. 
The Ui Chonaill (O'Connells or Connells) of Derrynane were a noted and prosperous Catholic family. Among Eibhlin's brothers were Count Daniel O'Connell (1745-1833) and Morgan (father of Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847), the Liberator). The women of the family were noted as poets. Eibhlin's mother, Maire Ni Dhuibh, may have been a descendant of the seventeenth-century poet Piaras Feiritear; she and her sister Siobhan are credited with a number of poems, in particular with laments. 
In Gaelic tradition, both scholarly and popular, Eibhlin retains her maiden name and the adjective Dubh (feminine form of 'dhubh', 'dark'). She was married at 'under 15' to an O'Connor of Firies, co. Kerry, who died six months later. In 1767 she married, against the wishes of her family, Art O Laoghaire 
(Art O'Leary; 1746?-1773)
of Rath Laoich near Macroom, co. Cork, who had been an officer in the Austrian army. He died on 4 May 1773, in a quarrel with a protestant neighbour. Folklore ascribes the cause of the quarrel between Art O Laoghaire and Abraham Morris, high sheriff of Cork, to sexual jealousy or to Morris's demand to buy O Laoghaire's horse for $5 which as a protestant he was entitled to do. Morris and the soldiers who fired the fatal shots after a failed ambush by O Laoghaire were declared guilty of murder by coroner's inquest in June, but Morris was acquitted by a grand jury in September 1773. The quarrel is the subject of the very celebrated poem 'Caoineadh Airt Ui Laoghaire'. 

'Caoineadh Airt Ui Laoghaire' survived in folk memory, with Eibhlin Dhubh's name attached as the author, until it was written down in the nineteenth century. The earliest surviving manuscripts date from the 1840s. The poem has been much studied, praised, and translated and remains a controversial text in modern Gaelic scholarship. The manuscript versions show great variation and also include lines which occur in earlier 'Caoineadh' (poems of lamentation); the poem exhibits several conventions of the genre, including praise of the dead man's house and family, exclamations of love, apparent reproaches addressed to other mourners. 
Several academic writers have suggested that the 'Caoineadh' was composed or rather performed extempore as part of the ceremony of lamentation or keening which is well attested as an essential part of the traditional response to death in Gaelic society. Others have pointed to the anomaly of seeing a woman of Eibhlin Dhubh's class as a keener, and drawn a distinction between the folk custom and the lament as literary artefact, attaching Eibhlin Dhubh's poem to the literary tradition while conceding its wide oral diffusion. 
Some doubt has also been cast on Eibhlin Dhubh's authorship of the poem. This seems impossible to determine from the evidence now available. The instability of the text adds to the problem; however, all versions are, to different degrees, remarkable for the speaker's energy in depicting herself, her own actions, and emotions. The speaker describes her sudden falling in love, her pleasure in marriage, leaping on the horse which came to her door with bloody saddle, her discovery of Art's murdered body, and in one version (possible tampered with by a scholarly transmitter) her drinking his blood. It expresses pride in her own and her husband's family connections and threatens Morris with an appeal to the king in London. 
The poem also mentions two children of the marriage and a third yet unborn. One of the two who are named, Conchubhar O Laoghaire (1768-1846), was partly educated in France, became a captain in the 'gardes francaises', later a barrister, married three times, and had a son who also died in 1846. Letters from her brother Daniel refer to Eibhlin's son and grandson and record that 'it is however no small comfort to be assured there remains some livelihood for his orphans and widow' (Collins, 'Arthur O'Leary', 1949, 2; O'Connell, 2.94). The date of Eibhlin Dhubh's death is unknown but she was alive in 1791. 
While the mutations of the texts and the many political agendas that have surrounded its transmission make the question of authorship, and the relation to the keening tradition, a complex one, it seems on balance sensible to accept that the poem belongs in essence to its traditional author.

(Agnes) Nesta Shakespear Skrine (1865-1955). Nesta was born in Cushendun, co. Antrim, the daughter of Charles Henry Higginson and his wife, Mary. Her first published work was 'An Easter Vacation' (1893), a seaside romance ponderously jocular in tone, which was followed by a fairy story for children, 'The Elf-Errant' (1893). In 1895 she married Walter Skrine. The work with which her name is principally associated, 'Songs of the Glens of Antrim', appeared in 1901 and became one of the most popular books of Irish regional verse. She was technically very skilled in the use of varied and complicated rhyming patterns. The poems, attempting the use of the Hiberno-English of the Glens of Antrim, run the gamut from sadness at lost love to mild comedy, and are all pervaded by love for the Irish homeland. Some were frequently anthologized (such as 'Corrymeela'). O'Neill lived for a time in Alberta, Canada, where her husband farmed extensively, and she included a section entitled 'Songs from North-West Canada' in 'More Songs of the Glens of Antrim' (1921). Canada figures also as a location in her novel 'From Two Points of View' (1924), an ambitious but rather contrived love story. The 'Collected Poems of Moira O'Neill' appeared in 1933. She died in co. Wexford on 22 January 1955.

Miles, Jane Mary (c.1762-1846), pianist and composer, was born about 1762, probably in Bath: her father, Thomas Guest ('fl'. 1760-1800), was a tailor there. Nothing more is known of her parents other than that her father played a role in Bath's musical community by renting rooms to musicians as well as occasionally selling musical compositions and tickets to concerts. Jenny's musical instructors in Bath included Thomas Orpin, her first teacher, and Thomas Linley. By her seventh birthday she had made such remarkable progress with her keyboard studies under Orpin that 'A Lady' felt compelled to publish a poetic tribute that concluded with the prescient observation: '
With envy, Orpin, you may view 

Your pupil -- she'll tutor you. 
('Bath Chronicle', 12 May 1768, 3)' Her subsequent teachers included Johann Christian Bach, Antonio Sacchini, and Venanzio Rauzzini. Beginning in the late 1770s her frequent performances in London, Bath, and the west country resulted in glowing critical assessments of her skill and musicianship: one enthusiastic admirer hailed her as the 'British Caecilia' ('Bath Chronicle', 10 May 1781, 2). Fanny Burney, who heard her in Bath, praised Miles as the best performer she had heard since leaving London and described her as 'very young [18], but far from handsome; she is, however, obliging, humble, unassuming, and pleasing' ('Diary and Letters', 1.358-9). Members of the royal family and professional classes, as well as musicians, were among the nearly 500 subscribers to her first publication, 'Six sonatas for the harpsichord or piano forte, with an accompaniment for a violin or German flute', op. 1 (1783). The sonatas were subsequently published in Paris (1784) and Berlin (1785). Her marriage on 29 August 1789 (St George, Hanover Square) to Abraham Allen Miles ('c'.1760-1832), an accountant with London Assurance House, did not impede her musical activities. In 1804 she was appointed instructor to Princess Amelia and, in 1806, to Princess Charlotte; Miles retained the latter position until the prince regent's dismissal of the princess's staff in 1814. She published a sonata for piano and violin in 1809; beginning in 1820 and continuing for about ten more years, she published at least fifteen additional compositions. 
Abraham Miles died in 1832, and near the close of her own life Miles moved to Blackheath to live with her daughter, Louisa, and son-in-law, John Lawrence. Their child, Louisa Cecilia Lawrence, is the likely dedicatee of Miles's last work, 'The Field Daisy'. Following a 'long and tedious malady' (according to one obituary) Miles died at 8 Eliot Place, Blackheath, on 20 March 1846 and was interred a week later beside her husband in a chancel vault in the church of St Edmund, King and Martyr, Lombard Street, London. 
Technically quite difficult, Jane Miles's works reflect the prevailing musical tastes of their times. The op. 1 sonatas embrace the 'galant' style popular during the late eighteenth century, while her works from the 1820s -- with such titles as 'La Georgiana', 'La Jeanette', and 'La jolie Julienne' -- suggest the milieu of the Romantic salon. Whether early or late, Miles's compositions conform to period expectations in that they entertain and charm more than they ennoble and challenge.

George III, daughters of (act. 1766-1857), were born over a period of seventeen years to George III (1738-1820) and Queen Charlotte (1744-1818). The six daughters in the family of fifteen children lived predominantly secluded and undistinguished lives; the reluctance of their parents to allow them to marry denied them even the dynastic significance generally accorded to the daughters of royal houses. 


The family life of the daughters of George III was not, prior to the king's first serious illness in 1788, an unhappy one. They were spared the strict educational regime and harsh discipline which fell to the lot of their brothers, and under the supervision of a well-loved governess, Lady Charlotte Finch, received lessons in English, French, geography, music, and art. In art Princess Elizabeth shone: her series of pictures 'The Birth and Triumph of Cupid' (1795) was engraved by Tomkins and published at the king's expense, and reissued as 'The Birth and Triumph of Love' in 1796. Twenty-four of her sketches, 'The Power and Progress of Genius', were issued in 1806. The princesses were allowed to play sports and boisterous games with their brothers, to whom they were close: the prince of Wales in particular was idolized by his sisters, and he was to prove their lifelong friend and protector. 
Despite (or perhaps because of) the size of her family Queen Charlotte was not benignly maternal, and her daughters were scared of her, while the king was highly emotionally attached to them, preferring them to his sons, and was reluctant for them to marry and leave home. The king's illness in 1788-9, which resulted in frightening bouts of mental aberration and delusions, cast a long shadow over the lives of the young princesses. He was to experience further attacks in 1801 and 1804, and it became increasingly difficult for the question of the marriage of any of his daughters to be broached. The queen feared that any such discussion would precipitate a breakdown in his health, and she was herself determined to keep her daughters about her. Thus it was that the sisters, eager to marry and attractive in youth (the elder three inherited the family tendency to corpulence), were kept at home in the 'Nunnery'. 
A succession of foreign princes made tentative attempts to become suitors to the princesses, but most of their offers were repelled by the queen, and many were not even passed on to the potential brides. Charlotte, the princess royal, whom the queen held responsible for the conduct of her sisters (who in turn regarded her as a 'tell-tale'), was the first to succeed in marrying. In 1796 an offer was made by Prince Friedrich of Wurttemberg (1754-1816), a 42-year-old widower whose first wife had died in suspicious circumstances; the king gave reluctant consent to the match, and the wedding took place on 18 May 1797. The groom was extremely fat, and the wits and cartoonists of the day had great fun with the 'Great Belly-gerent' and his plump bride. The marriage was happy, but the only child, a daughter, was stillborn. Friedrich succeeded as duke of Wurttemberg later in 1797, and assumed the title of elector in 1803 and king in 1806: Charlotte enjoyed her new status as consort to a ruler, addressing her mother as 'Ma tres chere Mere et Soeur' ('My dearest Mother and Sister'), to her mother's horror as Wurttemberg's promotions were the result of support for Napoleonic France. When Wurttemberg became a satellite of the French empire its queen was technically an enemy of her native country until her husband adroitly, if belatedly, switched sides again in December 1813. 
The princess royal's escape from the Nunnery did not open the way to marriages for her sisters. As all, except perhaps Princess Mary, were warmly sexual by nature, and wished for children, their position was unenviable. In their confined world they sought romance with the few men that they met frequently, principally courtiers and equerries. A pattern developed of clandestine love affairs, which caused rumours of secret marriages and illegitimate children. Having seen her potential suitors turned away, Princess Augusta, the most extrovert of the sisters, fell in love with an equerry, Major-General Sir Brent Spencer (1760-1828); she revealed her feelings to the prince of Wales, and in 1812, after he had become regent, attempted to gain his support for a private marriage. It has been suggested that this marriage did take place, but there is no evidence supporting the assertion. Princess Amelia, the king's favourite daughter, was always in poor health: from the age of fifteen it was clear that she had tuberculosis. In 1801 she was sent to Weymouth for her health; there she was attended by another of the king's equerries, Colonel Charles Fitzroy (1762-1831), second son of Lord Southampton. She quickly fell in love with him, and thereafter never gave up hope of marrying him. She told her brother, the duke of York, that she considered herself married, and took to using the initials A. F. R. (Amelia FitzRoy). Her own death intervened to thwart her plan of marrying Fitzroy after the king's death. 
Princess Sophia, denied the opportunity to marry, became greatly attached to yet another equerry, Major-General Thomas Garth (1744-1829). He was aged fifty-six, and his face was disfigured by a large purple birthmark, leading him to be called unkindly 'the purple light of love' ('Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales', 3.465) by her sister Mary. It is possible that they went through some form of marriage, but they never lived together openly; a child was born to Sophia late in the summer of 1800. There were also allegations that the child was the result of an incestuous union with Sophia's brother Ernest, duke of Cumberland, used in the press to denounce the unpopular duke. The child, also called Thomas Garth, was brought up by Garth at Weymouth. In 1828-9 the son attempted to blackmail the royal family by producing incriminating papers he had obtained from his father. He died in 1875. 
The stout Princess Elizabeth (known to her sisters as Fatima), whose great love of children made it all the more sad that she did not marry until she was forty-eight, sought the support of George, prince of Wales ['see 'George IV] in her desire to marry and escape her family. In 1808 she desperately wanted to accept the offer of marriage made by the duke of Orleans (later King Louis Philippe of France), but her hopes were confounded by his Catholicism and the queen's opposition. 
The sisters frequently called on the prince of Wales to assist them in finding husbands, in marrying their lovers, or simply in escaping from the confined life they lived in the queen's household. The help he could offer was limited before the regency: Princess Amelia's death after two years of permanent invalidity on 2 November 1810 came too early for him to be able to help her marry Colonel Fitzroy. (Indeed, it was the harrowing news of his daughter's last illness and death which seems to have contributed to the final collapse of the king's health, thus precipitating the regency.) On becoming regent the prince of Wales improved the position of his four remaining unmarried sisters by increasing their allowances, and supporting their wish to be allowed out into society. The princesses themselves planned a revolt against their restricted way of life under their mother's authority: Princess Augusta took the lead in April 1812 when they sent four letters to their mother asking for more freedom. The queen's reaction was one of horror and outrage, and it took all the prince regent's tact to effect a reconciliation between mother and daughters which gave the latter some degree of independence. 
This enhanced independence resulted in two further marriages, those of Mary and Elizabeth. Princess Mary was perhaps the most physically attractive of the sisters, with an affectionate, rather than an actively sexual, nature. 'Dearest Minny' had been the devoted nurse and companion of Princess Amelia during her last illness, and no rumours or scandals had attached themselves to her name. Like her sisters she resented the restrictions of her mother's household, and her marriage on 22 July 1816 to her cousin Prince William Frederick, second duke of Gloucester (1776-1834), should be seen in this light. Despite early assurances from the princess that she was content, their married life at Bagshot Park does not seem to have been entirely happy. Gloucester proved to be something of a domestic tyrant, while his political radicalism made relations with Mary's beloved brother, the regent, difficult. They had no children. Marriage for Princess Elizabeth in 1818 seemed unlikely; but in that year she was informed of an offer made by Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Homburg (1769-1829) (he had been suggested as a husband for Princess Augusta fourteen years earlier). She could no longer hope for children, but wished to have her own home, and thankfully accepted the prince, although he was a less than prepossessing figure. Queen Charlotte, after much grumbling, ungraciously gave her consent, and the wedding took place on 7 April 1818 at St James's Palace. The marriage appears to have been a great success. The princess's jointure enabled the couple to repair the dilapidated castles of Hesse-Homburg, and in 1820 Friedrich succeeded his father as landgrave. 
The death of Queen Charlotte in November 1818 liberated her two remaining unmarried daughters, Augusta and Sophia, but their freedom came too late, and neither married. Augusta attended her mother during her final illness, and on her father's death she moved into Frogmore House, near Windsor, which she had been given. She remained close to her brothers, frequently visiting both George IV and William IV, and was a companion to the latter's wife, Adelaide, during the early years of her widowhood. Princess Augusta lived into the reign of her niece Victoria, who spoke affectionately of her. She died at Clarence House, St James's, on 22 September 1840. Princess Sophia lived in Kensington Palace after Queen Charlotte's death, in close proximity to the duchess of Kent and the young Princess Victoria. Like the duchess she fell under the influence of Sir John Conroy, who took over her finances; this friendship alienated her from Victoria, who thought her a spy. Following her death at her house in Vicarage Place, Kensington, on 27 May 1848, it became apparent that Conroy had embezzled most of her money. She was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. 
The married sisters, Charlotte, Elizabeth, and Mary, all survived their husbands by some years. The king of Wurttemberg died in 1816, and the Dowager Queen Charlotte remained in his kingdom, visiting England only in 1827, when, grotesquely fat, she came in search of medical treatment for dropsy, and was entertained by George IV at Windsor. She died in Wurttemberg, at Ludwigsburg, on 6 October 1828, of an apoplectic seizure. The landgrave of Hesse-Homburg died in 1829, and his widow, Elizabeth, thereafter divided her time between Homburg and Hanover; she visited England in 1835-6, and in her last years spent much of her time at spas. She died at Frankfurt am Main on 10 January 1840. Princess Mary, the duchess of Gloucester, was the last survivor of George III's children, living on until 30 April 1857. Following her death at Gloucester House, Piccadilly, Queen Victoria wrote: 'Her age, and her being a link with bygone times and generations... rendered her more and more dear and precious to us all, and we all looked upon her as a sort of grandmother' (Martin, 4.27). 
The lives of these unexceptional but warm-hearted sisters had undoubtedly been marred by the possessiveness of George III, by the family calamity of his long illness, and by the selfishness of their mother, Queen Charlotte. Members of a family and social structure which gave them the sole function of marriage and childbirth, between them the six sisters produced only one living child, and he was illegitimate. The dull misery caused by the restriction of their lives at Windsor was summed up by Princess Elizabeth, on a kindness from the regent: 'tho' I do not expect to be 'happy', believe me, I shall be 'content'' ('Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales', 8.317).

Baedeker, Karl (1801-1859), publisher, was born in Essen on 3 November 1801, the son of Gottschalk Diederich Baedeker (1778-1841), bookseller, and his wife, Marianne (1781-1847), daughter of bookseller Gehra of Neuwied. The family had a wide range of business activities connected to books, including publishing, bookselling, printing, and editing newspapers. After attending Heidelberg University and gaining experience in bookselling firms in Heidelberg and Berlin, Baedeker founded his own bookselling firm in Koblenz in 1827. The Romantic movement in Germany had given a new impetus to travel, which on the Rhine was particularly encouraged by the establishment in 1827 of regular steamboat excursions. In 1828 Baedeker bought the rights to J. A. Klein's 'Rheinreise von Mainz bis Koln' and, after the death of the author, Baedeker himself revised and updated the work, recreating it for a new market. Using his own travel experiences he guided the tourist to the principal attractions in each place, saving travellers the expense of hiring their own guide. He thus created a new type of guidebook, which was widely copied throughout Europe and opened up tourism to a new class of visitor. The reliability of the information was ensured by annual journeys by Baedeker himself and by reference to respected published sources and expert scholars. 
On 4 October 1829 Baedeker married Emilie (1808-1879), daughter of Heinrich Heintzmann, a civil servant of Essen, and his wife, Leopoldine von Paczenski und Tenczin. They had ten children. By the time of Baedeker's death in Koblenz on 4 October 1859 his firm had published guidebooks to several countries in continental Europe, and his sons, including 
(Flory; 1849-1916)
, daughter of Dietrich Wilhelm Landfermann, a civil servant. 
The period 1870-1914 has been described as the firm's golden age, and it was in this period that Baedeker's impact on British tourism was most marked, marginalizing John Murray's 'Handbooks', hitherto the standard series for travel at home and abroad. For the serious tourist a 'Baedeker' was indispensable, its tone, especially with respect to southern Europeans, assuring northerners of their superiority, and suggesting ways of avoiding dangers. When Lucy Honeychurch finds herself 'In Santa Croce with no 'Baedeker'' in E. M. Forster's 'A Room with a View' (1908) she is entirely lost. Like so many others, she relies on Baedeker to make the unfamiliar manageable, and to enable her to see foreign places while minimizing contact with foreigners. Her 'Baedeker' tells her not only what she should see but also how she should respond to it. It was thus in the widest sense that the Baedeker family shaped the travel experiences of several generations of British tourists. 
After 1914 the Baedeker firm laid particular emphasis on the British market. Fritz Baedeker died on 9 April 1925 in Leipzig, but the firm continued to prosper in family hands, with new ventures such as the publication of the first motoring guide in 1938. However, in 1943 Baedeker's archive and that of their cartographers were destroyed in a bombing raid, and after the war Leipzig was the wrong side of the iron curtain for a firm promoting international travel. The firm was refounded in 1948 in Hamburg, but its revised handbooks were more regional geographies than travel guides, with scant practical information. The firm never regained its pre-eminence in what had become a very competitive market, and certainly never regained its hold on the British imagination.

Board, Lillian Barbara (1948-1970), athlete, was born in Addington Hospital, Durban, South Africa, on 13 December 1948, the second of the three children of George Board, a builder, and his wife, Frances Eleanor, 'nee' Hamnett. She had a twin sister, Irene, born fifteen minutes after her. Her parents had emigrated from Manchester to South Africa, but the family became homesick and returned to England in 1950, initially to Manchester, where Lillian started primary school at St Paul's School, Wilmslow Road, Withington. When she was seven they moved to Ealing, west London, where she attended Drayton Green primary school, before going on to Grange Secondary Modern Girls' School. She began to show great promise as an athlete and, encouraged by her physical education teacher at school and her father, she joined the London Olympiades club. By the age of thirteen she had secured a place in the club's junior relay team and competed in the 100 yards, while also trying the long jump. Her natural ability and physical fitness, developed by her father (who was her trainer throughout her career), ensured that she became a fine long jumper: she won the event in the English schools championships in July 1963 and the junior event in the southern inter-counties championships in September 1963. 
Over the next couple of years, however, Board gave up the long jump to concentrate on the sprints; her training regime, fixed by her father, became very serious and intense. The dedicated training paid off and in the 1964 season she found herself competing against, and beating, the best intermediate runners in the country at 100 and 220 yards. By the end of the season she competed in and won her first ever 880 yards, an event that she was to make her own as a senior. Young, strong, and 'a natural', Board was recognized as a possible successor to another of Britain's great female athletes, Mary Rand. Rand, the Olympic gold medallist and an inspiration and model for Lillian, tipped her to become an international athlete. 'Just watch her', Rand told the press, 'and in a couple of years she's going to be the greatest' (Emery, 29). She had meanwhile left school and after taking a secretarial course at Chiswick Polytechnic worked as a typist in between carrying out her rigorous athletics training regime. 
Board's international career began in 1966, when she ran in the 440 yards for England in the Commonwealth games at Kingston, Jamaica (8 August 1966); she was just seventeen. But it was a match between the USA and the Commonwealth at Los Angeles in 1967 that transformed her from a fine national athlete to a world-class sprinter. She surged from the back of the field on the final bend to come first in the 400 metres (9 July 1967), setting a European junior record of 52.8 seconds. The race was televised live and her performance gained her overnight fame. The press dubbed her Golden Girl, Princess of Pace, Golden Goddess, and Queen of the Quarter (Emery, 53). Later that year she won the 400 metres at the European cup final in Kiev (15 September 1967), the only British winner in the competition. 
In 1968 Board went to the Mexico Olympics, heavily tipped to win the 400 metres. Leading into the home straight, she was pipped for first by the relatively unknown French athlete Colette Besson. Of her second place Board said: 'It's lovely to win a silver medal, but I feel hurt when some people think I let the country down by not getting the gold. But I didn't really let them down. Colette was better than me on the day' ('Daily Mirror', 28 Dec 1970, 19). This pragmatic and refreshing attitude must have been difficult to maintain since she now found the weight of the country's expectations on her shoulders each time she ran. The British press and public adopted Board as something of a national icon. With her blonde good looks and 'fresh, friendly personality' ('The Times', 28 Dec 1970), she represented the 'feminine' side of athletics; her interest in fashion later led to her being taken on as a designer for a sportswear manufacturer. At the European championships in Athens she won two gold medals, for the 800 metres and the 4 x 400 metres relay (18 and 20 September 1969). Here she exacted some kind of 'revenge' over Colette Besson, whom she overtook during the final leg of the relay. Typically, her reaction to the victory was to run over and embrace Besson, telling reporters that 'I knew she felt just as I felt when she beat me in Mexico' (ibid.). 
In the 1970 new year's honours list Board's achievements were recognized with the appointment as MBE, an award that she said she treasured more than any Olympic medal. Her last race was on 20 June 1970, when she came third in the 800 metres at the women's Amateur Athletic Association championships. She had not been well for some time, but felt compelled to run. Her condition deteriorated and following an exploratory operation her 'severe back pains' were diagnosed as intestinal cancer. In November 1970 she travelled to Germany, choosing to fight the disease by the natural methods practised by Dr Josef Issels at his Ringberg cancer clinic at Rottach-Egern in Bavaria. She was unable to recover and died in a Munich hospital on 26 December 1970. Her death at the age of twenty-two was not only a tragedy for her family and friends but also a heavy blow to women's athletics in Britain. She was cremated at Putney and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral. Her fiance, David Emery, published her biography the following year.

Overman family (per. c.1800-1933), farmers, were tenants of the Holkham estate, Norfolk, by the 1790s, and remained active farmers in the county until the 1950s. The Holkham estate in north-west Norfolk was owned by the Coke family (created earls of Leicester in 1837), and consisted of about 40,000 acres of mainly light land which responded well to the 'improved' farming methods that became more widely practised during the eighteenth century. It was the promotion of these methods and the encouragement of farmers such as the Overmans which made T. W. Coke (Coke of Norfolk) famous. The Overman family was one of about a dozen well-to-do families who stayed on the estate for more than 100 years, farming progressively and on a large scale. 
A Mr Overman of Burnham Deepdale is described by Arthur Young in 1793 as 'a farmer remarkable for the neatness of his husbandry in general' (Young, 457). Young described Overman's experiments in drill cultivation and his enthusiasm for marling. Three years later Nathaniel Kent commented on Overman's entrepreneurial activities, describing how he kept a sloop 'constantly employed taking corn to London and bringing rape cake and manure from Holland, or London or Hull, wherever it could be procured at the best and cheapest rate' (Kent, 144). 
The first member of the family about whom there is evidence is Robert Overman (d. 1815?), who became tenant of Crab Hall Farm, Burnham Sutton, in 1801. Little is known about him; he may even have been the Mr Overman already mentioned by Young and Kent. He was certainly an enthusiastic improver. His brother, F. W. Overman (who in 1814 took on a farm belonging to the duke of Norfolk), described how he marled his land to increase its productivity (Overman, 234-6). Robert had at least two sons, John [i] Overman ['see below'] and Henry Jacob [i] Overman ['see below'] who both became tenants of Holkham farms. 
The elder son, John [i] Overman (1789/90-1856), took over Crab Hall Farm in 1815, perhaps at his father's death, and the farm was described in glowing terms by the Holkham agent, Francis Blaikie, in 1816. The buildings were in perfect repair, the farm was in a ''superior' state of cultivation', the new hedges were kept clean, and claying and marling were carried out with great spirit. The stock was well selected. In conclusion, Blaikie wrote, 'Mr Overman is a very deserving, industrious, attentive and persevering good tenant and may be styled a 'pattern farmer'' (Blaikie, 'Report'). John had at least two sons, John [ii], born about 1811 ['see below'], and Robert Wright, born in 1814 or 1815 ['see below']. 

Henry Jacob [i] Overman (1793/4-1859), the younger son of Robert Overman, moved from the family farm to take over Manor Farm, Weasenham St Peter, also on the Holkham estate, in 1819. In 1843 he gave R. N. Bacon of the 'Norwich Mercury' a copy of the rotation he had practised since 1820, for Bacon's book on Norfolk agriculture published in 1844. It shows that Overman was practising a typical Norfolk four-course system (Bacon, 208-10). His 700 acre farm contained a mixture of soils from light to heavy and he kept 800 southdown ewes, 30-40 store cattle, and 30 cows. He was visited by James Caird in 1850, who was surprised to find a herd of dairy cows in Norfolk. Butter and cheese were made and sent to London. The Holkham agent, William Keary, visited the farm in 1851 and described it as a 'really good occupation' in a 'high state of cultivation', and he was also surprised to find a herd of Ayrshire cows (Caird, 170). Henry's wife, Mary Ann, was born in nearby Sharrington, and they had four children surviving in 1851, including Henry Robert Overman ['see below'], their elder son. 

Robert Wright Overman (1814/15-1874), younger son of John Overman, was farming the Burnham Sutton farm when it was visited by William Keary in 1851, and was obviously continuing his father's tradition of good husbandry. 'It is almost impossible to speak too highly of the excellent cultivation and good management to be seen... Much might be said in praise of Mr Overman's management, both as to stock and everything else, but it must suffice to say that as a specimen of light land farming and clean cultivation, it stands unrivalled in west Norfolk and probably the kingdom. (Keary's description, Holkham MSS)' In 1854 Robert Wright Overman left Burnham Sutton and moved to Egmere, still on the Holkham estate, where he stayed until 1872. The tenancy at Burnham was taken over in 1854 by his brother John [ii] Overman (c.1811-c.1900), who remained there until his death about 1900. Either Robert or John was the Mr Overman, 'one of our princely and enlightened sort of farmers', who was described by the Revd Benjamin Armstrong of Dereham as taking 'forty of his men to have a day at the seaside' (Lowestoft). He had shown them the oil-crushing machines and taken them for a sail. 'As he paid them their wages just the same I reckon the treat must have cost him about $20. I told him how grateful the community should be to his right conduct and told the men how grateful they should be for so excellent a master' (Armstrong, 61-2). 

Henry Robert Overman (1825/6-1891) took over Manor Farm, Weasenham St Peter, from his father in 1859. By 1881 he was also farming 600 acres in the same parish rented from Viscount Townshend. In 1881 he was interviewed by the royal commission on agriculture, when he was still keeping Ayrshire cattle and producing butter. He also kept 40-50 store cattle and a flock of about 500 Oxford Down sheep. His knowledge of stock meant that he was frequently a judge at Smithfield in London as well as at local county shows. He acknowledged the problems that agriculture was facing by the 1880s and the difficulties there were in finding tenants with capital to run farms ('Royal commission', 17.735). Nationally, Henry Robert Overman was a prominent member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. Locally, he was a supporter of Joseph Arch, Liberal MP for north-west Norfolk, and a patron of the county school set up at North Elmham, Norfolk. However, he was never persuaded to become a county councillor. He died on 2 January 1891, and was buried at Weasenham St Peter. 
His elder son, Henry Jacob [ii] Overman (1862-1933), took over the farm from his father in 1891. By 1892, at a time when tenants were leaving the Holkham estates and replacements were difficult to find, he was able to add North Hall Farm and Kipton Ash Farm, both in Weasenham, to his holding, meaning that he was running an enterprise of at least 1806 acres there. His obituary in the 'Eastern Daily Press' on 11 January 1933 stated that he farmed more than 3700 acres in Norfolk and 1000 in Northamptonshire in partnership with his brother. He also followed in his father's footsteps in taking a prominent role in farming affairs, giving evidence to the royal commission on agriculture in 1916. Described as the most versatile farmer in Norfolk, he was a member of the research committee of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and a protectionist, which led him to be deeply involved in the Agricultural Party set up briefly in 1931. He was nominated by the Central Association of Chambers of Agriculture to be the official representative at the Imperial Conference on wheat prices in Ottawa in 1932, but was not appointed. 
Henry Jacob Overman was an active member of the Norfolk chamber of agriculture and its president in 1916. He was a member of the central wages board in 1917 and a long-serving chairman of the Norfolk farmers' union. He was on the committee of the Norfolk agricultural station in the 1920s. He died at Kipton House, Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, on 9 January 1933. 
Members of the Overman family, though tenants of the Holkham estate rather than owners, were significant agricultural innovators in Norfolk from at least the 1790s. Succeeding generations were prominent in the local or national farming community, and became renowned for their contribution to farming progress. In 1952 H. R. Overman was chairman of the Farmers' Club of London.

Robert had at least two sons, John [i] Overman ['see below'] and Henry Jacob [i] Overman ['see below'] who both became tenants of Holkham farms. 
The elder son, John [i] Overman (1789/90-1856), took over Crab Hall Farm in 1815, perhaps at his father's death, and the farm was described in glowing terms by the Holkham agent, Francis Blaikie, in 1816. The buildings were in perfect repair, the farm was in a ''superior' state of cultivation', the new hedges were kept clean, and claying and marling were carried out with great spirit. The stock was well selected. In conclusion, Blaikie wrote, 'Mr Overman is a very deserving, industrious, attentive and persevering good tenant and may be styled a 'pattern farmer'' (Blaikie, 'Report'). John had at least two sons, John [ii], born about 1811 ['see below'], and Robert Wright, born in 1814 or 1815 ['see below']. 

Henry Jacob [i] Overman (1793/4-1859), the younger son of Robert Overman, moved from the family farm to take over Manor Farm, Weasenham St Peter, also on the Holkham estate, in 1819. In 1843 he gave R. N. Bacon of the 'Norwich Mercury' a copy of the rotation he had practised since 1820, for Bacon's book on Norfolk agriculture published in 1844. It shows that Overman was practising a typical Norfolk four-course system (Bacon, 208-10). His 700 acre farm contained a mixture of soils from light to heavy and he kept 800 southdown ewes, 30-40 store cattle, and 30 cows. He was visited by James Caird in 1850, who was surprised to find a herd of dairy cows in Norfolk. Butter and cheese were made and sent to London. The Holkham agent, William Keary, visited the farm in 1851 and described it as a 'really good occupation' in a 'high state of cultivation', and he was also surprised to find a herd of Ayrshire cows (Caird, 170). Henry's wife, Mary Ann, was born in nearby Sharrington, and they had four children surviving in 1851, including Henry Robert Overman ['see below'], their elder son. 

Robert Wright Overman (1814/15-1874), younger son of John Overman, was farming the Burnham Sutton farm when it was visited by William Keary in 1851, and was obviously continuing his father's tradition of good husbandry. 'It is almost impossible to speak too highly of the excellent cultivation and good management to be seen... Much might be said in praise of Mr Overman's management, both as to stock and everything else, but it must suffice to say that as a specimen of light land farming and clean cultivation, it stands unrivalled in west Norfolk and probably the kingdom. (Keary's description, Holkham MSS)' In 1854 Robert Wright Overman left Burnham Sutton and moved to Egmere, still on the Holkham estate, where he stayed until 1872. The tenancy at Burnham was taken over in 1854 by his brother John [ii] Overman (c.1811-c.1900), who remained there until his death about 1900. Either Robert or John was the Mr Overman, 'one of our princely and enlightened sort of farmers', who was described by the Revd Benjamin Armstrong of Dereham as taking 'forty of his men to have a day at the seaside' (Lowestoft). He had shown them the oil-crushing machines and taken them for a sail. 'As he paid them their wages just the same I reckon the treat must have cost him about $20. I told him how grateful the community should be to his right conduct and told the men how grateful they should be for so excellent a master' (Armstrong, 61-2). 

Henry Robert Overman (1825/6-1891) took over Manor Farm, Weasenham St Peter, from his father in 1859. By 1881 he was also farming 600 acres in the same parish rented from Viscount Townshend. In 1881 he was interviewed by the royal commission on agriculture, when he was still keeping Ayrshire cattle and producing butter. He also kept 40-50 store cattle and a flock of about 500 Oxford Down sheep. His knowledge of stock meant that he was frequently a judge at Smithfield in London as well as at local county shows. He acknowledged the problems that agriculture was facing by the 1880s and the difficulties there were in finding tenants with capital to run farms ('Royal commission', 17.735). Nationally, Henry Robert Overman was a prominent member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. Locally, he was a supporter of Joseph Arch, Liberal MP for north-west Norfolk, and a patron of the county school set up at North Elmham, Norfolk. However, he was never persuaded to become a county councillor. He died on 2 January 1891, and was buried at Weasenham St Peter. 
His elder son, Henry Jacob [ii] Overman (1862-1933), took over the farm from his father in 1891. By 1892, at a time when tenants were leaving the Holkham estates and replacements were difficult to find, he was able to add North Hall Farm and Kipton Ash Farm, both in Weasenham, to his holding, meaning that he was running an enterprise of at least 1806 acres there. His obituary in the 'Eastern Daily Press' on 11 January 1933 stated that he farmed more than 3700 acres in Norfolk and 1000 in Northamptonshire in partnership with his brother. He also followed in his father's footsteps in taking a prominent role in farming affairs, giving evidence to the royal commission on agriculture in 1916. Described as the most versatile farmer in Norfolk, he was a member of the research committee of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and a protectionist, which led him to be deeply involved in the Agricultural Party set up briefly in 1931. He was nominated by the Central Association of Chambers of Agriculture to be the official representative at the Imperial Conference on wheat prices in Ottawa in 1932, but was not appointed. 
Henry Jacob Overman was an active member of the Norfolk chamber of agriculture and its president in 1916. He was a member of the central wages board in 1917 and a long-serving chairman of the Norfolk farmers' union. He was on the committee of the Norfolk agricultural station in the 1920s. He died at Kipton House, Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, on 9 January 1933. 
Members of the Overman family, though tenants of the Holkham estate rather than owners, were significant agricultural innovators in Norfolk from at least the 1790s. Succeeding generations were prominent in the local or national farming community, and became renowned for their contribution to farming progress. In 1952 H. R. Overman was chairman of the Farmers' Club of London.

Overman family (per. c.1800-1933), farmers, were tenants of the Holkham estate, Norfolk, by the 1790s, and remained active farmers in the county until the 1950s. The Holkham estate in north-west Norfolk was owned by the Coke family (created earls of Leicester in 1837), and consisted of about 40,000 acres of mainly light land which responded well to the 'improved' farming methods that became more widely practised during the eighteenth century. It was the promotion of these methods and the encouragement of farmers such as the Overmans which made T. W. Coke (Coke of Norfolk) famous. The Overman family was one of about a dozen well-to-do families who stayed on the estate for more than 100 years, farming progressively and on a large scale. 
A Mr Overman of Burnham Deepdale is described by Arthur Young in 1793 as 'a farmer remarkable for the neatness of his husbandry in general' (Young, 457). Young described Overman's experiments in drill cultivation and his enthusiasm for marling. Three years later Nathaniel Kent commented on Overman's entrepreneurial activities, describing how he kept a sloop 'constantly employed taking corn to London and bringing rape cake and manure from Holland, or London or Hull, wherever it could be procured at the best and cheapest rate' (Kent, 144).

Henry Jacob Overman was an active member of the Norfolk chamber of agriculture and its president in 1916. He was a member of the central wages board in 1917 and a long-serving chairman of the Norfolk farmers' union. He was on the committee of the Norfolk agricultural station in the 1920s. He died at Kipton House, Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, on 9 January 1933. 
Members of the Overman family, though tenants of the Holkham estate rather than owners, were significant agricultural innovators in Norfolk from at least the 1790s. Succeeding generations were prominent in the local or national farming community, and became renowned for their contribution to farming progress. In 1952 H. R. Overman was chairman of the Farmers' Club of London.

Overman family (per. c.1800-1933), farmers, were tenants of the Holkham estate, Norfolk, by the 1790s, and remained active farmers in the county until the 1950s. The Holkham estate in north-west Norfolk was owned by the Coke family (created earls of Leicester in 1837), and consisted of about 40,000 acres of mainly light land which responded well to the 'improved' farming methods that became more widely practised during the eighteenth century. It was the promotion of these methods and the encouragement of farmers such as the Overmans which made T. W. Coke (Coke of Norfolk) famous. The Overman family was one of about a dozen well-to-do families who stayed on the estate for more than 100 years, farming progressively and on a large scale. 
A Mr Overman of Burnham Deepdale is described by Arthur Young in 1793 as 'a farmer remarkable for the neatness of his husbandry in general' (Young, 457). Young described Overman's experiments in drill cultivation and his enthusiasm for marling. Three years later Nathaniel Kent commented on Overman's entrepreneurial activities, describing how he kept a sloop 'constantly employed taking corn to London and bringing rape cake and manure from Holland, or London or Hull, wherever it could be procured at the best and cheapest rate' (Kent, 144). 
The first member of the family about whom there is evidence is Robert Overman (d. 1815?), who became tenant of Crab Hall Farm, Burnham Sutton, in 1801. Little is known about him; he may even have been the Mr Overman already mentioned by Young and Kent. He was certainly an enthusiastic improver. His brother, F. W. Overman (who in 1814 took on a farm belonging to the duke of Norfolk), described how he marled his land to increase its productivity (Overman, 234-6). Robert had at least two sons, John [i] Overman ['see below'] and Henry Jacob [i] Overman ['see below'] who both became tenants of Holkham farms. 
The elder son, John [i] Overman (1789/90-1856), took over Crab Hall Farm in 1815, perhaps at his father's death, and the farm was described in glowing terms by the Holkham agent, Francis Blaikie, in 1816. The buildings were in perfect repair, the farm was in a ''superior' state of cultivation', the new hedges were kept clean, and claying and marling were carried out with great spirit. The stock was well selected. In conclusion, Blaikie wrote, 'Mr Overman is a very deserving, industrious, attentive and persevering good tenant and may be styled a 'pattern farmer'' (Blaikie, 'Report'). John had at least two sons, John [ii], born about 1811 ['see below'], and Robert Wright, born in 1814 or 1815 ['see below']. 

Henry Jacob [i] Overman (1793/4-1859), the younger son of Robert Overman, moved from the family farm to take over Manor Farm, Weasenham St Peter, also on the Holkham estate, in 1819. In 1843 he gave R. N. Bacon of the 'Norwich Mercury' a copy of the rotation he had practised since 1820, for Bacon's book on Norfolk agriculture published in 1844. It shows that Overman was practising a typical Norfolk four-course system (Bacon, 208-10). His 700 acre farm contained a mixture of soils from light to heavy and he kept 800 southdown ewes, 30-40 store cattle, and 30 cows. He was visited by James Caird in 1850, who was surprised to find a herd of dairy cows in Norfolk. Butter and cheese were made and sent to London. The Holkham agent, William Keary, visited the farm in 1851 and described it as a 'really good occupation' in a 'high state of cultivation', and he was also surprised to find a herd of Ayrshire cows (Caird, 170). Henry's wife, Mary Ann, was born in nearby Sharrington, and they had four children surviving in 1851, including Henry Robert Overman ['see below'], their elder son. 

Robert Wright Overman (1814/15-1874), younger son of John Overman, was farming the Burnham Sutton farm when it was visited by William Keary in 1851, and was obviously continuing his father's tradition of good husbandry. 'It is almost impossible to speak too highly of the excellent cultivation and good management to be seen... Much might be said in praise of Mr Overman's management, both as to stock and everything else, but it must suffice to say that as a specimen of light land farming and clean cultivation, it stands unrivalled in west Norfolk and probably the kingdom. (Keary's description, Holkham MSS)' In 1854 Robert Wright Overman left Burnham Sutton and moved to Egmere, still on the Holkham estate, where he stayed until 1872. The tenancy at Burnham was taken over in 1854 by his brother John [ii] Overman (c.1811-c.1900), who remained there until his death about 1900. Either Robert or John was the Mr Overman, 'one of our princely and enlightened sort of farmers', who was described by the Revd Benjamin Armstrong of Dereham as taking 'forty of his men to have a day at the seaside' (Lowestoft). He had shown them the oil-crushing machines and taken them for a sail. 'As he paid them their wages just the same I reckon the treat must have cost him about $20. I told him how grateful the community should be to his right conduct and told the men how grateful they should be for so excellent a master' (Armstrong, 61-2). 

Henry Robert Overman (1825/6-1891) took over Manor Farm, Weasenham St Peter, from his father in 1859. By 1881 he was also farming 600 acres in the same parish rented from Viscount Townshend. In 1881 he was interviewed by the royal commission on agriculture, when he was still keeping Ayrshire cattle and producing butter. He also kept 40-50 store cattle and a flock of about 500 Oxford Down sheep. His knowledge of stock meant that he was frequently a judge at Smithfield in London as well as at local county shows. He acknowledged the problems that agriculture was facing by the 1880s and the difficulties there were in finding tenants with capital to run farms ('Royal commission', 17.735). Nationally, Henry Robert Overman was a prominent member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. Locally, he was a supporter of Joseph Arch, Liberal MP for north-west Norfolk, and a patron of the county school set up at North Elmham, Norfolk. However, he was never persuaded to become a county councillor. He died on 2 January 1891, and was buried at Weasenham St Peter. 
His elder son, Henry Jacob [ii] Overman (1862-1933), took over the farm from his father in 1891. By 1892, at a time when tenants were leaving the Holkham estates and replacements were difficult to find, he was able to add North Hall Farm and Kipton Ash Farm, both in Weasenham, to his holding, meaning that he was running an enterprise of at least 1806 acres there. His obituary in the 'Eastern Daily Press' on 11 January 1933 stated that he farmed more than 3700 acres in Norfolk and 1000 in Northamptonshire in partnership with his brother. He also followed in his father's footsteps in taking a prominent role in farming affairs, giving evidence to the royal commission on agriculture in 1916. Described as the most versatile farmer in Norfolk, he was a member of the research committee of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and a protectionist, which led him to be deeply involved in the Agricultural Party set up briefly in 1931. He was nominated by the Central Association of Chambers of Agriculture to be the official representative at the Imperial Conference on wheat prices in Ottawa in 1932, but was not appointed. 
Henry Jacob Overman was an active member of the Norfolk chamber of agriculture and its president in 1916.

Rogers, Zebedee (bap. 1774, d. 1833), missionary to seafarers and shoemaker, was baptized at Strood, Kent, on 10 April 1774, the son of John and Elizabeth Rogers. He is recognized as the originator of the historic seafarers' emblem known as the Bethel flag. His given name (that of the father of the seafaring apostles James and John) has frequently but erroneously been rendered as Zebulon (the 'maritime' tribe of ancient Israel), and even Zecharaiah (the 'Old Testament' prophet). 
Rogers, is recorded as having been a freeman of Rochester, Kent, on 19 October 1795, by apprenticeship to John Rogers, almost certainly his father, as a cordwainer. While this may indicate Rochester as Rogers's birthplace the township of Rotherhithe, on the south bank of the Lower Pool of the River Thames, eventually became his home. Here, when quite young, he would frequently accompany his father, who was then employed as a coal measurer, when visiting the tiers of north country collier brigs waiting to unload along that part of the river. In later years Rogers would recall his powerful early impressions of the incredibly hard life to which seafarers of that day were regularly exposed. 
Having established himself as a local shoemaker, Rogers became an active member of the Wesleyan Methodist chapel in Silver Street, Rotherhithe. Here, at the close of a service, he noticed and befriended a lone, visibly distressed, seafaring visitor, a Captain David Simpson, master of the collier brig 'Friendship' of Shields. On being invited on board Rogers received permission from the captain to welcome the crew into the cabin and let him 'pray with them'. Incredulous at such a novel notion, they all complied. 
The day when that first informal grass-roots Christian community was created on the waters of the Thames, 22 June 1814, would later be remembered as the day the mustard seed of a worldwide missionary movement was sown. In fact, the enthusiastic response of that original collier crew became a catalyst for fellowship meetings for prayer, hymn singing, and 'Bible' study on other colliers, too, soon to be led by both captains and colleagues of Rogers from his Rotherhithe chapel, notably a timber merchant, Samuel Jennings. 
Although these lay-led mariners' meetings multiplied steadily along the Lower Pool from 1814 to 1817, it took another radical innovation, again attributable to Rogers, to transform an essentially local Methodist manifestation into a global phenomenon which transcended denominational demarcations. It sprang from the mounting need for an effective means of communication among those tiers of colliers on the Thames that would serve the dual purpose of identifying a host ship and inviting fellow seafarers in the vicinity to informal worship and 'Bible' study aboard her. While pondering this problem Rogers envisaged a maritime emblem displaying the word 'Bethel' in white letters on a blue ground. 
Amazed on learning the word's biblical significance as a 'house of God' ('Genesis' 28: 17-19), Rogers had seafaring comrades collect for the bunting and cut out the letters, leaving it to his sister to sew the signal together. The master of the nearby collier brig 'Zephyr', Captain T. Hindhulph of South Shields, also a Methodist, readily agreed to have this first Bethel flag flown from his main masthead on 23 March 1817. 
Shortly afterwards, it became clear that a second flag was needed. But this time two further features were added: the five-pointed Star of Bethlehem at the top of the hoist and Noah's olive-branch carrying dove of peace at the base, in addition to the word Bethel across the centre. Thus symbolizing the three major events in the life of Jesus Christ, celebrated at Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost respectively, this version was destined to predominate, as demand for the banner began to burgeon. In fact, the effect was nothing short of electric. After centuries of segregation and near neglect by church and society, seafarers had finally found a biblical banner by which they could relate to both, and which they could instinctively recognize as their own. 
Within a decade hundreds of Bethel captains, as they came to be called, had carried the flag worldwide, together with shipboard cell groups or 'base communities', reminiscent of the contagious house-church movement recorded in the book of 'Acts'. The emblem also became a catalyst for maritime mission facilities ashore, appropriately called Bethels. A key factor in this whole so-called Bethel movement was the pioneer role of Zebedee Rogers; and no one was more insistent about this than the Revd George Charles Smith, founder of the entire seafarers' mission movement, in the dawn of which the Bethel movement was to play such a pivotal part. 
Rogers remained one of Smith's closest collaborators for the rest of his life, constantly co-ordinating Bethel meetings on the Thames, at first voluntarily, then, from the 1820s, as the zealous employee of early seafarers' mission societies with which Smith was intimately associated. On shore he conducted an innovative and remarkably successful campaign of sailor-town evangelism and social action, both in the notorious Screw Bay area of Rotherhithe, and then across the river in Stepney, Shadwell, and Wapping. As co-workers he enlisted teams of intrepid volunteers among seafarers in port, aptly known as Bethel press gangs. His last years he served as superintendent of a rudimentary shelter for destitute seafarers called the Sailors' Rest, founded by Smith in 1830 and located in Cannon Street Road, Stepney. 
It was also the Smith who preached the funeral oration on Rogers's death in 1833. Rogers's body was brought to Smith's London Mariners' Church in Wellclose Square, and in Smith's own words 'buried with all the Bethel flags and honours that grateful hearts could procure, amidst a host of spectators'. Actual interment, he later wrote, took place in the ground behind 'the large chapel' ('New Sailor's Magazine', 1855, 230) in nearby Cannon Street Road.

Marks, Richard (1778-1847), missionary to seafarers, was born on 31 December 1778 at North Crawley, Buckinghamshire, the son of Thomas and Mary Marks. Enlisting in the wartime navy in 1797, he found a ready outlet for a self-described partiality for water, gunpowder, and 'deeds of dangerous enterprize' (Aliquis, 'Retrospect', 1843 edn, 8). Here he recalls with a candour reminiscent of John Newton how he immediately immersed himself in the opportunities for 'unabated licentiousness' of contemporary shipboard life, 'posting down the broad road of destruction, loud in blasphemy, and ever ready to burlesque... the Holy Scriptures' (ibid., 1821 edn, 15). Two narrow escapes from shipwreck in successive ships seemed only to confirm him in a life he openly describes as deliberate rebellion against God. 
Meanwhile, Marks clearly took pride in his profession and was popular with his peers. As master's mate on HMS 'Defence', he fought with such distinction at Trafalgar that he was one of the first to receive promotion from Collingwood at the close of the battle. Yet none of this, he would later confess, could dispel the depth of dissatisfaction and despondency which continued to consume him. 
At length, after transferring to HMS 'Conqueror', now as lieutenant, Marks managed to find peace of mind and conscience during shore visits while in the Channel service. Thankful for the transformation he had now experienced through the preaching and counselling of the evangelical rector of Old Stoke church, Marks soon sensed a compelling commitment to share with others, particularly fellow seafarers, the key to that gospel of grace he had himself finally found. Through the rest of his life that commitment was destined to manifest itself in three distinct yet complementary ministries, each of fundamental groundbreaking significance in the evolution of organized mission to seafarers during the early 1800s: lay ministry at sea, the provision of Christian literature from shore, and advocacy of the cause in church and society. 
Marks's call to lay ministry at sea was quite categorically conveyed by the 'Conqueror''s commander. Impressed with the young lieutenant's resolute response to anti-scriptural scoffing by fellow officers, he summarily ordered Marks to 'turn parson', whereupon the command to 'rig Church' brought the whole ship's company out on deck, an instant congregation of 'six hundred bare heads and attentive looks' (Aliquis, 'Retrospect', 1821 edn, 78). Thus began the public ministry of a pioneer seafarers' missionary. During Marks's remaining three years on board the 'Conqueror', he introduced a whole series of innovative inspirational and educational group activities. While he made light of snide remarks by some about 'Psalm-singing Methodists' on the ship, others were amazed at dramatic manifestations of change among the most 'abandoned characters' in their midst. Eventually a new commander, hostile to Marks's endeavours, presented an insurmountable impediment. 
After returning to England in 1810, following thirteen years of unrelenting sea service, Marks relinquished promising prospects of further advancement in the navy, against the advice of well-meaning friends, in order to follow an inner call which had matured in the meantime to ordained ministry among 'poor and plain people' in the established church ashore. He was admitted as a sizar at Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 12 April 1813. In June 1813, on completing his studies at Cambridge, he was ordained as a priest. He gave up as a matter of principle his naval half pay, and served an initial seven-year curacy in a remote village parish of 750 souls. From 1820, following these 'wilderness years', as he later called them, he ministered for the remaining quarter century of his active life among 'the humble cottagers' of Buckinghamshire, as vicar of Great Missenden. 
However, Marks gave early and convincing evidence that his decision to leave the sea was by no means motivated by lack of sympathy for followers of his former profession. The concept of full-time shore-based seafarers' missionary service had, at the close of the Napoleonic war, simply not fully dawned on the Christian church. Meanwhile he had himself experienced the scarcity of Christian literature at sea, while witnessing how pornographic books of 'superlative abomination' were widely available 'to debase and pollute' young minds (Marks, 'Christian Guardian', 1826, 174). Well aware of the way fellow seafarers would dismiss with disgust as 'lubberly' even the best of books by well-meaning landlubbers using nautical imagery in an unprofessional manner, Marks saw the need for authentically contextualized literature, and from 1816 led the way with a series of seven booklets, written in popular, readable style, which he presented to the Religious Tract Society for anonymous publication. 
Much to Marks's amazement, the impact of his 'sea tracts' within all ranks was immense. Moreover, this happened at a time when thousands of seafarers were transferring from naval to peacetime merchant service. Many of these had already been influenced by the so-called 'Naval Awakening', which had -- as on board the 'Conqueror' -- manifested itself in lay-led Christian cell-group activity on more than eighty men-of-war by the time peace came. Within a decade, half a million of Marks's tracts had been circulated and a wave of similar publications had begun to build on both sides of the Atlantic. It was no coincidence that precisely this decade also saw the emergence of the first comprehensive seafarers' mission organizations in both Britain and America. 
It was likewise no coincidence that many who assumed leadership responsibilities in these organizations, at least on the British side, were -- like Marks himself -- former naval officers. In 1816 Marks had also managed to publish, under the pseudonym Aliquis, a remarkable collection of personal reminiscences from his naval service entitled 'The Retrospect, or, Review of Providential Mercies'. Although it attracted a wide-ranging readership and was destined, during the next three decades, to go through numerous editions on both sides of the Atlantic, it was primarily addressed to fellow officers in the Royal Navy. As such, it proved to be a masterpiece of maritime apologetics, with an impact among those officers comparable to that of Marks's maritime tract series among other ranks. 
However, not content to provide literature addressed principally to seafarers (which he still continued to do), Marks also launched the first co-ordinated campaign to motivate the national church as such to organize for mission to seafarers. This determined advocacy initiative took the shape of 'An appeal to the Christian public in behalf of British seamen', published in five strongly worded letters to the 'Christian Guardian' from January to May 1826, followed by five further letters entitled 'The seaman's friend' from September 1826 to June 1827. While deploring the indifference of those who could leave thousands of their own seafaring kinsfolk with no more knowledge of the gospel than 'savage Hottentots in the wilds of Africa' (Smith, 1826, 55), he had only high praise for the initiatives of existing non-denominational societies, particularly those of their foremost Baptist-affiliated promoter, the Revd George Charles Smith. Realistically recognizing that many years might yet elapse before his own denomination could overcome the irregular nature of church ministry to the peripatetic seafarer, he warmly encouraged fellow evangelical Anglicans to support non-denominational efforts, while leaving no doubt as to where their loyalty belonged once an episcopal establishment for seamen might emerge. 
In addition to his extensive maritime authorship, Marks published several more general works of an inspirational, devotional, and theological nature (the last against Socinian and Tractarian positions). After continuing to serve his flock until 1844, Marks died on 22 May 1847 at Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. A slab marks his grave in the south aisle of Great Missenden parish church. A mural tablet on the south side of the nave testifies to his 'life of piety, usefulness and honor in this village', a tribute eloquently affirmed in two sermons by his successor, the Revd J. B. Marsden, published the same year. 
Richard Marks was not the actual originator of organized Anglican maritime mission. The Missions to Seamen, maritime arm of the Church of England, traces its foundation to 1856, and ascribes it to the Revd Dr John Ashley. However, the one who first and fundamentally prepared the way for that event was incontestably an unassuming former lieutenant in the Royal Navy who turned parson.

Grey, Mary, Lady Grey (1770-1858), promoter of seafarers' missions, was born in December 1770, daughter of the famous brewer and Christian philanthropist Samuel Whitbread (1720-1796) of Bedwell Park, Hertfordshire, and his second wife, Lady Mary Cornwallis (died 1770), sister of Lord Cornwallis of India. Samuel Whitbread (1764-1815), whig politician, was her half-brother. Following her mother's death in childbirth, she was carefully brought up by her fifty-year-old father in the spirit of practical piety which both parents had shared. On 18 June 1795 she married Captain George Grey RN (1767-1828), of historic border stock from north Northumberland. In 1798, after three years of repeated farewells in the midst of naval warfare with France, she decided to sail out with her husband to his base at Gibraltar. Witnesses commented on her calmness and fortitude under enemy fire, qualities which would stand her in good stead during bouts of public criticism for religious activism in years to come. It was also here that she gave birth to her first son, George Grey (1799-1882), the future statesman. 
After serving with distinction during actions at sea for several years Captain Grey was, in 1806, appointed commissioner of the naval dockyard in Portsmouth. In 1814 he was made a baronet in recognition of his services to his country. He continued in his appointment in Portsmouth until his death. 
Even before her own invaluable wartime sea experience, Lady Grey had, as a girl, been employed by her father in reading and copying materials collected by his friend the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson, documenting the abuse of both 'cargo' and crew in the 'Torrid Trade' with west Africa. In Portsmouth she showed constant concern for the welfare of dockyard workers and their families, sick sailors, and sailors' orphans. Beyond local needs, her husband's situation also gave her the opportunity to pursue a vision of global dimensions. The 22-year duration of Sir George Grey's dockyard duties, coinciding as it did with the transition of Britain's maritime focus from men-of-war to merchant shipping, fell at the beginning of the so-called seafarers' mission movement. Lady Grey, with the willing co-operation of her like-minded husband, was able to transform the commissioner's house in Portsmouth Dockyard into a centre for the incipient seafarers' mission. 
Lady Grey launched, and for two decades maintained, a campaign of systematic circulation of immense quantities of the scriptures and Christian literature among virtually every category of seafarers -- naval personnel, merchant seafarers, fishers, embarking soldiers, and convicts. In this entirely new area of missionary endeavour the Naval and Military Bible Society, British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), and Religious Tract Society all claimed her among their most valued collaborators. As Portsmouth correspondent of the BFBS alone, she is recorded as having distributed 28,201 scripture copies among maritime recipients between 1810 and 1815. Of her tenacity and zeal in this field, the many letters from her hand in the BFBS Home Correspondence files bear telling testimony. 
Lady Grey had, in the words of one obituarist, mastered 'the art of laying under contribution the talents of others' ('The Record', 26 May 1858). Thus, she made a special point of prevailing on officers leaving for sea 'to attend to the welfare of their own immortal souls, and to seek the spiritual good of their ship's company' (ibid.). One such officer could later report how one appreciative 'tar' had told another, on hearing about 'the Commissioner's Lady' as the source of 'all these pretty books' they had received: 'God bless her,... if we don't go to heaven [after this] we ought to be ashamed of ourselves' ('New Sailor's Magazine', 1828, 271-2). 
Perhaps the most striking example of Lady Grey's intuitive ability to select and support co-workers in the cause was her early contact with Revd George Charles Smith, internationally recognized as the founder of organized mission to seafarers. Bosun Smith, as he came to be called, began his pioneer role by initiating in 1809 a pastoral ministry among the scores of 'Bible'-studying cell-groups then emerging on ships of the British wartime navy. The success of this so-called 'naval correspondence mission' has since been identified as crucial to the subsequent proliferation of organizations for seafarers' mission worldwide. Smith himself recorded his indebtedness to Lady Grey for her unstinted support of this venture at its most critical juncture, providing both sorely needed funding and vital assistance in making contacts. 
The death of Sir George Grey in 1828, and his wife's consequent removal from their Portsmouth residence, resulted in a reduction in her maritime-related activity, but not in overall missionary involvement, whether at home or abroad. Among her major concerns continued to be missions in Ireland, especially along the rugged coast of Connemara. Active close to the end of her long life, she died at her home, 14 Eaton Place, Pimlico, London, on 9 May 1858. She was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. 
Lady Mary Grey was not the founding figure in the seafarers' mission movement, but she is the earliest woman known to have made a major contribution in the field. Despite the cultural constraints with which women working in the public arena had to contend at that time, available evidence clearly shows that her effective strategies and unflagging zeal played a decisive role in the promotion of nascent seafarers' missions through the first quarter of the nineteenth century, during the movement's early evolution from distribution of literature to more comprehensive models. It would not be too much to say that Lady Mary Grey left no less a legacy in the cause of maritime mission than her equally indomitable predecessor, Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, left in the cause of mission in general. In essence, Lady Grey was the Lady Huntingdon of seafarers' mission.

Welin, Agnes Carolina Albertina (1844-1928), missionary to seafarers, was born on 15 March 1844 in Harad, Sodermanland, south-west of Stockholm, Sweden. Her strong, Slavic features reflected her partly Russian paternal ancestry. Her father, Claes August Hedenstrom, a gamekeeper, died when she was seven. Her mother, Carin, 'nee' Nilsdotter ('b'. 1805), died only three years later. In the custody of a singularly gifted aunt in nearby Nykoping, Augusta Morth, herself a doctor's widow, young Agnes imbibed her warm spirit and acquired many of her practical (including medical) skills. 
Agnes Hedenstrom was in her twenties when, as the trusted housekeeper on a large estate (also in Sodermanland), she experienced a life-transforming event. Delegated by the owners of the estate to report back on disquieting news of religious revival resulting from a roving lay preacher's meetings in the area, she was herself confronted by the claims of 'familiar truths which had hitherto lain dormant' (Lindskog, 13). Initial rancour was replaced by 'indescribable joy'. Soon she found herself sharing those same truths first at Sunday school gatherings for the children of the estate, later also among growing numbers of adults. 
As word spread of proliferating popular response, overt hostility erupted too among men who rejected the right of women to preach and teach the scriptures. Meanwhile, a powerful sense of call began building in 'Mamsell Agnes' to bring the gospel to India or China. True to that call, she left for London in 1876, hoping soon to be sent out by one of England's major mission societies. However, ill health forced her to postpone her plans and instead, on her doctor's insistence, seek recuperation in the coastal climate of south-west England. It was in 1877, on her return to London, that Agnes Hedenstrom, now thirty-three, was to realize precisely her future place of mission, and that she would not, after all, have to cross half the globe to reach it. 
On learning of a recently opened Strangers' Rest, a mission and reading-room for seafarers of different nationalities in London's East End, Agnes determined to see this for herself. Undeterred by her friends' warnings that the mission's location, on Ratcliffe Highway, was the very hub of London's most notorious Sailortown slums, swarming with crimps and pimps and other so-called 'land-sharks', Agnes Hedenstrom set forth from fashionable Kensington, soon to find herself in an entirely different world. Finally forced to submit to police escort, in the midst of drunken brawls and a hail of insults, she was welcomed at the mission by the superintendent, Miss McPherson, as 'a direct answer to prayer' (Lindskog, 17). Among the masses of abused and exploited mariners were many from Scandinavia, and it was quite beyond the mission's capacity to cope with these men. Moving into a humble room in the nearby Home of Industry, Agnes continued as associate missionary at the Strangers' Rest for the next two years, preaching, counselling, and caring for her seafaring fellow ethnics, as well as those from other parts of the world. 
By then, word of the woman at the Strangers' Rest, who went alone where police only dared go well armed and in pairs, had reached forecastles on the farthest seas. However, Agnes's keen mind and practical sense soon discerned the need for a radically new strategy. The average sailor ashore had little choice beyond a seamy, bordello-like boarding-house, run by those bent on exploiting him, and the street. With her natural intuition and extraordinary networking skills, coupled with her 'glowing faith and contagious enthusiasm' (Lindskog, 22), she won over a growing group of highly influential friends, foremost among them T. A. Denny. With their help she managed to form a committee, rent a property at 88-90 Leman Street, near Princes Square, and in 1880 open the first Scandinavian Sailors' Temperance Home in the port of London. Here, by offering famished seafarers a quality of care and cuisine clearly superior to that provided by her competitors, she managed to overcome the counter-attraction of alcohol and instil a sense of self-worth in many a marginalized mariner. 
In their frustration, the fraternity of local land-sharks launched a smear campaign against their lone adversary. There were even attempts against her life. Beaten, kicked, and spat upon, Agnes Hedenstrom nevertheless refused to be intimidated. Instead, she simply redoubled her efforts, even adding a highly valued referral service for seafarers in search of a ship. As a result, the eighty-bed facility was frequently overfilled, as seafarers continued to come in droves. In Agnes Hedenstrom's mind there was now only one way to go -- build and build boldly. This, she well knew, would depend on the most strategic site and enormous funds. Therefore, she made both the subject of sustained prayer. 
An ideal site was soon found -- close to the West India Dock's main gate. As to funding, the costs appeared at first prohibitive. But again, Agnes Hedenstrom was able to enlist the aid of powerful patrons, notably David Carnegie and Lord Blantyre. Finally, on 13 February 1888, a massive new five-storey Scandinavian Sailors' Temperance Home could be officially dedicated by Prince Oscar Bernadotte of Sweden. Here, that 'remarkable girl', as Carnegie called her, continued to monitor the myriad concerns of this no less remarkable institution to the end of her life. From 21 January 1889, when she married Axel Welin, an engineer and prominent member of the Swedish community in London, she would have the companionship and invaluable support of a devoted husband. 
Proprietors of disreputable boarding-houses, bars, and bordellos in the neighbourhood eventually found it futile to harass the home and its indefatigable executive director. The seafarers simply kept coming, literally in their thousands. Here was holistic maritime ministry at its best, and they knew it. Even though the seafarers might put up a vigorous resistance, they consistently surrendered every time she disarmed them with her forthright humour, resolutely removed their hard-earned wages, and sent these off to family back home rather than risk their being squandered in some Sailortown spree. Non-Scandinavian seafarers (including many torpedoed crews during the First World War) would also be fed in the 600-seat dining hall and accommodated as needs arose and space allowed. The home's policy was perhaps best reflected in its founder's maxim: no sailor to be turned away as long as there is one foot of floor space. 
Herself never a narrow sectarian, Agnes Welin was warmly endorsed by not only the established (Lutheran) church but also the free churches of her native Sweden (notably the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden). She maintained as firm a hand on the helm after more than fifty years in the work as when she first began. Then, in her eighty-fifth year, after a stroke a few days previously, she died at her post on 23 June 1928. The ceremonies surrounding the return of her remains from London's docklands to her native soil, via Goteborg and on to Stockholm, were fit for royalty, with innumerable seafarers taking part on either side of the North Sea. While every vessel in port hoisted its flag at half mast, her body was buried at Solna churchyard on 4 July 1928. 
'Agnes Welin, the Seafarers' Incomparable Friend': those were the words, engraved in granite, which were chosen to mark her grave. What was it about her which motivated such a level of love -- bordering on infatuation -- among the many she served? All available evidence indicates that she was on the one hand utterly fearless, on the other unconditionally compassionate, thereby confirming a calibre of love which could, indeed, 'cast out fear'. Agnes Welin had no children of her own, yet she insisted on treating all seafarers as if they were hers by birth. This they felt, regardless of how they might individually respond to the faith she professed with such unflinching persistence. Perhaps that was why they commonly called her not only their friend, but pre-eminently their mother. At all events, 'Mother' Agnes Welin achieved among Scandinavian seafarers -- and beyond -- a renown no less than that of her namesake 'Mother' Agnes Weston among the British. Meanwhile, the sailors' home that Agnes Welin raised and ran for forty years, later known as Riverside House, at 20 Garford Street, Poplar, and operated by the Salvation Army as a hostel for the homeless, still stands as a monument to a heroic enterprise.

Douglas, Margaret, countess of Douglas, and duchess of Touraine in the French nobility (b. before 1373?, d. 1450/51), landowner, was the eldest child of Robert III (d. 1406) and his wife, Annabella, nee Drummond (d. 1401), and thus the sister of James I. She married Archibald Douglas, fourth earl of Douglas and duke of Touraine (c.1369-1424), probably in the late 1380s. Archibald died in 1424 fighting for the French, having apparently entrusted the administration of Galloway to Margaret in his absence abroad and the rest of his estates to his eldest son. In 1426 James I gave Margaret a life grant of the lordship of Galloway, and she ruled for twenty-three years as widowed countess of Douglas and duchess of Touraine from her 'caput', Threave Castle. Galloway's snail-pace recovery from the disasters of the fourteenth century complicated her task. 
Margaret had to live through the brutal conflict between successive kings of Scots and the Black Douglases. Stewart by birth and Douglas by marriage, she seems to have attempted to do her conventional duty by both. If as a ruler her horizon was confined to the promotion of family interests, this helped to bring some order into the countryside and economy. The few surviving charters written in her chancery at Threave or quoted in royal confirmations record her conduct of business. In eastern Galloway she enlarged the estates of the Stewarts and other relatives, while in the west she raised the lands of William Douglas of Leswalt to a barony. She endorsed and added to her husband's endowment of a chapel in Whithorn Cathedral and made her secretary and chancellor provost of the collegiate church of Lincluden, Kirkcudbrightshire, where she endowed a chaplaincy for the souls of her husband and their respective kin. She granted the Franciscans the tolls of Dumfries Bridge. This patronage, meagre by comparison with the prodigality of the Balliols in better times, bears witness to her limited means. 
Margaret Stewart had three known children and probably a fourth, but she lost her younger son, her husband, and her son-in-law at the battle of Verneuil in 1424. Her elder son, Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Douglas and duke of Touraine, predeceased her, dying of plague in 1439. Her brother James I was murdered in 1437, and two grandsons, William Douglas, sixth earl of Douglas and duke of Touraine, and his younger brother, were judicially murdered in 1440. This left Margaret in old age without any close male relative to protect her. William Douglas, eighth earl of Douglas, put pressure on her to resign Galloway. Dreading impoverishment, she petitioned the French king for a widow's portion from the duchy of Touraine. It was refused. In 1448 the English burnt Dumfries, threatening her border, and the next year she relinquished Galloway to the eighth earl. She is said to have died at Threave, apparently before April 1451, although the exact date is unknown. No chronicler romanticized Margaret. An elegant tomb with her recumbent effigy was erected at Lincluden collegiate church.

Robinson, Frederick Arthur Cayley (1862-1927), painter and book illustrator, was born on 18 August 1862 at Brentford-on-Thames, Middlesex, the son of Frederic Robinson, an engineer. Educated at Dr Head's school in Cliftonville and at the Lycee de Pau in France, by 1883 he was studying at the St John's Wood School of Art, London, and from 1885 to 1888 at the Royal Academy Schools. By 1888 he was exhibiting at the Royal Society of British Artists in the fashionable impressionistic style of the Newlyn school. From 1889 to 1891 he plied the coasts of Britain in a sailing-boat. Scenes of boats, departures to sea, and coastlines symbolizing the transition from a pastoral present to a distant unknown persist throughout his 'oeuvre'. 
For most of 1891 until 1894 Cayley Robinson was studying at the Academie Julian in Paris under academicians such as Bouguereau. European symbolism, the rise of the Nabis, and the lingering influence of Burne-Jones led him to alter his style drastically to a visionary neo-medievalism, apparent in such oil paintings as 'In a Wood so Green' (Leamington Spa Art Gallery and Museum) and 'The Close of the Day' (Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide). By 1896 he was sufficiently established as an artist to warrant A. S. Baldry writing an article on him, 'An original painter', in the 'Magazine of Art'. On 6 December 1898 he married the painter Winifred Lucy Dalley ('b'. 1860/61), daughter of John Lambert Dalley, a stockbroker; they had one daughter. In that year he also became a member of the Royal Society of British Artists. In 1894 he had begun to exhibit spasmodically at the Royal Academy, finally becoming an ARA in 1921. Other memberships followed: the Institute of Oil Painters in 1906, the New English Art Club in 1912, and the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1919. By 1901 the influence of a three-year 'sejour' in Florence, during which he studied both the old masters and the technique of painting in tempera, resulted in the discovery of classicism. Masterpieces such as 'The Depth of Winter' (priv. coll.) and the various versions of 'The Winter Evening' (1906 version, Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome) followed. The chosen images are of beautiful young women assembled in domestic surroundings around a table or desk. The figures are lost in contemplation and lit by a pale winter light emanating from a closed window, itself an exit to an unknown outside world. The paintings convey a stillness redolent with melancholy, a recurring mood in his work which combines with an allusive symbolism stemming from Puvis de Chavannes and the Belgian symbolists. After the birth of his daughter the shy and reclusive Cayley Robinson turned his brush to the painting of childhood; his paintings dwell on children in repose, often sleeping, when they are employed as images of innocence and the object of the love and care of attendant womenfolk. Examples include 'The Word' (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa), 'Childhood' (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), and 'Pastoral' (Tate collection), all painted in the early 1920s. 'The Call of the Sea' and 'The Farewell' focus on the poignancy of parting and the loss of childhood. 
In 1904, the year in which Cayley Robinson became a founder member of the Society of Painters in Tempera, he held his first one-man show at the Baillie Gallery in London, followed by another in 1908 at the Carfax Gallery. In 1907 he painted his first stage sets for Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides' 'Medea', but his triumph in this field of endeavour came with the Haymarket Theatre production in London of Maurice Maeterlinck's 'The Blue Bird' in 1910. Stage design soon gave way to book illustration; his drawings, so full of fantasy, accompanied the 1911 edition of 'The Blue Bird', and the originals were then sold at the Leicester Galleries. 
Cayley Robinson's depiction of the nude began with the title-drawing for 'The Blue Bird'. This was followed by the first version of 'Youth' (South African National Gallery, Cape Town), with a second version painted in 1923 (priv. coll.). However, the finest work in this genre is 'The Death of Abel' (Musee d'Orsay, Paris), which depicts the naked figures of Cain and the dead Abel in the horrific moment after the fratricide -- the 'frozen moment' held for eternity. This work was the source of an illustration for 'The Book of Genesis', published by the Riccardi Press in 1914; together with another masterpiece, 'The Death of Rachel', it constitutes his finest achievement as a book illustrator. Four further illustrated books followed. 

'The Coming of St Patrick to Ireland, 430 AD', commissioned by Hugh Lane in 1914 for his Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, was the first of Cayley Robinson's murals. Earlier, in 1910 or 1911, the South African millionaire Sir Edmund Davis had commissioned four panels for the Middlesex Hospital in London on the themes of 'Orphans' and 'The Doctor'. The first 'Orphan' was completed in 1915 and this brilliant ensemble far outshines his 1923 commission of a war memorial for Heanor grammar school (which later became the South East Derbyshire College). Both compositions are still 'in situ'. In 1914, under Davis's patronage, Cayley Robinson moved with his family into 1 Lansdowne House, Lansdowne Road, Kensington, London, a custom-built studio apartment block inhabited solely by artists. In the same year he took up his only teaching professorship, at the Glasgow School of Art, which he held for ten years. After the First World War he executed lithographic posters for various railway companies. 
Cayley Robinson died of influenza on 3 January 1927 in a nursing home at 1 Ladbroke Square, Kensington; he was survived by his wife. Subsequent retrospective exhibitions were held at the Leicester Galleries in 1929 and the Fine Art Society in 1977. 'The Death of Abel' and 'Youth' drew attention when shown at the 'Symbolism in Britain, 1860-1910' exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1997.

Griggs, Frederick Landseer Maur (1876-1938), etcher, illustrator, and architect, was born on 30 October 1876 at 21 High Street, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the eldest of four children of Frederick Griggs (1849-1926) and his wife, Jemima Elizabeth 
(Mimie; 1852-1900)
, daughter of Thomas Bailey, hatter. His parents were Baptists; his father, a baker and confectioner, was a deacon of the church, while his mother gave 'Bible' classes, and taught in a local school for adult education. The neo-Gothic architecture of the newly built chapel they attended had a lifelong effect on Griggs's artistic vision. Griggs attended several schools in Hitchin; he also took drawing lessons, and in the mechanics' institute library discovered the work of Samuel Palmer, a seminal influence. In 1892 he began work as an architectural draughtsman under Walter Millard, moving in 1895 to the offices of C. E. Mallows. In 1897 he set up a studio in Hitchin, and exhibited his first work, an architectural perspective, at the Royal Academy. 
In 1900 Macmillan & Co. commissioned drawings from Griggs for the Hertfordshire book in their series 'Highways and Byways'. This became his most substantial achievement: over nearly forty years he illustrated twelve volumes of the series, books which demonstrate his technical virtuosity as well as his visionary talents. The volume on Cambridgeshire (1909) is particularly fine. His preliminary drawings also provided inspiration for his imaginative compositions. 
In 1903 Griggs arrived at Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, where C. R. Ashbee had established his Guild and School of Handicraft the previous year. The guild's dedication to the preservation of traditional skills and ideals of craftsmanship impressed Griggs; he took lodgings in the guild hostel in 1904, before moving to Dover's House in the High Street. Here he lived until 1930, when he built his own New Dover's House close by. He quickly made a name as an illustrator, while developing the imaginative compositions which became his hallmark. 'Sutton' (1912, two variant states) moves the subject for the first time beyond architectural topography to express the spirit and history of the place. In 1916 he was elected associate member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers; two years later he became a fellow, elected to the council in 1920. 
Griggs was received into the Catholic church in 1912, taking the baptismal name Maur. To mark the occasion he designed a bell, named Maurus, for the local church of St Catherine's, and in 1913 produced the striking plate 'Maur's Farm' (1913-22, five variant states). 
As an architect Griggs worked principally on small-scale projects for Campden friends. His major architectural achievement lay in the war memorials he designed during 1919. These works, done without payment, continue to adorn the Gloucestershire countryside at Broadway, Snowshill, Painswick, and Upton St Leonards, as well as his own Chipping Campden; each was designed to be appropriate to its setting and the history of the site. 
Griggs was now producing his most ambitious designs, towering compositions of Gothic spires and turrets, deliberately archaic, expressing his sense of the symbolic and emotional grandeur of the past contrasted to the present. 'Anglia perdita' (1921, five variant states) is typical in its evocation of a lost, timeless world of spiritual beauty, visions which attracted a disillusioned post-war society. From 1921 he established his own press to prove his plates, facilitating his habit of revising past works. The progress of his skies is especially interesting, the blankness of early plates being later elaborated to richer meteorological effects. His assistant was Nina Blanche Muir (1900-1988), whom he married at Brompton Oratory on 9 January 1922. Their son, John Coelfrid (1922-1944), was followed by five daughters: Mary ('b'. 1923), Millicent ('b'. 1926), Hilda ('b'. 1931), Barbara ('b'. 1932), and Agnes (1937-1939). This large family added to the strain of the financial insecurity of the fluctuating print market; from 1926 plans for his new home caused further anxiety. New Dover's House was a characteristic Griggs creation: a modern medieval manor house in the finest Cotswold tradition. Once installed, Griggs enlarged his printing works to produce finished etchings. A painstaking craftsman, he selected handmade papers to complement individual subjects, and designed several typefaces, notably the Leysbourne (renamed Littleworth), for the Shakespeare Head Press. 
Of middle height, lean and intense, Griggs impressed acquaintances with his grave, quiet manner. His health was never robust, and in public he was diffident, disliking display, although he was a fluent lecturer and speaker. Nor was he always serious -- he had infectious enthusiasm, a gift for friendship, and an ability to extemporize on the piano which made him a valued party guest. He also took an interest in younger artists: Graham Sutherland was only one who owed his beginnings as an etcher to the encouragement of Fred Griggs. 
In 1922 Griggs became one of the few etcher associates of the Royal Academy. He was elected Royal Academician in 1931; his diploma work was the large etching 'Lanterns of Sarras' (1932, four variant states). With its great bell-towers, divided bridge, and mysterious figures, bathed in light from a delicately etched sky, 'Sarras' epitomizes Griggs's combination of technical skill and visionary conviction. In 1933 he served on the academy selection committee, and the following year held the mastership of the Art-Workers' Guild. In August 1937, despite increasing frailty, Griggs undertook the 'Highways and Byways of Essex'. He died at his home with the work unfinished, on 7 June 1938, and was buried in St Catherine's Church, Chipping Campden, on 10 June.

Justice, Elizabeth (1703-1752), author, was the eldest child of Dorset Surby of Hatton Garden, London, and his second wife, Ann Ellis. The major source for her biography is her novel 'Amelia, or, The Distress'd Wife' (1751), which was a thinly disguised autobiography. If its account is reliable, Elizabeth was educated in a boarding-school in Hackney and at home with a private tutor. At sixteen she married a barrister and Cambridge graduate some seven years her senior, Henry Justice (died 1763), with whom she had three children. After they married, she discovered that her husband, an avid book collector, was unwilling to divert much of his earnings from his hobby to maintaining his family. 'Amelia' describes the breakdown of the marriage under her growing indebtedness. Although she eventually secured a settlement from her husband of $25 annually, this was not enough to pay her creditors. In order to devote the sum to servicing her debts, she began looking for employment as a governess. As she did not speak French, she was advised to go abroad. She readily accepted a position in Russia as governess to the children of Hill Evans (died 1740), a member of the English merchant community in St Petersburg, for whom she worked for three years. 
Justice returned reluctantly to England in 1737 as a result of the scandal which enveloped her estranged husband after he was sentenced to transportation to America for stealing sixty rare books from the Cambridge University Library. Her writing appeared in print for the first time in that year when, without her permission, the unscrupulous publisher Edmund Curll published in the fifth volume of 'Mr. Pope's Literary Correspondence' four letters she had written from St Petersburg to a friend in London. Two years later she published by subscription her 'Voyage to Russia', the first British eyewitness account of the country that had appeared since John Perry's 'The State of Russia under the Present Czar' (1716), and the first that reflected the condition of the country after the death of Peter the Great in 1725. The 600 copies she had printed eventually sold out, and she was encouraged by a 'Lady of Quality' to issue a second edition in 1746, which was slightly enlarged through the inclusion of the letters Curll had published in 1737. 
On this occasion Justice assembled an impressive list of subscribers representing a cross-section of the provincial gentry. Altogether she managed to interest 281 subscribers, including the Wisbech Book Club (and dozens of other subscribers from this area -- King's Lynn, Peterborough, and Stamford), in her endeavour. The 'Voyage' went unnoticed by the metropolitan intellectual community. It was neither reviewed by the periodical press nor acknowledged by subsequent travellers. It is probably of more interest to readers today as the first travel account in English written by a woman. According to Anthony Cross the 'Voyage' offered an 'account of Russian customs and habits... seen from somewhat lower down the social scale than usual' (Cross, 339). In 1751 Justice's continuing financial desperation led her to publish, again by subscription, 'Amelia', the tale of the hardship brought on her by her unfortunate marriage. She died in the following year.

Vigor, Jane (1699-1783), travel writer, was probably the daughter of the Revd Edward Goodwin of Rawmarsh Hall, Yorkshire, and Jane Wainwright. Her father had a considerable fortune, which his daughter inherited on the death of her brother. In 1728, probably shortly after this event, she was married to Thomas Ward (son of Sir Edward Ward, former chief baron of the exchequer), and accompanied him to St Petersburg on his appointment that year to the post of consul-general to Russia and agent of the Russia Company. He died suddenly in February 1731 and was succeeded by his secretary, Claudius Rondeau, the son of a French protestant who had settled in England, who swiftly married his predecessor's widow on 23 November 1731. Rondeau served the British government effectively, and managed to reconcile the bickering factions within the Russia Company at St Petersburg. However, he was a delicate man and died in October 1739, and his widow, who had also been suffering from ill health, returned to England. Empress Anna, 'having a particular benevolence towards the said Widow', sent her home with a letter of recommendation to George II, requesting his 'consolation in the melancholy Station she is in' (TNA: PRO, SP 102/50). Mrs Rondeau seems not to have needed this support, however, since she was accompanied on her voyage home by William Vigor (died 1767), a merchant and a Quaker, whom she married in 1740. 
Thereafter Mrs Vigor's life seems to have been lived quietly at Taplow and Windsor until the publication in 1775 of 'Letters from a Lady who Resided some Years in Russia, to her Friend in England'. John Nichols states that 'she was in a manner obliged to publish, to prevent a spurious and incorrect copy from being obtruded on the world' (Nichols, 'Lit. anecdotes', 3.209). Although anonymous, the authorship of the 'Letters' was at once widely known. They were favourably reviewed and translated into German, French, and Dutch by 1776. A second English edition (corrected) was printed in 1777. Mrs Vigor featured as a character in a fictionalized series entitled 'Letters from Henrietta to Morvina. Interspersed with Anecdotes, Historical and Amusing', which also plagiarized her work and was therefore greeted with critical derision on its publication in 1779. In 1784 (after Mrs Vigor's death the preceding year) was published 'Eleven Additional Letters from Russia', 'found among her papers since her decease' (p. v), with a short biographical preface and some historical notes. These letters date from her earliest years at St Petersburg as Mrs Ward. They are more personally revealing than the letters she had herself published, but, like the earlier ones, they offer a unique eyewitness account of imperial and expatriate society at St Petersburg. She makes sophisticated use of the epistolary form, constructing a playful relationship with her female correspondent not unlike that between Anna Howe and Clarissa in Richardson's novel. Contemporary reviewers praised especially the 'Letters'' anecdotes of courtly occasions (such as the marriage and death of Peter II), and of aristocratic intrigue and romance. The 'Monthly Review' pronounced the 'Letters' 'agreeably written, somewhat in the lively manner of Lady Montagu' ('Monthly Review', Sept 1775, 211). 
Mrs Vigor seems not to have had children (her will makes provision for a servant and for the daughter of a local labourer). William Vigor died in October 1767, and she survived him until her own death at Windsor on 6 September 1783. She was buried beside him in the churchyard at Taplow. John Nichols recalls that having 'lived much in the world, and being well acquainted with books, her conversation was the delight of all who had the pleasure of knowing her', and reports that her loss was 'severely felt by the neighbouring poor, amongst whom she was constantly searching after proper objects for the exertion of her charity and benevolence' (Nichols, 'Lit. anecdotes', 3.209). Another Englishwoman resident in St Petersburg during the 1730s, the governess Elizabeth Justice, observed of Mrs Rondeau that she was 'a fine woman; very tall, and perfectly genteel', and 'in all her answers, even to her inferiors, she shows the greatest condescension, and most obliging temper' (Justice, 40).

Wilkinson, Joshua Lucock (bap. 1769, d. in or after 1802), travel writer, was baptized on 9 August 1769 in the parish of St Nicholas, Liverpool, the son of George Wilkinson (died 1783), captain in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Rebecca (died 1801), whom he had married on 24 September 1767. His maternal grandfather, Joshua Lucock, had resided in Cockermouth and at Lorton Hall (just outside that town) in Cumberland, and had in 1745 built the Cockermouth house in which William Wordsworth was born and lived until 1783. Part of Wilkinson's youth was spent at Cockermouth -- he recalls that in his 'school-boy' days he had 'frequently seen the mountains and lakes' of 'Cumberland' ('The Wanderer', 2.131) -- and he may have attended Hawkshead grammar school with Wordsworth. Captain Wilkinson seems to have been often at sea, and was drowned in 1783 when the 'Ville de Paris', sailing with 'the homeward-bound fleet from Jamaica', was crippled by a heavy gale off Newfoundland and later sank in the North Sea ('GM', 52, 499; 'GM', 53, 267). Thereafter his widow seems to have made Cockermouth her permanent residence, and Wilkinson probably lived with her until in 1790 or 1791 he moved to London, where he was eventually enrolled (on 2 May 1793) at Gray's Inn. 
Wilkinson may already have been acquainted with Wordsworth's brother Richard; in any case, the two became friendly when they both entered Gray's Inn in the early 1790s, and shared rooms as well as chambers. They probably did so until the summer of 1793 (shortly after Wilkinson's enrolment at Gray's Inn), when Richard Wordsworth moved to set up his own office at Staple Inn. In September 1792, William Wordsworth, returning from France, wrote to his brother that: 'I look forward to the time of seeing you Wilkinson and my other friends with pleasure. I am very happy you have got into Chambers, as I shall perhaps be obliged to stay a few weeks in town about my publication you will I hope with Wilkinson's permission find me a place for a bed. Give Wilkinson my best Complts I have apologies to make for not having written to him, as also to almost all my other friends. ('Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth', 81)' In 1791 Wilkinson had returned from a continental tour similar to that undertaken by Wordsworth. In 1795 he published a two-volume account of this and of a 1793 tour (which took in the Low Countries, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy), as 'The Wanderer, or, A Collection of Anecdotes and Incidents'. Meanwhile, in 1793 he had published a short, polemical work entitled 'Political facts, collected in a tour, in the months of August, September, and October, 1793, along the frontiers of France'. This outspoken volume -- part travelogue, part reportage -- is critical of the conduct of the German allies of the British in the war against republican France, and concludes with an appeal for British neutrality. In 1794 Wilkinson translated a pamphlet by the comte de Montgaillard, a French emigre, entitled 'The State of France, in May 1794', which displays an ambivalent attitude to the revolutionary war. 

'The Wanderer' is a long, reflective work, describing Wilkinson's travels on foot around Europe during the separate excursions of 1791 and 1793. As with 'Political Facts', the pedestrian mode of travel facilitates intimate contact with a wide range of people, and Wilkinson presents a fascinating tapestry of European characters and attitudes. He narrowly escapes being pressed into the imperial army on several occasions, and at one point is mistaken for Louis XVI, who has just escaped to Varennes. He consistently displays contempt not only for Catholic superstition, but for religious belief in general, and contemporary reviews of 'The Wanderer' criticized this 'grossly indecent' tendency ('Monthly Review', 115). In the second volume, he alludes to an incident which is later developed by Wordsworth into the story of Vaudracour and Julia in 'The Prelude' (book 9), and he may well have discussed this story with the poet. In any case, it is almost certain that Wordsworth during late 1792 read the first part of the manuscript of 'The Wanderer'. Wilkinson's travelogue provides an interesting prose counterpart to the European books of 'The Prelude', and may have suggested to Wordsworth several of the motifs of solitary travel, reflection, and revisiting which characterize his poem. 
In October 1794 Wilkinson witnessed Richard Wordsworth's signature on an important bond drawn up to protect from the claims of creditors the $600 bequeathed to the poet by Raisley Calvert. He may have married: there is a record of a marriage between a Joshua Wilkinson and Alice Ashworth on 14 December 1796 in Rossendale, Lancashire. Thereafter the letters and papers of the Wordsworth household provide only brief glimpses of Wilkinson. Early in 1802 Dorothy reports that she and William met him at Keswick during Christmas 1801, and that William and Wilkinson supped at the Royal Oak inn together. Wilkinson's presence in the Lakes at this time was necessitated by the recent death of his mother, who had died at Lorton Hall on 1 December 1801 (her death is noted in 'GM', 71, 1154). He was back in London by 19 January 1802, when he proved her will. Nothing is known of his subsequent life and career.

Moorhead, Ethel Agnes Mary (1869-1955), suffragette and painter, was born on 28 August 1869 at Fisher Street, Maidstone, Kent, one of six children of George Alexander Moorhead (died 1911/12), an army surgeon of Irish extraction, and his wife, Margaret Humphries (1833-1902), an Irishwoman of French Huguenot extraction. She spent a peripatetic childhood in India, Mauritius, and South Africa, before the family returned to Scotland towards the end of the nineteenth century. Ethel Moorhead's elder sister, Alice, encouraged by their father, qualified as a doctor in 1893 and practised in Dundee. She married a doctor in Leith in 1908 and died a year later. According to Ethel Moorhead's memoir, 'Incendiaries', while her siblings spread their wings in different parts of the globe, Ethel was the stay-at-home daughter who looked after their parents (her mother died in 1902). One of her brothers, Arthur, died in Batheaston, Somerset, in 1916 and left the residue of his estate to her, thus providing her with an income. Another brother, Rupert (died 1939), worked as a doctor, also in Batheaston. 
Although her main role was perceived as one of caring for her parents, Ethel was permitted to study painting in Paris during the 1890s, financially supported by her sister Alice. Although it was never considered that she would become a professional artist, she apparently studied painting under Whistler and drawing under Mucha. The first paintings she exhibited at Dundee Graphic Arts Society (in 1901) were said to be 'the gems of the collection', 'notable for their dark tones and strength of colour' (Henderson). She had a studio in Dundee and exhibited widely, acclaimed as 'a most refined and distinguished artist' ('Celtic Annual', 16). During that period she kept house for her father, who encouraged her painting and to whom she was very close. 
Ethel became involved in the women's suffrage movement in 1910, joining the militant, Pankhurst-led Women's Social and Political Union. In December she threw an egg at Winston Churchill at a political meeting in Dundee. In January 1911 she became Dundee's first tax resister (on the principle adopted by many in the suffrage movement that if they were not admitted to full citizenship women should not be held liable for taxes). The bailiffs came to the house to remove all the household goods but were persuaded to take a silver candelabrum. Her friends bought it back, and her father 'was delighted when she marched in with it' (Moorhead, 251). After her father's death 'the loneliness was terrible' (ibid.) and she moved to Edinburgh and threw herself into the women's suffrage campaign. In March 1912 she was arrested in London for damaging two windows but was discharged for lack of evidence. In September she smashed the glass at the Wallace monument; when she was arrested she gave her name as Edith Johnston and served a seven-day prison sentence in Perth. In October, after being ejected from a meeting in Edinburgh's Synod Hall, she marched into the classroom of the male teacher who had been responsible and attacked him with a dog whip. In December she was arrested in Aberdeen for causing a disturbance and gave her name as Mary Humphreys; she went on hunger strike but was released on paying part of her fine after four days. At the end of January 1913 she threw cayenne pepper into the eyes of a police constable in Leven and was arrested under the name of Margaret Morrison. She caused havoc in Cupar police cells and was then sentenced to thirty days' imprisonment in Perth, but was released after serving only two days because she had been hunger striking since her arrest. 
By this time Ethel Moorhead was being referred to as the 'leader' of the suffragettes in Scotland. She was never that but she was certainly very well known, not only for her many and varied activities but also because of her flamboyant defiance of authority. In July 1913, as Margaret Morrison, she was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for attempted fire-raising but was released under the so-called 'Cat and Mouse Act' after a five-day hunger strike. In 1914 she was re-arrested and became the first suffragette in Scotland to be forcibly fed (in Calton gaol, Edinburgh); she was released after contracting pneumonia. She escaped from the house of the doctor caring for her and was not recaptured before the war, though it seems certain that she was Fanny Parker's accomplice in attempting to burn down Robert Burns's cottage in July 1914. 
Militancy was renounced by the Pankhursts after war broke out and, in common with many other suffragettes, Ethel was active in relief work during the early stages of the war, working with Fanny Parker for the National Service Organization, initiated by the other militant suffrage society, the Women's Freedom League. 
After the war Ethel sold her house in Dundee to another artist and spent some time drifting, before settling in France in the 1920s where she launched and co-edited a literary journal, 'This Quarter', with a young Irish-American poet, Ernest Walsh. In 'This Quarter', no. 3, 1927, she recorded that the journal had been founded 'on the strength of a legacy left me by a friend, Frances Mary Parker'. Contributors to 'This Quarter' included Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and James Joyce. Ethel at that time was later described by American novelist Kay Boyle as having 'short bobbed hair, with only a little grey in it, and the pince-nez she wore gave her an air of authority; but there was at the same time something like shyness, or wariness in her small uneasy brown eyes and her tense mouth. (McAlmon, 194)' Ethel had a love-hate relationship with Kay Boyle, who, bursting on the scene, had a passionate affair with her co-editor (and possibly lover), and bore his child. Walsh died of tuberculosis in October 1926. In 1934 Ethel edited his works for an American publisher. 
Ethel Moorhead died on 4 March 1955 at 14 Booterstown Road, Blackrock, co. Dublin, and was buried at Dean's Grange cemetery, Dublin.

Tylecote, Dame Mabel (1896-1987), adult educationist, was born on 4 February 1896 in Crumpsall, Manchester, the daughter of John Ernest Phythian (1858-1935), a solicitor, journalist, and university extension lecturer, and his wife, Ada Prichard Crompton (died 1931). She spent her childhood at Holmes Chapel in Cheshire, where she was taught by a relative, before attending Beachfield School in Wilmslow between the ages of ten and thirteen. John Phythian was a disciple of Ruskin and Morris and an active member of that distinctive Manchester elite which sought to improve social and cultural opportunities for the poor. A member of Manchester city council (1892-8), he was involved with the University Settlement, the Ancoats Art Museum, the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, and the Social Questions Union. Mabel Phythian's early awareness of social issues led her to follow her father's example and leave the Liberal Party for Labour at the age of eighteen. She joined the prestigious and influential Manchester University history department in 1915, graduating in 1919, and was recognized by T. F. Tout as a woman of 'first class calibre. She has keen interests, extensive knowledge, an unusual measure of enterprise and character and an exceptional amount of public spirit' (testimonial, 15 June 1922, Tylecote MSS). 
Manchester University was then an exciting place for women, with a tradition in the women's department of political awareness and public service. Mabel Phythian was stimulated by the encouragement given to women by the staff and became secretary to the Women's Union as well as working with the developing Ashburne Hall for female students. An interest in academic women took her to Paris in 1921 for the international conference of the Federation of University Women. The 1920s were spent in academic study and teaching at the University of Wisconsin (1919-20), Huddersfield Technical College humanities department (1920-24), and as an assistant lecturer at Manchester University (1926-30), during which time she gained her PhD. This research in what was to remain her first love, adult education, was later published as 'The Mechanics' Institutes of Lancashire and Yorkshire before 1851' (1957). The fiftieth anniversary of the admission of women to Owens College fell in 1933 and she was invited to commemorate this by a book, 'The Education of Women at Manchester University 1883 to 1933' (1941), which is a landmark in the study of women in higher education. It was her work as a Workers' Educational Association (WEA) lecturer, begun at this time, which symbolized that concern for social justice and adult education which was to characterize the rest of her life. A brief but influential break from academic life was taken from 1930 to 1932 when she was warden of the Elvington Settlement on the Kent coal field, where she demonstrated, in R. H. Tawney's words, 'human sympathies and insight' (R. H. Tawney, letter, 21 July 1930, Tylecote MSS). 
In 1932 Mabel Phythian married, as his second wife, Frank Edward Tylecote (died 1965), a Manchester councillor and professor of medicine at Manchester University (1929-40). From 1935 to the 1950s Mabel Tylecote worked under the aegis of the Manchester University joint committee for adult education, serving as vice-president of the WEA from 1960 to 1968 and as chairwoman of the National Institute of Adult Education (1960-63). As Manchester began the immense work of slum clearance and the creation of new working-class communities in the 1930s, stimulated by the gift of the Wythenshawe estate by Ernest Simon, she became a passionate advocate of community development that not only improved housing but enhanced the quality of life, a concern traceable back to her student days when she had been involved with the radical University Settlement in Ancoats. She was a founder of the Manchester and District New Estates Federation and became president of the National Federation of Community Associations in 1958. In the post-war years she supported the National Council for Civil Liberties and the National Council of Social Service, and was a member of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal from 1944 to 1950. 
It was natural that Mabel Tylecote's academic interests, her socialism, and deep awareness of inequalities in society led to an interest in politics, but it was the depression and the appeasement of fascism which made her seek a parliamentary seat in 1938. Her political career at local and national level might be judged a failure, for she fought five parliamentary elections as a Labour candidate in three constituencies -- Fylde, Middleton and Prestwich, and Norwich South -- without success from 1938 to 1955, and although on Manchester city council from 1940 to 1951 and a member of Stockport council from 1956 to 1963 she was never a powerful political force. However, the significance of her participation should not be underestimated. Her national election campaigns in Lancashire and Norfolk were powerful expositions of Attleean socialism, which contributed to greater understanding of the party and the concept of politically directed social reform: 'We seek by the control of selfish interests, freedom to plan our inheritance, to create those conditions and build up those services which will give to our people at last dignified, free and happy lives' (Election pamphlet, July 1945, Tylecote MSS). Her self-confident, energetic personality did much to enhance the still insecure image of women in public life and her vigorous campaigns increased the Labour vote. In local government she was a powerful advocate of improved living conditions, provision for leisure, and greater access to education. As a very active co-opted member of the Manchester education committee from 1951 to 1977 she ensured a high profile for issues of access and support. Through years of austerity and continuing Conservatism she represented generous and enlightened reform. At a sensitive time politically she never wavered from an internationalist outlook, developing close links with German adult education after the war, advocating close cultural links with the Soviet Union, and making many contacts with adult education in Europe. 
Mabel Tylecote was made DBE in 1966 for 'political and public services'. She remained closely associated with her university, but extended support to the new polytechnic in Manchester and was an active member of court, council, and governing body. In 1973 the polytechnic awarded her an honorary fellowship (a building in its successor, the Manchester Metropolitan University, commemorates her). In 1978 she became an honorary LLD of the Victoria University. Through an extremely active life of public speaking (she was a lay preacher) and laborious committee work she acted as a bridge between the older philanthropic reform of her family tradition and the concept of the welfare state. A truer estimate of her contribution than election results was demonstrated in both the respect and affection which permeated the commiserations when she lost her council seat in 1951, that of Eric James being typical in its regret of 'the loss of someone with your knowledge and enthusiasms' (Tylecote MSS). She and her distinguished co-worker in Manchester, Lady Shena Simon, represent a key group of middle-class women, not yet given their due by historians of the women's movement, who continued the struggle after the better-known pioneers identified and recorded in her 1941 book had passed away. 
Dame Mabel lived with her husband, son, and two stepchildren at Heaton Lodge, Stockport. Late in life she moved back to Manchester, where she died at her home, Alexandra House, 359 Wilbraham Road, Whalley Range, on 31 January 1987. She was cremated at Manchester crematorium.

Abrahams, Barnett (1831-1863), college head, was born in Warsaw, Poland, eldest child of Abraham Susman ('c'.1801-1880), known as Abraham Abrahams, and his second wife, Esther Reisel. His father, a leading authority on Jewish religious slaughter, settled in England in 1839 and was joined by his wife and son two years later. Two further sons were born in 1843 and 1844. 
Abrahams received his early rabbinical instruction from his father and later from the chief rabbi himself, Nathan Marcus Adler. In 1849 Abrahams was admitted to the Spanish and Portuguese congregation's theological college. The elders defrayed the cost of his education at the City of London School and University College, from which he graduated BA. Abrahams married on 7 June 1854 Jane (1834-1895), daughter of Abraham Rodrigues Brandon. There were six children of this marriage. Two of his sons, Joseph and Moses, became Jewish ministers, and Israel Abrahams became an author and teacher. 
In 1851 Barnett was invited to preach at Bevis Marks, the main synagogue of the Spanish and Portuguese community, and made a favourable impression. He became assistant 'dayan' in 1854, although there was no full 'dayan' at that time, and in 1856 was elected chief of the ecclesiastical court. His duties included the position of acting head of the community. He was the youngest man to act as 'dayan' in the London Jewish community and the first English Jewish minister to hold a British university degree. In 1858, on the resignation of Dr Loewe as headmaster of Jews' College, London, the Jewish theological seminary, Barnett was elected his successor and became principal of the college; he continued to carry out his religious duties. 
Barnett's chief interest was the education of the young, and he was the founder, in 1860, of the Association for the Diffusion of Religious Knowledge, the precursor of the Jewish Religious Education Board. This society provided a free sabbath school for Jewish children and distributed pamphlets on religion and history. Its first tract, entitled 'The Lamp, the Light, and the Way of Life' (n.d.), was written by him. 
Barnett Abrahams died unexpectedly, at Finsbury Square, London, on Sunday 15 November 1863, of acute rheumatism after an illness of a few days, and was buried the next day at the cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation, Mile End. The mourners were led by the chief rabbi. A daughter was born posthumously to Abrahams and his widow survived until 1895. Immediately after his death a memorial fund was opened for the benefit of his widow and children; it closed in May 1864, after just over $2000 had been raised. In December 1864 a tablet was erected in his memory by the Jewish infant school, Commercial Street, by the working classes of the Jewish faith. 
On 21 November 1863 a discourse on their founder was delivered by G. J. Emanuel to the Association for the Diffusion of Religious Knowledge. In a special service held in his memory on 22 November 1863 by A. P. Mendes on behalf of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation, it was said that as a teacher of men Abrahams was remarkable for his burning zeal. As a teacher of youth, he was patient, kind, and gentle. However, in an article published in the 'Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society' in 1968, Barnett's granddaughter maintained that he suffered from a violent temper and that his wife kept crockery available for him to smash to relieve his feelings.

Abrahams, Louis Barnett (1839-1918), headmaster, was born on 3 October 1839 at Swansea, the son of Barnett Abrahams (1785-1868) and his second wife, Hannah ('fl'. 1820-1868), the daughter of Locabel Levy of Lissa, Poland. There was also one daughter of this marriage. His father took the position of 'chazan', or synagogue cantor, in the Jewish congregation of Manchester in 1845. 
Abrahams received his early education at the Hebrew School of the Manchester congregation, but suffered a breakdown in health and was sent to live with his uncle, Rabbi Aaron, a rabbinic judge ('dayan') of the London Ashkenazi community. He entered the Jews' Free School, situated in Bell Lane, Whitechapel, as a pupil, and was taken on probation in 1854 as a pupil teacher by the headmaster, Moses Angel. Awarded the degree of BA by the University of London in 1863, he qualified by 1864 as a certified assistant teacher. He was singled out by being given charge of the seventh standard, which he taught for the next twenty years. Abrahams married on 11 February 1869 Fannie Rosetta ('b'. 1848), eldest daughter of Ephraim Mosely. A son and daughter were born in 1870 and 1871 respectively at 77 Tavistock Crescent, London. 
In 1869 the committee of the council on education raised his teacher's certificate, unusually, from the fourth degree to the first class of the third degree. By 1870 he was head of English at the Jews' Free School. In 1874, after graduating with honours from the Tonic Sol-Fa College, he was appointed superintendent of musical studies, and introduced the teaching of singing into the school. Abrahams was elected vice-master in 1884 with the practical management of the school in his hands. In 1897 he became headmaster on the retirement of Moses Angel, under the rules of the London county council, into whose control the school had passed. 
From 1884 onwards the effects were felt at the school of the influx of Russian Jews. Most of the children were unable to speak English. Although endeavouring to preserve a Jewish atmosphere at the school, Abrahams was opposed to the use of Yiddish, feeling it was a barrier to integration. The Anglicization of the pupils became in his eyes even more important as a bulwark against antisemitism. Abrahams instituted the first uniformed cadet corps to be introduced inside an elementary school and established a corps of the Jewish Lads' Brigade. A gymnasium was erected, swimming baths were started, and sports organized. With the erection of the Rothschild wing in 1897, he was able to supervise a technical school. 
Abrahams required all his pupil teachers to enter training college. His difficulties increased after the passing of the 'Education Acts' of 1902-3, as these involved a loss of independence and an increasing reliance on government funding. He also had to deal with a group of trade-union-orientated teachers. Despite his administrative duties, he nevertheless found time to compile a manual of scripture history for school use. As well as translating a Jewish prayer book into English, he composed a chronological history of England for his pupils. 
Louis Barnett Abrahams retired in 1907, having served the Jews' Free School for nearly fifty-four years and seen it grow into the largest elementary school in the country. He was presented with his portrait, which still hangs in the school. As well as his pioneering work at the school he acted as the first editor of the 'Jewish Record' in 1868. He also served as honorary secretary of the Jewish Religious Education Board at its foundation, treasurer of the Jewish branch of the Happy Evening Society, vice-president of the League of Mercy, and as a member of the Maccabean Physical Training Committee. Abrahams retired to Westcliff-on-Sea and became honorary president of the synagogue, finally settling at The Retreat, Portland Road, Hove, where he died on 3 June 1918, survived by his wife.

Alex, (Edward) Ephraim (1800-1882), founder of the Jewish Board of Guardians, was born on 12 December 1800 in St Katherine in the City of London. He was the eldest surviving son of Solomon Alex, dentist, of 11 Finsbury Place, Finsbury, and 21 Jewry Street, Aldgate, who was born abroad; his mother's name was probably Rachel. On 15 March 1840 Alex married Catherine, widow of Barron Jones and the daughter of Aaron Jones. They had no children and Catherine died on 16 June 1858. Alex practised as a dental surgeon at Bridge Street, Blackfriars, from 1829, and then at 35 Lower Brook Street, Westminster. 
At the beginning of the nineteenth century the charitable system for poor Jews of German and Polish descent operated under a system which had been established in 1753 to meet the needs of a community of 8000, but by 1858 this had grown to 40,000. Alex was overseer of the Great Synagogue, London, and it was due to his efforts that the Jewish Board of Guardians was founded. On 12 January 1858 the committee of the Great Synagogue, largely at Alex's insistence, resolved that a board of guardians be appointed to relieve the strange and foreign poor. Delegates from the three main German congregations agreed on 15 July 1858 to recommend to their synagogues the establishment of a board of guardians. In early 1859 Alex sent out for private circulation an eight-page pamphlet on the subject, and on 22 February 1859 called the attention of his vestry to the state of the foreign poor. At the preliminary meeting of the board of guardians, on 25 February 1859, Alex was requested to act as temporary chairman. Finally, on 16 March 1859, the first meeting of the board was held at the Great Synagogue chambers and Alex was unanimously elected president for twelve months. He remained president for ten years, and retired only because of failing health. In April 1866, at a special meeting of the board at which the lord mayor of London and the chief rabbi were present, a public address of thanks was given to him for his services, and in June 1869 the board resolved that he be elected a life member and his name be recorded in all proceedings as founder and first president. His portrait, which had been painted by Professor Hart, was purchased by voluntary subscribers and hung in the offices of the board of guardians. In May 1869 Alex was elected a member of the Society of Arts. 
After suffering from cancer of the bladder for nine months, but still an active member of the board, Alex died on 13 November 1882 at his home, 5 Chichester Street, Harrow Road. On his death a resolution of sympathy was passed by the Jewish Board of Guardians to his sisters. In a letter to the 'Jewish Chronicle' dated 17 November 1882, Lionel Cohen, president of the Jewish Board of Guardians, described the gentleness of disposition and suavity of manner, which, combined with firmness of purpose, enabled Alex to surmount difficulties. Laurie Magnus's 'The Jewish Welfare Board and the Men who Made it, 1859-1909' (1909) mentioned Alex's qualities of address, tact, and enthusiasm, which were invaluable to the long negotiations out of which this board had sprung. V. D. Lipman's 'A Century of Social Service, 1859-1959: the Jewish Board of Guardians' (1959) noted Alex's tactical skill in seizing an opportunity, which was responsible for the board's foundation. 
Alex's funeral took place at Willesden Jewish cemetery on 17 November 1882. His memorial stone, erected by his colleagues as a tribute of respect and esteem, was consecrated on Sunday 11 March 1883 by his friend the Revd A. L. Green, who died suddenly the same day. In 1963 the Jewish Board of Guardians became the Jewish Welfare Board, and in 1990 merged with the Jewish Blind Society to become Jewish Care, Anglo-Jewry's largest social services organization.

Angel, Moses (1817/18-1898), headmaster and journal editor, was one of the eleven children of Emmanuel Moses (died 1841), a publican, and his wife, Sarah. At some stage he transposed his name from Angel Moses to Moses Angel, probably in 1839 when his father was convicted at the Old Bailey for his part in a great coach robbery. 
In an interview given in the last year of his life (in 'Young Israel', 1898), Moses Angel said that at a young age he had been virtually adopted by a 'non-Jewish gentleman'. At the age of eight, he became a boarder at Henry Solomon's school in Hammersmith, where he was made school captain. He attended University College School in 1831 and 1832, and was immediately placed in the sixth form. By special grace of the council of University College, London, he was allowed to sit in on their lectures, and matriculated at the age of fourteen. It was intended that he should enter the law, but just when he was due to start his patron's business failed and his legal career was aborted. 
Thrown back on his own resources, in 1838 Angel started work as a clerk at the Dublin branch of the Provincial Bank of Ireland. He left in 1840 to take up a position as English master at the Jews' Free School, in Bell Lane, Spitalfields, London. In August 1842 he was elevated to headmaster, an office he held for fifty-five unbroken years until he retired in November 1897. He was also appointed editor of the 'Jewish Chronicle', the first edition of which appeared in October 1841, and he later joined the rival publication, 'Voice of Jacob'. For a short time he combined his teaching and editing duties, but resigned from the journals when he no longer had time to meet both commitments. 
A practising Orthodox Jew, Angel married Rebecca, daughter of G. Godfrey, on 11 January 1843. The couple had three sons and three daughters, and for many years their home was the master's house on the school premises. Autocratic and meticulous, Moses Angel had an indomitably strong will and resolute perseverance. A superb teacher, organizer, and administrator, he believed that discipline led to efficiency, and presided over the growth of the school roll from 500 pupils to 4250; it was the largest elementary school in Great Britain, and probably in the world, at that time. 'He has the School in his entire command' ('Jewish Chronicle', 14 July 1854), wrote Matthew Arnold on his first inspection of the Jews' Free School in 1843. Forward-looking, he was held in high esteem by government. A. J. Mundella, minister of education, said that when he wanted an impartial opinion 'free from prejudice, free from all selfishness, there is no man I can apply to with so much confidence as to Mr Angel' (ibid., 4 Jan 1889). 
Despite his enormous administrative burden, Angel was at the school entrance when pupils arrived, and saw them off at the end of the day. He moved around the school constantly, but still found time to teach several classes each week, at all levels. The school's curriculum and facilities, largely due to the beneficent support of the Rothschild family, were a remarkable achievement for an elementary school of that time. Its teachers were drawn almost exclusively from the ranks of former pupils and pupil-teachers, each one of whom benefited from his personal supervision when they attended University College, London, to obtain their teacher's qualification. 
According to James Picciotto, Angel's numerous contributions to the Anglo-Jewish press, usually under the 'nom de plume' A, displayed great erudition and marked literary powers (Picciotto, 406). Angel's well-received book 'The Law of Sinai and its Appointed Times' (1858) was written in the hope that it would contribute to a better understanding between Jew and Christian. 
During Moses Angel's time as headmaster, one-third of all London's Jewish children, a high percentage of whom were foreign-born, passed through his hands. The school was Anglo-Jewry's main vehicle for integrating the Jewish poor into English society, and in this regard Angel probably had more influence in moulding nineteenth- and twentieth-century Anglo-Jewry than any other individual. He died at his London home, 12 Randolph Crescent, Maida Vale, on 2 September 1898, in his eighty-first year, and was buried in the Willesden cemetery of the United Synagogue.

Artom, Benjamin (1835-1879), rabbi, was born in Asti, Piedmont, Italy, the son of Elia Artom, scion of a well-known and talented Jewish family which probably originated from Germany. Artom trained as a rabbi, and held a number of rabbinical posts in Italy; he was the first to hold the post of rabbi of Naples. In 1866 he accepted a call to become the spiritual leader, or 'haham' (chief rabbi, literally 'wise man'), of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews in London, a post he retained until his death. On 10 February 1875 in London Artom married a thirty-year-old widow, Henrietta Hababa David (died 1921), the daughter of David Esekiel. 
The community to which Artom moved was historically the oldest congregation of Jews in Britain, and worshipped in an imposing synagogue built at the beginning of the eighteenth century in Bevis Marks in the City of London. The community contained within it some of the most important Anglo-Jewish families, notably the Montefiores, also of Italian origin; Moses Montefiore bestrode Anglo-Jewry like a colossus, but his intolerance of religious 'reformers', though shared by other members of the congregation, had led to schism. Many families had left Bevis Marks to join the West London Synagogue established by reformers in 1842; others married out of the faith. The previous 'haham', Raphael Meldola (who was also Italian), had died in 1828. The failure of the community to replace him reflected its spiritual and demographic decline. 
During the 1850s and 1860s, when the major Ashkenazi synagogues in London were contemplating amalgamation, the Bevis Marks congregation came under pressure to incorporate itself within this amalgamation, and to recognize the Ashkenazi chief rabbi, Nathan Marcus Adler, as its spiritual head. The appointment of Artom was in some measure the response of Bevis Marks to these overtures. Artom trod a difficult and delicate path. He needed to maintain the independent status of the community of which he was the head, revive its flagging fortunes, but at the same time remain on good terms with the Ashkenazi majority. He achieved all these ends. 
On his arrival in London Artom knew no English, and he delivered his first sermon in French; later, however, his mastery of English was such that his sermons were published in book form (1873). Artom was also a talented musician, and introduced new melodies as well as new prayers into the liturgy of Bevis Marks. He extended the influence of the congregation beyond its own confines. In 1870 he agreed to consecrate a new synagogue erected by the community of Dutch Jews in the City of London (after Nathan Adler had refused to do so), and two years later gave his blessing to the establishment of the first Sephardi synagogue in Manchester. In 1877 he further demonstrated the independence of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews by agreeing to accept converts into Sephardi Judaism in England. Artom died suddenly on 6 January 1879 at 3 Marine Parade, Brighton, aged forty-four, and was buried that day.

Asher, Asher (1837-1889), physician and community worker, was born on 16 February 1837 in Glasgow, the first son of Philip Asher, son of Rabbi Zev Wolf of Lublin, and his wife, Hannah, a native of the Netherlands. From an early age he was an assiduous scholar of Jewish and secular subjects, winning prizes at St Enoch's parish school, Glasgow high school, and the University of Glasgow; his medical degree in 1856, when he was only nineteen years old, was the first achieved by a Glasgow-born Jew. At first he worked as a parochial medical officer in the mining town of Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow. He augmented the meagre $15 annual income with private medical work, while always being ready to treat the needy without charge. He was active within the small Jewish community of about two hundred souls then in Glasgow, serving as the first Jewish medical officer to the Hebrew Philanthropic Society from 1858 and as honorary secretary of the Hebrew congregation from 1860. 
Asher left for London in 1862 and joined Jacob Canstatt in practice, devotedly providing medical care for the Jewish poor of London under the auspices of the newly formed London Jewish Board of Guardians. His meticulously recorded accounts of the health of those he cared for are clear evidence of his concern and desire to improve their medical lot. In 1866 he became secretary to the Great Synagogue in London, though he remained involved in giving advice on health matters (especially during the 1866 London cholera outbreak). On the formation of the United Synagogue in 1870 he became its first secretary. His diplomatic and financial skills were of great assistance in the establishment and smooth functioning of the fledgeling body. He was credited with the early success of the United Synagogue's programme for visiting hospitals, prisons, and asylums, and acted as an able representative of the community to the Home Office and hospital authorities. He was involved in the founding of the Jewish convalescent home at Norwood and was its honorary medical officer. Thus, combining his medical and organizational skills, Asher continued to work tirelessly for the Jewish poor. In January 1864 he married Lucy, daughter of Samuel Garcia, a prominent member of the Sephardi Jewish community in London; they had two sons, Pinchas (Philip) and Samuel, and one daughter, Hannah. 
Co-operating with leading philanthropists Asher travelled to Russia, the United States, and the Holy Land, giving advice on ameliorating the lot of Jewish immigrants. He visited Jerusalem with Samuel Montagu in 1875 to report on conditions in the city for the Moses Montefiore Testimonial Fund, set up to mark the great philanthropist's ninetieth birthday, which led to improvements in the situation of the Jews there. However, he was criticized within the traditional community of the Old Yishuv because of his emphasis on secular education. Asher maintained close links with the Rothschild family, regularly enlisting their support for communal and charitable matters. His knowledge of Yiddish and of medicine were of great value in screening the thousands of Jewish refugees from Russia who poured through London after 1880, and in his assessment of their plight in Galicia during his visit in 1884. 
Asher combined strict religious observance with a considerable freedom of thought and an abhorrence of those customs which he condemned as superstitious. His tact, diplomacy, and understanding of the views of others were legendary. When asked by the relatives of a sick man, 'Shall we have him blessed?' he would reply, 'Yes, if it gives you satisfaction, but -- dont forget to give him the medicine regularly' ('Jewish Chronicle', 11 Jan 1889). Blessed with an encyclopaedic knowledge, Asher's Jewish learning encompassed the full range of rabbinic literature. He wrote extensively on Jewish life and practice and was a frequent correspondent on these subjects in the columns of the 'Jewish Chronicle'. Asher took a special interest in 'brit mila' and was a leading member of the Chevrat Haknesset Brit (Circumcision Society). In 1873 he published a monograph on circumcision which dealt with the religious and historical aspects of the rite, and his belief that circumcision should be conducted in conformity with both 'halacha' (religious law) and modern surgical practice. 
Asher's death at his home, 18 Endsleigh Street, Tavistock Square, London, at only fifty-one years, of lung cancer, on 7 January 1889, was widely mourned. He was survived by his wife. He was buried in Willesden cemetery on 9 January. Asher left a legacy of religious practice, intellectual rigour, and devotion to Jewish study allied with often somewhat heterodox views. A memorial plaque was erected in his memory at the entrance of the Garnethill synagogue, home of the Scottish Jewish Archives Centre. The Asher Asher memorial gold medal was instituted in 1910 to be awarded annually at the University of Glasgow in the class of diseases of the throat and nose. Asher remained deeply respected in Glasgow as a role model for religious and secular learning and for communal service. 
Asher's career was of great significance. He graduated in medicine at a time when, because of the 'University Test Acts' (which were not repealed until 1872), professing Jews in Britain could obtain university medical degrees only in Scotland. In the years after Asher's death, following persecution and economic disruption in eastern Europe and mass migration westwards, the Jewish community in Glasgow grew rapidly, numbering about 8000 by 1914. It was to be the sons of these immigrants who were to utilize the educational opportunities available, entering the University of Glasgow above all, in significant numbers and almost to the exclusion of all other subjects, to follow Asher's example and study medicine. Indeed, his obituary in the 'Jewish Chronicle' remarked that Asher exemplified the union of thought combined with practice in the noble tradition of the great Jewish physician Moses Maimonides (1135-1204).

Barnett, John Francis (1837-1916), composer and pianist, born in London on 16 October 1837, was the son of a singing teacher, Joseph Alfred Barnett (the younger brother of the composer John Barnett), and his wife, 'nee' Hudson. He showed an early talent for music and began to study the piano at the age of six. In 1848 he commenced piano lessons with Henry Wylde and the following year won the king's scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. Before entering the academy he studied organ with George Cooper and acted as organist, first at the Roman Catholic church in Warwick Street and then at St Aloysius, Clarendon Square, where his father was choirmaster. He took up his scholarship in 1852 or 1853, and in the same year played Mendelssohn's D minor piano concerto at a New Philharmonic Society concert under Spohr's conductorship. In 1857, having completed his studies at the academy, Barnett travelled to Germany, intending to perform as a solo pianist; in Leipzig, however, he enrolled at the conservatory and studied counterpoint under Moritz Hauptmann and E. F. Richter, composition under Julius Rietz, and piano under Ignaz Moscheles and Louis Plaidy. Towards the end of this period his op. 1, a 'caprice brillante' for piano, was published by Kistner. Shortly before returning to England he performed Mendelssohn's D minor concerto at a Gewandhaus concert on 22 March 1860. 
The following month Barnett appeared with great success in London as the soloist in Beethoven's fifth piano concerto at a New Philharmonic Society concert. A contemporary reviewer remarked that he had spent the last couple of years, 'as we are enabled to judge from his playing on Monday evening, studying and practising with zeal and determination' ('Musical World', 256). During the next few years he composed a succession of characteristic piano pieces, among them 'Three Sketches', op. 2, and 'Return of Spring', op. 7. His op. 8, published about 1863, however, was a string quartet in D minor, and it was a symphony in A minor (unpublished), performed at the Musical Society of London on 15 June 1864 and repeated at the Crystal Palace Saturday concerts, which drew attention to Barnett's merits as a composer. This led to his first commission, a cantata for the 1867 Birmingham festival. The success of the resulting composition, 'The Ancient Mariner', for which he arranged his own text from Coleridge's poem, led to further commissions. The rapid proliferation of choral societies throughout Britain created a steady demand for such works, and during the following decades Barnett composed 'Paradise and the Peri' (1870), 'The Raising of Lazarus' (1873), 'The Good Shepherd' (1876), 'The Building of the Ship' (1880), 'The Wishing Bell' (1893), and 'The Eve of St Agnes' (1913), as well as a number of smaller choral works. Other compositions included a piano concerto, a number of descriptive pieces for orchestra, a few chamber works, and many piano pieces and songs. In 1883 he completed Schubert's E major symphony from the autograph sketch belonging to Sir George Grove; he described the process in 'Proceedings of the Musical Association' (17, 1890-91, 177). His 'Musical Reminiscences and Impressions', published in 1906, gives a valuable account of the musicians and music-making of his time. 
Barnett was a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music. He was among the professors at the National Training School for Music from 1876 to 1882, and joined the staff of its successor, the Royal College of Music, in 1883. He also taught at the Guildhall School of Music from its establishment in 1880. During these years he continued to perform publicly as a pianist and occasionally appeared as a conductor. On 4 September 1875 he married Alice Dora Booth, the daughter of the artist Lorenzo John Booth, with whom he had several children. She died in 1882, and on 25 July 1891 he married Mary Millicent Tussaud, the daughter of Joseph Tussaud. Barnett died at 56 Acacia Road, St John's Wood, London, on 24 November 1916.

Benmohel, Nathan Lazarus (1803-1869), Hebrew and German scholar, was born in Hamburg, Germany, son of Rabbi Elieza Lazi (1741-1841), presiding judge, or 'dayan', of Posen, and the united congregations of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck. His mother was the daughter of Rabbi Todros Munk of Posen. Benmohel arrived in Dublin about 1827, accompanied by his elder brother, Alexander Lazarus, formerly secretary and preacher in the Portsmouth Jewish community, and Alexander's wife, Rosa. 
After private tuition and matriculation, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 6 February 1832; he won prizes for answering in Hebrew in 1835 and three times in 1836. Having subscribed to the 'Thirty-Nine Articles' of the Church of England, he graduated BA in 1836. Benmohel was the first person of the Jewish faith to graduate from a British university open only to Anglicans. In June 1846 he took his MA degree. He taught German at Trinity College from 1839 to 1842, deputizing for the professor of French and German during illness, and appears to have taught Hebrew privately. He finished in 1830, but never published, a work entitled 'Orthographia Hebraeo Anglicana', and was the author of a number of scholarly translations from the Hebrew. In 1851 he read a paper to the Royal Irish Academy, published in the proceedings of the academy, on 'etymological criticism'. His certificate of entry into Trinity College, his master's diploma, and two letters written by him were displayed at the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition in London in 1887. 
In spite of his descent from a rabbinical and communally minded family, Benmohel acquired a reputation for unorthodoxy and for being very lax in observance. He held no office in the Dublin congregation, and appears to have had little to do with his co-religionists. He died at Sandycove, Dublin, on 22 December 1869. Although he had conformed some time after entering Trinity College, he was allowed to be buried on the periphery of the Jewish cemetery at Ballybough out of respect for his sister-in-law, to whom he had frequently expressed his wish to be buried there.

Archibald [ii] married Ann (died 1864), daughter of William Paget, a Unitarian and banker of Leicestershire, whose loans aided the Kenrick enterprise. The couple had four sons and three daughters. The ill health of Archibald and Timothy's extensive business activities outside the firm meant that their involvement in the day-to-day management of the firm declined during the third quarter of the century. Timothy served as chairman of Lloyds Bank, and was a founder of the Nurses' Training Institution in Birmingham, for which he purchased a home. Timothy was married to Maria Paget (1808-1876), and the couple had three sons and six daughters. Archibald [ii] died at Berrow Court, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 10 March 1878.

doc= 59298


William Kenrick (1831-1919), who in 1857 became a full partner together with his father, brother, and Timothy. The commercial success of Timothy's 1846 patent for glazing and enamelling the metal surfaces of cast iron led to investment and the growth of home and overseas sales. On incorporation in 1883, still owned and controlled by the family, Archibald Kenrick & Sons Ltd employed roughly 700 workers and was capitalized at $201,700. Capital was increased to $301,700 in 1899, by which time employment had almost doubled since 1883. As one of the two largest British hardware manufacturers, the company had reached its peak. 
John Arthur Kenrick was educated at a private school in Handsworth, the Edgbaston proprietary school, and the Hove School. When he was eighteen his father's illness compelled him to withdraw from University College, London, to assist Timothy in the family firm. After similar schooling, William's studies of mathematics and chemistry at University College were completed with distinction. While John Arthur took responsibility for production, William's contribution was in commercial management, though between 1872 and 1911 John Arthur was chairman of the Cast Iron Hollowware Manufacturers' Association which regulated price competition in the home market. From the 1860s both Kenrick brothers became increasingly engaged in other business ventures and in public affairs. John Arthur continued as chairman of the company until 1898, though from the entry into the firm in 1873 of his successor, George Hamilton Kenrick (1850-1939), cousin to the two senior partners, the day-to-day commercial management became his responsibility. After 1868 production management was delegated to Frederick Ryland, a professional engineer who was also the first non-family manager (and from 1883 director) employed in the family firm. John Arthur became a director and chairman of both Nettlefolds Ltd and William Elliott & Sons Ltd, and a director of Lloyds Bank and of the Union Rolling Stock Company. In 1878 he bought the 'West Bromwich Free Press' with the intention of restoring its fortunes; this purchase led to the formation of Kenrick and Jefferson, which became a commercial printer on a large scale. 
In their public activities, John Arthur and William continued the family tradition. Archibald [ii] had been chairman of the board of commissioners and of the local Liberal Party in West Bromwich. Timothy, too, was a Liberal, both were Unitarians, supported the Education League, and together built a school for the children of local workers. Archibald [ii] was chairman of the Provident Medical Dispensary from 1864, while Timothy was involved in the management of Birmingham General Hospital and a founder of the Nurses' Training Institution. In 1858 the brothers purchased Aston Hall and Park as a place for public recreation. 
John Arthur's public activities were concentrated in West Bromwich where he became chairman of the board of guardians, of the highway board, and later of the improvement committee which governed the town's development between 1866 and 1882. He was also president of the West Bromwich Liberal Association. In 1866 he married Clara, daughter of the Revd John Taylor; they had four sons and four daughters. He died at Berrow Court, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 23 April 1926. 
William's public life centred upon Birmingham. In 1862 he married Mary Chamberlain, the elder sister of Joseph Chamberlain, with whom William became a close political ally. Kenrick and his wife had two sons and two daughters. William's sister Harriet was the first wife of Joseph Chamberlain, and his cousin Florence Kenrick the second wife. A member of the Education League from 1866, in 1869 William represented one of four Unitarian business families, the others being the Nettlefolds, the Martineaus, and the Chamberlains, who together contributed a total of $5000 to launch the National Educational League. Under Joseph Chamberlain's leadership this organization spearheaded the campaign to transform Birmingham nonconformity into a militant, reforming force on a national scale. Between 1866 and 1877 William was also a member of the council of the Midland Institute, though his special interest in technical education was reflected in membership of the managing committee of the Birmingham School of Art, inaugurated in 1874, of which he became chairman in 1883. He was also instrumental in setting up the Jewellers' School and in creating scholarships to promote craft education. 
William was chairman of the general committee of the National Liberal Federation from 1882 to 1886 and became MP for North Birmingham in 1885. Before then his public life was dominated by activities related to Birmingham politics. He represented the Edgbaston ward between 1870 and 1911, becoming mayor in 1877. He was a central figure in the progressive, reforming campaigns mounted by the group of predominantly nonconformist businessmen and Liberal town councillors led by Joseph Chamberlain. He was chairman of the watch committee from 1874 to 1876, and of the gas committee from 1880 to 1883, when he assumed responsibility for the continued success of this municipal enterprise, the profitability of which was planned to underpin a civic revolution, transform the urban environment, and enrich the town's cultural and recreational endowments. Progress towards these goals was assisted further by William's position as a member of the free libraries committee and chairman of the museum and school of art committee from 1884, when the school was transferred to the corporation, until 1911. His contribution to museum development began in 1880 when he was a founder member of the Art Gallery purchase committee; from then on donations of pictures and money for further acquisitions enhanced the national reputation of Birmingham Art Gallery. On the national political stage, he was chairman of the general committee of the National Liberal Federation between 1882 and 1886. Between 1885 and 1899 he was the liberal, and subsequently Liberal Unionist, MP for North Birmingham, his contribution at Westminster deriving mainly from his knowledge and experience of local government. In 1911 William received the freedom of the city of Birmingham, an acknowledgement of his role as one of the architects of the social and political character of modern Birmingham. He died on 31 July 1919 at The Grove, Harborne Park Road, Harborne, Birmingham. Later chairmen of the company included Sir George Hamilton Kenrick (1850-1936), Wilfrid Byng Kenrick (1872-1962), and Wilfrid's son William Edmund Kenrick. 
The hardware manufacturing business founded by Archibald [i] Kenrick in the mid-1780s had, a century later, become one of the two largest firms of its kind in the country. Successive members of the family, through technical innovation and shrewd marketing, established a reputation for its light and attractive cast-iron hollowware and hardware. Retaining their Unitarian affiliation, the Kenricks were active in local Liberal politics, and were significant civic and philanthropic figures in the Birmingham and West Bromwich areas.

Sarah Mary Fitton (c.1796-1874), writer, was probably born in Dublin. With another sister, Elizabeth ('fl'. 1817-1834), she wrote the popular 'Conversations on Botany' for the series of elementary science works published by Longmans and otherwise dominated by Jane Marcet's titles. This went through nine editions between 1817 and 1840. It features eighteen dialogues between a mother and her boy pupil conveying the principles of the Linnaean system of classification and information about useful plants. The hand-coloured illustrations are by George Sowerby and, although it was issued anonymously, later editions indicate that Sarah Fitton wrote most of the text, assisted by Elizabeth. It is sometimes wrongly attributed to Maria Elizabeth Jacson or Mrs Marcet.

Fritz Baedeker (1844-1925), took over a flourishing business. Fritz was born on 4 December 1844 in Koblenz and entered the family firm. Under his guidance the range of guidebooks continued to expand, and increasing emphasis was put on simultaneous French and English editions. These were not simply literal translations: each was adapted to the needs, preferences, and experiences of travellers from each country, but all had a strong emphasis on cultural sites, supplying accurate details of art galleries, cathedrals, and churches at a time when few individual guides were available. In 1872 the Baedeker firm with its cartographers H. Wagner and E. Debes, whose high-quality maps contributed considerably to the guides, moved to Leipzig, then the centre of the German book trade.

(Richmond Leslie) Stansmore Dean (1866-1944), painter, was born at 105 Breadalbane Terrace, Hill Street, Glasgow, on 3 June 1866, the youngest of the six children of Alexander Davidson Dean, an engraver and a co-founder of the printing firm of Gilmour and Dean, and his wife, Jean Leslie. From 1883 Stansmore Dean studied at the Glasgow School of Art, where she became friends with Margaret Rowat, the sister of Jessie Newbery, and was a fellow student of C. R. Mackintosh and Bessie MacNicol. She was the first woman student to win the school's Haldane travelling bursary in 1890, and went to the Academie Colarossi in Paris to study under August Courtois. At the beginning of the twentieth century she established her own studio in Glasgow and exhibited at the Glasgow Institute, in Paisley, and in Liverpool. She showed twice with the International Society in London; her work, for example 'Meditation' ('c'.1899; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) and 'Girl in a Straw Hat' ('c'.1910; priv. coll.), shows the influence of J. A. M. Whistler, president of that society. When exhibiting work her masculine-sounding name, which was a family one, may have been an advantage. An active member of the Lady Artists' Club and a forceful personality, she put forward Mackintosh as the man to carry out alterations and redecoration of the club's premises in Blythswood Square. His distinctive black entrance porch was erected before the club's council overrode her recommendations as convenor of the decorating committee. On 30 April 1902 she married the artist Robert Macaulay Stevenson (1854-1952). He was a widower, and she helped to bring up his young daughter, Jean. This left her with fewer opportunities to develop her own career, and financial worries obliged them to let Robinsfield, their large house by Bardowie Loch to the north of Glasgow, where each had their own studio. They went to live at Montreuil-sur-Mer in northern France, where they both worked throughout the First World War with the Church of Scotland huts helping the soldiers. They returned to Robinsfield in 1926 but left again in 1932 to live in Kirkcudbright, then home to several Scottish painters, and Borgue. Stansmore Dean died at Castle Douglas, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 15 December 1944. Her portrait of the writer Neil Munro ('c'.1905) is in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. 
Bessie MacNicol ['see 'MacNicol, Elizabeth] studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1887 to 1892. In 1896 she painted a portrait of Edward Atkinson Hornel, one of the Glasgow Boys, in his studio in Kirkcudbright and was subsequently much influenced by his use of colour and interest in paint textures. So much did she share stylistically with 'the Boys' that many members of the Glasgow Art Club (which did not then admit women painters) attended her funeral and left a wreath mourning 'the loss of a true artist' (Burkhauser, 197).

Norah Neilson Gray (1882-1931), painter, was born on 16 June 1882 at Carisbrooke, 108 West King Street, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, the second youngest daughter among the seven children of George William Gray, a Glasgow shipowner, and his wife, Norah Neilson. She first studied locally at The Studio with Miss Park and Miss Ross, but the family moved to Glasgow, where she was a student at the Glasgow School of Art from 1901 to 1906. She taught fashion-plate design at the school and also taught art to the girls of St Columba's School, Kilmalcolm, before establishing her position as a portrait painter with her first solo exhibition in 1910 at Warneuke's Gallery, Glasgow. During the First World War she painted several important pictures, including 'The Belgian Refugee' (1916; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) and 'The Country's Charge', bought by the manufacturer Joseph Bibby and presented to the Royal Free Hospital, London. In 1918 she went as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse to the Abbaye de Royaumont, near Paris, which was staffed by women of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, and in her free time painted the arrival of the wounded in the old vaulted hall of the abbey. She was later commissioned to paint the surgeon Frances Ivens, with hospital staff and patients in the abbey cloisters. 'The Scottish Women's Hospital' (1920) is now in the Imperial War Museum, London. After the war Gray resumed portrait painting and excelled particularly with young children. 'Little Brother' (1920-22, exh. RA, 1922; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) was bought by Glasgow corporation at the memorial exhibition of her work in Glasgow in 1932. Gray exhibited annually at the Paris Salon des Artistes Francais and was awarded their silver medal in 1923; she was better known abroad than in her own country. Her watercolours, for example, 'July Night, Loch Lomond' ('c'.1922; priv. coll.), were notable for their modernist approach and pointilliste technique. Gray died of cancer at the height of her career at 1 St James Terrace, Glasgow, on 27 May 1931. 
In 1988 the Glasgow School of Art mounted the exhibition ''Glasgow Girls': Women in the Art School, 1880-1920'. This was well received, and the work of this talented group of designers and painters was recognized, in some cases for the first time. The exhibition led to the publication of ''Glasgow Girls': Women in art and design, 1880-1920' (1990; rev. edn, 1993), edited by Jude Burkhauser.

Eleanor Allen Moore (1885-1955), painter, was born on 26 July 1885 at Glenfield, Glenwherry, co. Antrim, Northern Ireland, the daughter of Hamilton Moore (1856-1927), an Irish Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Annie Kinnear Stephen (1860-1940) of St Cyrus, Kincardineshire. Her childhood was spent at Newmilns in Ayrshire, where her father was minister of Loudoun parish. She studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1902 to 1907. As a daughter of the manse she was dependent on bursary assistance, and was encouraged by Fra Newbery, who was still teaching painting classes himself until 1906, when Maurice Grieffenhagen joined the staff. Since she was unable to afford models, her earlier work consisted of large richly painted self-portraits in various guises, for example, 'Marmalade' ('c'.1913; priv. coll.) and 'The Silk Dress' ('c'.1919; priv. coll.). On 29 June 1922 she married Robert Cecil Robertson (1889-1942), a doctor of medicine, and their daughter was born in 1923. In 1925 the family sailed for Shanghai, where her husband took up an appointment in public health. Eleanor Moore continued to paint portraits of British army and naval officers, but with the help of the Shanghai Art Club was also able to paint Chinese men, women, and children of all ages. As anti-foreigner riots began to die down she was able to explore the Yangztze (Yangzi) delta by houseboat and visited the walled cities of Soochow and Wusih. She painted landscapes and townscapes, but her preference was to paint portraits of Chinese people. A good example is 'The Letter Writer' ('c'.1936; priv. coll.). Though she loved Chinese art, her own remained uninfluenced by it. With other British women and children she was evacuated from Shanghai in 1937 and went to live in Hong Kong. Following her husband's death there on 4 August 1942 she returned to Scotland and died at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, on 17 September 1955. Her ashes were interred in Loudoun cemetery, Ayrshire.

Abraham [iii] Mocatta (1797-1880), grandson of Abraham [ii] through his third son, Jacob. Abraham [iii] had joined as a partner in 1826. On 27 May 1818 he had married Miriam, daughter of Gabriel Israel Brandon; they had two sons and two daughters: the elder son, Frederic David Mocatta (1828-1905), joined the firm about 1843 and was admitted a partner in 1849. Frederic married Mary Ada (1836-1905), daughter of the politician Frederick David Goldsmid, in 1856; there were no children of the marriage. 
Under their leadership the business was revitalized, and it now benefited from gold discoveries in California and Australia and the consequent shift of the world towards a gold standard. Abraham [iii] retired in 1859 and died at 35 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, in central London, on 21 April 1880. His son Frederic followed him into retirement in 1874 leaving an outsider, Sir Hector Hay, baronet (1821-1916), and two nephews, Benjamin and Abraham ('c'.1853-1891), to lead the business. 
More than any other member of his family, Frederic made his mark away from the City, largely through his promotion of philanthropy and Jewish religion and culture. Educated at home he excelled at history and became fluent in five or six languages. As a young man he supported Jewish schools in London's East End and later extended his interests: 'the condition of the working classes of all creeds, the improvement of their dwellings, and the administration of charities -- Jewish and gentile, public and private -- with a view to promoting the independence of the poor, were amongst the principal objects which engaged his attention. (F. D. Mocatta, 17)' Frederic was a founding member of the Charity Organization Society, which sought to prevent duplication of effort and promote proper management. He favoured the amalgamation of institutions to create more effective and viable units; he was the architect of the Home for Aged Jews and of the Jewish Orphanage. He also promoted the Charity Voting Reform Association and gave generously to charitable institutions ranging from the Factory Girls' Country Home Fund to the Philanthropic Society for the Reformation of Criminal Children. But his philosophy was to render the poor independent of charity and thus cure the causes of poverty. For this reason he opposed the provision of state pensions in old age. As a member of the Jewish Board of Guardians he was concerned with the welfare of Jewish immigrants in London's East End. He worked also for the well-being of Jews persecuted in Russia and Romania.
