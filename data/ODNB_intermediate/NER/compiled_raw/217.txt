Fulkherd, Quentin (fl. 1407-1410), alleged Lollard heretic, is identified only in two English safe conducts from 1407, as 'Quintin Folkhard of Scotland', and in a batch of his letters dated 1410 and entitled 'Nova Scocie', which are preserved in a Prague manuscript ['see under 'Haldenston, James]; these describe him as an esquire. The safe conducts possibly imply that he was an emissary between the English and Scottish courts, for reference is made to his returning to Henry IV's presence from Scotland. If he visited the English court in this period, he may have encountered some of the evangelical (and allegedly Lollard) knights who were then active in English public life and who could have influenced him, but this is only conjecture. It may not, however, be merely coincidental that the letters were sent in a year in which contacts are recorded between Sir John Oldcastle (died 1417), the leader of the English Lollard rising of 1414, and the Bohemian reformers. The letters, written in Latin and containing scriptural and patristic quotations, show that Fulkherd was a man of some education, although there is no evidence for his attending any university. One letter was addressed to the bishop of Glasgow, so Fulkherd might have come from that diocese. The letters were written to the whole community of Christendom, the bishop of Glasgow and the Scottish clergy, the secular lords of the country, and Fulkherd's parish priest. Their general tone is more anti-clerical than heretical, and suggests that Fulkherd's principal concern was to encourage moral reform in the church. His only potentially heretical demand is that the scriptures and the articles of faith should be preached to the people in the vernacular, something which the preamble to the letters says he had actually done. He does not express any view on transubstantiation, the most significant Lollard theological deviation, and acknowledges ecclesiastical jurisdiction over heresy -- in the second letter he writes that he would accept the church's correction if they could disprove his charges against the clergy. After 1410 Fulkherd disappears from the records and, although there is evidence of measures against heresy in Scotland in the following decade, the suggestion that he was the anonymous Lollard burnt at Glasgow in 1422 remains unproven.

Gordon family (per. c.1300-c.1400), nobility, held the Berwickshire baronies of Gordon and Huntly during the fourteenth century. At that time a family of middling significance, the Gordons are also important as the progenitors of the earls of Huntly and dukes of Gordon who dominated the north of Scotland from the mid-fifteenth century. They first came to prominence in the person of

Sir John Gordon (d. 1391x5), the great-grandson of the elder Sir Adam. Like his predecessors John Gordon was primarily concerned with the family's Berwickshire lands. He was involved in a major raid against the English at Roxburgh fair in the 1370s, and as part of the skirmishing that resulted from this attack John led a force across the Tweed in order to raid English cattle. He was overtaken by a larger force led by Sir John Lilburn before he could recross the river, and was forced to fight at Carham. Despite the uneven odds Gordon emerged victorious, capturing Lilburn and his brother and being 'gretly pryssit' for his deeds. Despite receiving serious wounds during this raid, Gordon was still able to continue his defensive role on the borders, and in a second major incident, in 1378, he and his followers intercepted and defeated a force led by Sir Thomas Musgrave (died 1385), warden of Berwick, who was riding to join an expedition led by Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland (died 1408), against the lands of the earl of March. In 1388 he fought alongside the earl of Douglas at the battle of Otterburn. 
The 1390s saw the first known involvement of the Gordons with north-east Scotland, when Sir John was a royal justiciar appointed to resolve a dispute between Gilbert Greenlaw, bishop of Aberdeen, and Sir John Forbes, lord of that ilk. It seems unlikely that Gordon had been in the north-east long, and his presence was probably connected to a period of relative quiet on the Scottish border. It is not clear whether Gordon returned south again, but he died between 30 May 1391 and 11 October 1395. He was not legally married, although he had two sons, John and Thomas, through a 'handfasting' marriage to Elizabeth Cruickshank, daughter of the laird of Aswanley. It may have been the desire to gain the support of the descendants of these sons that encouraged Alexander Seton, first earl of Huntly (died 1470) -- the son of Sir Alexander Seton and Elizabeth Gordon -- to change his family name to Gordon in or about 1457. 
Sir John was succeeded as lord of Gordon by his brother

Graham family (per. c.1250-1513), nobility, was descended from Anglo-Norman immigrants who came to Scotland under William the Lion and increased in importance from the twelfth century, particularly through the patronage of the Comyns, securing the lordships of Dalkeith and Eskdale in Edinburghshire. David Graham, a member of a junior branch of the family, served Patrick, fifth earl of Dunbar, and was deputy justiciar of Lothian in 1248. A notable accumulator of estates, in 1253 he obtained royal confirmation for eighteen grants of land, including Eliston and Kinpunt in the west of Lothian, Dundaff and Strathcarron in Stirlingshire, and lands in Cunningham and Carrick. Substantial grants from the earl of Lennox were to form the basis of the Graham barony of Mugdock, and grants of land in Perthshire by Malise, earl of Strathearn, were to form the barony of Kincardine. Graham supported the Comyns in 1255, and shared their political eclipse, but was back in favour as sheriff of Berwick by 1264. He died 'c'.1272 and was succeeded by his son, Patrick, who consolidated his father's estates in Lennox and Strathearn and took an active part in national politics following the death of Alexander III. Sheriff of Stirling by 1289, he served as one of the Scottish auditors in 1291, and was a steadfast supporter of John Balliol until he met his death at Dunbar in 1296. He married Annabella, sister of Malise, earl of Strathearn (died 1293). 
Patrick Graham's son, David, who had fought with his father at Dunbar and was taken prisoner after the battle, succeeded. He continued to uphold the Balliol cause, and it was the killing of his patron, Sir John Comyn, by Robert Bruce, that explains his reluctance to espouse Bruce's cause and led to a period of English service. Following Bannockburn, however, Graham accepted the political situation and returned to serve Robert I, appending his seal to the declaration of Arbroath in 1320. In 1325 he exchanged lands in the earldom of Carrick with the king, for which he received lands including Old Montrose in the sheriffdom of Forfar. He died 'c'.1330, and was succeeded by his son, also David, who was one of those who submitted to Edward Balliol after the battle of Dupplin and Balliol's coronation at Scone in 1332. But Graham made his peace with David II, and in 1346 accompanied the king into England and was taken prisoner with him at Nevilles Cross on 17 October, but he had returned to Scotland by 1348, and was later appointed as one of the commissioners to negotiate David II's release. His continuing career in royal service is demonstrated by his frequent appearances as a witness in official records until his death 'c'.1376. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Patrick Graham, who in 1357 had been a hostage for the ransom of David II. Active as a diplomat in negotiations with England, and in financial administration, Graham was a staunch supporter of Robert Stewart, earl of Fife and later duke of Albany, from whom he received lands in the Lennox. It was on Albany's behalf that in 1399 Graham was appointed to the council established to advise, and restrain, the duke of Rothesay, the king's lieutenant. But he died in 1400, and was succeeded by his son William, born of his first marriage, to a woman named Matilda. His second wife, Euphemia Stewart, was the daughter of a half-brother of Robert II.

Sir William Graham (d. 1424) formed links with the Douglases. He received a grant of lands in Stirlingshire from Archibald, fourth earl of Douglas, while, following the forfeiture of George Dunbar, earl of March, in 1400, Douglas influence may have led to Graham's holding March's barony of Dundaff, as tenant-in-chief of the crown. He took part in the earl of Douglas's invasion of England in September 1402, and was captured at Homildon Hill, but ransomed soon after. He was also the principal vassal of Duncan, earl of Lennox, whereby he augmented Graham estates in the Lennox, acquiring the superiority of Mugdock, his chief residence and centre of administration, which he was to hold directly of the crown. This considerable landed influence, coupled with his support for Earl Duncan's grandson, the duke of Albany, earned him substantial patronage, above all his prestigious marriage to Mary Stewart, daughter of Robert III. This was a palpable demonstration of Graham's high favour, notwithstanding the fact that he was Mary's third husband. Sir William's brother,

Patrick Graham, second earl of Strathearn (d. 1413), also benefited from Albany patronage, through his marriage about 1406 to Euphemia Stewart, Albany's niece and the heir of David, earl of Strathearn (died 'c'.1389). As a result Patrick himself became earl of Strathearn, but on 10 August 1413 he was murdered near Crieff by John Drummond of Concraig, a close associate of Walter Stewart, earl of Atholl, who had ambitions to control Strathearn. He was succeeded as earl of Strathearn by his son, Malise Graham. 
From 1407 Sir William Graham appears on official documents as William, lord of Graham, a style which underlines his political status, as there was no territorial lordship of Graham. After Albany's death in 1420 he switched his support to Walter Stewart, earl of Atholl. Atholl had built up considerable support in Lennox, and it was on Graham's lands of Mugdock and Killearn that the Lennox men assembled in August 1423, to press their grievances just before the general council which resolved to negotiate the release of James I from English captivity. Not surprisingly, concern about the Albany Stewarts and their adherents exercised James I on his return to Scotland in 1424, Graham possession of the earldom of Strathearn being one bone of contention. Malise Graham was sent to England as a hostage for the payment of the king's ransom, fated to be the longest-serving hostage, not returning to Scotland until 1454, and James reclaimed the earldom of Strathearn for the crown, substituting for it the less valuable earldom of Menteith. Late in 1424 James I felt secure enough to move against the Albany Stewart faction. William Graham was arrested and held in Dunbar Castle, in the custody of George, earl of March, but he was dead by November 1424, having been predeceased by his son Alexander. His death dealt a severe blow to the men of Lennox, as William's younger brother, Sir Robert Graham, lacked the older man's experience, connections, and influence, notwithstanding the major role he was to play in the murder of James I in 1437. 
Sir William Graham was succeeded by his grandson,

Patrick Graham, first Lord Graham (d. 1466), who served as a hostage for James I's ransom from 1427 until 1432. His absence in England, and the lack of any noteworthy record of activity during the reign of James I, suggest a waning in the fortunes of the Grahams, but Patrick Graham's position recovered during the minority of James II, through the patronage of the Black Douglases, who exercised a considerable degree of control over the minority administration. The title lord of Graham, used by his grandfather William (except during the personal rule of James I), had been adopted by him by 1443; again, this was a designation of convenience rather than an officially conferred title; but in 1445 Graham was recognized as a lord of parliament, as Patrick, first Lord Graham. His status had been affected by James I's repossession of the earldom of Strathearn, in that his lands of Kincardine became a crown fief; now he took advantage of Douglas favour during the royal minority to obtain a new charter of infeftment which erected Kincardine into a barony. He pursued a career of royal service, appearing as one of the most frequent royal charter witnesses during the reign of James II, particularly after the Black Douglas crisis, when he was almost continuously at court, possibly to demonstrate his loyalty in spite of previous Douglas connections. In 1458 he had his lands in the Lennox erected into the barony of Mugdock. Several times an ambassador to England, he also held the keepership of Dumbarton Castle, and was sheriff of Perth in 1462 and 1464. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by his son, born of his marriage to Christian, daughter of Sir Robert Erskine.

William Graham, second Lord Graham (d. 1471), is recorded as sitting in parliament on 9 October 1466. On 23 November following he received a safe conduct from Edward IV to accompany his relative, Patrick Graham, bishop of St Andrews, on his journey through England to France and Flanders, although there is no evidence that he used it. He sat in parliament again in 1467 and 1469, but died in 1471. He had married Helen Douglas, daughter of William Douglas, earl of Angus (died 1437), and was succeeded by their son.

William Graham, first earl of Montrose (1462/3-1513), was a minor at the time of his father's death, his ward and marriage being granted by James III to Thomas, Lord Erskine. As third Lord Graham, William sat in parliament between 1479 and 1487, and he was a steadfast supporter of the king, appearing with him in Edinburgh at the end of May 1488, possibly going on to Sauchieburn with him in June. A pragmatic switch of allegiance saw Graham sitting in James IV's first parliament, on 6 October 1488, and he subsequently received grants of the lands of Aberuthven and Inchbrakie in Perthshire. On the occasion of James IV's marriage to Margaret Tudor in 1503, an earldom was created for Graham out of the Lindsay dukedom of Montrose, which had lapsed to the crown on the death of David Lindsay, and possibly in recognition of his hereditary charter for the lands of Old Montrose. This rewarded Graham for his loyalty and sought to counter the influence of the Lindsays, whose bitter feuding had destabilized Angus. Montrose was killed at Flodden in 1513, having married, first, Annabel Drummond, second, Janet, daughter of Sir Archibald Edmonston of Duntreath, and, third, Christian, widow of Patrick, Lord Haliburton. The subsequent earls of Montrose were the descendants of the first earl's first marriage.

Graham, Malise, third earl of Strathearn and first earl of Menteith (1406x13-1490), landowner, was the only son of Patrick Graham, second earl of Strathearn (d. 1413) ['see under 'Graham family], and Euphemia, daughter and heir of David Stewart, earl of Strathearn, fourth son of Robert II. The marriage of his parents was arranged by 1401 and took place about 1406. Graham was born between that date and his father's murder in 1413. At first Strathearn was administered by his mother, but by 1416 power over Graham and his lands had passed to Walter Stewart, earl of Atholl (died 1437), his great-uncle. Atholl remained his tutor for the next decade and gradually secured authority in Strathearn. In 1424 Graham was named as a hostage for the release of James I, though he did not go to England until arrangements were finally made in 1427. In September of that year he was deprived of Strathearn, which was given to Atholl, receiving in compensation from the king a truncated earldom of Menteith. But his custody of this was purely nominal, and within two months of the grant he was sent to England as a hostage for the king's ransom. 
The treatment of Graham by the king was probably resented by his Graham kinsmen, including Sir Robert Graham (a landowner in Strathearn), and by Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Douglas (died 1439), husband of his sister Euphemia. It was hardly the major issue claimed by some historians, however. Douglas had his own problems with James I, and Robert Graham continued to work closely with Atholl in Strathearn. By comparison with the royal attack on the Albany Stewarts, Malise's fate was insignificant. For the next quarter of a century he resided as a forgotten hostage at Pontefract Castle. His re-emergence came at the critical point in relations between James II and the Black Douglases in 1453. The Douglases and James Hamilton, second husband of Graham's sister, negotiated his release -- an act which has been alleged as having the intention of making the exile a rival royal claimant. As a descendant of Robert II's second and unquestionably legal marriage, historians have suggested that Graham could have had a right to the throne over the dubious legitimacy of James II. There is no evidence of this as the motive for Graham's release. Rather the Douglases probably sought to embarrass James II by drawing attention to his father's abandonment of the hostages. Graham certainly made no attempt to establish himself as a pretender. He appeared at parliament in 1455 to forfeit his Douglas redeemers, and for the next thirty-five years was the least active of the Scottish earls. He was married twice, first to Jane Rochford and then to Marion, whose surname is unknown. He died before May in 1490.

Gray, Andrew, first Lord Gray (b. c.1390, d. in or before 1470), administrator and landowner, was the son and heir of Sir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth in Roxburghshire (died before 17 July 1445) and his first wife, Janet, daughter of Sir Roger Mortimer of Fowlis in Angus; the union did much to enhance the wealth and status of the Grays. 
First recorded in 1424 as a hostage for the release of James I from captivity in England, Gray (whose father's lands were then valued at 600 merks annually) was exchanged on 9 November 1427 for Malcolm Fleming the younger of Cumbernauld, and thenceforward benefited from royal service. In 1436, probably as a knight, he was one of 1200 Scots who accompanied James I's daughter Margaret to France for her marriage to the dauphin, Louis, but it was probably as a supporter from 1444 of William, eighth earl of Douglas (died 1452) and his brothers during the minority of James II that his advancement was principally hastened. He had been created Lord Gray of Fowlis by 1 July 1445. In August 1445 Gray and Thomas Spens (died 1480), archdeacon of Moray, accompanied James II's sisters Eleanor and Joanna to France for their marriages; Gray went from there to the court of the duke of Brittany on behalf of James II, who was still a minor and dominated by a faction led by the Douglases and Livingstons. On 7 October 1449 Gray had a royal charter for lands at Littletoun in Angus, and in the same year he served as ambassador to England and conservator of an Anglo-Scottish truce, roles he repeated in 1451. From 3 January 1450 he was a regular royal council member and parliamentarian. 
If Gray had been a Douglas supporter, he traded this for the rewards of serving the crown once James II had asserted his independent authority in 1449-50. The contemporary Auchinleck chronicle names Gray and his eldest son and heir, Patrick, among the seven courtiers who dispatched the eighth earl of Douglas after James II stabbed him (despite a safe conduct) at Stirling Castle on 22 February 1452. Sir Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie's unsubstantiated sixteenth-century tale that Douglas had executed MacLellan, tutor of Bombie (nephew of Patrick, master of Gray), may have some basis in fact as a motivation for Gray's actions. By 12 April 1452 Andrew was master of the king's household and Patrick had received disputed Perthshire lands at Cluny -- reasons enough to betray Douglas, perhaps; the other assassins were similarly favoured by the crown. 
As one of James II's leading lay supporters in the political crisis following the murder, Gray was envoy to England in June 1452, and after 26 August that year received a royal licence allowing him to erect Huntly Castle in Longforgan in the carse of Gowrie. On 9 June 1455 he sat on the parliamentary assize which finally forfeited the Black Douglases. He served as march warden (1459) and lord auditor (1464), and on 5 March 1465 accompanied James III to Berwick to ratify a fifteen-year truce with England. 
Gray had died by 20 January 1470. He had married, by contract dated 31 August 1418, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Wemyss of Rires, Fife, who survived him; they had two sons and one daughter. Patrick, Gray's heir, married Margaret, daughter of Sir Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld (contract dated 7 February 1440), and then ('c'.1445) Anabella, daughter of Alexander, first Lord Forbes (died 1448). He and Anabella had three daughters and a son, Andrew Gray (d. 1514), who was served heir to his dead father in the lands and castle of Cluny on 5 November 1464 and succeeded his grandfather as second Lord Gray, probably as a minor. 
In looking to regain the local and court status of his grandfather, lost during his minority, Gray became a committed opponent of James III and of the king's favoured subject David Lindsay, fifth earl of Crawford (died 1495), Gray's rival in Angus. Gray consequently played a prominent part in the rebellions of 1482 and 1488. In August 1482, with Crawford, he surrendered the town of Berwick to the English army of Richard, duke of Gloucester, which had accompanied James III's exiled brother, Alexander Steward, duke of Albany, to Edinburgh, ostensibly to enable Albany to usurp the Scottish throne as Alexander IV. Gray is named in sixteenth-century histories as one of the nobles responsible for seizing James III at Lauder on 17 July 1482 and imprisoning him in Edinburgh Castle. By January 1483 Gray had joined Albany's supporters at Dunbar in attacking the newly liberated James III. On 11 February 1483 Gray, Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus (died 1514), and James Liddale of Halkerstoun, now in England, renounced their Scottish allegiance and became liegemen of Edward IV, promising to break the Franco-Scottish alliance and help Albany to depose James III. 
Gray, however, was forced to re-enter James III's peace later in 1483; at the same time Crawford was made master of the king's household, an office formerly held by the first Lord Gray. But in 1488 (with Crawford, created duke of Montrose in May) Gray joined those rebels supporting Prince James against the king. Pitscottie and George Buchanan, both writing in the following century, speculate respectively that either a 'lordis grayis servandis' or Gray's son Patrick was responsible for James III's death at Sauchieburn. 
As a member of James IV's royal council, Gray had on 29 October 1488 letters to grant remission to Crawford once he had given Gray the sheriffdom of Forfar. Gray was named by the rebels of 1489-90 as being among the 'parciale personis' of the post-Sauchieburn government, who were exploiting royal patronage, finances, and justice to the detriment of their local rivals. In June 1489 Gray was awarded the lands of Lundie in Angus, and the office of justice-general of the north, forfeited by Robert, second Lord Lyle (died 1497). He continued to receive royal favour after the political compromise of 1490, obtaining several grants of Forfar lands from James IV as well as the office of justice-general of the south before 24 May 1505. 
Gray and his first wife, Janet, daughter of William Keith, first Earl Marischal (died 1483), had one son and two daughters: Patrick, who married Janet, daughter of George Gordon, second earl of Huntly (died 1502) (and widow of Alexander, master of Crawford, whom she was accused of smothering), about 1493; Isobel, who married Alexander Stratoun of Lauriston; and Elizabeth, who married John, fourth Lord Glamis (1487), Alexander Gordon, third earl of Huntly (1511), and George Leslie, fourth earl of Rothes (1525). Gray married his second wife, Elizabeth, third daughter of John Stewart, first earl of Atholl, before 1483; they had four sons and two daughters. Gray and his third wife, Margaret Houston (widow of his nephew Robert, second Lord Lyle), whom he married after 1497, had no children. Gray died in February 1514 and was buried near his grandfather in the collegiate church of Fowlis Easter, founded by the latter about 1453.

Sir Walter Haliburton (c.1375-1446?), the eldest son of probably Sir John Haliburton ('fl'. 1378-1402) and his spouse, Margaret Cameron. Although Sir Walter had no known public career before his father's death, he was permitted to marry Isobel, daughter of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany (died 1420), and widow of Alexander Leslie, earl of Ross (died 1402), probably shortly after the latter's death. (The Walter Haliburton who 'c'.1403 married Mary, daughter of Archibald, third earl of Douglas (died 1400), and widow of David Stewart, duke of Rothesay (died 1402), seems to have been a different man.) Despite this apparently advantageous marriage Haliburton made only sporadic appearances at court in the next thirty-five years (perhaps becoming more frequent as time passed). He was present at the battle of Long Hermiston Moor (14 February 1406) at which Sir David Fleming, a guardian of Prince James, heir to the throne, was killed. The evidence does not make it clear if he was a companion of Fleming or of James Douglas of Balvenie, who ambushed him. 
A usually reliable contemporary chronicle states that Haliburton was knighted at the coronation of James I in May 1424, but he was a hostage in England for the ransom demanded for the king in 1424-5. It would seem significant that he is not styled as a knight in any other document until after the coronation of James II in March 1437. As Albany's son-in-law he was in fact unlikely to have found favour with James I, and advancement came only after the king's murder in 1437. He was created treasurer by June 1438, a post he held for about two years. This elevation reflects the power of a patron -- probably Archibald, fifth earl of Douglas (died 1439) -- and undoubtedly also the depletion of the Scottish nobility following the deaths or forfeitures of many nobles in the previous fourteen years. 
The Haliburton family held land in Edinburghshire, Berwickshire, Perthshire, and Angus, but the main estate became Dirleton in Haddingtonshire, where there was considerable building work in the fifteenth century on the very imposing castle (which may have caused the mortgaging of part of the estate). Sir Walter, whose income in 1424 was estimated at 800 merks, also founded Dirleton collegiate church. He died certainly after July 1444, and probably in late 1446. His spouse, Isobel, is thought to have been the mother of his four sons and one daughter, although he may have had at least one further son. One possible son of his,

She was the mother of at least four of Haliburton's six sons. All but one -- George, third lord ('c'.1435-1492) -- of the next four lords Haliburton were short-lived and the family went into eclipse, appearances at court being confined to attendance at parliament. They had little authority independent of their principal patron, the earl of Douglas, and after 1455 the Haliburtons mainly confined themselves to local affairs.

Hamilton family (per. 1295-1479), landowners and administrators, is of uncertain origins. A now lost account of the family, supposedly written 'c'.1450 (which in its reported form does not inspire much confidence), claims that the first Hamilton to arrive in Scotland was Sir Gilbert, the eldest son of the earl of Southampton, who fled England 'c'.1308 after being responsible for the death of one of the Despensers, favourites of Edward II. He was much favoured by Robert I on his arrival in Scotland, to the extent that he married Robert's sister's daughter, Isobel Randolph. Later accounts consider that the family's descent was from the earls of Leicester, but concur in the tale of the flight from England. A recent English origin for the family seems most likely.

Sir Walter fitz Gilbert (d. in or before 1346), the earliest undoubted ancestor of the Hamiltons, is uncertain, he first appears on 10 January 1295 as a witness to a charter granted by James, fifth steward of Scotland, in the company of other landholders of Renfrewshire. A close relation of Walter, John Fitzgilbert, also had links with the Stewarts, serving Walter, sixth steward of Scotland, as bailie of Bute; the Bannatyne or Bute mazer, an ornamental drinking bowl, is thought to have been made for John soon after Bannockburn. Walter's name (as Wauter fiz Gilbert de Hameldone) is found on the Ragman rolls, a list of those Scottish freeholders recorded as swearing fealty to King Edward I at Berwick on 28 August 1296. He remained loyal to Edward during the wars with Scotland, briefly holding land in Fife from him, and was captain of the garrison of Bothwell Castle, Lanarkshire, until the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. But when the earl of Hereford with a band of English cavalry sought shelter at Bothwell after the battle fitz Gilbert performed a volte-face, imprisoned them, and surrendered the castle and his erstwhile allies to a Scottish force. The ransom later demanded for Hereford included the return of King Robert's wife. In March 1315, as a reward for this, fitz Gilbert received from the king a grant of the lands of Machan in Lanarkshire, forfeited by John Comyn. Later he also had a grant of the barony of Cadzow (now in Hamilton, Lanarkshire), and in July 1323 various lands in Linlithgowshire. Further testimony to his continuing favour is shown by his temporary commission as a justiciary of Lanark in 1321 and by his being knighted by 1323. He may have fought at Halidon Hill (1333), but escaped from the disastrous Scottish defeat. Fitz Gilbert appears to have died by 1346. He married twice. His first spouse was Helen (surname unknown), while his second, whom he had married by March 1315, was Mary Gordon (died in or after 1323), perhaps the daughter of Sir Adam Gordon of Gordon. They had at least one and possibly two sons.

Sir David fitz Walter (d. 1375x8) was their elder (or perhaps only) son. He was present at the battle of Nevilles Cross (1346), where he was made prisoner. Because of his status he was entrusted to the archbishop of York, with orders that he was not to be delivered up without a mandate from Edward III. He was eventually liberated, apparently for a heavy ransom, and had been knighted by June 1361. In December 1368 he obtained a charter from King David II referring to a grant of the barony of Cadzow made to his father by Robert I, now confirmed with the addition of the lands of Eddlewood. As a baron he attended the parliaments of 27 March 1371 and 4 April 1373, when the succession to the crown was settled on John, earl of Carrick, and his successors. The name of fitz Walter's wife is not certain, though she may have been a daughter of an earl of Ross. He is known certainly to have had two sons, and may have had two others and a daughter. He was alive in November 1375, but had died by October 1378.

David Hamilton of Cadzow (d. 1381x8), fitz Walter's eldest son, was perhaps the first head of the family to employ the Hamilton surname. Little is recorded about him, and he died between October 1381 and November 1388. By October 1378 he had married Janet ('fl'. 1378-1422), daughter of Sir William Keith of Galston (who remarried after his death). They had a daughter and at least four sons, of whom

He was knighted by November 1388, when he married Jacoba ('fl'. 1388-1410), daughter of Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith; she survived him and married again. The couple had three sons. Hamilton engaged in raids into England, hence the orders given in 1396 (when he was imprisoned at Norwich for violating the Anglo-Scottish truce) and 1398 that he (and others) should be released from captivity in England. Indeed, it is likely that he was killed at the battle of Hamildon Hill on 14 September 1402.

He served as a hostage (valued at 500 marks) for the ransom demanded for James I after the king's return from England in 1424. He may have gone back to Scotland 'c'.1426, but as there is no further record of him it is also possible that he died while being held in the Tower of London. He was certainly dead by October 1436. He had married Janet ('b'. 'c'.1395, died after 1422), daughter of Sir Alexander Livingston of Callendar, by October 1422. She may have been his second wife, but no other is on record, and her death date is unknown. Hamilton had five sons and three daughters; it is not clear which spouse was their mother.

Hay family (per. c.1295-c.1460), nobility, originated in the seigneurie of La Haye-Hue, by Soulles, south of St Lo in Normandy. It seems certain that the Hays came to Scotland through their connection with Ranulf de Soules, an Anglo-Norman in the service of David I, since one of the earliest recorded Hays in Scotland, William de la Hay, was Soules's nephew. From being knights in the service of Soules, the family became established in central and north-east Scotland, eventually rising sufficiently to hold the important household office of constable of Scotland, formerly the possession of the Comyns. The Hay family had held the barony of Erroll in the sheriffdom of Perth, by knight service, since the early years of William the Lion's reign, but the foundations of their rise to national prominence were laid by

Sir Thomas Hay of Erroll (d. 1406) was the son of Sir David and his first wife, the daughter and heir of Sir John Keith of Innerpeffer. As constable of Scotland, Hay was one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the English for the release of David II in 1353, and was proposed as a hostage for the king's ransom in 1357. He does not appear to have served as such, possibly because of his official duties as constable. However, his primary loyalty was to the Stewarts rather than to the king, as is indicated by the fact that although he does not appear to have attended at court under David II, he was sufficiently in favour with the Stewarts to secure a royal bride, for he married Elizabeth, the third daughter of Robert II and his first wife, Elizabeth Mure. He was present at the coronation of Robert II at Scone on 26 March 1371, where, as constable, he received the oaths of homage and fealty given to the king. On 4 April 1373 he swore to the maintenance of the 'Act of Settlement' entailing the crown on Robert II's male heirs, and his lands of Slains were erected into a free barony by royal charter dated at Dundee on 5 January 1377. But thereafter he seldom appears in official records until his death in July 1406.

Sir William Hay of Erroll (d. 1436), who succeeded his father, had on 19 March 1393 obtained an undertaking from Robert III not to ratify or approve any alienations made by his father, Thomas, without either William's consent or that of the king's council, indicating some tension within the family. Hay was one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the English for the release of James I in 1423, and was knighted at the coronation of the king in 1424, his son Gilbert (died 1436) having been sent to England as a hostage for James I's ransom, serving thus until 1427. The king's reliance on Hay as one of his trusted northern councillors is indicated by his inclusion in James I's expedition to the north in 1428, and he followed the king's instructions to coerce a reluctant Coupar Angus Abbey, of which he was patron, into surrendering the church of Erroll near Perth, so that it might be added to the king's endowment of Perth Charterhouse. (In 1446 Hay's grandson, subsequently the first earl of Erroll, attempted to recover his rights in the church, claiming that the grant had been made under duress and through fear of the king.) In 1430 Hay, possibly because he held the office of constable rather than because he had any landed interest in the borders, was appointed one of the wardens of the marches. He was married to Margaret, daughter of Sir Patrick Gray, and he died in 1436, being succeeded by his grandson.

William Hay, first earl of Erroll (d. 1462), was the son of Gilbert Hay, who died in the same year as his father, and Alicia, daughter of Sir William Hay of Yester. In the June parliament of 1452 William Hay was raised from the peerage rank of lord of parliament, which he had held in official records at least since 1450, to the earldom of Erroll, resigning all his lands into the king's hands to be erected into the lordship of Erroll and regality of Slains, for which he received royal charters on 31 July 1452. Although the title derived from his estates, Hay's elevation, like that of William Keith, created Earl Marischal in 1458, followed from his hereditary office, reflecting the family's high status as constables of Scotland. It also contributed towards replenishing the then depleted ranks of the higher nobility with loyal supporters of the king, without requiring much expenditure of crown lands or revenue. James II may also have been moved by a desire to secure Hay's allegiance, undermining any ties of kinship the new earl may have had with the Black Douglases, to whom Hay was related through his marriage, before 17 March 1450, to Beatrix Douglas. She was the sister of the eighth earl of Douglas, whom James slew in 1452. The creation of the earldom of Erroll certainly survived the Douglas crisis and the king's act of revocation in 1455. Erroll is mentioned in a charter of 15 November 1461, but was dead by October 1462.

Hay, John, first Lord Hay of Yester (c.1450-1508), landowner, was the eldest son of Sir David Hay of Yester and Mary, daughter of George Douglas, first earl of Angus (died 1403), and Mary, sister of James I. The Hays of Yester were an important baronial family in Edinburghshire, Haddingtonshire, and Tweeddale and ancestors of the earls of Hay. On 12 July 1470 John received Olivercastle in Peeblesshire (inherited by the Hays through marriage to the heiress of Simon Fraser of Olivercastle, executed by Edward I in 1306) from his father, whom he had succeeded by 1 March 1479, inheriting Yester, with its castle, various Haddingtonshire lands, and the sheriffship of Peebles, as well as some lands in Lanarkshire and Perthshire. 
A regular attender of parliament in the 1480s, Hay became a lord of parliament on 29 January 1488: James III probably looked to Hay (whose first wife belonged to the family of Lindsay of the Byres, which remained loyal to the king in 1488) to act as a counter in Peeblesshire and Haddingtonshire to the rebellious Hepburns, Humes, and Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus (Hay's mother was an Angus Douglas). Loyal to James III in the civil war of 1488, Hay temporarily lost his family's sheriffship of Peebles and his Haddingtonshire barony of Locherworth: the former was held by the earl of Angus from 1488 to 1491 and the latter by Patrick Hepburn, earl of Bothwell, from 1488 to 20 September 1500. Between July 1501 and 27 January 1502, moreover, the lords of council decided that his (repeated) 'partial process' should again cost him his sheriffship; he was fined $10 for missing a justice ayre at Jedburgh in 1501. 
Hay married first Mary (died before 1468), daughter of John, first Lord Lindsay of the Byres (contract dated 1462); they had one son, Thomas, who predeceased him. His second marriage was to Elizabeth (died after February 1509) daughter of Sir George Cunningham of Belton (contract dated 17 December 1468). They had four children: John, who was granted the barony of Snaid in 1505 by James IV, and succeeded his father as second Lord Yester; George, ancestor of the Hays of Menzion; Margaret, who married William Borthwick, third Lord Borthwick ['see under 'Borthwick family]; and Isabel, who married Robert Lauder of Bass. Hay died in late September 1508, possessed of lands worth at least $115 annually: in 1479 -- with Locherworth -- they had been worth $175.

Herries, Herbert, first Lord Herries of Terregles (b. c.1460, d. in or after 1503), landowner, was the eldest son and heir of Sir David Herries of Terregles (died 1495) and Margaret, daughter of Sir Robert Crichton of Sanquhar. Some unspecified illness seems to have been hereditary in this important Dumfriesshire family. In 1478 Herries, along with his first wife, Mariot (daughter of John, first Lord Carlyle), and his great-uncle, George Herries of Terraughtie, replaced his father as curators of his grandfather, John Herries of Terregles (died 1483), who was 'incompos mentis'. By 1483 the same trio were curators for Herbert's father. On 1 June 1486 James III confirmed Herbert's resignation of Terregles, Hoddom in Annandale, and other Dumfriesshire lands to his son and heir, Andrew; this was done without stated reason, though if it was due to Herbert's illness, this did not prevent him from remarrying by 4 June 1493; his second wife was Mariot Cunningham. 
In the parliament of February 1490 Herbert, who had been knighted in May 1483, was styled Lord Herries of Terregles. His elevation was perhaps in recognition of his family's importance to the maintenance of royal authority, and of order, in south-west Scotland; or it may have been a means for the government, dominated by Hepburns and Humes, to be seen to be distributing patronage more evenly after the rebellion of 1489-90 in the Lennox, while at the same time undermining the interests of Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus (died 1514). However, by December 1494 Herries was under the curatorship of Sir Robert Crichton (after January 1488 Lord Crichton of Sanquhar), Lord Carlyle, and George Herries of Terraughtie. The second two disputed the gift of marriage of Herbert's heir, Andrew, and on 25 November 1495 Andrew resigned Terregles, Hoddom, with its castle, and various other lands in the south-west to the then chancellor, the earl of Angus, expecting a full regrant and marriage to Angus's daughter, Janet. But Andrew revoked this resignation on 3 December 1498 as Angus had regranted these lands to Janet alone. On 14 January 1502 Andrew became his father's sole curator. Herbert Herries was last recorded as alive in February-March 1503. He and Mariot Carlyle had four sons and one daughter.

William Keith, first Earl Marischal (b. after 1425, d. 1483), had succeeded his father by 20 July 1430, when he witnessed a charter as marischal. The genealogy of the fifteenth-century Keiths has suffered confusion in the past as a result of the measures which William Keith took to safeguard the descent of the family's lands. In 1442 he granted all his lands to his son Robert, but when Robert died in 1446, the lands reverted to William. The latter was created a lord of parliament, probably before 10 April 1450, and was styled William, Lord Keith, in charters granted by James II on 6 July 1451. He was one of the guarantors of the truce with England in 1457, and his elevation to an earldom, with a title -- that of Earl Marischal -- which derived from his hereditary judicial office rather than his estates, occurred between 20 March and 4 July 1458. This elevation, like that of the constable, William Hay, to the earldom of Erroll, gave increased status to a family with a convincing pedigree of loyal support for the crown, without this entailing any significant alienation of crown resources. Keith appears on a number of parliamentary sederunt lists during the reign of James III, but died in 1483. He had married Marjorie, daughter of Alexander Fraser.

William Keith, second Earl Marischal (d. 1526/7), is recorded as sitting in parliament, as master of Keith, on 18 March 1482, and he spoke for his father to the lords auditors on 10 December 1482. He was styled Earl Marischal following the death of his father in 1483, and was a loyal supporter of James III, aiding the king in raising an army in 1488. The Marischal was with James III at Aberdeen in April 1488, and was one of the six royal commissioners involved in drawing up the Aberdeen articles, proposals for a settlement between King James and his opponents, but the king's repudiation of them may have disappointed him sufficiently to keep him from accompanying James back south in May. He was one of the king's representatives chosen to treat with the rebels after the confrontation at Blackness, but following the death of James III at Sauchieburn, on 11 June 1488, he seems to have withdrawn temporarily from political involvement. 
The Earl Marischal was absent from the coronation of James IV at Scone on 24 June 1488, although he was in parliament on 6 October. His commitment to the new regime was, at best, lukewarm, and he was not elected to the lords of the articles, although he was permitted to sit with Bishop Elphinstone of Aberdeen among the lords auditors. Discontent with the government resulted early in 1489 in an uprising led by the earl of Lennox and Lord Lyle in the south of Scotland, and when George Gordon, master of Huntly, and Alexander, Lord Forbes, rebelled in the north, the Marischal joined forces with them. In September 1489 Keith and the master of Huntly swept south through Angus, causing great damage, but on 11 October the Marischal was on the losing side at the encounter at the field of the Moss, although he did not remain long in disgrace, as he was chosen to serve on the new privy council in the parliament held in February 1490. 
In April 1502 the Earl Marischal received one of the letters sent by James IV requesting support for King Hans of Denmark against a Swedish rising, and in 1504 he was made one of the commanders of the forces which took part in James IV's highland campaigns. On 15 October 1504 the Marischal entertained James IV at Dunnottar, and he attended the parliament held in Edinburgh in 1510. Following the battle of Flodden, the Earl Marischal was one of those given custody of the young King James V during the governorship of John Stewart, duke of Albany, when the latter was absent in France between 1517 and 1520. In recompense for substantial sums advanced to the treasury, Albany granted the Marischal the ward of the heiress of Inverugie; and on 24 July 1527, after he had come of age, James V confirmed the ward to the second earl's grandson. William Keith had married Elizabeth Gordon, third daughter of George Gordon, second earl of Huntly, on 11 January 1482, so linking two important north-eastern noble families. He died before 2 May 1527, and was succeeded by his grandson, another William.

Kennedy family (per. c.1350-1513), nobility, was important in the history of the Gaelic-speaking province of Carrick in south-west Scotland in the later middle ages, and also assumed national prominence in the mid-fifteenth century. The Kennedys, who were clearly of Gaelic origin, entered Carrick in the retinue of Duncan, earl of Carrick, in the late twelfth century.

Other branches of the family were to be found at Blairquhan, Knockdolian, Dalmorton, and Gyltre at this period. John further acquired the Carrick lands of Cassillis on the River Doon by marriage to or purchase from Marjorie Montgomery, and also the nearby estate of Dalrymple. There is evidence of building work at the castles of Dunure and Cassillis in the fourteenth century which may well be attributable to John's growing wealth and power; he also founded a chapel in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the parish of Maybole in Carrick. 
By 1372 John Kennedy had also acquired properties and offices which had belonged to the now extinct line of the earls of Carrick descended from Earl Duncan: armorial bearings, lands in Lennox, and the offices of bailie of Carrick and keeper of Loch Doon Castle as well as headship of the kindred ('ceann cinneil', 'kenkynnol') of Carrick. Possibly these acquisitions came about through his marriage to an otherwise unidentified Mary who may have been a female descendant of the Carricks. Moreover, John was succeeded by his son Gilbert, a name which may signal a connection with the Carricks inasmuch as it had also been the name of the father of Earl Duncan, progenitor of the Carrick family, and of many subsequent members of the family. On the other hand, John's acquisition of Carrick offices may simply have reflected his political dominance of the province, apparent for example in the submission to his 'captaincy' by the unidentified clan of Muntercasduf ('muintir quas Duf', 'the household of the servants of Duf') in the reign of David II.

Sir James Kennedy (d. 1408), the eldest son of the second rather than the first marriage, was during his father's lifetime designated as heir to the family's lands and titles, possibly following his marriage to Mary Stewart, a daughter of King Robert III. This marriage established cousinship with the royal house of Stewart which was to be important in the progress of Kennedy fortunes in the fifteenth century. The offspring of the marriage of Gilbert Kennedy and Marion Sandilands were probably later represented by the Kennedys of Coif, Leffnoll, and Carluke, members of which branches of the family maintained claims to the headship of the kindred and other properties until well on in the fifteenth century. Gilbert was still alive when James was killed on 8 November 1408, perhaps by disinherited members of his kindred -- in that year he made an indenture with the duke of Albany, the governor of Scotland, under which in return for the latter's consent to an entail of Kennedy lands, Gilbert became the duke's retainer. 
James Kennedy left three infant sons, and during their minority, control of the family patrimony seems to have passed into the hands of his four brothers, in particular Alexander of Ardstinchar, who is described as tutor of James's sons in one source. Alexander is said to have been murdered by his brothers, and Thomas of Kirkoswald and Bargany seems thereafter to have become the most powerful, holding the office of bailie of Carrick until at least 1438. The eldest of James Kennedy's three sons, John, was however designated as of Dunure and Cassillis in 1429, suggesting that he had then succeeded to those parts of the family estates at least. But in 1431 John was arrested for treason and subsequently went into exile, possibly as a result of his connections with Archibald, fifth earl of Douglas, who was arrested at the same time. The precise nature of John's treason remains mysterious, as does his ultimate fate.

Gilbert Kennedy, first Lord Kennedy (b. c.1407, d. in or after 1479), and James Kennedy (c.1408-1465), the latter having already commenced an ecclesiastical career which would lead to the bishopric of St Andrews in 1440 and significant political influence in the 1450s and 1460s. In the mid-1440s, perhaps following John's death in exile, Gilbert Kennedy began to play a much more prominent role in both Carrick and national affairs and, with royal support possibly aimed at establishing a counter to Douglas power in the south-west, established himself as the head of his family with all its lands and offices, including the bailie-ship of Carrick, keepership of Loch Doon Castle, and the kenkynnol. In order to do this he had to overcome opposition from within his own kindred. The keepership of Loch Doon Castle was resigned to him by John Kennedy of Coif in 1450; he received a quitclaim of the kenkynnol and his Kirkintilloch lands from Gibboun (that is, Gilbert) Kennedy of Leffnoll in 1454; and in 1465 he entered upon elaborate agreements for the settlement of feud with the Kennedys of Bargany, involving intermarriage between the two families. The family muniments contain many other indentures, bonds of manrent, and letters of retinue between Gilbert and other Kennedys, indicative of the manoeuvres which the former had to undergo to establish and make good his claim to be head of the kindred. 
This gradual consolidation of his position in Carrick may have enabled Gilbert Kennedy to commission further building work at Dunure and Cassillis. He also embarked upon lengthy litigation, only concluded in 1466, to recover from Robert, Lord Fleming, the lands of Kirkintilloch in the Fleming barony of Lenzie. In 1458 he was made a lord of parliament; a mark of continued royal favour, not to mention Bishop Kennedy's influence, it also underlines his new prominence in the south-west following the forfeiture of the Douglases in 1455. Significantly, Gilbert Kennedy was also justiciar of the forfeited Douglas estates in Galloway. Following the death of King James II in 1460, the influence of Gilbert's brother Bishop James of St Andrews reached its zenith as guardian of the minor King James III in 1463-5. Gilbert succeeded to this role upon his brother's death in 1465 (it doubtless helped that as the son of James I's sister he was the young king's closest adult relative), and was also a justiciar and keeper of Stirling Castle in this period. But after the coup by Robert, Lord Boyd, in 1466, he fell from power and was briefly imprisoned in Stirling despite having entered a complex series of bonds of manrent, friendship, and mutual support with Boyd and others in the Boyd camp earlier that year. He continued, however, to attend parliament until 1479, about which time he died. He was twice married: his first wife was Katherine Maxwell, daughter of Herbert Maxwell, first Lord Maxwell; his second was Isabel Ogilvie, daughter of Walter Ogilvie of Lintrathen and widow of Patrick, Lord Glamis. Walter Kennedy, the poet, was his son by his first wife.

David Kennedy (d. 1513), was made first earl of Cassillis in 1509, perhaps in consequence of his second marriage, which was to Margaret Boyd, daughter of Thomas Boyd, earl of Arran ['see under 'Boyd family]. His first wife had been Agnes Borthwick, daughter of William, Lord Borthwick. Their eldest son was Gilbert Kennedy, second earl of Cassillis. David, earl of Cassillis, was killed at the battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. 
The Kennedys were a Gaelic kindred who from the thirteenth century onwards extended their activities well beyond, but without losing sight of, the Gaelic milieu whence they came. On the evidence of William Dunbar's poem of 'c'.1500, 'The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy' (Walter, the Kennedy in question, was a younger son of Gilbert, first Lord Kennedy), the family still spoke Gaelic as well as Scots, and the Gaelic form of lordship exercised by them, the kenkynnol, was clearly still worth contending over in the fifteenth century; indeed, the claim of 'calp' (the chief's entitlement to a gift from those under his protection and maintenance) to which it gave rise was seen as so oppressive as to require parliamentary abolition in 1490. At the same time the leaders of the Kennedy kindred had no difficulty in seeking and exercising power in the non-Gaelic worlds of national and ecclesiastical politics, and do not appear to have seen any contradiction between their Gaelic and their Scottish personas. Members of the family married royalty, became guardians of minor kings, were appointed as bishops and lords of parliament, exercised offices under the crown, and resolved their disputes by litigation, arbitration, and bonds of manrent. The family history is an excellent illustration of the interplay between local and national interests, and the varying traditions, which together constituted the late medieval Scottish noble polity.

The resignation may not have been entirely voluntary, or some aspects of the new arrangement may have displeased Walter and Margaret, for in August 1388 they repeated their resignation of the earldom in Duncan's favour, but this time reserving their 'liferent' rights in the Lennox. Duncan may have achieved an uncontested supremacy in the Lennox only after the deaths of his parents, in both cases before 17 February 1392. 
Duncan's career as eighth earl was dominated by his increasingly close links to the family of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany. By the early 1390s he had no legitimate male heirs (though he had four illegitimate sons), but did have three legitimate daughters, probably born of his marriage to Helen Campbell, daughter of the Campbell lord of Lochawe, for which he obtained papal approval in 1373. On 17 February 1392 Duncan entered into a contract for the marriage of his eldest daughter, Isabel, to Robert Stewart's eldest son, Murdoch. By the terms of the contract Isabel and Murdoch and their successors were recognized as heirs to the earldom should Duncan fail to produce any legitimate male heirs before his death. On 8 November 1392 Robert III gave his consent to the entailing of Lennox in favour of Murdoch Stewart and his heirs. The entailing arrangement (which ruled out the possibility of the earldom being partitioned between Duncan's daughters) tied Lennox to one of the most powerful figures in the kingdom, for Albany was first guardian of the kingdom for the incapacitated Robert III from 1402 until the latter's death in 1406, and then, as a result of the capture of the heir to the throne, Prince James, by the English in the same year, governor of Scotland. When the duke died in 1420, Duncan's son-in-law Murdoch succeeded his father as both duke of Albany and governor. 
Earl Duncan's close connection to the Albany Stewart family eventually proved his undoing, as he was caught up in the bitter political dispute between the Albanys and King James I after the latter was released from English captivity in 1424. At the forefront of resistance to James was Duncan's grandson Walter Stewart, who had built a personal following in the earldom of Lennox and had been opposed to the entire idea of negotiating James's release. Walter, whose increasingly rebellious courses did much to undermine his father's position, was arrested on the king's orders in May 1424, and before January 1425 James had also detained Earl Duncan and imprisoned him in Edinburgh Castle. In March 1425 Duncan's daughter Isabel and his son-in-law Murdoch were also taken into custody, and it became clear that the duke and his kinsmen were to face trial in a parliament called for May 1425. The king's actions provoked a rebellion in the Lennox led by another of Duncan's grandsons, James Stewart, who attacked the royal burgh and castle of Dumbarton on 3 May, although with limited success. On 25 May Duncan, Duke Murdoch, and Murdoch's son Alexander were tried in parliament at Stirling, convicted, and summarily executed; Walter Stewart had suffered the same fate on the previous day. Earl Duncan was reputed to be over eighty years of age at the time of his execution. According to a later chronicler all four men were buried in the Dominican friary in Stirling. 
Earl Duncan's daughter Isabel recovered control of the earldom of Lennox after James I's death in 1437. She died about 1458, without legitimate heirs, and the comital title was eventually claimed by the descendants of Duncan's second daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, John Stewart of Darnley. Their grandson, another John Stewart, was acknowledged as earl in 1488.

Leslie, George, first earl of Rothes (c.1417?-1489/90), magnate, was the only son of Norman Leslie of Fythkill in Fife, who died about February 1440, and Christian, daughter of Sir John Seton of Seton. He inherited a considerable collection of lands, mainly on the east coast: Leslie in the Garioch; Rothienorman, Fowlis Mowat, and Cushnie in the adjoining earldom of Mar; Rothes in Moray; Fythkill and Tacis in Fife; and Cairny in Perthshire. Consequently he was among the first Scottish nobles elevated to the new rank of lord of parliament in the minority of James II, becoming first Lord Leslie of Leven probably in 1445 -- a creation, if not a date, confirmed by two extant charters issued by him with this style in 1448. He further increased his status through important marriage alliances and by providing local support to the adult James II in the king's dealings in north-east Scotland. 
On 5 November 1457 Leslie served on the Aberdeen assize of error which found against the claim of Thomas, Lord Erskine (of whom Leslie held lands), to the earldom of Mar, so confirming it as a crown possession. Leslie was rewarded by James II on 20 or 21 March 1458 with the earldom of Rothes (based on his castle barony in Moray), the barony of Ballinbreich in Fife, confirmation of all his other lands, and the erection of Leslie-Green into a burgh of barony. James II clearly intended Rothes to be a royalist counterweight in north-east Scotland to the earls of Orkney, Crawford, and Huntly. But the remainder of Rothes's career seems to have been low-key and troubled. In May 1459 his annulment of his second marriage on the grounds of relationship within the fourth degree was disputed by William Sinclair, third earl of Orkney (died 1480), whose son and daughter were by then married to Rothes's children from this marriage. Arbitration by the chapter of St Andrews Cathedral allowed the annulment, granted on 22 May 1459, and legitimation of the offspring. The latter was presumably Sinclair's concern, along with some $500 Scots which by 'certain contracts' of marriage Rothes had been bound to pay Sinclair in 1459. (Sinclair's successor would litigate against the second earl of Rothes for this in 1498-9.) That on 15 October 1464 the privy council declared Rothes not guilty of forging the signet of the late James II on a royal acquittance of debt of 200 merks may also point to financial problems. 
Rothes attended parliament often between 1467 and 1481 and on 8 February 1476 received the barony of Balmain in Kincardineshire after the forfeiture of John MacDonald, earl of Ross and lord of the Isles. But he was never a regular royal charter witness and seems to have withdrawn from national affairs into neutrality just before the first of the civil wars of James III's reign, in 1482. At some stage, though, there was an apparent rift within the Leslie family (perhaps dating back to Rothes's marriage annulment in 1459): on 10 February 1487 James III ordered Rothes -- who suffered 'personal apprehension' by the sheriff of Aberdeen -- on pain of immediate ward in Dumbarton Castle to provide for his grandson and heir, George, master of Rothes ['see below'], who was to continue in the king's retinue. 
The earl's subsequent fortunes are uncertain, but he died between 31 August 1489 and 24 May 1490 and was probably buried in Leslie churchyard, Fife. He and his first wife, Margaret, daughter of John Lundin of that ilk, whom he married 'c'.1435, had a daughter, Margaret. About 1440 he married Christian, widow of Alexander Leslie, earl of Ross, and daughter of Walter Haliburton of Dirleton and Isabel Stewart (daughter of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany). They had three children: Andrew, who died before January 1478, having married Elizabeth, daughter of William Sinclair of Orkney; Elizabeth, who married William Hay, third earl of Erroll, another north-east magnate; and Christian, who married William Sinclair, later Lord Sinclair. Rothes's third wife was Elizabeth Campbell. 


Rothes, though, was as much a crook as a victim. On 23 April 1498 he was fined $100 Scots for non-compearence at Cupar justiciar's court to answer for the murder of one George Leslie, or Dunlop, and he subsequently became a fugitive, failing to compear in court to face the charges four times between 1500 and 1509. On each occasion he was fined $1000 Scots, declared an outlaw, and had his goods forfeited to the king. This was despite crown attempts to rehabilitate Rothes: on 2 March 1506 James IV granted to William Leslie, brother and heir of George, the right to counsel the earl not to waste 'so noble and famous a house', so disinheriting his rightful heir. But Rothes's intractability left him open to royal fiscal opportunism. In March 1508 Rothes lost his Fife lands for alienating some of them without royal licence and was fined $2210 Scots for eighty-five years' non-entry to Balmain (which the first earl had been given only in 1476, unaware of the previous tenant's debts). The king granted out many of Rothes's other lands and collected their feudal revenues anew, until the Leslies recovered them after the battle of Flodden. 
The second earl of Rothes died between 24 February and 31 March 1513. Some time between 1484 and 1488 he married Jane or Janet (died before 10 July 1494), fifth daughter of the fifth earl of Angus. They had no children, and Rothes was succeeded by his brother William.

George Leslie, second earl of Rothes (d. 1513), second surviving son of the first earl of Rothes's only son, Andrew, was infefted on 25 May 1490 in his grandfather's lands, with the addition of Balmullo in Fife. But his career was racked by legal actions over feudal casualties and criminal activity, and he was pursued by the crown and several individuals (including his wife, the bishop of Moray, and the earl of Orkney and Caithness). Probably as a result of his support for James III in 1487-8, Rothes was pursued before the lords of council on 22 October 1490 for arrears of non-entry (payment due to the crown by a tenant-in-chief when lands are first acquired) for Ballinbreich, for which he was to pay over $800 Scots and more in kind to Patrick Hepburn, earl of Bothwell (died 1508), then guardian of James IV; three days later he was pursued by his grandfather's widow for two years' wrongful occupation of Ballinbreich, which she claimed to own. Rothes failed to compear, and his lands were seized and distrained to yield the sum required. Significantly, about this time Rothes's father-in-law, Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus (died 1514), was gradually being displaced from his political and territorial offices.

Leslie, Sir Walter, lord of Ross (d. 1382), soldier and royal retainer, was a younger son of Sir Andrew Leslie, lord of Leslie (died 1320x24), and Mary Abernethy (died in or before 1355), daughter and heir of Sir Alexander Abernethy of that ilk. He had two elder brothers, Andrew and Norman, and two younger half-brothers, Alexander and William Lindsay, from his mother's marriage to her second husband, Sir David Lindsay of Crawford. Walter seems to have started his career as an esquire in the household of his kinsman Thomas Stewart, earl of Angus, but by the end of the 1350s, having been knighted between 23 October 1357 and 24 October 1358, he had joined his brother Norman in the service of David II. Like many of David II's favoured retainers, Walter and Norman Leslie were active crusaders, obtaining numerous safe conducts for expeditions to the Holy Land and the Baltic crusades. Walter's exploits were commemorated in the Saracen's head crest adorning his coat of arms in the late fourteenth-century 'Armorial de Gelres' and may well have provided the inspiration for a now lost vernacular work, 'The Tail of Syr Valtir the Bald Leslye'. In 1363-5 Walter and Norman, possibly at the instigation of David II, seem to have been involved in the crusade organized by Pierre I of Cyprus which ended in the sack of Alexandria (where Norman Leslie may have been killed). 
On Walter Leslie's return to Scotland he was the beneficiary of considerable royal favour. Before 13 September 1366 David II forced through the marriage of his favourite to Euphemia Ross ['see under 'Ross family], daughter and heir of William, earl of Ross, despite the earl's opposition to the match. Then in February 1370 he granted the royal thanages of Kincardine, Aberluthnott, Fettercairn, and Aberchirder to Walter and Euphemia and their heirs. In October of the same year, moreover, the king intimidated Ross into a formal entailing of his earldom in favour of Walter and Euphemia. Overall, David II apparently viewed Leslie as a dependable and forceful agent for the interests and authority of the crown in the north of the kingdom. The death of his royal patron in February 1371, and the fact that David's successor, Robert II, was the brother-in-law of the earl of Ross, brought about a decline in Leslie's political influence. A fairly regular witness to David's later charters, he no longer witnessed royal charters after 1371. Despite this, King Robert allowed him to retain all the crown lands granted to him in the 1360s and failed to take any action over a complaint delivered to him in June 1371 by the earl of Ross, detailing King David's unfair treatment of the earl and his brother and the resultant resignation of land and title in favour of Leslie. 
After Ross's death on 9 February 1372 Leslie adopted the courtesy title lord of Ross as the husband of the earl's daughter and heir, although his influence within the earldom may well have been limited by the opposition of local lords and kindreds, particularly the male line descended from the earl's brother Hugh. In addition, the earldom of Ross was one of the areas made subject to the authority of Robert II's son Alexander Stewart, lord of Badenoch, when he was appointed the king's lieutenant in the north in October 1372. Leslie seems to have continued his career as a crusader and mercenary after 1372 and obtained a succession of English safe conducts for travel overseas. He died at Perth on 27 February 1382; his widow, Euphemia, married Alexander Stewart, but this liaison ended in a politically inspired divorce in 1392. 
Leslie and his wife had at least two children, Alexander and Mary. Alexander Leslie became earl of Ross and married Isabel Stewart, daughter of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany, brother of Robert III. Alexander died on 8 May 1402, leaving a daughter and heir, Euphemia, who in 1415 resigned her rights in the earldom in favour of Albany's son John Stewart. Euphemia Leslie seems to have died unmarried and childless after her resignation. Mary Leslie married Donald, lord of the Isles, and after her brother's death Donald of the Isles claimed the earldom of Ross in right of his wife. The son of Donald and Mary, Alexander, eventually had his claim to Ross recognized by the crown, and the earldom remained with the lords of the Isles until it was forfeited to James III in 1478.

Mackenzie, Dame Helen Carruthers (1859-1945), educationist and public health campaigner, was born on 13 April 1859 at Mortlach, Banffshire, the daughter of William Spence, merchant tailor and provost of Dufftown, and his wife, Mary McDonell. She was educated at the local village school, where she became a pupil teacher, and completed teacher training at the Church of Scotland Training College, Aberdeen. Her early career was as a teacher at various schools in Aberdeen. 
On 12 February 1892 Helen Spence married Dr (William) Leslie Mackenzie (1862-1935), shortly to become the first medical inspector of schools at the Local Government Board for Scotland. Their subsequent careers were dedicated to the improvement of the physical condition of Scottish schoolchildren and jointly they were influential in the early twentieth-century movement to improve the health of children. In 1902, on behalf of the 'royal commission (Scotland) on physical training', they conducted a pioneering investigation into the physical state of Edinburgh schoolchildren. The study, organized by Helen, involved the examination of 600 children drawn from four schools deliberately chosen to enable comparison between children from middle-class and working-class areas of the city. Helen was present while her husband checked each child and she also wrote the findings. The study demonstrated that children from the poorer areas were smaller, lighter, and less healthy than children from wealthier homes. The children from Canongate School in the heart of the Old Town were especially unhealthy, with many suffering from significant medical defects; and their conclusion was that the principal factors responsible were bad housing and inadequate and unsatisfactory diets. On the basis of their study they projected that almost 30 per cent of children in Edinburgh were severely malnourished. They called for the systematic medical inspection of school children and the training of teachers in matters of health and hygiene. 
In 1904 Helen Mackenzie, giving evidence before the interdepartmental committee on physical deterioration, argued that part of the problem was the ignorance of many women in respect of nutrition, hygiene, and the care of infants. She demanded changes to the education system to enable instruction for girls in these areas. The subsequent 'Education (Scotland) Act' (1908) required school boards to organize the medical inspection of schoolchildren, to provide meal services for poor children, and to provide domestic instruction for girls. The Mackenzies also co-operated in promoting the establishment of a number of special schools for mentally handicapped children, and campaigned for the effective treatment of children suffering minor ailments such as scabies and ringworm. 
A member of the school board for Edinburgh and of the departmental committee on industrial schools, Helen Mackenzie also campaigned for an extension of day and evening continuation classes for young women. She was an original member of the East of Scotland Provincial Committee for the Training of Teachers and a governor of the Royal Institution for Deaf and Dumb Children, and she became a member of the council of the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science. Her association with the college (subsequently Queen Margaret College) extended over thirty years and she chaired the council in 1943-5. 
Helen Mackenzie was also interested in social work and particularly in the problems of female factory workers. She was secretary of the industrial section of the National Union of Women Workers and also of the Edinburgh branch of the Industrial Law Committee. Before the First World War, she lectured on this subject in the Edinburgh College and during the war assisted on a training course for welfare supervisors appointed by firms employing female labour. After the war she continued to lecture at the University of Edinburgh. 
Helen Mackenzie was also active in relation to mental health, female health, and rural district nursing. She was a governor of what became the Royal Scottish National Hospital for the permanent care of mentally handicapped people, and was at different times a member of the health services commission and the Mental Welfare Association. A close friend of Dr Elsie Inglis, she assisted in obtaining better maternity hospital facilities in Edinburgh. She also joined her husband in the promotion of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service which was based on peripatetic district nurses. This latter initiative achieved worldwide recognition, and similar organizations were established elsewhere, notably the Frontier Medical Service in Kentucky. 
Helen Mackenzie was a gifted public speaker, her speeches being 'marked by directness and candour, and spiced with a characteristic humour that gripped attention' ('The Scotsman', 26 Sept 1945). She acquired the title Lady Mackenzie when her husband was knighted in 1919 (though she was universally referred to as Lady Leslie Mackenzie). She was appointed DBE in 1933 and received an LLD from the University of Edinburgh in 1937. She was also a fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland. For many years an active member of the Woman Citizens' Association, she tended to stress the widening opportunities open to women and also their duties as citizens. 
The Mackenzies had no children, but they were devoted to one another, and it was a heavy blow for Lady Leslie Mackenzie when her husband died in 1935. She died at 14 Belgrave Place, Edinburgh, on 25 September 1945, and was cremated on 28 September at Warriston crematorium. The principal of the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science wrote of 'her courage' and of 'her vigorous common sense, her shrewdness, her trenchant comments, her energy, her humour, her sincerity' ('ECDS Magazine', 7).

Leuchars, Patrick (d. in or after 1383), administrator and bishop of Brechin, probably came of a Fife family. He would have entered the Augustinian priory of St Andrews before taking the parsonage of Tyninghame, whose patronage belonged to the bishop of St Andrews, in 1344. He had exchanged it for or also had Tannadice when he was elected to the see of Brechin after 3 May 1351. This election, possibly engineered by Queen Joan at a time when David II's return from captivity in England was possible, was quashed by the pope, who provided Leuchars on 17 November 1351; he was consecrated within a month, presumably at Avignon. After the king's brief visit to Scotland in 1351-2, Leuchars is found as chancellor in March and December 1353. Although he had lost office by 12 February 1354, he was present at a council on 1 April 1354, held to discuss the king's ransom. Royal authority crumbled under the ineffectual regency of Robert Stewart in 1354-7, but the impending return of the king saw a chancellor, Leuchars, appointed by 26 September 1357. He continued to hold office during the subsequent years of heavy taxation and political wrangling and, while it is uncertain what his duties were in chancery, the two acts of revocation of title increased the business of that office significantly. He sat regularly at the exchequer until January 1369, and was twice an ambassador to England in 1360-62. The king made Edinburgh a 'de facto' capital, but travel was still required and may have become increasingly difficult for Leuchars. He is last found as chancellor on 4 March 1370; his successor occurs a month later. 
Leuchars was the last member of a religious order to hold the office of chancellor. Clearly a strong supporter of David II during his years of captivity, he lost office during the regency of Robert Stewart and was rewarded by David II's support after 1357. He was not prominent under Robert II, but was present at the parliament of 1373. Ten years later, early in June 1383, he resigned his see at Avignon on account of age, receiving a pension of 100 merks from its revenues. The date of his death is unknown, and he may not have returned to Scotland.

Adams, William Grylls (1836-1915), scientist and university teacher, was born on 10 February 1836 at Lidcot, Laneast, Cornwall, the youngest son of the four sons and three daughters of Thomas Adams (1788-1859), small estate owner and farmer, and his wife, Tabitha Knill Grylls (1796-1866). The eldest son, John Couch Adams (1819-1892), was an astronomer and the discoverer of the planet Neptune. Adams was educated at a private school in Birkenhead and then entered St John's College, Cambridge, to study mathematics in 1855, graduating twelfth wrangler in 1859. He received the ScD degree in 1889. He was a fellow of St John's College from 1865 to 1869 and it was at Cambridge that he attended the experimental science lectures of George Stokes. 
In 1859 Adams was appointed vice-principal of Peterborough Training College. In the following year he moved to Marlborough College as mathematics master, where he remained until 1863 when he was appointed lecturer in natural philosophy at King's College, London, under James Clerk Maxwell. In 1865 Maxwell moved to Cambridge and Adams, who was said to be a better disciplinarian than Maxwell, replaced the latter as professor of natural philosophy, a post he held until his retirement in 1905. In 1864-5 he also taught at Highgate School. On 24 August 1869 he married Mary Dingle, daughter of Richard Dingle, a farmer, at Lewannick in Cornwall. 
While at King's College Adams was in the forefront of the development of science education. Many of the students at King's would enter manufacturing or engineering. With this in mind, Adams introduced a substantial practical element into the physics course with a strong emphasis upon measurement and the application of mechanics to practical engineering situations. Eventually his practical regime was extended to all branches of physics taught there. He was also successful in improving laboratory accommodation at the college and this helped to bring in money partly via the Whitworth scholarship scheme. While in London he attended John Tyndall's lectures at the Royal Institution and he was a member of a committee intended to increase college autonomy over teaching and examining. 
Adams undertook a number of educational roles outside King's College. He was an examiner in physics for the Department of Science and Art from 1879 until 1892 and for the universities of London and Cambridge. He played an active role in the formation of the Physical Society in 1874 and was its president from 1878 until 1880. In 1880 he was president of Section A of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and gave an address to the association's annual meeting outlining recent developments in physics. He was a member of its council in 1878-83. In 1884 Adams was president of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians (later to become the Institution of Electrical Engineers). He gave a presidential address in which he outlined some measurements made on the efficiency of dynamos used at an electrical exhibition at the Crystal Palace in 1882. This was a period of very rapid growth in the technology of electrical power generation and transmission and Adams was at the vanguard of this new technology. 
Adams had a variety of research interests of which one was magnetism. He studied the change in resistance produced by magnetization in iron and steel (1875). He compared magnetograph curves recorded at the observatories of Kew, Stonyhurst, Lisbon, Coimbra, Vienna, and St Petersburg (1880), and examined magnetic disturbances produced simultaneously at a number of locations (1893). He studied the polarization of light (1871), and in the late 1870s developed new forms of the polariscope, an instrument for studying the polarization of light. His particular instrument was used for determining the optical axes of biaxial crystals. In addition he studied the action of light on selenium (1875, 1877) and on selenium and tellurium (1876). Adams also determined lines of flow curves and equipotential surfaces in both two- and three-dimensional objects. This was the subject of his Bakerian lecture to the Royal Society in 1875. He had been elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1872 and was a member of the Kew observatory committee of the society as well as being on the board of visitors of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. His interest in astronomy took him to Sicily in 1871 to study eclipses. He was a much travelled man and in his earlier years he had been a proficient mountaineer and a member of an alpine mountaineering club. 
Adams had a great interest in lighthouse illumination and in 1885 he conducted work for Trinity House on a comparison of oil and electric lights for this purpose. In 1883 he gave a series of public lectures (the Cantor lectures) on electrical lighting. He edited two sets of volumes of the scientific papers of his brother John in 1896 and 1901. Those who knew Adams spoke of him as a very approachable colleague and teacher, and a man of great geniality. He retired from King's College, London, in 1905. A year later he went to live at Heathfield in Broadstone, Dorset, where he died on 10 April 1915. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter.

Lindsay family of Barnweill, Crawford, and Glenesk (per. c.1250-c.1400), nobility, took their name from Lindsey, Lincolnshire. They arrived in Scotland early in the twelfth century, as tenants of the future King David's honour of Huntingdon, and established a territorial base in Haddingtonshire where they held Byres, Luffness, and Ballencrief, as well as Barnweill in Ayrshire and the large barony of Crawford in Lanarkshire. Three main lines developed in the thirteenth century, but the two senior ones finished in heiresses who married into families which took the English side in the wars of independence. What became the main Scottish line descended from Sir David Lindsay of the Byres, who enjoyed a distinguished career in the mid-thirteenth century, during which he was a regent in 1255 and chamberlain the following year, and who died on crusade in Egypt in 1279.

Sir David Lindsay (d. in or before 1357), normally styled 'of Crawford', Sir Alexander's eldest son, had earlier been captured by the English with his brothers Alexander and Reginald, and he remained in prison until late in 1314, when he was probably exchanged for an Englishman taken at Bannockburn. Already a knight by that date, he was a witness to several important documents, notably the declaration of Arbroath in 1320, the truce with England of 1323, and the treaty of Edinburgh of 17 March 1328. Lindsay obtained various grants of land in Annandale from Robert I, and is recorded as keeper of Berwick in 1329. After the renewal of Anglo-Scottish hostilities, he was forfeited by Edward III in 1337 of his lands of Byres and of tenements at Chamberlain-Newton in Roxburghshire. He was never close to David II, but rather was an associate of Robert the Steward, his likely kinsman, who as guardian of Scotland appointed him constable of Edinburgh Castle in 1346, after the king's capture at Nevilles Cross. Lindsay was, however, granted several safe conducts to visit England to negotiate for David's release. 
About 1324 David Lindsay married Mary Abernethy (died 1355), daughter and coheir (with her sister Margaret, countess of Angus) of Alexander Abernethy, and widow of Andrew Leslie. This important marriage was the foundation of later Lindsay influence north of Forth, eventually raising the family from the ranks of the middling baronage into the peerage. David Lindsay had four sons, of whom David, the eldest, was killed at Nevilles Cross. In 1327 Lindsay gave land in Lanarkshire to Newbattle Abbey for the souls of himself and his wife, and he also established a mass for his wife at Lindores Abbey in Fife, where she was buried. Lindsay himself was dead by 13 October 1357, when his son James is referred to as lord of Crawford.

Sir James Lindsay of Crawford (d. 1358), David's second son, inherited only his father's possessions, raising the possibility that he was the son of an earlier marriage. He maintained his family's links with the stewards, in 1346 marrying Egidia Stuart, the daughter of Walter the Steward and half-sister to the future Robert II. He attended the king's parliament of September 1357, and later that year was appointed ambassador to England. He died in the following year. It seems clear that he was not the James Lindsay executed in 1358 for killing Roger Kirkpatrick near Dumfries. His estates went to his son without further ado, and the fact that on 1 October 1358 David II confirmed the grant of the Byres which James Lindsay had earlier made to his brother Alexander would also appear to clear James of suspicion.

Debus, Heinrich (1824-1915), chemist, was born at Wolfshagen, Hesse, on 13 July 1824, the son of Valentine Debus, a dyer. His mother died when he was two, and although his father then married her sister, Debus was brought up by grandparents in Kassel. There he attended the Burgerschule and, later, the polytechnic school, where he was inspired by the chemistry teaching of Robert Bunsen (1811-1899). Bunsen moved to the University of Marburg in 1839, and when he was eighteen Debus joined him there, becoming his personal assistant and completing a PhD on madder in 1848. He was the first chemistry student at Marburg to present his thesis in German instead of Latin. 
At Marburg, Debus became acquainted with Bunsen's English pupils Edward Frankland, John Tyndall, and Thomas Archer Hirst, with whom he enjoyed lifelong friendships. Through Frankland's influence Debus emigrated to England in 1851 to teach chemistry at Queenwood College in Hampshire. In 1867 he went to teach at Clifton College, Bristol. In 1870 he joined his English friends in London as lecturer in chemistry at Guy's Hospital medical school, and when Hirst became director of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1873 he invited Debus to become professor of chemistry there. Debus continued in both positions until his retirement in 1888, when he joined his only sister in Kassel. He returned to London each year to see his dwindling number of surviving friends. 
Debus joined the Chemical Society in 1859 and was its vice-president in 1871-4. He was elected FRS in 1861 and sat on the Royal Society's council in 1870-72 and 1881-3. He was president of the chemical section of the British Association at Exeter in 1869 and was intermittently the University of London's chief examiner in chemistry from 1864 until retirement. Debus was recognized as an excellent teacher, despite a German accent which he never lost. He was a confirmed bachelor with a quiet dignity and good humour, and was well known for the eccentricity of his dress. He was an ardent clubman and loved to meet and entertain his friends at the Saville or the Athenaeum. 
Apart from some experimental work on the law of mass action in 1853, and of the explosion of gunpowder in 1888, all Debus's research was in organic chemistry. In 1856, while at Queenwood, he ingeniously oxidized ethyl alcohol to form the new compounds glyoxal and glyoxylic acid. Over a number of years he made a thorough investigation of the thionic acids and their derivatives. In retirement Debus published (in German) a critical historical study of Avogadro's hypothesis (1894) and some attractive reminiscences of Robert Bunsen (1901). 
Debus was one of the last of the Victorian scientific hierarchy that controlled London science. He died at his home, 4 Schlagenweg, Kassel, on 9 December 1915, having remained physically and mentally alert to the end.

Lindsay family, earls of Crawford (per. c.1380-1495), nobility, became important in the history of north-east Scotland, and especially Angus, in the fourteenth century. 
Originating in the twelfth century, the family rose through service to the crown and a series of profitable marriages. Two other branches had died out, but the Lindsays of Crawford, Lanarkshire, still flourished in the mid-fourteenth century.

Alexander Lindsay, second earl of Crawford (d. 1438/9), who was much less prominent in public life than his father. In part this was the result of two spells in captivity, in 1406-7 as a hostage for the fourth earl of Douglas and in 1424-7 as a hostage for James I. In 1407 Henry IV of England granted him a safe conduct for travel to Amiens, an early indication of a long-standing family devotion to St John the Baptist, whose head was venerated there. He received a safe conduct for travel to England in 1416 and again in 1421, when he was one of the commissioners appointed to negotiate the release of James I from English captivity. In December of the same year he arranged a male entail for the Crawford lands. In 1424 he met James at Durham with hostages for the king's release. Although Crawford is said to have been knighted at James's coronation on 21 May 1424, on 25 March he had taken oath as a hostage for the king, his own ransom set at 1000 merks. During this second period of captivity he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, York, and finally Pontefract. Two years after his release in 1427 he endowed a chaplaincy in the parish church of Dundee with an annual grant of 12 merks. He received another safe conduct in January 1430, to meet English envoys at Hawdenstank, and in January 1431 he was again nominated as an ambassador to England. In 1438 he was appointed a commissioner of the Anglo-Scottish truce. Little else is known of Crawford, but he was said to have been active in the capture of James I's assassins. He and his wife Marjory, whose identity is unrecorded, had five sons and two daughters. When the second earl died, between 31 March 1438 and 8 September 1439, he was succeeded by his eldest son, David.

David Lindsay, third earl of Crawford (d. 1446), had been knighted by 17 September 1425 and witnessed a royal charter as earl on 1 February 1440. During the minority of James II he was associated politically with the Douglas family and he was among those who ravaged the lands of James Kennedy, bishop of St Andrews, in 1445. As a result he was excommunicated; according to a later source, this did not bother him greatly. He died at Finavon Castle on 17 January 1446, having been mortally wounded while attempting to prevent a battle at Arbroath between Lindsay kinsmen and the Ogilvy family, to which his wife, Marjory, belonged. Friction between the two families had arisen after the earl's son Alexander was replaced as justiciar of Arbroath Abbey by Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity. Countess Marjory, the daughter of Alexander Ogilvy of Auchterhouse, outlived her husband and endowed a mass on his behalf in the Franciscan church at Dundee. Later chroniclers stated that she smothered her wounded cousin Alexander Ogilvy as revenge for the death of her husband. He had died excommunicate and was not buried until his erstwhile foe Bishop Kennedy lifted the sentence. The couple had two sons, of whom the elder, Alexander, succeeded as fourth earl. The younger, Walter of the Aird and Beaufort, Inverness-shire, possessed estates at Edzell and Kynblethmont in Angus. They also had at least one daughter, Johanna, who married Sir Alexander Seton of Tullibody.

Lindsay family of the Byres (per. 1367-1526), landowners, were members of the extended Lindsay family which had first settled in Scotland in the twelfth century and whose estates included Byres in Haddingtonshire no later than 1241. The Lindsays were prominent in the entourage of David II, and on 17 January 1367 Sir William Lindsay, the youngest son of David Lindsay of Crawford ['see under 'Lindsay family of Barnweill, Crawford, and Glenesk (per. c.1250-c.1400)], received from the king a grant entailing upon himself and his male heirs the land of the Byres, which had been resigned for the purpose by William's elder brother, Sir Alexander Lindsay of Glenesk ['see under 'Lindsay family of Barnweill, Crawford, and Glenesk (per. c.1250-c.1400)]. Sir William married Christiana, daughter of Sir William Mure of Abercorn, and thereby obtained the barony of Abercorn in Linlithgowshire. He became a retainer of the earl of Douglas after the death of David II, but may have returned to the king's affinity by the time of his own death, before 1 July 1393.

He received a pension from Robert III in 1394 in recognition of his services to the crown, and in 1413 he founded a chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity in St Andrews Cathedral.

John Lindsay, first Lord Lindsay of the Byres (d. 1482), received a safe conduct to go to James I at Durham in 1423, and he was one of the original hostages sent to England in 1424 as pledges for the payment of the king's ransom. He returned to Scotland in the first exchange of hostages the following year, but his subsequent career is obscure until he appears once more in active royal service by January 1440, serving the king from his Lothian base which, as it included the barony of Abercorn, would have connected him with the Black Douglases who held the castle of Abercorn. He witnessed a Douglas indenture on 26 August 1447, but, in the crisis between the king and the Black Douglases in the 1450s, he stood with James II at the crucial time just after the killing of the earl of Douglas on 22 February 1452, witnessing charters granted by the king at Lochmaben and Jedburgh on 2 March, and he remained with him throughout that year's summer campaign, acting thereafter as a regular witness to royal charters. 
The exact date at which John Lindsay was created a lord of parliament is uncertain. He appears in a list, appended to Walter Bower's 'Scotichronicon', of men said to hold Scottish peerages by 1445. However, his title in the witness lists in the register of the great seal changes from John Lindsay of Byres on 2 March 1452, to John, Lord Lindsay of Byres, on 12 May 1452, indicating that official royal sanction was given at that time, specifically, it would seem, for support during the crisis with the Black Douglases. It may have been diplomatic services connected with the downfall of the Douglases that led to Lindsay travelling abroad, for, according to the exchequer accounts, he was in Flanders between 13 September 1455 and 7 July 1456. In 1457 he was appointed justiciar north of Forth, becoming a lord of session on 6 March 1458, and was appointed to hear petitions in parliament in 1466 and from 1468 to 1479. He married a daughter of Robert Stewart of Lorne and died on 6 February 1482, being succeeded by his son.

David Lindsay, second Lord Lindsay of the Byres (d. 1490), was a staunch supporter of James III. He was present with the king in Edinburgh in May 1488, and is alleged to have brought 1000 horse and 3000 infantry to the king's assistance at Sauchieburn, and to have presented James III with the large grey horse on which the king fled from the battlefield. However, beyond the fact that Lindsay was at the battle, the details are exaggerations by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, a descendant of David Lindsay's youngest brother, Patrick. David Lindsay married Janet, daughter of Walter Ramsay of Pitcruvie, but died childless in 1490. He was consequently succeeded by his brother John, third Lord Lindsay of the Byres, who was infeft as heir on 25 January 1492. John married Marion, daughter of Sir William Baillie of Lamington, but he also died childless, between 29 September and 5 November 1497, being succeeded by his younger brother.

Patrick Lindsay, fourth Lord Lindsay of the Byres (d. 1526), was styled Patrick Lindsay of Kirkforthar before succeeding to his brother's title and estates. The story of his appearing as advocate in defence of his brother David when the latter was tried for treason after Sauchieburn, causing him to cry out in pain by standing on his sore foot, appears to be another of Pitscottie's embellishments of his ancestors' exploits. On 28 October 1497 Patrick Lindsay received a charter confirming him in the lands and barony of Byres, in addition to a precept infefting him in the barony of Abercorn. He survived Flodden (where he is said to have urged James IV not to fight in person), and on 1 December 1513 was one of the four lords appointed to advise the queen, while in July 1525 he received the office of sheriff of Fife. He married Isabella, daughter of Henry Pitcairn of that ilk, and died in 1526, his burial taking place at St Andrews. He was succeeded in quick succession by his son and grandson, both named John.

James Livingston, first Lord Livingston (c.1400-1467), courtier and administrator, who may never have been knighted, was first brought to prominence at court by his father. After the fall of the family in 1449 he was imprisoned in Holyrood, only to escape and associate himself with his son-in-law, the lord of the Isles, in attacking royal castles in the north in 1451. His reward was the keepership of the nominally royal castles of Inverness and Urquhart, Inverness-shire. The Livingstons nevertheless received a general remission of rancour from the crown in August 1452, James II being now engaged in his struggle with the Douglases. James's rehabilitation was marked by his reappointment as chamberlain by March 1454; while he continued in office until his death, it seems that before the 1460s he entrusted the conduct of chamberlain ayres to deputes because he was constantly at court. He was sheriff of Stirlingshire by mid-1455 and master of the king's household from at the latest October 1455, both posts held until the end of 1460.

Lyon, Sir John, lord of Glamis (d. 1382), administrator and landowner, is of obscure origins. Chroniclers writing early in the sixteenth century deliberately emphasized his supposed lowly origins and claimed that he had originally been called John Myll and had received the surname Lyon from Robert II as an indication of, and reward for, his service to that monarch. An origin in the north-east of the kingdom, perhaps Angus, may be indicated by his steady accumulation of territorial interests in this area. He emerges into the light of historical record on 9 July 1368, when he had a grant of lands in the lordship of the Garioch from David II. It seems likely that Lyon had already entered royal service by the date of this grant. In April 1369 King David gave him a lifetime right to receive 10 merks from every justice ayre north of the Forth. In the same year Lyon was paid for his expenses in undertaking a diplomatic mission to London, where he was identified as the keeper of the king's privy seal. In January 1370 he was acting as an auditor of exchequer and by February of the following year he was serving as King David's secretary, an office which probably also included the keepership of the privy seal. Quite clearly, he was a highly literate and well-educated layman. 
After the death of his royal patron on 22 February 1371 Lyon retained an important role in the administration of the new king, Robert II. He was confirmed as keeper of the privy seal by 3 May 1371 and continued in that office until 1377. Similarly, the flow of direct royal patronage to him was unaffected by the change in regime. One of the most significant honours occurred in March 1372, when he was granted the royal thanage of Glamis by King Robert in free barony. Thereafter John was occasionally styled lord of Glamis. He was also the beneficiary of grants from a number of other noblemen, probably a reflection of his ability and his influence in royal government. 
Lyon's steady progression through the royal administration became a meteoric social and political rise during 1377. By 2 October 1377 he had married Johanna Stewart, daughter of Robert II and widow of Sir John Keith, son of Sir William Keith, the marischal, who had died shortly before 27 December 1375. The couple received the royal thanage of Tannadice through the marriage settlement. Perhaps as part of his elevation to the status of a royal son-in-law, Lyon was knighted, on a date between 27 June 1376 and 2 October 1377. Finally, on 20 October 1377, he was appointed chamberlain (the chief royal financial officer) in succession to Walter Biggar (died 1376) and John Mercer, who had acted as a temporary collector and receiver of royal revenues in the immediate aftermath of Biggar's death. Lyon's domination of key royal posts was further extended before February 1380 to include the sheriffdom of Edinburgh with custody of the castle, offices for which he was given a fee specially augmented by his royal father-in-law. 
Lyon's rapid rise to a privileged and influential position at the heart of royal government and his personal territorial aggrandizement seem to have aroused considerable resentment. The circumstances of his marriage to the king's daughter, in particular, may have given cause for concern. Certainly, on 10 May 1378 Robert II was required to issue a remission to his 'beloved son' John Lyon and his daughter for their clandestine marriage, a concession ratified by Johanna's brothers John, earl of Carrick (the future Robert III), Robert, earl of Fife, and Alexander, lord of Badenoch. The idea that Lyon's marriage to Johanna and his subsequent social elevation were not universally popular resurfaced in later tales surrounding his death. 
Lyon was assassinated on 4 November 1382 by another prominent royal councillor, Sir James Lindsay, lord of Crawford, whose family had experienced a number of political setbacks during 1382, and who may well have held the influential Lyon responsible for the direction of royal policy. Lyon's role in the creation of Robert II's son Alexander as earl of Buchan in 1382, a title to which Lindsay also had a claim, may have been crucial, although the steady territorial build-up of Lyon's interests in Angus, an area dominated by Crawford's Lindsay kinsmen, perhaps also played a part. Sixteenth-century chroniclers suggest that Lindsay's assassination of Lyon arose from Sir John's ingratitude to Lindsay after the latter, a close friend, had secured a place for Lyon in Robert II's government and protected the chamberlain from the king's wrath after Lyon had been seduced by Princess Johanna. 
Lyon is said to have been buried in Scone Abbey, a traditional site for the coronation and burial of Scottish monarchs; if this is correct, it gives some indication of the regard in which he was held by his royal father-in-law. After his death his widow went on to marry, between 20 November 1384 and 24 May 1385, Sir James Sandilands of Calder. The last reference to her occurs in 1404, when she was styled lady of Glamis. She is reputed to have been buried at Scone. Lyon and Johanna had one son, also John, whose son Patrick Lyon was created Lord Glamis in 1445.

Lyon, Patrick, first Lord Glamis (c.1400-1460), courtier, was the son of Sir John Lyon of Glamis ('c'.1377- 'c'.1435), son of Sir John Lyon (d. 1382), whose marriage in 1376 to Princess Joanna Stewart, daughter of Robert II, was probably the making of his family. The younger Sir John appears infrequently on record, but is stated to have married his first cousin once removed Elizabeth Graham, younger daughter of Euphemia, countess palatine of Strathearn, and Sir Patrick Graham of Dundaff and Kincardine; as her parents are considered to have married 'c'.1406, however, this is unlikely, unless it was a second marriage. Patrick Lyon, the eldest of Sir John's three sons, was a hostage for the ransom demanded for James I and remained in England between 1424 and 1427. He was knighted by 1440 and in 1445, being among the richest barons in the land, assumed one of the new peerage styles, which (after some typical early variants) was settled as Patrick, Lord Glamis. Following the collapse in the autumn of 1449 of the Livingston faction which had so dominated court politics since especially the mid-1440s, Glamis rose to prominence. From late 1449 he regularly witnessed crown charters, indicating that he was a fixed member of the king's daily council. His arrival at court was sealed by the marriage in early 1450 of his son and heir, Alexander, to Agnes, daughter of William, Lord Crichton, who was effectively now the power behind the throne. His royalist stance was probably influenced by an old feud between the Lyons and the Lindsays, earls of Crawford, the leading allies of the Douglases and the dominant family in Angus -- James Lindsay of Crawford had murdered Patrick Lyon's grandfather. 
Glamis was master of the king's household from at the latest April 1450 until the end of 1451 and again from late 1454 to the middle of 1455. In the mid-1450s the king began to rely on his loyalty to assist in the exploitation of the crown's interests in the north. He acted as commissioner when crown lands were leased and was appointed keeper of the castles of Kildrummy and Kindrochit, both in Aberdeenshire, and Balvenie, Banffshire, for which he received fees. The family's main estates were in Angus, but Lord Glamis also possessed land in Stirlingshire, Perthshire, Aberdeenshire, Berwickshire, and Fife. He ceased to witness crown charters at the end of 1458, perhaps because of his activities in the north. 
Glamis married Isabel ('c'.1410-1485), daughter of Sir Walter Ogilvy of Lintrathen, about 1428; they had four sons and one daughter. He died on 21 March 1460 and was buried in Glamis kirk. His widow then married Gilbert, first Lord Kennedy (died 'c'.1479). She is credited with finishing the building of the old castle at Glamis, as well as two stone bridges in the area and the aisle of the kirk where her first husband lay, and where she herself was buried after her death on 12 January 1485.

MacDonald family (per. c.1300-c.1500), magnates, ruled a semi-independent lordship or kingdom in the west coast and islands of Scotland, with the title 'ri Innse Gall' ('king of the Hebrides') or 'dominus insularum' ('lord of the Isles'). The titles appear to have been interchangeable, depending on which language was used. As late as 1549 a writer could refer to the 'lord of the Isles ore as the heighland men calls him king of the Isles' ('Monro's Description', 92). 
Descended from Somerled, king of the Isles and lord of Argyll (died 1164), the MacDonalds ruled over the varied and scattered series of communities stretching at the height of their power from the Butt of Lewis to the Mull of Kintyre, and linked by an intricate web of sea lanes through which their galleys could move widely in peace and in war. Their mainland territories were held from the king of Scots, and the islands (until they were ceded to Scotland under the treaty of Perth in 1266) from the king of Norway. The family separated into three great divisions -- the MacDonalds based in Islay, the MacDougalls of Lorn, and the MacRuairis, whose lands of Garmoran by the fourteenth century, at least, extended from Moidart to Barra and the Uists. Overlordship passed by turns among the three kindreds, but the MacDougalls, by taking the Balliol side in the wars of independence owing to a Comyn relationship, lost in both land and influence, while the others supported Robert I and prospered.

Angus MacDonald (d. c.1490), rebelled against his father, and was supported by leaders of clan Donald, but after a sea battle at Bloody Bay off Mull they were reconciled. John still failed to control his people, and was finally forfeited in 1493, after a further rebellion led by his nephew Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh. The former lord of the Isles died as a pensioner of the royal court while the king was at Dundee in 1503, survived by his wife and a daughter, Elizabeth. 
Angus MacDonald, who had been recognized as his heir in 1476 and was using the style 'master of the Isles' in 1485, died before his father, allegedly murdered by an Irish harper at Inverness in 1490. Having married a daughter of the first earl of Argyll, Angus left a son, Donald Dubh MacDonald, who spent many years in prison, but during brief spells of freedom attempted to rally support for a revival of the island lordship until his death in Ireland in 1545. His efforts were doomed to failure, and with the ending of this hope there expired any prospect of a permanent and independent centre of Gaelic power and culture surviving on the 'Celtic fringe' of the Scottish realm. 
The lords of the Isles were unlike the other magnates of late medieval Scotland. The feudal elements introduced by the MacDonalds had some features that could combine easily with the Gaelic concept of a kin-based society, but embodied others that were hostile to it. A major difference lay in succession practices, with primogeniture replacing the former pattern by which the headship of the kindred alternated among the leaders of the three divisions of the descendants of Somerled. The lords of the Isles adopted the feudal practice, but after 1493 there was a revival of the old system, leading to much confusion and bloodshed. On the other hand, landholding was readily translatable into feudal terms, with galleys being required in place of knight service. The church and the law were supported, and the lords had a council to advise them, making it plausible to say in retrospect that 'in their time there was great peace and wealth in the Isles through the ministration of justice' ('Monro's Description', 57). Compared with the period of anarchy that followed the forfeiture, this was a time when the arts could flourish; the sculptured stones and crosses scattered widely around the west highlands and islands, and the bardic verse composed in the same period, notably by a number of generations of the MacMhuirich family and others whose work appears in the 'Book of the Dean of Lismore', alike survive as a reminder of what was looked back upon as a golden age.

MacDonald, Sir John, of Dunyvaig and the Glens (d. 1499), clan chief, was the son of Donald MacDonald (died 1476/1481) and his wife, Siobhan O'Donnell, and the great-grandson of John MacDonald, first lord of the Isles (died 'c'.1387), and his second wife, Margaret Stewart. His epithet refers to Dunyvaig on Islay and the Glens of Antrim in Ulster. His grandfather Iain Mor, who married the heiress of Bisset of the Glens, was founder of the southern branch of clan Donald based on Kintyre. John was associated with his father in the treaty of Westminster-Ardtornish with Edward IV of England (1462) and appears as 'ri Innse Gall' ('king of the Isles') in Irish annals in 1499, having been called heir to John, fourth and last lord of the Isles, during his son Angus's rebellion in 1484. After the forfeiture of the lordship in 1493 MacDonald of Dunyvaig and Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh submitted to James IV and were knighted. The chronology of events at this point is not clear. According to the usually accurate annals of Ulster, Alexander was slain on Oronsay on 14 October 1494 by John Cattanach, Sir John's son, but a seventeenth-century source states that John MacIan of Ardnamurchan was the killer and was rewarded. (While the charter he received in June 1494 was a confirmation of lands already held by him, it was specifically granted in return for his obedience and good service.) 
King James came to the west in July 1494 to take control of the castles of Tarbert and Dunaverty in Kintyre, and it was probably this that caused Sir John MacDonald to revolt. He captured Dunaverty and is said to have hanged the governor within sight of the king's fleet. MacDonald and his sons were summoned for treason; they fled to Islay and were taken by MacIan at Finlaggan at an unknown date. In July 1499 they were hanged at Edinburgh. The executions may have been intended to instil a fear of royal justice in the men of the Isles, and also to ensure that the MacDonalds of Dunyvaig did not become a focus for future opposition to the crown and its agents. MacDonald married a sister of Colin Campbell, first earl of Argyll; his grandson Alexander MacDonald succeeded as MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens, carried on the family in Ulster, and was an ancestor of the earls of Antrim.

MacDougall, John, lord of Argyll (d. 1316), magnate, was the son of Alexander MacDougall, lord of Argyll (died 1310), with whose career his own is largely intertwined, the grandson of Ewen MacDougall, lord of Argyll and king in the Hebrides, and a descendant of Somerled (died 1164), king of the Hebrides and 'regulus' of Argyll and Kintyre. John's mother, it would appear, was a member of the powerful Comyn family, probably a daughter of John Comyn, lord of Badenoch (died 1277). Although later historians have almost invariably styled him John of Lorne and he is better known to generations of Scots as such, contemporary accounts style him John of Argyll ('de Ergadia'). There seems to be no contemporary authority for the byname Bacach ('the Lame'), now often attached to him. This may have arisen through confusion with a cousin and namesake. 
MacDougall first appears on record in 1291 when he swore fealty to Edward I. He followed his father, Alexander, in supporting the Balliol party, with whom the Comyns were closely connected. By tradition it was John who was responsible for the death of Cailin Mor, chief of the Campbells, in a skirmish at the String of Lorne about 1296. Like Alexander, John became a committed supporter of Edward I, who expressed his trust in him in a letter written in 1304. In 1305 Alexander was named a member of the advisory council of John of Brittany (died 1334), Edward I's lieutenant in Scotland. John MacDougall's cousin, the former guardian John Comyn of Badenoch, was slain by Robert Bruce in the church of the Greyfriars in Dumfries in 1306. Later that year MacDougall defeated Robert, now king of Scots, and dispersed his followers at Dalrigh in Argyll, all but bringing to a premature end both his career as king and his life. According to Barbour, MacDougall compared Robert's near miraculous escape to that of Goll MacMorna from Finn MacCumhail. It was on this occasion that a dying MacDougall is said to have wrested from the fugitive king the brooch of Lorne. 
In 1307 Edward II appointed MacDougall sheriff of Argyll and Inchegall (the Hebrides). In 1308, however, John wrote to Edward explaining that his position was becoming increasingly desperate and seeking assistance against the advancing forces of Robert I. No help was forthcoming, and later that year Robert defeated MacDougall by Ben Cruachan ('the battle of the Pass of Brander') and took the MacDougall headquarters of Dunstaffnage. John fled to England to be joined there later by his now elderly father, who had temporarily entered King Robert's peace. (Barbour's statement that John was captured by Robert and sent to Dumbarton and then to Lochleven, where he died in captivity, is without foundation.) Both John and Alexander attended Edward II's council at Westminster in 1310. In 1311 and 1314 John (named as Monsire Jehan Dargail) was appointed admiral and captain of an English fleet, and in 1315 he recovered the Isle of Man for England. He was granted a pension by Edward II in 1316 and died in September that year at Ospring in Kent on pilgrimage to Canterbury, having appointed as his executor another displaced Scot, Dungal MacDowall of Galloway. 
The name of MacDougall's wife is not known. His sons Ewen and Alan were members of the household of Edward II of England, the former when Edward was still prince of Wales. Gaelic genealogical tradition gives John two further sons, Somhairle and Alexander Og. He had at least two daughters: Mary, who married John Stirling of Rathoran, and an unnamed daughter married to Patrick Graham. MacDougall's reputation has suffered on account of his opposition to Robert I, yet it is impossible not to discern in the accounts of Barbour in the fourteenth century and Blind Hary in the fifteenth, relayed again in Sir Walter Scott's 'Tales of a Grandfather' (1828-30), more than a little grudging respect. 
John's son Ewen appears to have returned briefly to Scotland in the 1330s in the following of Edward Balliol, but it was John's grandson and namesake, by his son Alan, who re-established the MacDougalls in Argyll, though the circumstances remain obscure. This

John MacDougall, lord of Lorne (d. in or after 1371), is on record in 1338. Known traditionally as John Gallda ('the Foreigner') and usually styled John of Lorne, he styled himself lord of Argyll in an agreement concerning lands in dispute that he entered into with his remote cousin John MacDonald, chief of his name and lord of the Isles. He married Jonet Isaac, daughter of Thomas Isaac and Matilda Bruce, daughter of Robert I and full sister of David II. MacDougall renewed the family's foothold in Argyll in a modest way, but it never regained the power and status which it had enjoyed before the wars of independence. John seems to have died in or after 1371, leaving two daughters, Isabel and Jonet, married respectively to Sir John Stewart of Innermeath and his brother Sir Robert Stewart of Durrisdeer. The lordship of Lorne passed to John and Isabel and their descendants. MacDougall also appears to have left a son, Alan, perhaps from an uncanonical union. The later chiefs of MacDougall descend from this Alan, rather than from a brother of Alexander of Argyll, named Duncan, as is usually claimed.

MacRuairi, Ranald, of Garmoran (d. 1346), chief of clan Ruairi, was the illegitimate son of Ruairi MacRuairi (styled Ruairi of the Isles in contemporary documents) and a woman whose identity is unknown. Ranald's father was probably the MacRuairi ri Innse Gall (king of the Isles) who was noted in the annals of Ulster as dying alongside Edward Bruce, Robert I's brother, at the battle of Dundalk on 14 October 1318. Ranald's accession to the lordship of Garmoran, which embraced Moidart, Arisaig, Morar, and Knoydart on the mainland, along with the islands of Rum, Eigg, Barra, the Uists, and St Kilda, may have been contested after his father's death in 1318. Ruairi had received formal title to the lands which made up the lordship of Garmoran only after the resignation of the heir to these estates, his legitimate half-sister, Christina, some time in the reign of Robert I ('r'. 1306-29). After Ruairi's death Christina made a further resignation of her rights in Garmoran, this time in favour of one Arthur Campbell. Despite Christina's grant and his own canonical illegitimacy, Ranald was undoubtedly accepted as the chief of clan Ruairi and the dominant lord in Garmoran after his father's death. 
Ranald MacRuairi's earliest appearance in record sources dates from 1337, when, as Ranald, son of Ruairi of the Isles (Latinized as Reginald, son of Roderick of the Isles), he was noted as supporting attempts to obtain a papal dispensation for his sister Amy to marry John MacDonald, first lord of the Isles. At this point Ranald and his new brother-in-law were probably backing the claims of Edward Balliol to the Scottish throne against those of David II, the son and heir of Robert I. However, both men had been reconciled to David II by 12 June 1343, on which date Ranald received a general confirmation of his Garmoran lands from the king. Shortly before the royal grant, in July 1342, William, earl of Ross, gave over the west coast lands of Kintail to Ranald. The political and military expansion of the clan Ruairi into Kintail can probably be dated to the period after the death of William's father, Earl Hugh, at the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, when William was either a minor or, as some sources suggest, in exile outside the kingdom. In either case the 1342 grant in Ranald's favour seems to have been forced from a reluctant Earl William. That the relationship between the two men was far from cordial is confirmed by Ranald's assassination in Elcho Priory by adherents of Earl William during a muster of the Scottish host at Perth in October 1346. 
Ranald MacRuairi seems to have had at least one brother, Hugh, who had a grant of the thanage of Glen Tilt in the period 1342-6. After Ranald's death control of Garmoran passed to his sister's husband, John MacDonald, lord of the Isles. MacDonald continued to exercise lordship over Garmoran despite the end of his marriage to Amy MacRuairi, either through her death or through a divorce which in 1350 allowed John to marry Margaret Stewart, daughter of Robert the Steward (the future Robert II). On 9 March 1372 MacDonald received a grant of Garmoran from Robert II. In January 1373 the king confirmed John's grant of the Garmoran lands to Ranald, the eldest son of his marriage to Amy MacRuairi and the nephew of Ranald MacRuairi (after whom he was named). 
From the sons of Amy and John descended the Clanranald and the Glengarry MacDonalds, who continued to dominate the island and mainland territories associated with the lordship of Garmoran. Fifteenth-century Gaelic genealogies suggest that Ranald MacRuairi had at least one illegitimate son; his descendants acted as the leaders of a kindred reduced to political and military dependence on the new MacDonald lords of Garmoran. That the MacRuairis remained a significant force within Garmoran is suggested by the appearance of an Alexander MacRuairi of Garmoran, who was arrested and executed on the orders of James I in 1428 and who was described by the chronicler Walter Bower as the chief of 1000 men.

Margaret (d. in or after 1374), queen of Scots, consort of David II, was the daughter of Sir Malcolm Drummond. She was married at an unknown date to Sir John Logie of that ilk (died 1363?), almost certainly the grandson of the Sir John Logie executed by Robert I after the Soulis conspiracy in 1320. Her husband was apparently still alive after 1 April 1363, but presumably died soon after. From this marriage Margaret had at least one son, another John Logie ['see below']. 
The first mention of Margaret Logie (as she was then described) in connection with her future husband, David II (1324-1371), is in a charter to the Friars Preachers of Aberdeen, dated 20 January 1363, making a grant for the souls of David himself and of 'our beloved' Margaret Logie ('dilecte nostre'). This open recognition of their relationship suggests that David already contemplated a second marriage, if Margaret should be free to contract one; his first wife, Joan, the sister of Edward III, had died on 7 September 1362. Since the Drummond family was powerful and involved in a violent feud against kinsmen and allies of Robert the Steward, this relationship may have helped to cause the Steward to join two other prominent nobles, the earls of March and Douglas, in 1363 in a revolt whose origins are complex and obscure. It may have been in part a reaction to the king's seizure of Mar's castle of Kildrummy early in that year (Mar was married to Douglas's sister). And the rebels were probably also concerned that David's failure to pay his ransom might lead to their being sent as hostages to England. Others besides the Steward may have feared the influence of the new mistress's and prospective queen's relations. After the revolt collapsed, and presumably after the death of Sir John Logie, David proceeded to marry Margaret at Inchmurdo in Fife, where the formal submissions of the Steward and the other rebels were performed on 14 May 1363. The date of the marriage remains uncertain: Andrew Wyntoun gives it as early as April 1363. According to the fifteenth-century chronicler Walter Bower, David sought the marriage 'not so much for the excellence of her character... as for the pleasure he took in her desirable appearance' (Bower, 7.333). An even stronger motive was probably his desire for the heir which had been denied his first marriage. 
For some years Margaret seems to have been in high favour, while her Drummond relatives made prestigious and profitable marriages; her nephew Sir Malcolm Drummond (d. 1402?) ['see under 'Drummond family] married the daughter of the earl of Douglas, and her niece Annabella became the wife of the Steward's son, the future Robert III. By 1368, however, still with no heir in prospect, her position had become less sure. There was an obscure quarrel between David and several members of the Stewart family which Bower attributes to Margaret's influence, though the reasons may have been quite other. David soon after turned on Margaret herself (according to the fifteenth-century 'Liber pluscardensis', because she pretended to be pregnant when she was not) and instituted proceedings for a divorce, on what grounds is unknown. This was duly pronounced, probably early in 1369. But Margaret would not go quietly. She is said to have escaped to England and thence appealed to the pope in Avignon: she received a safe conduct to pass through England in 1372 and there is an acknowledgement of a loan to her made by three London merchants at Avignon in June of the same year. Her proceedings, which were continued after David's death in 1371, were ended only by her death, which occurred on a pilgrimage to Rome, probably in or soon after 1374.

John Logie (fl. c.1365-c.1395), Margaret's son from her first marriage, had been the beneficiary of special favour from David II, who made several grants of land to him, including the royal lands of Annandale in 1366. In the same year the king granted that the lands of Logie in Strathearn, which had previously been held of the Steward, were in future to be held in barony from the crown; this concession was repeated two years later. Logie continued to be important in the reigns of Robert II and Robert III. A cousin of Annabella Drummond, the wife of John, earl of Carrick, he seems to have attached himself firmly to the Carrick party in the complex politics of the later years of Robert II. Logie was involved in a long-running dispute over Strath Gartney with Carrick's younger brother and rival, Robert, earl of Fife, a dispute which Logie ultimately won after Carrick succeeded to the throne as Robert III in 1390. It was probably he who appeared as chamberlain to the king's eldest son, David, earl of Carrick, in the early 1390s. The date of his death is not known.

Maxwell, Herbert, first Lord Maxwell (c.1390-1453), courtier and landowner, was the eldest son of Sir Herbert Maxwell of Caerlaverock and his wife, Katherine, daughter of John Stewart of Dalswinton. The younger Herbert succeeded his father in 1420 and was knighted at the coronation of James I in 1424. His main estate was Caerlaverock in Dumfriesshire, and he may have carried on significant building work on the castle there; he also owned lands in Roxburghshire, Haddingtonshire, Perthshire, Lanarkshire, and Renfrewshire (where in 1450 he had royal licence to build a castle at Mearns). The extent of his possessions made him one of the leading Scottish barons in the 1420s and 1430s, and about July 1445, along with several other similarly prominent nobles, he assumed a peerage title, as first Lord Maxwell. At this time he was an adherent of the Black Douglases, as indeed he had probably been throughout his formative years -- his father was steward of Annandale to the fourth earl of Douglas -- but when the tide turned against the Douglases after the killing of the eighth earl by James II in 1452, Maxwell appears to have been loyal to his monarch rather than to his patron. He died in late 1453, however, before the final manoeuvres by the crown against the Douglases. He is said to have married first a daughter of Sir Herbert Herries of Terregles; they had (probably) three sons and a daughter. He and his second wife, Katherine ('c'.1410-1468x78), daughter of Sir William Seton and widow of Sir Alan Stewart of Darnley, had five sons and two daughters.

Robert Maxwell (c.1410-1485), succeeded his father as second Lord Maxwell in 1454. He made a bond of friendship to the Boyds which may have led him to support their removal of the young James III from Linlithgow to Edinburgh in July 1466. While they were pardoned, the action led to their fall in 1469; Maxwell may have escaped direct censure, although (like his father) he was seldom at court but occasionally attended parliament. He yielded the office of steward of Annandale, for which an annual fee was paid by the crown, in his eldest son's favour in 1455. About 1425, probably when a minor, he married Janet ('fl'. 1425-1486), daughter of Sir John Forrester of Corstorphine (died 1450), the chamberlain of James I. They had at least five sons and two daughters; two further sons are recorded. Maxwell died about April 1485. In 1478 he had resigned the barony of Maxwell in favour of his eldest son, John, whereafter John was sometimes styled Lord Maxwell, but he was killed in 1484. His marriage 'c'.1454 to Janet, daughter of George Crichton, earl of Caithness (died 1454), was of great potential importance because of the standing the Crichtons then enjoyed at court. The couple had seven sons and two daughters.

John Maxwell (c.1455-1513), succeeded his father and grandfather, and is normally styled fourth Lord Maxwell. His family was engaged in some of the feuds which troubled public order during the later years of James III's reign. In 1479 a dispute in Nithsdale between 'the lord carlaverok' and William Douglas of Drumlanrig was one of those singled out in parliament as needing to be settled. And the Maxwells had a bitter feud with another Dumfriesshire family, the Murrays of Cockpool. It was probably in 1486, a year after both sides had recorded assurances that they would not bring the other to harm, that the Murrays waylaid the fourth Lord Maxwell and his followers, killing his uncle and others. A concord was sealed on 4 September 1486, whereby the Murrays undertook to attend at Dumfries or Edinburgh market cross in linen clothes and seek Maxwell's forgiveness, and also to have masses sung for the souls of the slain. Nevertheless, the fourth lord's decision to join the rebels against James III in 1488 (apparently taken only shortly before the battle of Sauchieburn) may have been heavily influenced by the support the king was giving to Cuthbert Murray of Cockpool. Maxwell established himself at James IV's court thereafter, and performed occasional service as one of the king's council in judicial affairs throughout the reign. He was active in the property market and persuaded some lairds of south-west Scotland to give him bonds of manrent. Research has suggested that these bonds, which first appear in the 1440s, show lairds who had been recently raised to the peerage seeking to enhance their status over minor lairds by securing written personal promises of loyalty, often for life, in return for maintenance of the subscribers' interests. Maxwell and his sons also persuaded some local religious houses to appoint them as bailies of their property. He was killed at the battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, along with three of his brothers. About 1491 he married Agnes ('fl'. 1491-1530), daughter of Sir Alexander Stewart of Garlies. They had four sons, the eldest of whom, Robert, succeeded as fifth Lord Maxwell, and four daughters; Maxwell may have fathered two illegitimate sons.

Murrell, Christine Mary (1874-1933), physician, was born on 18 October 1874 at 1 Jeffrey's Road, Clapham Road, London, the only child of Charles Murrell, a coal merchant, and his wife, Alice Elizabeth Rains. Being both the only child and the only grandchild of a well-to-do family, she grew up enjoying plenty of affection and attention from family members, who later seem to have been willing to help her to pursue a professional career. In 1894 she entered the London School of Medicine for Women; she received the degrees of MB BS at the University of London in 1899. During the early part of her career she held various posts, including locum tenens at Morpeth, resident clinical assistant at the Northumberland County Asylum, medical officer at the Victoria settlement in Liverpool, and house physician and medical registrar at the Royal Free Hospital, London. In 1903, with financial support from her grandfather John Rains, she set up a private practice in Bayswater, London, with her lifelong partner and friend Dr (Elizabeth) Honor Bone. After experiencing some initial difficulty, they became established in practice by 1908. Meanwhile Murrell had completed an MD in psychology and mental diseases at the University of London (1905). Like many doctors at that time she was also interested in the problem of infant welfare. In 1907 she took charge of the St Marylebone Health Society's 'Infant Consultation' on Lisson Grove, one of the earliest infant welfare clinics. There she provided medical examinations for infants and advice to mothers for the following eighteen years. 
Murrell's most significant achievement was her fight for equal opportunities for women. She believed that it was women's lack of knowledge about their own physiology and health that led them to the erroneous idea that their 'disabilities' were natural. Thus, for about twenty years she gave a series of evening lectures at the London county council, directed mainly at working-class women and covering various health-related subjects, including first aid, home nursing, infant care, and the physiology of adolescence. The lecture series on physiology was published in 1923 as 'Womanhood and Health'. Another important contribution in this area was her study of menstruation. In 1925, under the auspices of the London Association of the Medical Women's Federation, Murrell and Letitia Fairfield initiated a survey on menstrual experience among girls in an attempt to eliminate negative associations with it. A larger-scale survey was launched in 1926 and the results appeared in 'The Lancet' in 1930. Murrell's opposition to the proposed restrictive legislation for women in industry can be understood as an extension of this research, because such legislation was based on the assumption that women were physically inferior and therefore unsuitable for certain types of work. She argued that instead of this kind of legislation there should be 'an improvement in the general conditions of labour, good pay, reasonable hours, and healthy conditions under which to work' ('BMJ', 1932, 106). 
Before the First World War, Murrell's fight for equality also extended to the women's suffrage movement. As her biographer recounted, Murrell 'helped to manage one of the suffrage propaganda shops, addressed meetings, went on the deputations..., marched in the processions... and put her medical skill at the service of the hunger-strikers, when, near death, they were released from prison under the ''Cat and Mouse Act''. (St John, 57)' During the war, she worked as one of the medical officers, and was later chair, of the Women's Emergency Corps. She also served as a medical officer to the Metropolitan Special Constabulary. After the passage of the 'Sex Disqualification Removal Bill' in 1918, she joined the women's election committee which sought the adoption of women candidates for election to the House of Commons. 
Murrell did a great deal of public work and achieved many distinctions. She was an active member of the Medical Women's Federation, serving as its fifth president (1926-8), and was a member of the International Medical Women's Association. Although she was a prominent medical woman, her professional activities were not limited to women's issues. She served on various committees and high offices of the British Medical Association, which culminated in her being elected the first female member of the council in 1924. In September 1933 she was elected as the first female representative to the General Medical Council, the governing body of the medical profession, but before she could take the seat she died of cancer at her home, 21 North Gate, London, on 18 October 1933. She never married.

Montgomery family (per. c.1350-c.1485), nobility, was important in the history of Renfrewshire and Ayrshire (in particular the region of Cunningham in north Ayrshire) in the south-west of Scotland. Persons bearing the name Montgomery first appear in Scotland in the twelfth century, in the retinue and lands of the Stewarts in Renfrewshire and Ayrshire, and their rise to prominence in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries probably owed much to the Stewart accession to the crown in 1371. They also had links with the Douglases.

William Henry Waddington (1826-1894). They had a son, Francis. Waddington's grandfather was an English cotton manufacturer and banker who had become a French citizen. Waddington, born on 11 December 1826 at St Remy sur Avre, Eure-et-Loir, was the son of Thomas Waddington (1792-1869) and Janet Mackintosh Colin Chisholm (died 1890), and was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he rowed for the university in the boat race in 1849. On returning to France, Waddington took up a political career, was elected to the national assembly, and in 1873 became minister of public instruction. In 1876 he was elected a senator, resuming the same portfolio. In December 1877 he became minister of foreign affairs, in which capacity he attended the congress of Berlin in 1878. He served as prime minister in 1879, and, having declined ambassadorial appointment in 1880, in May 1883 he attended the coronation of Alexander III in Moscow as ambassador-extraordinary. On his return to France he was appointed ambassador to the court of St James, which appointment he held for ten years. Waddington was a keen student of numismatics and published widely on the subject; his collection of coins is in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris. Mary Gladstone, visiting Paris in 1879, described Waddington as 'very English in appearance and manner, reticent but not the kind of reticence that implies volumes, in fact rather dull', but she liked his wife, 'a lively, sensible American' ('Mary Gladstone', 176).

Sir John Montgomery of Ardrossan (d. 1427x9) was in possession of his lands. He styled himself lord of Ardrossan and also held the estate of Giffen in Kyle Stewart in Ayrshire. He was bailie not only of Cunningham but also of the barony of Kilbride (once held by the future Robert III) in the sheriffdom of Lanark. His first wife, Agnes, was a daughter of John, lord of the Isles, while his second wife, Margaret, was a Maxwell of Carlaverock, in Dumfries-shire. Sir John was taken captive by the English at the battle of Homildon in 1402, and spent a good deal of the next six years as a prisoner or hostage in England. Subsequently he seems to have managed Cunningham on behalf of the Stewart dukes of Albany, governors of Scotland during the captivity of James I in England between 1406 and 1424. He also engaged in overseas trading activity and apparently owned a ship called 'La Wynyne'. In 1424 James I returned to Scotland. He probably resented the services that Montgomery, formerly a retainer of his father and elder brother, the duke of Rothesay, had rendered to the Albany Stewarts. Consequently Sir John was arrested at parliament in March 1425 along with Murdoch Stewart, duke of Albany, and the latter's family. He was quickly released, and subsequently demonstrated his loyalty to the king by serving on the assize that convicted Murdoch and others at Stirling in May 1425, and by being one of the joint leaders of an expedition which at Loch Lomond in June crushed a rebellion led by James Stewart, a surviving son of Duke Murdoch, but the king probably remained suspicious. One of the other leaders of this expedition was Sir John's neighbour in Cunningham, Sir Robert Cunningham of Kilmaurs, who had also served on the Stirling assize. It is likely that the king arranged the indenture that on 6 June 1425 Sir John entered into with Sir Robert for the latter's marriage with Sir John's daughter Anna. This provided for a life grant of the office of bailie of Cunningham to Sir Robert, with reversion to Sir John and his heirs on Sir Robert's death. This document also seems to anticipate what in fact happened a couple of months later (which may also have been a sign of royal displeasure), the sending of Sir John into England in exchange for a hostage returning to Scotland. He seems not to have returned to Scotland, and to have died in England, possibly at Pontefract Castle.

Monypenny, William, first Lord Monypenny (d. in or before 1488), diplomat, was the son of Sir William Monypenny and Margaret or Marjorie Arbuthnott, only daughter of Philip Arbuthnott of that ilk. Born shortly after 1410 he probably went to France in 1436 as part of the entourage of Margaret Stewart, daughter of James I, who married the dauphin Louis in that year, and by 1439 he was in the French king's service. In July 1447 Monypenny was described as 'escuier d'escuieres' of Charles VII of France; he took a prominent part in the expulsion of the English from Normandy and was knighted on 16 October 1449 for his role in the siege of Rouen; rewarded by Charles VII in 1450 following the recovery of Normandy, he received the lordship of Concressault in Berry between 1451 and 1458. 
Monypenny's French rewards were, if anything, exceeded by those from the Scottish crown. On 1 May 1450 he was given the lands of the Halls of Airth in Stirlingshire, specifically for ambassadorial services to James II's sisters and father; further grants of land in Stirlingshire, Aberdeenshire, and Kirkcudbrightshire were made in the 1450s. He was probably created a lord of parliament towards the end of James II's reign, about 1458; he is first described as Lord Monypenny in a grant of 17 July 1464. 
Monypenny's career as a diplomat spanned more than three decades. After his entry into French service he acted as an ambassador for the Scottish crown in the negotiations leading to the marriage of James II's sister Isabella to Francois, count of Montfort (later duke of Brittany), in 1441-2. In 1447 he sank a great deal of money into the abortive and tasteless French scheme to marry the recently widowed dauphin to Eleanor Stewart, younger sister of his widow, Margaret who had died as recently as 1445. Monypenny was Charles VII's ambassador in Scotland in 1456 and at Bourges in the summer of 1460 he presented James II's demands for a marriage alliance and for the Orkneys and Shetlands in full sovereignty to the astonished Danes. Such cosmopolitan activities involved a high degree of risk; in November 1451 he was captured by the English at Whitby, and ransomed only for an enormous sum put up jointly by Bishop William Turnbull of Glasgow and Charles VII of France. 
Monypenny's later ambassadorial tasks, in association with his son Alexander (the child of his marriage to Catherine Stewart (died 1486)), were almost wholly in the service of Louis XI, who gave him an annual pension of 1200 livres tournois and in October 1473 made him seneschal of Saintonge, the French county to which successive kings of Scots had laid claim -- in vain -- since 1428. Alexander had succeeded his father as second Lord Monypenny by 4 July 1488.

Morow, John (fl. c.1430), master mason, was of French origin, but came to work in Scotland. Practically all that is known of his life is derived from an inscribed panel he inserted in the south aisle of the Cistercian abbey of Melrose, which records that he was born in Paris, and had been in charge of masonwork at St Andrews, Glasgow, Paisley, Nithsdale (this may refer to Lincluden), and Galloway (possibly Whithorn). His contribution to Melrose is probably identifiable in a number of windows inserted into the presbytery, the south transept, and the first of the chapels along the south nave flank. It thus fits between the start of rebuilding the abbey church after its destruction by Richard II of England in 1385 and the completion of the south transept and continuation of work into the nave by Abbot Andrew Hunter (who was in office from 1444 to some date between about 1465 and 1471). 
Morow's work at some of the other churches listed on the panel may be identified through the use of an identical tracery type in the east bays of the north nave aisle at Paisley Abbey and in the choir of Lincluden collegiate church. The former can be approximately dated as being between operations supported by Robert II in 1389 and Abbot John Lithgow's selection of his burial place (apparently in the vicinity of the north porch) in 1434. Lincluden was founded about 1389, but much of the building is of the period between 1406, when correspondence with the pope refers to it as unfinished, and about 1451, when Princess Margaret, countess of Douglas and duchess of Touraine, whose tomb is a prominent feature of the choir, died. The tracery in these buildings is marked by a sensitive balance of restrained flowing forms with 'spherical' figures, which has few parallels in Scotland, but is reflected in several French buildings. The mouldings associated with the windows at Melrose, Paisley, and Lincluden are also closely similar to one another. 
A further pointer to Morow's contribution may be the use of corbels with crouching biblical figures holding a scroll. This motif, common in continental Europe, is found in Scotland only at Melrose and Lincluden, and in two displaced fragments which are thought to come from the demolished south-western tower at Glasgow Cathedral; they are thus all at churches included on Morow's list. Of the other churches listed at Melrose, it might be argued there is some degree of French inspiration in the fragmentary remains of the nave of St Andrew Cathedral as rebuilt after the fire of 1378, when the bishop was Walter Trail (died 1401), a graduate of Paris and Orleans. This is best seen in the stilted-arched west windows and in the way the sub-bases of the arcade piers are elongated towards the main space, presumably to support full-height wall shafts on this side. However, there is nothing that could be associated specifically with Morow from what is known of his work elsewhere, and it may be that any French-inspired elements at St Andrews were the contribution of his colleagues. 
Morow's work represents a highly significant contribution to Scottish architectural thought at a time when there was a resurgence of ecclesiastical building activity after the long wars with England, and English influences were being increasingly rejected in favour of a synthesis in which continental European inspiration played an important part.

Murray, Sir Andrew, of Bothwell (1298-1338), soldier and administrator, was the posthumous son of Andrew Murray, who died of wounds received at Stirling Bridge in 1297; his grandfather was then still alive. Nothing is known of his youth, save that in November 1300 he was thought to be living in Moray among the English king's enemies. He may well have been taken south in 1304 or 1306-7, because a prisoner Andrew Murray was released with others by Edward II in the aftermath of Bannockburn. Otherwise he first appears, as witness to a royal charter, on 1 April 1320, five days before the date of the declaration of Arbroath. The draft of that document includes among the senders a 'panetar' of Scotland (the 'panetar', or pantler, was the officer responsible for the royal household's bread supply); this was a family honour which Murray had probably inherited from his great-uncle (died 1300), and its presence here suggests that his name preceded these words and had been deleted -- as were the same words in the final version. He was knighted by 1320. In July 1326, when he was already father of two sons and a widower, Murray married the king's sister Christian Bruce, widow of Sir Christopher Seton, and was given the Garioch as the dowry. But he was a rare witness to royal acts thereafter, and there is no evidence that he participated in the Weardale campaign of 1327. 
At the invasion of the 'disinherited' in 1332 the Scottish community looked to the extended Bruce family for leadership, and after the death of Donald, earl of Mar, at Dupplin Moor they chose Murray, who may have been keeper of Berwick at the time, to be guardian of the kingdom. With Sir Archibald Douglas he tracked Edward Balliol from Perth to Galloway and then to Roxburgh, where, during an attempt to break the bridge at Kelso, Murray risked his person to save a follower. He was taken prisoner and sent to Edward III, still officially at peace with David II. 
By the time Murray was allowed to ransom himself, in the summer of 1334, Berwick was in English hands and the purpose of Edward III to annex the southern counties of Scotland was clear. David II was in France, Scotland had been briefly subdued by the two Edwards, but was once more in active 'rebellion', and Murray hastened north to besiege Sir Henry de Beaumont in Dundarg Castle on the north coast of Buchan. Although Edward III hoped to relieve it, after bombardment by a siege engine it capitulated on 23 December 1334. 
Scotland was falling rapidly into disorder when John Randolph, earl of Moray and now guardian, held a parliament, attended by Murray, at Dairsie, near Cupar, Fife, in April 1335, for while the patriotic party was not strong enough to expel Edward III, Edward was unable to control Scotland. David Strathbogie, titular earl of Atholl, had deserted to the patriotic cause, but was scarcely popular at the parliament, which could resolve only on a policy of scorched earth. By August 1335 Edward III was installed in Perth with a large army, the guardian, Moray, was a prisoner in England, and Strathbogie had negotiated a submission which included many patriotic magnates. None the less enough remained faithful to meet at Dumbarton in September 1335 and once more choose Murray as guardian. 
Despite the usual view that he was a stout patriot, Murray employed the next two months in short truces frequently extended, negotiating with Edward III for a settlement which would make some provision for David Bruce. During these talks he learned that his wife, Christian Bruce, was besieged in Kildrummy Castle by Strathbogie, acting as lieutenant for Edward Balliol. With a force of about 1000, and apparently with the agreement of the English negotiators, Murray marched north to the relief of his wife. Strathbogie broke off the siege and came south to the Dee near Ballater. There, at Culblean Hill on 30 November 1335, Murray, Sir William Douglas, and their forces came upon Strathbogie's men from the rear; Douglas's men broke their charge and Murray took them from the flank. They turned and fled, save Strathbogie and his retinue, who fought on to the death. The forces were small, but the importance of the victory great, for it gave Murray the heart to refuse the compromise terms negotiated; from that time, the chroniclers noted, the war turned in favour of the Scots. 
During the winter of 1335-6 Murray unsuccessfully besieged Cupar Castle, Fife, and held a council at Dunfermline at which he was confirmed as guardian, before marching north to besiege Strathbogie's widow in Lochindorb Castle. Edward III once more came to Perth, and set out with a small force to rescue the lady and if possible destroy Murray. He saved the lady and ravaged much of the country of Moray, but Murray eluded him and, in Edward's absence -- the English king returned to spend the end of 1336 in Bothwell -- took and destroyed the castles of Dunnottar, Kinneff, Lauriston, and Kinclaven. Cupar again held out in February 1337, but St Andrews Castle fell before a siege engine called Buster. Edward III had gone home, so Murray took his engine to Bothwell and battered down the castle (which was his own heritage) in March 1337. In August, as though the days of Robert I had returned, he was raiding Cumberland, in September Northumberland, taking much loot. Lothian remained nominally in English control, but in fact both sides destroyed its economy, as happened when Murray failed to take Edinburgh at the end of 1337. He had adopted scorched earth tactics and rendered untenable the castles which he took. In short, at a high cost to Scotland, he made it too expensive, too chancy, too time-consuming, for Edward III to hold, and in 1338 Edward turned his attention to France. Murray retired to his castle at Avoch on the Black Isle, where he died that year at an unknown date in Lent (25 February to 12 April). He was buried nearby at Rosemarkie, but his remains were afterwards removed to Dunfermline Abbey. 
The nickname the Rich, sometimes attributed to Murray, is not well attested, though he did pay off a very large ransom. His second wife, Christian Bruce, lived on until 1356. He and his first wife, whose identity is unknown, had two sons, John and Thomas, who succeeded to the estates in turn. The second son, Sir Thomas Murray of Bothwell (d. 1361), panetar of Scotland, entered England about September 1351 as a hostage for David II, then on ticket-of-leave in Scotland, soon after succeeding his deceased brother, John. He would return home in 1352, and was apparently knighted by 1353; he participated in the negotiations for the release of David II in 1354 and was party to the treaty of Berwick of 5 October 1357. While he was not named as hostage for payment of David's ransom, he was among the eight prominent magnates from whom three special hostages were to be sent if David failed to keep up payment. Late in 1358 he delivered himself to Edward III as a prisoner, but was given leave to go home; if he went, he was back by July 1359 and remained thereafter in London, where he died, probably of plague, in 1361. He was certainly not held as a special hostage, and must have gone in place of one of the ordinary hostages named in the treaty. He and his wife, Joanna Murray (died after 1401), daughter of Maurice Murray, earl of Strathearn, had no surviving children, and it is not clear how Bothwell and other lands passed to her second husband, Archibald, third earl of Douglas.

Murray, Maurice, earl of Strathearn (d. 1346), magnate, was probably the eldest son of Sir John Murray (died 'c'.1333) of Drumsargard in Lanarkshire, who supported Robert Bruce's seizure of the Scottish kingship as early as 1306. Maurice's mother is unknown, but by about 1320 Mary, daughter of Malise, seventh earl of Strathearn, was probably his stepmother, and her father at that time gave Maurice's father minor Tayside lands. Although he was a relatively unimportant noble, the second phase of Scotland's wars of independence gave Maurice the opportunity to enhance his local and national position by service to the Bruce cause. He may have been old enough to fight for the infant David II against Edward Balliol's English-backed invasion at Dupplin (1332) and Halidon Hill (1333). But he first appears on record, of age and in his father's lands, after David had taken refuge in France in May 1334, serving as sheriff of Lanark by October 1334 and supporting Andrew Murray (guardian for David II from 1335 to 1338) in his rejection of English peace terms at Berwick in August 1335. The Lanercost chronicler alleges that in 1335 Maurice killed Sir Godfrey Ros, the pro-Balliol sheriff of Ayr and Lanark, in revenge for Ros's murder of Maurice's (unnamed) brother. In fact Ros appears to have been alive in 1336, though Murray's ability to lead an armed following from Lanarkshire for the Bruce cause undoubtedly gave him standing there, so that the fifteenth-century chronicler Walter Bower styled him 'Lord of Clydesdale'. 
In 1339 Murray led a division at the successful siege of Perth organized by Robert the Steward (guardian in 1338-41). But it was after David II's return from France in June 1341 that Murray's career took off and he became a royal favourite, useful both in recovering ground lost to English occupation and in acting as a restraint on the king's ostensible supporters who had increased their regional power in the king's absence, in particular Robert the Steward. In November 1341 Maurice helped his kinsman Sir William Murray of Tullibardine recover his lands from Sir William More of Abercorn, a kinsman of the Steward's wife. Among several royal grants to Maurice between 1341 and 1346 was custody of Stirling Castle in July 1342, shortly after its recovery in a siege whose success the chroniclers attribute to the Steward's leadership. In the same year David also gave Maurice the large baronies of Strathaven in Lanarkshire and Sprouston and Hawick in Roxburghshire. David no doubt looked to Murray to act as a counter-weight to the regional influence of the Steward in Clydesdale and of William Douglas in Liddesdale and the border marches -- the relations of both these men with the crown had rapidly deteriorated after 1341. 
On 31 October 1343 David granted Murray and his male heirs the vacant earldom of Strathearn. Murray may have sought confirmation of his claim to this title in the right of his wife. Yet the grant surely prompted a challenge by the Steward (long-time lord of Methven and, by 1342, earl of neighbouring Atholl) and other lords with ambitions in central Scotland. In a tense parliament at Scone in June 1344 David had to direct a reassertion of the crown's effective forfeiture of Malise, eighth earl of Strathearn (who was represented there by his son-in-law William, earl of Ross); the Steward as guardian had originally seen Malise cleared of treason at a parliament at Perth in 1339, despite his surrender of his earldom to Edward Balliol. Strathearn was reconfirmed to Murray; in the same parliament he was named among the cautioners (securities) for the followers of the murdered Alexander Ramsay in their feud with Douglas of Liddesdale, whose cautioners included the Steward. 
Murray was a regular royal charter witness and itinerant household retainer between 1341 and 1346. Towards the end of that period he was created a justiciar, perhaps north of the Forth, and he would undoubtedly have become a key figure in David II's regime had he not been killed, along with many of the king's closest supporters, in the battle of Nevilles Cross, outside Durham, on 17 October 1346; with David captured, the Steward fled the field and had secured Strathearn for himself by 1357. 
Murray had a papal dispensation dated 10 July 1339 to marry Joanna Menteith (died after 1364), widow successively of (remarkably) Malise, seventh earl of Strathearn (died 'c'.1325), for a time Murray's stepgrandfather, and John Campbell, earl of Atholl (died 1333), with whom Murray was related within the third degree. Murray is not recorded as having had legitimate issue, although he may have had a bastard, Maurice, to whom David granted lands near Edinburgh in 1358. His widow married William, earl of Sutherland (another royal favourite), in 1347. Their daughter, Joanna, married first Thomas Murray of Bothwell (died 1361) and second, about 1362, Archibald Douglas, later lord of Bothwell and Galloway and third earl of Douglas; his possession of Drumsargard (but not of Hawick, Sprouston, Strathaven, and other lands) was briefly challenged by Maurice Murray's younger brother, Alexander.

Oliphant family (per. 1141-c.1500), nobility, was important in the history of Perthshire, as well as, from time to time, in national politics. The original form of their name was Olifard. The family, which may have been of Flemish origin, first came to Scotland in 1141 in somewhat romantic circumstances: young David Oliphant of Lilford in Northamptonshire was able to save his godfather, David, king of Scots (died 1153), from King Stephen's army after the siege of Winchester. They fled to Scotland where Oliphant was rewarded with lands in Roxburghshire and East Lothian. Succeeding generations continued to serve the Scottish crown to good effect, most particularly as justiciars of Lothian. David's son and heir, Walter, was married to Christian, daughter of Earl Ferteth of Strathearn, an example of a Celtic-Norman marriage not uncommon in this period. Through this marriage the Oliphants gained a foothold in Perthshire, where they had become well established by the middle of the thirteenth century, along with the Ruthvens, Grahams, Murrays, and Drummonds. All these families would play a dominant role in local politics during succeeding centuries. 
Although the Oliphants were prominent in royal circles before the fourteenth century, the most famous member of the family, by virtue of the part he played in the wars with England, was

Sir Walter Oliphant of Aberdalgie (d. in or after 1378), married Elizabeth Bruce, illegitimate daughter of the king and thus half-sister to David II (1324-1371) and step-aunt to Robert II ('r'. 1371-1390). In February 1365 Oliphant surrendered to the king his principal estates in Perthshire -- including Aberdalgie -- Forfarshire, and Kincardineshire, and received them back in a sequence of grants made to himself and his wife jointly, with an entail securing them for their heirs. The family continued to expand their territorial holdings, receiving, among others, the lands of Kelly, resigned by his cousin, Helen Maxwell, from King David. Although Walter was not particularly active in national politics, he is recorded in 1368 as entrusted with the keeping of Stirling Castle. His wife was also remembered by her half-brother throughout his reign, receiving $3 from wine escheated by a certain William Clapham by the king's gift as late as 1365. The last reference to Sir Walter occurs in 1378. The couple had three sons: Sir John, who inherited most of the family's extensive landed interests; Sir Walter, who was the ancestor of the Oliphants of Pittotter, Kellie, Murdocairnie, and Prinlaws; and Malcolm, who founded the Ayrshire branch of the family. 
Despite their royal connections, the Oliphants effectively retired from the national scene for over a century after 1329; it is not even known whether or not representatives of the family were present at Halidon Hill or Nevilles Cross, though it seems very likely. Subsequent events suggest that they preferred to play a greater role in local politics. Sir Walter's son, Sir John, makes little mark on the national record. In 1424, however, John's son and heir, Sir William Oliphant of Aberdalgie, was chosen as one of the hostages sent to England as part of the ransom agreement for the return of James I. He was still there in 1425, and probably died in prison. William's son, Sir John, had the misfortune to become involved in a local dispute through his marriage to Isabel, daughter of Sir Walter Ogilvy of Auchterhouse. The Ogilvys were at feud with the Lindsays, and when their quarrel took a particularly violent turn, in what has sometimes been called the battle of Arbroath, on 23 January 1446, Sir John was among those killed. His son,

Peebles, John (d. 1390/91), administrator and bishop of Dunkeld, is of unknown origins, though his name and early career suggest he was probably born and raised in the diocese of Glasgow. He attended the University of Paris from about 1351 to 1355, but did not obtain any formal legal degree before returning to serve in the court of, and as a legal official for, the bishop of Glasgow between 1355 and 1363. In 1363 he resumed his studies in France, and by June 1365 he had become a bachelor in both civil and canon law. By the time of his return to Scotland in 1368, moreover, he had obtained a doctorate in canon law. On his homecoming Peebles entered the service of David II and in 1369 he acted as the king's envoy to Rome, probably to represent the Scottish king in his divorce action against Queen Margaret. Peebles also enjoyed patronage from one of the most influential and powerful Scottish magnates of the time, William, first earl of Douglas; shortly before 13 March 1370 he was given charge of the church of Douglas, a benefice in the gift of the earl. After King David's death on 22 February 1371 Peebles passed into the service of his successor, Robert II. Peebles was identified as a royal clerk in the first parliament of Robert's reign and received a royal pension of 20 merks from November 1372 to early 1377. In September 1374 he was appointed to the archdeaconry of St Andrews previously held by William Grenlaw and in the following month succeeded Grenlaw as the collector of papal dues in Scotland. Between 11 February and 30 March 1377 Peebles was appointed chancellor of the kingdom, replacing John Carrick. He became bishop of Dunkeld in 1378 after first the death of Bishop Michael Monymusk in March 1377 and then the premature demise of Monymusk's elected successor, Andrew Umfray, at Rome between 1 July and 7 September 1377. 
As chancellor, Peebles was a frequent witness to Robert II's charters and a regular auditor of the exchequer. He was also a very active diplomat, taking part in Anglo-Scottish negotiations in the 1370s and 1380s, while in September 1384 he and Cardinal Walter Wardlaw, bishop of Glasgow, represented the Scottish crown at a conference at Leulinghen in France which arranged a general cessation in Anglo-Scottish and Anglo-French hostilities until May 1385. While in France, Peebles and Wardlaw seem to have concluded the agreement which saw Jean de Vienne, the French admiral, lead an expeditionary force to Scotland in the summer of 1385 as part of a combined Franco-Scottish assault on northern England on the expiry of the Leulinghen truce. On the whole, Peebles appears to have been a highly competent and respected administrator, employed by successive rulers because of his expertise and reliability. 
Political changes in Scotland during 1388, however, may have reduced Peebles's influence in the royal administration. In a parliament on 2-7 April 1389 he was openly criticized for issuing letters of sasine in favour of Sir Malcolm Drummond, who was involved in a dispute with Archibald Douglas, lord of Galloway, over the inheritance of the second earl of Douglas, killed at the battle of Otterburn in August 1388. Archibald was an ally of Robert, earl of Fife, who had been appointed guardian of the kingdom on 1 December 1388. Peebles, on the other hand, may have been more sympathetic to the claims of Malcolm Drummond, the brother-in-law of the second earl and the son-in-law of the first earl of Douglas, one of Peebles's early patrons. 
Peebles took part in another diplomatic mission in France in the final months of 1389, but had returned to Scotland by January 1390. On or about 18 March 1390 he demitted the office of chancellor, perhaps because of age or infirmity, and Alexander Cockburn appeared as custodian of the great seal. The last reference to Peebles suggests that he performed the coronation of Queen Annabella on 15 August 1390. He died before 1 February 1391, when Robert Sinclair, bishop of Orkney, was translated to the diocese of Dunkeld as his successor.

Thomas Randolph, second earl of Moray (d. 1332), was killed within weeks of succeeding to his father's title, fighting the disinherited at Dupplin Moor, Perthshire, on 12 August 1332, and was succeeded by the third earl, his brother, John Randolph, who was killed at Nevilles Cross. Both brothers were childless, and the earldom passed, despite the entail of 1312, to the earl of Dunbar, husband of their elder sister Agnes Dunbar ['see under 'Dunbar, Patrick (1285-1369)]. The extinction of the Randolph name and male lineage explains, at least in part, Barbour's subordination, in repute, of the first earl to Sir James Douglas.

Sitaram Pande (supp. 1795?-1873x80?), supposed army officer in India and autobiographer, may not have existed. The authenticity of what purport to be his memoirs has been disputed, and if they are a work of fiction then so too is this article, which is largely based on them, and statements here about his life should be read in this light. Sitaram (also written Sita Ram) Pande was supposedly born, probably in 1795, in the village of Tilowee, in the Rae Bareli district of Oudh, the son of Gangadin Pande, a prosperous Brahman yeoman farmer who owned over 150 acres and was a man of importance in his village. Sitaram was educated by the family priest and became literate. Before 1857 the East India Company's Bengal army recruited its sepoys largely from Oudh Brahmans. In 1814 Sitaram's maternal uncle Hanuman, an infantry jemadar, visited Sitaram's parents and inspired him to become a soldier. He and Hanuman travelled together, having a narrow escape from thugs who joined their party, and reached Agra. There, in November, Sitaram enlisted in his uncle's unit, the 2nd battalion, 26th Bengal native infantry, and served in his uncle's company, the light company. 
Sitaram served in the Anglo-Nepal War (1814-16) and in the Pindari war (1817) against Pindari mounted bandits -- 'demons from the lowest hell' (Lunt, 36) -- and was wounded. His first promotion was to lance-naik. In 1818 he served with the 1st battalion, 25th regiment, at the siege of Asirgarh, and in the assault was wounded when a magazine exploded, killing his uncle and most of his company. His mother arranged his marriage, about 1818, to the daughter of a local landowner, but after the wedding he discovered that she was disfigured by smallpox. He served in the fighting against Maratha chiefs' Arab mercenaries, and in the attack on a fort, Ahunpoora, he rescued a beautiful girl from an Arab. She was the daughter of Makum Singh, a Rajput 'thakur' (petty chief) in Bundelkhand, and about 1820 Sitaram made her his second wife. 
In 1820 Sitaram joined a new unit, the Fategarh levy (later the 63rd and 64th Bengal Native Infantry). He served with the 63rd, part of Lord Combermere's army, at the siege and capture of Bharatpur (1825-6) and later was promoted havildar. In 1838, as part of Lord Auckland's plan to restore Shah Shuja to power in Afghanistan, a British-subsidized, British-officered force was raised in India, known as Shah Shuja's levy, and Sitaram became a havildar in it. He served in the First Anglo-Afghan War, and in January 1842, on the disastrous retreat from Kabul, was wounded, captured, and then sold as a slave in Kabul. He later escaped to India, reaching Ferozepore in October 1843, and returned to the 63rd. He served in the first and second Anglo-Sikh wars (1845-6, 1848-9) and in 1847 was promoted jemadar. In 1855 he served against the Santal uprising in Bengal. 
In 1857 Sitaram warned his commanding officer of sepoy discontent, then went on leave and was in his village when the mutiny began. He remained loyal and was abducted by mutineers, then rescued by European irregular cavalry. He joined a new Punjab regiment, probably the 12th Punjab infantry, whose second-in-command, later commanding officer, was Captain (later Major-General) James Thomas Norgate (1824-1894), and served with them against the mutineers in India and Nepal. His son was captured and executed as a mutineer: 'not for one moment did I consider requesting that his life should be spared -- that he did not deserve' (Lunt, 168). After the campaign in Nepal, Sitaram was promoted subedar, but he was then too old. He disliked the post-mutiny army, the Punjabis, and the changed attitudes of British officers. After criticism by officers he retired on a pension in 1860 and returned to his village. During his career he had been awarded six medals. Old and apparently disillusioned, he wrote his memoirs, probably in Adwadhi (western Hindi), comparing unfavourably the army that he had joined with that which he had recently left, criticizing Muslims, and asserting his own loyalty. In 1861 he sent the memoirs to Norgate. He died, presumably at Tilowee, probably between 1873 and 1880. 
Norgate translated Sitaram's memoirs and published them in book form at Lahore in 1873; an Urdu translation was published in the same year. In 1911 an Urdu translation from Norgate's version was published as a language text for British officers, and used until 1947. A summary of the memoirs, with comment, was published in 1959 by Sir Patrick Cadell in the 'Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research'; and an edition by James Lunt was published in 1970 and has been used as a source by military historians. The memoirs contain many inaccuracies of names and dates, and are vague on the units in which Sitaram served, omitting regimental numbers. They were widely known and long accepted as genuine. After 1947, however, some questioned their authenticity, emphasizing their errors, the fact that Sitaram had too many changes of regiment, and that his adventures were 'too good to be true' (Mason, 208). It was alleged that the memoirs were a deliberate fraud by Norgate; J. A. B. Palmer wrote that they were 'of doubtful authenticity' (Palmer, 1). Others, however, including Cadell and Lunt, maintained that they were genuine. There is no conclusive evidence either for or against their authenticity but they may well be genuine, if sometimes inaccurate and possibly embroidered. If authentic then they are the only account published of an Indian sepoy's experiences during the first half of the nineteenth century, and as such they constitute an important historical source.

Roger, William (d. 1482), musician, was English by birth. According to Giovanni Ferrerio, writing in the following century, Roger was one of an embassy sent to Scotland by Edward IV to negotiate twenty years' peace, and was so pleased with the music there that he remained for the rest of his life. He entered the service of James III, and in 1467, described as a clerk of the Chapel Royal, is found receiving $20 (Scots) from the customs of Haddington; in the following two years he was master of the hospital of St Leonard, near Peebles. He was awarded lands at Traquair in Peeblesshire in November 1469, but had to resign them after the general revocation of 1476. He may have been the William Roger, esquire, 'of the realm of Scotland' who on 13 November 1470 was granted a safe conduct to come and go between England and Scotland for a year, and he was probably the clerk of spices in the royal household whose own clerk was paid for receiving spices in 1472-3. 
Roger was one of James III's more than twenty favourites, or household 'familiars', as he called them. Their alleged low birth and apparent influence with the king caused much resentment, and on 22 July 1482 dissident nobles seized the king at Lauder and hanged some of them over the bridge. Earliest reports name only their supposed leader, Thomas Cochrane, but later chronicles list Roger among the victims. According to Ferrerio, who came to Scotland in 1528, Roger was innocent of any crimes when killed. He wrote that Roger, 'musicus rarissimus ex Angliae', was the founder of a school of musicians who still remembered him in 1529. It is possible, as some later historians claimed, that Roger advised James on the disposition of his proposed royal chapel in Stirling (described by the late sixteenth-century historian Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie), though there is no evidence of this.

Ross family (per. c.1215-c.1415), nobility, took both name and title from one of the ancient provinces of Scotland, situated north of the Moray Firth. As first constituted, the earldom comprised only Easter Ross, that is, the eastern and central parts of modern Ross -- its expansion to the Moray Firth and to the west coast was a development of the fourteenth century. At least one earl of Ross is recorded from before the thirteenth century, the mysterious Malcolm Macheth, who after an unsuccessful rebellion against David I was imprisoned for twenty-three years, before being released in 1157 and granted the earldom, which he held until his death in 1168. But although Malcolm had sons they did not follow him as earls, which may explain why they reverted to the rebellious courses which had cost their father his liberty. Indeed, it was the suppression of later Macheths which led to the revival of the earldom. 
In the early summer of 1215 representatives of the families of Macwilliam and Macheth, claimants respectively, it would appear, to the Scottish throne and the earldom of Ross, invaded northern Scotland from the west and were suppressed by forces led by

William Ross, third earl of Ross (d. 1323), was among the nobles who swore in 1284 to uphold the claim of Margaret, the Maid of Norway, to the Scottish throne. In 1290 he subscribed the treaty of Birgham, for Margaret's marriage to Prince Edward of England. A supporter of John Balliol in the Great Cause, he was given custody by King John of a new sheriffdom embracing the outer isles, Skye, Wester Ross, and Kintail. When Anglo-Scottish hostilities began he was captured at the battle of Dunbar; imprisoned in the Tower of London he was not released until 1303, after his wife had petitioned Edward I for her husband's freedom. Shortly afterwards Edward made him warden of Scotland beyond Spey. William's Comyn connections caused him to oppose Robert Bruce in 1306, and when the latter's wife, daughter, and sister took sanctuary at Tain he handed them over to the English. But after his appeals for help to Edward II failed to bring him relief against Scottish attacks he made a truce and then, on 31 October 1308, submitted to King Robert. He was treated leniently and retained his lands (to which Dingwall was added in 1321). With his eldest son he attended Robert's first parliament in 1309, and he was one of the eight earls who set their seals to the declaration of Arbroath in 1320. With his wife, Euphemia (whose ancestry is unknown, though she apparently had property in the sheriffdom of Edinburgh), he had three sons, Hugh, John (who married Margaret, niece and coheir of John Comyn, earl of Buchan), and Walter, who was killed at Bannockburn; and also at least one daughter, Isabel, who married Edward Bruce. Earl William died at Delny, near Invergordon, on 28 January 1323. 
William's eldest son,

Hugh Ross, fourth earl of Ross (d. 1333), was showered with royal favours even before he succeeded to the earldom. Chief among these was his first marriage, to King Robert's sister Maud, daughter of Robert Brus, earl of Carrick, which took place some time before 1323. They had two sons and a daughter. Grants of lands and offices (some of them made to him jointly with his wife) included the sheriffdoms and burghs of Cromarty and Nairn, the Isle of Skye, and estates in southern Ross and the Black Isle, as well as the thanage of Glendowachy in Fife; they helped make Earl Hugh one of the richest magnates in the kingdom. In 1328 he swore on King Robert's behalf that the terms of the Anglo-Scottish treaty for the marriage of Prince David to Princess Joan would be observed. Maud had died some time before 24 November 1329, when Hugh received a dispensation for his marriage to Margaret Graham, daughter of Sir David Graham of Old Montrose; they had a son and three daughters. Hugh was loyal to the cause of King Robert's son. He brought a force to the army which fought for David II at Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333 and was killed there, one of the few Scottish magnates to distinguish himself in the battle. His third son, Hugh, became the ancestor of the Rosses of Balnagown, who eventually carried on the family; and two of his daughters made important marriages, Marjorie to Malise, eighth earl of Strathearn, and Euphemia successively to John Randolph, earl of Moray (d. 1346), and Robert the Steward, later King Robert II. 
The body of Earl Hugh was buried at Fearn. His eldest son and heir,

William Ross, fifth earl of Ross (d. 1372), is traditionally said to have been in banishment in Norway when his father died, and to have formally succeeded to the earldom only on 17 May 1336. Three years later he played an important part in the capture of Perth from the English. He angered David II in October 1346, however, when he came to the muster at Perth for an invasion of England and there instigated the murder of Ranald MacRuaridh, the leader of a contingent from the Outer Isles, with whom he was quarrelling over lands in Kintail. He and his men then left the army. In 1358 he was named as a hostage for the king's release from his English captivity, but may have been slow to depart, since he attended parliaments on 12 November 1358 and 26 October 1359. A powerful figure in the north, in the 1360s William's links with the Steward, and his own marriage (under a dispensation granted 25 May 1342) to Mary, daughter of John of Islay, lord of the Isles, led to his supporting what has been described as a 'highland party' in opposing the king. He paid a high price for his stand. About 1350 he had entailed his earldom and lands on his brother Hugh of Balnagown, and after the early death of his son William apparently reverted to this arrangement. But David, having against her father's will arranged the marriage (before September 1366) of Earl William's elder daughter,

Euphemia Ross (d. before 1399), to Sir Walter Leslie, a leading royalist, in 1370 forced William to resign the earldom of Ross and lordship of Skye to the crown, so that they could be regranted to him under an entail which ensured the succession of Leslie and his wife. On the accession of Robert II in 1371 William addressed a detailed complaint to the new king, complaining of this and other acts of oppression, but Robert did not help him. William died at Delny on 9 February 1372 and was probably buried at Fearn, where he had rebuilt the abbey church. 
Earl William was succeeded by Euphemia, who normally styled herself lady, but on one occasion countess, of Ross. Her younger sister Janet, who married Sir Alexander Fraser, inherited the Buchan lands that had descended to her father from his uncle John Ross. Sir Walter Leslie (who was likewise called lord of Ross rather than earl) died on 27 February 1382, leaving a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Mary or Mariota. Later in that year Euphemia married the king's son Alexander Stewart, 'the wolf of Badenoch', soon to become earl of Buchan and joint owner of all her lands. Their childless marriage was ended by divorce in 1392, after which Euphemia recovered her lordships and estates. On her death, before 1399, she was succeeded in the earldom by her son Alexander Leslie, who married Isabel, daughter of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany, in 1398 and died at Dingwall on 8 May 1402, leaving an only daughter, Euphemia. In 1405 Albany was calling himself lord of the ward of Ross. Ten years later he persuaded Euphemia to convey the earldom to his son John Stewart, already earl of Buchan, with reversion to his other sons and ultimately himself. But his position was challenged by Donald, lord of the Isles, in the name of his wife, Mary Leslie, and the earldom of Ross eventually descended to their son Alexander.

Euphemia (b. in or before 1329?, d. 1388/9), queen of Scots, consort of Robert II, was the daughter of Hugh Ross, fourth earl of Ross (d. 1333) ['see under 'Ross family], and his second wife, Margaret Graham, and was possibly one of the children born before her parents obtained a retrospective papal legitimation of their marriage in November 1329. She married John Randolph, third earl of Moray, who was killed at the battle of Nevilles Cross in 1346. She remained unmarried for almost a decade, until in 1355 a papal dispensation, styling her countess of Moray and widow of John Randolph, was granted for her marriage to Robert the Steward (1316-1390). Euphemia's property rights as the widow of the earl of Moray probably allowed the Steward to claim control of the former Randolph lordship of Badenoch, while the marriage also served to cement Robert's relationship with Euphemia's brother William Ross, fifth earl of Ross ['see under 'Ross family (per. c.1215-c.1415)]. 
On 22 February 1371 Euphemia's husband succeeded to the Scottish throne as Robert II. Although she was recognized and styled as queen from the moment of his succession, her formal coronation took place much later than the new king's. Whereas Robert was crowned on 27 March 1371, Walter Bower's 'Scotichronicon' suggests that Euphemia's coronation occurred between 6 December 1372 and 24 March 1373, in a service conducted at Scone by Alexander Kininmund, bishop of Aberdeen. The delay may have been caused by some uncertainty about the status of David II's recently divorced queen, Margaret Logie, who had set out to the papal court in 1372 in order to protest against her exclusion from her rights as queen of Scots. Scottish clergymen, in particular, may have been unwilling to conduct a ceremony which created a new queen of Scots and pre-empted papal judgement on the issue. Euphemia does not appear in any contemporary accounts as an active or influential figure in the life of the kingdom, and this may partly reflect the transfer of Robert II's affections to his long-term mistress, Mariota Cardeny, a relationship which was openly acknowledged as early as March 1372. 
The marriage of Euphemia and Robert produced two sons, David Stewart and Walter Stewart, but the king's nearest male heirs were the three sons of his first wife, Elizabeth Mure: John (the future Robert III), Robert, and Alexander. The place of David and Walter in the royal succession was detailed in an entail of 4 April 1373, which stipulated that only after the failure of the male lines descending from the three sons of Robert II and Elizabeth Mure could they or their male heirs succeed to the throne. Perhaps it is significant that Euphemia was not crowned queen until shortly before the entailing of the royal title. Euphemia's sons were, however, the beneficiaries of substantial royal patronage after 1371. David became earl of Strathearn and Caithness and lord of Urquhart before his death (1386?). All three titles may have been acquired by David partly through his mother's rights as a kinswoman of Malise, eighth earl of Strathearn and Caithness, and as the widow of John Randolph. Euphemia's second son, Walter, married the heiress to the lordship of Brechin in 1378 and went on to obtain the earldoms of Atholl and Caithness early in the fifteenth century. In March 1437 Walter was executed for his involvement in the assassination of his nephew, James I. 
Euphemia and Robert II also had at least two daughters, Egidia and Elizabeth. Egidia was married about 1388 to William Douglas of Nithsdale, an illegitimate son of Archibald Douglas, third earl of Douglas and lord of Galloway; William was killed in 1391 in a quarrel with English knights at Konigsberg, during preparations for an expedition against the pagan Lithuanians. A dispensation for Elizabeth's marriage to David Lindsay, lord of Glen Esk (created earl of Crawford in 1398), was obtained in 1375 and the couple were married before 1384. 
In an addition to a fifteenth-century manuscript of Bower's 'Scotichronicon', Euphemia is said to have died on 20 February 1388 and to have been buried in Dunfermline Abbey. The intended date may be 20 February 1389, as she was apparently alive on 19 June 1388, but dead by 23 February 1389. A conventional and stylized representation of her as queen is to be found on a seal dating from 1375, which depicts her standing between the arms of the Scottish kingdom and those of the earldom of Ross.
