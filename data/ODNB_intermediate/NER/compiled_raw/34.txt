Faldo, John (1633/4-1691), nonconformist minister and religious controversialist, is of unknown parentage. He is said to have been educated at Cambridge but does not appear in the records of the university and is first heard of as a chaplain to Colonel John Hewson's regiment during the civil war. He also preached to Robert Lilburne's regiment. By 1669 he was living at East Barnet, Hertfordshire, and preaching in nearby Chipping Barnet in a hired room. He was licensed as a nonconformist preacher at Chipping Barnet on 13 May 1672, although the designation 'presbyterian' may well be a clerical error as he was described as 'congregational' (Gordon, 261), on his application for a licence for preaching in a room at Wood Street, Chipping Barnet, in the same year. 
Replying to the Quaker William Penn's 'Spirit of Truth' (1672), Faldo published a 370-page anti-Quaker tract, 'Quakerism No Christianity' (1672). To this Penn replied in the 254 pages of 'Quakerism a New Nick-name for Old Christianity' (1673), for which Faldo offered only the 96-page 'Vindication of Quakerism No Christianity' (1673). Penn again replied with 'The Invalidity of John Faldo's Vindication' (1673). Faldo then issued a challenge to Penn to have a public debate, but Penn declined. After further publications, a new edition of Faldo's first work in the controversy, 'Quakerism No Christianity', was published in 1675 with an 'epistle' commending it and its author by '21 learned divines', leading London nonconformists of a moderate persuasion, including five Independent or congregational and eleven clearly presbyterian leaders, men such as Thomas Jenkyn, Thomas Manton, Matthew Barker, and George Griffith. The epistle's plea to Quakers, 'honest, well-meaning, ignorant persons' (Faldo, 'epistle', 'Quakerism', 1675 edn, unpag. 7), not to confuse strict morality with theological wisdom strongly suggests the pen of Richard Baxter, who was indeed one of the twenty-one. A rather fierce two-page 'letter to the reader' was also included, written by four ministers from Theobalds and Chipping Barnet representing Faldo's Hertfordshire friends. Penn answered this latest work and the controversy then closed with Faldo's reply, 'XXI Divines Cleared' (1675), which added little to the debate. 
Faldo's tracts covered many of the issues raised in earlier debates between Quakers and other Christians: the sacramental ordinances; whether 'the word of God' referred primarily to the 'Bible' or to Christ; whether Jesus's resurrection was physical or spiritual; whether the historical Jesus was the source of human salvation or was merely the prototype life in a 'prepared body' of the eternal Christ-spirit who must transform people within; whether the spirit's inspiration could still produce moral perfection and infallible messages. Before they descended to biblical 'Billingsgate', Penn's and Faldo's pamphlet war served a useful purpose in forcing them to authenticate and clarify their doctrinal beliefs. 
After the controversy Faldo continued in his ministry. He was fined for preaching in February 1683 and in 1684 was in Newgate for the same offence. He was chosen minister of the congregational church at Plaisterers Hall, Addle Street, Aldermanbury, in 1684, apparently preaching to a congregation of some 2000, and later moved his church to Ropemakers' Alley, Moorfields. In 1687 he published a fine book of sermons, 'A Discourse of the Gospel of Peace, and of the Government of our own Spirits', dedicated to Lady Clinton, and in the same year was among eight Independent ministers who took an address of thanks to James II for his declaration for the liberty of conscience. After the revolution of 1688 and the 'Act of Toleration' in 1689, Faldo and the nine still living from the twenty-one, notably Griffith and Barker, shared in the short-lived 'happy union' of presbyterians and congregationalists and Faldo was one of seven congregational managers of the resulting common fund for the support of ministers. 
Faldo's will of 5 February 1691 named his wife, Mary, as executor and left her property in Essex and Hertfordshire, including a house at Rye Hill, Epping. Faldo died from gallstones on 7 February 1691 and was buried in Bunhill Fields, London, in the fifty-seventh year of his age according to his tombstone. John Quick preached his funeral sermon and singled out his reputation as a reconciler of the differences between the sects for praise: 'If the peace-makers are blessed, and shall be called the children of God, then blessed is Mr Faldo; who had an especial hand in the healing of our breaches' (Quick, 30). Mary Faldo died on 5 March 1706.

Fale, Thomas (bap. 1561, d. after 1604), mathematician, was baptized on 20 April 1561 at Redgrave, Suffolk, one of several children born to James Fale, yeoman. He was educated at Botesdale School, and in February 1579 admitted pensioner at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He migrated in 1582 to Corpus Christi College, graduated BA in 1583, and commenced MA in 1586. Ordained deacon in 1585, Fale proceeded BD in 1597, and was appointed curate of Roydon, Essex. 
In 1593 Fale published his only known book, 'Horologiographia: the Art of Dialling', in which he described the design and construction of various dials to tell the time by day or night. His declared aim was to instruct students of mathematics and assist architects, surveyors, sailors, and others. A prefatory letter was addressed to his kinsman Thomas Osborne, who had invented and made one of the dials mentioned. This took the form of a semicircle carrying a sighting arm on which was set a small compass. The mathematician Augustus De Morgan considered Fale's table of sines to be probably the earliest such table to be printed in England. Later editions of the book appeared in 1626 and 1652. In 1604 Fale had a licence from the university to practise physic, but nothing is known of his later life or the circumstances of his death.

Falkener, Edward (1814-1896), architect and archaeologist, was born in London on 28 February 1814, the son of Lyon Falkener (1777-1864), clerk of the ordnance department in the Tower of London, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Stowell (1775-1840). He was educated at a private school in Kent, and after declining a nomination for the civil service of the East India Company on the ground of delicate health, he was articled to John Newman (1786-1859), an architect. He became a student of the Royal Academy in 1836, and in 1839 gained its gold medal for a design for a cathedral church. In the latter year he published 'Was the Ceiling of the Parthenon Flat or Curved?' which was described as 'the introduction to a proposed work on Greek sculpture'. 
In 1842 Falkener started on a tour through all the countries of Europe except Spain and Portugal, through Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, and visited some of the Greek islands. He was a skilful draughtsman and made careful studies of the architectural remains in the various places he visited. While in Denmark he made sketches of the palace of Fredericksberg. When it was burnt in 1859 the king of Denmark, desiring to restore it in its original form, obtained Falkener's original drawings. In acknowledgement the king made him a knight of the order of the Dannebrog. In 1847, when he was at Pompeii, Falkener was allowed to excavate, at his own expense, a house named the house of Marcus Lucretius, a plan and description of which is given in the journal he edited, 'The Museum of Classical Antiquities' (2 vols., 1851-3). The Greek inscriptions he collected during his travels were edited in 1852 by Dr W. Henzen. During his travels he also acquired many examples of medieval Arab metalwork, pottery, arms, and armour. He was one of the first English collectors of such material and was a major lender to the Manchester exhibition in 1857. Unfortunately, his arms and armour were destroyed in a fire at Crystal Palace in 1858. 
On his return to London in 1849, Falkener practised his profession for a few years, building some offices on St Dunstan's Hill, east London, which he occupied, but he devoted most of his time to literary work and making drawings of restorations. His drawings, which were exhibited at the Paris Universal Exhibition (1855), gained him the grand medal of honour, and in 1861 he was presented with another gold medal by the king of Prussia for his works on classical archaeology. 
On 11 May 1866 Falkener married Blanche Mary Golding Victoria (1835-1917), daughter of Benjamin Golding. The next few years were spent near St Briavels, north of Chepstow, where he bought some land and built walled gardens and a belvedere of Agra sandstone overlooking the River Wye. In 1875 the couple moved to Glan-y-mor, St Clears, Carmarthenshire, to which he made substantial alterations (such as the addition of Ottoman stained-glass windows). 
Falkener had a thorough knowledge of architecture and classical archaeology, and, among other things, wrote on the lighting of museums of sculpture, and the artificial illumination of churches and mosques. He was a firm supporter of the lighting of Greek temples by the hypaethron, in opposition to the views of James Fergusson (1808-1886) and Dr Dorpfeld, and published a treatise 'On the Hypaethron of Greek Temples' (1861). Some of the illustrations in Fergusson's 'A History of Architecture in All Countries' (2 vols., 1865-7) were furnished by him, and many of his sketches were published in the Architectural Publication Society's 'Dictionary of Architecture', ed. W. Papworth (8 vols., n.d. [1852]-1892). He was a member of the academy of Bologna, and of the architectural institutes of Berlin and Rome, and was elected honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 2 December 1895. 
Besides the works mentioned, and 'Daedalus, or, The Causes and Principles of the Excellence of Greek Sculpture' (1860) and 'Ephesus and the Temple of Diana' (1862), Falkener frequently contributed to the 'Proceedings of the Royal Institute of British Architects'. Under the pseudonym of E. F. O. Thurcastle (Edward Falkener of Thurcastle) he published in 1884 'Does the 'Revised Version' Affect the Doctrine of the New Testament?'

In 1892, at the age of seventy-eight, Falkener published 'Games Ancient and Oriental and How to Play Them', a pioneering (and somewhat misleading) study of board games with suggested reconstructions, four of which were manufactured and advertised for sale in the book. He continued his studies to the end of his life, and was engaged on a treatise on the Greek houses at Pompeii up to the time of his death at Glan-y-mor on 17 December 1896. He was buried two days later at Laugharne church, Carmarthenshire. His wife, son, and three daughters survived him.

Falkner, Thomas (1707-1784), Jesuit and missionary in South America, the son of Thomas Falkner (or Falconer), a Presbyterian apothecary, and his wife, Hannah ('nee' Walker), was born at Manchester on 6 October 1707 and baptized at Manchester parish church on 12 October 1707. He was educated at Manchester grammar school. He studied medicine in London under Richard Mead, and physics and mathematics under Isaac Newton, who is said to have considered Falkner his favourite pupil. 
After practising as a surgeon at home, Falkner joined a slave ship of the South Sea Company in Guinea, partly to improve his own health by a sea voyage, partly on behalf of the Royal Society, which was interested in the research of Jesuit doctors in American Indian herbal medicine. Having arrived in Buenos Aires on 7 May 1730, he headed for Chile with a caravan of slaves, through Santa Fe, Cordoba, and Mendoza, to Santiago de Chile. He returned to Buenos Aires, dangerously ill, and was treated by the Jesuit Sebastian de San Martin with such kindness that he became a Catholic and sought entry into the Society of Jesus. He became a Jesuit novice of the Paraguay province in May 1732, being ordained in 1739 and professed in 1749. Having published his treatise on Indian medicines for the Royal Society, he was sent to Santiago del Estero, Tucuman, Cordoba, and Santa Fe to further his research, and then joined an expedition to Patagonia. 
Although several of his manuscript scientific works are now lost, Falkner made an important contribution to introducing Enlightenment ideas into South America. In Cordoba he introduced experiments in the natural sciences and followed Christian Wolff (1679-1754) in his philosophy lectures, while in Paraguay he was looked upon as a Galenist. He spent thirty-eight years as a missionary, at first around Paraguay and in Tucuman, and then, from 1741 until 1753, working as a missionary and doctor in the southern Pampa, notably in the reduction of Our Lady of Concepcion. Here he assisted Father Matias Strobel in his mission to the Patagonian Indians. After an unsuccessful expedition to found a new reduction at Sierra de Volcan (Laguna de los Padres), near Mar del Plata, he returned to Buenos Aires to study Indian dialects. With Father Jose Cardiel in August 1746 he established the reduction of Our Lady of Pilar. Since he knew the country so well, he was appointed to accompany Strobel in 1748 on an expedition as far as the Rio Negro. The Jesuits realized that his medical skills would give him superiority over native witchdoctors. Like the Indians, Falkner lived on horseflesh, and for a plate used his hat, which became so greasy that it was devoured by wild dogs while he slept. In 1751 he took charge of 'estancias' in Santa Fe, but continued his scientific interests. He moved to the college of Cordoba in 1756, where he converted to Catholicism twenty British survivors from the man-of-war 'Lord Clive'. In 1758 he was probably the first to occupy the new chair of mathematics at Cordoba. 
In July 1767 the Jesuits were expelled from Cordoba, and Falkner returned to England via Cadiz and Sardinia. He joined the English province of the Society of Jesus about 1771, and after a period in Lancashire acted as chaplain to Robert Berkeley (1713-1804) at Spetchley Park, Worcester. There his vivid memoirs were tamed into the abridgement 'A Description of Patagonia' (1774), edited by William Combe with Berkeley's help, which Charles Darwin used while on board 'The Beagle'. He then became chaplain to the Beringtons at Winsley, Herefordshire, and the Plowdens at Plowden Hall, Shropshire. He died at Plowden Hall on 30 January 1784 and was buried at Lydbury North, Shropshire. Thomas Pennant, who met him at Spetchley and edited his book 'Of the Patagonians' (1788), remarked that his long involvement with the Patagonian Indians had made him lose all European guile and acquire the simplicity and honest impetuosity of that people.

Falkner, William (d. 1682), Church of England clergyman, was admitted sizar at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, on 20 December 1648, migrated to Peterhouse on 6 July 1650, and graduated BA in 1652-3. He became a fellow of Peterhouse in 1654 and proceeded MA in 1656. He was ordained deacon in Lincoln on 8 June 1661 and priest two days later. By 1662, when a son, Thomas, was buried, Falkner had married Susan (1639/40-1680), daughter of Thomas Greene, merchant, alderman, and mayor of King's Lynn. They had at least two sons and three daughters who died young and a son, William, who survived his parents. By October 1662 he was described as preacher of St Nicholas Chapel in Lynn. 
Falkner published 'Libertas ecclesiastica, or, A discourse, vindicating the lawfulness of those things, which are chiefly excepted against in the Church of England, especially in its liturgy and worship' (1674). As its full title suggests this work was an argument for religious uniformity. Falkner was committed to the national vocation of the Church of England. While he held the established church to be legitimated by God's word he also held that it was the role of the church to affirm royal supremacy. The church, therefore, had an important role in legitimating the crown, and he maintained that the church had to discharge this duty in order to secure blessing for the realm. Falkner sincerely desired that the prayer book should be an instrument of national unity through the weekly round of services, and held that nothing could be adduced that could 'hinder pious men from hearty joining therein, or yielding unfeigned assent thereto' (Falkner, 'Libertas ecclesiastica', 55). 
Richard Baxter was somewhat dismissive of Anglican claims that Falkner's text was unanswerable. He conceded Falkner to be 'a sober learned man' and 'indeed he speaketh plausibly to many of the nonconformists smallest exceptions'. Nevertheless, on a whole range of weightier matters Baxter found 'his defence is so poor and slight, as is fit to satisfy no judicious man, that is not prepared for error by interest and will' ('Reliquiae Baxterianae', pt 3, 108). 
In 1679 Falkner also published 'Christian Loyalty', a book apparently completed by mid-1678 and prompted by the parliamentary defeat of two bills in the 1677 session. It read as a tory alternative to exclusion, which aimed to impose limitations on the ecclesiastical power of a Catholic monarch, while at the same time enhancing the power and authority of the bishops. The succession would stand, but the church would be protected from the monarch by removing from the civil power all authority in spiritual matters. A popish prince would be expected to practise his religion privately while upholding the protestant church in public. Clearly Falkner's literary efforts gained the approval of the Anglican hierarchy and in 1679 he was appointed rector of Glemsford, Suffolk. He became a DD in 1680. 
Falkner died at King's Lynn on 9 April 1682. Several of his works were published posthumously, including 'Two Treatises', edited by William Sherlock in 1684, to which some sermons were added which detail Falkner's ideal for the Anglican clergy.

Falle, Philip (1656-1742), historian and Church of England clergyman, was born in St Saviour, Jersey, the son of Thomas Falle (1629-1673), farmer, centenier or parish constable of St Saviour from 1658 to 1660, and his wife, Marie Dumaresq (died before 1670). The eldest of four surviving brothers and half-brothers and two sisters descended from an old Jersey family, Falle was sent to England at an early age, and educated at a school kept by a Transylvanian in Great Queen Street in London and then by a Mr Dalgarno, probably George Dalgarno, in Oxford. Late in 1669 he was entered at Exeter College, Oxford, but he followed his tutor at Exeter, Narcissus Marsh, to St Alban's Hall on Marsh's becoming principal there in 1673. He proceeded MA from St Alban's Hall in 1676, and was ordained deacon by Bishop Ralph Brideoake of Chichester in 1677, and priest by Brideoake's successor, Dr Guy Carleton, in 1679. 
In 1681 Falle was presented to Trinity parish in Jersey by the governor, Sir John Lanier. The stipend was about $40 a year. Falle also inherited an estate from his father and served the religious needs of the island's garrison, then without a chaplain. In 1687 Lord Jermyn, Lanier's successor, took Falle back to England with him as tutor for his only son. Falle lived at Rusbrook, Suffolk, Jermyn's country seat, until he returned to Jersey in 1689. In 1690 he received the appointment of St Saviour's. 
As a clergyman Falle was a member of the states of Jersey, where he played an active role. A zealous English patriot and francophobe, he was an obvious choice for the delegation sent by the states to beg assistance of William III against French raiders in 1692. He may have drafted the address as well. Falle and Nicholas Durrell, the advocate-general of Jersey, introduced by Jermyn, waited on William at Kensington on 6 February 1693 and also called upon government officials to press their case, succeeding in gaining more military supplies for Jersey. Falle was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to the king in 1694, and in that capacity preached a sermon on 20 December on Queen Mary's death. He eventually settled in England, and his Jersey parishioners were served by a series of curates. He received a stall at Durham Cathedral in January 1700 and a living at Shenley, near St Albans, in 1709, upon which he resigned his living in Jersey. 
During his mission in 1692 and 1693, Falle was struck by the ignorance of Jersey shown by the English people he met at the court and in London. Determining to make the island, and what he considered to be its fierce loyalty to the English crown, better known to public opinion, he wrote his most significant work, 'An account of the Isle of Jersey, the greatest of the islands that are now the only remainder of the English dominions in France, with a new and accurate map of that island'. It appeared in two editions during his life, in 1694, dedicated to William, then greatly expanded with a substantial documentary appendix in 1734. It was based on materials collected by Falle's friend and parishioner the Jersey magistrate John Poingdestre and also benefited from contributions by Phillip Dumaresq, including the map. The 1734 edition included a letter from Falle's friend Philip Morant refuting the argument of John Selden's 'Mare clausus' (1635) that the Channel Islands had always been an English possession. 'An account of the Isle of Jersey' was strongly providentialist, emphasizing how God had defended Jersey from the French and in latter years from Catholicism. Falle also argued that Jersey and the Channel Islands generally were great economic and military assets to England in its struggle with France. Although undistinguished in style and marred by credulity, Falle's work, which included discussion of the island's institutions and natural history, was the first and for a long time the standard work on Jersey, reprinted as late as 1837. Falle contributed an account of the Channel Islands to Edmund Gibson's edition of William Camden's 'Britannia' in 1722, and published several sermons, including one in Jersaise, mostly during the reign of William III. He also saw through the press 'The History of the Last Campagne in the Spanish Netherlands, anno. Dom. 1693' (1693) by his friend and fellow Jerseyman the Revd Edward Dauvergne, contributing a fulsome letter of dedication to the duke of Ormond. 
Falle travelled to France, and to the United Provinces as one of William's chaplains. On the continent he collected many printed music books. His music manuscripts included the only surviving works of Sainte-Colombe the younger, the French violist resident in Britain, of whom he may have been a student. Falle donated his printed music books, 266 items with substantial representation of music published in Antwerp, Amsterdam, and Venice, and his musical manuscripts, together with his catalogue, to the library of the dean and chapter of Durham. His other books he presented to the people of Jersey in 1736 together with money to build a library, although it was not built until 1742. Along with other donations, they have developed into the Jersey Library in St Helier. 
Falle never married. His will reveals that he maintained a household in Durham, supervised by 'my agent and steward there... Mrs Elizabeth Robinson, wife of Mr Michael Robinson', who had 'been faithfull and diligent in my Business during many years', but that he lived at Shenley with his niece Judith Aubin (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/719, fols. 230'r'-232'r'). He died at Shenley on 7 May 1742 and was buried on 12 May at St Botolph's, Shenley.

Fallows, Fearon (1788-1831), astronomer, was born in Cockermouth, Cumberland, on 4 July 1788, the son of John Fallows, a hand-loom weaver of sufficient education to act as clerk in the neighbouring parish of Bridekirk. Although he was brought up to his father's trade, he was a keen student of mathematics. With the help of the Revd H. A. Hervey, vicar of Bridekirk, he became assistant to the headmaster of Plumbland School. Supported by an anonymous patron, in October 1809 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, whence he graduated as third wrangler in the mathematical tripos, after John Herschel and George Peacock. He held a mathematical lectureship at Corpus Christi College for two years, and was then elected a fellow of St John's. He was ordained deacon in 1815 and priest in 1819, and was elected to the Royal Society in June 1820. In 1821 he married Mary Anne Hervey, the eldest daughter of the vicar. The fellows of the newly founded Astronomical Society had lobbied extensively in influential quarters for an observatory in the southern hemisphere, and as a result an order in council of George IV was issued on 20 October 1820 directing the establishment of an astronomical observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. 
Although his experience of practical astronomy was rather slight, Fallows was appointed astronomer by the board of longitude, largely on an enthusiastic recommendation by Sir John Herschel. Fallows consulted with John Rennie, who, as his last work, had designed the observatory building on the lines of that at Cambridge -- that is, two residences with flat roofs for telescope domes joined by a central section devoted to meridian instruments. Fallows and his wife embarked on the 360 ton 'Sappho' on 4 May 1821, accompanied by his assistant James Fayrer, the son of a London instrument maker. The ship docked at the naval base at Simonstown, where Fallows to his dismay found no funds available to have his instruments transported to Cape Town. They eventually came round the peninsula by sea at his own expense before being stored in the town granary. From a lodging in town Fallows made positional observations of 273 southern stars, the first such since those of Lacaille seventy years before, which were published by the Royal Society in 1824. After several expeditions to explore the area, Fallows chose for the permanent observatory a site between the Liesbeeck and Black rivers near their confluence, about 3 miles from the town, but there were long delays before construction could commence in 1825. 
Meanwhile Fallows's assistant Fayrer had been dismissed for drunkenness, and a replacement, the (Catholic) Revd Patrick Scully, was fired for sexual misconduct. Nevertheless Fallows had happily participated in many aspects of colonial life, including acting as chaplain to the forces. As a fellow of the Royal Society he took an active part in local scientific and intellectual activity, and later arranged to conduct divine service in one of the observatory rooms. He personally supervised excavation of the foundations for a building constructed according to a rather amateurish scheme of his own, but fortunately a professional clerk of works, John Skirrow, arrived in February to build it in local stone. An unexpected cargo of Burmese teak provided material for the roof, shutters, and internal joinery. The roof was finished in lead. A professional assistant, Captain William Ronald, arrived on 19 November 1826; although appointed two years previously, he had been kept in London to inspect the principal meridian instruments of the observatory and to accompany them to South Africa. The instrument cases were somewhat roughly handled during landing at the wharf and damage was feared. Fallows always praised the transit circle used to determine right ascensions, but the mural circle, used for declinations, proved erratic, a failing due not to damage, but, as was found many years later, to a defect of construction. Fallows was an assiduous observer; he constructed necessary features such as meridian pillars for the adjustment of these instruments, provided primitive time signals for ships in Table Bay by the discharge of a pistol on the roof at settled times, and made regular observations of stars, sun, moon, and planets, most of which were published by his successors. 
Fallows himself published in 1830 measurements of the local acceleration of gravity from pendulum observations. Ronald took sick leave in October 1830 and left for England, to be replaced by a young clerk, James Robertson, but Fallows had to call on his wife for astronomical assistance. Skirrow departed for a colonial post, but supervised the installation of the roof domes -- never to be occupied in Fallows's time. Worn out by overwork and relentless official parsimony, Fallows fell ill with scarlet fever and, in spite of a recuperative visit to Simonstown, died at the observatory on 25 July 1831. He was buried there, in front of the main building, at his own request, 12 feet deep under a slab of Robben Island stone. Mrs Fallows, with whom he had only one son, who died young, returned to England with all his papers and unpublished observations, which she handed over to the Admiralty.

Fancourt, Samuel (1678-1768), librarian and Presbyterian minister, was born at Oakham, Rutland, one of the four boys and two girls of Richard Fancourt, a prosperous merchant, and Anne Tresham. He was educated at the dissenting academy in Hungerford, Berkshire, under Benjamin Robinson and was ordained minister on 24 May 1709. He had married Martha Clempson on 5 August 1706 in Hungerford and remained there until 1715 or 1716, when he moved to become minister of Wilton, 3 miles west of Salisbury. In 1721 he moved to Salisbury and settled in the Dolphin Chequer, but subsequently moved to Salt Lane, where he lived from 1723 to 1742. 
In 1735 Fancourt 'contrived a Circulating Library for the Entertainment of distant as well as home Subscribers' (Fancourt, 4). This was an innovative but over-ambitious venture which aimed to supply a wide range of books and pamphlets for a fee of a half-guinea a year, plus 5's'. for delivery, within a 60 miles radius of Salisbury. In late 1741 or early 1742 he issued a catalogue advertising books in English and French of his New Circulary Library at Salisbury, but the library proved uneconomical: 'at Salisbury they would yield nothing', as he later described it (ibid., 5). He and his wife moved their possessions and a 5000 volume circulating library on wagons to London and settled at 6 Crane Court, off Fleet Street, in late 1742. From here he recommenced his business as the First Universal Circulating Library, which was succeeded by the Second Universal Circulating Library (1745-50), and finally the Associated Circulating Library (1750- 'c'.1760). From 1746 to 1748 he issued in parts a comprehensive two-volume library catalogue, which listed the books, in English, French, and Latin, alphabetically and included a subject index. 
Fancourt's home was adjacent to the Royal Society, and while this proximity was good for business it brought him into direct conflict with the powerful secretary to the society, Dr Cromwell Mortimer. A physician notorious for charging high fees, he had treated Martha Fancourt and published an account of her illness with his 'Address to the public: containing narratives of the effects of certain chemical remedies in most diseases' in 1745. This, coupled with Mortimer's interference in Fancourt's library, caused great difficulties in his library until Mortimer's death in 1752. As a fellow Presbyterian, Mortimer was one of several fellows of the Royal Society who were included in the original deed of trust of the library, yet he soon meddled in the library's affairs by criticizing Fancourt's management and by using his considerable influence for negative purposes, which made a business that was of doubtful viability even more precarious. In 1760 Fancourt and his wife retired to Hoxton Square, Shoreditch, London -- a pleasant area popular with dissenters and home to a dissenting academy, the Hoxton Independent Academy -- and he died there on 8 June 1768. He was buried in Bunhill Fields. 
Fancourt was a resolute, innovative librarian who provided 'the link between the Clerical Subscription Libraries of the 17th and 18th centuries and the secular subscription libraries and book clubs of later times' (Kelly, 146). A tenacious theologian and author of eighteen books and pamphlets published between 1720 and 1745, Fancourt debated such complex theological questions as 'the Doctrine of Reprobation', 'Divine Prescience', and the 'Freedom of Will' both within the Presbyterian church and outside. These doctrinal debates were described as 'swelling into so many Volumes that no Head can compass it' and brought him into conflict with Bishop Benjamin Hoadly of Salisbury. It was librarianship, however, that became his primary vocation, and he devised schemes for the delivery of library services both in Salisbury and in London and produced library catalogues that were far ahead of his time and not bettered until the following century.

Fane, Sir Edmund Douglas Veitch (1837-1900), diplomatist, was the eldest son of Arthur Fane (died 1872) of Boyton, Codford, Wiltshire, prebendary of Salisbury, and his wife, Lucy, daughter of J. Benett of Peyt House, Wiltshire. He matriculated from Merton College, Oxford, on 28 May 1855, but did not graduate, entered the diplomatic service and lived the life of a competent but undistinguished diplomatist. He was appointed attache at Tehran in 1858. In 1863 he was transferred to Turin, and from Turin to St Petersburg in 1866 as second secretary. During 1867-78 his employment was extremely varied, involving brief sojourns at Washington, Florence, Munich, Brussels, Vienna, and Bern. He was secretary of legation at Copenhagen (1879-81); secretary of embassy at Madrid (1881-5), Brussels (March-December 1885), and Constantinople (1886-93); and minister at Belgrade (1893-8) and at Copenhagen once more (1898-1900). He negotiated the treaty of commerce with Serbia of 10 July 1893. In 1897 he received the jubilee medal, and in 1899 was created KCMG. He was lord of the manor of Boyton, Wiltshire, and a deputy lieutenant and justice of the peace for the county. He married, in 1875, Constantia Eleanor, daughter of General R. Blucher Wood. He died on 20 March 1900 at Copenhagen, his wife surviving him.

Francis Fane, first earl of Westmorland (1583/4-1629), was a landowner. His wardship and marriage were granted to Roger Manners on 5 May 1592. He was educated at Maidstone grammar school, attended Queens' College, Cambridge, about 1595, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1597. In 1599 Fane married Mary (1581/2-1640), heir of Sir Anthony Mildmay of Apethorpe in Northamptonshire and Grace Mildmay, daughter and coheir of Henry Sharington of Lacock in Wiltshire. They had seven sons and six daughters, including Mildmay Fane, who succeeded his father, and Lady Rachael Fane. Francis Fane was MP for Kent in 1601, Maidstone in 1604, 1614, and 1621, and Peterborough, Lincolnshire, in 1624. He was created KB at James I's coronation on 15 July 1603, and first Baron Burghersh and first earl of Westmorland on 29 December 1624. On the death of his mother in 1626 he also became Baron Le Despencer. He died on 23 March 1629, aged forty-five, at Apethorpe and was buried there.

Fane, Sir Francis (d. 1691), playwright, was the eldest son of Sir Francis Fane (died 1680), of Fulbeck, Lincolnshire, and Elizabeth, widow of John Darcy and daughter of William West, of Firbeck, Yorkshire. He was the grandson of Mildmay Fane, second earl of Westmorland. At the coronation of Charles II he was created a knight of the Bath. In 1661 he and Sir Henry (possibly his brother) petitioned the king, asking to be confirmed to 'the rank of grandsons of earls, in which at the coronation they were placed before baronets' ('CSP dom.', '1660-61', 603). About the time of his marriage on 16 February 1664 to Hannah, daughter of John Rushworth (c.1612-1690), Fane and other adventurers acquired an interest in the draining of the Eight Hundred Fen, near Boston, Lincolnshire. In a series of letters (now in the Clayton MSS, Yale University) sent to Sir Robert Clayton, sheriff of London, between February 1672 and November 1674, Fane requested Clayton's financial support in some commercial transactions, including the sale of Firbeck Manor, Yorkshire. According to an undated memorandum, having incurred heavy debts, Fane expected parliament to pass an act allowing him to sell the manor, which at the time of his marriage had been settled on his wife Hannah and the couple's male children. The sole executor of his father's will, dated 7 June 1679, Fane inherited the sum of $1800, evidently the lion's share of the legacy. 
Fane was the author of 'Love in the Dark' (1675), a comedy performed (possibly for the first time) at the Theatre Royal on 10 May 1675, and 'The Sacrifice', a tragedy printed in 1686 but never acted. In the dedication of the latter play to the earl of Dorset the author confessed to 'having long since devoted himself to a country life, and wanting patience to attend the leisure of the stage' ('DNB'). Styling 'Love in the Dark' 'the struglings of his Maiden Pen' (Danchin, 1.661), Fane dedicated the play in adulatory terms to the earl of Rochester, who had composed an epilogue for the 1675 performance and whose 'most charming and instructive conversation' had made Fane 'not only a better Poet, a better Philosopher; but much more than those, a better Christian' (Farley-Hills, 37). Apart from writing a hyperbolic poem on the earl's sickness, Fane also contributed a masque to Rochester's 'Valentinian' (1685), an adaptation of Fletcher's tragedy, first published in 1647. Both the poem and the masque were included in Nahum Tate's 'Poems by Several Hands' (1685). An elegy 'On the Death of the Earl of Rochester', printed anonymously in 1684, is also attributed to Fane (Bodl. Oxf., MS Firth c 15). 'The Sacrifice' was eulogized by Aphra Behn and Tate, who praised Fane for tempering 'Shakespear's Flame with Johnson's Art' (Todd, 1.425). 
Gerard Langbaine, in his 'Account of the English Dramatick Poets', published in Easter term 1691, recorded that Fane was living at Fulbeck Hall. However, he died in Henbury, Gloucestershire, on 8 April 1691. In his will, dated 14 November 1689, Fane left various sums of money to the poor of several Gloucestershire parishes and provided for the payment of outstanding debts, including $6 owed to Sir Thomas Skipwith, probably the theatre manager at Drury Lane and Dorset Garden. As appears from the probate to his will, dated 15 September 1691, his widow who had been made the sole executrix, expressly resigned her commission in favour of the eldest son, another Sir Francis.

Fane, Francis William Henry, twelfth earl of Westmorland (1825-1891), army officer, born in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 19 November 1825, was the fourth but eldest surviving son of John Fane, eleventh earl of Westmorland (1784-1859), and his wife, Lady Priscilla Anne Wellesley-Pole ['see 'Fane, Priscilla Anne], daughter of William Wellesley-Pole, third earl of Mornington. He was educated at Westminster School (from 18 September 1837) and at Sandhurst. He was gazetted ensign into the 74th regiment on 24 February 1843 and lieutenant on 26 July 1844, and served in the Punjab campaign of 1846. On 1 August 1848 he was promoted captain and made aide-de-camp to Viscount Hardinge, the governor-general of India. He served under Lord Gough, received a medal for bravery at the battle of Gujrat on 21 February 1849, and obtained his majority on 7 June. After the war he returned to England and exchanged into the Coldstream Guards. On the outbreak of the Crimean War he went out as aide-de-camp to Lord Raglan (his uncle by marriage), and was present at the Alma (20 September 1854), bringing home Raglan's dispatches. He was appointed brevet lieutenant-colonel on the day of the battle, and lieutenant-colonel on 12 December 1854. He was present at Raglan's death. Made CB on 10 July 1855 and knight of the Legion d'honneur on 30 April 1857, he received the Mejidiye (fifth class) on 2 March 1858, and in 1856 became aide-de-camp to the duke of Cambridge. 
Since the death of his elder brother in 1851 Fane had been styled Lord Burghersh, and on 16 October 1859 he succeeded his father as twelfth earl of Westmorland. He retired from the army in 1860 with the rank of colonel, and devoted himself to the turf. He won many victories in the handicaps, but never in any of the great races for three-year-olds. Eventually, unsuccessful betting compelled him to give up racing on his own account, but for some time he looked after the eighth duke of Devonshire's horses. Lord Westmorland died at 34 Brook Street on 3 August 1891, and was buried on the 5th at Apethorpe, Northamptonshire, his principal seat. He had married at St George's, Hanover Square, on 16 July 1857, Lady Adelaide Ida Curzon (1835-1903), second daughter of Richard William Curzon, first Earl Howe. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, Anthony Mildmay Julian.

Fane, Sir Henry (1778-1840), army officer, was the eldest son of the Hon. Henry Fane (1739-1802) of Fulbeck, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Edward Buckley Batson, London banker, of Avon Tyrrell, Hampshire. Henry Fane senior, who was MP for Lyme Regis from 1772 to 1802, and 'keeper of the king's private roads, gates, and bridges, and conductor or guide of the king's person in all royal progresses' from 1772 until his death, was the second son of Thomas, eighth earl of Westmorland. Fane was born on 26 November 1778, educated at Eton College (1791), and entered the army as a cornet in the 6th dragoon guards (Carabiniers) on 31 May 1792. He was promoted lieutenant into the 55th regiment on 29 September 1792, and captain on 3 April 1793, and he exchanged with that rank into the 4th dragoon guards on 31 August 1793. In 1793 and 1794 he served as aide-de-camp to his uncle the tenth earl of Westmorland when the earl was viceroy of Ireland. In his early life Fane's career was promoted by Westmorland. 
When Westmorland retired Fane returned to his regiment. He was promoted major on 24 August 1795, and lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1797. In 1802 he duly succeeded his father as MP for Lyme Regis, then a close (freeman) borough controlled by the Westmorland family. He gave general support to all administrations except Grenville's. He received the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 1st (King's) dragoon guards on 25 December 1804, and on 1 January 1805 was appointed aide-de-camp to the king with the rank of colonel. Though Fane had up to this time seen no active service, he was nevertheless directed to join the staff of Major-General Sir Arthur Wellesley at Cork in June 1808, with the rank of brigadier-general. When the expedition landed at the mouth of the Mondego, Fane, as the youngest and most active of the British generals, received the command of the light brigade, consisting of the 50th regiment and the light companies of all the other regiments attached to the expedition. He led the advance, and at the battle of Rolica he first maintained the connection of the centre with General Ferguson, and then successfully turned General Laborde's right with his light troops by advancing along a mountain road in conjunction with Ferguson's brigade. This operation determined the French to retreat. At the battle of Vimeiro his brigade, with that of Brigadier-General Robert Anstruther, held the village church and churchyard against the first three furious onslaughts of Junot's troops. After the convention of Cintra, Fane was transferred by Sir John Moore to command the 2nd infantry brigade in Mackenzie Fraser's division, consisting of the 38th, 82nd, and 79th regiments, and with this brigade he served in Moore's advance into Spain, in his famous retreat, and in the battle of Corunna. 
On Fane's return to England he received the thanks of parliament in his place in the House of Commons, where he still sat for Lyme Regis, and he eagerly pressed to be again actively employed. In the spring of 1809 he was again ordered to the Peninsula, with the rank of brigadier-general. He was placed, as an old cavalry officer, in command of one of Wellesley's three cavalry brigades, consisting of the 3rd dragoon guards and the 4th dragoons. This brigade, as it consisted of heavy cavalry, took no such distinguished part in the battle of Talavera as General George Anson's light brigade, but it did good service throughout the campaigns of 1809 and 1810. On 25 July 1810 Fane was promoted major-general, and as the second cavalry general in order of seniority he was in 1811 detached from the main army to command the cavalry with Sir Rowland Hill's corps in the Alemtejo, which consisted of the 13th light dragoons and four regiments of Portuguese dragoons. With this command he covered Hill's operations, and accompanied his corps to the main army, which it reached in time to be present at the battle of Busaco, where, however, none of the cavalry were engaged. In the subsequent retreat to the lines of Torres Vedras the cavalry under Sir Stapleton Cotton and Fane were most valuable, but the strain of this difficult campaign was too much for Fane's health, and he was invalided home. 
Fane thus missed the important battles of 1812, but in 1813, to the satisfaction of both Wellington and Hill, Fane rejoined the army in the Peninsula. He was again appointed to command all the cavalry attached to Hill's corps, namely, a brigade of British cavalry, consisting of the 3rd dragoon guards, 1st dragoons (the Royals), and the 13th light dragoons, one regiment of Portuguese dragoons, and Bean's troop of Royal Horse Artillery. With this command he headed the advance of the right of the British army from their winter quarters at Frenada, defeated the French general Villatte in a cavalry engagement on 26 May -- which secured the safe passage of the fords of the Tormes -- and was present at the battle of Vitoria. During the winter campaign of 1813-14 the cavalry was hardly employed at all, but when Wellington decided to invade France, Fane once more took his place in front of Hill's corps on the right of the army. He was engaged in innumerable small skirmishes during the advance, and distinguished himself in the charges of the British cavalry which completed the rout of Soult's army at Orthez. He then once more took his place in front of Hill's column, and was present, though not actively employed, at the final battle of Toulouse. 
On the conclusion of peace Fane succeeded Cotton as commander of all the British cavalry on the continent, and conducted them safely right across France to Calais. During these long and varied campaigns Fane had won the reputation of being, next to Cotton, the best commander of cavalry in the army. On 13 July 1814 he was made colonel of the 23rd light dragoons, from which he was transferred on 3 August to the colonelcy of his old regiment, the 4th (Royal Irish) dragoon guards. He received a gold cross with one clasp for the battles of Vimeiro, Corunna, Talavera, Vitoria, and Orthez, in which he had been actively engaged, on 26 July 1814 he received the thanks of parliament in his place in the House of Commons (his reply was the only time he spoke in the house), he was made one of the first KCBs (June 1815) on the extension of the Order of the Bath, and he was appointed inspector-general of cavalry for Great Britain. 
In 1815 Fane prepared the cavalry regiments which were employed at the battle of Waterloo, though he was not himself present in that campaign. In 1816 he was appointed to a special command in the midlands to put down riots. In 1817 he was made a local lieutenant-general for the continent, and appointed to command all the cavalry and horse artillery in the army of occupation in France, a post he held until the complete evacuation of that country in 1818. In the same year he resigned his seat in the House of Commons to make way for his brother Vere at Lyme, and retired to Fulbeck, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, a country seat which he had inherited on his father's death in 1802. Fane lived for many years with Mrs Isabella Cooke ('nee' Gorges) from Dublin, whose husband was apparently still alive but who called herself Fane. She and Fane may have been 'privately married' ('GM'), presumably illegally; they had two sons and a daughter, Isabella ['see below']. 
Fane lived in retirement for some years, but in due course was promoted lieutenant-general (12 August 1819), made a GCB (January 1826), and appointed colonel of the 1st (King's) dragoon guards (24 February 1827). In 1829 Wellington induced Fane to accept the office of surveyor-general of the ordnance. He re-entered the House of Commons as MP for the Admiralty-influenced freeman borough of Sandwich, and from 1830 to 1831 was MP for the Treasury (freeman) borough of Hastings. He left office when Grey's reform cabinet was formed, but continued on intimate terms with Wellington, who during his short tenure of office in 1835 appointed Fane commander-in-chief in India. Lord Melbourne's cabinet confirmed the appointment, and Fane took over the command-in-chief from Lord William Bentinck -- the last governor-general who was also commander-in-chief -- in September 1835, when he found India in a state of profound peace. Fane personally inspected every station in his command in 1836, and an interesting account of this tour of inspection, and of his interview with Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Punjab, was published by his nephew and aide-de-camp Henry Edward Fane. Towards the end of Fane's period of command there were signs of war on the north-west frontier, and in 1838 he got ready an army to proceed to the relief of Herat, then besieged by the Persians, and Lord Auckland and his advisers then began to mature the plans which brought about the First Anglo-Afghan War. 
The 'army of the Indus', as organized by Fane, comprised two divisions from the Bengal army and a contingent from the Bombay army. However, the Persians withdrew from Herat and the army was reduced by one division. Fane then gave up the command and applied to retire as commander-in-chief; he was in very poor health. He handed over the army of the Indus to Major-General Sir John Keane, commander-in-chief of the Bombay army, in January 1839. He was later replaced as commander-in-chief East Indies by Major-General Sir Jasper Nicolls, commander-in-chief of the Madras army. Fane left India in the last stage of weakness, and died at sea on board the 'Malabar' off St Michael in the Azores, aged sixty-one, on 24 March 1840. He requested burial at his country seat, Fulbeck, in Lincolnshire.

Fane, John, seventh earl of Westmorland (bap. 1686, d. 1762), army officer and politician, was baptized on 24 March 1686 at Mereworth, Kent, the fourth son of Vere Fane, fourth earl of Westmorland (1645-1693), and his wife, Rachel (1653-1711), the daughter and heir of John Bence, an alderman of London. He was educated at Eton College (1698), Lincoln's Inn (1703), and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a fellow commoner in March 1704 and matriculated in the same year. In March 1709 he was appointed captain in Cadogan's regiment of horse (5th dragoon guards), with whom he fought at Malplaquet and subsequent campaigns in Flanders; he left the regiment in 1714. It has been suggested that he was made lieutenant-colonel in 1710, possibly later, but this is not confirmed by army commission registers. In 1715 he succeeded to the colonelcy of the 37th regiment of foot (North Hampshire regiment), who were brought over from Ireland and stationed at Chester during the rising of 1715. Fane was involved in a series of quarrels with local ordnance officials and magistrates over billeting and supplies. His arbitrary action in imprisoning them in Chester Castle provoked George I's displeasure and he was ordered to London and confined to his room on arrest. However, he was allowed to return to the command of his regiment, who remained garrisoned in Chester until early 1717. On 16 August 1716 he married Mary (1700-1778), the only daughter and heir of Lord Henry Cavendish, the second son of the first duke of Devonshire. In December 1717 he transferred to the colonelcy of the 1st troop of Horse Grenadier Guards. As a peacetime officer in Hanoverian England, Fane found his career prospects dependent on his political support for Walpole and the whigs -- a role which, as time went by, he was increasingly unable to fulfil. 
In 1708 Fane entered the House of Commons, as a whig, for Hythe, but in 1710 he lost his seat on petition. He succeeded his brother Mildmay as knight for the shire of Kent at a by-election upon the latter's death in 1715. The following year he voted against the 'Septennial Bill'. He withdrew from the election in 1722 but was returned for Buckingham in 1727, when his friend Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, brought him in at a by-election. When Cobham was dismissed from the army in 1733 for opposing the 'Excise Bill' (a measure which Fane supported), Fane was granted the colonelcy of the 1st troop of Life Guards -- the result of the vacancy created by Lord Pembroke's appointment to Cobham's regiment. In addition, on 4 October 1733 he was created a peer of Ireland, as Baron Catherlough. This marked a high point, for in 1734 he greatly displeased the king and Walpole by supporting a motion to prevent the dismissal of army officers on political grounds (his conscience no doubt pricked by his advance by the misfortune of his friend Cobham). At the general election of that year Walpole prevented his standing for one of the Cinque Ports, previously promised by the duke of Dorset. 
Upon his succession to the earldom of Westmorland in 1736 Fane became a tory in the House of Lords. His speaking and voting for an increase in the prince of Wales's allowance resulted in his dismissal from the army in June 1737 without compensation, and he lost the $6500 he paid for the colonelcy in 1717. Now a confirmed enemy of Walpole, Westmorland was reinstated in the army only after Walpole's fall. Having been made brigadier-general in November 1735, in 1742 he was appointed major-general, antedated to 1735, and lieutenant-general, antedated to 1739. However, he was not granted a regiment or compensated for his financial loss, a source of continual resentment towards the Hanoverian regime which led him towards Jacobitism. In 1743 he was privy to the negotiations with France which resulted in the rising of 1745, and he continued to play a leading role within English Jacobite circles during the late 1740s and early 1750s. However, he combined his Jacobitism with service to Frederick, prince of Wales. In 1747 he and his nephew Sir Francis Dashwood ['see 'Dashwood, Francis, eleventh Baron Le Despencer] were Frederick's principal representatives in negotiations to form a broad-based opposition. In September 1750 he met the Young Pretender, Charles Edward, in London. However, by the mid-1750s English Jacobitism had disintegrated and Westmorland was already exclusively following a pro-Hanoverian opposition path. He was one of the peers who volunteered to subsidize Frederick's journal 'The Remembrancer' after the latter's death in 1751. In 1761 Westmorland attended George III's coronation and was made general of horse. 
Before his accession to the earldom in 1736 Westmorland devoted much energy and money to improvements in his seat, Mereworth Castle in Kent. In 1720 he commissioned Colen Campbell (1676-1729), the architectural designer and chief propagandist of the Palladian movement in British architecture, to rebuild the family seat. The resulting building, which was roofed in 1723 with an impressive lead dome and finally completed in 1725, was the closest of the English reproductions of Palladio's Villa Rotunda at Vicenza and, according to Pevsner, remains one of the major achievements of Palladianism in the county. In 1737 Westmorland was made lord lieutenant of Northamptonshire and warden of the east bailliwick of the forest of Rockingham; he became master forester in 1739. In 1754 he was appointed lord high steward and in 1759 chancellor of the University of Oxford, his installation being conducted with unusual magnificence. Westmorland died, childless, from a stroke of the palsy on 26 August 1762 and was buried at Mereworth on 2 September. His widow, Mary, died on 29 July 1778 at Hammersmith. 
Westmorland was succeeded as eighth earl by Thomas Fane ('b'. 8 March 1701), a Bristol merchant, barrister, and MP for Lyme Regis (1753-62), the great-grandson of Sir Francis Fane and great-great-grandson of Francis, first earl of Westmorland. The eighth earl died on 25 November 1771 and was succeeded as ninth earl by his son

Fane, John, tenth earl of Westmorland (1759-1841), politician, was born in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 1 January 1759, the eldest son of John Fane, ninth earl of Westmorland (1728-1774), landowner ['see under 'Fane, John, seventh earl of Westmorland], and his wife, Augusta (died 1766), daughter of Lord Montagu Bertie. He was educated at Westminster School (1770-71) and Charterhouse School (1771-5). He entered the Middle Temple in 1772, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1776; he proceeded MA in 1778. Previously styled Lord Burghersh, he succeeded to the earldom in 1774. He was a captain in the Northamptonshire militia in 1778, and on 31 October 1780 moved the address in the Lords, where he took part in debate that session. In 1782 he eloped with Sarah Anne (1764-1793), only child and heir of Robert Child of Osterley Park, Middlesex, the London banker, and his wife, Sarah Jodrell; they married at Gretna Green on 20 May, and in Apethorpe Church in Northamptonshire on 7 June. Of their six children, one son, John Fane, and three daughters survived. The bulk of the Child property was left to their daughter Sarah Sophia, who married the fifth earl of Jersey ['see 'Villiers, Sarah Sophia Child-]. 
While at Cambridge Westmorland had formed a friendship with William Pitt, which was later resumed in parliament. From Pitt he accepted the office of joint postmaster-general on 19 September 1789. He was sworn a member of the privy council on 14 October 1789, when he accepted appointment as lord lieutenant of Ireland, where he arrived in January 1790; he held office until he was replaced in December 1794. He was opposed to the emancipation of the Catholics, and was reluctant, in the face of Irish protestant alarm, to allow the makeshift relief measure of 1793, but did so to calm popular agitation and to promote Irish defence against the French menace. He was recalled when Pitt determined to make further concessions to Catholic demands. Westmorland had received an LLD from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1790, and became a knight of the Garter on 12 June 1793. On his return from Ireland he was offered the post of master of the horse, which he retained until 1798 when he became lord privy seal with a cabinet seat. Speaking regularly in the Lords in defence of government, he remained in office for nearly thirty years, except in 1806-7 when he opposed the whig ministry. He finally resigned in 1827 when Lord Liverpool's administration ended. He declined office under Wellington, and after the 'Reform Act', which he opposed adamantly, his political activity tailed off. Lord lieutenant of Northamptonshire from 1828, he was hereditary recorder of Lyme Regis, his family's pocket borough. 
Westmorland's second marriage, on 24 March 1800, to Jane (1779/80-1857), daughter and coheir of Richard Huck Saunders, physician, and Jane Kinsey, produced three sons and two daughters before they parted company, about 1811. According to Lady Holland, who abhorred his politics, Westmorland was 'coarse in mind, manners and language' ('Journal', 2.14), and had sought to confine his wife to spare the expense of separate maintenance. His admirer Mrs Arbuthnot commended him for being 'as active as any man of 25' on his sixty-second birthday ('Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot', 1.61). Latterly blind, Westmorland died of atrophy on 15 December 1841 at 83 Marine Parade in Brighton. He was buried on 27 December at Apethorpe.

Fane, John, eleventh earl of Westmorland (1784-1859), diplomatist and composer, was born on 2 or 3 February 1784 at 4 Sackville Street, Piccadilly, London, the only son of John Fane, tenth earl of Westmorland (1759-1841), and his first wife, Sarah Anne, 'nee' Child (1764-1793). He was known as Lord Burghersh until succeeding his father as eleventh earl in December 1841. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his MA in 1808. In 1806 he was returned as MP for Lyme Regis on his family interest, and he retained the seat until his resignation in 1816. He demonstrated few political convictions, and generally voted in support of the government, of which his father was a member. His attempt in 1832 to regain the seat as a tory was unsuccessful. In June 1811 he married Lady Priscilla Anne Wellesley-Pole (1793-1879), daughter of the third earl of Mornington ['see 'Fane, Priscilla Anne]; her uncles were to become the Marquess Wellesley and the duke of Wellington. 
Burghersh's first career was as a soldier. He became a lieutenant in the Northamptonshire militia in 1803, but soon joined the 11th foot as an ensign. He served in several regiments before being appointed aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General George Don in the expedition to Hanover. In 1806-7 he served in Sicily and Egypt as assistant adjutant-general, and took part in the two attacks on Rosetta. In 1808 he joined the army in Portugal, where he took part in the battles of Rolica and Vimeiro, and the following year he was aide-de-camp to Sir Arthur Wellesley (later duke of Wellington); he served at the battles of Talavera and Busaco, and in the retreat to Torres Vedras. An attempt by his father to secure Burghersh's rapid promotion through the use of his influence and contrary to regulations was foiled by a motion in the House of Commons in May 1809. In 1813 he was accredited military commissioner to the headquarters of the allied armies in Europe, and he was present during the 1814 campaign in France until the capture of Paris. He was promoted major-general in 1838, and general in 1854. He published two volumes of memoirs of the campaigns in which he had been involved. 
In August 1814 Burghersh took up a diplomatic career and went to Florence as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary; he remained in Italy until 1830, serving in the same capacity at Parma, Lucca, and Modena from 1818. In 1815 he took part in the campaign against Naples, and was one of the signatories to the convention of Caza Lanza, which restored the kingdom of Naples to the Bourbons. His appointment as envoy-extraordinary to Naples in 1830 was revoked, and his diplomatic career languished during the whig ministries of the 1830s. On the formation of the Conservative government in 1841, he was appointed minister at Berlin, to the chagrin of the previous incumbent, Lord William Russell, who called him 'that great fool', and recorded, perhaps with truth, that 'Lady Burghersh made the Duke of Wellington ask for Berlin for Burghersh, he being ruined and in immediate want of money' (Blakiston, 454). Burghersh none the less retained his office in Berlin for a decade, during which time he acted as a mediator in the Schleswig-Holstein question, and was a signatory to the peace treaty of 1850. In 1851 he was sent as ambassador to Vienna, where his time was principally occupied with negotiations concerning the imminent Crimean War, but he did not enjoy much confidence from his own government: Lord Clarendon called him 'our faithful but feeble Westmorland' (Conacher, 193). He participated, with Lord John Russell, in the Congress of Vienna of 1855, and retired from the diplomatic service on a pension in November of that year. His final public duty was to convey the queen's official congratulations to her uncle Leopold of the Belgians on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his succession. 
Westmorland was one of the most influential amateur musicians of his day. He was an accomplished violinist and a prolific composer, and had studied music under Charles Hague at Cambridge. He held firmly to a belief in the inferiority of all musical styles to the Italian, and his compositions were entirely unoriginal. They included seven operas, composed between 1821 and 1849 (most of them first performed at his own residence in Florence), three symphonies, and a number of choral works. His greatest importance was as the founder of the Royal Academy of Music in 1823. It was largely through Burghersh's efforts at fund-raising and lobbying that Britain's first conservatory of music came into existence, and, despite conflicts with the professorial staff caused by his authoritarian and dictatorial behaviour -- he insisted on restricting the programmes of the academy's concerts to Italian music and his own compositions -- it was largely through his support that it survived the precarious early years of its existence. 
Westmorland died at the country home to which he had retired, Apethorpe House, Wansford, Northamptonshire, on 16 October 1859, and was buried at Apethorpe. He was survived by his wife, one of their two daughters, and two of their five sons. His fourth son, Francis William Henry Fane, succeeded him as twelfth earl, and his youngest son, Julian Henry Charles Fane, followed him into the diplomatic service. His daughter, Lady Rose Weigall, edited his correspondence in 1912.

Fane, Julian Henry Charles (1827-1870), diplomatist and poet, fifth (but fourth surviving) son of John Fane, eleventh earl of Westmorland (1784-1859), and his wife, Priscilla Anne Fane, nee Wellesley-Pole, countess of Westmorland (1793-1879), was born on 10 October 1827 at Florence, where his father was minister. He was educated at Thames Ditton (1838-41) and Harrow School, before proceeding in 1847 to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, and in 1850 took the chancellor's medal for English verse with a poem on the death of Queen Adelaide, and his MA. In 1844 he joined the diplomatic service as unpaid attache to his father's mission in Berlin. After graduating, he went in a similar capacity to Vienna in September 1851, and was promoted in December to paid attache. He remained in Vienna until 1856, when he attended the congress of Paris as part of Lord Clarendon's special mission. He was then appointed secretary of legation at St Petersburg, before transferring back to Vienna in 1858. He was promoted to first secretary acting charge d'affaires at Paris in 1865, was protocolist to the conferences on Luxembourg held in London from 7 to 13 May 1867, and took charge of the Paris embassy in the interregnum between Lord Cowley and Lord Lyons, but he resigned the diplomatic service from ill health in June 1868. 
Fane's ambitions were, however, literary. In 1852 he published a volume 'Poems', which included a sequence of poems entitled 'Ad matrem', and in 1854 he brought out a translation of Heinrich Heine's poems. With Edward Lytton, whom he met in Paris in 1856, he wrote 'Tannhauser, or, The Battle of the Bards', which was published in 1861 under the pseudonyms of Neville Temple and Edward Trevor, although, as Fane told Lord Houghton, he and Lytton early agreed 'to commit a few discreet indiscretions in revealing our poor secret' (Reid, 2.69). Lord Clarendon commented, 'there are some very pretty things in it but it is 'hardly' decent -- at least it wd not do to read aloud to young Ladies' (Kennedy, 166). Fane also wrote occasionally for the reviews, notably an assessment of Robert Browning's 'The Ring and the Book' in the 'Edinburgh Review' (1869). Lord Derby observed after Fane's death that 'He had a strong fancy that his talents were thrown away in diplomacy (which was, on the contrary, exactly the proper sphere for them) and that he should some day earn a great literary reputation' ('Diaries', 56). 
'A most fascinating man' (Hewett, 35), Fane belonged to the social set based around Lady Waldegrave's houses at Nuneham Park (which he apostrophized in one of his 1852 poems) and Strawberry Hill. Handsome, and accounted 'dangerous', he was reported to be 'killing himself with women in Paris' (ibid., 92) in 1856. It was therefore something of a surprise when in 1866 he selected as his bride Lady Adine Eliza Anne Cowper (1843-1868), third daughter of George, sixth Earl Cowper. Lady Adine was extremely shy: her sister-in-law said that 'Adine shut up like a telescope if anyone spoke to her' (Cowper, 171), which was hardly a recommendation for a diplomatist's wife. But the marriage was happy, and produced a daughter, Ettie ['see 'Grenfell, Ethel, Lady Desborough], and a son, John (who died in 1876). It was also short-lived. Lady Adine, who had always been delicate, died from typhoid pneumonia on 20 October 1868. Her husband did not long survive her. Julian Fane developed tuberculosis in a form that prevented his swallowing liquids and speaking for nearly a year before his death, which took place at his home, 29 Portman Square, London, on 18 April 1870.

Fane, Mildmay, second earl of Westmorland (1602-1666), politician and writer, was born on 24 January 1602, the eldest son and heir of Francis Fane, first earl of Westmorland (1583/4-1629) ['see under 'Fane, Sir Thomas], and his wife, Mary (1581/2-1640), the daughter and heir of Sir Anthony Mildmay of Apethorpe, Northamptonshire, where Fane spent his early years; Lady Rachael Fane was his sister. In December 1616 he matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge; he proceeded MA in 1619. On 22 November 1620 he was returned as one of the MPs for Peterborough. Admitted on 7 August 1622 as a student of Lincoln's Inn, he was granted, on 9 September, a pass to travel overseas with his tutor, and embarked upon a two-year tour of France. At Orleans he devoted several months to the study of French, and at Nimes he was inspired to translate into English Beza's epigram upon the Pont du Gard. 
The Fane family seat was Mereworth Castle in Kent, and in 1625, the newly created earl's having secured the support of the Dering family for his son's candidature, Mildmay, now styled Lord Burghersh, was returned as a knight of the shire. On 1 February 1626, at the coronation of Charles I, he was admitted a knight of the Bath, and with the death of his grandmother in June was styled Lord Le Despenser. It was probably in the same year that he married Grace, the daughter of William Thornhurst of Agnes (or Aghne) Court, Romney Marsh, in Kent and his wife, Anne, daughter of Thomas, first Viscount Howard. He records in his autobiography the birth of six children, of whom the first five were girls; the last child, born on 6 January 1635, was a boy, Charles, later the third earl, to whom Charles I acted as godfather. The following year, probably on 29 June 1636, Grace Fane died in childbirth. On 21 June 1638 the widower married Mary ('c'.1611-1669), widow of Sir Roger Townshend and daughter and coheir of Horatio Vere. There were nine children of this marriage, of whom the eldest son, Vere, succeeded his half-brother in the earldom. 
Le Despenser had already sat as MP for Peterborough in 1625-6 and did so again in 1628; in February of that year he was also named to the commission of martial law in Northamptonshire. At the death of his father and his succession to the earldom other lucrative offices were secured through the assiduity of his mother and the patronage of Secretary Dorchester. He was made commissioner for the compositions for knighthood, as confirmed on 22 March 1631, and served as a JP and as a deputy lieutenant in Northamptonshire. But despite his high status in the county he fell foul of government efforts to exploit the revenue potential of the forest laws. In 1637, together with his mother, he was fined the huge sum of $19,000 for infractions in Rockingham forest, though it seems that in his and many other cases the fines were not actually collected. In spring 1640 he appears to have embroiled himself, ill-advisedly, in a dispute with Lord Chancellor Coventry. 
On 15 February 1639 Westmorland wrote to Windebanke that illness prevented him from accompanying the king's expeditionary force to Scotland, but he pledged not to 'fail either in person or substance at the time and place of rendezvous', and kept this promise, quartering with the army in York later in the year ('CSP dom.', '1638-9', 467). On 22 February 1642 he and two others received from Charles I his answer to the propositions of parliament for financing the suppression of the Irish rising. But he was also one of the lords who rallied to the king's court at York, pledging money for his campaign on 22 June. Westmorland, Lord Mountagu, and Sir Christopher Hatton wrote to the high sheriff of Northamptonshire informing him that they intended to execute the commission of array on 15 August, but on that day they sent notice to the parliamentary commissioners that they were abandoning the attempt in the hope that the outbreak of hostilities could be avoided. A week later, however, on the 22nd, they organized a muster of gentry sympathetic to the royal cause at Oundle. The arrival in the county of the parliamentarian army put an end to these efforts and, following a summons from the Lords, Westmorland was imprisoned in the Tower. On 1 April 1643 the Lords voted to parole him to his house in Bartholomew Close; despite Commons opposition, this was allowed and in August he was given permission to ride within 5 miles of the city. During the following months he pledged loyalty to the Commonwealth and directed several petitions to the Lords, complaining that his losses from fines and sequestration in several counties amounted to over $3300. On 26 July 1644 the committee for compounding imposed a further fine of $2000, which parliament halved on the 30th; his properties were taken out of sequestration on 14 September. He subscribed to the solemn league and covenant before the commissioners of the great seal on 22 April 1645. 
From 1645 until 1660 Westmorland withdrew almost entirely from public affairs, though in 1652 he signed a petition of Northamptonshire landowners urging measures to regulate the wool trade. He seems not to have been much troubled by the authorities; they commandeered his London house as a barracks in 1650, but paid compensation. In 1648 he had printed for private subscription his best-known writing, 'Otia sacra', a volume of verse; another entitled 'Fugitive Poetry', with its epigrams, acrostics, and anagrams in English and Latin, is among the manuscripts preserved at Apethorpe. He was acquainted with Robert Herrick, who urged him to publish, and mentions him in his poems. Westmorland's seven plays remained unpublished in his lifetime; his modern editor found them 'sufficiently individual to merit attention' but thought that Westmorland's verse, though not of the highest order, was his best achievement (Leech, 20). 
At the Restoration Westmorland benefited from the oblivion which so often enveloped the past record of wealthy turncoats. On 11 July 1660 he was appointed a lord lieutenant of Northamptonshire together with the earl of Bridgewater. In 1662 a warrant was issued for the payment to him of $50 from secret service funds for arranging for the demolition of fortifications at Northampton, which (as at other towns) were thought to encourage attempts at urban insurrection. He died on 12 February 1666 and was buried at Apethorpe. His widow, Mary, survived him; she died at Mereworth and was buried there on 18 November 1669.

Fane, Priscilla Anne, countess of Westmorland (1793-1879), diplomatic service wife and artist, was born on 13 March 1793. Her father was William Wellesley-Pole (1763-1845), brother of the duke of Wellington and Lord Wellesley; he was himself created Baron Maryborough in 1821, and succeeded his brother as third earl of Mornington in 1842. Her mother was Katharine Elizabeth (died 1851), eldest daughter of Admiral John Forbes. She was the youngest of the three daughters and one son. Her father being constantly in political office, she was brought up to move in those circles; her daughter wrote that, at eighteen, 'she already had the habit of society, a perfect knowledge of French and Italian, and a good idea of the leading questions of the day' ('Correspondence... Westmorland', vi). 
On 26 June 1811 Priscilla married John Fane, Lord Burghersh (1784-1859), the eldest son of John Fane, tenth earl of Westmorland. He was at that time serving in the army under Wellington, and his new wife accompanied him on the campaigns of 1813-14. Then in 1814 Burghersh transferred to the diplomatic service, where he made the remainder of his career. He was appointed minister in Florence, and lived in Italy for the next sixteen years. Lady Burghersh's diplomatic salon was frequented by the usual array of travellers, aristocrats, royalties, and politicians, British and European; although the Italian courts were not among the major diplomatic postings, Lady Burghersh's status was enhanced by the widely held knowledge that she was the favourite niece and correspondent of the victor of Europe, Wellington. Here she laid the foundations of a large circle of friends and correspondents; such circles were an important means of gathering information from abroad in the era before speedy communications and mass media, and by their means women often contributed significantly, if informally, to the development of foreign policy. Lady Burghersh's activities as a hostess were necessarily somewhat curtailed in this period by the birth of eight children. The eldest, a son, lived only for six months in 1816, and the second was stillborn in 1817, but they were followed by four more sons and two daughters. Only one son and one daughter survived their mother. 
In 1830, on the change of ministry, the Burghershes returned to England. Without a diplomatic salary the family was very short of money, and they lived quietly in London, where Priscilla's close relationship with the duke of Wellington was revived. She and her children spent much time with him at Walmer Castle, and she became one of his circle of female confidantes: Lady Cowper observed in 1836 that 'Lady Burghersh enjoys his confidence more than anyone else, although Lady Salisbury likes to think that she is the favourite' ('Lieven-Palmerston Correspondence', 117). Lady Cowper was perhaps in a position to know that Wellington sometimes used his niece as a confidential intermediary between himself and the whig prime minister (Lady Cowper's brother), Lord Melbourne. But in general her time passed unobtrusively with her children and in pursuing the hobby of painting which she had taken up in 1829. Though it is not known by whom Lady Burghersh was taught to paint, Joseph Farington recorded in his diary her visit, with her sisters, during a sitting by her mother in 1814, to the studio of the fashionable portrait painter Sir Thomas Lawrence (who painted a celebrated portrait of the duke of Wellington the following year). Together with the knowledge that Lady Burghersh herself sat to Lawrence in Florence in 1820, these associations suggest that he was instrumental in arranging tuition for her, as he had for other female artists, for example, the miniature painters Charlotte Jones and Mrs Mee. The subjects of her known paintings indicate that, before the duties of a diplomatic service wife took her elsewhere, Lady Burghersh held serious aspirations as a painter. Lord Burghersh was a talented amateur musician and moved in bohemian circles, and so was less disconcerted than most aristocratic husbands would have been when his wife exhibited six figure pieces in the Suffolk Street exhibition between 1833 and 1841. In 1842 and 1857 she sent two religious paintings to the British Institution. She also painted a picture of her grandmother, 'Anne, Countess of Mornington, Surrounded by the Effigies of her Sons' (1839; Apsley House, London), Wellington, Wellesley, and Lord Cowley, which was engraved in mezzotint the same year by T. Hodgett (repro. in R. Walker, 'Regency Portraits', 1985, 2, pl. 836) and became quite well known. Lady Burghersh also painted 'Wellington Writing the Waterloo Dispatch', now known from T. Hodgett's mezzotint of 1840 (impression in BM). 
In 1841 the Burghershes' fortunes changed. With the change of ministry, Burghersh was appointed minister at Berlin. The minister he was replacing, Lord William Russell, was disgruntled, and put the appointment down to Lady Burghersh lobbying Wellington; his wife, more generously, was 'glad the Burghershes get something -- they have a large family -- larger than ours; & the same income & habits of expence & luxury. So I don't grudge them their diplomatic treadmill' (Blakiston, 453-4). Burghersh's father died in December 1841, so it was as Lord and Lady Westmorland that they went to Berlin in August 1842. They remained there (with annual visits to London) for nine years, resuming their social and diplomatic entertaining, the company of royalties and diplomatists being leavened by that of musicians such as Meyerbeer and Mendelssohn and scientists and men of letters, including Alexander Humboldt. Their lifestyle was interrupted briefly by the revolution of 1848, when their house was fired on. A confirmed tory, Lady Westmorland was appalled by the events, accusing the Prussian government of 'truckling to the abominable and unjust tyranny of the mob' ('Correspondence... Westmorland', 121). In like vein, the British Chartists were 'horrible people' (ibid., 130). In 1851 the Westmorlands were transferred to Vienna. It was a promotion, but they found the society there less congenial, while the political and diplomatic manoeuvrings around the Crimean War (in which one of their two surviving sons served) made the posting an uncomfortable one. The death of Wellington in 1852 was a huge personal loss. Towards the end of 1855 Westmorland retired to Apethorpe, in Northamptonshire, the family estate that had come to him in 1841. Although concurring in the decision, Lady Westmorland confided in one of her friends that 'it costs me a good deal to definitely give up Germany to settle in England. I have never liked living in this country... I have always felt that to be comfortable here you needed health of iron, and a much larger fortune than ours. (ibid., 273)' Finally settled in England, Lady Westmorland kept up her interest in European affairs through her wide circle of correspondents, and also through her youngest son, Julian Fane, who had followed his father into the diplomatic service. Westmorland died in 1859, and thereafter his widow lived mostly in London and at Wimbledon, with her youngest child, Lady Rose Weigall, with occasional visits to the continent. Her own health was declining -- she was in a bath chair by 1863 -- and although she continued to be interested in the affairs of the world, in 1865 she confessed that 'As for political opinions, I trouble little about them. Everything is so changed 'since our time', that I am not sure that the so-called Conservatives are not more destructive than others' ('Correspondence... Westmorland', 466). Her mind and memory also began to give way, perhaps hastened by the death of her beloved youngest son in 1870, and she eventually died at her London home, 29 Portman Square, on 18 February 1879, and was buried on 25 February at Apethorpe.

Fane, Sir Ralph (b. before 1510, d. 1552), conspirator, was born by 1510, being about twenty-three in 1533, the illegitimate son of John Fane, and nephew of Henry Fane (died 1533) of Hadlow in Kent. At his death Henry left lands and a house to Ralph, who was then about twenty-three. Ralph Fane sought to enhance his prospects further through service. He was a servant of Thomas Cromwell from 1531 until 1538 and may have finished his education in the latter's household. Cromwell recommended him to Henry VIII in 1538 and he was appointed a gentleman pensioner in 1540 and then lieutenant in 1545. He was highly regarded and a capable soldier. The king rewarded him with grants of land, stewardships, and other offices, including chief governor of Cage and Postern parks in Kent. By 1540 Fane had married Elizabeth Brydges (died 1568) ['see 'Fane, Elizabeth], literary patron, daughter and heir of Roland Brydges of Clerkenwell, Middlesex, and The Ley, Weobley, Herefordshire, and his wife, Margery; they had no children. Fane obtained even more property at his father-in-law's death in 1540, acquiring livery of the lands in 1542. He was now a very wealthy man. In May 1544, during the siege of Boulogne, he was dispatched to Antwerp to recruit German and Dutch mercenaries. Put in charge of Christoph Landenberg's troops, he distinguished himself in battle and on 30 September was knighted by Henry at Boulogne. 
Fane was a beneficiary under the king's will and was appointed joint-steward on 4 October 1547 with Sir William Goring of several Kent and Sussex estates administered by the crown until the majority of Henry Brandon, second duke of Suffolk. Earlier that year he had been appointed JP for Kent through the influence of his new patron, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector to Edward VI. Somerset had Fane elected MP to the 1547 parliament. Fane participated in the battle of Pinkie in September 1547 and captured George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly. He was created knight-banneret between 18 and 25 September for his services and continued to serve in the north during 1547-8. He was a combative man, whose disputes alienated the Kent gentry. He was granted various manors in October 1547 and wrote to Somerset's steward, Sir John Thynne, in January 1548 to ask that his interests and especially his new grants be protected because of the 'good wille and service I have and yet do owe him [Somerset]' (Hatfield, Cecil MS 231, fol. 68'r'- 'v'). He believed the commonwealth needed further religious and social reform. On 14 February Fane was appointed with several others to supervise the dissolution of chantries and several religious foundations in Canterbury and elsewhere in Kent. He was rewarded for his military service on 22 July 1550 with grants of lands belonging to the former collegiate foundation of St Stephen, Westminster, as well as crown property in Kent, once belonging to Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham. 
In October 1551 Fane was accused of conspiring with Somerset against John Dudley, earl of Warwick and duke of Northumberland, lord president of the privy council. Like Somerset's other military clients, Fane had offered practical support during 1550-51. Also, he quarrelled with Northumberland over pasture rights to Postern Park in March 1551 and was briefly imprisoned as a result. He managed to avoid immediate capture on 16 October by fleeing from the court at Whitehall Palace and commented that Somerset was not bold enough but that 'if he could get home he cared for non of them all he was so strong' (BL, Cotton MS Nero C. x, fol. 44'v'). His strong words belied the truth and he was found hiding in the stable of the Lambeth house of one of his servants. He was sent to the Tower of London with Somerset's other clients. Charged with plotting to murder Northumberland and other privy councillors, Fane was accused of high treason on 24 November. Among other improbable claims against him was that he had '2000 men in readines' to attack Somerset's enemies (BL, Cotton MS Nero C.x, fol. 44'r'). Despite his past military record and his strong denial of the charges, he was tried on 27 January 1552 and sentenced to death. The king reported that at the trial Fane had been 'answering like a ruffian' ('DNB'). On 25 February, Edward VI signed his death warrant. A day later Fane and another conspirator, Sir Miles Partridge, were hanged on Tower Hill, while Sir Thomas Arundell and Sir Michael Stanhope were beheaded at the same time. On the scaffold, Fane once again pleaded innocence, and is said to have added: 'my blood shall be the duke's [Northumberland's] bolster as long as he lives' (Camden, 307-8). His lands fell to the crown and were immediately bestowed on proteges of Northumberland, including Sir William Sidney, who received the manor of Penhurst, Kent, and Sir John Gates, who received other property at Westminster. Fane was probably executed as an example to the rest of Somerset's clientele.

Fane, Robert George Cecil (1796-1864), judge, was born on 8 May 1796, the thirteenth and youngest child of the Hon. Henry Fane (1739-1802), of Fulbeck, Lincolnshire, member of parliament, and Anne (1768/9-1838), daughter of Edward Buckley Batson, banker, of London and Avon Tyrrell, Hampshire. Robert was the brother of Sir Henry Fane and Harriet Arbuthnot. He was educated at Charterhouse School from 1808 to 1813, and matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 22 May 1813. Subsequently he was a demy and fellow (1824-35) of Magdalen College, Oxford, where he proceeded BA in 1817 and MA in 1819. Having never previously witnessed an execution, he was a keen spectator of the hangings of the Cato Street conspirators in May 1820. But according to his sister Harriet he could not bring himself to watch the drop 'which excited great contempt in the people who were in the room with him' ('Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot', 1.16). He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 1 June 1821, and soon enjoyed a considerable practice as an equity barrister. 
In 1823 -- the year in which his brother-in-law, Charles Arbuthnot, retired as government patronage secretary -- the lord chancellor Lord Eldon appointed Fane a bankruptcy commissioner. On 2 December 1831 he was nominated by the whig lord chancellor Lord Brougham as one of the six commissioners who were to hold office under the new act establishing the court of bankruptcy. He married first, on 24 June 1835, Isabella Mary, youngest daughter of Admiral Sir Eliab Harvey GCB; she died at Rolls Park, Chigwell, on 15 December 1838. He married second, on 7 September 1841, Harriet Anne, only daughter of Admiral the Hon. Sir Henry Blackwood, bt; she died on 31 December 1869. With his first wife Fane had no children; with his second wife he had two sons, Lionel Arthur Cecil (1851-1872) and Cecil Francis William (1856-1914), and two daughters, Cicely Harriette (1845-1933) and Blanche Anne (1846-1935). 
In later life Fane's judicial bearing was marked by an eccentricity of manner and 'occasional acerbity of temper' ('GM'), but although his decisions were frequently the subject of comment, very few of his judgments were reversed on appeal. He took an interest in railway schemes, and was for some years a director of the Eastern Counties Railway. As a member of the Law Amendment Society he was a constant attendant at the weekly meetings in Lancaster Place. He was the author of a number of articles, pamphlets, books, and published letters concerning the laws relating to bankruptcy, debt, and tenant right, including 'Outline of a plan for improving the law of debtor and creditor, without abolishing imprisonment for debt' (1844); 'Bankruptcy Reform, in a Series of Letters Addressed to Sir R. Peel' (2 vols., 1838); 'Ministry of Justice; its Necessity as an Instrument of Law Reform' (1848), and 'Tenant-Right, its Necessity as a Means of Promoting Good Farming'. Fane was an ardent lover of field sports, and was well known in the Leicester hunts; he occasionally appeared in court 'bearing the marks of injuries incurred in the chase' ('GM'). He was also a patron of the fine arts. He died 'somewhat suddenly' at the Burdon Hotel, Weymouth, on 4 October 1864 ('GM').

Fane, Sir Thomas (d. 1589), administrator, was the elder of two Thomas Fanes, both sons of George Fane (died 'c'.1571) of Badsell in Tudeley, Kent, and Joan, daughter of William Waller of Groombridge, Kent. A kinsman of the Edwardian politician Sir Ralph Fane (died 1552), he acquired influential connections to the Culpepers through his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Culpeper of Bedgebury, Kent. These probably account for his participation in Wyatt's rebellion against Queen Mary in 1554. Fane was accused of marching on London with a large rebel force. He was subsequently imprisoned in the Tower and attainted of high treason. A warrant was issued for his execution, but on 18 March 1554 Lord Chancellor Gardiner was instructed to spare him. He seems to have been released a week later and pardoned on 3 April, though his estates were not restored until 4 March 1555. Fane made little impact on local affairs until the 1570s. He served as sheriff of Kent in 1572-3 and was a justice of the peace from about February 1573. On 31 August 1573 he was knighted at Dover Castle by Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth. His prospects were undoubtedly improved by his second marriage, to Lady Mary Neville ('c'.1554-1626), daughter and heir general of Henry, Lord Bergavenny, on 12 December 1574 at Birling, Kent. 
During the course of his career Fane attracted little criticism, although he was accused on one occasion of pressuring an assize jury to return a decision favourable to his own clients. In November 1580 he was appointed one of five deputy commissioners within Kent for breeding and maintaining an adequate supply of horses for royal service. When the Spanish Armada was expected in 1588 Fane and Sir Thomas Scott were active in the deployment of troops along the Kent coast, advising Burghley that 2000 men could be spared to protect the queen and 4000 deployed to repulse a landing. At this time Fane's younger brother, Thomas (died 1607), of Burston, Kent, was appointed lieutenant of Dover Castle; in 1603 he became deputy warden of the Cinque Ports. Shortly before his death Fane became embroiled in his wife's claim to the barony of Bergavenny or Abergavenny against Edward Neville, the heir male. On 20 November 1588, for example, he submitted a list of lands claimed by his wife to Burghley as master of the court of wards. It was perhaps in connection with the Neville inheritance that Fane also brought a complaint in chancery in 1588 against Nicholas Maynard concerning the possession of copyhold land in the manor of Rotherfield in Sussex. However, Fane died on 13 March 1589. His place of death is unknown but he was buried at Mereworth, Kent. By an inquisition post mortem conducted on 15 April 1589, Francis Fane ['see below'], his eldest son with Lady Mary Neville, was found to be his heir. Fane's second son, George (died 1640), of Badsell and Burston, Kent, was a long-serving member of parliament and the husband of Elizabeth, daughter of Robert, first Baron Spencer of Althorp.

Fanelli, Francesco (b. 1577), sculptor, was born on 17 December 1577 in Florence, the son of Virgilio Fanelli and his wife, Alessandra. His father was a sculptor and native of Florence but no evidence survives concerning his activities. Fanelli was apprenticed to the Tuscan sculptor Giovanni Bandini. He may have assisted his master in the large Medici commission for the statue of Grand Duke Ferdinando I that Bandini had undertaken a few years before his death (piazza Micheli, Leghorn) and have contributed to the marble group of 'Adonis and his Hound' (1598; ex Sothebys, New York, 25 January 2001). Bandini's will, which referred to his pupil as a close friend, granted Fanelli freedom to use his models. 
Some time before 1604 Fanelli married Lucrezia (died 1623?), with whom he had eight children, including Virgilio ('b'. before 1604, died 1678) and Giovanni Battista (1605-1672). Virgilio enjoyed a prominent career in Genoa, Bologna, Toledo, and Madrid, where he executed the chandelier for the Pantheon in the Escorial, and Giovanni Battista entered his father's workshop. The name of Fanelli's second wife is not known. By 5 August 1605, the date of Giovanni Battista's baptism, it is evident that Fanelli and his family were living in Genoa. During his twenty-five-year residence in Genoa, Fanelli collaborated with many of the city's indigenous and foreign sculptors, painters, and silversmiths. Fanelli's first recorded works date to 1609 and 1610 when the Spanish-appointed governor, Marchese Giovanni Domenico Spinola, commissioned from him two bronze crucifixes. The larger of the two, nearly 2 m high, was executed after a design by the painter Giovanni Battista Paggi, through whom Fanelli may have received a further commission from Franco Barsotto in 1615. This called for six marble angels in relief to decorate the lateral doors of the sanctuary in the church of Santa Maria della Misericordia, Savona. Paggi, along with Battista Orsolino, later acted as Fanelli's supervisor on the prestigious commission for the decoration of the chapel of the Madonna in the church of Santa Maria della Vigne. Fanelli worked intermittently on this project between 1620 and 1629 and was responsible for all the work in bronze. For the newly completed church of the Gesu, Fanelli was commissioned to execute three free-standing marble figures ('St John the Evangelist', signed and dated 1619, and 'Ecce homo' and 'The Redeemer', 1625-6). In 1619 Fanelli collaborated with the silversmith Francesco Carrega who cast in silver his models of figurines to decorate a chest for Giacomo Filippo Durazzo. Similarly, a silver basin with scenes from the life of Cleopatra (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) may have been modelled by Fanelli after a design by the Genoese painter Bernardo Strozzi (AM Oxf.) before being passed to a Dutch or Flemish silversmith. 
The last record of Fanelli in Genoa pertains to a poll tax levied on his workshop for the construction of a new city wall in 1630. He is next recorded in London at the court of Charles I in March 1632, when he drew a pension of $60 (TNA: PRO, SO, 3/10, fol. 230'r', unnumbered). 'En route', Fanelli appears to have stayed in Flanders, where he executed a pair of equestrian statuettes of the governor, Francisco de Moncada, marques de Aytona (died 1635), and Philip IV's prime minister, the count-duke of Olivares (ex Sothebys, New York, 10 January 1995). 
Fanelli may have been summoned to England by the lord treasurer, Richard Weston, first earl of Portland, whose bronze tomb effigy has been attributed to Fanelli ('c'.1633-5; Winchester Cathedral). In this, and in the memorial bust of the poet Sir Robert Ayton ('c'.1638; Westminster Abbey), Fanelli is credited with executing all the work in bronze. In the former he contributed to a design by Isaac Besnier, although he was evidently capable of designing his own monuments: Thomas Howard, twenty-first or fourteenth earl of Arundel, commanded in his will of 3 September 1641, 'That my Tombe bee my owne Figure (of white marble or brasse designed by Sign.r Francesco Fanelli) sitting and looking upwards' (Hervey, 460). 
In England, Fanelli is principally remembered for small table bronzes and reliefs of animalier, mythological, and biblical subjects. George Vertue wrote that Fanelli 'had a particular genius for these works' and sold them 'to persons that were Curious to sett on Tables cupboards shelves by way of Ornament' (Vertue, 'Note books', 4.110). They were instrumental in establishing the vogue for baroque sculpture in Caroline England. His technique was to achieve a high degree of finish in the wax master-model to limit the amount of filing in the metal. By making alterations or additions to a cast wax replica of the master-model, Fanelli then effected numerous variations of his models, for example, many of his equestrian groups derive from two generic types of horses: the 'Leaping Horse' (example in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, Brunswick) and the 'Rearing Horse' (example at David Peel Ltd, 1971). Fanelli's non-equine bronze groups include an 'Adonis, Venus and Cupid' (V&A); 'David and Goliath' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York); and 'Cupid on a Dolphin' (NG Scot.), while works in relief include 'Orpheus Singing to the Beasts' (with sets of miniature animal plaques; V&A); 'Adam and Eve'; and 'Christ Carrying the Cross' (Minneapolis Institute of Art). 
From Abraham van der Doort's 1639 inventory of the Royal Collection, it is evident that Charles I purchased at least five of Fanelli's statuettes. A 'St. George Slaying the Dragon' was listed in the cabinet room at Whitehall, where Raphael's painting of the same subject was displayed. The statuettes were dispersed in the Commonwealth sale. In addition to his work as a sculptor, it is possible that Fanelli was involved, from 1639, in the ambitious Italianate garden complex planned for Queen Henrietta Maria's new palace at Wimbledon. This may account for Fanelli's book of engravings, the 'Varie architetture', an example of which was reprinted by Van Merle in Paris in 1661. The plates of elaborate sculptural grottoes and fountains perfectly complement the projected layout of the gardens envisaged by Andre Mollet. 
An entry in the diary of George Weckherlin, the king's secretary, dated 19 February 1639, suggests that Fanelli may have returned home or revisited his contacts in Flanders: 'Made a Safeconduct for an Italian (his Ma.ts Sculptor) by the L. Marquis order' (Trumbull papers, BL, vol. 192, Add. 72433, 62ff.). However, the following year he returned to England and completed a life-size bust of Charles, prince of Wales, which he signed 'Sculptor to the King of Great Britain' (1640; priv. coll.). It was commissioned by the prince's governor, William Cavendish, second earl of Newcastle, who was a consistent patron of Fanelli and owned a complete set of his equestrian statuettes. A second small bust of Prince Charles, cast in silver and bronze and dating to 'c'.1643, may suggest that Fanelli accompanied the court to Oxford and collaborated with a silversmith there (ex Sothebys, New York, 10 January 1995). It is from these busts, and an exquisite miniature one of Charles I ('c'.1635-8; V&A), that we can best judge Fanelli's ability at portraiture. The bust of Charles I, with its distinctive nautical motifs, may represent Charles as lord high admiral, a post he had personally assumed on the death of George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, in 1628. 
The date and place of Fanelli's death are not known. It is thought he left for Paris, but as no evidence survives to support this, Vertue's statement that he 'livd and dyd in England' (Vertue, 'Note books', 4.110) cannot be discounted. His workshop was re-established in London in 1663 when his son, Giovanni Battista, found employment with Charles II, hence the use of Fanelli's models well into the eighteenth century.

Fanning, Edmund (1737-1818), colonial official and army officer, was born on 24 April 1737, in Southold township (now Riverhead) on Long Island, New York, North America, the fifth son of Captain James Fanning, army officer, of Riverhead, Long Island, and Hannah Smith of Smithtown. He graduated from Yale College with a BA and a Berkeley scholarship in 1757, studied briefly at Harvard College, and then moved to Hillsborough, in Orange county, North Carolina. There he was elected a trustee and commissioner of the town (1760), and was admitted to the bar (1762). He became successively an assemblyman for Orange county (1762, 1766-8), a public register (1763) and militia officer (1763; from 1767, colonel), judge of the superior court (1765), and borough representative for Hillsborough (1771). 
The patronage of Governor William Tryon accelerated Fanning's professional rise and increased his unpopularity. Fanning became the scapegoat of the backcountry regulator movement which protested against high fees and excessive taxes settled upon the western counties by the colonial government of the eastern seaboard. Regulators fired on his house in April 1768, and later razed it in September 1770, before dragging him through the streets of Hillsborough. At the regulators' insistence, he was tried for extortion, and convicted but not punished; he thereupon resigned from the office of register. Inflamed by this humiliation, he subsequently commanded a corps of militia at the battle of Great Alamance Creek (16 May 1771) and helped Governor Tryon decisively to suppress the insurgent regulators. When Tryon moved to become governor of New York in 1771, Fanning followed him as his private secretary and was immediately appointed surrogate of the province; three years later, in 1774, he became surveyor-general of New York. In 1776 he raised and commanded a loyalist corps known as the associated refugees or the King's American regiment of foot which gained a reputation for cruelty during the American War of Independence. In 1779 his remaining property in North Carolina was pronounced confiscate, though it was not sold until 1786; he later received $4447 from the loyalist claims commission. 
At the end of the war Fanning became a colonel in the British army, and was subsequently promoted to major-general (12 October 1793), lieutenant-general (26 June 1799), and general (25 April 1808). On 23 September 1783 he was appointed councillor and lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia; he held these offices until he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward Island on 26 July 1786. He married Phoebe Maria Burns at Point Pleasant, Nova Scotia, on 30 November 1785; together they had three daughters, Louisa Augusta ('b'. 'c'.1787), Maria S. Matilda ('b'. 1791), and Margaret William Tryon ('b'. 1801), and a son, Frederick Augustus (1789-1812). In 1790, when war with Spain seemed possible, he offered to lead a British-American campaign force in the Floridas. In 1792 the privy council dismissed charges of tyranny that had been preferred against him. During his colonial career, various British and American colleges garlanded him with degrees. He received honorary MAs from Harvard College in 1764 and from King's College, New York (later Columbia University), in 1772, and a DCL from Oxford University on 6 July 1774; both Yale and Dartmouth later presented him with honorary LLDs in 1803. 
Fanning resigned the lieutenant-governorship of Prince Edward Island in 1805, and went for a few months to London; he moved there permanently in 1813 and died at Upper Seymour Street on 28 February 1818. He was survived by his wife and their three daughters. Lord Selkirk's judgement that he was 'no superabundant head' ('Lord Selkirk's Diary', 6) was partial rather than conclusive; he has more recently been judged 'the most successful of the breed' of loyalist governors of British North America ('DCB', 5.312). Likewise, his reputation as a tyrannical instrument of British colonial policy is largely undeserved; it is more significant as an index of the intra-colonial tensions that fed into the American War of Independence and, later, of the paternalism of British imperial government in the counter-revolutionary decades following the British defeat.

Fanshawe, Ann, Lady Fanshawe (1625-1680), autobiographer, was born on 25 March 1625 in Hart Street in the parish of St Olave, London, the daughter of Sir John Harrison (died 1669) of Balls Park, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Margaret (died 1640), daughter of Robert Fanshawe of Fanshawe Gate, Derbyshire. From the Palladian elegance of the house at Balls which her father completed in the early 1640s it may be conjectured that her family, like that of her future husband, belonged to that section of the Caroline elite precociously sensitive to continental developments in the arts. Her education was undertaken at home in London in the charge of her mother and was brought to an end by her mother's death in July 1640. Ann's autobiographical record enumerates the accomplishments acquired by a gentry child of the 1630s -- music, dancing, French, and needlework -- but also remembers that her inclination was towards riding and running, and that she was then 'what we graver people call a hoyting girle' ('Memoirs', ed. Loftis, 111). After her mother's death she took charge of her father's household through what proved to be years of unaccustomed adversity. Her brother William joined King Charles when he raised his standard at Nottingham, and pledged that their father would lend the king the then immense sum of $50,000. In 1642 her father was taken prisoner by the parliament, held under house arrest in London, and threatened with transportation. His entire estate was sequestrated so that, when his daughters joined him in the royalist stronghold of Oxford the following year, 'from as good a house as any gentleman of England had we came to a baker's house in an obscure street, and from rooms well furnished to lye in a very bad bed in a garrett, to one dish of meat and that not the best ordered; no mony, for we were as poor as Job, nor clothes more than a man or two brought in their cloak bags. ('Memoirs', ed. Loftis, 111)' On 18 May 1644 Ann married her second cousin, Richard (later Sir Richard) Fanshawe (1608-1666) at Wolvercote church, near Oxford, in a modest ceremony whose scale gives an accurate sense of the reduced circumstances of the besieged court (there were only a handful of guests, including Edward Hyde, the future earl of Clarendon, and the wedding-ring itself was secondhand). From this point the course of her life was directed by her marriage to one of the chief diplomats and linguists in the service of the Stuarts. The marriage, as recorded by Ann herself, seems to have been an entirely happy one, equal and companionate to a degree unusual for the mid-seventeenth century, with genuine mutual sympathy perhaps fostered by travels and adversities undertaken together as well as by an absolute shared commitment to the royalist cause. 
The 'Memoirs', which Ann composed in 1676, a decade after her husband's death, give a full account of their travels in the years of the second civil war and the interregnum, as well as recording the births of twenty-four children of whom only three survived into adulthood. In 1645 the Fanshawes followed the retreating forces of Charles, prince of Wales, into the west of England, and in the following year to the Scilly and Channel Islands, and thence, in August 1646, to France. They then separated and Lady Fanshawe returned to London alone, where her husband joined her secretly by August 1647, remaining there until a visit to France and to the exiled court of Henrietta Maria at the end of the year. 
In September 1648 the Fanshawes began another sequence of travels, from Paris to Ireland, where they remained until their departure in February 1650 for Spain. While in Ireland, Lady Fanshawe survived the 1649 rebellion in Cork, and early the next year saw and heard the banshee in the house of the O'Brien earls of Thomond, an experience vividly recorded in her 'Memoirs'. On her return from Spain to London in 1651, her husband being absent with Charles II's disastrous campaign in Scotland, she began the compilation of her manuscript household book. In the latter part of the year, while her husband was imprisoned after the disastrous battle of Worcester, she visited the window of his prison daily until she obtained his release on bail on the grounds of his ill health. In 1653 and 1654, a period of retirement at Tankersley Park near Sheffield in Yorkshire came to an end after the death of a daughter, Ann, which appears to have affected both parents greatly. Thereafter a period of ill health and travel between Bath and Hertfordshire ended with her husband's departure for France in November 1658 to join Charles II. She followed him in June 1659, having obtained a pass by impersonating a citizen's wife and then forging her own name onto it. 
In May 1660 the Fanshawes returned to England with Charles II. In August 1662 they left for Portugal where Ann's husband was sent as ambassador, returning in August of the next year. The last of Lady Fanshawe's travels, with her husband's embassy to Madrid, began in January 1664. Despite her recorded enjoyment of the deference accorded to an ambassador's wife and her personal success at the Spanish court, her husband was recalled in March 1666, perhaps for having exceeded his instructions, shortly after which he fell sick and died. After his death, on 16/26 June 1666, refusing offers of a pension at the Spanish court on the condition that she embrace Catholicism, Ann embarked upon an impoverished and anxious return journey to England, accompanying the embalmed body of her husband which she interred temporarily in Hertford, before erecting an elaborate tomb for him in St Mary's, Ware, in 1670. She issued his last translation (of the Spanish court play 'Querer por solo querer') privately as a posthumous memorial to him, a process of commemoration brought to completion in her 'Memoirs' of 1676, written for her sole surviving son, Richard. For much of the remainder of her life she was occupied in the largely unsuccessful attempt to recover debts from an increasingly indifferent royal Treasury, an attempt which elicited the mockery of Delariviere Manley in her scabrous 'New Atalantis' (1709). 
A complementary insight into Ann Fanshawe's life is given by her manuscript household book. This remains unpublished despite its considerable interest as a reflection of the degree to which an elite woman of the mid-seventeenth century was directly involved with the quotidian running of her household -- as well as stillroom and medical recipes (which latter appear uniformly unhelpful if not actively dangerous) -- and also contains a representative number of Spanish recipes. This places Lady Fanshawe among that small group of Caroline gentry of whom Sir Kenelm Digby is the most eminent, who introduced the cookery of the continent into their English households. She died in January 1680 and was buried on 20 January at St Mary's, Ware.

Fanshawe, Catherine Maria (1765-1834), poet, was born at Shabden in Chipstead, Surrey, on 6 July 1765, the second daughter of John Fanshawe (1738-1816) of Shabden, who was first clerk of the board of green cloth in the household of George III, and his wife, Penelope, daughter and sole representative of John Dredge of Reading, Berkshire (died 1807). On John Fanshawe's death the estate was sold, and the old house has since entirely disappeared, although Fanshawe and his wife were buried in Chipstead churchyard. Their eldest son, John, died in 1772, and Robert Charles, the only other boy, in 1789. Catherine and her sisters, their father's coheirs, lived together after his death at 15 Berkeley Square, London, and at Midhurst House, Richmond, Surrey, and belonged to a small set of London intellectuals and literati. 
Catherine Fanshawe was endowed with varied accomplishments and with a sympathetic disposition. She was the only one of the three sisters who wrote verses, although all of them were good artists. Their manners, however, were marked by excessive formality, and Catherine was in addition physically disabled and very delicate. She was 'admirable as a letter-writer, as a reader of Shakespeare, and as a designer in almost every style', was the testimony of Mary Mitford, who added that her friend's 'drawings and etchings are those of an artist' (Mitford, 1.251). Lockhart called her 'a woman of rare wit and genius, in whose society Scott greatly delighted' (Lockhart, 7.156), and Scott himself said 'I read Miss Fanshawe's pieces, which are quite beautiful' (ibid., 158). She offered to make the Revd William Harness her heir, but he declined the offer, and she left him her etchings and manuscripts, from the latter of which he compiled her 'Memorials'. 
Catherine Fanshawe's poems long remained in manuscript or in private collections. Several of her pieces were published in Joanna Baillie's 'Collection of Poems' (1823) and numerous extracts from these are quoted in Mary Mitford's 'Recollections of a Literary Life'. Her best-known poem is the riddle on the letter 'H', which was often attributed to Lord Byron and was included in at least two editions of his works. It originated in a conversation on the misuse of that letter when she was visiting Thomas Hope at Deepdene, Surrey. She wrote it during the night, read the lines to the guests at breakfast next morning, and wrote them in Hope's album. The opening line, modified by James Smith, runs: '
'Twas whispered in heaven, 'twas muttered in hell. 

' Two lines of a poem by Praed, which appeared in the 'Morning Post' in March 1833, suggested her 'Speech of the Member for Odium', a poetic squib on Cobbett who sat for Oldham, which was afterwards printed for private circulation. A few copies of Catherine Fanshawe's 'Memorials', which contained most of her poems and nine photographs from her etchings, were printed by Harness in 1865 for circulation among her friends, and 250 copies of 'The Literary Remains of Catherine Maria Fanshawe, with Notes by the Late Rev. William Harness' were issued by Pickering in 1876. Miss Berry's 'Journal' includes a letter and poem by Catherine Fanshawe (M. Berry, 'Extracts of the Journals and Correspondence of Miss Berry from... 1783 to 1852', ed. T. Lewis, 3 vols., 1865, 2.297-302) and another poem, entitled 'The Country Cat Docketed by Miss Fanshawe' (3.562-8). An extract from one of her letters, describing a dinner party at Sir Humphry Davy's house, at which Byron and Madame de Stael met, was printed in 'Murray's Magazine' (1887). Three of her poems are included in Locker's 'Lyra elegantiarum'. 
Two of Catherine Fanshawe's sketchbooks belonged to the wife (died 1904) of Dean Gregory of St Paul's Cathedral, daughter of Catherine Fanshawe's first cousin, Lady Stopford. Mrs Gregory also owned some large watercolour drawings by Catherine Fanshawe illustrating Shakespeare's 'Seven Ages of Man'. Several of her sketchbooks went to Mrs Gregory's sisters, the Misses Stopford of Richmond. Many of them are foreign sketches, depicting tours in Italy, but some delineate English scenery. Catherine Fanshawe paid numerous visits to the south of Europe for the benefit of her health. 
Catherine Fanshawe died at Putney Heath, Surrey, after a long and painful illness, on 17 April 1834. Penelope, her elder sister, had died of influenza in April 1833. Both are commemorated, with their parents and two brothers, on the tombstone at Chipstead, and Penelope is also remembered on a tablet in Richmond parish church. Elizabeth Christiana, the younger sister, died at Richmond on 25 March 1856. The house in Berkeley Square was then sold, and Midhurst House at Richmond was left to the sisters' first cousin, the widow of the Hon. Sir Robert Stopford.

Fanshawe, Sir Henry (1569-1616), exchequer official, was born in August 1569, the eldest son of Thomas Fanshawe (c.1533-1601), queen's remembrancer in the exchequer, and his first wife, Mary Bourchier ('c'.1550-1578), daughter of Anthony Bourchier of Barnsley, Gloucestershire. After entering Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1581, and graduating BA in 1584 he became a member of the Inner Temple in 1587. He was related by marriage or friendship to most of the senior bureaucrats of the period, particularly to the Hattons, and it was a family friend who obtained him a seat at Westbury in the 1589 parliament when he was not quite twenty-one. In 1593 he sat again and served on one or two committees. He was being groomed for the high exchequer office which was his in reversion and in 1594 he obtained the reversion of the office of auditor for the north parts of the duchy of Lancaster. He held this office by 1596, which explains his election for Boroughbridge. At the same time he was actively assisting his father in the exchequer. 
By this time Fanshawe had married his stepmother's younger sister, Elizabeth Smythe (1577?-1631). His heir, Thomas Fanshawe, later Viscount Fanshawe, was born in 1596, the eldest of eleven children. His youngest son, Richard Fanshawe, was born in 1608. In 1601 Henry inherited the powerful and lucrative post of queen's remembrancer, the third of his name to hold that position, with the large house in Warwick Lane, London, which served as the remembrancer's office, and Ware Park, near Hertford, which was convenient when the exchequer moved to Hertford because of plague in London, and for its proximity to such places as Hatfield House and Theobalds. Here he was also a prominent local administrator. Fanshawe was frequently required to serve on special commissions and advise on financial matters. His advice, always profoundly conservative, was influential in determining exchequer procedure and proposing improvements in revenue raising. He saw the court as having always been the instrument of the power and prerogative of the land, but having customs and laws designed for the safety of the king's subjects. It is doubtful that he was a member of the Society of Antiquaries, but he was friendly with many of them, especially William Camden, shared many of their interests, collecting prints, drawings, coins, medals, engraved stones, armour, books, and musical instruments, and was an accomplished Italianist. His fifth son's wife, Anne, recording family tradition about him, writes that he was thought to be popular with Prince Henry, who might have made him a secretary of state, and that he was a skilled breeder of horses. His gardens at Ware Park were praised by Sir Henry Wotton for their fruits, flowers, and herbs, being described as 'a delicate and diligent curiosity, surely without parallel among foreign nations' (Wotton, 196). His income was said to be $4000 per annum and his retinue numerous, but he left no debts and was able to provide $1500 apiece for his five surviving daughters. He died unexpectedly of an apoplexy at Ware on 10 March 1616 and was buried on 19 March in the south aisle of Ware church next to his father. He took care in establishing the reversion to his office so that it could be held in trust for his eldest son. His will, drawn up in 1613, details his religious beliefs, stressing his commitment to the established church, to justification by faith alone but also to the role of works in making faith effectual.

Fanshawe, Sir Richard, first baronet (1608-1666), diplomat and translator, was born in June 1608 at Ware Park, Hertfordshire, and baptized on 12 June, the youngest son of Sir Henry Fanshawe (1569-1616), exchequer official, and his wife, Elizabeth Smythe (1577?-1631). The household into which he was born was on a scale appropriate to a senior royal servant who could trace gentry status back to the medieval Fanshawe family of Derbyshire, but was unusual for the degree to which its master, Fanshawe's father, cultivated the arts. His friend Sir Henry Wotton remarked on his advanced taste in gardening and his horticultural experiments, and the composer John Ward was retained as part of an exceptionally lavish musical establishment. 
Sir Henry Fanshawe died in 1616 leaving his widow in charge of the upbringing of their youngest son, who entered Thomas Farnaby's school in Cripplegate, London, about 1620. Three years later, on 12 November 1623, he was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge, where his tutor, Dr Beale, encouraged his first efforts in poetry. His first datable poem, a Latin ode to the University of Cambridge, gives early evidence of the mastery of Latin for which he was to be famous in later life. Fanshawe did not take a degree and on 22 January 1626 entered the Inner Temple, but 'it seemed so crabbed a study and disagreeable to his inclinations that he rather studyed to obey his mother than to make any progress in the law' ('Memoirs', ed. Loftis, 112). On the death of his mother in 1631 Fanshawe went to Paris, where he lost much of his stock of money gambling with two English exiled priests (despite which he declined to betray one of them whom he recognized, though incognito, in England many years later). He spent about a year in Paris, studying the language, although he never made any translations from the French. After a year he travelled to Madrid and laid the foundations of the mastery of Spanish which was to be central both to his diplomatic career and to his career as a translator of Spanish literature. 
On his return to London two years later Fanshawe's linguistic accomplishments were such that he was appointed secretary to the new ambassador to Madrid, Walter Aston, Lord Aston; he returned to Madrid with his embassy in 1635. The Astons of Tixall, who were to form a significant element in Fanshawe's cultural circle in the 1630s, were a focus over three generations for the collection and dissemination of poetry and translations. From their houses in Staffordshire they circulated manuscripts of verse and songs to their wide network of relations, most of whom were, like themselves, Catholic recusants. It seems likely from the frequent plays on the words 'Constance' and 'Constancie' in Fanshawe's poems and translations of the 1630s, as well as from two poems of compliment dated at Tixall in Staffordshire in the autumn of 1636, that Fanshawe was to some degree attached to Constance Aston, the ambassador's daughter. Certainly, a number of his poems appear in her manuscript commonplace book (Hunt., HM 904). It seems likely that this close acquaintance with a recusant family developed Fanshawe's highly tolerant religious position: although his wife's memoirs, the chief source for his biography, insist on his loyalty to the Church of England, he seems to have been unusually integrated into the court society of Spain and Portugal, and to have numbered many Catholics, in Ireland as well as on the continent, among his close friends. 
It was about this time that the first surviving manuscript collection of Fanshawe's poems (BL, Add. MS 15228) was assembled. Clearly compiled for Fanshawe himself, as his autograph corrections suggest, it ranges from his early Latin ode on leaving Cambridge to the apprentice pieces of his years at the Inner Temple, several of which focus on his dislike of legal study and his preference for literary composition. There are a set of translations of the metrical portions of Boethius's 'De consolatione philosophiae', which he never published, as well as the first attempts at the verse translation of the odes of Horace, which were eventually to be published in 1652. This manuscript also preserves a number of less successful translations from the epigrams of Martial, some of them possibly undertaken in collaboration with Robert Heath ('bap'. 1620, died in or after 1685), the son of the lord chief justice. From this period also there survive a few amatory poems, which were never printed, much in the style of Ben Jonson or of his immediate followers. 
In 1638, once more in Spain, Fanshawe was left as charge d'affaires in Madrid between the departure of Lord Aston and the arrival of the new ambassador, Sir Arthur Hopton, after which he returned to London. No government post was forthcoming, a state of affairs which Lady Fanshawe's memoirs, surely inaccurately, attributes to the hostility of the Catholic secretary of state, Francis Windebank, to the protestant Fanshawe. In any case, Fanshawe was appointed as secretary to the council of war in Ireland, where he appears to have spent the years 1639-41. In the latter year his eldest brother, Sir Thomas Fanshawe (1596-1665), put him into the family post of king's remembrancer, with the proviso that he should either share the income of the post or buy it for himself outright within seven years. 
On the outbreak of hostilities Fanshawe, 'for being the King's sworn servant' ('Memoirs', ed. Loftis, 113), joined the court at Oxford. He seems to have done so out of conviction, as well as out of family loyalty. Before his departure to join the king, John Aubrey records, Fanshawe debated their differences with the convinced parliamentarian poet Thomas May, with whom he had been closely associated in the later 1630s, and on whom he had written a commendatory Latin poem, 'Maius Lucanizans' (which, characteristically, he chose to publish in his patently royalist volume of 1648). On 18 May 1644 Fanshawe married his second cousin and Hertfordshire neighbour Ann Harrison (1625-1680) ['see 'Fanshawe, Ann, Lady Fanshawe] at Wolvercote church near Oxford. The best portrait of Fanshawe, by William Dobson, was probably painted to mark the occasion: it shows the poet holding papers, accompanied by a dog, emblematic of fidelity, with a curious Arcadian background in which a scene from Battista Guarini's immensely popular pastoral tragi-comedy 'Il pastor fido' (of which Fanshawe's eloquent translation was composed presumably in the earlier 1640s) is being enacted. This exceptionally happy marriage, which lasted until Fanshawe's death, is documented in detail in his wife's memoirs. 
About this time a substantial and handsome scribal manuscript of Fanshawe's poems and translations was compiled, perhaps for Edward Conway, Viscount Conway, whose arms are on the binding. This manuscript (Bodl. Oxf., MS Firth c. 1) contains a collection of translations from Horace, in a much more polished form than they are found in the earlier manuscript now in the British Library. There are also a number of translations from the Spanish of Gongora and Argensola. These are stylistically remarkable: the baroque of the Spanish golden age elicits an answering baroque diction from Fanshawe, not wholly dissimilar from the stylistic achievements of Richard Crashaw. 
Late in 1644 Fanshawe was appointed secretary for war to the prince of Wales. The following year he moved with the prince's court from Oxford to Bristol, then to Barnstaple, Devon (by July), Tavistock (by January 1646), Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly (by March), and Jersey (April), at which time a remarkable collection of intellectual and literary supporters of the Stuarts were gathered in the Channel Islands. By the end of the summer Fanshawe was in Caen and his wife in London. He seems for the rest of the year to have acted as a royalist messenger on the continent. In August 1647 he travelled incognito to London, perhaps in connection with the publication that year of his translation of 'Il pastor fido'. His translation emphasized the work's applicability to the contemporary condition of England, placing much hope for the future on the figure of the prince of Wales. In the early autumn Fanshawe visited Charles I at Hampton Court and received instructions (dated 9 October) to go to Spain as Charles's ambassador-extraordinary. He and his wife seem to have got no further than Paris, where they visited Henrietta Maria in September. 
In the last few days of the year Fanshawe returned to England and, his estates having been sequestered, compounded for $300, living privately in London thereafter. The translation of 'Il pastor fido' was reissued in 1648 with a carefully arranged supplement of original poems and translations, all of which might be read in one way or another as texts encouraging, or offering counsel to, the prince of Wales. Among the more significant is a translation of Gongora's sonnet on the fall of a royal favourite, imitated so as to apply to the earl of Strafford, and a translation of book 4 of the 'Aeneid' in Spenserian stanzas which emphasizes parallels between the exiled Aeneas and the exiled Charles Stuart. In September Fanshawe was summoned to attend the prince of Wales and went to Paris in October and thence to Ireland, arriving in Cork by the end of November. Part of Fanshawe's mission to Ireland was to compose and deliver an appeal for support to Lord Inchiquin. It may also be conjectured that his accomplishments as a Latinist commended him for diplomatic duty in a country where Latin would seem to have been the chief medium of communication between the English and the native aristocracy. 
The Fanshawes seem to have spent most of 1649 in Ireland, until the arrival of instructions from the exiled prince of Wales, now the uncrowned Charles II, in a letter dated 20/30 August, ordering Fanshawe again to Spain, to meet Sir Edward Hyde and Lord Cottington at San Sebastian. In February 1650 the Fanshawes sailed from Galway to Malaga, where they arrived by the end of March; they then went on to Madrid, where they remained until July. In the autumn they travelled via San Sebastian and Paris to Calais, where they parted on 9/19 November, Lady Fanshawe travelling to London while Fanshawe travelled via the Netherlands to join Charles II's forlorn campaign in Scotland. On his arrival he was created baronet. 
Fanshawe followed the king through the campaign until its ignominious end at the battle of Worcester in September 1651. Taken prisoner, he was sent to London and kept in custody until his wife obtained his release on grounds of ill health in November. He appears to have agreed at this point not to publish any political writings. He continued in ill health for the first half of 1652, during which time the first issue of his substantial translation of the odes, epodes, and satires of Horace was printed as 'Selected Parts of Horace, Prince of Lyricks'. After his recovery and a convalescent journey to Bath in August a second, much corrected, issue of 'Selected Parts of Horace' appeared. In March 1653 the Fanshawes took up residence, for the one brief period of stability which their lives afforded, at Tankersley Park near Sheffield. In a remarkable burst of literary energy it was here that Fanshawe translated most extensively from modern peninsular literature. He made fluent English versions of a long, baroque court entertainment from the Spain of the earlier years of Philip IV, 'Querer por solo querer' and 'Fiestas de Aranjuez', and of the national poem of Portugal by Luis de Camoes, the latter published as 'The Lusiad' in 1655 and a portion translated into Virgilian hexameters. It may be conjectured that he also completed here the greater part of his superb translation into Latin of John Fletcher's 'The Faithful Shepherdess', first published in 1658 as 'La fida pastora' together with a collection of Fanshawe's previously published Latin poems. However, in the late summer of 1654, a daughter, Ann, died, lamented greatly by both parents, and they removed to Huntingdonshire. For the next few years they lived in rented houses and lodgings, never in very good health. 
After the death of Oliver Cromwell in September 1658 Fanshawe seems to have decided to rejoin Charles II in exile: he travelled to Paris in November and was appointed as Charles's secretary of the Latin tongue in June the following year, by which time his wife had joined him. By April 1660 Fanshawe was with Charles's court in Breda, and was knighted there, having already been appointed master of the requests, although later in the same year he failed to secure the position of one of the secretaries of state. 
At the king's return to England in May the Fanshawes returned in his train and took lodgings in Portugal Row in London. In the Restoration parliament, Fanshawe was elected MP for Cambridge University. On 23 August he received (presumably secret) instructions from Charles to gather information on Portugal's international position, and at the end of the same month he received a letter which appointed him temporary ordinary ambassador with the duties also of an envoy-extraordinary to conclude the negotiations for the marriage between Charles and Catherine of Braganza. He departed for Lisbon in September, returning to London in December. In this year, the greater part of Fanshawe's Horatian volume was reissued by Alexander Brome as part of his 'Poems of Horace'. 
In 1662, after having attended the royal wedding, Fanshawe was once again sent as ambassador to Portugal. Letters confirming his appointment were dispatched in August and Fanshawe and his family departed for Lisbon the same month. The fair-copy manuscript of the Latin versions from Camoes (Fundacao da Casa de Braganza, Villa Vicosa, Portugal) was probably completed in Lisbon during 1663. In August Fanshawe was again recalled to England, arriving in London in early September. He was appointed a privy councillor on 21 September and sworn in on 2 October. 
Early in 1664 Fanshawe was appointed ambassador to Spain, a post which was to prove his last. With letters of credence from Charles II to Philip IV dated 13 January he left for Madrid on 21 January, with his family and a household which included the future dramatist William Wycherley and the lyric poet and emblematist Philip Ayres. After landing at Cadiz on 7 March, they travelled overland with full ambassadorial ceremony and were settled at Madrid by 16 August in the Casa de las Siete Chimeneas. During 1665 Fanshawe negotiated a peace treaty between England and Spain, and the 'articles for the adjustment between Spaine and Portugal'. The treaty was signed by him and by the duke of Medina de las Torres on 17 December but was not ratified. Although Fanshawe's household protested that a draft had been sent to London allowing ample time for a reply, it was held in England that Fanshawe had exceeded his instructions. As a result of this, Fanshawe had barely returned to Madrid from his last journey to Portugal in March 1666 when he received his letters of recall and learned that the earl of Sandwich had been appointed in his place. Sandwich delivered his letters of revocation on arrival in Madrid in May. On the 5/15 of June Fanshawe was taken ill with an 'ague' which turned to 'a malignant fever'. He died eleven days later, at las Siete Chimeneas; his funeral was held according to Anglican custom in the embassy and his body was embalmed, then transported back to England to a place of temporary burial in All Hallows Church, Hertford, before permanent interment in St Mary's Church, Ware. 
Fanshawe's translation of 'Querer por solo querer' was issued posthumously, for private circulation in 1670 and commercially in 1671. His one surviving son, Richard, who had been born in Madrid in 1665, died in 1694. A number of Fanshawe's diplomatic letters were issued in 1702 as 'Original Letters of his Excellency Sir Richard Fanshawe', while his wife's detailed memoirs were first published in 1829. Much original evidence of his life survives: a significant volume of correspondence; despite many depredations, a substantial quantity of his loose papers at Valence House, Dagenham; several copies of his printed works with his autograph corrections; two fair-copy manuscripts of his earlier poems; and the presentation copy of his Latin version of Camoes. Thus it is possible to trace in detail both his uncommon linguistic abilities and their deployment and the narrative of the colossal fortunes which his and his wife's families sank in various forms of support for the Stuarts, of which only a fragment ever returned to them, either as money or as any other form of reward.

Fanshawe, Thomas (c.1533-1601), exchequer official, was the eldest son of John Fanshawe, a minor landowner of Fanshaw Gate in Derbyshire; his mother was either Mary Rowland or Margaret Eyre. Tradition has him educated at Jesus College, Cambridge. It was probably early in Edward VI's reign that he went to London to be a clerk to his uncle Henry Fanshawe, at that time one of the eight sworn clerks in the king's remembrancer's office. By the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, he was trusted by Treasurer Winchester and by other principal officers with various confidential matters. Henry Fanshawe became queen's remembrancer, and Thomas, who obtained the reversion of the position in July 1568, succeeded his uncle who died on 28 October 1568. Thomas also took over Henry's lease of the house in Warwick Lane which was his private office. He was then in a position to marry, his first wife being Mary, daughter of Anthony Bourchier of Barnsley, Gloucestershire. After her death (9 June 1578), Thomas married Joan (died 1622), third daughter of Thomas 'Customer' Smythe. They had a son, Thomas Fanshawe, who became a government official. He was also invited to join the Middle Temple in 1571. 
The office of queen's remembrancer was one of the three key administrative elements in the upper exchequer. Audit business was split between the queen's remembrancer and the lord treasurer's remembrancer in such a way that Fanshawe oversaw customs and subsidies, and had some responsibility for land and the growing exchequer equity cases. The routine work was handled by the sworn clerks; the remembrancer himself was often out and about on 'foreign' business. He was frequently called on to give advice to the treasurer or the chancellor and under-treasurer. Whether it was he or Peter Osborne who 'wrote' the account of Exchequer practice (eventually published as 'The Practice of the Exchequer Court') for William Cecil in 1572 is a complex issue. Both were trusted advisers and were often left to arbitrate together in such sensitive matters as the Chester customs office, a long-running dispute which they first heard in 1577. 
Fanshawe was committed to religious reformation as embodied in the Church of England, and he was a member of the southern ecclesiastical commission for many years. His commitment to reform made him a strong advocate of education. In 1579 he fulfilled his uncle's bequest to have a school erected at Dronfield near the family home. He employed Alexander Richardson as a family tutor for his children, and left money in his will for his continued support. Fanshaw sat in nearly every parliament of Elizabeth's reign -- for Rye in 1571, for Arundel in 1572, 1584, 1586, and 1589, and for Much Wenlock in 1597, probably himself seeking the membership. He was regularly appointed to committees where exchequer input would be valuable, such as those dealing with a 'Bill for Tellers and Receivers' (1572) and bills on land and sheriffs (1576); but he did not consider himself a placeman. In 1584, when his appointment to a committee on reducing officers' fees was challenged, he responded: 'I am come hither as a commonwealth man and not as an officer. If any man envy my gains, I would he had it. I see not why I may not be a committee [man] that am a clerk to lose by it as Mr Recorder to be [a committee man] who is shortly to be a judge and gaine by it. (Hartley, 2.118)' Ann Fanshawe records a family tradition that Queen Elizabeth said of Thomas that 'he was the best officer of accounts she had and a person of great integrity'. Nevertheless, he was able to raise his family to a position of considerable wealth and influence. In 1575 he purchased Ware Park near Hertford which was to be the family home for over a century. He died on 19 February 1601 at Warwick Lane and was buried in the south aisle of Ware church on 19 March. Although he had asked for no pomp, the funeral was conducted with suitable gravity and the heralds in attendance. He left Ware Park to his wife, Joan, and his son, Henry Fanshawe. Joan, apparently of unsound mind, died in 1622 and was buried at Ware Park.

Fanshawe, Thomas, first Viscount Fanshawe of Dromore (1596-1665), exchequer official, was the eldest son of Sir Henry Fanshawe (1569-1616) and Elizabeth (1577?-1631), youngest daughter of customer Thomas Smythe, and was born on 16 November 1596. Apparently less brilliant than his father and uncle, or his brother Richard Fanshawe, he was given an MA degree at Cambridge in 1624 at the king's request. The office of king's remembrancer, previously held by his father, was held in trust while he went to France in 1618 to finish his education. In 1619 he was sworn in and although he evidently carried out his duties adequately, he was overshadowed as a financial adviser by his uncle, also Thomas Fanshawe. His sister-in-law Ann Fanshawe praised him moderately as 'a very worthy, valiant, honest, good natured gentleman, charitable and generous, and had excellent naturall parts, yet cholerick and rash; which was onely incommode to his own domestick family'. His devotion to Charles I was unswerving and he was rewarded with creation as a knight of the Bath at Charles's coronation on 2 February 1626. He was a devout member of the Church of England, and an interesting account survives of the consecrating of his chapel at Ware Park, Hertfordshire, by the bishop of Durham. His first marriage, on 23 September 1627 to Anne ('bap'. 1607, died 1628), daughter of Giles Alington, a powerful Hertfordshire neighbour, gave him a distant link to the Cecils; his second marriage, on 24 June 1629 to Elizabeth ('bap'. 1609, died 1668), daughter of Sir William Cokayne, brought him a $10,000 dowry, and the couple had nine sons, and seven daughters. Fanshawe was active in local government and took a paternal interest in the welfare of the poor, for example protesting at the sudden reorganization of Christ's Hospital (near Newgate), which was responsible for 1000 orphans who were mostly put out to nurse; when those at Ware were recalled to London, their nurses were obliged to travel with them. 
Fanshawe sat for Hertford in every parliament from 1624 to 1641. In December 1640 on the question of the six judges' impeachment he gave his opinion that the House of Commons articles were destructive to the fundamental laws of the realm and the subject's right of property, and contrary to former resolutions in parliament and to the petition of right. In 1641 he voted against the bill for the attainder of Strafford and in 1642 he was expelled from the parliament. He gave unquestioned allegiance to the royalist cause and came under attack for misuse of office. It was suggested that he wrongly admitted his personal clerks and assistants to practise as attorneys on the legal side of the exchequer. As there was the usual family reversion, he relinquished his office to his brother Richard. Richard's delinquency, however, saw the office temporarily lost to the family. His brother, Sir Simon (died 1680), thought that there was 'much animosity against his whole family' ('Seventh Report', HMC, 137b). 
Thomas Fanshawe fought on the royalist side at Edgehill in 1642 and was subsequently at either the king's or Prince Charles's side. In June and July 1643 he and others lent Charles $27,400 on the security of the New Forest, Sherwood Forest, Clarendon Park, and Bowood Park. For a time he was the prince's secretary and as such used in various sensitive missions. He took ships to the Scillies when the prince fled there. In 1649 Charles II gave him a grant from Jersey augmenting his arms. He was abroad with the king at some point since in December 1660 an act naturalizing one of his children had to be obtained. On 13 November 1648 however he petitioned to be allowed to compound for his estate and compounded for $1300. After 1652 he seems to have lived quietly at Ware. Nevertheless, when royalist plans were being developed in 1659 it was taken for granted that he would be involved. Subsequently, he was arrested and his eldest son was sent to the Tower for involvement in a royalist rising (the Booth plot). At the Restoration he was created Viscount Fanshawe of Dromore in the Irish peerage on 5 September 1661. The recovery of the office of king's remembrancer was achieved by a new patent. It brought a comfortable income but it was less valuable than it had been and less influential. While the routine practices were re-established the financial bureaucratic structure was changing. His advice was only sought on matters of routine and much was clearly done by deputy. He was elected MP for Hertfordshire in 1661 and became an active parliamentarian particularly concerned with religious bills. 
Fanshawe's personal finances were, however, in dire straits. After 1660 his office was probably worth less than the $1,000 per annum at which it was estimated in the 1630s. Records suggest a certain income of around $250 plus reduced casual amounts, many of the new taxes not making sufficient allowance for the routine exchequer fees. Despite his good will, Charles II did not have the money to repay his father's debts and although warrants were issued they were not paid. Ever loyal, Fanshawe had none the less obediently stripped himself of his legal rights over the New Forest. He died intestate at Hatton Gardens, London, on 26 March 1665, from apoplexy, and was buried on 30 March at Ware. Administration was granted on 23 June 1667 and finalized on 29 May 1671. Perhaps recognizing how shabbily the Fanshawes had been treated, Charles II, who apparently said he had lost the best of men and subjects, granted his widow, Elizabeth, and her heirs an annuity of $600 for thirty-one years. 
Fanshawe's sons were all members of the dissolute Stuart court, participating in the high stakes, sports, and gambling. A letter tells the story of a sudden bet between Fanshawe's son, Sir Thomas, and Sir John Morton on the road from Ware to London, in the company of Lord Fanshawe which produced a jape 'for which King and Duke laughed not a little' ('Seventh Report', HMC, 487b). They did not have the resources to support this lifestyle.

Thomas Fanshawe, second Viscount Fanshawe of Dromore (1632-1674), courtier and exchequer official, who had been deeply involved in the restoration of Charles II, was said by Clarendon to be a rash, foolish, and hotheaded man, although Ann Fanshawe thought him 'of excellent understanding, and of great honour and honesty'. In the 1650s the family estate of Ware Park, now worth $1652 per annum, was made over to him, and in return he sold most of the considerable inheritance in Hertfordshire of his childless first wife, Catherine Ferrers (d. 1660), apparently to meet his father's debts. He was active as MP for Hertford in the Cavalier Parliament and a strong supporter of the Church of England. When he inherited the office of king's remembrancer his advice was sought on administrative matters and he evidently carried out many of its duties in person. Nevertheless, his finances declined and in 1668 he sold Ware Park. At his death in 1674 his son Evelyn was a minor and the Treasury had to consider the various letters patent by which the Fanshawes had sought to secure the office. His unmarried brothers, despite their education, legal training, and apparently their exchequer knowledge, could obtain no more than minor positions. Charles was a commissioner for revenue (1670-76) and for excise appeals (1676-89), Henry registrar to the king's remembrancer. Under Charles II, seeking offices where they could, they were scorned by the parvenu Pepys, who described Henry (1634-1685) as a witty but rascally fellow. Such words hardly fitted Charles (1643-1710), who had been a soldier and envoy to Portugal for Charles II, and after his nephew Evelyn's death in 1687 became fourth viscount and king's remembrancer. True to the family, in 1689 he voted against the declaration, declared that the throne was not vacant, refused the oath to William III and was sent to the Tower. On his release he was a comparative nonentity. He died in 1710 and with the death of his youngest brother, Simon, in 1716 the viscountcy became extinct.

Faraday, Michael (1791-1867), natural philosopher, scientific adviser, and Sandemanian, was born on 22 September 1791 in Newington Butts, Surrey, the third of four children of James Faraday (1761-1810), blacksmith, and his wife, Margaret (1764-1838), daughter of Michael Hastwell, farmer of Mallestang near Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland. Faraday's father had been born at Clapham, Yorkshire, but had moved to Outhgill near Kirkby Stephen where he met his wife, who was then in service; they married on 11 June 1786. James Faraday and all his children belonged to the small Christian sect called in Scotland the Glasites after their founder, John Glas, and in England the Sandemanians, after Robert Sandeman, who had brought some dissident Inghamite congregations in north-west England into the Glasite fold. In February 1791 James Faraday joined the London Sandemanian congregation after moving south with his family by 1788 -- possibly with the assistance of the Sandemanian community, since he found employment as a blacksmith with James Boyd, a Sandemanian ironmonger of Welbeck Street, London. The Faradays shortly moved to Gilbert Street and about 1796 to Jacob's Mews. 
Little is known of Faraday's early life. In an autobiographical fragment he commented that 'my education was of the most ordinary description, consisting of little more than the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic at a common day-school. My hours out of school were passed at home and in the streets' (Jones, 1st edn, 1.9). In 1804 he became an errand boy, delivering among other things newspapers, for the bookseller George Riebau of 2 Blandford Street. In October 1805, at the age of fourteen, he was indentured for seven years to Riebau as an apprentice bookbinder and moved into Blandford Street. Faraday's parents moved in 1809 to 18 Weymouth Street, where the following year, James Faraday died. 
During his apprenticeship Faraday cultivated an enthusiasm for chemistry. In the bindery he read books such as Jane Marcet's 'Conversations on Chemistry', and he also read Isaac Watt's 'Improvement of the Mind', the advice of which he sought to follow, for instance in letter-writing to clarify ideas. He also attended lectures on scientific topics at a number of places, but particularly the City Philosophical Society which met at 53 Dorset Street, the home of the silversmith John Tatum ('c'.1772-1858). There he formed lifelong friendships with, for example, Benjamin Abbott (1793-1870), whose correspondence with Faraday is a unique source of information on his life in the 1810s, Edward Magrath ('c'.1791-1861), who later became secretary of the Athenaeum, and the chemist Richard Phillips. In the spring of 1812, the year his apprenticeship ended, William Dance, a customer of Riebau's, gave Faraday tickets to attend four lectures to be delivered by the professor of chemistry at the Royal Institution, Humphry Davy. (These were Davy's last lectures as he soon after married a wealthy widow, Jane Apreece, and was thus able to retire from his professorship.) 
Faraday had become so interested in science that by the end of his apprenticeship he resolved to abandon his career as a journeyman bookbinder and, instead, sought a scientific career. This was an unusual ambition at a time when, outside medicine, there was no career structure for science in England. As he later wrote: 'The desire to be engaged in scientific occupation, even though of the lowest kind, induced me, whilst an apprentice, to write, in my ignorance of the world and simplicity of my mind, to Sir Joseph Banks, then President of the Royal Society. Naturally enough, 'no answer' was the reply left with the porter. (Jones, 1st edn, 1.14-15)' Faraday next turned his attention to Davy, to whom he sent neat notes of the lectures he had attended. Davy interviewed Faraday and advised him to 'Attend to the book binding' (James, 'Correspondence', 1. letter 30), adding that he would bear Faraday in mind in the future. In late October 1812 Davy's sight was affected in a laboratory explosion and he employed Faraday as his amanuensis. Nevertheless, Faraday did begin a career as a bookbinder with Henri De La Roche. 
In February 1813 William Payne, the laboratory assistant at the Royal Institution, was sacked following a fight in the lecture theatre. Davy was asked by the managers of the institution to find a replacement; he remembered Faraday, called him for a second interview, and after telling him 'that Science was a harsh mistress' and smiling at Faraday's 'notion of the superior moral feelings of philosophic men' (James, 'Correspondence', 1. letter 419), appointed him to the position. Faraday moved into the Royal Institution and for the next six months began what was in effect a second apprenticeship, this time in chemistry. 
In October Faraday agreed to accompany Davy, as his assistant, on a tour of the continent. Davy had obtained a special passport from Napoleon stipulating that he could be accompanied only by his wife and two others. With Jane Davy requiring a maid, Davy (claiming that his valet had suddenly withdrawn) asked Faraday to undertake the tasks of a valet, making a promise, never fulfilled, to find a valet once they were on the continent. Faraday reluctantly agreed but this was the source of considerable friction between him and Jane Davy, who regarded him as a servant. For eighteen months they toured France, Switzerland, Italy, and southern Germany visiting many chemical laboratories. They met, among others, Andre-Marie Ampere in Paris, Charles-Gaspard and Arthur-Auguste De La Rive in Geneva, and the aged Alessandro Volta in Italy. Davy demonstrated the elemental nature of iodine to the French and in Florence showed that diamond was composed of carbon using the burning-glass of the duke of Tuscany. They witnessed the end of Napoleon's empire but following Napoleon's escape from Elba for the hundred days Davy decided to cut short the tour and returned to England in the middle of April 1815. 
Faraday was re-employed at the Royal Institution as a laboratory assistant, working mainly under the new professor of chemistry, William Thomas Brande. He prepared the demonstrations for Brande's lectures and also helped him edit the 'Quarterly Journal of Science'. Davy, however, continued to exert considerable influence at the Royal Institution. Faraday assisted him in the period immediately following their return with inventing the miners' safety lamp; indeed the manuscripts of Davy's papers on the lamp in the 'Philosophical Transactions' are largely in Faraday's hand. Thus from his earliest time in science Faraday was concerned with practical problems. 
Faraday also rejoined the City Philosophical Society, where he delivered his first lectures. Although this society was proscribed under the terms of the 'Seditious Meetings Act' in 1817, the proscription was quickly lifted. However, the society was never as active thereafter and many members, including Faraday, joined the Society of Arts which had not been proscribed. There he played a major role on its chemistry committee, jointly chairing it for most of the period between 1826 and 1838, along with two other former members of the City Philosophical Society. In 1848 he declined to be nominated vice-president of the Society of Arts, but in 1866 he was the third recipient of its Albert medal. 
Since the Royal Institution had the best-equipped laboratory in Britain those seeking professional scientific advice frequently consulted Davy, Brande, and Faraday. For example, between 1818 and 1822 Faraday and James Stodart (1760-1823) worked on alloy steels and in the 1820s he analysed large quantities of gunpowders for the East India Company. Professional chemists often provided expert testimony in court cases -- Faraday gave evidence in the famous Severn and King insurance case in 1820 and also in a number of patent and pollution cases. In 1834 Faraday gave up most of his court work and in 1836 most of his professional business. In later periods he frequently undertook analyses gratis for one reason or another, and he reminded those who asked for professional advice that by declining such work he had given up a considerable income. Although most of his professional work was chemically mundane, in 1825 while analysing some oil-gas he discovered a new compound of hydrogen and carbon which he named bicarburet of hydrogen. In 1834 Eilhard Mitscherlich undertook the first careful studies of the properties of this compound and renamed it benzene. 
The year 1821 was perhaps the most important in Faraday's life: on 21 May he was appointed acting superintendent of the house of the Royal Institution; on 12 June he married Sarah Barnard (1800-1879), daughter of the Sandemanian silversmith Edward Barnard (1767-1855); on 15 July he made his confession of faith in the Sandemanian church; and on 3-4 September he made his first major scientific discovery -- that of electromagnetic rotations. After their marriage, Sarah Faraday moved into the Royal Institution. From the evidence that has survived (and a great deal of personal material clearly did not), the Faradays' marriage appears to have been happy and she was very supportive. Although they had no children, at least two nieces lived with them in the Royal Institution for extended periods, Margery Ann Reid (1815-1888) between about 1826 and 1840 and from the early 1850s Jane Barnard (1832-1911). As superintendent Faraday was responsible for maintaining the fabric of the building, including overseeing the addition of the Corinthian column facade in 1837. In his declining years, both Sarah Faraday and Jane Barnard helped Faraday with his duties. 
By making his confession of faith Faraday pledged to practise Christianity with literalist purity and live his life in Christian brotherhood according to the 'Bible' in imitation of Christ's perfect thoughts and deeds. When in London he would attend church (in Paul's Alley until 1862, and then in Barnsbury Grove) on Sundays and also on Wednesday evenings. In his scientific practice Faraday recognized that he was uncovering the laws of nature that God had written into the universe at the creation. Though he wrote to Ada Lovelace in 1844 that 'There is no philosophy in my religion' (James, 'Correspondence', 3. letter 1631), there was plenty of religion in his philosophy. It was in his lectures, rather than his published papers, that Faraday publicly stated his theistic view of the universe. For instance, in 1846 he claimed that the properties of matter 'depend upon the power with which the Creator has gifted such matter' ('London Medical Gazette', 2, 1846, 977) and in an 1858 lecture on the electric telegraph he concluded: 'for, by enabling the mind to apply the natural power through law, it conveys the gifts of God to man' ('Proceedings of the Royal Institution', 2, 1858, 560). In his scientific practice such religious beliefs found expression in his views on subjects such as the economy of nature, the simplicity of causes, the interconvertibility of forces, the desire to apply scientific knowledge to the common good, and the brotherhood of men of science. 
In 1820 Hans Christian Oersted discovered that a compass needle could be deflected by a wire carrying an electric current. This new phenomenon, electromagnetism, was rapidly taken up by men of science throughout Europe, including Ampere who developed a theory of electromagnetism based on mathematical analysis which he called electrodynamics. In London, Davy and William Hyde Wollaston, who was interregnum president of the Royal Society between Banks's death and Davy's election in November 1820, also turned their attention to this newly discovered phenomenon. By the middle of 1821 so much had been published on electromagnetism that Phillips, as editor of the 'Annals of Philosophy', asked Faraday to review the literature. Faraday did so, and in the course of repeating many of the experiments, discovered, on 3-4 September, that a vertically mounted wire carrying an electric current would rotate continuously round a magnet protruding from a bowl of mercury. This phenomenon, which Faraday called electromagnetic rotation, showed that it was possible to produce continuous motion from the interaction of electricity and magnetism; it was thus the principle behind the electric motor. This discovery strengthened Faraday's scepticism about the value of mathematics in describing nature. Ampere's theory had claimed to provide a complete description of electromagnetism, but Faraday had found a phenomenon not predicted by Ampere. In a letter to Mary Somerville in 1833, Faraday used this example to contrast the success of his experimental approach and the limitations of Ampere's mathematically based approach. 
Within a month of his discovery rumours were circulating that Faraday had used some experimental work of both Davy and Wollaston without due acknowledgement. Faraday, just turned thirty, was disturbed by these rumours and was able to satisfy both Davy and Wollaston as to the propriety of his conduct, but this episode provided a foretaste of what was to come. In March 1823 Faraday performed an experiment, suggested by Davy, which unexpectedly resulted in chlorine being liquefied. Much to Davy's annoyance Faraday published this result. This episode contributed to Davy's opposition to Faraday's election to fellowship of the Royal Society to which he was nominated by Phillips in May 1823. Davy asked Faraday to take down the certificate, which he refused to do, and Davy became angry. Nevertheless Faraday was elected in early 1824, but, as he put it, he was thereafter 'by no means in the same relation as to scientific communication with Sir Humphry Davy' (Jones, 1st edn, 1.353). 
Davy subsequently took advantage of Faraday's undoubted abilities, with little consideration as to whether he was acting in Faraday's best interests. Faraday did the follow-up experiments for Davy's electrochemical method to protect the copper sheeting of ships for the Admiralty, which ended in disaster and a serious loss of reputation for Davy. Through Davy, Faraday was appointed the first secretary of the Athenaeum, which involved him in writing a large number of letters during the early months of 1824; when the club was established and could offer a salary to its secretary, Faraday immediately passed the position on to Magrath. On the positive side, Davy was instrumental in appointing Faraday director of the laboratory in the Royal Institution in 1825. 
Faraday spent much of the 1820s helping run the Royal Institution. He assisted Brande with his lectures there to medical students and from 1824 he and Brande jointly delivered the lectures. In 1826 Faraday founded the Friday evening discourses, which, though mainly for members of the Royal Institution, rapidly became, through newspaper reports, an important vehicle for diffusing knowledge of the latest scientific and technological developments. Originally they were fairly informal lectures but by the 1840s they had become very formal affairs indeed. In total Faraday delivered 123 discourses. He also established, in 1826, the Christmas lectures for children, of which he gave nineteen series. In addition, from 1827 he delivered an annual series of Saturday afternoon lectures after Easter on chemical or physical topics. Though most of Faraday's lectures were delivered within the institution, in early 1827 he also delivered a course of twelve lectures to the London Institution on chemical manipulation. Later that year he turned these lectures into his only book conceived as a single entity, 'Chemical Manipulation' (2nd edn, 1830; 3rd edn, 1842). 
In the late 1820s the most serious impediment to Faraday's pursuing research was his involvement (at Davy's instigation) in the time-consuming work of the joint Royal Society-board of longitude committee to improve optical glass. This committee was established in 1824 as a move to prevent the abolition of the board of longitude, of which Davy was chairman. The board, established in 1714, was a likely candidate for abolition since the problem of finding longitude at sea had been solved; Davy, by suggesting it should improve optical glass, provided a reason to continue its existence. Initially Faraday's involvement was restricted to supervising the manufacture of the glass by Pellatt and Green. By 1827 the results were proving unsatisfactory and so Faraday agreed to make the glass in a furnace built at the Royal Institution. Over the next two years he made a total of 215 pieces of glass, the time he thus spent occupying roughly two-thirds of what was available for research. One lasting benefit to Faraday of this project was that Charles Anderson ('c'.1790-1866) joined him as an assistant. A former sergeant in the Royal Artillery, Anderson continued to work with Faraday until the 1860s. 
The unsatisfactory results of the glass work, together with the low esteem in which the Admiralty held Davy, contributed to the abolition of the board of longitude in July 1828. In its place, as recognition of the importance of science, the Admiralty founded a scientific advisory committee at the end of 1828, comprising Faraday, Thomas Young, and Edward Sabine; Faraday gave advice to the Admiralty until at least the Crimean War. 
To ensure that he would never again be put into the position of having to undertake projects such as the glass work, Faraday secured for himself, in mid-1829, the professorship of chemistry at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich, a post which he held until 1852. For delivering twenty-five lectures annually to the cadets, Faraday received $200, which provided him with some economic independence from the Royal Institution. Although these lectures occupied his time for two days a week during the academy's terms, this was significantly less than he had spent working on glass. A whole generation of officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers grew up learning their chemistry from Faraday. 
Following Davy's death in Geneva in 1829 Faraday ceased the glass work and expressed to the Royal Society his anger that his time had been wasted, which had prevented him from making experimental discoveries. This claim was fully vindicated on 29 August 1831 when he discovered electromagnetic induction. Natural philosophers since Oersted had believed that, on analogy with electrostatic induction, electromagnetic induction should exist. Although it appears that Ampere had observed it in 1822, his theoretical views prevented him from realizing the significance of his observation. Faraday also sought the phenomenon sporadically during the 1820s. He made his discovery in 1831 by winding and insulating two coils of wire on opposite sides of a soft-iron ring. This device was not an easy one to construct and it has been found, by replicating the way that Faraday would have built it, that it takes about ten working days to construct. When he passed an electric current into one coil, a transient electric current was induced in the other; when the primary circuit was broken, the current in the secondary flowed transiently in the opposite direction. These observations led him to propose that matter when electrified was in a special state which he named the 'electrotonic' state, though he soon abandoned this idea. Very quickly after this discovery, Faraday found how electricity could be generated by passing a magnet in and out of a helix wound with wire. These devices were, in effect, the first transformer and dynamo. This work of Faraday's was widely viewed from the end of the nineteenth century as laying the foundation of the practical use of electricity. 
With this work Faraday also perfected his methodical way of recording and keeping control of his experimental results. On 25 August 1832 he commenced numbering the paragraphs of his laboratory notebook in a sequence that would conclude on 6 March 1860 with paragraph 16,041. He would cross-refer between entries and on at least two occasions he compiled indexes allowing him quickly to locate the results of experiments conducted many years previously. Faraday published his induction work in the first of a series of papers with the overarching title 'Experimental Researches in Electricity'. The papers were nearly all published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' and their paragraphs also were sequentially numbered ending with paragraph 3430 of series thirty in 1856. 
After his discovery of electromagnetic induction Faraday's fame as a natural philosopher began to grow. His importance was recognized at the second meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science held in Oxford in 1832, when the university conferred the degree of DCL on Faraday, David Brewster, John Dalton, and Robert Brown. Since they were all dissenters, members of what was about to become the Tractarian movement, such as John Henry Newman, condemned the university's action. In early 1833 John Fuller (1757-1834) endowed the Royal Institution to found the Fullerian professorships of chemistry and physiology on the condition that Faraday would be the first holder of the chemistry chair. 
Faraday's production of electricity from magnetism added to the already known sources of electricity: chemical, static, thermal, and animal. Before he could proceed further with his work on electricity, he had to establish to his own satisfaction whether electricity from these different sources was the same entity. Thus during 1832 he turned his attention to establishing the identity of electricities. Using various tests for the presence of electricity such as physiological effects, magnetic effects, the production of chemical action and sparks, and a few others, Faraday showed that most electricities produced all or most of these phenomena. On this basis Faraday asserted that all electricity, from whatever source, was the same entity. 
In the course of the experiments which showed that all electricities produced chemical action, Faraday came to doubt both the theory of electrochemical action that had been proposed by Davy and also the two-fluid theory of electricity. By mid-1833 he had come to view electricity as an axis of power, rather than as a fluid. In contrast to Davy's view that the action occurred at the poles of a solution undergoing decomposition, Faraday concluded that the action occurred in the solution itself. Furthermore, he showed in 1833 that the amount of chemical action caused by a current passing through a solution was directly related to the quantity of electricity, and that the masses of the products evolved, deposited, or dissolved were proportional to their chemical equivalents. One result of this electrochemical work was that Faraday, in conjunction with Whitlock Nicholl and William Whewell, developed a new language for electrochemistry. According to this nomenclature, the process became known as electrolysis and occurred in an electrolyte; poles became electrodes which were either anodes or cathodes; the electrolyte decomposed into cations or anions, or, more generally, ions. 
In his experiments, which measured the quantity of electricity, Faraday sometimes found that results did not agree. Eventually he discovered that chemical reactions took place on the surface of very clean platinum even when no electricity was passing. To explain this phenomenon (named catalysis by Jons Jakob Berzelius in 1836), Faraday proposed an elaborate theory of inter-particle forces. He soon realized that he was theorizing without sufficient experimental evidence and abandoned the theory. This was his first concerted attempt to deal with the problems surrounding the nature of matter. By the end of 1833 Faraday had ceased to believe in atoms, remarking that 'although it is very easy to talk of atoms, it is very difficult to form a clear idea of their nature' ('PTRS', 124, 1834, 121). On a visit to Dublin in June 1834 he expressed his antagonistic views on atomism and the fluid theory of electricity to William Rowan Hamilton, who was surprised to find that Faraday held views almost as anti-materialistic as his own. 
Following his rejection of the fluid theory of electricity, Faraday was thinking carefully about the nature of charge and of electricity generally. Indeed there is a gap of more than two years between series ten and eleven of his 'Experimental Researches in Electricity' during which he considered the problem. As a step towards its resolution, in January 1836 he built what is now known as the 'Faraday cage' in the lecture theatre of the Royal Institution. This was a 12 ft cube covered with wire which isolated electrically the space inside the cage from the rest of the universe. The cage allowed Faraday to argue by experimental demonstration against the prevailing notion of absolute charge and for a view that what was observed as charge depended on the electrical state of the observer. It thus permitted him to develop further arguments against the fluid theory and for electricity's being a power between contiguous particles. In this context he introduced the term dielectric (again at the suggestion of Whewell). So radical was Faraday's reconceptualization of the nature of electricity that Joseph Henry wrote to him saying that if the suggestions had come from anyone else, they would have been met with scepticism. With this work Faraday appears consciously to have brought to a conclusion a programme of research, since he published in 1839 his fourteen papers 'Experimental Researches in Electricity' in a volume of the same title. He did, however, continue his electrical work by examining the electricity produced by an electric eel in the Adelaide Gallery and addressing the problem of how the battery produced its electricity. 
Although Faraday had given up much of his professional chemical work during the 1830s, his time was taken up by new activities. For example, in 1831, doubtless obeying the biblical injunction of 'James' 1:27, Faraday became a subscriber of the London Orphan Asylum, a cause he supported into the 1860s. Each subscriber had one or more votes (depending on the size of the subscription) for suitable candidates for a place in the orphanage, which was in Clapton. Votes could be transferred by proxy between subscribers. Faraday occasionally helped orphans of fellow Sandemanians or employees of the Royal Institution gain a place in the orphanage and in turn he was frequently approached by other subscribers for his proxy to aid them with their particular orphan. In 1832 Faraday and his brother Robert (1788-1846) were appointed deacons in the London Sandemanian church. This position, which testifies to the Sandemanian congregation's unanimous view of Faraday's high moral character, entailed dealing with the physical needs of the community such as visiting the sick and poor and running the church building. Faraday took his duties seriously and, for instance, cancelled some of his lectures in 1837 so that he could look after his brother-in-law William Barnard (1801-1848), who was seriously ill. 
One of the characteristics of a Sandemanian is a distancing from party politics and Faraday was careful not to become embroiled in them; as he owned neither house nor land he never had the vote. He was always careful to point out that he was not a knight on the (fairly frequent) occasions when he was referred to as 'Sir Michael' and he generally added that he would never accept a knighthood; there is, however, no evidence that he was ever offered one. Faraday viewed such honours as an integral part of the system of party politics rather than as an honour to science. However he did accept membership of the Prussian order of merit (1842) and the French Legion d'honneur (1855), which he believed were for his work. 
The difficulties Faraday experienced in distancing himself from party politics were most apparent during discussions concerning the award to him of an annual civil-list pension of $300. Apparently at the prompting of James South, Lord Ashley suggested to Robert Peel, tory prime minister from December 1834 to April 1835, that Faraday should be granted such a pension. Peel was on the point of granting it when he was turned out of office by the whig Lord Melbourne. In October 1835 Melbourne offered Faraday a pension at a meeting in Downing Street, but in such a way that Faraday declined and abruptly walked out. (Melbourne referred to pensions as 'humbug' and prefaced this remark with an adjective which Faraday later called 'theological'.) What next happened is not entirely clear, but it would appear that William IV's natural daughter, Mary Fox (1798-1864), who was also the daughter-in-law of Lord Holland, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, persuaded the king to put pressure on Melbourne to apologize to Faraday, which he did. If this did happen, then it would have been part of the king's general harassment of Melbourne's administration at this time, giving rise to the rather curious political spectacle of a cabinet minister's daughter-in-law helping the king's campaign against the administration. Someone leaked the story to the tory press which, needless to say, had a field day. Faraday and Melbourne sought to distance themselves from the ensuing controversy and at one point Faraday contemplated refusing the pension again; the king, however, signed the authorization on 9 December 1835. Faraday, it seems, was able to negotiate his way through this dispute and keep his self-respect intact. 
During the 1830s Faraday had been involved with the Royal Society, of which he had been a fellow since 1824. Though generally supporting the reformers (in that he wanted to make it more scientific), he sought to keep clear of the party factions within it. For instance he played a minor role in the 1830 presidential election in which the duke of Sussex defeated John Herschel. Even so he served on the Royal Society council for much of the first half of the 1830s, during which period he undertook work for the society's excise committee in which he helped prepare a system for determining the alcohol content of spirits. In November 1836 he finally retired from the council, pleading that his knee was causing him a good deal of pain. This seems a somewhat weak reason, bearing in mind that Faraday did not withdraw from any of his other (more physically demanding) positions on its account. Although Faraday was offered the presidency in 1848 and again in 1858, his role in the Royal Society was minimal after 1836, mainly because he believed that the society in its 'present state is not wholesome' (James, 'Correspondence', 3. letter 1455) as he told William Robert Grove in 1842. Nevertheless, Faraday continued to publish most of his important papers in the 'Philosophical Transactions' and the society showed its esteem for his work by awarding him its Copley medal twice (1832, 1838), its royal medal twice (1835, 1846), and its Rumford medal (1846), as well as naming him Bakerian lecturer on five occasions (1829, 1832, 1849, 1851, 1857). 
Although Faraday was unwilling to occupy the highest positions in scientific institutions, he was willing to serve in less demanding roles. Thus he was an active member of the British Association, serving as president of the chemical section in 1837 and 1846, and vice-president of the association on three occasions, in 1844, 1849, and 1853. He was a fairly regular attender and contributor to the annual meetings of the association, but would normally return from a meeting by the Saturday to attend church the following day. In 1842 he was vice-president of the newly founded Chemical Society and served on its council in the following two years. In 1836 he was appointed to the senate of the newly founded University of London, a position he held until 1863. The university was an examining body (as opposed to the teaching colleges, King's College and University College, where Faraday had declined the offer of the first chemistry chair in 1827). Faraday played an active role in the senate, particularly in establishing the curriculum for the science component of degrees, and served on the committee which established science degrees in 1858. 
Also in 1836 Faraday was appointed scientific adviser to the Corporation of Trinity House. Since 1514 the elder brethren of Trinity House had been in principle, but not until the 1830s in practice, responsible for safe navigation round the shores of England and Wales. Following major government-inspired reform in 1836, the corporation took over all existing lighthouses and embarked on a programme of building new lights where none had existed previously, or replacing out-of-date ones. As part of this programme the corporation decided to improve the quality of the light produced by its lighthouses and thoroughly to examine various methods of illumination proposed to it. In January 1836 Faraday was approached to be its scientific adviser, and accepted the position at an annual salary of $200. He held the post until 1865 when it was taken over by his colleague at the Royal Institution, John Tyndall. In the course of his work for the corporation Faraday created 150 files numbered in his normal meticulous way, but the first twenty-two, covering the 1830s, have been lost. His first tasks for Trinity House in 1836 were to construct a photometer and experiment on the preparation of oxygen; in 1837 and 1838 he was mainly concerned with comparing different types of lamp; during 1839 and 1840 he worked on the optical adjustment of lighthouse lenses. 
Although Faraday was always anxious to advance the cause of science, his involvement in the scientific community was atypical. He refrained from adopting some practices that were frequently employed by his contemporaries. For instance, he very rarely dined out, notable exceptions to this rule being the Royal Academy dinners, the welcome home to John Herschel in 1838, and later instances at Trinity House. Furthermore, Faraday did not write testimonials for candidates for employment, although he would, if asked, provide a view on the suitability of an individual for a particular position. Thus he declined to provide a testimonial to James Clerk Maxwell in 1859, but was instrumental in securing the employment of Henry Holmes Croft (1820-1883) as first professor of chemistry at King's College, Toronto, in 1842. 
In late 1839 Faraday suffered a severe illness, from which he never really fully recovered, which started on 29 November when he suddenly experienced an acute attack of vertigo. He quickly recovered from the main attack, but his physician Peter Mere Latham recommended a complete break from lecturing and from the Royal Institution. Latham also noted that Faraday complained of overwork, and specifically mentioned his 'speculations upon electricity' (Latham's notebook, Wellcome L., MS 3176, 1 Dec 1839) in this context. Brande took over the lectures, while Faraday went to Brighton. By many indicators, whether of lectures delivered, diary entries, letters written or papers published, Faraday's scientific work declined sharply during the first half of the 1840s compared with the 1830s. At the end of 1840 the managers resolved that Faraday should consider himself 'totally exonerated from all duties connected with the Royal Institution till his health should be completely re-established' (Royal Institution of Great Britain, managers' minutes, 7 Dec 1840, 9.146). Although he attended the next meeting of the managers, it is clear from his letters that his health was never really completely re-established. For the remainder of his life he suffered to one degree or another from headaches, giddiness, and loss of memory, among other symptoms. 
One consequence of Faraday's illness was that he gave up the major role in organizing the Friday evening discourses. From 1841 this was taken over by John Barlow (1798-1869) who in 1843 became secretary of the Royal Institution, a position he held until 1860. Between them Faraday and Barlow were responsible for the day-to-day running of the institution, and Barlow was instrumental in making Prince Albert a member in 1843. The prince first came to hear Faraday lecture in 1849 and brought his elder sons to hear Faraday's Christmas lectures during the 1855-6 season. In the 1840s Faraday and Barlow were jointly responsible for securing the admission of women members, and in ensuring that they had the same access to lectures as men. 
On 15 October 1840 Faraday became an elder in the Sandemanian church, evidence of his continuing esteem among the congregation. He was now one of the three elders who ran the London church and also assisted at the small community in Old Buckenham in Norfolk. He frequently preached, conducted baptisms, and presided over the love-feast. He held this position until 31 March 1844 when, along with about a fifth of the congregation, he was excluded for reasons that are not clear. Re-admitted to the congregation on 5 May, he remained a member until death, although he came close to a second and final exclusion in 1850 which provoked a major psychological crisis. On 21 October 1860 he resumed the position of elder, which he held until he laid down the office on 5 June 1864. 
Neither the consequences of his illness nor his eldership prevented Faraday from continuing to provide expert advice. Thus during the early 1840s he invented a new form of chimney for lighthouses which would prevent the products of combustion settling on the glass of the lanthorn. The process of invention involved visits to many lighthouses to examine their ventilation, and the result proved so successful that it was installed in all lighthouses run by Trinity House, as well as the Athenaeum, Buckingham Palace, and elsewhere. Faraday made this invention over to his brother Robert who patented it -- the only invention of Faraday's ever to be patented. In 1843 Faraday undertook, on behalf of the Ordnance office, the inquiry into the explosion at the Waltham Abbey gunpowder factory. The following year with Charles Lyell and Samuel Stutchbury (1798-1859) he conducted, on behalf of the Home Office, the inquiry into the explosion at Haswell colliery, Durham, in which ninety-five men and boys died. The report on the safety and ventilation of mines that he and Lyell produced was so radical and so unpalatable to the mineowners that the government had to use considerable political finesse to avoid implementing its recommendations. 
By the end of the 1830s Faraday had decided that the future course of his research was to make magnetism a universal property of matter rather than one specific to two substances (iron and nickel), and to develop and sustain experimentally a non-atomic theory of matter. In 1840 he did not know how he would solve these problems, and indeed throughout the first half of the 1840s he seems to have doubted whether he would make any useful contribution to science again. This may account for his publishing the second volume of 'Experimental Researches in Electricity' in late 1844. This volume, which reprinted just over thirty of his papers, lacked the coherence of the first. Since Faraday clearly believed that his scientific career was over, the production of such a volume was an entirely appropriate thing to do, but he did not then have a research strategy which would allow him to make the further scientific discoveries he wanted. Despite his lack of productivity in the early 1840s, this did not prevent the Academie des Sciences in Paris electing him one of its eight 'associes etrangers' in December 1844 in the place of Dalton. 
In a lecture delivered in January 1843 Faraday started to tackle the problem of the nature of matter and space and of their relationship. He posed the paradox that in metals, space was a conductor of electricity whereas it behaved as an insulator in non-conductors. He pursued this point in his lecture of 19 January 1844 entitled 'A speculation touching electric conduction and the nature of matter' and showed that the paradox could not be resolved in terms of Dalton's atomic theory. Instead he proposed the existence of point atoms where lines of force (for instance of magnetism) would meet and what was formerly perceived as a material atom would be the result of a combination of forces acting at that point. However, there was little experimental evidence for this theory. In particular, since such atoms should be structurally similar, it was peculiar that only iron and nickel evinced magnetic properties. Thus Faraday's two problems at the end of the 1830s had become linked. During 1845 he set about trying to obtain magnetic effects from a wide range of materials. At the meeting of the British Association in Cambridge in June 1845 Faraday met William Thomson who asked him if he had observed any effect on polarized light by a transparent electrolyte. This question led Faraday to conduct a series of experiments which resulted in his discovery, in September, of the magneto-optical effect and, in November, that matter generally was affected by magnetism -- diamagnetism. In these experiments Faraday used a piece of heavy glass he had made during his glass work in the late 1820s and some powerful argand lamps which he had been testing for Trinity House. The material basis of Faraday's discovery illustrates, as does so much of his work, the closeness of the practice of his science with his practical work. 
Faraday had thus found experimental evidence that magnetism was a universal property of matter and also for his views of the nature of matter and space. He outlined his new understanding in his lecture 'Thoughts on ray-vibrations' delivered on 3 April 1846. This lecture was seen by Maxwell, Silvanus P. Thompson, and others as laying the foundations of the field theory of electromagnetism. Although Faraday had used the word 'field' in 1845, it was in a purely descriptive sense of the space surrounding the magnet. During the first half of the 1850s he developed arguments for the reality of the field, which by 1851 he defined in terms of lines of force. The mathematization of field theory by Thomson and Maxwell, in consultation with Faraday, led to the theory becoming one of the fundamental concepts of modern physics. It also led Faraday to a lessening of his scepticism of the power of mathematics to describe nature. 
During the latter half of the 1840s and early 1850s Faraday also explored experimentally diamagnetic and other phenomena. He showed that gases were also susceptible to magnetic force and that the optic axis of crystals was generally the same axis along which a crystal would align itself in the field. This work attracted much attention and the phenomena were studied by Tyndall, Julius Plucker, Wilhelm Eduard Weber, and others. In his work on terrestrial magnetism Faraday tried to impose order on the enormous quantity of data relating to magnetic variations that had become available as a result of the magnetic crusade of the late 1830s and 1840s undertaken by a number of governments. This work, together with his discovery of the magnetic susceptibility of gases, led Faraday to investigate what he called atmospheric magnetism (particularly of oxygen), to which he attributed the magnetic variation of the compass needle. For ten years from 1849 he spent much experimental effort trying, unsuccessfully, to bring gravity into his scheme of forces. This illustrates his long-standing conviction, expressed explicitly, that all forces were interconvertible. 
In 1856 Faraday started his last major research project. Following George Gabriel Stokes's work on fluorescence in the early 1850s, which showed that a ray of light could change its wavelength after passing through a solution of sulphate of quinine, Faraday tried to realize this change directly. To achieve this he passed light through beaten gold and later colloidal solutions of gold. The wavelength of light was larger than the size of the gold particles, and yet they still affected the light. He sought to explain this phenomenon but, as with his work on gravity, came to no firm conclusions. Faraday's last piece of experimental work in 1862 was to see if magnetism had any effect on line spectra. He observed none and such an observation was not made until Pieter Zeeman's work in the 1890s. Faraday's late work was published in the third and final volume of 'Experimental Researches in Electricity' (1855) and most of the remainder of his papers in 'Experimental Researches in Chemistry and Physics' (1859). 
An unexpected consequence of Faraday's discovery of diamagnetism was that many of those who had taken an interest in mesmerism, which was then sweeping the country, thought that Faraday had found the mechanism for the phenomena and wrote to tell him so in 1846. Although Faraday had taken some interest in mesmerism, he concluded that there was nothing in it. In this case he made no public statement about his deep scepticism (perhaps he recollected the difficulties he had experienced since 1837 when it was stated widely, but incorrectly, that he believed that Andrew Crosse had made living insects using electricity). In 1853 spiritualism and table-turning became fashionable. As with mesmerism, Faraday examined the phenomenon and came to the conclusion that table-turning was caused by a quasi-involuntary muscular action, and had nothing to do with supernatural agency. However, the fact that he had carried out this investigation led some to interpret Faraday as giving credence to table-turning. In a letter to 'The Times' stating his results, Faraday concluded by saying that the educational system must be deficient since otherwise well-educated people would not believe in the phenomenon in the way they did. Faraday was inundated with letters (some quite abusive) from table-turners, giving accounts of their experiences. This episode led Henry Bence Jones (a manager of the Royal Institution) and Faraday to organize a set of lectures on education. These lectures, two of which were attended by Prince Albert, were delivered in 1854 by eminent men of science (including Faraday, Whewell, and Tyndall) and developed the point Faraday had made in 'The Times' about education. 
Much of Faraday's effort during the 1850s and 1860s was concentrated on his work for Trinity House. Most crucially, he was closely involved with various schemes to electrify lighthouses. As early as 1847 it was proposed to electrify buoys. Faraday commented that the buoys had to work perfectly under all weather conditions since an unreliable light was worse than none at all, and despite his evident predilection for electric light, he always gave priority to ensuring the reliability of the light produced by lighthouses. He did not develop systems of electrical light, but was asked to investigate those proposed by others: some he dismissed quickly, but there were two that he spent some time working on, one of which went into operation. The system proposed by Joseph John William Watson involved passing an electric current from a battery across a carbon arc. Faraday, after evaluating the scheme for nearly two years from November 1852, rejected it on three grounds. First that the light produced flickered too much, second that the fumes produced by the nitric acid of the battery were too great, and finally that the operation of the light would require more intelligent lighthouse keepers. 
The second system was proposed in the late 1850s by Frederick Hale Holmes. He too used a carbon arc, but its power came from an electromagnetic machine driven by a steam engine. Furthermore, Holmes had developed a mechanism which would ensure that the distance between the carbon poles of the arc remained constant, thus allowing for a sustained and constant quality of light to be produced. After considerable testing by Faraday, Holmes's system was installed in the South Foreland lighthouse and first shone on 8 December 1858. Although it was not continuously used over the next few years, it was modified so as to ensure its effectiveness. Faraday undertook much of the monitoring of the light, in which he showed great devotion, visiting South Foreland in all weather conditions and frequently going out to sea to observe the light. A voyage in 1864 caused him to become so ill that his physician (by now Bence Jones) forbade him to go to sea again. Although electric lights were installed in other lighthouses the programme was deemed a failure due to the expense involved and in 1880 it was abandoned. Despite this failure Faraday thus personally oversaw one of the earliest practical applications of his invention of the electric dynamo. Not only in lighthouse technology did Faraday's work find application during his lifetime; field theory informed the problems surrounding the construction of long-distance underwater telegraph cables in the 1850s and 1860s. 
From the mid-1840s Faraday had occasionally taken a house for a month or so in or near London (for instance in Hampstead, Norwood, Tunbridge Wells, and Wimbledon) and commuted to the Royal Institution, principally to avoid the bustle of London and the institution. In 1858 this was put on a permanent basis when Queen Victoria gave him a grace-and-favour house on the river near Hampton Court Palace. From about this time he began shedding some activities. In 1861 he sought to resign from the Royal Institution, but the managers refused to accept his resignation. In December 1861 and January 1862 he delivered his last series of Christmas lectures, on the chemical history of a candle (shortly afterwards published by William Crookes as a small book), and in 1862 his last discourse (on gas furnaces). In 1864 the managers tried to elect him president of the Royal Institution which, though he declined, caused him much agitation since he viewed himself as the institution's servant, not its figurehead. By then, however, Faraday's health was steadily declining and increasingly he spent most of his time at his home, The Green, Hampton Court, where he died on 25 August 1867. He was buried five days later in the Sandemanian plot in Highgate cemetery. 
During the nineteenth century, biographies of Faraday were written by John Tyndall, Henry Bence Jones, John Hall Gladstone, and Silvanus P. Thompson. Though they give some indication of the complexity of Faraday's life and character, they tend to portray him as a lone man of science experimenting in the basement laboratory of the Royal Institution. This simplified image, which continued into the 1960s, was reinforced by publications (including the seven volumes of his laboratory notebook) stemming from the extensive 1931 public celebrations marking the centenary of his discovery of electromagnetic induction. It was not until the 1980s and 1990s that a much more complex image of Faraday emerged from the studies of David Gooding on his experimentation, of Geoffrey Cantor on his religion, and of Frank James on his various roles in nineteenth-century society. 
Faraday was the last major natural philosopher who could work without mathematics and thus his style is out of tune with modern science. Yet he was, and is, much admired, both among the scientific and engineering communities and more generally. This admiration has taken many forms, reflecting his wide range of interests and activities: he is one of the few scientists to have an outdoor statue in London (by Waterloo Bridge); he is the only person to have two SI units named after him (the farad for capacitance and the faraday for electric charge); the Faraday medal is the premier award of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, which also has a Faraday lecture; the Royal Society of Chemistry has a Faraday division and a Faraday medal/lecture, while the Royal Society makes the Faraday award, formerly on the recommendation of the committee on the public understanding of science; and science buildings in a number of universities have been named after Faraday. His high status within the scientific and engineering communities, together with the continuing historical interest in his life as a major topic from which to explore various approaches to the history of science, and the continuing publication of his manuscripts, all ensure that he will remain a subject of study for many years to come. One of those rare figures whose distinction was always recognized by contemporaries and by posterity, Faraday's national importance was further marked by his depiction at the end of the twentieth century on the Bank of England's $20 note.

Farey, John (1766-1826), geologist and surveyor, was born on 24 September 1766 at Woburn, Bedfordshire, on the fourth duke of Bedford's estate, at the farm tenanted by his parents, John Farey (1728-1798) and his second wife, Rachel, 'nee' Wright (1732-1804), a Wesleyan Methodist. From the village school Farey went in 1782 to the Halifax Academy where he studied drawing and surveying under Robert Pullman (died 1789); this 'studious man and good mathematician' gave him 'gratuitous instruction in mathematics and [natural] philosophy' ('Monthly Magazine') and recommended him to the engineer John Smeaton. 
By 1785 Farey was in London, sketching a new steam engine being erected. His first interests were mathematical. Between 1787 and 1800 he contributed many propositions and answers to the 'Ladies' Diary', the 'Gentleman's Diary', Davison's 'Mathematical and Philosophical Repertory', and Leybourn's 'Mathematical Repository'. On 10 May 1790 he married Sophia Hubert (1770-1830) -- possibly from a French family -- at St Pancras; their eldest son, John Farey (1791-1851), was born in Lambeth. Both Fareys were singers and musicians, John as tenor and Sophia as soprano, in the Choral Fund, Cecilian Society, Surrey Chapel Society, and in oratorios at Drury Lane. John was also the first secretary and librarian to the Choral Fund, founded in 1791 'for the relief of decayed musicians, their widows and orphans' ('Laws... of the Fund', 1807). 
In 1792 Farey was appointed by Francis Russell, fifth duke of Bedford (1765-1802), as agent to his extensive Bedfordshire estates; he returned to his birthplace where he threw himself into the practice and study of agriculture and forestry, and writing reports for the board of agriculture. At the 1798 Woburn sheep-shearing Farey first met his later patron Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, and showed him his improvements to the Woburn drainage, first planned by Joseph Elkington (1740-1806). Farey was encouraged by the duke to study drainage methods and in 1797 he visited Derbyshire and the northern counties, and in 1801 toured with drainer William Hart. The geologist William Smith (1769-1839) was also involved in Woburn drainage. Farey and Smith met in October 1801 and went on tour together late in 1801 and again, with engineer Benjamin Bevan (1773-1833), early in 1802 on a 50 mile round trip to investigate local strata. Farey had been actively studying geology before he met Smith but was so impressed by the novelty and importance of Smith's knowledge of stratification, and how fossils could be used to identify some rocks, that he wrote at length to Banks outlining Smith's discoveries in February 1802. 
The duke of Bedford died on 2 March 1802; his brother, John Russell (1766-1839), would not renew Farey's contract, and dismissed him in June after nearly ten years' service. Farey settled at 12 Crown Street, Westminster, to earn his living as land-surveyor and agent. In 1806 he was appointed paid secretary of the Smithfield Club, and in 1815-26 also held the post of treasurer. Farey was awarded a silver medal by the Society of Arts in 1805 for tree-planting work in Buckinghamshire and he found time to publish again on mathematics (1804-6). From 1805 he contributed to Abraham Rees's (1743-1825) important 'Cyclopaedia', on 'canals, geology, measures, music and trigonometrical survey' ('Philosophical Magazine', 56, 1820, 219). In 1806 he started another long series of publications on music, becoming an enthusiastic advocate of equal temperament tuning, using instruments on which alternative temperaments could be demonstrated. In 1810-11, after a dispute with Rees about his geological contributions, he stopped writing for him (at the end of joint letter I/J); he was replaced on geology by the Wernerian Charles Koenig (1774-1851). Farey's musical work for Rees comprised all the more theoretical and mathematical articles dealing with temperaments, tuning, and harmonics. Farey was soon active, between 1810 and 1819, as contributor to the 'Edinburgh Encyclopaedia', again largely on music, his interests having arisen directly from his mathematical work. 
In 1804 Farey, with Smith, attended the Woburn sheep-shearing at which Banks opened the subscription to support publication of Smith's 'Delineation of the Strata of England and Wales'. By May 1806 Banks was pressing for its completion and Farey threw his energies into encouraging Smith and publicizing and demonstrating the importance of Smith's geological results, particularly in the 'Monthly' and 'Philosophical' magazines, and William Nicholson's 'Journal'. Banks now offered to pay Farey to prepare a stratigraphic cross-section between London and Brighton. Farey's brother conveniently worked in Sussex and by early 1807 this enormous section was finished, and soon copied. It was the first such detailed cross-section to be prepared in England and correctly showed the denuded, anticlinal or 'strata-ridged' structure of the Weald. Farey prepared several other stratigraphic sections across many other parts of England, but all remained unpublished in his lifetime. 
1807 brought Farey two new commissions, to Smith's great frustration, in Derbyshire. The first was the county survey for Sir John Sinclair's board of agriculture, which resulted in his best-known work, the remarkably detailed three-volume 'General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire' (1811-17), with his pioneering analysis of the geometry of faulting and an early discussion of English stratigraphy. The other, privately for Banks, was a detailed geological survey of Banks's Overton estate, near Ashover. This was finished by 1812, but plans to publish it in the 'Transactions of the Geological Society of London' were aborted in 1813 when some of its members found it too minute and detailed. Many in this society remained to be persuaded of the reliability and novelty of Smith's and Farey's methods. However, enough fragments of Farey's Ashover survey survive to demonstrate how extraordinarily advanced his geological field mapping then was. Up to 1813 Farey gave inadvertent, but vital, help to the society's work on producing a competitor (published in 1820) to Smith's 'Geological Map' (1815). Farey was subsequently ostracized by the society (of which neither he nor Smith were ever members), despite W. H. Fitton's attempted mediation in 1817-18, and by 1822 Farey was referring to it as 'the Anti-Smithian Association' (Farey to James Sowerby, May 1822, Smithsonian Institution library, Washington, DC). 
In September 1806 Farey visited explorations for coal being made at Bexhill, Sussex, by William James (1771-1837) and soon demonstrated their stupidity, and that of the many other searches then being made in impossible stratigraphic situations, pointing out the enormous sums of money which such trials wasted. From 1807 he advertised his services as 'mineralogical surveyor', for, as Banks wrote in 1811, 'we have now some Practical men well versd in stratification who undertake to examine the subterranean Geography of Gentlemens Estates in order to discover the Fossils likely to be useful for Manure, for Fuel etc' (G. De Beer, 'The Sciences were Never at War', 1960, 191). Farey became the leader in this field and was active all over the British Isles (and apparently France), preparing detailed reports on Yorkshire alum and coal, Edinburgh water, Borrowdale graphite, north Wales slates, and coal throughout Scotland and the Welsh borders. In 1814 he raised his charges from 2 to 3 guineas a day, plus expenses, but he was never able to interest a publisher in these private reports and they too remained in manuscript (and most are now lost). 
The end of the Napoleonic wars had a negative effect on such commissions and by 1824 Farey was reduced to offering himself as copyist to the Sowerbys (at a shilling an hour). Farey had been unjustly marginalized by the ruling elite of English geology from 1810, when his writing for Rees's 'Cyclopaedia' was terminated. Many of his papers had now to be published under a cloak of anonymity as by A Constant Reader, but nevertheless he continued to publish to an extraordinary extent. More than 270 articles are now identified, over an amazing range of other subjects, including astronomy (long another interest), engineering, politics, and pacifism, and from supporting Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) in 1804 to urging that the English currency be decimalized, in 1817. 
Farey achieved eponymous fame in mathematics with his 1816 publication on a curious property of vulgar fractions, shortly afterwards named 'Farey' numbers and series. Using the continued fractions methods he had worked out for his musical temperament work, Farey showed the properties of such fractions when arranged in order. The sixth Farey series was for example:



0/11/61/51/41/32/51/23/52/33/44/55/61/1

Such series proved to have many interesting arithmetical properties, since if a/c and b/d are consecutive fractions in such a series, then the multiplied products 'a' x diedand 'b' x 'c' prove consecutive integers. Farey, although the first to bring such properties to public attention, was not the first to recognize them and never offered a mathematical proof. 
Farey's geological writings illuminate the highly political battles between the gentlemen geologists of the Geological Society and working practitioners such as himself. He felt strongly that the latter had made the more important contribution to unravelling the complexities of British strata; he was one of the first to claim that geological knowledge was of real economic importance in Britain's industrialization, and to demonstrate the truth of this claim. Following a paralytic stroke, Farey died on 6 January 1826 at his home, 37 Howland Street, Fitzroy Square, London, and was buried in St James's Chapel, St Pancras. His wife, who died in July 1830, tried in vain to sell his enormous geological collections to an uninterested British Museum in 1828, but these and his extensive manuscript collections have disappeared. Their eldest son built a reputation as one of the finest consulting engineers in England, while others of Farey's seven surviving children emigrated, to France and America.

Farey, John (1791-1851), mechanical engineer, was born on 20 March 1791, at Lambeth, London, the eldest of the seven surviving children of John Farey (1766-1826), geologist, and his wife, Sophia Hubert (1770-1830). His early education is obscure, but it is known that he attended a dame-school at Woburn. At some point he had training in drafting patent specifications under William Nicholson (1753-1815), who also ran a school in Soho Square, London. In 1804-5 Farey set about the systematic study of industrial machinery in and around London; and in 1805, aged fourteen, he began making drawings for Rees's 'Cyclopaedia'. In the following year he was elected a member of the Society of Arts, and also filed his first patent specification. 
A person of many talents, Farey's interests ranged across engineering, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, geography, geology, and theology; and as a young man he was proficient in music, singing, painting, and engraving. He was also a prolific writer, and he contributed, as draughtsman or writer, usually anonymously, to periodicals, including the 'Journal of the Society of Arts' and Tilloch's 'Philosophical Magazine'; to technical books, including Olinthus Gregory's 'Mechanics' (1806) and Smeaton's 'Reports' (1812); and to various encyclopaedias. He is also thought to be the pseudonymous author of several technical manuals, including 'Thomas Martin', 'The Circle of the Mechanical Arts' (1812) and 'John Nicholson', 'The Operative Mechanic and British Machinist' (1821). He employed William Hyde Wollaston's camera lucida to produce drawings at speed; he invented a draughtsman's rule for drawing perspective and a machine for drawing ellipses accurately. He also designed a long-length slide-rule for making more accurate mathematical calculations. This equipment he sold to fellow artists and engineers. 
The Farey family operated as a business, servicing clients who wished to make use of their differing skills. John Farey, senior, concentrated on surveying and writing for the scientific and popular press. Farey, junior, collected data and drawings of machines and inventions, which he used both for commissions from publishers and authors and in his work on patents. Farey worked as a consulting engineer for many prominent inventors during the later industrial revolution, preparing patent specifications, and appearing as an expert witness at numerous patent trials. He was assisted by his brothers and sisters in the preparation of drawings, and models. His brother William (1795-1836) was a surveyor, and, on the death of their father, in 1826 took over his position of secretary of the Smithfield Club. Barnard William Farey (1825-1883), son of William, continued the engineering tradition of the family, and became eminent in the profession later in the century. 
The family had close links with France. Farey first visited Paris in September 1814; and he frequently visited the country on behalf of John Heathcoat (1783-1861), and took out patents there for Heathcoat's lace-making machines. Later, Farey's brothers Joseph and Henry worked full-time in France, and the family operated in London and Paris for inventors who wished to patent an invention in the other country. 
Farey visited Russia for a month in the autumn of 1819, when he saw James Watt's hitherto secret steam engine indicator, used by Boulton and Watt's engineers to tune the engines. He was responsible for the commercial manufacture of the instrument and its introduction generally into Britain, and used it professionally when undertaking engine tests. 
Farey's 'Steam engine' article in volume 34 of Rees's 'Cyclopaedia', published in 1816, was well received by his fellow engineers, and, encouraged by this, he commenced writing his 'Treatise on the Steam Engine' in 1820. In 1821 he gave up his interest in the family business in favour of his brother Joseph and moved to Tiverton, Devon, where he was employed by Heathcoat to work on developing the series of machines Heathcoat later patented. 
In February 1821, Farey married, at St Pancras Church, London, Mary Horniman Thompson Taylor, and they lived in Tiverton until December 1823, when they returned to London. The following year he accepted the post of engineering manager at Marshall's Flax Mill at Holbeck, near Leeds. Mary Farey gave birth in London to a son, Edward (1825-1913), in February 1825, but she died eight days later. Joseph Farey became paralysed in July 1825, and John Farey, senior, took over the running of the London business until his own death in January 1826. Farey then returned to London and this was to remain his base for the rest of his life. 
Farey married Elizabeth Pugsley (1791-1850), daughter of Robert Pugsley of Ilfracombe, in February 1827; there were no children. She assisted him in his professional work and was described as having 'almost masculine scientific abilities' ('PICE', 1851-2). Farey joined the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1826. He became a member of council and took an active part in moves to reform the constitution and rules, especially those relating to the education of engineers. 
The first volume of Farey's 'Treatise on the Steam Engine', covering the history to the expiry of Watt's patent, was published in 1827. Despite much prompting by the publisher he did not complete the second volume, which was to have covered the theory and design, with a detailed account of the best machines then being manufactured. He worked up only chapters on Richard Trevithick's high-pressure engine and the compound engine patented by Arthur Woolf, which were not set in type and printed until after 1843. All the sheets of the volume were pulped after his death in 1851, leaving the author's proof as the sole surviving copy, and this was not published until 1971. 
From the later 1820s Farey concentrated on his engineering consultancy. He gave evidence at the parliamentary inquiries on patent law (1829) and steam carriage tolls (1832), and to the Lords' committees on steam carriage tolls (1832) and patent law (1835). He appeared before inquests, and on occasion acted as a referee or arbitrator. His work as an engineering consultant for private clients was of necessity highly confidential in view of the commercial sensitivity of much of the work he did, and little of it is now known. 
In December 1844 a disastrous fire occurred at Farey's residence and office, 67 Guilford Street, Russell Square, London, in which four people, two of whom were police constables, were killed. He kept many of his papers in fire-proof safes and was able quickly to resume his professional work from premises nearby. He was unsuccessfully proposed for membership of the Royal Society in February 1847 and in 1851 was a juror to the machinery section of the Great Exhibition. Farey died of heart failure at The Common, Sevenoaks, Kent, on 17 July 1851, and was buried with Elizabeth in the unconsecrated part of Highgate cemetery in London. 
Farey was one of the most highly regarded consulting engineers of his time, but received no public recognition during his own life. His 'Treatise' has been described as the finest work on technology to be published during the industrial revolution (Tunzelmann, 2).

Fargus, Frederick John (1847-1885), poet and novelist, was born at Bristol on 26 December 1847, the eldest of the three sons of Frederick Charles Fargus (died 1868), a local auctioneer, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Marson, who died during their boyhood. Fred Fargus was a quiet, contemplative child, but his boyish passion for the novels of Captain Marryat made him long to be a sailor. His father reluctantly assented to his wish to be entered, when thirteen years old, as a student on board the school frigate 'Conway', then stationed on the Mersey. Although he made rapid progress there, and in June 1862 won several prizes for academic achievement, his desire to enter the Royal Navy soon cooled, and he was placed for a time at a private school in Bristol. 
On leaving school Fargus was articled to W. H. Williams & Co., a firm of public accountants in Bristol, in whose office he remained until his father's death on 14 April 1868. He then joined his uncle H. R. Fargus as an auctioneer in the family business, where he worked until he achieved fame as a writer in 1883. He was known as a good judge of art, curiosities, china, and bric-a-brac, and as such was employed to value and catalogue the Strawberry Hill collection on the death of Countess Waldegrave. On 26 August 1871 Fargus married Amy, the youngest daughter of Alderman Spark JP, of Bristol; they had three sons and a daughter. 
As a schoolboy of seventeen Fargus had written a burlesque, 'Jason, or, The Golden Fleece', which impressed the company then performing at the Bristol Theatre. While still a clerk, he began to write lyrical poems, and a collection was published in 1879 as 'A Life's Idylls and other Poems'. Many of his verses were set to music, 'Some Day' (1880), with music by Joseph Milton Wellings, being perhaps the most popular. These poems and songs appeared under the signature Hugh Conway, in memory of his old school frigate on the Mersey, and soon afterwards he began to write short tales of mystery and the supernatural using the same pseudonym. 'The Daughter of the Stars' was the first to be published in late 1881, in a collection of tales entitled 'Thirteen at Dinner', the earliest of the series of 'Christmas Annuals' from Bristol publisher J. W. Arrowsmith. Soon Fargus's stories were appearing regularly in metropolitan miscellanies like 'Chambers's Journal' as well as in provincial newspapers such as the local 'Bristol Times' or the 'Yorkshire Post', which carried the serial novel 'The Redhills Mystery' in 1883. In Margaret Oliphant's judgement, however, of his early stories, collected in two volumes under the title 'Bound together' in 1884, the best were those which appeared in the Edinburgh monthly 'Blackwood's Magazine', beginning with 'The Secret of the Stradivarius' in December 1881. 
But it was the unexpected popular success of the novella 'Called back' which brought Fargus international fame. This gripping tale of blindness, amnesia, and murder, of political conspiracy in Italy and political exile in Siberia, appeared in late 1883 as the third of Arrowsmith's 'Christmas Annuals'. Only about half of the initial edition of 6000 had been sold by the end of the holiday season, but, owing in part to an enthusiastic notice in 'Truth' (3 January 1884), 30,000 copies were cleared by March 1884. According to the original agreement Fargus ceded the entire copyright of 'Called back' to Arrowsmith for only $80. However, on the success of the book, this was cancelled by mutual consent and a royalty was paid for a period of six years. Frequently reprinted as a paperback in Arrowsmith's 'Bristol Library', by summer 1887 over 350,000 copies of the book had been sold throughout the British empire. A much larger number were undoubtedly printed in various unauthorized editions in the United States, and the story was quickly translated into all the major European languages. Contemporary commentators tended to compare the story to Wilkie Collins's sensation novels of the 1860s, but readers are now more likely to recognize 'Called back' as one of the first examples of the modern best-selling thriller. 
The story was dramatized by J. Comyns Carr in collaboration with the author, and opened on 20 May 1884 at the Prince's (later Prince of Wales's) Theatre in London, where it ran for almost 200 performances. The success of 'Called back' led Fargus to quit his job as an auctioneer and move to London. This followed a banquet given on 12 June 1884 by the mayor of Bristol to celebrate the local author's triumph. Success also led to a large number of offers of remunerative literary work which Fargus clearly struggled to fulfil. In addition to regular contributions to metropolitan periodicals, Fargus agreed to write further 'Christmas Annuals' for Arrowsmiths and promised a series of short stories to Tillotsons Fiction Bureau in Bolton. His most highly paid effort was probably the serial 'Living or Dead', sold for $1200 to W. C. Leng & Co. of Sheffield, who were starting a rival fiction syndication agency centred on their 'Weekly Telegraph'. The most popular work was probably the 1884 Arrowsmiths 'Annual' 'Dark Days'. This was also dramatized and widely translated, and provoked a parody in Andrew Lang's 'Even Darker Days', also issued in 1884 under the pseudonym A. Huge Longway. Fargus's most complex narrative was 'A Family Affair', which combines the mechanisms of enigma and suspense with delicate social comedy. It was serialized in the 'English Illustrated Magazine' from October 1884. Much of Fargus's fiction did not appear in volume form until after his death. In addition to collections of short tales, and the 1885 Arrowsmiths 'Christmas Annual' 'Slings and Arrows', the posthumous books included three triple-decker novels, 'A Family Affair' (1885), 'Living or Dead' (1886), and 'A Cardinal Sin' (1886), which was 'The Redhills Mystery' under a new title. 
Although Fargus wrote with great fluency, this excess of literary labour seems to have led to physical exhaustion. Early in 1885 Fargus showed symptoms of tuberculosis and was advised to seek rest and recuperation in a sunnier climate. While in the Riviera in the spring, following visits to Milan, Florence, and Rome, he was diagnosed as suffering from typhoid fever. When convalescent, he caught a chill, suffered a relapse, and died at Monte Carlo on 15 May 1885. On 18 May he was buried in the cemetery at Nice. An epitaph by Lord Houghton placed over his grave describes him as 'A British writer of fiction of great renown and greater promise, who died prematurely'. A memorial tablet in his honour was erected by public subscription in Bristol Cathedral.

Faricius (d. 1117), doctor and abbot of Abingdon, was a native of Italy. Born in Arezzo, he became the foremost physician in England, a man of letters, a powerfully effective monastic reformer and administrator, and one of the most highly regarded servants of Henry I. Tireless, austere, and possessed of an acute memory, he was also a charming conversationalist -- overall, a fine specimen of twelfth-century Renaissance man. It is not known either how or where he acquired his medical skill (no evidence links him to Salerno), or when he came to England. He is first noticed in the reign of William II, as cellarer of Malmesbury Abbey. At some point after Aldhelm's relics were translated to Malmesbury in 1078, Faricius composed there a scholarly hagiography of the saint ('Patrologia Latina', 89, 1863, cols. 633-84) which became a source for the life that William of Malmesbury later included in his 'Gesta pontificum'. (Despite William's occasionally muted praise of Faricius, the possibility is at least worth entertaining that he sat at the cellarer's feet in his youth.) However, it would have been as physician rather than as hagiographer that Faricius began to attract attention at court. 
When the dilapidated and oppressed abbey of Abingdon sought a new abbot after a three-year vacancy, Henry I's approval of the monks' nomination of Faricius -- suggested, in later legend, by the Virgin herself -- was readily forthcoming. Robert Bloet, bishop of Lincoln (died 1123), installed him at Abingdon on 1 November 1100. The following year, when Queen Matilda was expecting her first child, Faricius was chief among those physicians ordered to attend her confinement. According to the eulogy of the abbot in the chronicle of Abingdon the king believed that he himself had often been cured by Faricius's prescriptions. Also among the abbot's notable patients were members of such families as the de Veres, the Fitzhaymons, and the Crispins. Benefactions from them and their kind, and still more from the royal family, ensured that, during Faricius's abbacy, Abingdon enjoyed a level of prosperity equalled by few contemporary English houses. Indeed, Faricius's resuscitation of monastic life at Abingdon bears comparison with AEthelwold's reforms there over a century previously. The abbot was enabled to increase the number of monks from some twenty-eight to eighty, to rebuild both church and monastic buildings (including an infirmary) on a substantial scale, and to decorate lavishly. Relics arrived from as far away as Constantinople; the library was enhanced by professional scribes, who copied patristic and medical works; a school flourished. During all this Faricius also found the energy to debate infant baptism with the Oxford master, Theobald d'Etampes. 
But Faricius's energies were mainly directed towards political and administrative ends. In order to support the high quota of knight service assigned to the monastery at the conquest he had to spend much time trying, not always successfully, to recover alienated fiefs. He also had to exploit royal connections to the full. In defending the interests of his house the abbot was among the first both to benefit from the new writs 'of right', and to gain exemption from the 1110 feudal aid demanded by the king for the marriage of his daughter Matilda to the emperor Henry V. He is also sometimes said to have been an early appellant to 'Domesday Book'; but the 'Liber de thesauro' (exchequer book) referred to in a court case concerning the hundredal obligations of one of the abbey's manors must be some other record, because 'Domesday Book' lacks information on hundreds in its relevant section. Whatever the document, in this as in all his various contacts with the royal family, both medical and forensic, Faricius showed himself to be archiepiscopal material. After exercising regalian right in Canterbury for the five years following the death of Anselm in 1109, Henry I decided on Faricius as Anselm's successor. The monks of Canterbury were in favour -- not so the other parties claiming involvement in the election. There was some apprehension about Faricius's zeal for reform; the secular bishops, led by Roger of Salisbury (died 1139), wanted a Norman, a secular clerk, and, some speciously argued, a primate not tainted by a career spent examining female urine. Ralph d'Escures, bishop of Rochester, became the successful compromise candidate. 
Thereafter Faricius's fortunes perhaps declined. If the thirteenth-century recensions of the chronicle of Abingdon can be trusted, he may have been the first of the great 'feudal' abbots to maintain a separate household and table from that of his monks; and the tension resulting between them may have surfaced in a dispute ostensibly over cheese rations. The dispute was serious enough for investigation by a royal commission, rather embarrassingly consisting of the new archbishop, Roger of Salisbury, and one of the abbot's own vassals. Though Faricius was exonerated, little more is heard of him. He died not long after, in February 1117 -- ironically, according to one of those late recensions, of food poisoning.

Farindon, Anthony (1598-1658), Church of England clergyman, was born at Sonning, Berkshire, and baptized there on 24 December 1598, the son of Thomas Farndon or Faringdon. Admitted as a scholar to Trinity College, Oxford, on 9 June 1612, he graduated BA on 26 June 1616, and became a fellow in 1617. He proceeded MA on 28 March 1620 and, at about the same time, was ordained in the Church of England. According to Anthony Wood he was 'a noted Preacher in these parts, an eminent Tutor in the College, and a worthy example to be imitated by all' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2.144). Henry Ireton, who was admitted to Trinity as a gentleman commoner in 1626, 'had the character in that house of a stubborn and sawcy fellow towards the Seniors' in the college (ibid., 2.81) and Farindon is reported to have said that Ireton 'would prove either the best or worst instrument that ever this kingdom bred' (Lloyd, 543). Farindon proceeded BD on 17 December 1629. 
In 1634 Farindon became the vicar of Bray in Berkshire, a living valued at $120 a year. Around the time of his move to Bray he married his wife, Elizabeth. In 1639 Farindon was appointed by his diocesan, John Bancroft, bishop of Oxford, reader or lecturer in divinity at St George's Chapel, Windsor. The appointment had the support of Archbishop William Laud. At Windsor, Farindon became a friend of John Hales, who was a canon of Windsor Chapel and a fellow of Eton College. 
After the parliamentarian victory at the second battle of Newbury in late October 1644 Farindon's vicarage was taken over by now quartermaster-general Ireton, and soldiers were housed there. Farindon was ejected as vicar and replaced by William Brice, who was afterwards replaced by Hezekiah Woodward in 1649. According to Wood, Woodward refused to pay the required fifths of the revenues of the benefice to Farindon's wife for the family's needs (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2.394-5). As a result, although Gilbert Sheldon, the future archbishop, gave financial assistance in 1650, David Lloyd states that Farindon, his wife, and their half dozen children were 'likely to have starved' had it not been for John Robinson, a London merchant, and the parishioners of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, London (Lloyd, 543). The rector of St Mary Magdalen, Thomas Case, a presbyterian, had left his position rather than subscribe to the engagement (which would have committed him to the present government), and the congregation was divided over whether to replace him with a presbyterian or an Independent. When Farindon preached on Robinson's invitation he made such a favourable impression that he was subsequently asked to be rector. 
Farindon was one of a remarkable number of royalist and episcopalian clergymen who moved into London in the early 1650s and ministered in public capacities. Farindon's congregation included so many scholars dislocated by religious and political changes that it was known as the 'scholars church'. However, as a result of the government proclamation of late 1655 that no sequestered minister could preach in London, Farindon was silenced in 1656. He preached a farewell sermon, and in following weeks a friend preached two sermons to mark his departure, eventually published in 1674 with 'Fifty Sermons' of Farindon's own. As a result of these occasions some $400 was contributed for his and his family's support, and in 1657 he was assisted by Brian Duppa, the future bishop of Winchester. 
One of the clergymen who assisted Farindon in the late 1640s and whom Farindon in turn assisted in the 1650s was John Hales. According to Walker, Hales had been 'the chief support' of Farindon and his family when their needs had been greatest (Walker, 94). Farindon then visited Hales in Windsor when the latter had lost his canonry and his fellowship. Near the end of Hales's life, Farindon, on discovering that his friend was nearly destitute, offered him $50 at once and more when needed. When Hales died in 1656 Farindon undertook to write his life, but had not completed it before his own death two years later. However, Anthony Wood suggested that his notes might have reached the hands of William Fulman of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, whose collection of materials on Hales was used by later writers. In a letter to Timothy Garthwait, subsequently the publisher of the 'Golden Remains of the Ever Memorable Mr John Hales of Eton College' (1659), Farindon gives an insight into Hales's experience as an observer at the Synod of Dort in 1618-19 not found in Hales's own correspondence. Having observed that 'in his younger days [Hales] was a Calvinist', Farindon wrote that it was 'at that Synod, and at the well pressing 3. S. John 16. by Episcopius [the Arminian Simon Episcopius]' that Hales 'bid John Calvin good night, as he has often told me' (Hales, sig. A4). 
Farindon's 'XXX. Sermons Lately Preached at the Parish Church of Saint Mary Magdalen Milkstreet, London', with an additional sermon preached at the funeral of Sir George Whitmore, lord mayor of London, appeared in 1657 (misdated as 1647 in some copies), with a preface by Farindon suggesting that he was still barred from the pulpit. It was dedicated to John Robinson. The basis of Farindon's appeal as a preacher is partly suggested by his statement in the preface that he had tried to present 'those more necessary and essential truths, by the embracing of which we lay hold on happiness, and come nearest to it', rather than engaging in theological speculation. The sermons are vigorous, pastoral, and learned in an unintimidating way, and are well supported by passages of scripture. One reason for Farindon's appeal to royalists and episcopalians is suggested by his statement that the form of ecclesiastical polity that the present age had swept away -- namely, episcopacy -- was 'the fairest bulwark the Church had to secure her from the Incursions of Schisme, Heresy, and Prophanenesse' (sig. **4). A second volume, 'Forty Sermons', appeared in 1663, dedicated to the lawyer and judge Sir Orlando Bridgeman, who is said to have assisted Farindon and other 'distressed clergymen' (sig. A3). 
Farindon's wife, Elizabeth, had died before her husband's departure from the Milk Street pulpit, and was buried at St Mary Magdalen on 31 July 1655. Following his death, on 9 October 1658, he too was buried there, suggesting that he had continued to live nearby. His will, dated 6 October 1656, left bequests of $700 and mentioned six children -- Anne, Anthony, Charles, Margaret, Merioll, and Elizabeth.

Cook, Hugh (d. 1539), abbot of Reading, was probably professed as a Benedictine monk before 1500. Born Hugh Cook, he subsequently adopted the arms of the Cook family of Kent, though his monastic surname suggests that he originated from Faringdon in Berkshire. He seems to have received his education entirely within the abbey, and, having previously served as sub-chamberlain, was elected abbot on the death of Thomas Worcester in September 1520. Almost at once he assumed the temporal duties expected of a mitred abbot, being placed alongside temporal landowners on commissions of the peace and other governmental commissions for Berkshire from 1526 to 1538. 
During Faringdon's rule the grammar school attached to the abbey flourished greatly, attracting sons of the nobility and gentry who in 1534 included James Bassett, the son of Lady Lisle from an earlier marriage and stepson of Lord Lisle, the governor of Calais. About 1524 Edward Cox, the school's humanist master, published a treatise, 'The Arte or Crafte of Rhethoryke', which he dedicated to the abbot. In his last months of freedom in 1539 the abbot concluded a new teaching agreement between the abbey and Cox. 
Midway between London and Oxford, and not far from Windsor, the abbey frequently received royal and academic visitors. Faringdon first entertained Henry VIII in January 1521, when the king made an oblation to the image of 'the Child of Grace' at the monastery; by 1532 the abbot had been appointed one of the royal chaplains and in the autumn of 1537 he both sang a requiem mass for Queen Jane Seymour at Hampton Court and participated in her burial at Windsor. 
In 1528 Thomas Garret stopped at Reading Abbey on route to Oxford, and sold a number of heretical books to the prior, John Shirbourne, who was subsequently imprisoned for a time in the Tower. Faringdon took firm action against his errant monk, refusing in 1532 to permit him to return to the abbey. He similarly showed little sympathy with three monks who later in the decade appealed to the bishop of Salisbury against Roger London, the abbey's anti-Lutheran divinity reader, and successfully withstood the bishop's attempt to impose Richard Cobbe, a married man and former priest, as divinity lecturer upon the house. 
Faringdon appears always to have been conservative in his religions opinions, and was among the minority in convocation in April 1533 who believed the pope could dispense from the impediment of affinity with a brother's widow, even when the marriage had been consummated. Nevertheless, he still managed to retain the government's favour almost to the end. A frequent attender of the House of Lords, in 1530 he had signed the petition to the pope against the delay in the divorce proceedings, offering the king the use of his abbey's library to find arguments for the annulment of his marriage. He took the oath recognizing the royal supremacy, and in 1536 he acquiesced in the act authorizing the dissolution of the lesser monasteries, though this may have been in the hope that the greater houses might yet be spared. From at least 1534 the abbot had been paying an annuity of 20 marks to Cromwell. In 1537 Cromwell heard that the abbot had been associating with favourers of the bishop of Rome, but took no action against him. Early in 1538 the abbot and convent of Abingdon yielded their house to the crown, and when Cromwell's officials came to Reading to suppress the grey friars in the following September, they took the opportunity to draw up an inventory of the abbey's relics, at the same time commenting approvingly that there was a daily scripture lecture in the chapter house in Latin and English. On this visit Faringdon put himself at the king's command, but still took no steps to surrender his abbey. 
In mid-August 1539, however, Cromwell received a report that Faringdon was selling the abbey's sheep, corn, and woods to the king's disadvantage. This seems to have precipitated his removal to the Tower on a charge of treason, and on 19 September, in his absence, crown officials suppressed the house. 
Much speculation has arisen over the precise nature of Faringdon's sedition. The French ambassador believed the abbot had some complicity in the Exeter conspiracy, and certainly John Rugge, one of his associates, a former prebendary of Salisbury who had retired to the abbey, was closely connected with the Pole circle. The charges in Faringdon's indictment, however, relate exclusively to his religious opinions, alleging that on no fewer than three occasions he had upheld the papal supremacy. Together with Rugge and John Eynon, priest of St Giles, Reading, he was found guilty of treason and hanged before the abbey gatehouse on 14 November 1539. Since no members of the community were involved in Faringdon's treason the government allowed the monks of Reading their pensions at the dissolution.

George Farington (1752-1788), history painter, a younger brother of the above, was born in Warrington in 1752. In 1773 he was employed with his brother in making a record of the paintings in the Walpole collection at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, before their shipment to Russia. After a short period with Benjamin West, he became a student at the Royal Academy, winning a silver medal in 1779 and a gold medal in 1780 for history painting with 'The Cauldron Scene in 'Macbeth''. In 1782 he sailed for India, undoubtedly encouraged by his brothers who served in the East India Company. He was in Calcutta by 1783, where a notice in the 'Calcutta Gazette' advertised that pictures by Francis Swain Ward could be seen at Mr Farington's at the Old Library. In 1784 he gave 300 rupees to the building of St John's Church. It was in Calcutta that Farington met Sir John D'Oyly, former resident of the nawab's court at Murishdabad. Competition among painters probably encouraged Farington to leave Calcutta for Murishdabad in 1785. There he received a warm welcome from the resident, Robert Port, who commissioned several paintings, including a small version of 'The Durbar at Murishdabad', which Farington was painting for D'Oyly. A version was later returned to England, and to the possession of Richard Farington in Lancashire. Another patron was General Claud Martin, who owned four portraits by Farington, and there is evidence to suggest that he painted scenes of local ceremonies (Archer, 126-9). He died at Murishdabad in May 1788 as the result of a chill. A studio sale of his work was held in Calcutta after his death, the proceeds of which went towards helping settle William Farington's East India Company debts.

Farington, Joseph (1747-1821), landscape painter and diarist, was born at Leigh vicarage, Lancashire, on 21 November 1747, the second of the seven sons of William Farington (1704-1767), rector of Warrington and vicar of Leigh, and his wife, Esther Gilbody (1716-1794) of Manchester. His elder brother William (1746-1803) and two of his younger brothers, Henry (1750-1827) and Richard Atherton (1755-1822) were all employed in the naval service of the East India Company. A fourth brother, George (1752-1788), was also a painter ['see below'], a fifth brother, Edward (1758-1790), had his naval career cut short by yellow fever, and the sixth, Robert (1760-1841), studied theology at Brasenose College, Oxford, becoming vicar of St George-in-the-East, London. Educated in Manchester, Farington was sent to London in 1763 to train in the studio of Richard Wilson. In 1764, in 1765, and again in 1766 he won premiums for landscape drawing from the Society of Artists of which he became a member in 1765. He joined the Royal Academy Schools at their inception in 1769 and was elected ARA in 1783, and RA in 1785. 
Farington contributed yearly to the exhibitions until 1801, then only intermittently until 1813. Without ever holding a major post within the academy, he played a very active role in its affairs, attending general and council meetings and many of the special committees which refined its policies, among them the influential hanging committee which regulated the placing of works in the yearly summer exhibitions. From 1793 he was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and from 1805, although unable to join because of his profession, he took a keen interest in the development of the British Institution, particularly contributing both expertise and loans to the exhibition on Thomas Gainsborough, William Hogarth, and Richard Wilson in 1806, and included an account of the Reynolds retrospective of 1813 in his 'Memoirs of the life of Sir Joshua Reynolds, with some observations on his talents and character' (1819). 
Never having studied abroad in his youth, Farington was sent by William Windham, MP for Norwich, to the Netherlands in 1793 to prepare illustrations for an official record of the siege of Valenciennes. An unpublished notebook of that year (Royal Library, Windsor) records Farington's reaction to the large altarpieces by Rubens which he saw in Antwerp. A second foreign trip, to Paris during the short peace of Amiens in the summer of 1802, was made in the company of Benjamin West, John Hoppner, and Johann Fuseli among others, and introduced him to some of the finest antique sculpture and Italian art looted from Italy by Napoleon, then filling the Louvre (at that time known as the Musee Napoleon). He also took the opportunity of visiting the studios of leading French painters such as Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) and Francois Gerard (1770-1837), with whose polished style he was not in sympathy. Already in his fifties he seems to have been overwhelmed by the richness of the art on view and from then on painted ever more rarely, rather concentrating on the topographical work in which he excelled. It is difficult to make a real appraisal of his paintings as they are scattered in many private and public collections, and rarely appear in art sales. Examples exist in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. 
Farington's real forte lay in the careful, accurate topographical drawings which he prepared for the folios of engravings of British views which found a ready market among tourists confined to Britain by unrest abroad. From 1776 to 1780 he had lived in the north country, painting, drawing, and eventually publishing 'Views of the Lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland' in 1785. In 1794 he published two volumes of a 'History of the River Thames' with seventy-six aquatints, and text by William Combe. In later years he became closely involved with two even more ambitious projects: 'Britannia depicta' (Cadell and Davies, 1808-14) and 'Magna Britannia' (William Byrne, from 1813). The publication costs proved to be so high that neither work was completed. The preparation for these publications necessitated a vast amount of travelling, and Farington undertook yearly tours in late summer and autumn. 
On 19 March 1776 Farington had married Susan Mary Hamond (1750-1800), the daughter and sister of East Anglian clerics and closely related to the Walpole family; their marriage remained childless. After her death in 1800 Farington suffered a breakdown, being left unable to draw or paint. It was with the help of his family and such close friends as Sir George and Lady Beaumont, Sir Thomas Lawrence, and the whole of Robert Smirke's family that he regained his equanimity. He took a close interest in his brothers' numerous children, encouraging their education, advising on their careers, and sympathetic to their sentimental problems. His 'Diary', which he kept from 13 July 1793 until the day of his death (with very few interruptions), contains many accounts of family visits to the north and to Norfolk, and in later years to the south coast and the Isle of Wight. He died on such a visit to his brother Richard in Lancashire, on 30 December 1821, as the result of a fall downstairs from the gallery of Didsbury church, and the last entry in his 'Diary' is a moving tribute from his niece Marianne. 
A tall, urbane man, Farington mixed easily in all branches of the professions and society. Through his own career he had an unrivalled knowledge of the London art world, the daily occurrences of which he recorded in his 'Diary'. With its emphasis on biography and anecdote it is an invaluable source of information on artists of the period and of the internal workings of the Royal Academy. However, the diary also records the social, political, and literary events of the day, though as Garlick and Macintyre note, on these subjects Farington is rarely an original source (Farington, 'Diary', 1.xxxii). Through his own family, Farington had connections with the newly wealthy industrialists of the midlands, and with the East India Company; and through his wife's Norfolk connections and through the election as MP of his cousin, Admiral Gardner, first to Plymouth (1795-6) then to Westminster (1796-1806), he was kept informed on both domestic and foreign policy. Farington attended the major political trials, such as Warren Hastings's impeachment, followed Wilberforce's anti-slavery campaign, and, through his close friend Sir Thomas Lawrence, he was apprised of many details of the 'delicate investigation' into the conduct of the princess of Wales. 
Written for Farington's own amusement and as an 'aide-memoire', the sixteen volumes that constitute his diary passed through the artist's family until they were sold at auction in 1921 to the 'Morning Post'. Published first in serial form, they were edited by the paper's art critic John Greig and published in a series of volumes between 1922 and 1928. Presented to George V in 1934, the diary is now in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. A sixteen-volume printed edition of the 'Diary' was issued between 1978 and 1984 and an index, edited by the author of this entry, was published in 1998.

Farish, William (1759-1837), chemistry teacher, was one of at least three sons of James Farish, vicar of Stanwix, Carlisle. After a few months at Carlisle grammar school, he was admitted sizar at Magdalene College, Cambridge, in March 1774 and graduated BA in 1778, when he was senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman. He was elected fellow and appointed tutor of his college, graduated MA in 1781, and was ordained deacon in 1780 and priest in 1782. 
Farish became professor of chemistry in 1794 and, finding that his colleague F. J. H. Wollaston, Jacksonian professor, dealt ably with the principles of chemistry, chose to concentrate on its practical application. His 'Plan of a course of lectures on arts and manufactures, more particularly such as relate to chemistry' (1796, with later editions) commences with mining and outlines the production and working of metals, ceramics, glass, dyes, and other manufactures; the several annotated volumes that survive hint at his coverage of these topics. Farish enjoyed displays of mechanical ingenuity, manipulating his interchangeable cogwheels, shafts, and clamps to demonstrate the machinery he was describing. He also set up over the pulpit at St Giles a paraboloidal sounding board. He succeeded Wollaston as Jacksonian professor of natural and experimental philosophy in 1813. 
Farish was one of the serious evangelicals who came to dominate Magdalene College in the 1770s and 1780s. He was vicar of Clifton, Nottinghamshire (1797-1802), vicar of St Giles, Cambridge (1800-37), and rector of Norton under Hampdon, Somerset (1806). Farish was popular with the undergraduates, while as junior proctor in 1792 he exerted strict discipline. He resigned his fellowship to marry, on 24 June 1801 at Cambridge, Hannah Stephen (1766/7-1844). Their four sons, James (1801/2-1853), Henry (1802/3-1856), William Milner (1804/5-1863), and George (1809/10-1836), all graduated at Cambridge University. In 1820 Farish took the degree of BD, and in 1836 he was instituted to the rectory of Little Stonham, Suffolk, where he died on 12 January 1837.

Farley, Charles (1771-1859), actor and theatre producer, was born in London. He is said by John Doran to have appeared on stage at Covent Garden as early as 1782, but the first documented record of him is as Prince Edward in 'Richard III' on 11 October 1784, when he was about thirteen years old. From this point on he appeared regularly on Covent Garden's salary list (and also, during the summer seasons, on the Haymarket's), gradually rising at Covent Garden from 15's'. weekly (in 1785-6), to 30's'. in 1790-91, to reach $5 in 1798-9. By this time he had gained experience in a variety of roles (such as Buckle in Benjamin Hoadley's 'The Suspicious Husband' and Lamp in John O'Keefe's 'Wild Oats'). One speciality was the smaller Shakespearian roles, such as Poins, Roderigo, Osric, and Cloten, which were invariably original and distinctive. His salary increased to $10 weekly from 1804-5 and remained at this level into the 1820s. 
Farley is described on the playbill as the composer of the pantomimic ballet 'Raymond and Agnes, or, The Castle of Lindenbergh' (1797), an elaborate setting of an episode in Lewis's 'The Monk', in which Farley played the hero. It logged twenty-two performances and was frequently revived. Farley's interest in pantomime, the staging of spectacle, and the perfecting of tricks made possible by theatrical machinery was stimulated by Thomas Dibdin's arrival at Covent Garden. Among their early projects were 'The Magic Oak' (January 1799), for which Farley was principally responsible -- Dibdin wrote the songs and recitatives -- and 'The Volcano, or, The Rival Harlequins' (December 1799), described on the playbill as 'invented by Dibdin, & produced under the direction of Farley', which was especially impressive for its fiery volcanic opening and mid-air battle between Floridel and Cratero. His most notable pantomime was 'Harlequin and Mother Goose' (1806), praised by 'The Times' for its 'brilliancy of effect, dexterity of trick, activity and variety', among which were a chair which rose into the flies immediately it was sat on, a duck which flew out of a pie, a letter box which changed into a lion's mouth, and a sideboard which transformed itself into a beehive. Grimaldi, who excelled in the role of the clown, was introduced to Covent Garden that season, and Farley tutored him with 'infinite pains' (Dickens, 163) for his exhausting first part as Orson to Farley's Valentine in Dibdin's eponymous play. 
Farley, who was effectively Grimaldi's master, coached the clown in many subsequent roles; and Dibdin paid tribute to his 'indefatigable aid' ('Reminiscences', 1.400) as collaborator. However, Farley was not always keen to claim the extent of his involvement in many of the pantomimes and other pieces his inventive mind crafted for the Covent Garden stage in a more or less unbroken association lasting nearly forty years (1797-1834). An adaptation of Scott's 'Old Mortality' as 'The Battle of Bothwell Brigg' (1820), seemingly outside his usual ground, gave scope to his love of effects. In similar vein was his adaptation of 'Henry IV, Part 2', with additional coronation scenes (1821). 
Farley's long acting career, remarkable for the sheer number of roles he created, belonged in style more to the eighteenth than the nineteenth century. Hazlitt praised him in 1814 for his 'comic personage' ('Works', 18.200); his stentorian voice -- said to have a 'curious bubbling sound' -- could be tuned to fit foppish parts, and his exceptionally large nose (which was in later life reduced by surgery) suited villains. His best villains were the hero in the equestrian drama 'Timour the Tartar' (1811) and Grindoff in Pocock's melodrama 'The Miller and his Men' (1813), with its spectacularly explosive finale. Doran concluded that he was the 'jolliest of millers, most imposing of Tartars, most wicked of sorcerers, most abominable of ruffians, gayest of Frenchmen, most laughable of fops' (Doran, 144). 
Farley survived the increasing tribulations of Covent Garden in the 1820s and early 1830s -- when his author payments sometimes failed to materialize and there were quarrels with James Winston, resented for his interference in preparations for the pantomime -- to retire from the theatre in 1834, after fifty years in the profession. Alfred Bunn, who regretted having no job for him at Drury Lane in 1835, described him as one 'whose industry and great abilities so many years contributed to [Covent Garden's] fortunes and reputation' (Bunn, 2.6). 
The last twenty-five years of Farley's life were spent quietly in retirement, mainly at 3 Hart Street, Bloomsbury. He outlasted most of his contemporaries into a new theatrical era, which, by his death from general decay at the age of eighty-seven, at 42 Ampthill Square on 28 January 1859, had largely forgotten his name and achievements.

Farley, James Lewis (1823-1885), banker and writer on the Middle East, only son of Thomas Farley of Meiltran, co. Cavan, was born at Dublin on 9 September 1823. He was destined for the legal profession, and studied at Trinity College, Dublin. His attention, however, was early directed to Turkey and the East. After the conclusion of the Crimean War and the signing of the treaty of Paris in 1856, the Ottoman Bank was formed by British financiers including members of the Glyn and Mills families, and was initially a wholly British bank, with a royal charter. Farley accepted the post of chief accountant of the branch at Beirut, which he helped establish. In 1858 he published an account of his experiences entitled 'Two Years in Syria', and in 1861 published 'The Massacres in Syria', in which he warmly defended the cause of the Christians. In 1860 Farley was appointed accountant-general of the state bank of Turkey at Constantinople, which subsequently became merged in the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which was set up in 1863 with British, French, and Ottoman shareholders and directors, under the protection of the sultan and his government. It was the government bank with sole rights of note issue. British and French government involvement was also considerable, and the bank was a political as much as a financial institution. 
From this time onward, and from his advantageous position within the bank, Farley was a keen student of Turkish affairs, and gained a wide knowledge of its people and rulers, as well as of its trade and financial condition. He wrote in 1861 an account entitled 'The Druses and the Maronites'. The following year, in 'The Resources of Turkey', he dealt especially with the question of the profitable investment of capital in the Ottoman empire, claiming that the extension of British trade throughout the Turkish empire was mainly due to the energy and perseverance of the Greeks. 'Banking in Turkey' appeared in 1863, to be followed by other books on the country in 1866 and 1872, and in 1875 by the brochure 'The Decline of Turkey Financially and Politically', in which he warned Turkish bondholders of their impending dangers. 
Farley had been on intimate personal terms with Fuad and Ali pashas, but after their fall he severely condemned the misrule and oppression of their successors. In the autumn of 1875 he took a prominent part in public agitations in England in support of Christians living in difficult conditions in Turkey. In October 1875 he proposed to the Russian government a lecture and press campaign among protestant clergy to give a more religious emphasis to the campaign. The Russian ambassador in London suggested to St Petersburg the possibility of a monthly subvention to Farley's campaign, and spent $50 on copies of Farley's 'Decline of Turkey'. 
Prompted by the Bulgarian massacres of 1876, Farley published 'Turks and Christians: a Solution of the Eastern Question', in which he suggested reforms which would combine administrative autonomy for the Christian populations with the maintenance of the authority of the sultan. Some of his suggestions were pressed upon the Porte by the great powers, and ultimately adopted. In 1878 Farley published a descriptive and historical work entitled 'Egypt, Cyprus, and Asiatic Turkey'. 
On the formation of the new principality of Bulgaria in 1880, Farley went to Sofia to be present at the reception of the newly elected ruler, Prince Alexander I. He presented a letter of introduction from the Russian foreign minister which recommended him for his past services to the Bulgarian cause and obtained for him a year's grant to supply the English press with news from Bulgaria. As a result he was later accused of manipulating the English press against Russian policy to ingratiate himself with Bulgarian liberals. On his return to England he published a monograph on the principality and its governor, under the title 'New Bulgaria'. 
Farley was in Egypt during the sultan's visit in 1863, and at Constantinople on the occasion of the royal and imperial visits to the Turkish capital in 1869. Between 1870 and 1884 he was consul for Turkey in Bristol, and made considerable, although not particularly successful, efforts to develop trade between Bristol and the Levant. Farley was a fellow of the Statistical Society of London, a corresponding member of the Institut Egyptien (founded by Napoleon I at Alexandria), and a privy councillor in the public works department of Bulgaria. Because of his great knowledge of Bulgarian affairs his advice was frequently sought when the Bulgarian question agitated Europe in the 1860s and 1870s. Farley died at Bayswater, London, on 12 November 1885.

Farmer, Anthony (b. 1657), college head designate, was born in autumn 1657, the son of John Farmer of Frolesworth, Leicestershire. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, on 14 August 1672, became pensioner there on 3 July 1673, and a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, on 21 April 1676. He proceeded BA in 1676/7, and was incorporated MA on 13 July 1680. For a few months he taught, unpaid, at Chippenham under his relation Benjamin Flower, an unlicensed ejected clergyman. 
Farmer received a testimonial from Trinity on 20 December 1681 for the diaconate; on 1 September 1683 he entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and thence Magdalen College on 13 July 1685. He was admitted to the newly founded Philosophical Society on 28 October 1684 but his academic career was undistinguished and he published nothing. He received conventional testimonials of sobriety and Anglican conformity, signed by the same fellows who were later to accuse him of debauchery and perversion, on applying unsuccessfully for a living (on 9 November 1685) and for a fellowship of All Souls (on 23 October 1686). 
The turning point of Farmer's career was Monmouth's rebellion in summer 1685, when he volunteered for the king, presumably serving under Francis Bagshaw in the Magdalen company. This eagerness for the king's cause must have drawn attention to Farmer at court, for when the presidency of Magdalen came vacant he was nominated by James II in his mandate of 5 April 1687. The fellows resented this infringement of their right of election, and petitioned immediately against the nomination, stating that Farmer was ineligible by statute, never having been a college fellow. This petition was given to Lord Sunderland by Thomas Smith and Bagshaw on 10 April; four days later they were told curtly 'The King expects to be obeyed' (Bloxam, 22). Sunderland had probably neglected to show the petition to the king, a neglect which brought down both dynasty and constitution. On 15 April the fellows elected John Hough as president; the king's surprise at this move was conveyed on 21 April and the college replied, still with nothing against Farmer except the statutory disqualification. Only on 7 May did they begin to frame the astonishing catalogue of moral delinquencies which have blackened Farmer ever since. By late June these accusations were formalized into a charge before the commissioners sent to inquire into the affair. Farmer apparently waived his claim to the presidency (Magdalen College, MS 249, 89) but drew up a convincing defence of his reputation (ibid., 78-88). This failed, and the lord chancellor concluded on 29 July, telling Farmer 'The court looked upon him as a very bad man' (Bloxam, 79). Farmer, who was certainly not a Catholic, and if anything was more sympathetic to presbyterianism, disappeared without trace, his place in history due to the machinations of others, not his own. His last appearance is in a note of 9 August 1687 in the college inventory that he dutifully returned some silver he had borrowed (Brockliss, Harris, and MacIntyre, 50).

Farmer, George (1732-1779), naval officer, born at Youghal, co. Cork, in 1732, was the son of John Farmer, of a Northamptonshire family settled at Youghal, a collateral branch of the Fermors, the earls of Pomfret, extinct in 1867. He went to sea at an early age in the merchant service, and later, after entering the navy, served as a midshipman of the 'Dreadnought' with Captain Maurice Suckling in the West Indies, and in the 'Achilles' on the home station with the Hon. Samuel Barrington. On 23 May 1759 he was promoted lieutenant of the frigate 'Aurora', in which he served until January 1761 on the home station. He was then placed on half pay, and settled for a time in Norwich, where he had been previously employed on the impress service. Here he married Rebecca, daughter of Captain William Fleming, another naval officer: the couple had nine children. In 1766 he is said to have given valuable assistance in suppressing a riot there, and to have been promoted commander on 26 May 1768, in consequence of the representations of the local magistrates. 
Farmer had, however, no further active employment until September 1769, when he was appointed to the sloop 'Swift'. In her he went out to the Falkland Islands, where, on his arrival in the following March, he found that the Spaniards, having established themselves at Puerto Solidad, had sent to Port Egmont, peremptorily ordering the British to quit the settlement. As there was no British force to resist any aggression, the senior officer, Commander Anthony Hunt, determined to go to England with the news, leaving Farmer in command. A few days later the 'Swift' sailed for a cruise round the islands; in a violent gale she was blown over to the coast of Patagonia, and in attempting to go into Port Desire she struck a rock, and was utterly lost. The crew escaped to the shore, but as they were entirely destitute Farmer dispatched the cutter to Port Egmont with orders to the only remaining ship, the 'Favourite', to come to their relief. On 16 April they arrived safely at Port Egmont. On 4 June a Spanish frigate anchored in the harbour; she was presently followed by four others, and the commandant, Don Juan Ignacio Madariaga, wrote to Farmer that, having with him 1600 troops and a train of artillery, he was in a position to compel the British to quit, if they hesitated any longer. Farmer replied that he should defend himself to the best of his power; but resistance against such an overwhelming force could be nothing more than complimentary, and accordingly when the Spaniards landed, Farmer, after firing his guns, capitulated on terms, an inventory of the stores being taken, and the British permitted to return to their own country in the 'Favourite'. After arriving in September 1770 Farmer, on being acquitted of all blame for the loss of the 'Swift', was appointed to the sloop 'Tamar', and on 10 January 1771 he was promoted to post rank. 
In August 1773 Farmer was appointed to the frigate 'Seahorse', and sailed for the East Indies, having among his petty officers Thomas Troubridge, a master's mate, and Horatio Nelson, a midshipman. On returning to England after an uneventful commission, Farmer was appointed in March 1778 to the frigate 'Quebec' (32 guns), in which he was employed during the year in convoy service in the North Sea. In 1779 he was stationed chiefly at Guernsey as a guard for the Channel Islands, and to gain intelligence. As early as 18 June he sent news that the French fleet had sailed from Brest, that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Cadiz, and that there were at Le Havre great preparations for an invading force. On 6 July he wrote that he had driven on shore and destroyed a convoy of forty-nine small vessels, with a 20-gun frigate and several armed vessels; but that the 'Quebec' herself had struck heavily on the rocks, and he had been obliged to throw his guns overboard. This necessitated his going to Portsmouth for repairs, and when these were finished, as there were no 12-pounders to replace the lost guns, he had to be supplied with 9-pounders, which were taken from another frigate not ready for sea. With this reduced armament, off Ushant, on 6 October, the 'Quebec' met the French 18-pounder frigate 'Surveillante' (40 guns) and nearly double the number of men. A sharp action ensued. After about three and a half hours both ships were dismasted. As the 'Quebec''s sails fell the guns caught fire, and the frigate was speedily in a blaze. There was little wind and a great swell; the 'Surveillante', completely disabled, was at some little distance; the cutter 'Rambler' was to leeward, and also dismasted; and the French cutter 'Expedition', which had been engaged with the 'Rambler', had sought safety in flight. It was thus impossible to help the burning frigate, which after some four or five hours blew up. Only sixty-six out of about 195 men on board were picked up by the boats of the 'Surveillante', the 'Rambler', and a Russian vessel that came on the scene; the rest, including Captain Farmer, perished. Farmer had been previously wounded, and his conduct both in the action and during the fire was so highly spoken of that, at the special request of the Board of Admiralty, a baronetcy was conferred (19 January 1780) on his eldest son, George William Farmer (died 1814), an annual pension of $200 to his widow, and $25 a year to each of his eight children, and a ninth not yet born. In so doing the Admiralty board hoped to encourage others to emulate Farmer's 'stubborn gallantry' by signalling that their actions would be commemorated were they to die in action. Farmer's death also gave the Admiralty reason to use the loss of the 'Quebec' for political purposes in the service. As Lord Sandwich, first lord of the Admiralty, was advised, 'officers must be taught to lose the idea of danger in that of glory. Great actions must dazzle as well as burn'. Moreover, 'If this action is properly set forth it will do more Credit to our Arms in Europe and give more Spirit and Enthusiasm to our young officers than a great victory attended with no shocking Circumstance'. Another consideration was doing honour to Sandwich himself, 'no trifling object' given the current temper of the fleet (Mulgrave to Sandwich, 13 Oct 1779, Mulgrave Castle MSS, box vi, 1/441).

Farmer, Hugh (1714/15-1787), dissenting minister and theological writer, was born on 20 January in 1714 or 1715 at Isle Gate Farm, near Shrewsbury, the younger son of William Farmer and his wife Mary Owen. His mother was the daughter of Hugh Owen (1639-1700), who was licensed as an Independent minister in 1672 at Bronclydwr, near Llanegryn, Merioneth, and had been imprisoned for his nonconformity. The Owen family were strong dissenters, and both Hugh Farmer and his elder brother, John, were destined for the dissenting ministry from an early age. They received their early education from relatives at Llanegryn and later at Warrington from Dr Charles Owen, who ran an academy in conjunction with his ministry at Cairo Street Chapel. Farmer became one of the first students of Philip Doddridge at Northampton and soon proved to be among the most able. He was much influenced by the eirenical views of his tutor. 'It was in men like... Hugh Farmer... that the Doddridge spirit in Nonconformity lingered for a quarter of a century after Doddridge himself had departed' (Colligan, 49). 
Farmer commenced his ministry as assistant to David Some at Market Harborough in 1736, and early the following year he was recommended by Doddridge to William Coward of Walthamstow, Essex, to become his private chaplain. Coward, one of the leading dissenting laymen of his day, was then in his late eighties, idiosyncratic, and very rich. He was impressed by the young man, as were other members of the congregation that met at the chapel built by Coward in 1695 at Marsh Street, Walthamstow. Farmer refused an offer of a ministry at Taunton, and following Coward's death in 1738 continued his ministry in Walthamstow in a new chapel built in 1740. Farmer had increased the congregation in a short time, and it was clear that he was well on his way to becoming a notable preacher. 
William Snell, a solicitor, and his wife, Cecilia, who were ardent dissenters, invited Farmer to live with them at Walthamstow in 1737, and he stayed for over thirty years until Mrs Snell's death. Freed of domestic care, he was able to give his whole attention to preaching and theological study. He later warned young ministers not to follow his example, as he did not like 'the care of a house establishment which he had to follow later and being left alone.... When visiting some of his acquaintance, with whom younger ministers boarded, he would sometimes say, in his jocular manner, 'Don't use him too well; treat him roughly, that he may not be tempted to follow my example.' (Dodson, 10)' In the succeeding decades Farmer became a celebrated preacher among the dissenters. He attracted large numbers to hear him at Walthamstow and the congregation expanded considerably, becoming one of the most wealthy dissenting churches in or near London. 'Mr Farmer's services proved highly acceptable, so that he had (with one exception) the largest afternoon audience amongst the Presbyterians; for such was the congregation denominated though Mr Farmer himself ranked with the Independents to the last' (Wilson, 2.60). This dichotomy makes it difficult to categorize Farmer in either denominational or theological terms. Unlike his brother John (a dissenting minister from 1730 to 1758, lastly at Needham Market) he was not a Calvinist, but 'had an admirable talent, without trimming, of pleasing persons of very different temperaments.... His voice was clear, strong, flexible, and harmonious. His address was handsome, insinuating and distinguished by its animation.... When he had raised his voice to a certain pitch, he would happily drop it, in a manner that gave great variety to his elocution, and which had a powerful effect... he was one of the best preachers that have appeared amongst the Protestant Dissenters. (Kippis, 5.681)' In 1762 he accepted the post of afternoon preacher at Salters' Hall, as well as that of merchants' lecturer there on a Tuesday, where he attracted the largest afternoon congregation among the Presbyterian congregations in London. 
Farmer was a radical in theological terms, but refused to join in theological dispute and rejected bigotry in any form. While he appealed to a wide spectrum of thought because he consciously avoided controversies which engendered strife, some of his regular listeners claimed that 'no one ever learned his own views' (Dodson, 32). He did not support the unitarian position, but some of his works were greatly admired by the rational dissenters. The Walthamstow chapel, which started as Independent, was the only one in the London area to eventually become Unitarian, although after Farmer had retired from its ministry. 
Surprisingly few of Farmer's sermons were printed, but he more than made up for this deficiency with his pen. His best-known books were 'An Inquiry into the Nature and Design of Christ's Temptation in the Wilderness' (1761), 'A Dissertation on Miracles' (1771), and 'An Essay on the Demoniacs' (1775). Farmer's views tended towards the rational rather than didactic, particularly on miracles and evil forces. His strong belief in divine sovereignty led him to conclude that invisible agents did not operate in this world. According to the Unitarian minister Thomas Rees, 'He was generally considered as having relinquished all belief in the Devil, and several jokes passed in consequence, in connexion with his name... he did not deny evil spirits however, but with no dominion over the natural world' ('Monthly Repository', 561-2). Farmer held that the demoniacs described in the 'New Testament' were not possessed of the devil or evil spirits but were rather epileptics or deranged in mind; this view, though not novel, encountered strong opposition and was 'considered by some as contrary to the whole tenor of Christian scripture evidence, and subversive even of Christianity itself' (Wilson, 1.104). 
Farmer believed strongly in natural law, but he also argued that the proof of the divine origin of a doctrine is that its statement was followed by a miracle. However, for Farmer the former overrode the latter, a view which eventually undermined the basis for his argument on miracles. The rational dissenters followed these arguments keenly, and in Alexander Gordon's view Farmer 'exercised a decisive influence on the current of opinion in liberal dissent' ('DNB'). 
In the early 1770s Farmer decided to retire from some of his offices. Various legacies had made him financially independent. He resigned his Sunday post at Salters' Hall in 1772 (he had wanted to resign in 1768 but he was exhorted not to do so) due to 'his growing infirmities and frequent returns of disorder, which deprived him of the hopes of preaching twice a day with any constancy' (Wilson, 2.60). In 1780 he retired from the merchants' lectureship and shortly afterwards from his long ministry at Walthamstow. One of the main reasons for his resignation was the deterioration in his eyesight through cataracts, and by the early 1780s he was virtually blind. In 1785 the cataracts were removed, his sight was restored, and he was able to return to his studies. 
No portrait of Farmer is known, but he was described as being tall, spare, of a dark complexion, with small eyes, and prominent nose and chin, 'which gave him a nutcracker face when he lost his teeth' ('DNB'). He never married. He was a lively conversationalist and easily became animated and excited, but was always polite and understanding. Although he did not like keeping house for himself, he maintained an open and liberal table for his many friends at his home in Walthamstow, being generous with both his time and money. In retirement he spent long periods each year at Bath, remaining active on dissenting trusts and preparing papers for publication. 
Farmer was highly regarded by his contemporaries as an outstanding preacher and a cogent theological writer whose clarity and learning reflected the best of the Doddridge tradition. Richard Price writing to Benjamin Franklin in America on 30 September 1772 expressed the general view: 'He is one of the most admired preachers we have' ('Correspondence of Richard Price', 1.142). Farmer died of 'gout of the stomach' (probably cancer) on 5 February 1787 at Walthamstow, and was buried on or about 10 February in the parish churchyard in the Snell tomb. His will made several legacies, but required his executors to burn his papers or they would be rescinded; all his papers were therefore burnt. Farmer describes himself in his will as 'gentleman', and apart from bequests to denominational charities there is no other reference to his connection with dissent and its ministry.

Farmer, John (fl. 1591-1601), composer, was still 'in youth' in 1591, according to a eulogistic poem printed in his collection of canons of that year, 'Divers and Sundry Ways of Two Parts in one... upon one Plainsong'. In the following year he was a major contributor to Thomas East's 'The Whole Book of Psalms'. By February 1595 Farmer was in Dublin, having been appointed organist and master of the choristers at Christ Church Cathedral, and on 10 August 1596 he became a vicar-choral there. An unauthorized absence led to a reprimand in 1597, and he was ordered to return by 1 August on pain of dismissal. In 1598 he was presented to the living of Kilsheelan, partly in co. Tipperary and partly in co. Waterford; he probably appointed a deputy to act for him. By early 1599, when his 'The First Set of English Madrigals to Four Voices' (dedicated, like his canons, to Edward de Vere, earl of Oxford) was published, he had moved to Broad Street in London. In 1601 he contributed a madrigal to 'The Triumphs of Oriana', the collection in honour of the aged Queen Elizabeth. 
Though Farmer's number of publications was modest, they covered a wide range of musical forms and revealed a composer as competent as he was versatile. His 1591 canons show a remarkable resourcefulness and sometimes great ingenuity, Farmer using the same traditional chant forty times as a cantus firmus ('fixed part'), each time devising a different two-part canon against it. At the opposite extreme of technical skill, he provided some simple but wholly admirable four-part harmonizations for seven of the traditional psalm tunes in East's 1592 psalter, and also for the thirteen introductory pieces (including canticles, hymns, and Lord's prayer). But it is for his madrigals that Farmer is remembered. Though his single collection was advertised as for four voices, he slipped in the sonorous eight-voice 'You blessed bowers' at the end, a piece that, like his six-voice 'Oriana' madrigal, 'Fair nymph, I heard one telling', shows his mastery of complex textures. There is one other maverick piece, for in 'Take time while time doth last' Farmer employed a cantus firmus, this time four statements of the same six notes slowly rising and falling stepwise in the tenor; however, the style of the remaining three parts and the heavily moralizing text raises a suspicion that this may in fact have been an earlier piece, perhaps originally for instruments, but to which words had now been fitted. In his true madrigals it is Farmer's deftness and lightness that is his most admirable and appealing characteristic, exemplified in 'A little pretty bonny lass' and above all in 'Fair Phyllis I saw sitting all alone', which has always been one of the most popular of English madrigals. 'Sweet friend, thy absence grieves my bleeding heart' was an occasional piece, composed by Farmer 'for the love of his most dear friend, Edmund Keane', while another, 'O stay, sweet love', also survives in manuscript with a sacred text, 'Look up, sad soul', substituted. A pavan and galliard by Farmer were printed in Philip Rosseter's 'Lessons for Consort' in 1609. Nothing is known of Farmer's later career or of the date of his death.

Farmer, Richard (1735-1797), literary scholar and college head, the second son of Richard Farmer, woolman and maltster, and his wife, Hannah (1712-1808), daughter of John Knibb, was born at Leicester on 15 May 1735. He received his early education at the free grammar school in Leicester under the tutelage of the Revd Gerrard Andrewes, a classical scholar. It was Andrewes and John Simmonds, vicar of the church of St Mary de Castro, who most influenced the young Farmer in his love of books, especially of black-letter literature. On 12 April 1753 Farmer was admitted a pensioner of Emmanuel College, Cambridge; he graduated BA in 1757 and MA in 1760, the same year that he was elected a fellow of the college. As an undergraduate Farmer was not undistinguished, and he enjoyed three college scholarships. Although he did not try his hand at verse after the MA, he was asked to contribute a poem to a collection celebrating the laying of a stone for the new university library in 1755, and there is evidence in the Cambridge University Library of other versifying efforts, the chief of which is a blank-verse tragedy in three acts titled 'Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy', in which he played the duke's brother; the rest of the dramatis personae, selected by him, were fellow undergraduates. He also contributed a sonnet to a collection of poems on the death of George II. It is well that he changed to prose in later life. 
Farmer was ordained in Ely on 15 February 1761 and became a BD in 1767. On 19 May 1763 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, almost surely because it was known that he was gathering materials for the history of his native Leicester, a work he never finished. He gave his materials to John Nichols, who acknowledged his help in his history of Leicestershire, and returned all the subscription money he received. Much later, on 1 March 1791, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Despite a curacy of some fifteen years in Swavesey, a village some 8 miles from Cambridge, and residence in London as part of his ecclesiastical duties, his life was centred in Emmanuel College, which he served in various capacities, as tutor, lecturer, steward, dean, and master, this last beginning on 21 March 1775. That same year he became vice-chancellor of the university and DD; he was admitted 'ad eundem gradum' in 1796 at Oxford University. Upon the death of the university librarian on 27 June 1778 Farmer was elected to that position, which he kept until his death. As a librarian he instituted some needed reforms, but he more than once bought books for his personal library when he should have had the best interests of the university library at heart. 
On 8 July 1769 Farmer was appointed one of the twelve preachers at the Royal Chapel, Whitehall, necessitating stays in London. Other ecclesiastical preferments followed: in 1774 he was elected Lady Margaret preacher in Cambridge; in April 1780 he was collated by Bishop Hurd to the prebend of Alrewas and the chancellorship annexed, founded in the cathedral church of Lichfield; shortly thereafter, in March 1782, he was installed as prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral. Seven years later he resigned the prebend, being preferred by William Pitt to a residentiary canonry and the prebend of Consompta-per-Mare at St Paul's Cathedral on 19 March 1788. This was the highest of his ecclesiastical preferments, although he is said to have refused twice a bishopric, pleading that 'One that enjoyed the theatre, and the Queen's Head, in the evening would have made but an indifferent bishop' (Sherbo, 30). 
For up to fifteen years Farmer was curate of Swavesey, and Thomas Martyn, Farmer's friend who had entered Emmanuel College a year ahead of him, wrote that he was faithful to his duties but 'was not famous as a Preacher. His Sermons were florid, and composed in haste; his enunciation was loud and hurried; his setting-off was so violent as to make nervous people start' (Sherbo, 58). Another account has Farmer giving 'a plain practical sermon, strongly enforcing some moral duty' (ibid., 58). Despite his indolence, being reluctant to get up in the morning, to retire at night, and to settle his accounts, Farmer could act and act forcibly when the occasion demanded. There is the story, varying with the teller, of his violent reaction to the refusal of some members of the university to give up the key to the university chest containing a seal necessary for an address favourable to the king and against the Americans. According to one source, Farmer broke open the door to the place housing the chest; according to another, he broke open the chest itself; according to a third, he used a sledge-hammer to effect his purpose. It may have been a solo effort, although one version has it that he was helped by a blacksmith. This was not the only time, however, that he showed his tory sympathies, his detractors hinting that he thus gained preferments. 
Farmer's intention to write something on Shakespeare and his commentators was known to Thomas Percy as early as October 1763, some four years before the publication of Farmer's 'Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare' in 1767. Prior to 1767 Samuel Johnson had unsuccessfully solicited Farmer's help in the revised edition of his 1765 'Shakespeare' on the occasion of his first and only visit to Cambridge. In March 1770 Johnson again asked for Farmer's help, requesting that he correct and add to a list of translations, compiled by George Steevens, that Shakespeare may have seen and used. Farmer not only obliged on that score, but when the Johnson-Steevens 'Shakespeare' edition of 1773 appeared it also included, in volume ten, a second appendix entitled 'A letter from the Rev. Mr. Farmer of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, author of an essay on the learning of Shakespeare, to Mr. Steevens'. The 'Letter' covered forty closely printed pages, with 247 notes on all the 36 plays of the accepted canon. It deserves belated recognition equal to that of the well-known 'Essay' on Shakespeare's learning. The 'Essay' itself won instant praise, Johnson, for example, declaring that the subject was now closed, and that Shakespeare relied on translations and not on a knowledge of Greek and Latin. Others were not so kind; but, in any event, Farmer greatly revised and added to the 'Essay' for a second edition, published in the same year, 1767. He made a very few corrections for a third edition, published in 1789. He had also gone so far as to mark up an interleaved copy of the third edition, intending to publish a fourth; the interleaved copy is now in the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC (S. a. 138). 
The 'Essay' and the 'Letter' are not Farmer's only contributions to Shakespearian scholarship, for he assisted Edmond Malone in his 'Supplement to the Edition of Shakespeare's Plays Published in 1778' (2 vols., 1780), Isaac Reed in his 1785 edition of 'Shakespeare', and George Steevens in his 1793 'Shakespeare'. Reed published a revised edition in 1803, that included new material by Farmer and Steevens. Farmer also published 'Directions for the study of English history' in the 'European Magazine' in 1791, although written in 1763. This was something of a pioneer essay, for the study of modern history, as opposed to ancient history, was still in its infancy. After mentioning Caesar, Tacitus, and Suetonius as the only worthwhile sources on the subject, Farmer made his way from the 'Monkish writers' to Hume, Smollett, Mrs Macaulay, and others, to 'Collections of 'Letters' and 'State papers''. He also published in the 'European Magazine', in June 1794, a letter to Reed of January 1794, which contained information about certain events in the college career of John Dennis. 
Farmer's help to various scholars, besides Johnson, Steevens, Malone, and Reed, was extensive and important, most notably in the vital role he took in providing information to Bishop Percy for his 'Reliques of Ancient English Poetry'. In May 1780 Samuel Johnson wrote to Farmer asking for information from college or university registers for dates relating to Ambrose Philips, William Broome, and Thomas Gray, and Farmer obliged by giving him an unpublished letter from Pope to Broome, dated 29 April 1730. John Nichols acknowledged Farmer's help in three of his works; James Granger was also indebted to Farmer, as he acknowledged in the advertisement to the second edition of his 'Biographical History of England'. Among others were Richard Gough, John Sidney Hawkins, William Herbert, and Thomas Warton. Without Farmer's help the works of these scholars and others would be far from complete. It was largely, if not solely, from Farmer's reading in black-letter literature and the fine collection of black-letter books and other rare works in his library, that he was able to supplement the knowledge of some of the most learned of his contemporaries. 
Farmer was one of the most gregarious of men. He was a member of at least three London clubs: the Eumelean, the Unincreasable (his friend Reed was president), and the Literary Club founded by Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Both in Cambridge and in London he was surrounded by friends, chief among them Steevens and Reed, both of whom made a number of annual trips to Cambridge. While there they stayed in Emmanuel College and spent virtually all their time with Farmer, dining in college and visiting all the attractions that Cambridge and the nearby villages could offer. They also attended the plays put on by an acting company from Norwich at the annual Sturbridge fair. When in London Farmer attended the theatre just as assiduously and took full advantage of the social life of the city. He was generous to a fault, forgetting the loans he had made and ever ready to lend books from his library. He is said to have loved above all else old port, old clothes, and old books. His addiction to the bottle and the pipe, coupled with his reluctance to retire for the night, eventually took their toll and he died, after painful illnesses, on 8 September 1797 in Emmanuel College, where he was buried. He never married, although his name was linked more than once with that of the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Hatton of Madingley in Cambridgeshire. There is evidence that after Sir Thomas's death, he having opposed Farmer's proposals of marriage, Farmer again proposed and was accepted but got cold feet and broke off the affair, this when he was fifty-two or fifty-three years old. Miss Hatton was twenty years his junior. 
The sale catalogue of Farmer's library contained 8267 lots, some of them running to twenty titles. The sale took thirty-five days and realized $2210, not a princely sum, and one wonders why he did not leave all or some of his books to Emmanuel College or to the university library. He wrote of his library, 'it is believed that 'not many' private Collections contain a greater Number of really 'curious and scarce' Books; and perhaps 'no one' so rich in the ancient 'Philological English' literature' (Sherbo, 106). The large majority of the works cited or quoted in his 'Essay' was in his library. He not only collected books; he read them.

Farmer, Thomas (bap. 1651?, d. 1688), violinist and composer, seems to have come from a musical family. His father may have been the boy who was baptized on 26 November 1615 and apprenticed as musician on 20 November 1626 to Thomas Stevenson (and later Thomas Spencer) of the Drapers' Company, becoming a freeman in 1650. (Many music apprenticeships were arranged through such companies.) Farmer himself may perhaps be identified with the Thomas, son of Thomas and Mary Farmer, baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 26 January 1651. Purcell's elegy 'on the death of Mr. Thomas Farmer' -- 'Young Thirsis' fate ye hills and groves deplore' (to words by Nahum Tate) -- suggests that the musician was a comparatively young man in 1688. 
Farmer, who married a woman named Mary about 1670, comes to notice as a musician during the succeeding decade. At court he served as a violinist-extraordinary (without fee) from 1671 and was promoted to a paid place in the violin band at Michaelmas 1675 following the death of John Strong. At Michaelmas 1679 he gained a further place as violinist in the private musick, shared with Robert King. He received a MusB from Cambridge University in 1684. 
Farmer was a house composer for the Duke's Theatre Company at Dorset Garden and wrote music for a number of plays: Edward Ravenscroft's 'The Citizen Turned Gentleman' (July 1672), Thomas Otway's 'The Cheats of Scapin' (December? 1676), Aphra Behn's 'Sir Patient Fancy' (January 1678), Nahum Tate's 'Brutus of Alba' (June? 1678), John Dryden's 'Troilus and Cressida' (spring 1679), Nathaniel Lee's 'Caesar Borgia' (May? 1679), Thomas D'Urfey's 'The Virtuous Wife' (September 1679), Otway's 'The Soldier's Fortune' (June? 1680), Lee's 'The Princess of Cleve' (September? 1680), and Behn's 'The Second Part of the Rover' (January 1681?); for the United Company, Drury Lane, he wrote music for Lee's 'Constantine the Great' (November 1683). Virtually all his surviving work consists of songs and suites apparently compiled from his incidental music, although most cannot be associated with particular plays. It is described by modern scholars as competently written but dull and unenterprising. 
At the accession of James II the court musical establishment was drastically reduced, but Farmer was reappointed. The warrant to swear him notes that he was 'at sea', showing that he had escaped alive from the wreck of the 'Gloucester' on 6 May 1682. He served in the king's Catholic chapel (opened on Christmas day 1686). His 'A Consort of Musick in Four Parts' was published in 1686 and advertised on 4 November as being available 'at his house in Martlet Court in Bowe street, Covent Garden'. Farmer was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 5 December 1688. He was survived by his wife.

Farmery, John (d. 1590), physician, a native of Lincolnshire, matriculated as a pensioner of King's College, Cambridge, in November 1561, taking his BA there in 1565 and his MA in 1568. He seems then to have practised medicine in London, as an empiric, with powerful patrons. The College of Physicians licensed him on 4 February 1587 and admitted him as a candidate a few days later on 22 February. He became a fellow on 28 February 1589, with an injunction to proceed MD within two years. In September 1589 he graduated MD at Leiden, after receiving testimonial letters from the London college. 
In the same year Farmery was directed by the college to draw up, with Edward Atslowe, Lancelot Browne, and Robert Preest, the formulae of syrups, juleps, and decoctions for the 'Pharmacopoeia'. He is thought also to be the author of 'A Methode of Measuringe and Surveyinge of Land', 'published by J. F., practitioner in physick' (1589). 
Farmery died in the spring of 1590. In his will dated 15 March, and proved 7 April 1590, he described himself as living in 'Alderbert strete' in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, and asked to be buried in his parish church. Farmery was a Roman Catholic. His friend Richard Smith MD, was 'supraveisor' of his will. With his wife, Anne (died 1613), he had two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. His widow afterwards married (licence dated 26 February 1593) the physician Edward Lister, and was buried in the church of St Mary Aldermanbury on 11 December 1613.

Farnaby, Giles (d. 1640), composer, was born probably in London, the son of Thomas Farnaby (died 1595), 'Cittizen and Joyner of London', and his wife, 'Janakin alias Jane' (died 1605) (Thomas Farnaby's will, commissary court of London, 1594/5, 41). According to Anthony Wood he 'was of the family of Farnaby of Truro in Cornwall, and near of kin to Tho[mas] Farnaby, the famous schoolmaster of Kent' (Wood, 257). Nothing else is known of his parental background, though his mother, buried on 27 September 1605 at Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire (Fellowes and Boston), was perhaps of Huguenot descent, judging from her foreign name and the bequests in her nuncupative will favouring the Dutch Reformed and French protestant churches in London (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/107, sig. 36). 
Both composer and artisan, Farnaby began studying music about 1580 and graduated BMus at Christ Church, Oxford, on 7 July 1592. He was bound apprentice to the Joiners' Company in or before 1583, becoming a freeman by 1590, when he is listed as a feoffee. Like his cousin Nicholas (died 1630), also a joiner, he may have specialized in making virginals. 
Farnaby married Katheryne Roane at St Helen, Bishopsgate, on 28 May 1587. The 1589 'parsons tythe' (churchwardens' accounts) records that he subscribed the lowest amount (2's'. 9died) paid by any parishioner that year. In 1591 he was living in the neighbouring parish of St Peter Westcheap, and by 1599 he had moved to St Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside. Three children were born during this period: Philadelphia (1591); Richard, the composer ('c'.1593); and Joy (1599), referred to as 'musitian' in 1636 (Fellowes and Boston). 
About 1600 the family unexpectedly left London. By 1602 Farnaby was churchwarden of St Peter, Aisthorpe, a village just north of Lincoln. The bishop's transcripts, signed 'Egidius Farnaby', record the baptism of Philadelphia in that of 1602 (the previous daughter of that name had evidently died) and Edward in 1604. A diocesan commissioners' report on the parish in 1603 states that 'neither man nor woeman... is either... recusant or... doth not receive the Communion orderly' (Foster, 343). The Farnabys were still in Lincolnshire in 1608 according to an indenture of lease, dated 18 February that year, ratifying a twenty-year agreement between Sir Nicholas Saunderson of nearby Fillingham and 'Giles Farnabie... gent'. Farnaby was to teach music to Sir Nicholas's children and Richard Farnaby was to be apprenticed to instruct them 'in skill of musick and plaieinge uppon instruments' (Lumley MSS, MTD/B17/9). 'Arrears in 1611 suggest that by then Giles may have left the district... The indenture is endorsed 'vacat consensu'' (Owen, 153). In London Richard Farnaby married Elizabeth Sendye at St Peter Westcheap on 13 April 1614. 
Remembered nowadays for his distinctive virginal works, Farnaby was better known to his contemporaries as a vocal composer. In 1592 he contributed eight settings to Thomas East's celebrated 'Whole Booke of Psalmes'; some were reused in the metrical psalters published by William Barley (1599) and Thomas Ravenscroft (1621). He also compiled his own 'Psalmes of David, to fower parts, for viols and voyce, the first booke Doricke mottoes, the second, divine canzonets... with a prelud, before the psalmes, cromaticke'. Dedicated some time between 1625 and 1639 to Dr Henry King, 'cheife prebend' of St Paul's Cathedral, the manuscript cantus partbook alone survives (in the University of Pennsylvania Library). 
Farnaby's only secular publication, 'Canzonets to Fowre Voyces with a Song of Eight Parts', appeared in 1598. Dedicated to Ferdinando Heyborne, groom of the privy chamber, the volume includes prefatory poems by Anthony Holborne, John Dowland, Richard Alison, and Hugh Holland. Concise and melodious, the twenty four-part canzonets, set to predominantly light-hearted texts, combine brief imitation with chordal textures. Most distinctive are the chromatic, sombre setting of 'Construe my meaning' and the densely resonant concluding eight-part 'song', 'Witness ye heavens'. Fragments of two other vocal compositions survive: 'Come Caron, come', a contrafactum of his canzonet 'Ay me, poor heart', lacking the altus and with only the triplex part texted (Royal College of Music, MS 2049); and the altus of a contrapuntal five-part anthem, 'O my sonne Absolon' (BL, Add. MS 29427, fol. 32). 
Farnaby's keyboard manuscripts circulated little. Of fifty-three attributed pieces, all but one appear (fifty-one uniquely) in the so-called Fitzwilliam virginal book, a vast anthology which may have been compiled by the wealthy Cornish recusant Francis Tregian during his confinement in the Fleet prison between 1609 and 1619. All genres are represented, except plainsong settings. At least four of the eleven fantasias are transcriptions of vocal pieces -- two by Farnaby himself. A few of the numerous dances, which include pavans, galliards, allemandes, and jigs, are also arrangements. The approximately dozen sets of variations best reveal his penchant for devising reprises rich in detailed idiomatic figuration. Noteworthy compositions include an 'Alman for Two Virginals' and a suite of four 'character' miniatures: 'Giles Farnabys Dreame', 'His Rest', 'Farnabyes Conceit', and 'His Humour'. Such pieces illustrate an engaging spontaneity and tunefulness few of his contemporaries could rival. Tregian's keyboard collection also includes four pieces ascribed to Richard Farnaby. 
The registers of St Giles Cripplegate for 1634 mention 'the house of Gyles Farnaby in Grub Street', a locality noted in a 1638 survey for its 'extreme poverty' (T. C. Dale, 'The Inhabitants of London in 1638', 1932, 239). They also record the burial of 'Gyles Farnaby musitian' on 25 November 1640.

Farnaby, Thomas (1574/5-1647), schoolteacher and grammarian, was the son of a London carpenter, also named Thomas, and his wife, Dorothy Foxcroft; he was probably the Thomas Fernabye baptized at St Michael Bassishaw, London, on 21 September 1575. According to Wood, he was a relative of the composer Giles Farnaby, whose father was a London joiner. Farnaby matriculated from Merton College, Oxford, on 26 June 1590, aged fifteen. Thereafter he became a postmaster, or scholar, of the college, but rebelled against his religious antecedents and fled to Spain, where he entered a Jesuit college and converted to Catholicism. 
Farnaby was in England once more by 1595 and, 'being minded to take a ramble', obtained a place on the West Indies voyage of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2.105). Unlike his commanders Farnaby survived the voyage, though his wandering spirit was not quite sated by the experience. According to Wood, he served briefly as a mercenary in the Dutch revolt (it is not known whether he was employed by the rebels or his co-religionists) before returning, penniless, to Cornwall, where he taught in a local school for a number of years under the name Thomas Bainrafe (an anagram of Farnabie). There he met and married a local woman, Susan Pierce, with whom he had two daughters and a son. He then moved to an establishment in Martock, Somerset, where 'his distresses made him stoop so low, as to be an Abcdarian' (ibid., 2.105). He appears to have recovered both reputation and a degree of estate there; in the early years of the new century he moved to London to establish a fee-paying school in Goldsmiths' Rents, off Redcross Street, Cripplegate. Sir John Bramston, a former pupil, called it 'a fine airie place; he had joyned two or three gardens and houses togeather, and had a great manie boarders and towne schollars; soe manie that he had 2, sometymes three, ushers besides himselfe'. Describing his own first day there, Bramston recalled Farnaby as a man of some kindness and wit: 'he gave me pen, ink, and paper, and bid me make a theame on ''Ex argilla quidvis imitaberis uda''. I sayd I used to have a weeke to make a theame. I doe not desire much, sayes he, but let me see what thou canst doe. I sett my-selfe to it, and did as well as I could. He came at xj of the clock to see what I had done; and, reading it, cryed out 'Oh Heavens! where hast thou binn bred?'... but I thinke he was unwillinge to discourage me too much. ('Autobiography', 101-2)' Farnaby's reputation thrived. According to J. T. Cliffe, he was '[p]erhaps the most celebrated private schoolmaster in England'. He was incorporated at Oxford in 1616 as 'M.A. Cambridge', and he was a minor canon at St Paul's in London from 1626 to 1629. Wood claimed that 'more Churchmen and Statesmen issued thence, than from any School taught by one man in 'England'' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2.106). Other than Bramston, its pupils included the diplomat Sir Richard Fanshawe, courtier Thomas Henshawe, and the clergyman Henry Killigrew. The success of his establishment allowed Farnaby to devote himself to a long-held obsession: the systemization of the grammatical principles of classical Latin and Greek in print. Commencing with the satires of Juvenal and Persius (1612), he annotated many of the classical authors -- Seneca, Martial, Lucan, Ovid, Virgil, and Terence -- in a manner intended to render their works intelligible to schoolboys. From 1625, with the publication of his 'Index rhetoricus' (incorporating the rules of his 'Figurae, tropi et schemata' of 1616), he established a European reputation in the rhetorical tradition, and numerous foreign editions appeared. A Greek florilegium followed in 1631, and a compilation of words and phrases utilized in Latin poetry, the 'Index poeticus, etc', in 1634. However, despite the financial success he enjoyed (which allowed him to purchase country houses at Otford and Kippington in Kent in the early 1630s), Farnaby remained very sensitive to his former penury, as his jealous defence of his rights indicates. The reimportation from Europe of a great number of his works published inexpensively there reduced his copyright income, and in a series of suits and purchases he reacquired the rights thereon. In April 1632, having petitioned Charles I and the privy council, he obtained a 21-year patent which gave him exclusive rights to publish his own works and prohibited the importation of foreign editions. 
Plague and 'some underhand dealing of his landlords' forced the removal of Farnaby's school from London to his Otford house in 1636 (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2.106). By this time his first wife had died. He then married Anne (died after 1647), daughter of John Howson, bishop of Durham, with whom he had a further two sons. His success continued, and a house and lands at Horsham, Sussex, were added to his estate. Upon the king's personal request Farnaby wrote his final grammarian work, 'Systema grammaticum', in 1641 to supersede William Lily's outdated standard. In the same year, civil war broke out; Farnaby's strongly royalist sympathies, and his alleged involvement in a royalist uprising in Kent in 1643, resulted in his imprisonment without charge in Newgate gaol and thereafter upon a prison hulk. Briefly, the Commons considered transporting him to New England (an ironic anticipation of his influence there, as his 'Index rhetoricus' was later to be one of the first texts used at Harvard). Their inclination, according to Wood, was 'further'd by some of his good neighbours in Kent, nay and by some that had been his Scholars... who sate in the two houses' (ibid.). However, subsequently given into informal detention at Ely Place, Holborn, Farnaby was allowed to return to Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1645. He was working there on his annotation of Terence's comedies when death intervened on 12 June 1647. He was buried in the chancel of the church at Sevenoaks. 
To his wife, Anne, and upon her death to their son, Frances, Farnaby bequeathed his Kippington estate and a third part of the income from lands at Otford, which, like the schoolhouse, he held in leasehold with a number of London merchants and which he stipulated should continue under his name 'soe long as it shall please Almighty God' (will, fol. 148'r'). John, his eldest son, received the lands and house at Horsham. The evidence of his bequests suggests that only three children -- John, Judith, and Frances -- survived their father. 
Farnaby's connections reflected his reputation. He long enjoyed royal patronage, and among his close friends were the lawyer-historian John Selden, the leading Greek scholar and bishop of Hereford Augustus Lindsell, and the playwright Ben Jonson (whom Farnaby sued in 1634 for the recovery of a debt of $120). He also corresponded with the Dutch intellectuals Gerardus Johannes Vossius and Daniel Heinsius, both of whom acknowledged their own debts to his learning. An eminent teacher of pupils of all levels of ability, but litigious and a dangerous creditor, Farnaby was acclaimed by Wood as 'the chief Grammarian, Rhetorician, Poet, Latinist and Grecian of his time' (Wood, 'Ath. Oxon.', 2.106).

Farneworth, Ellis (bap. 1713, d. 1763), translator, was baptized on 21 October 1713, at Mugginton, Derbyshire, the son of Ellis Farneworth ('bap'. 1675), vicar, and his wife, Mary. He attended Chesterfield School under William Burrow and in 1725 was admitted to Eton College as king's scholar. He then proceeded to Cambridge, matriculating as a member of Jesus College on 10 November 1730. In 1734 he took his degree of BA, and in 1738 that of MA. In 1755 he was acting as curate to John Fitzherbert, vicar of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, and on 27 December 1758 he became vicar of Rostherne, Cheshire, by the influence of William Fitzherbert of Tissington, Derbyshire, brother of his former vicar. In October 1762 he was instituted to the rectory of Carsington, Derbyshire, at the instance of his friend, the Hon. James Yorke, dean of Lincoln. 
Farneworth's first two translations from Italian, 'The Life of Pope Sixtus the Fifth... Translated from the Italian of Gregorio Leti' (1754) and 'The history of the civil wars of France... a new translation from the Italian of Henrico Caterino Davila' (1758), respond to the widespread contemporary interest in historical works. While the first translation claims to be 'far from... literal' (p. xi), reacting to criticism of being too diffuse, Farneworth opted for a closer rendering of the second. His most ambitious project was 'The works of Nicholas Machiavel... newly translated from the originals: illustrated with notes, anecdotes, dissertations, and the life of Machiavel' (1762). Farneworth's edition includes a variety of sources: 'The Prince', for example, is followed, chapter by chapter, by Frederick II of Prussia's 'Examen du Prince de Machiavel', the so-called 'anti-Machiavel', and is prefaced by Voltaire's essay on the text. The purpose of the apparatus is thus explained by Farneworth: 'the Editor may truly say, that no pains have been spared to make it acceptable to the Public' (p. vii). Although Farneworth's works were not profitable, his translation of Machiavelli, which he was obliged to 'hawk round the town' (Nichols, 'Lit. anecdotes', 2.391-3), went through a second edition in 1775 and by 1814 sold at a high price (Chalmers, 128). Under the pseudonym Philopyrphagus Ashburniensis, Farneworth contributed a humorous account of Powell, the fire-eater, to the 'Gentleman's Magazine' for February 1755. Farneworth died at Carsington on 25 March 1763.

Farnham, Richard (d. 1642), self-proclaimed prophet, was a weaver who, together with his fellow weaver John Bull, established a religious following in London in the late 1630s and early 1640s. 
Little is known of Farnham's life before his prophesying brought him to the attention of the authorities. He was described in a 1642 pamphlet as being from Colchester, and there is evidence to confirm both his and Bull's connections with the popular godly there. He was married and had five children, but his wife was dead by 1636, when his eldest child was a little over twelve. As a token of England's sinfulness and, he claimed, to fulfil scriptural prophecy, Farnham later took as his second wife a married woman, Elizabeth Addington. In April 1636 Farnham was arrested at Whitehall by the ecclesiastical authorities. On his arrest he was imprisoned in Newgate, from where he was transferred to the Bethlem Hospital. In 1638 the judges at the trial of Elizabeth Addington for her bigamous marriage recommended that Farnham be set to hard labour in Bridewell. There he would have joined his fellow prophet Bull, though it is uncertain whether the recommendation was ever acted upon. Throughout his successive imprisonments Farnham had petitioned unsuccessfully for his freedom, but, following illness, he was finally granted a measure of liberty. He and Bull then returned into a separatist underground that the events of the early 1640s allowed to flourish more openly. Sensationalist pamphlets claimed that Farnham had attracted a group of female followers; the recently discovered conversion narrative of Rose Thurgood, whose description of herself as a sister to Farnham and Bull suggests common membership of a conventicle, provides evidence of Farnham's spiritual counselling. 
Although Farnham has been described as illiterate, his ability to cite freely from the scriptures and to pen appeals to authority reflect a level of literacy often associated with his particular occupation. Farnham's extant petitions, which confirm much of the reports of his beliefs in contemporary pamphlet accounts of his life, make it possible to reconstruct something of his mental world. He and Bull reported themselves to be the two witnesses, predicted in the book of 'Revelation', who would come at the end of the world. This provenance, together with his reading of the scriptures in the 'Old Testament', structured his prophecies and behaviour. Describing himself as 'a Prophet of the most high God' (English MS 875, fol. 242'v'), Farnham claimed that he had been anointed with God's sanctifying spirit and that this had given him an ability to find God's truth in the scriptures and to foretell God's judgments on the world. Farnham prophesied that in his lifetime England would experience God's judgments on its wickedness in the form of pestilence, war, and famine. Although he claimed that he would escape unscathed from these judgments of God, he would nevertheless be slain in order to rise again. Farnham's theology, with its central ideas of justifying faith, repentance, remission of sins, and assurance of salvation, drew on Calvinist predestinatory doctrine. In one of several petitions he sent to Charles I, running to eight pages, Farnham boldly expounded the implications of predestination and damnation, identifying persecuting bishops and clerics with the reprobate and himself as one of the elect of the invisible church freed from the curse of the moral law. In an earlier petition, framed as a series of questions and answers, Farnham attacked the idolatrous innovations of the 1630s. Seeking his release, Farnham asserted his loyalty to Charles I, but even here he trod a fine line. While offering a classic restatement of the politics of passive obedience, repeatedly condemning the Scots for taking arms against their king, Farnham reserved to himself the right to pray against a king who persecuted the true prophets of the Lord. 
Farnham stood in a long line of chiliastic prophets who used claims of divine inspiration and biblical exegesis to claim a public voice otherwise denied them by their humble social status. His reading of the role of the grace of God in freeing the elect from sin reflected the antinomian and heterodox potential within Calvinism. The post-Reformation mental world was increasingly hostile to claims of divine inspiration and suspicious of its associations with social radicalism. Farnham's predictions would have been enough to attract the attention of the authorities, and in the tense politics of the 1630s, where opponents of the Laudian church interpreted poor weather and pestilence as signs of God's disfavour, his predictions could be seen as a direct threat to the Caroline regime. His confident defence in petitions to Archbishop Laud of the superiority of knowledge derived from the spirit against learning, and his willingness to uphold the claims of 'the poor, base and despised ones of the world' against all the bishops and learned men, help to explain why his appeals for release were unsuccessful (TNA: PRO, SP 16/348/13). 
His predictions to the contrary, Farnham contracted plague and died in early January 1642 in Rosemary Lane, London; he was buried on 4 January 1642 at St Mary, Whitechapel. Elizabeth Addington claimed that he (together with Bull who had also died) had risen again and gone to convert the ten tribes of Israel. But Farnham did enjoy a different sort of afterlife. In the religious turmoil of the early 1640s, his history provided good copy for the pamphlet writers. In addition to Thomas Heywood's 1636 printed account, one further pamphlet appeared, 'False Prophets Discovered', and as his incorporation in the title of another suggests, Farnham became a symbol of the threat posed by the growth of sectaries in the mid-seventeenth century.

Farnworth, Richard (c.1630-1666), Quaker preacher and writer, was born at Tickhill, Yorkshire, the son of yeoman parents. Aged about sixteen he experienced a spiritual awakening that led him to attend sermons assiduously, read the 'Bible' and pray diligently, and cease participation in sports. Some four or five years later he questioned formal religiosity, repudiating paedobaptism as carnal and deeming the Lord's supper a sacrifice to devils. For about a year he wrestled with doubts before rejecting the clergy and formal worship. A key influence in his spiritual pilgrimage was an unspecified work by John Saltmarsh that persuaded him to embrace antinomian tenets, the doctrine that spiritual perfection can be attained in this life, and unmediated revelation. For refusing to worship with the family of his employer, Thomas Lord (the uncle of the Quaker preacher and writer Thomas Aldam), whom he had served seven years, he was dismissed. By 1651 he had arrived at a religious outlook similar to that of George Fox, whose preaching at Balby that year convinced him to become a Quaker. 
After leaving his second employer, whom he had served for a year as a husbandman, Farnworth became a Quaker preacher and rapidly attained a stature as one of the movement's leaders while still in his twenties. In the spring of 1651 he was with Fox when the latter travelled from Bradford, Yorkshire, to Pendle Hill, Lancashire, although he apparently declined to climb its summit with Fox. The success they enjoyed in the north-west was reflected in the observation of Wakefield residents that the men had 'made more noice in the Country then the comeinge uppe of the Scotish army' ('Journal of George Fox', 1.38). In July Farnworth and James Nayler, whom he had counselled to 'be of one heart & one minde' went to Swarthmoor Hall to see Fox (Swarthmore MSS, 1.372). Farnworth also preached in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire, and by year's end was holding nightly meetings that attracted nearly 200 at Malton, Yorkshire. 
By 1652 Farnworth was corresponding with Fox and Margaret Fell as well as Nayler, and on 2 December he sent a general epistle containing spiritual counsel to Friends. About the same time he wrote 'A Discovery of Truth and Falshood' (1653), in which he articulated standards of behaviour for magistrates and contrasted the church of Christ with the rotten church of Babylon. Other works quickly followed, including 'The Generall-Good to All People' (April 1653), an attack on a petition from Yorkshire ministers urging parliament not to establish religious liberty; Farnworth was optimistic that 'light is rising in Parliament, and people, to see the deceits of the Priests' (p. 27). In 'An Easter-Reckoning' (April 1653) he set forth principles for social conduct, and two months later, in 'Englands Warning-Peece', he responded to Thomas Robbins's 'The Sinners Warning-Piece', accusing him and other professional ministers of deceitfully fashioning a trade out of the words of saints. 'Light Risen out of Darkness', completed in July but not published until early 1654, refuted John Pomroy's 'A Faithful Discovery' (1653) and defended the Quakers' position on such subjects as the 'Bible', the church, and the place of silence in worship. Farnworth's close relationship with Nayler is reflected in his epistle to the latter's 'Several Petitions Answered' (1653) in which he denounced persecuting priests as members of Satan's synagogue, and in an epistle to Nayler's 'A Discovery of Faith' (1653). In addition to writing or contributing to thirteen books in 1653, Farnworth continued to travel, spreading the Friends' message in Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire. 
Continuing the intense pace in 1654, Farnworth was one of the most productive Quaker writers along with Fox, Nayler, and Richard Hubberthorne. The most important of his works from this time, 'The Heart Opened by Christ', published by June 1654, included a brief spiritual autobiography as well as a warning to the triers not to approve clergy whom God had repudiated. Envisioning himself as David battling Goliath, Farnworth disputed with Baptists at Harlaston, Staffordshire, in September, with clergy in Leicestershire in October, and with Independents at Chesterfield, Derbyshire, in November. He recounted the Leicestershire debates in 'A Character whereby the False Christs... may be Known' (1654), in which he denounced his opponents as false prophets who led people astray, and the Staffordshire confrontation in 'Truth Cleared of Scandals' (1654), in which he defended the Quakers' belief in spiritual ordinances, 'new Songs' of the Spirit, and the doctrine of perfection. After observing alleged Ranters in Leicestershire he wrote 'The Ranters Principles & Deceits' (1655) during the late summer of 1654, arguing that Christian liberty entails freedom from sin, not licentious conduct. From Warwickshire in November he produced 'Witchcraft Cast out' (1655), levelling charges of witchcraft against Nicholas Greaton, a minister from the Lichfield area, and Daniel Bott, a Quaker convert who lapsed and returned to the Baptists. Despite its title, in 'A Woman Forbidden to Speak in the Church' (1655) Farnworth argued that the Spirit could speak through women as well as men in the church, and he cited examples of 'women-laborers in the Gospel' (pp. 7-8). His own spiritual labours in 1654 took him throughout the north midlands, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Yorkshire. 
Farnworth accompanied Fox to the latter's home village of Fenny Drayton (then Drayton in the Clay), Leicestershire, in January 1655, and included Fox's account of that trip in 'The Spirituall Man Judgeth All Things' (1655). The believer has the right to judge, Farnworth asserted, because the things of God can only be discerned spiritually. The same month he wrote 'The Pure Language of the Spirit' to explain the Quakers' use of 'thee' and 'thou' and to defend the right of those called to go naked as a spiritual sign. In February he and Thomas Goodaire (Goodier) disputed with two ministers from the Worcestershire association at Chadwick, but their primary target, Richard Baxter, refused to debate. Farnworth and Goodaire thereupon sent him written queries, to which he replied in 'The Quakers Catechism' (1655). 'Chiefe Priests' in Leicestershire were Farnworth's target in 'A Rod to Drive out the Wild Bores' (1655). In it he espoused the Quaker case against tithes and proclaimed that the gospel was taught by divine revelation, not human wisdom. In Worcestershire in March he completed 'The Brazen Serpent', setting forth his views on such topics as predestination, the new covenant, justification, and the atonement. Still interested in debating with Baxter, Farnworth and Goodaire disrupted him as he preached at St Swithin's, Worcester, in May, an act that resulted in Goodaire's imprisonment. Farnworth also visited southern Wales in 1655. 
With an appetite for controversy, Farnworth joined Nayler on 31 May 1655 in debating a small group known as the Manifestarians, led by Thomas Moore, at Glentworth, Lincolnshire. Farnworth challenged them to a fortnight's fast during which they would ingest only water and preach without recourse to books. 'Antichrists Man of War' (1655), a refutation of Edmund Skipp's 'The World's Wonder' (1655), was composed in the spring and is noteworthy for Farnworth's claim that Quakers could heal by laying hands on the sick, as he had reputedly done himself in 1651. In June he turned his attention to John Stalham's 'Contradictions of the Quakers' (1655), a critique of which he provided in 'The Scriptures Vindication Against the Scotish Contradictors' (1655). Stalham retorted in 'The Reviler Rebuked' (1657), which includes a statement about Farnworth's early life from a Yorkshire minister. Farnworth also replied to Thomas Pollard's 'The Holy Scripture Clearing it Self' (1655), an attack on his 'Truth Cleared', in 'The Holy Scriptures from Scandals are Cleared' (1655); in the same work Farnworth responded to John Griffith's 'True Gospel Faith'. While at Banbury, Oxfordshire, to attend the trial of Anne Audland in September, Farnworth was incarcerated for refusing to doff his hat to the mayor. Offered his freedom if he paid the gaoler's fees and left town, he refused and remained in prison for eight months. While there, in January 1656 he refuted the Worcestershire association's 'Agreement... for Catechizing' (1655) in 'A True Testimony Against the Popes Wayes' (1656), charging that the association was perpetuating forms of worship established by archbishops and bishops if not the papacy itself. 
During the ensuing five years Farnworth's activity decreased, possibly, as has been suggested, because he was troubled by the Nayler affair, but ill health, exacerbated by imprisonment, is a more likely explanation. William Penn reported that Farnworth's health was poor during the last sixteen years of his life. Moreover, his reduced activity began before Nayler's ill-fated entry into Bristol in October 1656. Farnworth was in Westmorland in August 1656 and then at Balby in November for a meeting of Quaker elders from Lincolnshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire; they issued an important epistle on church order and discipline. Early in 1658 he wrote 'Truth Exalted and Truth Abased' (1658), expressing his conviction that this was the end time, warning his readers against false Christs, attacking the psalter of Sternhold and Hopkins because only God can teach Christians to sing, and concluding with provocative queries to parish priests. A year later in 'A Confession and Profession of Faith' he espoused the Quaker view of the 'Bible' and magistracy and defended the Friends from charges that they were Jesuits and vagabonds. William Dewsbury reported to Margaret Fell in October 1661 that Farnworth had been powerfully raised up and was visiting Friends. 
Farnworth was again imprisoned, this time at Nottingham in the autumn of 1662. This was the context for 'The Quakers Plea with the Bishops' (1663), composed in November 1662, in which he responded to a bill of presentment accusing Quakers of recusancy; he denied the charge on the grounds that the Friends, 'the sanctified and beloved people of God' (p. 4), were the church. While in prison he saw a copy of a paper by Lodowick Muggleton and was prompted to send him a letter denouncing his claim to possess a divine commission and to be one of the two witnesses in 'Revelation'. Muggleton printed the letter with his reply in 'The Neck of the Quakers Broken' (1663), pronouncing a sentence of eternal damnation on Farnworth for blaspheming the Spirit. In the same book Muggleton replied to Farnworth's 'Truth Ascended' (1663), a sustained argument against Muggleton's claims. Well after Farnworth's death, Muggleton referred to him in 'The Answer to William Penn' (1673) as a fat red dragon filled with fury. In August 1663 Farnworth turned his criticism against the dissident Quaker John Perrot, whom he accused of doctrinal innovations. Four months earlier Farnworth had written 'The Spirit of God Speaking in the Temple of God' (1663), in which he defended the Quakers' practice of waiting silently until the Spirit moved them to speak. 
In April 1664 Farnworth went to London, where he spent his final years. It was probably at this time that he acquired the modest legal knowledge reflected in some of his late works. In 'Gospel Liberty Sent Down from Heaven' (May 1664), a tract in defence of freedom of conscience, he averred that the 'Conventicle Act' guaranteed such liberty to godly people, including Quakers, who were innocent of all plotting. Pursuing his case in 'Christian Religious Meetings' (June 1664), he contended that the 'Book of Common Prayer' permitted the godly, again including Friends, to gather for worship because such meetings were not seditious. His legal interests were even more evident in 'The Liberty of the Subject by Magna Charta' (August 1664), for here he cited not only 'Magna Carta' but also Sir Edward Coke's 'Institutes', assorted statutes, and the patristics to argue for the legality of Quaker meetings and the rights of citizens. Again writing with the intensity that characterized his early years as a Friend, Farnworth pressed his case for the right of Quakers to meet under the 'Conventicle Act' in 'Christian Tolleration' (1664), 'The Publique Worship' (1664), and 'A Tolleration Sent Down from Heaven' (December 1665). An epistle exhorting Friends to remain faithful in times of persecution, composed in August 1664, was published with letters from John Whitehead and Thomas Green in 'A Tender Visitation of Heavenly Love' (1664), and he reiterated this theme in 'A Loving Salutation' (May 1665), which also included an epistle by Thomas Salthouse. 
Farnworth's last tract, 'Truth Vindicated' (1665), refuted a letter by Perrot, and in May 1666 he and ten other Friends signed 'A testimony from the brethren' denouncing Perrot and his followers. Probably drafted by Farnworth, 'A testimony' emphasized the importance of subordinating individual judgement to the meeting, recommended that Quaker writings be reviewed before publication, and called for more organization. Farnworth died of a fever on 29 June 1666 in the parish of St Thomas the Apostle, London. An intense, dedicated man who wrote more than forty books and pamphlets and liked to preach from 'Revelation', he once attacked a reputed Ranter who had disrupted a meeting at Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, shoving him against a wall and stuffing cloth in his mouth. Josiah Coale described him as 'a man of great abilities, and parts, and knowledge', adding that 'the Sword of his mouth was very sharp' ('Last Testimony', 5, 7).

Farquhar, Sir Arthur (1772-1843), naval officer, was a younger son of Robert Farquhar of Newhall, Kincardineshire, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of James Morison, of Elsick, provost of Aberdeen in 1745. William Farquhar (1774-1839) was a younger brother. He was educated at Aberdeen by a private tutor, and entered the navy in October 1787 on board the 'Lowestoft'. After serving in several other ships, mostly on the home station, and having passed his examination, he entered on an East India Company's ship. He had scarcely, however, arrived in India when news of the war with France led him to enter on board the sloop 'Hobart', from which he was removed to the flagship, and in April 1798 was promoted lieutenant. On his return to England as first lieutenant of the 'Heroine' he was employed in various ships on the home, Mediterranean, Baltic, and North Sea stations, until promoted commander on 29 April 1802. 
In January 1804 Farquhar was appointed to the bomb (mortar) vessel 'Acheron'. On 4 February 1805, when in company with the sloop 'Arrow', he was in charge of convoy but was captured by two large French frigates, after a defence that was pronounced by the court martial (28 March 1805) to have been 'highly meritorious and deserving imitation' ('GM', 545) ['see 'Vincent, Richard Budd]. Farquhar was acquitted, and a few days later, on 8 April, he was advanced to post rank. He was afterwards presented with a sword, value $100, by the patriotic fund, and by the merchants of Malta with a piece of plate and complimentary letter, 19 September 1808. 
From 1806 to 1809 Farquhar commanded the 'Ariadne' (20 guns) in the Baltic and North Sea, during which time he captured several privateers, French and Danish. On 15 August 1809 he married Jane Murray (died 1816); they had four children, of whom two predeceased their father. From 1809 to 1814 Farquhar commanded the frigate 'Desiree' in the North Sea, captured many privateers, gunboats, and armed vessels, and was senior naval officer in the operations in the Weser, the Ems, and the Elbe in 1813, which culminated in the capture of Gluckstadt on 5 January 1814. For these important services Farquhar was made a knight of the Sword of Sweden. In 1815 he was made a CB, in 1816 KH, and in September 1817 he received the freedom of Aberdeen. From May 1814 to April 1816 he commanded the frigate 'Liverpool' (40 guns) at the Cape of Good Hope, and from 1830 to 1833 the 'Blanche' in the West Indies, with a broad pennant; for his services there during a slave revolt he received the thanks of the house of assembly of Jamaica, a sword valued at $150, and a piece of plate from the merchants. He was made KCH in 1832 and on his return home in 1833 he was dubbed knight bachelor. He became rear-admiral in 1837, and died at his residence, Carlogie Cottage, Aberdeenshire, on 2 October 1843.

Farquhar, George (1676/7-1707), playwright, was born in Londonderry, one of seven children of an Anglican clergyman. He was educated under a schoolmaster named Walker. His wife later claimed that he served as a volunteer under Colonel Hans Hamilton at the battle of the Boyne in 1690, although he was then a mere thirteen years old. He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 17 July 1694 at the age of seventeen as a sizar, that is, one who served at table in exchange for food and lodgings. In May 1695 he received an exhibition of $4 a year, which was suspended when he and some other students behaved inappropriately at Donnybrook fair, but restored in February 1696. His formal education ended abruptly: according to early accounts he was dismissed for a profane witticism when asked to write about the miracle of walking on water. 
By 1696 Farquhar had joined the acting company in the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, but stage fright and a weak voice hampered his performances. He is said to have played Young Bellair in George Etherege's 'The Man of Mode', Careless in Robert Howard's 'The Committee', Young Loveless in Francis Beaumont's and John Fletcher's 'The Scornful Lady', and other roles. After two seasons he left Smock Alley when, as Guyomar in John Dryden's 'The Indian Emperor', he forgot to exchange his sword for a foil and consequently injured the actor playing Vasquez. At Smock Alley Farquhar had met Robert Wilks, the actor who was later to bring his comic heroes to life on the London stage. According to biographers, Wilks suggested that Farquhar leave acting and write comedy. 
In 1697 or 1698 Farquhar headed for London, probably with a draft of his first play, 'Love and a Bottle', in hand. He fell ill along the way, a circumstance referred to in his two works of 1698, 'Love and a Bottle' and a novella called 'The Adventures of Covent Garden'. Frequent bouts of illness marked both his life and his writings. Farquhar perhaps suffered from rheumatic fever; he often wrote of long and debilitating fevers, rheumatism, and aching extremities, particularly hands so excruciatingly painful that sometimes he could not hold a quill. 
The hero of 'Love and a Bottle', a young Irishman freshly arrived in London and devilishly successful with the ladies, has generally been accepted as self-referential; the poet Lyrick says in the play that the hero 'is always the Poet's Character'. Farquhar was a handsome young man, a frequenter of such haunts as The Rose tavern near the theatre, attracted by and attractive to women, witty, and good-humoured. He painted an epistolary picture of himself, published in 'Love and Business' (1701), as a melancholy yet amorous and inconstant person. He viewed himself as Epicurean in his tastes and a lover of ease; people liked him because he was not pretentious, malicious, or angry by nature. He had very little estate except for: 'what lies under the Circumference of my Hat.... I ought to thank Providence that I can by Three Hours Study live One and Twenty with Satisfaction my self, and contribute to the Maintenance of more Families than some who have Thousands a Year. ('Works', 2.352)' 
'Love and a Bottle', embellished with songs and dances, opened very probably in early December 1698, and had a successful run. It was published on 29 December. 'The Adventures of Covent Garden' was published anonymously on 15 December (but dated 1699), and was supposedly loosely based on Antoine Furetiere's 'Le roman bourgeois' (1666), translated as 'Scarron's City Romance' (1671). Farquhar, a man of rare creativity and great productivity, seldom borrowed lines from others but often recycled his own plot ideas and lines of poetry; the romance is attributable to him because of materials he reused in 'The Constant Couple'. 
By spring or summer 1699 Farquhar was writing 'The Constant Couple, or, A Trip to the Jubilee', the comedy that made him famous. In it he developed the character of Sir Harry Wildair, played to perfection by his friend Robert Wilks, who afterwards went by the sobriquet of that character; a second actor, Henry Norris, came to be known as Jubilee Dicky from his comic servant in the same play. Farquhar created a new kind of rakish hero, less extravagant and foppish, more believably human, a known war hero. During rehearsals or the early run, act V scene i was almost entirely rewritten to reduce sentimentality and make Sir Harry's airy, flippant character consistent to the end. The comedy opened in November 1699 and had an unprecedented run of fifty-three nights in London and a reported twenty-three in Dublin in its first season, a record that remained unbroken until John Gay's 'The Beggar's Opera' played sixty-two times in London in 1728-9. The young playwright's talents were proven; at twenty-one years old, he was by far the season's most successful playwright. 
In a time of unquestioning adherence to neo-classical principles, the critics fumed at the audiences' delight in this very modern comedy. Critics and Farquhar himself gave Wilks the credit for the phenomenal success, but it was Farquhar's creation of Sir Harry as well as Wilks's portrayal of him that changed the nature of comedic heroes. The play was published on 11 December 1699 with the date 1700, and on 1 February the second edition appeared. The comedy became a perennial favourite in the theatres, invariably known by its subtitle, the 'Trip to the Jubilee'; it ran more than 400 times in the eighteenth century, with its greatest popularity, after the premiere season, in the 1730s and 1740s. Sir Harry, always a favourite role for actors, became a favourite breeches part for women, most notably Peg Woffington, who performed the role seventy-three times between 1740 and 1757. 
Farquhar stayed busy about the theatre that season, writing prologues and epilogues. One night he heard sixteen-year-old Anne Oldfield reading 'The Scornful Lady' behind the bar of her uncle's Mitre tavern in St James's market. He admired her reading so much, so the story goes, that he recommended her to the playwright John Vanbrugh. Vanbrugh then introduced her to Christopher Rich, who hired her as an actress at Drury Lane. She had not yet become a featured actress when 'The Constant Couple' opened, but she took over the role of Lurewell after the reigning actress, Susannah Verbruggen, died in childbirth. 
Farquhar attended John Dryden's funeral on 13 May 1700 with some bemusement; he described the extravagant pomp and ceremony in a letter in 'Love and Business'. On 7 August 1700 he sailed for the Netherlands, where he stayed until after 23 October. Again he suffered 'a very tedious Fit of Sickness, which had almost sent your Friend a longer Journey than he was willing to undertake at present', but he managed to write interesting travel and love letters ('Works', 2.320). 
Back in London, Farquhar wrote a sequel, 'Sir Harry Wildair', to cash in on the runaway popularity of 'The Constant Couple'. It opened, probably in April 1701, with the popular actors continuing in their original roles; it was published on 13 May. A marriage comedy, as sequels inevitably were, it featured Sir Harry Wildair as a relapsed rake, suffering the boredom of marriage to a chaste wife and tricked by his spouse to shock him back into matrimonial bliss. The play realized mild success but then disappeared from the theatres for thirty-six years. 
Although Farquhar's genius lay in comedy, he dabbled in many other genres. During the spring and summer of 1701 he published letters and poems in several miscellanies. The correspondence included exchanges between Farquhar and dramatist Susanna Carroll, later Centlivre, as Damon and Astraea. By 3 July he had signed an agreement with Bernard Lintott for his own 'Letters and Poems', actually published on 22 November with the date 1702 as 'Love and Business:... a Discourse Likewise upon Comedy in Reference to the English Stage'. Farquhar pulled together any scraps he could find to fill out the miscellany, early poems, written while he was still a student, as well as others clearly written after he went to London. Letters, several written from Holland, included romantic ones to Anne Oldfield (his 'Penelope') and the widow Margaret Pemell; there was an epilogue for Catharine Trotter's 'The Fatal Friendship'. 
But it was the 'Discourse upon Comedy' that evoked the outrage of Farquhar's detractors. Farquhar audaciously attacked Aristotle, Scaliger, Vossius, and all the lesser critics who followed Aristotle's 'fixt and immutable' rules of poetry, as well as the modern playwrights who were 'hoodwink'd' into obeisance. He had no patience for the unities of time, place, and action or for the playwrights and critics who blindly followed them. The attack on neo-classical tenets was shockingly forthright; coming from a young newcomer so unforgivably successful with audiences, it infuriated the critics. 
Farquhar usually wrote easily and rapidly, but the afterpiece 'The Stage-Coach' proved agonizing. This was the only dramatic work for which he had a collaborator, Peter Anthony Motteux, a French dramatist on the English stage, and it was his only attempt at translation, an Anglicization of Jean de la Chapelle's 'Les carrosses d'Orleans'. Farquhar disliked the task, being accustomed neither to collaboration nor to translation. It opened between autumn 1700 and February 1702 at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was the only dramatic piece that Farquhar ever wrote for Thomas Betterton's troupe. Afterpieces, which supplemented full-length plays in extended programmes, were still a rarity, and no record of the first run exists, but throughout the years audiences loved it. It ran in London on 182 known occasions and probably many other times not recorded. In 1730, two years after John Gay's 'The Beggar's Opera' took London by storm, 'The Stage-Coach' was transformed into a ballad opera at Goodman's Fields. The farce was not published immediately after the first run; it was probably considered too inconsequential and even too short for separate publication. Eventually three distinct texts, from three different manuscripts, appeared, the first in Dublin in 1704 when Farquhar was there, the second, perhaps from Motteux in London in 1705, and the third, probably a playhouse copy, in Farquhar's 'Works' dated 1736. 
Farquhar next chose to adapt Fletcher's 'The Wild Goose Chase' (1652). In 'The Inconstant' he cut the number of characters, invented new dialogue, and changed the plot line almost entirely in the last half of the play. Although translations and adaptations were the stock-in-trade of contemporaneous playwrights, Farquhar's originality was irrepressible even when he tried to adapt a work; after 'The Inconstant' he never tried again. 

'The Inconstant' opened at Drury Lane in February 1702 with a prologue by Motteux. Wilks once again played the lead. Even before it opened, it was vilified by the critics, still seething over the 'Discourse upon Comedy'. Nevertheless, the comedy ran six successive nights, and might have proved hardier except for the death of King William on 8 March. It did not play again for fourteen years, but from the 1730s it continued in the repertory throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 

'The Twin-Rivals' followed ten months later. A very different kind of comedy, perhaps influenced by the success of Richard Steele's sentimental 'The Funeral' a year earlier, it opened on 14 December 1702. Like Steele's comedy, it dealt with serious crimes, a stolen inheritance and attempted rape; the stakes are far higher than those of the usual drawing-room comedies of the period. The critics attacked the play even before it opened, and the first run was disappointing. Farquhar by now had produced the extraordinarily successful 'Constant Couple' followed by one successful but inconsequential afterpiece and three comedies received tepidly by audiences and savagely by critics. For more than three years he wrote no new plays. 
Farquhar was reputed to have had numerous liaisons, including ones with Susanna Carroll and Anne Oldfield. Probably some time in 1703 he married Margaret Pemell, a widow, older than he, with three children. She tricked him, it is said, into believing she was rich, but after the vows he discovered the truth. He fathered two daughters. Despite Margaret's deception, he remained loyal to her until the end. 
Whether motivated by his familial responsibilities or his theatrical disappointments, in 1704 Farquhar secured a lieutenancy as a grenadier in the earl of Orrery's regiment raised for service in Ireland. By summer he was recruiting, perhaps in Shrewsbury. Recruiting was a risky enterprise since the standard pay was very low; officers sometimes had to supplement it out of their own pockets; if the men deserted, the officers were personally liable for the levy money. Having raised troops, Farquhar was sent to Dublin, where his brother was a bookseller. Hoping to recoup his recruiting losses, he arranged with Smock Alley to perform the role of Sir Harry Wildair in 'The Constant Couple', and reportedly his benefit earned him $100. By autumn 1705 there was a new need for troops, and Farquhar may have been sent back to England on another recruiting tour. According to Orrery, Farquhar was assiduous in raising the regiment 'to the great prejudice of his family', that is, at his own expense (Sutherland, 171). 
Although Farquhar's wife claimed that he remained an officer until he died, the biographers tell a sadder story. Farquhar applied to the duke of Ormond, lord lieutenant of Ireland, for preferment and was promised a captaincy if he relinquished his commission as lieutenant. He obligingly did so, but then was gravely disappointed when the captain's commission was given to another. He returned to London, desperate for money. That winter he tried his hand at an epic on the battle of Barcelona in 1705. The epic was a genre for which he totally lacked talent, and he never published this attempt, either because he found it unworthy or perhaps because its hero, Charles Mordaunt, earl of Peterborough, had fallen from the Queen's favour. 
By February 1706 Farquhar had a mere fifteen months to live, yet during this period he produced his two best-known, liveliest comedies, 'The Recruiting Officer' and 'The Beaux' Stratagem'. Duped into marriage and familial obligations, tricked out of his military commission, melancholy by nature, reviled by critics, he transcended his difficulties to create two of the most spirited and good-natured comedies on the British stage. 

'The Recruiting Officer' clearly reflected Farquhar's own experience. Local citizens claimed the characters were based on people he knew in Shrewsbury; the hero, Plume, of course played by Wilks, was considered yet another rendering of the author himself; for the first time Anne Oldfield, as Silvia, acted in one of Farquhar's premieres. The opening on 8 April 1706 at Drury Lane produced an immediate and enthusiastic response; the comedy ran ten nights despite the fact that it opened so late in the season. By the next year both houses were performing it, and thereafter it became one of the most popular plays on stage, running 512 times in London during the century. In the 1730s it was acted at four to six houses every year, and it was reportedly the first play ever staged in Australia, performed by convicts in 1789. Even the critics grudgingly admired 'The Recruiting Officer', admitting that Farquhar's comedies played well on stage. He was recognized for his freshness and good nature. The comedy was published on about 25 April 1706 and frequently republished; more than fifty editions appeared in the eighteenth century. 
Eleven months later, on 27 January 1707, Lintott paid Farquhar $30 for another manuscript, at that point called 'The Broken Beaux', but later called 'The Stratagem' on stage and 'The Beaux' Stratagem' in print. Farquhar also published a bagatelle early in 1707, 'Love's Catechism', a flirtatious secular catechism later echoed by Archer and Cherry in the new comedy. He finished his masterpiece during his final illness. One florid biographer depicted him lying ill and penniless in his lodgings when Wilks, noticing he had not been to the theatre for more than two months, sought him at his old address in York Buildings and discovered he had moved. Finding him ill in a back garret in St Martin's Lane, Wilks suggested he write a comedy, and left him some money. Farquhar, only weeks from death, then wrote his sprightliest and most humane comedy. 

'The Stratagem' opened on 8 March 1707 at the new Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket, to which many of the Drury Lane actors had defected. Wilks as Archer and Oldfield as Mrs Sullen joined others who had regularly appeared in Farquhar's plays. The comedy was immediately successful, and the theatres competed shamelessly by running other Farquhar comedies against it. It played 632 times during the eighteenth century, 194 times as benefits for actors and others, who picked the most popular plays to assure good receipts. It was published on 28 March 1707; more than fifty editions appeared during the eighteenth century. 
But Farquhar was probably too ill to care. Contemporaries said he died of a broken heart brought on by Ormond's failure to produce a captain's commission, and indeed his heart may have been to blame for his early demise. The symptoms which afflicted him at least all his adult life suggest a condition which could have led to rheumatic heart disease or bacterial endocarditis, an infection of the heart valve which causes an invariably fatal decline over a few months. He certainly seemed aware he would not recover. 
Farquhar was reportedly visited by Wilks after 'The Stratagem' opened and told that Oldfield had complained of Mrs Sullen's being too loosely used since she went with Archer before she was divorced from Sullen. Farquhar suggested Wilks tell her to marry him, and in a fortnight she would be a widow in earnest. He died soon after and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 23 May 1707. 
Farquhar's wife, Margaret, widowed a second time and left with four small children including his two young daughters, never gave up using his fame to improve her own fortune. She petitioned the queen for redress for her two lost husbands, both of whom had served in the military. She published the epic 'Barcelona', even with apparent gaps in the text, and she dedicated it to the earl of Peterborough, now restored to favour. There were also charity benefits for Farquhar's daughters as late as 1750. 
With his last two plays, Farquhar finally got recognition appropriate to his achievements. His entire career had spanned a mere eight and a half years. Seven comedies, an afterpiece, a novella, a miscellany, a discourse on comedy, poems, songs, prologues, and epilogues, not to mention a military career, marriage, and parenthood were comprehended in that short span. As a playwright, measured by number of performances and editions throughout the century, he won incomparable popularity, and his plays continue to be performed and read three centuries later. He influenced comedy with believable characters, fallible and funny, humanly inconsistent, foolish and endearing. His extravagant rakes were impetuous but likeable; his women were full of spirit and intelligence. The characters became so familiar that they inevitably shaped other characters written for the same actors and deeply influenced eighteenth-century comedy. After his death critics finally admitted that he had a 'genius' for comedy, that he was, as Dr Samuel Johnson said, 'a man whose writings have considerable merit' ('Boswell's Life of Johnson', ed. R. W. Chapman, 1953, 1070).

Farquhar, John (1751-1826), merchant and entrepreneur, the son of John Farquhar, was born at Bilbo, in the parish of Crimond, Aberdeenshire. Born of humble parents, at the age of fifteen he was awarded a bursary to attend the Marischal College of Aberdeen. After four years of study, he was entitled to the award of MA, and he soon moved on to London. From there he secured the post of surgeon's mate on an East Indiaman bound for China, but he jumped ship and became surgeon on a vessel making for Calcutta instead. On arrival in Bengal, he became a writer employed in a merchant's office near Barrackpore and he began to dabble in his own private commercial activity. In his spare time he amused himself with chemical experiments, and this led to the eventual acquisition of a large personal fortune. The gunpowder manufactured at Pultah in the interior having been found unsatisfactory, Farquhar was selected by Lord Cornwallis, governor-general of Bengal, to conduct researches and render his assistance. This proved so valuable that he was made superintendent of the factory, and ultimately became sole contractor to the government. His energy and ability soon acquired for him both wealth and influence, and he won the special confidence and favour of Warren Hastings. 
In 1814 Farquhar returned to England, in possession of about $500,000 which was invested in the government fund set up to cover the national debt. Farquhar took up residence in Upper Baker Street, Portman Square. He was a bachelor whose sole attendant was an old woman, and his house soon became conspicuous for its neglected appearance. He himself was often mistaken for a beggar in the street. An eccentric figure, Farquhar nevertheless retained a sharp sense of business acumen. He became a partner in the great agency house of Basset, Farquhar & Co. in the City, and purchased a share in the Whitbread brewery. His wealth, as it accumulated, was invested in the government funds and was devoted partly to the purchase of estates. In 1822 he purchased Fonthill Abbey from William Beckford for $330,000, and he occasionally lived there until the fall of the tower in December 1825, shortly after which he sold the estate. Though penurious in his personal habits he was fond of attending sales, and was a keen bidder for any object that struck his fancy. Notwithstanding his idiosyncrasies, contemporaries commented on his personal warmth, generosity, and devotion to charitable works. 
Besides having a special knowledge of chemistry Farquhar was an accomplished classical scholar, and also excelled in mathematics and mechanics. His religious beliefs were modified by his strong admiration of the moral system of the Brahmans. He wished to expend $100,000 for the foundation of a college in Aberdeen, with a reservation in regard to religion, but on account of a difficulty about parliamentary sanction the scheme was not carried out. He died suddenly of 'apoplexy' at his home in New Road, Regent's Park, on 6 July 1826 and was buried on 13 July at St John's Wood Chapel. At the time of his death, his wealth amounted to well over a million pounds, and there was much public interest in the distribution of his estate. This interest was heightened by the disappearance of a will that Farquhar was believed to have made in Calcutta in 1814. The will was thought to have contained a large bequest to be used for educational purposes in Scotland, but when the prerogative court of chancery considered the case in 1829 Sir John Nicholls decreed that Farquhar had in fact died intestate. Accordingly the estate was divided between Farquhar's seven nephews and nieces, and the administration was on 20 December 1838 at under $500,000.

Farquhar, Sir Robert Townsend, first baronet (1776-1830), colonial governor, was born on 14 October 1776, the second son of Sir Walter Farquhar (1738-1819), first baronet and physician, and his wife, Anne (died 22 Sept 1797), the daughter of Thomas Stephenson and the widow of Dr Harvie. He was educated at Westminster School, and in 1793 obtained a writership in the East India Company's service, at Madras. He became commercial resident at Amboyna (in the Moluccas) in the late 1790s, and in 1802, at the peace of Amiens, was appointed commissioner for adjusting the British claims to the Moluccas, with responsibility for transferring those islands to the Batavian republic. In 1804-5 he served as lieutenant-governor of Penang. He published a scheme for encouraging Chinese labourers to migrate to the West Indies, as 'Suggestions for counteracting any injurious effects upon the population of the West India colonies from the abolition of the slave trade' (1807). On 10 January 1809 he married Maria Frances Geslip (died 1875), the daughter and coheir of Francois Joseph Louis de Latour of Madras. 
Farquhar arrived in Mauritius with the conquering British army in 1810, and served as governor and commander-in-chief until 1817, and again from 1820 until 1823. He drew up and published a chart of the neighbouring island of Madagascar and the north-eastern archipelago of Mauritius, drawing attention to new fields for British trade and urging the necessity of opening up Mozambique and east Africa. His attempt to set up an establishment on Madagascar in 1810 resulted in the deaths of all concerned. He made determined efforts to abolish the local slave trade, carried on principally by French privateers, and concluded effective treaties ending the trade with both Madagascar and Muscat. In 1821 he was created a baronet. He resigned in 1823 and on his homeward voyage visited Madagascar, where he was received with great ceremony. 
Farquhar, who adopted the additional surname Townsend in 1824, was elected to parliament in 1825 for the borough of Newton in Lancashire, and the following year was returned for Hythe, which he continued to represent until his death. He was also a director of the East India Company and of the Alliance Insurance Company. He died at his home, Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, London, on 16 March 1830.

Farquhar, Sir Walter, first baronet (1738-1819), physician, born in October 1738, was son of Robert Farquhar (1699-1787), minister of Garioch in Scotland, and his wife, Katherine (died 1798), daughter of Walter Turing, minister of Rayne. He was educated first at King's College, Aberdeen, where he remained for four years and took the degree of MA. It was in Aberdeen that he started to study medicine under James Gregory; but in 1759 he left for Edinburgh, where, as well as in Glasgow, he continued his medical studies. Without graduating in medicine Farquhar entered the Army Medical Service, being appointed to the 19th regiment, and took part in Lord Howe's expedition against Belle Ile off the coast of Brittany in 1761. As his regiment was stationed for a long time in Gibraltar, he obtained leave of absence, and spent nearly eighteen months in France, attending the hospitals in Paris and elsewhere. For several months he lived with and studied under Claude Nicolas le Cat, a celebrated anatomist and surgeon of Rouen. Farquhar returned to Gibraltar, but resigned from the army in August 1769, owing to ill health, and settled in London, where he began to practise as an apothecary in Great Marlborough Street. He was very successful, and his practice gradually became that of a physician. Shortly after settling in London he married Anne (died 1793), the widow of Dr Harvie, a physician, and the fourth daughter of Thomas Stephenson of Barbados; they had three sons and four daughters. Their second son was Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, governor and commander-in-chief of Mauritius. 
After obtaining the degree of MD from Aberdeen on 29 January 1796, Farquhar became a fellow of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh on 3 May 1796, and licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, on 30 September in the same year. He was created a baronet on 1 March 1796, and was shortly afterwards appointed physician-in-ordinary to the prince of Wales. This did wonders for Farquhar's professional reputation and he soon had a high-class clientele that included William Pitt and Lord Melville. In 1813 Farquhar partially withdrew from practice, and he died on 30 March 1819 in London, after suffering respiratory problems. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. 
Farquhar was considered a very able and successful physician, a judgement, it appears, based on his personal qualities rather than his contributions to medical knowledge, which were few, if any.

Farquharson, James (1781-1843), writer on science, was born at Coull, Aberdeenshire, the son of John Farquharson, excise officer. Educated first at the parochial school at Coull, he went in 1794 to King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated AM in 1798, and in 1799 he was appointed schoolmaster of Alford, Aberdeenshire. He then began to study theology, and was licensed to preach. On 17 September 1813 he was ordained minister of Alford, where he remained thereafter. On 19 October 1826 he married Helen, daughter of Alexander Taylor, with whom he raised a family of five sons and a daughter. 
Farquharson's leisure was devoted to theological and scientific study, in particular meteorology, though his knowledge extended also to botany, chemistry, zoology, and the agriculture of his region. Several of his scientific essays dealt with the aurora borealis, which he studied closely for many years. In 1823 he published in the 'Edinburgh Philosophical Journal' a far more accurate description of the aurora than had previously appeared. In the Royal Society's 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1829 he reported new observations that showed that the structure and motion of the aurora's arches and streamers followed the lines of the earth's magnetic field, proving that they represented the same phenomenon. Although this assumption was correct, Farquharson erred in believing that the visible aurora lay in the lower atmosphere -- on one occasion he believed it to occur below the stratus layer. For his observations on the aurora he was elected to the Royal Society in January 1830. 
In a paper published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1836, Farquharson explained the formation of ice at the bottom of running water, a phenomenon already discussed by Arago and others, in terms of the radiation of heat from the bottom of the stream cooling its bed more quickly, under certain conditions, than the water flowing over it. He also sent the Royal Society copies of the registers of temperature that he kept for a long period of years. This led him to investigate the origin and progress of currents of colder and warmer air moving over the face of a flat country surrounded by hills, and their effects upon vegetation. His paper on the nature and localities of hoar frost was of sufficient agricultural interest to be published in the 'Transactions' of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland for 1840. 
Farquharson corresponded with like-minded scientists in Scotland and England, and contributed frequently to the 'Aberdeen Journal'. The university of King's College conferred upon him the degree of LLD on 25 February 1837, and the following year he became an honorary member of the Societe Francaise de Statistique Universelle. He was considered a moderate in ecclesiastical matters, and conservative in his political views. His writing included religious works: his essay 'On the form of the ark of Noah' (published 1831) was followed by an account of the animals designated in the 'Old Testament' by the names of Leviathan and Behemoth, and by 'A New Illustration of the Latter Part of Daniel's Last Vision and Prophecy' (1838). He furnished the account of the parish of Alford for the 'New Statistical Account of Scotland' (vol. 12, 485-524). Farquharson died on 3 December 1843 at Alford.

Farquharson, John (1699-1782), Jesuit, was born on 19 April 1699 at Auchindryne, Braemar, Aberdeenshire, the second son of Lewis Farquharson (died 1727x9), laird of Auchindryne, and his wife (and first cousin), Margaret Farquharson (died 1719x33). In July 1714 he went to the Scots College at Douai, French Flanders, and in September 1718 he entered the Jesuit noviciate at Tournai in the Southern Netherlands. Having made his vows on 20 September 1720 he studied philosophy and taught humanities, and then, after four years' further study, graduated in theology. He returned to Scotland in October 1729 as a priest and, being a Gaelic speaker was, after some time near Dingwall with William Mackenzie, fifth earl of Seaforth, stationed in Strathglass in eastern Inverness-shire, a traditionally Catholic district. 
Farquharson was professed of the four vows on 2 February 1736. His activities in Strathglass gave much concern to the local presbytery in 1743-4. After the defeat at Culloden in 1746 he gave himself up to save his people from spoliation; he was taken by boat from Inverness and confined in a man-of-war in the River Thames for some months under harsh conditions. Released and exiled after fifteen months' imprisonment, he was at Douai in February 1748, but he set out for Scotland in July and served again in Strathglass. Being captured in 1753 and having his bail forfeited, he went to Douai once more, and was made prefect of studies. When Jesuits were banned in France in 1764 he accompanied the community to Dinant in the Southern Netherlands and he was minister in the college in 1766-9; after the suppression of the order in 1773, he returned to Scotland and settled with his nephew in Braemar, where he died on 22 August 1782. He was buried in Castleton kirkyard, Braemar. 
Information on Farquharson from oral tradition is anecdotal and imprecise and sometimes conflicts with the evidence. He is said to have built a chapel and house at Fasnakyle in Strathglass and at some point to have been captured by government soldiers and taken to Fort Augustus, but released. A Gaelic poem by him, 'Rabhadh MhicShimidh' ('Warning to Lord Lovat'), has survived and he transcribed a volume of Gaelic poetry, mostly Ossianic, from oral sources, which was left at Douai and later maltreated and destroyed. Bishop John Geddes commended Farquharson's simplicity and exemplary virtue.

Farr, Samuel (1741-1795), physician, born in Taunton, Somerset, was the seventh son of a Bristol merchant and alderman, possibly named Thomas Farr. Both his parents were protestant dissenters and the Farr family were part of the powerful mercantile elite in the city. Farr was educated first at the free grammar school, Bristol; then at Edinburgh, where he was a member of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh in 1762-3; and finally at Leiden University, where he took the degree of MD in 1765. He was a physician at Bristol Infirmary from 1767 to 1780, and practised for some years in Bristol. He kept a meteorological journal there for the years 1774-8, extracts of which appeared in the 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'. On 25 February 1779 he was elected FRS. He later returned to Taunton and acquired an extensive practice there. He was a diligent writer, and published several well-received medical works. He also translated works by Hippocrates and Fascelius. Farr died at Upcott, near Taunton, in the house of Mr John Fisher, on 11 March 1795.

Farr, William (1807-1883), statistician and epidemiologist, was born on 30 November 1807 in Kenley, Shropshire, the first of five children of John Farr (1783-1864), farm labourer, and his wife, Catherine (1780-1845). While he was still an infant his parents moved to Dorrington near Shrewsbury and entered the service of John Pryce, a bachelor then about seventy years of age. When his parents moved again soon after, the young child remained with Pryce, and on 28 October 1814 was formally indentured as a parish apprentice to his patron. Pryce's patronage allowed William Farr to leave the working class and to enter a profession; he was the only member of his family to do so. Pryce provided his charge with a modest primary education and local medical training in Shrewsbury. From 1826 to 1828 Farr read medicine with a physician, a Dr Webster of Shrewsbury, served as a dresser to a surgeon at the Shrewsbury Infirmary, and served a nominal apprenticeship to an apothecary. In November 1828 Pryce died and left Farr $500 to complete his education, and the following spring Farr set off for Paris where he attended medical lectures. His study there was cut short by the revolution of 1830. He returned to London and, over the next two years, attended lectures at University College, replaced the house surgeon at the Shrewsbury Infirmary for six months, and on 29 March 1832 became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, his only earned medical qualification. 
In 1833 Farr married a Miss Langford (died 1837) (about whom nothing is known today) and tried to establish a practice at 8 Grafton Street, Fitzroy Square, London. To make ends meet the couple took in lodgers, and Farr, who had little taste for ordinary practice, offered a public lecture series on 'Hygiology' and took up medical journalism. Between 1835 and 1840 he published four articles in 'The Lancet', helped edit the 'British Medical Almanack', and along with R. Dundas Thomson initiated the short-lived weekly 'British Annals of Medicine, Pharmacy, Vital Statistics, and General Science'. Farr's writings in these years reflect the complaints of ordinary practitioners against the privileges and power of the London medical establishment. He also wrote a series of pieces on vital statistics, which culminated in his chapter 'Vital statistics' in John Ramsay McCulloch's 'A Statistical Account of the British Empire' (1837). This chapter helped establish his reputation as a statistician. 
In 1837 Farr's prospects changed. His friend and former teacher Dr Webster died and left Farr his library and $500. Also in that year Farr's first wife died. The four-year marriage had produced no children. Farr married for a second time in 1842. This marriage, to Mary Elizabeth Whittal, lasted until her death in 1876, and resulted in eight children, five of whom survived their father. Their most famous child was Florence Farr, the actress. Finally, in 1837, Farr received a temporary appointment to the General Register Office to help organize the data from the newly created system of vital registration of births, deaths, and marriages. On 10 July 1839 he joined the official establishment as compiler of abstracts at the modest salary of $350 per year. He spent the remainder of his career at the General Register Office providing the statistical direction of the office and creating unforeseen uses for the registration data. Furthermore, by using his letters to the registrar-general in the latter's annual reports, Farr found a forum that permitted him to transcend the confines of his original duties, to establish himself as a world authority on vital statistics and epidemiology, and to address a wider readership in medicine, government, and social science. In recognition of the importance of his work, his title was changed in 1842 to superintendent of the statistical department and his salary steadily increased so that by the 1870s it nearly equalled that of the registrar-general. 
Farr worked on forty-one annual reports, oversaw the 'Weekly' and the 'Quarterly' reports, and helped to plan and write the reports for the census enumerations of 1851, 1861, and 1871. Four of his special reports offer the best evidence of his mature statistical work: his two decennial supplements to the registrar-general's annual reports (the supplement to the twentieth-fifth report for the years 1851-60, 1865, and the supplement to the thirty-fifth report for the years 1861-70, 1875), and his two volumes on the cholera epidemics (the special report on the 1848-9 epidemic, 1852, and supplement to the twenty-ninth annual report on the 1866 epidemic, 1868). 
During his career Farr developed and popularized methods which have become standard tools in vital statistics and epidemiology. He designed (1839) and twice revised (1842 and 1855) a statistical nosology, or classification of diseases, for tabulating reported deaths. This nosology was used for the remainder of the century, and long influenced the 'International List of the Causes of Death'. He showed how environmental risks to health could be elucidated by comparing crude mortality rates or, better still, standardized rates, for populations living under different conditions. He also helped to ensure that the life table would be accepted as the best measure of the longevity of a population, and he computed three life tables for England and Wales (for 1841, for 1838-41, and for 1838-54), a life table for the health districts of England, and life tables for special populations, such as British miners. In addition he demonstrated how life table techniques could be employed to study a wide range of phenomena: human fertility, promotions in the army and civil service, the circulation of gold coins, and the duration of English governments. 
One of Farr's chief preoccupations was the discovery of laws of disease. This was originally related to his own interest in theoretical medicine, in particular in using organic chemistry to develop a more consistent simple and law-like theory of disease. His approach to this problem was initiated by the discovery that mortality in life tables changed regularly with age during three periods of life, a relationship first brought to his attention in the 1830s by Thomas Rowe Edmonds. Using techniques he had first encountered in the construction of theoretical or model life tables Farr then discovered mathematical expressions to predict the waning of epidemics of smallpox and rinderpest, to describe the relationship of soil elevation to cholera mortality, and to demonstrate that mortality varied inversely with mean proximity of population. The latter two laws helped, in his own view, to confirm his zymotic theory of disease, which attributed epidemic, endemic, and infectious disease to the products of organic decomposition which usually entered the body via the respiratory tract. 
Farr was committed to public health reform and used many of his reports to demonstrate the waste of human life caused by preventable conditions in British cities. From the mid-1850s to the mid-1860s he worked closely with Florence Nightingale on hospital and army sanitary reform, preparing appendix 72 for the report of the army sanitary commission (1857-8), serving on the committee of army medical statistics (1861), working as a member and the paid actuary consultant for the Indian sanitary commission (1859-63), and defending Nightingale in the controversy over the third edition of her 'Notes on Hospitals' (1863). 
Farr was a frequent witness before other parliamentary investigations: select committee on insurance associations (1852-3), select committee on income and property tax (1861), royal commissions on mines (1864), and the royal sanitary commission (1868-9). He designed the Post Office insurance scheme (1864) and served as a private actuary consultant as well. He was an active member of the Statistical Society of London and of the International Statistical Congress, and he received during his career many professional honours. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1855. While a fellow he agitated for the society to keep more careful biographical records of its fellowship. When George Graham, the second registrar-general, retired in 1879, Farr applied for the post. When the appointment went to another, he retired (January 1880) amid protests from the medical profession that his talents and contributions had been overlooked. That year he was made companion of the Bath and received the British Medical Association's gold medal. In March 1880 a testimonial fund was begun in his honour to provide support for his three unmarried daughters whose financial future was endangered by some of Farr's unwise investments. He died on 14 April 1883 at his home, 78 Portsdown Road, Maida Vale, London, and was buried on 20 April at Bromley Common church.

Farrant, Richard (c.1528-1580), musician and theatrical producer, is of unknown parentage. An upbringing in the music of the church may be presumed, since he occurs as a lay gentleman of the Chapel Royal by July 1553. He formed a close association with Richard Bower, master of the choristers of the Chapel Royal, and married his daughter Anne (died in or after 1582). Following Bower's death in 1561 he received probate of his will as proxy for his widow. On 24 April 1564 he resigned his position in the Chapel Royal upon his appointment as master of the choristers of the choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. 
Farrant had been a simple singing-man in the Chapel Royal's choir of thirty-two men and twelve boys, attending daily the full Latin mass and office during Mary's reign and, after June 1559, the three services of the vernacular 'Book of Common Prayer'. At Windsor he shared the duties of organist with the lay clerk John Marbeck, directed the musical parts of the three daily services sung by the choir of nineteen singing-men and ten boys, and lodged and educated the boys and trained them in all aspects of their musical participation. 
Elizabeth I took a delight in being entertained at court with plays and shows at the two principal festal times of year, and from St George's Chapel Farrant emulated the example set by Sebastian Westcott with the choristers of St Paul's Cathedral and by William Hunnis with the Chapel Royal boys. He brought the Windsor choristers to court once a year to present before the queen a play prepared during their spare time in the weeks beforehand. From 1567, the boys performed at court at Shrovetide, transferring in 1572 to the twelve days of Christmas. Farrant received the financial reward of 10 marks, which rose to $10 in 1574. 
Meanwhile, as the intensity of the work of the Chapel Royal became increasingly attenuated towards the end of the 1560s it became possible for its personnel to combine membership with parallel appointments elsewhere, and on 5 November 1570 Farrant was readmitted as a gentleman of the Chapel Royal while still retaining his engagement at Windsor. Thereafter he held both offices until his death, dividing his time between the two. At first he lived principally in Windsor, but presently moved to London after making an arrangement with Hunnis under which, as from 25 March 1576, Farrant effectively assumed the mastership of the Chapel Royal choristers in addition to his employment at Windsor. His office at Windsor was mainly carried out by a deputy from then on. 
Locating affordable accommodation for the Chapel Royal choristers whenever the sovereign was resident in London or its environs had long been a problem for their master. Farrant embarked upon the creation of a permanent solution, renting with effect from 29 September 1576 suitably capacious premises within the former Dominican friary (the Blackfriars). He advised the landlord that he proposed to use the premises for teaching the Chapel Royal boys; this function the building could not accomplish without providing also for their catering and accommodation. 
The boys' musical and liturgical functions in the Chapel Royal and Farrant's pedagogical duties supporting them were the same as, and as demanding as, those at Windsor. However, there still remained spare time to be filled, and on 5 January 1577 Farrant combined his Chapel Royal and Windsor boys in a play at court entitled 'The History of Mucius Scaevola'. Judging by the generosity of Elizabeth's gratuity, this was an artistic success. Nevertheless, Farrant did not persevere with the daunting logistics of combining two sets of boys based 25 miles apart; thereafter when he presented plays at court it was with only the Chapel Royal boys. He offered one play annually, most commonly during the festivities at Shrovetide. 
At Blackfriars Farrant set up that early example of a public theatre for which he is now best remembered. It was located barely 300 yards from the almonry of St Paul's Cathedral, where only a little earlier Westcott had begun to reap financial reward from the plays prepared by his boys for performance at court; he allowed the paying public to watch the dress rehearsals, so creating a makeshift theatre out of the boys' dining hall. At Blackfriars Farrant did the same thing. His lease granted leave to knock two existing rooms into one, probably to create a space sufficiently large to serve as a hall for the boys' teaching, dining, and recreation. Here, admission of the public to performances of the plays also acted at court made of the school hall, suitably adapted for a few weeks of each year, a second private theatre on the western side of the city of London. Farrant's entrepreneurship, like Westcott's, played an important role in developing among the public that appetite for stage plays on which was founded the celebrated achievements of the following generation of playwrights and actors. By 1580 he was building up a repertory, since as well as 'The History of Alucius', presented at court on 27 December 1579, his boys performed a comedy at Lincoln's Inn on 9 February 1580. 
No texts of any of the fifteen plays known to have been produced by Farrant have survived, and it is not known whether he himself wrote any of them. The titles of six are recorded; these suggest that his interests were primarily in classical history and mythology. All no doubt were replete with the music for solo voice and viols which was the boys' speciality. 
Throughout his career Farrant enjoyed opportunities to compose, though little has survived. His two brief anthems for the prayer book service, 'Call to remembrance' and 'Hide not thou thy face', match their music to the flow of words with a particular felicity that compensates entirely for the prevailing lack of contrapuntal content. Like the functional 'Short Service', these are for four voices, the popularity of all three items being suggested by the large number of pre-Commonwealth copies. Of three non-ecclesiastical vocal pieces, two are stage songs for solo boy's voice and viols. 'Oh Jove, from stately throne' was written for the play 'King Xerxes', performed at court on 6 January 1575; the other comes from an unidentified play on the story of Panthea and Abradatas. Here the instrumental accompaniment is full of contrapuntal engagement, above which the voice stands out in direct and affecting simplicity. In a similar style, but for domestic use, is the sacred consort song 'When as we sat at Babylon', a setting for solo boy, brief four-part chorus, and viols of a metrical version of 'Psalm 137'. Eventually this was adapted as a verse anthem with organ for church use. 
Farrant made his will on 30 November 1580 and died on the same day. He bequeathed to his wife the family home in Greenwich, responsibility for their ten young children, and the lease of the Blackfriars property. Although Hunnis (who resumed his duties) and the Chapel Royal choristers left in 1582, this was bidding to become a regular theatre by the time a hostile landlord closed it down in 1584. It was not the boys' hall but their living quarters that eventually became Shakespeare's Blackfriars Theatre early in the next century.

Farrar, John (1802-1884), Wesleyan Methodist minister and biblical scholar, was the third and youngest son of John Farrar, Wesleyan minister, who died in 1837. He was born at Alnwick, Northumberland, on 29 July 1802. On the opening of Woodhouse Grove School, Yorkshire, for the education of the sons of ministers on 12 January 1812 he became one of the first pupils. On leaving school he was employed as a teacher in Mr Green's academy at Cottingham, near Hull. In August 1822 he entered the Wesleyan ministry, and spent his four years of probation as second master in Woodhouse Grove School. He married Sophie, youngest daughter of the Revd Miles Martindale, governor of the school, about 1823. He afterwards was resident minister successively at Sheffield, Huddersfield, Macclesfield, and London. In 1839 he was appointed tutor and governor of Abney House, Stoke Newington, a preparatory college for the training of ministers. In 1843 he became classical tutor at the newly built Wesleyan Theological Institution at Richmond, Surrey, where he spent fourteen years. He returned to Woodhouse Grove School in 1858 as governor and chaplain, becoming known there for his firm discipline. On the foundation of Headingley College, Leeds, in 1868, another college for the training of Methodist ministers, he became the first governor; failing health compelled his retirement in 1876. During his residence there the jubilee of his ministry occurred, when he was presented with an organ for the college. 
Farrar served Wesleyan Methodism as an administrator, teacher, and writer. He was secretary of conference on fourteen occasions, and was elected its president for a second time in 1870. He was financial secretary and, for nearly twenty years, chairman of the Leeds district (1858-76). He wrote two useful dictionaries which fostered a taste for biblical literature and the church history published in 1851 and 1853 respectively, as well as handbooks on the places and proper names of the 'Bible'. His thorough knowledge of Methodism, together with his judicious and dignified manner, earned him wide respect. Farrar died at 19 Bainbrigg Road, Headingley, Leeds, on 19 November 1884, and was buried in Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, near his former home in Finsbury Park, on 25 November.

Farre, Arthur (1811-1887), obstetrician, younger son of John Richard Farre (1775-1862), physician, of Charterhouse Square, London, was born in London on 6 March 1811. Frederic John Farre was his brother. He was educated at Charterhouse School and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. After studying medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, he graduated MB at Cambridge in 1833 and MD in 1841, and he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1843. In 1836-7 he lectured on comparative anatomy at St Bartholomew's, and from 1838 to 1840 on forensic medicine. In 1841 he succeeded Robert Ferguson as professor of obstetric medicine at King's College, and as physician-accoucheur to King's College Hospital, offices he held until 1862. At the Royal College of Physicians he was in succession censor, examiner, and councillor, and was Harveian orator in 1872. For twenty-four years (1852-75) he was examiner in midwifery to the Royal College of Surgeons, but resigned with his colleagues William Priestley and Robert Barnes when the college resolved to admit Sophia Jex-Blake and other women to the examination in midwifery. Farre and the other examiners resigned on the grounds that as the women did not possess qualifications in medicine or surgery they were automatically excluded from holding the midwifery licence. Although the plan was successful in the short term (no suitable successors could be found to fill the post of examiner) the action by Farre and his colleagues hastened parliamentary action that led to the 'Russell Gurney Act' (1876), which empowered all licensing bodies to examine women for medical qualifications. 
Farre's personal qualities enabled him to be a successful and fashionable obstetrician; he attended the princess of Wales and other members of the royal family, and was made physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria. His principal contribution to medical literature was an article on 'The uterus and its appendages', constituting parts 49 and 50 of Todd's 'Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology' (1858). He contributed numerous papers on microscopy to the 'Royal Microscopical Society's Journal and Transactions', and was president of the society in 1851-2. An early microscopical paper of his, 'On the minute structure of some of the higher forms of polypi' ('PTRS', 1837), secured his election into the Royal Society in 1839. On the death of Sir Charles Locock in 1875, Farre was elected honorary president of the Obstetrical Society of London, to which he gave a valuable collection of pelves and gynaecological casts. Farre enjoyed music and was a keen photographer. In manner he was precise and formal. He died at his home, 18 Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, Westminster, London, on 17 December 1887, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 22 December. His wife predeceased him and there were no children. Shortly after her death he fell out of his bedroom window, and broke his ankle. He was never the same again.

Farre, Frederic John (1804-1886), physician, second son of John Richard Farre (1775-1862), physician and ophthalmologist, was born in Charterhouse Square, London, on 16 December 1804. He was educated at Charterhouse School, where he was gold medallist in 1821, and captain in 1822. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, with a foundation scholarship, and graduated in 1827. After studying medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, he graduated MA in 1830, and MD in 1837. In 1831 he was appointed lecturer in botany at St Bartholomew's, and from 1854 to 1876 he was lecturer on materia medica. On 23 July 1836 he was elected assistant physician to his father at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, and from 1843 until his death, he was full physician. He married Julia Fanny, daughter of Kensington Lewis, on 12 September 1848; she and their two daughters survived him. 
Farre was elected to the Royal College of Physicians in 1838, and held the offices of censor in 1841, 1842, and 1854, lecturer on materia medica from 1843 to 1845, councillor from 1846 to 1848 and 1866 to 1867, examiner in 1861-2 and 1866-7, treasurer from 1868 to 1883, and vice-president in 1885. Before he resigned the office of treasurer he presented the college with a copious manuscript history of its proceedings, compiled by himself. He was one of the editors of the first 'British Pharmacopoeia', published by the General Medical Council (1864), and also of an abridgement of Jonathan Pereira's 'Materia medica', published in 1865 with later editions in 1872 and 1874. His paper 'Treatment of acute pericarditis with opium' in 'St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports' (1866) recommended abandoning the harmful mercurial treatment then in fashion. 
Farre was a successful lecturer and teacher, being clear and simple in style, and agreeable in manner. He had considerable private practice for many years in Montague Street, Russell Square. In 1870 he was obliged through age to retire from active work, though he was still able to attend the Royal College of Physicians. He died at his home, 35 Elsham Road, Kensington, London, on 10 November 1886.

Farre, John Richard (1775-1862), physician, son of Richard John Farre, a medical practitioner, was born on 31 January 1775 in Barbados. After school education on the island he began to study medicine under his father; in 1792 he went to England and continued his studies for a year under Thompson Forster at the medical school of the United Borough Hospitals, formed by the hospitals of St Thomas's and Guy's. At the end of 1793 he became a member of the Company of Surgeons, and went with Forster to France in Lord Moira's expedition. After an unsuccessful three months there he returned to London, where he married in 1797. After two long visits to Barbados he returned to Britain in 1800, studied for two years from about 1804 in Edinburgh, and in 1806 took the degree of MD at Aberdeen, becoming a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, in the same year. At this time he lived in Charterhouse Square, London. He helped John Cunningham Saunders to found the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital in 1806, and served as physician there until his retirement in 1856. 
Farre founded and edited the 'Journal of Morbid Anatomy, Ophthalmic Medicine, and Pharmaceutical Analysis', which, although it appeared in only one issue, is regarded as the first ophthalmic periodical. He published works on pathological disorders of the larynx (1812), and the liver (1812-15), and on malformations of the heart (1814). He edited works by J. F. D. Jones on haemorrhage and by J. C. Saunders on diseases of the eye. His pathological specimens are preserved in the museum of St Bartholomew's Hospital. 
Among Farre's children were two sons who attained distinction in medicine, Frederic John Farre and Arthur Farre. He retired from practice in 1856 and died on 7 May 1862 at his home, 123 Pentonville Road, Clerkenwell, London, and was buried at Kensal Green.

Farren, Elizabeth (1759x62-1829), actress, was one of the five or six children of George Farran ('c'.1731-1770), actor, and his wife Margaret, 'nee' Wright ('c'.1732-1803). Her birth date has been given as 16 July 1759 (Bloxam, 18), but the memorial plaque in Huyton parish church, Liverpool, has 6 July 1762, and she could plausibly have been the Elisabeth Farran, daughter of George and Margaret Farran, baptized at Thornbury, Gloucestershire, on 7 July 1761. Her father was the son of a Dublin wine merchant, one of a well connected Huguenot family. George's cousin Charles held high office in the Dublin court of the exchequer, and Charles's son (also Charles) became a major-general in the British army. George, however, disappointed his father by leaving the family business, for reasons unknown, and apprenticing himself to a surgeon-apothecary in Cork. George subsequently sailed for England in pursuit of a theatrical career, probably in summer 1753. Details are sparse, but it was probably while acting in Liverpool that he met and married Margaret Wright, daughter of a once prosperous Liverpool brewer. Later events suggest that she was strong willed and, like her husband, socially adroit. 
Together they established a touring company of a little higher quality than some of its kind. Of their five or six children, the three who certainly survived infancy were daughters, and when George died in 1770 it was left to Margaret Farran to sustain and nurture them. She seems, somehow or other, to have ensured that neither their education nor their manners were neglected. Elizabeth's surviving letters are fluent and liberally sprinkled with not-quite-perfect French, and it was probably from her mother that she learned the craft of needlework. But it was in provincial theatres that mother and daughters strove to eke out a living in the years following George Farran's death. They were in Manchester, under the eccentric management of James Whitley, in 1773-4, when Elizabeth was primarily employed as a singer, but it was Joseph Younger, manager of the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, who provided her first real acting opportunities, as Rosetta in Isaac Bickerstaff's 'Love in a Village' and as an improbably youthful Lady Townly in 'The Provok'd Husband', by Colley Cibber and John Vanbrugh. Younger's greatest service, though, was to recommend Elizabeth to George Colman the elder, newly engaged in the management of the Little Theatre in the Haymarket. 
The Farran family arrived in London in May 1777, lodging close to the theatre in Suffolk Street, and Elizabeth Farren (the surname by which she was billed) made her London debut as Kate Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith's 'She Stoops to Conquer' on 9 June. Colman was sufficiently impressed to cast her as Rosina for the premiere of his own adaptation of Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais's 'Le barbier de Seville', 'The Spanish Barber', on 20 August. Tall, slim, blue-eyed, and fine-featured, she quickly gathered a male following, but, always under the watchful eye of her mother, did nothing to blemish her reputation. Serious about acting from the start, and keen to improve her vocal powers, she took singing lessons with Jonathan Battishill during the summer of 1777, earning herself a re-engagement at the Haymarket in the summer of 1778. Her popularity grew, despite a general view that her figure was ill-suited to the breeches part she played in Colman's 'The Suicide', and her Lady Townly in 'The Provok'd Husband' enabled Londoners first to glimpse her refined playing of high-society ladies in comedy. With the summer season over, the managers of the two patent theatres competed for her, and she appeared at both Covent Garden and Drury Lane during October 1778. It was Drury Lane, however, that eventually won her, and her subsequent career, until she retired from the stage, was almost exclusively confined to performances there and, during the summer seasons, at the Haymarket. Seen from the outset as Frances Abington's rival in accurately portraying ladies of taste, Elizabeth eventually displaced her on the stage and outshone her in society. 
The first helping hand in a social career that was both glittering and astonishingly discreet was offered by the 'queen of Ireland', Emily Fitzgerald, duchess of Leinster, who may well have known the Dublin Farrans. Charles James Fox was among Elizabeth's early suitors, but the second half of her life was bound up with that of Edward Smith Stanley, twelfth earl of Derby (1752-1834). The earl had been married to Lady Elizabeth Hamilton since 1774, and they had two children. A third child, though nurtured by Lord Derby after his wife absconded, was almost certainly fathered by the duke of Dorset, whose liaison with Lady Elizabeth had scandalized and entertained the age of gossip. By the time that the relationship between the cuckolded peer and the reputedly virginal actress became widely recognized, Lady Derby had returned home, ejected by her lover, but there was no pretence of reconciliation, although Lord Derby refused to divorce her. Instead, he and Elizabeth Farren waited for her to die. Famous as a patron of horse-racing (founder of the Oaks and transporter of the Derby to Epsom), the earl was also a keen amateur actor, and it was no doubt he who persuaded Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond, to invite Elizabeth to oversee the amateur theatricals at Richmond House in 1787 and 1788. 
The 1780s were Elizabeth's years of triumph on the London stage -- she had added to her repertoire, among scores of less familiar roles, Hermione in 'The Winter's Tale', Beatrice in 'Much Ado about Nothing', and above all, Lady Teazle in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 'The School for Scandal' -- but her engagement at Richmond House crowned all. These performances were not minor diversions, but social occasions of real significance, attended by George III and Queen Charlotte, by George, prince of Wales, and by the cream of London society. Always accompanied by her mother, and always discreetly behaved, Elizabeth presented herself as a worthy consort of the earl, whom she now observed on stage as he had customarily observed her. She and her mother would entertain Lord Derby in the house in Green Street, Mayfair, which they occupied from 1786 to 1797 -- it was not far from the earl's London residence in Grosvenor Square -- but there was no verifiable impropriety in their constancy. Horace Walpole, who kept a miniature of Elizabeth in Strawberry Hill, was one among many observers of the invariable presence of Mrs Farran, whom he called La Signora Madre: 'In the evening', he wrote to Mary Berry in 1793, 'we went together to Miss Farren's and besides her duenna-mother, found her at piquet with her unalterable Earl' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 12.17-18). 
Never robust, Elizabeth retained her popularity at Drury Lane into the 1790s, but undertook fewer new roles. The decade had begun sensationally, when Thomas Lawrence's exquisite full-length portrait of her was exhibited at the Royal Academy in May 1790 alongside his commissioned portrait of Queen Charlotte, and Elizabeth deflected the renewed public clamour for novelty by her willingness to engage directly with her audiences in prologues and epilogues specially written for her. Perhaps her enthusiasm for her profession was waning; certainly she wasted no time in announcing her retirement from the stage when, on 14 March 1797, the countess of Derby died. On 8 April she made her farewell appearance at Drury Lane -- as Lady Teazle to a house that was reportedly forty-five over capacity and that provided the management with record takings at the box office. On 1 May, in a ceremony at Derby House, she married Lord Derby. On 11 May she was presented to the queen, and a week later, at the queen's choice, she was in the wedding procession for the marriage of Princess Charlotte, the princess royal. Actress she may have been, but the earl's second wife was altogether more acceptable than his first. 
Already in her late thirties when she married, Elizabeth nevertheless bore her husband a child each March for the next four years. The first was a stillborn daughter, the second a daughter, Lucy Elizabeth (1799-1809), who died ten years later, the third a son, James (1800-1817), and the fourth a daughter, Mary Margaret (1801-1858), who married Thomas Egerton, second earl of Wilton, and produced five children of her own. The household over which Elizabeth presided also included Lord Derby's two adult children (the questionable third had been married off in 1795), the four illegitimate children of his uncle General John Burgoyne and the singer Susan Caulfield, and, until her death in 1803, Elizabeth's mother. Lord Derby took his role as lord lieutenant of Lancashire seriously, and his hospitality at Knowsley House, near Liverpool, was famous. Each year from June to November the house was full of guests. There is abundant evidence, particularly in Thomas Creevey's letters, of Elizabeth's qualities as a hostess. During her long last illness, 'an ossification or some other fatal affliction of the heart' (Bloxam, 206), Creevey wrote on 3 December 1828 that 'Knowsley without Lady Derby is like a house with all the fires and candles put out' (Creevey, 250). She died at Knowsley House on 23 April 1829 and was buried on 30 April, after a grand funeral procession, in the Stanley family vault at St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk, about 13 miles from Knowsley. After his death on 21 October 1834, Lord Derby was buried beside her. The brass plaque commemorating Elizabeth was originally in the nave of the parish church in Huyton, which the Derby family regularly attended when in residence at Knowsley. It was later moved to the chancel.

Farren, Henry (1827-1860), actor, was born in London on 10 July 1827, the younger son of the actors William Farren (1786-1861) and his companion (later wife), Harriet Elizabeth Savill, nee Diddear, known as Mrs Faucit (1789-1857) ['see under 'Saville, John Faucit]. William Farren (1825-1908) was his elder brother. Henry Farren made some provincial appearances in 1846 (at Birmingham and Manchester) and 1847 (at Nottingham, Liverpool, Norwich, and Brighton), mostly in comedy but with occasional roles such as Mercutio to support starring tragedians. On 16 August 1847 he married Ellen Smithson, the daughter of a solicitor's clerk. Eventually they had three daughters: Ellen (called Nellie), Harriet Letitia, and Florence; all became actresses, Nellie Farren being particularly successful and popular. 
On 2 October 1847 Henry Farren made his London debut at the Haymarket as Charles Surface to his father's Sir Peter Teazle in 'The School for Scandal'. Reviewers approved his easy, natural bearing but found his speech too harsh and measured for light comedy. In the spring of 1849 he briefly managed the New Strand Theatre but soon relinquished control to his father, under whose direction he acted such parts as Dazzle in Boucicault's 'London Assurance'. In September 1850 he moved to the Olympic with the elder Farren, who appointed him acting manager. He now essayed some heavier roles, not only in established dramas, but also in two new blank-verse tragedies (by that time rare theatrical ventures): he created the part of De Fontaine in Westland Marston's 'Philip of France and Marie de Meranie', with G. V. Brooke and Helen Faucit (Farren's half-sister) in the starring roles (November 1850), and the title character in 'The Warden of Galway' by a clergyman named Groves (May 1852). The first production was acclaimed, the second hissingly condemned -- the audience, according to 'The Times', was repelled by the subject matter and the unexpectedly grim ending. Farren, however, won praise from the 'Theatrical Journal' for the 'power and intelligence' with which he portrayed his unsympathetic part, an inflexibly just public official who sentenced his own son to death for murder. 
From July 1852 to March 1854 Farren managed the Theatre Royal, Brighton, where he undertook leading roles of all kinds, including Shakespeare's tragic heroes. His most popular offerings were extravaganzas featuring Louisa Howard, an actress so frequently paired with him that she was sometimes mistaken for his wife. The Brighton management was a financial failure. On 4 March 1854 Farren fled from the theatre, barely escaping arrest for debt, and went to London, leaving his wife in Brighton. After a brief acting engagement at Sadler's Wells he sailed for New York -- again without Mrs Farren. At the Broadway Theatre, he and Louisa Howard starred in the first few performances of the new season (21-6 August), beginning with Claude and Pauline in Bulwer-Lytton's 'The Lady of Lyons', but they caused little excitement. In December 1854 they acted briefly at the St Charles Theatre in New Orleans, then twice at Field's Theatre in Mobile. Later Farren was a member of Ben DeBar's company, which acted alternately at New Orleans and St Louis. On 23 November 1857, while in New Orleans, he bigamously married the popular young actress Catherine Mary (Kate) Reignolds (1836-1911), who believed erroneously that his first wife was dead. In 1858 he became manager of the St Louis Theatre, though he spent the summer seasons at Dubuque, Iowa. On 8 January 1860 he died of diabetes at St Louis, Missouri, and, after a funeral at the theatre, was buried in Belfontaine cemetery. He left his second wife (later Mrs Erving Winslow) with an infant, but nothing further is known about this child. His bigamy was little known in his lifetime. 
Farren was a competent, versatile actor but never an outstanding one; in his more ambitious roles he was judged acceptable rather than distinguished. Perhaps his best acting was in his father's line of 'old men'. The 'Brighton Herald', which praised his Sir Peter Teazle, suggested that he specialize in such parts, but he seemed unwilling to cultivate them at the expense of romantic and heroic ones. He was only thirty-two when he died, however. With more mature judgement, he might have limited his range and refined his apparent talent for character acting.

Farren, William (1786-1861), actor, was born in London on 13 May 1786, the second son of William Farren (1754-1795) and his common-law wife, Mary Orton, 'nee' Mansell (1748-1820), both of whom were actors. A wealthy benefactor, Percival Pott, enabled the family to enjoy a luxurious style of living. Young William had a substantial inheritance, including a good provision from his father and $6000 from Pott. He attended Dr Barrow's school in Soho Square, then possibly served an abortive apprenticeship with a Wolverhampton attorney. About 1806 he began acting under his brother Percy's management at Plymouth. Although he was only twenty, he chose the 'old man's' line of business, playing roles such as Lovegold in 'The Miser' and Sir Archy Macsarcasm in 'Love a la Mode'. Later he acted at various theatres on the Worcester and Shrewsbury circuits, and appeared as all the principal 'old men and Irishmen'. By 1812, if not earlier, he was at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, where, reportedly, he made a successful debut as Lovegold, followed by Sir Adam Contest in 'The Wedding Day'. Playbills list him in comic and character parts in every conceivable kind of production. Some time before 1816 he married a young Dublin woman, 'of good family', named Mary (surname unknown). 
In 1818 Farren left Dublin for an engagement at Covent Garden. His debut, on 10 September, as Sir Peter Teazle in 'The School for Scandal', was triumphant: the critic of 'The Times' (11 September) had seldom witnessed a more 'completely successful' first performance or one showing 'so valuable an acquisition' to the London stage. His next portrayal was Lord Ogleby in 'The Clandestine Marriage', which was equally applauded. These two eighteenth-century roles remained lifetime favourites. Farren continued to draw enthusiastic audiences in other characters, and by the end of the season he had established himself as one of the most admired actors in London. 
About 1821 Farren provided for his wife's separate maintenance and began living with the actress Mrs Faucit (legally Harriet Elizabeth Savill, nee Diddear) (1789-1857) ['see under 'Saville, John Faucit], also giving a home to her daughters Harriet and Helena ['see 'Faucit, Helen]. The couple had two sons of their own, William Farren and Henry Farren, both of whom became actors. The couple were finally to marry, on 16 November 1853, after both had been widowed. Farren remained at Covent Garden through the 1827-8 season, and from 1824 onwards acted during the summers at the Haymarket. He had numerous roles in favourite old comedies and in farces and 'petites comedies', old and new. In October 1828 he began a connection with Drury Lane that lasted for nine seasons (though during the same period he made occasional appearances at Covent Garden). Here, in addition to his usual line, he took some character parts, such as Kent in 'King Lear' and Polonius in 'Hamlet'. As a Witch in 'Macbeth' (1831) he gave not the usual ludicrous portrayal, but one filled with 'grotesque horror'. Two comic roles in this period, both of French derivation -- Hugo Bambino, an eccentric pedant in 'The Court Jester' (Haymarket, 1832) and Michael Perrin, a simple country cure in 'Secret Service' (Drury Lane, 1834) -- were a new, more pathetic type, in which he would excel: an unworldly person who tries, sometimes with ironic success, to do good without understanding the situation. 
In October 1837 Farren joined Madame Vestris's Olympic, and stayed until 1839, when she gave up this theatre; he then moved with her to Covent Garden for the three seasons of her management, ending in 1841-2. His most famous new role there was Sir Harcourt Courtly, a nineteenth-century Lord Ogleby in Boucicault's highly successful 'London Assurance' (March 1841). In 1842 the Haymarket, by then almost a year-round theatre, became Farren's constant home. His most notable characters at this time were the title roles in 'Grandfather Whitehead' and 'Old Parr', the former a benevolent old man almost in second childhood, the latter a miraculously hearty survivor at the age of 120 (act I) but little more than a vegetable at 148 (act II). Sentimental though these plays sound, Farren made the characters so convincingly lifelike that 'The Times' (10 October 1843) hailed his performances as a turning point in English acting. 
On 24 October 1843, when concluding a performance of Old Parr, Farren suffered a stroke, which partially paralysed him and left him temporarily speechless. By 22 April 1844, however, he had recovered sufficiently to return to the stage. His articulation was never so clear afterwards, but he continued to act for another decade. During the first four years he was mainly at the Haymarket, where he had another 'simple-hearted' character, a trouble-making country clergyman named Jesse Rural, in Boucicault's 'Old Heads and Young Hearts'; this comedy played for approximately eighty nights. By the autumn of 1848 Farren had left the Haymarket and was probably touring in the provinces, as he had often done in free periods. On 16 April 1849 he began acting at the New Strand Theatre, where his son Henry had become manager a week earlier; on 28 May he himself took over the management, which he retained until August 1850. 
On 2 September 1850 Farren became manager of the Olympic, taking his company, a group known for their ensemble acting, with him. He occasionally engaged visiting stars, but, more importantly, he introduced Frederick Robson, whose astonishing performances revealed the serious possibilities in Shakespearian burlesques. Farren left the Olympic with a farewell benefit on 22 September 1853, which featured his Lord Ogleby and Robson's Shylock. This was evidently his last full performance in London, but he made some farewell appearances in the provinces during the next year or so. On 16 July 1855 he took his final farewell of the stage in a huge benefit at the Haymarket, in which numerous actors joined to honour him; his own contribution was Lord Ogleby's second act. On 24 September 1861 he died at his home, 23 Brompton Square. 
Farren had a tall, elegant figure, grey eyes, and neat facial features except for rather full lips. Some personal traits, such as his occasional dogmatism and his relentless pursuit of money, interfered with his popularity among colleagues; least endearing was his extreme egotism, illustrated by his boast that he was 'the only cock-salmon in the market', and by his attempts to monopolize audience attention by appearing full face. More attractive were his good-natured response to practical jokes and his easy, courteous manner when not on his dogmatic high horse. Professionally he was highly respected. From his first London appearance to his last, when 'The Times' (17 July 1855) called him 'one of the most finished artists that ever appeared on the English stage', critics repeatedly described his performances as 'chaste', 'subtle', 'polished', 'exquisite'. Such terms, whatever their connotations for modern readers, were often paired with 'natural', implying avoidance of exaggeration. In acting old comedy Farren assumed the artificial urbanity of Georgian society but, by nuance and 'semitone', suggested suppressed or conflicting emotion. His dry, understated acting lacked Dowton's explosive power and Liston's 'rich, mellow' humour, but it was more natural than Dowton's and more true to character than Liston's. Pathos, which often mingled with ridicule in his portrayals, became uppermost in parts such as Grandfather Whitehead and Old Parr; this emphasis, combined with the plays' domestic atmosphere, enhanced the effect of everyday realism. It has been acutely observed that Farren was a transitional actor, using at first the old, artificial style for traditional roles, then developing a more realistic style for some later characters, yet retaining the original one for his old parts. Without apparently changing his basic principles, he adapted his techniques to the kind of play in which he was acting. Farren was a theatrical sophisticate, equally at home in period comedy and modern plays; he was, besides, one of the finest actors of his century.

Farrer, Thomas Henry, first Baron Farrer (1819-1899), civil servant, was the eldest of six children of Thomas Farrer (1787-1833), solicitor, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and his wife, Cecilia (died 1867), daughter of Richard Willis of Halsnead, Lancashire. He was born at 3 Bedford Place, Russell Square, London, on 24 June 1819. His family moved in 1824 to Hampstead, joining the evangelical circle centred upon the Vale of Health. Farrer's evangelical upbringing ('enough to make a boy hate Sunday for life') was reinforced in two of the three elementary schools he attended in Hampstead and Shinfield, but the most durable legacy of this education was unspiritual -- his mastery of Euclid, which he 'never entirely forgot... as I have forgotten everything learned in afterdays at Eton and Oxford' (T. C. Farrer, 12, 18). Eton's chief benefit proved to be the friendship of his two future brothers-in-law, Stafford Northcote and Arthur Hobhouse. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1836, graduating in 1840 with a second in 'literae humaniores'. Failure to gain a first still weighed on him forty years later; his sister Mary remembered it as a forbidden topic in family conversation. He followed his father into the law but read for the bar, becoming, with Hobhouse, one of Roundell Palmer's first pupils at Lincoln's Inn. Called to the bar in 1844 he gained few briefs and ceased to practise in 1848. In this period Farrer developed the convictions which would guide his life. His father's death encouraged Farrer's departure from what Mary described as 'the narrow Evangelical lines in which we had been brought up' (T. C. Farrer, 62), under various influences including Irvingism and the study of German literature. He also shed his family's toryism: the corn law controversy was his 'instruction in politics'. In 1847 he supported the Peelite Gladstone in the Oxford University election, his belief in free trade outweighing misgivings about Gladstone's views on church and state. During the 1850s he moved, with Gladstone, into Liberalism. 
In 1849 Farrer was engaged, on Northcote's recommendation, to assist the Board of Trade in amending the law affecting merchant shipping, following the repeal of the navigation laws. This work led to his appointment as secretary of the new marine department of the Board of Trade in August 1850. In 1853 he became an assistant secretary of the board, handling marine business, in 1865 a full joint secretary, and in 1867 the board's first sole permanent secretary. These were years of rapid departmental growth: a staff of forty-eight in 1850 had expanded to 362 by 1886. Privately Farrer described the board as 'a sort of wastepaper basket into which matters are thrown which are not wanted elsewhere' (notes written 'c'.1888, Farrer MSS). Its interests were indeed eclectic -- the regulation of railways, tramways, public utilities, weights and measures, patents, company law, and commercial treaties -- but expansion reflected Britain's economic growth rather than bureaucratic empire-building. Farrer shared with most of his political masters the view that government should do no more than seek to create the conditions for commerce to flourish -- preventing fraud, curbing monopoly, and protecting 'as much individual freedom as is consistent with the welfare of an organised society' (T. H. Farrer, 'The State in its Relation to Trade', 1883, 178). He exercised a considerable influence over the development of commercial law, and was made a baronet in October 1883 in recognition of his work on the 'Bankruptcy Bill' carried in that year. 
As the architect of the nineteenth-century Board of Trade Farrer was, with R. W. W. Lingen at the Treasury and Godfrey Lushington at the Home Office, one of the pillars of the mid-Victorian civil service. He considered the civil service 'a capital career for one who prefers power to fame' ('The Times', 13 Oct 1899), and although the work of a bureaucrat in a minimalist state inevitably left few monuments, his influence over policy was substantial. 'He does not know the real political history of our time', wrote Sir James MacDonnell on Farrer's death, 'who does not know the unseen and silent influence of Sir Thomas Farrer in the seventies and early in the eighties' (ibid.), referring to the years in which Britain resisted the European protectionist tide. Farrer himself none the less thought this a losing battle: 'When we of this generation are dead and gone', he wrote in the early 1880s, 'there will be the fight that was won by Peel and Cobden to fight over again' (T. H. Farrer to T. C. Farrer, 27 May 1881, Farrer MSS). He feared 'another dose of a Tory Ministry' and his retirement in May 1886 coincided with the end of the Liberals' years of dominance. 
Retirement unleashed a vigorous polemicist. After 1886 Farrer produced pamphlets and books attacking the quasi-protective sugar convention in 1889, criticizing the policies of G. J. Goschen as chancellor of the exchequer, denouncing imperial federation, and justifying the gold standard (he helped found the Gold Standard Defence Association in 1895). Above all he sought to defend free trade from its increasingly numerous critics. He considered it as much an ethical as a commercial principle, which 'reconciles self-interest with morality -- our duty to ourselves with our duty to our neighbour', bringing 'the nations a little nearer to the distant ideal of the Christian moralist' (T. H. Farrer, 'Free Trade versus Fair Trade', 1882, 138). Judged purely as an economic thinker he was unoriginal. His obituarist, MacDonnell, acknowledged 'perhaps a lack of subtlety... a premature pause in intellectual development' ('The Times', 13 Oct 1899), and Farrer himself saw the defence of the principles of liberal economics as a restatement of the self-evident: 'as if I had been asked to prove Euclid, or give a reason for the rules of Grammar' (T. H. Farrer, 'Free Trade versus Fair Trade', 1882, 1). His writings are largely rehearsals of the 'rules' of classical economics. 
A brief career in local politics followed retirement. Denied election to the Surrey county council in 1889, Farrer was chosen as an alderman by the Progressive (Liberal) majority on the London county council, becoming vice-chairman in 1890. Drawing upon his Board of Trade experience, he guided the council's attempts to control London's private water companies, but he disagreed strongly with the council's labour policy, which he considered unduly favourable to the trade unions. His 1892 memorandum entitled 'The London County Council's Labour Bill, Market Rate or Fancy Rate' was one of his most forceful and least effective writings. He played little part on the council after ceasing to be vice-chairman in 1892, although he remained an alderman until 1898. Farrer remained hostile to toryism, which he identified with protection and jingoism (on the outbreak of the South African War he donated $100 to the Manchester Peace Society), but became increasingly perturbed by the 'democratic' tone of modern Liberalism and the threat to economic liberty from 'the impatient action of philanthropy'. He would not have disputed the contemporary view of him in his last years as 'the only surviving unimpaired specimen of the Manchester School' ('The Times', 13 Oct 1899). In June 1893 he was created Baron Farrer of Abinger. 
Farrer married Frances, daughter of William Erskine of the Indian Civil Service, in 1854. She died in 1870, leaving three sons and one daughter. In 1873 he married Katherine Euphemia (died 1931), daughter of Hensleigh Wedgwood. Farrer died on 12 October 1899 at Abinger Hall, the house near Dorking designed for him by Alfred Waterhouse, and was cremated at Woking crematorium, his ashes being placed in the family grave at Brookwood cemetery on 15 October. The title passed to his son from his first marriage, Thomas Cecil Farrer (1859-1940) who was the father of Frances Farrer, general secretary of the National Federation of Women's Institutes.

Farrier, Robert (bap. 1795, d. 1879), painter, was baptized on 11 December 1795 at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, London, the eldest child of Robert Farrier ('bap'. 1763) and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Wymark (died 1847). His father was a successful tailor based in Chelsea, where the younger Robert lived throughout his life. He studied as an engraver, but progressed to miniature painting and then entered the Royal Academy Schools in January 1820, at the age of twenty-four. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818, sending some miniature portraits, and in 1819 he exhibited the first of a series of pictures of amusing domestic subjects, especially scenes from schoolboy life. These became popular, and a number of them were engraved for the annuals, for example 'The Schoolboy -- 'he Whistled Loud to Keep his Courage Up' (Blair's Grave)', (exh. Royal Academy, 1824); 'Sunday Morning -- the Toilet' (exh. Royal Academy, 1825); 'Sunday Evening' and 'The Declaration' were engraved by J. Romney. Other pictures by Farrier that were engraved include 'The Loiterer', by Mrs W. H. Simmons; 'Hesitation', by C. Rolls; 'Minnie O'Donnell's Toilet', by E. Portbury; 'The Mischievous Boy', by William Ward jun.; 'The Village Champion', by Thomas Fairland (lithograph); and 'The Culprit Detected', by William Fairland (lithograph). Other paintings by Farrier include: 'The Prophecy -- you'll Marry a Rich Young Lady'. He exhibited thirty-five pictures at the Royal Academy, fifty at the British Institution, and thirty-two at the Society of British Artists. He also showed work at the New Watercolour Society. 
On 26 August 1829 at St Luke's, Chelsea, Farrier married Elizabeth Meers (died 1832), with whom he had two daughters. He married, secondly, on 15 August 1847 at Wandsworth, Frances Elliott (1804/5-1894), the daughter of William Elliott, a music teacher of Wandsworth. In his professional life he occasionally travelled, but he continued to reside in Chelsea at 6 Wellesley Street and later at 7 Smith Street, 12 Old Manor Street (1851), and 2 Hemus Terrace (1861). Farrier died of apoplexy at Holly Villa, Hayes, Middlesex, on 19 April 1879, and was survived by his second wife and one of his daughters. After his death one of his pictures, 'The Parting', was presented to the South Kensington Museum. His sister, Charlotte Farrier, who was baptized on 18 August 1802 at St Luke's, Chelsea, was a miniature painter and exhibited frequently and prolifically, from the same addresses as her brother, at the Royal Academy. She died on 1 April 1879.

Farrington, Sir Anthony, first baronet (1742-1823), army officer, was born on 6 February 1742, the son of Charles Farrington (died 1782) and his wife, Anne, daughter of Anthony Crouche. His father had entered the Royal Artillery as a matross in 1733 and died at Woolwich, as lieutenant-colonel commandant of the Royal Invalid Artillery, on 23 February 1782. Farrington entered the Royal Academy, Woolwich, on 3 March 1754 and was commissioned lieutenant fireworker on 29 October 1755. He went to Gibraltar in 1758 as a first lieutenant, returned to England in 1763 a captain-lieutenant, and, by the time he left to serve in America in 1764, he was a captain. On 9 March 1766 at Trinity Church, New York, he married Elizabeth (died 1824), daughter of Alexander Colden of New York; they had two sons and three daughters. Although he left for England in 1768, he returned to America in 1773 and remained there until May 1783. He served at Boston from 1774 to 1776, first seeing action at Bunker Hill, and was present subsequently at Brooklyn, Long Island, White Plains, Brandywine, and Philadelphia. He was promoted major in 1782 and lieutenant-colonel the same year. 
Farrington commanded the artillery at Plymouth in 1788-9. In Gibraltar, where he commanded in 1790-91, Farrington battery is almost certainly named after him. Promoted colonel in 1791, he commanded Woolwich garrison from 3 April 1794 to 27 May 1797 and became colonel commandant of the 1st battalion on 25 April 1796. As a major-general he commanded the artillery of the duke of York's expedition to The Helder in September 1799. He lost all his baggage on his return when shipwrecked off Yarmouth. Appointed lieutenant-general and commandant of the field train department on 29 April 1802, he was made director-general of artillery on 30 June 1805 and on 8 July 1805 became president of the select committee of artillery officers, a forerunner of the ordnance select committee. He was appointed full general and director of the field train department of the Ordnance in 1812. 
In recognition of long and meritorious service Farrington was made a baronet on 3 October 1818 and on 14 June 1820 Oxford University conferred an honorary DCL. He died on 3 November 1823 at his home in Blackheath. His grandson, Charles Henry Farrington, succeeded to the baronetcy. His widow died, aged seventy-three, on 12 April 1824 at Wilton Cottage, Taunton, the home of her daughter, Mrs Cliffe. Farrington's promotions came rapidly and the rank and rewards that he received indicate an officer of great ability as soldier and administrator.

Farrington, Sir William (c.1348-1416/17), soldier, came from the cadet branch of a well-connected Lancashire gentry family. His long military career began in the household of Sir John Chandos, by whom he was knighted before the battle of Najera in 1367. Farrington remained in the principality of Aquitaine after the death of Chandos in 1369 and, as seneschal of Saintonge and captain of Soubise, played a prominent part in the unsuccessful attempts to defend English possessions there during the early 1370s. After his commands in Aquitaine were overrun he retired to England and was soon regularly employed as a trusted military contractor by the crown: between March and July 1375 he patrolled the channel with a company of eighty men; in August 1376 he was sent with reinforcements for the garrisons of Brest and St Malo; and in 1378 he commanded a company of fifty men going to strengthen the Anglo-Navarrese force holding Cherbourg. Farrington served throughout the earl of Buckingham's campaign in Brittany in 1380-81 and then played an active role in advancing the case for full-scale English intervention in Flanders. He was chosen as one of the four principal commanders of the army gathered by Henry Despenser, bishop of Norwich, in order to implement this policy and acted as marshal of Despenser's host. Following the failure of the expedition, however, Despenser and his captains had to answer for their conduct before parliament in October 1383. Farrington's admission that he had accepted money from the French for the surrender of Gravelines particularly incensed the Commons and he, alone of Despenser's captains, was found guilty of the more serious charge of treasonous misconduct and imprisoned to await the king's pleasure. 
This set-back proved no more than temporary, but it marks a point of transition in Farrington's career, from active campaigning to military administration. Released from prison by December 1385, Farrington was clearly back in royal favour by January 1387, when he was sent on a mission to the court of Joao I, king of Portugal. Further diplomatic employment followed: Farrington was a member of the embassy dispatched to Rome in 1390 in order to protest against the effect of papal provisions, and he was sent to France in July 1392 to witness the prorogation of the existing Anglo-French truce on the king's behalf. Such services recommended him to Richard II, and in August 1394 Farrington was retained for life by the king at a fee of $50 p.a. It was as a king's knight that he subsequently accompanied Richard on his Irish campaigns in 1394-5 and 1399. During these years Sir William's career developed in two further directions. He served on the staff of the Calais garrison, rising to be lieutenant of the captain of Calais by 1399, and he became increasingly involved in the adjudication of disputed cases under the law of arms, hearing appeals from the judgments of the court of chivalry and acting, on occasion, as lieutenant to the marshal of England. The accession of Henry IV, who confirmed Farrington's annuity as a king's knight, made little difference to the range of duties Sir William was required to perform. Early in 1400 he was employed in the ineffective diplomatic exchanges aimed at securing French recognition of the new dynasty; in October 1403 he was entrusted with the responsibility of conveying the wine fleet from Bristol to Bordeaux; and his growing expertise in the law of arms was recognized in August 1409 by a commission granting him the power to exercise all the jurisdiction of the constable of England while overseas. But Farrington's principal responsibility during Henry's reign lay once again in the defence of Aquitaine. As constable of Bordeaux, a post he held between October 1401 and November 1413, and captain of the castle of Fronsac, Sir William played an important role in the administration and defence of the duchy during years of considerable French pressure. 
Farrington's tenure of this post was not without controversy, for in November 1402 he was briefly imprisoned in his own castle of Bordeaux by the king's lieutenant in Aquitaine, Edward, duke of York. Such conflicts were a regular feature of his career: before his conviction for treasonable misconduct in 1383, Farrington's determined pursuit of the financial interest he enjoyed in the ransom of the count of Denia had already led to a spell of imprisonment in the Tower of London in 1377, while his tenure at Bordeaux was punctuated by several disputes over the revenues allegedly attached to the office of constable. If these incidents suggest a certain lack of scruple on Farrington's part, his long military experience, his versatility and evident effectiveness meant that he was never short of patrons and employers. In addition to his duties to the crown, Farrington was, at various times, in the service of Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, Thomas (I) Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, and John Holland, duke of Exeter. His most enduring connection was, however, with William Montagu, earl of Salisbury. Montagu granted Farrington an annuity of $40 in 1388 and later demised to him a life interest in the manor and advowson of Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire. Farrington was named as both an executor and surveyor of the earl's will. 
In his own will, drawn up at Swavesey, Cambridgeshire, in April 1416, Farrington requested burial in the London Charterhouse and named Roger Westwode, second baron of the exchequer, as his principal executor; the will was proved in February 1417. Nothing is known of Farrington's wife except her name, Joan; they were married by July 1407 and appear to have had no surviving children.

Farrow, Joseph (1652/3-1692), clergyman, was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, the son of Thomas Farrow (died in or before 1669) and his wife, whose name is unknown. He was of 'religious parents' according to Calamy, and was educated at Boston School. His father had died when he was admitted as a sizar to Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 25 May 1669, aged sixteen; he graduated BA in 1673 and proceeded MA in 1677. On leaving university he became a private tutor at Louth, Lincolnshire, for several years, refusing the mastership of the free school at Brigg in the same county. Farrow was ordained, but was unwilling to conform to the Church of England and could not therefore take up a public ministry. In Lincolnshire he became a chaplain, first to Lady Elizabeth Hussey of Caythorpe (1630-1698), and then either to Sir Richard Earle of Stragglethorpe (died 1667) or to his son, Sir Richard (died 1684), before returning to Boston as curate to Dr Obadiah Howe. When Howe died in February 1683 Farrow acted as vicar in the parish until the arrival of a replacement later in the year. For the rest of his life he was employed at Nocton, Lincolnshire, as a chaplain to the family of Sir William Ellys ('c'.1654-1727), MP for Grantham between 1679 and 1710, a notable exclusionist and whig. Farrow is reported to have been 'so pleased with that religious and regular family wherein God had placed him that... if he had lived never so long he would not have left it by his good will' ('Nonconformist's Memorial', 2.444). Among his friends Farrow numbered the bishop of Gloucester Edward Fowler (1632-1714), John Locke (1632-1704), and Thomas Burnet ('c'.1635-1715), master of Charterhouse School, and he corresponded with John Spademan in the Netherlands. He is reported to have had 'a political head, and would give surprizing conjectures about public affairs, by which he foretold the several steps of the glorious Revolution', and his sermons were 'thought not much inferior to those of the most celebrated preachers of the age' (ibid.). Farrow died, unmarried, at Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, on 22 July 1692, and was buried in the chancel of the church there.

Fastolf, Sir John (1380-1459), soldier and landowner, was born into a minor gentry family in Norfolk and in early manhood served under the duke of Clarence in Ireland. His marriage there, on 13 January 1409, to Millicent, daughter of Robert, Lord Tiptoft (died 1372), and widow of Sir Stephen Scrope, decisively improved his fortunes, bringing him lands to the value of $240 p.a. He served under Clarence in Aquitaine in 1412-13 as deputy constable of Bordeaux and remained there as captain of Soubise and Veyres in 1413-14. On his return Fastolf joined Henry V's expedition in 1415 and fought at Agincourt, but returned to Harfleur early in 1416 as a knight under the duke of Exeter, and participated in the battle of Valmont and the close siege of the town by the French. It was with Clarence and Exeter that he served from 1417 to 1421: present at the sieges of Caen and Rouen, he held the captaincies of Harfleur and Fecamp, and was granted in tail male four lordships in the 'bailliage' of Caux in January 1419. 
During Henry V's absence in England, the duke of Exeter, as governor of Paris, made Fastolf captain of the Bastille de St Antoine which he defended during the disturbances after the battle of Bauge in 1421. Following Henry V's death and Exeter's return to England he, with other professional captains, formed a group under the command of the regent, John, duke of Bedford, which carried forward the momentum of the conquest. Appointed lieutenant in Normandy for a year in 1422, Fastolf was employed in clearing the region to the south-west of Paris, and held captaincies at Fresnay-le-Vicomte and Alencon. He distinguished himself in Bedford's victory over the Dauphinist-Scottish force at Verneuil in August and was made a knight-banneret in 1424 and knight of the Garter in 1426. From the ransoms of his prisoners at this battle, who included the duke of Alencon, he claimed to have gained 20,000 marks, although he in fact realized only part of this sum. He and Lord Scales then pressed ahead with the reduction of Maine and capture of Le Mans, of which he was made governor until the autumn of 1427. His own fiefs in the area included the castle of Sille-le-Guillaume from which he took the title of baron. Bedford's confidence in Fastolf, both as a military commander and as chief steward of his household and member of the 'grand conseil' from 1422 to 1435, was reciprocated by Fastolf's respect for the duke's policy and judgement. If he shared Bedford's mistrust of the siege of Orleans he in no way held aloof from it. In February 1429, while bringing supplies for the siege from Paris, he won the 'battle of the herrings', at Rouvray, by using barrels of the fish as a stockade. Four months later, however, retreating with Lord Talbot and Lord Scales from Beaugency, the rearguard was overwhelmed at Patay and only the van, under Fastolf, evaded death or capture by a rapid withdrawal. Talbot, made prisoner, later charged Fastolf with cowardice and demanded his removal from the Order of the Garter. The case against him was still being heard in the 1440s and, although he was vindicated, Fastolf's reputation was tainted; his enemies' taunt of being 'chevalier fuytif' ('a cowardly knight'), though undeserved, was particularly wounding to one who sought chivalric renown. Bedford's trust in him seems not to have wavered. Fastolf continued to be given captaincies: of Honfleur (1424-34), Verneuil (1429), and Caen (1430-37), and field commands with Lord Willoughby in 1431. 
As governor of Bedford's household Fastolf accompanied him to England in 1433-4, but the year 1435 brought traumatic losses. Bedford's death in September was quickly followed by the rising in the Pays de Caux where some of Fastolf's prime estates lay; their yield of over $600 p.a. was reduced by one-third. As well as a soldier he had become a landowner of substance in France. He employed an attorney in the 'parlement' -- Maitre Jean de Paris -- to pursue his claims over land, ransoms, and jurisdictions. His receiver, Thomas Overton, accused him of oppressing the people of Alencon. But this second crisis in English fortunes, with Normandy itself exposed to attack, prompted him to start disengaging. Although he responded by urging an aggressive strategy -- the creation of a scorched earth zone along the borders of Normandy by 'sharpe and cruelle war' (Stevenson, 580) -- and deplored the policy of piecemeal defence, his own days of soldiering were finished. As one of Bedford's three executors for his French estate Fastolf was mainly engaged during the next four years in disposing of the duke's effects, constructing his tomb, and fulfilling his bequests. His obligations to the duke's creditors continued for the rest of his life, as did his own obsession with recovering the sums owed to himself for ransoms and wages. 
For ten years after 1426 Fastolf had periodically remitted to England large sums from his profits of war for the purchase of land, mainly in Norfolk. When he returned in 1439 he acquired the Boar's Head tavern in Southwark where he also built himself a residence. At Caister, Norfolk, his fine moated castle was completed and furnished by 1448. In all he had spent $13,885 in purchasing property and another $9495 on improving it. In 1445 the annual value of his English lands was $1061, that of his French lands $401. His houses were furnished to baronial standards, his liquid wealth enabled him to lend and invest on a commercial scale, and among his jewels was a collar of the White Rose valued at 4000 marks that had belonged to the duke of York. Fastolf returned to England in 1439 rich, honoured, well connected, and in full mental and physical vigour, but instead of the respect, recognition, and ease that he anticipated he experienced twenty years of hostility and persecution that almost brought his ruin. His fortunes were caught up in the contentions of domestic politics not because he was actively involved in them, but because his background linked him to the opponents of the government and his lack of an heir attracted the covetous and unscrupulous. 
Fastolf's long years of war had inculcated distrust and contempt of the French which made him a natural critic of the peace policy of William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk. He was later to denounce the 'dissimuled' truce of Tours ('Boke of Noblesse', 41) and in 1448 urged Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset, to restock the castles of Normandy, safeguard the sea lanes, choose reliable captains, and win the loyalty of the Normans. He had already seen his fiefs in Maine surrendered without obtaining compensation, and by 1450 when all but Caen and Harfleur had gone he was still vainly urging the dispatch of a powerful army to hold them. The anger and shame Fastolf felt at the English collapse still burnt fiercely in 1451-2 when his secretary William Worcester put his master's views on record in the 'Boke of Noblesse', namely that Normandy had been lost through French trickery and the English corruption and indiscipline that followed Bedford's death. Believing that God and justice upheld the English, he affirmed that Normandy could and would be recovered. 
Not merely Fastolf's views but his associations were suspected by the duke of Suffolk and the court. He had been the counsellor of both Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and Richard, duke of York, and the critic of Somerset. He was the neighbour and friend of John Paston, an opponent of the court affinity in Norfolk now led by the duke of Suffolk. From 1447 Suffolk and members of the court raided and seized Fastolf's lands, harassed his tenants, and bent the law to dispossess him. With the fall of Suffolk in 1450 Fastolf, in association with John Paston and Justice Yelverton, sought the backing of the dukes of York and Norfolk to obtain redress, a hope which faded as Somerset established his power in 1451 and Fastolf found himself delated for treason and narrowly escaped forfeiture. Throughout the 1450s, with his fortune vulnerable to national politics, his plans for a college of priests at Caister impeded, his claims for wages and ransoms still unsettled, he was increasingly distrustful of those who had eyes on his wealth and became the 'close fisted, litigous, and irascible old man' revealed in the Paston letters from this decade (McFarlane, 176). Yet he never resorted to force in his defence, he prided himself on keeping faith with his superiors and subordinates, and claimed to stand for the defence of property and the common good in his neighbourhood. Not until the very last, after redrafting his will many times, did he, by a nuncupative act which John Paston could alone attest, bestow all his properties on Paston for the foundation of his college. Fastolf died on 5 November 1459 just as the civil war began in earnest, and not until 1470, after years of bitter wrangling and the loss of many of his lands, was the residue awarded to Magdalen College, Oxford, in place of the college at Caister. He was buried in the chapel at the abbey of St Benet of Hulme which he had built, but of that nothing survives. As well as a fine soldier and military theorist, and a shrewd and grasping man of business, he was a literary patron whose two amanuenses, William Worcester and Stephen Scrope, produced at his instigation the one a biography of his master, now lost, the other translations in English of 'De senectute' and Christine de Pisan's 'Epitre d'Othea'. 
Although Shakespeare adapted Fastolf's name for his character Sir John Falstaff, the personality he gave him was wholly imaginary. In the original draft of 'Henry IV' (1597) the companion of Prince Hal was the historically correct Sir John Oldcastle (d. 1417), who had also figured in the 'Famous Victories of Henry V' (1594). Apparently to meet the objection of Oldcastle's descendant, Lord Cobham, Shakespeare changed the name to Falstaff, doubtless suggested by the fact that Fastolf had owned the Boar's Head tavern in Southwark. Shakespeare introduced the character of Oldcastle-Falstaff to emphasize Henry V's conversion on his accession from a life of riot and dissipation. The corpulent, cowardly, and mendacious Falstaff was the opposite of the austere and dedicated king who historically had repudiated his former companion Oldcastle on account of his Lollard beliefs. Fastolf himself was neither self-indulgent nor heterodox and was never among Henry's close friends. Falstaff's rumbustious and endearing character quickly took on a life of its own, becoming not merely the inspiration for 'The Merry Wives of Windsor' but the subject of numerous musical adaptations, culminating in Verdi's 'Falstaff' (1893) and Vaughan Williams's 'Sir John in Love' (1935), and in the film 'Chimes at Midnight' (1966), in which the director, Orson Welles, himself played Falstaff.

Faucit, Helen (1814-1898), actress, was born on 11 October 1814 in London or Greenwich, the fifth of the six children of John Faucit Saville (Savill) (1783?-1853) and his wife, Harriet Elizabeth Savill, nee Diddear (1789-1857) ['see under 'Saville, John Faucit], both of whom were actors. Her baptismal name, Helena, later used for literary and social purposes, was shortened to Helen for home and professional use. Savill was given as the surname at her parents' marriage and her own baptism, but she used Faucit publicly; after 1821 her mother, by then living with William Farren (1786-1861), retained the name Faucit professionally, and the two daughters, who stayed with her, were also called Faucit; her father (and eventually the sons) used the surname Savill(e). Helen had two half-brothers, William Farren (1825-1908) and Henry Farren (1827-1860). 
Like her elder sister, Harriet (Miss Faucit), with whom she is sometimes confused, Helen attended a boarding-school in Greenwich and studied for the stage under her stepfather's brother, the sympathetic but exacting Percy Farren. She suffered periodically from an illness affecting her chest and was sent to Brighton to recuperate. Her seaside reading and daydreaming later influenced her stage interpretations: an admirer of Milton's Satan, she saw a heroic spirit in Juliet and Desdemona as well. She spent her summers at Richmond, Surrey, where she once met Edmund Kean. 
On 30 September 1833, at the small theatre in Richmond, Helen Faucit made her first stage appearance. Billed simply as 'A Young Lady', she portrayed Juliet very successfully; later she repeated this character and acted several others. But, although 'The Athenaeum' praised her for naturalness and spontaneity (9 November), she did not satisfy Percy Farren. After two years of further study, punctuated by another trial at Richmond and a more ambitious one at Brighton, she was considered ready for London. The time was propitious, for the gap left by Fanny Kemble's departure had never been adequately filled. On 5 January 1836 she made her debut at Covent Garden as Julia in Sheridan Knowles's 'The Hunchback', arousing such enthusiasm that she was given a three-year contract as leading lady. Reviewers pronounced her debut one of the most successful within memory. They were disappointed, however, by her portrayals of traditional favourites such as Belvidera in Otway's 'Venice Preserv'd' (in which she was later very successful), and some early devotees turned against her. Although she was always popular with audiences, she had, for a while, an erratic relationship with critics. Her first new part, Margaret in Joanna Baillie's esteemed though untheatrical drama 'The Separation' (25 February), enhanced her reputation. 
When W. C. Macready joined Covent Garden in May 1836 (after he had assaulted Alfred Bunn at Drury Lane), Faucit had the first of many opportunities to play opposite him. Although she admired his acting, she initially resented his arrogance; soon, however, she became his adoring disciple. During the next season, 1836-7, when she acted with both Charles Kemble and Macready, she portrayed nine Shakespearian heroines, mostly new to her. While she was generally cast in tragic or romantic roles, she revealed in Beatrice, acted for Kemble's farewell, an unexpected comic vivacity. Other notable parts were the heroine in Bulwer-Lytton's 'The Duchess de la Valliere' and the Countess of Carlisle in Browning's 'Strafford', first dramatic efforts by both writers. In the next two seasons Macready was manager as well as chief actor at Covent Garden. Faucit's infatuation with this happily married man, twice her age, had become very ardent; though fond of her, he kept their relationship platonic and directed her energy into improving her art. His approach to acting was more psychological than the ideal one of Kemble, her fatherly adviser. Her most popular part at Covent Garden -- indeed throughout her career -- was Pauline in Bulwer-Lytton's new play 'The Lady of Lyons' (15 February 1838); in it she ran the gamut of emotions and made her audiences do the same. Another success was her portrayal of Hero, a comic 'tour de force', in Knowles's 'Woman's Wit'. When Macready ended his management (summer 1839) and took an engagement at the Haymarket, Faucit, among others, followed him there. On 30 December, suffering from an attack of her recurrent illness, she withdrew, on doctors' orders, and took a prolonged rest at the seaside. Several actresses, jealous of Macready's attention to her, spread the rumour that she was pregnant; only her lawyer's threat of prosecution and her physicians' published diagnoses stopped the gossip. In later years this short-lived scandal was properly forgotten. 
Faucit returned to the Haymarket on 25 April 1840 and, after completing that season, remained for most of the next two. In addition to earlier popular parts she took roles in several new plays, notably Clara Douglas in Bulwer-Lytton's popular comedy 'Money' and the heroine of Zouch Troughton's neo-Elizabethan tragedy 'Nina Sforza'. Early in 1842 she joined Drury Lane, newly under Macready's management, and made her first appearance on 14 February. Her most important roles there were in the following season, 1842-3. Particularly challenging was Lady Macbeth, which she attempted only once, during the absence of the 'heavy' actress Mrs Warner; she had played this dreaded part 'remarkably' well at Dublin that summer, Macready thought, but in London she became distraught and disappointed his expectations. Actually she was unsuited, either in physique or in conception of character, to reproduce Mrs Siddons's powerful Lady Macbeth, which was Macready's ideal. As Constance in 'King John', too, she was hampered by Mrs Siddons's influence: she failed when attempting her predecessor's grand passion, but gradually achieved an effective pattern of lofty moments contrasted with tender ones. Rosalind in 'As You Like It', which she had previously acted, was disappointingly assigned to Mrs Nisbett, who played it in Dorothy Jordan's 'saucy lackey' tradition; Faucit's interpretation, suggesting emotional depth beneath the raillery, was seen on several nights, however. Rosalind was soon to become her most popular Shakespearian character. Interesting new roles were Mildred Tresham in Browning's 'Blot in the 'Scutcheon', potentially the most dramatic of his plays but insufficiently developed, and Lady Mabel in Westland Marston's 'The Patrician's Daughter', an attempt at blank-verse tragedy on a contemporary subject. 
When Macready gave up management and went to America, Faucit began travelling in the provinces. She had proved her right to eminence in London (Macready considered her 'beyond all compare the best English actress'; Macready, letter to T. J. Searle, Folger Shakespeare Library), but stardom on her own was another matter. Her great breakthrough came on 14 November 1843 at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. She opened triumphantly as Pauline, attracted crowded audiences from then on, and inspired lavish encomiums in the press. Her Lady Macbeth, now interpreted as a passionately loving wife who violated her own nature to help gratify her husband's ambition, proved particularly fascinating; her combination of wickedness, charm, and pathos, however, though convincing then for influential critics, was always controversial. In an elite Edinburgh circle she met Theodore Martin (1816-1909), a lawyer and writer, who fell in love with her and pursued her for the next eight years. Her next engagement, at Glasgow, was equally successful, perhaps more so: even the resentful Walter Baynham said she was, from first to last, 'Glasgow's favourite actress' ('The Glasgow Stage'). In Scotland, where clergymen often denounced the theatre, reviewers praised Faucit for her inspirational performances. In the summer of 1844 she caused a furore of enthusiasm in Ireland (Cork and Limerick). In December 1844 and January 1845 she was in Paris as leading lady in a series of performances by an English company at the Salle Ventadour, with Macready in the starring roles. Although Desdemona, Ophelia, and Virginia (in Knowles's 'Virginius') were not starring parts, many French critics were ecstatic about her performances, and when she played Lady Macbeth she received so much applause that Macready was offended. An abridged version of 'Romeo and Juliet' gave her a chance to act, with great success, one of her favourite characters. The engagement boosted Faucit's career but caused a rift in her friendship with Macready; they never acted together again. 
An outstanding success in Dublin followed, Faucit's greatest triumph being as Antigone in an English version of Sophocles' tragedy (22 February 1845). This called for somewhat stylized acting and, in one passage, recitative with an orchestral background. Seeing Antigone as both heroic and vulnerable, she combined formal techniques with natural ones: for example, sculpturesque poses held only momentarily, and passionate vocal tones and facial expressions in the 'aria'. Audiences found her portrayal exalting and deeply moving. Dublin's most eminent classical scholars presented her with a laudatory address and a gold fibula set with emeralds. Frederick Burton painted her portrait as 'The Greek Muse'. Her success was so great that the Dublin manager produced a version of Euripides' 'Iphigenia in Aulis' for her in 1846. Her starring career continued to flourish. Manchester had become a major centre of popularity, and numerous other towns welcomed her periodically. Occasionally she returned to the Haymarket in London; in 1847 she introduced Marston's 'The Heart and the World' there, but it failed for want of action. At her brother J. F. Saville's theatre in Sheffield (January 1850) she first acted Iolanthe, the blind but naively happy princess in 'King Rene's Daughter', Theodore Martin's adaptation of a Danish 'dramatic poem' by Henrik Hertz. This was repeated, to great applause, in Glasgow, and it became one of her most loved impersonations. A much acclaimed new creation was her Marie in Marston's 'Philip of France and Marie de Meranie', produced by William Farren at the Olympic on 4 November 1850, with G. V. Brooke as Philip. During another Olympic engagement, in 1851, she won favourable notices with Lady Macbeth, her first in London since the unsatisfactory attempt eight years previously. 
On 25 August 1851 Faucit finally married Theodore Martin at St Nicholas's Church, Brighton. The marriage was happy, and childless. Martin had previously moved to London and now had a lucrative business as a parliamentary agent; he continued his literary work as well. The Martins bought a fine house, 31 Onslow Square, where they entertained a wide circle of prominent friends. Mrs Martin, though occupied largely with domestic and social duties, occasionally accepted theatrical engagements (as Miss Helen Faucit) in London and the provinces. Her continued enthusiasm for her profession promoted respect for it among the privileged classes. She looked in vain for dependable new parts: her acting was praised at Manchester in 'Adrienne Lecouvreur' (Martin's translation, 1852) and at the Haymarket in Browning's 'Colombe's Birthday' (1853) and John Saunders's 'Love's Martyrdom' (1855), but the plays drew mixed responses. Although she was a versatile actress, she limited her repertory by her preference for heroines of the now declining poetic drama. In 1858 she played Lady Macbeth to Samuel Phelps's Macbeth during the festival productions celebrating the princess royal's wedding; the occasion, though unsatisfactory, led to a successful engagement at Charles Dillon's Lyceum, where she acted Lady Macbeth, Pauline, and Beatrice. Among the most important engagements of her career were three at Drury Lane, the first with Phelps as male lead and the others with Walter Montgomery: in October-December 1864 (Imogen and Lady Macbeth); in March-April 1865 (Imogen, Rosalind, and Juliet); and in November-December 1866 (Rosalind, Pauline, and Julia in 'The Hunchback'). Despite initial problems readjusting to the huge theatre, she drew large, enthusiastic audiences and high praise from most critics (often at the expense of other actors). It is remarkable that an actress in her fifties, still impersonating the heroines of her youth -- and in a style associated with the past -- could have aroused so much admiration. Only rarely was an incongruity admitted: that she no longer looked like Juliet, or that Pauline could have been Claude's mother. As she continued to act such parts, however, in provincial engagements, the hints multiplied. Having decided to retire, Faucit gave a few farewell performances in 1869 and 1870 (Edinburgh, Glasgow twice, and Liverpool), then made her final farewell at Manchester (13-25 November 1871), acting Lady Macbeth, Rosalind, Juliet, Pauline, Beatrice, and (on two last nights) Iolanthe and Portia's act IV. She later participated in a number of benefits, usually in London. Her two final performances were in 1879: Beatrice to Barry Sullivan's Benedick on 23 April, the inaugural night of the new Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon; and Rosalind on 2 October at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in a benefit for Mrs Charles Calvert. 
In 1880 Theodore Martin was rewarded with a knighthood for his weighty biography of Prince Albert. The Martins, who had already been guests of the queen, continued to be favoured by the royal family and to have many friends among the aristocracy. In 1880, too, Lady Martin, at the urging of Geraldine Jewsbury, wrote the latter a 'letter' (an essay) on the character of Ophelia; letters to various friends, on Portia, Desdemona, Juliet, Imogen, Rosalind, and Beatrice, followed. After separate publication in 'Blackwood's Magazine', these were collected in a book, 'On some of Shakespeare's Female Characters' (1885); a further essay, on Hermione, was included in the 1891 edition. Despite their gushing style, these essays give valuable insights into the actress's interpretations. In the 1860s the Martins had bought and rebuilt a hillside house, Bryntysilio, near the River Dee in north Wales. In later years they spent increasingly long periods in this home, where they often entertained friends. Browning and his sister visited them daily while staying at nearby Llangollen (1886), and Queen Victoria took tea there one afternoon (1889). Lady Martin's final years were marred by periodic bouts of neuralgia. She died at Bryntysilio on 31 October 1898. Her body was taken to London, where, after an impressive funeral service at St Peter's, Cranley Gardens, she was buried in Brompton cemetery. 
Helen Faucit made the most of her natural endowments: dark hair and blue-grey eyes, attractively contrasted; features lacking classic regularity but 'possess[ing] the whole beauty arising from powerful and changing expression'; an unfashionably slender figure developing to statuesque proportions; a musical voice, strengthened by practice, whose 'deep intonations and flexible richness' stirred the emotions (Alison, 'Essays', 3.585). De Quincey compared her to Helen of Troy, and other enraptured admirers were equally extravagant. Such was the force of illusion at the height of her career. As a mature actress, she was termed 'psychological', 'intellectual', 'poetically natural'. Her subtle, evocative style was a hard-won accomplishment, however. While she had originally been inclined towards uninhibited, often stormy acting, which her delicate constitution could not effectively support, she learned to reserve her power for the passionate climaxes; building towards and receding from them gradually, she gave even terrible scenes a shapely beauty. Her greatest talent was in suggesting suppressed emotion and unspoken thought by facial expression, gesture, and vocal tone; thus she gave humanity to potentially melodramatic characters and complexity to tradition-bound ones. Some critics, preferring a simpler style, accused her of self-conscious mannerism. In later years, indeed, her pictorial effects became noticeably artificial, her elucidations of 'inner meaning' overly meticulous. At its peak, however, her acting created a sense of reality, with, at special moments, a suggestion of transcendence through poetry or art. Scholars and artists felt her attractions keenly; some acknowledged her influence on their ideas. Three decades after her professional farewell Joseph Knight called her, correctly, 'the greatest interpreter of the poetic drama that living memory can recall' ('DNB'). Her acting, though not 'great' in the Siddons tradition (exciting by apparently superhuman power and grandeur), has probably been unexcelled in its artistic, interpretive, and emotional effectiveness.

Neville, Thomas (d. 1471), naval commander and rebel, was one of at least two illegitimate sons of the Yorkist commander William Neville, Lord Fauconberg (d. 1463) in right of his mad wife and, from 1461, earl of Kent. Lord Fauconberg was next brother to Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, uncle to Salisbury's son Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, and was one of their closest allies on the northern borders, at Calais, and at sea. On his death in 1463 his bastards may have transferred to Warwick's service and served him at sea, for Warwick, like Salisbury and Kent before him, was keeper of the seas, had his own ships, and was besides captain of Calais and warden of the Cinque Ports. Such possibilities are speculation, for Thomas Neville's life is almost wholly undocumented: the identity of his mother, his date of birth, whether he married, and his residence are all unknown. 
Neville was already adult on 4 March 1470, when he was paid $50 for maritime service against the Hanse, but he deserted, joining the fleeing Warwick off Calais in late April, and preyed on Burgundian ships, some of which were restored at Louis XI's insistence. In October 1470 he invaded England and entered London with Warwick and then deputized for him as admiral with the grandiose title of 'captain of the navy of England and men of war both by sea and land'. He engaged in piracy against the Portuguese, perhaps as far west as Brittany, and failed to thwart Edward IV's invasion from Burgundy. In late April 1471, following Warwick's defeat at Barnet, he landed in Kent, raising an army from the Calais veterans and the leaders and commons of the chief Kentish towns, and asked leave to pass through London. The city refused permission and informed him of Edward IV's victory at Tewkesbury, which did not deter him. His objective is obscure, but may have been to liberate Henry VI with a view to further resistance. With several thousand men, a core of hardened veterans, a train of ordnance, and a fleet that enabled him to cross the Thames at will, he launched a series of attacks on London from the south and east from 10 to 14 May, destroying the gate on London Bridge and briefly taking Aldgate, but was repulsed with heavy loss of life by Londoners stiffened with the noblemen whom Edward had left behind. His ships withdrew on 14 May, Neville himself and the Calais contingent on 18 May, and the rest of his men were abandoned. As he was still potentially troublesome, Neville negotiated a pardon (10 June) in return for surrendering forty-seven ships at Sandwich to the duke of Gloucester as lord admiral on 27 May. On 16 June he had a protection to accompany Gloucester northwards, where the duke had succeeded to Warwick's lands and offices and needed to win over his retainers. By 11 September he had been arrested at Southampton. He was dispatched to Gloucester in the north and executed; his head was placed on London Bridge facing Kent, and his brother, who was wounded, took sanctuary at Beverley. It is uncertain why Neville died, allegedly for a new offence, perhaps for collaboration with die-hard opponents of Edward IV. The details are not recorded, for he was not tried by common law, but presumably by the law of arms by Gloucester in his capacity as constable of England.

Fauconberg, Eustace de (c.1170-1228), administrator and bishop of London, derived his surname from Fauquembergues in Flanders. He was a younger son of Peter de Fauconberg, lord of Rise in Holderness, and probably of his wife, Beatrice. He must have had a university education since he is often entitled 'master', though also 'don', a style favoured by graduates of Bologna. 
Eustace de Fauconberg first appears as a familiar of Godfrey de Lucy, bishop of Winchester, some time before 1192 and he succeeded him as a royal justice in 1199. He served on the bench steadily until October 1209, both at Westminster and on eyres. Altogether he sat in nearly half the counties of England, and was also often responsible for tallaging the king's demesnes. He was also entrusted with diplomatic missions to France and to Flanders in 1204. But on the pope's excommunication of King John, Fauconberg left royal service for nearly five years. By then he was a prebendary in St Martin's-le-Grand, London as well as rector of other churches. In 1214, after John's reconciliation with the church, Fauconberg reappears, not as a justice, but as the right-hand man of the new justiciar, Peter des Roches, whom John left to govern England in his absence on the continent. Between June and October of that year, when des Roches was away from Westminster, Eustace attested the justiciar's writs by which the realm was ruled. On John's return to England this arrangement terminated, and Fauconberg again disappears from the scene of political activity during the baronial rebellion and French invasion. 
After peace had been made Fauconberg re-emerged, this time taking the important post of treasurer of the exchequer. He first occurs with the title on 4 November 1217, and he was to continue in the office until the end of his life. Assiduous in his attendance to his duties, he gradually brought order out of the chaos caused by the war. His reward was the bishopric of London, to which he was elected, though only after much acrimony, on 25 or 26 February 1221, the royal assent being given on 23 March. The papal legate confirmed the election, and the consecration took place at Westminster on 25 April at the hands of the bishop of Rochester, though again only after a great dispute over the officiand. Thenceforth Fauconberg was one of the magnates of the realm and took an active role in the councils of the government. He succeeded his predecessor in the custody of Colchester Castle, which he held until 1227. He participated in two diplomatic missions to France in 1223 and 1225, although Louis VIII was none too co-operative. After the siege of Bedford in 1224 Fauconberg was made responsible for the custody of Foulques de Breaute until he abjured the kingdom. He attested the fresh granting of 'Magna Carta' and the charter of the forest in 1225, and after the young king Henry III declared his majority in 1227, he frequently witnessed royal charters, though rarely away from Westminster and his duties at the exchequer. He was at work there only three days before his death. 
Fauconberg was no mere 'curialis', however; he took seriously his responsibilities as a churchman. A unique glimpse of him ordaining clerks at Chelmsford in 1222 is preserved because a severe thunderstorm frightened the crowd. He had his episcopal court and, most unusually, dual officials, Master Reginald of Radnor and Master Robert d'Arches. His extant 'acta' include an admission and institution of a rector, ordinations of settlements before papal delegates, confirmations of grants by his predecessors, indulgences for almshouses in Hereford and pilgrims to St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury, and a letter to Christ Church, Canterbury, promising that his consecration elsewhere would not prejudice their rights. Since the bishop of London was dean of the province of Canterbury, between the death of Archbishop Langton on 9 July 1228 and his own on 31 October of that year Fauconberg held metropolitan jurisdiction. It was presumably in this capacity that the king promised to hold him and his church harmless if he would renew the excommunication of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, prince of Wales. 
Considering his political opportunities Fauconberg exercised great moderation in enriching either himself or his church. He did, however, seek through the royal courts to recover alienations from his church's endowment. In courts Christian he sought to limit the exemption of Westminster Abbey from his diocesan authority, but the case was settled by a compromise. His relations with his chapter were harmonious, and his executors were three of the canons. When he died he was buried in his cathedral, a marble tomb was raised over his grave, and two chantries were established for the health of his soul. The chroniclers remembered him as a man commendable in all things, discreet, merciful, and jocund. He was also a man of taste: at the end of the century the treasury of St Paul's contained several 'objets d'art' that had been his, most notably a great silver gilt morse or clasp, heavily jewelled, on which were figures of St Paul attended by two bishops; and a small gold cross, jewelled and containing wood of the true cross.

Faulkner, Sir Arthur Brooke (1779-1847), physician and author, was the fourth and youngest son of Hugh Faulkner (1733-1801), of Wellbroke and Seville Park, co. Tyrone, and Castletown, co. Carlow, Ireland, and Florence (died 1792), daughter of the Revd Henry Cole of Brookfield, co. Fermanagh, and niece of the first Baron Mount Florence. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1795, and in due course graduated BA, having studied chemistry and anatomy. He then became a medical student at Edinburgh University, graduating MD in 1803. His next two years were spent in London as a student at the London Hospital, the Westminster Hospital, and the Surrey Dispensary. In 1805 he was incorporated BA of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, by virtue of his Dublin degree, and MA the same year; his Cambridge MA served to procure him the 'ad eundem' degree at Trinity College; and finally he used this Dublin MA to get incorporated as BM and MD of Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1806. In 1807 he became a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, and was elected fellow in 1808. In 1810 he married Anne, daughter of Mr Donald McLeod or M'Leod of Lewes, Sussex. 
Faulkner was appointed physician to the forces and served on the staff in Spain, the Netherlands, Sicily, and Malta. In 1810 he published 'Considerations on the Expediency of Establishing an Hospital for Officers on Foreign Service'. He was at Malta when the plague was introduced there in 1813 (after an interval of 140 years) by a vessel from Alexandria; he distinguished himself by tracing the spread of the disease, by his vigorous advocacy of the doctrine of contagion, and by directing the quarantine procedure whereby the disease was kept within bounds. He retired from the service in 1815 and, returning to England, was knighted in February 1815 and appointed physician to the duke of Sussex. He communicated his experiences of plague to the 'Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal' (April 1814), gave evidence in favour of its contagiousness before the House of Commons committee in 1819, and published a full account of the Malta outbreak in 1820 in a 'Treatise on the Plague'. 
Faulkner was also a writer on non-medical subjects. 'Rambling Notes and Reflections' (1827) described a visit to France; 'Visit to Germany and the Low Countries' (2 vols., 1833) was his second book; and 'Letters to Lord Brougham' (1837) described a visit to Italy. Faulkner freely admitted that these works were as much about affairs in Britain as his travels abroad, and he continued his reforming drive in pamphlets (published 1828-40), in which he argued for reform of the church, the universities, and the Royal College of Physicians, appearing to deprecate, among other things, the ingenious way in which he had acquired his degrees. 
Faulkner settled as a physician at Cheltenham, and died, childless, at his residence at Evington, near Cheltenham, on 19 January 1847.

Faulkner, Benjamin Rawlinson (1787-1849), portrait painter, was born at Manchester, Lancashire, and baptized there at St Ann's Church on 17 January 1787, the son of William Faulkner and his wife, Elizabeth. His early career was in commerce, spending several years representing a firm at Gibraltar. When an epidemic of the plague hit Gibraltar, Faulkner became seriously ill and returned to England about 1813. During convalescence, aged twenty-five, he turned to drawing, encouraged by his elder brother, the artist Joshua Wilson Faulkner ['see below']. After practising art, which included at least two years drawing from the antique, Faulkner moved to London about 1816. He lived at Hatton Garden, then in the 1830s and 1840s in Newman Street, Soho, a centre for artists at that time. In spite of being known at Manchester for his portraits of worthy local men such as Robert Hindley (City Art Gallery, Manchester) and William Nield (Art Gallery and Museum, Salford), Faulkner's quiet nature could be taken for diffidence and this worked against him in London. However, he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1821 until 1848 (Graves records his work as being exhibited there until 1859); his paintings of women were particularly noted and he gained respect for his portraits. He also exhibited at the British Institution and the Society of British Artists, as well as the Royal Manchester Institution and the Liverpool Academy. 
Faulkner's portraits of John Dalton FRS (1841), Sir William Fairbairn, engineer, and the geologist John MacCulloch are at the Royal Society, London, and a portrait of John George Children (1826), secretary of the Royal Society, is at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Three of his portraits of bishops are at Christ Church, Oxford, that of George Murray, bishop of Rochester (exh. RA, 1829) being, perhaps, the most distinguished. A portrait of Isaac Crewdson (1840; priv. coll.) bears Faulkner's monogram. Faulkner painted four portraits of Sir John Ross, the Arctic explorer; three are after the portrait by James Green (1833; NPG) and one of these is at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. Painted before the age of photography and without swagger, Faulkner's portraits are usually half or three-quarter lengths, showing the sitter in clerical robes or military uniform or seated at a desk, defining the sitter's claim to fame. Good collections of engravings after his portraits are at the British Museum, London, and the City Art Gallery, Manchester. In his genre works the period is evoked with titles such as 'Spare a Halfpenny' and 'Maternal Affection'. Engravings after Faulkner can be found as illustrations to Sir Walter Scott's novels. 
Faulkner died at his home, 7 Rosa Villas (later Lillie Road), Fulham, London on 29 October 1849. Besides painting, Faulkner was an accomplished musician and was for a time organist at the Caledonian Chapel in Hatton Garden when Edward Irving was minister.

Faulkner, George (1703?-1775), printer and bookseller, was probably born in 1703: the previously accepted birth date of 1699 has been superseded by a note in Faulkner's own hand recently discovered in the British Library (Egerton MS 201, fol. 6). Faulkner's father is reported to have been a butcher and a member of the established church, while his mother has been distantly linked with Viscount Thomas Dillon's family. 
Faulkner received a rudimentary education under the care of the Revd Dr Lloyd, reportedly the most eminent Irish schoolmaster of the time, between about 1710 and 1716. About 1717 he was apprenticed to the printer and bookseller of Cork Hill, Dublin, Thomas Hume. He seems to have served the typical seven-year term before setting up his own shop at some time in 1724. He was made free of the city in 1728 and sworn free of the Guild of St Luke the same year. Evidence from his imprints and from Wilson's 'Dublin Directory' (1760-1837) reveal his business as operating at a succession of Dublin locations: Pembroke Court, Castle Street (1725-August 1726); Christchurch Yard (August 1726-1728); pamphlet shop opposite the Tholsel, Skinner Row (January 1729-May 1730); pamphlet shop in Essex Street (May 1730-62); Blind Quay, at the corner of Parliament Street (1763-5); and Parliament Street (1766-75). From 1726 he was in business with the bookseller and printer James Hoey, but the two separated when Faulkner moved to his new shop in Essex Street in 1730. 
From his earliest days in the trade Faulkner's commitment to a Dublin shop appears to have been unsettled: despite the responsibilities of his new business, he seemed more anxious to be working in the London trade, making at least two extended visits to England during the late 1720s. Having palmed off on Hoey the responsibilities of publishing the twice-weekly 'Dublin Journal', Faulkner spent at least the first six months of 1726 and much of 1729 in London, employed at the shop of William Bowyer sen. (from whom he would later purchase secondhand type and ornaments for his Dublin shop). Here he also began a lifelong acquaintance with the younger Bowyer, with whom he later shared many copyrights. In September 1730 he was back in London, where he experienced two major events: before leaving Dublin for London, he had suffered an injury to his shin which, foolishly neglected, turned gangrenous and required the amputation of his leg; and while in London he also married the widow Mary Taylor (1707/8-1755). 
Despite Faulkner's printing a Dublin edition of Swift's 'Drapier Letters' under the title 'Fraud Detected, or, The Hibernian Patriot' in 1725, hard evidence is lacking to determine whether any relationship existed between the author and printer at this point. Nor is it clear whether the dean interceded with his London friends on Faulkner's behalf while both were in London in 1726, or during Faulkner's subsequent visits in the decade. However, Faulkner's relationship with Swift had certainly begun to jell by 1730 when, in partnership with Bowyer, he printed Swift's 'A Vindication of Lord Carteret'. Also, except for the period from September 1730 to May 1731 when Faulkner was again in London, the content of his 'Dublin Journal' shows a growing affiliation with Swift. When Faulkner printed 'Queries' ('Dublin Journal', Feb 1732) from Swift's 'Considerations upon Two Bills Relating to the Clergy', he was ordered into custody by the House of Lords and, upon begging forgiveness, was reprimanded and released. His courage won Swift's favour, and the dean's subsequent correspondence with Pope implies a growing friendship with the printer. 
On 9 February 1733 Faulkner issued proposals for publishing Swift's 'Works' in four volumes by subscription. When the news reached London and vexed Benjamin Motte, who had published Swift's 'Miscellanies' the previous year, Swift, despite his obvious co-operation in producing Faulkner's edition, initially proved false to his new friend by attempting to dissociate himself from the work when writing to his London contacts. As late as 30 August 1734, in a letter to the earl of Oxford, Swift claimed the edition was 'against my Will', and that he would have nothing more to do with the printer unless he published something 'offensive' or 'unworthy' and then 'he will have cause to repent it' ('Correspondence', 4.248). Swift seems to have forgotten that six months earlier his letter to Oxford had begun: 'The Bearer Mr. Faulkner, the Prince of Dublin Printers' (ibid., 4.222). Faulkner's own version of Swift's involvement in the preparation of the edition seems more credible. In each morning session, Faulkner reports, he read the text before Swift and his two manservants. When Swift had any doubt of the meaning, he would ask the servants for their understanding and amend until they got it perfectly. In this manner, Faulkner says, Swift revised every sheet of the first seven volumes ('Prose Works', 13.202-3). 
With the appearance of the edition on 7 January 1735, however, Swift proved the Irish patriot. When Motte attacked Faulkner for pirating his property, Swift wrote a fiery letter to the London bookseller on 25 May 1736, defending Faulkner, raising his voice on behalf of Dublin booksellers against the 'cruel Oppressions of this Kingdom by England', and claiming that if he were a Dublin bookseller he would 'reprint London Books, and run them to any Town, in England that I could' ('Correspondence', 4.493). Despite Swift's advocacy, Motte gained an injunction against the sale of Faulkner's edition in London on the following 28 November. Swift had also come to Faulkner's defence three months earlier in a letter to Bishop Josiah Hort, the printing of whose 'New Proposal for the Better Regulation of Quadrille' found Faulkner summoned to the House of Commons on 3 March 1736 upon a libel complaint by Sergeant Bettesworth. Faulkner spent five days in Newgate and supposedly, in lieu of fees, paid the officers with copies of his edition of Swift. On 12 May Swift wrote to Hort, detailing Faulkner's suffering as a result of the publication, rebuking the bishop for his insisting that the printer must run the hazard, and exhorting the bishop to recompense the printer for his troubles. Faulkner remained Swift's printer for the rest of the dean's life and acquired some of the author's unpublished pieces in the years before his own death. 
The sale and reputation Faulkner had gained from the edition of Swift's 'Works' seems to have confirmed his commitment to his Dublin shop; his protracted stays in London now dwindled to shorter annual visits. Over the next few years, he advertised 200 London books as sold at his shop (1735); he printed an Irish edition of Pope's 'Works' (1736); reprinted an edition of Richardson's 'Pamela' (1741); was active in the Dublin Society; became a church warden at St Werburgh's (1743) and a founding member of the Physico-Historical Society (1744), whose purpose was the study of Irish history and resources; undertook the largest work yet to be published in Dublin, 'The Universal History' (1744-6); and, shortly after Swift's death, conducted a subscription for a monument to mark the dean's grave. 
In 1745 Faulkner began a lifelong friendship with Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield, recently appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland. Although ambiguous in his appreciation of the printer, the noble patron of letters was naturally attracted to Faulkner's bookshop, dined often at the proprietor's table, and, late in life, wrote favourably of his literary ability and other virtues. The story of Faulkner's refusal of a knighthood offered by Chesterfield, although it does the printer credit, became the source of much public embarrassment when a clergyman and friend named Stevens published anonymously 'Chivalrie, No Trifle' (1746), a satiric dialogue in which a disappointed lady fantasizes about the delights accruing from the title and harasses Sir George until he reverses his decision. 
In October 1747 Faulkner took on the son of his sister Elizabeth, Samuel Smith, as an apprentice. By 1758 Smith was publishing independently from his uncle's shop, issuing such works as the third edition of Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy' in 1760. In 1757 Smith visited Robert Dodsley in London on Faulkner's behalf; in 1762 he subscribed for fourteen sets of Faulkner's edition of Swift's 'Works'; but in the 1770s he seems to have yielded his role in Faulkner's shop to his cousin Thomas Todd, who eventually inherited the business. 
Faulkner's energy and enterprise continued to build his fortune and reputation as both printer and publisher. By 1748 he was able to list 1000 titles in stock, some by well-known native sons of Ireland. Faulkner had issued Henry Brooke's drama 'Gustavus Vasa' in 1739 and 'The Farmer's Letter to the Protestants of Ireland' in 1745, to which he would add 'The Interests of Ireland Considered' (1759), and 'The Tryal of the Cause of the Roman Catholics' (1762). His liberal theology emerged in his publication of two works by the Arianist Irish bishop Robert Clayton, the controversial 'Essay on the Spirit' (1753) and the 'Vindication of the Histories of the Old and New Testament' (1753), a work he shared with Bowyer. He also reprinted Bishop George Berkeley's 'The Querist' (1750), 'A Miscellany' (1752), and 'A Word to the Wise, or, An Exhortation to the Roman Catholic Clergy of Ireland' (1752). 
However, the 1750s also brought Faulkner further embarrassments and personal blows. In November 1751, although he had sold 300 copies of 'Remarks on the Life and Writings of Dr. Jonathan Swift' by John Boyle, fifth earl of Orrery, in a single week, Faulkner anticipated well the criticism he would receive for this indiscreet publication when writing to Orrery on 30 November: 'I am likely to be hanged, drawn and quartered for printing and publishing this Libel against my best Friend and Benefactor' ('Prince of Dublin Printers', 39). His liberal politics brought more discomfort. While his constant round of dinner parties was partly intended to mitigate the hostilities between subscribers to the patriot and the court parties, his friendship with Lord Chesterfield and his description in the 'Dublin Journal' of 'modern patriotism' as consisting of 'eating, drinking, and quarrelling' earned him the wrath of the earl of Kildare and his patriot followers. Patriot satirists characterized Faulkner in various pamphlets as 'Sir Tady Faulkner, printer in petto to the Court Party'. Further, the financial instability of Ireland in 1754, as well as that of his own business, caused additional anxiety. Recounting the numerous daily bankruptcies in Dublin, Faulkner wrote to Orrery that if bookselling did not improve, he 'must quit business, go to London... and beg your Lordship's protection' (ibid., 44-5). Personally, Lady Fortune was no kinder. On 13 January 1755 Mary, his beloved wife of twenty-five years, died aged forty-seven and was buried in the Cabbage Garden graveyard. In March the same year, during a violent storm, Faulkner suffered several fractures when struck by a sign falling from its second-floor mooring. 
Faulkner's luck in a particular quarter of the London trade was no different. When, in January 1741, he had joined George Ewing to reprint Samuel Richardson's London edition of 'Pamela', he opened another troublesome chapter in his relationship with a London counterpart, although Richardson would not make an issue of the 'piracy' until a dozen years later. In the interim, the additional income to be gained from Dublin reprints prompted Richardson to contract with Faulkner in August 1748 for the Dublin edition of 'Clarissa', an arrangement that went fairly smoothly. In July 1753 Richardson contracted with Faulkner for a Dublin edition of 'Sir Charles Grandison'. However, early the following month Faulkner was compelled to write to Richardson to complain that he had received only four sheets of the text while four other Dublin printers had received much more and were preparing to issue their own editions. Richardson responded by accusing Faulkner of collusion, and the other Dublin booksellers of bribing his servants to obtain these sheets. Richardson then dismissed two suspected journeymen (including Thomas Killingbeck, a former Faulkner employee) and continued to turn a deaf ear to Faulkner's explanations of Dublin trade protocol and his offer to surrender any interest in the publication. Supported by Samuel Johnson and David Garrick and the London press, Richardson's anger with the Dublin trade finally resulted in 'An Address to the Public' on 1 February 1754, a pamphlet he distributed gratis to the public and later included in the last volume of 'Grandison', in which he detailed the facts in the case and arraigned Faulkner as the primary culprit. 
Richardson's rancour over the affair seems to have continued unabated. Three years later, when Faulkner, as a long-time member of the Dublin Society for Promoting Husbandry and Other Useful Arts, was invited to describe the society's work at a meeting of its fledgeling London counterpart, the Society for Promoting Arts, Commerce, and Manufactures (of which Richardson was a member), his presentation was thought of such interest that at the end of the meeting he was proposed as a corresponding member of the society. However, when his election was held at the opening of the society's next meeting on 23 February 1757, Faulkner became the first person in its three-year history to be blackballed. 
One pleasure that delighted Faulkner in the late 1750s was the rural 'villa' he had apparently recently acquired. Writing to Samuel Derrick on 16 November 1758, he said a recent party that included the actor Henry Woodward and his wife were 'in Raptures at my Gardens, Improvements and Serpentine River'. He exulted that his villa had become a 'Receptacle for the Literati and all Men of Genius in every Profession, some of whom have written Poems, and others have drawn Plans and Perspective Views of my little farm with all the adjacent Beauties' ('Prince of Dublin Printers', 51-3). The exact location of this villa is unclear. 
In 1760, commenting on Faulkner's popularity during his annual visits to London, Chesterfield wrote: 'he is become so great and considerable a man here in the republic of letters... I have been able to get him to dine with me but twice' (Stanhope, 3.364). Detailing Chesterfield's observation, Faulkner's letters from London to Samuel Derrick during the first half of 1761 abound with accounts of dinners and dates with a cross-section of fashionable London society. Such celebrity played into the hands of Samuel Foote, who, the following year, acted a successful parody of the lisping, one-legged printer as Peter Paragraph in his farcical 'Orators' at the Haymarket Theatre, London. Chesterfield suggested that Faulkner instigate a suit against the comedian and offered his services, but Faulkner procrastinated until Foote brought the farce to his own soil, acting the piece at Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, in October 1762. Supposedly, Faulkner paid his employees' entrance to the debut with directions to disrupt the performance, although the plot failed. None the less, he brought a libel suit and gained a favourable decision from Judge Robinson. The small fine imposed on Foote, however, did not compensate for the local ridicule Faulkner endured as a result of the comedian's lifelike portrait. True to character, Faulkner capitalized on his embarrassment by publishing his own edition of the farce (1762) and, years later, must have enjoyed some satisfaction when Foote lost his own leg. 
Other events of the 1760s reflect both Faulkner's frustrations and his successes with his fellow Dubliners. Although he was elected warden to the Guild of St Luke in 1764, his attempts to become master in 1766, 1769, and 1772 failed. In 1767, vexed with the piracy of Lyttelton's 'History of the Life of King Henry the Second' (which Faulkner probably had from James Dodsley, the publisher of the London edition), Faulkner printed in the 'Dublin Journal' (2 June) a heated denunciation of the 'Malignity, Hatred, Envy and Malice' of some Dublin booksellers whose piratical practices had robbed him and others of their rightful property and at the same time were threatening to undermine the local trade. Although Faulkner, when elected sheriff in May 1767, escaped service by claiming weak health and paying a $10 fine, he seemed to relish the citizens' appreciation when they elected him an alderman of the city on 16 November 1770. 
On 22 May 1770 Faulkner's curious penchant for making himself the butt of humour prompted him to print in the 'Dublin Journal' an advertisement for a new periodical called the 'Monstrous Magazine', published by his sometime collaborator George Ewing and inscribed to the author of widely derided plays and poetry, Faulkner's alderman friend Gorges Edmond Howard. Not only did this gesture provoke a protracted quarrel between Faulkner and the offended Howard, but Robert Jephson fanned the fire to the delight of the town by writing a series of epigrams published in the 'Dublin Mercury' and, the next year, two satirical verse epistles parodying the two adversaries, all of which were passed off as the work of Faulkner and Howard themselves. 
Although plagued by gout, which took him to Bath in April 1770, Faulkner finished the last years of his career in relative peace. With his nephew Thomas Todd largely at the reins during the period, Faulkner's shop turned out some significant publications: a twenty-volume edition of Swift's 'Works' (1772), the completion of Lyttelton's 'History of King Henry the Second' (1773), Chesterfield's 'Letters to his Son' (1774), and in the following year the first edition of 'Ogygia Vindicated', written in 1686 by the Irish historian Roderic O'Flaherty, edited by Charles O'Conor, the friend that the patriot Faulkner had long urged to write a history of Ireland. 
Faulkner died in Dublin on 30 August 1775, his death supposedly brought on by a respiratory affliction aggravated while dining, ten days earlier, with friends in a newly painted suburban tavern; he was buried in the Cabbage Garden, at the foot of Cathedral Lane. Childless, Faulkner left his business and property to Thomas Todd, who for the previous five years had been publishing independently at Faulkner's Parliament Street shop. Todd assumed his uncle's surname, gained an appointment as printer to the city, and carried on the business until his death in 1793. Faulkner's will, dated 17 May 1770 and proved on 18 September 1775, mentions his nephews Thomas Todd and Samuel Smith, Smith's wife Frances and daughter Mary, his half-brother Samuel Faulkner, and nieces and cousins; Mary Anne Faulkner, the printer's niece and adopted daughter, had become a singer in London and the mistress of George Montagu, earl of Halifax, who had been viceroy of Ireland from 1761 to 1763. 
Beginning in the month after his death, an anonymous two-part memoir in successive issues of the 'Hibernian Magazine' described Faulkner as 'something under the middle size' but with a 'large body', 'manly' features, and a 'pleasing though grave' countenance. The account lauds Faulkner as 'transcendently eminent; as a citizen, of approved probity in his dealings, generous and hospitable... as a shopkeeper, courteous and obliging to every rank; as a husband, relation, friend, affectionate, tender, social and entertaining' (p. 570). Such varnished public accounts are tempered, however, by the candid commentary of those who knew Faulkner in company. Recounting a dinner he attended at Faulkner's house, the playwright Richard Cumberland reported that Faulkner had a 'solemn intrepidity of egoism' and that he was 'pre-eminently and by preference the butt and buffoon of the company', but that he could retaliate with 'left-handed thrusts as few could parry'. Inclined to affect the gallant, Cumberland says, Faulkner claimed that he lost his leg while fleeing from an enraged husband (Cumberland, 174). 
However, Faulkner was a complex character whose flaws were offset by many virtues. His often-mentioned charity to the poor and the distressed is illustrated by his donation of dozens of loaves of bread and bags of coal to the prisoners in Marshalsea in July 1769. In his will he bequeathed sums of $10 to $100 to more than a dozen hospitals, almshouses, and schools. Although an Anglican, he was of a liberal disposition, counting as a close friend and correspondent the Catholic Charles O'Connor, with whom he sympathized for the repressed condition of Catholics in Ireland. Although of no faction, as a founding member of the Physico-Historical Society he was a strong Irish patriot. In his 'Dublin Journal' he incessantly pleaded the cause of Irish manufactures and strongly opposed the union of English and Irish parliaments. Most of all, he liked people, particularly those of wit and intelligence, and his house was famous for a constant round of elaborate dinners and entertaining company from all ranks. As expressed in a letter to O'Connor, his goal was 'to make all the World Friends and Agreeable to each other, and... to cure all Prejudices, and make the World happy' ('Prince of Dublin Printers', 111). 
During his fifty-year career Faulkner raised himself head and shoulders above the rest of the Dublin trade. His publishing output, including solo and collaborative productions, was the 'largest of the century' (Pollard, 202). He was well known for the number of apprentices he trained and for the journeymen he employed. Contrary to received opinion about the eighteenth-century Irish book trade, many of his reprints of London editions were undertaken in agreement with their British authors and publishers, who ate and drank with Faulkner during his annual London visits. Although perhaps exaggerated, Faulkner's claim that all of his copyrights were 'obtained in the fairest Manner from different Authors and Proprietors in Great Britain and Ireland, at much Trouble and Expence' ('Dublin Journal', 2 June 1767) has gained strength from recent research and distinguishes him from most of his Dublin contemporaries. Knowing the value of the Irish market, the Bowyers (who owed him at least twenty-seven publications) and the Dodsleys (who shared many works with Faulkner), as well as Lockyer Davis, Lacey Hawes, Charles Hitch, Andrew Millar, Samuel Richardson, James Rivington, and Paul Vaillant, all recognized the advantages of dealing with Faulkner. Swift's early epithet for Faulkner, the Prince of Dublin Printers, turned out to be prophetic.

Faulkner, George (1790?-1862), industrialist and philanthropist, was born in Oldham Street, Manchester. In 1812 he became a partner in Samuel Faulkner & Co., a firm of cotton and silk spinners. In 1825 he and his friend John Owens built a profitable cotton mill in Ancoats, Manchester. It is said that Owens at one time intended to leave all his money to Faulkner and that Faulkner persuaded him to found a college instead. There is no good evidence for this story, and it sounds implausible since Owens left substantial sums to relatives and smaller amounts to local charities, as well as $10,000 to Faulkner, before devoting the residue of his estate to the foundation of Owens College. Faulkner, as first chairman of the trustees, presided over the infancy of the college (1846-58) before retiring on account of ill health. By then he had also retired from business except for the ownership of commercial property in various parts of Manchester. He was of a 'retiring and unostentatious disposition'. He subscribed generously to local hospitals and served as deputy treasurer of Manchester Royal Infirmary. In his lifetime he endowed the Faulkner chair of political economy at Owens College, and the Wellington scholarship for the study of the Greek text of the 'New Testament'. In his will he made a further bequest to the infirmary, and other bequests to Anglican charities in the diocese of Chester. He had no children and left most of his estate to his wife, Elizabeth, and his two sisters. He died at his home, Limebank, Crumpsall, Manchester, on 21 February 1862.

Joshua Wilson Faulkner (bap. 1783-d. 1874), portrait painter, was Faulkner's elder brother. He was baptized at St Ann's, Manchester, on 28 February 1783. He is remembered chiefly for his miniature portraits of officers. He was a member of the Liverpool Academy, where he exhibited; he also exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1809 to 1820, and settled in London in 1816 or 1817. On 29 November 1819, at St Marylebone, London, he married Elizabeth Susanna Jones ('b'. 1782/3-1864), the daughter of John Burnett Jones and Elizabeth Susannah Estwick, both of whom were from wealthy Barbados families. The couple had two children, Henry Dernberg (1823/4-1870) and Edrica (1821/2-1890), and subsequently lived in Italy, before returning to Brasted, Kent, by the early 1850s. The British Museum has an engraving by S. Freeman after J. W. Faulkner of the actor Charles Mayne Young. He was described by the art critic William Carey as 'a miniature painter of reputation' (Fawcett, 176). He died at his home, The Phillipines, Brasted, near Sevenoaks, Kent, on 5 October 1874.

Faulkner, Thomas (1777-1855), topographer, was born in Fulham, the son of Elizabeth Charlotte Faulkner (1742/3-1802). Nothing is known of his father, but some members of the family are known to have been active and successful in the building trade in west London. 
Faulkner kept a small bookseller's and stationer's shop at 1 Paradise Row for many years. He is believed to have had a limited education, but had sufficient knowledge of French and Spanish to gain employment as a translator. He began his literary career in 1797 by communications to the 'Gentleman's Magazine', to which he was an occasional contributor for over half a century. He later became a contributor to various volumes of the earlier series of the 'New Monthly Magazine and Universal Register'. In 1805 he published 'A Short Account of Chelsea Hospital', which was followed in 1810 by 'A historical and topographical account of Chelsea and its environs, with biographical anecdotes of illustrious and eminent persons who have resided in Chelsea during the three preceding centuries'. The work was dedicated to Brownlow North, bishop of Winchester, who then had an official house in Chelsea. Faulkner is said to have been assisted in the compilation by the Revd Weedon Butler (1773-1831), a local schoolmaster. A second edition of the work appeared in 1829. 
In 1813 Faulkner published 'A historical and topographical account of the parish of Fulham, including the hamlet of Hammersmith', dedicated to John Randolph, then bishop of London; and in 1820 his 'History and antiquities of Kensington, with biographical anecdotes of royal and distinguished personages, and a descriptive catalogue of the pictures in the palace from a survey taken by the late Benjamin West, PRA, by command of his majesty'. This work was dedicated to George IV. Some etchings illustrative of the work were published by Robert Banks, from original drawings in the possession of W. Simonds Higgs FSA, a resident in Kensington, and in 1831 eight views of Kew Gardens were published from drawings by J. Sargeant, engraved by H. Waller and John Rogers. 
In 1839 Faulkner brought out his 'History and Antiquities of Hammersmith', which was dedicated to Queen Victoria; in 1845, he published his 'History and Antiquities of Brentford, Chiswick, and Ealing', which was unfavourably reviewed in 'The Athenaeum' in December of that year. Both these works contained biographical notices of local worthies during the three preceding centuries. 
Faulkner was a member of the Society of Antiquaries of Normandy. By 1851 he was a widower (the name of his wife is not known) with an unmarried son who was a bookseller and two unmarried daughters who were teachers, with several pupils boarding in their Chelsea household. He died at his home, 27 Smith Street, Chelsea, on 26 May 1855, at the age of seventy-eight. He was buried in Brompton cemetery.

Faulknor, Robert (1763-1795), naval officer, was born in Northampton, the eldest son of Captain Robert Faulknor and Elizabeth ('nee' Ashe). Faulknor was the fifth generation of his family to serve in the Royal Navy. His father commanded the 'Bellona' (74 guns) during the Seven Years' War and captured the French 'Courageux' (74 guns) in 1761 after an action lasting 55 minutes; his grandfather was Captain Samuel Faulknor of the 'Victory', which was lost with all hands on the Casqueds rocks on 5 October 1744; his great-grandfather was Captain William Faulknor, who was lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital at his death in 1725. Faulknor's uncle, Captain Jonathan Faulknor, commanded the 'Victory' under Admiral Keppel in the action off Ushant on 27 July 1778, and his first cousin Jonathan Faulknor died as rear-admiral of the red in 1809. 
Faulknor's family moved to Dijon, France, where his father died on 9 May 1769. Elizabeth Faulknor returned with the children to Northampton where the two sons were placed at a grammar school. Faulknor was entered at the Royal Naval Academy, Portsmouth, in 1774 and completed his term there in March 1777. He joined the 'Isis' (50 guns), commanded by the Hon. William Cornwallis on the North American station, and followed him to the 'Bristol' (50 guns) and then the 'Lion' (64 guns), serving in several engagements between 1779 and 1780. 
Between December 1780 and March 1783 Faulknor served in the 'Princess Royal' (98 guns) and 'Britannia' (98 guns), winning the praise of Rear-Admiral Sir Joshua Rowley, who considered him 'a young man of great merit' (Ralfe, 310). In March 1783, at the end of the American War of Independence, the 'Britannia' was paid off but Faulknor, one of a small number of officers employed during the years of peace, was appointed to the sloop 'Merlin' and then, in December 1783, to the 'Daphne' (20 guns). 
During the Nootka Sound crisis in May 1790 he was appointed to serve in the 'Impregnable' (98 guns). Six months later he was promoted commander, but he had to wait until April 1791 to be given his first command, the fireship 'Pluto', which he retained until September 1791. He then remained on half pay until June 1793 when, Britain being at war with France, he was given the sloop 'Zebra' cruising in the English Channel. Shortly after, following his mother's lobbying of Lord Chatham, the 'Zebra' was attached to Sir John Jervis's expedition to the West Indies. In February 1794 during the attack on Martinique, the 'Zebra' and the 'Asia' (64 guns) were ordered to anchor close under the walls of Fort St Louis to cover an attack by troops and seamen in smaller craft under the direct command of Captains Riou and Nugent. The 'Asia' failed to reach her allotted position but Faulknor, taking the 'Zebra' in close to the fort, personally led his men in scaling the walls. During this he experienced a lucky escape when a wooden cartouche box strapped to his waist was struck by grapeshot leaving him unharmed. Although the fort had probably already been entered by the force under Riou and Nugent, Faulknor's action was witnessed by Jervis who publicly praised him and promoted him captain of the frigate 'Rose'. Several months later Faulknor was given the heavier frigate 'Blanche' (32 guns), and the expedition moved to attack the island of Guadeloupe. On 21 April, while leading a party of his seamen in the attack on Fort Fleur d'Epee, he was attacked by two French soldiers, lost his sword, and was knocked to the ground, but he was rescued by his own men. 
Known for being 'fiery, fierce, and ungoverned in his passions', a weakness which even he had to admit to, Faulknor wrote on one occasion of his own 'unfortunate rashness and impetuosity' (Gilpin, 113; Ralfe, 3.314). During the attack on Guadeloupe, Faulknor became involved in an angry altercation with an engineer who was critical of the battery erected by men under his command. During the course of this exchange a quartermaster of the 'Boyne' (98 guns), Jervis's flagship, made some form of contemptuous comment and Faulknor ran him through with his sword, killing him instantly. The seamen working on the battery promptly refused to serve under him and a mutiny was averted only by the intercession of other officers. Faulknor was immediately court martialled. 
While maintaining that he had been provoked Faulknor was, nevertheless, remorseful. Waiting for his court martial he wrote to Lieutenant Hill of the 'Zebra' that his concern was 'less for my own fate, than that of being accessory to the death of any human being not the natural enemy of myself or my country... the hasty and sudden punishment I unhappily inflicted on the spot will be a source of lasting affliction to my mind. (Ralfe, 3.314)' Although acquitted by the court martial his remaining days were troubled. He became morose and his crew claimed that he was restless, pacing his cabin during the night.In December 1794 the 'Blanche' was detached to cruise off the French-held island of Desirade. On 4 January 1795 the crew of the 'Blanche' discovered the French frigate 'Pique' off Pointe a Pitre, Guadeloupe. Although it appeared initially that the French ship was trying to avoid an action, the two ships came to close engagement in the early hours of 5 January. After an hour and three-quarters the 'Pique' ran her bow on board the 'Blanche', from which position she could bring virtually none of her guns to bear on the English frigate which had by this time lost her main and mizen masts. Faulknor and members of his crew quickly lashed the French ship's bowsprit to the remains of the 'Blanche''s main mast to prevent the 'Pique' from manoeuvring. Although wounded, Faulknor continued to direct the action until killed by two musket shot. Two hours later the 'Pique' surrendered to the 'Blanche', now commanded by Lieutenant Frederick Watkins. Faulknor was buried the day after his death on the Isles des Saintes. Following the news of Faulknor's death a memorial was erected in St Paul's Cathedral, London.

Faunt, Arthur (1553/4-1591), Jesuit, was the third son of William Faunt of Foston, Leicestershire, and his wife, Jane, daughter of George Vincent of Peckleton, and widow of Nicholas Purefoy of Drayton, in the same county. Both his parents were Roman Catholics. In 1568 he was sent to Merton College, Oxford, where John Pott, a Catholic philosopher who had been expelled from his fellowship in 1563, was allowed to tutor him privately. Under the wardenship of John Man, who had been imposed on the college by Archbishop Parker in 1562, Merton came under the control of the protestant party. In 1569 Pott removed Faunt from Oxford with the consent of his parents and accompanied him to Louvain, where he entered the Society of Jesus in 1570, aged seventeen. After graduating in the humanities at Louvain he proceeded in 1571 to Munich, where he was maintained in his studies by William, duke of Bavaria. From about 1575 onwards Faunt used the name in religion Laurence, and was commonly known as Laurence Arthur Faunt. Having graduated MA at Munich in 1576 he went as a theological student to the English College, Rome, in the same year, and was appointed reader in theology there in 1578. He was ordained at Rome in 1580. 
In 1581 Faunt was appointed by the Jesuit father-general, Claudio Acquaviva, to the recently established Jesuit college at Poznan, Poland, where he taught theology and apologetics at the diocesan seminary, and Greek in the 'Gymnasium'. He was vice-rector of the college from 1585 to 1590. At the time Poznan became the centre of a campaign by the Jesuits to win back the great Polish magnate families who had converted to protestantism. Faunt, who was regarded as a victim of religious persecution in his own country, played a major part in this counter-offensive. He was prominent in the public debates between the Jesuits and their Calvinist and Lutheran opponents, and published some ten works at Poznan in defence of Tridentine doctrine. These works included a defence of the Catholic doctrine of the priesthood against the French Calvinist Antonius Sadeel (Antoine de la Roche Chandieu), and a similar defence of the invocation of saints against the Heidelberg Calvinist Daniel Tossanus (Daniel Toussain). At the request of the Polish primate, StanisLaw Karnkowski, he addressed the provincial synod at Piotrkow in 1589 on the causes and remedies of heresy. He also published a treatise in defence of church privileges and tithes against the claims of the secular nobility. 
In 1590 Faunt was appointed professor of dogmatic theology at the Jesuit academy in Vilna, Poland, where he died on 28 February 1591.

Faunt, Nicholas (1553/4-1608), administrator, was the son of John Faunt of Canterbury, Kent. He came from Canterbury and was one of the first scholars to go up from King's School to Cambridge. He was admitted as a pensioner of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 27 January 1572, aged eighteen, before transferring under the Parker foundation to Corpus Christi College, graduating BA there in 1576. It has been traditionally told of Faunt that in summer 1572 he went to Paris and was there on 22 August when thousands of protestants were slaughtered during the St Bartholomew's day massacre. Faunt, along with a number of other English in Paris, sheltered with Elizabeth I's ambassador, Sir Francis Walsingham, at the embassy. In September Faunt was among the first who was able to give the queen an eyewitness account. Some scholars, however, suggest that the Faunt in Paris was a William Faunt. 
By 1578 Nicholas Faunt had become secretary to Walsingham, now principal secretary, and was engaged in carrying dispatches to English agents abroad and sending back 'intelligence'. During summer 1580 he was again in Paris, and met Anthony Bacon of Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, eldest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, who became his close friend and another collector of information for Walsingham. Faunt's many letters to Bacon during the course of his life provide insight into his views of the religious and political intrigues of the time. The letters Faunt wrote to Bacon while in Paris in the early 1580s in particular provide valuable background on the political scene and related foreign policy issues, while his letters once he returned to England record a great deal about activities at court. Faunt was a committed puritan, and some of his criticisms of John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, made him request that Bacon destroy his letters. Despite this request, the letters are extant. Faunt's religious commitment endeared him to Bacon's mother, Lady Bacon. She mentioned him as a role model not only to Anthony but to her other son, Francis Bacon. Yet though Faunt and Anthony were close, Francis Bacon had little time for Faunt, dismissing him as boring and pedantic. 
Early in 1581 Faunt spent three and a half months in Germany. Later that year he also travelled to Pisa, Padua, and Geneva. Throughout the 1580s he was frequently abroad for his work; the many letters he sent home while on the continent demonstrate his assiduity at gathering information and his trustworthiness as a public servant. In November 1584 Faunt was elected MP for Boroughbridge, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, probably because Walsingham thought it would be useful to have him in parliament. While he does not seem to have played a significant role in the Commons he continued to work as an agent for Walsingham, and in February 1588 was sent to Paris at short notice. This mission was probably in order to search for information concerning the impending Armada campaign. 
About 1584-5 Faunt married the daughter of a London merchant named Archer. His strong friendship with Anthony Bacon continued. He met Bacon when he returned from the continent in ill health in 1592, bringing him to Francis Bacon's lodgings in Gray's Inn. Faunt was obviously respected. After Walsingham's death he worked for William Cecil, Baron Burghley, lord treasurer, who effectively took up the principal secretary's duties, and possibly also for Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, during the 1590s. In 1594 he obtained a grant of crown lands in Yorkshire and in October 1600 Sir Robert Cecil prevailed upon Matthew Hutton, archbishop of York, to grant Faunt a lease of archiepiscopal lands for twenty-one years which was valued at $100 per annum. In 1595 Faunt was made a clerk of the signet, the small personal seal used by the secretary to authenticate documents and to authorize actions in the king's name, and in March 1605-6 there was speculation of his succeeding Ralph Winwood as ambassador at The Hague, though in the end this did not happen. 
Faunt used his experience as secretary to Walsingham to produce in 1592 'A Discourse Touching the Office of Principal Secretary of State'. Though it may well have circulated in manuscript, it was not published until 1905. Faunt had been one of Walsingham's two most confidential secretaries; he, however, suggested it would be better to combine those positions into one. Though he felt loyalty to Walsingham, he also had some criticisms of how he had managed the office. Faunt argued that Walsingham used too many assistants; this not only caused confusion but even more seriously could lead to a real breach of security. He married Abigail ('b'. in or before 1575, died in or after 1608), daughter and heir of Roger Kelke, of Cambridge, and his wife, Rose, by 1594. They had three sons and three daughters, including Anthony, probably so named to honour Anthony Bacon, Faunt's closest friend. Faunt died in 1608.

Fauntleroy, Henry (1784-1824), banker and forger, was born on 12 October 1784, probably in London, the third but eldest surviving son (of five sons and two daughters) of William Fauntleroy (1749-1807), and his wife, Elizabeth (1758-1826), daughter of Revel Kerie, planter, of St Kitts, West Indies. His father, who had originally been a wine merchant and a clerk in Barclays Bank, in 1792 became a partner in the banking house of Marsh, Sibbald & Co., of Berners Street, Marylebone, Middlesex. Young Fauntleroy had a strict nonconformist upbringing and was set to work as a clerk in the house in 1800. He joined the partnership on his father's death. At that time, the other partners were Sir James Sibbald, an elderly baronet; Sibbald's niece's husband, Josias Stracey (afterwards fourth baronet), a country gentleman; and William Marsh, a victualler and naval agent. 
Fauntleroy was a grave and earnest young man who inspired confidence. The bank had comparatively slender resources, which were strained by its advances to contractors for building speculations (chiefly in Marylebone). Fauntleroy, however, was adept at juggling the figures. In 1809 he was obliged to marry Susannah Marianne, daughter of John Young, captain in the Royal Navy and landowner on St Kitts; a son and namesake was born in October, but the Fauntleroys always lived separately. After this matrimonial mishap Fauntleroy plunged into a series of expensive amours. His mistress Mary Bertram, alias Kent (known as Mrs Bang), was superseded about 1819 by Maria Forbes, whom Fauntleroy reportedly seduced when she was a boarding-school pupil. They were sincerely devoted; he established her in a cottage at South Lambeth, and fathered two daughters (1821, 1823). 
Fauntleroy's ancestors included the third baron Stourton and other medieval lords. His genealogical vanity was fed by his amity with Mrs Cathrow-Disney, wife of the complaisant and mercenary Somerset herald. It was a foible of Fauntleroy's that his massive brow and strong chin resembled those of Napoleon Bonaparte, whose bust adorned his mantelshelf. When in 1821 he bought a sumptuous Grecian villa at Brighton he erected a billiard room in the form of Napoleon's travelling tent. He fancied himself, too, as bold and decisive as his hero. 
Marsh, Sibbald had to pay over $100,000 to cover losses on advances to speculative builders in 1814-16 (additional to a similar loss of $60,000 in 1810). The Bank of England was so alarmed that in 1815 it refused Marsh, Sibbald's acceptances at a time when Fauntleroy's personal commitments to house-development on Lord Portman's Marylebone estate were acute (in 1824 he still owned a mews and six houses in Bryanston Square). Rather than submit to a disastrous bankruptcy, he maintained his tottering firm by appropriating trust moneys and securities deposited by bank customers. By forging powers of attorney, Fauntleroy was able to sell consols, annuities, navy loans and other government stock to support the credit of the house. Dividends were duly paid to the rightful proprietors, and the transactions were entered in the books as if perfectly in order. Fauntleroy acted without the knowledge of his partners. He used forgery to cover forgery until eventually securities worth about $360,000 had been appropriated. He lived in terrible suspense, daily expecting his crimes to be discovered, and needed constant change and excitement as an anodyne for his despair. The firm was further strained when Sibbald's death (1819) obliged his surviving partners to pay large sums; a new partner, an army officer named Graham (afterwards Foster-Pigott, MP for Kinross-shire), was easy to mislead. 
Fauntleroy was arrested on 11 September 1824 on a warrant obtained on the deposition of two trustees of annuities who had entrusted stock to him; although dividends had continued to be paid regularly, they had discovered at the Bank of England that the stock had been sold in 1820 under a power of attorney in which Fauntleroy had forged the trustees' signatures. Other forgeries were swiftly identified. After the police-court examination (18 September) Joseph Wilfred Perkins, a vindictive nabob, who had been sheriff of London (1819-20) and had shared Mrs Bang's favours, began vilifying his former boon-companion Fauntleroy in a violent press agitation in the 'Morning Post' and 'The Times'. Some accusations of Fauntleroy's depravity (such as in 'The Times', 24 Sept 1824) are malicious and exaggerated; but they increased the enormity of the journalistic storm raised by his huge frauds. 
At his trial at the Old Bailey (30 October) Fauntleroy admitted his guilt. The evidence, in his own handwriting, was indeed unanswerable. Neither his insistence that every penny raised by his forgeries had been placed to the credit of his bank nor his denial of voluptuous living is credible. In a futile and emotional interlude he called seventeen merchants and bankers who testified to his integrity. After sentence of death was pronounced (2 November) there were strenuous efforts to save him. His case was twice argued before judges on points of law, and petitions were presented to the home secretary, Robert Peel. Finally he was hanged on 30 November 1824 outside Newgate prison before a crowd which was estimated to number 100,000, and buried in the family vault at Bunhill Fields on 2 December. 
Fauntleroy's embezzlement was the most notorious of many frauds which revealed the instability of the British banking system in the early 1820s. These crimes, together with the high level of bank failures, led to reforms imposed in the 'Banking Act' of 1826. Fauntleroy figures as the villain Richard Crawford in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel 'The Disowned' (1828) and as Philip Ramsey in G. W. M. Reynolds's 'Mystery of the Court of London' (1849-60).

Fauquier, Francis (1703-1768), colonial governor, was born in London after 26 March 1703 and was baptized on 11 July 1703 at St Andrew Undershaft, London. He was the second son of John Francis Fauquier (died 1726) and Elizabeth, 'nee' Chamberlaine. His father was deputy to Isaac Newton, master worker of the Royal Mint, and left his son $15,000 in stocks and annuities on his death. Little is known of Fauquier's early life, but he married Catherine Dalston (1710?-1781) and by 1733 they had two sons, Francis and William. A 1730 portrait by William Hogarth of the Wollaston family, into which Fauquier's two sisters had married, includes Fauquier and his wife, and suggests a close extended family. How Fauquier occupied himself in these years is unclear, though in 1733 he became a freeman of Ipswich. However, he was evidently interested in finance and economics, and between 1748 and 1757 he served as one of thirty directors of the South Sea Company. In 1751 he was elected a governor of the Foundling Hospital in London, and he served on its general committee. Subsequently he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London (1753) and a corresponding member of the Society of Arts (1757). 
Fauquier was appointed lieutenant-governor of Virginia on 10 February 1758, and he arrived in the colony in June. It was a difficult time in Virginia. The war with France continued, and the colony was hard pressed to provide support for the war effort, a situation that was exacerbated by short crops of tobacco. While he was sensitive to the colony's concerns, Fauquier was faced with conflicting demands. To fund the military needs the colony emitted paper currency, which was an anathema to British merchants. Because of the shortage of tobacco the Virginia legislature passed the second of two temporary laws, collectively the 'Two Penny Acts', which pegged payment of the clergy, who were normally paid in tobacco, at 2died a pound -- much below the current price. Such a law required a suspending clause, pending the king's approval, but since the clause would have been the equivalent of rejecting the law, Fauquier ignored the requirement. He explained that the legislation was aimed at easing 'the people from a Burthen... thought to be too great for them to bear' ('Official Papers', 1.144-5). This got him in trouble with the clergy and with the British authorities. He also failed the direction of the Board of Trade to separate the office of speaker of the house of burgesses from that of treasurer -- offices that were held by John Robinson, Virginia's most powerful political figure. To do so would, he argued, 'throw the Country into a Flame' (ibid., 1.204-5) and prevent him from gaining the necessary support for the war. Fauquier survived these problems, but relations between Britain and her colonies worsened, a situation that was fuelled by the passage of the 'Stamp Act' in 1765. Repeal of the act a year later did not lessen discontent, and his desire to see relations improve was not fulfilled during his tenure. 
Fauquier was a cultured gentleman of liberal persuasion with wide-ranging intellectual interests. Selected Virginians whom he involved in these pursuits included George Wythe, William Small, professor of natural philosophy at the College of William and Mary, and a young student, Thomas Jefferson. He frequently invited this group to dinner, where Jefferson later said he heard 'More good sense, more rational and philosophical conversations' than at any time in his life (Malone, 1.73). A devoted musician, Fauquier also included Jefferson and Wythe in a chamber music group. To elite Virginians he 'personified the best elements of the English gentry tradition and culture' (Hood, 285). 
Fauquier had been periodically ill from early in his administration, and in February 1768 he became gravely so. He died at Williamsburg on 3 March 1768, and was buried on 8 March in the 'north aisle of Bruton parish church in Williamsburg' ('Official Papers', 1.xxxviii). The funeral address described Fauquier's administration as having been conducted with a 'fair and even hand between the Prerogative & Authority of our Mother Country, & the Rights & Priviledges of America' (ibid., 1.xxxix).

Faussett, Bryan (1720-1776), antiquary, was born on 30 October 1720 at Heppington, near Canterbury, the eldest of the thirteen children of Bryan Faussett (died 1750) and his wife, Mary (died 1761), daughter and sole heir of Henry Godfrey of Heppington and Lydd, Kent. After schooling in Kent, Faussett went up to University College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1742 and MA in 1745. He shared his father's Jacobite sympathies, and tried at Oxford to raise a force of volunteers to support the Young Pretender. Earlier, in 1742, he was rusticated for six months for entertaining a prostitute in his college rooms. When he applied for a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, as founder's kin, he was turned down on the ground that he was not a person of 'chaste and virtuous life'; but he appealed successfully to the college's visitor, the archbishop of Canterbury. He enjoyed the fellowship for two years, and then in 1748 was presented by All Souls to the Shropshire living of Alberbury. 
Faussett was later to declare: 'I went into Shropshire a stranger, and was caressed' ('Kentish Parson', 127). In his two years there he married in 1748 Elizabeth Curtois ('bap'. 1714), daughter of the Revd Rowland Curtois and his wife Elizabeth of Hainton, Lincolnshire, and saw their first son born, and, it seems, fitted happily into local society. In retrospect, he regretted reacting to his father's death in 1750 by returning to Kent. He lived at Street End House, near Heppington, and then, after his mother too had died, in 1761, he enjoyed full control of the family estates and occupied the house at Heppington. 
Despite his considerable wealth, Faussett was a disappointed, perhaps even embittered, man. He felt neglected by the gentry and higher clergy of east Kent. According to Dean Lynch he was 'never properly introduced' ('Kentish Parson', 127), and his friend Joseph Price wrote that Faussett 'does not agree long with anybody' (ibid., 128). He was curate at Kingston from 1750 until 1756, but it rankled that he had to wait until 1765 to obtain a benefice of his own: Archbishop Secker presented him that year to the rectory of Monks' Horton. Secker himself may later have regretted his kindness, especially when he was advised that Faussett was 'a man subject to passion, and to utter at such times very unclerical language' (Nichols, 'Lit. anecdotes', 9.355). Faussett did not reside there, but held the living until his death. 
Faussett at first used some of his leisure to engage in heraldic and genealogical research, and made careful notes of the monuments in nearly every church east of a line from Ashford to Faversham (though excluding Romney Marsh and Thanet); he also collected coins. In 1757, however, he walked one day with the rector of Crundale to Tremworth Down to look at the site of a Roman burial-ground which had been dug up fifty years earlier. The parish clerk remembered the location of these graves, and the expedition so aroused Faussett's curiosity that he was fired with an ever-growing passion for investigating ancient burials. Over the next sixteen years he was to be responsible for the opening of some 750 ancient burial-mounds and graves on and around the east Kent downs. 
Faussett never grasped that most of the graves were of the Anglo-Saxon period: he thought them to be of 'Romans Britonized' and 'Britons Romanized'. He could not identify post-Roman coins. But as an archaeological recorder he showed prescient skill in drawing up an extremely careful and precise narrative account, with a limited number of sketches, of all that he and his labourers found. Writing first in a field notebook and then preparing a fair copy for one of the series of journals that together formed what he called his 'Inventorium sepulchrale', he provided a remarkably consistent and full picture of the contents of each grave that was opened: not just the glass and occasional metal artefacts that he particularly valued, but all the other grave goods, bones, and coffin parts that survived. His ability to age and sex skeletons and his awareness of details such as tooth wear and tooth loss, with reabsorption of sockets, as factors in the ageing process, suggest that he had studied anatomy when at Oxford. 
Faussett continued to have barrows dug up even when he was so afflicted by gout that he had to watch and direct operations from his coach. It was in such circumstances that he gained from grave 205 on Kingston Down, in August 1771, his greatest prize, the largest Kentish jewelled gold composite disc-brooch ever discovered. Overall, his collection contained about 400 jewelled pieces, and until the discovery of the Sutton Hoo treasure it was the finest array of Anglo-Saxon antiquities in the country. 
Faussett died at Heppington on 10 February 1776 and was buried in Nackington church. He and his wife had had four children; their elder son, Henry Godfrey, had helped Faussett in his excavations and was the actual discoverer of the Kingston brooch. The collection long remained the property of the family, almost unknown to scholars until the 1840s. Faussett's great-grandson Bryan Faussett sold 5000 coins at Sothebys on 3 December 1853; the British Museum declined to buy the Anglo-Saxon antiquities and in 1855 these were purchased by Joseph Mayer, whose collections were later given to the Liverpool Museum. Mayer arranged for the 'Inventorium sepulchrale' to be edited by Charles Roach Smith in 1856. 
Faussett had decorated a garden pavilion at Heppington with some larger antiquities, including a terracotta relief from Roman London, a font bowl from Kingston church, and what he called King Canute: a late twelfth-century head of a biblical prophet from Canterbury Cathedral. When the pavilion was demolished in 1950, most of its contents were given to the Canterbury Museum. His library and some of his papers were dispersed onto the market around 1990.

Faussett, Thomas Godfrey Godfrey- (1829-1877), antiquary, was born in Oxford, the sixth son of the Revd Dr Godfrey Faussett (died 1853), professor of divinity at Oxford, from 1827 to 1853, prebendary of Worcester in 1827, and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and his second wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Wethered of Marlow. He spent most of his childhood in Worcester. He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1848 and graduated BA in 1851. He proceeded MA in 1854, and from 1857 to 1864 was a fellow of the college. He was called to the bar in January 1863 at Lincoln's Inn, where he specialized in conveyancing. In 1864 he married Lucy Jane, daughter of Henry Woodcock of Bank House, near Wigan. In 1869 with other members of his family, he took the surname Godfrey-Faussett. 
Godfrey-Faussett was a great-grandson of the Kentish antiquary Bryan Faussett, whose house at Heppington had remained in the family, and he clearly felt a strong attachment to Kent. He became a member of the Archaeological Institute, was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in March 1859, and around the same time, shortly after its foundation in 1857, became a member of council of the Kent Archaeological Society. He was honorary secretary of the Kent Archaeological Society from 1863 to 1873, when he was elected a vice-president, and was also on its editorial committee. 
Godfrey-Faussett contributed the occasional article to the Archaeological Institute's 'Archaeological Journal', most notably 'On the present state of the law of treasure-trove' (vol. 22, 1865) and 'Canterbury till Domesday' (vol. 32, 1875). 'The Saxon cemetery at Bifrons', an account of an important excavation (vol. 10, 1876; concluded after his death in vol. 13, 1880), was his principal contribution to 'Archaeologia Cantiana', the journal of the Kent Archaeological Society. He wrote a new four-column article on 'Canterbury' for the 9th edition of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica', as well as penning numerous epigrams and squibs, in Latin and English, which amused his many friends and occasionally appeared in print. He is also credited with a number of miscellaneous articles, including the Latin translations of several well-known hymns, in 'Fraser's Magazine', the 'Contemporary Review', the 'Saturday Review', and the 'Latin Year'. 
After being appointed auditor to the dean and chapter of Canterbury Cathedral in 1866, Faussett moved from London to a house in the cathedral precincts. In 1871 he became district registrar of the probate court at Canterbury also, and continued to hold both posts until his death. For the last ten years of his life he suffered from a debilitating disease, and after 1873 held a pen only for the purpose of a signature. He died at his home on 26 February 1877, survived by his wife and an only child, Edward Godfrey, born in 1868. He was buried on 2 March at Nackington, Kent, and is commemorated by a stained-glass window in the chancel of Adisham church, in the 1869 restoration of which he had taken a keen interest. Although held back by ill health from making a greater contribution to Kentish history, Godfrey-Faussett nevertheless strove to perpetuate a family tradition, and wrote a lively memoir of his great-grandfather; this was printed in an appendix to Bryan Faussett's 'Inventorium sepulchrale', edited by Charles Roach Smith, which appeared in 1861.

Favour, John (c.1557-1624), Church of England clergyman, was born at Southampton and attended Winchester College before matriculating as a scholar of New College, Oxford, in 1576. He was elected a fellow in 1578 and graduated BCL in 1584 and DCL in 1592. In January 1594 Favour was instituted to the crown living of Halifax at the suggestion of Henry, earl of Huntingdon, who saw the town as a potentially important base for the spread of committed protestant views in an otherwise inhospitable region. Favour transformed the religious life of the area during his thirty years as vicar and Halifax became the base for a ministry which operated throughout the diocese. His puritan views did not find immediate support in the town, however, and a comprehensive, and never to be repeated, presentment was made against his puritan innovations at the visitation of 1596. Thereafter the vicar seems to have won over his more significant parishioners and the place became noted for the consistent implementation of godly discipline on the laity through presentments at visitation. Favour also achieved standing among like-minded clergy, and through the preaching exercise set up in the town in the early seventeenth century, as well as the use of the patronage which he had, as vicar, over the chapelries of the parish, Halifax became the centre for moderate puritan activity in the county. 
Favour described his ministry as 'preaching every Sabbath day, lecturing every day in the weeke, exercising iustice in the Commonwealth, practising of Physicke and Chirurgerie' (Favour, dedication), and his pastoral abilities contributed greatly to a reputation which he turned to practical effect by reviving the charitable impulses of the community. He breathed new life into the project to found a new grammar school at Heath, for which he elicited grants totalling more than $700 by 1623 from parishioners or worthies connected with the town, and he also secured financial support for decayed chapelries; Raistrick in 1602, Ripponden in 1610, Cross Stone in 1616, Sowerby in 1622, and Luddenden in 1624 were either reopened or enlarged in his time and others followed soon after. Clergy were appointed and sermons endowed, and ministers in trouble with the diocesan authorities could expect support from the vicar. 
This was due in part to the support which Favour himself received from the archbishop, Tobie Matthew, whose chaplain he was. Favour had been made a canon of Southwell in 1611 and of York Minster in 1614, being appointed precentor of York in 1617. He was also a magistrate for the West Riding and member of the high commission at York, becoming a regular attender at meetings from 1616. His wider ministry involved the writing of a defence of the English church against Rome which he published in 1619 in a lengthy tome as 'Antiquitie Triumphing over Noveltie', having been encouraged in the endeavour by Archbishop Matthew, who gave him access to his extensive library during its composition and to whom the work was dedicated. The volume is noted more for its earnestness than its combativeness. 
Favour had married Ann Power, probably the daughter of William Power, rector of Barwick in Elmet, in 1595, and in his later years was something of a patriarch among a group of younger, largely Cambridge-educated, puritan ministers working in the area. He remained close to Archbishop Matthew, and to Matthew's wife throughout his life, remembering both of them in his will, to which Alexander Cooke, vicar of Leeds, was a witness. He died in Halifax on 10 March 1624 and was buried in the chancel of Halifax church, where there is a monument to him at the west end, showing him in preaching mode. He was survived by his wife. He left a community whose attachment to puritan ideals and the dissenting tradition was to remain strong throughout the changes of the century following his death.

Fawcett, Benjamin (1715-1780), Presbyterian minister, was born on 16 August 1715 at Sleaford, Lincolnshire, the youngest of ten children. He was educated at home, then in 1738 he went to Philip Doddridge's academy at Northampton. While he was there, Bryan Connell, a Roman Catholic, was found guilty of murder. Doddridge sent Fawcett to Chester to find an alibi for Connell, but in vain. Connell was hanged in 1741. When Thomas Steffe, Samuel Stodden's assistant at Pauls Meeting, Taunton, another pupil of Doddridge, died of smallpox, Stodden asked Doddridge to suggest a replacement. In February 1741 Fawcett was invited, and had arrived by June. A year later, on 16 June 1742, he was ordained in a crowded church including forty ministers, and Doddridge preached. Doddridge wrote to his wife saying Fawcett's future wife was 'a genteel agreeable girl about 23 and will have a good $1,400' (14 June 1742, Nuttall, 150, no. 754). On 29 July 1742 Fawcett married Sarah Knight (1719/20-1774), who worshipped with her family at Pauls Meeting. 
Fawcett was friendly with Risdon Darracott, minister at Wellington and another Doddridge pupil. They both sympathized with George Whitefield, which brought the criticism of other ministers; this criticism reflected on Doddridge, who supported them. The three of them corresponded throughout their lives. In 1744 Fawcett wanted his own church, and in August he visited the church in Kidderminster to preach. Fawcett was given a unanimous call to the ministry on 17 March 1745. The Taunton church was upset and wrote to Doddridge 'at present wee are a very unhappy people' (Nuttall, no. 1050). Fawcett revived the congregation at Kidderminster by visiting every church family, questioning them about their faith, and by attending all the church organizations; he divided the children into groups and catechized monthly. Doddridge visited Fawcett at Kidderminster, finding 'He has upward of 300 catechumens of all ages, has received 60 communicants into church within a year and a half' (ibid., no. 1209). Fawcett was so successful that in 1754 a larger church was built at a cost of $1000. For the next twenty-five years he preached to a full church, three times on Sundays and once in the week. He seldom rose after 5 a.m., to which he attributed his good health. 
Darracott died on 14 March 1759 and Fawcett preached his funeral sermon at Wellington. In 1771 Fawcett published a funeral sermon for Francis Best, a church trustee, with a detailed narrative of his murder, as well as over twenty other items, including an abridgement of Baxter's 'Everlasting Rest' in 1759. In 1777 he published 'Candid Reflections on the Different Modes of Explaining the Trinity', which was meant to heal, but there were suspicions that he had Unitarian sympathies. Some in his congregation, who were doctrinally more heterodox, objected to Fawcett's successor, John Barrett, and opened their own church in 1782, the New Meeting. 
The Fawcetts had four sons and four daughters: Sarah was born in Taunton and the others in Kidderminster. Their mother died on 11 February 1774, aged fifty-four, and Fawcett married on 27 February 1775 Hannah Short (died 1786). Fawcett died at Kidderminster on 18 October 1780 and was buried in St Mary's old churchyard on 23 October. 'His two sons, brother and nephew were mourners' ('Practical Works of Job Orton', 2.629). The funeral sermon was preached by Thomas Taylor, a native of Kidderminster, friend of Fawcett, and minister of Carter Lane, London. 
Fawcett's son Samuel, born on 15 June 1751, trained at Daventry Academy and was ordained at Beaminster on 26 June 1776. He was invited by the members of New Meeting, Kidderminster, to become their minister, but he declined. In 1801 he became minister of the reopened Unitarian church at Yeovil until 1816. He died at Yeovil on 14 December 1835, aged eighty-four. Fawcett's church in Kidderminster became Baxter United Reformed Church in 1972, and Pauls Meeting, in the same year, became Taunton United Reformed Church.

Fawcett, Henry (1833-1884), economist and politician, was born on 26 August 1833 in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the third of four children of William Fawcett (1793-1887), a draper, and his wife, Mary Cooper (died 1889), the daughter of a local solicitor. Henry's brothers, William and Thomas, were born in 1828 and 1839; his sister, Sarah Maria, in 1830. His father, originally from Kirkby Lonsdale in Westmorland, had prospered in Salisbury, and in 1832 was Liberal mayor of the town. His mother's father had been the local agent for the whigs. In 1843, when Richard Cobden and John Bright campaigned in rural England against agricultural protection, they stayed with the Fawcetts, who had a farm at Longford, near Salisbury. Henry Fawcett's political Liberalism thus had firm roots in his family and upbringing. 
Fawcett was educated at local dame-schools and at Queenwood College, Hampshire, before being sent to King's College School, London, in 1849. His talent was for mathematics rather than classics. In October 1852 he entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, but migrated to Trinity Hall in the following year where he judged there would be less competition for a fellowship. A tall, thin figure at 6 feet 3 inches in height, long of limb and with a commanding physical presence, Fawcett was a keen sportsman and rower, and a notable figure among his contemporaries. He was disappointed to be classed seventh wrangler in the mathematical tripos in 1856, but it was enough to secure him election as a fellow of Trinity Hall that Christmas. He remained a fellow of the college until his death. In 1854 he had set out to win a place in parliament by a traditional route and had entered Lincoln's Inn. His career at the bar was cut short by a shooting accident on 17 September 1858 which left him totally and permanently blind. William Fawcett failed to see his son in advance of a shooting party, fired at some partridges, and sent two pellets through both of Henry's eyes. Fawcett later told a friend that he decided that very night that the loss of his sight would make no difference to his life (Strachey, 23) and he came to terms with his blindness remarkably quickly. It did not alter his taste for vigorous exercise, nor his plan to enter parliament. Rather, with the law now closed to him, he struck out on a more individual path, and a relatively new one at the time: to build a political career from an academic base by writing, speaking, and becoming widely known. In this strategy it would not be cynical to conclude that blindness was no disadvantage: it brought him attention, it made audiences more ready to listen, and it forced Fawcett to develop talents of concentration, organization, and memory that made him highly effective as a writer, speaker, and debater. Yet there was inevitable sadness and handicap in his life. He was dependent on his friends and secretaries; he was always asking for descriptions of his wife's face and dress; his capability in professional and public life was sometimes doubted, though he proved equal to any challenge; and blindness was used as the convenient excuse for his exclusion from the cabinet in 1880, for it was held that his reliance on secretaries would breach cabinet confidentiality. Fawcett was the best-known blind person in British public life. He advanced the cause of blind people by advocating a royal commission on the blind in 1883, supported by Gladstone but not established until 1885, after Fawcett's death (Gladstone, 28 Aug 1883). 
Fawcett returned to Cambridge early in 1859. It was at this stage that his friendship with Leslie Stephen deepened, for Stephen, also a fellow of Trinity Hall, showed great solicitude and loyalty towards Fawcett. The friendship endured, though by the 1870s the two were far apart spiritually: Stephen could not tolerate Fawcett's forthright opinions, set out with characteristic stridency, and his biography of Fawcett, written at the request of Millicent Garrett Fawcett and published in 1885, reflects some reserve on Stephen's part. In an age of change in the ancient universities, Fawcett was in the party of university liberals seeking to open Cambridge to all sects and classes, and build a new academic profession based on merit. As befitted a radical Liberal, Fawcett believed in open competition in all things. He began to make himself known in public, addressing the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1859 and 1861 and the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (known as the Social Science Association) in 1859 and 1860. Fawcett made a great impression at the latter, coming to the notice of its president, Lord Brougham. His academic interests, meanwhile, were turning to political economy. In 1861 he was elected to membership of the Political Economy Club, and that autumn he began work on his 'Manual of Political Economy' which was published early in 1863. The timing was opportune, for the Cambridge chair of political economy became vacant that summer. In an exciting university contest, Fawcett was narrowly elected in November 1863, beating one of his later friends and political allies, Leonard Courtney. As professor of political economy, Fawcett secured prestige and doubled his salary to $600 a year. As the subject then attracted few undergraduates of quality, and was not central to the curriculum, Fawcett had little difficulty lecturing in Cambridge and pursuing a political career in London. 
Fawcett's 'Manual' was a successful textbook, running to eight editions, the last published in 1907. It was modelled on John Stuart Mill's 'Principles of Political Economy', presenting the orthodox economic doctrines of the age, to which Fawcett subscribed, in an uncomplicated style, and filling them out with illustrations based on contemporary economic life. Fawcett made no significant theoretical contribution to economics; rather, he was a gifted popularizer, interested in questions of policy, and in the application of principles to actual economic life. In Fawcett's view, 'the leading principles of political economy and those which were really valuable, were few, simple, and therefore capable of exposition on the level of average intelligence' (Stephen, 'Life of Henry Fawcett', 124). His published lectures and articles, generally dealing with prominent economic issues of the moment, such as 'Pauperism: its Causes and Remedies' (1871), 'Free Trade and Protection' (1878), and 'State Socialism and the Nationalisation of the Land' (1883), probably provide a better indication of his interests and strengths as an economist than the 'Manual'. At a time when the place of organized labour in British society was at the centre of political debate, Fawcett made the labour question his special study, publishing 'The Economic Position of the British Labourer' in 1865. He examined strikes and the processes of wage bargaining, and recommended forms of industrial co-operation between employers and workers, including co-partnerships and profit sharing, to build amicable relations between them, and to increase both profits and wages. In the 1860s he emerged as one of a group of intellectual and political 'friends of labour', adopting a sympathetic approach to trade unions and their request for legal and social acceptance, though unlike many of his contemporaries, and unlike Mill in particular, he continued to believe in the classical wage fund doctrine with its intrinsic limitations on the efficacy of trade union action. Fawcett was one of the last of the amateurs among political economists: he combined his academic vocation with political life and other social causes; his researches were very limited after the initial stages of his career; he remained loyal to ideas he had learned as a young man; and he showed no interest in, or understanding of, the theoretical developments of the 1870s and 1880s that heralded marginalism and the neo-classical synthesis. He may be contrasted with his highly professional and academic successor as professor of political economy in Cambridge, Alfred Marshall. 
Around the time of his election to the Cambridge chair, Fawcett was also fighting parliamentary elections. In 1860, unknown and with only a letter of recommendation from Brougham to commend him to the Liberals of Southwark, he presented himself for selection as a candidate there in a by-election. He was not chosen by the local constituency organization, but his audacity drew the attention of the press. In 1863 he came close to election for the city of Cambridge. In 1864 he finished second in a field of four candidates at Brighton. And at the general election of July 1865 he was elected for that constituency. He represented Brighton until defeated in the general election of February 1874, when he was immediately nominated and elected for the safe Liberal seat of Hackney, which he represented until his death. 
In parliament, Fawcett was classed as an 'advanced Liberal' and was noted for his initial co-operation with John Stuart Mill, also elected in 1865. Like many of his generation in the English universities, Fawcett was strongly influenced by Mill, and brought himself to Mill's attention in letters dating from 1859. He not only subscribed to Mill's political economy, but shared Mill's enthusiasm for feminism, and for Thomas Hare's proposals for electoral reform, under which the whole electorate was to be organized as a single constituency, and candidates elected by securing a pre-designated quota of votes. Fawcett seconded Mill's amendment to the second 'Reform Bill' in May 1867 that would have extended the franchise to women. Mill was never intimate with Fawcett, but saw him as an ally and referred to him as 'one of the successors' ('Collected Works', 15.686). Fawcett's interest in women's causes, meanwhile, seems to have drawn him to seek a marriage partner from among the ranks of mid-Victorian feminists. In 1859 he proposed unsuccessfully to Bessie Rayner Parkes, the editor of the 'English Woman's Journal'. In 1865 his proposal to Elizabeth Garrett, later Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first female physician to train and practise in Britain, and the daughter of Newson Garrett, merchant and shipowner from Aldeburgh, Suffolk, was also declined. In between, in the autumn of 1864, he was briefly engaged to Eleanor Eden, daughter of the bishop of Bath and Wells. But in October 1866 Fawcett became engaged to Millicent Garrett (1847-1929) ['see 'Fawcett, Dame Millicent Garrett], one of Elizabeth's younger sisters, and they were married on St George's day 1867. The couple had met at a party in London in May 1865 and it is said that Fawcett was initially attracted by the sweet voice of a young lady expressing her dismay at the recent assassination of President Lincoln. There is evidence that Fawcett's difficulties in finding a wife were related to concerns about the prospects of a blind man with a relatively modest income. There were initial objections to the marriage of Millicent and Henry from the Garretts, though it was an entirely happy union, and one of the most celebrated marital partnerships of the era. 
Millicent was at first Fawcett's secretary; she was always his intellectual companion. In 1872 they published together a collection of their articles entitled 'Essays and Lectures on Social and Political Subjects'. In time, Millicent played a leading role in the campaign for women's suffrage, and became a public figure in her own right. The couple maintained two households in Lambeth and in Cambridge. In 1868 their only child, Philippa Fawcett, was born. As a student at Newnham College, Cambridge, which her parents had helped to establish, Philippa Fawcett excelled in the mathematical tripos of 1890 and was unofficially placed ahead of that year's senior wrangler, though women were not officially classed at this time. It was a familial triumph, and a famous coup for the women's movement. Fawcett's feminism antedated his marriage and grew out of his general political liberalism: women were one of several groups in mid-Victorian Britain whom he believed to be unjustifiably denied full participation in civic and political life. But Millicent's views influenced him: he had initially favoured the special protection by legislation of employed women, but by the 1870s was advocating the view prevalent in the women's movement that such regulation limited opportunities for them. The threat of competition from cheaper female workers was opposed by the Trades Union Congress, and Fawcett found that his feminism had compromised his position as an advocate of organized labour; his relations with the trade union movement suffered accordingly. 
As a Liberal MP, Fawcett always championed merit over birth. He opposed abuses of government patronage; he sought to remove inconsistencies in public administration. He was a member of a Cambridge dining circle, the Republican Club, which professed opposition to the 'hereditary principle' and when this came to the attention of the electors of Brighton in 1871, he was forced to explain himself before them. He opposed 'over-legislation' and put his faith in individual self-reliance using the conventional arguments of this period that individuals are best able to judge their interests for themselves, and that too much state intervention undermines individual initiative, the mainspring of social development. This strict adherence to 'laissez-faire' may suggest insensitivity in a man who might have known from his own experience that fate can be capricious, and that people may fail to thrive through no fault of their own. But like many Liberals of this period, Fawcett recognized elementary education as an exception to his general rule, and was an advocate of state involvement in its provision. Yet unlike those of many Liberals, Fawcett's politics owed nothing to religion. He never talked of his faith, and seems to have been a non-believer with little tolerance for matters of conscience or denomination, hence his frustration not only with Anglican exclusivism in the state and universities, but with the sectarianism of the many nonconformists in his own party. Fawcett was an early example of a secular radical. By the end of the 1860s he had emerged at the head of a group of maverick Liberal MPs sometimes referred to as 'Fawcettites', and notable for their university background, radical individualism, and independence of party managers. They included Charles Dilke, Auberon Herbert, Walter Morrison, and Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice. 
Fawcett had been a keen admirer of Gladstone as chancellor of the exchequer in the early 1860s, and expected much from the Liberal administration he formed at the end of 1868. But Gladstone's caution, combined with tenderness for his own and others' religious scruples, disappointed Fawcett. He criticized the administration from the back benches in an attempt to force it on to radical deeds. He took issue with excessive government expenditure; with the 1870 'Elementary Education Act' which failed to end denominational grievances and enforce compulsory school attendance; with the compensation paid to Irish landowners under the Irish disestablishment settlement in 1869; with the delay in abolishing university tests which debarred nonconformists and atheists from fellowships in the universities. His article in the 'Fortnightly Review' in November 1871 entitled 'The present position of the government' summarized his objections and expressed Fawcett's fundamental criticism that the administration lacked confidence in Liberal principles and was failing to educate the nation in the case for reform: Gladstone was following rather than shaping public opinion. 
Fawcett's opposition to the ministry led to withdrawal of the whip in 1871. But the strength of his case was to result in the administration's defeat in March 1873 over the question of Irish university reform. Fawcett had introduced several bills to abolish the remaining religious tests in English universities before the administration legislated on the question in 1871. From 1867 he had been campaigning to have the tests abolished at Trinity College, Dublin, as well. Early in 1873 the government introduced a bill drafted by Gladstone himself. Whereas Fawcett merely sought to remove the tests at Trinity that restricted fellowships and scholarships to Anglicans, Gladstone's bill was more ambitious: it sought to construct a federal university in Ireland to which denominational colleges would affiliate, but to minimize friction between the sects there were to be no chairs or university examinations in the controversial subjects of theology, philosophy, and modern history. This was anathema to Fawcett, whose Liberal principles led him to favour a single university, without denominational distinctions, and without restraints on free expression and intellectual enquiry. In Fawcett's view, Gladstone was more concerned to appease religious intolerance and obscurantism than to enshrine the historic tenets of Liberalism. In his most effective and significant parliamentary speech on 3 March 1873, he pulled the bill apart and led a group of forty-three Liberals, largely composed of radicals and Irish members, to vote against their party. With Liberal abstentions in addition, the bill was lost by 287 to 284. After the Liberal electoral defeat in the following year, Gladstone was to complain to his brother of 'a class of independent liberals... who have been one of the main causes of the weakness of the government... We have never recovered from the blow which they helped to strike on the Irish Education bill' (Gladstone MSS, BL, Add. MS. 44762, fol. 37). 
During the years of opposition which followed, Fawcett was able to repair his relations with his party. He took a leading role in the early stages of the agitation over the Bulgarian atrocities of 1876, and found it easy to fall in behind Gladstone's criticism of the morality of Conservative foreign policy. He also took up issues that did not cause conflict with other Liberals. One, the preservation of common land from transfer to private ownership, was a favourite radical cause in the 1870s, and Fawcett, as a member of the Commons Preservation Society, was able to lambast the landowning class who sought to deprive the people of access to the remaining commons of England: in particular he helped to save Epping Forest and the New Forest as open spaces. Fawcett's other concern -- the administration of British India -- was his own independent interest. He never visited India, nor learned much about its culture and history. But noting that Indian affairs excited little interest in parliament, Fawcett was determined that in line with Liberal principles as they applied to domestic affairs, the government of India should be efficient, cheap, and fair to the native population. He became known as the 'Member for India', scrutinizing policy, suggesting improvements, and enjoining colleagues to take imperial administration seriously. In Fawcett's view, a well-run empire was justifiable and defensible. A generation later such an attitude was common; in the 1870s Fawcett was a lone but increasingly influential voice. Though he did not live to see Gladstone's introduction of the 'Home Rule Bill' in 1886, he was opposed to any measure of independence for Ireland. 
Fawcett's temperament was best suited to opposition and the pursuit of unfashionable causes. But he accepted office outside the cabinet as postmaster-general when Gladstone formed his second administration in May 1880. He was joined in junior ministerial positions by the other radicals, Dilke and Joseph Chamberlain, in what was probably a deliberate ploy to limit their potential to damage the government. As postmaster, Fawcett was conscientious, successful, and popular. He introduced the parcel post; reduced the cost of telegrams and postal orders; improved facilities for small savers and investors in the Post Office Savings Bank; and opened a number of positions in the Post Office to women. But he had his differences with the administration, none the less. He strongly opposed the poorly kept secret of the early 1880s that the letters of Irish MPs were being opened as they passed through the Post Office. He abstained in July 1883 when the government proposed charging the cost of Indian soldiers garrisoned in Egypt on Indian funds. In the following year he abstained again when instructed to vote down William Woodall's amendment to the third 'Reform Bill' which would have enfranchised women. For this he incurred the prime minister's censure, though his resignation was not requested. 
Yet resignation was in Fawcett's mind. He was antagonized by Gladstone's policies and high-handed methods, and frustrated by his enforced silence as a minister. There is evidence that he contemplated leaving the administration on the pretext that the 'Reform Bill' did not include measures for the reform of voting: his last public address in October 1884 in the Shoreditch Town Hall restated his devotion to Hare's scheme. But his plans were cut short by untimely death. A cold developed into pneumonia with coronary complications, and Fawcett died at his Cambridge home, 18 Brookside, after a brief illness, on 6 November 1884. He was buried in Trumpington churchyard on 10 November 1884. Something approaching national mourning followed, for Fawcett was said to have been the most popular man in England after Gladstone. There were tributes in parliament, the press, from the queen (who had followed his final illness with mounting concern), and from many of her subjects. 
Fawcett was much honoured towards the end of his life. He was elected FRS in 1882 and lord rector of Glasgow University in 1883; he received an honorary DCL from Oxford in 1880, and was made a corresponding member of the Institut de France in 1884. Despite his independence, he was also a representative figure. His career was coextensive with the Liberal Party in its heyday, and his attitudes were shared, to a considerable extent, by a group of academic Liberals who entered politics in the 1860s from a base in the reformed universities. If Fawcett's strict adherence to the principles of classical economics owed much to the spirit of the early Victorians, his feminism and secularism point forward to a later age. His success in securing a place within an essentially landed and monied political culture on the basis of an academic position and frequent presentation of his opinions in public, make him a pioneer of an increasingly common model in British politics. He was one of the first to realize the full implications of the popularization of politics in mid-Victorian Britain and turn these to his advantage. But for his contemporaries, it was the triumph over handicap of the first blind man who, it was believed, had ever been elected to parliament, which was Fawcett's greatest achievement. His life was understood to exemplify virtues like courage, fortitude, and optimism, and was presented as an inspiration for others. Leslie Stephen's inscription on the memorial to Fawcett in the chapel of St George in Westminster Abbey, set up by national subscription, thus paid tribute to 'a memorable example of the power of a brave man to transmute evil into good and to wrest victory from misfortune'.

Fawcett, James (1751-1831), Church of England clergyman and university teacher, was born in Leeds, and baptized at St Peter's on 4 July 1751, the son of Richard Fawcett (1703/4-1783), vicar of St John's, Leeds (1768-83). Suffering from rickets, he had a weakly constitution from an early age. Having been educated at Leeds grammar school, he matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, at Michaelmas 1770, under John Chevallier. In January 1774 he graduated BA, as fifth senior optime, and won the first members' prize, while a senior bachelor, in 1776. In 1777 he took his MA degree, and during the same year he was elected fellow of his college on the foundation of Sir Marmaduke Constable. 
Ordained deacon on 11 June 1775 and priest on 15 December 1776 Fawcett was appointed curate at his father's church in Leeds in 1776. He was Lady Margaret preacher in Cambridge from 1786 to 1819 and published his sermons in 1794. From 1791 to 1822 he also served as vicar of St Sepulchre's (or the Round Church), Cambridge. In 1785 he proceeded BD, and in 1795 he was chosen Norrisian professor of divinity. Although his sermons were praised as models of composition and orthodoxy he failed to draw large congregations. He was rendered ineffective as a lecturer to divinity students by: 'A certain thickness in his speech, an awkwardness of manner in a crowd, a want of energy, and an easiness of temper, little calculated to curb the sallies of a large assembly of young men constrained to sit out a lecture of an hour in length. (Hughes, viii-ix)' Fawcett chiefly lived in St John's until presented by the college in 1801 to the united rectories of Thursford and Great Snoring in Norfolk. He then divided his time between his parsonage and the university, being permitted to retain rooms in college on account of his lectures. In 1815 he vacated the Norrisian professorship in the vain hope of gaining the more lucrative Lady Margaret professorship. In 1822 he also resigned his vicarage in Cambridge and retired to his rectory in Norfolk. Unmarried, he died at Great Snoring on 10 April 1831, aged seventy-nine.

John Fawcett (d. 1793), who came from High Wycombe. Fawcett senior was a pupil of Thomas Arne, and appeared at Drury Lane on 23 September 1760 as Filch in 'The Beggar's Opera'. He subsequently played minor parts at that theatre, at Covent Garden, and in Dublin, and died on 9 October 1793. He was described as being 'of more utility than note'. When he was eight years old the younger Fawcett attracted the attention of Garrick, then on the point of quitting the stage, and conceived a hope of becoming an actor. To check this idea his father bound the boy, who had entered St Paul's School on 6 February 1776, as an apprentice to a linen draper in the City. When eighteen years of age Fawcett ran away to Margate, and under the name of Foote appeared as Courtall in Hannah Cowley's 'The Belle's Stratagem'. From there he went under his own name to Tunbridge Wells. Recommended by Cumberland he joined Tate Wilkinson's company, and appeared at York as Young Norval on 24 May 1787. For some time he played Romeo, Oroonoko, and similar parts. Wilkinson, however, perceiving that tragedy was not his forte, with some difficulty induced him to attempt Jemmy Jumps in John O'Keeffe's musical farce 'The Farmer'. Fawcett's success in this was so great that he elected subsequently to play in low comedy.
