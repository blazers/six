Maclean, Patrick (fl. 1538-1565), Roman Catholic bishop-elect of the Isles, was the illegitimate son of Lachlan Cattanach Maclean (c.1465-1523) and an unidentified Katherine Hay. Several times referred to as 'brother germane to Lord Maclane' ('LP Henry VIII', 20/2, no. 4), that is, to Hector Maclean of Duart, he owed his influence to his relationship to that formidable chief. Nothing is known of his early life, but as he is invariably described as Master Patrick he was evidently a university graduate. He may have been the 'Dom Patrick Mauchlyne, chaplain' who received $5 from the revenues of Haddington in 1531, and for several years thereafter ('Exchequer Rolls 1529-1536', 59), but his first certain appearance in the records comes in 1538, when he accounted at the exchequer for crown revenues from the Isles received by his brother. By 1545 he was bailie of Iona and justice clerk of the South Isles. 
In 1544 Donald Dubh, the last MacDonald lord of the Isles, escaped from prison and fled to his homeland. The islanders under Duart's leadership rose in revolt, at a time when Henry VIII was making strenuous efforts, abetted by the fourth earl of Lennox, to force the Scots to break their alliance with France and marry their infant queen Mary to Prince Edward of England. In a politically confused situation Donald saw advantage in an alliance with Lennox and England, and employed Patrick Maclean as one of his agents. In March 1545, having already been with Lennox, Maclean proceeded to Westminster, from where the privy council soon sent him back to Donald with promises of money. The result was that on 28 July, 'with the advice of his barons and council of the Isles' (among whom Duart was named first), Donald made Maclean one of his commissioners to negotiate an alliance with the English king. An essential component in any agreement was Donald's ability to raise fighting men in Ireland, and to expedite this Maclean visited Dublin in mid-August, but was back at Westminster by the 23rd. On 5 September the privy council reported that articles had been agreed whereby the English would pay the wages of 3000 of Donald's men and assist him with a further 2000 men under the command of the ninth earl of Ormond. 
Donald Dubh died at the end of 1545 and the uprising collapsed. It has been argued that it was also betrayed by Duart, who was certainly in favour with the pro-French Scottish party later in 1546. Patrick Maclean was in Ireland in February 1546, endeavouring to revive the islemen's alliance with England, but he too subsequently made his peace with the Scottish government, for on 7 August, following the death of Bishop Farquhar MacEachan, he received 'the temporalite of all landis... quhilkis [were] pertinentis of the bischoprik of the Iles and abbacy of Colmkill' ('Registrum secreti sigilli', 3, no. 2367). 
For nearly twenty years there was confusion in the sequence of bishops of the Isles. Maclean was not without rivals, and, indeed, neither then nor later was he formally made bishop, but was styled only bishop-elect. He seems to have claimed papal provision, but in 1551 one Roderick Maclean began an action to deprive Patrick of the abbey of Iona, perhaps all he actually held, and a year later the lords of council ordered him to hand the abbey over, on the grounds that he had failed to demonstrate his provision. Roderick Maclean was dead by 26 November 1553, to be succeeded by Alexander Gordon, but again without confirmation. One John Campbell was referred to as bishop-elect in 1560, but Patrick Maclean once more obtained crown nomination to the see, and on 22 April 1562 Gordon resigned to him his rights in Iona. Maclean's second tenure of Iona and the Isles was short-lived, however. On 12 January 1565, still only 'elect of the Iles', he acknowledged 'the impotence of his awne bodie' and resigned all his rights to John Carswell, an active reformer supported by the fifth earl of Argyll. Carswell promised him 'ane yeirlie pensioun for his intertenement' ('Registrum secreti sigilli', 5, no. 1885). No further reference to Maclean survives, and he probably died soon afterwards.

James V, mistresses and children of (act. c.1529-1592) constitute a notable extension of personality on the part of an early modern British ruler. James V (1512-1542) had nine known illegitimate children, all born to different mothers. The dates and order of their births are not fully known. Of the two females, 
Of the king's sons, 
Whatever the homely reputation of the 'guidman of Ballengeich', James V's known paramours were all drawn from the nobility and lairdly class. Only one, 
In their earliest years the children remained at court with their mothers. The four eldest boys -- the two surviving Jameses, John, and Robert [i] -- then went to school in St Andrews, and James [ii] and John later matriculated at the university. All accompanied the young Queen Mary to France in 1548 and the two university students continued their studies there under the philosopher Pierre Ramus. After returning to Scotland, John, James [ii], and Robert became involved in politics and public affairs and all attended their half-sister during her troubled personal rule. Jean too was a close companion, preferring the court to her husband's domains in the west of Scotland, a fact which put a fatal strain on her marriage. She was present when the queen's secretary David Rizzio was murdered on 9 March 1566. 
Neither Jean nor Margaret had children, and all but Robert, earl of Orkney, died comparatively young and produced few descendants. John, Lord Darnley, had one son, Francis Stewart (1562-1612), who succeeded him as prior of Coldingham and ultimately became the 'madcap' earl of Bothwell. James, earl of Moray, had three daughters, only one of whom had issue, though she was the progenitrix of the continuing Moray line. Adam Stewart died in 1575 in Orkney; his widow is said to have been 'gritlie burdynnit with mony bairnis' ('Registrum secreti sigilli', 1575-80, no. 1003), though there is knowledge only of Barbara, who married into the Orcadian Halcro family and was responsible for her father's tombstone, carved with the royal arms, which may still be seen in St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall.

Octavians (act. 1596-1598), financial administrators, were eight reformers prominent in the government and politics of Scotland under James VI. On 9 January 1596 they were appointed as joint commissioners of a new permanent exchequer, with full powers over the collection and disbursement of royal revenues. Their appointment was for life and the king was to appoint no further members to the commission without their agreement; nor could he spend money without their prior approval. 
The Octavians, in the order in which their commission named them, were: Alexander Seton (1556-1622), commendator of Pluscarden, later first earl of Dunfermline; Walter Stewart (d. 1617), commendator of Blantyre, later first Lord Blantyre; David Carnegie of Colluthie (d. 1598), later laird of Kinnaird; John Lindsay of Menmuir (1552-1598), later laird of Balcarres; James Elphinstone of Invernochty (1557-1612), later laird of Barnton and first Lord Balmerino; Thomas Hamilton of Drumcairn (1563-1637), later Lord Binning, earl of Melrose and first earl of Haddington; John Skene of Curriehill (c.1540-1617); and Peter Young of Seton (1544-1628). 
The nucleus of the group had been formed in 1593, when six of the future Octavians (Elphinstone, Hamilton, Lindsay, Seton, Stewart, and Young) were appointed to constitute the queen's financial council. On 1 January 1596 Queen Anne presented her husband with a large purse of gold as a new year's gift, symbolizing her council's financial efficiency and legitimizing the promotion of its members. In February the English ambassador reported that four new councillors -- Elphinstone, Hamilton, Lindsay, and Seton -- had been promoted. But the group's identity, and the name of Octavians, was soon universally established. A later contemporary account added Stewart to the group's active members, implicitly characterizing the others as passive. However, these perceptions focused on those who were most prominent as politicians, and the Octavians were not simply politicians. Part of their team's strength lay in its diverse membership, with each person making a distinctive contribution. Together they had social status and connections, political acumen, legal training, and financial expertise. 
The three Octavians regarded as passive illustrate the point. Skene was a hard-working bureaucrat, whose assiduous researches into the government records in his care seem to have been behind some of the Octavians' attempts to reassert royal rights. Carnegie's particular area of expertise was finance -- he had long experience as an auditor of exchequer and of other financial commissions, and had personally speculated in government debts. Young's skills were in humanist learning and diplomacy. Three Octavians -- Elphinstone, Seton, and Lindsay -- were younger sons of peers, and two were closely connected to the king personally: Young had been the king's tutor (along with George Buchanan) between 1569 and 1580, while Stewart had been one of the four youths whom he educated alongside the royal pupil. Young had since acted periodically as an ambassador and held the honorific post of royal almoner, and Stewart had become a gentleman of the king's chamber. All the members of the group except Stewart had university degrees; his lack of one presumably reflects his attachment to the court since his youth. 
All but two Octavians were judges in the court of session, which required legal expertise and usually significant formal training; the two exceptions, Carnegie and Young, also had some legal expertise. All were privy councillors, though they had not necessarily attended council meetings regularly. Two were already officers of state: Seton had been lord president of the court of session since 1593 and Skene had been clerk register since 1594. Stewart had been keeper of the privy seal, a lesser office, since 1582. All officers of state had lately been overshadowed by the chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane, but Maitland's death in September 1595, and James's decision to leave his office vacant, left a political gap which the Octavians moved astutely to fill. The team had no leader, though there was some initial jockeying for position between the two members of highest status, Seton and Stewart. Seton wanted to be president of the council, whereas Stewart wanted the keepership of the great seal. Each felt that such promotion would make them the recognized leader of the team. However, neither obtained his wish, and they evidently recognized the advantage of co-operation. 
The Octavians' sweeping powers attracted immediate attention, and critics denounced their effectiveness in cutting expenditure seen as necessary to the king's status. Their initial intention was merely to supervise and control the royal officials responsible for revenue administration. Soon the Octavians changed from supervising to take most financial and other offices for themselves. This may have increased their efficiency but it tarnished their disinterested public image. They pursued various policies in increasing revenue. They reformed the customs administration, and introduced wholly new customs on imports in May 1597. They put much effort into reviving the ancient dues from the crown lands. They helped to put a larger-than-ever direct tax through parliament in November, though much of their work at restoring the land revenues was perceived as being an attractive alternative to direct taxation. Finally, they stepped up the crown's hitherto nominal claim to highland revenues: having sent a military expedition to the highlands in 1596 they asserted sweeping powers over the chiefs in 1598, which stored up much future trouble. One policy to which they did not stoop, debasement of the coinage, was resumed with a vengeance after their removal. However, it was their efforts to reduce expenditure that attracted most hostility -- cuts in household fees and in pensions to the nobility, which hit the pockets of the well-connected. 
The Octavians' regime was diluted on 30 November 1596, when eight nobles and two other administrators were appointed to assist them, apparently to deflect criticism. This seems to have made little practical difference. A more serious challenge came the next month, as the Octavians were caught up in the struggle of the radical leaders of the church against the political influence of certain Roman Catholic nobles. Four of the Octavians -- Elphinstone, Hamilton, Lindsay, and Seton -- were believed to be closet Catholics (Elphinstone and Seton indeed were). The uprising in Edinburgh (17-19 December) collapsed for lack of noble support, but in the aftermath the Octavians were forced to resign, on 7 January 1597. 
However, ten days later the Octavians were reappointed to a new exchequer commission, further enlarged to twenty-two members of whom they themselves formed the core (most of the others were unlikely to act regularly). Their powers were as before, except that they now held office during royal pleasure rather than for life. The commission could not act without Stewart, who now held the two key offices of comptroller and treasurer. This arrangement worked at first, but Stewart's offices ran him into debt and he soon sought to resign. In October he entered negotiations with Thomas Foulis, a goldsmith and financier who had extended large credit to the king and who had managed several branches of the revenue before the Octavians' advent. The result, on 29 December 1597, was a new commission of exchequer with a similar membership to the previous one, but with Foulis and his two deputies added, and with a proviso that Foulis's authority was necessary to all expenditure. With the addition of a private agreement between Stewart and Foulis, the latter now had full effective control over the royal revenue. 
Foulis's imposing-looking regime soon came crashing down. One Octavian, Lindsay, engineered its destruction with the king's connivance, by a contrived failure to meet royal obligations to Foulis. This indicates division in the Octavian ranks, since Stewart seems to have been sincerely committed to Foulis and Hamilton had recently married Foulis's sister. On 17 January 1598 Foulis's scheme collapsed and the king charged Stewart to resume his office of treasurer, signalling that there was no longer any immediate intention of repaying the large royal debt to Foulis. This, effectively a royal bankruptcy, was one of the main legacies of the Octavian period. 
After this the Octavians retained a collective identity for five more months, as a political faction opposed to the gentlemen of the chamber. The end came on 29 June 1598, when the permanent exchequer, the Octavians' power base, was abolished by a convention of estates. This signalled an end to policies of restraint in royal generosity to the nobility, evidently as a quid pro quo for the convention's other main measure, the 'Act anent Feuding' by which the nobles agreed to submit blood feuds to royal justice. The Octavians' demise thus brought some benefit to James, who had long sought such an act, though his finances went from bad to worse until 1603. 
The Octavians themselves went their separate ways after 1598. Two (Carnegie and Lindsay) died in that year. For the survivors, especially Elphinstone, Hamilton, and Seton, membership of the group had launched their careers while not tying them to any continuing group loyalty. In 1611 Hamilton and Seton were among the members of a new eight-man financial commission, immediately dubbed the New Octavians. The Octavians placed financial reform, or at least the idea of it, on the agenda for a generation of Scottish politicians.

Ruthven raiders (act. 1581-1585), political faction, arose following the replacement of the government of James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, by one headed by two of his leading opponents, James Stewart, earl of Arran, and Esme Stewart, duke of Lennox. None the less, as a result of an amalgam of religious, political, and personal factors, the Arran-Lennox government quickly found itself under extreme pressure. Hence the Ruthven raid on 23 August 1582, when James VI was seized by William Ruthven, first earl of Gowrie, and the other raiders. These consisted principally of Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus, Patrick Lindsay, sixth Lord Lindsay of the Byres, Thomas Lyon, master of Glamis, and John Erskine, eighteenth or second earl of Mar. The raiders remained in control of the country for the next ten months, during which time the king was under house arrest in Ruthven Castle, Arran was imprisoned at Stirling, and Lennox departed for France, where he died in May 1583. 
The coup was in part inspired by growing concern among the members of the kirk at the religious policy of the Arran-Lennox regime. Here there had been, for example, little progress in a scheme devised by the general assembly for the erection of presbyteries, while a new archbishop of Glasgow, Robert Montgomerie, had been appointed in controversial circumstances. This upset not only the church but also those among the raiders with strongly protestant feelings. In this category could be included Angus, Lindsay, and to some extent Mar, as well as some others such as James Cunningham, sixth earl of Glencairn ['see under 'Cunningham family], and Sir William Douglas of Lochleven. A further complication was the long-standing political rivalry between the Stewarts and the Douglases. Morton's downfall had resulted in many of his followers, notably Angus, being forfeited. Significantly, one of James VI's first actions while under the control of the raiders was to pardon Angus and various other members of the Douglas family. 
Finally, some of the raiders had strong personal reasons for becoming involved. Thus Ruthven, despite his elevation to the earldom of Gowrie in August 1581, was apparently seriously aggrieved about certain substantial sums of money that the crown owed him from the time he served as treasurer in the Morton and Arran-Lennox administrations. As for Glamis, further unruly behaviour by him in pursuit of an interminable family feud with the Crawfords had recently been punished by a highly unpopular and hefty fine by the government. 
Although the raiders certainly had the backing of the kirk within Scotland, where their seizure of power was described 'as the late action of the reformation' ('Acts and Proceedings', 2.594), they received, despite their pronounced protestant and Anglophile leanings, little support from the English authorities. An attempt in April 1583, for instance, to negotiate an alliance whereby Elizabeth would restore the English estates of the Lennox family to James VI, came to nought. An annual subsidy of $3000 sterling was eventually agreed in May, but was never paid because of the collapse of the raiders' regime. Instead the English preferred a policy characterized by putting pressure on the Ruthven administration through a threat to release Mary, queen of Scots, and allow her to become joint sovereign with her son, the arrangement sometimes referred to as the 'association'. 
Meanwhile George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, David Lindsay, eleventh earl of Crawford, Colin Campbell, sixth earl of Argyll, and Andrew Leslie, fifth earl of Rothes, former supporters of Arran and Lennox, were conspiring to free James VI from the raiders' custody. This they achieved in June 1583, when the king succeeded in escaping from Ruthven Castle and joined the counter-revolutionaries at St Andrews. Gowrie's regime had ended. 
Undoubtedly the main beneficiary of this upheaval was Arran, who quickly assumed control of the country. Most of the former raiders were forced into exile in England, Ireland, or in the case of Angus the north of Scotland. An attempt in April 1584 by Angus, Glamis, Lindsay, and Mar, in partnership with the Hamilton family, to stage another coup by besieging the king and Arran at Stirling was a failure, with the rebels being compelled to retire once more to England. The following month Gowrie, who had been arrested beforehand, was executed for his alleged involvement in the affair. 
The former raiders remained in exile for another eighteen months before Elizabeth released them and ensured the downfall of Arran in November 1585. Thereafter the careers of most of the raiders flourished. Angus, until his death in 1588, was a key figure in the administration of the borders, and the earldom of Morton was restored to him in 1587; Glamis was appointed treasurer in the new government, a position he retained for the next decade; Mar, the king's old school companion, remained on friendly terms with James, ultimately becoming the guardian of his son Prince Henry, and much later a royal treasurer; Lindsay was freed from Tantallon Castle, where he had been imprisoned by Arran, though he was not a prominent figure in the few remaining years of his life. Consequently the Ruthven family was the only one adversely affected. The execution of the first earl of Gowrie marked the start of an unfortunate era for that family. It culminated in the deaths in 1600 of two of his sons, in the abortive attempt at seizing James VI known as the Gowrie conspiracy.

Musard family (per. c.1070-c.1330), gentry, with land in Gloucestershire and Derbyshire, was of Breton origin, probably from the seigneuries of Dol-Combour and Fougeres in north-east Brittany. In 1086 three Musards, perhaps brothers, held land in England. Hascoit Musard (fl. 1086-c.1100), probably the eldest, was a tenant-in-chief holding a little under 89 hides across six counties, of which just over 67 hides were retained in demesne and valued at $75. The most significant collection of manors lay in Gloucestershire, but there were also demesne manors in Derbyshire (where his acquisitions probably began 'c'.1070), Warwickshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire; principal residences emerged at Greenhampstead (or 'la Musarder', now Miserden), Gloucestershire, where by 1146 there was a motte and bailey castle, ruinous in 1289, and at Staveley in Derbyshire; both of these were referred to as the 'caput' of the Musard barony. Few details survive of Hascoit's life and career, but he appears to have lived into the early years of Henry I's reign. The 'Liber Eliensis' records a tradition of his devotion to St Etheldreda and the monks of Ely, whose community he entered as a monk, and to whom he granted a manor named 'Estona', probably Aston Somerville, Gloucestershire. 
Hascoit was succeeded by his son, Robert [i] Musard (fl. c.1100-1146), who by the 1140s appears to have been a supporter of the Empress Matilda against King Stephen. In 1146 he was captured and, threatened with hanging, surrendered his castle, presumably Miserden, to Philip, son of the earl of Gloucester. Robert endowed the church of St Mary, Monmouth, and either he or his father granted tithes to Tewkesbury Abbey. There are references to a Richard Musard, but it is not clear if he was Robert's son or brother; however, it was to Richard's son, Hascuil Musard (d. 1185/6), that the family estate descended in 1161/2. In 1166 Hascuil held twelve fees of the old enfeoffment, to which had been added since 1135 a half fee, a one-fifteenth fee, and two fees held in dower by the widow of Richard Musard. He made several religious endowments, including grants to the Premonstratensian abbey at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire, to the Cistercian house of Louth Park in Lincolnshire, and for a community at Birley in Derbyshire, while, in celebration of their marriage, Hascuil and his wife, Joan, between 1162 and 1182 gave half the advowson of Staveley church to the knights hospitallers and their Derbyshire preceptory at Yeaveley. Hascuil seems to have had a particular affection for the hospitallers, making further grants to them which included a part of the Miserden estate, given to the preceptory at Quenington, Gloucestershire. This interest in the military orders was maintained by several Musard tenants in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and by Hascuil's grandson Robert. 
Hascuil Musard left a widow and young heir in the custody of the sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who in 1185-6 accounted for $60 for the farm of Hascuil's lands. In 1190 Hascuil's son, Sir Ralph [i] Musard (d. 1230), owed $100 for his lands, and for the right to marry as he wished. Recorded as holding fifteen fees in 1205, by 1216 he was a member of the affinity of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and as one of his household knights is reported to have encouraged him to accept charge of the kingdom during the minority of Henry III. Sheriff of Gloucestershire between 1215 and 1225, Sir Ralph served regularly as a justice itinerant during the 1220s. He must have married at least twice, for his sons, Robert [ii] and Ralph [ii], were born at least thirteen years before his marriage 'c'.1220 to Isabel, the widow of John de Neville. She died in 1228, Sir Ralph being allowed access to her inheritance except where this was lands that she had held in chief. Sir Ralph himself died in late June 1230. Like his father, he supported Welbeck Abbey with grants from Staveley and their other Derbyshire lands. He, and later his son Ralph [ii], also endowed Welbeck's daughter house at Beauchief, where Sir Ralph joined the community shortly before his death, and where he was buried. Isabel, however, left her body to St Nicholas, Exeter. 
Shortly before Sir Ralph's death there appears to have been a family quarrel in which his eldest son, Robert [ii] Musard (d. 1239), seized the castle of Miserden. The sheriff restored the castle to Sir Ralph, but he died soon afterwards, and in September 1230 Robert took possession of his inheritance, although the castle was temporarily retained in royal custody. His family's links with the earls of Pembroke remained important, and when Richard Marshal rebelled in 1233, abortive orders were given to raze Musard's castle, while his lands were taken into royal hands. But a promise of faithful service soon led to their restoration; they included lands in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, part of the dower rights of Robert's wife, Juliana (whose former married name was Vavassur). 
Robert [ii] died in 1239, his son and heir, Ralph [iii], 'c'.1247, when his inheritance passed to his uncle, Ralph [ii] Musard (d. 1264). At the time of his death, this Ralph had lands valued at $74, and was survived by several children and a widow, Christiana, who was still alive in 1296-7. His eldest son, Ralph [iv] Musard (c.1234-1272), was among those who joined the Montfortian faction in the barons' war. He was admitted to the king's peace in December 1266, on condition of future good behaviour, though he temporarily lost some of his lands to the royalist Alan (II), or perhaps Adam, de Plugenet, regaining them by payments under the dictum of Kenilworth. In 1272 Henry III pardoned him $75 owed for the redemption of lands in Berkshire, not wanting any harm to come to Ralph. When he died his estate was valued at a little over $52, of which his widow, Matilda, received interests in Saintbury, and the manor of Siddington. She later married Thomas Trailli, 'c'.1301. 
By the mid- and late thirteenth century the financial position of the Musards had become increasingly difficult. The Domesday demesne had become significantly reduced, largely as a result of subinfeudation, concentrating the demesne manors in Derbyshire and Gloucestershire. Here too there was some subinfeudation, and to this was added the pressure of dower settlements. By 1230 Ralph [i] had run up numerous debts, for which his executors were being held responsible in 1231-3, and by 1266 Ralph [iv] owed money to the Jewish financiers of Worcester. The demands made under the dictum cannot have eased matters, and it is possible that the Gloucestershire manor of Eyford, which seems to disappear from the Musard estate by 1273, was sold as a result. It was certainly the case that in 1269 Ralph [iv] Musard agreed to demise the important manor of Staveley to Peter of Chester for a term of seventeen years, in return for which Peter acquitted Ralph of all his debts to the Jewish moneylenders of London, Worcester, and elsewhere, and paid a further $40 in addition. Ralph [iv]'s heir, John Musard (c.1267-1289), a minor when his father died, became a ward of the king, who exploited his rights to the full. John was finally given seisin of his lands in December 1287, but had died by 7 February 1289. His three demesne manors of Saintbury, Miserden, and Staveley were together valued around $53, of which Staveley was by far the most valuable, at a little under $38. By the late thirteenth century there had been a shift in the relative values of the demesnes, the role of the Gloucestershire manors diminishing in value by comparison with the key Derbyshire manor of Staveley. 
John was succeeded by his uncle, Nicholas Musard (c.1240-1300), a clerk in orders, who was granted his lands in April 1289, and was the last in the legitimate Musard line. He had at least three sons and two daughters, but as he was rector of Staveley these children were illegitimate and thereby discounted from the inheritance, which at the time of his death, by December 1300, had been further reduced to the manor of Staveley, valued at a little under $35. This was divided between his three sisters or their offspring. Nevertheless, Nicholas made provision for his children. In 1298/9 he gave lands in Staveley to his daughter Christiana and he conveyed Miserden to his son Malcolm Musard (fl. c.1296-c.1330), who in turn granted the manor in 1296/7 to Hugh Despenser the elder, a grant which Nicholas confirmed in 1297/8. Similarly, Nicholas enfeoffed Malcolm with Saintbury, which in April 1300 Malcolm was pardoned for having entered without licence, and allowed to retain. However, in 1303 Malcolm obtained a licence to alienate this manor in mortmain to Evesham Abbey. 
Neither of these grants by Malcolm stands in isolation. He perhaps saw ties with Hugh Despenser as a means of securing his future. By 1302/3 he had assigned the reversion of the manor of Siddington, held for life by Thomas Trailli and his wife, Matilda Musard, to Hugh, and he also granted to him various other lands and rents. He was a member of Hugh's retinue in 1305, owed him 100 marks in 1306, and as an adherent of Despenser was to have his lands confiscated in 1327. In 1311 Evesham Abbey was pardoned for having acquired a knight's fee in Aston Somerville from Malcolm in mortmain, without royal licence, while in 1316 the abbey also received lands in Warwickshire from him. 
Malcolm Musard illustrates well the propensity for some early fourteenth-century gentry to further their prospects and careers by violence. He can be linked with offences of poaching, theft, assault, intimidation, and extortion, sometimes leading in person the gang of associates that did his bidding. He became chief forester of Feckenham, where he had scope to continue his activities, and he fulfilled a number of royal commissions, including keeper of Hanley Castle in 1321. Last recorded in 1330, he was probably dead by 1333. 
The Musard family's arms are listed as gules three roundels argent.

Hascoit was succeeded by his son, Robert [i] Musard (fl. c.1100-1146), who by the 1140s appears to have been a supporter of the Empress Matilda against King Stephen. In 1146 he was captured and, threatened with hanging, surrendered his castle, presumably Miserden, to Philip, son of the earl of Gloucester. Robert endowed the church of St Mary, Monmouth, and either he or his father granted tithes to Tewkesbury Abbey. There are references to a Richard Musard, but it is not clear if he was Robert's son or brother; however, it was to Richard's son, Hascuil Musard (d. 1185/6), that the family estate descended in 1161/2. In 1166 Hascuil held twelve fees of the old enfeoffment, to which had been added since 1135 a half fee, a one-fifteenth fee, and two fees held in dower by the widow of Richard Musard. He made several religious endowments, including grants to the Premonstratensian abbey at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire, to the Cistercian house of Louth Park in Lincolnshire, and for a community at Birley in Derbyshire, while, in celebration of their marriage, Hascuil and his wife, Joan, between 1162 and 1182 gave half the advowson of Staveley church to the knights hospitallers and their Derbyshire preceptory at Yeaveley. Hascuil seems to have had a particular affection for the hospitallers, making further grants to them which included a part of the Miserden estate, given to the preceptory at Quenington, Gloucestershire. This interest in the military orders was maintained by several Musard tenants in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and by Hascuil's grandson Robert. 
Hascuil Musard left a widow and young heir in the custody of the sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who in 1185-6 accounted for $60 for the farm of Hascuil's lands. In 1190 Hascuil's son, Sir Ralph [i] Musard (d. 1230), owed $100 for his lands, and for the right to marry as he wished. Recorded as holding fifteen fees in 1205, by 1216 he was a member of the affinity of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and as one of his household knights is reported to have encouraged him to accept charge of the kingdom during the minority of Henry III. Sheriff of Gloucestershire between 1215 and 1225, Sir Ralph served regularly as a justice itinerant during the 1220s. He must have married at least twice, for his sons, Robert [ii] and Ralph [ii], were born at least thirteen years before his marriage 'c'.1220 to Isabel, the widow of John de Neville. She died in 1228, Sir Ralph being allowed access to her inheritance except where this was lands that she had held in chief. Sir Ralph himself died in late June 1230. Like his father, he supported Welbeck Abbey with grants from Staveley and their other Derbyshire lands. He, and later his son Ralph [ii], also endowed Welbeck's daughter house at Beauchief, where Sir Ralph joined the community shortly before his death, and where he was buried. Isabel, however, left her body to St Nicholas, Exeter. 
Shortly before Sir Ralph's death there appears to have been a family quarrel in which his eldest son, Robert [ii] Musard (d. 1239), seized the castle of Miserden. The sheriff restored the castle to Sir Ralph, but he died soon afterwards, and in September 1230 Robert took possession of his inheritance, although the castle was temporarily retained in royal custody. His family's links with the earls of Pembroke remained important, and when Richard Marshal rebelled in 1233, abortive orders were given to raze Musard's castle, while his lands were taken into royal hands. But a promise of faithful service soon led to their restoration; they included lands in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, part of the dower rights of Robert's wife, Juliana (whose former married name was Vavassur). 
Robert [ii] died in 1239, his son and heir, Ralph [iii], 'c'.1247, when his inheritance passed to his uncle, Ralph [ii] Musard (d. 1264). At the time of his death, this Ralph had lands valued at $74, and was survived by several children and a widow, Christiana, who was still alive in 1296-7. His eldest son, Ralph [iv] Musard (c.1234-1272), was among those who joined the Montfortian faction in the barons' war. He was admitted to the king's peace in December 1266, on condition of future good behaviour, though he temporarily lost some of his lands to the royalist Alan (II), or perhaps Adam, de Plugenet, regaining them by payments under the dictum of Kenilworth. In 1272 Henry III pardoned him $75 owed for the redemption of lands in Berkshire, not wanting any harm to come to Ralph. When he died his estate was valued at a little over $52, of which his widow, Matilda, received interests in Saintbury, and the manor of Siddington. She later married Thomas Trailli, 'c'.1301. 
By the mid- and late thirteenth century the financial position of the Musards had become increasingly difficult. The Domesday demesne had become significantly reduced, largely as a result of subinfeudation, concentrating the demesne manors in Derbyshire and Gloucestershire. Here too there was some subinfeudation, and to this was added the pressure of dower settlements. By 1230 Ralph [i] had run up numerous debts, for which his executors were being held responsible in 1231-3, and by 1266 Ralph [iv] owed money to the Jewish financiers of Worcester. The demands made under the dictum cannot have eased matters, and it is possible that the Gloucestershire manor of Eyford, which seems to disappear from the Musard estate by 1273, was sold as a result. It was certainly the case that in 1269 Ralph [iv] Musard agreed to demise the important manor of Staveley to Peter of Chester for a term of seventeen years, in return for which Peter acquitted Ralph of all his debts to the Jewish moneylenders of London, Worcester, and elsewhere, and paid a further $40 in addition. Ralph [iv]'s heir, John Musard (c.1267-1289), a minor when his father died, became a ward of the king, who exploited his rights to the full. John was finally given seisin of his lands in December 1287, but had died by 7 February 1289. His three demesne manors of Saintbury, Miserden, and Staveley were together valued around $53, of which Staveley was by far the most valuable, at a little under $38. By the late thirteenth century there had been a shift in the relative values of the demesnes, the role of the Gloucestershire manors diminishing in value by comparison with the key Derbyshire manor of Staveley. 
John was succeeded by his uncle, Nicholas Musard (c.1240-1300), a clerk in orders, who was granted his lands in April 1289, and was the last in the legitimate Musard line. He had at least three sons and two daughters, but as he was rector of Staveley these children were illegitimate and thereby discounted from the inheritance, which at the time of his death, by December 1300, had been further reduced to the manor of Staveley, valued at a little under $35. This was divided between his three sisters or their offspring. Nevertheless, Nicholas made provision for his children. In 1298/9 he gave lands in Staveley to his daughter Christiana and he conveyed Miserden to his son Malcolm Musard (fl. c.1296-c.1330), who in turn granted the manor in 1296/7 to Hugh Despenser the elder, a grant which Nicholas confirmed in 1297/8. Similarly, Nicholas enfeoffed Malcolm with Saintbury, which in April 1300 Malcolm was pardoned for having entered without licence, and allowed to retain. However, in 1303 Malcolm obtained a licence to alienate this manor in mortmain to Evesham Abbey. 
Neither of these grants by Malcolm stands in isolation. He perhaps saw ties with Hugh Despenser as a means of securing his future. By 1302/3 he had assigned the reversion of the manor of Siddington, held for life by Thomas Trailli and his wife, Matilda Musard, to Hugh, and he also granted to him various other lands and rents. He was a member of Hugh's retinue in 1305, owed him 100 marks in 1306, and as an adherent of Despenser was to have his lands confiscated in 1327. In 1311 Evesham Abbey was pardoned for having acquired a knight's fee in Aston Somerville from Malcolm in mortmain, without royal licence, while in 1316 the abbey also received lands in Warwickshire from him. 
Malcolm Musard illustrates well the propensity for some early fourteenth-century gentry to further their prospects and careers by violence. He can be linked with offences of poaching, theft, assault, intimidation, and extortion, sometimes leading in person the gang of associates that did his bidding. He became chief forester of Feckenham, where he had scope to continue his activities, and he fulfilled a number of royal commissions, including keeper of Hanley Castle in 1321. Last recorded in 1330, he was probably dead by 1333. 
The Musard family's arms are listed as gules three roundels argent.

Musard family (per. c.1070-c.1330), gentry, with land in Gloucestershire and Derbyshire, was of Breton origin, probably from the seigneuries of Dol-Combour and Fougeres in north-east Brittany. In 1086 three Musards, perhaps brothers, held land in England. Hascoit Musard (fl. 1086-c.1100), probably the eldest, was a tenant-in-chief holding a little under 89 hides across six counties, of which just over 67 hides were retained in demesne and valued at $75. The most significant collection of manors lay in Gloucestershire, but there were also demesne manors in Derbyshire (where his acquisitions probably began 'c'.1070), Warwickshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire; principal residences emerged at Greenhampstead (or 'la Musarder', now Miserden), Gloucestershire, where by 1146 there was a motte and bailey castle, ruinous in 1289, and at Staveley in Derbyshire; both of these were referred to as the 'caput' of the Musard barony. Few details survive of Hascoit's life and career, but he appears to have lived into the early years of Henry I's reign.

College of justice, procurators of the (act. 1532), lawyers, were the eight men admitted by the lords of session to act as procurators and advocates in all actions coming before the college of justice when that court was established in Edinburgh in 1532. The precise significance of this event has been a matter of historical debate, and emphasis has been placed on preceding institutional developments and on the regular and increasingly specialized judicial 'sessions' which were held to deal with civil matters, leading in turn to the foundation of a central civil court. This view has led to a downgrading of the events of 1532. The college was founded using money diverted from papal revenues with the consent of Pope Clement VII, and has been seen as merely an example of James V's opportunism in appropriating church funds to his own use. Legal historians, however, have pointed to jurisdictional issues which suggest that the foundation marked, if not a new departure, then at least an important milestone in the development of Scots law. 
All eight advocates were well educated (most of them attended continental as well as Scottish universities) and forensically skilled. 
















The surviving evidence for the careers of these eight advocates indicates that the highest rank of the nascent legal profession in Scotland was comparable in standard to similar professions elsewhere. At the foundation of the college of justice, the judges made a restatement of the ethical and professional standards expected of advocates, and there is some evidence during the following decade of the development of corporate identity among the leading advocates. It is also apparent that their practice could be a source of considerable personal profit. Although there is much that remains obscure about the origin of the Faculty of Advocates, there can be no doubt that its early development was greatly advanced by the events of 1532, and by the distinguished careers of nearly all the men appointed in that year.

Musard family (per. c.1070-c.1330), gentry, with land in Gloucestershire and Derbyshire, was of Breton origin, probably from the seigneuries of Dol-Combour and Fougeres in north-east Brittany. In 1086 three Musards, perhaps brothers, held land in England. Hascoit Musard (fl. 1086-c.1100), probably the eldest, was a tenant-in-chief holding a little under 89 hides across six counties, of which just over 67 hides were retained in demesne and valued at $75. The most significant collection of manors lay in Gloucestershire, but there were also demesne manors in Derbyshire (where his acquisitions probably began 'c'.1070), Warwickshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire; principal residences emerged at Greenhampstead (or 'la Musarder', now Miserden), Gloucestershire, where by 1146 there was a motte and bailey castle, ruinous in 1289, and at Staveley in Derbyshire; both of these were referred to as the 'caput' of the Musard barony. Few details survive of Hascoit's life and career, but he appears to have lived into the early years of Henry I's reign. The 'Liber Eliensis' records a tradition of his devotion to St Etheldreda and the monks of Ely, whose community he entered as a monk, and to whom he granted a manor named 'Estona', probably Aston Somerville, Gloucestershire. 
Hascoit was succeeded by his son, Robert [i] Musard (fl. c.1100-1146), who by the 1140s appears to have been a supporter of the Empress Matilda against King Stephen. In 1146 he was captured and, threatened with hanging, surrendered his castle, presumably Miserden, to Philip, son of the earl of Gloucester. Robert endowed the church of St Mary, Monmouth, and either he or his father granted tithes to Tewkesbury Abbey. There are references to a Richard Musard, but it is not clear if he was Robert's son or brother; however, it was to Richard's son, Hascuil Musard (d. 1185/6), that the family estate descended in 1161/2. In 1166 Hascuil held twelve fees of the old enfeoffment, to which had been added since 1135 a half fee, a one-fifteenth fee, and two fees held in dower by the widow of Richard Musard. He made several religious endowments, including grants to the Premonstratensian abbey at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire, to the Cistercian house of Louth Park in Lincolnshire, and for a community at Birley in Derbyshire, while, in celebration of their marriage, Hascuil and his wife, Joan, between 1162 and 1182 gave half the advowson of Staveley church to the knights hospitallers and their Derbyshire preceptory at Yeaveley. Hascuil seems to have had a particular affection for the hospitallers, making further grants to them which included a part of the Miserden estate, given to the preceptory at Quenington, Gloucestershire. This interest in the military orders was maintained by several Musard tenants in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and by Hascuil's grandson Robert. 
Hascuil Musard left a widow and young heir in the custody of the sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who in 1185-6 accounted for $60 for the farm of Hascuil's lands. In 1190 Hascuil's son, Sir Ralph [i] Musard (d. 1230), owed $100 for his lands, and for the right to marry as he wished. Recorded as holding fifteen fees in 1205, by 1216 he was a member of the affinity of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and as one of his household knights is reported to have encouraged him to accept charge of the kingdom during the minority of Henry III. Sheriff of Gloucestershire between 1215 and 1225, Sir Ralph served regularly as a justice itinerant during the 1220s. He must have married at least twice, for his sons, Robert [ii] and Ralph [ii], were born at least thirteen years before his marriage 'c'.1220 to Isabel, the widow of John de Neville. She died in 1228, Sir Ralph being allowed access to her inheritance except where this was lands that she had held in chief. Sir Ralph himself died in late June 1230. Like his father, he supported Welbeck Abbey with grants from Staveley and their other Derbyshire lands. He, and later his son Ralph [ii], also endowed Welbeck's daughter house at Beauchief, where Sir Ralph joined the community shortly before his death, and where he was buried. Isabel, however, left her body to St Nicholas, Exeter. 
Shortly before Sir Ralph's death there appears to have been a family quarrel in which his eldest son, Robert [ii] Musard (d. 1239), seized the castle of Miserden. The sheriff restored the castle to Sir Ralph, but he died soon afterwards, and in September 1230 Robert took possession of his inheritance, although the castle was temporarily retained in royal custody. His family's links with the earls of Pembroke remained important, and when Richard Marshal rebelled in 1233, abortive orders were given to raze Musard's castle, while his lands were taken into royal hands. But a promise of faithful service soon led to their restoration; they included lands in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, part of the dower rights of Robert's wife, Juliana (whose former married name was Vavassur). 
Robert [ii] died in 1239, his son and heir, Ralph [iii], 'c'.1247, when his inheritance passed to his uncle, Ralph [ii] Musard (d. 1264). At the time of his death, this Ralph had lands valued at $74, and was survived by several children and a widow, Christiana, who was still alive in 1296-7. His eldest son, Ralph [iv] Musard (c.1234-1272), was among those who joined the Montfortian faction in the barons' war. He was admitted to the king's peace in December 1266, on condition of future good behaviour, though he temporarily lost some of his lands to the royalist Alan (II), or perhaps Adam, de Plugenet, regaining them by payments under the dictum of Kenilworth. In 1272 Henry III pardoned him $75 owed for the redemption of lands in Berkshire, not wanting any harm to come to Ralph. When he died his estate was valued at a little over $52, of which his widow, Matilda, received interests in Saintbury, and the manor of Siddington. She later married Thomas Trailli, 'c'.1301. 
By the mid- and late thirteenth century the financial position of the Musards had become increasingly difficult. The Domesday demesne had become significantly reduced, largely as a result of subinfeudation, concentrating the demesne manors in Derbyshire and Gloucestershire. Here too there was some subinfeudation, and to this was added the pressure of dower settlements. By 1230 Ralph [i] had run up numerous debts, for which his executors were being held responsible in 1231-3, and by 1266 Ralph [iv] owed money to the Jewish financiers of Worcester. The demands made under the dictum cannot have eased matters, and it is possible that the Gloucestershire manor of Eyford, which seems to disappear from the Musard estate by 1273, was sold as a result. It was certainly the case that in 1269 Ralph [iv] Musard agreed to demise the important manor of Staveley to Peter of Chester for a term of seventeen years, in return for which Peter acquitted Ralph of all his debts to the Jewish moneylenders of London, Worcester, and elsewhere, and paid a further $40 in addition. Ralph [iv]'s heir, John Musard (c.1267-1289), a minor when his father died, became a ward of the king, who exploited his rights to the full. John was finally given seisin of his lands in December 1287, but had died by 7 February 1289. His three demesne manors of Saintbury, Miserden, and Staveley were together valued around $53, of which Staveley was by far the most valuable, at a little under $38. By the late thirteenth century there had been a shift in the relative values of the demesnes, the role of the Gloucestershire manors diminishing in value by comparison with the key Derbyshire manor of Staveley. 
John was succeeded by his uncle, Nicholas Musard (c.1240-1300), a clerk in orders, who was granted his lands in April 1289, and was the last in the legitimate Musard line. He had at least three sons and two daughters, but as he was rector of Staveley these children were illegitimate and thereby discounted from the inheritance, which at the time of his death, by December 1300, had been further reduced to the manor of Staveley, valued at a little under $35. This was divided between his three sisters or their offspring. Nevertheless, Nicholas made provision for his children. In 1298/9 he gave lands in Staveley to his daughter Christiana and he conveyed Miserden to his son Malcolm Musard (fl. c.1296-c.1330), who in turn granted the manor in 1296/7 to Hugh Despenser the elder, a grant which Nicholas confirmed in 1297/8. Similarly, Nicholas enfeoffed Malcolm with Saintbury, which in April 1300 Malcolm was pardoned for having entered without licence, and allowed to retain. However, in 1303 Malcolm obtained a licence to alienate this manor in mortmain to Evesham Abbey. 
Neither of these grants by Malcolm stands in isolation. He perhaps saw ties with Hugh Despenser as a means of securing his future. By 1302/3 he had assigned the reversion of the manor of Siddington, held for life by Thomas Trailli and his wife, Matilda Musard, to Hugh, and he also granted to him various other lands and rents. He was a member of Hugh's retinue in 1305, owed him 100 marks in 1306, and as an adherent of Despenser was to have his lands confiscated in 1327. In 1311 Evesham Abbey was pardoned for having acquired a knight's fee in Aston Somerville from Malcolm in mortmain, without royal licence, while in 1316 the abbey also received lands in Warwickshire from him. 
Malcolm Musard illustrates well the propensity for some early fourteenth-century gentry to further their prospects and careers by violence. He can be linked with offences of poaching, theft, assault, intimidation, and extortion, sometimes leading in person the gang of associates that did his bidding. He became chief forester of Feckenham, where he had scope to continue his activities, and he fulfilled a number of royal commissions, including keeper of Hanley Castle in 1321. Last recorded in 1330, he was probably dead by 1333.

Musard family (per. c.1070-c.1330), gentry, with land in Gloucestershire and Derbyshire, was of Breton origin, probably from the seigneuries of Dol-Combour and Fougeres in north-east Brittany. In 1086 three Musards, perhaps brothers, held land in England. Hascoit Musard (fl. 1086-c.1100), probably the eldest, was a tenant-in-chief holding a little under 89 hides across six counties, of which just over 67 hides were retained in demesne and valued at $75. The most significant collection of manors lay in Gloucestershire, but there were also demesne manors in Derbyshire (where his acquisitions probably began 'c'.1070), Warwickshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire; principal residences emerged at Greenhampstead (or 'la Musarder', now Miserden), Gloucestershire, where by 1146 there was a motte and bailey castle, ruinous in 1289, and at Staveley in Derbyshire; both of these were referred to as the 'caput' of the Musard barony. Few details survive of Hascoit's life and career, but he appears to have lived into the early years of Henry I's reign. The 'Liber Eliensis' records a tradition of his devotion to St Etheldreda and the monks of Ely, whose community he entered as a monk, and to whom he granted a manor named 'Estona', probably Aston Somerville, Gloucestershire. 
Hascoit was succeeded by his son, Robert [i] Musard (fl. c.1100-1146), who by the 1140s appears to have been a supporter of the Empress Matilda against King Stephen. In 1146 he was captured and, threatened with hanging, surrendered his castle, presumably Miserden, to Philip, son of the earl of Gloucester. Robert endowed the church of St Mary, Monmouth, and either he or his father granted tithes to Tewkesbury Abbey. There are references to a Richard Musard, but it is not clear if he was Robert's son or brother; however, it was to Richard's son, Hascuil Musard (d. 1185/6), that the family estate descended in 1161/2. In 1166 Hascuil held twelve fees of the old enfeoffment, to which had been added since 1135 a half fee, a one-fifteenth fee, and two fees held in dower by the widow of Richard Musard. He made several religious endowments, including grants to the Premonstratensian abbey at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire, to the Cistercian house of Louth Park in Lincolnshire, and for a community at Birley in Derbyshire, while, in celebration of their marriage, Hascuil and his wife, Joan, between 1162 and 1182 gave half the advowson of Staveley church to the knights hospitallers and their Derbyshire preceptory at Yeaveley. Hascuil seems to have had a particular affection for the hospitallers, making further grants to them which included a part of the Miserden estate, given to the preceptory at Quenington, Gloucestershire. This interest in the military orders was maintained by several Musard tenants in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and by Hascuil's grandson Robert. 
Hascuil Musard left a widow and young heir in the custody of the sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who in 1185-6 accounted for $60 for the farm of Hascuil's lands. In 1190 Hascuil's son, Sir Ralph [i] Musard (d. 1230), owed $100 for his lands, and for the right to marry as he wished. Recorded as holding fifteen fees in 1205, by 1216 he was a member of the affinity of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and as one of his household knights is reported to have encouraged him to accept charge of the kingdom during the minority of Henry III. Sheriff of Gloucestershire between 1215 and 1225, Sir Ralph served regularly as a justice itinerant during the 1220s. He must have married at least twice, for his sons, Robert [ii] and Ralph [ii], were born at least thirteen years before his marriage 'c'.1220 to Isabel, the widow of John de Neville. She died in 1228, Sir Ralph being allowed access to her inheritance except where this was lands that she had held in chief. Sir Ralph himself died in late June 1230. Like his father, he supported Welbeck Abbey with grants from Staveley and their other Derbyshire lands. He, and later his son Ralph [ii], also endowed Welbeck's daughter house at Beauchief, where Sir Ralph joined the community shortly before his death, and where he was buried. Isabel, however, left her body to St Nicholas, Exeter. 
Shortly before Sir Ralph's death there appears to have been a family quarrel in which his eldest son, Robert [ii] Musard (d. 1239), seized the castle of Miserden. The sheriff restored the castle to Sir Ralph, but he died soon afterwards, and in September 1230 Robert took possession of his inheritance, although the castle was temporarily retained in royal custody. His family's links with the earls of Pembroke remained important, and when Richard Marshal rebelled in 1233, abortive orders were given to raze Musard's castle, while his lands were taken into royal hands. But a promise of faithful service soon led to their restoration; they included lands in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, part of the dower rights of Robert's wife, Juliana (whose former married name was Vavassur). 
Robert [ii] died in 1239, his son and heir, Ralph [iii], 'c'.1247, when his inheritance passed to his uncle, Ralph [ii] Musard (d. 1264). At the time of his death, this Ralph had lands valued at $74, and was survived by several children and a widow, Christiana, who was still alive in 1296-7. His eldest son, Ralph [iv] Musard (c.1234-1272), was among those who joined the Montfortian faction in the barons' war. He was admitted to the king's peace in December 1266, on condition of future good behaviour, though he temporarily lost some of his lands to the royalist Alan (II), or perhaps Adam, de Plugenet, regaining them by payments under the dictum of Kenilworth. In 1272 Henry III pardoned him $75 owed for the redemption of lands in Berkshire, not wanting any harm to come to Ralph. When he died his estate was valued at a little over $52, of which his widow, Matilda, received interests in Saintbury, and the manor of Siddington. She later married Thomas Trailli, 'c'.1301. 
By the mid- and late thirteenth century the financial position of the Musards had become increasingly difficult. The Domesday demesne had become significantly reduced, largely as a result of subinfeudation, concentrating the demesne manors in Derbyshire and Gloucestershire. Here too there was some subinfeudation, and to this was added the pressure of dower settlements. By 1230 Ralph [i] had run up numerous debts, for which his executors were being held responsible in 1231-3, and by 1266 Ralph [iv] owed money to the Jewish financiers of Worcester. The demands made under the dictum cannot have eased matters, and it is possible that the Gloucestershire manor of Eyford, which seems to disappear from the Musard estate by 1273, was sold as a result. It was certainly the case that in 1269 Ralph [iv] Musard agreed to demise the important manor of Staveley to Peter of Chester for a term of seventeen years, in return for which Peter acquitted Ralph of all his debts to the Jewish moneylenders of London, Worcester, and elsewhere, and paid a further $40 in addition. Ralph [iv]'s heir, John Musard (c.1267-1289), a minor when his father died, became a ward of the king, who exploited his rights to the full. John was finally given seisin of his lands in December 1287, but had died by 7 February 1289. His three demesne manors of Saintbury, Miserden, and Staveley were together valued around $53, of which Staveley was by far the most valuable, at a little under $38. By the late thirteenth century there had been a shift in the relative values of the demesnes, the role of the Gloucestershire manors diminishing in value by comparison with the key Derbyshire manor of Staveley. 
John was succeeded by his uncle, Nicholas Musard (c.1240-1300), a clerk in orders, who was granted his lands in April 1289, and was the last in the legitimate Musard line. He had at least three sons and two daughters, but as he was rector of Staveley these children were illegitimate and thereby discounted from the inheritance, which at the time of his death, by December 1300, had been further reduced to the manor of Staveley, valued at a little under $35. This was divided between his three sisters or their offspring. Nevertheless, Nicholas made provision for his children. In 1298/9 he gave lands in Staveley to his daughter Christiana and he conveyed Miserden to his son Malcolm Musard (fl. c.1296-c.1330), who in turn granted the manor in 1296/7 to Hugh Despenser the elder, a grant which Nicholas confirmed in 1297/8. Similarly, Nicholas enfeoffed Malcolm with Saintbury, which in April 1300 Malcolm was pardoned for having entered without licence, and allowed to retain. However, in 1303 Malcolm obtained a licence to alienate this manor in mortmain to Evesham Abbey. 
Neither of these grants by Malcolm stands in isolation. He perhaps saw ties with Hugh Despenser as a means of securing his future. By 1302/3 he had assigned the reversion of the manor of Siddington, held for life by Thomas Trailli and his wife, Matilda Musard, to Hugh, and he also granted to him various other lands and rents. He was a member of Hugh's retinue in 1305, owed him 100 marks in 1306, and as an adherent of Despenser was to have his lands confiscated in 1327. In 1311 Evesham Abbey was pardoned for having acquired a knight's fee in Aston Somerville from Malcolm in mortmain, without royal licence, while in 1316 the abbey also received lands in Warwickshire from him. 
Malcolm Musard illustrates well the propensity for some early fourteenth-century gentry to further their prospects and careers by violence. He can be linked with offences of poaching, theft, assault, intimidation, and extortion, sometimes leading in person the gang of associates that did his bidding. He became chief forester of Feckenham, where he had scope to continue his activities, and he fulfilled a number of royal commissions, including keeper of Hanley Castle in 1321. Last recorded in 1330, he was probably dead by 1333. 
The Musard family's arms are listed as gules three roundels argent.

Castilians in Edinburgh (act. 1570-1573), armed political faction, were supporters of Mary, queen of Scots, who held Edinburgh Castle (hence 'castilian') between 1570 and 1573 and for much of this period controlled the town as well. 
The assassination of the regent, James Stewart, earl of Moray, in January 1570 sparked off a civil war between the supporters of the government carried on in the name of James VI, and those who supported the restoration of his mother, Mary, who had been deposed in 1567. Edinburgh remained in the hands of the Marians until October 1572, and its strategically important castle was not surrendered until the end of May 1573. 

Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange (c.1520-1573) was appointed commander of the castle by Moray in 1569, but transferred his allegiance to the queen's side, an action which particularly infuriated John Knox. The great reformer, who had been one of Kirkcaldy's colleagues and a fellow castilian in an earlier episode, the siege of St Andrews Castle in 1546-7, prophesied that Kirkcaldy's reward for his treachery would be to 'hang from a gallows in the face of the sun' ('Knox's History', 2.157). Kirkcaldy was a resolute and experienced soldier who after his capture at St Andrews in 1547 had served with considerable distinction in the armies of Henri II of France before returning to Scotland to support the reformers. Kirkcaldy's principal ally was William Maitland of Lethington (1525x30-1573), the former royal secretary, who, disapproving of Mary's deposition since he believed it would harm his efforts at closer links with England, had also changed sides. Under the threat of arrest by Moray's administration, he had welcomed Kirkcaldy's offer of protection and moved to Edinburgh Castle in September 1568. However, by November 1572 ill health greatly limited any contribution he might have made to the defence of the castle. 
Other castilians included John Maitland of Thirlestane (1543-1595), the former secretary's younger brother, who supported Mary's cause throughout the civil war. Another was Alexander Home, fifth Lord Home (c.1525-1575), who had been badly wounded fighting as an ally of Moray at Langside in 1567, but who had transferred his allegiance to Mary in 1569. In the following year his main residence, Home Castle, was seized by the English, pursuing forces from the northern rising, and in 1571 Home joined the queen's followers in Edinburgh Castle. Another was Robert Melville of Murdocairnie, later first Lord Melville (1527/8-1621). Melville, a Fife laird with a strong protestant background, was, like Maitland, an example of how support for Mary often had little to do with religious belief. Melville's diplomatic career was already well established; he had been Mary's ambassador at Elizabeth's court in the aftermath of the Darnley murder.

Castilians in St Andrews (act. 1546-1547), armed political faction, is the collective name given to the men who murdered Cardinal David Beaton in St Andrews Castle and then held it for fourteen months against government forces. Plots to assassinate Beaton had been current as early as 1544, but the grievance that brought many of the murderers together was the execution of the protestant reformer George Wishart on 1 March 1546. The principal driving force behind the murder was Norman Leslie, master of Rothes (d. 1554), eldest son of George Leslie, fourth earl of Rothes, sheriff of Fife. Leslie claimed that Beaton had failed to honour his obligations under a bond of manrent they held. The Leslies had suffered from the expansion of Beaton's interest in Fife. 
Among the other Fife gentry who joined Norman Leslie was his uncle

John (I) Savage (d. 1386) married as his second wife the heiress Margaret Danyers. The lands she brought to him, which included Clifton, Cheshire, had been granted to Geoffrey of Dutton by John, constable of Chester, during the reign of Henry II. John Savage had risen to prominence in the service of Edward, the Black Prince, in France: one of the remaining garrison commanders after 1369 when the days of large-scale musters had passed, he held Salveterre in 1373. John died in 1386, leaving an heir, John (II), and three daughters, Elizabeth, Blanche, and Lucy. Margaret survived him and went on to marry Piers Legh, younger son of Robert Legh of Adlington; but it was her Savage descendants to whom she gave the liberty of bearing her arms, argent, four (or five) fusils in pale, sable.

Savage family (per. c.1369-1528), gentry, originated in Derbyshire. The Savages established an important interest in Cheshire in the late 1370s after John (I) Savage (d. 1386) married as his second wife the heiress Margaret Danyers. The lands she brought to him, which included Clifton, Cheshire, had been granted to Geoffrey of Dutton by John, constable of Chester, during the reign of Henry II. John Savage had risen to prominence in the service of Edward, the Black Prince, in France: one of the remaining garrison commanders after 1369 when the days of large-scale musters had passed, he held Salveterre in 1373. John died in 1386, leaving an heir, John (II), and three daughters, Elizabeth, Blanche, and Lucy. Margaret survived him and went on to marry Piers Legh, younger son of Robert Legh of Adlington; but it was her Savage descendants to whom she gave the liberty of bearing her arms, argent, four (or five) fusils in pale, sable. 

Sir John (II) Savage (d. 1450) achieved success in royal service. Like his father, he served in France: Froissart records his complaint in 1390 at the tournament of St Inglevert that he had not crossed the sea merely to run one lance. Under Richard II he was appointed keeper of the park of Macclesfield, along with Piers Legh of Macclesfield. Yet he made the transition to the Lancastrian allegiance: soon after Bolingbroke's accession, Savage was granted a fee and in the first year of the reign he led troops in Henry IV's Scottish campaign. John (II) consolidated his interest around Macclesfield, receiving a lease of its mills in 1408, and he was often a justice on eyre in Cheshire. Knighted at Agincourt, in 1418 John (II) led 250 Cheshire men to Calais; he also received significant rewards from a ransom. Early in Henry IV's reign he married Maud, daughter of Robert Swinnarton, heir to a valuable inheritance which included all the lands once held by Hugh Despenser, earl of Winchester, in Staffordshire and Cheshire; these included the manor of Great Barrow, Cheshire. With Maud, John had five sons, John (III), William, Arnold, George, and Roger, and three daughters: Margaret, who married John, eventual heir to Sir Piers Dutton of Dutton; Maud, who married Sir Thomas Booth of Barton; and Isabel, who married Robert Legh of Adlington. In 1428, after Maud's death, John married again. The identity of his second wife is not entirely certain. She has usually been identified as Ellen ('nee' Urswyk), who had previously been the wife first of Robert Molyneux and then of Sir James Harrington. But claims have also been made for her having been the daughter of Sir Ralph Vernon of Shipbrook, and although the evidence for the second identification is meagre, it would help to explain the settlement of Vernon estates upon Sir John and his wife that was made early in Henry VI's reign. Sir John (II) died on 1 August 1450; his son and heir, John (III), was already in full maturity, and the foundations for a transition of power from father to son were laid in 1439 when they were jointly appointed to office in Macclesfield for life. 

John (III) Savage (d. 1463) extended Savage interests by obtaining a stake in the Middlewich salt industry. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Brereton, with whom he had John (IV), his son and heir (born in 1421 or 1422), and three daughters: Margery, who married first Edmund Legh of Baguley, and second Thomas Leycester of Nether Tabley, as his second wife; Margaret, who also married twice, first to John Maxfield, and second to Randle Mainwaring of Carincham, third son of Randle Mainwaring of Peover; and third, Ellen, who married Piers Warburton. John (III) died on 29 July 1463, aged fifty-three, leaving John, his heir, aged forty and more. 
John (II) Savage was retained in 1441-2 by Humphrey Stafford, first duke of Buckingham, but Buckingham's intervention in the politics of Cheshire was short-lived. More productive and long-lasting connections were formed with the houses of York and Stanley. Although there is a possibility that John (III) entered the service of the house of York, it seems more likely that it was his son Sir John (IV) Savage (c.1423-1495) who did so. He was therefore well placed to benefit from Henry VI's deposition. John (III) served as deputy to Sir Thomas Stanley, afterwards Baron Stanley, as steward of the duchy lordship of Halton, Cheshire. John (IV) married Stanley's daughter Katherine; the couple's children were many and prominent. Aside from John (V), Savage's son and heir, there was Thomas Savage (d. 1507), who rose to be bishop of Rochester in 1492, and of London in 1497, and archbishop of York in 1501, Sir Humphrey, Lawrence, James, Sir Edmund, Christopher, William, George, and Richard. His daughters made good matches, with Ellen being married to Peter Legh of Lyme, Katherine to Thomas Legh of Adlington, Margaret to Edmund Trafford of Trafford, Lancashire, Alice to Roger Pilkington (died 1527) ['see under 'Pilkington family], and Elizabeth to John Leek of Langford, Derbyshire. John (IV) was knighted at Elizabeth Woodville's coronation in May 1465, and although he is not always easily distinguished from his son and namesake, he probably also became a knight of the body to Edward IV, and a banneret after the Scottish campaign of 1482; he was also very prominent in local affairs in Cheshire and the north midlands. In 1484, as mayor of Chester, he presided when his sons were made freemen of the city. 

Sir John (V) Savage (d. 1492), who fought for Edward IV at Tewkesbury, became a royal carver and knight of the body, and was second in order of precedence when Edward was buried. He received many important grants, including that of the constableship of Hanley Castle, Worcestershire. As such close supporters of Edward IV, and associates of the Stanleys, it is not surprising that John (V) and his father seem to have been mistrusted by Richard III. Thomas Savage may have been abroad during the latter's reign and possibly acted as the Savages' direct contact with Henry Tudor. According to Polydore Vergil, John (V) was one of those who 'invited' Tudor to invade. He certainly played an important role at Bosworth, where he commanded the left wing. The author of 'Bosworth Feilde' described him and his men, clad in their distinctive white livery hood: '
Sir John Savage, that hardy Knight, 

deathes dentes he delt that day 

with many a white hood in fight, 

that sad men were at assay. 
(Hales and Furnivall, 3.255)' As a result of this support, in 1486 he received an extensive grant in the north midlands of the forfeited estates of John, Lord Zouche, and Francis, Viscount Lovell, valued at $158 p.a. or more. He also received extensive grants of office, especially in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. The support of the Savages for Henry Tudor guaranteed them a growing prominence at court, and at eight out of eleven council meetings for which evidence survives during the period June-July 1486 either John (V), or Thomas, or both, were present. Sir John (V) Savage led the force that seized Humphrey Stafford from sanctuary at Culham in 1486. He married Dorothy, daughter of Sir Ralph Vernon of Haddon, and the marriages of his daughters suggest the extending interest of the family: Alice married Sir William Brereton; Felicia married Robert Milward of Eaton, Derbyshire; Ellen married John Hawarden; and Maud married Sir Robert Needham of Shenton, Shropshire. Sir John (V) Savage was also notable for his illegitimate offspring: George Savage, parson of Davenham, who himself fathered several illegitimate sons, including George Savage, chancellor of Chester, John Wilmslow, archdeacon of Middlesex, and perhaps Edmund Bonner, bishop of London. John (V)'s brothers also enjoyed successful careers: Sir Humphrey established a position in Staffordshire and served in the parliament of 1491-2 as knight of the shire for the county; Sir Edmund was knighted at Leith in May 1544 and married Mary, widow of Roger Legh of Ridge, and daughter and heir of William Sparke of Surrey. 
Yet the Savages suffered the same difficulties as the Stanleys, in spite of their support for the king. When Richard Savage, brother of John (V), failed to appear on a murder charge, his father was imprisoned. Sir John (V) was killed at the siege of Boulogne in 1492, and Sir Humphrey was already suspected of involvement in the activities of Perkin Warbeck in September 1493, when his house was attacked by two royal servants. The Savage family's remarkable success in winning office and land in the north midlands had already made them enemies, most notably (and in spite of John (V)'s marriage) the Vernons of Haddon. For a few years immediately after 1485 the Savages could rely on the support of others with influence in the region, including the Stanleys, to whom they were related. But by March 1494 this alliance had dissolved, as the Stanleys moved to support the Vernons; Stanley violence, most clearly seen in the murder of William Chetwynd in June 1494, may have helped to forge an alliance between the Savages and Henry Willoughby. Yet Savage and Stanley interests had already clashed, most obviously in the Pilkington-Ainsworth dispute over the manor of Mellor on the Derbyshire-Cheshire border. The Savages, and particularly Bishop Savage, pressed the claims of John Ainsworth, although his adversary Robert Pilkington, who relied on the good lordship of the earl of Derby and his heir, claimed to be able to show his ancestors in possession for eight generations. Conflict flared in 1493, when Sir John (IV) Savage distrained the tenants for rents and evicted those who would not pay, and trouble continued intermittently into the next century. The attack on Sir Humphrey in that same year may also reflect his family's residual loyalty to the Yorkist succession, and fears aroused in Cheshire by the intrusion of the council in the marches of Wales into the palatine administration. 
Sir John (IV) Savage died on 22 November 1495 at the age of seventy-three. His grandson Sir John (VI) Savage (d. 1527) succeeded to his father's offices after the latter's death at Boulogne and became a knight for the body by 1501. John (VI) married Anne, daughter and heir of Ralph Bostock, and thereby acquired a claim to the Venables of Kinderton inheritance. Although the Venables interest had the case dismissed from Star Chamber to common law, John (VI) Savage used the influence of the earl of Shrewsbury, Sir Thomas Lovell, and Edmund Dudley to secure victory. With Anne he had seven sons, John (VII), Edward, George, Richard, Lawrence, Roger, and Thomas, and a daughter, Anne, who married Thomas, sixth Baron Berkeley, in 1533. The fall of Sir Humphrey Savage did not affect John (VI)'s career. The most obvious sign of his success at court was the marriage of his heir John (VII) to Elizabeth, the daughter of Charles Somerset, later earl of Worcester. Yet, especially after the death of Archbishop Thomas, the Savages' position was still open to challenge. In 1498 John (VI) lost the stewardship of the High Peak, Derbyshire, and a combination of personal extravagance and royal policy left him in debt to the crown. By 1515 some Savage estates were taken into royal hands to secure payment. 
Although John (VI) provided a contingent for the campaign against France in 1512, and his son Sir John (VII) Savage (d. 1528) led a company in 1513 and was knighted at Tournai, the Savages' continued contempt for royal authority in their regional power bases in the west and north-west soon made them a target for Cardinal Wolsey's determination to administer 'indifferent' justice. The immediate occasion for action against them was the murder on 31 March 1516 by John (VII) and his associates of John Pauncefote, a JP in Worcestershire and potential rival to the Savages in that region. Both Johns were taken into custody in the Tower in June 1516. By the time the two men were brought into king's bench in February 1517 the number of indictments had grown to at least sixty-seven. After a long series of hearings, which also provided the occasion for a radical reinterpretation of the laws of sanctuary, the alleged violation of which had formed the central plank of John (VII)'s response to an appeal of murder, both Johns abandoned their defences, and in November 1520 were granted royal pardons. Clearly, a deal had been concocted behind the scenes, involving the king's sister Mary and John (VII)'s brother-in-law, the earl of Worcester. The settlement was not to the Savages' advantage, however, for John (VI) lost his offices and had substantial fines imposed. For the payment of these nearly all the Savage estates outside Cheshire were entrusted to royal feoffees and leased back to the family at an annual rent of $160, while for additional security those in Cheshire were also taken over by the crown. Despite their consequent heavy indebtedness the Savages seem to have failed to learn their lesson, continuing in subsequent years a long-standing quarrel with Sir Piers Dutton of Halton, and feuding with Ralph Leche over the manor of Ilkeston. John (VI) died in 1527, and his son John (VII) in 1528, only a few months after the crown had foreclosed on his father's debt. John (VI) was probably buried in Macclesfield church, where his son was interred. What was left of the Savage inheritance passed to John (VII)'s infant son, John Savage (died 1597), who grew up 'to be a worshipful Elizabethan gentleman' (Ives, 319).

John died in 1386, leaving an heir, John (II), and three daughters, Elizabeth, Blanche, and Lucy. Margaret survived him and went on to marry Piers Legh, younger son of Robert Legh of Adlington; but it was her Savage descendants to whom she gave the liberty of bearing her arms, argent, four (or five) fusils in pale, sable. 

Sir John (II) Savage (d. 1450) achieved success in royal service. Like his father, he served in France: Froissart records his complaint in 1390 at the tournament of St Inglevert that he had not crossed the sea merely to run one lance. Under Richard II he was appointed keeper of the park of Macclesfield, along with Piers Legh of Macclesfield. Yet he made the transition to the Lancastrian allegiance: soon after Bolingbroke's accession, Savage was granted a fee and in the first year of the reign he led troops in Henry IV's Scottish campaign. John (II) consolidated his interest around Macclesfield, receiving a lease of its mills in 1408, and he was often a justice on eyre in Cheshire. Knighted at Agincourt, in 1418 John (II) led 250 Cheshire men to Calais; he also received significant rewards from a ransom. Early in Henry IV's reign he married Maud, daughter of Robert Swinnarton, heir to a valuable inheritance which included all the lands once held by Hugh Despenser, earl of Winchester, in Staffordshire and Cheshire; these included the manor of Great Barrow, Cheshire. With Maud, John had five sons, John (III), William, Arnold, George, and Roger, and three daughters: Margaret, who married John, eventual heir to Sir Piers Dutton of Dutton; Maud, who married Sir Thomas Booth of Barton; and Isabel, who married Robert Legh of Adlington. In 1428, after Maud's death, John married again. The identity of his second wife is not entirely certain. She has usually been identified as Ellen ('nee' Urswyk), who had previously been the wife first of Robert Molyneux and then of Sir James Harrington. But claims have also been made for her having been the daughter of Sir Ralph Vernon of Shipbrook, and although the evidence for the second identification is meagre, it would help to explain the settlement of Vernon estates upon Sir John and his wife that was made early in Henry VI's reign. Sir John (II) died on 1 August 1450; his son and heir, John (III), was already in full maturity, and the foundations for a transition of power from father to son were laid in 1439 when they were jointly appointed to office in Macclesfield for life. 

John (III) Savage (d. 1463) extended Savage interests by obtaining a stake in the Middlewich salt industry. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Brereton, with whom he had John (IV), his son and heir (born in 1421 or 1422), and three daughters: Margery, who married first Edmund Legh of Baguley, and second Thomas Leycester of Nether Tabley, as his second wife; Margaret, who also married twice, first to John Maxfield, and second to Randle Mainwaring of Carincham, third son of Randle Mainwaring of Peover; and third, Ellen, who married Piers Warburton. John (III) died on 29 July 1463, aged fifty-three, leaving John, his heir, aged forty and more. 
John (II) Savage was retained in 1441-2 by Humphrey Stafford, first duke of Buckingham, but Buckingham's intervention in the politics of Cheshire was short-lived. More productive and long-lasting connections were formed with the houses of York and Stanley. Although there is a possibility that John (III) entered the service of the house of York, it seems more likely that it was his son Sir John (IV) Savage (c.1423-1495) who did so. He was therefore well placed to benefit from Henry VI's deposition. John (III) served as deputy to Sir Thomas Stanley, afterwards Baron Stanley, as steward of the duchy lordship of Halton, Cheshire. John (IV) married Stanley's daughter Katherine; the couple's children were many and prominent. Aside from John (V), Savage's son and heir, there was Thomas Savage (d. 1507), who rose to be bishop of Rochester in 1492, and of London in 1497, and archbishop of York in 1501, Sir Humphrey, Lawrence, James, Sir Edmund, Christopher, William, George, and Richard. His daughters made good matches, with Ellen being married to Peter Legh of Lyme, Katherine to Thomas Legh of Adlington, Margaret to Edmund Trafford of Trafford, Lancashire, Alice to Roger Pilkington (died 1527) ['see under 'Pilkington family], and Elizabeth to John Leek of Langford, Derbyshire. John (IV) was knighted at Elizabeth Woodville's coronation in May 1465, and although he is not always easily distinguished from his son and namesake, he probably also became a knight of the body to Edward IV, and a banneret after the Scottish campaign of 1482; he was also very prominent in local affairs in Cheshire and the north midlands. In 1484, as mayor of Chester, he presided when his sons were made freemen of the city. 

Sir John (V) Savage (d. 1492), who fought for Edward IV at Tewkesbury, became a royal carver and knight of the body, and was second in order of precedence when Edward was buried. He received many important grants, including that of the constableship of Hanley Castle, Worcestershire. As such close supporters of Edward IV, and associates of the Stanleys, it is not surprising that John (V) and his father seem to have been mistrusted by Richard III. Thomas Savage may have been abroad during the latter's reign and possibly acted as the Savages' direct contact with Henry Tudor. According to Polydore Vergil, John (V) was one of those who 'invited' Tudor to invade. He certainly played an important role at Bosworth, where he commanded the left wing. The author of 'Bosworth Feilde' described him and his men, clad in their distinctive white livery hood: '
Sir John Savage, that hardy Knight, 

deathes dentes he delt that day 

with many a white hood in fight, 

that sad men were at assay. 
(Hales and Furnivall, 3.255)' As a result of this support, in 1486 he received an extensive grant in the north midlands of the forfeited estates of John, Lord Zouche, and Francis, Viscount Lovell, valued at $158 p.a. or more. He also received extensive grants of office, especially in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. The support of the Savages for Henry Tudor guaranteed them a growing prominence at court, and at eight out of eleven council meetings for which evidence survives during the period June-July 1486 either John (V), or Thomas, or both, were present. Sir John (V) Savage led the force that seized Humphrey Stafford from sanctuary at Culham in 1486. He married Dorothy, daughter of Sir Ralph Vernon of Haddon, and the marriages of his daughters suggest the extending interest of the family: Alice married Sir William Brereton; Felicia married Robert Milward of Eaton, Derbyshire; Ellen married John Hawarden; and Maud married Sir Robert Needham of Shenton, Shropshire. Sir John (V) Savage was also notable for his illegitimate offspring: George Savage, parson of Davenham, who himself fathered several illegitimate sons, including George Savage, chancellor of Chester, John Wilmslow, archdeacon of Middlesex, and perhaps Edmund Bonner, bishop of London. John (V)'s brothers also enjoyed successful careers: Sir Humphrey established a position in Staffordshire and served in the parliament of 1491-2 as knight of the shire for the county; Sir Edmund was knighted at Leith in May 1544 and married Mary, widow of Roger Legh of Ridge, and daughter and heir of William Sparke of Surrey. 
Yet the Savages suffered the same difficulties as the Stanleys, in spite of their support for the king. When Richard Savage, brother of John (V), failed to appear on a murder charge, his father was imprisoned. Sir John (V) was killed at the siege of Boulogne in 1492, and Sir Humphrey was already suspected of involvement in the activities of Perkin Warbeck in September 1493, when his house was attacked by two royal servants. The Savage family's remarkable success in winning office and land in the north midlands had already made them enemies, most notably (and in spite of John (V)'s marriage) the Vernons of Haddon. For a few years immediately after 1485 the Savages could rely on the support of others with influence in the region, including the Stanleys, to whom they were related. But by March 1494 this alliance had dissolved, as the Stanleys moved to support the Vernons; Stanley violence, most clearly seen in the murder of William Chetwynd in June 1494, may have helped to forge an alliance between the Savages and Henry Willoughby. Yet Savage and Stanley interests had already clashed, most obviously in the Pilkington-Ainsworth dispute over the manor of Mellor on the Derbyshire-Cheshire border. The Savages, and particularly Bishop Savage, pressed the claims of John Ainsworth, although his adversary Robert Pilkington, who relied on the good lordship of the earl of Derby and his heir, claimed to be able to show his ancestors in possession for eight generations. Conflict flared in 1493, when Sir John (IV) Savage distrained the tenants for rents and evicted those who would not pay, and trouble continued intermittently into the next century. The attack on Sir Humphrey in that same year may also reflect his family's residual loyalty to the Yorkist succession, and fears aroused in Cheshire by the intrusion of the council in the marches of Wales into the palatine administration. 
Sir John (IV) Savage died on 22 November 1495 at the age of seventy-three. His grandson Sir John (VI) Savage (d. 1527) succeeded to his father's offices after the latter's death at Boulogne and became a knight for the body by 1501. John (VI) married Anne, daughter and heir of Ralph Bostock, and thereby acquired a claim to the Venables of Kinderton inheritance. Although the Venables interest had the case dismissed from Star Chamber to common law, John (VI) Savage used the influence of the earl of Shrewsbury, Sir Thomas Lovell, and Edmund Dudley to secure victory. With Anne he had seven sons, John (VII), Edward, George, Richard, Lawrence, Roger, and Thomas, and a daughter, Anne, who married Thomas, sixth Baron Berkeley, in 1533. The fall of Sir Humphrey Savage did not affect John (VI)'s career. The most obvious sign of his success at court was the marriage of his heir John (VII) to Elizabeth, the daughter of Charles Somerset, later earl of Worcester. Yet, especially after the death of Archbishop Thomas, the Savages' position was still open to challenge. In 1498 John (VI) lost the stewardship of the High Peak, Derbyshire, and a combination of personal extravagance and royal policy left him in debt to the crown. By 1515 some Savage estates were taken into royal hands to secure payment. 
Although John (VI) provided a contingent for the campaign against France in 1512, and his son Sir John (VII) Savage (d. 1528) led a company in 1513 and was knighted at Tournai, the Savages' continued contempt for royal authority in their regional power bases in the west and north-west soon made them a target for Cardinal Wolsey's determination to administer 'indifferent' justice. The immediate occasion for action against them was the murder on 31 March 1516 by John (VII) and his associates of John Pauncefote, a JP in Worcestershire and potential rival to the Savages in that region. Both Johns were taken into custody in the Tower in June 1516. By the time the two men were brought into king's bench in February 1517 the number of indictments had grown to at least sixty-seven. After a long series of hearings, which also provided the occasion for a radical reinterpretation of the laws of sanctuary, the alleged violation of which had formed the central plank of John (VII)'s response to an appeal of murder, both Johns abandoned their defences, and in November 1520 were granted royal pardons. Clearly, a deal had been concocted behind the scenes, involving the king's sister Mary and John (VII)'s brother-in-law, the earl of Worcester. The settlement was not to the Savages' advantage, however, for John (VI) lost his offices and had substantial fines imposed. For the payment of these nearly all the Savage estates outside Cheshire were entrusted to royal feoffees and leased back to the family at an annual rent of $160, while for additional security those in Cheshire were also taken over by the crown. Despite their consequent heavy indebtedness the Savages seem to have failed to learn their lesson, continuing in subsequent years a long-standing quarrel with Sir Piers Dutton of Halton, and feuding with Ralph Leche over the manor of Ilkeston. John (VI) died in 1527, and his son John (VII) in 1528, only a few months after the crown had foreclosed on his father's debt. John (VI) was probably buried in Macclesfield church, where his son was interred. What was left of the Savage inheritance passed to John (VII)'s infant son, John Savage (died 1597), who grew up 'to be a worshipful Elizabethan gentleman' (Ives, 319).

Savage family (per. c.1369-1528), gentry, originated in Derbyshire.

Thomas Savage may have been abroad during the latter's reign and possibly acted as the Savages' direct contact with Henry Tudor. According to Polydore Vergil, John (V) was one of those who 'invited' Tudor to invade. He certainly played an important role at Bosworth, where he commanded the left wing. The author of 'Bosworth Feilde' described him and his men, clad in their distinctive white livery hood: '
Sir John Savage, that hardy Knight, 

deathes dentes he delt that day 

with many a white hood in fight, 

that sad men were at assay. 
(Hales and Furnivall, 3.255)' As a result of this support, in 1486 he received an extensive grant in the north midlands of the forfeited estates of John, Lord Zouche, and Francis, Viscount Lovell, valued at $158 p.a. or more. He also received extensive grants of office, especially in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. The support of the Savages for Henry Tudor guaranteed them a growing prominence at court, and at eight out of eleven council meetings for which evidence survives during the period June-July 1486 either John (V), or Thomas, or both, were present. Sir John (V) Savage led the force that seized Humphrey Stafford from sanctuary at Culham in 1486. He married Dorothy, daughter of Sir Ralph Vernon of Haddon, and the marriages of his daughters suggest the extending interest of the family: Alice married Sir William Brereton; Felicia married Robert Milward of Eaton, Derbyshire; Ellen married John Hawarden; and Maud married Sir Robert Needham of Shenton, Shropshire. Sir John (V) Savage was also notable for his illegitimate offspring: George Savage, parson of Davenham, who himself fathered several illegitimate sons, including George Savage, chancellor of Chester, John Wilmslow, archdeacon of Middlesex, and perhaps Edmund Bonner, bishop of London. John (V)'s brothers also enjoyed successful careers: Sir Humphrey established a position in Staffordshire and served in the parliament of 1491-2 as knight of the shire for the county; Sir Edmund was knighted at Leith in May 1544 and married Mary, widow of Roger Legh of Ridge, and daughter and heir of William Sparke of Surrey. 
Yet the Savages suffered the same difficulties as the Stanleys, in spite of their support for the king. When Richard Savage, brother of John (V), failed to appear on a murder charge, his father was imprisoned. Sir John (V) was killed at the siege of Boulogne in 1492, and Sir Humphrey was already suspected of involvement in the activities of Perkin Warbeck in September 1493, when his house was attacked by two royal servants. The Savage family's remarkable success in winning office and land in the north midlands had already made them enemies, most notably (and in spite of John (V)'s marriage) the Vernons of Haddon. For a few years immediately after 1485 the Savages could rely on the support of others with influence in the region, including the Stanleys, to whom they were related. But by March 1494 this alliance had dissolved, as the Stanleys moved to support the Vernons; Stanley violence, most clearly seen in the murder of William Chetwynd in June 1494, may have helped to forge an alliance between the Savages and Henry Willoughby. Yet Savage and Stanley interests had already clashed, most obviously in the Pilkington-Ainsworth dispute over the manor of Mellor on the Derbyshire-Cheshire border. The Savages, and particularly Bishop Savage, pressed the claims of John Ainsworth, although his adversary Robert Pilkington, who relied on the good lordship of the earl of Derby and his heir, claimed to be able to show his ancestors in possession for eight generations. Conflict flared in 1493, when Sir John (IV) Savage distrained the tenants for rents and evicted those who would not pay, and trouble continued intermittently into the next century. The attack on Sir Humphrey in that same year may also reflect his family's residual loyalty to the Yorkist succession, and fears aroused in Cheshire by the intrusion of the council in the marches of Wales into the palatine administration. 
Sir John (IV) Savage died on 22 November 1495 at the age of seventy-three. His grandson Sir John (VI) Savage (d. 1527) succeeded to his father's offices after the latter's death at Boulogne and became a knight for the body by 1501. John (VI) married Anne, daughter and heir of Ralph Bostock, and thereby acquired a claim to the Venables of Kinderton inheritance. Although the Venables interest had the case dismissed from Star Chamber to common law, John (VI) Savage used the influence of the earl of Shrewsbury, Sir Thomas Lovell, and Edmund Dudley to secure victory. With Anne he had seven sons, John (VII), Edward, George, Richard, Lawrence, Roger, and Thomas, and a daughter, Anne, who married Thomas, sixth Baron Berkeley, in 1533. The fall of Sir Humphrey Savage did not affect John (VI)'s career. The most obvious sign of his success at court was the marriage of his heir John (VII) to Elizabeth, the daughter of Charles Somerset, later earl of Worcester. Yet, especially after the death of Archbishop Thomas, the Savages' position was still open to challenge. In 1498 John (VI) lost the stewardship of the High Peak, Derbyshire, and a combination of personal extravagance and royal policy left him in debt to the crown. By 1515 some Savage estates were taken into royal hands to secure payment. 
Although John (VI) provided a contingent for the campaign against France in 1512, and his son Sir John (VII) Savage (d. 1528) led a company in 1513 and was knighted at Tournai, the Savages' continued contempt for royal authority in their regional power bases in the west and north-west soon made them a target for Cardinal Wolsey's determination to administer 'indifferent' justice. The immediate occasion for action against them was the murder on 31 March 1516 by John (VII) and his associates of John Pauncefote, a JP in Worcestershire and potential rival to the Savages in that region. Both Johns were taken into custody in the Tower in June 1516. By the time the two men were brought into king's bench in February 1517 the number of indictments had grown to at least sixty-seven. After a long series of hearings, which also provided the occasion for a radical reinterpretation of the laws of sanctuary, the alleged violation of which had formed the central plank of John (VII)'s response to an appeal of murder, both Johns abandoned their defences, and in November 1520 were granted royal pardons. Clearly, a deal had been concocted behind the scenes, involving the king's sister Mary and John (VII)'s brother-in-law, the earl of Worcester. The settlement was not to the Savages' advantage, however, for John (VI) lost his offices and had substantial fines imposed. For the payment of these nearly all the Savage estates outside Cheshire were entrusted to royal feoffees and leased back to the family at an annual rent of $160, while for additional security those in Cheshire were also taken over by the crown. Despite their consequent heavy indebtedness the Savages seem to have failed to learn their lesson, continuing in subsequent years a long-standing quarrel with Sir Piers Dutton of Halton, and feuding with Ralph Leche over the manor of Ilkeston. John (VI) died in 1527, and his son John (VII) in 1528, only a few months after the crown had foreclosed on his father's debt. John (VI) was probably buried in Macclesfield church, where his son was interred. What was left of the Savage inheritance passed to John (VII)'s infant son, John Savage (died 1597), who grew up 'to be a worshipful Elizabethan gentleman' (Ives, 319).

Jevon, Rachel (bap. 1627), poet, was baptized on 23 January 1627 in Broom, Worcester, the daughter of Daniell Jevon (died 1654), rector of Broom, and his wife, Elizabeth. In his will dated 1649 Daniell Jevon named his wife, Elizabeth, their daughter Elizabeth and her husband, Robert Cooper, a brother, Thomas Jevon of Stowbridge, and a cousin, Thomas Scott of the Overhouse in Barre. He declared other (unnamed) children as heirs with his wife. Beyond the parish record of Rachel's baptism, only four other known documents witness her name and life. The main two are her poems, one Latin and one English, congratulating Charles II on his restoration ('Exultationis carmen' and 'Carmen 'thriambeutikon'', each printed in 1660). The other two are petitions to the king dated May(?) 1662, one for 'the place of one of the meanest servants about the Queen' and the other for 'the place of Rocker to the Queen'. The first petition informs that her father, 'a loyal clergyman in the diocese of Worcester, though threatened and imprisoned, contrived to preserve his flock, so that not one took arms against His Majesty, but could only give his children education, without maintenance'. 
The more concise Latin poem (138 hexameter lines) probably preceded Jevon's more expansive English version (190 lines of iambic pentameter couplets). Both 'exultation' poems have much the same order of contents: humble presentation of the poem to Charles; his royal lineage; his providential escape after defeat at Worcester and travels on the continent; his triumphal return to England; celebration of Charles, the king, as a spirit of peace and spring, wearing five crowns and figured as bridegroom, royal lion, royal oak, King David, and star (sun). Both poems exhibit considerable education (unusual for a woman then), in verbal and versifying skills, rhetorical devices, and allusions to biblical and classical literature. Both express enthusiastic loyalty to the monarchy and Charles. Congruence between Jevon's (English) congratulatory poem and the petitions two years later led Elaine Hobby to conclude that the poem 'was not the naive outpouring that it might at first appear'. It seemed rather 'a planned strategy of publicizing her learning, loyalism and humility', in order to win a position (Hobby, 19). Rachel's petitions for a position in service to the queen came with Charles's marriage to Catherine of Braganza in May 1662. Whether she received such a position is not known.

Dinham family (per. c.1200-c.1500), gentry, was in origin a branch of the Breton family of Dinan, named from the seigneurie of Dinan. The Breton Dinans formed part of a group of baronial families whose seats were located in north-east Brittany, bordering on western Normandy, and whose allegiances were consequently courted by the rulers of Normandy and post-conquest England. The Norman chronicler Wace, probably writing early in Henry II's reign, lists the Dinans among those who participated in the Norman conquest of England; but the first evidence for the family's presence in England is provided by a charter of 1122 of the Breton lord Geoffroi de Dinan, recording his grant of two manors in Devon (Harpford and Nutwell, previously granted to Geoffroi by Henry I) to the Norman monastery of Marmoutier, for the support of its Breton priory of St Malo at Dinan. Although there would later be claims for a greater antiquity for the Dinans in Britain, it is clear that they arrived among the 'new men' promoted by Henry I. 
Geoffroi de Dinan had three sons, Olivier, Alain, and Josselin, all of whom had significant interests in both England and Brittany. The pipe roll of 1130 shows that the English lands of Olivier, the eldest, were located exclusively in Devon, and it was in south-west England that his descendants were to be increasingly ensconced. Their main seat was to be the large manor of Hartland, on Devon's north coast, and it was there that an earlier college of secular canons was to be refounded as an Augustinian abbey some time before 1169. The refoundation was largely the responsibility of Geoffroi's grandson, another Olivier de Dinan, and his son Geoffrey, but they also had the co-operation of another Geoffroi de Dinan, whose interests lay principally in Brittany. However, by the late twelfth century the Breton and English lines of the family had decisively diverged, and in the following century the Dinhams of Hartland, as they came to be called, start to become prominent in English national life. 
The process is to be associated above all with Oliver de Dinham, Lord Dinham (c.1234-1299), the great-great-grandson of Olivier, the founder of Hartland. Like several of his descendants he was active as a soldier. In March 1264 he was summoned to Oxford for operations against Simon de Montfort, and continued to support the king during the civil war, notably as constable of Exeter Castle later in 1264. A knight by 1271, he had the custody of Lundy island between 1272 and 1275. Under Edward I he campaigned in Wales in 1277 and 1282, and only ill health prevented his serving there again in 1295. He was frequently appointed to commissions in Devon. It was probably a determination to safeguard his interests which led Dinham into a dispute with Hartland Abbey. In 1272, following the death of the abbot, Dinham occupied the abbey, and was only persuaded to withdraw by the bishop of Exeter. He was also active in augmenting his estates. He repurchased the two manors once given to Marmoutier, and between 1268 and 1272 bought several Cornish manors from Isolda of Cardinham, including Cardinham itself. But he made his greatest contribution to his family's standing through his marriage, apparently his second, to Isabel, widow of Sir John Courtenay of Okehampton, and daughter of Hugh de Vere, earl of Oxford. Their union, which had taken place by 1277, cost Dinham $100. Royal service and aristocratic connections no doubt account for the personal summonses to parliament which Dinham received in 1295 and 1296, in consequence of which he is regarded as having become Lord Dinham. When Oliver de Dinham died, on 26 February 1299, he held four manors in Devon, three in Cornwall, and one in Somerset. 
Oliver was succeeded by his son Joce de Dinham (1273x5-1301), who was probably the child of his father's first marriage, born between 1273 and 1275 according to different accounts of his age at his father's death. He was summoned to serve in Scotland in 1300, but his death on 30 March 1301 ruled out any possibility of a summons to parliament. He followed his father, however, in making an advantageous marriage, to Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir Richard de Hydon of Clayhidon and Hemyock, though the benefits to his descendants were slow to become apparent. Joce had two sons with Margaret, John and Oliver, and it was the latter who succeeded to Clayhidon and Hemyock, which only reverted to John's descendants at the end of the fourteenth century. A minor until 1316, John [i] Dinham (1295-1331/2), was also a soldier, receiving several summonses to campaigns in Scotland, and also to service in Aquitaine in 1325. He was a commissioner of the peace in Devon in 1327 and 1331. But public service was overshadowed by the scandal of his private life. Although married to Margaret, possibly the daughter of Sir William Grandson, John was by 1329 involved in a liaison with Matilda Moleton, said to be his kinswoman. For this he was excommunicated by Bishop Grandison. Dinham appealed, and proceedings were only brought to an end in October 1331, when he was absolved by the archbishop of Canterbury, and went on pilgrimage by way of penance. He did not return, having died some time before 15 April 1332. 
His affair with Matilda Moleton notwithstanding, John [i] Dinham left a legitimate heir, Sir John [ii] Dinham (1317/18-1383), who was a minor at his father's death. Although he had been knighted by 1346, he does not appear to have served in Edward III's French campaigns, and he played relatively little part in local government, in 1359 obtaining exemption from jury service and office-holding. Instead he appears to have concentrated on the consolidation and extension of his estates, long reduced by the dowers of his grandmother and mother, who lived until 1357 and 1361 respectively. He made a particularly advantageous marriage, to Muriel, daughter of Sir Thomas Courtenay of Woodhuish, which renewed his own family's links with that of the earls of Devon, and brought him a number of manors, above all that of Kingskerswell; she died in 1374. In 1379 Dinham was said to hold twenty-six knights' fees in Devon and Cornwall. 
John [ii] Dinham died on 7 January 1383, killed by two 'notorious' thieves, probably in Somerset. His death was speedily avenged by his son, Sir John [iii] Dinham (1358/9-1428), who, then aged twenty-four, slew one of his father's killers and captured the other in Exeter Cathedral, shedding blood in the process. This violent act was one of many in which John [iii] was to be involved. Following a dispute with the abbot of Hartland, in 1397 he was bound in the sum of 1000 marks to keep the peace, only to commit assaults in 1402 and 1404 which cost him 700 marks for a royal pardon. He quarrelled again with the abbey at the end of his life, over his rights as patron in times of vacancy, but the dispute was resolved in 1428. Unlike his immediate forebears, John [iii] had links with the court, perhaps through the Courtenays. Already a knight at his father's death, in 1382 he attended Richard II's wedding, giving a party for his friends before he left for Westminster. Under Henry IV he was appointed to the escort accompanying the king's daughter Blanche to Germany for her marriage, though in the end he did not go, and he came to be styled 'king's knight'. A taste for luxury, deducible from his use of hunting arrows bound with gold, may bespeak the courtier. But Dinham was also a useful royal servant in his homeland, being several times appointed to commissions in Devon. In 1401 he obtained exemption from jury service and office-holding, but was still a commissioner of the peace in 1402 and a commissioner of array in 1418 and 1421. 
Sir John [iii] married three times: his first wife was Eleanor (surname unknown), who died between 1387 and 1396; his second was Maud Mautravers, widow of Sir Peter de la Mare, who brought half the Dorset manor of Hooke to the Dinhams, and who died in 1402; and the third was Philippa, daughter of Sir John Lovell. Philippa was the mother of John Dinham's son and heir, but her husband had earlier shown himself concerned for the descent of his estates. In 1398 he had the manors of Kingskerswell and Nutwell conveyed jointly to his wife Maud and himself, and in 1401 he conveyed what seem to have been all his lands to feoffees, who still held them at his death. His evident concern for his family's possessions makes John [iii] the likeliest compiler of the Dinham cartulary (BL, Add. MS 34792A). 
In 1400 John [iii] was reported to be suffering from 'a bloody flux', but he clearly rallied, dying only on Christmas day 1428. His son and heir, Sir John [iv] Dinham (1405/6-1458), was then twenty-two. The fact that his mother lived until 1465, in occupation of her dower lands, may have been one reason why John [iv] took a more active part in public life than his father had done. A knight by 1 May 1430, he attended the young Henry VI to France in that year, and in 1436 was retained to serve at the relief of Calais with eleven men-at-arms and seventy-two archers. Regularly a JP in Devon from 1440, he frequently acted in the same capacity in Cornwall, and received numerous other commissions in both counties. Many of these were for military or peace-keeping purposes, but he was also appointed to assess a subsidy in 1436, to raise a loan to the crown in 1446, and to raise money for the defence of Calais in 1455. During the 1450s he seems to have remained loyal to Henry VI, a fact which makes his son's eventual Yorkism the more surprising. John [iv] married Joan, daughter of Sir Richard Arches, a match which brought him lands in Oxfordshire. He died on 25 January 1458, and was long outlived by his widow, who died early in 1497. Their son, John Dynham (c.1433-1501), would enter the peerage as Lord Dynham, though his title, like that of Oliver two centuries earlier, endured only for a single generation.

Their main seat was to be the large manor of Hartland, on Devon's north coast, and it was there that an earlier college of secular canons was to be refounded as an Augustinian abbey some time before 1169. The refoundation was largely the responsibility of Geoffroi's grandson, another Olivier de Dinan, and his son Geoffrey, but they also had the co-operation of another Geoffroi de Dinan, whose interests lay principally in Brittany. However, by the late twelfth century the Breton and English lines of the family had decisively diverged, and in the following century the Dinhams of Hartland, as they came to be called, start to become prominent in English national life. 
The process is to be associated above all with Oliver de Dinham, Lord Dinham (c.1234-1299), the great-great-grandson of Olivier, the founder of Hartland. Like several of his descendants he was active as a soldier. In March 1264 he was summoned to Oxford for operations against Simon de Montfort, and continued to support the king during the civil war, notably as constable of Exeter Castle later in 1264. A knight by 1271, he had the custody of Lundy island between 1272 and 1275. Under Edward I he campaigned in Wales in 1277 and 1282, and only ill health prevented his serving there again in 1295. He was frequently appointed to commissions in Devon. It was probably a determination to safeguard his interests which led Dinham into a dispute with Hartland Abbey. In 1272, following the death of the abbot, Dinham occupied the abbey, and was only persuaded to withdraw by the bishop of Exeter. He was also active in augmenting his estates. He repurchased the two manors once given to Marmoutier, and between 1268 and 1272 bought several Cornish manors from Isolda of Cardinham, including Cardinham itself. But he made his greatest contribution to his family's standing through his marriage, apparently his second, to Isabel, widow of Sir John Courtenay of Okehampton, and daughter of Hugh de Vere, earl of Oxford. Their union, which had taken place by 1277, cost Dinham $100. Royal service and aristocratic connections no doubt account for the personal summonses to parliament which Dinham received in 1295 and 1296, in consequence of which he is regarded as having become Lord Dinham. When Oliver de Dinham died, on 26 February 1299, he held four manors in Devon, three in Cornwall, and one in Somerset. 
Oliver was succeeded by his son Joce de Dinham (1273x5-1301), who was probably the child of his father's first marriage, born between 1273 and 1275 according to different accounts of his age at his father's death. He was summoned to serve in Scotland in 1300, but his death on 30 March 1301 ruled out any possibility of a summons to parliament. He followed his father, however, in making an advantageous marriage, to Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir Richard de Hydon of Clayhidon and Hemyock, though the benefits to his descendants were slow to become apparent. Joce had two sons with Margaret, John and Oliver, and it was the latter who succeeded to Clayhidon and Hemyock, which only reverted to John's descendants at the end of the fourteenth century. A minor until 1316, John [i] Dinham (1295-1331/2), was also a soldier, receiving several summonses to campaigns in Scotland, and also to service in Aquitaine in 1325. He was a commissioner of the peace in Devon in 1327 and 1331. But public service was overshadowed by the scandal of his private life. Although married to Margaret, possibly the daughter of Sir William Grandson, John was by 1329 involved in a liaison with Matilda Moleton, said to be his kinswoman. For this he was excommunicated by Bishop Grandison. Dinham appealed, and proceedings were only brought to an end in October 1331, when he was absolved by the archbishop of Canterbury, and went on pilgrimage by way of penance. He did not return, having died some time before 15 April 1332. 
His affair with Matilda Moleton notwithstanding, John [i] Dinham left a legitimate heir, Sir John [ii] Dinham (1317/18-1383), who was a minor at his father's death. Although he had been knighted by 1346, he does not appear to have served in Edward III's French campaigns, and he played relatively little part in local government, in 1359 obtaining exemption from jury service and office-holding. Instead he appears to have concentrated on the consolidation and extension of his estates, long reduced by the dowers of his grandmother and mother, who lived until 1357 and 1361 respectively. He made a particularly advantageous marriage, to Muriel, daughter of Sir Thomas Courtenay of Woodhuish, which renewed his own family's links with that of the earls of Devon, and brought him a number of manors, above all that of Kingskerswell; she died in 1374. In 1379 Dinham was said to hold twenty-six knights' fees in Devon and Cornwall. 
John [ii] Dinham died on 7 January 1383, killed by two 'notorious' thieves, probably in Somerset. His death was speedily avenged by his son, Sir John [iii] Dinham (1358/9-1428), who, then aged twenty-four, slew one of his father's killers and captured the other in Exeter Cathedral, shedding blood in the process. This violent act was one of many in which John [iii] was to be involved. Following a dispute with the abbot of Hartland, in 1397 he was bound in the sum of 1000 marks to keep the peace, only to commit assaults in 1402 and 1404 which cost him 700 marks for a royal pardon. He quarrelled again with the abbey at the end of his life, over his rights as patron in times of vacancy, but the dispute was resolved in 1428. Unlike his immediate forebears, John [iii] had links with the court, perhaps through the Courtenays. Already a knight at his father's death, in 1382 he attended Richard II's wedding, giving a party for his friends before he left for Westminster. Under Henry IV he was appointed to the escort accompanying the king's daughter Blanche to Germany for her marriage, though in the end he did not go, and he came to be styled 'king's knight'. A taste for luxury, deducible from his use of hunting arrows bound with gold, may bespeak the courtier. But Dinham was also a useful royal servant in his homeland, being several times appointed to commissions in Devon. In 1401 he obtained exemption from jury service and office-holding, but was still a commissioner of the peace in 1402 and a commissioner of array in 1418 and 1421. 
Sir John [iii] married three times: his first wife was Eleanor (surname unknown), who died between 1387 and 1396; his second was Maud Mautravers, widow of Sir Peter de la Mare, who brought half the Dorset manor of Hooke to the Dinhams, and who died in 1402; and the third was Philippa, daughter of Sir John Lovell. Philippa was the mother of John Dinham's son and heir, but her husband had earlier shown himself concerned for the descent of his estates. In 1398 he had the manors of Kingskerswell and Nutwell conveyed jointly to his wife Maud and himself, and in 1401 he conveyed what seem to have been all his lands to feoffees, who still held them at his death. His evident concern for his family's possessions makes John [iii] the likeliest compiler of the Dinham cartulary (BL, Add. MS 34792A). 
In 1400 John [iii] was reported to be suffering from 'a bloody flux', but he clearly rallied, dying only on Christmas day 1428. His son and heir, Sir John [iv] Dinham (1405/6-1458), was then twenty-two. The fact that his mother lived until 1465, in occupation of her dower lands, may have been one reason why John [iv] took a more active part in public life than his father had done. A knight by 1 May 1430, he attended the young Henry VI to France in that year, and in 1436 was retained to serve at the relief of Calais with eleven men-at-arms and seventy-two archers. Regularly a JP in Devon from 1440, he frequently acted in the same capacity in Cornwall, and received numerous other commissions in both counties. Many of these were for military or peace-keeping purposes, but he was also appointed to assess a subsidy in 1436, to raise a loan to the crown in 1446, and to raise money for the defence of Calais in 1455. During the 1450s he seems to have remained loyal to Henry VI, a fact which makes his son's eventual Yorkism the more surprising. John [iv] married Joan, daughter of Sir Richard Arches, a match which brought him lands in Oxfordshire. He died on 25 January 1458, and was long outlived by his widow, who died early in 1497. Their son, John Dynham (c.1433-1501), would enter the peerage as Lord Dynham, though his title, like that of Oliver two centuries earlier, endured only for a single generation.

Dinham family (per. c.1200-c.1500), gentry, was in origin a branch of the Breton family of Dinan, named from the seigneurie of Dinan. The Breton Dinans formed part of a group of baronial families whose seats were located in north-east Brittany, bordering on western Normandy, and whose allegiances were consequently courted by the rulers of Normandy and post-conquest England. The Norman chronicler Wace, probably writing early in Henry II's reign, lists the Dinans among those who participated in the Norman conquest of England; but the first evidence for the family's presence in England is provided by a charter of 1122 of the Breton lord Geoffroi de Dinan, recording his grant of two manors in Devon (Harpford and Nutwell, previously granted to Geoffroi by Henry I) to the Norman monastery of Marmoutier, for the support of its Breton priory of St Malo at Dinan. Although there would later be claims for a greater antiquity for the Dinans in Britain, it is clear that they arrived among the 'new men' promoted by Henry I.

The refoundation was largely the responsibility of Geoffroi's grandson, another Olivier de Dinan, and his son Geoffrey, but they also had the co-operation of another Geoffroi de Dinan, whose interests lay principally in Brittany. However, by the late twelfth century the Breton and English lines of the family had decisively diverged, and in the following century the Dinhams of Hartland, as they came to be called, start to become prominent in English national life. 
The process is to be associated above all with Oliver de Dinham, Lord Dinham (c.1234-1299), the great-great-grandson of Olivier, the founder of Hartland. Like several of his descendants he was active as a soldier. In March 1264 he was summoned to Oxford for operations against Simon de Montfort, and continued to support the king during the civil war, notably as constable of Exeter Castle later in 1264. A knight by 1271, he had the custody of Lundy island between 1272 and 1275. Under Edward I he campaigned in Wales in 1277 and 1282, and only ill health prevented his serving there again in 1295. He was frequently appointed to commissions in Devon. It was probably a determination to safeguard his interests which led Dinham into a dispute with Hartland Abbey. In 1272, following the death of the abbot, Dinham occupied the abbey, and was only persuaded to withdraw by the bishop of Exeter. He was also active in augmenting his estates. He repurchased the two manors once given to Marmoutier, and between 1268 and 1272 bought several Cornish manors from Isolda of Cardinham, including Cardinham itself. But he made his greatest contribution to his family's standing through his marriage, apparently his second, to Isabel, widow of Sir John Courtenay of Okehampton, and daughter of Hugh de Vere, earl of Oxford. Their union, which had taken place by 1277, cost Dinham $100. Royal service and aristocratic connections no doubt account for the personal summonses to parliament which Dinham received in 1295 and 1296, in consequence of which he is regarded as having become Lord Dinham. When Oliver de Dinham died, on 26 February 1299, he held four manors in Devon, three in Cornwall, and one in Somerset. 
Oliver was succeeded by his son Joce de Dinham (1273x5-1301), who was probably the child of his father's first marriage, born between 1273 and 1275 according to different accounts of his age at his father's death. He was summoned to serve in Scotland in 1300, but his death on 30 March 1301 ruled out any possibility of a summons to parliament. He followed his father, however, in making an advantageous marriage, to Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir Richard de Hydon of Clayhidon and Hemyock, though the benefits to his descendants were slow to become apparent. Joce had two sons with Margaret, John and Oliver, and it was the latter who succeeded to Clayhidon and Hemyock, which only reverted to John's descendants at the end of the fourteenth century. A minor until 1316, John [i] Dinham (1295-1331/2), was also a soldier, receiving several summonses to campaigns in Scotland, and also to service in Aquitaine in 1325. He was a commissioner of the peace in Devon in 1327 and 1331. But public service was overshadowed by the scandal of his private life. Although married to Margaret, possibly the daughter of Sir William Grandson, John was by 1329 involved in a liaison with Matilda Moleton, said to be his kinswoman. For this he was excommunicated by Bishop Grandison. Dinham appealed, and proceedings were only brought to an end in October 1331, when he was absolved by the archbishop of Canterbury, and went on pilgrimage by way of penance. He did not return, having died some time before 15 April 1332. 
His affair with Matilda Moleton notwithstanding, John [i] Dinham left a legitimate heir, Sir John [ii] Dinham (1317/18-1383), who was a minor at his father's death. Although he had been knighted by 1346, he does not appear to have served in Edward III's French campaigns, and he played relatively little part in local government, in 1359 obtaining exemption from jury service and office-holding. Instead he appears to have concentrated on the consolidation and extension of his estates, long reduced by the dowers of his grandmother and mother, who lived until 1357 and 1361 respectively. He made a particularly advantageous marriage, to Muriel, daughter of Sir Thomas Courtenay of Woodhuish, which renewed his own family's links with that of the earls of Devon, and brought him a number of manors, above all that of Kingskerswell; she died in 1374. In 1379 Dinham was said to hold twenty-six knights' fees in Devon and Cornwall. 
John [ii] Dinham died on 7 January 1383, killed by two 'notorious' thieves, probably in Somerset. His death was speedily avenged by his son, Sir John [iii] Dinham (1358/9-1428), who, then aged twenty-four, slew one of his father's killers and captured the other in Exeter Cathedral, shedding blood in the process. This violent act was one of many in which John [iii] was to be involved. Following a dispute with the abbot of Hartland, in 1397 he was bound in the sum of 1000 marks to keep the peace, only to commit assaults in 1402 and 1404 which cost him 700 marks for a royal pardon. He quarrelled again with the abbey at the end of his life, over his rights as patron in times of vacancy, but the dispute was resolved in 1428. Unlike his immediate forebears, John [iii] had links with the court, perhaps through the Courtenays. Already a knight at his father's death, in 1382 he attended Richard II's wedding, giving a party for his friends before he left for Westminster. Under Henry IV he was appointed to the escort accompanying the king's daughter Blanche to Germany for her marriage, though in the end he did not go, and he came to be styled 'king's knight'. A taste for luxury, deducible from his use of hunting arrows bound with gold, may bespeak the courtier. But Dinham was also a useful royal servant in his homeland, being several times appointed to commissions in Devon. In 1401 he obtained exemption from jury service and office-holding, but was still a commissioner of the peace in 1402 and a commissioner of array in 1418 and 1421. 
Sir John [iii] married three times: his first wife was Eleanor (surname unknown), who died between 1387 and 1396; his second was Maud Mautravers, widow of Sir Peter de la Mare, who brought half the Dorset manor of Hooke to the Dinhams, and who died in 1402; and the third was Philippa, daughter of Sir John Lovell. Philippa was the mother of John Dinham's son and heir, but her husband had earlier shown himself concerned for the descent of his estates. In 1398 he had the manors of Kingskerswell and Nutwell conveyed jointly to his wife Maud and himself, and in 1401 he conveyed what seem to have been all his lands to feoffees, who still held them at his death. His evident concern for his family's possessions makes John [iii] the likeliest compiler of the Dinham cartulary (BL, Add. MS 34792A). 
In 1400 John [iii] was reported to be suffering from 'a bloody flux', but he clearly rallied, dying only on Christmas day 1428. His son and heir, Sir John [iv] Dinham (1405/6-1458), was then twenty-two. The fact that his mother lived until 1465, in occupation of her dower lands, may have been one reason why John [iv] took a more active part in public life than his father had done. A knight by 1 May 1430, he attended the young Henry VI to France in that year, and in 1436 was retained to serve at the relief of Calais with eleven men-at-arms and seventy-two archers. Regularly a JP in Devon from 1440, he frequently acted in the same capacity in Cornwall, and received numerous other commissions in both counties. Many of these were for military or peace-keeping purposes, but he was also appointed to assess a subsidy in 1436, to raise a loan to the crown in 1446, and to raise money for the defence of Calais in 1455. During the 1450s he seems to have remained loyal to Henry VI, a fact which makes his son's eventual Yorkism the more surprising. John [iv] married Joan, daughter of Sir Richard Arches, a match which brought him lands in Oxfordshire. He died on 25 January 1458, and was long outlived by his widow, who died early in 1497. Their son, John Dynham (c.1433-1501), would enter the peerage as Lord Dynham, though his title, like that of Oliver two centuries earlier, endured only for a single generation.

Barrett, David (1914-1998), Finnish and Georgian scholar and translator, was born on 9 May 1914 at 13 Fleetwood Road, Dollis Hill, London, the son of Frank Piggott Barrett, a stationer's commercial traveller and later a coal merchant's clerk, and his wife, Lilian, 'nee' Crouch, a woman with a remarkable knowledge of London's Wren churches. He was educated at City of London School and read classics at Cambridge, where he was a scholar of Peterhouse. Apart from his eclectic linguistic interests, he was also a good classical musician (chapel organist and amateur pianist), and an active Methodist preacher. In 1936, immediately after graduation, he was appointed a cataloguer at the British Museum (which then included the British Library) and worked on its Finnish holdings, rapidly becoming an expert on Finnish. He visited Finland in August 1937 and gained entry into Finnish literary and graphic artists' circles. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was first entrusted with helping to remove the British Museum's collection, under armed guard, to Wales. Then he was employed first by the Foreign Office, then as a captain in the British army, in intelligence work, specializing in the Balkans as well as Finland. 
In 1946 Barrett became a lector in English at Helsinki University, and produced translations from Finnish verse and prose (some included in 'Voices from Finland', 1947, edited by Elli Tompuri), and a widely used, but still unpublished 'Notes for a Finnish Course' (now in the archives of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, London, and, unfortunately, lacking some thirty pages). On 11 December 1948, on a visit to London, he married Marjorie Anne McPhee ('b'. 1912), daughter of Vincent Joseph McPhee, medical practitioner, but continued working in Helsinki until 1950. Thereafter he spent two years as a lecturer in the American University of Beirut, and four more years in the Foreign Office, acquiring a formidably wide, and in the case of Armenian and Georgian deep, knowledge of a number of oriental languages, including Turkish and Tibetan. From 1956 to 1964 he again taught at the University of Helsinki, before being headhunted by a wartime colleague, Norman Sainsbury, by then keeper of oriental books at the Bodleian Library, to organize and catalogue the Bodleian's Caucasian holdings, notably the Wardrop collection of Georgian books. (While in Helsinki University, whose library had been a depository library for the Russian empire, Barrett had taken a keen interest in Helsinki's uniquely well-preserved collection of Georgian books and periodicals, taught himself the language, and helped catalogue them.) His work over the next decade culminated in his widely admired publication, 'A Catalogue of the Wardrop Collection and of other Georgian Books and Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library' (1973), and he then contributed a Bodleian section to the 'Catalogue of Early Armenian Books, 1512-1850', compiled by Vrej Nersessian of the British Library. Barrett's catalogue of the Minassian collection of Armenian books in Wadham College, Oxford, remained unpublished. 
Barrett's work on Georgian made him an internationally recognized authority on the pride of Georgian literature, Shota Rustaveli's 'The Man in the Panther's Skin', on which he wrote a number of seminal conference and privately circulated papers, one of which for the first time used stylistic analysis to distinguish stanzas by an anonymous 'poetast' from the authentic text of this thirteenth-century romance. He also gave extensive advice to Olavi Linnus, the Finnish translator of the poem, but, with his typical diffidence, kept his light under a bushel. (Typically, his translation of Akaki Shanidze's grammar of Old Georgian remains unpublished.) The Georgian authorities recognized his work by inviting him to visit Georgia in 1975. Unfortunately, the KGB belatedly recalled his war-time intelligence role, and sent a Karelian Finn who had once worked under Barrett to intercept him on a beach near Sukhumi. To the dismay of his Georgian hosts, the KGB then interrogated him and confined him to his hotel room before deporting him. 
At the same time, Barrett became one of the best-known British translators of Aristophanes, several of his translations ('The Wasps', 1964, 'The Birds', 1978, and others) remaining in print ever since publication by Penguin Books. Inexplicably, his version of 'The Lysistrata', though performed publicly at Westminster School, was unpublished. His translations of Aristophanes were unique in their combination of meticulous scholarship, stageability, and metrical ingenuity. His interest in Finnish was maintained, with two publications in 1963 and 1970 in Helsinki on Finnish crafts and design, and subsequently a number of articles in the periodical 'Books from Finland'. 
In 1981 Barrett retired from the Bodleian as senior assistant librarian, but remained a lifelong and indispensable consultant in Caucasian and Central Asian studies. His presence in the Bodleian was always audible, for in the 1990s he was the last librarian to use a manual typewriter. He served on the committee of the Marjory Wardrop Trust, set up to support postgraduate study in Georgian, and with unlimited patience and geniality allowed scholars and would-be scholars of Georgian to pick his brains. In 1983 the Finnish government made him a knight of the White Rose, first class. He lived latterly at Woodlands, Ticknell Lane, Charlbury, Oxfordshire. His wife, Marjorie, died in 1994. He died on 30 April 1998 at the War Memorial Hospital in Chipping Norton, of cancer. He was survived by the three sons of his marriage.

Street, (Cecil) John Charles (1884-1964), army officer and writer of detective stories, was born in Gibraltar on 3 May 1884, the son of General John Alfred Street CB (1822-1889) and his second wife, Caroline, daughter of Charles Horsfall Bill. At the time of Cecil's birth his father was colonel of the 2nd battalion, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), stationed in Cawnpore, Bengal. Educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1901-3), he was commissioned into the Royal Garrison Artillery in July 1903; he served with 23 company at Fort Grange (the western land defences of Portsmouth harbour) and afterwards with 16 company at Clarence barracks in Portsmouth. He resigned his commission on 24 March 1906, one month after marrying Hyacinth Maud (died 1949) of Fareham, Hampshire, daughter of Major John Denis Kirwan RA; in 1911 they were resident in Lyme Regis, Dorset, supported by his private income. 
Following the outbreak of the First World War, Street rejoined the Royal Artillery as a lieutenant in the special reserve in September 1914. He served on the western front with the 23rd siege battery, taking part in the ill-fated battle of Loos in September 1915. On 9 November 1915 he was seriously wounded in the head, and was invalided to England until April 1916, when he returned to France. As acting major, he commanded the 335th siege battery from May until the end of July 1917, when he was severely dazed by a shell burst, but remained on duty for over six hours until collapsing (an action for which he was awarded the MC in January 1918). Following convalescence, but now permanently unfit for active service, he was posted in September 1917 to MI7b, the War Office intelligence section dealing with propaganda, and had responsibility for air-dropped leaflets and newspapers, for which he was made OBE (military) in January 1919. At the end of the war he was briefly employed at the Ministry of Labour before moving to the Irish Office as the London representative of the anti-republican propaganda campaign organized by Basil Clarke, the director of public information in Dublin. Demobilised in March 1919, he relinquished his special reserve commission in November 1920. 
During his periods of convalescence from service on the western front, using the pseudonym F.O.O. (forward observation officer), Street wrote two books on the Royal Artillery, both of which were well received. 'With the Guns' (1916), covering the battle of Loos, was described by 'The Times' as 'a remarkable contribution to the literature of the war' while the 'Pall Mall Gazette' considered it 'one of the best war books that have appeared'. 'The Making of a Gunner', which appeared later in 1916, included a severe indictment of the 'priesthood' of older officers of the Royal Garrison Artillery who 'utterly discouraged any attempt on their part to experiment with guns on wheels... the Coast Defences lost all sight of what would be their true role in time of war and lapsed into a condition of torpid complacency.' Such views perhaps explain his resignation of his commission a decade earlier. 
Street's first foray into fiction was his 1917 semi-autobiographical novel 'The Worldly Hope', again by F.O.O. It was the story of a lieutenant of the Royal Garrison Artillery (special reserve) who arrived in France six weeks before the battle of Loos as senior subaltern to a siege battery. On leaving the army Street continued writing by specializing in strategic and current affairs. In 1921, now writing as I.O. (intelligence officer), he published 'The Administration of Ireland, 1920' and a year later, under his own name, he published 'Ireland in 1921'. As I.O. he also published 'G.Q.G. -- French Headquarters, 1915-1918', a translation from the French of a work by Jean de Pierrefeu. Travelling widely in central Europe, he published under his own name 'Hungary and Democracy' (1923), 'East of Prague' (1924), 'Slovakia Past and Present' (1928), and a biography of Thomas Masaryk (1930). He criticized French behaviour following the peace treaties in 'The Treachery of France' (1924). A biography of Rufus Isaacs, 'Lord Reading', appeared under Street's own name in 1928. 
In 1925 Street published his first detective story, 'The Paddington Mystery', using the pseudonym John Rhode, and in that identity he quickly became one of the leading authors in the golden age of English detective fiction. By 1928 he was also writing other detective and mystery stories using the pseudonym Miles Burton. Thereafter his output was prodigious: in the thirty years from 1930 he published a new detective novel every three months. John Rhode's private detective was the scientist Dr Priestley who advised and assisted Inspector, later Superintendent, Jimmy Waghorn of Scotland Yard, while Miles Burton's detective was Inspector Arnold, who was ably assisted by the inspired amateur sleuth Desmond Merrion. Street's popularity with readers who wanted a challenging plot or mystery continued long after his death although leading critics, particularly H. R. F. Keating, considered his books 'dull', with both 'ingenuity of plot and cardboardity of character' (Keating, 'Bedside Companion to Crime', 223). 
In the early 1930s Street was, with Dorothy L. Sayers, Agatha Christie, Freeman Wills Crofts, and others, an active member of the select Detection Club whose members funded their Gerrard Street premises and their ceremonial club dinners by publishing books with chapters written serially by different members. As John Rhode, Street contributed to their compilations 'The Floating Admiral' (1931) and 'Ask a Policeman' (1933). He contributed a study of the 1860 Constance Kent case to the Detection Club's true crime collection 'The Anatomy of Murder' (1936), having, in 1928, written up the Kent case in the 'Famous Trials' series. In all, from 1925 to 1960 nearly eighty books appeared under the name of John Rhode and another sixty-five under that of Miles Burton. As John Rhode he also edited collections of detective short stories. 
John Street was a generous but intensely private person who seldom spoke of his past, even to friends. In spite of his popular literary success he shunned publicity and, in his final years, became somewhat reclusive. Although internationally known as the author of the John Rhode books, his authorship of those by Miles Burton was not common knowledge in his lifetime, while his use of the pseudonym Cecil Waye was unknown for many years. He lived in Somerset, Norfolk, and then Suffolk, often locating his stories in those areas and frequently using local place names for his supporting characters. During the Second World War he lived in Hawkhurst, Kent, and served as a lieutenant in the Home Guard between 1940 and 1942, an experience he drew upon in his crime novel 'Night Exercise' (1942). His first wife, Hyacinth, died in 1949 and later that year on 9 November, aged sixty-five, he married Eileen Annette Waller (1894/5-1967), the daughter of John Waller, a civil engineer. There were no children of either marriage. In the 1950s Street and his new wife moved to Seaford on the Sussex coast to live near Eileen's relatives. Street himself died of arterial thrombosis on 8 December 1964 at the Leaf Hospital, Eastbourne, and, in accordance with his wishes, was cremated.

Gunsberg, Isidor Arthur (1854-1930), chess player and journalist, was born in Pest, Hungary, the eldest son of Abraham Gunsberg and his wife, Katharine, 'nee' Tapart. Records kept by Hungarian rabbis suggest that Isidor was born on 1 November 1854, but he himself believed his birthday was 2 November. Abraham Gunsberg (or Gunzburg) came to London in 1863 to establish a British agency for the Polish wine grower Count Zelinski, bringing Isidor with him. Family tradition and chess sources suggest that young Isidor spent much of four years in London and Paris before returning to Hungary in 1867. 
Isidor Gunsberg was taught chess by his father, and he was noticed as a promising player in 1867 when they visited Paris during the international chess congress. In 1876 he settled permanently in England, soon becoming a regular player at Purssell's chess rooms and Simpson's Divan. He sometimes played matches for the chess team of the Jewish Workingmen's Club in Aldgate, alongside Abraham Mocatta (1830-1900), an elder of the Sephardic Bevis Marks synagogue, and Edward Nathan Frankenstein (1839-1913), the Liverpool-born chess problem expert, with whom he played several published games in 1877-8. Like them he eventually became a member of the City of London Chess Club. 
Gunsberg's big chance came in 1878, when the inventor Charles Godfrey Gumpel hired him as the secret operator of his Mephisto 'automaton', which was exhibited publicly in London and Brighton after it controversially won the Handicap tournament at the London 1878 meeting of the Counties Chess Association. Gunsberg continued in this role periodically until about 1884. From 1881 to 1883 he also contributed articles and games as Mephisto to the chess column of 'Knowledge', the magazine edited by R. A. Proctor. 
In his first contest with a leading opponent Gunsberg played a match for $10 a side in 1881 with Joseph Blackburne, who conceded him a two-game start. After losing the first two games Gunsberg began playing like a master and the score reached 6-6 before Blackburne won the decider. The result in games actually played was 7-4 with three draws. At the London 1883 chess congress, Gunsberg won a casual game against the Russian champion M. I. Chigorin and then took fourth prize in the secondary tournament sponsored by the maharaja of Vizianagaram, although this was soon followed by a discouraging result in his first international tournament, at Nuremberg in July. 
That autumn Gunsberg wrote several articles on chess for Annie Besant's magazine 'Our Corner' and in October 1884 he began a column in the 'Weekly Echo', which ran for about a year. He subsequently conducted several chess columns simultaneously in newspapers and periodicals. The most important were the 'London Evening News and Post' (1889-94), 'St James's Budget' (1893-1900), the 'Penny Illustrated Paper' (1894-1902), the 'Manchester Guardian' (1906-14), and the 'Daily Telegraph' (1899- 'c'.1929). He also spent three months in 1884 as coach to the Bradford Chess Club, and (probably through acquaintance with the chess amateur Wordsworth Donisthorpe) did office work for the Liberty and Property Defence League, for whom he wrote 'Local Option: an Argument against Teetotal Tyranny' (1888), a reply to the prohibitionist MP W. S. Caine. 
Gunsberg returned to master competition in the summer of 1885, swiftly establishing himself as a chess master by winning tournaments in London and Hamburg. In 1886 a convincing match victory against Henry Bird confirmed his new position among the elite of British chess. After he beat Blackburne 8-5 in a match in 1887 his main rival became Amos Burn, with whom he shared first prize in London after an indecisive play-off. Further master tournament victories followed in Bradford (1888) and London (1889, tied with Bird), although probably a greater achievement was taking third prize in the two-month marathon New York 1889 tournament, ahead of both Blackburne and Burn, and just behind the joint winners, Chigorin and Max Weiss. There he also won the best game prize for his win against the Irish-American master James Mason. Invited to play a match with Chigorin in Havana in 1890, Gunsberg tied it 111/2-111/2. He then challenged the world champion William Steinitz to a title match, played in New York from December 1890 to January 1891, losing by the respectable margin 101/2-81/2. 
Subsequently Gunsberg concentrated chiefly on his journalistic work. The first edition of his book 'Chess Openings' appeared in 1895 and it remained in print for over thirty years. He performed poorly on his comeback in the great 1895 Hastings tournament but in 1900 he achieved second prize in the City of London club's invitational. He competed in master tournaments for the last time at St Petersburg in 1914. After the First World War he only contested minor events. He also did organizational work, in particular running the Ostend 1905 and 1906 international tournaments, the latter being a large multi-stage event, and the 1925 international tournament at Marienbad (Marianske Lazne). 
Gunsberg experienced many personal losses, outliving two wives, and these vicissitudes had an adverse effect on the later course of his chess-playing career. He first married Jane (1852/3-1891), daughter of Asher Isaacs, textile dealer, in the Great Synagogue, London, on 16 November 1879. Three of the six children of this marriage died in infancy, but three sons survived. The eldest, Alfred Gunsberg (1884-1968), assisted his father with his literary work. His first wife died from tuberculosis in May 1891. He married, second, at St George's parish church, Bloomsbury, on 16 December 1893, Miriam (1858-1897), daughter of Thomas Clarke, merchant. With his second wife, a governess from a Humberside family, he had two daughters. She conducted a chess column of her own in the 'Lady's Pictorial' for two years but she also contracted tuberculosis and died in September 1897. On 1 March 1898, at St Jude's parish church, Brixton, he married, third, Agnes Jane (1862-1949), daughter of Peter Ramage, a Swedenborgian minister. They had one daughter, born in 1901. 
Gunsberg habitually lived beyond his means: police investigations during his application for naturalization (obtained on 20 May 1908) revealed a long history of financial problems and defaults. His economic situation was aggravated in 1914, when most newspapers stopped their chess columns at the outbreak of war, but in 1916 he won $250 in libel damages against Associated Newspapers. Several leading players testified that an 'Evening News' article had unfairly criticized errors in his 'Daily Telegraph' problems. After the war life became no easier for an ageing master and in July 1923 he filed for bankruptcy. In 1929 a testimonial, raised for his seventy-fifth birthday, enabled him to be discharged from bankruptcy a few weeks before he died, of heart failure, at his home, 4 Woodfield Avenue, Streatham, London, on 2 May 1930. He was buried in Streatham Park cemetery. 
Small of stature, Gunsberg retained his distinguished good looks into later life and was apparently always popular in the chess world. He was a hard-working man with a keen intelligence who, had his family and financial situation been less precarious, might have sustained a longer career as an international chess player.

Lindo, Abigail (1803-1848), lexicographer, was born in London on 3 August 1803, the third daughter and fifth child of the eighteen children of David Abarbanel Lindo (1772-1852), a prominent Jewish communal worker, and his wife, Sarah (1777-1852), the daughter of Abraham Mocatta and his wife, Esther. Her parents were Sephardi Jews belonging to leading families established in London since the early years of the community in the seventeenth century. She was closely related to the best-known Sephardi Jewish families of the time; Sir Moses Montefiore (1784-1885) was a cousin, and her uncle Ephraim Lindo was a brother-in-law of Disraeli's mother, Maria Basevi. (Her father performed Disraeli's circumcision on 28 December 1804.) Her family home was in Whitechapel, London: first at 15 Leman Street and later at 37 Mansell Street, Goodmanfields, not far from Bevis Marks Synagogue, of which her father was an influential and strictly Orthodox member. Intellectual pursuits were highly regarded in the family circle. Her uncle Moses Mocatta (1768-1857) was a writer and patron of Jewish scholars, and one of her cousins, Elias Haim Lindo (1783-1865), was a pioneer Anglo-Jewish historian. 
A studious girl, Abigail benefited from her father's keen interest in Jewish education and also from the tuition of her uncle Moses Mocatta. She became thoroughly proficient in Hebrew and unusually well versed in biblical studies, reaching a level sufficient to be respected by the religious head of the Sephardi community from 1828, Rabbi (Dayan) David Meldola (1797-1853). In the course of her studies she compiled a Hebrew and English vocabulary, which also included brief Hebrew and English dialogues, exchanges amusingly reflecting the polite middle-class society in which she lived. The volume was intended for her own use, but, encouraged by friends, she sanctioned its publication (1837). The value of the work was soon recognized, and it was recommended for use in the community's Hebrew schools. A second edition (1842) incorporated a list of Hebrew abbreviations in ordinary use, the fruit of her extensive reading and a valuable study aid of a kind not then readily available. In 1846 came her main work, a Hebrew-English dictionary, which was intended to assist students towards the works of the most eminent Hebrew lexicographers. 
Abigail Lindo was the only woman involved in the early nineteenth-century expansion of biblical philological research and to have publications to her name. She was presumably unacquainted with the cognate languages Aramaic and Arabic, and her work has therefore to be judged by amateur standards. Though overshadowed by subsequent developments in Hebrew philology, her achievement is remarkable for a young English Jewish woman of the time. A later age might well have provided a wider field for her talents. Her writings reveal her as a devout and dutiful daughter, not given to emphasizing her independence; the title-pages of all her works describe her as the third daughter of David Abarbanel Lindo, and his portrait prefaces her dictionary. Valuing what she had achieved by protracted study, she was concerned to inspire others to pursue the same course. 
Abigail Lindo did not enjoy robust health. She died at home on 28 August 1848, aged forty-five, following an attack of phlegmasia dolens -- a condition described as 'white leg' -- which lasted for five weeks; she had suffered from growths in the uterus for fifteen years. She was buried two days later in the Novo (new) cemetery of the Sephardi congregation in Mile End Road, Stepney, in the first of the three graves her father had reserved in 1844 for his unmarried daughters then aged over thirty-five, next to the two he reserved for himself and his wife. He presented $50 in stock (consols) to the congregation in remembrance of her. Her epitaph, in Hebrew, with a poem in Hebrew and English praising her character and achievements, was compiled by Dayan Meldola and printed and circulated to her relatives and friends.

English, Sir David (1930-1998), journalist, was born on 26 May 1930 in Combe, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, the only child of Alfred Joseph English (1901-1930), a bank clerk and innkeeper, and his wife, Kathleen Victoria (Kitty) Brazenor (1899-1964). Alfred English died when his son was less than three months old. English's mother earned a living working as a secretary for the Post Office, then running a boarding-house in Broadstairs, and her parents helped bring up the small boy. The influence of English's grandfather upon him seems to have been profound. A devout Methodist, by his beliefs and actions he instilled in his grandson a regard for the values of family life. He had been a district manager of the Transport and General Workers' Union, and read three newspapers a day. His grandson therefore grew up in a household of acute political awareness, where the press was keenly read and discussed. While English was still a child his mother and her parents bought a hotel in Bournemouth, and this was where he spent his formative years, being educated at Bournemouth grammar school. 
As soon as English left school in 1946 he became a cub reporter on a local paper, the 'Christchurch Times'. Fiercely ambitious, he was also thrilled by the romance of newspapers, and his own life story -- moving from the bottom rung of the trade to being a multi-millionaire newspaper executive on the back of success he had largely created for himself -- was the stuff of that romance. Although remarkably healthy throughout his life he managed to fail the medical for national service, so his career continued uninterrupted. In 1949 he moved to the 'Portsmouth Evening News' and in 1951, aged still only twenty-one, he made it to Fleet Street as a reporter on the 'Daily Mirror'. Once established in the national press he was determined not to allow the grass to grow under him. On 30 August 1952 he married Irene ('b'. 1931), an actress and dancer, and daughter of William Mainwood, a licensed victualler. They had a son and two daughters. In 1953 English left the 'Mirror' for a stint on 'Reynolds' News', a Sunday newspaper. Then in 1956 he changed tack to become features editor of the 'Daily Sketch', and learned something of the trade of the newspaper executive. 
English did not enjoy being tied to a desk. He had an unfulfilled ambition to travel, and was able to satisfy it in 1959 when he joined the 'Sunday Dispatch', then near the end of its life, as New York correspondent. It was with this widening of his experience that the English legend really began to take shape. It was a legend he played an assiduous part in creating. In New York he boasted that he was the youngest foreign correspondent in the city, though he was silenced on discovering that the 'Daily Telegraph''s man was five years younger. When he qualified for a 'Who's Who' entry he altered the date of his birth from 1930 to 1931, and that of his marriage from 1952 to 1954, for reasons that were never entirely clear but which were dismissed by colleagues as vanity. He sent a stream of front-page exclusives back to London, not suffering from the fact that when other journalists tried to follow many of them up for Monday's daily papers the basis on which they had been written was found to have been flimsy. One colleague, Alan Watkins, arriving to take up a post in New York, was warned from all sides that English was 'a sharp fellow, very sharp. He would readily pull a fast one and might even, if he thought it necessary, practise deception' ('Daily Telegraph', 12 June 1998). As far as Watkins was concerned the warning turned out to be unfounded, but English never quite threw off a reputation for sharpness, and indeed later seemed to revel in it. He was always ruthless, and saw no reason to be ashamed of that trait. Watkins wrote of the young English that he 'looked a decade younger than his 29 years and had about him something of the Artful Dodger. He fizzed' (ibid.). 
There was no faulting English's competence or professionalism, and when the 'Dispatch' closed in 1960 he fell on his feet. He was hired by Lord Beaverbrook -- who had been warned that English sometimes 'chanced his arm' ('The Independent', 12 June 1998) -- to be the 'Daily Express''s Washington correspondent. In 1963, after two successful years in Washington, he was promoted to the post of the 'Express''s chief American correspondent, retaining his base in the capital. He was not with the press party that accompanied John F. Kennedy to Dallas in November 1963, though he made his way there swiftly from New York once he heard the news of the president's death. This did not prevent him, as part of his later reminiscences about the event, from gilding the personal legend by implying that he had been present at the assassination. 
In 1965 English returned to England to serve as foreign editor of the 'Express'. After two years in the post he became an associate editor of the paper, and harboured legitimate expectations of succeeding as editor. He asked Max Aitken, who had succeeded his father Lord Beaverbrook as proprietor, to make him editor, only to be told that the 'Express' already had one. He disregarded hints from Aitken that he was the heir apparent and accepted, in 1969, the editorship of the 'Daily Sketch'. He was still only thirty-nine. 
The 'Sketch' was not in the best of health, with a declining readership and set in a contracting market. There was nothing that even someone of English's talent could do to save it by conventional journalistic means. However -- and this was typical of the shrewd operator he was -- he sought to devise a means that would benefit the paper's owners, Associated Newspapers, and, naturally enough, himself. Early in 1971 secret talks began with Vere Harmsworth (later Lord Rothermere), the deputy chairman of Associated, to merge the paper into a new-style 'Daily Mail', the flagship of the Harmsworth empire. English would edit the new 'Mail' and it would give the 'Express' -- then selling 3.5 million copies a day, twice the 'Mail''s circulation -- a run for its money. Harmsworth agreed, even though the plan involved the radical step of changing the 'Mail' from a broadsheet to a tabloid -- or compact paper, as it was then called -- as well as closing the 'Sketch'. Harmsworth's condition was that the new paper should look like the London 'Evening Standard' (which he later came to own), then a successful and popular tabloid. English had been thinking along the same lines, and the deal was done. Harmsworth, though, deserved credit for being astute enough to realize that English's entrepreneurial skills could be put to good use in the necessary modernization of his own newspapers. He also had a vision, which English grasped, of a paper aimed at modern women. 
The operation, in May 1971, involved substantial casualties. The combined editorial staffs of the 'Sketch' and the 'Mail' were cut from 830 to just 320 on the new 'Mail'. English did the sacking on what became known as 'the night of the long envelopes'. He thrived on the challenge, but the struggle to establish the new-style paper was hard. 'It seems like only yesterday we were all working 19 hours a day trying to give birth to a new 'Daily Mail'', English wrote to his news editor two months after the change. 'Now we're working only 14 hours a day. I told you it would get better' ('Daily Telegraph', 12 June 1998). He believed that 'in a competitive world working in a winning environment makes people happy' ('The Independent', 12 June 1998). He would win in the end, but happiness was not always inevitable. He would not hesitate to humiliate those who did not reach his own high standards. Loyal to those who served him well, he could bear deep grudges against those who did not. 
Despite all English's efforts, however, the circulation of the 'Mail' fell from 1.814 million to 1.754 million immediately after the change. In fact, things were worse than that. The 764,000 buyers of the 'Sketch', who were supposed to move over to the 'Mail', had vanished from Associated Newspapers and been picked up by the 'Sun'. By August 1971 matters had become so bad that the paper was down to just twenty-four pages, but English refused to be cowed. To reverse this trend he embarked on more, and further-reaching, changes to the nature of his product. Most of his ideas proved highly successful in maintaining and then increasing his readership. He and Harmsworth were, however, helped by the entry of the 'Express' into a long period of steep decline, and by that title's failure to modernize in response to what its main competitor had done. By the time of his retirement from the editorship in 1992 English had taken the 'Mail', from being so far behind the 'Express', to overhauling that paper's circulation -- though the 'Mail''s had, at 1.69 million, remained fairly static, while the 'Express''s had collapsed to 1.54 million. 
Whereas Harmsworth's and English's idea had been to boost the 'Mail''s circulation significantly by making it far more attractive to women, what they in fact did was prevent sales being eroded at a time when the middle market in newspapers was rapidly contracting. English also had the great journalistic talent of sheer opportunism -- spotting at long range either a promotional opportunity or a story (or best of all a combination of the two) that would pull in more readers. He introduced the 'Mail''s Femail section not just as a magnet for the largely untapped market of women readers, but ensured it had a modern edge that was a far cry from the knitting patterns and recipes of most other Fleet Street women's pages. In the paper's news and features coverage he highlighted, and campaigned on, stories that reflected the concerns of his middle-class readers -- about family matters, the welfare of their children, the value of their property, and the decline of the country. 
It was in relation to the last point that English threw his paper firmly behind Margaret Thatcher even before she had become leader of the Conservative Party in 1975. It was not just in the election campaign of 1979, but in the years leading up to it, that English acted as one of her cheerleaders and, eventually, confidants. However, in this, as in much of his management of the 'Mail' brand, he learned valuable lessons from the formidable editor of the 'Sun', Albert (Larry) Lamb, who led the way in conviction and flair when it came to editing a tabloid paper. Ironically, given the effect the 'Mail' had on the 'Express', English also applied at his paper lessons of populism and immediacy learned from the 'Express' in happier days. The key to his success was that he identified his market precisely and then ensured that his paper appealed to it. 
Such a brazen approach to news and the selling of newspapers as English had brought with it risks. As Saigon was about to fall in 1975 he had the 'Mail' sponsor an airlift of ninety-nine small children to Britain. It was a fabulous coup, typical both of English's showmanship and of his opportunism. However, it later attracted criticism because while many of the children flourished in their new environment, others did not. The low point of English's career came in 1977. He published in the 'Mail' a letter alleging that Lord Ryder, the chairman of the National Enterprise Board, knew of a slush fund for British Leyland, whose contents were used to pay bribes to secure overseas orders. The letter was a forgery and the fund did not exist. English offered his resignation after 123 MPs called for it, but Harmsworth did not accept it. One Labour MP even called for English to be tried for sedition, claiming the story was a deliberate attempt to bring down the government. Later, the Press Council criticized the 'Mail' for hampering the police investigation into the case of the Yorkshire Ripper, and rebuked English for refusing to attend a hearing on the matter. 
There were, though, conspicuous successes that made English indispensable to his masters. Not only did the 'Mail' attract favourable publicity and more readers by a long-running campaign against the influence of the Moonies, it also won the long libel trial brought against the paper in 1981 by the Unification Church after a story headlined 'The church that breaks up families'. In addition, once Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979, the paper grew in influence, as did its editor. His own conspicuous contribution to the Conservative success was rewarded with a knighthood in 1982. By the late 1980s he had, it appeared, achieved his main ambition: the 'Mail' had overtaken the circulation of the once mighty 'Express'. Soon the 'Mail on Sunday' accomplished a similar feat over the 'Sunday Express'. The part the 'Mail' played in Thatcher's three election victories was significant, English's own version of the Thatcherite vision being broadcast to a growing readership with unerring certainty throughout her eleven years in power. 
English was not only, by this time, a formidable figure in his own newspaper, but an increasingly towering one in the industry. He had more than an element of Machiavelli, and was regarded with ambivalence by many who worked with him. Much of this can be attributed to the envy of less original and less successful men; but English was a willing practitioner of the double standard when it suited him. He terrified some journalists who were of a mind to be terrified by him, but he also at times manipulated them rather than handled them. He was thought to have learned the technique of 'creative tension' while in America. This would involve commissioning two journalists to write the same story, and then publishing the better result. It represented an almost Darwinian approach to man management, for only the fittest survived. He hoped for his own high personal standards to be emulated by his staff, though in this he was somewhat optimistic. He once withdrew a bureau chief from New York when he learned that the man had been conducting an extramarital affair, and later tried to prevent a reporter joining the 'Mail' after it had been reported that he had been caught engaging in indecent acts in a public lavatory. 
English's ruthlessness was masked, most of the time, by a carapace of charm. He had a distinctive high-pitched laugh, a slightly rasping voice, and a talent for bonhomie that grew the longer he spent in company with the rich, powerful, and famous. He was a sophisticated gossip, hugely enjoying any tales about colleagues, which he would wait to retail (with appropriate amplifications) until the moment when the effect would be most devastating. He could switch from charm to ferocity in an instant, and it was by such caprices and unpredictability that he kept all about him wary and on their toes. He was a small figure, always immaculately dressed, who in his later years relished playing the part of a Fleet Street elder statesman, and revelled in the influence he knew he had had on the rest of British journalism. 
For all his occasional faults as a man manager English commanded immense loyalty, not least because under him the 'Mail' became a newspaper that generally paid its staff well, and sacked people only rarely. The key to the respect in which he was held was that everyone who worked for him knew he could do any task he asked of them. Once his trust was won -- and winning it was an exacting process -- it was rarely withdrawn. He had a tremendous talent for turning poorly written raw copy into a compelling news story or feature, and as such he shaped the voice of the 'Daily Mail'. He was also a brilliant talent spotter. As well as bringing on his eventual successor, Paul Dacre, he also filled the 'Mail' with the most popular and authoritative columnists available, such as Nigel Dempster, Ian Wooldridge, and Lynda Lee-Potter. By the early 1990s, shortly before he handed over to Dacre, the 'Mail' had become a byword for the middle market, which it dominated. Other newspapers, and not just in the 'Mail''s own market, strove to imitate wherever possible the style, tone, and approach that English had forged at his paper. Few succeeded in any measure, not least because English had usually cornered the market in the high-calibre journalists needed to maintain such a product. 
Although he himself was not above the occasional lapse in taste, English deplored what he saw as the sleaziness of the 'red top' tabloid newspapers such as the 'Sun', the 'Star', and the 'Mirror'. When he felt he noticed, in the mid-1990s, attempts by those papers to move towards the middle of the market, he thought he deserved some credit for it. Explaining his philosophy, he once said: 'It's simple, and very complex. The core is attention to detail. My view is that no story, no headline, no design, no subbing, nothing, is perfect. It can always be improved. That's what I mean by quality, keeping at it, never giving up. We've never wavered from that. Call it mainstream journalism, call it quality journalism, call it whatever you like. It's what makes the 'Mail' titles special. ('The Guardian', 11 June 1998)' With the growth of his eminence came wider responsibilities. English had helped launch the 'Mail on Sunday' in 1982, and even edited it for a while during early teething troubles. He became vice-chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1986, then joint deputy chairman and editor-in-chief in 1989, and finally chairman in 1992, when he ceased editing the 'Daily Mail' after twenty-one years. He and Rothermere maintained a formidable double act at the helm of the group until their sudden deaths, within months of each other, in 1998. From 1988 English was chairman both of New Era TV and of Burlington Magazines. In 1993 he became chairman of the cable television company Channel One, a rare unsuccessful business venture for him, and in 1997 he became chairman of ITN. He became president of the Commonwealth Press Union in 1994 and was active on the National Council for the Training of Journalists. 
English sat on the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) from 1993, though it was his appointment as chairman of the editors' code committee of the commission that caused controversy over accusations of hypocrisy. The 'Mail' had been accused of various intrusions of privacy, not least concerning Diana, princess of Wales. The chief shareholder of the Telegraph group, Conrad Black, said that in that light putting English in charge of a standards committee was 'like having appointed Al Capone as head of a commission to investigate organised crime in Chicago in the 1920s' ('Daily Telegraph', 12 June 1998). English did, however, preside over a committee that eventually produced a code with greatly strengthened provisions. He was also responsible for appointing Lord Wakeham as head of the PCC, which was regarded as means of toughening up self-regulation -- something English knew would be necessary if a privacy law were to be avoided. 
Towards the end of his life English became deeply disillusioned with the Conservative Party, and wrote in a mischievous diary in the 'Spectator' magazine soon after Tony Blair's rise to the Labour leadership that he could foresee the day when the 'Mail' would back 'new' Labour. Lord Rothermere, as if to emphasize the point, signalled that he would sit on the Labour benches in the House of Lords. Whether English wrote what he did just to make waves or to curry favour is not clear, but it was revealed at the time of his death that he was to have been created a life peer in the 1998 birthday honours list. 
English had a full life outside journalism. He had bought, and successfully ran, a chain of launderettes and a chain of free newspapers. Both ventures gave him the financial independence that allowed him to back his own judgement as a newspaper editor. They also made him, as an entrepreneur, a natural soulmate of Margaret Thatcher. He was devoted to his family, and especially to his wife, who was seriously ill for several years towards the end of his life. He enjoyed skiing and, especially, sailing his 40-foot motor cruiser. 
It was his wide combination of talents that in the end made English the success he was. These included his journalist's nose for a good story, and his carefully honed skill in presenting a story in the most arresting way possible. Crucial to his success were his self-confidence, his determination, his ambition, his political judgement, his entrepreneurialism, and above all his ability to manipulate, exploit, and extract the best from others. His legacy was not just a newspaper that continued to grow mightily after he moved on, but a template for a compact newspaper that was copied and used around the world. 
English suffered a stroke at his home in Westminster on 10 June 1998, and died shortly afterwards at St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth. After a funeral service at St Bride's, Fleet Street, the journalists' church, he was buried on 18 June at Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland, where he and his family had enjoyed many skiing holidays. He was survived by his wife and their three children.

Innes, Ralph Hammond (1913-1998), writer, was born on 15 July 1913 at 68 Clarence Road, Horsham, Sussex, the only child of William Hammond Innes, a bank clerk, and his wife, Dora Beatrice Chisford. Ralph went to Cranbrook School, and by the age of thirteen he knew he wanted to be a writer. 
Innes left Cranbrook at eighteen, and tried a number of jobs in the early 1930s including teaching and publishing before joining the staff of the 'Financial News' in 1934 as a trainee industrial correspondent. He stayed at the paper for the next six years. Wanting to raise some money in order to get married, he sent off a manuscript of a supernatural thriller to an agent ('The Doppelganger', published in 1937), and was soon committed to producing three more thrillers in two years for Herbert Jenkins, with lower than usual advances. He met these arduous terms, though he later disowned these works, describing them as 'ham-fisted'. He did, however, acknowledge that the experience had been valuable: 'writing those four books I more or less taught myself how to do it' ('The Independent'). Innes married the actress, and later author, Dorothy Mary Lang (died 1989) in Jevington, Sussex, on 21 August 1937. 
Once he had worked out this first contract, Innes switched publishers, moving to Collins. He continued to write at a furious pace, and produced three more thrillers in the next two years. The first of these, 'Wreckers must Breathe' (1940) -- a story of U-boats operating out of Cornwall -- met with considerable success. The third book for Collins, 'Attack Alarm' (1941), was written largely during night watches defending an aerodrome during the battle of Britain. The book was serialized in an American newspaper, and has been credited with improving the image of Britain at this delicate stage in the Second World War. 
Innes had volunteered for the Royal Artillery in 1940, served with the Eighth Army in the Middle East and Italy, and then transferred to the British army newspapers. By the end of the war he was editing the Florence edition of the forces' paper, and covering the invasion of southern France. After the war he left journalism to become a full-time writer. From then on he published a novel roughly every two years. 'The Lonely Skier' (1947), a novel inspired by a gruelling skiing course taken just before he left the army, brought him to some prominence, and it was his first to be made into a film: 'Snowbound' (1948). However, it was with 'The 'Mary Deare'' (1956) that Innes secured his long-held status as a best-selling author. A film of the book, starring Gary Cooper, Charlton Heston, and Michael Redgrave, was made in 1959 and was a tremendous success. Several more films of Innes's books followed, including 'Campbell's Kingdom' (1952) starring Dirk Bogarde. In his heyday, in the 1950s and 1960s, Innes was selling more than 2 million copies of each book. 
Innes's books are set in far-flung locations: from the western isles to Antarctica, the Indian Ocean, and the Australian outback. Each book was carefully researched. He never wrote about a place without having been there, and he and Dorothy -- both compulsive travellers, and with no children to tie them down -- spent months sailing around the world on these research trips in their 42 foot yacht the 'Mary Deare'. His books fall into a familiar pattern. They are fast-moving adventure stories -- Innes himself rejected the term 'thriller' -- with a first-person male narrator, and stories of high action, played out against the hostile elements. He saw himself as one of the 'last romantics' in the tradition of Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Rudyard Kipling. He valued the wide expanse of their tales, which countered the provincialism, as he saw it, of England after the war. Critics have often found the novels' characterization wanting, and the dialogue rather flat. Praise for his work tended to be of the faint variety (the common fate of popular literature) -- for his workmanlike and unpretentious style. He did, however, maintain his commercial popularity over the length of his career, and V. S. Pritchett thought his depiction of action in a class of its own. His adventures have been translated into over forty languages. 
Innes once described the theme of his books as being 'man's everlasting struggle against the enormous stature of nature' ('The Guardian'), and this passion evolved into a strong ecological theme in his later works, from 'Black Tide' (1982), about oil spillage, and 'High Stand' (1985), his 'tree' novel. With the profits from his early successes Innes had bought a medieval timbered house: Ayres End, in Kersey, Suffolk, and with it 233 acres of derelict woodland. He restored this, and went on to buy and reforest land in Wales and Australia, planting, at his estimation, about one and a half million trees. 
In addition to his adventure novels, Innes wrote children's books under the pseudonym Ralph Hammond, and a number of non-fiction works, including two books of travels and a history of the conquistadors. He was appointed CBE in 1978, and was a member of the Society of Authors, the Royal Yacht Squadron, and the Timber Growers' Association. He was a dapper man, described by one interviewer in 1996 as a model of old-world courtesy and correctness. Innes died of cancer at Ayres End on 10 June 1998. He had amassed a fortune of nearly $7 million from his books; he left $5.4 million to the Association of Sea Training Organizations.

Smyth, Reginald (1917-1998), cartoonist, was born on 10 July 1917 at 52 Union Road, Throston, Hartlepool, co. Durham, the son of Richard Oliver Smyth (died in or before 1949), shipyard worker, and his wife, Florence (Florrie), 'nee' Pearce. Educated at Galley's Field School, West Hartlepool, he left school at fourteen and worked as a butcher's errand boy. After spending some time in unemployment he joined the Northumberland Fusiliers, with whom he served for ten years and rose to the rank of sergeant. He was a machine-gunner and saw active service in north Africa during the Second World War. There he developed an interest in drawing by designing posters for amateur dramatic productions. 
After leaving the forces Smyth settled in London, working as a clerk with the General Post Office (GPO). On 13 August 1949 he married Vera (1916/17-1997), the daughter of George Toyne, woodworker, and formerly the wife of Herbert Whittaker. There were no children of the marriage. While working for the GPO, Smyth again produced posters for amateur plays, but by the early 1950s he had moved to creating cartoons and began to work through an agent. It was at this time that he took up the pen name Reg Smythe. By 1954 he was working for the 'Daily Mirror', designing cartoons for the 'Laughter at Work' series, under the mentorship of Leslie Harding (Styx). This led to full-time employment at the 'Mirror' and, in 1957, to the birth of his great creation, Andy Capp. 
According to Smyth, Andy Capp was born 'on the A1 road at 60 mph' ('The Independent'). While on a visit to West Hartlepool, Smyth had received a request from the 'Mirror' to create a cartoon to boost northern readership, and Capp was created as he returned southwards to work. The rise to fame of his creation was staggering. First appearing in the 'Mirror''s northern edition in 1957 the cartoon swiftly went national in 1958. In the same year the first Andy Capp compilation was also published. By 1960 an Andy Capp strip cartoon was appearing seven days a week -- six days in the 'Mirror' and one in its sister paper, the 'Sunday Pictorial'. Andy's rise to international fame was even more sensational. He appeared in at least 34 countries and 700 newspapers, with text in 13 or more languages. He was Tuffa Viktor in Sweden, Willi Wakker in Germany, Andre Chapeau in France, and Kasket Karl in Denmark, where small, cigarette-smoking models were snapped up in the early 1960s. Smyth's creation brought him numerous awards, including 'Best British cartoon strip' annually from 1961 to 1965. This honour was awarded by the Cartoonists' Club of Great Britain, of which Smyth was a founding member. He won three major awards in Italy -- in 1969, 1973, and 1978 -- and the prestigious US 'Best strip' cartoon award in 1974. 
Hugh Cudlipp of the 'Mirror', the man who persuaded Smyth to create Andy Capp, described the cartoon character succinctly as 'a work-shy, beer-swilling, rent-dodging, wife-beating, pigeon-fancying, soccer-playing, uncouth cadger, setting an appalling example to the youth of Britain' ('The Guardian'). It is perhaps Capp's very political incorrectness that made him wickedly appealing. Smyth said on more than one occasion that Andy and his equally infamous wife, Flo, were based on his own parents. In his personal love of a pint of beer and a cigarette -- until 1983, when he gave up smoking -- Smyth had something in common with his 'offspring'. Andy Capp's ventures off the printed page proved less successful. There was a West End musical and a television series that commenced in 1988, scripted by Keith Waterhouse, but neither had any lasting effect. Some pundits felt that the opportunity for a successful cartoon television series had been missed. 
Smyth was a very private man. At the height of his success he returned to his native Hartlepool, living and working quietly in a secluded bungalow in the middle of a large estate -- 'reserved to the point of being a recluse' ('The Scotsman'). Following the death of his wife in 1997 he married, on 21 May 1998, a widow, Jean Marie Glynn ('b'. 1928/9), daughter of Thomas Barry, labourer. Smyth died at his home, 96 Caledonian Road, Hartlepool, on 13 June 1998, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife. Typically for a professional described as a 'one off' ('The Scotsman') he left a year's worth of cartoons to his employers.

Wood, Anne (1907-1998), singer and opera administrator, was born on 2 August 1907 at The Grange, Crawley, Sussex, a daughter of Percival Wood, JP for Sussex, and his wife, Eleanor. She was educated at St Mary's School, Calne, and studied singing with Elena Gerhardt, George Parker, and Eve de Reussy before joining the BBC Singers in 1934 at the same time as Peter Pears, who became her lifelong friend. The two lived for a while close to each other in London, and before the war often exchanged experiences and views, while sharing many musical encounters. During the war, as a fluent German speaker, she was employed by the Ministry of Economic Warfare to work on 'black' propaganda. By night she drove an ambulance. She was also employed by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, later ENSA. 
After the war Wood's singing career as a leading mezzo-soprano came to fruition. A resourceful interpreter of modern music, she sang in many premieres, including that of Benjamin Britten's 'Spring Symphony' at Amsterdam in 1950. She was also a noted recitalist and was fluent in the interpretation of oratorio. 
Wood was one of the leading lights in the formation, in 1948, of the English Opera Group, working as an administrator alongside Britten, John Piper, and Eric Crozier, the last-named teaching her the ins and outs of operatic management, which stood her in good stead when she struck out on her own. On the basis of that experience, and to help young singers to tackle new scores, Wood formed the Opera Studio with the well-known soprano Joan Cross. Until then no such school existed in Britain. That was in 1949; by 1952 it had developed into the London Opera School, and in 1959 it became the National School of Opera, which gave stage experience and advice to many young artists, latterly on the stage at Morley College, London. 
When it developed into a larger organization, the London Opera Centre, in 1964, under the aegis of Covent Garden, Wood and Cross, no longer in total control, decided to resign from what had been their own creation. Wood opted to change course and formed Phoenix Opera in 1965. It employed, in its small but productive way, many leading singers, producers, and designers, and -- as a touring group -- gave many deeply satisfying performances, a few of them, under Yehudi Menuhin's aegis, at the Bath Festival. In its ten-year existence it performed twelve operas, always well prepared and sung, in 66 different venues. In 1975 the Arts Council withdrew its grant, ironically just after the company had made a successful tour of Austria and Yugoslavia sponsored by the British Council, and gradually the company had to reduce its activities to vanishing point, much to Wood's chagrin. 
In the 1980s Wood was a moving force in setting up a singing award in memory of Pears, but that enterprise also failed after a few years, because of a lack of funds. She continued, almost to the end of her life, encouraging young singers with her long-standing partner, Johanna Peters (died 2000). Together, out of the limelight, they did a power of good for the development of singing talent. 
Wood was a formidable character, with strong ideas on how opera should be organized and performed. She propounded them fearlessly, often in the teeth of opposition from the opera establishment. That did not endear her to the powers that be, and probably prevented her from achieving the eminence she undoubtedly deserved. She died in the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Westminster, on 12 June 1998.

Shaw, Mabel (1888-1973), missionary and educationist, was born on 3 December 1888 at Prestwood Road, Heath Town, Willenhall, Wolverhampton, the eldest of three boys and two girls of Matthew Shaw, a tea-shop manager, and his wife, Elizabeth Anne, 'nee' Purchase. Between the ages of five and ten she lived with her grandmother in the Berkshire countryside and there, and later at her boarding-school in the Isle of Wight, she became a convinced Christian. On leaving school she went to study for four years in Edinburgh at St Colm's ecumenical Women's Missionary Training College, which had been founded by the remarkable Ann Hunter Small, who had herself been a missionary and educationist in India. At St Colm's, Shaw imbibed an informed respect for non-Christian religious traditions and beliefs, as well as a critical understanding of the 'New Testament'. She was not forced into one religious pattern but was encouraged to find and 'follow her own bent, but without exclusiveness towards other points of view' (Wyon, 72). 
Armed with Miss Small's injunction 'to understand and sympathise with the inner character and thought of the peoples of Asia and Africa' (A. Small, preface to 'Missionary College Hymns', 1914) Mabel Shaw accepted the London Missionary Society's call to go out to central Africa to start the Christian education of girls, and sailed for Cape Town in 1915. After a week's train journey to Broken Hill she was carried by bearers for a month overland -- across plains, forests, and rivers, camping out in the open and learning as much as she could of her porters' language, until she reached Mbereshi in what is now Zambia. She then spent the first year learning to understand and speak Cibemba and acquainting herself with the local African traditions, especially with the traditional upbringing of girls. However initially shocked and alienated she was by some of the tribal customs concerning women, she knew it would be presumptuous to condemn everything out of hand. Instead she decided to build her own school village on traditional African foundations, growing communal crops, learning crafts such as pottery, and respecting the spirituality of the Africans' animist beliefs while having Christ as their chief. 
Over the next twenty-five years Mabel Shaw grew to have immense faith in her girl pupils -- among whom was the future wife of Kenneth Kaunda -- and she described her activities in a number of articles and books in the 1920s and 1930s. These included 'Children of the Chief' (1921), 'Dawn in Africa: Stories of Girl Life' (1927), and also 'God's Candlelights: an Educational Venture in Northern Rhodesia' (1932). What grieved her was the threat of destabilization and degradation resulting from European exploitation of the copperbelt with its shanty towns, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution. She was also appalled by the racist superiority complex of the white colonial settlers. 
After laying the foundations for girls' primary education, teacher training, and nursing, and exercising a permanent influence on government and missionary educational policy in Africa, Mabel Shaw retired to Britain in 1940. However, she continued to publicize the cause of African women's education in Britain. She spoke in churches, schools, and colleges (and also on the BBC) making common cause with the anti-colonialist Dr Norman Leys in passionately opposing the British colonial education policy that restricted, via grossly unequal funding, the African child's educational aspirations to what a white child was expected to know by the age of ten. 
After long years of crippling arthritis Mabel Shaw died on 25 April 1973 in the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey, almost destitute and apparently forgotten. Her great sorrow was that in her last years she had nothing to give those of 'her' African girls who had succeeded in reaching Britain for further education and training. But after she had been cremated her ashes were flown out to Mbereshi where there was a huge memorial service and Mama Shaw could be buried in the chapel grounds of the school she had founded more than half a century before.

Armytage, (Walter) Harry Green (1915-1998), educationist and historian, was born on 22 November 1915 at 179 du Toitspan Road, Kimberley, South Africa, the son of Walter Green Armytage (1880-1934), a railway clerk, and his wife, Harriet Jane May (1894-1964). He was brought up initially in Bloemfontein, South Africa, but in 1924 he moved with his family to England. He attended Basset Road Boys' School in Camborne, and then, from 1927 until 1934, Redruth county grammar school, Cornwall. From 1934 to 1938 he went on to study at Downing College, Cambridge, where he took first-class honours in history and a certificate in education. He embarked on a teaching career as a history master at Dronfield grammar school, Sheffield. After the outbreak of the Second World War he served in the army as a captain in the London Irish Rifles, in north Africa and Italy, and was mentioned in dispatches. 
Following the war Armytage returned to Dronfield, but in 1946 he moved to the University of Sheffield as a lecturer in education. On 25 June 1948 he married (Lucy) Frances Horsfall (1912-1996). Frances, also a historian, had been in the civil service during the war and later became a lecturer in history at the University of Sheffield. They settled in Totley, Sheffield, where they had a son, John, and remained there for the rest of their long marriage. 
Once established at the university, Armytage soon became widely recognized as a formidable scholar. He rose rapidly to become senior lecturer in 1952, and two years later was promoted to professor of education. His published work presented the history of education in England in terms of gradual progress towards a rational, scientific, and civilized society. Much of his early work was biographical in nature, and he completed full-length studies of A. J. Mundella (1951), Thomas Hughes (with E. C. Mack, 1952), and Sir Richard Gregory (1957). He emphasized what he saw as the English liberal tradition of education, 'a tradition of reasonableness, tolerance, compromise and humanity' that also evoked service and industry: 'the service which was perfect freedom, and the industry which was life itself' (W. H. G. Armytage, 'A. J. Mundella', 1951, 13). 
This liberal idealism also informed Armytage's important writings on the English civic universities, which he depicted as 'parceners of a great heritage... centres of creative endeavour in the arts and sciences, repositories of informed knowledge and opinion, powerhouses of ideas, nurseries of new disciplines' (W. H. G. Armytage, 'Civic Universities: Aspects of a British Tradition', 1955, 311). He insisted that the structures developed under the 1870 'Elementary Education Act' were essentially benevolent and progressive in their design. He also cultivated a strongly international dimension in his work, reflected increasingly in his comparative studies, especially in demonstrating the international influences of ideas and movements. 
In the early 1960s Armytage cemented his reputation among educationists and historians alike with four books that were the key defining works of a mature scholar. Each of these traced the origins of major educational and social movements over many centuries. The first was 'A Social History of Engineering' (1961), which went into several editions. This was followed by 'Heavens below' (1961), a study of utopian experiments in England from 1560 to 1960, commissioned as one of a series of studies in social history. The third was 'Four Hundred Years of English Education' (1964), an overview of educational developments since the Elizabethan era. Lastly, 'The Rise of the Technocrats' (1965) examined the international influence of scientific expertise from the seventeenth century onwards. In the later 1960s he also contributed a series of short works to the 'Students Library of Education' series on different national influences on English education: the American (1967), the French (1968), the German (1969), and the Russian (1969). At the same time he developed the millenarian aspect of his historical work through a further book entitled 'Yesterday's Tomorrows' (1968). 
Armytage's position as the leading historian of education in England was somewhat undermined after this time, as the field turned towards more critical, less sympathetic accounts, and as he became increasingly involved in university administration. He served as pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Sheffield from 1964 until 1968, and became the first dean of the faculty of educational studies in 1970. He was also involved in many committees, as well as in societies in which he took a personal interest, such as the Eugenics Society (later the Galton Institute), and was an avid follower in his spare time of Sheffield United Football Club. 
Throughout, Armytage was a lively and inspiring teacher, as well as an engaging, gregarious colleague. He was a champion of the teaching profession and of the aspirations of individual teachers for continued professional development, and often gave talks to professional associations and at school prize-givings. He also strongly supported the History of Education Society (founded in 1967), served on its executive committee, and played a leading part in its conferences, with regular lectures and after-dinner speeches. He helped to establish a successful exchange scheme with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and spent two years after his retirement in 1981 as the Gerald Read professor of education at Kent State University in Ohio. His contributions were recognized with the award of honorary degrees at the University of Ulster (1977), the University of Hull (DLitt, 1980), and the University of Sheffield (DLitt, 1991). 
In his last years Armytage fell victim to Alzheimer's disease. He died at his home, 3 The Green, Totley, following a cardiac arrest on 13 June 1998, and was cremated on 19 June. Harry Armytage's contribution to his field of study continued to be admired as outstanding, and indeed he may well be regarded as one of the finest of all English historians of education. The Harry Armytage memorial awards are offered by the University of Sheffield to support research into the history of education and comparative education.

Cookson, Dame Catherine Ann (1906-1998), writer, was born on 20 June 1906 at 5 Leam Lane, South Shields, co. Durham, the illegitimate daughter of a domestic servant, Catherine Fawcett (1883-1956), known as Kate. Catherine was brought up by her grandmother and stepgrandfather (Rose Fawcett, 'nee' McConnell, and John McMullen), in a strong Irish Catholic family, and believed for the first eight years of her life that the McMullens were her parents and that Kate was her sister. She learned the truth from children in the street. Her childhood was marred by alcoholism, unemployment, and poverty: she made regular trips to the pawnshop for her mother and scavenged for wood and coal on the banks of the Tyne. The story she later told in 'Our Kate' and earlier unpublished manuscripts portrays a family in which physical and sexual abuse were common: Catherine's mother admitted to Catherine before she died that she had been abused by both her stepfather and her half-brother. Catherine, in turn, claimed to have been sexually assaulted by a lodger and to have been emotionally and physically abused by her mother when under the influence of alcohol. At times she hated Kate so much that she fantasized about killing her. In unpublished autobiographical manuscripts Catherine writes of 'tragic secrets' and 'things so terrible' that they can never be told. 
Always known at this stage as Kitty or Katie McMullen, Catherine did not discover until she was given a copy of her birth certificate in her late twenties that her real name was Catherine Ann Davies and her official date of birth 27 June 1906. Kate had registered her daughter's birth later than the legal time allowed, and falsified her date of birth to avoid the penalty. She also claimed to be married to Catherine's father, named on the certificate as Alexander Davies, commission agent, in a vain attempt to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy. He is believed to have been Alexander Davies Pate (1879-1948), a handsome labourer of Scots-Irish descent with a passion for gambling, who already had a wife in Newcastle and later bigamously married another. Catherine clung to the fantasy that her father had been a 'gentleman' and rarely admitted that she knew his true identity. She inherited her father's good looks and red gold hair as well as his charismatic personality and ability to tell stories. Less welcome was the rare blood disorder she also inherited from him -- hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasis -- from which he eventually died and whose symptoms blighted Catherine's life. 
Educated at St Peter and St Paul's Roman Catholic School at Tyne Dock, Jarrow, Catherine left school because of ill health before she was thirteen and followed her mother into domestic service. She was already writing stories and trying to get them published but, realizing that her lack of education was a restriction, she began to educate herself by a programme of reading and night classes. At various times she also took lessons in bookkeeping, elocution, fabric painting, juggling, French, and music in an effort to better herself and was eventually rewarded by the offer of a job in the workhouse laundry at Harton in South Shields. More senior posts followed at Tendring in Essex and at Hastings in Sussex, where Catherine finally settled. There she bought her first house, run initially as a lodging-house with help from her mother and a friend, Nan Smyth 
(Annie Smyth; 1895-1969)
, with whom Catherine had an intense and ambiguous relationship. Although they were together for nine years, 'We lived together; we slept together', Catherine always denied that it was anything other than a close female friendship. Nan kept letters which she later used to try to disrupt Catherine's marriage to Thomas Henry Cookson (1912-1998), an Oxford mathematics graduate teaching at Hastings grammar school who came initially as a lodger to the house Catherine and Nan were sharing. Tom was a protestant and Catherine had to face considerable opposition from the priests, her mother, and Nan Smyth before they were able to marry on 1 June 1940 at St Mary's Star of the Sea Catholic Church in Hastings. Catherine claimed that Nan had threatened to shoot her on the morning of the wedding if she allowed it to take place. 
During the war Catherine Cookson accompanied her husband on his postings around the country as an RAF instructor. She earned a living as a skilled illustrator for J. Arthur Dixon and continued a programme of self-education, helped by Tom who drew up a reading list and taught her English grammar. Religious doubts and a series of stillbirths and miscarriages affected Cookson's mental health, which was already shaky following the breakup of her friendship with Nan Smyth. She became ill with severe depression and was admitted to St Mary's Hospital in Herefordshire, where she had several sessions of electroconvulsive therapy. She was never able to have a child and allowed her Catholic faith to lapse. 
After the war the Cooksons returned to Hastings and Catherine Cookson joined the Hastings writers' circle and began to try to get her work published. Her first, autobiographical, novel, 'Kate Hannigan', was taken up by agent John Smith at Christy and Moore and published by Macmillan in 1950. Though she was devastated when her second was rejected, she quickly began the series of Jarrow novels that made her famous as a novelist of the social history of the north-east of England. The 'Cookson novel' became a genre in its own right. Fame was slow to come, however, until 'The Round Tower' won the Winifred Holtby award in 1969. 
Cookson also wrote many nineteenth-century historical novels, such as 'The Glass Virgin' and 'The Black Velvet Gown', children's books, and humorous novels such as the Mary Ann series based on her own childhood. The story of her own and her mother's life, 'Our Kate', which was published in 1969, is a much edited version of the memoir she had begun in 1956 after the death of her mother, with whom she had had a difficult and often turbulent relationship. It was a very powerful story, portraying an illegitimate girl growing up in one of the poorest communities in the Western world, struggling with family problems such as poverty, illiteracy, abuse, and alcoholism, to become one of the best-selling novelists of all time. 
With the sale of 'Katie Mulholland' to America and publication of the Mallen trilogy in 1973, Cookson's books began to dominate the best-seller lists. Characteristically, she gave much of her wealth to charity. She returned to live in the north-east, first at Corbridge in Northumberland, then in the village of Langley, and finally at 23 Glastonbury Grove in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. She continued to struggle with ill health, both mental and physical. In particular haemorrhagic telangiectasis caused spontaneous bleeding from nose, mouth, and stomach and necessitated frequent trips to hospital and frequent blood transfusions. Catherine gave many hundreds of thousands of pounds to fund genetic research into the condition. She was cared for by her devoted husband Tom who, she admitted, had 'given up his life' so that she could write. Although now a multi-millionaire (she once described herself as 'the best paid bastard in the business!'), Cookson was still haunted by religious doubts and the shame of her illegitimate birth. She remained loyal to her roots, insisting that she had always been 'a child of the Tyne', her novels recording the rise and decline of the industries on its banks across a period of nearly 200 years. 
Catherine Cookson herself soon became one of the region's most profitable industries as interest in her novels attracted tourists into the area. South Shields declared itself 'Catherine Cookson country', and a replica of her old home (demolished under a slum clearance programme) was re-erected in the town museum. During the 1980s and 1990s her books were made into films for television and reached an even wider audience, being translated into sixty-eight languages. She wrote a total of 103 books -- 89 novels, 10 children's books, and 4 autobiographical works -- continuing to dictate fiction until her ninetieth year. 
Cookson was given an honorary MA by the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1982 and an honorary doctorate by the University of Sunderland in 1990. St Hilda's College, Oxford, made her an honorary fellow in 1997. In 1985 she was appointed OBE, and in 1993 she was made a dame of the British empire. 
Cookson was reconciled to the Roman Catholic church in the last year of her life and died at her home in Jesmond on 11 June 1998, from heart failure. She was cremated later in June at the West Road crematorium, Newcastle. Her husband died just seventeen days later, and the bulk of their joint estate was left to a charitable trust. 
Several of her novels were published posthumously, including 'A House Divided', 'Rosie of the River', 'The Silent Lady', 'The Blind Years', 'Riley', 'The Thursday Friend', and her rejected second novel, 'Kate Hannigan's Girl'. Catherine Cookson's will failed to appoint a literary executor. This resulted in some confusion over manuscripts still unpublished and in major disagreements between her agents Anthony Sheil (who represented Cookson for almost thirty years) and Sonia Land of Sheil Land Associates Ltd, which were resolved when Anthony Sheil left the agency. Sheil Land Associates Ltd continued to represent the Cookson estate after her death.

Mac an Bhaird family (per. c.1400-c.1695), Gaelic poets, was an Irish family (clann an Bhaird, 'the children of the bard') famous for poetry and learning. The name suggests an early link with learning, through descent from a bard, the earliest kind of poet attested among the Celtic peoples, who was in medieval Ireland regarded as inferior to the learned 'file'. The surname is first attested in the annals in 1173, when Mael Isu Macc in Baird died bishop of Clonfert, a see in co. Galway. 
What has been regarded as the senior learned line, and possibly the kin of Mael Isu of 1173, first appears in the annals in 1408 with the death of Mac an Bhaird of Cul an Urtainn, 'ollamh' of Ui Mhaine in co. Galway, of which the family of O Ceallaigh (O Kelly) were the leaders. The term 'ollamh' is usually translated as 'chief poet', but he also had enormous power as the chief's political counsellor. The first name of this 'ollamh' is not known, and none of his work, nor that of any of the co. Galway family, is known to have survived. Families of Mac an Bhaird (in various Anglicizations, including Ward) are still on record in the O Ceallaigh country in the seventeenth century, but by then the learned tradition of the family had moved on. Possibly members of this same branch of the poetic family did continue to produce verse (of some kind) for several centuries, while leaving no written evidence of it; they might conceivably include a group of 'McEwards', 'rymers' in Ballymote, co. Sligo, who were 'pardoned' by Queen Elizabeth in 1603. 
A second branch of the family was clearly in evidence by 1488, when the annals record the death of 'Mac an Bhaird Oirghiall', the head of the branch belonging to Oirghialla (Oriel), an Ulster territory approximating to co. Monaghan; he was Nuadha, son of Sean Cam, and his grandfather Cu Uladh probably lived about 1400. This is usually taken to be an offshoot of the Mac an Bhaird family of Ui Mhaine, but there is a hint in Roderic O'Flaherty's 'Ogygia' (1685) that in fact the Mac an Bhaird family of Oriel was just as ancient as that of Ui Mhaine. None of the Oriel family, however, is identified as a poet before the mid-sixteenth century. After that there are several extant poems composed by a poet (or poets) called Aodh mac Diarmada (Mhic an Bhaird) to patrons in that area, notably O Raghallaigh leaders in co. Cavan in 1596-8, and a Maguire (Fermanagh) aristocrat in 1566. 
The third branch of the family, the most important and (as far as is known) the most productive, was based in Tir Conaill (co. Donegal), and it is usually assumed to have derived from one of the two branches already mentioned. This may be correct, but the beginnings of the Donegal family have been placed about the year 1400, very much the same time that the other two families are first heard of. In 1510 the annals record the death of Eoghan Ruadh Mac an Bhaird, 'ollamh' to O Domhnaill (O Donnell) of Tir Conaill, and it is as poets to the O Donnell family that Clann an Bhaird are best known thereafter. This Eoghan Ruadh may have been the son of Gofraidh mac Eoghain, who died in 1478 and is the first Mac an Bhaird Tire Conaill (head of the Donegal family) on record; the earliest surviving Mac an Bhaird poem is one composed on the death of an O Donnell chief in 1420 by

Abell, Adam (1475x80?-1537?), Franciscan friar and chronicler, was born in Salt Preston, Haddingtonshire, but the names and occupations of his parents are not recorded and details of his early life are scant. What little is known is derived largely from his chronicle, 'The Roit or Quheill of Tyme', which records that he spent his childhood in the Augustinian abbey of Holyrood beside Edinburgh, where a kinsman, Robert Bellentyne, was abbot. It was at Holyrood that he probably received most of his education, either in the abbey itself or possibly at the grammar school in the Canongate which was under the abbey's control. There is no concrete evidence that he studied at a university, though his knowledge of canon law does suggest some higher education. 
In 1495 Abell was professed as an Augustinian canon regular at Inchaffray Abbey in Perthshire. He subsequently became dissatisfied with the state of religious discipline there and, perhaps inspired by the example of Bellentyne, who resigned the abbacy of Holyrood and retired to the stricter Carthusian house in Perth, applied to transfer to another religious house. A Vatican penitentiary act of 16 June 1508 preserves his request to transfer either to another Augustinian establishment or to an Observant Franciscan house. However, Abell was still at Inchaffray two years later, when he signed a petition, dated 20 June 1510, from the convent to Lord Oliphant concerning the annual rents of Pitcairns. Although the precise date is unknown Abell did, however, eventually leave Inchaffray for the Observant Franciscan friary of Jedburgh, traditionally believed to have been founded in 1513 but recorded in the Scottish treasurer's accounts in 1505. 
Abell's only surviving work is 'The Roit or Quheill of Tyme', a chronicle in Scots composed after his transfer to the Franciscans of Jedburgh, and preserved in a unique manuscript in the National Library of Scotland (MS 1746). In the introduction to the chronicle Abell refers to an earlier Latin version of the work which is now lost. The precise dates of composition are unknown, but the chronicle may be dated on internal evidence to the late 1520s and 1530s; the colophon to the main part of the text and the short preamble to its continuation indicate that the body of the chronicle was complete by 1533, and the continuation added when the translation was made shortly thereafter. The continuation ends abruptly in 1537, as though interrupted. 
The 'Roit' belongs to the genre of universal chronicle, a form characteristic of medieval historical writing. It opens with a brief account of creation and carries on through biblical, classical, medieval European, papal, and Scottish history, both real and legendary, and thus reflects the medieval vision of history as the progressive unfolding of the divine plan for the world and its creatures. For his material Abell relied heavily on such works as Eusebius's 'Chronicon', Peter Comestor's 'Historia scholastica', Walter Bower's 'Scotichronicon', and Hector Boece's 'Scotorum historiae', but he did not follow any author slavishly and frequently discarded his sources' opinions in favour of his own interpretation. 
Abell's chronicle is historically significant for a variety of reasons. As one of a very limited number of chronicles of known Franciscan authorship anywhere in Europe it is an international rarity. Within a Scottish context it is unique. Aside from its distinction as the last surviving chronicle from pre-Reformation Scotland, it addresses material which other Scottish historical writings of the time do not. For example, neither Boece nor his contemporary translators deal with the reigns of James II, III, IV, or V, choosing to end, as Bower did, with the assassination of James I in 1437. Abell, however, continues his chronicle up to 1537, providing an eyewitness perspective on the reigns of James III, IV, and V, and provides the only chronicle accounts of those reigns to be written before the Reformation. Equally interesting are his views on contemporary ecclesiastical issues, including the 'commendam' system and plurality of benefice, both of which he attacks with vigour. He is particularly critical of seekers of church offices, noting that unworthy candidates are led 'nocht to the cheptur but to the king's chalmer' (NL Scot., MS 1746, fol. 85'v'; Thorson, 171). His grievance against them was not caused by material damage arising from greed or financial mismanagement, but rather by the spiritual harm caused by the poor moral example given by absentee curates and lay abbots; in this his assessment is supported by Mark Dilworth's findings that Scottish monasteries were not hurt by greedy commendators as contemporary monasteries in France were. 
The date and place of Abell's death are not recorded in surviving sources. There are two indications that he did not live to finish his work and probably died in 1537, the date of the latest material in the chronicle. One is the abrupt end of the continuation of the 'Roit', which cuts off in the middle of a sentence, with some events still unresolved; and the other is the phrasing of the short introduction to the continuation, which reads in part: 'heir he begynnis quhair he lewit in pe 3ere of God 1534 3eris and sa procedand for his schort tyme' (NL Scot., MS 1746, fol. 119'v'; Thorson, 241). The place of Abell's burial is also unrecorded, but the excavation of the Jedburgh friary conducted between 1983 and 1985 revealed several graves in the church and cloister, and it is likely that he was buried there.

Aird, William (d. 1606/7), Church of Scotland minister, worked as a mason until twenty years old. His wife, whose name is not known, taught him to read, and he later acquired Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He studied theology for several years, probably at Edinburgh, and may have attended the university there during the first year after its opening in 1583, as he was called to the ministry in 1584. Shortly afterwards he fled to England with other ministers who opposed the passing by parliament in May of the 'Black Acts', which asserted the king's supremacy over the kirk. He remained in Berwick upon Tweed in the company of James Melville, but had returned to Edinburgh by October 1585, when the town council requested the return of John Cairns, reader, to St Giles, whom failing, either Michael Cranston, minister of Selkirk, or William Aird. The latter was eventually admitted minister of the collegiate charge of St Cuthbert's, Edinburgh, on 13 September 1586, as colleague of Robert Pont. 
Aird remained close to the ministers opposed to the ecclesiastical policy of the crown and was in no way as cautious as Pont. In December 1592 he was one of the Edinburgh ministers vehemently opposed to Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell, and it was he who pronounced Bothwell's excommunication in February 1595. At the beginning of 1598 Robert Bruce, minister of Edinburgh and a prominent opponent of James VI, attempted to have Aird as one of his colleagues. This did not happen. At that year's general assembly Aird, along with Bruce, James Melville, and others, opposed the king's wishes in maintaining that ministers ought not to have the right to vote in parliament. There is no record of Aird's having been involved in the proceedings of any other general assembly and his name is listed only among the commissioners of the assembly of 1602. James VI is said to have sent him a purse of gold, probably during this assembly, but although Aird was impoverished he refused to accept it, considering it to be a bribe. However, an unknown hand left some sacks of meal the following day at his manse. 
Exactly when Aird died is not known. He was present at a kirk session meeting at St Cuthbert's on 19 July 1606, but was dead by 20 September 1607, when his successor, William Arthur, was called. Aird's son John assisted his father after graduating MA at the University of Edinburgh in 1604, and was minister of Newton in 1614 before becoming minister of Newbattle the following year. He had the same attitude towards royal authority as his father, signing the protestation for the liberties of the kirk in 1617.

Black, David (c.1546-1603), Church of Scotland minister, was probably born in Perth, the son of Henry Black (died before 1594), a burgess of the city. He matriculated as a student in St Salvator's College at the University of St Andrews in 1561, when he is likely to have been aged about fifteen. Although there is no record of his graduation as MA, he must have completed the full arts course over four years, as he was always given the title Mr. On completing his studies he followed the career of a schoolmaster in England, where he lived for about seventeen years, and where he was given rights of citizenship. In the early 1580s he was living with his wife, Katherine Prattie, in the parsonage of Kilkhampton in Cornwall, as the guest of the incumbent Eusebius Paget. The patronage of the parish was in the hands of Sir Richard Grenville, who was apparently briefly converted to puritanism by Paget and Black but who later turned against them. Paget, an eloquent preacher and writer, had before his presentation to Kilkhampton in 1580 been on one occasion deprived for nonconformity. In Black he found a kindred spirit. 
On 9 November 1584 Black appeared before Bishop Woolton of Exeter, who was acting on behalf of the high commission witnesses. The bishop gave evidence that Black had, privately in Grenville's house and publicly in the church of Kilkhampton at the time of service, expounded the scriptures without ecclesiastical authority, conducted other religious services, and made accusations against the practices of the Church of England. Black was ordered to appear before the high commission in London on 26 November 1584. From the articles then put forward against him it appears that he had criticized the 'Book of Common Prayer', claimed that there ought not to be bishops in the Church of England, did not pray for the queen, and did not acknowledge her as the supreme head of the church. He was said to be 'a common inveygher against the state ecclesiasticall of this realme and the members therof' (Ritchie, 522). In 1583 Archbishop John Whitgift had launched a campaign against puritan clergy, requiring subscription to three articles, of which the second declared 'That the 'Book of Common Prayer' and of ordering bishops, priests and deacons containeth nothing in it contrary to the word of God' (Collinson, 245). It was therefore unsurprising that Black should now consider returning to Scotland. 
At this time a number of ministers also arrived in London who had fled from Scotland, following attempts by the government there to restore episcopacy and assert royal supremacy over the church. Among them was Black's contemporary at St Andrews University, Andrew Melville, who had recently been called before the privy council for alleged treasonable statements made in sermons and had been sentenced to imprisonment for declining the council's jurisdiction in the matter. It is reasonable to assume that Black met with Melville in London, and that together they discussed the possibility of Black's returning to Scotland. It is not known how Black was treated by the high commission, but on 13 May 1587 he signed a declaration undertaking to conform to the Church of England during his residence in England, and apologized for remarks he had made about the archbishop of Canterbury. 
In 1590 Black, 'be the cairfull procurement' of Andrew Melville at the general assembly, was appointed minister of St Andrews ('Autobiography and Diary of... Melvill', 293). On 11 November of that year he was unanimously chosen by the St Andrews kirk session as their pastor and minister. His settlement in St Andrews did not run smoothly. He found at the end of his first year that the work was too demanding for one minister and he withdrew from his charge. In April 1593 the general assembly required that he return and nominated Robert Wallace as his colleague. By 19 September 1593 Black and Wallace had accepted this decision and required that pastoral responsibilities be divided equally between them. Black gave early indication of his rigorous plans for the exercise of ecclesiastical discipline by requiring in this matter from the outset the full support of the magistrates. Emphasis was placed on eradicating fornication, on enforcing strict sabbath observance, and on providing adequately for the poor. As a member of presbytery Black exhibited a similar diligence in calling upon his non-resident ministerial brethren to return to their charges and to fulfil their responsibilities. His 'singular fidelitie and diligence in the ministrie' won for him the unstinted praise of like-minded colleagues ('Autobiography and Diary of... Melvill', 293). 
Not unexpectedly Black's emphasis on discipline made him enemies. He had a hard struggle with both the kirk session and the town council in the early years of his ministry to gain acceptance for his programme of moral reform, and in addition he incurred the ill will of individual citizens. One of those was William Balfour, who feared eviction from a house in the abbey grounds, which had been designated as a manse for Black. According to James Melvill, Balfour was one of a group of malcontents who reported to James VI 'calumnious informationes' against Black ('Autobiography and Diary of... Melvill', 323), who was consequently summoned before the king for alleged defamatory remarks made from the pulpit against earlier monarchs. Black declined the king's jurisdiction in the matter, and maintained that he ought to answer for what he said from the pulpit in an ecclesiastical court. After a somewhat heated discussion and a private explanation by Black to James of what he had said about the latter's mother, the matter was resolved. Subsequently Black and Balfour were reconciled. 
This incident in no way restricted Black's moral reforming activities, nor did it end the monitoring of his pulpit pronouncements. His reputation in England as an outspoken critic of the establishment there had apparently followed him to Scotland and his pulpit pronouncements were reported to English agents. At the end of October 1596, for instance, Black was reported to have declared that the queen of England was an atheist and that the religion professed in England was but a show. By 12 November James had taken action against Black, who was summoned to appear before the king and his council. A council of ministers objected to the king's action, but James was determined that Black should answer the charges against him, which included derogatory statements made against King James, his queen, and kings in general. At a time when relations between king and church were frequently strained, James was anxious to hold ministers responsible for the political content of their sermons, to reassure Queen Elizabeth of the strength and stability of his rule, and to restrict ministers' attempts to reserve matters that were in the first instance ecclesiastical for the jurisdiction of the church's courts. This last point was set out by Black and other ministers in a written declinature submitted before he appeared in front of king and council. In the presence of the council he again declined its authority, maintaining that he was answerable to a church court for what he said in the pulpit. In taking this position he was confident of the support of the commissioners of the general assembly. King James, however, regarded Black's stance as a flagrant challenge to his right to rule. He was determined to act quickly and decisively, well aware that his action against Black was being reported to Burghley. 
Black was publicly summoned to appear again before the council. Most of those who had submitted written evidence described him 'as an unquiet and restless spirited man, a sower of sedition and discord... though one added that by some of the town he was reputed good, quiet and honest' ('CSP Scot.', 1595-7, 382). But although Black had obtained favourable testimonials from the provost and bailies of St Andrews, from the kirk session, and from the university, the king and council declared themselves competent judges, as the accusations were treasonable and seditious, and on 9 December he was convicted and ordered to go into ward, 'in a part by north the North Water' (the area of Kincardine across the North Esk) at his own expense until the king had decided what to do with him ('Reg. PCS', 1592-9, 340). Queen Elizabeth, who had been kept fully informed, wrote to James expressing her gratitude and her confidence in leaving to him the punishment of Black, whose name she disdained to mention. 
Early in the new year there were repeated appeals to the king to allow Black to return to his charge, as he had complied with the king's wishes, but to no avail. In July 1597 he was debarred by the king from returning to St Andrews, but permitted to settle in a rural parish. That year he was translated and admitted to the parish of Arbirlot in Forfarshire, left vacant by the translation of George Gladstanes to St Andrews. On 15 May 1598 Black was presented to the vicarage by the crown. He died, according to Calderwood, on 12 January 1603 in Dundee; his friend John Johnston, writing from St Andrews to Caspar Waser in Zurich on 29 January 1603, gave 5 January as the date of his death. He was survived by his wife and their daughter. 
Such colleagues as Andrew Melville, James Melvill, and John Johnston, who held Black in high esteem, wrote laudatory Latin verses in his memory. They were followed in their appreciation by presbyterian historians from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. But other writers have stressed that what was central to this controversy was not so much the question of the truth of the accusations brought against David Black, as of the right of the king and council to be his judges, and the judges of what ministers expounded in their pulpits.

Brand, John (d. 1600), Church of Scotland minister, was a canon of the Augustinian abbey of Holyrood, Edinburgh, when he made his first recorded contact with the cause of religious reform. In 1560 he was sent by Archbishop John Hamilton of St Andrews to John Knox with a message which expressed sympathy for some aspects of religious reform, but urged restraint and the preservation of the existing church structure in the interests of social stability. This approach had no effect on Knox, and although it is not known how far Brand was himself directly involved in the negotiations, these contacts and the prevailing atmosphere in Edinburgh soon had the effect of causing him to join the reformed church as a minister. Having been examined by John Spottiswood, superintendent of Lothian, he was admitted as minister of the Canongate in 1564, in succession to John Craig. Subsequently he also became minister of Edinburgh Castle. On 5 January 1568 he was appointed chaplain of St Ninian beside Trinity College, Edinburgh. The extant kirk session records show that the parish of the Canongate was well administered from the time of Brand's admission. 
Brand was one of the signatories of the letter sent from a meeting of ministers at St Andrews in September 1566 to Theodore Beza, with comments on the second Helvetic confession. At the assembly of June 1567 he was appointed to a commission to confer with crown nominees to consider ecclesiastical jurisdiction and authority as laid down by an act of that assembly. His strong support for the king's party during the troubles of 1571 led to his being banished from Edinburgh for a time. But after a bond had been drawn up on 2 July 1572 a truce was declared on the 31st; the exiles returned and several hundred hagbutters and pikemen marched up the Canongate, with Brand and John Durie, his colleague in Leith, at their head. As a result, within three weeks the queen's party had lost control of the town council to that of the king. The regent subsequently commanded that $58 be paid to Brand out of the thirds of benefices in consideration of his banishment. With his restoration complete, on 24 November he preached before the three estates when they met in the council house in Edinburgh to elect James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, as regent. 
Following the demotion of Ninian Hamilton, a pre-Reformation canon of St Giles who had been first exhorter and later minister of Duddingston, to the position of reader, Brand was given the oversight of that parish in 1574; he probably remained minister until the admission of Charles Lumsden in 1588. Thereafter he was frequently a member of deputations sent by the general assembly to the regent and privy council and later to the king. He was appointed to pronounce excommunication against Alexander Gordon, bishop of Galloway, and he was selected by several assemblies to enforce other decisions concerning the episcopate: in April 1577 he replaced John Spottiswood in summoning Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews; in July 1580 he warned Adam Bothwell, bishop of Orkney, to appear before the assembly; and in 1581 and 1582 he was one of the commissioners who met with the king to discuss the case of Robert Montgomerie, archbishop of Glasgow, whom James appointed but whom the kirk forbade to take office. Brand was one of the ministers who attended the earl of Morton before his execution on 2 June 1581. He preached at the opening of the general assembly of April 1582 in the absence of David Lindsay, the previous assembly's moderator. In 1583 he was one of the assessors to the moderator of the October assembly. 
During the last decade of his life Brand was appointed the visitor of the churches in Tweeddale; later, with others, to the presbytery of Lothian; and finally within months before his death to the presbytery of Peebles. After the passing of the 'Black Acts' of May 1584, he was among those summoned to subscribe them before the privy council in August. At first he demurred, but he finally signed them along with John Craig in December, an act which caused difficulties for several ministers who were still refusing to sign. Two years later, after these problems had been overcome, he was appointed to an assembly commission to deprive unsuitable ministers. He remained active within the general assemblies and his parish until his death in Edinburgh on 2 September 1600. 
Brand was married twice. With his first wife, Elizabeth Johnston, he had a son, James, who on 27 June 1573 received a royal presentation to the chaplaincy of St Thomas-in-the-Canongate for seven years for his sustentation at school, and who had an illegitimate child with Beatrice Delarasche in 1588. With his second wife, Abigail Smith, he had two daughters and a son, John, who as a student at the University of Edinburgh was beheaded in 1615 for murdering William King, an illegitimate son of James King, advocate.

Christison, John (d. 1580/81?), Church of Scotland minister, was a Dominican friar at Montrose by the 1550s. He may have been among those who heard George Wishart preach at Montrose following the latter's return from England in July 1543; like Wishart he almost certainly enjoyed the protection of John Erskine of Dun, hereditary constable of the burgh, after he had himself converted to protestantism. By the spring of 1559 Christison and other evangelical preachers were ministering in Angus (Forfarshire), the Mearns, and Perthshire. The regent, Mary of Guise, responded by ordering that Christison, along with Paul Methven, John Willock, and William Harlaw, should stand trial in the court of justiciary at Stirling on 10 May 1559 for preaching seditious doctrine, usurping the ministerial office, improperly administering the eucharist at Easter, and disobeying Lenten proclamations that threatened capital punishment to anyone who disrupted traditional services. Although the fourth earl of Glencairn and Sir Hugh Campbell of Loudoun, sheriff of Ayr, temporarily dissuaded Mary from proceeding with the trial, she soon reversed course, only to find that the ministers' followers were preparing to gather in Perth and accompany them to Stirling in a show of support. None the less, when Christison and his associates failed to appear at Stirling on the specified day, they were outlawed, while Erskine of Dun, as Christison's surety, was fined. 
By the spring of 1560 Christison had accepted an appointment as minister at Fetteresso, west of Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, with responsibility as well for the churches at Dunnottar and Glenbervie in the same county. He did not, however, have access to the vicarage and parsonage at Dunnottar, which belonged to the deanery of the collegiate church of Holy Trinity, Edinburgh, and were shared by the parsons William Salmond (died 1576) and John Elder (died 1578), and then by Andrew Mylne (to 1579). From 1561 Christison was receiving the pension of $16 per annum allocated to friars who embraced protestantism. In 1563 he was given assistance in his ministerial duties by the appointment of James Paton (or Pawtoun) and John Auchenleck to be readers at Dunnottar and Glenbervie respectively (though Auchenleck stayed less than five years, if he was the man of the same name presented to the vicarage of Menmuir, Angus, on 21 January 1568). Christison remained active at Dunnottar and Fetteresso until at least 1569, but some time before 28 September 1570 he moved to Glenbervie. He was still minister there in 1580, but in 1581 Archibald Douglas, a son of the ninth earl of Angus, is recorded as parson of Glenbervie, suggesting that Christison had now died.

Christison, William (d. 1599), Church of Scotland minister, was born in Fife. Having become a friar, possibly at Aberdeen, he went to Scandinavia, where he may have studied theology at the universities of Copenhagen and Rostock; he certainly lived for a time in Bergen, where his patron was the protestant reformer Geble Pedersson, bishop of Bergen from 1536 to 1557. He also learnt Danish, and in 1560 translated a letter from a cleric at Lund to the St Andrews kirk session regarding spousal desertion. By March 1558 he had returned to Scotland to preach reformed doctrines. After Paul Methven left St Mary's, Dundee, for Jedburgh, the protestant lords of the congregation appointed Christison minister of St Mary's, on 19 July 1560. When the first general assembly met in December 1560, Christison represented Dundee, along with two laymen, and he took an active part in its subsequent meetings, attending at least thirty-eight of the next sixty. In June 1564 he was one of the delegates appointed by the assembly to confer with a group of nobles and courtiers concerning John Knox's hostility to Queen Mary and the right of subjects to resist idolatrous rulers. Six times between December 1565 and October 1577 he served on committees to resolve questions and complaints posed to general assemblies. 
After the rebellion against Queen Mary of August-September 1565, known as the chaseabout raid, Christison tried to assist its protestant leaders, forwarding their letter to his fellow ministers in September 1565 with a recommendation that they support the rebel lords. When the queen discovered this Christison and others in Dundee were put on trial, but most of the offenders escaped with fines. A year later, on 4 September 1566, Christison was one of seven ministers from Angus (Forfarshire) who subscribed the second Helvetic confession, though the Scots refused to celebrate the holy days associated with Christ's life, owing to the absence of biblical precepts. In July 1569 Christison was elected moderator of the general assembly, and was also appointed to the delegation that presented the regent Moray with a statement concerning clerical stipends, relief of the poor, and opposition to pluralism in the church. Four months later he was presented to the vicarage of St Mary's, which had been vacated by the forfeiture for treason of John Hamilton of Samuelston, a supporter of Queen Mary. While he was minister in Dundee, Christison seems to have worked closely with the burgess Roger Melville, James Melville's uncle, for when Roger died, Christison told his nephew that Roger had been 'the carefulest father that ever Dondie haid' ('Autobiography and Diary', 38). 
During the 1570s Christison continued to be a leader in the reformed kirk. In March 1570 the general assembly asked him, along with Knox, John Row, and John Craig, to determine its agenda (an assignment he also undertook in October 1577), and in March 1572 the assembly appointed him to a committee to consider the position of bishops. Its eventual report objected to the use of the terms archbishop, dean, archdeacon, chancellor, and chapter. In the meantime Christison had become involved in the detention of Maurice MacGibbon, archbishop of Cashel, who was arrested at Dundee in April 1572 'en route' for Flanders with letters to the pope and Philip II seeking their intervention to restore the three kingdoms to Roman Catholicism. 
Christison's ministerial duties increased in 1574 as he assumed responsibility for the church at Ballumbie, which he seems to have retained until 1585. In April 1576 the general assembly asked him and four others to determine the best procedure for visitations in Angus and Mearns, and he was also named a visitor for the University of St Andrews. The same assembly appointed him to a commission to examine church polity, and the appointment was renewed in October. In response to an inquiry from Queen Elizabeth the general assembly in October 1577 recommended Christison, Andrew Melville, and six others to the regent Morton as possible delegates to an assembly in Magdeburg to draft a confession of faith; Melville and George Hay were nominated but did not go. The following year Christison helped to draft the second 'Book of Discipline', and the general assembly appointed him a visitor for Angus and Mearns in 1578-80 and for Mar in 1578. Six times between July 1579 and April 1593 he served on committees advising moderators of the general assembly, and in October 1580 he was appointed by the assembly to see that Andrew Melville was installed as principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews. The following year the assembly made Christison a commissioner for the establishment of elderships (presbyteries) in Angus, and appointed him to committees to review procedures for the trial and ordination of ministers and to select a pastor for St Andrews. Later assemblies appointed him a commissioner to visit the universities in October 1582, and specifically St Andrews in October 1583. In May 1586 he was again designated a commissioner for the erection of presbyteries in Angus. With others he was authorized in May 1586 to oversee the commissioners for Angus and Mearns, and in June 1587 to review their records. 
In February 1590 Christison became a commissioner to take subscriptions from Jesuits, seminary priests, and excommunicated persons in Angus. The same year his church at Dundee obtained another minister to assist him, probably because advancing age was rendering him unable to fulfil all his responsibilities. Nevertheless, in the autumn of 1592 he took his place in a ministerial network established to monitor Roman Catholic activities; the ministers of Mearns, Brechin, Arbroath, and Meigle reported to him, and he in turn reported to Adam Mitchell at Coupar. By March 1598, however, Christison was too frail to continue his work as a commissioner, and the general assembly thereupon named Robert Howie, principal of New College, Aberdeen, to succeed him as minister of Dundee. Christison died on 16 October 1599 and was survived by his wife, Anna, 'nee' Wynton.

Cowper, John (d. 1603), Church of Scotland minister, was the son of John Cowper, burgess and tailor of Edinburgh -- deacon of the tailors in 1574 -- and his wife, Marion Duncan; William Cowper (1568-1619), bishop of Galloway, was his brother. John Cowper studied at St Mary's College, St Andrews, where he graduated BA in 1577. Prior to his appointment to a parish, on 3 February 1586, James VI commanded him to pray for Mary, queen of Scots, from the pulpit of St Giles, Edinburgh, something which most of the kirk's ministers had refused to do. When Cowper also refused, the king ordered him to vacate the pulpit in favour of Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews. Cowper appeared before the king and privy council that afternoon and was warded in Blackness Castle at his own expense. The town council supported him to the extent of granting him $40 Scots to meet the expenses which he incurred during his confinement. On 22 March a bond of caution for $500 Scots was provided by his father and Andrew Borthwick on his release, on the understanding that he would make satisfaction to the king for his offence and would not preach or administer the sacraments without the king's licence. The bond continued to be held by the privy council until the following year. 
On 23 November 1586 Cowper was elected one of the ministers of Edinburgh. He did not serve for long, being translated and inducted to the collegiate charge of Glasgow on 28 February 1587. There is no record of his being further involved in public affairs, but at the general assembly of 1602 he was appointed to visit the churches of Lothian. He died in Glasgow on 25 December 1603. Cowper was married to Elizabeth, sister of John Livingston of Baldoran, who survived him. Their son John was bursar of the University of Glasgow in 1603, and in 1614 their daughter Janet married Joseph Laurie, successively minister of Kirkintilloch, Stirling, Longforgan, and finally Perth, where Laurie held the collegiate charge which had once been his wife's uncle's (from 1635 to 1640). Objections to the marriage by Janet's curators, who revealingly included members of the influential Livingston and Fleming families, were not sustained by the presbytery of Glasgow.

Ferrerio, Giovanni (1502-1579), historian and humanist writer, was born on 25 March 1502 in Riva di Chieri, near Turin, the son of Martino Ferrerio and Caterina Finelli. His father was distantly related to the episcopal family of Ivrea and Vercelli, but Giovanni did not look for a place in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Having been educated in Chieri (1507?-1515?) and Turin (1515?-1525), he enrolled at the University of Paris in 1525. There he met Hector Boece and George Buchanan, and also Robert Reid, then abbot-designate of the Cistercian monastery of Kinloss. In 1528 Ferrerio accompanied Reid to Scotland, where he spent three years at the court of James V. During this time he dedicated a work to James, 'De vera cometae significatione', printed in Paris in 1540. However, court life did not suit Ferrerio and in 1531 he moved to Kinloss Abbey, both to undertake private study and to act as tutor to the monks. 
After seven years at Kinloss, Ferrerio decided to return to Italy. In 1537 he was in Piedmont, but he then lived for three years in Paris (1538-41). Under the Latin name of Joannes Ferrerius he became concerned with the printing of humanist works and acted as a corrector to Vascosan, the university publisher and bookseller. He also continued to write, contributing prefaces to some works, such as Mirandola's 'De animorum immortalitate' (1541), and composing some books himself, such as 'Academica de animarum immortalitate' (1539), 'Auditum visu praestate, contra vulgatum Aristotelis placitum academica' (1539), and 'Cicero, poeta etiam elegans nedum ineptum fuisse' (1540). At Easter 1541 Reid persuaded Ferrerio to return to Kinloss, settling on him a lifelong pension of $40 Scots, a servant, and two horses. Ferrerio resumed his teaching duties; among his pupils this time were five monks from the neighbouring Cistercian house of Beauly. He gave general lectures to the whole monastery and offered private tutoring to selected monks. His aim was to teach eloquence by examining approved texts. Those used for his lectures included some of Cicero's philosophical treatises, for example 'De officiis' and 'Somnium Scipionis'. Ferrerio's tutoring developed the lectures and discussed such other writers as Terence and Virgil. Rhetorical and grammatical theory was studied, using texts ranging from Quintilian and Cicero to Valla and Melancthon. 
While Ferrerio seems to have been popular in Scotland and also to have been impressed with the scholarship he found there, the instability of the realm, and possibly its incipient protestantism after the death of James V, drove him back to Paris in 1545. He remained interested in Scotland, however, and attempted to collect biological material from Scotland for Conrad Gesner, although the Scottish political situation meant that his queries often went unanswered. In 1550, despite his personal liking for George Buchanan, Ferrerio's evidence was partly responsible for Buchanan's arrest for heresy in Portugal. This may have recommended him to at least one Scottish Catholic family, for by 1553 Ferrerio appears to have been acting as guardian for the sons (officially 'nephews') of Cardinal Beaton, since Marion Ogilvie, the cardinal's mistress and mother of his children, authorized substantial payments to Ferrerio that year. 
Ferrerio's most important link with Scotland, however, was historiographical. During his stay at Kinloss he had composed the life of Thomas Crystall, the abbot-administrator of the abbey, which was finished in 1535, the year of Crystall's death; he then went on to write an account of earlier abbots, the 'Historia abbatum de Kynlos' (completed in 1537). Ferrerio's life of Crystall is hagiographic, and for the earlier history of Kinloss he was plagued by a lack of sources beyond the abbey's own records, but these allowances made, the works are informative and models of good Latin style. Ferrerio also contributed Scottish material for Carion's 'Chronici ab orbe condito' (1551; reprinted until 1563). Such expertise made him entirely suitable for the task of producing an extended edition of Hector Boece's 'Scotorum historia' (1574-5; distributed in Paris by Jacques Dupuy). This contains two further books by Boece, left unfinished at his death in 1536, together with Ferrerio's summary of the reign of James III, which completes book 19. In his preface to the additional material Ferrerio says that numerous people urged him to the undertaking; the most importunate of these was Henry Sinclair, the dean of Glasgow. Sinclair was a notable collector of historical manuscripts, and may have numbered Boece's additional books among them, although Ferrerio may equally have possessed them, since he knew Boece well. Sinclair had even begun to prepare his own account of later medieval Scotland, but died in 1565 before this was complete. It was presumably upon this that Ferrerio based his own supplementary narrative, but it is impossible to identify particular sources within the latter. 
Ferrerio died in Paris in 1579, after a distinguished career as scholar and teacher. While his activities in publishing in Paris contributed to the development of humanism on the continent, his work in and about Scotland had a greater impact, at least within that small realm. His welcome at court suggests that James V, although not famed as an intellectual, was not antagonistic to the new movements. Ferrerio's teaching in Scotland spread humanist methods of study and in his own writing he advanced the place of Scottish historiography. In republishing the 'Scotorum historia' he found a new audience for Boece's interpretation of the Scottish past, and perhaps facilitated the reception of the subsequent histories of Buchanan and John Lesley; his supplement to the 'Scotorum historia' offers an interpretation of James III as a grasping monarch under the influence of favourites, a reputation which historians began to modify only late in the twentieth century.

Harlaw, William (c.1500-1578), Church of Scotland minister, was born in Edinburgh, where he became a tailor in the Canongate. He was associated with the early stages of the movement for religious reform in Scotland and fled to England, where he is said to have been ordained a deacon. However, it is quite certain that he was never appointed a chaplain to Edward VI, as has also been claimed. Probably he has been confused with John Harley, later bishop of Hereford. Harlaw returned to Edinburgh on the death of Edward VI, unlike some of the more prominent Scottish reformers who fled to the continent. There he became one of the ministers who conducted services privately in the homes of evangelicals. Later he also preached in public, and, as the number of unofficial congregations grew, he travelled widely throughout the country. Denounced for preaching at Dumfries in 1558, he was summoned to appear before the lord justice at Stirling on 10 May 1559, when he was proclaimed a rebel along with Paul Methven, John Christison, and John Willock, for usurping the authority of the church in taking into his own hands the ministry within the burgh of Perth and places nearby. He may have come to know John Willock and other Scottish exiles during his stay in England; he certainly held similar theological views to theirs, which were greatly influenced by Zwingli and Bullinger. 
Harlaw became minister of St Cuthbert's, Edinburgh, in 1560, and was a commissioner for St Cuthbert's along with Robert Fairley of Braid at the first general assembly, which began on 20 December that year. He was also present at the assembly of June 1562, his last recorded appearance there. He does not appear to have ever been appointed by a general assembly to undertake any duties on behalf of the church, but concentrated on his ministry within Edinburgh. On 25 June 1566, a supplication was presented to the assembly on behalf of Robert Stewart, commendator of Holyrood Abbey and patron of the benefice, for the appointment of a former canon of Holyrood as minister of St Cuthbert's in place of Harlaw. The assembly summoned some of the elders of the parish, who opposed this proposal because -- according to the order of admission of ministers to parishes -- the congregation had to 'elect' the presentee. The congregation was not prepared to do this, and Harlaw remained minister there. Following the death of the vicar, Archibald Hamilton, who had been in possession since at least 1547, Harlaw was presented to the vicarage under the privy seal on 6 February 1573. From 1574, however, he was overshadowed by the appointment of Robert Pont, one of the outstanding ministers of that era, as his junior colleague. On his death in 1578 Harlaw was succeeded by Pont. Nothing is known of Harlaw's wife, but she may have been English, as their grandson William, the son of Nathaniel, minister of Ormiston, became a minister in the Church of England.

MacDowell, John (b. c.1500, d. in or after 1566), Dominican friar and evangelical reformer, was born in Galloway, entered the Dominicans at an unknown date, and was created bachelor of theology by 1524, when the general chapter of his order recorded this fact; it is probable that he studied at Cologne like his fellow friar, John Macalpine, whose degree was recorded at the same time. In 1530 MacDowell was incorporated as a sub-prior of Glasgow in Glasgow University. By 1533-4 he was prior of Wigtown, but had probably left the country by May of that year, bound it seems for France. A certain 'Dr Maydland' was alleged to have preached treason against Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn in the London Blackfriars in 1534; this was clearly MacDowell, though he was only a theology bachelor. He went on to the port of Rye, where he stayed with a Scottish priest-physician, Peter Cochrane, and borrowed from the vicar a book by Johann Eck attacking Henry VIII. Under the skilful management of one of Thomas Cromwell's agents, however, he won the patronage of Cromwell and rapidly altered his views. Presented to a chantry of the London Carthusians, on whom he was urged as a preacher once a week by the agent, he was refused, but he did inspect their library. 
MacDowell is next heard of as chaplain to the reformed bishop of Salisbury, Nicholas Shaxton, and in 1537 he was commissioned to preach the Lenten sermon. The civic authorities disliked his preaching, and he responded in a sermon at St Edmund's, Salisbury. Cromwell tried to make peace between the parties. On 1 March 1536 MacDowell had been licensed by Cranmer to hold any non-resident benefice, provided he cast aside his Dominican habit. He became a naturalized Englishman in July 1537 (when the vicar of Croydon complained that he damned all singing and organ playing) and in October was made rector of Hawkchurch, Dorset. In 1549 he was in London and preached at St Mary Staining, and also at the burial service for the merchant Christopher Machyn. Arrangements are found in a Sussex will for him to preach in Pett parish church with another reformed preacher, Mr Thomas Rose. MacDowell also preached against King Edward's first prayer book of 1549, which roused the London aldermen against him, so that he soon went briefly into exile. Along with the wives of John Rogers and others, his foreign wife and children were granted English nationality after a petition dated March 1552; in the previous month, as a bachelor of divinity, MacDowell was given licence to preach. However, the accession of Mary Tudor as queen forced him into exile again, and he is mentioned in two lists of exiles from 1557, which record him as Madwell and Maydwell respectively. In 1566 Knox said he was a burgermeister in the 'Steads', presumably Friesland or north Germany. Nothing further is recorded of MacDowell, and it is not known when he died.

Nisbet, Murdoch (fl. 1531-c.1559), biblical translator, was a notary public in the diocese of Glasgow. A resident of Hardhill in the parish of Loudoun, Ayrshire, Nisbet's notarial work associated him with known religious dissidents in the area around Kyle and Cunninghame, and particularly with the Campbells of Cessnock and Lockharts of Bar. He took part in 'Bible' reading in a conventicle, an activity which was prosecuted elsewhere in the diocese as early as 1531. The group read from a manuscript 'New Testament' translated by Nisbet into Scots from the revised version of the Lollard 'New Testament'. Nisbet's manuscript 'New Testament' survived for some time as a family heirloom, but it was eventually sold and is now in the British Library (Egerton MS 2880). Although the manuscript does not bear Nisbet's name, it does bear an embellishment on several verso leaves which resembles Nisbet's notarial instrument; this, in addition to his family's ownership of the text, suggests that he was in fact the copyist. The biblical text, along with some of the 'Old Testament' epistles, was copied with slightly elaborated initials in red and green, and such other features as running book and chapter headings. 
The date of transcription is impossible to determine; a later family memoir claims that Nisbet had to flee abroad some time during the reign of James V because of his beliefs, during which time he 'took a Copy of the 'New Testament' in Writ' (Nisbet, 3). At a later date, the manuscript was augmented with additions drawn from Miles Coverdale's 'New Testament', published by James Nycolson at Southwark in late 1537 or early 1538 ('STC' 2838). These include a preface to the 'New Testament', Tyndale's revised preface to 'Romans', book summaries divided by chapter, marginal glosses and cross-references, and liturgical reading markers; all of them, like the text, were transcribed into Scots. A few changes to the text were also made, most significantly the altering of 'sacrament' to 'secret' in nine places. This second stage of textual composition was produced with a less careful, perhaps more rushed hand than that of the 'New Testament' text, though it is possible that it was still Nisbet's work. The additional material presents throughout a developed solafideist theology, with occasional anti-papal or anti-monastic glosses. In the preface to 'Romans', Tyndale's later position on law and gospel is set out along with much basic Lutheran theological material. 
The only significant alteration made by the copyist in this second stage was the omission of a gloss on 'Matthew' 5: 34 which mitigated Christ's prohibition on swearing, which suggests that although Nisbet's circle readily accepted much of protestant theology it was unwilling to depart from its typically Lollard aversion to swearing. That this should be so after 1538 shows that Lollardy had a lasting, if limited, influence in the south-west of Scotland. The family memoir reports that in 1539 Nisbet 'digged and built a Vault in the Bottom of his own House' to avoid detection of his conventicle's 'Bible' reading; he emerged during the regency of Mary of Guise, that is, some time between 1554 and 1559, to take part in iconoclastic activity 'tho' then an old Man' (Nisbet, 3). The date of his death is not recorded. Knox and his historiographical successors do not mention Nisbet, but this may reflect the limitations of their researches rather than the true extent of his importance. Among Nisbet's descendants was a martyr of the covenanter cause, John Nisbet, who was executed in 1685.

Stewart, Robert, earl of Lennox and earl of March (1522/3-1586), bishop-elect of Caithness and magnate, was the second son of John Stewart, twelfth or third earl of Lennox (d. 1526), and his wife, Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of the first earl of Atholl. In 1548 he was a student at St Andrews, and he later disposed of books which suggest that he retained an interest in theology, since they included works by Bullinger, Calvin, and Erasmus. Briefly provost of Lincluden collegiate church in 1529, in the following year he was provided to the provostry of the collegiate church of Dumbarton, though he does not appear to have occupied the benefice until 1539. Having resigned it in 1546 he was reinstated in 1564, retaining the dignity until 1570. On 8 September 1541 he was nominated bishop of Caithness and papally provided on 27 January following. As he was too young to be ordained priest he was only the administrator of the diocese -- he could not receive title to the see until his twenty-seventh year. In fact he was never consecrated bishop, but he none the less retained the revenues for the rest of his life. 
Following the death of James V on 14 December 1542 the third earl of Arran was appointed governor of Scotland. However, Robert's brother Matthew Stewart, thirteenth or fourth earl of Lennox, had returned from France to contest the appointment and when Arran, having at first responded to English diplomacy, changed tack late in 1543 and allied himself with France, Lennox, who had come to Scotland as Arran's agent, promptly became agent for Henry VIII. On 17 May 1544 Robert Stewart, who was to remain in England as a hostage, was a signatory at Carlisle to the indenture whereby his brother (and the third earl of Glencairn) undertook to promote religious reform and to provide support to English military operations in south-west Scotland, while Henry VIII agreed to Lennox's becoming governor and to his marrying Margaret Douglas, only daughter and heir of the sixth earl of Angus and Margaret Tudor, widow of James V and Henry's sister. Lennox's military campaign failed, but the marriage took place on 6 July following, leading to the earl's forfeiture for treason on 9 October. 
In December 1545 Robert Stewart's activities had been referred to the pope by Arran's government, with the request that he be summoned to Rome and that Alexander Gordon, brother of the fourth earl of Huntly, be provided to the see. Gordon appears to have received some of the revenues, and only withdrew his claim in 1548. Stewart obtained a crown remission and escaped forfeiture, but his revenues were sequestrated by Cardinal Beaton on the grounds of his political association with Henry VIII, so he remained in England. On 24 March 1546, though still not of canonical age, he was appointed by the crown to the canonry of the eleventh prebend in Canterbury Cathedral. He had resigned it by 9 May 1548. Only three weeks after his preferment at Canterbury he returned to Scotland; he arrived at Dumbarton on 27 May 1546, and submitted himself to the crown and governor on 16 July. Following two years of negotiations it was resolved on 6 August 1548 that Gordon should renounce his claim to the diocese of Caithness in return for a pension, and Stewart was restored to the see. In September 1550 he went to France (at his own request) in the retinue of the queen dowager, Mary of Guise. He returned no earlier than October 1551. 
Stewart now took up the administration of his diocese. Until at least 1558, when he attended the execution of the protestant Walter Mylne, he seems to have remained conservative in religion, and his management of his bishopric was in some respects old-fashioned too, for in 1553 he granted all the lands of his see to his brother-in-law, the eleventh earl of Sutherland. Yet he may have been influenced by the evangelical sympathies of his brother the earl of Lennox, and also by his own stay in England, for by 1561 the English ambassador wrote of Stewart, who was then in Edinburgh, that he 'comes daily to the sermon and is reputed honest enough' (Donaldson, 58). Stewart resided in his diocese almost continuously throughout the 1560s and applied himself to reforming its parishes, above all by installing protestant ministers, who were maintained partly at his own expense. Donald Munro, archdeacon of the isles and commissioner of Ross, was appointed to assist Stewart in preaching and establishing churches, no doubt because he knew Gaelic. A year later it was reported that Stewart himself 'sometimes preaches' (Kirk, 215). 
In October 1570 Stewart's appointment as commendator of St Andrews Priory largely ended his involvement with his diocese. The administration of the latter was left to commissioners, while Stewart was reported (by James Melville, admittedly a highly partial witness) to have devoted much of his time to golf and archery. In 1576 his nephew Charles Stewart, earl of Lennox, died leaving only a daughter, and on 16 June 1578 Robert as his male heir was created earl. Early in 1580, however, he was persuaded to resign the title in favour of the king's favourite, Esme Stewart, and on 5 March he was created earl of March instead. On 6 December 1578 he had married Elizabeth Stewart (c.1554-1595?), daughter of the fourth earl of Atholl, but on 19 May 1581 she divorced him on grounds of impotency (though he is reported to have had an illegitimate daughter), and shortly afterwards she married James Stewart, earl of Arran, with whose child she was already pregnant. Robert Stewart had resigned his office in St Andrews by October 1585, but he remained nominally the diocesan of Caithness until he died in St Andrews on 29 August 1586, aged sixty-three. He was buried in St Leonard's Church, St Andrews.

Somerset, James (b. c.1741, d. in or after 1772), slave, was born in Africa. He was bought by European slave traders and left Africa on 10 March 1749. He must have reached Virginia either on 23 May on the 'William' (from Liverpool via Calabar and Antigua) or, more likely, on 26 June on the 'Susanna' (probably from Liverpool via an unknown African port). On 1 August he was sold in Virginia to Charles Stewart or Steuart, a successful Scottish merchant who became a senior colonial customs official. During his captivity he was known simply as Somerset. 
In summer 1768 Stewart requested leave to return to England, explaining that his health had been impaired by extensive travelling. He arrived in England on 10 November 1769, accompanied by Somerset, probably in the capacity of a trusted personal servant. On 10 February 1771 Somerset, who was then living (presumably with Stewart) in Baldwin's Gardens, Holborn, was baptized James Summersett at the church of St Andrew, Holborn. The baptismal register describes him as an 'adult black', aged about thirty. Although the baptism may reflect a genuine religious experience, it also had a wider significance, since it was popularly believed to confer manumission. There was no legal precedent either to confirm or dispel such a belief, but it was so pervasive that almost all British colonies that tolerated slavery had passed legislation explicitly repudiating it. It is likely therefore that Somerset's baptism signalled his first step in asserting his freedom: perhaps he was already being advised by abolitionists. 
In what was later described as 'a singular instance of ingratitude' ('GM', 443), Somerset left Stewart's service on 1 October 1771 and refused to return. His freedom lasted a bare two months: on 26 November he was seized and imprisoned. His friends promptly applied for a writ of habeas corpus to free him and his plight attracted the attention and support of Granville Sharp. Somerset's case posed considerable difficulties. Precedents concerning the legality of slavery in England were confused and contradictory, and slavery was deeply embedded into the economic fabric of the British empire. William Murray, Lord Mansfield, the then lord chief justice, did his best to persuade the parties to settle. Only when it became clear that it had become a test case did he agree to a hearing. 
The return to the habeas corpus was carefully constructed to make the issues as simple as possible. It did not mention Somerset's baptism and so did not raise the question of manumission. It stated that 'negro slaves' were chattel goods, that Somerset was a slave according to the laws of Virginia and Africa, and that he was detained by order of his master in order to be sent to Jamaica and sold. The legal argument was therefore focused on whether slavery was legal in England and whether an English court could uphold colonial laws if they conflicted with English ones. Mansfield's carefully worded judgment, however, concentrated on the legality of forcible deportation. Since this was governed by a statute of 1679 (31 Charles II c.2 s.12), this enabled Mansfield to sidestep the wider issues. His judgment, delivered in July 1772, conceded an important but limited advancement of slave rights, in that invoking the 1679 statute established that slaves were servants, rather than chattels. It freed Somerset from imprisonment but left his status as a slave unresolved. However, it was widely believed that Mansfield had freed Somerset from slavery and this interpretation of the judgment has passed into Anglo-American legal mythology. Somerset himself believed that Mansfield had declared slavery to be illegal, and wrote to at least one other slave encouraging him to desert his master, on the grounds that 'Lord Mansfield had given them their freedom' (Oldham, 'New light on Mansfield', 66). 
As for Somerset himself, there is little to add. When he stepped out of Westminster Hall in July 1772 he also stepped out of the historical record. Nothing is known, as yet, of his life (or death) after that date, and he remains very much a shadow at the centre of events controlled by others.

Quaque, Philip (1741-1816), first African Church of England clergyman and missionary, was born at Cape Coast and named Kweku, the name to indicate born on Wednesdays. A Fante, he was reputedly the son, but more likely a remoter relative, of Cudjoe Caboceer, the intermediary between the local Fante and the African Company, which administered the British trading fort, Cape Coast Castle. In 1751 the London based Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) sent a missionary to Cape Coast, Thomas Thompson, who in 1754 sent three Fante boys, William Cudjo, Thomas Caboro, and Quaque, to London to be educated. Cudjo died in 1758 but Caboro and Quaque were educated first at Mr Hickman's school, Islington, and Philip was baptized at Islington parish church on 7 January 1759. The two boys spent the next seven years there under the tuition of the Revd John Moore in Charterhouse Square (he is sometimes said, wrongly, to have studied at Oxford University). In 1765 he became the first African to be ordained a priest of the Church of England. The SPG then appointed him a missionary with a $50 salary. Before leaving London he married, on 2 May 1765, an English wife, Catherine Blunt (died 1766), and returned with her to Cape Coast in 1766. 
Quaque was also appointed by the African Company chaplain at Cape Coast Castle with a $60 salary, plus a $13 allowance for his wife, who died soon after in November 1766. On arrival he wrote at once to the SPG committee in London with his news, and from then on regularly sent them detailed and lucid letters recording his views and activities. The society, however, took little interest in them and he received only three letters in return. In his first letter he lamented that all the company's employees, whose spiritual welfare he was responsible for, lived unmarried with African women. Moreover, over the succeeding fifty years of his ministry he was to find that most of them not only ignored the company's regulation that they attend prayers, but lived wholly unchristian lives. Many even refused to send their children to the school he opened for their use. Sometimes the governors were hostile: one openly ridiculed religion. But the company supported Quaque and eventually raised his salary to $150. Though rarely more than half a dozen children, almost all Eurafricans, ever attended his school, he provided them with a basic, useful schooling (some became clerks in the company's service), and has thus been counted a pioneer of European education in Ghana. 
Quaque's other role, as a missionary, was even less fruitful. During his years in London he had lost his fluency in Fante and found it difficult to explain the Christian gospel in what he called a 'vile jargon' (Priestley, 123n.). He performed a few baptisms, but made not one convert. None the less Quaque's status as a black African missionary to Africa gave him prominence in the SPG's annual reports, though references to him declined by the 1780s. He lived in the style of his European colleagues. To avoid the accusation that he was copying their morals (so he wrote to the SPG), after his wife died in November 1766 he married her Fante waiting maid in September 1769. When she died a few months later, in April 1770, he married another Fante woman, in March 1772. With his substantial salary he could afford to live in comfort, and so moved out of the dilapidated old fort and built himself a house in the adjoining town, with mahogany furniture and a library. From time to time he would visit the other trading forts along the coast and in 1784 he took his son and daughter to London to be educated. Quaque's teacher John Moore had died in 1768 but he maintained a close relationship with Moore's son, also John, who arranged for the education of his children. Quaque's latter years seem to have been unhappy. His last surviving letter, of 1811, reported severe ill health and included a long diatribe against the mistreatment of his wife and children by his extended African family. During his last five years he refrained from drawing his SPG salary and when he died at Cape Coast Castle on 17 October 1816 there was a balance of $369 which, with another $100, he had bequeathed to his successor as missionary. But as he too had died by the time the SPG received the news, the money was sent to Quaque's heirs. Quaque, who was buried at Cape Coast Castle, seems to have taken no part in local political affairs, nor, unsurprisingly, given that he was the employee of a company principally concerned with the slave trade, any part in the campaign to abolish it. However, Quaque's correspondence also makes clear that he regarded the trade as a bulwark against the progress of his mission, saying in 1771 to Edward Bass, SPG missionary to Newburyport, Massachusetts, that of 'the many Obstacles & Difficulties' the principal was 'the horrid Slave Trade' (Glasson, 45). It was an opinion Quaque had expressed before to Samuel Johnson, SPG missionary and later president of King's College, New York, and would continue to develop to Bass and others during the 1770s and 1780s.

Hamilton, Robert (d. 1581), Church of Scotland minister, was the seventh son of Gavin Hamilton of Orbiston, Lanarkshire, and his wife, Marion Wallace. He studied at the University of St Andrews in the early 1550s, and by 1559 was working with John Knox and the protestant lords of the congregation. At the beginning of August that year he and Knox conferred with Sir James Croft in Berwick Castle in the hope of securing assistance from the English government for the congregation, but none was then forthcoming. On 20 December 1560 the general assembly declared Hamilton qualified for the ministry. With Knox, John Row, and George Hay, he met at the house of Sir James McGill, clerk register, in early November 1561, to argue for the right of subjects to suppress the idolatry of their sovereign (that is, Queen Mary's hearing of mass), but the ministers were opposed by a number of leading laymen, including the earl of Morton and Lord James Stewart. At the general assembly of December 1563 Hamilton and others came to Knox's defence, recalling that at the Reformation he had been commissioned to convene the brethren if the church was threatened. Hamilton was apparently in some kind of trouble himself by late 1565, for on 26 December Knox and three superintendents issued a testimonial on his and Robert Campbell's behalf, declaring: 'causes of treasoun ar laid to the charge of innocent men, thare substances ar spoiled, and thare lives ar sought, because thei have travaled for mantenance of vertu and suppressing of ydolatrie, of which nomber, these our brethern... haith bene tuo chief men. ('Works of John Knox', 6.430)' By 4 September 1566 Hamilton had succeeded Christopher Goodman as minister of St Andrews. On that date Hamilton was one of fourteen ministers who wrote to Theodore Beza endorsing the second Helvetic confession, excepting only its provisions for the celebration of the holy days associated with Christ's life. He attended the general assemblies of June 1567, July 1568, July 1569, March 1572 (when he was moderator), March 1573, and April, June, and October 1576, and served on committees to hear complaints and requests, revise the superintendents' visitation schedules (July 1568), review visitation records (April 1576), and discuss policy (autumn 1576). In July 1569 he was a member of the assembly's delegation that presented articles dealing with clerical maintenance, the appointment of superintendents, and a protest against pluralism to the regent and nobles. 
In the political upheavals of the early 1570s Hamilton came under pressure from both sides. In July 1570 he was denounced by James Carmichael, schoolmaster in St Andrews, for failing to condemn the assassins of the earl of Moray. In the civil strife of 1571 he remained neutral, though his kinsmen were among those supporters of Queen Mary who seized control of Edinburgh in April; however, he was criticized for his neutralism by students of St Leonard's College, St Andrews, who supported the king's forces. Yet when Knox attacked the Hamiltons and Sir William Kirkaldy for backing Mary's cause, Hamilton is alleged to have accused him of being himself as much a murderer as any Hamilton for having discussed with Moray plans to murder the earl of Darnley. Knox wrote to Hamilton in November denying the charge, and he also asked Archbishop John Douglas and John Rutherford to urge Hamilton to render satisfaction. Although Hamilton denied Knox's charge, a meeting of the two men accomplished nothing. Richard Bannatyne, Knox's secretary, wrote scathingly of Hamilton's altered preaching, contrasting his willingness to reprove Mary and her court while she was on the throne with his reticence to speak out after the Hamiltons embraced the queen's cause. Hamilton's election as moderator of the general assembly on 6 March 1572 seems not to have been achieved without opposition, 'for thingis went not as the most godly and upricht desyred' (Bannatyne, 227); James Melville regarded him as evil-minded because of his opposition to Knox and 'the guid cause' ('Autobiography and Diary', 26). Contemporary comments on his sermons suggest that he had sought to rise above the partisan strife by addressing general spiritual concerns. 
In August 1574 the general assembly ordered Hamilton and his elders and deacons to respond to allegations that they had tolerated Robin Hood plays during a fast ordered by the assembly as well as secular plays on the sabbath, and had failed to hold exercises for ministers and elders to study scripture. Appearing before the Edinburgh session on 24 February 1575, Hamilton declared he had known nothing of the fast, that he had asked the magistrates to ban the Robin Hood plays, and that he and his elders were too busy to convene exercises. Accused also of not preaching on Friday and Sunday afternoons, he averred that he was only following Goodman's practice. 
On 17 January 1575 Hamilton had accepted appointment as principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews, which he also served as a regent (master), and where, owing to reforms in 1574, he did some lecturing on Hebrew. In April 1576, however, the general assembly, whose approval to accept the provostship Hamilton had not sought, objected to his holding two positions, and in October it ordered him to resign the provostship because it impeded the performance of his ministerial duties. He refused, even after a meeting with James Martin, master of St Salvator's, but was finally deprived of his provostship, probably on 13 December 1579 and certainly by 17 June 1580. He later proceeded against his successor, Andrew Melville, for arrears of salary, prompting the latter to appeal to parliamentary commissioners for relief. The case, unresolved at the time of Hamilton's death in Edinburgh on 16 April 1581, was continued by his widow and children. At an unrecorded date he had married Elizabeth (or Elspeth), daughter of John Traill the younger of Magask. They had four children, Robert, James, Thomas, and Helen, who married Robert Hamilton (died 'c'.1595), minister of Kennoway, Fife. After Hamilton's death, Elizabeth married Thomas Buchanan, minister of Ceres, Fife, and nephew of the historian George Buchanan. She died on 9 December 1595.

Hay, Andrew (d. 1593), Church of Scotland minister, was the son of William Hay, fourth laird of Talla, and his wife, Janet Spottiswood; George Hay, minister of Eddleston and Rathven, was his brother. Andrew Hay was a university graduate, possibly of Glasgow, and also studied at Paris, where he learned Greek. In 1556 he was a canon of Glasgow Cathedral, holding the prebend of Renfrew -- a vicar-pensioner served the parish. Two years later he was himself rector and parson there. In 1559 Hay conformed to the Reformation and then became parson and minister of Hamilton. From no later than 1564 he was also commissary of Hamilton and Dunserf. He was assisted by a reader, William Jackson, who may have been a chaplain in Glasgow Cathedral before 1555. Following the murder of David Riccio, Queen Mary's secretary, on 9 March 1566, Hay was accused of involvement in the crime, and in July he was warded within the burgh of Dunbar and 2 miles around. He was released on the queen's orders on 29 January 1567. 
Hay became very active in the administration of the kirk. On the reconstitution of the chapter of Glasgow Cathedral in 1572 he was appointed dean, and early in that year was one of the commissioners who negotiated the convention of Leith, settling the administrative structure of the kirk. He attended almost every general assembly, served on a number of committees, and from 1578 to 1590 acted as one of the assessors to the moderator. He was himself moderator of the assemblies of March 1573 and August 1580. Between 1569 and 1587 Hay was often named to deputations appointed to present petitions from the assembly to, variously, the regent, the privy council, and the king, and from 1569 until 1588 successive assemblies appointed him the commissioner to visit kirks in Clydesdale, Renfrew, and Lennox. On 6 March 1589 the privy council made him a commissioner for the maintenance of the true religion in Clydesdale. 
In 1569 Hay became rector of Glasgow University, then in a state of advanced decay; he held the position until 1586. In 1573 he was closely involved in the process whereby the town council of Glasgow not only conveyed former ecclesiastical revenues to the university, thereby stabilizing the latter's finances, but also substantially rewrote the university's constitution. A year later he encouraged Andrew Melville to come to Glasgow as principal of the university, to whose library he himself gave books. In 1580 he tried in vain to oppose Melville's departure from Glasgow for St Mary's College, St Andrews. In the meantime he collaborated with Melville in the production of the second 'Book of Discipline' (1578). Closely involved throughout, he was one of the members of the assembly to whom the preparation of a draft text was entrusted, his responsibility being the section dealing with the kirk's ministry. Like Melville he favoured a presbyterian structure of church government; he was described as one 'wha lyked never those bischopries and wha specialie was the ernest suttar for Mr Andro Melvill' (Kirk, 55). Hay showed his hostility to bishops during the efforts made by successive governments between 1581 and 1585 to install Robert Montgomerie in the see of Glasgow. In 1582 Hay protested to the privy council in the name of the kirk, and so prominent was he in the opposition to the new bishop that in May 1584 he was denounced as a rebel and warded north of the Tay. 
In 1586 Hay resigned as rector of Glasgow University. For the rest of his life he was seldom involved in church affairs beyond the bounds of his parish. He was censured in 1592 for shortcomings which included failing to execute discipline at Renfrew and not preaching on Sunday afternoons (which may have been due to old age). No later than 1566 he had married Janet Wallace of Craigie, almost certainly the daughter of the John Wallace who was prominent among the godly lairds of Ayrshire in 1559-60 and who married Margaret Cunningham, daughter of the staunchly protestant fourth earl of Glencairn. Three of their sons became ministers, John at Renfrew, succeeding his father, Theodore at Peebles, and Andrew at Erskine; another son, David, became commissary clerk of Glasgow. Andrew Hay died in 1593.

Paton, Catherine Forrester- (1855-1914), philanthropist and a founder of women's missionary training in Scotland, was born on 1 June 1855 at Claremont Bank, Alloa; she was the second child and only daughter of Alexander Forrester (1823-1883), merchant and woollen manufacturer, and his wife, Mary (1813-1881), youngest daughter of John Paton of Kilncraigs, Alloa, founder of the woollen manufacturing business of John Paton & Son, and his wife, Catherine Kirk. Her father, by then partner and accountant in the family firm, assumed the name Paton in 1860. Her formal education, at Alloa Academy and then at Grange House School, Edinburgh, finished when she was fifteen, and she returned home to help ageing parents. Sharing their evangelical outlook and devotion to the United Presbyterian church she gained experience of social problems at home and knowledge of foreign mission work, and she learned to handle business affairs -- it was said she had the efficiency of a commercial businessman. Following the deaths of her parents she inherited a considerable fortune. Unable because of uncertain health to fulfil her dream of becoming a missionary, she devoted herself to service for others. 
The women's temperance movement was for Catherine a lifelong cause; from 1876, when the Alloa branch of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA) was formed and she, aged twenty-one, became secretary, to her death in 1914 she played an influential part, both locally and nationally. From 1906 she was president of the BWTA Scottish Christian Union. Her work for temperance was indicative of the growing independent activity by women for women in social, health, educational, and political fields. 
In Alloa, besides the usual temperance meetings -- the prayer meetings were for her the powerhouse of the work -- she organized practical courses in cookery, laundry, and nursing of the sick, soup kitchens for the unemployed, and a centre for young people; she also ran refreshment tents at the local and national agricultural shows. Through the branch she started a district nursing service, one of the earliest in Scotland, which, with its emphasis on health education, became a model. Her interest in nursing and the needs uncovered by the district nursing service led her in 1899 to build and present to the people of Clackmannanshire, at a cost of over $10,000, the well-equipped County Accidents Hospital. 
A natural affinity with young people led Catherine to help to found, about 1880, a YWCA branch, which met in her home, as did a Sunday afternoon class. Shortly before her death she planned an institute with meeting-rooms and tea-room for the benefit of the townspeople, especially the young women. Throughout her life she continued church work, becoming well known nationally as a speaker at church and temperance meetings. 
Her long-standing interest in foreign missions coincided with a growing demand for trained women for work among women abroad and at home -- piety and good intentions were no longer enough -- but there was in Scotland as yet no specific training. In 1891 she set up her own undenominational home, the Lady Missionaries' Training Home in Glasgow. Her courses were practical, equipping students with domestic, business, and nursing skills as well as biblical training and basic knowledge of the countries where they would work. The women came from Europe and America as well as from the British Isles. She knew them personally and continued to keep in touch by prodigious correspondence as well as by welcoming them to her home when they came on furlough. When the home closed, at Catherine's death, 220 women had passed through. 
Catherine's portrait suggests the strength of character and serenity, based on her strong evangelical faith, that enabled her to accomplish so much. Cultured, widely read, and musical, she was also greatly loved and gentle, while formidable in her imaginative vision and practical abilities; bequests of over $53,000, from her estate of $117,855, reveal the breadth of her interests. Though not involved in the 'women's movement' she was still a leader; unusually, at her funeral, among the cord-holders customary at a Scottish graveside were two women. She died on 8 August 1914 at Grantown-on-Spey, where she had gone to convalesce from pleurisy. She was buried beside her parents in Greenside cemetery, Alloa, on 12 August.

Abdullah ibn Hussein (1882-1951), emir of Transjordan and founder of the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan, was born in February 1882 in Mecca in the Ottoman province of Hejaz. He was the second of three sons of Hussein ibn Ali (1853-1931) and Abdiyya bint Abdullah (died 1886). His parents, who were first cousins, both held the title sherif, denoting their descent from the prophet Muhammad. Their income derived from waqfs (pious endowments in the form of property) and an allowance from the ruling grand sherif of Mecca, Abdullah's great-uncle. 
Abdullah's mother died when he was four and his paternal great-grandmother subsequently cared for him. Private tutors taught him tribal lore, poetry, history, calligraphy, and recitation of the 'Koran'. This life was disrupted in 1891 when his father was effectively exiled to Constantinople by order of the Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II, owing to a familial dispute with the grand sharif. Abdullah and his two brothers, Ali (1879-1935) and Feisal (1886-1933), joined him a few months later. Their social circle in Constantinople was confined to the Turkish elite and persons of a similar religious standing. In 1902 he married his first cousin Misbah bint Nasser, and a son and heir, Talal, was born in 1909 (died 1972). They also had a daughter, Haya. 
Abdullah's first decisive political intervention occurred in 1908 when he persuaded his father to stand for the vacant position of grand sherif of Mecca. Amid the turmoil of the Young Turk revolution, Hussein's candidature proved successful, helped by the tacit backing of Britain. Abdullah promptly returned to Mecca in December after sixteen years away. In 1909 he became a deputy for Mecca in the parliament established by the Young Turks, requiring him to return to Constantinople for the winter months. This effectively made him Hussein's go-between with the Ottoman government until the outbreak of war in 1914. He took, polygamously, a second wife, Suzdil Hanum, in 1912 and had three more children, Naif, Munira, and Maqbula. 
During the First World War Abdullah became involved in discussions with British officials over the future of Hejaz and in 1915 encouraged his father to negotiate with Britain's high commissioner to Egypt, Henry McMahon, about Arab independence from Turkish rule. Abdullah subsequently became the political driving force behind the Arab revolt and was a vigorous advocate of the British connection. The reward came in 1916 when his father was granted the title king of Hejaz. Yet it was his brother Feisal who emerged from the revolt as Britain's main Arab mediator owing to his successful military campaigns with T. E. Lawrence. Feisal acquired control over Syria but French forces, upholding the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916, expelled him in July 1920. 
This ejection provided Abdullah with an opportunity to advance his own political ambitions in northern Arabia, after he had been thwarted in the south on the battlefield against Ibn Sa'ud in May 1919. In early 1921 Abdullah entered Transjordan (then part of the Palestine mandate) with a view to marching on Damascus. At the insistence of Winston Churchill, Britain's colonial secretary, Abdullah was allowed to stay in Amman provided that he curbed anti-Zionist activities in the area and ceased his hostility to the French in Syria. Feisal, meanwhile, was offered the throne of Iraq, a lasting source of jealousy to his competitive brother. Abdullah's position in Transjordan became more secure in September 1922 when the League of Nations accepted Britain's decision to separate it from Palestine. The emirate of Transjordan formally came into being on 25 May 1923. 
Abdullah's immediate task as emir was to consolidate his rule over the native sedentary and nomadic tribes. In this nation-building process he was dependent on the armed 'reserve force' formed in 1921 by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Peake, seconded from the Palestine police. Renamed the Arab Legion in May 1923, it was led by Glubb Pasha (Sir John Glubb) between 1930 and 1956. As well as maintaining internal order, the Arab Legion -- which was trained and paid for by the British -- was responsible for protecting Transjordan's borders. The main threat came from Ibn Sa'ud, who overthrew Abdullah's father as king of Hejaz in 1924, creating in due course Saudi Arabia. This military dependence on Britain was reinforced by the appointment of a succession of political advisers, notably St John Philby between 1921 and 1924 and Alec Kirkbride from 1927. A legislative council was created in 1928 but its relations with the emir were mainly advisory and he was essentially an autocrat. 
By the end of the decade Abdullah was firmly established in Transjordan but, as a contemporary noted, this was akin to a falcon being trapped in a canary's cage. His great ambition was to rule the historic 'fertile crescent' which encompassed Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Transjordan. In pursuit of this goal he floated a variety of federation schemes with neighbouring states and keenly advocated Arab unity when it suited his purposes. Fellow Arab rulers, protective of their own positions, came to mistrust him, while Arab nationalists increasingly condemned him as a British puppet. His cultivation of contacts with Zionist leaders in Palestine, based on a pragmatic and realistic view of Jewish nationalism, also incurred their hostility. By the mid-1930s Abdullah recognized that Britain would always block his greater Syria plans and so he narrowed his immediate focus to Palestine. 
During the Second World War Abdullah proved to be Britain's most faithful ally in the Middle East. He zealously maintained internal order in Transjordan and gave full support to Britain's suppression of pro-axis nationalists in Iraq in 1941. The only friction occurred in the negotiations leading to the creation of the Arab League, Abdullah favouring a version of his fertile-crescent ambitions rather than the Egyptian-led anti-Hashemite bloc that eventually emerged in March 1945. In recognition of Abdullah's wartime loyalty Britain granted formal independence to Transjordan in March 1946 (the 'Trans' prefix was dropped in 1947), while veiling the continuing defence relationship under a treaty of alliance. Abdullah's title changed from emir to king in May 1946. The impression remained, however, that he was a British stooge. Officials in the British Foreign Office referred to him as 'Mr Bevin's little king'. 
In 1947, as Palestine descended into civil war, Abdullah intensified his contacts with Jewish leaders. The upshot was a loose -- and much debated -- understanding based on Jordan's seizing the Arab-designated parts of Palestine under the United Nations partition plan, leaving the rest for the new state of Israel. Britain's foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, encouraged this as he preferred an enlarged Jordan to a Palestinian state led by the pro-Nazi ex-mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Huseini. A few days before the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli War on 15 May 1948, however, the Arab League appointed Abdullah the commander-in-chief of its armies. It would appear that the plan was either to lock him into the official Arab policy of opposing partition or, failing that, to make him the scapegoat for the expected military defeat. 
Unhindered by his new collective responsibilities Abdullah ordered the Arab Legion to seize Palestinian territory west of the River Jordan. The armistice of 1949 left the West Bank under his control, much to the anger of other Arab governments who wanted the area to form the basis of a Palestinian state. To the Palestinian refugees Abdullah was the great betrayer of their cause. His formal annexation of the West Bank in May 1950 -- adding 900,000 Palestinians to the existing population of 450,000 -- prompted a crisis in the Arab League. A compromise agreed in June permitted Jordan to hold on to the territory until a final settlement of the Palestine question. Meanwhile Abdullah's attempts to reach a peace treaty with Israel earned him yet more vilification in the Arab world. 
On 20 July 1951, while Abdullah was attending Friday prayer at the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, a 21-year-old tailor's apprentice named Mustafa Ashu emerged from behind the entrance and shot him dead with a bullet in the head. The assassin, who was immediately killed by the royal bodyguard, allegedly had links with Hajj Amin al-Huseini. Abdullah's body was flown back to Amman that day for burial in the Royal Tombs at the Royal Court on 23 July. 
A son of the Arabian peninsula, Abdullah was an Arab traditionalist and devout Muslim all his life. He was particularly attached to the simplicity of tribal values and loved the accompanying poetry and storytelling. But he was also a product of Constantinople's 'belle epoque' with its ethnic and religious diversity, and from this he acquired a deep understanding of nationality issues. At the time of his death (and indeed for a long time afterwards) his realism and moderation towards Zionism were unique among Arab leaders. To Britain, Abdullah was the loyal client whose small but stable country was considered a strategic asset and therefore worth its stipend. Although his British advisers thought him well schooled in 'Ottoman intrigue', they nevertheless warmed to his charm and impish personality. Kirkbride, who knew him best of all, described him as the 'king with a twinkle in his eye'. While he enjoyed pomp and ceremony, his official expenses were in keeping with Jordan's size. He wrote two volumes of memoirs, 'Mudhakkarati' in 1945 and 'Al Takimilah' in 1951. From the First World War onwards his abiding concern was to create an Arab homeland based upon natural, historic frontiers rather than Anglo-French imperial constructs. The pursuit of this goal, however, brought him the enmity of neighbouring Arabs and, in the end, his death at the hands of a stateless Palestinian. Ironically his legacy was a stable and modern Hashemite dynasty over a country famously created by a stroke of Churchill's pen.

Whitelaw, Annie Watt (1875-1966), headmistress and educationist, was born on 17 August 1875 at 37 Dundas Street, Edinburgh, one of the twelve children of George Whitelaw ('c'.1837-1888), accountant and treasurer of the synod of the United Presbyterian church, and his wife, Grace Hutton ('c'.1844- 'c'.1926). Both her parents came originally from Perth, but lived in Glasgow until her father decided to emigrate to New Zealand in 1878. Annie, her mother, and two of her siblings joined him in Auckland the following February, while the rest of her family arrived shortly afterwards. A sensitive, thoughtful child with an insatiable appetite for reading, Annie Whitelaw grew up in a large family home in the Auckland suburb of Ponsonby, where she enjoyed a happy childhood, despite the premature death of her father and two sisters. After receiving her primary education at the local school, she attended the Auckland Girls' High School before transferring to Auckland Girls' Grammar School in September 1888. There she was a senior district scholar in 1890 and passed the medical preliminary before leaving to further her studies overseas in April 1893. 
A talented musician, Whitelaw initially thought of studying piano in Germany but eventually chose to study mathematics at Girton College, Cambridge, which she entered in 1894. She obtained second-class honours in part one of the mathematical tripos in 1897, and joined the staff of Wycombe Abbey School in Buckinghamshire as a mathematics teacher. There she enjoyed the companionship of several Girton friends and came under the care of the headmistress, Jane Frances Dove, who recognized her leadership qualities and made her a house tutor in 1899. Whitelaw developed a close friendship with her headmistress and the two Old Girtonians travelled to Dublin together to receive their MA degrees 'ad eundem' from Trinity College in July 1905. 
Whitelaw, or A. W. as she was known, remained at Wycombe Abbey until 1906, when she was appointed headmistress of Auckland Girls' Grammar School. A forceful, dynamic young woman with 'bright blue eyes, wavy ash-blond hair and an engaging smile' ('Tribute', 8), she returned to her old school determined to establish a routine of work and play which would equip her pupils for the 'responsible part' they were 'expected to take in the development of a great Dominion' (Auckland Girls' grammar school, 21). However, a two-year delay in completing the school's new facilities meant that she had little more than a year in which to set the changes in motion before she was called back to England. 
After returning to Wycombe Abbey as headmistress in September 1910, A. W. developed a strong relationship with her staff, who supported her 'questing spirit' as she set about shaping the school into a 'closely knit community... where talents and gifts of all kinds could find their meaning in the service of something worthwhile' ('Tribute', 24). As an 'old friend' of the school (ibid., 25), she also enjoyed the backing of its council, who financed her building projects and supported her campaign for the establishment of a school chapel. 
A deeply religious woman, who had been confirmed as an Anglican while at Wycombe, Whitelaw regarded worship 'as the most important, vital, the happiest and biggest thing in life' and became convinced that the school needed its own chapel ('Tribute', 25). An entertaining and imaginative scripture teacher, she inaugurated daily intercession services in 'Big School' during the war and launched a successful chapel appeal fund in 1921. Outside the school she took an active interest in social and religious work and encouraged her pupils to do likewise. As a result, she established a Seniors Social Service Committee and supported the London mission work of Father George Potter through her involvement with the Union of Girls' Schools for Social Service in Camberwell. During her fifteen years as headmistress, she also took a keen interest in educational developments and was the founder and first president of the Association of Head Mistresses of Boarding-Schools. 
Whitelaw resigned her post at Wycombe in 1925 to devote herself to social and religious work; she was appointed to a Colonial Office committee on native education and spent six months inspecting schools and colleges in south and central Africa in 1926. On her return to England she became the director of women's education at the Selly Oak Missionary Colleges near Birmingham and lectured there for three years before resigning and moving to London. There she was appointed warden of the Talbot Settlement, an Anglican women's mission dedicated to work in certain parishes in Camberwell, and found scope for her administrative talents; she employed her charm and charisma to fill the house with residents and raise funds to rid the settlement of its debts. 
After returning to live with her sisters in Auckland in 1938, Whitelaw renewed contact with her old school and joined the congregation of St Mark's Church, Remuera. Although she missed her friends in England, she kept herself busy by supporting the work of the New Zealand Federation of University Women as a vice-president of its Auckland branch in 1938, 1939, and 1944, while in 1941 she was a member of a commission which examined Maori educational work under the Anglican church. Between 1941 and 1945 she also served on the board of directors of the YWCA, chairing a committee which was responsible for establishing a library for service personnel. 
After making two extended visits to England in 1948 and 1953, Whitelaw settled back in Auckland and spent her last years living alone in her home, where she was cared for by her extended family and many devoted friends. After recovering from a stroke, she died at her home, 57 Arney Road, Remuera, Auckland, on 11 August 1966 from pulmonary oedema. Her funeral was held at St Mark's Church and her ashes were interred at Purewa cemetery, Meadowbank, Auckland. Memorial services were held for her in two countries -- the first attended by the staff and 1100 pupils of Auckland Girls' Grammar School at St Matthew's Church in Auckland and the second in the chapel at Wycombe Abbey, where her name lives on in the Whitelaw Memorial Library.

Anthony Culverwell (c.1559-1612) married Sybil, daughter of John Bodley (c.1520-1591), in 1582 as his first wife but was not regarded by Richard as the heir to his business interests and received only $30 in Richard's will. Following Sybil's death, some time after 1584, he married Sarah Willis, who survived him. The days of organized radical protestantism were numbered by now. The death of John Field in 1588 and the appearance of the Martin Marprelate tracts thereafter prompted the relentless campaign which amongst much else destroyed the conference movement that Field had founded and guided for twenty years. 
Their widows all long outlived the three Culverwell brothers. Alice, wife of Laurence, continued to run his business under the auspices of the Coopers and as Alice Luntley was remembered in Richard's will. Elizabeth, wife of Nicholas, died in 1589 or early in January 1590, appointing John Bodley sole executor and making bequests to Chaderton, Whitaker, and other leading Cambridge divines.

Mary Livingston (d. 1585). Contemporaries frequently commented upon the coincidence of all four girls sharing the same first name, but Alexander Jamieson, the nineteenth-century lexicographer, linked the term 'Maries' to the Icelandic word 'maer', meaning a virgin or maid. 
When Mary, queen of Scots, arrived at the French court Henri II, though delighted with her, was dismayed that she did not speak French. Believing that she would forget her own country more quickly if she were surrounded by French ladies, he sent the Maries to Poissy to be educated under the supervision of the Dominican abbess Francoise de Vieuxpont, but their separation from the queen seems to have been brief. On their return to Scotland with her in 1561 the Maries were obviously her close friends and confidantes, often sleeping in her bedchamber, as was the custom of the time. Elegant, sophisticated, and sumptuously dressed, they attracted admiring attention wherever they went. The English ambassador Thomas Randolph thought Mary Beaton the most beautiful, but Mary Fleming dazzled him at the twelfth night festivities of 1564, when she took the principal role, wearing diamonds and cloth of silver. 
In 1565 Mary, queen of Scots, said that she was marrying off her Maries and had a mind to take another husband herself. On 6 March Mary Livingston became the wife of John (died 1583), son of Robert, third Lord Sempill, the queen having provided not only the dowry and the wedding dress but a magnificent scarlet bed; on 29 July she herself married Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley (1545/6-1567). The following April the court celebrated Mary Beaton's marriage to Alexander Ogilvy of Boyne. Mary Seton showed no interest in matrimony, but the vivacious Mary Fleming had a string of suitors, and on 6 January 1568, after a long courtship, she married William Maitland of Lethington, the queen's secretary of state, a widower eighteen years older than she. 
A month later Darnley was murdered at Kirk o' Field and the queen married James, earl of Bothwell. Mary Seton was with her when she surrendered to her rebellious lords at Carberry Hill. She and Mary Livingston accompanied the queen on her ignominious return to Edinburgh and they attended her during her imprisonment in Lochleven Castle. When the queen tried to escape, disguised as a washerwoman, she gave her long black dress to Mary Seton, who put it on and prepared to impersonate her until she could get safely away. The attempt failed, but after the queen's eventual escape, defeat at Langside, and imprisonment in England, Mary Seton once more became her companion and won praise for her skill at daily devising new hairstyles for her. The other Maries remained in Scotland. 
Mary Seton had at least two suitors during her time in England. During her stay at Wingfield Manor, Sir Richard Norton's son Christopher wanted to marry her but was executed after his involvement in the northern rising. The master of the queen's household, Andrew Beaton, had also fallen in love with Mary Seton but she was reluctant, telling him that she had taken a vow of chastity; he died just as it seemed that she was changing her mind. In poor health Mary retired to Rheims in 1583 to spend the rest of her life in the abbey of St Pierre aux Dames, where the abbess, Renee de Lorraine, was an aunt of the Scottish queen. The longest lived of the four Maries, she eventually died there some time after 1615. 
Mary Livingston died in 1585, two years before Mary's execution. Her eldest son, Sir James Sempill, was James VI's ambassador to the English court. Mary Beaton lived until 1597. It has been suggested that either she, or Mary Fleming and her husband, Maitland of Lethington, may have forged the notorious casket letters, but that is pure speculation. Mary Fleming was with her husband during his long illness and when he finally died, in 1573, after the fall of Edinburgh Castle to English and Scottish forces, she successfully pleaded with William Cecil for her husband's body to be given a decent burial instead of being put on display at his trial for treason, as would otherwise have happened. A month later she was refusing to give up a diamond and ruby chain belonging to Queen Mary, which was now being claimed by the representatives of King James. She devoted herself to bringing up her son and daughter and, having outlived her husband by many years, and having at some stage married, secondly, George Meldrum of Fyvie, she died about 1600. 
The identity of the four Maries has been the subject of much confusion, thanks to a ballad entitled 'Marie Hamilton', which arguably dates from the eighteenth century. It tells the apocryphal tale of one of Queen Mary's ladies-in-waiting having an affair with Lord Darnley, drowning her illegitimate child, and going to the gallows with the poignant words: '
Yestreen the queen had four Maries 

This night she'll ha'e but three 

There was Marie Seaton and Marie Beaton 

And Marie Carmichael and me. 

' In 1802-3 Sir Walter Scott published this ballad in his 'Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border'. Realizing that there had been no such person as Marie Hamilton in Mary's retinue he believed that the tale derived from an incident related in John Knox's 'History of the Reformation', in which one of the queen's waiting women was executed for murdering her illegitimate child by the royal apothecary. C. K. Sharpe, the antiquarian who had collected the ballad and given it to Scott in the first place, more plausibly linked it with Mary Hamilton, a Scotswoman at the court of Peter the Great, who had an affair with the tsar, killed the resulting infant (and her two other illegitimate children), and was executed on 14 March 1719. 
In the nineteenth century the final section of the ballad, beginning with the famous verse quoted above, was lifted from it and published separately as 'The Four Maries'. It became very popular, and ever since then the fictitious Mary Hamilton and Mary Carmichael have displaced the real Mary Fleming and Mary Livingston in the minds of many people, despite the publication of Thomas Duncan's authoritative article in the 'Scottish Historical Review' for 1905, pointing out that the ballad has nothing to do with the historical four Maries. However even without this highly-coloured and irrelevant tale of adultery and infanticide the notion of the four small childhood companions of Scotland's tragic queen has caught the public imagination, and they are still remembered as romantic figures after more than four centuries.

MacIver, Robert Morrison (1882-1970), political theorist and sociologist, was born on 17 April 1882 at North Beach Street, Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, the third child of Donald MacIver, a successful tweed merchant and a devout member of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Christina Morrison. MacIver was schooled at the Nicholson Institute, Stornoway. His early childhood was happy, and he delighted in the outdoor life of the island, but in adolescence he concluded that he could not subscribe to his father's puritanical brand of Christianity, and began to feel oppressed by the piety of his home. His longing for escape was satisfied when, at the early age of sixteen, he won a scholarship to Edinburgh University. He took a first in classics in 1903. He then moved on to Oriel College, Oxford, where he took a first in Greats in 1907, in spite of having spent the week before his final examinations playing golf at Huntercombe. 
Although his undergraduate studies had been in classics, MacIver's real interest lay in political theory and sociology, and in 1907 he became a lecturer in political science at Aberdeen. Here he began to develop his political ideas in a series of articles and in a book, 'Community' (1917). MacIver was critical of the idealist school, which still dominated British political philosophy at this time, arguing that its exponents, in particular Bernard Bosanquet, had made dangerously inflated claims for the power of the state. He warned that the idealist state threatened to engulf other forms of human association. Instead MacIver advanced an alternative theory of the state, insisting that it was merely a subordinate organ of the wider community, and that its remit was thus strictly limited. He developed this idea of the state more fully in 'The Modern State' (1926). 
MacIver's thought was a notable contribution to the wider attack on the idealist theory of the state made around the time of the First World War. In this respect his ideas resembled those of pluralist authors such as Harold Laski and J. N. Figgis, and MacIver was sometimes wrongly bracketed with them. But whereas the pluralists disowned any idea that society had a common purpose, MacIver's theory of community emphasized its harmony and common purpose. His writings were notable for their optimistic belief in social progress and in the identity of interest between individual and society. 
In 1915 MacIver accepted a chair in political science at Toronto. He was vice chairman of the Canadian War Labour Board from 1917 until 1919. He spent the rest of his career in North America, which he greatly preferred to what he saw as the class-ridden society of Britain. Paradoxically, though, it was in Britain that his writings were most acclaimed; among British champions of his ideas were James Bryce, George Unwin, Ernest Barker, and Archbishop William Temple. 
In 1927 MacIver moved to Columbia University, where, as Lieber professor of political philosophy and sociology from 1929 until 1950, he sought to develop the teaching of sociology. He produced several more books, among them 'Society: a Textbook of Sociology' (1937), 'Leviathan and the People' (1939), and 'The Web of Government' (1947). But his writings lost their vogue after the Second World War. His interdisciplinary approach and his optimism about society seemed dated, and he felt increasingly at odds with the direction taken by academic sociology, deploring its obsession with quantitative method. His versatility meant that he was nevertheless still in great demand as the author of official reports. He published research studies on academic freedom, race relations, the United Nations, and juvenile delinquency. Between 1963 and 1966 he was successively president and chancellor of the New School for Social Research in New York. He received eight honorary degrees, and was a fellow of both the Royal Society of Canada and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a corresponding fellow of the British Academy. 
On 14 August 1911 MacIver married Ethel Marion Peterkin ('b'. 1884/5), who had been one of his students at Aberdeen. In his autobiography, 'As a Tale that is Told' (1968), he described this as a very happy union, though he also alluded to some extramarital affairs. MacIver had three children, of whom one son predeceased him. He died at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, on 15 June 1970.

Plaxton, George (1647/8-1720), Church of England clergyman and antiquary, was born in Wressel, Yorkshire, the son of William Plaxton and Beatrice, the daughter of Henry Akeroyd. Educated at Pocklington School, he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in March 1666 aged eighteen. After graduating BA he was ordained deacon on 29 May 1670. He was a protege of the Leveson-Gower family, who presented him to the living of Sheriffhales, Shropshire, in 1673 where on 29 September 1677 he married Alice Perratt. In the same year he became rector of Kinnardsey, Shropshire. He was presumably the author of 'The Loyal Speech of G. Plaxtone upon the Proclamation of King James II' (1685). He resigned the parish of Sheriffhales on his presentation by Sir William Leveson-Gower as rector of Donington, Shropshire, on 10 July 1690. 
Plaxton was a keen antiquary, as indicated by the notes he inserted into one of the Donington register books, and his name appears among the subscribers to various contemporary antiquarian works. He also participated in the growing interest in natural history, publishing 'Some natural observations made in the parishes of Kinnardsey and Donington' ('Philosophical Transactions', 25, no. 310). He and Alice had four sons and three daughters between 1678 and 1690; their births are recorded in the parish register of Donington, although all but the youngest were born at Sheriffhales. 
Plaxton resigned his Shropshire parishes on being presented by Lord Gower as rector of the valuable living of Barwick in Elmet, Yorkshire, on 16 July 1703. In contrast to his immediate predecessors, he resided at Barwick and maintained an active ministry, opening the church for weekday services and celebrating communion at least once a month. He appears to have made the acquaintance of the Yorkshire antiquary Ralph Thoresby almost immediately upon his appointment to Barwick; their surviving correspondence begins in September 1703. In Yorkshire Plaxton continued his interest in local history and exchanged documents with Thoresby. There is substantial evidence of his humorous nature: his letters to Thoresby reveal his tendency to apply nicknames to his acquaintances, while part of an amusing correspondence with a York watchmaker is preserved in the British Library (Add. MSS 4275-4276). He also wrote comic verse, of which the best-known is an electioneering squib, 'The Yorkshire Horse Racers'. 
Alice Plaxton died at some time before the death of Lord Gower in August 1709. In 1710 Plaxton appointed his son John, a graduate of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, curate of Barwick. He retired to the Leveson-Gower home at Trentham, where he served as steward to the Gower estates and acted as chaplain to his former patron's heir, John, a minor. From Trentham he wrote a letter in 1716 quoted in Boswell's 'Life of Johnson' because of its mention of Johnson's father. He retained the living of Barwick until his death in October 1720 and was buried at Trentham parish church on 7 October.

Warburton, Mabel Clarisse (1879-1961), missionary and educationist, was born on 22 June 1879 at Kings Langley, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, the second of two children of Thomas Frederick Warburton and his wife, Mabel Catherine Harries (died 1879). Her father was already deceased, and her mother did not survive the birth, so Warburton was raised by her grandmother Mrs Harries, at Bradwell House near Wolverton, Buckinghamshire. Her brother was declared insane and died at an institution. 
Mabel Warburton attended Cheltenham Ladies' College from 1895 to 1897, and was greatly inspired by its famous principal and pioneer of women's education, Dorothea Beale. Like Beale, Warburton was profoundly religious in the moderate Church of England mould. A combination of religious conviction, sense of service, and pioneering role for women's education led Warburton, who never married, to join the British Syrian Mission. At the age of twenty-two, after a period in Egypt, Warburton was appointed headmistress of the British Syrian Training College at Beirut, a position she held until the First World War broke out in 1914. 
In January 1918, after the British occupation of Jerusalem, Mabel Warburton was one of the first British women to be allowed into Palestine to engage in rescue work. In co-operation with several Anglican mission organizations Warburton founded and partly financed a high school and college for girls, the Jerusalem Girls' College, where she was principal from 1919 to 1926. The institution, which was open to both Arab and Jewish pupils, offered a liberal, English education and high academic standards, including a teacher's training course, for girls from the middle and upper class. 
The Anglican schools in Palestine were known as centres of ethnic and religious reconciliation, and the Jerusalem Girls' College stressed tolerance and peaceful co-existence between the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish pupils. The institution was a success not only academically, but also as non-nationalistic alternative in a society characterized by increasingly nationalistic antagonism. Warburton continued to support the college financially until it was forced to close down in 1948, when the British mandate came to an end. 
Mabel Warburton, who modernized the traditional missionary role, insisting on academically trained teachers as well as equal treatment of Arab and European staff members, was described by a colleague as: 'a very cheerful, extrovert woman, deeply religious, friendly to everybody, She had a fat and rather ugly fox terrier called Jim, who always accompanied her on long country walks around Jerusalem. She spoke Arabic well, and never seemed to be conscious of difference in race or national outlook. (Emery MSS, 2/4, 122)' While the Middle East and especially the Holy Land had a long tradition of educated, middle-class British women engaging in missionary and educational work, Mabel Warburton played a much more pioneering role. According to the Anglican bishop in Jerusalem, W. H. Stewart, Warburton had the qualifications, the vision, and the gifts of 'a missionary and educational statesman' ('Bible Lands', January 1962). Her talents as organizer and educationist within the Anglican church were given a wide range in the period from 1926 until the 1950s. 
From 1926 until 1935 Warburton was active in social work in St Hilda's Settlement, Bethnal Green, London, where she was 'one of the most inspiring and beloved workers' (Beauman, 91). At the same time she held the post as assistant secretary to the missionary council of the church assembly. This work was to give her a unique insight into the policy of the church as a whole -- travelling extensively in Egypt, Sudan, Uganda, Palestine, and Persia -- and also of the missionary societies whose headquarters were in London. 
In 1934 Warburton became educational adviser for the Anglican church in the Middle East, and as secretary of a new diocesan board of education she was given a key role in reviewing and planning Christian education in the Middle East. In her survey of education in Palestine, published in 1937, Warburton's vision of Christian schools was explicitly stated as: 'to implant in the pupils, the future leaders of the country, Moslem, Jew and Christian, that width of outlook, balance of mind, and sensibility to the claims of others, which will help to build up a better understanding between the peoples of the Holy Land. (Jerusalem and East Mission archives, XXXVII/5)' After the Second World War Warburton established the Ahliyyah School for Girls in Amman. However, her base continued to be the home she had built for herself in the 1920s, Welcome Cottage in Waltham Abbey, Essex, which was not only a private retreat, but open for parties from Bethnal Green. During this period Warburton was educational and political counsellor of missionary societies and overseas bishops, a role that led to much travel. In recognition of her work she was appointed MBE. She resigned the last of her church-related advisory posts in 1957. Mabel Warburton died of cancer on 16 November 1961 at the War Memorial Hospital, Waltham Abbey.

Davies, (Florence) Rose (1882-1958), political activist, was born at 43 Cardiff Street, Aberdar, Glamorgan, on 16 September 1882, the second daughter in the family of four daughters and three sons of William Henry Rees ('b'. 1857/8), tinplate assorter, and his wife, Fanny, 'nee' Berry ('b'. 1857/8). Six of the children became teachers. She became a monitor at Aberdar town national infants' school in January 1896. After four years as a pupil teacher she was appointed an assistant mistress in December 1900, and was paid $40 per annum. She became involved in Labour and feminist politics, probably through her teaching activities. Teachers in the town were heavily involved in the Independent Labour Party and the inequality in conditions between men and women raised issues of gender equality. She was a member of the party from 1906, possibly of the Women's Freedom League, and certainly of the Women's Co-operative Guild, of which she was local branch secretary from 1908 to 1920. In 1908 she was a shareholder in Keir Hardie's 'Labour Pioneer' and of the Independent Labour Party's institute in Aberdar. 
On 5 August 1908 she married Edward (Ted) Davies (1879/80-1951), an elementary school teacher and socialist activist, the son of John Davies, miner. She gave up her teaching position on her marriage, which led to increased work in politics and the promotion of social welfare. She was co-opted on to the education committee of Aberdar urban district council on 5 May 1909, and in 1915 became the first female to hold its chair. She was responsible for the paragraph on educational policy in Hardie's manifesto for the election of January 1910. 
From the evidence of his letters in her papers (1909-1915, but many undated) Rose Davies and her husband had a close relationship with Hardie. Between 1910 and 1914 she moves from being addressed as Mrs Davies to 'Dear Comrade' to 'Dear Rose'. Some of his letters are flirtatious. She attended a number of functions as his guest and they were captured by a newspaper photographer at the zoo ('Daily Mirror', 26 March 1910). Her relations with Hardie cooled somewhat in 1912-13, though this seems to have been because of pressure of work on both sides. They clearly were resumed later but she seems not to have shared his vigorous opposition to the First World War and became involved in a good deal of war work, including membership of a military tribunal and being a district representative for Glamorgan of the Women's Land Army. However, her husband travelled to Scotland for Hardie's funeral in 1915. 
Davies gave birth to five children from 1910 onwards. This meant that her political work was mainly confined to local government. In April 1919 she stood unsuccessfully for the town ward of Aberdar urban district council but was elected for the more working-class Gadlys ward the following year. She campaigned for improved maternity services in Aberdar, and in 1926 spoke in favour of a birth-control clinic, to meet the needs of local mothers, whose health was put at risk by the lack of such facilities. In the face of opposition, a clinic was not established until 1931. In March 1925 she was elected to Glamorgan county council for Aberaman -- the first female member of the council -- and soon afterwards was elected an alderman. She remained a member until her death and was its first female chairman in 1949-50. She took a particular interest in issues of education, particularly in provision for the education of the blind, deaf and dumb, and mentally handicapped children. In August 1920 she was appointed a justice of the peace. 
Davies was active in the peace movement between the wars, and an admirer of George Maitland Lloyd Davies, a prominent peace activist in Wales, who briefly (1923-4) held the University of Wales parliamentary seat. He spoke at a meeting at her home in 1923, when she was involved in the movement initiated by the women's section of the Welsh School of Social Service to launch a peace memorial from the women of Wales to the women of the United States, urging the USA to join the League of Nations. Presented in Washington in February 1924, the memorial was supported by 400,000 signatures. Marion Phillips nominated her to attend a meeting of the League of Nations in Geneva in September 1930. In the general election of 1929 she stood as Labour parliamentary candidate for Honiton in Devon. It was a hopeless prospect: Labour had never contested the seat before and she was unknown there. In a triangular contest she came third and won just 2.6 per cent of the vote. She was also a member of many committees, including Labour's standing joint committee of working women's organizations and the Board of Health Welsh consultative committee (from 1919 to 1926), and of the Welsh National Memorial Association for the cure and prevention of tuberculosis. In July 1931 she was appointed to the departmental committee of garden cities. 
Davies's regular attendance at meetings throughout south Wales, often several in one day and always through the use of public transport, became famous. Her ceaseless activity was recognized by her appointment as MBE in 1934 and CBE in 1954. Her husband, Ted, was a retired headmaster and very prominent in the Cooperative Society in the town but when he died in 1951 the local paper felt the need to identify him as the husband of Rose Davies. She died at the Royal Infirmary, Cardiff, on 6 December 1958, having collapsed a month earlier on her way to a Glamorgan county council committee meeting. Apart from her friend and colleague Elizabeth Andrews, she was the most prominent woman in the Labour Party in Wales in the first part of the twentieth century and a key representative of its claim to be the party of women.

Tennant, Winifred Margaret Coombe (1874-1956), suffragist and spiritualist medium, was born at Rodborough Lodge, Rodborough, Gloucestershire, on 1 November 1874, the only child of George Edward Pearce-Serocold (1828-1912), lieutenant in the Royal Navy and gentleman, and his second wife, Mary Clarke 'nee' Richardson of Derwen Fawr, Swansea. 
Her parents travelled widely, and from the age of four Winifred spent much of her childhood on the continent. Educated at schools in France, Switzerland, and England, from the age of sixteen she studied music in Naples, where she met her future husband Charles Coombe Tennant (1852-1928), a barrister and landowner, of Neath, Glamorgan. She married Charles on 12 December 1895 and bore four children. An intelligent, cultured, and socially aware young woman, marriage into this prominent and wealthy family greatly broadened her horizons. At the celebrated London salon of her mother-in-law, Gertrude Barbara Rich Tennant (1819-1918), she mixed with such figures as Gladstone, Ruskin, Tennyson, George Eliot, Burne Jones, and Cecil Rhodes; the explorer H. M. Stanley, who was married to Gertrude's daughter Dorothy, was her brother-in-law. She also met through her mother-in-law the leading suffragists Millicent Fawcett, Ray Strachey, and Eleanor Rathbone and began to work alongside them. 
At her home at Cadoxton Lodge, near Neath, Winifred Coombe Tennant was a leading figure in the campaign for women's suffrage in south Wales and became president of Neath Women's Suffrage Society. She played a prominent part in public life during the First World War and served as director of national service for Wales. She was at pains to stress that women claimed the vote as of right and not as a reward for their war work, although she acknowledged the role the war had played in changing attitudes to women's enfranchisement. The war dealt her a heavy blow in the loss of her nineteen-year-old son Christopher at Ypres in 1917; she reacted to his death by throwing herself into public work. 
In politics Coombe Tennant was an ardent Liberal. A member of the executive of the Welsh National Liberal Council and of the Committee for Self Government for Wales, she was a leading campaigner for Lloyd George's Coalition Liberals at the general election of 1918. In 1922 Lloyd George appointed her a delegate to the third assembly of the League of Nations held in Geneva that summer -- she was the first woman to be a member of the British delegation. At the general election of November 1922 she was one of sixteen Liberal women candidates; she stood, unsuccessfully, for the Forest of Dean division. 
Coombe Tennant's Welsh identity was very important to her and even though in late 1931, three years after her husband's death, she left her home at Cadoxton Lodge and took up permanent residence in London, she maintained close contacts with Wales, particularly in cultural matters. A well-known and prominent eisteddfodic figure, she was president of the arts and crafts section at the national eisteddfod held in Neath in 1918 and was elected to the Gorsedd of Bards in the same year. In 1931 she was elevated to the post of mistress of the robes, a position which she held until 1953. On her death, she bequeathed a fund, Cronfa Mam o Nedd, to the national eisteddfod. 
Coombe Tennant also took a great interest in the visual arts in Wales and was an important patron. As well as serving on the executive committee of Swansea Art Gallery, she built up her own private collection of contemporary European art in the inter-war years. She did much to promote Welsh painters. She was Evan Walters's chief patron, and was a source of encouragement to John Elwyn and to the Welsh-based German artist Heinz Koppel, among others. She died at her home, 18 Cottesmore Gardens, Kensington, London, on 31 August 1956. 
Winifred Coombe Tennant lived a public life of service and devotion to good causes and the arts. Only after her death was it revealed, in the journal of the Society for Psychical Research for December 1957, that she had been a long-standing member of the society and a psychic medium who worked under the pseudonym Mrs Willett. She had maintained this secret existence for over fifty years, concealing it even from her own family. Her membership of the society dated from 1901, and by 1908 she was acting as a medium. The death of her eighteen-month-old daughter in July 1908 probably intensified her interest in this field, as did the loss of her eldest son in 1917. A practitioner of 'automatic' handwriting, through whom the dead were claimed to communicate, she wrote down 'automatically' a series of messages attributed to deceased members of the society, including Frederic Myers (to whom she was related by marriage), Edmund Gurney, and Henry Sidgwick. Her mediumship was highly regarded within spiritualist circles, attracting the attention of Gerald Balfour among others. After Coombe Tennant's death forty scripts, said to be communications of her experiences in the afterlife, were transmitted into 'automatic' writing by the medium Geraldine Cummins.

Bradley, Caroline Frances (1946-1983), showjumper, was born on 4 April 1946 at North Oxford Nursing Home, 165 Banbury Road, Oxford, the younger daughter of John Thomas (Tom) Bradley, chartered surveyor and land agent, and (Frances) Doreen Good. She and her older sister, Judith, learned to ride at an early age and owned a succession of ponies. When she was six Caroline became a member of the Oakley pony club and later the Grafton Hunt pony club, progressing from basic riding skills and stable management to junior showjumping competitions. By the time she was fifteen she had graduated to horses and was exhibiting the determination and will to win that were a hallmark of her life. She was also a talented hockey player, representing her county during her years at Northampton High School for Girls, but she gave up the sport to concentrate on showjumping. 
Bradley's next major decision was whether to continue her academic studies or to pursue a riding career. After completing her A levels her parents agreed that she could have two years to develop her equestrian skills and she undertook eighteen months as a working pupil at the Waterstock House Training Centre, Oxfordshire, run by Lars Sederholm. It was here that she gained a grounding in the essential riding techniques that later made her one of the most technically correct riders in the sport. She then began to compete on the British grade A showjumping circuit and made her international debut at the Dublin horse show in 1966 riding Robert Hanson's Franco, the horse on which she achieved much of her early success. They were part of the victorious British team at the nations' cup in Leipzig the following year and by the time she won the civilian open championship at Toronto in 1968 she was being hailed in the press as the natural successor to Pat Smythe, Britain's most famous female showjumper. Demonstrating great versatility, she also competed in the Badminton horse trials in 1969 on Alpaca, a horse belonging to Lars Sederholm, her former trainer. 
The life of an international showjumper in the late 1960s was not easy for a young woman in a sport dominated largely by men. Like all riders, Bradley took many crunching falls, suffering concussion and numerous broken bones. Her confidence in the ring belied her natural shyness and she found it difficult to deal with the publicity that accompanied success. In order to make ends meet she had to teach, take liveries, and train young horses for other people; she even took part in a television commercial for margarine to augment her income. She always drove her own horsebox around the country, clocking up thousands of miles at the wheel, as she never trusted others to take care of her precious horses. She also had to endure the disappointments of being omitted from the 1972 Olympic team and subsequently finding herself ineligible for Olympic competition because she rode horses belonging to others: in the eyes of the authorities this made her professional. 
Undaunted, Bradley continued to ride during the next decade, becoming the first female winner of the puissance at the horse of the year show in 1974 and the only woman to compete in the newly amalgamated men's and women's world championships at Aachen in 1978, at which she helped the British team to win a gold medal. She won team gold again the following year at the European championships in Rotterdam and, overall, represented Britain on twelve winning nations' cup teams in a seventeen-year international career. As an individual she won the grand prix at Hickstead in 1980 and the Queen Elizabeth II cup -- the UK women's showjumping championship -- on her two most famous horses, John Harding's stallion Marius in 1978 and the grey gelding Tigre in 1980. She also found time to support charities such as Riding for the Disabled. At the height of her success she was elected 'Daily Express' sportswoman of the year in 1979, alongside sportsman Sebastian Coe, and was made an MBE in 1980. To many young girl riders she was a sporting heroine. 
Showjumping, however, is a partnership and a rider's success is ultimately dependent on her horses. Bradley's last year in the top flight was 1980. With Marius retired from the jumping arena, she was dealt a severe blow when Donald Bannocks, co-owner of Tigre, decided unexpectedly to sell him. Initially it appeared that she would continue to ride the horse but when she signed a sponsorship deal with oil company Tricentrol he was removed from her stables, leaving her without any top-class rides. Always a professional and dedicated horsewoman, she began to work even longer hours to bring on her string of youngsters (who included the future champion Milton), regularly taking nine horses to shows. Her fellow showjumper David Broome recalled that she drove herself unbelievably hard. According to her biographer her determination to reach the top again and her sense of responsibility towards her sponsors changed her from a hard worker to a workaholic. 
On 1 June 1983 Bradley was competing in the Suffolk show at Ipswich when she became unwell after jumping a round. She collapsed and died shortly afterwards. A coroner's inquest concluded that she had suffered heart failure, brought on by cardiac arrhythmia or acute acceleration of the heart rate. She was thirty-seven and unmarried. In the opinion of Dorian Williams, the well-respected BBC commentator, she was perhaps the most skilled woman rider in the world.

Baldwin, John (d. 1615), music copyist and composer, is of unknown origins and parentage. According to Ernest Brennecke, Baldwin was admitted a lay clerk of St George's Chapel, Windsor, in 1575; he cites no documentary evidence in support of this claim and none exists today, though subsequent repair work on the Windsor records may have obscured it. Baldwin is first mentioned there in 1586-7, when he received his stipendiary $10 p.a. plus 22's'. livery money. He supplemented this income by acting as the chapel's music copyist, and additional payments of 20's'. were made to him 'pro scriptione sacrarum Cantionum' ('for the copying of sacred songs', that is, services and anthems for the chapel liturgy) in every year for which accounts survive. On 3 February 1594 the lord chamberlain commanded the subdean of the Chapel Royal 'that John Bauldwyne of the College of Wynsor shoulde be placed next in ordynarye in Her Majesties Chapple', and on 23 March 1595 it was ordered that Baldwin be sworn 'gentleman in ordinarie (without pay)... until a tenor's place be voyde, and then he to have and be sworne into wages for the firste and nexte tenor that shalbe admitted' (Rimbault, 35-6). On 28 March 1596 Baldwin witnessed a promise of good behaviour by another of the Windsor clerks. He finally gained his Chapel Royal position on 20 August 1598, following the death of Robert Tallentire. Baldwin sang at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, the coronation of James I, and the funeral of Prince Henry. On 9 September 1613 he married Elizabeth Jonson in the church of St George the Martyr, Southwark. 
Baldwin is one of the most important and versatile of late Elizabethan music scribes. He was wholly responsible for at least three collections: Oxford, Christ Church, MSS 979-983, a set of partbooks probably started in the late 1570s which contains over 170 pieces, most of them vocal and sacred; his so-called commonplace book (BL, RM 24.d.2), compiled over a period of roughly twenty-five years from 'c'.1581 to 'c'.1606; and 'My Ladye Nevells Booke', an important source of William Byrd's keyboard music, which was finished on 11 September 1591 and is now in the possession of the marquess of Abergavenny. Baldwin also repaired and completed the Forrest-Heyther collection of masses (Bodl. Oxf., MSS mus. sch. e.376-381), which passed into his hands about 1581. In addition he copied two pieces into Robert Dow's partbooks (Oxford, Christ Church, MSS 984-988) at the instigation of their then owner, Giles Thompson, who was dean of Windsor from 1603. Baldwin's work is always elegant and usually accurate, though he was occasionally guilty of modernizing the Latin sacred music of earlier generations by filling out its melismatic passages with additional text underlay. 
Baldwin's commonplace book includes eighteen of his own compositions, the best-known being his setting of Nicholas Breton's 'In the merry month of May', which was probably sung before Queen Elizabeth at Elvetham House, Hampshire, on 22 September 1591. According to a contemporary account: 'three excellent Musicians... disguised in auncient countrey attire, did greet her with a pleasant song of Coridon and Phyllida, made in three parts of purpose. The song, as well for the worth of the dittie, as for the aptnes of the note thereto applied, it pleaseth her Highnesse, after it had been once sung, to command it againe, and highly to grace it with her chearefull acceptance and commendation. (Nichols, 3.116)' Many of Baldwin's textless compositions appear to have had a didactic purpose and incorporate complex proportional changes and contrapuntal devices, as in his 'upon the plainesong' and 'In nomine' in five parts. There are also two four-part motets, 'Redime me' and 'Pater noster', in Christ Church, MSS 979-983. 
Baldwin died in Southwark on 28 August 1615, possibly of plague, and was buried the following day in the parish of St George the Martyr. Letters of administration were granted to his wife on 7 September. Their son was born some three months later and was baptized John on 1 December.

Dow, Robert (1553-1588), music copyist, was the eldest of five sons born to Lettice Bull and Robert Dow (1523-1612), citizen and merchant taylor of London. His father was collector of tonnage and poundage for the port of London. He may have attended Merchant Taylors' School before going up to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was admitted BA on 14 January 1574, having supplicated for the degree on 12 October 1573. Although his name does not appear in the Corpus registers, Dow wrote Lord Burghley three Latin letters in 1573, 'Oxoniae in Collegio Corporis Christi'. This correspondence sought to secure royal support for Dow's efforts to gain admittance to All Souls College as a student of civil law, but while this was not immediately forthcoming, he was eventually elected to a probationary fellowship there on 28 November 1575. At this time he was giving lessons in penmanship, and could count Robert Sidney among his pupils. 
On 14 January 1577 Dow was admitted to All Souls as BA and student in laws. He supplicated for the degree of BCL on 29 March 1582 and was admitted on 26 April following. From 1585 to 1587 he was bursar of laws at All Souls, and in the latter year he contributed to 'Exequiae Illustrissimi equitis', a collection of verse in memory of Sir Philip Sidney; his elegy reveals that Dow had travelled to Poland and met King Stephen Bathory. Dow died intestate on 10 November 1588, presumably at All Souls. The inventory of his goods included a library of over 300 volumes, among them a set of music partbooks in his own fine italic hand which survives today as Oxford, Christ Church, MSS 984-988. It contains instrumental pieces, songs, anthems, and motets, some of which bear annotations in Latin about their composers. Dated 1581, it is one of the most important sources of Elizabethan music, even if in the vocal pieces the scribe occasionally modernizes the composer's setting by altering notes and text underlay. Dow's music manuscripts are the major source of the compositions of Robert White. The content of his library may suggest recusant sympathies.

Gerarde, Derrick (fl. 1550-1590), composer and copyist, was probably of Flemish origin. Although virtually nothing is known of his life, there is strong circumstantial evidence for believing that he spent some time in England. Almost his entire musical output is contained in manuscripts now in the Royal Appendix sequence of the British Library. The fact that so many of these can be traced back to the library established by Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel (1512-1580), and his son-in-law John, Lord Lumley (1534-1609), suggests that Gerarde had personal contact with their household. Both men were sympathetic patrons of the arts, and their country residence at Nonsuch, Surrey, was a flourishing centre of continental music and culture. Two sets of partbooks emanating from Nonsuch contain a work with English text -- 'Yf Phebus Stormes' and 'Lorde be my judge' -- apparently by Gerarde. He copied Royal Appendix 57 (the only surviving partbook of another Nonsuch set) using printed music paper thought to have been produced in England in the 1560s. A textless chanson or instrumental piece, 'Chera la fountayne', is attributed to 'Gerardus' in British Library, Add. MS 31390, a manuscript of English provenance, and his motet 'Sive vigilem' appears in Oxford, Christ Church, MSS 979-983, a collection that, with one exception, contains music by British composers or foreigners working in Britain. However, there is no documentary proof that Gerarde ever directly enjoyed the patronage of either Arundel or Lumley, and it has even been suggested that they acquired some of his manuscripts secondhand. While admitting this as a possibility, it seems more likely that he was employed at Nonsuch in some capacity. 
Gerarde's manuscripts constitute one of the largest collections of polyphony by a single composer to have survived from the Elizabethan era. A number of these are autographs and preserve reworkings of his pieces, often in the form of new staves pasted over the old versions, which afford a fascinating insight into the compositional processes of a Renaissance musician. His large and varied output is international in scope, with instrumental pieces, Italian madrigals and villanellas, chansons, liturgical pieces for four to ten voices, and a number of secular motets. His finely crafted music is typical of the generation of Lassus, with smoothly flowing lines and declamatory passages occasionally enlivened by touches of chromaticism. The style is seen at its best in his 'Dulces exuviae', a setting of Dido's final words from book 4 of Virgil's 'Aeneid', which achieves a remarkably powerful effect for all its technical restraint. 
Nothing is known of Gerarde's career before coming to England, and attempts to identify him with one of the many musicians of that name working on the continent have produced only speculative results. He may have arrived in England as early as the reign of Queen Mary, when Arundel was in the Low Countries as ambassador to Philip of Spain, or in the mid-1560s as a musician acquired by the earl on his visit to the baths at Padua. After Arundel's death Gerarde may have sought alternative employment, and he is possibly the 'Gerrard Direck' alias 'Direck Gerrerd' who was a singing man at York Minster from about 1590 until his death in 1604. Conceivably, he may also be the 'Derrick' whose English service music appears in early seventeenth-century manuscripts at Cambridge and Durham, and the composer of 'Mr Dethicks Pavin' in British Library, Add. MSS 30826-30828, another Cambridge source.

Pygott, Richard (d. 1549), composer and church musician, is of unknown parentage and background. He spent more than thirty years in two of the foremost choral foundations of early Tudor England, first as master of Cardinal Wolsey's household chapel choir and later as a gentleman of Henry VIII's royal household chapel. He was in Wolsey's employment by January 1517, when a royal pardon for unauthorized possession of a crossbow and handgun describes him as a servant of the cardinal of York living in Westminster. His position in the household is not specified; presumably he was either a singer in the choir or already its director; an inventory of Wolsey's goods compiled during the 1520s mentions 'a fedderbedde bought for Pygoote maister of the children' in December 1517. Wolsey's choir so prospered under Pygott's direction that it aroused the king's envy. In March 1518 Henry's secretary Richard Pace wrote requisitioning one of Wolsey's choristers on the grounds that the cardinal's choir was better than the king's. Shortly afterwards Pace thanked Wolsey for the chorister and remarked that 'Cornyshe [the master of the king's chapel] doies gretly laude & prayse the chylde... and doies in lyke maner extolle mr pygote for the techynge of hym' (TNA: PRO, SP 1/16, fol. 206'v'). Pygott continued to direct the choir until it was disbanded on Wolsey's death in 1530; he and the singers accompanied their master on embassies to France in 1521 and 1527, and must also have been among his retinue at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. 
Pygott's work with Wolsey's choir must have recommended him to the king; after the cardinal's demise he seems quickly to have found employment as a gentleman or singer in the royal household chapel. He first appears in this guise in an undated wages list assignable to about 1533-4, but he may have been appointed earlier: in October 1532 he received a corrody in Coggeshall Priory surrendered by another gentleman, and in April 1533 he obtained a canonry in the collegiate church of St Editha at Tamworth, whose prebends were habitually awarded to members of the king's chapel. Other grants during the 1530s and 1540s show that he continued to enjoy royal favour. 
By 1545 Pygott may have been contemplating retirement: in November the cathedral authorities at Wells were instructed to allow him to reside upon his prebend there, and in the lay subsidy roll of April 1546 the $40 on which he was assessed is for the first time described as 'lands' rather than 'fee'. He seems, however, to have carried on living in London. His very informative will, dated 24 August 1549, details money gifts amounting to more than $120 (including a legacy of $2 to Thomas Tallis) and bequests of horses, clothes, and jewels. On 2 October he added a codicil mentioning 'the time of my sickness', and by 12 November, when the will was proved, he had died; payments to him from the court of augmentations ceased after November 1549. Thus he cannot be the Richard Pigot or Pigott to whom Princess Elizabeth made payments in December 1551 and January 1552. 
Pygott's few extant compositions, most of which lack one or more voice parts, are polished, imaginative, and virtuosic enough to test even the first-rate choirs with which he worked. They include a 'Missa veni sancte spiritus' for Whitsunday (one of the chief days in the royal court's liturgical calendar) and a huge and very elaborate setting of 'Salve regina' (a Marian motive antiphon, used particularly during Lent). Single voices of several other works remain, among them an antiphon 'Gaude pastore' to St Thomas of Canterbury, probably intended as a compliment to Wolsey. The only composition to survive complete is a devotional partsong 'Quid petis O fili', which continues a tradition established during Henry VII's reign. In 'A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke' (1597) Thomas Morley lists Pygott among the 'practicioners' consulted, and prints an extract from an unidentified composition by him.

Tucke, John (b. c.1482, d. in or after 1540), schoolmaster and musician, was born probably in Burford, Oxfordshire. He was admitted as a scholar to Winchester College in 1495 and took the oath on 7 August 1497. His education continued at New College, Oxford, which he entered as probationary fellow on 20 March 1501; he gained full fellowship on 24 March 1502, and was paid 12died in 1505-6 'for writing out and notating a mass' (New College, Oxford, bursars' rolls, 1505-6, 'custus capelle'). About Easter 1504 Tucke was admitted to the degree of BA. Thereafter he began studies for the master's degree, but although he supplicated successfully for his MA on 30 March 1507, he appears never to have incepted, instead resigning his fellowship before June of that year to take up a teaching post (in either music or grammar) at Higham Ferrers College, Northamptonshire, where Archbishop Henry Chichele's 1422 statutes provided for a choir of eight chaplains, four clerks, and six choristers. 
On 16 April 1515 Tucke was appointed lay master of grammar, master of the boys of the lady chapel, and organist at the Benedictine abbey of St Peter, Gloucester. His duties included teaching grammar to some of the junior monks and to thirteen boys; he was also to teach plainsong, polyphony ('cantus divisus' or 'fractus'), and descant to five or six boys, and to participate as either singer or organist at high mass and both vespers on feast days. He remained until the dissolution and surrender of the abbey to the crown in 1540, and his services as 'master of the children' were subsequently retained by the king's commissioners during the interim before the secular foundation of Gloucester Cathedral, of which it is possible that he became the inaugural organist and master of the choristers. 
Tucke was married, perhaps twice. Anne, who may have been his second wife, was cited in various property leases in Gloucester, along with a daughter, Joan, and a son, John. His exact date of death is not known; it is likely that he died in Gloucester and was buried within the cathedral precincts. 
Tucke's contribution to the history of music rests largely on the survival of his notebook (BL, Add. MS 10336), which contains important though often enigmatic theoretical material relating to the notation of early Tudor polyphonic music. The notebook was compiled, mostly in his own hand, over a long period, from his student days at Winchester through to his last years at Gloucester. Part of its contents transmits a number of traditional theoretical texts, including an abbreviated version of the 'Libellus cantus mensurabilis' attributed to Johannes de Muris, a treatise on musical proportion by John Otteby (Hothby), and notes on Boethian number theory. Much more interesting, however, are the texts (some in English) relating to polyphonic composition, which discuss the notation of rhythmic proportion through complex coloration schemes (blue, green, and yellow in addition to the usual red) and use rare Latin terminology that tries to articulate the manipulation of musical material during the compositional process. Although no compositions by Tucke himself have survived, the practical relevance of this sometimes recondite theoretical work can be traced in the repertories of some of his most notable contemporaries, such as Fayrfax, Taverner, and Ashwell; and even if certain elements of these texts cannot be claimed as wholly original, Tucke's notebook nevertheless remains the fullest exposition of polyphonic music theory surviving in Britain between the 1460s and 1580s. Substantial portions of Tucke's work were further copied and slightly recast by William Chelle of Hereford, apparently directly from Add. 10336, indicating a personal acquaintance with Tucke, presumably during their time in the west country.

Westcote, Sebastian (c.1515-1582), musician and theatrical entrepreneur, was born at Chulmleigh in Devon, the son of Joan Westcote, Westcote being a common local name. No record survives of his education, musical training, and early employment; however, close by lay the important collegiate church and choral foundation of Crediton, and his having been educated in that town might explain his generous conferment of relief upon its poor by his will. As a Catholic layman he cannot be equated with the man of this name who was a stipendiary priest of Chulmleigh about 1541, and it appears most unlikely that he can be identified with the Sebastian Westcote who occurs in 1545 among Henry VIII's yeomen of the chamber. 
Although still not employed at St Paul's Cathedral, London, in November 1541, Westcote had been engaged as one of the six lay vicars-choral (singing-men) of its choir for a period sufficiently long by 7 October 1547 not only to be named as legatee and sole executor of his eminent colleague John Redford, but to be appointed to succeed Redford (certainly by Christmas 1548) as master of the choristers and almoner. He is likely to have been at least thirty to be considered for such an important post. His duties were to attend daily in the cathedral, directing the eighteen men and ten chorister boys of the choir in executing the music of the services; the training of the boys was his special obligation. Until May 1549, and again from December 1553 until June 1559, the services sung each day were the ten principal observances of the Latin, Catholic rite of Salisbury (Sarum) use; from 1549 to 1553, and after June 1559, these were replaced by the three daily services ordered by the vernacular 'Book of Common Prayer'. Scarcely any appointment in church music outside the Chapel Royal carried greater responsibility, especially in respect of the occasional services of national thanksgiving, celebration, or penitence that were conducted at St Paul's by royal command. 
Almost immediately Westcote embarked on supplementary enterprises of his own. The abolition of obits in 1548 and the imposition of a much attenuated liturgy in 1549 simultaneously reduced the choristers' sources of income and visited upon them unwonted volumes of spare time. By nature impresario as well as entrepreneur, Westcote addressed both problems by engaging for profit the boys' natural capacities as performers. As singers and instrumentalists he made them available to entertain livery companies such as the Merchant Taylors at their major feasts and gentlemen such as Sir William Petre at their London homes. More significantly, Westcote revived John Redford's capacity for employing the boys' abilities as actors, and in the festive season of Christmas 1551, with his colleague John Heywood (minor canon of St Paul's, 'c'.1530- 'c'.1572), he mounted a play before Princess Elizabeth at her residence of Hatfield House. 
So began a long-lived and fruitful connection. Even though the restoration both of the lost revenues and of the Catholic service in December 1553 effectively prescribed an end to such extra-curricular activities, Westcote was still able to take the boys on a return visit to Hatfield in April 1557 to entertain the princess with a play; and in August 1559 Elizabeth, now queen, inspired the earl of Arundel to invite the choristers, under Westcote and Heywood, to present a play before her at Nonsuch Palace. Thus established as particular favourites of the queen, and expedited by the cathedral's return in 1559 to the attenuated vernacular service, Westcote and the 'Children of Paul's' were invited to court to entertain Elizabeth with a play at Christmas 1560 and regularly thenceforth, twice or (after 1570) once in each winter festive season right through until Westcote's death in 1582. Although not the only troupe of amateur boy actors so favoured, Paul's boys were by far the most frequent invitees, and between August 1559 and December 1581 mounted at court not fewer than twenty-eight productions. So elevated and so constant a degree of royal favour probably rendered Westcote the leading producer and arbiter of taste in English drama between 1560 and the later 1570s. 
Before their presentation at court the plays were rehearsed in the hall of the lodging of the boys and their master; this lay in St Paul's Churchyard adjacent to the cathedral nave's south aisle. At some stage, and for a charge, Westcote began to admit members of the public to watch the final rehearsals; by December 1575 this was becoming a regular business, and the city authorities resolved to invite the chapter in effect to bring Westcote's unregulated enterprise to an end. It appears that the canons ignored the city, and that each year thereafter Westcote presented on his home premises a brief winter season of perhaps one or two plays for public enjoyment; moreover, his testamentary bequests indicate that by 1582 his household was being augmented by five commensals, possibly all former choristers now briefly retained to amplify the amateur acting troupe of ten cathedral boys. 
To inaugurate England's earliest semi-permanent indoor theatre constituted Westcote's greatest innovative enterprise. Of his dramatic presentations the titles of eleven are now known, though the texts of only two or three; not known is the number (if any) that were of his own authorship. It has been inferred that his tastes were broad, encompassing old-fashioned interludes as well as modern plays; they extended to moralities, Roman history, tragedies from Greek mythology, and some comedies, all probably well laced with the vocal and instrumental music which was the boys' speciality. Not only broad-minded in his patronage of playwrights, Westcote's creation of a fashionable indoor theatre did much to channel a middle-class public eager to be associated with courtly values towards an enthusiasm for drama. Indeed, it is as inadvertently a seminal figure in the London commercial theatre which within a generation was to produce Marlowe and Shakespeare that Westcote is now most remembered. 
Westcote was overtly Catholic, and it was not until 1554, under a Marian chapter, that he was formally appointed master of the choristers at St Paul's. His adherence became evident at Bishop Grindal's visitation of 1561; he declined the protestant communion and refused to subscribe to the royal supremacy, and consequently was ejected from his ecclesiastical benefice of vicar-choral in 1564. Nevertheless, he was well known to enjoy the queen's favour, and, especially following intervention on her behalf through the earl of Leicester, despite his refusal to subscribe to the thirty-eight articles of religion (as they were between 1563 and 1571), he was left in full enjoyment of his lay appointment as master of the choristers. In 1574, while certain of his friends laboured under suspicion of treason, Elizabeth found it politic to decline to receive the play prepared for Shrovetide, and for eleven weeks at the start of 1578 he was even imprisoned 'for papistry'; however, the queen's favour protected him from inconveniences any more serious than these. More routinely, in 1571 he is found in York recruiting singing-boys for the choir, and at Christ's Hospital, London, in 1580. Irrespective of his purely seasonal theatrical sidelines, day-to-day responsibility for the cathedral's music remained his primary professional concern. Though evidently accomplished, his choristers were never more than intermittent actors, and never did they become transformed from a professional liturgical ensemble to a professional 'theatre company'. 
Westcote was particularly eminent as a pedagogue to young musicians. Among his choristers were the future composers Nicholas Carleton, Robert Knight, Thomas Wilkinson, and William Fox, and the hugely accomplished Thomas Morley and Peter Phillips; greatest of all was William Byrd, whose two elder brothers Simon and John were also Westcote's boys. Many of these learned from him not only music, but also, as Grindal feared, Catholic sympathies and belief. Towards the end of his life, however, he taught by deputy, and it was not Westcote but his assistant John Bold (Bolt) whom Morley later remembered with respect as his principal teacher. 
Already styled 'gentleman' in 1554, Westcote died sufficiently wealthy to make bequests which exceeded $240 in cash and included much domestic property, some silver and rings, and a valuable chapter lease with stock, goods, and chattels. His bequests to the choristers' house included his chest of violins and viols 'to exercise and learn the children and choristers there'. 'Grieved with sickness', he made his will on 3 April 1582; death was imminent, since probate was granted on 14 April, and his successor was in office by 17 May 1582.

Campion, Mary Anne (c.1687-1706), singer and dancer, was born of lowly parents, her father having possibly been a servant of William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire. She displayed a precocious talent on the stage; aged eleven, she was a member of Christopher Rich's company and sang at a performance of 'Phaeton' in March 1698. She sang at Drury Lane over the following seasons; in May 1699 she spoke the epilogue to the second part of 'The Famous History of the Rise and Fall of Massaniello' and danced an entry, with Weaver and Cottin, in 'The Pilgrim' on 6 July 1700. At her benefit at Drury Lane on 22 June 1703 she exhibited her range of talent, performing a duet with bass Richard Leveridge in 'a mad song' by Henry Purcell, and other songs by John Weldon; dancing with De Ruel; and accompanying Visconti on the harpsichord in a performance of 'Love's Contrivance', presented for the entertainment of the king of Denmark's envoy ('Daily Courant', 22 June 1703). She was fluent in Italian. She occasionally performed at York Buildings, and she commanded good fees; in 1702 she was paid the considerable sum of $3 4's'. 6died for performing Weldon's prize music composed to accompany Congreve's 'The Judgment of Paris' at Lincoln's Inn Fields for the duke of Bedford. In July of that year another benefit for her was advertised at Drury Lane, in ''Oronoko'... with several dances by Mrs Campion and others'. 
Campion's last public stage performance was probably on 14 March 1704, after which she retired at the behest of William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire, whose fancy she had attracted. Installed in Bolton Street, Westminster, she and the duke, then in his sixties and already provided with a wife, sundry other mistresses, and their offspring, enjoyed a fecund relationship that brought them a daughter known as Mary Anne Cavendish. In early 1706 Campion contracted a severe fever, and she died on 19 May 1706. Devonshire buried her in his family church at Latimer, Buckinghamshire, where he set up a lavish tomb of freestone, black marble, and alabaster, celebrating at length her beauty and virtue. In her will, drawn up on 23 April, she left her house and all her valuables to create an income for her daughter when she reached twenty-one. The duke died in London on 18 August 1707, 'afflicted with dropsy, gout, the stone and repentence' (Highfill, Burnim & Langhans, 'BDA', 32), but the probable falsity of this repentance occupied the first section of the scurrilous tract by John Dunton 'The Hazard of a Death Bed Repentance' (1708): 'Had the Duke aggravated his lewdness with Miss Heneage, Miss Campion, etc., but more especially had he lamented having a bastard child when he had one foot in the grave... [a reference to Campion's unfortunate offspring] he should have detected and lamented his mean adultery of tempting an actress out of the Playhouse (I mean Mrs Anne Campion) and doating on her to that degree, as to erect a tomb to her memory in Latimer's Chancel, he disgraced himself by ordering a Latin epitaph to be set on the tomb of one of his concubines... erected a tomb to perpetuate the memory of a lewd strumpet. (Dunton, 24-5)'

Clendining, Elizabeth (bap. 1767, d. 1799), singer, was baptized at St Peter's, Stourton, Wiltshire, on 13 January 1767, the daughter of John Arnold ('bap'. 1746, died 1774/5) and his wife, Mary (died in or after 1785). Her father had been educated as a boy chorister at Salisbury Cathedral and became a vicar-choral at Wells Cathedral in 1768. He was a soloist in Thomas Linley's concerts at Bath, where he was praised by the castrato Ferdinando Tenducci. The family moved to Dublin in 1773 when Arnold became a leading cathedral singer there, but he died less than two years later. 
Elizabeth Arnold remained in Dublin with her mother and in 1785 performed as the second chief vocalist at the Rotunda summer concerts, receiving 60 guineas. That year she married William Clendining (died 1793), an Irish surgeon with landed property in co. Longford, and she then retired from public performance for six years. Her husband's 'professional inattention' and ''indiscriminate' hospitality' (Haslewood, 2.379) led to his imprisonment in Dublin for debt, and in December 1791 Mrs Clendining went to London with her young family in an attempt to earn money as a professional singer. Despite the help and hospitality of the soprano Elizabeth Billington, whom she had met in Dublin, she failed to obtain singing engagements. She went to Bath, and there the flautist Andrew Ashe, a fellow performer at the Dublin Rotunda, introduced her to the castrato Venanzio Rauzzini, who had become an admired singing teacher and was in charge of the concerts there. After lessons from him, she appeared first at Ashe's benefit concert, and then in Rauzzini's 1792 passion week oratorios. The noblemen and gentlemen of the Bath Catch Club engaged her for their concerts and were the patrons of her benefit on 2 May 1792, at which she raised enough money to release her husband from debtors' prison. Clendining became surgeon of the frigate 'Inconstant' but died at Portsmouth on 27 April 1793. 
Mrs Clendining made her first stage appearance at Covent Garden on 3 November 1792, when she played Clara in 'Hartford Bridge', a part specially composed for her by William Shield. Her first song was encored, and 'the depth and fullness of her middle and lower tones, and the sweetness of the upper ones were acknowledged and admired' (Haslewood, 2.384). Mrs Clendining sang at Covent Garden for six seasons in English operas, musical afterpieces, and pantomimes. The author of 'Candid and Impartial Strictures' summed her up as 'A sweet singer with a tolerable person, and pleasing countenance', but added, 'The least we say of her acting the better' (p. 65). On 2 January 1795 she could not appear because she had dislocated her shoulder and collar-bone, but she was performing again before the end of the month. Michael Kelly, who heard her at the Plymouth theatre in summer 1796, noted that she 'had a very good voice, and was a favourite with the town, in spite of a most implacable Irish brogue' (Kelly, 2.123). In summer 1797 she sang with success in Dublin opposite the tenor Charles Incledon. She returned to London that autumn for what proved her final Covent Garden season. Her health was declining, and she made her last appearance at her benefit on 24 May 1798, when her daughter played Little Bob in the afterpiece 'The Poor Sailor' by John Bernard and Thomas Attwood. Mrs Clendining was engaged at the Edinburgh theatre for winter 1798-9, but illness often prevented her appearing. A charitable gentleman, previously unknown to her, 'hearing of her distressed situation, administered every sort of sustenance and medical assistance to her during her illness, and she was buried very decently at his expense' ('Monthly Mirror', 120). She died in Edinburgh on 16 July 1799, and her benefactor is reported to have provided for her two children.

Hodgson, Mary (bap. 1673?, d. 1719?), singer, was most probably the daughter of the dancing-master Benjamin Dyer and his wife, Mary, baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, London, on 26 December 1673. As Mrs Dyer she performed in Henry Purcell's opera 'The Fairy Queen' at Dorset Garden Theatre in May 1692, when she sang the role of Mystery and the song 'If love's a sweet passion'. On 16 May 1692, two weeks after the premiere, Mary Dyer married the actor John Hodgson or Hudson ('fl'. 1689-1721) at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. From song headings and play texts we know that she sang Purcell's music in the revival of the opera 'Dioclesian' in 1693 and at least five plays, as well as incidental songs by John Eccles. She remained a singer in the United Theatre Company in London until December 1694, when she and her husband joined Thomas Betterton's breakaway group at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. There Eccles and Gottfried Finger were the house composers, and she sang in numerous plays and in the musical entertainment 'The Loves of Mars and Venus' (November 1696). William Congreve praised her performance as Juno in the setting by Eccles of his 'The Judgment of Paris' (1701). Mrs Hodgson was also a leading singer in concerts at York Buildings in the early 1700s and sang at court in performances for royal birthdays in 1697, 1704, and 1706. John Hodgson was sued for debt three times in the early 1690s, and in June 1699, when bailiffs trying to arrest him at the playhouse were beaten off by the players, his servant was 'cowardly run through the back by a baylif, and immediately dyed, having nothing but a stick in his hand' (Luttrell, 529). John Hodgson appears to have left the stage in 1701, but his wife remained a leading singer until shortly after the company's move to the Queen's Theatre in 1706. The mistaken statement that she was an oboist (Highfill, Burnim & Langhans, 'BDA') seems to arise from a mistranscription of an advertisement in the 'Daily Courant' for 11 December 1703. After 1706, we know only of benefit performances for her in 1710, in 1718, and finally on 18 May 1719. It seems likely that she was the Mary Hudson of Cross Street, Holborn, buried at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 28 June 1719.

Lindsey, Mary (fl. 1697-1713), singer, made her first known appearance as one of Cynthia's followers in the musical scenes in Elkanah Settle's 'The World in the Moon' at Dorset Garden Theatre in June 1697. Referred to always as Mrs Lindsey, she may not have been married, for the title merely implies that she was of marriageable age. In autumn 1697 she performed songs by Thomas Morgan in George Powell's 'The Imposture Defeated' and sang in Morgan's 'Musick of the Generall Peace', celebrating the treaty of Ryswick. When Princess Anne (later queen) attended a performance of John Crowne's 'Caligula' (1698), Mrs Lindsey sang a song specially written for the occasion by the bass singer and composer Richard Leveridge. Eight years later she and Leveridge were two of the 'best Singers and Dancers, Foreign and 'English'' (Downes, 98) who appeared in a command performance at court for Queen Anne. 
Mary Lindsey's only speaking role appears to have been Fardell, 'an Affected Tattling Nurse', in Thomas Durfey's 'The Campaigners' (June 1698), when she sang Daniel Purcell's amusing lullaby, 'My dear cockadoodle', but she was frequently advertised as a singer of incidental music and songs between the acts. She also appeared at York Buildings, then London's leading concert venue. February 1699 saw the premiere at Drury Lane of Peter Motteux's dramatic opera 'The Island Princess', with music by Jeremiah Clarke, Daniel Purcell, and Leveridge. Mrs Lindsey appeared in its various musical interludes as a shepherdess, a pretty country lass courted by Leveridge as a 'Town-spark', and an old woman who sang 'like one without Teeth'. Her mezzo-soprano voice fitted her for the comic older-woman roles which were to become her speciality. In spring 1702, when Wriothesley Russell, second duke of Bedford, sponsored a performance of John Weldon's 'The Judgment of Paris', Mrs Lindsey and Mary Ann Campion each received 3 guineas, the highest fee. One of Weldon's most popular songs, 'Stop o ye waves', was described in 'Mercurius Musicus' for May-June 1701 as ''Orpheus's' Song to the Waves, in the Mask of 'Orpheus and Euridicy' Sung by Mrs 'Linsey''. It is possible that she sang the role of Orpheus in the masque of that name performed at a girls' boarding school at Besselsleigh, near Oxford, in October 1697, when Weldon was organist of New College. However, her commitments at Drury Lane would have made this difficult and the song may have been part of a masque sung at one of Weldon's London concerts. 
In January 1705 Mrs Lindsey created the comic role of Nerina, an old nurse, in the first all-sung English opera in the Italian style, Thomas Clayton's 'Arsinoe'. A year later, in the English version of Giovanni Bononcini's 'Camilla', she played Tullia, an ageing lady courted by Linco (Richard Leveridge) for her money. Comic sub-plots for Leveridge and Lindsey featured in London's next two operas, Clayton's 'Rosamond' (4 March 1707), and John Christopher Pepusch's 'Thomyris' (1 April 1707). At this time she and Leveridge were frequently advertised as performing dialogues by Henry Purcell. In January 1708 London's two theatre companies were reorganized to form an operatic company at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket, managed by John Vanbrugh, while Drury Lane was reduced to an acting company with no singers. Vanbrugh planned to replace Mrs Lindsey with Anna Lodi, but the Italian made too many demands and Lindsey retained her old roles as a member of the Queen's company, where both she and Leveridge were paid $2 a performance. The operas had become dual-language, with Italian castrati and foreign female singers performing in Italian (and receiving up to $7 10's'. a performance). At the Queen's, Mrs Lindsey had one last good role, in the pasticcio 'Love's Triumph' (26 February 1708), where she sang Serpetta, 'an innocent Shepherdess' loved by 'a merry, amorous Shepherd' (Leveridge). In 'Clotilda' (2 March 1709), Mrs Lindsey had only a minor role as an attendant, and the following January the pasticcio 'Almahide' was sung completely in Italian except for two low-life comic interludes in English performed between the acts by Lindsey, the comedian Thomas Doggett, and the soprano Letitia Cross. The following season was her last on the London stage. In July 1712 she and Leveridge performed their comic scenes from 'Thomyris' under the title 'The Loves of Baldo and Media' at the theatre in Greenwich. She gave benefit concerts at York Buildings in March 1711 and Hickford's Great Room on 15 May 1713. Like other female singers who did not appear during a season except at an annual benefit concert, she may by this time have become a teacher of singing.

Green, Bernard (1927-1998), jazz saxophonist, writer, and broadcaster, was born at 260 Meanwood Road, Leeds, on 9 December 1927. His father, David Green, was a tailor and saxophonist and had met his mother, Fanny Fryer, while he was playing with a band in Leeds. They were married in London in 1926 and lived with David's father, an immigrant Russian-Jewish tailor, at 1 Greenwell Street in the Tottenham Court Road area of London, a chaotic family home where music and gambling were endemic. Benny Green was born in Leeds because his mother preferred to be looked after by her own family at this crucial time, but the family were soon back in London to live round the corner from Greenwell Street, in a basement flat in Cleveland Street. Here he grew into the streetwise but sentimental cockney-Jewish character who eventually became a well-loved radio figure, spoilt by doting aunts and on his way to fulfilling a casual prophecy that he would not do a day's paid work until he was twenty-one. He was first educated at Clipstone junior mixed school 'on the slummy edge of Marylebone' and then, as he put it, 'uneducated' at Marylebone grammar school ('The Times', 24 June 1998). After leaving without scholastic distinction in 1941, he continued a sporadic education at the North London emergency secondary school, mainly educating himself, with great success as it turned out, by a thorough indulgence in whatever enthusiasms he happened to discover. These did not include national service, which he endured for 167 days in 1946-7 before contriving his release. 
Benny Green's own writings and a sensitive, amusing, and perceptive book, 'Benny Green: Words and Music' (2000), by his son Dominic Green see his life as falling into two distinct parts -- the early days as a footloose saxophonist, and then, after a complete change in the late 1950s, a second career as a highly professional and wide-ranging writer and broadcaster. Encouraged by his father, he took up the saxophone in 1941, and he started to play professionally in 1943 along with his boyhood friends Ronnie Scott and Harry Klein. He earned a modest living as a jazz musician, achieving the distinction of being voted 'most promising new jazz musician' in a 'Melody Maker' poll in 1953. There had been a brief period of study at the Royal College of Music and a period with the band led by the pianist Ralph Sharon, and in 1953 he joined Ronnie Scott's nine-piece band (which was later expanded). A high point was two days in the ranks of the visiting Stan Kenton orchestra. In 1957 Green played in the Dizzy Reece quintet, but, although an accomplished jazzman and an often outstanding soloist, he decided that he was not destined to make his true mark as a musician. A battery of letters offering his qualifications and qualities as a writer was sent around; one to the Decca Record Company resulted in a commission to write a chapter on jazz saxophone in 'The Decca Book of Jazz' (1958) -- a competent and discerning piece that was one of the best in the book -- followed by a number of record sleeve notes. Green began to write a weekly column for the 'New Musical Express', and in 1958 took over from Kingsley Amis as jazz columnist for 'The Observer'. His experience as a playing musician, a rare asset among the critics of the time, made him a particularly perceptive jazz critic; his book 'The Reluctant Art' (1962) is still one of the best British books on the subject. He also wrote a jazz-slanted novel, 'Blame it on my Youth' (1964), followed by 'Fifty-Eight Minutes to London' (1969), which captured the night life of Brighton, always his favourite town after London. Soon after joining 'The Observer' he became a regular jazz record reviewer for the BBC Third Programme and from then on was rarely absent from radio, notably presenting a Sunday afternoon record programme on Radio 2 during the last twenty or so years of his life. He was always astonished that such a fleeting medium as radio brought a celebrity to his life that years of professional playing and writing had failed to do. He was a natural talker and teller of anecdotes, and his broadcasts were enjoyed by so many because of the bonus of wit and humour that was added to the fund of knowledge and wisdom they contained. 
Once set on his course as a writer and broadcaster, Green laid down the saxophone and thereafter made only brief returns to playing. On 4 January 1962 he married the actress (Ray) Antoinette Franklin, professionally known as Toni Kanal ('b'. 1941/2), and they eventually settled in a large house beyond Watford on the A41 and had five children. Beyond jazz he had a great width and depth of other interests. He was film critic for 'Punch' from 1972, and this work overlapped with a period as literary critic for 'The Spectator'. His literary interests embraced H. G. Wells; George Bernard Shaw -- resulting in one of his best books, 'Shaw's Champions' (1978), on Shaw's interest in prize-fighting; P. G. Wodehouse -- leading to 'P. G. Wodehouse: a Literary Biography' (1981), which dwelt on his theatre writings; and Jerome K. Jerome -- giving rise to a well-annotated edition of 'Three Men in a Boat' (1982). He published an anthology of poems, 'London' (1984), and a short, well-rounded book entitled 'Fred Astaire' (1979). This last item reflected his wide interest in popular music that took in music-hall, on which subject he made one of his best broadcasts, 'Maxie and a Lost Empire' (on Max Miller), and compiled an anthology, 'The Last Empires: a Music Hall Companion' (1986). His own theatre writings included a revised libretto for 'Show Boat' (1972), two Cole Porter compilations staged at the Mermaid, 'Cole' (1974) and 'Oh, Mr Porter' (1977), 'The Quality of Mercer', written with Helen Shapiro, and an anthology, 'Words and Music', given at the Ambassador's Theatre in 1984. Three musicals based on the writings of Shaw were less successful. 
Throughout Green was a prolific journalist and wrote over 2000 scripts for radio, contributed to numerous magazines, wrote record sleeve notes and introductions to archival photographic books, read prolifically, and talked incessantly. His other great passion was cricket. He claimed that one of his great experiences was watching Denis Compton score 167 at Lord's in 1947. From this love came such compilations as 'The Cricket Addict's Archive', four volumes of 'The Wisden Anthology' (1979-83), 'The Lord's Companion' (1987), 'The Wisden Papers' (3 vols., 1989-91), 'The Concise Wisden' (1990), and 'A History of Cricket' (1988). 'Since I retired as a saxophonist', he contentedly wrote, 'I've never gone to work. I just pursue my hobbies' ('Daily Telegraph'). 
It was ironic that, not having smoked until he was twenty-six, Green then succumbed through the sheer boredom of sitting in a touring band's coach. It was seventeen years before he gave up the habit, and by then it had induced the cancer that ended his career. He died in the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea, on 22 June 1998. At the time he was working on books on Gilbert and Sullivan and Ronnie Scott.

Norsa, Hannah (d. 1784), singer and actress, was the daughter of Issachar Norsa (died 1748?), a Jewish tavern keeper. She made her stage debut as Polly in John Gay's 'The Beggar's Opera' on 16 December 1732 in the newly opened Covent Garden Theatre and was an immediate success, the revival having a continuous run of twenty nights. Miss Norsa remained a leading singer and actress at Covent Garden, appearing in numerous ballad operas and musical afterpieces. In February 1733 she created the heroine, Deidamia, in Gay's posthumously produced ballad opera 'Achilles', and in Johann Ernst Galliard's 'Nuptial Masque' she sang Cupid, 'the first Time of her appearing in Boy's Cloaths' ('Daily Journal', 16 March 1734). Her non-singing roles included Dorinda in George Farquhar's 'The Beaux' Stratagem' and Serena in Thomas Otway's 'The Orphan'. Hannah's brother, Master Norsa, appeared with a children's company, the Lilliputians, in May 1734. The following spring he was joined by his younger sister, 'Little Miss Norsa', who then danced at Hannah's Covent Garden benefit on 29 April. Brother and younger sister made their final appearances in June and July 1736 at the Haymarket Theatre. 
Hannah Norsa remained at Covent Garden until early May 1736, when she was taken off the stage by Robert Walpole, first Baron Walpole and later second earl of Orford ('c'.1701-1751), son of the prime minister Sir Robert Walpole and elder brother of Horace Walpole. Lord Walpole's marriage in 1724 to an heiress had proved unhappy; they were living apart and eventually obtained a legal separation. Hannah Norsa remained Walpole's mistress until his death, staying with him at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, after he became earl of Orford in 1745. Mrs Kerrich, the wife of a local rector and daughter of an archdeacon, was favourably impressed, despite earlier misgivings about the propriety of visiting: 'She is a very agreeable Woman, & Nobody ever behav'd better in her Station, She have every body's good word, and bear great Sway at Houghton, She is every thing but Lady, She came here in a Landau & Six horses & one Mr Paxton a young Clergyman with her. (Pyle, 244)' Orford was in debt when he died, and according to William Cooke, Hannah lost the $3000 legacy from her father which she had lent him. However, when she made her will in 1766 she owned about $3000 in stocks, together with diamond jewellery and gold and silver plate, so Cooke's report may have been unfounded. Hannah's sister Rachel had married Edward Wilford, the brother of Priscilla, wife of the theatre manager John Rich, and after Orford's death she lived for a time with the Riches. In August 1766 Hannah Norsa was resident in Rotterdam, on friendly terms with the family of Benjamin Sowden, the minister of the English Presbyterian church there; she left him her 'Bible' and Thomas Tillotson's 'Works' and made generous bequests to his children, while leaving the bulk of her estate to her sister and nephews. She was living in the parish of St Margaret, Westminster, in 1771, when she added a codicil to her will. She died at her lodgings in Queen's Row, Brompton Road, Kensington, and was buried at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, on 28 August 1784.

Fontenelle, Louisa (1769-1799), actress and singer, was born on 31 August 1769 in the parish of St Margaret, Lothbury, London, the daughter of John Fontenell and his wife, Ann. After receiving a boarding-school education designed to fit her for the life of a respectable tradesman's wife, the lively girl became set on a stage career and made her debut at Covent Garden on 6 November 1788, as Moggy in the premiere of John O'Keeffe's comic opera 'The Highland Reel'. The 'European Magazine' commented that her face and figure were attractive and her eyes expressive and that she performed 'with great spirit, vivacity, and comic effect' (p. 373). Later in the season she created Sophia in O'Keeffe's 'The Toy', sang the highwayman Macheath in John Gay's 'The Beggar's Opera', and, at her own benefit, played Priscilla Tomboy in T. A. Lloyd's afterpiece 'The Romp'. Her high spirits pleased at first, but audiences grew tired of 'too much liveliness, and too many gestures' (Haslewood, 2.307) and the Covent Garden management did not retain her beyond her first season. Miss Fontenelle appeared at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, in winter 1789-90, playing soubrette roles in plays and musical afterpieces, and after this performed in London only in the lightweight pieces of the Haymarket summer seasons of 1790-93. In Scotland she also appeared at Glasgow and at the newly opened theatre in Dumfries in 1792 and 1793, where Robert Burns admired 'her personal charms, amiable manner & gentle heart' ('Complete Letters', 683). He wrote a prologue, 'The Rights of Woman', for her benefit in November 1792 and asked that she should include the afterpiece 'The Spoiled Child', in which she played the mischievous boy, Little Pickle. He also wrote the verses 'On Seeing Miss Fontenelle in a Favourite Character' ('Sweet naivete of feature...') and a new prologue for her 1793 benefit. The actor John Brown Williamson (died 1802) was a fellow performer at the Haymarket, in Edinburgh, and at Dumfries. She joined his company of English actors on an unsuccessful tour of Germany, and in 1795 they emigrated together to the USA, where Fontenelle acted as Mrs Williamson, although it is unclear whether they married or whether Williamson's first wife was still alive. They made their American debut at the Federal Street Theater, Boston, Massachusetts, on 25 January 1796, with John in the title role of 'Othello' and Louisa as Little Pickle in the afterpiece. Her performance was described by one critic as 'the most astonishing and brilliant display of theatrical genius ever exhibited in America' (Hornblow, 1.236-7). Williamson was appointed manager of the company in May 1796, but sustained disastrous losses in his first season. The couple acted in New York in summer 1797 and that autumn made their first appearances at Charleston, South Carolina, where Williamson became senior manager of the theatre company the following year and where Louisa's appearances in her three favourite roles, Moggy, Priscilla Tomboy, and Little Pickle, drew crowded houses. In December 1797 she played Rosalind in 'As You Like It', a performance described as 'impressive, gay, touching and pointed' (Willis, 372), and she was later to play Portia and the breeches role of Sir Harry Wildair. She died after three days' illness in Charleston, South Carolina, on 31 October 1799; the Charleston theatre was closed until 4 November as a mark of respect, and John Williamson did not act again for almost two months. He died on 28 March 1802.

George, Georgina (d. 1835), singer and actress, was born in Oxford, the daughter of Tobias George. She was sometimes described as coming from the pipe office, Oxford, so her father may have been a clerk employed in connection with the sheriff's accounts for Oxfordshire. She made her debut at the Holywell Music Room, Oxford, on 11 February 1779 and sang regularly in Oxford concerts for four years. In November 1780 her father was involved in an acrimonious dispute between the cellist G. Monro and her teacher, Dr Philip Hayes, over her non-appearance at Monro's benefit, from which it is clear that her father was not a clergyman as has been stated. She moved to London in 1783 to sing at the Haymarket Theatre in the summer and began a three-year engagement at Drury Lane that autumn. She made her stage debut as Rosetta in the pasticcio 'Love in a Village' and then sang Euphrosyne in Thomas Arne's 'Comus' and the taxing role of Mandane in his 'Artaxerxes'. She became a great favourite at the Haymarket in light musical pieces composed by Samuel Arnold, William Shield, and Charles Dibdin, singing there each summer (except for 1788, when she was ill) until 15 September 1789, when she made her last London appearance. She was less successful in the larger, more demanding Drury Lane Theatre, where she was criticized in the press for laughing and talking on stage when in the chorus of singing witches in 'Macbeth'. Her contract was not extended beyond 1786, and she worked at the Brighton Theatre that autumn. When Mary Ann Wrighten left Drury Lane for the USA the 'Gazetteer' of 3 January 1787 suggested that since one star had left, the wandering but brilliant 'Georgium Sidus' might be employed. (This flattering use of Herschel's name for his recently discovered planet Uranus has led to modern reference books describing Georgina George as ''nee' Sidus'.) Miss George was a soprano soloist in the Lent oratorios at Drury Lane in 1784-8 and also sang at Ranelagh. She moved to the Edinburgh Theatre in spring 1788 and to Dublin that autumn, and returned to Edinburgh for the first few months of 1789, when she also fitted in a week with Tate Wilkinson's company in York, playing seven leading roles to fashionable and crowded houses. In Dublin in 1790-91 she sang at the Rotunda concerts and at the Crow Street Theatre, where in November 1790 she played Lucy to Elizabeth Billington's Polly in John Gay's 'The Beggar's Opera'. After Mrs Billington had been applauded for singing her verse of their duet in the second act with sweetness and expression, 'Miss George in reply, availing herself of her extraordinary compass of voice, and setting propriety at defiance, sang the whole of her verse an octave higher, her tones having the effect of the high notes of a sweet and brilliant flute. (Parke, 128)' At Cork the following year their relationship on stage 'could compare to nothing but St. George and the Dragon' ('Hibernian Chronicle', 20 Oct 1791). 
While performing in John Palmer's new Royalty Theatre in east London in winter 1787-8, Miss George sang in 'Apollo Turn'd Stroller' by Sir John Morella Oldmixon (1758?-1818), a man of fashion and army officer whom she appears to have married between 1788 and 1793. They were in financial difficulties by May 1793, when she was recruited by Thomas Wignell for his new theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. As Mrs Oldmixon, she made her debut at the Chestnut Street Theatre as Clorinda in Shield's 'Robin Hood' on 14 May 1794. She began to take non-singing roles, such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan's Mrs Malaprop in 'The Rivals' and Mrs Candour in 'The School for Scandal'. When she appeared at the Park Theatre, New York, in 1798-9, she was the highest-paid performer 'engaged for the first comic singing characters, and her choice of serious ones -- the best comic old women, and the best chambermaids' (Ireland, 181). Mrs Oldmixon also performed in the pleasure gardens, and many songs, including several by American composers, were published as sung by her. The Oldmixons had separated by January 1809, when a New York paper called her 'a widow with seven children dependent on a mother's professional talents for support' (Porter, 223). Sir John died in eccentric obscurity in 1818. As late as May 1810 the New York theatrical correspondent of the 'Mirror of Taste' described her as 'the only female singer among us!' Mrs Oldmixon retired from the stage in 1814 and settled in Philadelphia, where she ran a ladies' academy with two of her daughters. She died on 3 February 1835.

Robert Arthur Balfour, second Baron Riverdale (1901-1998), steel maker and industrialist, who was born on 1 September 1901 in Sheffield and was educated at Aysgarth School and Oundle School, which he left in 1918 to join his father's firm. He became a director in 1924. His greatest interest was in the scientific and technical aspects of steel making. His obituarist in 'The Times' described him and his father as 'a near-perfect team. Balfour senior was a natural businessman who was happiest drumming up orders overseas and in this country, while Robin took care of the technology at home' ('The Times', 3 July 1998). During the Second World War he served as an officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, seeing action in 'Ark Royal' off Dakar in the operation to sink warships of Vichy France. After the war he returned to the family business, becoming managing director in 1949 and chairman after his father's death in 1957. Following the amalgamation of Arthur Balfour & Co. Ltd with its fellow Sheffield steel firm Darwins to form Balfour Darwins, he was chairman of the latter (1961-9) and then president (1967-75).

Pierce, Kate Edith (1873-1966), librarian, was born at Green Lane Terrace, Kettering, Northamptonshire, on 30 November 1873, the elder of two daughters of Edward Pierce, attorney's clerk, and his wife, Emma Norah, 'nee' Mawby. After attending South College, a private school in Kettering, she became a pupil teacher, before her initial training in librarianship early in 1896. Neither library schools nor professional qualifications had been established at that time, and her informal apprenticeship took the form of several months spent at Clerkenwell public library under the instruction of James Duff Brown whom she described as 'inspire[ing] me with enthusiasm' (Pierce, reminiscences). Duff Brown had pioneered open access to the library stock at Clerkenwell, where borrowers might help themselves to books rather than requesting them from a librarian. 
Later in 1896 Kettering urban council's library committee appointed Pierce chief public librarian for the town, making her one of 17 women employed as chief librarians among the 240 or so English library authorities. The influence of her training was clear from the outset; with Duff Brown as consultant, she set up Kettering's first public library as an open access library, in a room in Corn Market Hall. 
Increasing use led to a change of premises in Kettering, first to Silver Street in 1901, and again in 1904 to the Sheep Street library, one of the first buildings designed as an open access library, and organized on the 'radiating stack system'. The new library was supported by an $8000 Carnegie Trust donation. Andrew Carnegie attended the opening. In 1913 Pierce also took on the role of honorary curator of Kettering's Alfred East Art Gallery. 
Pierce's early career was spent enlarging and establishing Kettering as a model public library service, much visited and admired by others in the profession which was moving towards general implementation of open access. In 1914 Pierce became one of the few women to achieve FLA (Fellow of the Library Association) status. This was the most senior library qualification, and had been newly established by the Library Association to replace the 'ad hoc' examinations organized by individual library authorities. 
Particularly during the pre-First World War era, when complaints about 'sex antagonism' appeared in professional library journals, Pierce was an outspoken advocate of women's rights to pursue librarianship on equal terms with men. During lively exchanges in the 'Library World' journal in 1902-3 and again in 1907, Pierce put up a combative response to suggestions that women were inadequate workers who would diminish the profession. She argued that women not only had a right to such work, but also that they could, as she herself was doing, hold the most senior posts. Her professional correspondence, however, shows a keen awareness that this would not amount to equal pay. Her entry on librarianship in 'A guide to the professions and occupations of educated women and girls' (n.d.), published by the Central Bureau for the Employment of Women, emphasized the need to obtain relevant qualifications. 
Pierce's standing in the library profession was reflected in her tenure of many senior posts in professional bodies. In 1913 she was elected vice-president of the North Midlands Library Association (NMLA) and the following year became president. In 1915, following nomination as a candidate by women librarians, she was the first woman to be elected to the Library Association (LA) council. This coincided with the moment when women began to dominate numerically in the profession. She was re-elected to her post many times until 1937. Pierce also held other LA posts including chairman of the Hospital Libraries Committee. Pierce was president of the NMLA once more between 1932 and 1934, overseeing the amalgamation of the regional association with the national LA. 
More negotiations with the Carnegie Trust took place in the mid-1930s when Pierce headed a committee which eventually created the East Midlands Regional Library Bureau, set up to enable inter-library lending. The bureau began work in 1935 with Pierce as chairman of the executive committee. 
Outside librarianship, Pierce was a skilled dressmaker and co-founder and chairman of Kettering badminton society. After an episode of ill health, in 1939 she retired after over four decades as Kettering's chief librarian. She moved to Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where she died at her home, 11 and 13 Park Road, on 27 March 1966. Her funeral was held in Tunbridge Wells and she was cremated there on 1 April. She left a bequest to the Library Association of $2200. This funds the Kate Pierce international award which is used to assist librarians pursuing international activities which further the interests of librarianship. Her own forthright pursuit of the aim of modernizing librarianship, and her articulate defence of equal status for women within the profession, resound from the pages of the early library press.

Narayan, Rahasya Rudra (1938-1998), barrister and civil rights activist, was born on 11 May 1938 in British Guiana, the ninth of ten children of Sase Narayan, landowner, and his wife, Taijbertie. He came from a politically active Indo-Guyanese family, engaged mainly in trading. He arrived in Britain in 1953 and after a series of menial jobs (including washing dishes at a Lyons' Corner House and working night shifts at a soap factory) joined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. He left the army in 1965, after seven years' service, with the rank of sergeant. He then read for the bar, at Lincoln's Inn. There he helped to found the bar students' union; he became its first president and also captained the inns of court cricket club -- a passion which never left him. He was called to the bar in 1968. On 5 September 1969 he married Dr Naseem Akbar ('b'. 1942/3), medical practitioner, and daughter of Mohamed Akbar, diplomat. They had two daughters, Sharmeen and Yasmeen. 
In advocacy Narayan found his metier. He was a fluent, powerful, and persuasive speaker and, when he needed to be, a sound lawyer. He defended with remarkable success in a series of high-profile trials arising out of confrontations between black people and the police. But he encountered, like other black and ethnic minority barristers, the glass panel beyond which lay the steadier work and heavier briefs which were his due. After learning finally that clients who asked solicitors to brief him were being told he was not available, and angered at the apparent over-sentencing of black defendants, Narayan went public. It is improbable that a more temperate assault on the legal establishment would even have been noticed; but Narayan's protest, loud and uncompromising, was not only noticed -- it resulted in the first of the three disciplinary adjudications which finally drove him from the bar. This one, in 1974, for bringing the administration of justice into disrepute (by alleging that Birmingham solicitors, counsel, and judges were racist), was followed in 1980 by a reprimand for discourtesy to a judge. In 1982 he was acquitted by the bar council of professional misconduct in issuing an extravagant press statement about the attorney-general and the director of public prosecutions (accusing them of 'collusion with the National Front and fanning the flames of racial hatred'), though his accusations were found 'scandalous and contemptuous' and he was suspended for six weeks after being found guilty of four other, unrelated charges ('Daily Telegraph', 30 June 1998). By then he had become an over-heavy drinker and was lashing out at the nearest target. 
Narayan achieved high-profile successes in the trials arising out of the Bristol riots of 1980 and the Bradford petrol bomb case of 1982. Nevertheless in 1984 he was expelled from his chambers in the Inner Temple after assaulting the chambers' head, Sibghat Kadri, at a conference. He announced his intention of qualifying as a solicitor, but failed the Law Society examinations. Then, back at the bar, in 1988 he put himself in the wrong by accepting briefs in two contemporaneous trials. Although he attacked the all-white disciplinary tribunal which heard his case, he was suspended for two years (a fate, he asserted, which did not invariably await counsel who got themselves overbooked). In the following year he polled 177 votes standing as an independent in the Vauxhall by-election, in protest at the Labour Party's 'outrageous and blatant exclusion of black candidates for a constituency made safe for Labour by black votes' ('Daily Telegraph', 30 June 1998). 
His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 26 March 1988 Narayan married Saeeda Begum Shah ('b'. 1948/9), property dealer, and daughter of Fazal Karim Asif, advocate. This marriage, too, ended in divorce. In 1991 Narayan returned to Guyana, where little went his way. He returned to Britain three years later, an activist now without roots, an advocate turned demagogue, an anti-racialist stained with antisemitism, and now a terminal drinker. The series of disciplinary adjudications culminated in 1994 in his disbarment, for professional misconduct. In 1995 a minor riot followed his speech outside Brixton police station, following the death of a black man in custody. Narayan himself died at King's College Hospital, Lambeth, London, on 28 June 1998, of cirrhosis of the liver. He was survived by the two daughters of his first marriage. 
Narayan left behind him far more than a trail of failures. The Society of Black Lawyers, which he played a leading part in founding in 1973, remained as a necessary voice for an important professional minority. His books 'Black Community on Trial' (1976), 'Black England' (1977), 'Barrister for the Defence' (1985), and 'When Judges Conspire' (1989) may one day be revisited as more than memorials to his self-regard, though they are certainly that. The Lambeth Law Centre, of which he was the first chairman and where he held regular surgeries, survived him in a pivotal role in the south London community. 
Above all, it was the waves made by a man who was too volatile and too intransigent ever to coast to success on them himself which in Narayan's lifetime began to erode the bar's and the legal system's self-assurance about racial discrimination. The setting up of the bar council's race relations committee in 1984, and the continued concern which produced an amendment of the 'Race Relations Act' to outlaw race discrimination in the legal profession, and then, in 1995, the bar's own equality code, all owed something -- possibly a good deal -- to the attention which Narayan had drawn to a legal profession which had much to be embarrassed about. That he had done so extravagantly and intemperately, alienating many other ethnic minority lawyers on the way, may be less a criticism of him than an illustration of the fact that it tends to be only when an angry member of a disadvantaged group exposes him- or herself to fire that things begin to change. In his assault on the English legal system Narayan sacrificed his reputation, his practice, his bearings, and his health; but through the breach he made, younger black advocates have since passed.

Rayner, Derek George, Baron Rayner (1926-1998), businessman and civil servant, was born at 47 Waterloo Road, Norwich, on 30 March 1926, the son of George William Rayner, a shoe finisher, and his wife, Hilda Jane, 'nee' Rant. He had a comfortable upbringing and was educated at the City College, Norwich, before going to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he read theology. His initial intention was to enter holy orders, but he decided against this and after a national service commission in the RAF (1946-8) he started a career as the manager of a small 'fancy goods' retail business in Norwich. The failure of this venture, due mainly to a lack of capital, marked the start of his career at Marks and Spencer where he became a trainee manager in 1953. It was during his time as a trainee at the Oxford Street store that his talents were first recognized by the chairman, Marcus Sieff. Well educated and tall, Rayner most probably stood out from the average shop assistant, and Sieff was impressed by his knowledge of food retailing. He was quickly transferred to the organization's head office at Baker Street where he worked mainly in the food business. 
In 1967 Rayner joined the management board. He was first and foremost a retailer and took an expert interest in the design, quality, and value-for-money aspects of Marks and Spencer. His business talents and transparent integrity were also recognized outside of retailing, and in 1970 the prime minister, Edward Heath, seconded Rayner into government service. He was placed in the defence procurement agency within the Ministry of Defence, where he became chief executive in 1971. Knighted in 1973, he returned to Marks and Spencer as a joint managing director, but the period up to 1983 was marked by a division of his time between the retail trade and government work. When Margaret Thatcher formed her first government in 1979 she also called upon Rayner to bring the cost-control techniques of Marks and Spencer into the civil service. Although he was well attuned to Thatcher's way of thinking, he always resisted suggestions that he was concerned only with cutting costs. Nevertheless his so-called efficiency unit did make large savings, and across some 135 government departments an estimated 10,000 jobs were cut. There were successes, most notably the simplification of the unemployment benefit system, but on the whole he failed to produce radical reforms. There were also more lasting criticisms, such as those relating to his attempts to cut costs at the central statistical office, which many believed led to a loss of reliable official statistics. 
In 1983 Rayner received a life peerage, becoming Baron Rayner of Crowborough, and returned to the full-time post of chief executive at Marks and Spencer, taking over as chairman from Lord Sieff in the following year. He was the first head of the company to be neither a family member nor Jewish, and it is to the credit of the Sieff family that they recognized his strong talents. During the early 1980s the company was starting to feel the pressure from new competitors in the high street and beginning to lose its supremacy. Rayner set about modernizing Marks and Spencer with a series of broad-ranging strategies all tied to new approaches, while retaining the company's traditions. Some have argued that he was not so much a breath of fresh air in the company as a force-nine gale. He was autocratic in his management style and had little tolerance for long discussions at business meetings. He led strategic developments overseas and took Marks and Spencer to the United States through the takeover of the Brook Brothers menswear chain. This was the start of a global strategy that saw the company expand into the Middle and Far East as well as continental Europe. The internationalization process did bring problems, especially in North America, where the company had to close stores in Canada, while operations in the USA proved too expensive, and yielded poor returns. A second of Rayner's reforms involved moving into 'out of town' sites, the first at the Metro-Centre at Gateshead. This marked a break with the high street tradition, but opened up important new opportunities. Other successful experiments involved the introduction of financial services for customers, alongside the St Michael chargecard and new lines of merchandise, including household goods and furniture. Of equal importance was Rayner's introduction of improved financial controls and the increased use of information technology throughout the company. These innovations restored the fortunes of the company and made it one of the most successful retailers in the world during the 1990s. Despite his efforts the North American operations did not go well. However, under Rayner's chairmanship, the company doubled its sales and pre-tax profits. He retired as chairman in 1991. 
Rayner was a complex man, possessing a curious mixture of assurance, toughness, shyness, and a degree of sensitivity. This complexity was reflected in his beliefs, since he claimed that the study of theology as a student had stopped him believing. However, he had a lifelong striving for a sense of purpose, which involved a constant questioning of his life. This did not produce an introverted character, but rather someone with ambition, drive, and a love of the good things in life. He was a genial man of considerable charm. He found happiness and relaxation in good food, travel, and gardening. After his retirement from Marks and Spencer he became a keen gardener at his home in Crowborough, Sussex. His main joy was in classical music, especially Bach and Haydn, and choral music. In spite of his busy life, he found time to be president of St Bartholomew's Hospital medical college, trustee of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and chairman of the Coronary Artery Disease Research Association. Rayner never married, though he did strike up some long-standing intimate friendships. He died at Ashford Hospital, Stanwell, Surrey, on 26 June 1998.

Clayton, Sir Robert James (1915-1998), electronics engineer, was born on 30 October 1915 at 122 Bishops Road, Fulham, London, an only son of Frank Clayton, wine merchant's assistant, and his wife, Flora, 'nee' Gilibanks. The experiences of his early years strongly influenced his character. His parents had a struggle to support themselves because his father, originally a clerk, had been invalided out of the services in the First World War and could seek only outdoor work. Thoughts of emigration to Canada were then dashed by his early death and Clayton's mother had to make a meagre living as a dressmaker. In later years he said that in effect he had been brought up by the Boy Scouts, convincing him that he could succeed by his own efforts. Nevertheless these pressures led to a somewhat shy nature which he covered with a shell of knowledge to give him authority. 
Hard work at school won Clayton two county scholarships leading to a major scholarship at Christ's College, Cambridge, specializing in physics, which was to become the foundation of his career. Upon graduating in 1937 he joined the General Electric Company (GEC) research laboratories, at that time one of the leading industrial research centres, to work on the company's new television receivers. In spite of the turmoil of the emerging electronics industry, for the rest of his career he remained with GEC. With the outbreak of war the GEC laboratories were soon in the forefront of radar development and Clayton's expertise was quickly applied to the development of airborne radar equipment. When the BBC resumed television service from Alexandra Palace after the war GEC won the important contract to implement the first link to another transmitter at Birmingham. This was based on Clayton's advanced proposal for a microwave radio relay, and, being given responsibility for the project, Clayton thought it a matter of honour to make it work. By a force of character that developed during this period he coerced the rest of the laboratories to assist in bringing television to Birmingham on time in 1950. On 2 April 1949 he had married Joy Kathleen (1925/6-1997), daughter of Allan McFarlane King, an electrician, and they moved to live at Stanmore. They had no children. 
In 1955 GEC invited Clayton to establish its new applied electronics laboratories at Stanmore to create a defence electronics capability, initially centred on developing missile guidance systems for the Royal Navy. By 1963 all the diverse GEC activities in electronics were brought together with Clayton as managing director. At this point Arnold Weinstock took control of the vulnerable GEC and with government encouragement embarked on the rationalization of the fragmented UK electrical industry. He soon recognized that Clayton could provide the necessary technical input to his own financial acumen and in 1968 appointed Clayton technical director of the enlarged company. Clayton continued in this role, while turning his attention from streamlining the overlapping activities of the acquired companies to future ventures. However, Weinstock's growing financial caution was a limiting factor and after Clayton joined the main board in 1978 he acted mainly in an advisory role and as the technical presence of the GEC on major issues, until he retired in 1983. 
Clayton's strength lay in his lifelong passionate interest and involvement in the latest developments in science and technology. To this end he maintained informal contact with a number of trusted technical staff in GEC's hundred or more subsidiary companies. He was active in the relevant professional institutions, both in their management and by giving many prestige lectures. He was a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society; an honorary fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, becoming president in 1975; and a fellow of the Institute of Physics, becoming president in 1982. He was also a fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering (later the Royal Academy of Engineering) and its vice-president for 1980-82. He was awarded several honorary degrees and in 1983 he was made an honorary fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. Another outcome was the invitation to join many 'quangos', which Clayton welcomed, both from his desire to widen his understanding of technical issues and policies and also from a GEC perspective. Among these were the National Enterprise Board (1978-80), the National Electronics Council (1973-83), the parliamentary and scientific committee (1983-6), and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (1983-9). At various times he also served on the University Grants Committee; standing conference on schools, science & technology; the advisory council of the Science Museum; and the British Library board. He was particularly concerned with the need to recognize the impact of information technology in both products and new skills required for creation and use. Against this background he gave high priority to work for the Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development, and also his chairmanship of the IT skills agency. His earlier work at the GEC had led to the award of an OBE (1960) and CBE (1970), and, with later contributions to public matters, a knighthood in 1980. 
Clayton was a significant force in the post-war development of electronics in the UK. His natural inclination was to understand the technical basics and from them argue for the GEC and the UK to recognize the need to accept the implications of IT in products, markets, and skills. During the period of rationalization of the UK electronics industry he was often perceived as a hard man who implemented Weinstock's plans. Equally, others saw him as protecting the essential research and development activities and endeavouring to move GEC into areas of future growth -- often against a company culture of short-termism. His attitude and appearance, which was influenced by his poor sight, could be intimidating and yet reflected his impatience for results. 
Clayton's previous interests kept him very busy in retirement, and in hobbies he showed the same intense dedication as in work. His close association with the GEC research laboratories over the years motivated him to produce two books covering their history, but he also insisted in keeping abreast of the latest developments and grew concerned about environmental issues; his wife, Joy, shared the same interests. In his retirement ill health and blindness increasingly restricted his activities. This he bore with great fortitude and fought with the latest technology, but Joy was his mainstay, and he was bereft when she died in 1997. He died at Northwick Park Hospital, Brent, on 20 June 1998, and in accordance with his wishes his cremation was marked only by an informal gathering of friends and the dedication of a copse of trees of the Woodland Trust.

Tomson, Giles (1553-1612), bishop of Gloucester, was born in London, the son of Giles Tomson, a grocer. He attended Merchant Taylors' School from 1564, and went up in 1571, as an exhibitioner, to University College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1575 and proceeded MA in 1578; he was incorporated at Cambridge the same year. He became a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, in 1580, served as university proctor in 1586, and received his BD in 1590. At Elizabeth I's visit to Oxford in 1592 he distinguished himself by determining the natural philosophy disputation with 'a very learned and discreet speach' (Nichols), which from the queen's viewpoint probably also had the great merit of brevity. In the same year Tomson acquired the living of Pembridge in Herefordshire, and in 1594 a canonry in Hereford Cathedral from Bishop Westfaling. It appears that he never married. Some time in the late 1590s he became chaplain to Queen Elizabeth, preaching before her in the Lenten sermons of 1598 and 1599. He received his DD in 1602 and the plum deanery of Windsor in February 1603. Over the next nine years he often presided at chapter meetings at Windsor where he handled estate business and administered discipline to errant clerks and poor knights, one of whom accused him in 1608 of oppressive government. He remained a royal chaplain on the accession of James I. 
In January 1604 Tomson attended the Hampton Court conference, though there is no record of his contribution. At the meeting it was agreed that a new translation of the 'Bible' be prepared and Tomson was appointed to a team of eight Oxford theologians helping with the Greek versions of the gospels, 'Acts', and 'Revelation'. Tomson was a 'good friend' of the poet John Davies, who praised his lively conversation and claimed that in Tomson's face 'witt, and pietie doth shine' ('Microcosmos', 1603, sig. Nn2i'r'); John Manningham attended a court sermon that Tomson preached in April 1603, noting that he used 'a sounding laboured artificiall prounciacion' ('Diary of John Manningham') as Tomson, it seems, commented tartly on the scramble for position with the imminent arrival of the new king. 
Tomson continued to preach at the Jacobean court and, though his patrons remain obscure, in 1611 he earned the bishopric of Gloucester. He was consecrated on 9 June at Lambeth, having received permission to retain the deanery of Windsor for a year after his consecration; he died at Windsor Castle almost to the day, on 14 June 1612, not yet having visited his diocese. He was buried in Bray chapel at St George's Chapel, Windsor, with a monument depicting him, half-length, in the pulpit.

Wilder, Philip van (d. 1554), musician, was born probably in the Low Countries at the close of the fifteenth century. During the second quarter of the sixteenth century he oversaw secular music-making at the English court; in particular his position brought him close to Henry VIII, who was himself an enthusiastic and proficient musician. As a composer, van Wilder is of only modest significance within a broad European context, but his works were widely known and influential in sixteenth-century England. He seems to have belonged to a musical family; two other musicians of the name van Wilder also served the Tudor court during Henry VIII's reign. Nothing is known about him before about 1522, when he is first recorded as being resident in London. By 1525 he was serving as a lute player to the king and commanded a substantial salary implying special status. He was granted licences to import wine from Gascony and woad from Toulouse; he also received income from property granted in London and Dorset, and gifts from the king and from Princess Mary. His denization was granted on 10 April 1539. He lived in the London parish of St Olave, from 1537 with his wife, Frances, with whom he had two daughters and four sons; one son, Henry, also became a musician in the privy chamber. 
As a member (later a gentleman) of the privy chamber, van Wilder occupied a position of high rank. His own instrument was the lute, which he not only played but also taught to Henry's children, Mary and Edward. He had charge of a group of singers, men and boys, unconnected to the choir of the Chapel Royal, and it was presumably for them that the majority of his vocal works were composed. He was also responsible for the upkeep of the royal instruments at Westminster. The scope of that last position is made clear from the great inventory of Henry VIII's possessions at his death; it lists thirteen organs, nineteen other keyboard instruments (virginals and clavichords), and several hundred smaller wind and string instruments including viols, lutes, and recorders. 
Virtually no lute music by van Wilder is known to exist. Instead, his surviving works are mainly 'chansons' to French texts, some thirty in number. A few of these were printed in Antwerp during his lifetime, but the majority are found only in Elizabethan manuscript sources, where they are largely transmitted either without text, as if for instrumental performance, or as 'contrafacta' adapted to sacred or secular English words. Stylistically they range from compact settings in the manner of Claudin de Sermisy to more densely polyphonic works for as many as seven voices. Several motets by him also survive; one of them, 'Sancte Deus', is written in a recognizably English idiom. Van Wilder's works circulated largely under the name Philip or Phillips, a fact that until recently caused confusion between him and the later English composer Peter Phillips. 
Philip van Wilder died in London on 24 February 1554, and was buried at St Olave, Hart Street. The following anonymous tribute to him was printed four years after his death in Richard Tottel's poetic miscellany 'Songs and Sonettes': '
Bewaile with me, all ye that have profest 

Of musicke, th'arte by touche of coarde or winde; 

Laye downe your lutes and let your gitterns rest. 

Phillips is dead whose like you can not finde, 

Of musicke much exceeding all the rest. 

Muses, therefore, of force now must you wrest 

Your pleasant notes into an other sounde. 

The string is broke, the lute is disposest, 

The hand is cold, the bodye in the grounde. 

The lowring lute lamenteth now therefore 

Phillips her frende that can her touche no more. 
(Tottel, sig. XI'v')' Until the late twentieth century van Wilder was rarely given more than passing mention by British musicologists, whose writings on the Tudor period tended to concentrate on the achievements of native musicians. His rehabilitation has been brought about largely by American scholarship.

Bridges, Thomas (c.1842-1898), dictionary compiler, missionary, and sheep farmer, was found abandoned, perhaps on a bridge near Bristol, aged about two and a half, and taken to an orphanage, the name of which remains unknown. He was adopted by the Revd George Pakenham Despard, master of a private school in Stapleton, Bristol, and later secretary of the Patagonian Missionary Society. The aim of the society was to establish a mission among the indigenous Yamana, or Yaghan, people of the Beagle Channel area of southern Tierra del Fuego. Earlier attempts to establish a mission had failed. In 1833 Robert Fitzroy repatriated to Tierra del Fuego the Fuegians that he had taken on his first voyage, with the intention of leaving one, Jemmy Button, in the care of Richard Matthews, who hoped to establish a mission on the island. The terrified Matthews soon re-embarked on the 'Beagle'. A second attempt was made in 1850, by Allen Gardiner and six companions, who starved to death in 1851. In 1856 Despard, a close friend of Gardiner and now mission superintendent, travelled to Keppel Island, in the Falklands, taking his family with him. An attempt to establish a settlement on Tierra del Fuego in 1859 ended in the massacre of the missionaries by the Yamana. Bridges had been left behind on Keppel because of his youth. Despard, who had stayed behind to deal with administrative matters, resigned and returned to England, leaving the young Bridges temporarily in charge of the mission. With the help of the Yamana who had been settled by Despard on Keppel, Bridges set about compiling a dictionary of their language. On his arrival, in January 1863, Despard's successor, the Revd W. H. Stirling, found Bridges proficient in Yamana and studying its intricate grammar system. In that year they travelled together to Tierra del Fuego, to find that measles had killed many of the Yamana. In 1867 they founded a settlement in Ushuaia ('inner harbour to the west'), a large natural harbour on the northern shore of the Beagle Channel. 
Recalled to England in the following year by the Patagonian Missionary Society (now renamed the South American Missionary Society), Bridges was ordained deacon. While lecturing in Bristol in 1869 he met and married Mary Ann Varder (1842-1922), a teacher from Harbeton, Devon, and almost immediately set sail for the Falklands. With their nine-month-old daughter (also Mary Ann, who later married the missionary Wilfrid Barbrooke Grubb) they left Keppel in 1871 to settle permanently in Ushuaia. There Bridges acted as judge and peacemaker to the Yamana, whom he named Yaghan after their word for the Murray Narrows, the geographical centre of their land. In 1884, as visitors to Tierra del Fuego increased, another outbreak of disease struck Ushuaia, killing over half the native population. Bridges urged the missionary society to obtain land away from encroaching civilization for the Yaghan to settle on, but they declined on the grounds that a mission should confine itself to evangelical work. Disillusioned, and with a growing family, Bridges abandoned his missionary work and obtained a lease on land some 40 miles east of Ushuaia. In 1887 the family moved there and began rearing sheep brought over from the Falklands on a farm named Harbeton after Mary's birthplace in Devon. 
Early in 1898 the 'Belgica', carrying an expedition to the South Pole, ran aground near Harbeton. On board was Dr Frederick A. Cook, the American explorer, who persuaded Bridges that he could arrange publication of his Yamana-English dictionary. Bridges had continued his work on the dictionary with enthusiasm: 'Incredible though it may appear, the language of one of the poorest tribes of men, without any literature, without poetry, song, history or science, may yet through the nature of its structure and its necessities have a list of words and a style of structure surpassing that of other tribes far above them in the arts and comforts of life. My dictionary of Yaghan has One Thousand and Eighty One pages, each averaging 30 words, which multiplied make thirty-two thousand four hundred and thirty words. (T. Bridges, xvii)' Cook arranged to pick up the manuscript on his return from Antarctica. In the meantime Bridges sailed with a cargo of timber for sale in Buenos Aires, but fell ill in Bahia Blanca during the return journey and was transferred to the British Hospital in Buenos Aires, where he died, of stomach cancer, on 15 July 1898. He was buried in the city's Chacarita cemetery. On his return Cook carried off the manuscript, the fruit of some thirty years' work by Bridges, together with a collection of papers relating to the Yamana language. News later reached the Bridges family that the Observatoire Royal Belgique was printing the dictionary under the authorship of Cook, with a statement in small print that Thomas Bridges had been 'instrumental in collecting the words' (L. Bridges, 534). 


During its early years Harbeton farm was visited by a small party of Haush, or Manekenk. Their numbers reduced to around sixty, the Haush had been gradually forced further into the swamps and marshes of south-eastern Tierra del Fuego by the Selk'nam, or Ona. In 1894 Bridges made contact with the Selk'nam, feared nomadic hunters who roamed over the steppes of northern and central Tierra del Fuego and were the last Patagonian tribe to come into contact with Europeans. The discovery of gold in 1881 and the establishment of large sheep farms over most of their territory led to conflicts in which the poorly armed Selk'nam suffered heavy loss of life. Many more died from disease and despair in the missions established by the Salesians on Dawson Island and Tierra del Fuego. Bridges befriended the survivors, who had been forced into the inhospitable mountains of southern Tierra del Fuego, learned to speak their language, and accompanied them on trips hunting guanaco (a close relative of the alpaca) and witnessed their religious ceremonies. As pressure on their hunting grounds increased the Selk'nam asked Bridges to establish a farm on the Atlantic coast where they could spend the winter safe from the sheep farmers and miners. In 1907 he obtained a lease to land on the east coast, which he named Viamonte, where he provided shelter and work for some of the Selk'nam. 
Falsifying his age, Bridges joined the Royal Field Artillery in 1914 and saw action in the third battle of Ypres, at Passchendaele. While on leave in 1917 he met and married Jannette McLeod Jardine ('b'. 1890), with whom he had three children. After the war he leased land in an area between the Devuli and Sabi rivers from the British South Africa Company. News of the murder of a farm manager and mounting financial losses in a joint venture brought him back to Patagonia, this time to the remote Rio Baker region of mainland Chile. After suffering several minor heart attacks Bridges retired to Buenos Aires and wrote his autobiography, 'Uttermost Part of the Earth' (1948). He died in Buenos Aires, of a heart attack, on 4 April 1949; he was buried in the city's Chacarita cemetery. Harbeton and Viamonte are still owned by direct descendants of Thomas Bridges. 
In 1850 there were four distinct groups of natives living in Tierra del Fuego and its adjacent archipelago, each with its own language and customs and together numbering at least 10,000. Archaeological evidence suggests that they had been there for over 10,000 years. By the beginning of the twentieth century they were down to a few hundred, and a century later only a handful of old people survived, their languages and traditions forgotten. The Bridges' efforts did not alter their fate, but Thomas's dictionary stands as a record of the Yamana language, while Lucas's autobiography records the customs and way of life of his friends the Selk'nam.
