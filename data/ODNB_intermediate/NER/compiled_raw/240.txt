Kell, Reginald Clifford (1906-1981), clarinettist, was born on 8 June 1906 at 164 Bishopthorpe Road, York, the eldest in the family of two sons and one daughter of Frederick Kell, a theatre music director, and his wife, Edith Porter. As a child he studied the violin, but after leaving school at fourteen he taught himself the clarinet, and joined his father's band. Within a year of taking up the clarinet he was playing in the orchestra at the Opera House, Harrogate, for the silent films, and in 1929 he won an open scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music to study with Haydn Draper, and moved to London. While still a student he played in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1930 to 1931, and on leaving the Royal Academy in 1932 he was invited by Sir Thomas Beecham to take the position of principal clarinettist in his newly formed London Philharmonic Orchestra, chosen because his tone was similar to that of the principal oboist, Leon Goossens. At the same time he was principal clarinettist of the Covent Garden Opera House orchestra, from 1932 to 1936, and from 1935 to 1939 he taught at the Royal Academy; he was made FRAM in 1941. On 23 August 1936 he married Diana Gabrielle ('b'. 1915/16), daughter of the composer Joseph Holbrooke (1878-1958) and sister of Gwydion Brooke, principal bassoonist in the London Philharmonic Orchestra. They had one son. 
Kell left the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1936 after a financial disagreement with Beecham, and for the next twelve years continued to pursue a busy orchestral career. From 1936 to 1939 he was principal clarinettist of the London Symphony Orchestra, finding time also to adjudicate at the international festival of woodwind playing in Vienna in 1938, played in the Toscanini International Orchestra at the Lucerne festival in 1939, and then joined the BBC Salon Orchestra, formed in 1939 to broadcast high-quality light music during the war. The Salon Orchestra was based in Bristol until 1941, when it moved to Evesham, and before it was disbanded in July 1942 Walter Legge, recording manager of EMI, recorded several works with some of the leading players, including Kell; his first recordings of the Mozart and Brahms clarinet trios date from 1941. Kell was principal clarinettist of the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra from 1942 to 1945. When Walter Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1945, he appointed Kell principal clarinettist, and at the orchestra's first public concert, in the Kingsway Hall on 27 October 1945, Kell played the Mozart clarinet concerto in an all-Mozart programme conducted by Beecham. He also became principal clarinettist of Beecham's new orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, in 1946, while remaining at the Philharmonia until 1948. 
After touring the United States with the Busch Quartet in November 1948, Kell decided to give up orchestral playing in order to pursue a solo and chamber music career, and emigrated to the United States, where his style of playing became very popular. As well as performing in the United States and Canada, he was a professor at the Aspen Music School in Colorado from 1951 to 1957. He spent 1958 to 1959 in England, teaching at the Royal Academy, where his pupils included Harrison Birtwistle and Alan Hacker, and gave his last solo performance in 1959 at the Bath Festival, playing the Mozart clarinet concerto conducted by Yehudi Menuhin. He then took up an administrative appointment as a director of the band instrument division of the musical instrument distributors Boosey and Hawkes in New York, from 1959 to 1966. 
Kell made many fine recordings; one of his most famous was that of the Brahms clarinet quintet, with the Busch Quartet, recorded in 1937, and his recording of Schubert's 'Der Hirt auf dem Felsen' with Elizabeth Schumann in 1936 was a landmark. Other recordings included the first complete version of Schumann's 'Phantasiestucke'. In 1939 he recorded one of the two clarinet quintets composed by his father-in-law, Joseph Holbrooke. He had a very sweet and expressive tone, influenced by the oboe playing of Leon Goossens, and used a lot of vibrato, in contrast to the firm, clear tone of his contemporary Frederick Thurston, the other leading British clarinettist of his generation, although there were some who found his use of vibrato and his free use of rhythm excessive. '17 Staccato Studies' (1958) and a clarinet tutor, the 'Kell Method' (1968), were published in New York. 
In 1971 Kell returned to live in England, and in his retirement took up watercolour painting, but in 1975 he moved back to America. In 1978 he exhibited a one-man show during the Aspen music festival. He died on 5 August 1981 in Frankport, Kentucky, USA. He was survived by his wife.

Leighton, Charles Blair (1823-1855), artist and printer, was born on 6 March 1823, the son of Stephen Leighton and Helen Blair. From the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a silver-engraver but after serving his seven-year training he opted for a change of career. He had always devoted his spare time to drawing and was evidently gifted as he was accepted as a student at the Royal Academy. From his early twenties, in 1843, until the year before his death he practised as an artist and sent more than twenty paintings to the Royal Academy exhibitions, and several others to the British Institution in 1853 and 1855 from his home in Red Lion Square, Holborn, London. Given his commitment to the human figure and his time spent studying anatomy, his greatest strength was in figure painting and consequently most of the subjects he executed were either portraits or history paintings of literary and biblical subjects, such as 'Moses Raising the Brazen Serpent' (1843) or 'The Assassination of Richard III' (1843). Charles Blair Leighton enjoyed modest success as an artist but the most outstanding artist in the family was Edmund Blair Leighton (1853-1922), his son with his wife, Caroline Boosey, daughter of the music publisher Thomas Boosey. Elected to the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours in 1887, he too was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, where he exhibited genre and figure paintings almost annually between 1878 and 1904. 
Charles Leighton and his younger brother George Cargill Leighton (1826-1895) were most prominent as publishers of colour prints, trading as the Leighton Brothers. George Leighton was born in 1826, and was indentured to the wood-engraver George Baxter (1804-1867) when he was only ten years old. This apprenticeship was to prove especially influential to the young Leighton's career. Not only did Baxter specialize in colour book illustrations but he was a pioneer of colour woodblock print technology. In 1835 he patented a new technique for oil colour printing where the key design was transferred from a single intaglio print and the colour developed by individual woodblocks, inked with an oil colour. As this resulted in highly nuanced 'prints of subtle colouring and minute detail' (Engen, 'Wood Engravers', 25) Baxter christened this technique 'picture-printing'. 
In 1843, after finishing his seven-year indenture, George Leighton joined several other of Baxter's pupils to establish a colour printing company named Gregory, Collins, and Reynolds. They were one of a number of firms to employ Baxter's patented technique under licence. In 1849, after the three partners went their separate ways, George went into partnership with his brother Charles and the firm continued under the name Leighton Brothers, at 19 Lamb's Conduit Street. On 19 April he married Margaret, daughter of Robert Faraday, at St Pancras register office. It was also in this year that Baxter's patent expired. When he filed for its renewal, his former pupil Leighton contested this, stating that he had a right to employ the same technique and that using it under licence was diminishing his livelihood. Even if his motives were entirely self-interested, the fact that Leighton fought this case in court single-handedly and without any legal aid is an indication of his confidence and resolve. He was, however, unsuccessful in his petition and Baxter won the case. Consequently Leighton was no longer able to employ Baxter's methods of printing intaglio plates with woodblocks and, according to Ruari McLean, having to do without this facility 'probably helped to ensure his commercial success' (McLean, 191). In contrast, Leighton Brothers specialized in colour printing from numerous separate colour plates whose careful registration they ensured. Such was the quality of their results that in 1851 they exhibited at the Great Exhibition; they also won a commission to produce colour plates for the 'Art Journal'. Moving to premises at 4 Red Lion Square in 1852, over the following years they produced subtle and splendidly coloured plates for a number of volumes where the colour was essential to the success of the book. For example, in 1853, they illustrated 'The Poultry Book', a serious work on the breeding of poultry with 'vivid portraits' (ibid., 192) of these birds. They also produced the plates for various other art and illustrated books including George Barnard's 'Landscape Painting' (1854) and Harriet Martineau's 'The English Lakes' (1858). 
Following Charles Blair Leighton's death on 6 February 1855 at Kingsland, Middlesex, George became a regular printer of colour plates for the 'Illustrated London News'. This was a fortunate move as only two years later Leighton became its publisher until the year before his retirement, in 1884. Of consistently high quality, his coloured plates of flowers, birds, and domestic animals along with the intricate and brightly coloured covers were undoubtedly integral to the success of the 'Illustrated London News'. 
From Stanhope House, a factory in Drury Lane, George Leighton continued to produce art-quality illustrations for a variety of publications including 'Gems of English Art' (1869). Later in his career he was also associated with a number of attractively illustrated children's books. Indeed, in 1885, when he sold up the business to the lithographers Vincent Brooks, Day & Son, he passed over the colour woodblocks for Warren and Routledge's 'Toy Book' series to the wood-engraver Edmund Evans. 
George Cargill Leighton died at his home, Fairlight, Shepherd's Hill, in Highgate, Middlesex, on 8 May 1895.

Lincoln family (per. c.1100-c.1280), gentry, held extensive lands in Dorset and neighbouring counties in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The family may have been descended from Alfred [i] of Lincoln (d. in or before 1110). In 1086 this man, possibly of Breton origin, held land in Thoresway, Lincolnshire, and it was probably the same man who then claimed half a hide of land in Wymington, Bedfordshire. The first member of the Dorset branch of the family was Alfred [ii] of Lincoln (d. in or after 1130). He was also known as Alfred de Nichol, that name being an old French form of Lincoln. He seems to have been the second husband of a Domesday tenant, the widow of Hugh fitz Grip, a former sheriff of Dorset, and he acquired nearly all his wife's lands in the county; these lands were mostly located in the eastern hundreds of Dorset and included land held from Glastonbury Abbey. The feodary of the abbey includes a list of the lands, which in 1086 were held by the widow and then later by the Lincolns and included Duntish and 'Hermyngswell' in Buckland (Buckland Newton), Woodyates and Okeford Fitzpaine in Dorset, and Damerham in Hampshire. The Lincolns also held Colway, probably the manor of Lym, on the border of Devon and Dorset, and Sturminster Newton in Dorset from Glastonbury Abbey at a later date. It may have been Alfred [ii] who witnessed a charter of William II in 1091, and he served as a county justice in Dorset in the reign of Henry I. He witnessed over a dozen royal charters in the period 'c'.1100-22 although he may not have been a member of the royal court. He was a patron of Montacute Priory in Somerset to which he gave 'Brigam' near Weymouth (part of his wife's estate in 1086). He was still living in 1130 when he paid 60 marks to have Pulham manor for his lifetime. 
Alfred's son Robert of Lincoln (d. in or before 1156) presumably succeeded to all his father's estates. His possessions are recorded as including land at Worth Matravers, Langton (either Langton Herring or Langton Matravers), Cheselbourne, and probably Winterborne St Martin. Robert founded the Cluniac priory of Holme as a cell of Montacute Priory in the mid-twelfth century. His foundation grant included land at Holme which his father had bought from Grimbald the Physician before 1107. The endowment also comprised three virgates in Worth Matravers, the tithes of Langton (Herring) and Okeford Fitzpaine, and one tribute of salt from the salt-cotes at Langton (probably Langton Matravers). Robert was married to a certain Beuza and their son Alfred [iii] of Lincoln (d. 1198) confirmed his father's grant to Holme. In addition he also gave to the priory the church of Warmwell, a garden near Bradle, and land at Plush with the right to pasture 10 oxen, 1 heifer, and 250 sheep with the abbot of Glastonbury's cattle. Alfred [iii] was married to Albereda and is first mentioned in the early years of Henry II's reign. In 1166 he returned a 'carta' which recorded that he held twenty-five fees of the old enfeoffment and four fees and eighty parts of fees of the new enfeoffment. Following the inquest of sheriffs in 1170 he was appointed sheriff of Dorset. 
In the early thirteenth century Alfred [iii]'s son Alfred [iv] of Lincoln (d. 1240) was recorded as holding twenty-four and a half fees in Dorset and Somerset. These included lands at Langton (Herring or Matravers), Tatton, Lyme, and Buckland Newton. Alfred acted as a royal justice in Dorset in the 1220s and early 1230s, and in 1230 he was granted protection while he was overseas on the king's service. He married Maud and was succeeded by his son Alfred [v] of Lincoln (d. 1264), who was charged a relief of $100 in 1240. This Alfred was also active in the service of Henry III. In the mid-thirteenth century he was acting as a royal justice in Dorset and Wiltshire. He was commissioned with others to investigate the condition of royal castles in Somerset and Dorset, and also to inquire into 'excesses, trespasses and injuries' in Dorset. In 1242 he was granted protection while on the king's service overseas, and between 1258 and 1263 he was summoned to take part in several royal expeditions to Wales. Alfred [v] died without a male heir and his estates were divided between his sisters Beatrice de Gouiz (died before 1278) and Aubreye of Lincoln (died 'c'.1277), and Robert Fitzpain (died 1281), the son of his eldest sister, Margery (died after 1245), who married Roger Fitzpain. Beatrice and her son William inherited four fees and one-fifth of a knight's fee in Dorset and land at Norton in Somerset; Aubrey's share included over three knights' fees in Dorset at Warmwell, 'Muleburn', 'Lollebrook', and 'Stafford'; Robert's share included livery of the manor and advowson of Winterbourne St Martin, the manor of Langton (probably Langton Herring), and the manors and advowsons of Akeford and Duntish chapel. Alfred's widow, Joan, held almost six knights' fees in dower including land in 'Ringstead', 'Frome Wytefield', and Watercombe. She later married William de Molum, a king's yeoman, the marriage being his reward for service to Henry III and Queen Eleanor.

Lincoln family (per. c.1100-c.1280), gentry, held extensive lands in Dorset and neighbouring counties in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The family may have been descended from Alfred [i] of Lincoln (d. in or before 1110). In 1086 this man, possibly of Breton origin, held land in Thoresway, Lincolnshire, and it was probably the same man who then claimed half a hide of land in Wymington, Bedfordshire. The first member of the Dorset branch of the family was Alfred [ii] of Lincoln (d. in or after 1130). He was also known as Alfred de Nichol, that name being an old French form of Lincoln. He seems to have been the second husband of a Domesday tenant, the widow of Hugh fitz Grip, a former sheriff of Dorset, and he acquired nearly all his wife's lands in the county; these lands were mostly located in the eastern hundreds of Dorset and included land held from Glastonbury Abbey. The feodary of the abbey includes a list of the lands, which in 1086 were held by the widow and then later by the Lincolns and included Duntish and 'Hermyngswell' in Buckland (Buckland Newton), Woodyates and Okeford Fitzpaine in Dorset, and Damerham in Hampshire. The Lincolns also held Colway, probably the manor of Lym, on the border of Devon and Dorset, and Sturminster Newton in Dorset from Glastonbury Abbey at a later date. It may have been Alfred [ii] who witnessed a charter of William II in 1091, and he served as a county justice in Dorset in the reign of Henry I. He witnessed over a dozen royal charters in the period 'c'.1100-22 although he may not have been a member of the royal court. He was a patron of Montacute Priory in Somerset to which he gave 'Brigam' near Weymouth (part of his wife's estate in 1086). He was still living in 1130 when he paid 60 marks to have Pulham manor for his lifetime. 
Alfred's son Robert of Lincoln (d. in or before 1156) presumably succeeded to all his father's estates. His possessions are recorded as including land at Worth Matravers, Langton (either Langton Herring or Langton Matravers), Cheselbourne, and probably Winterborne St Martin. Robert founded the Cluniac priory of Holme as a cell of Montacute Priory in the mid-twelfth century. His foundation grant included land at Holme which his father had bought from Grimbald the Physician before 1107. The endowment also comprised three virgates in Worth Matravers, the tithes of Langton (Herring) and Okeford Fitzpaine, and one tribute of salt from the salt-cotes at Langton (probably Langton Matravers). Robert was married to a certain Beuza and their son Alfred [iii] of Lincoln (d. 1198) confirmed his father's grant to Holme. In addition he also gave to the priory the church of Warmwell, a garden near Bradle, and land at Plush with the right to pasture 10 oxen, 1 heifer, and 250 sheep with the abbot of Glastonbury's cattle. Alfred [iii] was married to Albereda and is first mentioned in the early years of Henry II's reign. In 1166 he returned a 'carta' which recorded that he held twenty-five fees of the old enfeoffment and four fees and eighty parts of fees of the new enfeoffment. Following the inquest of sheriffs in 1170 he was appointed sheriff of Dorset. 
In the early thirteenth century Alfred [iii]'s son Alfred [iv] of Lincoln (d. 1240) was recorded as holding twenty-four and a half fees in Dorset and Somerset. These included lands at Langton (Herring or Matravers), Tatton, Lyme, and Buckland Newton. Alfred acted as a royal justice in Dorset in the 1220s and early 1230s, and in 1230 he was granted protection while he was overseas on the king's service. He married Maud and was succeeded by his son Alfred [v] of Lincoln (d. 1264), who was charged a relief of $100 in 1240. This Alfred was also active in the service of Henry III. In the mid-thirteenth century he was acting as a royal justice in Dorset and Wiltshire. He was commissioned with others to investigate the condition of royal castles in Somerset and Dorset, and also to inquire into 'excesses, trespasses and injuries' in Dorset. In 1242 he was granted protection while on the king's service overseas, and between 1258 and 1263 he was summoned to take part in several royal expeditions to Wales. Alfred [v] died without a male heir and his estates were divided between his sisters Beatrice de Gouiz (died before 1278) and Aubreye of Lincoln (died 'c'.1277), and Robert Fitzpain (died 1281), the son of his eldest sister, Margery (died after 1245), who married Roger Fitzpain. Beatrice and her son William inherited four fees and one-fifth of a knight's fee in Dorset and land at Norton in Somerset; Aubrey's share included over three knights' fees in Dorset at Warmwell, 'Muleburn', 'Lollebrook', and 'Stafford'; Robert's share included livery of the manor and advowson of Winterbourne St Martin, the manor of Langton (probably Langton Herring), and the manors and advowsons of Akeford and Duntish chapel. Alfred's widow, Joan, held almost six knights' fees in dower including land in 'Ringstead', 'Frome Wytefield', and Watercombe. She later married William de Molum, a king's yeoman, the marriage being his reward for service to Henry III and Queen Eleanor.

Fossard family (per. c.1080-1194?), gentry, is first represented in the historical record by Nigel Fossard (d. in or before 1128). He was one of two major 'Domesday' tenants in Yorkshire of Robert, count of Mortain, holding extensive properties from the count in all three ridings. Indeed Nigel Fossard and the other major tenant, Richard de Sourdeval, held almost all the 114 tenant manors of Count Robert in the county and Nigel himself held about 500 carucates in Yorkshire. In the North Riding he had over 200 carucates including 25 in Guisborough, 'Middleton', and Hutton Lowcross, which later formed a castlery centred on Lythe Castle near Whitby. In the East Riding he had about 200 carucates including 13 in each of Watton, Bainton, and Birdsall and 12 in Wharram-le-Street. In the West Riding he had almost 60 carucates including 12 in Bramham. Nigel's estates were confined to Yorkshire and it has been suggested that this concentration of lands resulted from Count Robert's intention that Nigel live and work in the county. After Count Robert's rebellion and fall in 1088 Nigel Fossard's tenancy was transformed into a tenancy-in-chief, although he had already acquired that status because of a small property holding in York. The relationship between the crown and the Fossards was strengthened further in the early twelfth century when Henry I actively encouraged the development of the compact lordship around Lythe Castle as part of his plan to increase royal influence in north-east Yorkshire. Nigel was a patron of St Mary's Abbey, York, to which he gave property in Doncaster and lands and churches in York, Hutton Cranswick, Bainton, and Caythorpe. He also gave Bramham church to Ramsey Abbey. 
It has been suggested that Nigel was living until at least 1120 and it is probable that he survived until nearly the end of the decade because at some point before 1129 his son and successor, Robert Fossard (d. c.1138), was having difficulties with his inheritance. Shortly before 1129 the Fossard estate was in the king's hands for reasons that are unclear and Robert is recorded as making a fine to gain their recovery. It was in that year that the Fossard lands at Doncaster were leased to the crown for twenty years, although neither Robert nor any of his immediate successors was able to redeem the property. Among the recipients of Robert's patronage was Nostell Priory, which received churches in Bramham, Wharram-le-Street, and Lythe and 31/2 carucates of land in the same villages. Unfortunately Robert's gift of Bramham church was made at the expense of his father's gift of the same church to Ramsey Abbey and in a writ issued between 1126 and 1129 Henry I commanded Robert to do right to the abbot of Ramsey while confirming the church to Nostell in a separate charter. Robert's support of Nostell was, however, rather uncertain, as in 1130 another charter of Henry I referred to the fact that Robert and another man had unjustly seized land in Bramham given by Anschetill of Bulmer to the priory. 
Robert was probably dead by 1138, when his son William [i] Fossard (d. 1168/9) was involved in the battle of the Standard against David, king of Scots. The chronicle of Richard of Hexham records that before the battle William was among those Yorkshire barons who assembled with Archbishop Thurstan at York to debate the best course of action to be taken in response to David's aggressive activities in northern England. William was still supporting King Stephen's cause in 1141 when he was captured at the battle of Lincoln. For the rest of the civil war he was probably a political satellite of William le Gros, earl of York. He made a donation to Watton Priory between 1154 and 1160, which referred to his impending journey to Jerusalem, and he may have been on crusade during the early years of Henry II's reign. It was probably this William who made a grant to the hospitallers of Jerusalem at Huntington near York and he was a generous patron of a number of East Riding religious houses including Meaux, Ellerton, and Swine. In 1166 the return of Hugh, bishop of Durham, recorded that William held one knight's fee from the bishop in the East Riding and his own return listed thirty-three and a half fees of the old and new enfeoffment. William [i] died in 1168 or 1169 when the custody of his son William [ii] Fossard (d. 1194?) was given by Henry II to William le Gros. In 1170 William [ii] owed a fine of 10 marks, and by 1171 he was in possession of his father's lands, as in that year he rendered account of 80 marks for a fine of his land. The delay in paying the fine for relief may have been due to difficulties in his relationship with William le Gros. An unconfirmed story from the Meaux chronicle relates that while William [ii] was in the care of the earl he seduced his guardian's sister and had to flee abroad, where he stayed supposedly until 1179. In the meantime William le Gros received royal authority to pull down William's castle at Mountferatt in Birdsall. The fact that Henry II was willing to sanction this action suggests that there had been a deterioration in the relationship between the crown and the Fossards since the reign of Henry I. There is no evidence to suggest that William [ii] ever attended the royal court and he may well have angered Henry II by showing some sympathy for the northern rebellion of 1174. William [ii] Fossard, who was a patron of Meaux Abbey and Watton Priory, probably died in 1194, and by 1197 Robert of Thornham had obtained from Richard I the marriage of William's [ii] daughter and heir, Joan. In that year Thornham consolidated his hold on the Fossard inheritance when he redeemed the former family estate at Doncaster by paying 500 marks to the crown.

In 1166 the return of Hugh, bishop of Durham, recorded that William held one knight's fee from the bishop in the East Riding and his own return listed thirty-three and a half fees of the old and new enfeoffment. William [i] died in 1168 or 1169 when the custody of his son William [ii] Fossard (d. 1194?) was given by Henry II to William le Gros. In 1170 William [ii] owed a fine of 10 marks, and by 1171 he was in possession of his father's lands, as in that year he rendered account of 80 marks for a fine of his land. The delay in paying the fine for relief may have been due to difficulties in his relationship with William le Gros. An unconfirmed story from the Meaux chronicle relates that while William [ii] was in the care of the earl he seduced his guardian's sister and had to flee abroad, where he stayed supposedly until 1179. In the meantime William le Gros received royal authority to pull down William's castle at Mountferatt in Birdsall. The fact that Henry II was willing to sanction this action suggests that there had been a deterioration in the relationship between the crown and the Fossards since the reign of Henry I. There is no evidence to suggest that William [ii] ever attended the royal court and he may well have angered Henry II by showing some sympathy for the northern rebellion of 1174. William [ii] Fossard, who was a patron of Meaux Abbey and Watton Priory, probably died in 1194, and by 1197 Robert of Thornham had obtained from Richard I the marriage of William's [ii] daughter and heir, Joan. In that year Thornham consolidated his hold on the Fossard inheritance when he redeemed the former family estate at Doncaster by paying 500 marks to the crown.

Nesbitt, Mary (1742/3-1825), courtesan and adventuress, was born Mary Davis, of unknown parentage, but was alleged to have been born 'in a wheelbarrow' in Covent Garden ('History of the Tete-a-tete'); she was also called Polly Davis. She was a strikingly beautiful artist's model, first sitting to Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1764. Her career as a courtesan may have been directed by the King of Hell, Simon Luttrell, later first earl of Carhampton, who was possibly her seducer ('Autobiography, Letters and Literary Remains of Mrs Piozzi', ed. A. Hayward, 2, 1861, 23). This connection, allied to Mary's fiery character, may perhaps have earned her the sobriquet Hellfire Davis. Luttrell introduced her to Alexander Nesbitt ('bap'. 1730, died 1772), youngest of the three sons of Thomas Nesbitt (died 1750), who were in partnership as merchants and bankers in the City of London. Luttrell encouraged Mary's marriage to Nesbitt, on 25 February 1768, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, and was both a witness to it and a trustee of Mary's marriage settlement, by which Nesbitt settled on her for life his new house and its estate at Upper Norwood in Surrey. The couple also lived in London at 10 Buckingham Street. 
According to a 'Tete-a-tete' pen portrait of 1775, by 1769 Mary's contemptuous treatment of Nesbitt and her continued connections with the 'demi-monde' had caused his insanity. He certainly suffered a mental collapse and was confined in private lodgings near Blackfriars; he died in 1772. The story of Mary and Nesbitt was told, and Mary's behaviour vilified, by Junius in his letter of 27 November 1771. By 1771 Mary had become the mistress of the Hon. Augustus John Hervey (1724-1779), naval officer, second son of John Hervey, Lord Hervey of Ickworth (1696-1743), and Mary Lepell ['see 'Hervey, Mary]; Hervey became third earl of Bristol in 1775, when his alliance with Mary was pilloried in the aforementioned 'Tete-a-tete' portrait, and Mary was again castigated for abusing her husband. Mary and Hervey lived together, apparently faithfully, at Norwood House, at 6 St James's Square, and at Ickworth House, Suffolk, but were prevented from marrying when the earl's divorce petition was dismissed, in 1779, because of his collusion in his wife Elizabeth's 1769 action to have their marriage declared void. Referred to by the earl, in his will, as his 'dear valuable and best friend', Mary was both an executor and legatee of the will, the trusts of which were performed only after a dispute with the earl's brother the Hon. William Hervey, Mary's fellow executor, was resolved in her favour in chancery in 1783. She received the manor and advowson of Evedon, other land in Lincolnshire, and $5000 from the sale of about 186 acres in Suffolk. She also received a share of the stock and furniture at 6 St James's Square and at Ickworth, valued at $7378 12's'. 11died 
Mary Nesbitt's financial and professional acumen was thereafter devoted to enlarging the Norwood estate and to establishing herself on the fringes of political life. She exercised influence and patronage in her salon at Norwood, which was frequented by men such as George Rose, secretary to the Treasury, and young aspirants to political office. Her travels and activities in diplomatic circles on the continent during the French Revolution suggest that she may have been employed as a government agent in Pitt's covert attempts to restore the French monarchy. Celebrating her achievements on 25 September 1797, the 'Morning Chronicle' acknowledged that 'this celebrated woman', despite 'the miscellany of her life', had 'acquired an elevation... which she has preserved with dignity', using 'her influence with the great in favour of the unfortunate' ('Early Married Life of... Lady Stanley', 432-3). In the early nineteenth century straitened financial circumstances occasioned the letting of Norwood House and Mary's frequent residence abroad, in 1821 at Montreuil-sur-Mer, Pas-de-Calais, and in 1822 in Switzerland. She is presumed to have died, aged eighty-two, in Paris, where she was buried on 4 November 1825, and not, as the earl of Bristol had requested in his will, with him at Ickworth.

Yates, John (1755-1826), Unitarian minister, was born in Bolton, Lancashire, the only child of John Yates, schoolmaster. He was educated at the grammar school in Bolton and entered Warrington Academy in 1772. In 1777 he became minister of Kaye Street Chapel, Liverpool; at his ordination on 1 October William Enfield delivered the charge. In 1791 the congregation moved to Paradise Street, where Yates continued to serve until 1823. 
In 1777 Yates married Elizabeth Bostock (1749-1819), the youngest daughter of John Brooks Ashton (1711-1759), a Liverpool merchant, and the widow of John Bostock the elder (1740-1774), a physician in the town; her brother was said to have opposed the match because she might be pauperized, but he later relented and sent his sons to John Yates's school. The wealth that came to Yates with his marriage was expended on their house, Dingle Head, in Toxteth Park, in extensive charity, and in judicious investment in property, which increased the fortune. Five sons and three daughters were born; the eldest son was Joseph Brooks Yates (1780-1855), merchant and antiquary, and the fourth son was James Yates (1789-1871), Unitarian minister and antiquary. 
John Yates published a few sermons and a collection of hymns; in one unpublished sermon, in 1788, he attacked the evils of the slave trade, deeply offending some of his congregation. A fluent pulpit style belied the great pains he took with composition -- he reportedly never preached an old sermon -- although some thought he strained for novelty: one story has it that during a sermon on the wonders of nature, he cried 'Behold the camel!', awaking a sleeping lady who exclaimed 'Where? where?' ('Memorials', 3). He elicited great respect and affection in his congregation and the Liverpool community. Like his friend and neighbouring minister William Shepherd (1768-1847), who had for a time served as tutor to the Yates children, he was active in radical politics and, with other Liverpool worthies, belonged to a literary society that it was thought expedient to dissolve following the younger Pitt's proclamation against sedition in 1792. 
In his family, although he liked jokes, read aloud to his children, and taught them to play cards, Yates was a strict disciplinarian, a possibly inherited trait since a family story tells of his mother's sending a messenger to order him home from school to close a door he had left open ('Memorials', 1-2). Reflecting the awe in which his children held him, a daughter once said that she was certain her father never did anything but from a sense of duty, whereupon her sister-in-law asked if it was also 'from a sense of duty that he married Mrs. Bostock?' (Roberts, 330). His crustiness seems to have increased in his later years when he was lame and in pain from a badly mended leg. 
Yates died on 10 November 1826 at Dingle Head. He was probably buried in the graveyard of the Park Chapel, Toxteth Park; the funeral sermon was preached on 19 November by William Shepherd.

Dale, Harold Edward (1875-1954), civil servant and author, was born at 24 Shadwell Road, Islington, London, on 5 December 1875, the son of Henry James Dale, a 'manufacturing electrician', and his wife, Caroline Harrison. After attending St Paul's School he went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1894, following his elder brother Frank Harry Busbridge Dale (1871-1918) who became chief inspector of elementary schools. At Balliol he gained firsts in both classical moderations (1896) and 'literae humaniores' (1898), and won several prestigious university prizes. In 1898 he was elected to a fellowship at New College which continued until 1905. Meanwhile he had also come first in the civil service examination and in 1898 joined the Colonial Office. As a Colonial Office official he undertook varied assignments -- a mission to British Honduras in 1903-4, one of the British representatives at the Anglo-French conference on the New Hebrides in 1906, assistant secretary to the Imperial Conference of 1909, and Colonial Office representative at the north Atlantic fishing arbitration at The Hague in 1910. On 4 March 1911 Dale married Isabel Woodrow, (1885/6-1950), daughter of Samuel George Warner, actuary, at Balham Congregational Church. 
A change of direction came in 1910 when Dale became secretary to the Development Commission, a body set up in 1909 to encourage rural development, including agricultural research and advisory services. This appointment meant that he eventually transferred to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, where he became in 1917 an acting assistant secretary. In 1919 he received a permanent appointment and was made CB. After moving to agriculture Dale undertook tasks which again took him abroad, in 1920 to Fiji to initiate a reorganization of the civil service in that area, and in 1923-4 to Jamaica as financial commissioner. In 1927 he was promoted to principal assistant secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, from which he retired in 1935. A few years later he left London to live in Blewbury, Berkshire. Shortly before the death in 1950 of his wife he moved to Oxford, living at Norham End, Norham Gardens. He died, at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 30 July 1954. 
Dale was a man of outstanding intellectual ability and highly regarded in the civil service. That he did not reach the highest levels may in part have been due both to his lifelong dedication to varied scholarly interests and to his natural shyness. He regularly published reviews and articles on classical subjects, and only a year before he died a fourth edition of Jowett's translation of the 'Dialogues' of Plato came out, jointly edited by Dale and D. J. Allan, a fellow of Balliol. Dale also wrote on agricultural topics, but is best remembered for what he wrote on the civil service after retirement. 'The Higher Civil Service of Great Britain' was written as the Second World War approached and published by Oxford University Press in 1941. It contains a detailed and well-informed account of the small group to which he had belonged, and which in those days occupied a predominant position in the immediate support of ministers in the formulation of policy, the preparation of legislation, and the general administration of the country. His calm and thorough treatment of his subject is enlivened by shrewd judgements on men and affairs, and by a certain dry wit sharpened by his own official experiences. The text is generously adorned with quotations in Latin and Greek, with no translations offered. 
In 1943 Dale gave the Sidney Ball lecture in Oxford, published in the same year as a Barnett House paper under the title 'The Personnel and Problems of the Higher Civil Service'. Essentially this offers a summary of some features of the earlier book. He also contributed a chapter on parliament and the civil service to a book entitled 'Parliament: a Survey', published in 1952. His work stands at the beginning of a lively tradition of descriptive and critical writing about the civil service and its place in the British parliamentary system. He provided a model for subsequent academic scholars and for one or two from the service itself, notably C. H. Sisson. But within two decades of his death the scholar-administrator so impressively exemplified by Dale had become virtually extinct.

Meldrum, Thomas (c.1605-1693), army officer in the Danish service, was born in Scotland about 1605. There is very little information on his early life and indeed confusion surrounds his early military career. Danish archival sources refer to a Thomas Meldrum in service at a time when Denmark was involved in the Thirty Years' War (1625-9). However, there is disagreement about his rank and the regiment in which he served. A Thomas Meldrum joined the Sjaelland knight's regiment on 1 August 1627 as a private and departed from Danish-Norwegian service on 12 June 1628 (Lind database). There was also a Captain Thomas Meldrum in command of a company of the Sjaelland national foot by February 1628, who departed from Danish service in June 1629 (Riis, 2.115). It is not implausible that these are the same man, given the chaotic state of the Danish army during this period. 
In 1629 Denmark-Norway signed the treaty of Lubeck and withdrew from the war against the Habsburg empire. Many Scottish officers and soldiers then transferred from the army of Christian IV to serve in the Swedish army of Gustav II Adolf. It appears that Thomas Meldrum was one of these men. Certainly a Captain Thomas Meldrum fought for the Swedish army in Germany as a member of Alexander Cunningham's Scottish infantry regiment in 1632. This is the same man who re-enlisted into Danish service for their wars against Sweden between 1657 and 1660. 
From this point on, Meldrum's military service can be traced more easily. He re-entered the Danish service from that of Brandenburg in January 1657. Meldrum initially served as a captain in the infantry regiment of the Scot Major-General John Henderson. He did not stay with the unit long, which allowed him to avoid capture when Henderson surrendered the garrison of Hindsgavl in January 1658. Meldrum temporarily became a dragoon captain in October 1657, departing from his usual capacity as an infantry officer. He later returned to foot service when he served as a captain of the students' regiment during the siege of Copenhagen in April 1658. Meldrum served as a captain in Krag's infantry regiment in 1659 and remained an infantry captain until 1663. Some time after 1670 he gained his promotion to lieutenant-colonel of infantry stationed in Copenhagen. 
War broke out between Denmark-Norway and Sweden in 1675 as the Danes sought to recover their former territories east of the Sound. The treaty of Copenhagen had ceded these to the Swedes in 1660. Meldrum took an active part in the Danish campaign and earned the titles commander and full colonel at the battle of Lund. By 1677 he was vice-commander of the newly captured Swedish town of Landskrona, and later military governor of the castle. It was from this strategic position commanded by Meldrum that Christian V conducted his devastating campaign against Swedish Skane. Yet despite Danish success in the campaign the French brokered the peace of Lund in 1679, which ensured that Sweden retained the former Danish provinces. Thereafter Meldrum returned to Denmark, where he remained on active military service. In 1684 he was promoted brigadier. Thomas Meldrum died with the rank of general in 1693, aged about 88. In a career which spanned nearly sixty years he had risen from a common soldier to a respected commander.

Cunningham, John (c.1575-1651), naval officer in the Danish service, was born at Barns, near Crail, Fife, the second son of Alexander Cunningham, laird of West Barns and Gallowside, and his wife, Christiane Wood. Cunningham's early years remain obscure. Before reaching Denmark he is supposed to have travelled throughout Europe and gained experience at sea. He was probably enlisted by the Danes for his knowledge of the Arctic waters. James VI of Scotland recommended Cunningham to his brother-in-law Christian IV (1577-1648), and from 1603 Cunningham was active as a sea captain in the Danish-Norwegian navy. During the next fifteen years he played an important part in the implementation of Christian's foreign policy. 
In May 1605 Christian IV dispatched three ships, commanded by Cunningham, to re-establish links with Greenland and to recover the lost Scandinavian colonies. Cunningham returned to Copenhagen in August 1605 with valuable cartographical data and minerals. He and his men kidnapped some Greenland Inuit, whom they brought back to Denmark as samples of the native population; they were put on display in Copenhagen as exotic creatures from the far north. The expedition was regarded as a success and it has ever since been looked upon as the rediscovery of Greenland. A larger expedition, with Cunningham as captain of the 'Lion', was sent to Greenland in 1606 in the hope of finding silver ore. Cunningham and his crew were also instructed to map the coast of Greenland and investigate opportunities for trade. This expedition approached the shore of Labrador and sailed almost to the mouth of Cumberland Sound before returning to Denmark in October. 
On 9 March 1607, in Helsingor (Elsinore), Cunningham married a Danish woman, of whom no details are known. He married again, at Bodogaard, Nordland, Norway, on 4 September 1625; his second wife was the widowed Danish peer, Ellen Clausdatter Hundermark (died 1633). There were no children from either marriage but with his mistress, a woman from Bergen who died in 1674, Cunningham had a son, Jakob Hansen Cunningham (1619-1686), and a daughter, Kirsten Hansdatter ('c'.1620-1699). In his capacity as commander he participated in a number of expeditions to the northern regions; their aim was to ensure Christian IV's dominion of the northern seas and to discourage pirates, buccaneers, and others from trespassing illegally on the king's seas. During the Kalmar War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden (1611-13) Cunningham engaged in sorties against Swedish strongholds in the Baltic Sea. Jon Olafsson, an Icelandic sailor and a rifleman who sailed with Cunningham in 1616, described him as a strange and peculiar kind of person, especially when intoxicated. 
For his outstanding naval service in coastal waters Cunningham was granted a post as district governor of Vardohus and Finnmark. With its unprotected eastern borders facing Russia and Sweden, Finnmark was the northernmost outpost of the dual monarchy. Here Cunningham ruled for thirty-two years, an unusually long tenure for a local official. His efforts are all the more remarkable in that his period as district governor coincided with great hardships and reports of famine among the populace. His paternalistic care for his subordinates and his true concern for them was resented by the merchants, whose complaints to the king changed nothing. 
The rapidly expanding integration into the Danish-Norwegian realm of the native Sami people led to enormous challenges to rule in Finnmark. The struggle to obtain fishing privileges in the bounteous salmon rivers at Tana and Alta was also a part of this picture. Cunningham managed these concessions and, as a result, clashed with the common laws of the Sami when he began leasing the same concessions to Danish, Dutch, and Norwegian trading companies in 1629. Legal persecutions and severe sentences were used against rebellious Sami during the 1630s. Another of Cunningham's tasks was to ensure that ships from the British Isles, the Netherlands, and other seafaring nations did not venture into the king's waters without permission in their desire to take part in the lucrative trade with north-west Russia and the northern whale fishery, which were expanding rapidly during the first half of the seventeenth century. 
Cunningham was sometimes present during the court proceedings of Finnmark's many brutal witch trials. Some fifty-two cases have been documented from his period as district governor, most of which were raised against alleged witches who were sentenced to death at the stake. Although there were suggestions that witchcraft had been used against Cunningham on one occasion and against his servants he does not appear to have been a driving force in these persecutions, and he was present at few of the trials. Cunningham died at Gerdrup, an estate in Danish Sjaelland, and was buried at Eggeslevmagle church on 9 December 1651.

Anstruther, Sir Robert (1578-1644/5?), diplomat and politician, was the second son of Sir James Anstruther (died 1606), fiar of Anstruther, and Jean Scott of Abbotshall. His birth in Anstruther Wester, Fife, was recorded by his father on 23 April 1578. A graduate of St Salvator's College, at the University of St Andrews, Anstruther was partly educated at the Danish court, where he served as a page from 1598. In 1603 he carried falcons to Scotland as a gift from Christian IV to James VI. From 1606 Anstruther served in Danish service as an agent of the Stuart court -- he is mentioned in 1612 as 'famulis communis' of the two kings. In 1612-13 he mediated the Knared peace treaty between the Scandinavian countries with his grandfather's stepson, Sir James Spens of Wormiston. It was for this service that he received his knighthood, although from which king (Stuart or Oldenburg) is not clear. Early in 1614 James VI and I had been asked by Christian IV to arbitrate in his dispute with the city of Lubeck. During his embassy in 1615 Anstruther continued the mediation begun promisingly by Sir Andrew Sinclair, and once more proved influential in resolving Christian's disputes peacefully. On 22 April 1617 he married Mary Swift, daughter of Sir Robert Swift, of Doncaster, Yorkshire, with whom he had three sons, Robert ('b'. 'c'. 1629), Philip (died 1702), and Christian (who died in infancy), and two daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah ('bap'. 1644). 
When tensions in Bohemia flared in 1618 Anstruther travelled to Denmark and Germany as the main negotiator of James VI and I. Peace proving elusive, he returned to Denmark in April 1620 to raise money for the elector palatine's cause. Christian IV was so pleased with him that on one celebrated evening he resigned to him the Danish crown, with which Anstruther was invested for the duration of the feast. On a business level Anstruther negotiated with Christian for a loan of $100,000, and by 1621 this sum was costing King James $6000 per annum in interest payments alone. That same year Anstruther travelled to the United Provinces to give Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia $20,000 compensation for her lost household goods. He also spoke to the states council seeking arms for a military campaign in Bohemia. James also sent Anstruther to the Segeberg conference to seek a military alliance between Denmark-Norway, Great Britain, and the United Provinces, a mission which resulted in the Hague alliance of November 1621. 
The following year Anstruther, now mentioned as a gentleman of the privy chamber of King James, could be found in the English parliament translating the speech of the imperial ambassador, Count Schwarzenberg, for King James. After many more rounds of discussion, in 1624 Anstruther set out to negotiate with Christian IV, Gustavus Adolphus, John George of Saxony, and the Lower Saxon circle. By February 1625 Swedish plans were rejected and James accepted Christian IV's terms. Anstruther continued as ambassador to Denmark-Norway after the coronation of Charles I. He delivered $46,000 to Christian IV in June 1625 and included the first of his embassies to the Holy Roman emperor, Ferdinand II, between September and October 1625. This embassy also included a visit to the palatine court at The Hague. He thereafter undertook continual diplomatic missions in Denmark-Norway, Sweden, and Germany between 1625 and 1629. After the treaty of Lubeck in 1629 he left Christian IV's court and travelled to Hamburg from where he conducted much of his remaining 'Danish' residency, writing to Sir Thomas Roe the following spring that unless directed by Charles I or personally summoned by Christian IV he had no intention of visiting the Danish king. Yet Anstruther would not tolerate any slander of Christian IV. Roe sought to discredit Christian owing to the Lubeck agreement with Ferdinand II, but Anstruther steadfastly defended Christian's integrity. None the less, Charles I felt it was time for Anstruther to undertake new missions. 
In August 1630 Anstruther set out to the diet of Regensburg. Ferdinand II received Anstruther with 'great honour and courtesy' though ultimately, the diet dissolved in November, achieving little. Anstruther related to Roe the futility of the diet, which he described as an exercise in protecting electoral dignity. Despite his reluctance he returned to the imperial diet, now relocated to Vienna, where he gained another audience with Ferdinand II, on 15 June 1631. He found that the negotiating parties approached the diet from such opposing positions that he could see little scope for solutions. Anstruther returned to his Scandinavian duties, arguing that to remain would be detrimental to the house of Stuart. 
In December 1631 an agent of the duke of Bavaria arrived in London accusing Anstruther of being a 'violent partisan' of the king of Sweden and for that reason not suitable to enjoy any intimacy at the imperial court. Anstruther returned to London where he convinced Charles I of Ferdinand II's false intentions. On hearing Anstruther's account Charles declared that 'he would to God he was served thus by all his ministers'. After visiting London, Anstruther returned to Hamburg, 'en route' visiting The Hague to discuss new proposals offered by Charles I. These centred on trying to get the duke of Bavaria elected as Holy Roman emperor, which would have separated him from the Austrian camp. Undaunted by Dutch reservations Anstruther attended the diet of allied princes at Heilbronn, where he revealed his instructions to offer up to $10,000 per month to the new alliance. He also travelled several times to the Danish court. Despite the disastrous recent visit of the earl of Leicester, Anstruther managed to bring the Danes closer to the Stuart position than they had been since Lubeck. He continued pressing for ratification of the disputed Hague treaty of 1625, and Christian IV eventually conceded the need for a new confederacy. Anstruther travelled to the diet of protestant princes in 1633 accompanied by the Scottish cleric John Durie. He continued to negotiate in Germany until April 1635 during which time he joined the intellectual German society Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft, where he was given the name Der Fleissige (the diligent) for his diplomatic endeavours in Europe. But European diplomacy frequently fell behind events. By 1634 most of the Palatinate had been occupied by the French, which placed pressure on Ferdinand II to find solutions to his growing problems in Germany. Any glimmer of hope for Anstruther's negotiations was upset by the peace of Prague in 1635, which undermined Stuart credibility in Germany. 
In 1638 it was decided to resolve finally differences between Christian IV and Charles I. These talks were scheduled to take place in Hamburg. Anstruther was again selected to represent Great Britain, though he turned the appointment down. His refusal to accept the appointment perhaps centred on political developments in Scotland; indeed, one of the rare mentions of Anstruther as a Scot in diplomatic dispatches appeared in April 1638 in a letter largely concerned with the background and progress of the Scottish covenanting movement. By May an unfounded rumour circulated that Anstruther had been dismissed rather than having stood down himself. Whatever his motivation, Anstruther declined the mission and Roe was appointed instead. Anstruther correctly predicted that the negotiations would come to naught and, as Roe found to his cost, negotiating for the Stuarts could prove both futile and frustrating. None the less, in 1641 Anstruther returned to Denmark to negotiate for the house of Stuart and in 1644 acted as the Danish envoy both to Charles I and to the English parliament. That he did so is interesting, not least as he was a signatory to the solemn league and covenant in 1643. 
In a letter to Henry Vane of 31 May 1634 Anstruther indicated that he was then in his fifty-sixth year. Two years later he purchased the estate of Wheatley, Doncaster, which had previously been in the possession of his brother-in-law, Barnham Swift, Viscount Carlingford. When Anstruther died, probably in 1644 or 1645, after a lifetime as one of the Stuarts' most important diplomats, his eldest son, Robert, succeeded to Wheatley while Philip succeeded his uncle in his Scottish estates in Fife. Philip was knighted by Charles II at Scone and was eventually captured at the battle of Worcester.

Cunningham, David (c.1540-1600), bishop of Aberdeen, is of uncertain parentage -- his father may have been William Cunningham of Cunninghamhead. Although the identification cannot be taken as certain, he was probably the David Cunningham who was incorporated in St Leonard's College, St Andrews, by 25 March 1557, and who graduated MA between 23 November 1560 and 6 November 1562 -- most probably in 1561. These dates suggest that he was born about 1540. There is no doubt that he studied in France, first in Paris, and then at Bourges, where he read civil law. He clearly found no difficulty in accepting protestantism, for by 1562 he had become minister of Lanark. Under a contract of 20 December 1569 he married Katherine Wallace. In November 1570 he was transferred to the parish of Lesmahagow, and two years later to that of Cadder. In 1573 he was mentioned as minister of Monkland, and in 1574 he was also in charge of Lenzie. 
In 1573 the general assembly elected Cunningham to the committee that formulated instructions for the assembly's commissioners in their forthcoming negotiations with the regent and the privy council concerning the remuneration of ministers. Two years later the assembly nominated Cunningham and three others to review the election of George Douglas as bishop of Moray, and in 1576 he was appointed to a committee to investigate the state of the kirk in Ayrshire, Clydesdale, and Lennox. The committee's report was drafted by Cunningham, who in that same year was also elected to a committee chosen to prepare the assembly's answers to questions from the government. In the meantime Cunningham was also one of several ministers who helped Andrew Melville with preparing the second 'Book of Discipline'. Melville had introduced reforms at Glasgow University from 1574, and probably facilitated Cunningham's translation to Glasgow, where in 1576 he was dean of the faculty of arts and subdean in the cathedral. The government appointed him in 1584 to perform the principal's duties, until the position was filled by Patrick Sharp at the beginning of 1586. 
In 1576 Patrick Adamson, minister of Paisley and Regent Morton's chaplain, accepted the archiepiscopal see of St Andrews. Cunningham succeeded him as chaplain to Morton's household, but did not keep that position for long, since on 5 October 1577 he was appointed to the see of Aberdeen; he was consecrated on 11 November. In the same year he became chancellor of King's College, Aberdeen, a post which he held until his death. As well as his bishopric he had the charge of Aberdeen East parish, which in 1596 he exchanged for St Nicholas's parish; this too he held until he died. His acceptance of Aberdeen did not at first estrange Cunningham from a general assembly that was becoming increasingly hostile to bishops, possibly because it hoped to use him as a means of access to the regent. But Morton's fall in 1580 and his execution in 1581 saw Cunningham reduced to hiding in the west in abject poverty, a fate which Andrew Melville's nephew James saw as God's punishment of Cunningham's apostasy from the 'guid cause' by becoming a bishop. 
Cunningham's relations with the general assembly were commonly strained thereafter. The assembly increasingly saw itself as the supreme authority in the kirk, and could not therefore accept the appointment of bishops by the government. It raised the issue in 1580, 1582, and 1583, though without conclusion. Then in 1586 it accused Cunningham of adultery with one Elizabeth Sutherland. The loss of the assembly's records makes it impossible to know whether the charge was politically inspired, but in the following year James VI (though not the assembly itself) found that he had been sufficiently cleared of the slander. In 1585 Cunningham founded a grammar school at Banff, but his effectiveness as bishop was probably limited by the poverty to which his predecessor had reduced his see. He became a trusted servant of King James, however, and baptized Prince Henry at Stirling on 30 August 1594. In the winter of 1596-7 he took part in the negotiations which eventually led to the reconciliation of the Catholic earl of Huntly with the government, and in 1598 he was sent with Peter Young on an embassy to Denmark and northern Germany in order to gain support for James VI's claim to the English throne. 
Cunningham died in Aberdeen on 3 August 1600, leaving assets valued at $3052 Scots. He had no children. He was survived by his wife, who two years later married Robert Udny of Tillicortrie, second son of William Udny of that ilk.

Sinclair, Andrew (1555-1625), army officer and diplomat in the Danish service, was born in Ravenscraig, Scotland, the third son of Henry Sinclair, fifth Lord St Clair (1527-1601), and his first consort, Janet (died 15 April 1569), daughter of Patrick Lindsay, Lord Lindsay of the Byres. A Scottish nobleman, he was educated in the household of the duc de Guise. In 1591 he became a gentleman of the Danish court under King Christian IV and eventually settled in Denmark, where he was known as Anders Sinklar. He accompanied Christian to Germany in 1597, and acted as a gentleman of the bedchamber to Queen Anna Katrine until he retired from court service in 1600. In that year he married Kirsten (died 1632/3), daughter of Erik Kaas (died 1578) and Kirsten Pederrsdatter Galt (1536-1616). They had several children: Henrik, who died as a child, Jacob, Christian, Johanne, Erik, and Christine (mentioned in 1623). Christian IV became godfather to one of their sons in 1607. 
Through marriage, Sinclair became 'lensman' ('regional governor') of Gladsax, in which capacity he worked until 1620. During his subsequent career, he also acted as 'lensman' of Landskrone (1619-21), and of Hammershus with Bornholm (1621-5). During the Danish-Swedish Kalmar War of 1611-13 Sinclair served the Danish-Norwegian army as a captain. After participating in the conquest of Oland in 1611, he became the commandant of Kalmar on its capture from Sweden. By 1615 he had been appointed colonel of the Skane regiment, and by 1622 was commander of the entire Danish-Norwegian army east of the Baltic Sound. He was ennobled in Denmark in 1616, and was further rewarded in 1617 when he was appointed a member of the Danish 'rigsrad' (the state council) at the age of sixty-two. Throughout his career he maintained his links with Scotland, travelling with Princess Anna's ambassador to Scotland in October 1589 to participate in her marriage negotiations with James VI. He joined the Danish embassy to Scotland in summer 1594. He proved to be a useful negotiator, uniquely equipped with a familiar knowledge of both Scottish and Danish language and society. After 1603 he acted on seven occasions as the Danish-Norwegian envoy to the Stuart court (1604, 1606, 1612, 1614, 1618, 1619, and 1621). 
Early in 1614 James VI and I was asked by Christian IV to arbitrate in his dispute with Lubeck. Sinclair achieved a short-term settlement in the dispute, which was followed up by Sir Robert Anstruther's embassy in 1615. James's diplomatic intervention on behalf of Denmark-Norway once more proved influential with Christian in resolving the issues peacefully. When negotiations between Denmark and Sweden were held at Ulvsback in 1619 Sinclair was present and met the Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus. With the outbreak of the Bohemian war in 1618, the peaceful policies of James VI and I finally faltered. He relied heavily on Sir Robert Anstruther in Denmark to gain Christian IV's support for his schemes to end the war. Christian in turn sent Sinclair, with Frederick Gunther, to the Stuart court in 1621. Christian sought to build up an evangelical military alliance in northern Europe, comprising Denmark-Norway, the German protestant princes of the lower Saxon circle, the British kingdoms under James VI and I, and any of the free German cities that could be persuaded to join in. Sinclair received instructions to persuade King James to take part in order to resist perceived Habsburg aggression in northern Europe. For his part, James believed that he could find a more appropriate diplomatic solution. Sinclair conducted no further missions to Britain for Christian IV, but continued in his other military and diplomatic capacities until his death at Sinklarsholm, Skane, Denmark, in 1625.

Dunbar, Patrick (1598-1646), army officer in the Danish service, was born at Cumnoch, Moray, the son of Patrick Dunbar of Cumnoch, justice of Moray, and his wife, Maria Weyer. Such was the parentage ascribed to him in his funeral sermon, though it has not been possible to confirm these claims from Scottish sources. In all essentials his coat of arms is the same as that belonging to the Dunbars of Mochrum. Dunbar attended Marischal College, Aberdeen, and King's College, Aberdeen, and later stayed with his kinsman Thomas Hamilton, earl of Melrose (later of Haddington), secretary of state in Scotland and president and later lord privy seal in Scotland for Charles I. 
Dunbar entered Danish service in 1625 as an ensign in the company under Sir Patrick Mackay of Lairg, in the regiment levied by Sir Donald Mackay. With four companies of 800 men Dunbar defended successfully Boizenburg on the Elbe against Tilly's army of 10,000 men, at the end of July 1627, and in 1628 was sent to Stralsund to relieve the besieged city. Here he was wounded in action, and when the regiment was reformed in the same year his company was disbanded. He must have chosen to remain in Denmark, as he did not transfer with the regiment to Swedish service in the summer of 1629. Dunbar had taken over a company in Scania as a captain in 1628 and on 2 April 1631 he was appointed a major of Scanian conscript peasants, giving him a part in creating a national Danish army (conscription had been introduced only in 1614). By the time he asked for leave to go to Scotland two years later, he held the rank of 'overvagtmester' of a regiment of foot, which could indicate that he had been assigned to another unit. If he went to Scotland, Dunbar must have returned to Denmark in the following year, as on 24 September 1634 he was reappointed major with effect from the previous 1 May. 
Dunbar married on 3 September 1637 at Sonderskov, Jutland, Maren Munk (died 1652), daughter of Frands Nielsen Munk of Ors (died by 1625) and his wife, Mette Thomesdatter Orning (who was still alive at the time of the marriage). Dunbar's marriage into a noble family made his naturalization on 4 May 1638 possible, and at the same time his noble birth was recognized, which enabled him to own land in Denmark. He acquired the manor of Spannarp in north-west Scania; no noble title was linked to the manor, despite the assertions of older literature. Dunbar's concern about the arrangement of his parish church of Ausas in May 1641 may indicate that he held the patronage of it as owner of Spannarp. 
As major of a Scanian regiment from 1 May 1641, Dunbar was to have commanded a company of conscripts from Halland, but he exchanged the position for another -- with conscripts from the 'len' (administrative district) of Helsingborg. His own manor, Spannarp, was situated there, which appears to have influenced this arrangement. He was appointed commander 'ad interim' of Halmstad Castle on 20 August 1641 and of Christianopel Castle on 16 May 1642. Both castles were of strategic significance in the event of war with Sweden: Halmstad Castle commanded the end of one of the most important roads, which, following the River Nissan, led from the Kattegat coast to Jonkoping on Lake Vattern. Christianopel had been built as a fortress town close to the Danish-Swedish frontier and commanded the southern entrance to Kalmar Sound. As support for naval operations in this region, Christianopel was important. During Torstensson's War (named after the Swedish commander-in-chief) between Denmark and Sweden in 1643-5, Dunbar was garrisoned with his company at Halmstad from new year 1644 until the following October. He was then to be found in the camp by Malmo and in Zealand, before he was again garrisoned with two companies at Halmstad until the end of the war. On 12 December 1644 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Falk Lykke's Scanian regiment, but he retired from service at the end of the war. Dunbar died on 7 February 1646 at Spannarp and was buried in the church of Ausas, South Asbo, Scania. 
Dunbar has sometimes been confused with his namesake, Patrick Dunbar, who on 11 November 1657 married Elisabeth Grubbe at Elsinore (Elisabeth was buried at St Mary's, Elsinore, on 15 December 1658). Patrick Dunbar also appears to have fought in Torstensson's War, as his company was disbanded in 1645; from 1657 to 1661 he was a major in Nadelwitz's (later Munchhausen's) infantry regiment of mercenaries in Danish service. Captured by the Swedes at Elsinore in 1658, Patrick Dunbar had to remain in captivity for eighteen months, and in 1661 he appears to have left Denmark, having asked for a passport and for settlement of his accounts.

Seton, Alexander (fl. 1626-1649), army officer in the Danish and Norwegian services, is of uncertain origins. Family historians have identified him variously as Alexander Seton of Lathrisk and as the son of George Seton of Cariston (1554?-1620) and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir John Aytoun of that ilk, but the case for the former is inconclusive, while the latter is no more than a hypothesis. Nor is it known whether Seton married. 
On 8 April 1626 Seton was appointed captain of a company of 500 English foot in Denmark, the same day that the king of Denmark wrote to Charles I asking him to authorize the recruiting of 1000 men by Seton and Francis Hammond. The Scottish privy council authorized Seton to levy 500 men in Scotland on 30 June. By 24 August he was in command of a 'frifoennike' (a unit attached to no regiment) as captain. His activities in the autumn of 1626 are not known, but on 28 February 1627 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. Probably his unit was to become part of a new regiment with himself as second-in-command. 
Seton was wounded in the action at Oldenburg Pass, in the duchy of Holstein, in September 1627, when the Danish forces tried to cover the embarkation of the forces of Bernard of Saxe-Weimar from the superior numbers of the general of the Catholic League, Tilly. Seton joined Sir Donald Mackay's regiment either in the autumn of 1627 or in 1628. Since his company had been ruined by heavy losses he asked about this time for 3000 rixdollars to levy a company of 500 men. He appears to have fought with the regiment at Stralsund in the summer of 1628, when Denmark's Scottish veterans played a major part in breaking the imperial siege of the Hanseatic port. Not wishing to transfer to Swedish service with the regiment when it was reformed in the autumn of 1628, Seton sold the commission for his company to his former lieutenant, Andrew Stuart, and left with the rank of colonel (his reckoning dated 4 October). 
Seton seems to have transferred to the Norwegian army, where he is mentioned as a captain of foot in 1628. However, no more is known of his activities until 1645, when he held the rank of colonel in the Norwegian army and navy. In that year he is known to have commanded a squadron of dragoons between May and September, and to have been appointed admiral of a force of eight ships. He is last certainly known of listed as a colonel in Norwegian service on 19 April 1649.

Barclay, William (1603-1676), army officer in the Swedish service, was born in Siggot, Scotland. Although he was the son of the laird of Siggot, his parents' identity remains unknown beyond that. He entered Swedish military service some time during the Thirty Years' War (the exact date is unclear) and earned promotion to the rank of colonel. In 1646 he was listed as the colonel and chief of a cavalry squadron from Varmland and Dalarna. 
Barclay may have returned to Scotland in 1642 for a short visit, and this was also when he first became involved in a lengthy battle to get a debt settled by the Swedish government. Barclay was to feature in a series of disputes after this, none of which harmed his standing in Swedish society. The following year a land donation was authorized for him and in 1645 the Riksrad (Swedish state council) ordered that Barclay's debt be settled. In 1645 he married Margareta Becker, the widow of another Scot in Swedish service, Patrick Kinnemond, who had been ennobled posthumously. They had four sons and one daughter. Soon Barclay found himself again in trouble with the Swedish authorities. He was convicted by a Swedish war tribunal of excessive plundering during the German campaigns and lost his colonelcy in 1648 as a result. However, this did not prove an obstacle to his ennoblement that same year. Barclay then served as major of the city militia in Stockholm in 1652 and actively sought admission to the house of nobility. Queen Kristina yielded to his entreaties by formally introducing him into the house in 1654, but she denied his requests for further land donations. Barclay's continued social power was again demonstrated two years later when the Stockholm town council chose him in preference to another officer for promotion to city colonel. Later that year he was also chosen to receive Queen Kristina as a city representative when she returned from Prussia. Before long Barclay became embroiled once more in a conflict with the Riksrad, on this occasion over a dispute with the master of court, whom he blamed for not undertaking his duties properly; and in the following year, Barclay, always controversial, upset the chief governor of Stockholm by raising a matter with the military college without discussing it first with the governor. 
For all his various altercations, Barclay overcame these setbacks and remained in royal favour, being appointed a commissioner for conscription for the Swedish army in 1657. Later that year he was involved in yet another quarrel, this one between Stockholm's military defence corps and the burgesses of the city. Like many officers of the time, Barclay continued to seek his overdue wages. Although he was receiving at least 500 Swedish riksdaler a year from Stockholm city (another source gives the figure as 750 daler) his royal wages for earlier military service had still not been paid, and Barclay threatened resignation from the army unless they were. The situation was resolved by 1665 as he was then promoted major-general. Barclay died in Stockholm in 1676, but it appears that his estates were not passed on to his sons.

Tanner, Sir Henry (1849-1935), architect, was born in St Pancras, London, in 1849 and baptized there on 14 December 1849 the son of Robert Tanner ('fl'. 'c'.1820-1853), master carpenter, and his wife, Elizabeth Selby ('b'. 'c'.1820, died after 1891). He attended the Royal Academy Schools, and obtained practical experience on building sites in Wiltshire and Surrey before entering the architectural office of Anthony Salvin. He also attended the Architectural Association's classes, winning a sessional prize for the best series of papers on construction. In March 1871 he was appointed by competitive examination as clerk in the country district B (post and telegraph services) of HM office of works on a salary of $100 p.a. 'Diligent, intelligent and thoroughly conversant with the duties of his profession' (TNA: PRO, WORK 22/9/7, fol. 11), he was promoted first assistant in April 1873 at $210 p.a. He was twice married: in 1872 to Lucy (1848-1889), daughter of William Gardner, with whom he had five sons and three daughters; and in 1894 to Emily Sophia, daughter of Josiah Leal. 
In 1877 Tanner moved across to the London district of the office of works under John Taylor. The department's ever growing workload brought his promotion in 1882 to surveyor, second class, stationed at Leeds. In August 1884 he returned to London as first-class surveyor on an increased salary of $800 p.a., with general responsibility for the post and telegraph services. Tanner reorganized his sector on a more systematic basis, with more regular and local supervision, achieving large reductions in maintenance costs. Applying for fellowship of the RIBA in 1891, Tanner stated that he had designed the York probate registry and post offices at York (1885; his first major postal building), Bradford, Halifax, Liverpool, Barrow in Furness, Leicester, Birmingham, and many other towns, as well as major Post Office buildings in London -- which included the savings bank in Carter Lane (1890-94). His designs were often in a classical style, frequently of French Renaissance derivation, but sometimes in a formal Tudor or Jacobean. In 1892 he was engaged on designs for new post offices at Liverpool, Nottingham, and Cardiff. There was also much extending and remodelling of existing buildings. On the completion of the 'commodious and imposing' General Post Office (north), St Martin's-le-Grand, London (cost $220,000), the postmaster-general praised its design and arrangement as 'admirably adapted to the requirements of the Public Service' (TNA: PRO, WORK 22/9/7, fol. 44, 14 Nov 1895). 
When Sir John Taylor retired in 1898, Tanner succeeded as principal surveyor of the office of works ($1200 p.a.), responsible for final approval of all major designs before they were submitted to the minister. He undertook the vast Post Office Savings Bank at Hammersmith (1899-1903) and the massive Jacobean Land Registry (1900-06) in Lincoln's Inn Fields. For his realization that 'a building should be designed for the work for which it is intended' he was regarded as 'a first-rate planner' ('RIBA Journal', 3rd ser., 18, 1910-11, 170). Taylor remained however as consultant architect -- not altogether to Tanner's delight -- for the great wave of building new public offices, work initially allotted to private architects by competition. But Brydon, architect of the Great George Street offices (now the Treasury), died in 1901, his plans just completed: Tanner executed them, effecting drastic economies; his primary contribution was structural, employing steel framing, but he made some changes in the external design; he also executed the St James's Park extension in 1908-15, introducing further modern construction methods. At the same time he designed and executed the west extension (1908-12) of the law courts in the Strand, a work closely in sympathy with G. E. Street's adjoining main block. By 1910 the department's work had so increased that Tanner was almost breaking down under the burden; additional staff enabled him to concentrate on supervising design. 
Tanner's interest in construction made him quick to appreciate the merits of reinforced-concrete framing. In 1907 he chaired a major committee on reinforced concrete, declaring that 'reinforced concrete would have to be used' ('RIBA Journal', 3rd ser., 12, 1904-5, 503). As the office of works was free of the building controls hindering use of the new technique, he seized on its economies of space and money for his crowning achievement, the King Edward Building of the General Post Office (1907-10; $323,000), 'the largest Post Office in the world... [and] the largest building... carried out in ferro-concrete' (ibid., 172). Employing Hennebique's patented system which provided shear reinforcement in concrete beams, thereby establishing full reinforced-concrete framing for buildings, he saved $60,000 compared with a steel-frame construction. Tanner's lead was 'of great value' ('The Builder', 1160), though the short street facades were of stone, and the constructional framework was expressed only in the loading bay. Tanner served as president of the Concrete Institute, and was a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers that developed from it; he was also sometime chairman of the Royal Sanitary Institute. 
Tanner had been elected an associate of the RIBA in 1876 and a fellow in 1891. He won the RIBA's Tate prize for a classical architectural design in 1878, and throughout his career stressed his design role; in 1901 his title was changed from 'principal surveyor' to 'principal architect and surveyor' as more accurate terminology. But although he received gratuities at the rate of about three-quarters of one per cent on major new works, rewards were much greater in private practice. He was knighted in 1904. After retiring from the office of works at the end of 1913 (though he continued to supervise the Great George Street offices), this indefatigable man joined his son's architectural firm, which he attended daily until his death. 
Frank-looking, with upturned nose, Tanner wore a full but trimmed beard and moustache; he was known for his extraordinary memory. He died on the doorstep of his house, 31 Rosslyn Hill, Hampstead, London, 'when returning home from business' on 2 September 1935 ('The Times', 4 Sept 1935), and was buried three days later at Elmers End cemetery, Beckenham, Kent, near his home of the 1880s and 1890s. He left an estate valued at under $14,000. He was survived by his widow and his eldest son, Henry (1876-1947). Assisted by his brothers Hugh and Edwin, and, as mentioned above, by his father from 1914, the younger Henry Tanner maintained an important commercial architectural practice, including large blocks in Regent Street (Sir Henry had served on the Plymouth committee of 1913 to determine their general character), hotels for John Lyons & Co., Park Lane Hotel (1928; attributed to Sir Henry), and National House in Moorgate.

Bordon, John (fl. 1624-1659), army officer in the Swedish service, was born in Scotland. He was a descendant of the Scottish house of Burdon of Feddall or Pitfoddell, but his parents' identity remains uncertain. Bordon, like many Scotsmen at the time, entered Swedish military service during campaigns of the Thirty Years' War in Germany, serving in James MacDougal's regiment from 1629 to 1630 and as a lieutenant in Donald Mackay's regiment in 1632. Information is lacking on his whereabouts for the following ten years. It is unclear to whom and when Bordon was married, not least because Swedish sources have often confused him with Colonel John Gordon. He is known to have had three sons and one daughter, and two of his sons, Gustaf and Johan, also entered Swedish military service. Moreover Bordon had obviously become well-integrated in Sweden as in 1643 he was ennobled and introduced to the Swedish house of nobility. 
During the Swedo-Danish War, which ended in 1645, Bordon served as the commandant of the Hammerhus garrison on Bornholm. The following year he became a lieutenant-colonel of a conscripted Dalregiment. In 1651 he became a full colonel of the same regiment; he retained this rank until his retirement. Bordon played a major role in the defence of Sweden during its wars with Denmark-Norway and Russia. In 1657 he helped defend the Swedish copper supply from Danish-Norwegian attack, thereby ensuring continued Swedish trade and finances. In the following year Bordon's regiment in Riga served under Field Marshal Robert Douglas's command during Sweden's war with Russia over Baltic dominion states. His favour with the Swedish crown was demonstrated when he received a grant of land from Karl X upon his decision to retire from military service in 1659. Neither his date of death nor anything else about him is known after this period.

Douglas, Robert, Count Douglas in the Swedish nobility (1611-1662), army officer in the Swedish service, was born at Standingstone Farm, near Haddington, on 17 March 1611, the youngest of at least three sons of Patrick Douglas of Whittingehame and his wife, Christina Leslie. The document proving Douglas's ancestry, obtained from the Scottish parliament in the name of Charles I in 1648, listed his father as 'comarchus' of Standingstone, which later became translated as marquess in Sweden, although Patrick Douglas was only a laird. 
Not much is known of Douglas's early years, but by 1628 he had taken a path common to many young Scotsmen and entered Swedish service in Colonel James Ramsay's regiment, along with his two brothers, William and Richard, who both died shortly thereafter. Douglas was taken into service as a page for the elector palatine Johann Casimir, the brother-in-law of the Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus, and as a result Douglas came to know the future king Karl X rather well. Douglas soon became an ensign in the service of Gustavus Adolphus, and saw action during the joint Swedish-Danish defence of Stralsund from 1629 to 1630, where he served under the command of the governor, Colonel Alexander Leslie (the future earl of Leven). Although his autobiographical notes maintain he was still a personal page to the Swedish king, the Swedish army muster rolls reveal that Douglas entered the Green regiment in 1631. Douglas also served as captain-lieutenant of some of the British troops recruited by the marquess of Hamilton for Swedish service. He then became a major with a dragoon corps from 1632, was promoted lieutenant-colonel two years later, and finally rose to a colonelcy in 1636. 
Douglas decided to travel home that year to sort out domestic issues in Scotland, and the Riksrad (Swedish state council) arranged accreditation for him to Charles I. The intercessory letter they provided concerned his inheritance troubles, while Chancellor Oxenstierna also employed him for personal affairs in London. Douglas therefore had both official and private sponsorship from the highest echelons of the Swedish government for his journey, and by November 1636 he had arrived in London. He avoided involvement in the covenanting wars of Scotland and returned in the late summer of 1637 to Sweden to continue his military career. Although Douglas remained on the margins of British political developments throughout his life, Charles II personally requested his support in providing Scottish recruits for his use in 1655. He was not able to comply, but he had already sent him 5200 riksdaler two years previously. Douglas also sought Swedish intercession in 1658 on behalf of John Maitland, marquess and duke of Lauderdale, who was imprisoned by Cromwell. Although this did not lead to Lauderdale's immediate release, his prison conditions improved. 
By 1643 Douglas had been promoted general of the Swedish cavalry. He further consolidated his social standing in 1645 by marrying Hedvig Morner ('c'.1624- 'c'.1671), the sister-in-law of Baron Erik Stenbock. His wife and family followed him on his foreign appointments, as shown by the birth of his sixth child in Poland in 1655. His position as governor of Schwaben caused him problems owing to the drastic shortage of funds, frequently complained about in the Riksrad. His military promotions continued and he became major-general in 1647. He spent a month in Stockholm that year participating in the meetings of the Riksrad, often in the presence of Queen Kristina, where he provided information on the army's situation in Germany, and advised the queen against entering into land exchanges with the French. 
In 1649 Douglas was promoted lieutenant-general and, having become firmly established in Sweden, planned to build a house at Qvarnholmen in Stockholm. Douglas was ennobled in 1651 with the title of Baron Douglas of Skalby, which gave him land at Kalmar. He was also appointed a member of the military council, despite his open Calvinism. His integration into Swedish noble and court society was confirmed by service as the royal stablemaster in 1652. Two years later he gained another title, being made Count (Greve) Douglas of Skenninge, and was introduced to the Swedish house of nobility. He also continued to participate in meetings of the Riksrad. 
Sweden's war with Poland, beginning in 1655, saw Douglas active as general and successfully taking a fortress barely 6 miles from Crakow. He became a lieutenant-field marshal of the infantry and cavalry in the same year. Douglas personally accompanied Karl X on his march towards Riga in 1656, and became a full field marshal in the following year. On account of war with Denmark-Norway, Douglas was recalled from Riga, with his family, to help defend Sweden. He not only participated in the Riksrad again that year, but also served as a military adviser to the Swedish government on defence tactics. He commanded 3000 men at the battle of Laholm, defeating the Danish forces. His military expertise led the Riksrad to send him to the Dal and Norrland regions with 2000 soldiers and 300 cavalry in order to take Trondheim from the Norwegians. In 1658 he received a pass to travel in Sweden, and he again served on the military council which was organizing the garrisons in the territories newly won through conquest from Denmark-Norway. 
When the Polish campaigns resumed towards the end of 1658 Douglas replaced governor Magnus de la Gardie as military commander in the Baltic states of Estonia and Livonia. His military assignment in the Baltic was to regain territories occupied by the Russians, who had joined in the Polish war against Sweden. Indeed Douglas's most notorious duty involved kidnapping the duke of Courland and his family. Once peace had been established at Kardis in 1661 Douglas became responsible for demobilizing his Swedish troops. Karl X, with whom Douglas had a personal relationship (he had twice entertained the Swedish royal couple at his Goteborg home in 1658) died and Douglas and his family returned to Sweden in September 1661. Douglas continued to participate in meetings of the Riksrad and military council until his death in Blasieholmen, Stockholm, on 28 May 1662. He was buried in Riddarholms church, Stockholm. 
Militarily, Robert Douglas was probably the most successful British immigrant to Sweden during the Thirty Years' War. Although Alexander Leslie also attained the rank of field marshal, his love for Scotland was so strong that he left Sweden in 1638, never to serve its crown again. Douglas, on the other hand, only briefly considered moving to Scotland with his family when he temporarily fell out of favour with the new Swedish king, Karl XI, in 1660. In his adopted country he has been regarded as 'a great Swedish man' and his biographer has concluded that, through high military rank, baronial privileges, wealth, and marriage, 'despite all the retained Scottish idiosyncrasies', he had become a Swede (Douglas, 16).

MacDougal, Maurice (1603-1655), army officer in the Swedish service, was born in Sweden, one of nine sons of the Scot Albert MacDougal (1541-1641) of Mackerston and Ursula Von Stralendorf (died 1651), one of his three wives from Mecklenburg. Little is known of MacDougal's life before he entered Swedish military service with his brothers, although his social success was typical of the ease with which Scotsmen and their sons became integrated into Swedish society at the time. He was known as Mauritz Duwall in Sweden. 
MacDougal first served as an ensign in 1624 in Gustaf Horn's Norrland regiment, and his military career advanced rapidly from then on. He had become a lieutenant in his brother James MacDougal's regiment by 1626, a captain two years later, a lieutenant-colonel by 1633, and a full colonel the following year. In 1638 he was in charge of conscription in the Vasterbotten region of Finland. That year he was also ennobled and introduced into the Swedish house of nobility on the merits of his father's long service to the Swedish crown. His brother Axel had been ennobled in 1626. MacDougal's claims to noble origins were supported by a fellow Scottish officer, James Forbes, and the Swedish chancellor's son, Johan Oxenstierna, who reported upon their return from a diplomatic mission to Scotland in 1634 that the MacDougals were a well-known noble family. 
MacDougal became involved in disputes between the dowager queen Kristina, Gustav II Adolf's mother, and the Swedish government in 1640. He felt a strong loyalty towards Kristina as his father had served her before him. Not only had the queen sought financial aid from MacDougal, which was considered an illegal action, but he had also prevented another Swedish noblewoman, Kristina Bielke, from moving into the dowager queen's property in Orby. In 1641 MacDougal appeared before the Riksrad (the Swedish state council) to answer several charges of unlawful and disgraceful behaviour. He defended himself well, was reinstated to his former position, and by 1644 was being considered by the Riksrad for the position of colonel of the mountain troops. He consolidated his position in Sweden by buying land from his brother Colonel and Commandant Tobias MacDougal in 1652 -- land which had originally been procured with Gustav II Adolf's permission in 1629. This meant that he held land in Hallkved, Broby, and Sund in Funbo parish, and Kattslinge in Vendels parish. Little is known of MacDougal's later activities or of his marriage. He died in 1655.

Forbes, James (1580-1656), merchant and army officer in the Swedish service, was the eldest son of Henry Forbes (died 1605), a soldier, of Thainstone and Margaret Forbes, eldest daughter of William Forbes of Corse and Susanna Stauchan. James was born in Thainstone, Aberdeen and probably arrived in Sweden with his father and brother Peter (also known as Patrick) about 1600. Henry Forbes served in the Swedish army under Karl IX and was killed in September 1605 at the battle of Kirkholm in Livonia. Peter moved to Schonewalds in Prussia where, in 1634, he served as the factor for the Swedish forces in Germany. James Forbes remained in Sweden after his father's death and went on to become a merchant for Gustav II Adolf. By August 1624 he received all the privileges of a burgess of Stockholm when he became a citizen there. 
Perhaps surprisingly for a man of forty-six, James Forbes (who was known as Jacob in Sweden) decided to enter military service. The motivation behind the career change remains unclear. None the less he enlisted as a private in the Narke-Varmlands regiment in 1626 and in the following year he was promoted lieutenant. This rapid rise in rank is suggestive of some earlier military experience although there is as yet no evidence for this. Forbes's progress through the ranks continued and by 1628 he became a captain for a company of Varmlanders before transferring to the Sodermanlands regiment in 1628 or 1629. During this period Forbes had occasion to undertake business with the Riksrad (the Swedish state council) in his capacity as a burgess of Stockholm. These matters, which showed that he maintained his civic and trading interests, included inquiries regarding shipping and complaints against the overvaluation of Swedish currency. 
Forbes applied to Charles I for evidence of his noble origins which would allow him to become ennobled in Sweden. A letter from Charles I authenticating the nobility of 'Jacob and Patrick Forbes de Thainstone' dated 1629 still survives in the library in the city of Lund. James's application for ennoblement in Sweden proved successful. In 1630 the Riksrad prepared an open letter on Forbes's behalf and the year 1631 saw him naturalized, ennobled and introduced into the Swedish nobility. Things progressed at a slower pace for Peter Forbes, who did not become naturalized as a Swedish nobleman until March 1651. 
Despite his elevation in Swedish society there is some evidence to suggest that James Forbes found himself in conflict with Colonel Alexander Forbes, master of Forbes. A letter of recommendation for Alexander Forbes addressed to Queen Kristina in January 1636 contains reference to a dispute between Alexander and a James Forbes already in Swedish service. The details are not given, only that the dispute is a private matter which the master of Forbes hoped the queen could help resolve. No evidence has been found that there was any other James Forbes of sufficient status to warrant a request for royal intervention. 
James Forbes remained active in the Swedish army despite his increasing years. In 1647 he served as a colonel for one of the few recruited Scottish regiments still in Swedish service, probably that of his kinsman William Forbes. The treaty of Westphalia in 1648 reduced the need for military commanders within Sweden. By the time of renewed hostilities against Poland in 1655 Forbes was well beyond his military prime. He died on 17 June 1656 in Lund after a distinguished civic and military career. A tomb decorated with his coat of arms was erected for his body in Funbo church in Lund. James married Lillieram Chesnecopherus although the date of their wedding has not been established. Their children included Peter, Olof, Jacob and Henrik (twins), Johan, Nils, and at least four daughters. They in turn had children, and the military muster rolls and university matriculation records of Sweden and Finland are replete with the names of the progeny of James Forbes of Thainstone.

Hay, Alexander (d. 1639), army officer in the Swedish service, was born in Scotland of unknown parents. Although there are references to Hay's arriving in Sweden in 1600, nothing more is known of him there until 1632. There was also a Lieutenant Alexander Hay serving in the kingdom of Denmark-Norway before this time, who achieved the rank of captain and was paid off in 1628. This date coincides with Danish-Norwegian withdrawal from the Thirty Years' War, so it is probable that Hay then entered into Swedish service, as this was a common path for many other Scots in Danish service. Robert Monro mentions one Saunders Hay who became captain for Annan's company and initially remained in Scotland before entering Swedish service. This would fit with Hay's first listing on Swedish military muster rolls in 1632, serving as a major in Patrick Ruthven's regiment. The following year, while serving in Francis Ruthven's recruited regiment, he gained promotion to lieutenant-colonel. He also acted as the chief of a squadron of dragoons. At some point before 1631 Hay married Dorotea Plessen, and they had at least two sons. 
Hay was stationed at Memel, a Polish town which had been taken by the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf in 1628 and subsequently handed over to Sweden for six years. While in the service of the governor there, Hay became involved in the Polish authorities' complaints against a certain Captain Thomas Hume who had plundered some Jews in 1633. Hay himself offered to compensate the Jews, but as Hume was already in gaol and could not repay Hay, he turned to Colonel Ruthven for help. Ruthven took great offence at this and made Hay's life so unpleasant that he wanted to leave the regiment. At this time a Polish nobleman, Crispin Kerstenstein, corresponded with Hay, and suggested that he enter Polish service. Hay then approached the Swedish authorities and requested the termination of his commission because of his problems with Colonel Ruthven. However, when the Swedish General Herman Wrangel heard of this Hay was summoned for an interview. Hay explained that he would have served in Polish forces on campaign only against the Russians, never against the Swedish crown, and that this only came about because of Colonel Ruthven's intolerable attitude towards him. General Wrangel did not believe Hay and had him incarcerated pending further investigation, and informed the Swedish chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, of the matter. Shortly after this Hay was released from prison to attend his young son's funeral in Memel. At the end of November General Wrangel had Hay brought before a military tribunal to answer charges of corresponding with the enemy. The tribunal decided in favour of Hay for two reasons. The relations had been initiated by the enemy, relieving Hay of some of the charges, and Hay had been disadvantaged by his lack of fluency in German, which meant he was liable to have misunderstood the initial proposition. He was therefore not subject to 'the usual' punishment (the latter was not specified) and his verdict would be decided by Oxenstierna. Hay was also in the process of obtaining a copy of his response to the Pole, which he believed had been wrongly worded by his scribe. 
There does not appear to be any further mention of Hay after this in Swedish sources so it must be presumed that the issue was settled. Hay died in 1639. There is a further reference to Alexander Hay in Denmark in 1643 where his wife and his brother were involved in litigation over his inheritance. This implies that his wife was Danish and had returned to Denmark after her husband's death. Hay's surviving son, Henrik, was born in Stockholm in 1631 and was ennobled in 1689.

Irving, Alexander (d. 1659), army officer in the Swedish service, was born at Tulloch in Scotland, the son of George Irving, laird of Tulloch, and his wife, Isabella Makison. In the Swedish peerage, which often lists Scottish gentry as nobility, his mother is noted as baroness of Meldrum, daughter of Bishop Alexander Makison and his wife, Christina Duncan, but no trace of this has been found in Scotland. Irving came to Sweden with his father in 1608 where the latter served as under-governor-general of Kalmar. 
Alexander Irving soon enlisted in the Swedish army and the military archives list him as an ensign for the Narke-Varmlands regiment in 1616. He had been promoted lieutenant-captain for the Uppland regiment by 1624, though some sources say that he was still an ensign in the Narke-Varmlands regiment until 1627. This probably means that he was retained by his first regiment while serving in the second one. After becoming a lieutenant in the Uppland regiment Irving appears to have served as a captain in two other regiments from 1630, including that of Lord Donald Mackay. He was still a captain in 1632, in Duke Bernhard of Weimar's regiment. The following year he returned to the company of fellow Scots in the Green brigade as a lieutenant-colonel. In 1634 Irving held a position as major of the city militia in Regensburg, which had been occupied by the Swedes since 1633. There is further conflicting evidence as to Irving's position in 1639, both the Norrland infantry regiment and the Vasterbotten regiment listing him among their officers. This implies that Irving had returned to Sweden after service in Germany, unlike many other Scottish officers who returned to Scotland during the bishops' wars. 
At some stage Irving married Agneta Patkull, chief lady in waiting to Queen Kristina the elder. They had two sons and two daughters, which would have made leaving Sweden difficult. In 1643 Irving sought admission for his children to the Swedish house of nobility, and attention was drawn to this in the meeting of the Riksrad (Swedish state council) of 19 October. He claimed to have proof of his noble origins from Aberdeen, and he returned with the document the next day. To his dismay the Riksrad resolved that only documents from state councils, parliaments, or the monarch of a given nation would be accepted in future. Irving was still considered a nobleman, particularly on the merit of his service to the Swedish crown, but his children could not be admitted to the ranks of the Swedish nobility. The following year the Riksrad decided that Irving would receive four farms. 
Irving's military career was still progressing and by 1645 he had been promoted colonel of the Smaland regiment. The next year he was colonel and chief of the Kalmar regiment. In 1647 Irving was ennobled in Sweden and introduced to the house of nobility. After this not much is known of him until 1654 when his military expertise led to his appointment as commandant at Stade, a Swedish fort in the former province of Bremen on the Swedish border with the Danish duchy of Holstein. Irving left the Swedish service in 1656 because of old age, and died in 1659.

Kinnemond, Thomas (d. 1657), army officer in the Swedish service, was born in Scotland at a place noted in the Swedish peerage lists as Calensk or Calensh. Although it is uncertain who his parents were, it is known that he and his brother Patrick emigrated to Sweden in the 1620s, before entire Scottish regiments began to take service in Sweden, and so the brothers served with Swedish troops. Little information survives on Patrick, who joined the Swedish army in 1624, and rose to the rank of colonel before he died in 1645. 
Thomas Kinnemond served first as an ensign in Johan Baner's Ostergotland infantry regiment in 1628, where he subsequently became a lieutenant under Erik Hand's command in 1629. He became major of the city militia in Augsburg in 1633. Not much is known of Kinnemond's movements after this until 1637 when he was appointed master of court at the castle in Koporie in Ingermanland; and in 1640 he was a lieutenant-colonel of a squadron of Viborg men. He became a full colonel in 1649 and was the colonel-in-chief of the Viborg regiment by 1651. During this time he also served as the commandant at Nyenmunde Fort. 
In 1650 Kinnemond was naturalized and ennobled, as was his brother, posthumously, in a wave of ennoblements authorized by Queen Kristina of Sweden. His social standing was further enhanced by the land in Livonia which he inherited through his uncle John, who had also entered the Swedish service. In 1651 Kinnemond became a colonel and commandant at Dunamunde Fort, which he himself had constructed. It is not known when he married Christina Scott, the daughter of Colonel James Scott and his wife, Margaret Gibson, although his choice of a Scottish wife implies that his ties to Scotland were still strong. They had seven children, of whom only two survived. He died in 1657. His son Patrick also entered Swedish service.

Maclean, John (d. 1666), merchant in Sweden, was born in Scotland in the early 1600s, the son of Hector Maclean, laird of Duart, and his wife, Isabella Acheson, daughter of Sir Archibald Acheson of Gosford. Known as Iain Dubh in his youth, little is known of Maclean's early life, though he is sometimes described as having been in Stuart naval service and sometimes as a merchant and trader in Germany. In 1623-4 he was a royal supplier to Queen Maria Eleanora in Stockholm, where his trading partner James had been a burgess since 1609. He married James's wife's sister, Anna Gubbertz (died 1653), in 1629 and had fifteen children with her, though only ten survived to adulthood. First recorded in Goteborg in 1628, he became a burgess there the following year. His main trade was in iron bars and timber, but included shipbuilding materials, salt, herrings, spirits, and English coal. His success allowed him to build up a small fleet of his own. He represented Goteborg in the 1632 Swedish parliament, and from 1635 to 1650 he served as a town councillor, taking an active role in ecclesiastical, educational, customs, and building activities. He entertained the Swedish regent, Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, and the state marshal, Jakob de la Gardie, on their visit to Goteborg in 1639. 
During the bishops' wars in Scotland, Maclean supplied the covenanters with ships and weapons from Sweden. He also funded the Irish 'wild geese' who settled in Goteborg in 1640-47 to receive military training from the Ulfsparre family. From 1643 to 1645 he played a vital role in defending Goteborg from Danish attack by supplying the Swedish crown with food and clothing on credit and by furnishing warships and privateers. He organized and funded a reconnaissance mission to Copenhagen in 1644. He also called on the personal fleet of his friend the Walloon financier Louis de Geer, to protect Goteborg harbour from the Danes. Maclean's business success continued as he and his associates established a rope and sail factory in Goteborg on 20 May 1646. He again represented Goteborg at the parliament in 1649. He was ennobled under the name of Macklier (sometimes written Makeleer) on 20 May 1649 and formally introduced into the Swedish house of nobility in 1652. When the Stuart envoy Colonel John Cochrane was sent to Scandinavia in 1649 to obtain military support for Charles II, Maclean provided James Graham, marquess of Montrose, with ships and weapons at his own expense, though two shipments appear to have been intercepted by the English Commonwealth fleet. The exiled Charles II created him a baronet on 13 April 1650, though no patent was ever issued; this honour was perhaps in lieu of the 1350 riksdaler Charles owed him and which Maclean never received. His involvement with Montrose may be explained by the marriage of his eldest son, Jacob (Jakob), to Cochrane's daughter Catherine. 
In 1653 Maclean married, as his second wife, Lilian Hamilton (died 1658). He met the Cromwellian ambassador Bulstrode Whitelocke several times during Whitelocke's embassy to Sweden in 1653-4, presumably in the capacity of a civic official for Goteborg. In 1658 he received three royal donations of land in Halland, Sweden. That year he was married for the third time; his wife was Anna Gordon (died 1677), daughter of another Scot in Sweden, Colonel Thomas Thomson, and his wife, Catherine Murray, and widow of Johan Gordon, colonel in the Swedish army. In 1660 he received the title of 'commissary'. He still sought the repayment of his money and goods lost in Montrose's campaign and sent Charles II a bill for $9112 at 8 per cent to be paid over the following decade, but to no avail. His sons had varied careers. The eldest, Jacob (1632-1663), became a gentleman-in-waiting to Charles II and a colonel in the Stuart army. Johan (1636-1696) became the president of the court of justice in Goteborg, while Gustav (1641-1701) and Peter (1644-1697) both became colonels in the Swedish army. David (1646-1708) became the first Baron Maclean in Sweden, serving as an assistant to the Swedish ambassador to Britain in 1674, and becoming a colonel and governor in the Swedish army. John Maclean died in Goteborg on 7 July 1666 and was buried in the German church there on 16 August.

Ogilvie, Patrick (1606-1674), army officer in the Swedish service, was born in Scotland, the son of Colonel William Ogilvie, a younger brother of Sir Patrick Ogilvie of Inchmartin, and either his wife, Elizabeth Langlands, or Barbara Kinnaird. Not much is known of Ogilvie's early life, until he entered Swedish military service as an ensign in 1624 in the regiment of James Spens, the son of the Stuart ambassador in Stockholm, Sir James Spens. From 1632 he served as a major in the conscripted infantry regiment from the Abo region, and after ten years' service he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. He continued with this regiment until he became its colonel in 1657. 
Although Ogilvie married three times, the dates of the marriages and whether he had children remain unclear. His first wife, a Scotswoman, was the daughter of James Scott and Margareta Gibson. His second wife was a Swedish noblewoman, Catharina Mannerskold, as was his third wife, Helena Sass. 
Ogilvie undertook an active role in civic life in Sweden, and made donations to the poor in July 1640. He was keen to be integrated further into Swedish society and so produced two documents in order to initiate the ennoblement process in Sweden. The first was signed in 1640 by his fellow Scottish officers James Lumsden, David Leslie, William Borthwick, Hans Ramsay, and William Weiners. The second document was witnessed in 1642 by Baron Patrick Ruthven, Baron Vilhelm Spens, Ludvig Leslie, James Hamilton, Hugo Mowatt, and Patrik Morus. The two documents claimed that Ogilvie was of Scottish noble descent on both maternal and paternal sides. As a result he was introduced to the Swedish house of nobility in 1642; he received donations of land from Queen Kristina in 1648. The following year Ogilvie provided the Riksdad (the Swedish parliament) with a further document from Perth dated 1647. 
Ogilvie was a colourful character, as the records of the Riksrad (Swedish state council) reveal. In 1650 they discussed punishing Ogilvie for having attacked a burgess in Stockholm. He had already been pardoned by Queen Kristina for unlawfully firing a weapon on her birthday. Despite these misdemeanours Ogilvie remained in royal favour and obtained the rights to two further properties in 1651. The land he held included Selkis and Voltis in Kumo parish, Arlak in Virmo parish, Otrova by Narva and Reguleva in Koporie region in Ingermanland, Vurda in Jama region, and Teivaala in Birkkala parish in Finland. Ogilvie did not confine himself to military duties, but entered the Swedish diplomatic service, and conveyed correspondence between the Russian General Nashchokin and the Swedish military commander Magnus de la Gardie in 1656. Sweden was at war with Poland at the time and Russian support was vital to Swedish success. The following year he moved from the Abo to the Viborg region infantry, and soon took on the position of governor. He also served in Riga in 1657 informing the Swedish government of shortages in manpower, provisions, and ammunition there. In 1660 he was again a governor, this time in the Kexholm region. After that nothing is known of him until his death in 1674.

Scott, Robert (d. 1631), army officer in the Swedish and Danish services and military inventor, is a man of whom nothing is known before 1623, when Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden granted the Scot James Spens, son of the Stuart ambassador in Stockholm, Sir James Spens, authority to levy a body of Scottish soldiers for Swedish service. In the same year Scott levied 200 men for the king of Sweden, presumably as part of Spens's recruitment drive. For the next five years Scott served in the Swedish army, eventually acting as the army's quartermaster-general. Scott was mentioned in royal correspondence to the Danish Court by Erik Krabbe, the Danish resident in Stockholm, in connection with Gustavus Adolphus's impending campaign in western Prussia in 1628. The Danes were interested in Scott because of his development of light artillery. 
While in Swedish service Scott developed a type of leather-covered cannon, also known as the leather gun, in competition with that of Melchior von Wurmbrand. These cannon were revolutionary in that they were light enough to be carried by two men, they fired the same size shot as conventional cannon with half the powder, and they could fire up to a hundred times without having to be left to cool down. Scott used different proportions to Wurmbrand in the construction of his cannon. He also told the king that he had contrived a way of reloading his cannon ten times before a soldier could reload his musket once. Some Danish noblemen witnessed a demonstration of the leather cannon in Stockholm at which the Swedish king was said to have been suitably impressed. However, Scott wished payment of 20,000 Swedish riksdaler for his invention, a sum which Gustavus Adolphus refused to pay. 
The Danes successfully recruited Scott from Swedish service in 1628 and he received his appointment as the master-general of artillery on 6 September. This appointment has caused some historical debate since such a military rank had not previously existed within the Danish army. None the less a record exists in the Copenhagen archive of Scott's appointment as 'General Artillerimeister' with a salary of 400 Danish rigsdaler per month, four times that of other officers of artillery. Scott's service for the Danish crown was short, and had ended by the time Denmark pulled out of the Thirty Years' War. Scott left the service of Christian IV to return to England. The exact date of his departure is unclear, some sources suggesting October or November 1628 and others placing his leaving some time after the treaty of Lubeck in 1629. He was certainly in Stuart service by September 1629. There he acted as a gentleman of the bedchamber to Charles I. 
As part of his Stuart service Scott received new accommodation from the crown. Charles I wrote to Attorney-General Heath on 3 September 1629 ordering him to purchase a house in Lambeth, which came with 8 acres of land. For this purpose Heath was ordered to contract himself to the chancellor of the exchequer for the sum of $1400. Five months later, on 15 February 1630, Scott and his family were issued with a grant of denization. This document notes that Scott had a wife named Anne and two children, Charles and Anne, as well as a nephew also called Robert Scott. According to Sir James Balfour Paul ('Scots peerage', 2.282), Scott's other nephew, James Wemyss, was also included in an act of denization issued to Scott in 1630, although no mention of this appears in the 'Calendar of State Papers, Domestic'. 
Within only a few days of the grant of denization being issued, on 20 February 1630, it was ordered that Scott should receive $600 per annum in wages. During this brief time in the service of Charles I, Scott managed to introduce the leather cannon into the British Isles, but he did not live to see the deployment of his weapon. He died in 1631 and was buried in St Mary, Lambeth, in Surrey where an epitaph to his artillery invention can be found. 
The effectiveness of the leather cannon has been doubted (G. Parker, 'The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West, 1500-1800', 1996, 33-35), but there is ample evidence of its being regarded as an excellent weapon during the wars in the three Stuart kingdoms between 1638 and 1651. It first saw service with the Scottish covenanters in the version developed by General Alexander Hamilton, known as 'Dear Sandy's stoup'. Later, leather cannon could be found in the English parliamentarian and Cromwellian service in the Scott model, as developed and refined by his nephew Wemyss. Many of these guns also ended up in royalist service after the capture of Wemyss and his artillery train in 1644.

Sinclair, David (d. 1656), army officer in the Swedish service, was born in Scotland. The Swedish peerage notes him as the son of William Sinclair of Seba and his wife, Barbara Halcro, the daughter of Baron Hugo Halcro, although this could not be supported in the Scottish peerage (Scottish lairds were commonly called barons in seventeenth-century Sweden). David went to Sweden in 1630 or 1631 with his elder brother John and his father, and they all entered military service. John became a lieutenant-colonel in 1632 but died soon after at Thorn in Prussia. 
David Sinclair appears to have begun his military career as an ensign in Colonel Robert Cunningham's regiment in 1633, but he also served in Andreas Dynn's recruited squadron that year. He may have been in William Gunn's recruited infantry squadron in 1636 but the following year he had returned to Cunningham's regiment, serving alongside his father. In 1638 Sinclair was a lieutenant in his father's regiment. There is no further reference to Sinclair in the Swedish military records for the next eleven years. From 1640 he was involved in the Scottish and later English civil wars. He was known as a staunch royalist in Swedish circles and used to bear the Stuart symbol of a white cockade. However, after the execution of Charles I Sinclair reappeared in Swedish service in Johan Wittkopf's cavalry regiment as an unspecified officer in 1649. He also served in Joakim Ernst Goertzke's cavalry regiment that year. David was soon promoted to lieutenant-colonel and then became the colonel of a foreign recruited cavalry regiment after 1650. Realizing the futility of the royalist cause, David used his father's money, which had been set aside for the family's return to Scotland, to buy property at Finnekumla in Alvsborg in Sweden. In 1651 he married Catherine Makeleer ('b'. 1637), the daughter of the Scottish merchant John Maclean (d. 1666), who was based at Goteborg and had become a staunch royalist. They had three children, and one of them, William, later became Baron Sinclair. David Sinclair served as an interpreter for the Cromwellian ambassador Bulstrode Whitelocke on his 1654-5 embassy to Sweden, and the political tendencies of his and his wife's families must have made for interesting conversations. According to the ambassador's diary, Sinclair went to great lengths to inform Whitelocke of the size and strength of Goteborg's fortifications, perhaps in an effort to reveal the power available to the Scottish royalists in Sweden. Sinclair's integration into Swedish society continued as he was ennobled and introduced to the Swedish house of nobility in 1655. He remained in military service on the Polish campaigns of Karl X and was fatally wounded by a cannon-ball while leading a charge at Warsaw in 1656. Although he died shortly afterwards his name was still listed as the colonel of a regiment in the Swedish military muster rolls until 1661.

Stewart, Simon (d. 1646), naval officer in the Swedish service, was born in Scotland, probably in the 1580s, the son of Robert Stewart of Touccars, Ayrshire, and his wife, Agnes Hiegait, the daughter of William Hiegait and his wife, Joneta Graham. In 1610 Stewart and his brother Bernard, the laird of Barscube, attacked Robert Stewart, minister of Hoy and Braemsay, in the course of his duties. Although the matter was taken to be a private quarrel, Stewart had aroused the wrath of James VI and I and fled to Norway with his associates. Norwegian chancellery records show that in 1612 Stewart had captured a Norwegian ship and all its goods -- including royal gold and tolls money -- while in the service of the earl of Orkney. A series of pirate attacks on Norwegian ships had been sparked by the seizure of an Orkney cargo ship in Bergen in 1611, which led to complex litigation for many years to come, as many of the goods belonged to James VI and I. Attacks on Norwegian shipping and harbours by Orkney privateers were ongoing between 1612 and 1617 and Sir Robert Anstruther, the Stuart ambassador to Denmark and Norway, noted that two of the pirate skippers were named Stewart and worked on commission from the earl of Orkney. Imprisoned in Norway, Stewart escaped and fled to Sweden in 1616, where he was also noted as a pirate. This was no obstacle to his employment there and by 22 June he was taken on as a captain in the Swedish navy. The following year he commanded a ship on a reconnaissance mission to Konigsberg, and in 1618 he commanded two ships carrying Swedish soldiers to Reval in Estonia. In 1620 he was an ensign on a Swedish admiral's ship. He may be the Captain Stewart mentioned in Swedish naval records at this time as a witness to a fatal argument between three Scottish naval officers. In 1624-6 he was a lieutenant in the Goteborg shipping company. In 1627 he served as a captain in two Swedish admirals' fleets at Danzig, and in 1629 he was in another admiral's fleet at Pillau. When King Gustavus Adolphus left Stralsund to return to Stockholm Stewart patrolled the south of the Sound. On 30 May 1630 he became a vice-admiral, and was given orders to protect Swedish warships and Dutch cargo ships. Later that year he was an under-admiral in the Swedish state admiral's fleet. He commanded fleets of two to fourteen ships crossing to the German coast throughout the Thirty Years' War. Having obtained a royal patent from Charles I dated 27 September 1633 proving his noble Scottish origins, he was ennobled and introduced into the Swedish house of nobility in 1634. He owned land in Hammarby, Upland, partly received in royal donations in 1627 and 1630 and partly obtained by exchange in 1637. In May 1634 he was the admiral of a transport fleet to Pillau. On 23 May 1644 he was made a lieutenant-admiral. It is unknown when he married his first wife, Margaret Buchanan, of Scottish noble origins. She was still alive in 1643 and appears not to have divorced Stewart, nor to have accompanied him to Sweden. His second wife was a Swede, Anna Bengtsdotter Svinhufvud, who was still living in 1652; they had two children. His son Robert was a student at Uppsala University in 1636, but died shortly before his father, who died in Stockholm in November 1646.

Stuart, Andrew (c.1570-1640), army officer and diplomat in the Swedish service, was born in Scotland, the son of John Stewart of Ochiltree, a soldier who served in the escort of Mary, queen of Scots, and Agneta Forbes. Andrew's brother John (Hans) Stuart had also migrated to Sweden and gained distinction as a gentleman of the bedchamber at the court of Karl IX in 1604 and inspector-general of all foreign troops in Swedish service by 1609. Their genealogy is interesting in that no John Stewart of Ochiltree can be traced in the Scottish peerage. However, Andrew's godfather was Andrew Stewart, second Lord Ochiltree, who signed a letter proving Hans Stuart's nobility in 1585. This was accompanied by an open letter from James VI of Scotland that referred to Hans as 'our dear relative'. These documents allowed Hans Stuart to use the same coat of arms as James Stuart, earl of Arran, the second son of Lord Ochiltree, suggesting a relationship which remains elusive. 
Andrew Stuart emigrated to Sweden and became a gentleman of the bedchamber at the court of Duke Karl of Sodermanland (later King Karl IX) by 1592. He was known in Sweden as Anders the elder to distinguish him from his nephew, who also served in the Swedish army. In reward for his military services Andrew the elder received land in 1599 from Karl IX in Ledingelunda (or Lagerlund), part of the parish of Karna in Sweden. During this period he also married Elisabet Anrep, daughter of Adolf Anrep and Gertrud von Nieroth, although the exact date remains unclear. 
At the beginning of 1600 Stuart became a commander of the Swedish forces at Fellin in Livland and by 1602 he was serving as governor of Dorpat. His administrative duties continued when in 1604 he assumed responsibility for the Norra More region of Kalmar. He later received further lands in Starsater (renamed Stuartsater) in Vists parish and Lida in Kvillinge parish. 
Stuart continued to serve in the army and became colonel in chief for the Ostgota infantry in 1605. However, he continued to pursue work outside his military life. During the Kalmar War between Sweden and Denmark-Norway (1611-13), Stewart joined the Swedish diplomatic service and acted as their envoy to Russia in 1611. During this period Stuart also maintained contact with the court of James VI and I. Perhaps more surprising is that Stuart also had indirect communication with Christian IV of Denmark-Norway through a Scottish nobleman in Danish service, Andrew Sinclair, governor of the newly conquered Swedish fortress of Kalmar. 
Stuart's functions in later life included service in the Swedish fleet. He is recorded as having become a vice-admiral in the fleet of the riksamiral (state admiral) in 1621. He also continued to hold posts on land, acting as master of the court to Pfalzgreve Johan Casimir in 1633. Anders Stuart died on 27 December 1640, apparently from natural causes, and was buried in Vists parish church in Sweden. Together Anders and his wife, Elisabet, had three sons and two daughters: Carl ('c'.1600-1637), Johan Adolf (1603-1666), Anders (died 1637), Christina (1600-1648), and Catharina (1622-1699). The sons all engaged in Swedish military service and both daughters also married soldiers.

Stuart, John (b. before 1550, d. 1618), army officer in the Swedish service, was born in Scotland, the eldest son of John Stewart of Ochiltree and his wife, Agneta Forbes, the daughter of Robert Forbes and Anna Sinclair. It seems clear that his family was in some way related to that of the Stewart lords Ochiltree, but an exact connection has proved impossible to establish. John Stuart's father is believed to have accompanied Mary, queen of Scots, to France in the 1550s, serving there as a colonel for Francois II before returning to Scotland in 1560; Stuart himself probably gained his education in France, and visited Germany and other European countries on his travels. Before 1564 he was back in Scotland, as that year he sailed from Edinburgh towards Danzig. However, his ship was captured by Danes, who were embroiled in the Nordic Seven Years' War against Sweden, and Stuart was imprisoned in Varberg on suspicion of wanting to enter Swedish military service. Varberg was seized by Swedish forces in August, and all the Scottish troops in the Danish army were forcibly placed under Swedish command. Stuart was then stripped of his moneys by Swedish troops and moved to a prison in Uppsala, presumably as the Swedes were not certain about his status. It was through the efforts of other Scottish officers already in Swedish service that he was finally released. 
It is not certain exactly when Stuart decided to stay in Sweden, where he was known as Hans, although he is recorded as master of horse of Erik XIV, who reigned from 1560 to 1568. He then entered the service of the duke of Sodermanland, king of Sweden as Karl IX from 1599 to 1611. Similarly it is unknown when Stuart married Brita Eriksdotter (died 1622), both of whose parents were of noble Swedish stock. As was required of foreigners aspiring to marry into the Swedish nobility, Stuart provided evidence of his noble origins in a letter to Johan III and his brother Duke Karl dated 12 October 1579 and signed by Earl Collins of Ergadie (Colin Campbell, sixth earl of Argyll), the chancellor of Scotland, Earl Robert Stuart of Levenox (Robert Stewart, earl of Lennox), and Andrew Stuart of Ochiltree (perhaps his brother). Stuart obtained another letter, dated 14 June 1585, from James VI, allowing him to use the Ochiltree coat of arms at the request of James Stewart, earl of Arran. Duke Karl had already endowed Stuart with land in Sodermanland in 1579, which he exchanged for land in Hedenlunda in 1582; in 1610 he obtained rights of inheritance for himself, his wife, and his male descendants. Hedenlunda remained the Stewart family seat in Sweden for the next two centuries. 
In 1604 Stuart was a gentleman of the chamber of Karl IX, and he soon became the colonel of a regiment he had raised himself in Scotland. By 1609 he was not only the quartermaster-general and the war commissioner-general, but also the muster-general of all the foreign soldiers in Sweden. He was sent to Russia as an envoy during the Swedish campaign there of 1609-10, but after that little is known of him until his death in Sweden in October 1618. He had five children, four of whom survived him. Both of his sons, Anders the younger and David, became gentlemen of the chamber of Gustavus Adolphus. Stuart's wife died in March 1622 and they were both buried in Vadsbro church. Stuart's brother Andrew (Anders) Stuart (c.1570-1640) also entered Swedish service and became a colonel. They were the first Stewarts known to have emigrated to Sweden in the sixteenth century.

John Smythson (d. 1634) was old enough to work as a mason at Wollaton in 1588, his first documented appearance. In the 1590s he was working with his father; in 1597 they are recorded as visiting Hardwick together, when payments of $1 to 'Mr Smythson the surveyor' and 10's'. to 'his son' underline the hierarchy of the relationship. He was still living at Wollaton when he married Margaret Newton of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, in December 1600. He probably continued to work with his father into the new century. But by 1608, if not before, he had moved from Wollaton into the orbit of the Cavendish family, to work for Sir Charles Cavendish, and later for his son William, the future duke of Newcastle upon Tyne. He remained in their service (and lived in houses belonging to them) until his death in 1634. Although he accepted commissions from other clients, the bulk of his work was for the Cavendishes, including additions and alterations at Welbeck Abbey, the virtual rebuilding of Bolsover Castle, Derbyshire, from 1612, a new house at Slingsby Castle, Yorkshire ('c'.1630), and work as land surveyor and estate bailiff, not unlike that which his father had carried out for the Willoughbys. It was probably the Cavendishes who sent him on trips to London and the south in 1609 and 1618-19, on which he made valuable survey drawings of buildings and gardens in London and elsewhere. For them he also evolved a distinctively personal style of ornament and detail, of which just a few survivals remain at Welbeck but which is still gloriously abundant at Bolsover. His later work, at Bolsover, Slingsby, and in a fine chimneypiece at Clifton House, Nottingham, shows the influence of the German designer Wendel Dietterlin.

Goddard, Joseph (1840-1900), architect, was born on 11 April 1840 in Leicester, the younger of the two children of Henry Goddard (1792-1868) and his wife, Ann, 'nee' Gardiner (1806-1885). He is the best-known figure in a dynasty of local architects spanning six generations, still in practice at the end of the twentieth century, and the longest-surviving in Britain in a father-to-son line. His grandfather Joseph (1751-1839) had migrated, as a young man, some 5 miles from Kirby Muxloe to Leicester, where he prospered as a carpenter, builder, and property speculator. By 1827 he and his son Henry were styling themselves 'architects' as well as 'surveyors' and 'appraisers'. The architectural side of the practice increased and, by the time the younger Joseph was established, the family's professionalization was complete. 
Goddard was educated at Mr Packer's school in Nottingham, which specialized in technical training, before being articled to his father in 1856. He became a partner in 1862. He greatly increased the output of the practice and capitalized on the boom in church building and restoration. His most notable achievement in the 1860s was Tur Langton church, Leicestershire (1865-6), which shows the strong influence of G. E. Street's important St James-the-Less, Pimlico (1859-61). Much of this church work was in the prime hunting country of south Leicestershire, where he also developed a thriving practice for houses and stables. 
On 6 October 1864 Goddard married Annie Wright (1839-1933) from Pontefract, Yorkshire, whose connections provided a commission for the church and parsonage at nearby Skelbrooke (1871-2). This was one of the few jobs outside Leicestershire where the volume of work available meant that, like many other provincial architects, he had little need to seek commissions elsewhere. An active social life brought him into contact with potential clients in town and country, and success in the Leicester clock tower competition (1868), followed by the impressive Gothic premises of the Leicestershire Banking Company (1872-4) in Granby Street, sealed his reputation. 
In 1871 Goddard became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and in 1874 he took on a partner, A. H. Paget (1848-1909). The practice prospered and in 1886 Goddard moved from Beausite, a spacious house he built in 1875-6, to an even larger residence, Knighton Spinneys in the leafy suburb of Stoneygate, where he built numerous houses for Leicester's successful middle classes. The 1880s produced two of the practice's most striking Leicester buildings, Melbourne Hall (1880-81), a large octagon based on the Union Chapel in London, and St John the Baptist (1884-5), probably Goddard's best work, an ingenious reinterpretation of J. L. Pearson's great church of St Augustine, Kilburn, London. 
In 1888 Henry Langton Goddard (1866-1944), the second of Joseph's six children, became a partner and, like his father a quarter of a century before, brought new dynamism to the practice. The firm followed the trend of the time by providing well-designed buildings in a great variety of styles. Joseph's success was epitomized by his move about 1898 to the Manor House at Newton Harcourt, south of Leicester. Here he died of apoplexy on 10 October 1900, aged sixty.

Abraham, Roy Clive (1890-1963), scholar of African languages and colonial administrator, was born on 16 December 1890 in Melbourne, Australia. From a Jewish background, he studied at University College, London, preparatory school, at Clifton College, Bristol, and also at various establishments in Germany. From 1923 to 1924 he was a Brassey scholar (in Italian) at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first-class honours degree in oriental languages (Arabic and Persian); he was prepared to be examined in Ethiopic (his proficiency stemming from a study period at Leipzig University in 1920) but no examiner could be found. In 1927 Abraham took a certificate in anthropology from University College, London, and a diploma in (classical) Arabic from the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, in 1930. 
During the First World War and its aftermath (1914-23), Abraham saw British army service in Arabia and on the north-western frontier with the Indian army, where he acquired a working knowledge of Hindustani. His first experience of sub-Saharan Africa was in 1925, when he entered the administrative service of the northern provinces of Nigeria; he continued in the service until 1944, working initially as an administrative officer and (acting) government anthropological officer. His wife, Sadie, lived with him in Nigeria, and they had one son, Donald. 
Sometimes difficult and temperamental, Abraham's relations with colleagues, then and later, often proved to be turbulent. Nevertheless, he was almost immediately seconded on a six-year language research project to Bauchi province in north-eastern Nigeria, and it was there, in 1926, that he conducted his first independent linguistic study of an African language, working on Bole (Bolanci), a west Chadic (Afro-Asian) language. He then assisted G. P. Bargery in the compilation of the latter's monumental and authoritative 'Hausa-English Dictionary' (1934). Abraham learned about the role of contrastive tone in west African languages from Bargery, and in his 'Principles of Hausa' (1934) he simplified Bargery's six-tone system to the correct three-tone system for Hausa. 
This was an especially productive period for Abraham, and he published yet more pedagogically-motivated works, including 'The Grammar of Tiv' (1933) and 'The Principles of Idoma' (1935), the first detailed linguistic description of an eastern Kwa language. Although the quality of his prolific output varied, and was sometimes abstruse, Abraham's grammars and dictionaries represented major descriptive and analytical contributions to the study of African languages. In 1941-2, during the Second World War, he taught Hausa to soldiers in the Royal West African Frontier Force, after which he served in Ethiopia, teaching Amharic and Somali. Later in the war he was based in Kenya, South Africa, France, and Italy, and with the British military mission in Moscow, completing his military career with the rank of major. 
In 1945 Abraham was awarded a Leverhulme research fellowship to research the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea (including Amharic and Ge'ez). In 1946 he was frustrated in his attempt to succeed Bargery as lecturer in Hausa at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London. His relationship with Bargery had become increasingly strained since their collaboration on Bargery's 1934 Hausa dictionary, and Abraham was of the opinion that Bargery had actively hindered his appointment. Relations were at such a low ebb that Abraham felt compelled to complain to the director of SOAS about Bargery's presence on the selection board, at the same time apologizing for his behaviour. Subsequently appointed to a new lectureship in Amharic, Abraham held the post from 1948 until he retired in 1951. During this same period he also taught Tigrinya and began research into Berber, Oromo, and Somali. In 1949 he was awarded the degree of DLitt by the University of Oxford on the basis of three of his published works on Tiv. 
Further works by Abraham included his 'Dictionary of the Hausa Language' (with Mai Kano), which was published in 1949; and in 1951 'The Principles of Somali' (with Solomon Warsama) appeared in mimeograph form. In 1952, Abraham embarked on a study of Yoruba, having made his own way to Ibadan, Nigeria. This led to his 'Dictionary of Modern Yoruba' (1958). Beset by diabetes and ill health in the later stages of his life, Abraham's dogged determination and intellectual curiosity drove him to do further research on Igbo, and he was close to completing a dictionary and grammar when he died from a coronary thrombosis and stroke at his home, 11 West View, Hendon, on 22 June 1963 at the age of seventy-two. He was survived by his wife and son. A key figure in African language scholarship during the twentieth century, Abraham worked for over thirty years on a wide range of disparate languages in the Afro-Asian family, as well as in Niger-Congo. A commemorative volume in honour of his outstanding contribution to the understanding of African languages was published in 1992.

Awolowo, Obafemi (1909-1987), politician in Nigeria, was born on 6 March 1909 at Ikenne, a small town about 40 miles from Lagos, in Ijebu Remo division, the son of David Sopolu Awolowo (died 1920) and his wife, Mary Sofowora Efunyela. The Ijebu are a subgroup of the Yoruba, one of the largest and most developed peoples of Nigeria. His father, a farmer and timber dealer, had become a Christian in 1896, one of the first converts in the town, and Obafemi, his eldest son, was baptized Jeremiah (a name he later stopped using). Awolowo's education, begun in local mission schools, was disrupted when his father died suddenly of smallpox in 1920, and he went to live with his maternal grandmother in the much larger town of Abeokuta, where he worked at odd jobs to pay for more education. In 1927 he spent a year at Wesley College, Ibadan. Returning to Abeokuta in 1928, he worked as a junior teacher and took correspondence courses in commercial subjects. After a spell as a typist in Lagos and a period of unemployment, he returned to Wesley College as its clerk, all the while taking further courses, now in law and journalism, which would enable him to pursue his ambition to go to England and qualify as a lawyer. Shortage of funds, however, meant that more than a decade passed -- occupied in journalism, public letter-writing, moneylending, motor transporting, and produce trading -- before he could realize it. In 1944 he finally got to London, took the degree of LLB, and was admitted to the bar as a member of the Inner Temple. Back in Nigeria in 1947, he at once set up a lucrative legal practice, based in the Yoruba metropolis, Ibadan. 
Awolowo's nationalism first showed itself in his attitude of resistance to authority at Wesley College and in his rejection for a number of years of the Christianity in which he had been reared for an agnostic rationalism inspired by the writings of Tom Paine, T. H. Huxley, and Robert G. Ingersoll. It started to take on a more political shape after he became active in the Nigerian Youth Movement, founded in 1934, which was the first nationalist organization to seek to promote itself outside the capital, Lagos. In the 1930s, too, Awolowo became, as he put it, 'a fanatical admirer' (Awolowo, 'Awo', 160) of the Indian National Congress. While in London, Awolowo helped to found Egbe Omo Oduduwa (Society of the Descendants of Oduduwa), a Yoruba cultural organization which would play a key role in shaping Yoruba political consciousness. In his 'Path to Nigerian Freedom' (1947) Awolowo argued that only a federal constitution could accommodate the diversity of Nigeria's languages and cultures. 
After 1947 Nigeria's division into three highly autonomous regions -- Northern, Western, and Eastern -- each dominated by one of the three largest ethnic groups -- respectively Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo -- as well as personal rivalries, led to a fragmentation of the nationalist movement. In 1950, with the first national elections looming, Awolowo, with other associates in the Egbe Omo Oduduwa, formed a Yoruba-based party, the Action Group (AG). After the AG had won the 1951 election in Western Nigeria, Awolowo became leader of its government (premier from 1954) for the next eight years. With the region's buoyant cocoa revenues the AG government was able to achieve many of its goals, notably the introduction of free primary education, expanded medical services, and extensive infrastructural investment. Though the AG proclaimed itself as 'democratic socialist', its reality was more elitist and welfarist. Awolowo's concern to improve the lot of the 'common man' went with an assumption that the educated elite must give social direction to the whole, and he always showed much respect for the traditional Yoruba hierarchy of 'oba' ('kings') and chiefs. In any case, AG policies worked in practice to consolidate a new 'bourgeois' class, based on an alliance of commercial wealth, educated status, and access to the levers of state power. 
When Nigeria became independent in 1960 Awolowo faced an acute political dilemma. While his party ruled the Western Region, control of the federal government fell to a coalition of its two main rivals, the northern-based Northern People's Congress (NPC) and the eastern-based National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons. Awolowo had struggled to throw off the AG's image as a 'Yoruba' party by vigorous campaigning for support among ethnic minority groups in the other two regions, and he now chose to move to the centre as federal leader of the opposition, leaving his deputy, S. L. Akintola, to succeed him as premier of the Western Region. By 1962 a split had developed within the party between Awolowo and a 'radical' wing which wanted to push opposition at the centre, and a 'conservative' faction under Akintola, which wanted to secure its position in the west by coming to terms with the other two parties. By moving to the centre, Awolowo had weakened his regional power base, and his opponents moved to strike him down. A federal commission of inquiry found much evidence of corruption in the AG's management of the Western Region, and in 1963 Awolowo was imprisoned for allegedly plotting to overthrow the federal government by force. His prestige among his fellow Yoruba rose to new heights during his imprisonment (1963-6), when he was widely seen in terms of an almost Christ-like archetype as the 'suffering servant' of his people, unjustly treated and excluded from power. 
The military coup of 1966 cleared the way for Awolowo's release from prison. When the former Eastern Region attempted to secede from Nigeria as the republic of Biafra, thus precipitating the civil war of 1967 to 1970, Awolowo's stance was at first thought to be equivocal, but he rallied for the integrity of Nigeria. He was brought into the government of General Yakubu Gowon, serving as vice-chairman of the federal executive council and finance minister until 1971, when he retired to private life and his law practice. 
With the prospect of a return to civilian rule in the late 1970s, Awolowo's political ambition resurfaced: he became the leader and presidential candidate of the United Party of Nigeria (UPN), essentially a revival of the AG, with its main base of support among the Yoruba. In the 1979 presidential election, however, Awolowo lost to Shehu Shagari, the candidate of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN), whose core was drawn from the former northern-based NPC. Awolowo had again failed to build a broad enough alliance with non-Yoruba groups. After Shagari and the NPN defeated Awolowo's UPN in 1983 (in an election fraudulent even by Nigerian standards), only to be displaced by a further military coup, Awolowo's public career was all but over. He died on 9 May 1987, survived by his wife, and was buried in his home town, Ikenne. Subsequently, by federal decree, the University of Ife, whose foundation had been one of the most cherished projects of the AG, was renamed Obafemi Awolowo University. 
Throughout his political career Awolowo received unstinting support from his wife, Hannah Idowu Dideolu Adelana, whom he had married on 26 December 1937; they had two sons and two daughters. The death in a motor accident in 1963, during his trial, of his elder son, Segun, then starting out on a legal career, was a severe blow to Awolowo. By then he had abandoned his youthful agnosticism and had become rather pious, regularly attending Agbeni Methodist Church in Ibadan and St Saviour's Anglican Church at Ikenne. Awolowo came to regard himself as in some sense divinely mandated in his political career, and his practices of ascetic self-discipline gave, in the eyes of many, a spiritual dimension to his leadership. He was perhaps the most revered and the most detested of the Nigerian politicians of his time. While opponents might see him as inflexible and self-righteous, untrustworthy, and something of an Ijebu or Yoruba chauvinist, his intelligence, clarity of vision, and firmness of purpose, and the forceful lucidity of his speeches and writings gained him a devoted following.

Balme, David Mowbray (1912-1989), university administrator and classical scholar, was born on 8 September 1912 at Carlisle, eldest of the four children of Harold Balme (1878-1953), a surgeon, and his wife, Hilda Carr (died 1968). He spent his first ten years in China, while his father was professor of surgery at Cheeloo (Qilu) University. He was educated at Marlborough College and at Clare College, Cambridge (1931-4), where he gained first class honours in both parts of the classical tripos. He then embarked on research into ancient Greek philosophy and science, spending 1934-6 with Julius Stenzel at the University of Halle. This led in 1939 and 1940 to two trail-blazing articles on Greek science, and to a lifelong concern with the scientific works of Aristotle. On 29 December 1936 he married Beatrice Margaret Rice, and they had four sons and a daughter. 
After two terms as a lecturer at Reading University, Balme returned to Cambridge in 1937, first winning a research fellowship at Clare, and then (1940) as a fellow of Jesus College. However, his academic progress was almost immediately interrupted by his call-up into the Royal Air Force. He qualified so well as a pilot that his initial employment was as a flying instructor. But he wanted a more active part in the war and was eventually allowed to convert to fly four-engined Lancaster bombers. With the newly commissioned Balme's arrival in 207 squadron at the end of March 1943 there began a remarkably illustrious wartime RAF career. By August, outstanding courage and determination had brought him an immediate DFC, exceptional promotion to squadron leader, and appointment as flight commander. Four months later, having completed thirty-one operations, many of them outstandingly successful, he was made DSO. Balme then served for a time in the Air Ministry, but by the end of the war he was again on active service as a wing commander commanding Lancaster squadrons. 
By the end of 1945 Balme was back in Cambridge as tutor, soon senior tutor, at Jesus College. This experience combined with his scholarship and wartime leadership to make him an ideal candidate for recruitment to lead one of the university colleges then being set up to help in the post-war development of Britain's tropical colonies. Balme initially resisted this, but in 1948 he accepted a five-year contract to be the founding principal of the university college in the Gold Coast. There he set out to build a university institution of the very highest standard. To Balme this meant something which would in due course stand comparison with the University of Cambridge. He quickly sought to move away from the professor-dominated system of government originally provided for his college to a collegiate form in which all dons would have a voice, and he gave priority in the building programme to the construction of pleasant residences which were home to dons as well as students. He resisted any charge, whether from layman or academic, Ghanaian or Briton, that his institution was inappropriate for Africa, or that it was too expensive, and continued to pursue his goal with the same single-minded determination with which he had once conducted bombing raids into Germany and Italy. But as the colonial Gold Coast began to turn into the independent state of Ghana, so there was increased competition for development funds, and so less opportunity for Balme to mould his university as he thought best. After his first five years Balme was made a CMG in 1955, but he found a second five-year contract appreciably less attractive. Already a committed Christian, he was now received into the Roman Catholic church. He was disappointed by the refusal of his colleagues to accept his bold view that his college should become a full university, free from the guiding reins of London University with which it had set out, before it became open to the political whims of an independent Ghanaian state, so when in October 1957 a senior classics post became available at Queen Mary College, University of London, he decided the time had come to return to the teaching and research which had become increasingly squeezed out of his life. 
In 1964 Balme was elected professor of classics at Queen Mary College, and he continued in this post until his retirement in 1978, building up a reputation as a formidable and much loved teacher, and producing publications relating to Aristotle's scientific works that won international renown. In addition to pioneering articles, these included annotated translations of 'De partibus animalium I' and 'De generatione animalium I' (1972), and the posthumous edition of and commentary on the 'Historia animalium' (1991). In 1966 he made his home at Gumley in the Leicestershire countryside, where fox-hunting became a major enjoyment alongside his lifelong pursuit of music. There, on 23 February 1989, he died of a brain tumour; he was buried on 2 March in the local churchyard. He was survived by his wife.

Bargery, George Percy (1876-1966), missionary and Hausa scholar, was born on 1 October 1876 at 7 Oxford Terrace, St James Road, Exeter, the son of George Thomas Bargery, commercial traveller, and his wife, Ellen Dawes. Educated in Exeter and at the University of London, he was ordained in the Church of England in 1900, and joined the Church Missionary Society, who sent him to Northern Nigeria. His first wife, Nina (died 1932), whom he married in 1906, was with him in Nigeria until 1910 when she returned to Britain. His second marriage, on 11 April 1940, to Minnie Jane Martin, a retired headmistress aged sixty-five who had worked in Nigeria, lasted until her death in 1953. He had at least one son. 
An early uncompleted medical training stood Bargery in good stead in his daily life in Nigeria. Lord Lugard's annual report on Northern Nigeria submitted to the British government for 1905-6 recognized Bargery's medical skills and his remarkable fortitude, saying of him: 'during an outbreak of sickness at Rimmo Mr Bargery saved the lives of over 80 persons, and the thanks of the Government were conveyed to this gentleman for having ridden on a bicycle 65 miles in one day to attend an officer of the West African Frontier Force. Having been overtaken by darkness, he spent the night in a tree in pouring rain. (Lugard, 469)' Bargery's major achievement, however -- leading to his later appointment at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London -- was the compilation of a dictionary of the Hausa language. This endeavour was entrusted to him by the governor of Nigeria, Sir Hugh Clifford, and he worked on it for some five years in the company of a group of Hausa scholars in Kano led by the intrepid Malam Mahmudu Koki. First published in 1934 after fourteen years of work, the dictionary remains an astonishing achievement, with 52,000 entries complete with tone patterns and detailed commentary upon meanings, synonyms, near-synonyms, dialectal variants, and specialized usages. In addition to a team of Hausa scholars, the colonial government of Nigeria seconded a gifted and trained linguist, Captain R. C. Abraham, to assist in the project over some two years. Neither Bargery nor his Hausa colleagues were trained linguists, and it is said that Bargery asked his new assistant to go through the trays of cards that had already been prepared and check for consistency. Alarmed at the growing pile of entries being rooted out, Bargery and his Hausa colleagues resolved their dilemma by returning after the day's work had been concluded, and all had retired to their various quarters, to reinsert by candlelight the items removed (private information). 
After retirement from the Church Missionary Society, Bargery became a teacher and scholar of Hausa (1930-47) at SOAS; he was made reader in Hausa in 1937. He was awarded the degree of DLitt at the University of London in 1937, and was made an OBE in 1957. A close colleague described Bargery as 'intensely practical, forthright and down-to-earth, a stickler for order and punctuality, a hater of cant and humbug and on moral issues uncompromising' (Parsons, 490). His sense of humour was 'immense, earthy, and sometimes bordering on the macabre' (ibid.). He was a great storyteller, every tale being relived and dramatized, 'and he would end up with tears of laughter streaming down his mobile face, his deep-throated chuckles reverberating around the Common Room' (ibid.). 
In retirement from SOAS Bargery accepted an invitation from the British and Foreign Bible Society to advise on a new translation of the 'Bible' into Hausa, and from 1953 to 1959 he lived and worked in Kano, leaving at the age of eighty-two. He also continued to be a teacher and examiner of Hausa on Devonshire courses for the colonial service at Oxford and Cambridge. Progress in the service was dependent upon a growing mastery of local languages, a condition laid down by Lord Lugard in the early years of the colonial administration, and through his dictionary and other language materials, Bargery made an invaluable contribution to the efficiency of colonial administration. 
Bargery died on 2 August 1966 at his home, Little Redlands, Cow Lane, Tring, Hertfordshire. His obituarist in the SOAS 'Bulletin' praised his contribution to Hausa scholarship but also noted that he had been held in great affection by the many Nigerians who knew him: 'Bargery will be best remembered as a great lover of Nigeria, and of all peoples and things Nigerian -- of the Tiv as much as of the Hausa... and all its other peoples too -- Christian, Muslim, pagan alike. To him they were all 'brothers and sisters in God', and he accorded them that respect for their 'mutunci' (human dignity) which so endeared him to them. (Parsons, 493)'

Fraser, Alexander Garden (1873-1962), educationist and missionary, was born on 6 October 1873 at Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, the son of Sir Andrew Henderson Leith Fraser KCSI (1848-1919), of the Indian Civil Service, and his first wife, Agnes Archibald (died 1879) of Tillicoultry; his grandfather the Revd A. G. Fraser was a Presbyterian missionary in India for sixty years and his father while in the Indian Civil Service also served as moderator of the Presbyterian church assembly in India. Fraser was educated at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh and at Edinburgh University and Trinity College, Oxford. At Oxford in 1892, with his friends J. H. Oldham, W. E. S. Holland, and Temple Gairdner, he pledged himself to become a missionary under the influence of the visiting evangelists J. R. Mott and R. E. Speer who were campaigning for 'The evangelization of the world in this generation' (E. A. Livingstone, 'The Evangelization of the World in this Generation', 1900). On graduating he worked with the Student Volunteer Missionary Union in which he fell in love with a Cambridge student, Beatrice Glass (1873-1970), who was committed to work with the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in Uganda. The Presbyterian Fraser impetuously became an Anglican, joined the CMS and followed his fiancee in 1900 to Uganda where they were married in the following year. They had two sons and three daughters. 
In Uganda characteristics of Fraser's later educational policies emerged. He encouraged his pupils to undertake manual labour by leading them through the swamplands, carrying mud on his head, to the building site of the new cathedral. He persuaded the CMS, despite the reluctance of some colleagues, to establish Kings School, Budo, as an elite secondary boarding-school for sons of chiefs and future ordinands with a resident European staff. Before he could take charge of this project he had to return to Britain in 1903 on the breakdown of his wife's health and to a lesser extent of his own. He next took a course in theology at New College, Edinburgh. One of the few overseas posts of the CMS to which the doctors would now allow his wife to accompany him was in the highlands of Ceylon. In 1904 Fraser was appointed principal of the society's Trinity College, Kandy, and held the position until 1924. 
At the time of Fraser's arrival the college was suffering from severe absenteeism and breakdown of discipline. There had been six principals in four years. Fraser revived the college by raising money to enable personally handpicked graduates from Oxford and Cambridge to be recruited to the staff. Prefects were appointed, staff became resident, and a community spirit was fostered through social service schemes in which staff and students together built shelters for rickshaw pullers, visited hospitals, and made a social survey of the Kandy slums which shamed the authorities into action. More controversially Fraser introduced study of the vernacular languages at the expense of Latin, Greek, and French. He was eventually ordained as a priest in the Church of England at the age of forty-two but was rebuked by the Anglican bishop for allowing ministers of other denominations to preach at the school. His modernization of the curriculum, his ecumenical practices, his love of horseplay, and his expressed sympathy for the aspirations of Ceylonese nationalists scandalized many other missionaries, sixty of whom petitioned the CMS for his recall. Though a candidate, he failed to be appointed bishop of Colombo. 
His tenure was interrupted by service with the YMCA and as an army chaplain in France during the First World War. After returning to Trinity he served as chairman of a commission on village education which visited India in 1919. During this investigation he was highly critical of European missionaries for having failed to protest against the massacre of Amritsar. 
In 1924, at the suggestion of his brother-in-law J. H. Oldham, Fraser was appointed the first principal of the government secondary school at Achimota in the Gold Coast. This was the favourite project of the colony's governor, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, who saw it as the key to the training of local people who would eventually take over all government posts from expatriates. Before setting out Fraser preached a sermon in Westminster Abbey attacking the Kenya government so fiercely for its oppression of African labour that the Kenya legislature adjourned in protest against such misuse of the abbey's pulpit. While this incident could have jeopardized his appointment, it was probably a calculated indiscretion to demonstrate that, although he would be a government official as principal of Achimota, his sympathies were with African aspirations. 
Fraser took with him on his staff the well-known African-American educationist J. E. K. Aggrey who did much to win the support of African nationalists. This support was continued after Aggrey's death when Fraser persuaded the government to make Achimota an independent institution with a governing body of which Africans were members. As at Trinity, he brought in talented Oxford and Cambridge graduates and on their arrival made them study local languages and culture. Here too he introduced the practice of voluntary social service in the community. The college became co-educational and its activities included not only arts and science but also agriculture and engineering; it came to provide a full ladder from infant education to external university degrees. When later Gold Coast became the first British colony in Africa to achieve independence, many of its ministers and senior civil servants were Achimotans. Fraser, however, alienated his most important ally, Guggisberg, by getting hold of a government file in a department which had nothing to do with Achimota and writing a pungent minute in it. In 1926 and 1927 he visited Nigeria to report to the government on the state of education there. His report was so critical and trenchantly phrased that it was not published. With Guggisberg he wrote 'The Future of the Negro Race', published in London in 1929. 
Fraser left Achimota in 1935. He spent an uncomfortable period as warden of a new adult education centre, Newbattle Abbey, in Dalkeith, Scotland, from 1937 to 1940, as his powers were restricted by his governing body. Intermittently between 1940 and 1948 he served as assistant chaplain of Gordonstoun School, warmly sympathizing with the ideas of its founder, Kurt Hahn. From 1941 to 1943 he was principal of an American Quaker teacher training college, Highgate, in Jamaica. Here again, though he won the affection of his students and staff, he had an uneasy relationship with his governing body. Returning to England, he served in 1944-6 as curate at Goring by Sea, where his son-in-law was the incumbent. His final enthusiasm was for the Moral Re-Armament movement in whose house in Berkeley Square, London, he spent his last years. 
Fraser was widely recognized as the greatest colonial headmaster of his time. He was deeply religious, though to the dismay of some of his fellow missionaries he saw his duty not as to proselytise but rather to help to bring in the kingdom of God by whatever means. Christianity he saw as linked to national independence, and high-quality educational institutions as a prelude to decolonization. He was a resolute and successful opponent of the colour bar. His charisma inspired devotion and admiration from staff and pupils but his impulsiveness and fiery temper limited his wider influence. He was openly contemptuous of officialdom and used to quote Kierkegaard to the effect that there is nothing so repellent to God as an official because God is personal and the official is a negation of personality, though in 1930 he accepted the appointment as CBE. In a sermon in Oxford in 1940 Fraser compared the British treatment of Africans in the Rhodes era with that of the Poles and Jews by Hitler. Yet in retirement he was surprised by and resented his exclusion from committees which advised the colonial secretary on educational policies. 
Fraser was a handsome man and at his most charming when silently expressing his regret for his impulsive and wounding utterances, though he hated to apologize in words. A colleague, Lord Hemingford, described him as an imperious democrat, a romantic realist, a hard hitting mystic, and irrepressibly naughty (BBC interview 1962). Fraser died aged eighty-nine in Trinity House Nursing Home, 26 Church Road, St Leonards, Sussex, on 27 January 1962.

Ross, Sylvia Hope Leith- (1884-1980), anthropologist and writer, was born on 30 September 1884 in London, the second daughter and last of three children of Admiral William Fitzherbert Ruxton (1831-1895) of the Royal Navy and his American wife, Sylvia Howland Grinnell, whose parents came from leading Boston and New York families. After Admiral Ruxton's death in 1895, when Sylvia was twelve, Mrs Ruxton settled in Paris. Although raised a protestant, Sylvia attended a convent school for a year, until her older sister was expelled; she then went to a finishing school in Fontainebleau. Her brother, Upton Fitzherbert Ruxton, an army officer ten years her senior, served under Sir Frederick Lugard in the newly established British protectorate of Northern Nigeria. He befriended and brought home on leave a young Canadian officer, Arthur Leith-Ross, who became engaged to Sylvia. In 1907, when the married couple set off for Zungeru, where he was chief transport officer of the protectorate, she was one of the few British wives permitted to accompany their husbands to Northern Nigeria. A year later he died of blackwater fever. She noted succinctly in her memoirs, 'Of our party of five who had sailed from Liverpool thirteen months before, I was the only one left' (Leith-Ross, 58). 
During this first brief stay Sylvia Leith-Ross developed a deep attachment to Nigeria and, as a widow for the next seventy years, she dedicated herself to various projects among its peoples. In 1910 she gained permission to stay with her brother, who was in charge of Muri province on the River Benue. With his French wife, she compiled a cookbook, 'Practical West African Cookery' (1908), which was published locally, went into several editions, and gained a reputation as 'a permanent contribution to the well-being of young bachelors new to the country, its greatest value being its emphasis on the value of local foods' (Smith, 8). During this visit, and again in 1913, she collected materials on the Fulani language in various parts of Northern Nigeria and, in the interval, attended the Ecole des Langues Orientales in Paris. Her 'Fulani Grammar' (1921), published after the First World War, included texts and translations of Fulani folk-tales and brief vocabularies, both English-Fulani and Fulani-English. When the war broke out, she volunteered with the French Red Cross and worked for the duration in military hospitals. She returned to London and for the next five years, from 1920 to 1925, worked as secretary of the Tavistock Clinic under its founder, H. Crichton-Miller, who wrote, 'without her the Clinic would never have seen the light of day' (Crowder, 17). 
Sylvia Leith-Ross returned to Nigeria in 1925, when her brother became lieutenant-governor of the southern provinces in Lagos. Recruited by the education service as its first lady superintendent of education, she helped to set up Queen's College in Lagos, advised the government of Northern Nigeria on the prospects for women's education in Ilorin, and became founding headmistress of the girls' centre in Kano before being invalided home in 1931. Her next project, supported by a Leverhulme research fellowship, came in response to the 'women's war' of 1929. Sparked by rumours of impending taxation, women throughout eastern Nigeria rose in a mass movement to express their grievances and protest against various impositions of British rule, including specific warrant chiefs who abused their power. Misunderstandings on both sides led to violence; at several locations, British-led police and troops fired on the crowd, leaving a total of more than fifty women dead and fifty wounded (Gailey, 125; Afigbo, 241). To understand these women's views, Leith-Ross conducted an anthropological survey of their lives and their attitudes to change brought about by the colonial presence. Her resulting book, 'African Women: a Study of the Ibo of Nigeria' (1939), concluded that the notable economic power and organizational abilities of these women had not been understood and in the future must be taken into account in the framing of new legislation or the creation of new social or economic situations. She gave engaging vignettes of people and incidents during her investigations in Igbo Ora in two books of memoirs, 'African Conversation Piece' (1944) and 'Beyond the Niger' (1951). 
During the Spanish Civil War, Sylvia Leith-Ross went to Perpignan to care for refugees and, with the onset of the Second World War, worked in French military hospitals until the fall of France to the Germans. She expressed her love for France in her memoir 'Cocks in the Dawn' (1944), relating her experiences there since childhood. The remaining years of the war she spent in Nigeria working with the Political and Economic Research Organization, which, among other intelligence duties, monitored activities in the Vichy-ruled French colonies immediately adjacent to Nigeria. Her final project in Nigeria, begun when she was over seventy and continuing for a decade (1956-66), took her on bush roads throughout the country to collect pottery while it was still a vital enterprise in rural economies. This work resulted in a magnificent exhibition at the Nigerian Museum in Jos and a book, 'Nigerian Pottery' (1970), with photographs and detailed explanatory material about the craftwork of Nigerian potters, both men and women. In 1966 she was made an MBE for her work. 
Sylvia Leith-Ross's last visit to Nigeria took place in 1968, sixty-one years after her arrival in the country as a young wife. She lived in a convent during her last years. She died at the age of ninety-five, on 12 February 1980, at 67 Holland Park, London. Although her amateur ventures in linguistics and anthropology have become dated, her painstaking collection of Nigerian pottery stands as an enduring record of a disappearing art. Her autobiography, 'Stepping Stones: Memoirs of Colonial Nigeria, 1907-1960', published posthumously in 1983, gives candid insights into her experience during her years in Nigeria. It provides an unusual record of British involvement in Nigeria, from the perspective of a woman holding colonial ideals but not uncritical of colonial society and what she considered its shortcomings.

Mair, Lucy Philip (1901-1986), social anthropologist, was born on 28 January 1901 at Banstead, Surrey, the eldest of four children of David Beveridge Mair (1868-1942) and his wife, Jessy (later Janet) Thomson Philip (1876-1959). Her father was a former mathematics fellow at Christ's College, Cambridge, who had moved on marriage to the civil service commission. Her mother was the daughter of a successful and educated Dundee builder. Lucy Mair referred in later life to her 'awful' family (La Fontaine, interview, 1983): her father was taciturn, her mother dominating and fond of society. From 1906 William Beveridge was a constant visitor to his cousin's house, and lived as a neighbour when in 1913 the Mairs moved to Campden Hill Gardens, Kensington. In 1914 David Mair became an Admiralty cryptographer and was responsible for breaking the coded messages that led to the arrest of Sir Roger Casement. Jessy joined William Beveridge in the Ministry of Munitions, moving with him to the Ministry of Food (where she rose to become director of bacon) and, after the war, to the London School of Economics where she became secretary and Beveridge became director. In 1933 David Mair retired from the civil service commission and thereafter hardly ever lived at home except for occasional visits. He died on 21 July 1942; six months later Jessy and William married. 
William Beveridge had befriended Lucy and her sister Marjory: he took them rock-climbing, and went on a walking tour with Lucy. When Lucy was introduced to music by Gustav Holst, then teaching at St Paul's Girls' School, William gave her a silver flute. (A. A. Uthwatt, also a family friend, had given her a wooden one shortly before.) People gossiped about the Mairs' domestic arrangements, and about William's intimacy within the family, but relations were not conventionally immoral. William was clearly taken aback by the suggestion of one of the daughters on the day of David's funeral that he should marry Jessy; and it is unlikely that Beveridge had a physical relationship with Lucy's mother even after their marriage. 
Lucy Mair was educated at St Paul's Girls' School in London, and then at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read the classical tripos, graduating in 1922. She was employed for five years by Gilbert Murray as his secretary-assistant in League of Nations affairs. In 1927 she joined her mother and future stepfather at the London School of Economics, holding a lecturership in international relations. The school has no record of any discussion about the propriety of that appointment. Audrey Richards introduced Mair to B. Malinowski's seminar in anthropology because her work (on mandated territories) involved Africa, and Richards thought that no one could understand Africa unless they understood anthropology. Mair impressed the ebullient Malinowski, but she probably never succumbed to his undoubted charm. She remained a sceptical admirer, with deep reservations about his ideas, throughout her life. He nevertheless arranged for her to go to Buganda to do fieldwork, with a Rockefeller grant. Mair later thought that he had wished to protect her from the influence of A. R. Radcliffe-Brown who was to teach at the school while Malinowski was on leave. She spent nine months in Buganda, fieldwork that resulted in her first anthropological work, 'An African People in the Twentieth Century' (1934). Returning to the London School of Economics in the early 1930s, she was a member of the group that included E. E. Evans-Pritchard, R. Firth, M. Fortes, M. Gluckman, A. Richards, and I. Schapera, as well as S. F. Nadel and, later, Edmund Leach. It was a stimulating though not always harmonious group, some of the members later dominating British social anthropology, and profoundly influential in America. 
Mair continued to teach, taking responsibility for the courses intended to train colonial administrators; the students, at first mostly former members of the British army, later included talented young local nationals from the colonies themselves. Funding was eventually removed: the local students were to go to residential universities where they were thought to be less exposed to radical ideas. Mair also had a reputation, not justified, for believing that Africans were always right, and for being fierce, which may be: until the end of her life she was formidable in conversation, her vehement cleverness sometimes amplified by social awkwardness. 
During the Second World War, Mair served in the Royal Institute for International Affairs and at the Foreign Office. On her return to the London School of Economics she was seconded to Canberra to teach members of the Australian military administration of Papua New Guinea. She had two spells there, and wrote 'Australia in New Guinea' (1948), with an updated version a few years later. In 1947 she was promoted reader in colonial administration, changing the title to applied anthropology in 1955. She influenced a wide range of pupils at the school, from the young men in the colonial administrators' course to her BA and PhD students in social anthropology from the 1950s. She became professor in 1963, and taught at the universities of Durham and Kent after her retirement in 1968. 
Mair's early publications (many collected in 'Studies in Applied Anthropology', published in 1957, and 'Anthropology and Social Change' which appeared in 1969) were concerned with the technical problems of colonial administration and with explaining the aims and achievements of anthropologists to an audience of administrators. 'New Nations' (1963), 'The New Africa' (1967), and 'Anthropology and Development' (1984) summarized and consolidated that work, making it accessible to students and administrators. In the post-war years she began a series of short volumes based on her lectures: 'Primitive Government' (1962), 'Witchcraft' (1969), and 'Marriage' (1971). In 1972 she published her 'Introduction to Social Anthropology' which was still in print twenty-five years later. She was scornful of colleagues who would only write specialist work for an audience of their own kind, and these last four books, concise and expository accounts of the state of knowledge, brought her a much wider readership. They were often innovatory -- 'Primitive Government', for instance, in its treatment of patronage -- but she did not trumpet her resolution of theoretical issues. Her analysis of social organization was centred on individuals who made choices constrained by structures of opportunities and of rules of conduct: she argued, for example, that rural Africans who migrated to cities had more 'room for manoeuvre' (L. Mair, 'Studies in Applied Anthropology', 1957) to arrange their lives. She asked the British how they themselves would choose between good government and self-government, and then why they thought Africans should choose differently. She said she had ceased in the 1920s to imagine that socialism could make the world pleasant for everyone. In teaching the anthropology of economic and social development she said that development was not a separate discipline that could take the findings of anthropology and apply them: it was essential to know the social organization of developing peoples, to be able to assess the likely consequences of intervention. 
In the 1960s and 1970s Mair was confronted by socialist and 'marxisant' anthropologists who disparaged colleagues who had worked in colonies. She refused to admit that everything colonial administrators had done was completely wrong, and she insisted that they had thought they were doing good. Hers was an ironical anthropology -- she compared people's intentions and choices with the outcome of their actions, and deployed as much compassion as the circumstances might allow. This proceeded from her conviction that fairness, social justice, had to be achieved and maintained first by careful scholarship and then by hard work. And this in turn derived from her early life. On her arrival at Newnham College in 1919 she had found women under intense pressure to prove themselves as good as men: the pursuit of anything other than excellence was a betrayal. But when she looked beyond her immediate family she found a world devastated of men, by men. Indeed, like many formidably clever women of her age, she never married; and her chapter in 'Marriage' entitled 'What are husbands for?' suggests that she was still preoccupied with the contradictions, not to say absurdities, of women's assumption that men were superior beings, to be emulated. 
Mair died in hospital at Blackheath, London, on 1 April 1986, of emphysema. She bequeathed her books to libraries at the London School of Economics, and made various other bequests. The bulk of her estate went to her sister Marjory's children, John and Lucy.

Mboya, Thomas Joseph (1930-1969), labour leader and politician in Kenya, was born at Kilima Mbogo, near Thika, north of Nairobi, on 15 August 1930, the eldest of the six children of Leunadus Ndiege, a sisal worker from Rusinga Island, Lake Victoria, and his wife Marsella Awuor. Mboya's parents were Suba Luo by ethnic identity and Roman Catholic by religious conversion. Mboya was baptized a Catholic, and between the ages of seven and seventeen attended Irish-run Catholic schools in Kikuyu, Kamba, and Luo districts. By his own account, his non-tribal outlook in later life owed much to his unusually travelled childhood. 
Mboya spent the years 1948-50 at the Jeanes School, Kabete, where he studied sanitation and was president of the student council. In 1951 he began work with the Nairobi city council as a sanitary inspector. Politicized, confident, and ambitious, he plunged into labour organization. Despite his employers' resistance he converted the African Municipal Workers' Staff Association into the Kenya Local Government Workers' Union, with himself as secretary. In October 1952, immediately following the declaration of the Mau Mau emergency, he defiantly joined the Kenya African Union, the main nationalist party, and in the absence of its incarcerated leadership served as director of information and then as treasurer until the party's proscription in June 1953. Two months later he quit his city council job and in September took his union into the fledgeling Kenya Federation of Registered Trade Unions, becoming general secretary of the federation shortly afterwards. He would hold this post for almost a decade. During the early years of the emergency, when political activity by Africans was banned, Mboya used the federation (renamed Kenya Federation of Labour in 1955) as a vehicle for social, economic, and political protest. His co-operation with the government on labour matters helped him to survive unarrested. So too perhaps did the support he was garnering abroad, notably from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. His achievement in settling the Mombasa Dock strike of March 1955 confirmed both his dominance in labour affairs and his extraordinary political skills. 
In 1955-6, armed with a scholarship provided by the Trades Union Congress and the Colonial Office, Mboya studied at Ruskin College, Oxford. He went on to make a speaking tour of the United States, where he established ties with various businessmen, politicians, and labour leaders. These American connections bore much subsequent fruit; his student airlift scheme of 1959-61, for example, was partly funded by the Kennedy Foundation. In March 1957 he won the seat of Nairobi in the first African elections to the legislative council. With Kenyatta and other Kikuyu leaders still in detention, Mboya could use his position in Legco to assume 'de facto' leadership of the nationalist movement. The British authorities sought a multiracial dispensation for Kenya. By contrast, Mboya's agenda was to break settler power and press for majority rule. Blending lawyerly finesse with implacable non-co-operation, he extracted a series of concessions from the government. He also joined forces with his political rival Oginga Odinga in campaigning for Kenyatta's release. On the wider African stage, he chaired the historic All-African Peoples' Conference in Accra in 1958. 
Mboya was a key participant at the 1960 Lancaster House conference at which the principle of majority rule for Kenya was conceded. Nationwide parties were then established: the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU). Mboya mobilized the alliances he had created between his Nairobi People's Convention Party and political associations in other districts in order to secure the general secretaryship of KANU, thus maintaining a position of organizational power even after the return of the detainees. Mboya was strong-willed, single-minded, and acutely intelligent. In appearance he was distinctively round-faced. He married twice: his first, short-lived, marriage in the early 1950s to Ogweni was contracted under Luo custom, his second, to Pamela Odede ('b'. 1939) on 20 January 1962, within the church. From the first marriage there was a daughter, from the second two sons and two daughters. 
In April 1962 Mboya entered government, serving in the KANU-KADU coalition of 1962-3 as minister of labour. After the election of June 1963, which was followed by independence in December, KANU ruled alone under Kenyatta's leadership, with Mboya holding the portfolios of justice and constitutional affairs (June 1963 to December 1964) and economic planning and development (December 1964 to July 1969). In the former portfolio he engineered Kenya's presidential constitution; in the latter he was an orthodox developmentalist of his time, relying on state planning and foreign investment to stimulate growth. He was also indispensable to Kenyatta as a tactician, first in marginalizing KADU, later in forcing Odinga's radical faction out of KANU, tasks accomplished by 1966. 
Tom Mboya's talents, achievements and sophistication won him fame abroad, his rapport with the common people, popularity at home. Within KANU, however, he had enemies; men who had been outmanoeuvred by him politically and resented his arrogance towards them. The ethnic variable was probably relevant; by the later 1960s he was the only Luo in the higher reaches of a Kikuyu-dominated government. He was assassinated by gunshot in Government Road, Nairobi on 5 July 1969, dying on the way to hospital. His death precipitated widespread civil strife, including anti-Kikuyu riots by Luo crowds. On 11 July he was buried on Rusinga island, Nyanza. A Kikuyu suspect was arrested, tried, convicted, and executed. Rumour had it that the assassin had been hired by one or more of Mboya's political antagonists, intent, perhaps, on ensuring that he would never succeed to the presidency.

Miller, Walter Richard Samuel (1872-1952), missionary, was born on 22 March 1872 at Brook Hill, Honiton, Devon, the only son in the family of eight children of a respected merchant, Walter John Miller, and his wife, Jane Walker Sellers. His parents moved to Bristol in 1881 and after attending several private schools, Miller went to St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school in 1890, graduating MRCS and LRCP in 1896. Although a devoted Christian, he was not a mainstream Anglican. In childhood he was influenced by the Plymouth Brethren and later in life he inclined towards the Society of Friends and Moral Re-Armament. At medical school he played an active role in the Student Christian Movement. After qualifying he became travelling secretary for the Student Volunteer Missionary Union for a year. He worked in the Princess Christian Hospital at Freetown, Sierra Leone, for a short time before studying Hausa at Tripoli in Libya. He sailed to Nigeria as a Church Missionary Society missionary at the end of 1899. 
From Lagos, along with Bishop Herbert Tugwell and three other missionaries, Miller began a long journey to Kano while Frederick Lugard was preparing to subdue the unsettled protectorate of Northern Nigeria. In the event, the emir of Kano would not allow them to stay there, and Lugard was reluctant to let them establish a base until the country was pacified. Miller had several temporary camps until in 1905 he was allowed to settle in Zaria city, where he lived until 1929. This was the only mission allowed within a Muslim town in Northern Nigeria. Miller gave priority to developing a school rather than a hospital. For many years it was the best in Northern Nigeria and its pupils included the first two Hausa doctors, one of whom, Dr R. A. B. Dikko, became minister of health in the 1960s. Miller's sister Ethel came out in 1907 and together with other female missionaries started to provide education for Nigerian girls. A Hausa scholar in her own right, Ethel was unorthodox and individualistic and left to become a freelance evangelist. One significant event for Miller was the visit of some Isawa. These were scattered groups of Hausa who lived by Islamic standards, but gave primacy to Isa (Jesus). The emir gave some land where Miller organized a settlement for them. Unfortunately sleeping sickness caused many deaths, but those children who had come to Miller's school survived. The leader, Malam Audu, started a sugar crushing business and his son Dr Ishaya Audu became the first Nigerian vice-chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. 
Miller's greatest achievement was the translation of the 'Bible' into Hausa with the help of Hausa and other missionaries. It was completed in 1935. Though the Hausa readership was small, it increasingly influenced many groups where Hausa was becoming the lingua franca. In the mid-1920s younger missionaries were dissatisfied with the cramped quarters and constant friction with the authorities in Zaria. The mission was subsequently transferred to Wusasa, a site outside the city, where there was more space for a school and hospital. Miller himself moved to Kano in 1929 where he concentrated on completing his translation. He retired in 1935 to England, where he married, but could not settle down and in 1939, after the death of his wife, he returned to Nigeria, eventually settling near Jos. 
As well as articles in periodicals, Miller wrote 'Reflections of a Pioneer' (1936), 'Yesterday and tomorrow in Northern Nigeria' (1938), 'Have we Failed in Nigeria?' (1947), 'Success in Nigeria' (1948), 'For Africans Only' (1950), and 'Walter Miller, 1872-1952: an Autobiography' which he completed in 1949 but which was published posthumously. He criticized the conservatism of the local administration, many Northern Nigerian Muslim customs, and some missionary practices, calling in 1938 for a moratorium on missions long before this became fashionable. Upright, autocratic, and uncompromising in his standards of integrity, Miller had many friends, but was difficult to live with. As his contemporaries died or retired he became a solitary figure, but one respected and admired by his former students. He died on 17 August 1952 at Plateau Hospital, Jos, Nigeria, and was buried at St Piran's Church, Jos.

Mutesa II (1924-1969), king of Buganda, was born Edward Frederick William David Walugembe Mutebi Luwangula Mutesa on 19 November 1924 in Kampala, Uganda, the only son of Kabaka Daudi Chwa II (died 1939) and his wife, Irene Namaganda. Mutesa was the thirty-fifth 'kabaka' (king) of the kingdom of Buganda in Uganda, in a line of kings dating back to the sixteenth century. In an eventful career he suffered exile to Britain twice, first by the Uganda protectorate government in 1953 and second by President Obote of Uganda in 1966. In Britain he was popularly known as King Freddie of Buganda. 
Mutesa was sent to King's College, Budo, at the age of five, where he soon showed his prowess at sport and was captain of football. Later he went to Makerere College in Kampala, and in 1945 to Magdalene College, Cambridge, though he did not complete a degree. He became an honorary lieutenant-colonel of the Grenadier Guards, and through his education he acquired the style and bearing of 'a perfect English gentleman' which he retained to the end of his life. During his reign as 'kabaka' he frequently appeared in his guards' uniform and he was always immaculately dressed. For his people, the Baganda, he was the symbol of their historic prestige and power as a centrally organized monarchical state, and his court retained the elaborate ritual of former times. His chiefs knelt before him, while commoners had to prostrate themselves on the ground. Relations with the British protectorate government of Uganda had been firmly established in the Buganda agreement of 1900, which the Baganda maintained was not a document imposing colonial rule but a treaty between two allies. As the British preferred to develop Uganda as a unitary state with a strong central government, this traditional view of the agreement was bound to cause tension. 
Mutesa's father died in 1939, when Mutesa was a youth of fifteen, so he was guided by three regents until he reached the age of eighteen, when he was crowned as 'kabaka'. In 1948 he married Damali Kisosonkole. In this period he had to face the first serious demonstrations of political and economic unrest, in the riots of 1945 and 1949 in Buganda. These were symptomatic of the growing pressures in the process of modernization, in Buganda and in the protectorate as a whole. The process was to be carried forward at a much faster pace by the new governor of Uganda, Sir Andrew Cohen, who arrived in 1952. A brilliant and ambitious administrator, Cohen soon showed through his reforms that he wished to build up a strong central government with a rapidly expanding and increasingly elective central legislative council (the embryo parliament). To the Baganda, it looked as if the semi-autonomy and privileged position of the kingdom safeguarded by the 1900 agreement would be in jeopardy. The other three smaller monarchies in Uganda shared the same fears. Mutesa faced a fundamental dilemma in that he wished to defend the monarchy and the powers of his government, while at the same time he was obliged by the agreement to co-operate with the protectorate government. For the enlarged legislative council, the Buganda 'lukiko' (consultative council) was called on to nominate three representatives to it, or, if they refused, as seemed likely, the 'kabaka' was to nominate them instead. If he complied, he would undermine his own position as their 'kabaka'. At the same time, the Baganda feared British intentions to form a federation of east Africa, in which Kenya, with its settler-dominated government, would inevitably play the major role and the kingdom of Buganda would lose its powers. Instead, the 'lukiko' was pressing for a timetable for independence for Buganda alone. Cohen insisted that Mutesa must comply and nominate the three representatives. Mutesa considered that in a contest of loyalty he owed his allegiance to his own people, so he refused. Cohen then declared he was in breach of the 1900 agreement: he was no longer recognized as 'kabaka', and he was peremptorily deported in great secrecy to Britain. This was a staggering blow to the Baganda, and in the following two years they were very hostile to the protectorate government. However, Cohen's action was by no means universally approved by the British, and it was recognized that the 'kabaka' must return. Long negotiations ended in the second agreement of 1955, with the 'kabaka' this time as a constitutional monarch, that is with limited powers. Mutesa returned in October, to a tremendous welcome in Buganda. If he was not always popular before, now he was a martyr and a hero. In 1962 he was made a KBE. 
As independence for Uganda loomed in 1962, Buganda again showed strong separatist ambitions, but it was won over by the promise of a federal status within the independent state, partly through the moderating counsels of Mutesa. Milton Obote's party was temporarily allied to the 'kabaka yekka' party of Baganda royalists, in order to win his victory. He duly became prime minister and Mutesa was elected president of independent Uganda, but after Obote discarded the alliance with the 'kabaka yekka' party there was little co-operation between the two men and Mutesa's position as president looked dangerous. The final crisis came in 1966 when Obote arrested five cabinet ministers, including the leading minister from Buganda. In a period of desperate plotting by Obote to overthrow his political adversaries, who included Mutesa among them in their counter-plotting, Mutesa requested foreign governments, including the British, to send in troops. Obote replied by suspending the constitution and dismissing Mutesa as president; he then ordered the army to storm the palace in May 1966, and Mutesa had to flee to Britain, an exile for the second time and lucky to escape with his life. He described this in his book 'The Desecration of my Kingdom' (1967). 
Mutesa arrived penniless in Britain and had to borrow clothes from friends among the guards officers. The British government, which had provided him with a stipend during his first exile, this time failed to give him support or due recognition as a former friend and ally but chose to continue their support of Obote. Mutesa lived in poor circumstances until his death, at 28 Orchard House, Rotherhithe, London, on 21 November 1969, aged forty-five. President Amin ordered his body to be brought back to Uganda for a state funeral, and he was buried at the Kasubi royal tombs in April 1971. Mutesa had been torn between conflicting loyalties to his people, the kingdom of Buganda, and the state of Uganda; he was ever a man of two worlds, Western, urbane, debonair, yet the staunch head of an African traditional monarchy. He was survived by his wife and several children, one of whom, Ronald Mutebi, was crowned as the next 'kabaka' in 1993.

Nadel, Siegfried Ferdinand Stephan (1903-1956), social anthropologist and musicologist, was born on 24 April 1903 at Lemberg (Lwow), Galicia, Austria, the only son of the two children of Dr Moritz Nadel ('b'. 1871), a lawyer, and his wife, Adele Hirschsprung (1880-1955). His parents were both born at Lemberg and of Jewish descent. From 1912 the family was registered in Vienna, Austria, where Nadel attended secondary school. In 1920 he began to study piano and composition at the Academy of Music, and from 1921 to 1925 musicology, psychology, and philosophy at the University of Vienna with the teachers Moritz Schlick (the founder of the Vienna circle of philosophy) and the Gestalt psychologist Karl Buhler. He graduated with the degree of doctor of philosophy with honours in 1925. The Dusseldorf opera house in Germany engaged him for a period as a temporary assistant conductor, despite his being only twenty-two. On 3 July 1926 he married Dr Lisbeth Braun ('b'. 30 Nov 1900), also a musicologist. 
Nadel demonstrated an interest in comparative musicology from early in his career. In 1926-7 he devised a number of radio programmes for Radio Vienna dealing with African, Caucasian, Javanese, and black American music. A participant at the International Congress of Folk Music in Prague in 1928, two years later he presented a treatise on marimba music to the Phonogrammarchivkommission of the Vienna Academy of Science. During the early 1930s Nadel began to research the musicology of primitive peoples at the Phonogrammarchiv in Berlin. He also began the study of African languages at the University of Berlin. A meeting with a representative of the Rockefeller Foundation gave Nadel the opportunity to escape the increasing antisemitic pressure: he was awarded a Rockefeller fellowship to train as a social anthropologist, for which his earlier studies had been an excellent preparation. In October 1932 he became a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics with Charles Gabriel Seligman and Bronislaw Malinowski. Nadel soon took a leading role in Malinowski's seminar, 'with the zest for constructive theoretical argument which was characteristic of him till the end of his days' (Firth, 118). His capacity for mastering languages proved to be of advantage in Britain, as well as during his fieldwork. 
On Christmas eve 1933 Nadel, accompanied by his wife, started his research among the Nupe in Northern Nigeria. Returning to the London School of Economics in 1935 he was awarded a PhD degree for his thesis entitled 'Political and religious structure of Nupe society (Northern Nigeria)'. With a group of other psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists he participated in discussions that led to the publication of 'The Science of Society' (1939). From October 1935 to November 1936 he spent a further period investigating the Nupe. The fruits of his work were summarized in a number of articles and in two books, 'A Black Byzantium' (1942) and 'Nupe Religion' (1954). 
In 1937 Sir Douglas Newbold, governor of the Kordofan province, invited Nadel to prepare a survey of the hill tribes scattered over the Nuba Mountains with whose administration the official governmental authorities had frequently experienced difficulties. Nadel worked among different tribes of the district for a year, having been appointed government anthropologist by the government of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. His analysis and suggestions were later published in his book 'The Nuba' (1947), and in a number of articles. During the Second World War Nadel, by now a British citizen, joined the Sudan defence force and later the east African command of the British army. Holding the rank of major and then of lieutenant-colonel, he was appointed secretary of native affairs in the British military administration of Eritrea and Tripolitania. Service in the administration enabled him to put his experiences as anthropologist into practice. Through reforms he tried to improve the administrative system which the government authorities applied to tribal groups. In 1945 he was transferred to the home establishment, and received a gazetted commendation for outstanding services. In June 1946 he was released from military service and returned to London, to his wife and a daughter born during the war. 
Nadel started his academic teaching career as a lecturer at the London School of Economics in 1946. Two years later he became reader in anthropology at King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne (then part of Durham University). He had long-standing interests in the theoretical side of his field, and especially in its status as a science; this led in 1951 to the publication of his 'Foundations of Social Anthropology'. His stated intention was to examine the logical premises that underlay knowledge of all societies, primitive or otherwise. 'It was a bold enterprise', Raymond Firth later wrote, but 'in some respects, it was only partly successful' (Firth, 121). 'A magnificent teacher', he influenced several generations of students; and with his strong methodological bent 'he moved more than his colleagues, towards a new synthesis of social disciplines' (ibid., 122). 
In 1950 Nadel was appointed to the first chair in anthropology at the new Australian National University in Canberra. As well as setting up the new department, he became dean of the research school of Pacific studies. On 14 July 1956 Nadel died unexpectedly, in Canberra, of a coronary thrombosis, not yet fifty-three years old. Seven days earlier he had completed the manuscript of 'The Theory of Social Structure' (1957), which became a standard work; his wife survived him.

Owen, Walter Edwin (1879-1945), missionary, was born on 7 June 1879 at 144 Phillips Street, Aston, Birmingham, the son of John Simpson Owen, a British army warrant officer, and his wife, Caroline Isabella Blair. He was brought up in Belfast. He trained in England as a Church Missionary Society missionary and was ordained deacon in 1904 and priest in 1905, embarking on his life's work as a missionary in east Africa. On 8 October 1907 he married Isabel Barnes (died 1910), a fellow missionary, and, on 27 December 1911, Lucy Olive Walton of Wolverhampton (1876-1953), also a missionary. 
From 1904 to 1918 Owen worked on a succession of mission stations in Uganda: Bunyoro, Kabaro, and Kako, before, in 1918, becoming archdeacon of Kavirondo, in Kenya. Kavirondo had been evangelized from Uganda and had developed a vigorous church life as part of the Ugandan Native Anglican church. But in 1921 the archdeaconry was transferred to the diocese of Mombasa, a move which, in sharp contrast to Uganda, brought the African Christian community into a church structure increasingly driven by the needs and aspirations of the British settlers of Kenya colony. Owen attempted to mitigate the regressive effects of this for the Luo and Luyia peoples, immersing himself in the social and political life of Kenya. While appreciative of what, potentially, settlers could do for the development of the country, he was above all conscious of the duty of advocacy on behalf of the indigenous peoples: 'I believe that, just as in slavery many good Christian people had to be brought to see that Christianity and Slavery were incompatible so, today, many good Christian people have to be brought to see that certain features of British Administration in Kenya are but the modern expression of the desire for profit which gave rise to slavery. (Owen MSS, deposited in the CMS archives in the University of Birmingham: File 011, Owen to H. D. Hooper, 18 Sept 1939)' Owen's vigorous campaigning, in particular his doggedly persistent correspondence to the 'Manchester Guardian', brought him into conflict with settlers (who nicknamed him the Archdemon), colonial officials, and missionary colleagues. He was critical of settler attempts to dominate the political process in Kenya at the expense of the native African population, and was supportive of Indian rights to immigration and political participation, which was popular with neither settlers nor missionaries. He was outspoken in his condemnation of forced labour -- whether by colonial diktat or the authoritarianism of local chiefs -- not only in Kenya but in Uganda where in 1926 he denounced the use of conscripted labour in the extension of the railway. He spoke out against the brutal methods used by the British authorities in the collection of the hut tax, involving the burning of the homes of defaulters. He defended African interests in the Kakamega gold rush of the early 1930s. His advocacy was unambiguously paternalistic, and has been criticized for stifling the development of an articulate African political consciousness: in 1921 he founded and was president of the Kavirondo Taxpayers' Welfare Association, effectively keeping local politics under mission aegis for much longer than in Kikuyuland. 
Owen was strongly supportive of local culture -- he stressed, for example, that 'native' marriage be recognized as valid. But at times this affirmation collided with his strongly developed sense of fair play and justice. He was fiercely protective of the rights of women, and mounted a long campaign against forced marriages. He had earlier, in Uganda, insisted on a strict interpretation of the marriage ordinance, even if this went against local custom, invoking it to protect the rights of Christian women against husbands who subsequently became polygamous. Owen was interested in rural development and education to undergird the rural economy. Theologically liberal, both in biblical teaching and social attitudes, he was impatient with attempts to censure church members who supplemented their income by local brewing, noting that although personally he was almost a teetotaller, he could not agree to a rule which would have meant Christ being disciplined for turning the water into wine at Cana of Galilee 'for public consumption'. Owen was an enthusiastic amateur palaeontologist, and felt it important for the African church to be exposed to Darwinian accounts of creation. On retirement in 1945 he was made archdeacon emeritus and honorary canon of Mombasa Cathedral. He died on 18 September 1945 at Limuru, Kenya, and was buried in the churchyard of the settler church there. His second wife survived him. Max Warren, general secretary of the Church Missionary Society from 1942 to 1963, wrote of Owen: 'from him I caught the passionate conviction that the Gospel has to do with politics as well as souls. I learned about ecology from him long before anyone had thought of inventing the word' (M. Warren, 'Crowded Canvas', 1974, 41).

Sandford, Daniel Arthur (1882-1972), army officer and adviser in Ethiopia, was born at Landkey vicarage, south Devon, on 18 June 1882, one of the seven sons and two daughters of the Revd Ernest Grey Sandford (1839-1910) and his wife, Ethel M. R. Poole. His father, who had been an Oxford athlete, and was later canon and archdeacon of Exeter, had served as chaplain to Archbishop Frederick Temple. As a result of this connection young Daniel, on attending St Paul's School, lived with the Temples at Fulham Palace. On finishing school he adopted a military career. He attended the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and was commissioned in 1900 in the Royal Artillery. Transferred to India, he served in Bombay and Karachi until 1906. He was then posted to Aden, took a gunnery course in Britain, and returned to Aden in 1909. There, as a young subaltern, he took leave, sailed across the Gulf of Aden, and, entering Ethiopia, hired mules at Diredawa, and rode across the country to Sudan. These travels greatly enamoured him with Ethiopia, and made him determined to return to the country. This he did in 1910 when, joining the Sudan civil service as a contract officer, he was posted to the British legation in Addis Ababa. 
Dan Sandford, as he was generally known, rejoined the army in 1913. He served in France, where he was wounded, mentioned in dispatches, and was made a member of the French Legion d'honneur and DSO and bar. On 14 November 1918 he married Christine (1893-1975), daughter of Hubert Stanley Lush, a solicitor. The marriage, which was to last fifty-four years, was a happy one. Throughout her life Christine identified herself closely with her husband's career and interests. They had two sons and four daughters. 
In 1919 Sandford accompanied Lord Lugard on the latter's visit to Addis Ababa to inspect the work of a private British company, the Abyssinian Corporation, and was appointed its general manager. He held this post until the company's liquidation in 1921. By then deeply attracted by life in Ethiopia, he retired from the army in 1922 and leased a piece of land at Mulu, 30 miles north of Addis Ababa. Until the world slump of 1931, from which Ethiopia suffered greatly, he farmed at Mulu, grew strawberries for local sale, exported, mainly coffee and hides and skins, and for two years practised as an advocate. 
In 1935, after Emperor Haile Selassie's accession to power and ensuing efforts to suppress slavery and the slave trade, the Ethiopian ruler appointed Sandford adviser to the Ethiopian governor of Maji. This territory, on the Kenyan border, was a major centre of the slave trade which the emperor wished to suppress, and was planned by him to become a model province. However, not long after Sandford's arrival there, fascist Italy began its brutal invasion of Ethiopia. Learning of the emperor's defeat and departure for Europe, Sandford made his way south to Kenya, and returned to England where, through his Church of England connections, he became appeals secretary for Guildford Cathedral. 
At the outbreak of the Second World War Sandford joined the officers' emergency reserve, and was shortly afterwards sent to Cairo as a member of the Middle East intelligence centre. There, as an expert on Ethiopia, he was involved in planning British support for the Ethiopian patriots, who had been resisting the Italians for over four years. After Mussolini's declaration of war on Britain and France in June 1940, Sandford, then aged fifty-eight, entered Ethiopia's Gojjam province on 12 August with the rank of colonel as head of the British 'Mission 101'. Its object was to encourage and unify the efforts of the Ethiopian patriots, and thereby tie down the Italian forces. The latter then enjoyed considerable numerical superiority over the British and for a time seemed to threaten the entire British position in east Africa. Sandford's mission, though sometimes almost forgotten by the British higher commands in Cairo and Khartoum, was a considerable success: it laid the basis for the subsequent visit of another British officer, Colonel Orde Wingate, who was flown into Gojjam on 20 November 1940, and hence also for the emperor's arrival in the province from Sudan on 30 January 1941. 
After Haile Selassie's return to Addis Ababa on 5 May 1941, and Wingate's departure shortly afterwards, Sandford became, unofficially, the emperor's principal foreign adviser. This was a difficult position in that the interests and policies of the British and Ethiopian governments often greatly diverged. Sandford's brother-in-law, Brigadier Maurice Lush, was then deputy British political officer for British-occupied Ethiopia, and Sandford's loyalties were inevitably divided. His position as adviser was, however, formalized in May of the following year when, following the signing of the Anglo-Ethiopian treaty of 31 January 1942, he was officially appointed adviser to the Ethiopian ministry of the interior. He was in 1945 made director-general of the Addis Ababa municipality, a position which he held until 1948. 
Sandford retired from Ethiopian government service in 1948, devoting his energies thereafter to his farm at Mulu, which after the emperor's restoration had once again been leased to him. He also took an interest in Addis Ababa's English School (later the Sandford School), which his wife Christine had founded in 1942, and which was reckoned the best private secondary school in the country. He died on 22 January 1972 at his home, Mulu Farm, Ethiopia, and was buried on 24 January at the Commonwealth war cemetery in Addis Ababa, in the presence of the emperor.

Vasey, Sir Ernest Albert (1901-1984), politician in Kenya and businessman, was born on 27 August 1901 in Maryport, Cumberland, the son of Ernest Albert Vasey, an actor. His mother, whose name is unknown, was described as a repertory actress. Vasey's early life was peripatetic. His formal education ended when he left the Bromley national school aged twelve. He followed various trades on his way to achieving a more secure position, working as a Manchester club pageboy, a newspaper vendor, a blacksmith, a cobbler, and a household furnishing salesman, and in the mines. Between 1929 and 1937 Vasey was active in west midlands Conservative politics, earning a reputation as a powerful speaker, and serving on Shrewsbury town council and on the executive committee of the National Conservative Association, as well as being involved with the West Midlands Unionist Association and the Junior Imperial League. On 19 July 1923 he married Norah May ('b'. 1900/01), daughter of William Percy Mitchell, a master household furnisher. The couple had a son. 
A holiday in Kenya in 1935 marked the start of Vasey's long association with the colony, and he settled there in 1937. Resolved never to enter politics again, he followed a business career, eventually serving on the boards of various companies, including the Bata Shoe Company Ltd. In 1938, however, at the suggestion of Gwladys, Lady Delamere, he stood successfully for election to the Nairobi municipal council, remaining a member until 1950. As mayor in 1941-2, he worked for an increase in African representation, securing during his second term in office (1944-6) the addition of two nominated African representatives to the council. In 1944 he married Hannah Strauss (died 1981); they had one son. In 1945 Vasey was elected legislative councillor for Nairobi North. In this capacity he pressed for greater direction in government policy towards industry, and helped bring about the creation of a ministry of commerce in 1948. 
In 1950 Vasey crossed the floor to join the colonial government, becoming only the second European from outside the colonial service to be appointed by the government to the executive council and receiving under the new 'member system' the portfolio for health, local government, and education. He later claimed that he had joined the government in order to articulate his 'moderate' views more freely and to establish himself as an effective leader of all races (Vasey to P. Rogers, 20 Dec 1952, Vasey MSS, box 1, file 3). Some, however, thought that the switch of allegiance reflected his failure to attract sufficient support among elected European members in the legislative council to secure his own election (Blundell, 76). In 1952 Vasey was appointed minister of finance in a bid by the administration to end the political stand-off with European settlers over fiscal policy by promoting an unofficial. He remained in the post until 1959. Vasey was one of the key political figures in Kenya throughout the Mau Mau emergency. He reformed the treasury along more professional lines, and secured the addition of development to his portfolio in 1954 under the Lyttelton constitution. Protecting funds intended for development and attracting additional British financial assistance while ensuring that emergency expenditure did not result in British control over Kenyan finances, Vasey successfully steered the Kenyan economy through the emergency. He helped Kenya to establish strong connections with aid agencies at a relatively early stage, upheld confidence among investors, and urged government encouragement of new industries and the creation of the Nairobi stock exchange, established in 1954, as well as a loans scheme to assist African traders. 
Admired by officials as a skilful administrator, Vasey played up his position as an unofficial, threatening resignation on several occasions when it strengthened his hand in negotiations with the Colonial Office and the Kenyan administration. Characterized by British officials in 1949 as 'a red hot settler' (Tignor, 309), Vasey, a member of the Capricorn Africa Society, was progressive politically, financing W. W. W. Awori's newspaper 'Radio Posta' in the late 1940s, and consistently advocating greater African political advance, calling for instance for the introduction of a common roll. He was the most effective of settler politicians in securing multiracial support, working closely with Asian community leaders, although sometimes privately dismissive of Asian suitability for political office (ibid.). Vasey formed the Unofficial Members' Organization in 1948 to provide a forum in which members representing all races could meet, and, in 1955, instituted a series of secret meetings with European, Asian, and African community leaders to discuss constitutional advance. In 1959 he was rumoured to be considering forming a multiracial party. Regarded as a man of great integrity, Vasey's robust and opinionated style and his political views left him, however, without significant support among European unofficials, and during his last years at the Treasury criticism of him culminated in demands for an inquiry into Kenya's fiscal policies. 
Despite having been a significant influence behind the introduction in 1957 of multiracial representation through an electoral college, Vasey failed to gain election in 1958 to the legislative council as a special elected member owing to an African boycott. He resigned from the council of ministers and in 1959 was invited by Julius Nyerere to Tanganyika, where he was minister of finance and economics from 1959 to 1960 and minister for finance from 1960 to 1962. From 1962 to 1966 he was an economic adviser to the World Bank, and between 1963 and 1966 resident representative in Pakistan for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Returning to Kenya in 1966, Vasey sought a quieter life, working as a financial consultant with, among others, the International Finance Corporation. He chaired several important official inquiries, including an inquiry into local government in Zanzibar (1954). He also published various papers on Kenyan economic and political development. 
Vasey's early theatrical associations inspired a lifelong love. He acted from an early age, tried dramatic writing (a one-scene play published in 1933 debated the social costs of industry), and became a partner in a Nairobi playhouse/cinema and managing director in the British East African cinema syndicate, the New Theatre Ltd. He was made CMG in 1945, awarded the insignia of the second class of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar in 1955, and made a freeman of Nairobi in 1957, KBE in 1959, and in 1966 Hilal-i-Quaid-i-Azam of Pakistan. He died in Nairobi on 10 January 1984, predeceased by his second wife.

Blixen, Karen Christenze (1885-1962), autobiographer and short-story writer, was born on 17 April 1885 in Rungstedlund, near Copenhagen, Denmark, the second of five children of Wilhelm Adolph Dinesen (1845-1895) and his wife, Ingeborg Westenholz (1856-1940). Thomas, her younger brother, was her great confidant, especially during her later years in Africa. Her father came from a landowning family in Jutland in the north of Denmark and had been a soldier -- in both the Danish and French armies -- a writer, and a traveller, in Canada, North America, and Europe. Unlike his conservative family he was what the great Danish critic Georg Brandes called 'an aristocratic radical', and his book 'Letters from the Hunt' has remained a minor Danish classic. Wilhelm later became an independent with liberal sympathies in the Danish parliament. He committed suicide in 1895, having been told that he had an incurable illness. Her mother was from an extremely wealthy family which also had land in Jutland, but they had made their fortunes through trade in corn and other commodities. 
Educated initially at home, Karen Dinesen spent nine months at the Ecole Benet in Lausanne, Switzerland. This was followed by further study at the Hillerod folk high school, at a private drawing school, and then at the Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi (Royal Academy of Fine Arts), Copenhagen. Despite opposition from her family, Karen became engaged in December 1912 to her Swedish cousin Baron Bror Blixen-Finecke (1886-1946), 'the rough, extroverted nobleman and remorseless prankster' (Thurman, 105). Bror's uncle Count Morgens Frijs encouraged them to escape from Denmark: 'Go to Kenya, you two' (ibid., 106). Bror Blixen went on ahead to buy land, and they were married in a civil ceremony at Mombasa on 14 January 1914. 
The different strands of Karen's Danish background -- her hero worship of her adventurous, radical, book-loving, aristocrat father Wilhelm, and her tense relationship with the members of her mother's wealthy bourgeois family, the Westenholzes -- in some ways prepared her well for her life in British East Africa, and Kenya as it later became. The early twentieth-century fluidity of the region left her relatively unconstrained by conventional gender, class, and even racial roles. She was both insider and outsider, a European but a Dane, and a woman, and therefore on the edges of the dominant imperial and very masculine nexus of settler, hunter, administrator. Of striking appearance -- her huge dark eyes were often remarked on -- she was courageous, unorthodox, and (on the strength of her husband's title) an 'aristocrat'. 
During the eighteen years following her marriage Blixen, or Tanne as she was familiarly known, managed a coffee estate of 6000 acres in the Ngong Hills, close to both Kikuyu and Maasai 'reserves' and near the town of Nairobi. It was owned by the Karen Coffee company, set up largely by members of her family who were confident that coffee had a bright future. As it turned out, the land was a fraction too high for coffee and the soil too acidic. Her marriage was short-lived; Bror Blixen was regarded by contemporaries -- along with her lover Denys Finch-Hatton (1887-1931) -- as the model of the African white hunter, and is said to have inspired the figure of Robert Wilson in Ernest Hemingway's 'The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber'. He was, according to his friends, 'one of the most durable, congenial, promiscuous, prodigal creatures who ever lived' (Thurman, 112). As a husband he was a disaster, and in the first year of marriage passed on syphilis (of the spine, 'tabes dorsalis') to his young wife. She struggled with its blight all her life, often suffering intensely from its secret and violent assaults on her body, particularly in her last years. Yet the Blixen marriage was finally dissolved only in 1925, and her own response to this was typical of her attitude to fate and misfortune: she loved the dramatic, the mocking gesture in the face of a harsh blow from life, and many of her later stories reflected this austere, gallant, and defiant philosophy. In a letter to her brother Thomas, in September 1926, she wrote: 'my illness was not so terribly 'repugnant' to me; many shauries [difficulties] that might seem completely intolerable to some people, to me are quite stimulating, such as the difficulties that my 'pro-nativeness' land me in with the English' (Dinesen, 'Letters from Africa', 283). 
Even before the Blixens parted in 1919 she had met and taken as her lover the Ariel-like hunter-scholar, the Honourable Denys Finch-Hatton, who was to be the great love of her African life. She and Finch-Hatton sometimes hunted together, and to a point he was her adviser and confidant, yet he visited only infrequently between safaris and journeys 'home' to England. Finch-Hatton brought Tanne intense happiness, representing a kind of ultimate challenge she had wanted all her life; he introduced her to a range of English and French poets and writers outside her own extensive reading of Spinoza, Voltaire, Nietzsche, John Stuart Mill, and the classic Danish authors such as A. G. Oehlenschlager, S. S. Blicher, and J. L. Heiberg, and also Hans Christian Andersen, all of whom she continued to read avidly while in Kenya. Yet Finch-Hatton refused any real commitment, and their last meeting before his fatal crash in his light aeroplane in May 1931 (a month before she herself left Kenya) may well have been the scene of a bitter quarrel arising from Blixen's jealousy. 
In Nairobi Blixen became -- in one way -- part of the European colonial and settler community based around the young, ramshackle town with its bricolage of buildings ranging from ambitious colonial structures to bungalows, shacks of corrugated iron, and the flimsy structures of the Somali ghetto on its periphery. Among the European community of Nairobi, itself made up of a colourful variety of social types and nationalities, Baroness Blixen must have cut a bold and unconventional figure, walking down Government Street with her finely dressed and dignified Somali servant Faraah Aden a short distance behind her, carrying, usually, her shawl and a rifle. At other times she would be driven by him perhaps to a party at Government House, to the Muthaiga Club -- known in the twenties as the Moulin Rouge of Africa and started by her friend Berkely Cole -- or she would be seen 'en route' to visit the 'flimsy Somali ghetto' on the Limuru Road (Thurman, 151). 
Karen Blixen was a fine shot and an intrepid hunter, earning the name Lioness Blixen from some of the Africans who knew her; she had also, among the Kikuyu 'squatters' on her farm, a 'reputation as a great if quixotic doctor' (Thurman, 244). She was an extravagant hostess, who believed in grand menus perfectly executed; her second home, Mbogani House, was a magnet for outcasts and visiting dignitaries alike. These included the prince of Wales, who in 1928 -- after meeting Karen Blixen at Government House -- asked to see an 'ngoma' (a dance) on the farm. It was arranged with difficulty as it was the wrong time of the year for such harvest festivities, but the Kikuyu chiefs agreed, and it was a huge success. In the lesser-known of her two memoirs of Kenya, 'Shadows in the Grass' (1960), Blixen describes how 'a stream of supple fiery young people of both sexes [arrived], set on dancing should it cost them their life. The small group of an old Chief and his aged counsellors in rich, heavy monkey skin cloaks, advanced in state, isolated from the common crowd by ten feet of empty space before and after them. (Dinesen, 'Shadows', 42)' By the time she left Kenya, Baroness Blixen was a celebrity, not only among the circle around Government House, but also one who was known and respected by many Maasai, Kikuyu, and Somalis and by the Indian community. Her knowledge of Swahili, her fierce if hierarchic sense of justice, and her rare attitude of reciprocity towards other cultures, races, and religious beliefs (particularly Islam) marked her out from most other Europeans of the time. Her voluminous letters home (published in English as 'Letters from Africa, 1914-1931', in 1981), written largely to her mother, her Aunt Bess Westenholz, and her brother Thomas, show not only her love for Africa as a landscape, but also her clear understanding that both Africans and Indians would play their part in a future Kenyan state. She was, as she herself once put it, 'God's chosen snob' (Thurman, 205), but she wore her 'pro-native' label with a defiant pride. 
Karen Blixen began drafting in English what later became her first collection of tales ('Seven Gothic Tales', 1934) in the long lonely hours on the farm, and she began writing in earnest in 1926, when the collapse of the estate seemed near. The spare, beautifully written, and highly selective memoir of her life in Kenya 'Out of Africa' (1937) was written in English and later translated by her into Danish. She had returned to Denmark in June 1931 to live with her mother, Ingeborg, in the old family home at Rungstedlund, next to the sea and looking across Ore Sund to Sweden. She was forty-six, the coffee estate had been sold, and the company was bankrupt. Blixen had lost her livelihood, her lover, and, perhaps most painful of all, any possibility of staying on in east Africa. For many years she exchanged letters with some of the people on the farm who had been a part of her Kenyan life, but she would never see them again. 
The manuscript of her classic, yet unorthodox, account of settler experience in east Africa was written in 1936. By then she had begun to make a name for herself (as Isak Dinesen) through the success in 1934 first in America and then in Britain of 'Seven Gothic Tales'. Blixen, encouraged by her brother Thomas and struggling to give her past in Africa some meaning in her life, worked partly from notes that she had begun on the Kenyan farm in 1926. She began writing at Rungstedlund and finally, needing solitude, moved to Skagen, on the northernmost tip of Jutland, and finished the manuscript there. As her biographer Judith Thurman states, 'Out of Africa' is not in any sense documentary writing but rather an overview, 'a landscape from the air' with time and action 'compressed and telescoped' (Thurman, 325). In 1985 the book provided the title and narrative structure of a major feature film, starring Meryl Streep as Karen and Robert Redford as Denys Finch-Hatton. 
Karen Blixen never returned to east Africa, however much she wished to do so. World events and her uncertain health made it impossible. When Denmark was occupied by the Germans in 1940, she remained at Rungstedlund, writing 'Winter's Tales' first in English and then in Danish. The English version was sent to Random House, New York, in the Swedish diplomatic pouch, and was published in 1942 under the name Isak Dinesen. A small armed-services edition, able to fit snugly in a soldier's jacket, was also produced, and there is a copy in the British Library. At Rungstedlund Blixen became a magnet for a group of younger Danish writers including Bjorn Parlsen and Thorkild Bjornvig, who later became one of Denmark's leading poets. In the early 1950s she began regular work for radio and spoke on her seventieth birthday speech in 1955 of her pleasure 'to be a voice and not a piece of printed matter' (Thurman, 397). Radio, she felt, confirmed her identity as a storyteller, one of an 'ancient, wild and useless tribe', her roots in the oral tradition, drawing her power from a charged complicity with those who listened (ibid.). 
Karen Blixen died at Rungstedlund on 7 September 1962 at the age of seventy-seven. The last pictures of her were taken by the photographer Cecil Beaton, whom she had met in France on one of her travels as a writer and celebrity (C. Beaton, 'The Restless Years', 1976, 159-61). By the end of her life Karen Blixen had carved a place for herself not only in Danish writing but also in British and postcolonial literature, where she remains a complex and unusual voice speaking from a particular moment in Britain's history of empire.

Temple, Charles Lindsay (1871-1929), colonial official and author, was born on 20 November 1871 at Simla, India, the son of Sir Richard Temple, bt (1826-1902), administrator in India, and his second wife, Mary Augusta (died 1924), daughter of Charles Robert Lindsay of the Bengal civil service and his wife, Rhoda Charlotte. Temple was connected through his immediate family, and his mother's relationship with the earls of Crawford, to the intellectual, social, and political elite of the period. After attending Sedbergh School (1882-9) he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1890 to read engineering but left the following year due to recurring bouts of ill health. In spite of considerable intellectual ability he abandoned a university career, instead joining the Hampstead literary set where he developed his linguistic and anthropological interests. Finding no lasting satisfaction there, he decided to seek his fortune in Brazil. Between 1893 and 1896 he rapidly learnt Portuguese, travelled, traded, and ran his own coffee plantation in Cuyaba. Dissatisfied with limited success, he travelled to London, gaining a Royal Geographical Society diploma in surveying in 1896 before returning to Brazil in the hope of building a major road between Para and Cuyaba. Thwarted by the vacillation of the local authorities he gave up this plan, gained a post with the consular service, and served in Para and Manaos (1898-1901). 
In August 1901, seeking faster promotion, Temple transferred to the colonial service. Because of the reputation he had built in Brazil, he was appointed to the newly formed political service for Northern Nigeria as a third-class resident -- higher than the normal starting rank of assistant resident. Between 1901 and 1910 he enhanced his reputation through exceptional work as resident-in-charge of the important provinces of Bauchi, Sokoto, and Kano, as well as becoming chief examiner in the Hausa language. Following his services to the Northern Nigerian lands committee, Temple was made a CMG in 1909. In 1910 he was appointed chief secretary with a dormant commission to administer the protectorate in the absence of the governor. Temple acted, with great success, as governor from January to August 1911 and from June to October 1912. Following the amalgamation of Nigeria in January 1914, he served under Sir Frederick Lugard, the governor-general, as lieutenant-governor of the northern provinces, and held this office until his retirement due to ill health in 1917. 
Temple's wife, Olive Susan Miranda MacLeod (1880-1936) ['see 'Temple, Olive Susan Miranda], whom he had married on 28 April 1912, shared his sense of adventure and his intellectual interests. Olive went on tour with Charles, taking an active interest in his administrative and anthropological activities. They both wrote books and articles on Nigeria as well as making photographic and phonographic recordings of the local communities, presenting useful collections to the Royal Geographical Society and to the social anthropologist Sir James George Frazer. 
As one of the most able administrators of the first two decades of British control in Northern Nigeria, Temple had an important influence on the formative years of indirect rule. He frequently had fierce clashes with Lugard over the application of this policy, particularly objecting to Lugard's capricious style of administration which he felt undermined hard won reforms. Early accounts of Temple are largely critical but subsequently available sources have led to a reassessment of his significance to the colonial history of Nigeria. Of these sources, his wife's papers, which give a particularly detailed and vivid account of Temple's time in Nigeria, make clear that he was a very ambitious man determined to make a name for himself as a liberal, scientific, and modern administrator. Other contemporary accounts demonstrate that he largely achieved this, and would have been appointed governor of Uganda in 1917 had ill health not intervened. During Charles's sick leave (from 1916) and recuperation the Temples stayed in Cape Province, and it was here that he wrote 'Native Races and their Rulers' (1918). In this book Temple explained and justified his conception of indirect rule from the basis of a social Darwinist world-view, as well as making a satirical and cryptic attack on Lugard's style of administration. Finding South Africa uncongenial, the Temples moved to Granada, Spain, where they remained until Charles died of kidney failure on 9 January 1929. He was buried in Granada.

Stonehouse, George (1714-1793), Church of England clergyman, was born on 5 August 1714 at Hungerford Park, Berkshire, the younger son of Francis Stonehouse. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1729, graduating BA (1733) and MA (1736), and became vicar of Islington (a family living) in 1738. Following a conversion experience on 10 May 1738 he was, as the only London incumbent involved, a key figure in the evangelical revival. From July 1738, when Charles Wesley effectively became his assistant curate, Islington was a centre of the revival. A society met in Stonehouse's vicarage. In April 1739, however, the churchwardens prevented Wesley from preaching because he was unlicensed. By April 1740 Stonehouse was an advocate of 'stillness', the doctrine which was to split the movement. Its leading exponent, the Moravian Philipp Heinrich Molther, went to live at his vicarage. Rejecting the Church of England, Stonehouse resigned his living and sold the advowson. 
On 1 June 1739 Stonehouse married the heiress Mary Crispe [
In 1743 and again in 1745 Mary Stonehouse took legal action to secure property due to her on the death of relatives, inheriting a further estate in 1748. From 1745 to 1748 the English Moravian boys' school occupied her Buttermere (Wiltshire) estate, and she supported Moravian work with substantial gifts and loans. In the later 1740s she was in charge of the Moravians' English finances. 
George Stonehouse was initially also generous, expending about half of his assets in 1741 to purchase for the Moravians both Whitefield's Pennsylvania estate and a ship. But by May 1742, when he too was received into membership, he had already clashed with Moravian leaders. For several years his attitude fluctuated, and he never held any office in the Moravian church. He accompanied his wife to Yorkshire in 1742, but returned after a few weeks. In 1743 he moved to Germany with her, but became disaffected the following year and returned to England. From mid-1745 he was again positive, but finally turned against the Moravians in 1748. Zinzendorf returned Buttermere, but Stonehouse was not mollified. In 1750 Zinzendorf described Stonehouse's attitude as one of hatred, and Mary was torn between love for her husband and devotion to the Moravian cause. Her May 1751 will left him and her unborn child a life interest in her estate, but after their deaths it was to revert to James Hutton for the Moravians. 
The Stonehouses' eight children all died in infancy, and it was following childbirth that Mary herself died in London on 10 December 1751. She was buried in the Moravians' Chelsea burial-ground on 27 December. Litigation and acrimonious correspondence about the estate ensued, and by November 1756 Stonehouse was 'mad against the Brethren, almost to distraction' (Bristol congregation diary, 18 Nov 1756). 
On 4 December 1755 Charles Wesley performed Stonehouse's second marriage, to Susanna Stafford. Stonehouse moved to the Bristol area, and by 1773 resided at East Brent, near Burnham-on-Sea. The author of a Syriac grammar, he travelled widely to consult 'New Testament' manuscripts. He also wrote on universal restitution. Visiting in 1781, John Wesley noted: 'He is all-original still, like no man in the world, either in sentiments or anything about him. But perhaps if I had his immense fortune I might be as great an oddity as he' (23 Aug 1781, 'Journal of... John Wesley', 6.331). Stonehouse died in Bristol on 5 December 1793.

Simpson, John (b. 1709/10, d. in or after 1766), evangelist and preacher, was the son of Thomas Sympson, and was brought up in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. Possibly because of the influence of John Wesley, then living in nearby Epworth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, aged eighteen, as a servitor in 1728. There he became Wesley's pupil and a member of the Holy Club (the Oxford Methodists). He graduated in 1731, and after ordination obtained a valuable Leicestershire living. 
During the 1730s Simpson kept in touch with Wesley, and when the evangelical revival began, he was drawn into it. By November 1739 he was in London, the centre of the revival. He preached in Benjamin Ingham's Yorkshire societies, and in January 1740 visited Ingham's followers in Nottingham. Wesley seems to have left Simpson in charge of his fledgeling Foundery Society, established for his London followers because he disapproved of the doctrine of 'stillness' which was taking hold of the revival's 'headquarters', the Fetter Lane Society. But by April Simpson had himself espoused 'stillness', rejecting the sacraments, and led opposition to Charles Wesley in both societies. The dispute resulted in the Wesleys' withdrawal from the Fetter Lane Society that July. 
In November 1740 Simpson, who had by now resigned his living, moved to Ockbrook, Derbyshire, and became leader of the societies established by Ingham's followers there and in Nottingham. In 1741 Simpson's teaching of 'stillness' annoyed the countess of Huntingdon -- although she believed he was 'a good man and means well' (undated letter to James Hutton, Moravian Church House, London, AB88.A3.12.1) -- and she asked the Fetter Lane Society to recall him. They replied that they had not sent him, but none the less asked him to return, which he declined to do. 
By now the Moravians had taken over the Fetter Lane Society. When Simpson visited them in August 1741, they judged him to be 'ehrlich; aber doch eigen' ('honest but peculiar'; London Moravian diary, 12 Aug 1741). They remonstrated with him for going to Ockbrook, acting unilaterally, and fostering error. In April 1742 Moravian opposition to Simpson's planned marriage to an unconverted woman prompted him to repudiate them. Meetings with Lady Huntingdon and the Wesleys ensued, but he stood by his teachings and, though initially thought to have made common cause with the Wesleys, remained independent. 
Simpson's support in Ockbrook grew (two houses were built for him), and he visited Nottingham quarterly, but in 1743 several members of his society withdrew after the Moravians, who thought he acted 'like a madman' (Moravian English Conference minutes, 15 Sept 1742, Moravian Church House, London), publicly disowned him for refusing to obey directions. By May only ten remained; thirty of Simpson's former followers requested Moravian supervision in January 1744. 
John Wesley's journal entries recording meetings with Simpson display continued affection: 'Whatever he does is in the uprightness of his heart. But he is led into a thousand mistakes by one wrong principle... the making inward impressions his rule of action, and not the written word' (22 June 1742, J. Wesley, 3.26); he was 'the oddest, honestest enthusiast, surely, that ever was upon earth' (28 Nov 1743, ibid., 3.113); this 'original enthusiast... spoke many good things, in a manner peculiar to himself... what pity it is this well-meaning man should ever speak without an interpreter!' (17 Aug 1745, ibid., 3.202). In November 1747 Simpson aroused Wesley's sympathy when he was drawn to London by the offer of a living, but was then asked to stop preaching outside church -- a condition to which he could not agree. 
Still living and preaching in Ockbrook, in 1748-9 Simpson's repeated drunkenness and the content of his conversations to and about women gave offence. He railed against the Moravians, seeming 'crazy if not fuddled' (Bedford Moravian Labourers' Conference minutes, 1 Jan 1750, Bedfordshire RO, MO.2) when doing so in a Bedford inn. He was in Derby gaol by January 1751, and still there in October 1753. By 1757 he was out of prison, still living in Ockbrook and preaching to five or six people every Sunday. He is last recorded living in Ockbrook in 1766; details of his date and place of death are unknown.

Rogers, Hester Ann (1756-1794), Methodist writer, was born on 31 January 1756 in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where her father, James Roe (died 1765), was the Anglican clergyman. She received a good education, presumably at the hands of her strict but sincere father, who died on 10 April 1765. She was confirmed by the bishop of Chester at Whitsuntide 1769 and very opposed to Methodism, but in 1774 was influenced by David Simpson, the evangelical clergyman at Christ Church, Macclesfield. She dated her conversion from 11 November 1774, having been affected by the preaching of Samuel Bardsley, the Wesleyan Methodist itinerant in Macclesfield. Her family was outraged and virtually disowned her, but when she threatened to leave home and go into service they relented. Hester then proposed to become her mother's servant on condition she could attend Methodist meetings. Her mother, thinking it would not last, agreed, but Hester persevered, winning her freedom after eight months. Her journal dates from this time. She first met John Wesley in April 1776 and they began a lifelong correspondence. He made her a class leader in 1781 and she became a dedicated sick visitor. 
Hester first met James Rogers (1749-1807) on 27 March 1781. When he came to Macclesfield in 1782 as the Wesleyan Methodist itinerant she became close friends with the family, but was shocked in December 1783 when his wife Martha ('nee' Knowlden) said she hoped Hester would marry James after her death. Martha died on 15 February 1784, leaving two sons, Joseph (aged four) and Benjamin (aged two), and after much heart-searching James and Hester married on 19 August 1784, sailing for Dublin nine days later. They remained there until 1787, when they moved to Cork, going on to Bandon, co. Cork, in 1789. While in Dublin Hester became a class leader and started her 'Spiritual Letters' (1796), which, together with extracts from her diary, was extensively used as a devotional book. She also contributed to the 'Arminian Magazine' and wrote poetry. 
In 1790 Wesley brought the family back from Ireland to the New Chapel, City Road, London, intending Hester to be his housekeeper, though these duties were not taken up on account of her ill health. Both she and James were at Wesley's deathbed in March 1791. In September 1793 they moved to Belmont Road Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Birmingham, and in the following year attended the Bristol conference as Hester was particularly anxious to see their sons -- Joseph, a printing apprentice, and schoolboys Benjamin and James. She died at the Belmont Road manse, Birmingham, on 10 October 1794 shortly after giving birth to her fifth child. She was buried in St Mary's chapel yard, Birmingham, where a memorial obelisk was erected.

Ritchie, Elizabeth (1754-1835), biographer, was born at Otley, Yorkshire, on 2 February 1754, the second child of John Ritchie (died 1780) and his wife, Beatrice Robinson. Her father, a native of Edinburgh, was for many years a naval surgeon. Having retired from the sea he settled in Wharfedale, Yorkshire, where he married Beatrice and continued to practise. The family was Wesleyan Methodist and John Wesley often stayed at their home in Otley. Her childhood was happy, but her upbringing strict and, feeling restricted at home, Elizabeth was delighted at the age of twelve to stay with a Mrs H. who, while providing her with educational opportunities, also introduced her to more worldly pleasures. She attended the Church of England and came to despise the Methodists, but when Mrs H. moved to London, Elizabeth returned home and met Wesley again. She refused to hear him preach and went to the parish church, where the sermon of the evangelical curate greatly affected her. From 3 July 1771 Elizabeth began to keep a very personal diary. In June 1772 she renewed her acquaintance with Wesley at Otley and returned to Wesleyan Methodism, where she joined a class and was made a class leader (1774). Until 1780 her visiting and teaching was restricted to Otley because of her own ill health (probably tuberculosis) and that of her parents, her father dying on 18 April 1780. She later began to go further afield, sharing in John Wesley's journeys and undertaking some herself. While she did not actually preach Elizabeth instructed new converts and ministered to the sick. 
Elizabeth corresponded with many leading Methodists and especially, from 1772, with John Wesley. In November 1790 she took up residence at the New Chapel house, City Road, London, acting as housekeeper in place of Hester Ann Rogers, where she became Wesley's nurse during his last illness and often read to him. Elizabeth was at his bedside when he died on 2 March 1791 and at the request of his physician, John Whitehead, wrote a detailed account of his last days. Whitehead read part of this at Wesley's funeral and it was later published. She was very depressed after Wesley's death, but with the help of friends, especially Mary Fletcher ('nee' Bosanquet), she restarted her evangelical and philanthropic activities. 
In London, Elizabeth resumed her role as class-leader at the Foundery and continued with her letter writing, but her itinerant journeys and diary ceased. In 1786 she had rejected a proposal of marriage from Harvey Walklate Mortimer (1753-1819) and he married someone else. However, in 1801, when he was a widower, they married and Elizabeth took on the raising of her six stepchildren. After her husband's death in 1819 Elizabeth continued with her class and public speaking until a doctor advised against it. She died in London on 9 April 1835 and was buried at the New Chapel, City Road.

Kinsman, Andrew (bap. 1724, d. 1793), Methodist preacher, was baptized at Tavistock parish church, Devon, on 11 November 1724, the son of John Kinsman and Mary, his wife. He was converted to Methodism about 1740 by reading the sermons of George Whitefield, whom he met locally in 1744. Though he maintained contact with local Wesleyan Methodists, and knew both John and Charles Wesley, Kinsman held to the Calvinistic Methodism learned from Whitefield. He moved to Plymouth in 1745 and joined a Methodist society of Whitefield's converts. Ann Tiley (died 1774) had given a site in Bretonside in the town for a tabernacle (or chapel) in 1744, and on 28 October of the following year she and Kinsman were married. This gave him a controlling position in the tabernacle, for many years the leading centre of Methodism in Plymouth. In 1753 he strengthened his position by opening a chapel in Devonport called the Upper Room. His wife died in July 1774 and in October 1776 he married Mrs Joanna Webber of London, who survived him. 
At first the tabernacle was supplied by a series of itinerant Calvinistic Methodist preachers, but by 1748 Kinsman took over the leadership and from 1750 preached regularly. He was ordained a minister at Broadmead Baptist chapel in Bristol on 4 August 1763 by five nonconformist and Methodist preachers. After this he was much in request to preach in other churches each summer, when he employed students (usually connected with the countess of Huntingdon) as temporary ministers for his two chapels. He had continued his grocery business, but in 1771 he gave it to his son and went to live at Devonport. For a year before his death at Devonport on 28 February 1793 he suffered from dropsy. He was buried in Stoke Damerel parish churchyard in Devonport after a service in his Upper Room. In his lifetime Kinsman maintained the Methodist character of his two Calvinistic congregations, but after his death both embraced dissent.

Hopper, Christopher (1722-1802), Methodist preacher, was born on 25 December 1722 at Low-Coalburn, Ryton, co. Durham, and baptized at Ryton parish church on 9 January 1723, the ninth and youngest child of Moses Hopper, a farmer, and his wife, Ann Barkiss. At about five years old he was sent to a school run by a Mr Alderson, a pious and forbidding teacher. His formal education appears to have ended with Alderson's suicide, whereupon, aged fifteen, Hopper was employed as a driver on the wagon-ways between the coal pits and the River Tyne. 
In May 1742 reports began to circulate of John Wesley's preaching to great effect at Sandgate, Newcastle upon Tyne. Hopper was himself converted by the preaching of Jonathan Reeve in the spring of the following year. On 14 July 1743 John Wesley spoke at Low Spen, near Newcastle, and soon after a Methodist society was formed with Hopper as one of its leaders. He received requests to preach at such places as Blanchland, Prudhoe, Durham, and Sunderland, where on occasions he encountered violent opposition. In 1744 Hopper began work as a teacher at a school at Barlow, near Ryton. His involvement in Methodist work did not endear him to the rector and curate, and led to his being charged before the spiritual court at Durham with teaching and preaching without a licence. On 28 May 1745 he married Jane Richardson (died 1755) at Ryton, and shortly afterwards the couple moved to the preacher's house at Sheephill and then, in 1748, to Allendale, Northumberland. 
By this date Hopper was formally recognized as an itinerant preacher in the Newcastle circuit. From then he travelled in the northern circuits. He was a travelling preacher at Birstall, Bolton, Bradford, Liverpool, and Manchester, as well as Newcastle, and established some of the first Methodist societies in the north of England. He travelled to Ireland several times, accompanying John Wesley on a tour between April and July 1750, and was again in attendance during Wesley's pioneering visit to Scotland in April of the following year. He was appointed president of the Methodist conference at Bristol in 1780, the only person to hold this position other than Wesley in his lifetime. Following the death of Jane on 15 August 1755, Hopper had married Ann Twizell in April 1759, although no further details are known. On superannuating in 1792 Hopper moved to Bolton, where he built a house next to the chapel. Although his activities were curtailed he managed to continue preaching in the circuit and generally made annual visits into Yorkshire and adjacent circuits. 
After a short illness Hopper died on 5 March 1802 at Bolton and was interred there in a vault in the new churchyard of St George's. The funeral sermon was preached by the Revd Thomas Cooper, circuit superintendent, from '2 Samuel' 3: 38 -- 'Know ye not that there is a prince, and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?' -- who described Hopper as 'a good man, full of faith, and mighty in scriptures. God greatly blessed his word both to saints and sinners; graciously banished all his fears, and made him as bold as a lion in the face of all his dangers. (Cooper, 396)'

Holland, William (1711-1761), Moravian leader, was born on 16 January 1711 in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, a son of Nicholas Holland. In March 1725 he was apprenticed to a relation in London, a house-painter. After completing his apprenticeship Holland returned to Wales to visit his relations, but when his former master died he moved back to London to take over the business, becoming a freeman of the City in July 1733. 
Holland had joined one of the London religious societies in 1732. In 1736 he became a devotee of the devotional writer William Law, and it was when purchasing books by Law that he met James Hutton, the apprentice of the bookseller who sold them. He joined a new group formed by Hutton, and in April 1738 attended a meeting addressed by the Moravian Peter Bohler. Holland was out of town on 1 May, when Bohler formed a Moravian-style band which was to become the Fetter Lane Society. Later that month he showed Luther's 'Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians' to Charles Wesley and had an experience of liberation as Wesley read the preface aloud. Holland now joined one of the new bands stemming from Bohler's. Holland has been identified with the 'one' whose reading of Luther's 'Preface to the Epistle to the Romans' occasioned John Wesley's 'heartwarming' experience. 
Holland remained in the Fetter Lane Society after John Wesley withdrew, and in March 1741 the Moravians assumed its leadership. On 31 March 1741 he married Elizabeth (1710-1780), daughter of Peter and Elizabeth Delamotte and sister of the Moravian evangelist William Delamotte. Elizabeth had, in the previous year, refused a proposal of marriage from George Whitefield. She and Holland had six children, of whom four predeceased their father and only one daughter outlived their mother. 
Elected one of two new society stewards in August 1741, Holland liquidated his large house-painting business in September to become a full-time 'labourer', moving from Basinghall Street to a room in the Moravians' headquarters in Little Wild Street. He was received into the Moravian church when its first English congregation was established in May 1742, and when the London congregation was founded in October 1742 Holland became its elder. In October 1743 he replaced the disaffected Richard Viney as warden of the Yorkshire congregation. 
In 1744 Holland himself became dissatisfied, sympathizing with Viney, and from August 1744 another dispute arose, over a decision that the Moravians should register their places of worship as dissenting meeting-houses. Holland was a leading opponent of this, arguing that it was contrary to the assurance which he had secured in 1742 that Anglicans received into the Moravian church could remain members of the Church of England. Eventually he acquiesced in registration under the 'Toleration Act', but he held out, ultimately alone, against acceptance of the term 'dissenter'. In 1745 he was relieved of his office and summoned to Germany, leaving with his wife in September. In Germany he wrote an important account of the early years of the English revival to support his views. 
After returning to England, Holland attended a Moravian general synod in the Netherlands in May 1746. He returned in August, and in November was sent on a mission to Wales. On his return in March 1747 he was re-admitted to the leadership's conference and sent temporarily to supervise work in Wiltshire. Back in London from July, Holland seems to have attempted to conform to the distinctive spirituality then prevailing in the Moravian church, but to no avail. In October 1747 he was told to cease preaching and resume his trade, and in December he withdrew from the Moravian church. 
Holland now associated with, but did not join, the Wesleys. Instead he returned to the communion of the Church of England and mainly attended the preaching of evangelical clergy. His wife remained a Moravian, and her mother, Elizabeth Delamotte, who lived with the Hollands at the Rolls Buildings in Fetter Lane, became one. Holland supplied information to the anti-Moravian pamphleteer Henry Rimius in 1755, but he later became more friendly towards the Moravians, and in the later 1750s his eldest son was apprenticed to a leading Yorkshire Moravian. William Holland died suddenly of a stroke at his home in Fetter Lane on 23 February 1761.

Brackenbury, Robert Carr (1752-1818), Methodist preacher, was born at Panton House in Lincolnshire and baptized on 28 April 1752, the first child of Carr Brackenbury and Isabella, daughter of William Booth of Ashby Puerorum. He was educated at Felsted School and, from 20 May 1769, at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, which he entered with the intention of taking holy orders, but it was here that a spiritual crisis turned him from his original purpose. No more is known of his Cambridge days, and in 1776 he came under the influence of John Wesley. 
From this time until the end of Wesley's life (1791) Brackenbury and Wesley met on several occasions at Brackenbury's home at Raithby in Lincolnshire, in addition to those occasions when Wesley invited Brackenbury to accompany him on his travels. In 1779 they went on a tour to Scotland, and twice (in 1783 and 1786) they journeyed to the Netherlands. In July 1779 Wesley paid his first visit to Raithby, while Brackenbury was building the hall that was to be his future home. On the estate Brackenbury built a small chapel over the stables, which Wesley opened. When Wesley visited Horncastle later the same year 'the wild men were more quiet than usual; I suppose, because they saw Mr Brackenbury standing by me, whom they knew to be in Commission for the Peace' ('Journal of John Wesley', 6.242-3). Wesley and Brackenbury also corresponded frequently. Brackenbury was one of a small number present at City Road, London, when Wesley died on 3 March 1791. 
Brackenbury married twice. His first wife, Jane, died on 3 March 1782, at the age of twenty-four, 'after a short Life of great troubles and adversities', as her monument in Raithby church records. In 1795 Brackenbury married second Sarah (died 1847) of Loughborough, daughter of Henry Holland, a captain in the Loughborough Volunteers. 
Brackenbury's most important work as a Methodist preacher was in the Channel Islands, where he was sent by Wesley in 1783 at the request of soldiers who were stationed there. He worked there in the face of much opposition and spent money building chapels. In 1790 he returned to the mainland and met a Methodist from Frome who instructed him to visit and preach on the Isle of Portland. Brackenbury spent some time in Portland but moved to other places according to his own inclinations, building chapels at his own expense, helping others financially, and supporting many charities. He wrote poetry and several hymns. He was never ordained yet Wesley made him a member of the legal hundred and his name appeared in the minutes of conference along with all of Wesley's preachers. 
Brackenbury's life was dogged by ill health, which affected his spiritual state and led to periods of depression. He was of a nervous disposition yet had great courage when faced with a violent crowd. Thomas Jackson, one of Wesley's preachers, described him thus: 'rather below the middle size, portly and well proportioned, with an open and placid countenance, rather reserved, but gentlemanly in his manners. In the pulpit his address was calm, but impressive; his sermons were received... by the Methodist congregations with gratitude and respect. (Jackson, 74-5)' There is no known portrait of him, except in silhouette.Brackenbury expressed a wish that nothing should be written about him after his death, with the result that his widow destroyed any material that would have been useful for a substantial biography. He died at Raithby on 11 August 1818 and was buried in the chancel of Raithby church, near his first wife. The 'Gentleman's Magazine' reported his death as being: 'In his 66th year... a celebrated character of the turf, though possessed of an ample future, he was for many years a zealous preacher among the Methodists, and is stated to have bequeathed $1,600 for the spreading of the Gospel. ('GM')' His will, made in 1816, shows that he owned property in the Isle of Portland, Loughborough, Charnwood Forest, and a number of Lincolnshire villages, in addition to his home in Raithby.

Blackwell, Ebenezer (d. 1782), banker, was born in Tewkesbury. In 1731 he joined Martin's Bank, Lombard Street, London, as principal clerk, later becoming a partner and retiring in 1780. In August 1739 George Whitefield entrusted to him the $15 collected for his charity school at Kingswood when he preached on Blackheath, and this brought Blackwell into correspondence with John Wesley. His country home, The Limes, Lewisham, became Wesley's favourite retreat from the pressures of London life. A number of his sermons and other publications were written there and at the end of 1753 he spent five weeks recuperating from a serious illness under the devoted nursing of Blackwell's first wife, Elizabeth ('nee' Mowland). On visiting the house in August 1782 with his brother Charles, Wesley wrote: 'We took one more walk round the garden and meadow, which he took so much pains to improve. Upward of forty years this has been my place of retirement when I could spare two or three days from London' ('Journal of... John Wesley', 6.363). Elizabeth died on 27 March 1772 and Charles Wesley wrote an elegiac poem commemorating her piety. In the same year Blackwell married Mary Eden, the niece of Robert Lowth, bishop of London. It was at the Blackwells' home that Lowth and Wesley met and exchanged courtesies on 24 November 1777, the day after Wesley preached a sermon for the Humane Society in Lewisham church. 
Blackwell's business acumen and experience were always at Wesley's disposal and their correspondence was full of financial as well as spiritual matters. Towards the end of his life he became one of the first trustees of the new City Road Chapel. Over the years he gave generous support to Wesley's charitable activities and Wesley did not hesitate to appeal to him when, for example, the growing number of poor coming to the dispensary at the Foundery Chapel left him desperately short of medicines. Wesley's letter of 4 February 1751 shows how meticulous he was, in his turn, in giving a detailed account of ways in which Blackwell's charitable gifts had been disbursed. At the same time Wesley repeatedly expressed his concern for the spiritual well-being of his Lewisham friend, seeing his 'natural cheerfulness of temper' and fear of being 'singular' as worldly temptations, and expressed the hope that he would be 'not almost only, but altogether a Christian' (16 May 1753, 'Letters of... John Wesley', 3.98-9). He repeatedly warned him of the dangers inherent in being so fully occupied with financial responsibilities: 'Engaging in these temporal affairs is apt to dampen and deaden the soul' (14 May 1747, ibid., 2.97). 'Business itself, when it comes in such a flood upon you, must needs be one of the greatest temptations, since it naturally tends to hinder your waiting upon God... without distraction' (14 Aug 1748, ibid., 2.151). And in asking for Blackwell's help with his wife's financial affairs, Wesley prayed in the same letter that he might '
serve with careful Martha's hands 

And loving Mary's heart. 
(14 May 1751, ibid., 3.67)' Blackwell became Wesley's most trusted confidant, with whom he shared both religious and marital problems. He had known Mrs Vazeille, probably through her first husband, before her marriage to Wesley, and may have been more than a passive observer of the events that led to that less-than-happy union. There was a period at the end of the 1750s when Mrs Wesley came near to effecting an estrangement between them. But the frankness they had nurtured over the years enabled their long association to hold firm. When Blackwell died on 21 April 1782, Charles Wesley wrote verses celebrating his old friend's philanthropy: '
Obedient both in word and deed, 

By works his genuine faith he showed, 

Rejoiced in Jesu's steps to tread 

And spent his life in doing good. 
('Journal of... Charles Wesley', 2.390)'

Hope, Lady Henrietta (c.1750-1786), benefactor, was born in Scotland, the second daughter of John, second earl of Hopetoun (1704-1781), and his first wife, Lady Anne Ogilvy (died 1759), the second daughter of James, earl of Findlater and Seafield. Her family consisted of eighteen brothers and sisters: nine full siblings and nine half-siblings. Recently converted, possibly through Darcy, Lady Maxwell, it was probably in October 1772 that she first met Willielma Campbell, Viscountess Glenorchy, and they became inseparable friends. Lady Glenorchy valued her advice greatly. In 1780 her father allowed Henrietta to join Lady Glenorchy, and on 17 May they left Edinburgh for London, where they visited Selina, countess of Huntingdon. Here Lady Glenorchy was taken ill, but by the end of June was well enough to travel on to Exmouth, Exeter, and Bath. From here they went to Hawkestone, Shropshire, to stay with Jane Hill, sister of the evangelical preacher Rowland Hill, before returning via Buxton to Scotland until November, when Lady Glenorchy returned to Bath. Lord Hopetoun having died in early 1781, his large family was dispersed, with Lady Henrietta going to London, where she made her home with Lady Glenorchy. 
Both were keen to promote the cause of religion and, as they travelled around 'taking the waters' for their health, they either visited churches Lady Glenorchy had already founded or started others. In 1784 Lady Glenorchy purchased a house in Matlock for use as a church and the following summer the friends took up residence there before going on to Bristol Hotwells in late September or early October. Here Henrietta's already poor health deteriorated; she became dropsical and suffered terribly during November and December before her death on 1 January 1786. The two ladies had planned to build a chapel at Hotwells, and Lady Henrietta left $2500 towards the venture. Lady Glenorchy described the plan for 'a neat place of worship, plain but elegant and which will be a suitable monument for my dear friend, Lady Henrietta, and which I mean to call Hope Chapel' (Lady Glenorchy to Lady Maxwell, 26 Feb 1786, Jones, 508-9). The building of the chapel was started, but Lady Glenorchy died on 17 July 1786 and her executrix, Lady Maxwell, carried out the friends' wishes. The structure, known as Hope Chapel, was opened on Granby Hill, Bristol, in August 1788. Lady Henrietta was described as having 'a happy temper and high accomplishments, she was distinguished for sagacity and prudence, talents which she inherited from her father' ('The Life and Times of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon', 2 vols., 1840).

Maxwell, Darcy, Lady Maxwell of Pollok (1742/3-1810), follower of Methodism and philanthropist, was born at Brisbane in Largs, Ayrshire, the youngest daughter of Thomas Brisbane. She was educated at home and in Edinburgh. On 19 February 1760, aged seventeen, she married Sir Walter Maxwell (1732-1762) of Pollok in Nithsdale. Sir Walter died on 29 April 1762 when Lady Maxwell was nineteen, and six weeks later their only child, a son, also died. This double bereavement had a profound effect on Lady Maxwell, resulting in a religious conversion: 'I see that God requires my whole heart, and He shall have it' (Lancaster, 7). Although she took no vow, she effectively consecrated herself to a celibate life, steadfastly refusing to remarry, despite many offers. She lived in or near Edinburgh after her husband's death. 
In 1764 Lady Maxwell became acquainted with John Wesley and a close lifelong friendship ensued. They corresponded regularly. When Wesley died in 1791 Lady Maxwell was delivered from grief by a quasi-visionary experience in which she 'saw' Wesley in heaven, worshipping before the throne of God. Although she had been brought up religiously in the Church of Scotland, from 1764 she worshipped in a Wesleyan chapel and joined a Methodist society. However, she still went to the Church of Scotland for holy communion -- that ordinance not being generally available in Methodist chapels. In the great Calvinist-Arminian controversy among evangelicals, she sided decisively with Wesley's Arminianism. She also espoused Wesley's doctrine of 'Christian perfection', claiming in 1787 that she had herself been perfected in love. Lady Maxwell's Arminianism and perfectionism strained her working relationship with the other leading female Scottish evangelical, the Calvinist Lady Glenorchy, although their personal friendship endured unscathed. 
Despite her gentry status Lady Maxwell dressed plainly and simply, and ran a fairly spartan household, in order to devote her wealth to philanthropic enterprises. In July 1770 she established a school for poor children in Edinburgh, managing its finances and superintending its activities personally. She also gave strong backing to the nascent Sunday school movement of Robert Raikes, founding two such schools in Edinburgh and one in London. Further, she financially supported a steady stream of evangelical students training for the ministry in Edinburgh University. 
A contemporary pen-portrait by William Atherton, reproduced in Lancaster's biography, described Lady Maxwell as tall, slender, well-proportioned, and slightly dark in complexion, her face bold and intelligent, and her eyes piercing but sweet. Her central significance for her own day was the profound impression she made on her society -- a prominent female member of the Scottish social elite whose life and personality were wholly surrendered to evangelical religion. Others found her an awe-inspiring, angelic figure. Lady Maxwell's religious experience was intense, and distinctive in its focus on the Trinity; she lived in an almost unbroken consciousness of all three persons of the godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, whom she referred to habitually as 'the Sacred Three'. Her diary and letters are a rich mine of spiritual reflections and recorded experiences. Lady Maxwell died in Edinburgh on 2 July 1810 after a long illness and was buried in the city's Greyfriars churchyard.

Murray, Grace (1715-1803), follower of Methodism, daughter of Robert and Grace Norman, was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 23 January 1715 into a Church of England family. At twenty-one she married Alexander Murray (died 1742), a sea captain, from a respectable Scottish family which had lost fortune and position through loyalty to the Stuart cause. The young couple engaged in worldly pursuits, but while her husband was at sea Grace heard John Wesley and George Whitefield preach. She was converted in 1739 and received by Charles Wesley into the London Wesleyan Methodist Society, where her name is included on the Foundery class lists of 1742. John Wesley made her one of the Foundery bandleaders. When her husband was lost at sea in 1742 Grace returned to Newcastle, where she became a class leader and was appointed housekeeper when the Orphan House in Newcastle opened in 1745. Wesley encouraged her to travel around that area, where she showed particular skill in leading women's classes. He took Grace as one of his travelling companions on his third visit to Ireland (April-July 1749). On their return Grace travelled on her own through south-east England before going back to Newcastle. Although she never attempted to preach, her work was highly regarded and done 'by Mr. Wesley's direction' (Bennet, 19). 
John Wesley contemplated marrying Grace and she was probably the nearest he came to having a true love, but the affair became very complicated. John Bennet (1715-1759), one of Wesley's most trusted and successful preachers, had fallen in love with Grace while being nursed by her at the Orphan House in 1746. They corresponded for the next two years. In August 1748 Wesley too was nursed by Grace, proposed to her, and they entered into what Wesley believed to be a formal contract of marriage on the basis of his promise to marry her. In September John Bennet also proposed and she accepted, telling him she was not committed to Wesley. For almost a year she swung between the two and in July 1749 pressed Wesley into a contract 'de praesenti', effectively a private marriage ceremony. However, it seems that Wesley's indecision, coupled with Charles Wesley's fears about the marriage, prevented Wesley from fulfilling his intentions. Charles acted swiftly and on 3 October 1749 in St Andrew's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne, Grace married Bennet in his presence. For a while it seemed there would be a serious rift between John, Charles, John Bennet, and Grace, but George Whitefield acted as reconciler. Wesley's distress at losing Grace was evident in the poem he wrote just after the event. 
In 1752 John Bennet, who had already been moving towards Calvinism, seceded from the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion and finally settled down as an Independent minister at Warburton, near Warrington. He died there in 1759 aged forty-five. After several years Grace rejoined the Wesleyan Methodists, meeting Wesley for the last time in 1788 in London. She died on 23 February 1803 and was buried in the Independent burial-ground at Chinley, Derbyshire.

Thompson, William (1733-1799), Methodist minister, was born at Newtonbutler, co. Fermanagh; little is known about his parentage or early life. It is reported how, as a young man undertaking a business journey to Dublin, Thompson heard a Methodist preach and experienced an evangelical conversion. On becoming a Methodist preacher in 1757 he crossed to Britain, where he laboured at various locations, including Newcastle upon Tyne, Leeds, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. About 1758 he was pressed as a sailor but was released through the intervention of the countess of Huntingdon. In 1764, while preaching in Lancashire, Thompson 'caught a violent cold by sleeping in a damp bed', an illness which apparently 'laid the foundation, and was the principal cause of those dreadful spasms in his stomach, which he laboured under for many years, and which, in the judgement of some of his friends, occasioned his death' (Atmore, 226). In 1769 he married in Edinburgh, though details of his wife are unknown. 
Thompson was one of the hundred preachers appointed by John Wesley in his 'Deed of Declaration' in 1784, which provided for the government of the Methodist Connexion after his own death. While serving as assistant minister of the Halifax circuit Thompson met with a group of preachers at Halifax, Yorkshire, in 1791 and produced a circular which suggested, among other things, that Wesley, having recently died, should be succeeded by a president and secretary who would be elected annually. This Halifax circular was sent out to the 'preachers in general and the assistants in particular' and described the dangers which then faced the nascent Methodist church. Owing mainly to 'Thompson's peculiar genius for ecclesiastical polity' (Atmore, 225) and his reputation as a moderate, the Methodist conference meeting at Manchester in July 1791 elected him its first president after John Wesley. 
Thompson was the main figure behind the 'plan of pacification' (1795), which tried to resolve the sacramental question. This, together with his Halifax circular, constituted him one of the main architects of Methodism as it evolved following Wesley's death. Thompson's influence was also felt in his contribution as president. He was, according to Atmore, a 'man of remarkably strong sense, a fertile genius, a clear understanding, a quick discernment, a retentive memory, and a sound judgement -- one of the closest reasoners and most able speakers that ever sat in the Methodist Conference' (Atmore, 225). 
In April 1799 ill health caused Thompson to leave Manchester and retire to Birmingham, where his eldest daughter had married a man of considerable wealth. It is reported that he 'suffered extreme pain in his last illness, which he bore with great patience, and with entire resignation to the Divine will' ('Minutes of the Methodist Conference', 511). He died at Birmingham on 1 May 1799 and his body was interred in a vault in St Mary's Chapel, Birmingham.

Creighton, James (1739-1819), Wesleyan Methodist minister, was born on 5 February 1739 at Moyne Hall, co. Cavan, Ireland, of Scottish-Irish descent. His parents, though dissenters, attended the Church of Ireland, and his mother gave him a pious upbringing. Educated at Cavan grammar school, Creighton was admitted sizar at Trinity College, Dublin, on 2 July 1760, graduating BA in 1764. Though doubting his call to the ministry, he was ordained deacon on 28 October 1764 and priest on 28 October 1765 by the bishop of Kilmore. After a curacy with the bishop and teaching at his old school in 1764-6, in 1769 he became curate of Swanlinbar, co. Cavan. 
Worried about his sins, Creighton knew little about Methodism despite correspondence with John Wesley in 1773 and reading Methodist pamphlets. However, old Anglican writings in 1775 convinced him that justification and sanctification were not new doctrines. He felt the need to be saved by faith alone and in 1776, influenced by dreams and a feeling like 'the shock of electric fire' ('Arminian Magazine', 301), he was converted. For seven years he preached his new faith in his own parish and far beyond, aided the Methodists, and alienated clerical friends. In 1781-2 he preached in seven counties and walked 4000 miles. Though Wesley failed to persuade him to become John Fletcher's curate in Madeley in 1779, in October 1783 Creighton became Wesley's assistant at City Road Chapel, London. 
In the deed of declaration of 28 February 1784, which legally defined the Methodist conference, Creighton was named immediately after the Wesleys and Thomas Coke among the 100 legal members of conference and assisted Wesley in the first ordinations for America on 1-2 September 1784. Creighton claimed that Wesley later regretted ordaining, at least for Scotland, though the ordinations continued, and in 1792 he asserted that Methodist sacraments contradicted Wesley's original plan and his claim not to separate from the Church of England. In 1787 Creighton asked Charles Wesley to approach Lord Mansfield with a plan (probably by Coke) to ask the Anglican hierarchy to keep Methodism within the Church of England by giving Wesley and his successors power to ordain preachers to supervise Methodism under its own rules. 
From 1788 to 1792 Creighton edited the 'Arminian Magazine' and continued to minister at Wesley's chapel until shortly before his death. Here he upheld dignified worship, the use of music, and choral processions for funerals, deploring noisy Methodist behaviour in worship. He was a diligent pastor, especially among the poor. Creighton's publications included poems, sermons, writings on liturgical worship and domestic duties, and 'An Enquiry into the Origins of True Religion' (2nd edn, 1817), ascribing the origins of religion and culture to the Jews. He declared himself free of bigotry, though he opposed Catholic emancipation. Disgusted with the behaviour of warring factions in Methodism in the 1790s, he took a moderating line on the power struggles between preachers and people. Though upholding conference control against anarchy, he thought local societies should have some control over preachers. Creighton was married, though details of his wife, who died in 1816, are unknown; the couple had at least two sons. He died on 26 December 1819 at his home at Hoxton Square, London, and was buried in his family grave in Henley.

Loving, Henry (1790-1850), newspaper proprietor in the West Indies, was born a slave on Antigua and manumitted at the age of nine. He was probably the son of a white slave owner and a black slave. The rest of his early life is obscure, and he first came to prominence in 1814 when he founded the 'Weekly Register' newspaper. The 'Register' was one of the first newspapers in the British West Indies run by free coloureds, but as Loving later admitted it was for many years reluctant to discuss political matters in any real depth. This seems to have been due to the influence of Loving's partner, William Hill, a trained printer, who when asked to join the paper in 1815 evidently assumed responsibility for editorial decisions. He proceeded cautiously, probably anxious to avoid alienating the white oligarchy which controlled the colony. 
After Hill's death in July 1827 the way was open for Loving to change the whole tenor of the paper. The time and circumstances were certainly propitious for such a move; the slave question was preoccupying the British government and by 1830 Antigua's other newspaper, the 'Free Press', was starting to argue for immediate abolition. Loving perhaps directed more energy to securing his political and civil rights as a free coloured, but he never neglected the plight of the slaves, and he seems to have possessed considerable influence over them. Although he had no direct connection with the plantation economy, he owned at least one domestic slave himself. He was married, with at least eight children, but the name of his wife is unknown. 
In tightly controlled and racially stratified societies like Antigua, radicalism of this kind was fraught with danger. Dubbed a 'compound of mustard and malevolence' by the pro-planter journalist James MacQueen, Loving suffered attacks which went beyond mere verbal abuse. In October 1828 the 'Register''s contract to print government notices was cancelled and a year later its editor was charged with libelling the whole community of Antigua. Loving conducted his own defence and eloquently exposed the absurdity of the charge, but his acquittal did not mark the end of his troubles. In May 1831 he was attacked and horsewhipped by a white man claiming that Loving had traduced the memory of his recently deceased brother in the 'Register'. Loving pressed charges against his assailant, and the affair resulted in several serious disturbances which highlighted the island's acute racial divisions. 
Shortly after this incident Loving travelled to England as the official representative of the Antigua free coloured corresponding committee, a group lobbying to gain full political and civil rights. While in England he addressed anti-slavery meetings and entered into a correspondence on the slave question with the under-secretary of state for the colonies, Lord Howick. Loving published this correspondence as a pamphlet, somewhat disingenuously claiming that he had been in direct contact with the secretary of state, Viscount Goderich. He also gave impressive testimony before the government select committee on the extinction of slavery throughout the British empire. 
Loving returned to Antigua in June 1832, having been instrumental in obtaining the concession of civil rights to Antiguan free coloureds. He resumed the editorship of the 'Register' but for less than a year; in May 1833 he announced his retirement from both the newspaper and from journalism. The battles he had been involved in may have taken a personal toll and comments he made later indicated a deep disillusionment with politics. He briefly ran a general store in St John's but in July 1834 the governor of the Leewards, Sir Evan Murray-MacGregor, appointed him superintendent of the Antigua police. Again controversy dogged him as the decision provoked an outcry from white people who were appalled at the prospect of a coloured man occupying such an important position. By March 1836 he was acting private secretary to Murray-MacGregor and in July of the following year was appointed as a stipendiary magistrate in Barbados, charged with ensuring the smooth working of the apprenticeship system. In March 1838 he took up the post of secretary and clerk to the crown on Montserrat, despite Murray-MacGregor's caution about accepting the post. The move proved a mistake; not only was his salary cut drastically but at one point he went for two years without receiving any pay at all. He attempted to solicit promotion from the Colonial Office but failed and eventually returned to Antigua. For two years before this he had suffered a debilitating illness, which robbed him of his mental powers. He probably died at St John's, Antigua, in 1850.

Beechey, Henry William (1788/9-1862), painter and explorer, was born probably at 37 Hill Street, Berkeley Square, London, the eldest son of the portrait painter Sir William Beechey (1753-1839) and his first wife. Nothing is known of his education. In August 1815 he became secretary to Henry Salt, the newly appointed British consul-general in Egypt, who commented that he drew well and understood both French and Italian. In 1817 he was sent by Salt to oversee the excavations of Giovanni Belzoni at Thebes and to make drawings of the monuments, including the interior of the newly discovered tomb of Seti I. He joined Belzoni and captains Charles Leonard Irby and James Mangles in digging out the buried temple of Abu Simbel, and some of his drawings illustrate this section of the captains' account of their travels. In 1818-19 he accompanied Salt and William John Bankes to Abu Simbel and, with Bankes, made an unsuccessful attempt to reach Meroe in upper Nubia. Recalled to England by his father, he left Egypt in October 1819. 
During 1821-2, having been appointed by Earl Bathurst for the Colonial Office, Beechey and his half-brother, Lieutenant Frederick William Beechey RN (1796-1856), surveyed the coastline of north Africa from Tripoli to Darnah. Henry's part was to examine and report on the antiquities of Cyrenaica, and he illustrated the chronicle of the expedition published by the brothers in 1828. He became an FSA in 1825. At the Royal Academy in 1829 he exhibited a seascape, and in 1838 a portrait of Mrs Worthington; another seascape was shown at the British Institution in 1838. He wrote a painstaking and thoughtful memoir of Sir Joshua Reynolds to preface the 1835 edition of Reynolds's 'Literary Works'. 
On 14 November 1824 Beechey married Maria Frost. His wife died, and on 23 August 1834 he married Harriet Eyres (1809/10-1864); there were children of both marriages. Apparently beset by vicissitudes in England, at the age of sixty-one and accompanied by Harriet, four of his children, and a daughter-in-law, he emigrated to New Zealand in the 'Castle Eden', arriving there on 7 February 1851. He took up land and farmed it at Governors Bay, Lyttleton, near Christchurch, where he died of pulmonary congestion on 4 August 1862. He was buried in the cemetery at Lyttleton on 7 August. 
Beechey's half-brother, Richard Brydges Beechey (1808-1895), marine painter and naval officer, was born on 17 May 1808, probably at 13 Harley Street, Cavendish Square, London, the youngest son of Sir William Beechey and his second wife, Anne Phyllis Beechey, nee Jessop (1764-1833) ['see under 'Beechey, Sir William], who was herself a painter of miniatures. He entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, on 1 March 1821. From March 1825 to September 1828, as a midshipman in HMS 'Blossom' commanded by his brother, Captain Frederick William Beechey, he was on a voyage of discovery in the south seas and north to the Bering Strait in an attempt to re-provision Captain John Franklin's polar expedition. Richard provided two illustrations to Frederick's account of the voyage. His brother George Beechey was also a painter. 
Promoted lieutenant on 15 September 1828, Richard Beechey was from then, as he wrote in 1844, 'except for three years when ill health prevented me... constantly in active service of some shape or other' (BL, Add. MS 38039/446). In 1835 he was appointed to the survey service in Ireland, in which he remained until put on half pay in 1857. He was promoted commander on 31 March 1846 and captain on 1 January 1857. Although he retired on 2 July 1864, he became an admiral, on seniority, on 31 March 1885. He married Frideswaide, daughter of Robert Smyth of Portlich Castle, co. Westmeath, Ireland. 
From 1832 to 1877 Richard Beechey exhibited seascapes nearly every year at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, or the Suffolk Street Gallery, London. His retirement enabled him to concentrate on his art, and during that time he often worked up sketches made during his naval service. Brook-Hart says of him that he was of 'quite considerable talent and competence' (Brook-Hart, 339); according to Archibald, 'the best painter the navy ever produced' (Archibald, 65). Richard Beechey died at his home, 9 Portland Terrace, Southsea, Hampshire, on 8 March 1895.

Anna Palmer (fl. 1393-1394). An anchoress living in a house next to St Peter's parish church in Northampton, in 1393 she was summoned before Bishop John Buckingham of Lincoln (died 1399) on fifteen charges of heresy and the separate one of incontinence, as well as of being the principal hostess of Lollards ('receptrix lollardorum') in the area. She was said to have received prominent Lollards in her house at night, while secret conventicles and illicit congregations were held. When she appeared before the bishop she denounced him as Antichrist and his clerks as Antichrist's disciples, and informed him proudly that she did not wish to answer the charges against her, except the charge of incontinence, which she denied. Her intransigence brought her detention in the episcopal prison at Banbury and a summons the next year to a further examination in London, at which point she disappears from record.

Christina More (fl. 1412-1414) and her husband, William (who was a member of the governing class of Bristol), formed a prominent Lollard household in that town in the early years of the fifteenth century. They kept a Lollard chaplain, William Blake. On her husband's death in 1412 Christina took over both the management of his estate and his patronage of Lollards, even to the extent of equipping Blake and a servant named James Merrshe, and perhaps other servants, for their part in Oldcastle's rising in 1414. On this account she was among eight Lollards from Bristol who were prosecuted by Bishop Nicholas Bubwith of Bath and Wells (died 1424), and maybe her social position alone saved her from a worse penalty than trial and purgation. 
Between 1428 and 1431 Bishop William Alnwick of Norwich (died 1449) conducted a determined and unusually well-documented campaign against heretics in his diocese. Two women stand out in the records of the trials that resulted. The first of these,

Margery Baxter (fl. 1428-1429), was described as the wife of William Baxter, wright, of Martham when she was brought to trial in October 1428. William had already been convicted as a heretic but his wife's greatest reverence was reserved for the former priest and Lollard evangelizer from Tenterden in Kent, William White, whom she called 'a great saint in heaven and a most holy doctor ordained and sent by God' (Tanner, 47). She admitted having transported White's books from Yarmouth and hiding him in her house for five days, as well as having learned from him the six heretical articles charged against her. The articles are notable for their radical nature and social content: only the person who keeps God's commandments may be considered a Christian; the sacrament of confession is to be avoided because it implies a lack of hope in God's mercy; pilgrimages should be made only to poor people; capital punishment and all other killing of humans is wrong; every good person is a priest; oaths are permissible only in a law court. She abjured her errors and was sentenced to severe and exemplary penance: she was to receive four floggings at her parish church on successive Sundays, and two more in a market place -- probably that of nearby Acle -- and to present herself with other penitents to do 'solemn penance' in Norwich Cathedral on the next Ash Wednesday and Maundy Thursday. 
Six months later, in April 1429, Margery was again brought before Bishop Alnwick charged with heresy. By this time she and her husband appear to have moved to Norwich. In these proceedings only the depositions against her survive, but they have a ring of truth about them, and once again suggest a formidable and intriguing personality, somewhat eccentric, an individualist remarkable for her strength of mind and irreverence, especially towards the clergy and orthodox religion. According to these depositions, she proselytized other people, sometimes alone and sometimes with her husband, both in their houses and in her own home, preferably, it seems, at night, or just as she met them. A vivid picture of her activities was given in evidence by Joan Clyfland of Norwich. Margery visited her home in midwinter and, 'sitting and sewing by the fire' (Tanner, 44), she instructed Joan and Joan's two teenage servants, Joan Grymle and Agnes Bethom, in a lengthy question-and-answer session. The situation provided perfect circumstances for an indoctrinating conversation -- in all-female company, Joan Clyfland's husband being absent -- and is very suggestive of how women might use their domestic roles to proselytize. 
When a Carmelite friar threatened to denounce Margery as a heretic after she had tried unsuccessfully to convert him, she in turn threatened to denounce him for sexually harassing her, and warned that her husband wished to kill him, thus escaping detection. She denounced the whole ecclesiastical hierarchy of pope, cardinals, and bishops, 'for they falsely and cursedly deceive the people with their false mawmentries and laws to extort money from simple people in order to sustain their pride, luxury and idleness' (Tanner, 49). Her own bishop of Norwich she referred to as Caiaphas. Of her own invulnerability she was convinced: even if she was convicted of Lollardy she would not be burnt, since she had 'a charter of protection in her womb' (ibid.) -- an interesting remark, suggesting the belief that women were exempt from being burnt if they were pregnant. In fact, however, she may have escaped death, the penalty of a relapsed heretic, by agreeing to witness against another person from Martham, John Pyry. 
If Margery Baxter was something of a loner, the other prominent Lollard woman to appear in Alnwick's court,

Hawise Mone (fl. 1428-1430), was a social Lollard 'par excellence'. She was the wife of a prosperous shoemaker, Thomas Mone, of the town of Loddon. Their household was a hive of Lollard activity: those directly involved included, in addition to themselves, a daughter and three men who were, or had been, their servants or apprentices of Thomas. 'Schools of heresy' were held in 'privy chambers and places' of theirs (Tanner, 140) -- presumably in their house in Loddon -- which many people attended and in which William White and other leading Lollards taught. Hawise was also accused of organizing in her home what appears to have been a ritual breaking of the Lenten fast, in which she and several other people ate a meal of pork on the day before Easter Sunday. In the fast-breaking, moreover, she acted independently of her husband, who was absent from the proceedings. Indeed, she appears to have been at least as important as her husband for Lollardy in the area, perhaps more so, in both her organizational ability and her knowledge of the movement's teachings. Margery Baxter appreciated her highly. Hawise, she said, was the 'most distinguished and wisest woman' (ibid., 47) in her knowledge of the teaching of William White. She was tried and convicted in August 1430, a fortnight before her husband, and abjured her heresies. Nothing more is heard of her thereafter.

Joan Washingby (d. 1512) of Coventry was an enterprising Lollard of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. She had learned her heresy from Alice Rowley, a leading Coventry Lollard, about 1490. When still a young woman she had moved first to Northampton and then to London, perhaps going from one Lollard household to another. In London, where she stayed for three years and married, she lodged with a bedder called Blackbyre, whose wife, Joan, was already a Lollard. She and her husband, Thomas Washingby, a shoemaker who was also a heretic, then moved to Maidstone in Kent, possibly also a Lollard centre at this time, where in 1495 she had to abjure her heretical beliefs. Later she returned to Coventry and participated actively once more in the Lollard movement in the town. Finally the ecclesiastical authorities caught up with her again, and in March 1512 she was condemned as a relapsed heretic and handed over to the secular arm to be burnt. She is known to have owned at least one Lollard book, and there is some evidence to suggest that she used her travels to distribute such books among members of the movement.

Agnes Grebill (d. 1511) was a poignant case. Knowledge of her comes largely from the evidence given against her, mostly by members of her own family, at her trial in 1511. According to this information, her husband, John, was a weaver in Tenterden and later in neighbouring Benenden, Kent; she was first taught Lollard beliefs by him towards the end of the reign of Edward IV, when she was aged about thirty. She had two sons and a daughter, though whether John was the father of the sons is unclear, since at one point they are described as her 'natural sons'. Initially her husband appears to have continued to take the lead, but with her co-operation. They instructed the children in their beliefs and became central figures in a wide network of Lollards in Kent. 
When in 1511 she was brought to trial before Archbishop William Warham of Canterbury (died 1532), Agnes Grebill was at least sixty years old. Why members of her family betrayed her is unclear, especially since the family had sworn itself to secrecy at an earlier date; it may well be that those concerned were granted lenient treatment in their own trials in return for witnessing against her. She was accused of heretical beliefs and practices regarding the seven sacraments, especially the eucharist, images, pilgrimages, prayers to the saints, holy water, and blessed bread. Her husband provided the crucial depositions against her, supported by her two sons. Confronting them in person, she wholly rejected their allegations and wished her sons had never been born. Again, four days later, she protested her innocence. Rejecting her protestation, the archbishop pronounced her an obstinate heretic and handed her over to the secular arm to be put to death. 
Other women provide some further glimpses. Many opponents of Lollardy, mainly clerics, criticized the movement for advancing women beyond their station in religious matters, notably as teachers and preachers; some thought that women priests existed among them. Of the last, no clear instances are known, and in any case, in view of the emphasis placed by Lollards on the priesthood of all believers and downgrading of the sacerdotal priesthood, the issue may have been not very important. Certainly there was a wide range of roles and activities within the Lollard movement that were open to women, as has already been seen. 
Regarding the celebration of the eucharist by women, there was the case mentioned by Henry Knighton (died 'c'.1396), an opponent of Lollardy, under the year 1391: 'There was a certain matron in the city of London who had an only daughter whom she instructed to celebrate mass, and she set up an altar with its furnishings in her secret chamber, and got her daughter for many days to dress as a priest and go to the altar and to celebrate mass after her manner; but when she reached the sacramental words she prostrated herself before the altar and did not consecrate the sacrament; but rising completed all the rest of the mass to the end with her mother assisting and attending her devotion.('Chronicon Henrici Knighton, vel Cnitthon, monachi Leycestrensis', ed. J. R. Lumby, 2 vols., Rolls Series, 1889-95, 2.316-17; translation in Aston, 454-5)' A report eventually leaked out through a woman neighbour who attended the service, and the case came to the ears of the bishop of London. The daughter was discovered, her priestly tonsure was exposed to public view, and she herself was put to penance. 
Recitation and rote learning were exercises in which women often seem to have played a leading role: Reginald Pecock, bishop of Chichester (died in or after 1459), who was generally well informed about Lollardy, thought that quoting scripture was characteristic of women Lollards. In the early sixteenth century

Alice Colins (fl. 1521), wife of the learned Richard Colins of Ginge in Berkshire, was reported as famous among Lollards for her good memory, so that 'when any conventicle... did meet at Burford, commonly she was sent for, to recite... the ten commandments and the epistles of Peter and James' (Hudson, 191); her daughter, Joan, was able to recite the elements of religion and knew by heart the epistle of James, and the daughter of a fellow Lollard was sent into service in the Colins household, precisely so that 'she might be instructed there in God's law' (McSheffrey, 'Gender and Heresy', 98). Alice Rowley of Coventry, mentioned earlier, often read publicly before men. Alice Gardiner of Colchester, from the 1490s onward, was another woman who seems to have busied herself educating the next Lollard generation. 
A broad spectrum of social backgrounds was represented among Lollard women, though the very highest ranks of society appear largely absent, as was the case among men. There is evidence of Lollard women among the urban elites of London, Coventry, and Bristol, at least in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Lady Jane Yonge, who was suspected of heresy and may have died a Lollard martyr, was the widow of Sir John Yonge, lord mayor of London; her mother, Joan Boughton, was burnt for Lollardy at Smithfield in 1494. There is some evidence of wives of Lollard knights who sympathized with their husbands' views -- for example, Dame Anne Latimer, widow of Sir Thomas Latimer of Braybrooke (d. 1401) -- but the majority seem to have come from the artisan classes, here too following the pattern among Lollard men. Of the several thousand Lollards who are identifiable between the 1370s and 1530s, women represented something like a quarter, though there seems to have been a marked increase, both proportionally and absolutely, in the years after about 1490. Most of them were married to Lollard men. That many women were Lollards must have feminized the movement in many ways. On the whole their roles were channelled within the accepted social norms, but some women, through favourable circumstances, were able to attain positions of prominence both within the movement and in society at large.

Indian visitors (act. c.1720-c.1810) came from many social classes and backgrounds. They rose in number from a few in the seventeenth century to over a thousand annually by the first decade of the nineteenth century. Indian seamen and male and female servants proved most numerous among them. Indian businessmen, diplomats, and travellers often appeared more individually prominent in British society. In addition, the Indian wives, mistresses, and children of Europeans occasionally visited Britain. Further, some Indians, for example Sake Deen Mahomed (1759-1851), remained in Britain as immigrants. 
Some elite Indian visitors wrote books describing their explorations in Britain for the edification of Indian readers, thus shaping Indian perceptions of Britain; others wrote for British audiences, thus influencing how Britons viewed Asia and Asians. Male elite Indian visitors repeatedly commented about their relatively free social intercourse with British women of their own social class, a level of association convention in India would not have permitted between their own womenfolk and European male visitors. They also uniformly remarked on how parochial the British public proved to be, as illustrated by the large number of mystified but well-disposed Britons who gathered round them whenever they appeared in public wearing their Indian clothing. During the eighteenth century none of these Indian accounts mentions any racial hostility against them, rather only the celebrity status they enjoyed. The far more numerous lower-class Indian visitors rarely described their own experiences. Nevertheless, British judicial documents, newspaper reports, and manuscripts and books record their presence. Many occasionally encountered less hospitable and more prejudicial attitudes from Britons than did elite Indian visitors. 
Over the eighteenth century growing seaborne trade between India and Europe created demand for Indian sailors. Ships leaving India faced shortages of European seamen due to European wars, high levels of shipboard deaths from disease or injury, and desertions by Europeans on arrival in India. In their places Indian sailors ('lascars') consequently shipped in growing numbers for Britain, especially London, despite the 'Navigation Acts' and other parliamentary legislation seeking to minimize or prohibit their employment on British ships. These Indian sailors were often recruited by Indian labour contractors ('ghat sarangs') and commanded by Indian petty officers ('sarangs' and 'tindals'). In Britain the East India Company and British government attempted to isolate these Indian sailors and return them quickly to India. Nevertheless, countless Indian sailors, including Emin Joseph Emin (1726-1809), evaded these attempts and remained as visitors in Britain for considerable periods. Many such Indian visitors found temporary work in England, especially as dock workers, chimney sweeps, crossing sweepers, street entertainers, and itinerant vendors. Some ran lodging houses for other Indian visitors. Marriage between male Indian visitors and British women of their class appears to have been fairly common, with their children staying on even when their fathers returned to India. 
Higher-class Europeans and Indians travelling from India to Britain often brought Indian servants with them. Some of these servants appear in British paintings and, dressed in 'oriental' livery, added exotic dignity to elite British households. Numerous Indian servants advertised in British newspapers for employment. Most eventually left Britain, often working for Britons on the voyage to India. Included among Indian servants were domestic slaves, such as

Mirza Abu Talib Khan Isfahani (1752-1806) visited Ireland in 1799, England in 1800-3, and the continent. British high society received him under his self-styled title 'the Persian prince'. He later wrote in Persian both a prose account of his travels (and critical opinions of British society), 'Masir-i Talibi fi bilad-i Afranji' ('Talib's travels in the lands of the Europeans', completed by 1805), and also a 'mathnavi' (poem in rhyming couplets) of 1000 verses about his visit. He particularly noted the loose habits of European women, compared to elite Muslim Indians. To prove his point he wrote an essay, 'Vindication of the liberties of the Asiatic women', which demonstrated how the cold climate, monogamy, provincialism, and commercial activities of England forced Englishwomen into close quarters with their husbands and also into the degrading public sphere of business. In contrast, Abu Talib asserted that, owing to the more cosmopolitan and diverse society of India, Muslim women there enjoyed life in a separate, autonomous, luxurious, and congenial women's sphere, protected by purdah. 
Additionally, many Indian wives or mistresses of European men of various classes, from private soldiers to aristocrats, visited Britain, some remaining as immigrants. For example

Although employed by Russell, Isma'il brought along two Indian servants of his own. Isma'il later wrote 'Tarikh-i jadid' ('New history') in Persian. He was particularly impressed with the hot springs of Bath and with Britain's extensive newspaper industry and numerous coffee houses. 
Many Indian businessmen believed that direct personal appeals to the East India Company's court of directors or the British government could override adverse actions or policies by company officials in India.

Anderson, David (1751-1825), East India Company servant, was born in Edinburgh on 10 February 1751, the second of the eight children of David Anderson (1707-1786), writer to the signet, and his wife, Mary (died 1781), daughter of John Mitchelson of Middleton, Edinburghshire. 
After attending the high school in Edinburgh, Anderson secured a writership in the East India Company in 1766, arriving in India in July 1767. He was employed for three years in Calcutta before moving to Murshidabad, where the nawab of Bengal and his court resided. The appointment of Warren Hastings as governor of Bengal in 1772 with instructions to reform the administration and to take over the management of the revenues from the nawab's officials found Anderson well placed to catch the governor's eye. The 'diwan', the office for revenue administration, was transferred from Murshidabad to Calcutta, but Hastings also assumed responsibility for the criminal and police administration, the 'nizamat'. As assistant to the resident at Murshidabad, Anderson was directly concerned in this reorganization; in particular he was commissioned by Hastings to offer Muhammad Reza Khan, the nawab's deposed chief minister, continuance in offices other than the management of the nawab's household if he promised not to intrigue against Hastings, an offer that was rejected. By 1776 Anderson was fourth in council at Murshidabad but about to become one of Hastings's most trusted agents. 
The revenue settlement of 1772 was due to expire in 1777 and Hastings, by now governor-general, convinced that the information available to the supreme council on revenue matters was nowhere near adequate for it to do its job properly, set up a commission in November 1776 to collect and present statistics and other data relating to land values in order to provide the raw material for a new settlement. The business of the commission, or 'amini' office as it was termed, was co-ordinated by three company officials chosen by Hastings, of whom Anderson was one. The 'amini' scheme was opposed by General Clavering and Philip Francis in the supreme council and by their followers in the country, and Anderson's selection for the commission was an indication of the confidence that Hastings had come to repose in him. The commission presented its report in March 1778, in which year Anderson was named a supernumerary member of council at Patna. 
Now acknowledged as a revenue expert, Anderson became president of the Calcutta revenue committee in 1781. Its purpose was to act as a focal point for the entire administration of the revenue, replacing the dispersed provincial councils. However, Anderson was called away from revenue matters to undertake a diplomatic mission to the Marathas, although during his absence he drew a salary for his original office in addition to his new one. He was dispatched with plenipotentiary powers to represent Hastings at the court of Mahadji Sindhia, one of the principal Maratha leaders, to seek an end to the war that had dragged on since 1775. The component states in the Maratha confederacy were diverse in their aims, disunited, and erratic. With Sindhia as intermediary, who himself had difficulty in reconciling the various Maratha factions, Anderson, after months of negotiation punctuated by long periods of waiting, secured the treaty of Salbai in May 1782 which ended the First Anglo-Maratha War. Even then the treaty was not finally ratified until the following year. Hastings's regard for Anderson is illustrated in his correspondence. On 15 March 1782 he wrote to Anderson that 'our confidence in you... is unbounded' (Gleig, 2.532), while on 28 March 1783 he informed the court of directors that the treaty had been gained by 'the peculiar talents and wariness of Mr. David Anderson' (ibid., 3.84). 
Anderson returned to Britain with Hastings in the 'Berrington'. He landed at Plymouth on 13 June 1785 and reached Edinburgh nine days later, where he was made a freeman of the city. At the age of thirty-four he settled down to pass the next forty years as a Scottish country gentleman. He was able to do so thanks to the proceeds of private financial and trading ventures while in India, abetted latterly by Hastings's generosity regarding his emoluments. Aspirations to 'a small estate in a pleasant part of Scotland' expressed in a letter to his father (11 Jan 1778, BL, Add. MS 45438, fol. 141) were amply realized in 1782, when Anderson purchased St Germains, near Tranent and some 10 miles north-east of Edinburgh. On the point of leaving India, in a letter to his brother James, he reckoned that 'my whole Fortune is about $50,000' (4 Feb 1785, BL, Add. MS 45437, fol. 17). Anderson married Christian (died 1824), the daughter of Robert Findlay of Drummore, on 14 August 1788. They had three sons, one of whom was named after Hastings, and two daughters. Anderson was also the father of at least one natural child born in India: a daughter christened Mary at Monghyr on 8 April 1775. 
As an executor of Hastings's policies and as a particular friend, Anderson was drawn into the impeachment proceedings. He contributed to Hastings's speech at the bar of the house and dealt coolly with hostile questioning before a Commons committee of the whole house in March 1787. He gave evidence in two appearances at Hastings's trial in May 1790. The two exchanged visits and corresponded regularly until Hastings's death in 1818. 
Anderson's portrait, painted by Sir Henry Raeburn in 1790, shows a slender, well-preserved, earnest man of about forty. His uneventful retirement was briefly disturbed in 1797 when, as deputy lieutenant of East Lothian, he took a small part in suppressing an anti-militia riot in Tranent. Anderson died at St Germains on 2 August 1825.

Atkinson, Richard (1739-1785), merchant and director of the East India Company, was born in Westmorland on 10 March 1739 and baptized on 5 April at St James's Church, Temple Sowerby, Westmorland. He was the third son of Matthew Atkinson of Temple Sowerby and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Richard Sutton of Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland. He moved to London 'unsustained by any inheritance, by few family friends of any power, and by no acquisitions which education imparts but common penmanship and arithmetic' ('GM', 570). 
By the early 1770s Atkinson was a partner in the firm of Mure, Son, and Atkinson, West India merchants of Nicholas Lane, later of Fenchurch Street. During the American War of Independence he held lucrative contracts to supply the British forces in North America and Gibraltar. It was at this time also that he purchased sufficient East India Company stock to enable him to vote in the annual elections of company directors and on the major issues of the day that came before the company's court of proprietors. Influential City merchants like Atkinson were called on by the government of Lord North to support its efforts to reform the company's administration. Atkinson was a close confidant of John Robinson (also from Westmorland), Lord North's secretary to the Treasury and political manager. Atkinson's East India business interests included connections with Paul Benfield, the notorious 'nabob'. Benfield had been removed by the directors from his company position in Madras for misdemeanours and was a prominent creditor of the nawab of Arcot, the company's puppet ruler in the Carnatic. Atkinson acted as Benfield's London agent, and helped secure his reinstatement in 1781. Through Benfield, Atkinson became involved with the nawab's creditors in London -- the 'Arcot interest' -- who aimed to persuade the company to legitimize the nawab's debts and make provision for their repayment. 
By the early 1780s Atkinson was no longer taking a government line in East India affairs and was a member of the company committee appointed by stockholders to oppose Fox's 'India Bill' in 1783. He was now increasingly acting with the company's various 'Indian' factions which had come together to defend the governorship of Warren Hastings from government attack. They attached themselves to the party forming round William Pitt. When Fox's bill failed and his supporters in the company's court of directors resigned, Atkinson was one of three new directors swept into office by the tide of opinion running against Fox within the company. James Macpherson, London agent for the nawab of Arcot, told Hastings: 'how much we all owe, in these disagreeable times, to the ability, friendship and exertions of Mr. Atkinson. I have mentioned in another letter the great talents and extensive influence of the gentleman; and how happy I was to find that he is inclined to employ both against the current of injustice and proscription which now prevails here against our Eastern friends. (Macpherson to Hastings, 22 April 1782, BL, Add. MS 29154, fol. 134)' Atkinson stood unsuccessfully for London with Pitt's support in the 1784 general election, but was returned for New Romney shortly afterwards. He spoke frequently in the house on East India matters and was regarded by the political commentator Nathaniel Wraxall as 'able and intelligent' and as invariably speaking 'with brevity, and never venturing to deviate into tracks with which he was unacquainted' (HoP, 'Commons, 1754-90'). Following the passing of Pitt's 'India Act' of 1784, Atkinson put his services at the disposal of Henry Dundas, president of the new India Board of Control. He plied Dundas (unsuccessfully) with proposals for further reform of the company's administration, stating on 22 July that he had 'not one personal View in the power of the Company to gratify' other than to ensure the 'success of a Reform in the introductory steps to which I have taken so forward a part' (Furber, 488). He did, however, continue to press the case of the Arcot creditors, and had encouraged the company's directors to oppose a clause in Pitt's draft 'India Bill' requiring the company to investigate the debts. This may subsequently have contributed to Dundas's unwillingness to adopt his schemes for company reform, but in any case it was clear that Atkinson was seriously ill with consumption. He died, unmarried, on 28 May 1785 at Brighton, said to be worth $300,000 ('GM', 570).

Boughton, Sir Charles William Rouse-, ninth baronet and first baronet (1747-1821), politician, the son of Shuckburgh Boughton (died 1760) and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Greville, of Poston Court, Herefordshire, was baptized on 10 December 1747 in the parish of St Nicholas, Worcester. 
Boughton was appointed a writer by the East India Company in 1764 to Bengal, and after 1768 used the name Rouse as he had become the heir of his cousin Thomas Rouse. He was appointed supervisor of Nator (Rajshahi district) in 1769, one of the most valuable areas that the East India Company had just acquired in Bengal. The 22-year-old Rouse was expected, according to the new regulations, to report on the tax collections, to give a careful account of the economic conditions of the region, to see that justice was enforced, to extirpate corruption, and to abolish arbitrary fines. In his letters to his superior in Murshidabad, the capital, he acknowledged that he had been criticized for having shown undue concern for the peasants, but he defended himself with the argument that humane treatment was the only way to get the people to accept the rule of foreigners alien in race, religion, and language. He became involved in the debate over the tax system that should be used in Bengal, arguing that the 'zamindars' were the actual owners of their lands, not just tax collectors, or tax farmers, to be appointed because they made the highest bid for the office, as many company officials argued. This position aligned him with Philip Francis, a member of the supreme council of Bengal, and against Warren Hastings, the governor-general, in one of the most celebrated disputes over the nature of the company's administration. Francis was impressed by the young Rouse, and, telling him that 'with respect to great fundamental principles, your ideas coincide with mine', used many of Rouse's detailed minutes for his own work (Weitzman, 304). Rouse continued to be helpful to Francis in England in his attacks on Hastings. A competent student of Persian, which he learned in Bengal, he translated part of the great Mughal work on government 'A'in-i-Akbari'. He left the company's service in 1778 and returned to England, but remained involved in Indian affairs. According to Edmund Burke, Rouse had an important role in the select committee appointed by parliament in 1781 to investigate the activities of the East India Company and Warren Hastings. Much of the detailed material on land revenue as well as background on Hastings seems to have been supplied in private meetings before and during the meetings of the select committee ('Correspondence', 4.355-8; 'Writings and Speeches', 6.55, 67). In 1791 he published 'Dissertation Concerning the Landed Property of Bengal', in which he showed an unusual knowledge of taxation and land tenures. 
Elected MP for Evesham in 1780, Rouse retained the seat until 1790 as a supporter of William Pitt. He was one of the forty-two members in that parliament who belonged to what was known as the 'Indian interest', that is, 'nabobs' who had served in the East India Company. On 3 June 1782 he married Catherine Hall (died 1808), who was the daughter and heir of William Pearce Hall of Downton Hall, Shropshire. They had a son, William, who eventually succeeded to his titles, and two daughters, Louisa and Caroline. His wife's connections, and those of his mother with the Greville family, were factors in his access to William Pitt and other leading politicians. In 1784 he became the secretary of the Board of Control, the body set up by parliament to oversee the affairs of the East India Company, but he was dismissed in 1791, apparently because he had opposed some of the measures of Henry Dundas, the president of the board. In recognition of his services to Pitt's ministry, he was created baronet in July 1791. At this point he added his original family name of Boughton as Boughton-Rouse, but in 1794, when he inherited the family title of ninth baronet, he began using the name Rouse-Boughton. 
Rouse-Boughton tried, unsuccessfully, in 1795 to get Pitt to reappoint him as secretary to the Board of Control, pleading that he was in need as his elder brother had left the family estate, valued at $50,000, to his daughter by a maidservant. He was elected as an MP for Bamber in 1796, one of the fifty-seven members of that parliament who belonged to the 'Indian interest'. Rouse spoke occasionally on Indian affairs in parliament, generally defending the East India Company's political activities. He had hoped that Pitt would give him an office that would let him keep his parliamentary seat, but when nothing was forthcoming, he resigned in January 1800 to become an audit commissioner. He died on 26 February 1821 at his home, Downton Hall, Shropshire.

Chapman, Charles (1752-1809), East India Company servant and emissary to Vietnam, was born on 23 November 1752, son of Charles Chapman (died 'c'.1796), army officer. After the obligatory attendance at a commercial academy, in his case at Hoxton, Chapman was appointed a writer in the East India Company's Bombay service in 1773. In 1775 he was permitted to go to Bengal, where his father, who had transferred to the company's service, had briefly been commander-in-chief. In Bengal, Chapman was employed in the governor-general's office, attracting the attention of Warren Hastings, who formed a high opinion of his abilities. In return, Chapman became a devoted adherent of Hastings for the rest of his life. Hastings's judgement of his subordinates was usually discriminating and Chapman seems to have been one of the ablest company servants of his generation. Later in his life, however, a friend observed that 'quickness and irritability... are inherent in his nature and mark his character' (J. Wiltshire to W. Hastings, 28 Dec 1806, BL, Add. MS 29181, fol. 368). 
The arrival of two Vietnamese mandarins in Calcutta on a British ship in 1778 gave Chapman an opportunity for distinguishing himself. He volunteered to return to Vietnam with the mandarins as an emissary for the Bengal government. His offer was accepted and an expedition of two small ships was fitted out. Vietnam in 1778 was in a state of political disorder. The Nguyen regime in Annam, whose servants the mandarins were, was losing control to the rebel Tay-son movement and to the Trinh dynasty of the north. Chapman spent time both with the Tay-son leader and with the Trinh authorities now established at Hue, capital of Annam. He eventually had to flee from Hue, after what seemed at first to have been a favourable reception. He returned to Calcutta in February 1779. He then compiled both a narrative of his time in Vietnam and a report for the Bengal government. 'No country in the East', he wrote, 'and perhaps none in the world, produces richer or a greater variety of articles proper for carrying on an advantageous commerce.' The Vietnamese he described as 'a courteous, affable, inoffensive race, rather inclined to indolence' (Lamb, 131, 133). He recommended the dispatch of a small military expedition to establish a trading connection and to frustrate French designs. These recommendations were not followed up. 
Chapman's next diplomatic mission was to the Maratha ruler of Berar in central India from November 1781 to November 1783. In the 1770s the East India Company had been drawn into a war with the Marathas. Hastings had successfully negotiated to keep Berar, whose territories extended up to the frontier of Bengal, out of the war. By 1781, however, Hastings was turning his main effort for peace making with the Marathas to Sindhia, a rival of Berar. Chapman's mission was intended to reconcile Mudhoji Bhonsla, the Berar raja, to this initiative. Chapman remained at Nagpur, Mudhoji's capital, for two years, leaving when he felt that he was being treated 'with reserve and distance' (BL OIOC, H 219, p. 317). 
Chapman's will reveals that he had a son called Henry, born out of wedlock, presumably with an Indian mistress. (It is possible that this was the natural child whose birth to 'Chapman and Elizabeth' was recorded on 11 July 1779 (BL OIOC, N/1/3, fol. 48).) He remained in India after Chapman's return to Britain. Charles Chapman married Mary Williams in Calcutta on 18 February 1784; they appear to have had no children. 
From 1786 to 1789 Chapman was on furlough in Britain. On his return to Bengal he took over the management of such assets as Hastings had left behind in India. This involved him in sensitive negotiations with Indians whom he invited to subscribe money to relieve Hastings's financial difficulties during his impeachment. Chapman rose in the Bengal civil service to become the most senior member of the board that managed the revenue of the province. In 1794, having been passed over for the presidency of the board, he chose to leave Calcutta, where he had been unable to save money, and take up a less prestigious but more lucrative appointment, managing one of the company's salt districts in the Ganges delta. 
Chapman left India in 1801 with a comfortable fortune, estimated at $70,000. He returned to Bath, where he had family connections, buying a small estate at Bathford on the outskirts of the city. He lived there with some of the children of his brother, who had died in one of the West Indian campaigns. Chapman bought himself into the House of Commons for the borough of Newtown in the Isle of Wight, which he represented from 1802 to 1805 without making any political mark. In the last years of his life he became increasingly addicted to gambling, a pastime for which he had as little aptitude as an 'untutored savage from the wilds of America' (J. Wiltshire to W. Hastings, 18 Dec 1806, BL, Add. MS 29181, fol. 354). Hastings was warned of heavy losses at Bath and of some $5000 lost in a single session in London. Chapman died at home, Bathgate House, Bathford, on 22 March 1809 of the effects of a tumour on his thigh, leaving a much diminished fortune, put at $10,000 in Britain with some property still in India.

Clive, Margaret, Lady Clive of Plassey (1735-1817), society figure, was born on 24 October 1735 at Kensington Gore in London, the fourth of the four children of Edmund Maskelyne (1698-1744), a civil servant, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Booth (died 1748). After the death of her mother Margaret lived with relatives in Wiltshire and attended the school run by Mrs Saintsbury at Cirencester in 1749. The Maskelyne family pursued a number of scholarly endeavours, and Margaret's brother Nevil Maskelyne later became astronomer royal. From an early age Margaret herself developed a close interest in astronomy, music, and poetry, and at school she became proficient in the French language. The Maskelyne family also had strong connections with the East India Company, and by the late 1740s Margaret's brother Edmund was stationed at Madras, where he became a close friend of Robert Clive (1725-1774). In 1751 Edmund encouraged Margaret to sail to India after Clive, according to legend, had become captivated by her beauty as represented in a miniature portrait. By the time Margaret arrived in India in 1752, Clive had become a military hero and, after a six-month courtship, the couple were married at Madras on 18 February 1753. A month later Margaret and her new husband sailed for Britain. 
The course of the Clives' marriage was determined by two further periods of service undertaken by Robert in India. On the first occasion, between 1755 and 1760, Robert was accompanied by Margaret, who gave him devoted and affectionate company as he established the British military and political position in Bengal. The Clives returned to Britain in 1760, fabulously wealthy and much envied. In spite of Robert's best efforts, however, the Clives were not fully accepted into polite society, which was deeply suspicious of the new wealth accumulated by company 'nabobs'. Their time together was often devoted to music and they were regular attenders at concerts and operatic events. When Robert, now Baron Clive of Plassey, was reappointed as governor of Bengal in 1764, Margaret, who was pregnant, stayed in Britain. She spent much of her time at a rented house at Westcombe, near Blackheath, Kent, where she kept a small circle of friends around her, but she also played an active role in supervising her husband's political and financial affairs. Although she lived a quiet life, devoting much attention to astronomy, music, and the learning of Italian to improve her understanding of opera, Margaret maintained a public profile when it was necessary to sustain Robert's political ambitions. She attended court in 1765, and in the same year she organized a remarkable soiree at the Clive home in Berkeley Square, where the young Mozarts, then visiting London, appeared with the popular Italian castrato Manzuoli. 
Robert Clive returned to Britain in 1767. Margaret then accompanied him to France for an eight-month visit the following year as he endeavoured to recover from a bout of depressive illness. Clive was also now beset by political problems, and over the next five years he was forced to defend his reputation and private fortune. Margaret remained in the background, content with the company of her four children and several close companions. Robert's actions in India were subjected to searching parliamentary inquiry in 1772-3, but he eventually escaped with his honour intact. He died unexpectedly in November 1774, having suffered a seizure after taking a large dose of opium to relieve acute discomfort caused by illness. Margaret recovered from the shock of this devastating tragedy and picked up the threads of a quiet, almost reclusive existence. She lived out the rest of her life at Oakly Park, one of the Clive family homes in Shropshire, where she followed her hobbies surrounded by her extensive collections of telescopes, globes, and cats. Her interest in Anglo-Indian affairs was renewed in 1797, when Edward Clive, first earl of Powis (1754-1839), the eldest of her children, was appointed governor of Madras. She died at Oakly Park on 28 December 1817.

Cowan, Sir Robert (d. 1737), administrator in India, was the son of Alderman John Cowan (died 1733) of Londonderry and his first wife, Elizabeth. John Cowan's family originated in Stirling, settling in Northern Ireland in the early seventeenth century. Robert Cowan's early activities are little known, but it is clear that he was involved in matters commercial. Some time around 1707 he set up as a merchant in Lisbon, becoming a partner in the firm Cowan and Lort, which went bankrupt because, according to Cowan, Lort made some poor decisions at a time when Cowan was visiting England. For the rest of his life Cowan tried to find a reasonable composition whereby he could repay at least some of his portion of the firm's debts. He left $10,000 in his will to be divided equally among the 'lawful creditors'. 
In 1719 Cowan secured the East India Company's permission to go to Bombay as a freemerchant. The ship, 'Cassandra', carrying him to India was taken by George Taylor's pirates off Madagascar (7 August 1720). Cowan assisted Captain James Macrae to negotiate the freedom of the survivors and to get them to Bombay in the ex-pirate vessel 'Fancy'. Macrae used his influence to gain Cowan the patronage of Charles Boone, the governor of Bombay, which saw Cowan immediately established in the Bombay community in a far more advantageous condition than he would have enjoyed as a freemerchant. 
Cowan's knowledge of the Portuguese language and culture were of immediate value to the Bombay establishment, which sent him to Goa (25 December 1720). He was charged with negotiating a new and more co-operative relationship between the Portuguese and the British settlements along the west coast of India, both in matters of trade and communications, and in combined operations against the pirate Khanoji Angria. In August 1721 Cowan and the Portuguese viceroy reached agreement on the various points at issue. As a result, Cowan was appointed to the Bombay council. 
In 1722 Cowan was sent to Surat to investigate affairs at the British factory. His role in sorting out a number of problems was commended by the company's management. However, it also laid the basis for the dislike of Cowan by the personnel who were disciplined, an antagonism which continued throughout his stay in Bombay. 
Between 7 January 1724 and 16 August 1726 Cowan was the chief of the British settlement at Mocha, on the Red Sea, where he tried to reorganize the company's coffee trade. At the same time he managed a significant expansion of trade between Mocha and the west coast of India. His efforts resulted in his promotion to second in council at Bombay (January 1726). On 14 January 1728 he was nominated as president and governor of Bombay, a position he assumed when William Phipps departed (10 January 1729). 
Cowan's government was characterized by a significant expansion and maintenance of British political influence and trade in western India and the Red Sea-Persian Gulf area. He concentrated much effort on improving the security of British activities, removing the threat of European and Indian piracy, and he consolidated the British position against other Europeans. 
In September 1734 Cowan's term as president and governor ended, and although he was willing to stay on, at least until he could realize all his current investments in the country trade, the company appointed John Horne to take over immediately. Along with the usual envy of Cowan's evident success as a merchant, and the customary factional conflicts between resident Britons and between their patrons in London, Cowan's situation was exacerbated by clear evidence that he had, on occasion, gone beyond what was acceptable practice in the distinction between employees acting on the company's behalf and trading privately. These occasions, while defensible in terms of special circumstances in any given year throughout the trading networks, gave his detractors enough substance to be credible, and he was recalled. 
In 1735 Cowan returned to England with hopes of enjoying a 'competency' thought to have been around $100,000. On 31 January 1736 he was created a knight bachelor and received his accolade at Whitehall. The following year he was elected to parliament, as a whig, for Tregony borough (9 February 1737). His success was short-lived; he died, unmarried, a few days later (21 February 1737), in London, of complications caused by quinsy. 
Robert Cowan's will, probated in Bombay (7 December 1737), left most of his estate to his younger brother William (who died in India around the end of 1736), and after him to his younger half-sister Mary (1713-1788), who also inherited her father's and her brother William's small estates. Mary Cowan married (Dublin, 30 June 1737) her cousin Alexander Stewart (1700-1781). Their son Robert Stewart (1739-1821) became the first marquess of Londonderry.

Davis, Samuel (1760-1819), East India Company servant and orientalist, was born in the West Indies, the younger son of John Davis, who held the post there of commissary-general, and his Welsh wife ('nee' Phillips). He went to England with his mother and two sisters after the death of his father. Despite the evident poverty of the family, Davis appears to have received a good education, although the details are lost. 
In 1778 he was nominated a cadet for Madras by Laurence Sulivan, a director of the East India Company, and sailed for India in the 'Earl of Oxford', arriving at Madras in 1780. In 1783 he was selected by Warren Hastings to accompany a second mission to Bhutan and Tibet as 'Draftsman and Surveyor'. The purpose of the mission, led by Hastings's kinsman Samuel Turner, was to renew British contact with the court of the Panchen Lama first established in 1774 by George Bogle. The Tibetan authorities, however, refused to allow a greater number into their territory than had accompanied the Bogle mission. Davis, whose surveying skills may have excited Tibetan suspicions, was left behind in Bhutan and returned to India alone, though not before he had made a very careful documentation in watercolour and pencil of Bhutanese architecture and topography. The qualities of visual accuracy and warm sympathy apparent in his drawings are found also in the diary he kept in Bhutan, extracts of which appeared posthumously in 'Remarks on the Religious and Social Institutions of the Bouteas, or Inhabitants of Boutan' (1830). In this he provided a useful account of 'the handsomest race I ever saw', their theocratic government, and many aspects of their Buddhist culture and society. (He was far less happy with the appearance of Bhutanese women and their customary treatment by men.) 
In August 1783 Davis was appointed to a writership in Calcutta, and this was soon followed by the post of assistant to the collector of Bhagalpur and registrar of the 'adalat' there. He was promoted first assistant in 1787 and factor in 1788, before becoming collector of Burdwan in 1793. It was at the beginning of his career at Bhagalpur that he first made the acquaintance of the brilliant scholar and lawyer, Sir William Jones, whose intimate friend and collaborator he now became. Davis was an active member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, founded by Jones, and he emerged in due course as the acknowledged expert of the period on Indian astronomy ('jyotisa'). Basing himself mainly on the modern 'Suryasiddhanta' and its commentary, he produced two papers of a superb technical quality in the society's 'Asiatick Researches': 'On the astronomical computations of the Hindus' (1790) and 'On the Indian cycle of sixty years' (1792). Among Jones's surviving letters there are more addressed to Davis than to any other individual, and it is clear that it was only in their close relationship that the main purpose of the Asiatic Society, as envisioned by Jones, in encouraging systematic, collaborative research was actually achieved. In 1792 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society at the initiative of Sir Joseph Banks. He also became friends at this time with Thomas Daniell and his nephew William, perhaps the greatest of British painters in the East in this period, whom he had earlier known in London. Much later, in 1813, William Daniell produced six aquatints based on Davis's Bhutan paintings, and a further six in 1816 based on his views of the island of St Helena. While sketching with the Daniells at the ancient city of Gaur, Davis was attacked by a bear and left lame for life. (He shot the bear as soon as he had recovered sufficiently from his wounds.) While still at Burdwan, in August 1794 Davis married Henrietta Boileau, who was from an aristocratic French family that had settled in England as refugees early in the century. They were to have four sons and seven daughters. The eldest son, Sir John Francis Davis (1795-1890), became the first governor of Hong Kong. During Davis's next posting as magistrate at Benares, 1795-1800, he had to face an insurrection by the deposed nawab of Oudh, Wazir Ali. On finding his house attacked, he placed his family on the roof and, unaided, guarded the only access to it with the aid of a pike. (His protege Mountstuart Elphinstone would visit Davis's widow every year in London on the anniversary of the insurrection to do puja to the pike.) 
The remainder of Davis's Indian career was spent in a succession of posts in Calcutta, ending as accountant-general of India in 1804. In 1806 he retired and left with his family for England. He was elected a director of the East India Company in 1810 and re-elected in 1814 and 1819. As co-author (with James Cumming) of the fifth report on East India Company affairs (1812), Davis's talents and reforming zeal were fully employed in the attempt to reconsider the foundations of the company's rule of India. He died at his home, Birdhurst Lodge, near Croydon, on 16 June 1819.

Ducarel, Gerard Gustavus (1745-1800), East India Company servant, was born on 15 April 1745 in London, the youngest of the four children of Adrian Coltee Ducarel (1718-1745), a merchant and director of the South Sea Company, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Hamilton (1719-1792). He was a nephew of the antiquarian Andrew Coltee Ducarel. The Huguenot family emigrated to England from Caen around 1715. 
In 1758 Gusty Ducarel was a midshipman in the Royal Navy and present at the siege of Louisburg. He was still in the navy in 1762 but, under Lord Clive's patronage, he obtained a writership in the East India Company, arriving in Calcutta in December 1765. Almost at once he placed himself in an invidious position by improvidently signing a memorial objecting to Clive's plan to transfer Madras officials to Bengal. Full of remorse he hurriedly withdrew his name. After brief spells as deputy paymaster to the 1st brigade, assistant cash keeper to the governor, and Persian translator to the resident at Murshidabad, he was appointed supervisor at Purnea in 1770. Purnea was a poverty-stricken district with tracts of wasteland and depressed smallholdings. Ducarel disapproved of the official policy of short-term revenue farming, but his measures to revive the local economy were vitiated by famine and the obtuseness of the superior revenue authorities. Although he left Purnea in 1772, his service there earned him recognition as an able and imaginative fiscal administrator. Several short appointments followed until he became fourth member of the Calcutta committee of revenue in 1775. 
In October 1774 Philip Francis alighted in Calcutta as a member of the newly established Bengal supreme council. Like Ducarel he was attached to the Clive interest, and Ducarel soon became his adviser on the revenue and a personal friend. Ducarel declined an important part in Warren Hastings's survey of the revenue system (the 'amini' commission) inaugurated in 1776. His appointment as superintendent of the 'khalsa' (treasury) in July 1778 was managed by Francis. Beyond the call of official duty, Ducarel assisted in the escapade at the house of G. F. Grand on 8 December 1778 which culminated in Francis's appearance in court as defendant in an action for criminal conversation during which Ducarel was called as a witness. In December 1779 he was an intermediary in the opening of negotiations to try to arrange an accommodation between Francis and Hastings. 
When Francis left India in December 1780 his associates were left without a patron and protector. Although Hastings listed Ducarel among 'the lees of Mr. Francis' (Gleig, 2.384-6), he conceded an obligation to indemnify him for loss of office when a centralized revenue committee formed in Calcutta in 1781 absorbed the functions of the 'khalsa'. Thus, in 1782, Ducarel was appointed commissioner at Burdwan, where he remained until he retired and returned to England in 1784. 
Ducarel began a relationship with Elizabeth (Bibi) Mirza ('c'.1758-1822) in the early 1770s. They had six children: five were born in India and one in England. She accompanied Ducarel back to his retirement home in Exmouth, Devon. Presumably at some stage she converted from Islam to Christianity, and they probably married, most likely in India between 1780 and 1784 (they had not married by 22 April 1780, when the youngest of three recorded natural children was born). An Indian traveller, Abu Taleb, wrote of visiting Ducarel's house, seemingly in London, about 1799 or 1800. He saw portraits of Indian acquaintances and described Mrs Ducarel as 'very fair and so accomplished in all the English manners and language, that I was sometime in her company before I could be convinced she was a native of India' (Abu Taleb Khan, 1.198-9). Philip Francis facetiously alluded to Ducarel's diminutive stature (he was 5 feet 1/2 inch tall) in a letter to his wife written from Paris, where Ducarel and he were on a visit in September 1784 (Parkes and Merivale, 2.219). Although a good deal occupied with family affairs in retirement, two letters from Francis in 1795 suggest that Ducarel was anxious about the effects of the continuance of the war with France. Ducarel died at Stilton, Huntingdonshire, on 14 December 1800 while travelling. He was an efficient and principled administrator, respected though regarded warily by Hastings for his closeness to Francis.

Grant, James (1750-1808), East India Company servant and author, was born on 30 May 1750 at Shewglie, Glen Urquhart, Inverness-shire, the son of the laird of Shewglie. In 1768 he gained, via his uncle Alexander Grant, an appointment in Bengal with the East India Company. He arrived the following year, but, because he did not get a regular position, his early years are difficult to trace in the company's records, which seem at times to confuse him with another James Grant then in Bengal. According to his own account, although not officially employed, he became involved in the Dacca district with collecting the revenue during the great famine that devastated Bengal in 1770. He returned to Great Britain in 1774, but went back to India, where he had a number of relatives; one of these, Charles Grant, later became a dominant figure in the East India Company in London. He was sent to Masulipatam, in the territory known as the Northern Circars, which had been ceded to the company by the nizam of Hyderabad. 
In 1781 Grant was appointed assistant to the company's resident at the nizam's court in Hyderabad, a position that required, according to Grant, getting the nizam to pay the company money that he had promised and convincing him that the British had no sinister designs on his territory (BL OIOC, Home miscellaneous series, 219.5). In the following year he became the resident, but remained in Masulipatam until his appointment ended in 1784, claiming ill health as an excuse for not going to Hyderabad. He spent his time in gathering information on the revenue system of the Northern Circars and of the neighbouring rulers, arguing that, while he had not been asked to do this, it was essential for the company to know the true value of its possessions. He had gained, he said, 'priceless knowledge of political arithmetic' that would become the foundation of a kind of empire that was 'perfectly new in the political history of the world' (Firminger, 2.164, 3.3). He continued his researches on the much larger and more important area of Bengal. These were first sent to the governor-general as a memorandum, part of which was later published in England as 'An Inquiry into the Nature of the Zamindery Tenures in the Landed Property of Bengal' (1791). 
The great question that the British had to answer as they took over rule in Bengal and elsewhere in India was, Grant said, 'Who owns the land?' He argued that in India, throughout recorded history, the sovereign was the sole and universal proprietor of the land. Private ownership of land in the European sense was unknown, and the peasants who worked the land paid, either directly to the sovereign or through intermediary officials known as 'zamindars', a part of the produce as rent for usage. As the central authority declined, these officials claimed to be the actual owners of the land, but were in fact, he insisted, only tax-collectors. His arguments had immediate practical significance, because, if true, the East India Company, which had replaced the Mughal emperor as sovereign, owned the land. Furthermore, he showed through a minute examination of land records that the Bengal territories were capable of providing far more revenue, as they had been under-assessed since the British took over, and, moreover, the 'zamindars' were 'ignorant, merciless despots', who had stolen vast sums that should have gone to the company. 
Grant's work was central to the ongoing debate over how Bengal should be governed, what the revenue assessment should be, and how the revenue should be collected. This involved him with the leading figures in the company's administration, including Warren Hastings and Philip Francis. His views were strenuously opposed by John Shore, adviser to the governor-general, Lord Cornwallis, who argued that while Grant had done an astonishing amount of work, it was based on a misreading of the record. In practical terms, what mattered was that the company had neither the personnel nor the knowledge to do without the 'zamindars'. Shore therefore insisted that a revenue settlement should be made with them as 'de facto' owners of the land. Grant's knowledge of the details of revenue collection was recognized by his appointment in 1785 to the office of 'sheristadar', or keeper of accounts, to prevent fraud on the part of the local accountants. There is not much evidence that he had the administrative skills or the power, despite his vast knowledge, to bring about any real changes. Nevertheless, as a critic of his work has put it, students of the history of Bengal and Bihar must turn to his researches when they undertake 'to recover the past history of any given district within these provinces' (Firminger, 2.xviii). In addition to his study of 'zamindar' tenures Grant also published 'A Political Survey of Northern Circars' (1784) and historical and comparative analyses of the finances and revenues of Bengal (1786 and 1788). 
When under John Shore's influence the office of 'sheristadar' was abolished in 1789, Grant was offered a post as collector, or chief official of a revenue district. This, however, he refused and returned to Scotland. He purchased the Redcastle estate in Ross-shire, styling himself 'Grant of Redcastle'. He proposed marriage to Maria Grant, the daughter of his cousin Charles Grant, who had also returned from Bengal a wealthy man, but she refused him, perhaps because she was thirty years younger, but also because James did not share the intense evangelical religious views of her father. Charles Grant had once commented, after James had visited him in Bengal, that, while his knowledge of Indian revenue systems 'must set him before all that have yet treated of them', he was 'filled with this world and regardless of another' (Morris, 83). Maria remained on good terms with him, however, and she was with him when he died, unmarried, on 22 October 1808, at Ruxley Lodge, near Esher in Surrey. His cousin Colonel Alexander Grant inherited Redcastle, but he left legacies to Maria and her sisters.

Gregory, Robert (1729?-1810), director of the East India Company and politician, was born in co. Galway, Ireland. Little is known of his background other than that he was the son of Henry Gregory of Galway and his wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Shaw of Newford, also in Galway. His family, who had been established in Ireland under Cromwell, had sufficient influence to obtain for him a licence from the East India Company to trade as an independent, or 'free', merchant in India, and he arrived in Bengal about 1747. After a long and successful career in India he was described by Robert Clive, then governor of Bengal, as a 'great Merchant having acquired a Fortune of one hundred thousand Pounds sterling in Trade in the most Honourable Manner, his Integrity & Abilities are unquestionable & his Character a very respectable one' (Clive to J. Walsh, 5 Feb 1766, BL OIOC, MS Eur D546/1, fol. 131). 
Gregory returned from India in 1766. He acquired Coole Park in his native Galway and Valence in Kent, and it was at the latter that he settled. Seeking election to parliament, he approached Lord Rockingham, leader of the main opposition party. He made a good impression on Rockingham who described him as a 'gentleman of good fortune... and whose character and abilities I think well of' (Rockingham to Newcastle, 4 March 1768, BL, Add. MS 32989, fols. 29-30). Gregory sought Rockingham's help in finding a seat but was concerned that 'where he stood it might be with the countenance of the neighbouring gentlemen and some old and known interest, as thinking that ground was better and freer from the accusation of coming as an adventurer' (ibid.). With Rockingham's help he stood for Maidstone on the interest of Lord Aylesford and was elected comfortably. In parliament Gregory voted consistently with the opposition, but built a reputation for independence of party in Indian matters. During debates in 1773 on Lord North's bill to regulate the company's Indian administration, he declared that: 'most of the gentlemen now in India are my particular friends, but I am willing to do all I can for the ease of the inhabitants of India. A place without law can never be happy. I prefer the happiness of seventeen million of souls to the emoluments of my friends. (HoP, 'Commons, 1754-90')' Gregory was elected to the company's court of directors in 1769 and here too he professed to put the interest of the company before his own. He became closely involved in the company's campaign to defeat North's 'East India Regulating Bill' and continued to act in this with Lord Rockingham who retained the 'Highest opinion' of his integrity and knowledge in Indian matters (Rockingham to Edmund Burke, 'post' 13 Dec 1773, quoted in Sutherland, 2.497). But Gregory did have more personal interests in Indian affairs, particularly through longstanding business connections with Maharaja Nandakumar. Nandakumar had once enjoyed power and influence at the court of the nawab of Bengal, a puppet of the company by the 1760s, but had been removed during the governorship of Robert Clive. Gregory had taken Nandakumar's case to Clive, and later, when a company director, acted as his London agent (Khan, 290, 300-01; 'Letters of Richard Barwell', 107). When Laurence Sulivan, Clive's powerful rival for control of the company, was re-elected to the court of directors in 1771, Gregory supported him in ordering the dismissal of Clive's allies in the company's Bengal administration who stood in the way of Nandakumar's return to power. There seems little doubt that Nandakumar's involvement in the political intrigues in Bengal against the governor-general, Warren Hastings, in the 1770s influenced Gregory's own views of Hastings's governorship. Hastings was told by a friend, Francis Sykes: 'I dined yesterday with Gregory... and others and find that Nundcomar writes them everything wch happens and something more, by every ship. This is a fact for I found they had everything from him' (Khan, 300-01). Nandakumar was brought to trial in Bengal for his intrigues, and executed, and Gregory joined the growing party at East India House calling for Hastings's recall. 
Gregory lost his parliamentary seat in the 1774 election but was returned after a contest at Rochester. He opposed the American war and voted against the North government on all but Indian issues, where he committed himself to vote with the government in any legislation that represented the mutual interests of the public and the company. When Edmund Burke pledged himself, Gregory, and the opposition to support the government in any such measure, Gregory refused to be bound by such a pledge, saying that he 'stood connected with no party, nor with the honourable Member... he would give his opinion freely, and his support where he thought it due... being as independent in his principles and his seat as any man in the House' (HoP, 'Commons, 1754-90'). 
Following a ballot in the House of Commons for membership of a committee of inquiry into the war in the Indian Carnatic, Gregory's reputation and stature ensured that he came top of the poll, receiving support from both sides of the house. In the following year he was elected chairman of the East India Company. Although professedly more sympathetic now to Hastings's governorship after the committee of inquiry's findings, Gregory found it difficult to take the company's line in defence of Warren Hastings when the Pitt government tried to have him removed. He was described to Hastings by a friend as 'your shifting friend (the backward way)... upon the whole against You, altho pretends a great deal of candour' (J. Woodman to Hastings, 24 June 1782, BL, Add. MS 29154, fol. 479). 
In 1782 Gregory had a serious illness and resigned his chairmanship of the company. Such was his reputation that he was still named as one of the commissioners for Indian affairs in Fox's 'East India Bill' in 1783. His last parliamentary speech was in support of the bill later that year. He did not stand in the 1784 general election. With his wife, Maria, 'nee' Nimmo, the daughter of an East India merchant, Gregory had a daughter and three sons, the youngest of whom, William Gregory (1762-1840), was under-secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland. Three children of Robert Gregory were baptized at Calcutta on 3 February 1766; their mother's name is given as Johanna in the official records, possibly a clerical error. Gregory died in Berners Street, London, on 1 September 1810, aged eighty-one.

Lovell, James (d. 1778), sculptor and interior decorator, was active from the mid-1740s. Nothing is known of his birth, parentage, or childhood. His work shows stylistic affinities with that of Peter Scheemakers -- who like Lovell worked at Stowe in Buckinghamshire -- and it seems likely that he trained in the studio of Scheemakers and Laurent Delvaux. Although the account books at Stowe refer to two sons, John and James Lovell, nothing is known either of Lovell's marriage. He apparently went bankrupt in 1768. Given the slight biographical knowledge of Lovell, an account of his life therefore must focus almost entirely on the evidence of his works. 
Lovell worked mainly on houses and estates in Warwickshire: Radway Grange and the neighbouring Hagley Hall, Arbury Hall, Warwick Shire Hall, and Newnham Paddox. Many sources suggest that -- despite his large practice in this county -- he lived in London for most of his life. In 1756 Bishop Richard Pococke noted in the garden at Radway Grange a statue of Caractacus in chains, 'modeled... by a countryman of genius now established in London' (L. Dickens and M. Stanton, eds., 'An Eighteenth-Century Correspondence', 1910, 270); Horace Walpole supplies a more precise address when he refers to him as a 'statuary in Mortimer Street, near Oxford Road' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 35.644). An account presented by Lovell to Lord Temple's steward in 1775 provides a different, later address, revealing that the sculptor had rented a house in Wall Street, London, for the previous three years from his patron; this rental is again mentioned in a final settlement of his account for work at Stowe, dated 10 October 1777, and it may be presumed to be the place of his death the following year. 
Lovell's works may be divided into three categories: plasterwork and fittings for interiors of the early Gothic revival; funerary monuments for church interiors; and neo-classical monumental statuary in relief and in the round, mostly to be found at Stowe. He was a stylistic chameleon throughout his career, and early neo-Gothic and rococo elements persist until the final decade, when he executed the architectural and figurative sculpture of the south front of Stowe in the most advanced neo-classical taste. Stylistic variations may be attributed to the tastes of his patrons rather than to personal convictions. First and chief among these seems to have been Sanderson Miller of Radway: at the centre of the early Gothic revival, he was designer of plasterwork at his own Radway Grange, at Sir Roger Newdigate's Arbury Hall, at Lord Dacre's Belhus in Essex, and at Lord North's Wroxton Abbey in Oxfordshire, as well as at the house and church at Hagley in Worcestershire belonging to Lord Lyttleton. Through Lord Lyttleton, Miller was also involved in continuing restorations to the house and garden buildings at Stowe in Buckinghamshire. James Lovell was employed at all of these estates. 
Lovell's principal funerary monuments are to Earl Fitzwalter in Chelmsford Cathedral and to the Montagu family at Horton church, Northamptonshire (both 1756). Horace Walpole admired the latter particularly, writing to Richard Montagu that 'There is a helmet that would tempt one to enlist' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 9.200). It was probably therefore through Walpole's intervention that Lovell sculpted the monument to Galfridus Mann in the church at Linton in Kent (1756), to the designs of Richard Bentley. Although a small monument, it was important as one of the earliest funerary monuments in the early Gothic revival style. Also in Kent is Lovell's monument to General Wolfe in his birthplace, Westerham (1760). Finally, there is the monument to Thomas Trotman in the church at Bucknell, Oxfordshire (1777). 
Such occasional commissions for fireplaces, plasterwork, and funerary monuments would have made James Lovell an exemplary jobbing sculptor and stuccoist of the period but nothing more. What distinguishes him is the ensemble of relief and free-standing sculpture of the south front of Stowe, monumental in scale and marking a new departure in style. Executed in the final decade of his life, it was the culmination of a series of involvements by Lovell in the interior of the house and in the ornamentation of the garden buildings. The most conspicuous of these was the architectural ornament of the Corinthian arch framing the new south front and designed -- as the south front was -- by Lord Temple's nephew, Thomas Pitt, later Lord Camelford. The architectural ornamentation and the sculpture and stucco-work of the south front of Stowe made pioneering use of newly published sources: Robert Wood's 'The Ruins of Palmyra' (1753) and 'The Ruins of Baalbek' (1757), and the first volume of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's 'The Antiquities of Athens' (1762). This is the earliest and most comprehensive programme of sculpture of the age of neo-classicism. 
There is clearly no argument to be made for originality in design on behalf of James Lovell: he was a master craftsman and not an artist. His most impressive early sculpture was the chimney-piece in the saloon of Hagley Hall in Worcestershire for Lord Lyttleton in 1759, and it is decidedly rococo in style. But his major work is the most public manifestation of the transition from the rococo to the neo-classical style in sculpture, and his own career marks the end of the predominance of foreign sculptors in England and the coming-of-age of native sculptors.

Hastings, Marian (1747-1837), wife of Warren Hastings, was, on the evidence of the act granting her British nationality in 1796, born in Nuremberg. No date is stated, but a secondary source indicates 2 February 1747. Her grandfather was Charles Chapuset de St Valentin, protestant officer in the household troops of the king of France, who was obliged to go into exile following the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. He went to Berlin as a teacher of languages and of dancing but finally settled at Altdorf, near Nuremberg, where, as a widower, he married Katharina Maria Muller, a clergyman's daughter, in 1693. They had two sons. Another son was born from a third marriage. This last son, Johann Jakob, married Caroline Friederike Grundgeiger or Krongeiger ('b'. 1720) at Karlsruhe. He is said to have died in 1758, leaving a widow and two children, Anna Maria Apollonia, the future Mrs Hastings, and Johann Paul Thomas ('b'. 1749). 
Nothing is known of Anna Maria Chapuset's childhood and adolescence, and the place and date of her marriage to Baron Christoph Carl Adam von Imhoff ('c'.1734- 'c'.1802) are uncertain. Nuremberg, Stuttgart, and Strelitz have all been advanced as hypothetical venues and the years from 1765 to 1768 as likely dates. Imhoff was an officer in the Wurttemberg army left unemployed by the end of the Seven Years' War. Some sources maintain that he met his future wife in Nuremberg; others argue for Strelitz, where she was said to be a maid of honour at the court of the duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Imhoffs and their two sons, Charles and Julius, moved to England in 1768 through the good offices of Elizabeth Schwellenberg, Queen Charlotte's mistress of the robes. Imhoff soon obtained a cadetship in the East India Company's Madras army but, as an accomplished miniature portraitist, he no doubt also saw a market for his artistic skills in India. Early in 1769, accompanied by his wife and elder child, he embarked for Madras in the 'Duke of Grafton'. Among the passengers was Warren Hastings (1732-1818), then a widower of thirty-seven, returning to India. The baroness took Hastings under her care when he fell ill and a shipboard romance blossomed. Imhoff lived in Madras with his wife until the latter part of 1770, when, having resigned his army commission, he moved to Calcutta in search of a wider clientele for his portraits. His wife remained in Madras, for part of the time at least, a resident in Hastings's house. She joined her husband in Calcutta in October 1771. Hastings followed in February 1772 on taking up his new appointment as governor of Bengal. In a company general letter to Madras dated 25 March 1772 Imhoff was ordered to return to Europe for declining military service. He arrived back in September 1773 and, presumably, started divorce proceedings. 
Many questions remain unanswered regarding the course of events that led up to the marriage of Warren Hastings and the former Baroness von Imhoff in Calcutta on 8 August 1777. It is supposed that she lived in Hastings's house at Alipore or one nearby. Suggestions by Macaulay and Wraxall that Hastings simply paid Imhoff a large sum of money to divorce his wife oversimplify more sophisticated transactions. Hastings undertook to adopt the Imhoffs' two boys and almost certainly made funds available for legal and other expenses which probably erred on the side of generosity. However Hastings and the baroness may have lived before their marriage, discretion prevailed. Philip Francis, Hastings's severest political foe, mocked the liaison but never seriously traduced it. In fact he wrote of Marian Hastings as 'accomplished' and deserving of 'every mark of respect' (Parkes and Merivale, 2.96). Relations between Imhoff, his former wife, and Hastings remained amicable during and after the divorce proceedings. 
A decree of divorce, dated Weimar, 1 June 1776, was granted by the duke of Saxony on Imhoff's petition that he considered himself 'an abandoned conjugal mate' (BL, Add. MS 39903, fol. 65). It did not reach Calcutta until July 1777, where its validity was confirmed by an English missionary. The baroness reverted to her maiden name, and a marriage licence was issued on 5 August 1777 in which she was described as a 'singlewoman' (BL, Add. MS 39904A). The wedding took place three days later. The marriage brought enduring happiness to both parties, but also regrets that there were no children. Marian Hastings, as she became known, sailed to England for her health in 1784. Hastings left India in 1785, and they eventually settled at Daylesford in Worcestershire, where Hastings built a new house on his ancestral estate. Marian continued to live there after her husband's death in 1818. 
Hastings took his wife into his confidence over political affairs, but Wraxall exaggerated when he wrote that Marian 'invariably maintained her ascendancy over his [Hastings's] mind as well as his affections' ('Historical and Posthumous Memoirs', 4.17-18). Certainly Hastings indulged her and she had influence, but ultimately he kept his mind his own. In their personal financial affairs Marian's prudence contrasted with Hastings's extravagance. In a statement to the East India Company in 1795 Hastings declared his wife's fortune to be $40,000, her marriage settlement accounting for the greater part of the total. However, it has since been estimated that 'at the time she actually possessed at least $107,725' (Marshall, 252). Marian's financial affairs in India remain an enigma and she appears to have concealed her wealth from her husband. She palpably suffered a substantial loss in 1797 when one of her bankers stopped payments. 
Marian's jewel-bedecked figure dazzled society in London and Calcutta. It was a gift to caricaturists and satirists, and a general source of amusement or concern. 'Our weather remains unparagoned', wrote Horace Walpole. 'Mrs. Hastings is not more brilliant' (Walpole to Mary Berry, 7 Nov 1793, Walpole, 'Corr.', 12.55). Fanny Burney complained that she made everyone else look underdressed and thought that 'a modest & quiet appearance & demeanour' would be more becoming during Hastings's trial ('The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Madame D'Arblay)', ed. J. Hemlow, 1, 1972, 25 May 1792, 165-6). In spite of this, Burney thought well of Marian Hastings. She was indeed an agreeable and handsome woman with especially beautiful hair, which she wore loose and unpowdered. Her imperfect command of English, in speech and in writing, perhaps added to her distinctly exotic air. She died at Daylesford House on 29 March 1837 and was buried in the churchyard close to her husband on 7 April 1837.

Johnson, Frances (1728-1812), hostess, was celebrated not only for her remarkable longevity in India, where few Britons outlived two monsoon seasons, but also for her four marriages and her influential circle of friends. She was born on 10 April 1728 at Fort St David, on the Coromandel coast. Her father was an East India Company official, Edward Croke (1690-1769), and her mother, Isabella Beizor (died 1780), of Portuguese descent. Frances was sent to Calcutta in 1743 to marry Perry Purpell Templer, merchant, with whom she had two children, both of whom died in infancy. Templer died on 25 January 1748 and that November she married another merchant, James Altham, who died ten days later of smallpox. Her third marriage, in 1749, to William Watts, company agent at Cossimbazar, was the most long-lasting and successful. 
Eighteenth-century India saw a power struggle between France and Britain for mastery, especially in the Carnatic and Bengal, led by heroic figures like General J.-F. Dupleix and Robert Clive. In 1756 Cossimbazar was besieged by Siraj ud-daula, nawab of Bengal, who was misinformed about the reputed wealth of its British inhabitants. The Watts now had three children and Frances was pregnant with the fourth. William Watts surrendered the fort without resistance, but Frances was allowed to remain there unharmed, until ordered to neighbouring Murshidabad. A former acquaintanceship with the nawab's mother, Amina Begam, meant Frances and her children were protected there until they could be safely (and fortunately) moved to Chandernagore, thereby escaping the sack of Calcutta in June of that year. (In later life it was Frances Johnson's constant affectionate references to Amina Begam that led to her being styled Begam Johnson herself, by her friends, though she is more commonly known to later generations as Begum Johnson.) After Calcutta's recapture by Clive, Frances rejoined her husband there, and William was sent to negotiate with the nawab, who was defeated at the battle of Plassey in 1757. Two years later William, now a rich man, took his wife and children to England, but Frances could not settle in this cold, foreign country. William died in 1764, the children grew up, and she returned to Calcutta in 1769, buying a house at 10 Clive Street, where she lived for the rest of her life, mixing in the highest circles of company officials. 
In 1774, aged forty-six, Frances made a fourth, unfortunate, marriage, this time to the Revd William Johnson ('b'. 'c'.1744), chaplain of St John's Church, Calcutta, nicknamed the Revd Tally-Ho, and sixteen years her junior. He treated her unkindly, and she eventually paid him to leave India in 1788, to the relief of her many friends. She blossomed into a society hostess, and Warren and Marian Hastings, Lord Cornwallis, Arthur Wellesley (later the duke of Wellington), and his brother Richard, Lord Mornington, all visited her at Clive Street. The remarkable absence of elderly Britons in India (for many died young and others returned home after service) meant she became a unique institution, especially as she kept up the old habits of dining at four in the afternoon and entertaining until the early hours. She kept nine slave girls, not unusual at the time, when Africans were imported and Bengali children captured or sold by their parents. Four of her five grandsons came to serve in India, including Mordaunt Ricketts, later the resident at Lucknow. Another grandson, Lord Liverpool, later British prime minister, sent her boxes of millinery every year. Her portrait, by Thomas Hickey, shows an elderly, though still handsome, woman, draped in lace ruffles, ribbons, and bows. 
Begum Johnson died at her home on 3 February 1812 after a series of 'spasms' (probably strokes) and abscesses, aged eighty-three. She was buried two days later in St John's churchyard, at a spot she had chosen, next to the tomb of Job Charnock, the founder of Calcutta; her funeral was attended by the governor-general, the chief justice, and other notables. Her elaborate tomb bears a long, somewhat inaccurate inscription, taken verbatim when her memory had begun to fail.

Johnson, Richard (1753-1807), East India Company servant and collector of oriental art and manuscripts, was born on 16 November 1753, the third son of Alexander Johnson MD (bap. 1716, d. 1799), lawyer, and of his wife, Mary Pellins ('b'. 1720, died in or after 1800). Johnson's family had lived for at least two generations in the Netherlands and he was born and brought up at The Hague. His father held the office of agent for the estates of East Friesland and the town of Emden. 
Appointed a writer on the Bengal establishment of the East India Company's service on 5 October 1769, he arrived at Calcutta on 25 September 1770. His letters home suggest that he felt himself under a strong compulsion to advance his career in India as rapidly as possible in order to make money to pay off family debts. His early service was spent in the company's central administration at Calcutta, where he was able to impress his superiors by his intelligence and capacity for business. Through his appointment in the personal office of the governor, he began a sometimes uneasy relationship with Warren Hastings. It was rumoured that he had been instrumental in negotiating the divorce that left Hastings free to marry his second wife. In addition to his official duties, Johnson ran a private agency business in partnership with Richard Croftes, his superior in the company's accountant-general's office. The firm managed the affairs of clients and specialized in arranging remittances to Britain. Johnson also looked after his younger brother Alexander, who had joined him in India, obtaining a valuable contract for him. 
Johnson manoeuvred with some dexterity, even deviousness, among the bitter rivalries on the company's Bengal council. He cultivated Hastings's opponent General John Clavering and later the new commander-in-chief Sir Eyre Coote, through whom, it would seem, he obtained in 1780 the extremely lucrative appointment of deputy to the company's resident at the court of the wazir of Oudh at Lucknow. Johnson certainly took the opportunity of making money at Lucknow with both hands, but he took other opportunities as well. He was a fine linguist, reputed to have a good knowledge of Persian and Arabic as well as of Urdu, and he clearly found the culture of the court at Lucknow much to his liking. Since the downfall of the Mughal emperors at Delhi, Lucknow had become the major centre of artistic patronage in north India. Johnson himself became the patron of poets, he had a taste for Indian music, and he acquired both a large number of Sanskrit and Persian manuscripts and a most important collection of miniatures. An Indian artist's portrayal of Johnson shows him as a short, sharp-featured man. 
The company residents at Lucknow were required to implement Warren Hastings's policies of extracting resources from the wazir to settle his debts to the company. This involved them in highly contentious measures such as the attempted confiscation of some of the assets of the wazir's mother and grandmother, the begums of Oudh. Johnson was notably ruthless in pursuing such measures, later attracting the unfavourable notice of Edmund Burke, who called him 'the outrageous Mr Johnson' ('Correspondence', 8.202). Although Johnson confidently expected to succeed to the post of resident, he had, however, lost the governor's confidence and in 1782 he was recalled, ostensibly for preventing the transfer from Oudh of a sum of money promised personally to Hastings by the wazir. 
Johnson's fortune evidently suffered severely from his recall. He told his mother that although he was commonly thought to be worth $150,000, he had 'dissipated in folly the best part of what fortune threw within my reach' and in a series of penitential letters blamed himself for 'avarice, ambition and licentiousness' as well as 'vanity and self-conceit' (letters of 16 Nov 1783 and 30 Aug 1784, JRL, Eng. MS 191, nos. 27 and 34). His problems were exacerbated by the failure of the business of Croftes and Johnson, which was dissolved in 1785, leaving Johnson with heavy obligations when Croftes died insolvent in the following year. 
Johnson was, however, able to restore his reputation if not his fortune. With assurances of goodwill from Hastings, he was appointed to the prestigious but not very lucrative residency with the nizam of Hyderabad in 1784. There at least he could add Deccani paintings to his collection. Recalled from Hyderabad in 1785, he again served in the company's revenue administration at Calcutta and launched proposals for a public bank. He was highly regarded by discriminating men. William Jones learned 'Indian Mythology' from him (Cannon, 316) and called him 'one of the most distinguished of the Company's servants' (Jones, 2.854). Lord Cornwallis's government commended him as a 'very able, Zealous and deserving Servant of the Company' ('Fort William-India House Correspondence', 322). 
In 1788 Johnson sent ahead of him to Britain part of what he called his 'live lumber', two girls, presumably the daughters of an Indian mother, whom he wished to be educated with the 'moderate expectations' that would fit them for 'decent husbands'. A boy and a girl were to follow and there were two little girls still too young to travel (letter to his mother, 9 Nov 1788, JRL, Eng. MS 191, no. 43). Forced to leave India by illness, Johnson himself took his passage in February 1790. 
Johnson settled in London. He married Sophia, daughter of John Courtenay MP, on 1 March 1792. They had four daughters and a son. To supplement his limited resources, Johnson hoped for a new career in public life, entering parliament in 1791 as member for Milborne Port; he retained his seat until 1794. In 1792, however, he turned again to banking with various partners, including Nathaniel Middleton, the resident to whom he had acted as deputy at Lucknow. Warren Hastings and his wife were among the clients of the business situated at Stratford Place, off Oxford Street. Johnson was 'the president and acting manager' until 1803, when he was deposed (note, JRL, Eng. MS 179a, fol. 46). By that time he was in serious financial difficulties. He had to leave his house, sell his collection of books and paintings, and prepare to go back to India. He died insolvent at Brighton on 19 August 1807.

Johnstone, John (1734-1795), East India Company servant, was born at Haddock's Hole, Edinburgh, on 28 April 1734, the fifth son of Sir James Johnstone, third baronet (1697-1772), of Westerhall, Dumfriesshire, and his wife, Barbara (died 1773), daughter of Alexander Murray, fourth Lord Elibank. Johnstone received tuition in Edinburgh before being appointed a writer in the service of the East India Company in December 1750. He arrived in Bengal on 9 July 1751, and in 1754 was stationed as an assistant at the company's factory at Dacca, where he was taken prisoner in 1756 subsequent to the outbreak of hostilities between the nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daula, and the company. Following his release Johnstone, whose brother Patrick died in the Black Hole, volunteered to assist in the recovery of Calcutta and served with the artillery at the battle of Plassey in June 1757. He was a member of the detachment sent by Robert Clive in pursuit of Jean Law, and following a brief return to civil employment participated in the expedition against the French in the Northern Circars which culminated in the capture of Masulipatam in April 1759. 
On his return to Bengal, Johnstone was again stationed at Dacca but shortly afterwards was appointed to take charge, apparently on account of his linguistic abilities, of the company's affairs at Midnapore, a district newly ceded to the company. He was also now a member of the Bengal council. Johnstone was faced with collecting revenues in a hostile environment, but was successful, and in 1762 was transferred to Burdwan, another recently ceded district. These appointments gave Johnstone opportunities for participating in private trading ventures, particularly in salt, and he formed a partnership with two other company servants, William Hay and William Bolts. The partnership also became involved in revenue farming. These activities attracted accusations of malpractice and fraud, and Johnstone came into conflict with the governor of Bengal, Henry Vansittart, a trading rival who attempted to reach an agreement concerning private trade with the nawab Mir Kasim. It is likely that Johnstone received other financial gains in the form of presents from the raja of Burdwan. When news of his disagreement with Vansittart reached England in early 1764, Johnstone was dismissed from the company's service. In May he was, however, reinstated, a measure that was not supported by the followers of Clive, despite the encouragement that they had received from the Johnstone party in the company election a few weeks previously. The resulting breach between the Clive and Johnstone groups was the start of a feud that lasted for the rest of the decade and beyond. 
Upon the arrival in Bengal of the orders which reinstated him Johnstone returned to Burdwan. In February 1765 Mir Jafar, who had replaced Mir Kasim as nawab in 1763, died, and was succeeded by his adolescent son Najm ud-Daula, whom the council, now headed by John Spencer, supported. Johnstone was recalled from Burdwan and led a delegation of the council to Murshidabad for the installation of the new nawab. Following this presents were distributed; Johnstone received approximately $36,000, the largest amount given to any of the individuals involved. His brother Gideon was in receipt of a smaller sum. Clive's arrival in Calcutta in May 1765 to take up the governorship of Bengal heralded the beginning of a programme of reform. Johnstone soon clashed with Clive, who began an inquiry into the presents which had been received by him and his colleagues despite their having received orders from the directors of the company to abstain from such activities. On 17 June 1765 a minute from Johnstone was considered by the council; this criticized Clive's style of government and stated his intention to resign from the service. 
Johnstone left India with a fortune that has been put at $300,000. This was employed in the purchase of estates in Scotland, at Alva in Stirlingshire, and later in Selkirkshire and Dumfriesshire. Faced with prosecution by the East India Company, he published in 1766 'A Letter to the Proprietors of East India Stock', which defended his activities in Bengal. The Johnstone group, who were allied to Clive's enemy Laurence Sulivan, were able to obtain the withdrawal of the prosecution in May 1767. In the years that followed, Johnstone's interests were taken up by his brother George Johnstone, who was elected an MP in 1768. As the clamour for an investigation into the company's affairs in India grew, George Johnstone attempted to discredit Clive and was a member, along with his brother William Pulteney, of the parliamentary select committee of inquiry into the company which was appointed in 1772. 
John Johnstone was elected MP for Dysart burghs in 1774 and supported the opposition to the North administration. In 1780 he lost his seat, and an attempt to be elected for Dumfriesshire in 1790 was unsuccessful. His wife, Elizabeth ('nee' Keene), whom he had married on 1 September 1765 and with whom he had a son and a daughter, predeceased him. Johnstone died at Alva House, Alva, on 10 December 1795.

Burney, Frances (1776-1828), governess and poet, was born in London in January 1776, the fourth child and second daughter of cousins Esther (Hetty) Burney (1749-1832) and Charles Rousseau Burney (1747-1819), and niece of the novelist and diarist Frances Burney, Madame D'Arblay. Her parents were both talented musicians: Esther had been a child prodigy and had made her musical debut playing the harpsichord before a select audience at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, in 1760, while Charles Rousseau was an acknowledged virtuoso of both the harpsichord and the violin. Despite their talent, the couple -- and their eight children -- were dogged by poverty, and in 1794 Frances was obliged to take up her first post as governess in the household of Lord Beverley. Thereafter family connections helped her to secure positions in a number of eminent households, her employers including the attorney-general Sir Thomas Plumer (1753-1824) and Sir Henry Russell (1751-1836), chief justice at Bengal. 
In spite of the gruelling nature of her work and chronic ill health, Burney pursued her education and gradually acquired a library that included books in French, German, Latin, Greek, and Italian. In 1818 she published 'Tragic dramas; chiefly intended for representation in private families: to which is added, Aristodemus, a tragedy, from the Italian of Vincenzo Monti'. The tragedies themselves, 'Fitzormond, or, Cherished Resentment' and 'Malek Adhel, the Champion of the Crescent', are overblown and melodramatic, and the style and tone can be gleaned from a short quotation from 'Fitzormond': '
Lady Fitzormond: 'My taper's spent, yet I am loth to quit 

The deep'ning gloom of this sequester'd scene' 

' It is telling that the very title of these plays assures readers that they are meant for private performances only -- Frances had clearly been affected by the concerns of her grandfather Charles Burney (1726-1814) about the potential impropriety of the stage, particularly for female dramatists. Burney's preface to 'Tragic Dramas' similarly recalls her aunt's preface to 'Evelina' (1776) in expressing feminine diffidence at publishing: 'Various motives... having combined to induce the Writer of the following pages to bring them before the public, she is desirous, by stating a few of them, to obviate as much as possible, the imputation of temerity to which the publication of them may subject her. (p. 1)' Burney suffered attacks of jaundice throughout her life, and on Friday, 28 March 1828, 'wasted to a skeleton' ('Journals and Letters', 11.712), she succumbed to the disease at her mother's home in King Street, Bath. She was buried on 4 April at Batheaston church, where her father's remains were also interred. Though a letter to Esther from Frances Burney, Madame D'Arblay, in 1824 had rather petulantly complained of what she saw as her niece's neglect: 'I once thought I had caught a bit of her heart -- & I 'tried' for it, 3 or 4 years ago -- but I see, & am sorry to see, my mistake' (ibid., 11.566), Burney's pupils evidently loved their old governess who was a regular visitor and guest (ibid., 11.371). As her aunt observed, in spite of an onerous profession and repeated illness, 'her spirits seem never failing' (ibid.).

Croker, Margaret Sarah (bap. 1773), poet and novelist, was baptized on 4 March 1773 at Holbeton in Devon, the daughter of Captain Richard Croker (died 1816) and his wife, Mary. The high cost of a brother's education prompted Croker to contact the Royal Literary Fund just before her father's death in 1816, in the hope of earning a living by her pen. 
Croker's published poems include 'A Monody on the Lamented Death of Princess Charlotte Augusta' (1817), 'A Tribute to the Memory of Sir Samuel Romilly' (1818), and 'Monody on his Late Royal Highness the Duke of Kent' (1820), expressing her hopes for the future reign of his daughter Victoria. These verse tributes are 'well-written, feeling, but not remarkable' (Blain, Clements & Grundy, 'Feminist comp.', 249). Croker also published a volume of verse, 'Nugae canorae' (1818), by subscription. 
Croker's only surviving novel, 'The Question, who is Anna?' (3 vols., 1818), treats the question of illegitimacy with unusual frankness for its time. Its heroine, born to unmarried young parents, is portrayed sympathetically, rather than condemned. Croker may also have published two other novels, 'Henry de Courtenay' and 'The Widow of Wingfield', and written a further unpublished novel in 1825 (see Blain, Clements & Grundy, 'Feminist comp.', 249), but these cannot be traced. It is not known when she died.
