Isaac Cookson (bap. 1705, d. 1754), who was baptized in Penrith on 11 November 1705, became a notable Newcastle goldsmith, being apprenticed, in 1720, to Francis Batty, and taking over Batty's shop, the Gold Ring, in The Side, following his master's death in 1728. In the 1740s Cookson became a partner in an ultimately unsuccessful lead smelting and refining partnership. This involved mining and smelting lead at Acton Burn, Blanchland, and refining lead and silver at Elswick, Newcastle. Cookson negotiated the lease for the Elswick refining house for fourteen years from May 1743, but it was apparently not renewed after his death. On 23 May 1734 Isaac Cookson married Susanna Gilpin (died 1746) of Whitehaven. They had one daughter, Esther ('b'. 1737). Isaac Cookson died intestate in 1754 and was buried at Newcastle upon Tyne on 22 August 1754.

John Cookson (1712/13?-1783), merchant, glass and iron manufacturer, mine owner, and banker, was the eldest son of Isaac Cookson (died 1743) and Hannah Buston. His date and place of birth are unknown, although it seems likely that he was born in Newcastle in 1712 or 1713. On 9 February 1728 he was apprenticed to Joseph Airey, a mercer and his father's partner in the Closegate flint glasshouse. John Cookson was enrolled by the Merchant Adventurers on 13 March 1728 and given his freedom on 27 April 1738. Prior to this, on 20 January 1736, he was granted leave to travel to improve his skills. 
John Cookson's first known business venture was in 1738 as a partner in the South Shields crown glasshouse. Prior to 1740 he sold, for $375 paid by their father, a sixteenth share in the business to his brother Joseph. Joseph Cookson was living in South Shields in 1740 and may have managed the family's business interests there, which included salt pans and a ballast quay as well as the glasshouse. In 1746 John and Joseph Cookson were listed among the six owners of the plate and crown glasshouse and salt pans at South Shields. 
On 27 July 1743, immediately after he had inherited his father's estate and thus become a wealthy man, John Cookson married Elizabeth, daughter of Walter Lutwidge of Whitehaven. Reputedly, as part of the marriage settlement, Cookson bought an estate at Whitehill, near Chester-le-Street. Here, in partnership with John Button, the son of his father's iron trade partner, he built a blast furnace with the intention of coking local coal and making steel. In the long term, as a steel works, Whitehill was unsuccessful, although, as a foundry, it successfully made high quality cannon in the 1780s. Despite this, in the 1750s Whitehill was part of Cookson's diverse industrial interests which made him one of the most important businessmen in the region. His letters of this period demonstrate a mature grasp of these businesses, which included salt and alum refining and coal and lead mining as well as iron and glass making. These interests extended from Newcastle and South Shields to Chester-le-Street, Hexham, Cumberland, and north Yorkshire, and included Newcastle's trade with London and Glasgow. 
By the mid-1750s John Cookson's status as a wealthy businessman of varied interests led him to become one of four partners in Newcastle's first bank. This was established in Pilgrim Street in 1755, the prime mover being a fellow Newcastle merchant, Ralph Carr. Joseph Airey, Cookson's apprentice master and partner in the Closegate glasshouse, was also a partner. By a deed of co-partnership, drawn up for ten years from 1 January 1756, each partner was to provide paid-up capital of $500. This investment was substantially repaid in profits -- Cookson is estimated to have made $880 in 1758, $823 in 1771, and $1250 in 1776. 
It is not, therefore, surprising that, in drawing up his will in 1774, having left his banking interests to his eldest son, Isaac (1745-1831), and his estates and mines to his wife in her lifetime, then to Isaac, Cookson was able to make very generous financial provisions for five of his six younger children. John Cookson (1754-1802), who subsequently became a London barrister, Thomas Cookson (1757-1775), of the Indian Civil Service, who died before his father, and Joseph Cookson (1763-1800), who subsequently became a captain in the Life Guards, were to receive $10,000 each. The two unmarried daughters, Hannah, who subsequently married Richard Ellison, MP for Lincoln, and Sarah, were to receive $5000 each. There was no legacy to his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, whose portion probably went to her on marriage to a London banker, Samuel Castell, in 1769. 
John Cookson died on 17 December 1783; his will was proved in London on 19 April 1784. His eldest son retired from what had become known as the 'Old Bank' in 1796. However, the family's interests in the coal, glass, and iron industries prospered in the early nineteenth century. Isaac Cookson's estate was valued at $300,000 in 1846. Three of his sons -- John Cookson (1773-1857), of Whitehill, Isaac Cookson (1776-1851), of Meldon Park, Northumberland, and Thomas Cookson (1779-1863), of The Hermitage, Chester-le-Street -- became landed industrialists, creating the basis for further diversification of the Cookson family's industrial interests in the latter part of the century. However, the key figure in the Cookson family's business affairs, and indeed one of the key figures in the business history of north-east England, was John Cookson. His achievements were to diversify his father's broadening industrial interests, ensure a landed base, create new business opportunities with existing partners, develop financial stability via banking, and provide for his younger children's futures by marriage and/or careers in the established professions. No great eighteenth-century magnate could have done more.

Harford, James (1734-1817), iron and tin plate manufacturer and merchant, was the son of Truman Harford (1704-1750), merchant and manufacturer, and Mary Taylor of Baldock, Hertfordshire, and grandson of Charles Harford (1662-1725), a merchant, of Bristol ['see 'Harford family]. He developed a powerful network of tin plate- and iron-making interests and was the foremost among many Bristol merchants who became industrial entrepreneurs in south Wales. He lived at Felindre, Melingriffith, near Cardiff, and at his estate at Chew Magna in Somerset. In 1756 he married Anne Summers, daughter of his business partner, Richard Summers; they had six sons and four daughters. 
Harford developed industrial interests while maintaining his connections in Bristol, where he was a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers and part of an extensive Quaker merchant family. He succeeded by linking and developing existing enterprises rather than establishing new ventures, and was one of the few ironmasters to prosper in the eras of both charcoal and coke fuel. His numerous interests included the Pen-tyrch, Ebbw Vale, Nant-y-glo, Sirhowy, and Caerphilly smelting works in south-east Wales; Redbrook furnace, Monmouth forge, Newent forge, and New Weir forge in the Wye valley; and the Machen and Basaleg forges near Newport, Monmouthshire. 
Harford's central industrial concern was the Melingriffith forge and tin plate works near Cardiff, which was established by Bristol merchants about 1750. He became a partner about 1768, along with the noted ironmaster Richard Reynolds, Richard Summers, and a number of others. By the 1770s he was in partnership with John Partridge sen. ('fl'. 1730s-1770s) and John Partridge jun. ('c'.1736-1816), Quaker ironmasters of Ross, Herefordshire, and Monmouth. In 1795 Harford and his younger brother John Harford (1736- 'c'.1816), with James's sons Richard Summers Harford ['see below'] and Samuel Harford (1766-1838), were major figures in the enterprise. At this time Melingriffith was the largest tin plate works in the world. The main products were tin plate, and wrought-iron bars, sheets, rods, and hoops, but the company also dealt in cast-iron pots, frying pans, anvils, hammers, and spades, some purchased from other manufacturers. Goods were exported under the auspices of James Harford & Co., merchants, of Bristol. In 1805 the nearby Pen-tyrch furnace was bought, and both enterprises were enlarged. However, in 1808 the partnership was dissolved, as the Harfords concentrated on more recently acquired, larger ironworks. They left Felindre, their local residence, in 1810 and Melingriffith and Pen-tyrch were transferred in 1812 to a group led by Richard Blakemore ('b'. 1775), the grandson of John Partridge sen. 
Of the other ironworks interests, most were intended initially to complement the existing business, such as Redbrook furnace and Lydbrook forge, brought into the group through partnership with the Partridges. Caerphilly furnace was acquired in 1781 with a rolling and slitting mill. Although a blowing engine was installed in 1793, the furnace remained charcoal-fuelled and output in 1796 was only 600 tons. It was out of blast by 1805, made obsolete by the larger coke-fuelled works the Harfords had acquired. 
The acquisitions which carried the Harfords into the production of bulk iron began in the 1790s. The only new venture was the ironworks at Nant-y-glo, promoted in 1792 with Thomas Hill, already a successful ironmaster at Blaenafon. Unfortunately, Hill complained that $485 was spent above his $10,000 capital and refused to let production start, even though Harford, Partridge & Co. had spent $16,381. The company was obliged simply to smelt material in stock, and the works lay idle from 1796 until 1802, when Hill returned with different partners. 
Immediately before this debacle, however, Harford, Partridge & Co. had become partners of Jeremiah Homfray at Ebbw Vale ironworks, introducing capital for expansion. It became the sole owner in 1796. This was the first element in what was to become one of the most powerful ironworks enterprises in south Wales. James Harford as senior partner and his brother John as managing partner expanded Ebbw Vale from one blast furnace to four. Then, around the time of James's death in 1817, the company acquired the adjacent Sirhowy works (much to the anger of another ironmaster, Richard Fothergill, who had confided his own plans to renew the lease). This site too was expanded, from two furnaces to five. The period of greatest growth in the Harford iron fortunes ensued, under the management of Richard Summers Harford. Output at Ebbw Vale in 1805 had been 3664 tons; but from the two combined works it was 10,425 tons in 1823 and 26,020 in 1830. The capital value in 1820-21 was over $62,000 and rising rapidly. 
As the possessor of an extensive industrial empire, James Harford was an enthusiastic promoter of improvements to transport. In 1785 he became a trustee of the turnpike from Merthyr Tudful to Tongwynlais, which brought iron to Melingriffith. When the Glamorganshire Canal Company was established in 1790, he was its first honorary treasurer and he and his sons were among the largest shareholders. Richard Crawshay, the Merthyr ironmaster, was constantly at loggerheads on the canal committee with Harford, whom he described as 'a rude, selfish Jew Quaker', insolent, and 'a mercenary fellow who must be treated as Circumstances require' ('Letterbook', xx, 92). Harford, Partridge & Co. and James Harford were also leading shareholders in the Monmouthshire Canal Company. 
Harford's interests in education and workers' welfare were demonstrated at Melingriffith. From about 1775 the works had a scheme for medical attendance, as well as a reading-room. In 1786 a friendly society, the Melingriffith Benefit Club, was established, one of the earliest in south Wales. In 1798 there were sixty-three members, including John Harford, the employees at Melingriffith, and other local people. The club provided social activities, benefits, and pensions, and similar ones were started at Caerphilly in 1787 and at Ebbw Vale. A school for workers and their children existed at Melingriffith before 1786, and in 1807 James Harford invited Joseph Lancaster to address a meeting which resulted in the establishment there by subscription of a Lancastrian school for boys and girls. 
James Harford's sons and grandsons continued in the iron industry. His eldest son, Truman Harford (1758-1803), took the lease of Caerphilly furnace with his father and Philip Crocker in 1789 and dealt with iron orders at Melingriffith in the 1790s, but he established himself also as a brewer in Limehouse, London. Samuel, his fourth son, participated at Melingriffith. John Harford (1768-1851), his fifth son, and his daughters Elizabeth Harford (died 1836) and Sophia Harford ('b'. 1779) lived at Gelliwastad, Machen, about 1816 and may have overseen Caerphilly furnace and Machen forge. 
However, it was James's second son,

John Scandrett Harford (1754-1815). 
John Scandrett Harford ensured the transition of his line from commerce to landed gentry; this was to be consolidated by the conversion of his son John Scandrett Harford the younger (1787-1866) to the Church of England, as well as the latter's advantageous marriage and literary concerns. The elder J. S. Harford maintained the family's industrial interests as a committee member of the Brass Company, and as an iron merchant and a partner in Lydney ironworks in Gloucestershire. He continued as the leading partner of Harford's Bank until his death. In 1782 he was warden, and in 1798 master, of the Bristol Merchant Venturers' Guild. He married another Quaker, Mary Gray (died 1830) of Tottenham, Middlesex, in 1780, and they had nine children. By his death he was said to have trebled the fortune inherited from his father nine years earlier, and left nearly $300,000. He lived at Brunswick Square, Bristol, until 1789, when he purchased the Blaise Castle estate, near Bristol; this signified perhaps the greatest single step in the gentrification of the Harfords. He built a grander house to designs by William Patey about 1795, and commissioned additions by John Nash, Humphry Repton, and George Stanley Repton. He is best remembered for Blaise Hamlet, the estate pensioners' houses built by Nash in 1810-11 at a cost of $3800, one of the most successful examples of picturesque architecture in England now in the care of the National Trust. J. S. Harford the elder died at Blaise Castle on 23 January 1815. 
The Harford family, through its principal Bristol branches, formed a major business empire. This advanced fastest in the generation of the mid- to late eighteenth century led by the first cousins Joseph Harford (1741-1802) of Stapleton, Edward [iii] Harford (1720-1806) of the Blaise Castle line, and Mark [ii] Harford (1738-1798) of Stoke Bishop. Each of these made considerable fortunes in their different sections of the mercantile, banking, and brass trades, and they were linked by their Quakerism, kinship, and common interests. They built upon several generations of expertise and capital, which increased in parallel with the commercial and industrial revolutions. They handed on substantial fortunes to their children, who entered the landed gentry, and for the most part left industry and commerce behind. 
The Harford businesses developed over several generations, and included the major brass-making company of the eighteenth century, mercantile activities, and banking interests which provided capital and credit for the second port of the kingdom. The family progressed from trade to industry, finance, and eventually gentrification. It was the chief among several interrelated Quaker families in Bristol who began as grocers or ironmongers and became wealthy business leaders, including the Champions, Goldneys, Andrews, Scandretts, Truemans, and Lloyds.

Richard Summers Harford (1763-1837), iron manufacturer, who became his effective heir. Richard established Nant-y-glo ironworks and lived nearby at Trosnant until 1799, and continued to operate associated collieries until 1801. He was increasingly involved at Ebbw Vale, which became the focus of the Harford interests, and he built a three-storey mansion, Ebbw Vale House, in 1817. He led the company from the time of his father's death in 1817 until his own in 1837. He followed his father into the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1825 and inherited the Chew Magna estate. In 1792 he married Jane Lloyd Perkins; their sons, Summers Harford and Charles Lloyd Harford, appear subsequently to have taken responsibility for the works. Their iron business was severely damaged by defaults on credits in Maryland, USA, which led to the bankruptcy of Harford, Davies & Co. of Ebbw Vale in 1842. Significantly, the meeting of creditors was held in Bristol. Although Ebbw Vale continued to expand under new owners, this ended almost a century of the Harfords' leadership in the iron trade of south Wales.

Morgan, Robert (bap. 1708, d. 1778), ironmaster, was born at Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, and baptized there on 20 July 1708, the second son of Christopher Morgan, a coal factor of Kidwelly, and Sage Howell. On 29 November 1736 he married, in Llangyndeyrn, Frances Hughes (1703-1773), the daughter of Arnold Bowen, the mayor of Carmarthen in 1722, and widow of Lewis Hughes, attorney and town clerk of Carmarthen, with whom she had four children. There were a further six children of her marriage to Morgan, the first two of whom suffered some form of mental handicap. It was the second son, 
In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries there was a perceptible extension of the iron industry into west Wales, attracted by excellent supplies of water and charcoal. One prominent figure was an English ironmaster, Peter Chettle (1681-1729), who owned a furnace at Pont-henri and two forges at Kidwelly and Whitland, which were sold to Lewis Hughes in 1729. Presumably these fell to Morgan when he married Hughes's widow in 1736. At all events the first distinctive contribution of Robert Morgan to the industry in this area was to bring together under common ownership a number of iron establishments: in this respect he was a consolidator rather than a pioneer. But this is to underrate his contribution both in organizing production and in seeking new markets. On the production side he built up a fully integrated enterprise from manufacturing pig iron to rolling tin plate, and to do so he bought iron ore from Lancashire and Cumberland, and tin from Cornwall. In marketing it was his restless activity which turned to producing guns during the Seven Years' War and, more abidingly, sought outlets for the newer business of tin-plate manufacture. By the late 1750s Morgan was the sole, or major, owner of a blast furnace at Carmarthen, two air furnaces, four forges -- at Whitland, Kidwelly, Cwmdwyfran, and Blackpool (Pembrokeshire) -- and a tin-plate works at Kidwelly. His blast furnaces at Carmarthen produced pig iron, which was converted into bars at the forges and then, from 1758, rolled and tinned at Kidwelly lower works, where Morgan was a partner. By the time this partnership was dissolved in 1761 he had built a new tinworks at Carmarthen. 
For a time, during the Seven Years' War, Morgan considerably modified the production pattern to take advantage of the high profits made possible by the wartime demand for ordnance, although the difficulties of finding -- and keeping -- a reliable gun-founder made it a precarious venture. For a few years from mid-1757 guns and shot were cast for the Board of Ordnance, and guns were also supplied for merchant ships at Bristol and Liverpool. But by the late 1750s tin plate had become the stable core of the business. The scale of his activities was substantial: Carmarthen was unusual for the time in having two mills, built at a cost of $3300; Morgan operated a fully integrated enterprise; there were agents in Bristol, Liverpool, and London; and he told his representative at the twice yearly meeting of ironmasters at Bristol that, because of the size of the works, 'you are Entitled to the First or second Vote' (National Library of Wales, Morgan letter book, 22 Jan 1761). 
Morgan accumulated a substantial landed estate rich in woodlands for charcoal making, and about 1760 built a Georgian residence, Furnace House, in St Peter's Street, Carmarthen, complete with iron rails made in his own works. Frances Morgan died in 1773, and Morgan's own death occurred on 30 April 1778 at Furnace House (not in 1777 as generally given). He was buried in St Peter's churchyard in Carmarthen. After his death the management of the business passed to his second son, John Morgan. This met the wishes of Robert Morgan, who stated in his will that he was 'desirous of having the business of the iron trade carried on properly' and that 'my son John seems to take a delight in the iron trade' (will, quoted in Green, 225). Under John Morgan, who was sheriff for Carmarthenshire in 1782, the works continued to flourish: he was one of a small group of tin-plate manufacturers recorded as meeting in London 'to settle prices, weights and sizes' (Minchinton, 17); and in 1800 the firm maintained three sloops to transport raw materials and finished output. However, in the latter year he leased the undertaking to a partnership including his nephew, also John Morgan. John Morgan sen. remained unmarried and died on 23 March 1805. From 1800 the enterprise was said to have declined through mismanagement, and the family connection was much reduced after the death of John Morgan jun. in 1808, although the Carmarthen works were not finally closed until 1900. Gradual decline was in any event unavoidable for a firm rooted in charcoal iron, even though some coke bars were brought from Monmouthshire from 1800 on: but Robert and John Morgan were undoubtedly pre-eminent among those who laid a tradition which made west Wales the dominant region for tin-plate production for nearly two centuries.

Charles Nevill (1753-1813), born in May 1753, probably on the 2nd, either at Birmingham or Stafford, the youngest of the seven children of Thomas Nevill ('c'.1723- 'c'.1783) of Lichfield and his first wife, Elizabeth Parrock, who died soon after his birth. He entered the Birmingham copper trade at a young age, and became recognized as an important Birmingham button maker in the 1780s. He married, first, Sarah Willets (died 1782) of Rowley Regis, Staffordshire, in 1777, and second, in 1784, Martha ('c'.1746-1821), daughter of Richard Janion of Colchester and widow of William Acton. There were three children from the first marriage, and one son, Richard Janion Nevill ['see below'], from the second. Charles became a shareholder in the Birmingham Mining and Copper Company in the early 1790s, moving to south Wales about 1793 to manage the company's new copper smelting works at Swansea, Glamorgan. 
The short sailing distance between copper ore-rich Cornwall and the coastal coalfield of south-west Wales led to most of Britain's copper smelting capacity being concentrated into a small area around Swansea at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the resulting heavy demand on the local collieries causing serious coal supply and cost problems. Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, a small seaport town 12 miles west of Swansea, possessing a proven but undeveloped coalfield, attracted Charles Nevill's attention as a suitable location for a profitable copper smelting enterprise. He entered into partnership with other industrialists to raise the required capital, the company of 'Daniell, Savill, Guest, and Nevill, coppersmelters' being formed in March 1805. Nevill quickly took up permanent residence in the town to supervise the construction and commissioning of the Llanelli copperworks and its associated dock. A committed Wesleyan from his early years, he also found time to establish a large Sunday school shortly after his arrival. The company became both a copper smelting and coalmining concern with the purchase of local collieries in 1807. Charles Nevill died at his Llanelli home, Vauxhall House, on 20 November 1813, aged sixty, and was buried in Llanelli churchyard. It was later written of him 'it was he made the Copperworks, and the Copperworks made Llanelly' (Mee, xxxiii) and there is little doubt that his advent had laid the foundations of Llanelli's long-term industrialization.

Richard Janion Nevill (1785-1856), youngest son of Charles, born at Summer Hill, Birmingham, on 22 November 1785, assumed local control of the company on his father's death. In 1812 he married Anne ('c'.1782-1863), eldest daughter of William Yalden (died 1810), originally of Lavington, Hampshire, and his wife, Anne, who were resident at Llanelli from about 1784. The Nevills lived at Glanmor House, a newly built house near the copperworks, and there were eight children from the marriage. Richard Janion expanded the copperworks and collieries throughout his years of control, diversifying the company into brass, yellow metal, lead and silver smelting, and shipping; additional industrial interests were acquired outside Llanelli. Changes in partnership led to alterations in the company name -- Daniell, Savill, Sons, and Nevill in 1817, Daniell, Son, and Nevill in 1819, Daniell, Nevill & Co. in 1824, and Sims, Willyams, Nevill, Druce & Co. in 1837. The company was responsible for some 13 per cent of Britain's copper production by 1833, making it the nation's joint third largest copper smelting concern, a position it maintained over the following two decades. Separate from the company's affairs, Richard Janion also had personal involvement in banking, industrial shareholding, the timber trade, shipping, land purchase, and mineral leasing, to the extent that it was often difficult to distinguish between his interests and those of the company, clarification of ownership being sought on more than one occasion by his partners. He moved to Llangennech Park, a mansion 5 miles from Llanelli, in 1834, and was appointed a magistrate in 1835 and high sheriff of Carmarthenshire a year later; he was also locally active in support of the Conservative Party at that time. 
Richard Janion Nevill suffered a stroke and died at Llangennech Park on 14 January 1856, aged seventy. He was buried on 18 January in Llangennech parish churchyard. At the time of his death the company was still one of Britain's premier copper smelters employing some 550 in its copperworks, and a major coalmining concern employing more than 1000 and responsible for almost 3 per cent of the total production of the south Wales coalfield. Surviving evidence yields a contradictory picture of the person who controlled Llanelli's industrial development for more than forty years. Reported as hot-tempered, and certainly a ruthless man of business employing child labour in his collieries up to 1842, he nevertheless provided aid at personal loss during times of grain shortages, built a large British school, the Copperworks School, for his workmen's children in 1848, and was involved in Anglican church provision and endowment to the time of his death. The attendance at his funeral was unprecedented for Llanelli, some 3000, including most of the company's workforce, forming the procession to the churchyard.

Thomas Coster (1684-1739), their eldest son, was born on 20 December 1684. He was married twice, first, in 1720, to Jane Rous, and second, to Astrea (died 1738), daughter of Sir John Smith of Long Ashton, Bristol. While residing at College Green, Bristol, in 1734, Thomas Coster was elected tory member of parliament for the city. A petition to parliament from the mayor and corporation after the election asserted that invalid votes had been responsible for his defeat of the former whig member but was withdrawn when difficulty arose substantiating the claim, which appears to have arisen solely from political bias. In the Commons Coster actively represented local commercial interests, including presenting a petition on behalf of the Society of Merchant Adventurers of Bristol on 3 March 1738. He retained his seat until his death, some five years later, when the great bell of every parish church in the city is said to have tolled throughout the day. 
At Bristol Thomas Coster's responsibility for extending the manufacturing operations of the family business in the city included the establishment in 1728 of an additional new mill site. He became a partner in the Bristol Brass Company when it assimilated the Upper Redbrook Copper Company in 1722. Thomas, like his father before him, had previously worked in close association with the Bristol company and now, also like his father, he continued to confine his business activities to the production of copper. By 1730 the brass company had closed the Redbrook smelting site in favour of its Bristol works. 
An abandoned works at Melincryddan, near Neath, south Wales, provided a replacement smelting site for the Costers' own separate family business during the planning of a large new site at White Rock, Swansea. The site had many advantages and, with its accessibility for seaborne transport of copper ores and the existence of massive stocks of coal, Swansea would later become the centre of copper smelting in Britain. However, at that time Bristol still remained the country's main focus of copper production, and satisfied local demands for copper to alloy with zinc in order to maintain production of its large output of brass. White Rock was not completed until after Thomas's death, which occurred in Bristol on 30 September 1739, by which time he was the sole survivor of the Coster brothers. 
Thomas Coster left $40,000 and his property to his only child, Jane (1720-1808), who in 1741 married John Hoblyn (died 1751), after he had become an active partner in the family business. Although the male line of the Coster copper smelters ceased with Thomas, Jane, through her husband, extended the business involvement of the family. She erected a plaque to her father's memory in Bristol Cathedral. 
Thomas Coster's two younger brothers were active mainly in Cornwall.

John [ii] Coster (1647-1718). Born probably in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, he was the second of three sons of John [i] Coster (1615-1678), iron-forge manager or smelter in the forest. John [ii]'s elder brother, Arthur (died 1679), was involved in leasing property in Leigh Woods near Bristol in 1678 on behalf of Sir Clement Clerke (died 1693) of Launde Abbey, Leicestershire, who was interested in experimental work in lead smelting. Under the management of Clerke's son Talbot, these experiments resulted in the successful introduction of coal to replace more expensive charcoal, thus lowering the production costs of lead. John [ii] was described in papers relating to a chancery action as 'chief agent' of the process by 1685, when he was thirty-eight. The work was abandoned in that year because patent rights were claimed by George Villiers, fourth Viscount Grandison (died 1699), the entrepreneur with whom the Clerkes worked originally at Leigh Woods and whose attempts elsewhere to use coal for lead smelting had proved less successful. 
The Clerkes' Bristol experiments then turned to the coal-fired smelting of copper under the management of John [ii] Coster, who was later acknowledged to have been mainly responsible for the success of these new smelting techniques. An adapted reverberatory furnace was used, which reflected, or 'reverberated', heat from a vaulted roof, and separated the coal and its gases from the melting ores below. Later the process proved applicable also to tin, but it was particularly significant in revitalizing English copper smelting, which previously had proved uneconomic and had been entirely abandoned. Its revival during the early years of the eighteenth century provided a basis for a thriving British industry in the production of copper and its alloy, brass. 
John [ii] Coster went on to manage a copper-smelting works for the London partnership headed by William Dockwra ('c'.1635-1716), at Upper Redbrook on the River Wye. By the 1690s he was supplying, via the Thames, Dockwra's copper and brass works at Esher in Surrey. In the next decade he was developing his smelting methods, extending his activities to copper mining in Cornwall, where he bought ores extensively, and, still later, supplying the four major copper and brass companies, which, by then, had become established. In developing his own separate family business, he manufactured copper goods at watermills near Bristol, introducing water-powered rolling to the area. His headquarters were later established in the city. 
John [ii] Coster was increasingly assisted by his three sons before his death at Upper Redbrook, Gloucestershire, on 13 October 1718. He left his wife, Mary (1664/5-1734), twenty shares in the Redbrook company, a mansion at Whitecliff, Monmouthshire, and two houses on College Green, Bristol. Both John and Mary Coster were included on an engraved family memorial erected by their son Thomas in All Saints' Church, Newland, the parish church of Upper Redbrook, where they were buried.

Alexander, George William (1802-1890), banker and philanthropist, was born on 25 April 1802 in Bunhill Row, London, the first of nine children, eight of whom survived to maturity, of William Alexander (1769-1819), bill broker, and his wife, Ann Alexander, nee Barber (1774/5-1861), of Eckington, east Derbyshire. At the age of four he was sent away to a boys' school in Rochester kept by his uncle, William Rickman, who maintained discipline by the use of the birch. Leaving school shortly before he was fourteen, he joined his father's firm of Alexander & Co. in Lombard Street in the City of London. He worked half-days until he was fourteen and a half, and then became a regular full-time clerk. Part of his daily round was to take down the shutters and to sweep out the offices. 
It was not a propitious time. Trading conditions were generally difficult in the aftermath of war with Napoleon and many firms failed. Then in 1819 William Alexander died and it was decided to carry on the business in the name of his widow. Ann was aided and advised by a former colleague of William's and by her eldest son, who was already showing promise of being a successful bill broker. From the age of seventeen until he was almost twenty-one he worked without a day's holiday, with the consequence that he suffered a severe breakdown for a time. On coming of age he was made a partner, and became head of the firm when his mother Ann retired in 1838. 
Like many other bill brokers and bankers in the early years of the nineteenth century, the Alexanders were Quakers, and George William followed the example of the great Quaker entrepreneurs in taking over an existing, modest-sized family business and transforming it into a much larger enterprise. Bill brokers originally acted purely as agents, buying and selling bills of exchange on commission. Gradually, in the wake of the financial crisis of 1825, changed circumstances led Alexanders and other of the more significant houses to begin to trade as principals, buying bills for their own portfolio and financing them with balances left by bankers 'at call'. In 1831 the firm obtained the right to discount bills for cash at the Bank of England and so could guarantee to repay loans taken. Thereafter progress was rapid and by 1847 the firm was sufficiently well known to be referred to in W. M. Thackeray's novel 'Vanity Fair', in which John Sedley asserts that 'Alexander would cash my bill, down sir, down on the counter, sir' (Thackeray, 'Vanity Fair', 373). 
Under George William's direction Alexanders acquired a reputation for being prudently managed, and this undoubtedly helped him to bring the firm through the periodic financial crises that caused so many others to fail -- not least because official and other help was encouraged in time of need. In the crisis of 1866, their giant rival, Overend, Gurney & Co., was refused accommodation by the Bank of England on the grounds that its business was unsound, and the company consequently collapsed. By taking advantage of the opportunities thus presented, Alexanders was able to establish itself as the leading private firm in the market. When the rise of the joint-stock discount companies posed a threat to the existence of the private firms, George William responded by amalgamating Alexanders for a period (1864-77) with Cunliffes & Co. Subsequently Alexanders came to rank alongside the National and the Union discount companies as one of the three leading discount houses. 
George William followed Quaker tradition in his support for one of the great Victorian philanthropic movements, being for nearly forty years the 'indefatigable' treasurer of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (Isichei, 184). Not content with the routine obligation to be included in a published list of subscribers, he opened his home -- 'An abode of spotless order and of industry and hospitality' (Dixon, 4) -- to a succession of runaway slaves and political refugees. He opposed moves towards free trade that would allow the import of cheap slave-grown sugar and in 1842 published his 'Letters on the Slave Trade, Slavery and Emancipation'. In 1849-50 he toured the West Indies to investigate conditions at first hand. He also had charitable interests closer to home and in 1848 was one of the founders of Victoria Park Hospital, London. 
Alexander was married twice, first in 1835 to Sarah Cleverly Horsnaill (1801-1843), with whom he had two sons and two daughters, and second in 1845 to Catherine Horsnaill (1806-1878), possibly his first wife's cousin; they had a daughter. Both sons became partners in the firm. He lived first at The Willows, Stoke Newington, Middlesex, and then, from 1853, at Reigate, Surrey. He retired from business in 1883. Alexander died at his home, Woodhatch, Reigate, on 24 November 1890. 
The firm that Alexander inherited and transformed was the only private discount house to convert successfully to a limited company before 1914: it became a public company in 1911, operating as Alexanders Discount Co. Ltd. It was still trading in 1995, as Alexanders Discount plc, the longest-surviving discount house.

Benjamin Gibbons (1735-1832) were ironmasters as well as ironmongers. Benjamin Gibbons was entrusted with management of the iron business around Kingswinford, which in the 1780s comprised forges at Hyde and Lye and warehouses at Stourport, Lower Gornal, and Hyde. Thomas Gibbons took charge of the merchant house at Wolverhampton which was subsequently developed as a bank; and in 1775 he married Mary Moseley (died 1833). At the same time William Gibbons ran the family's merchant house at Bristol, buying pig iron for the midland forges and overseeing the export of metalwares to the American market. In 1778 William married Phyllis Watkins (1760-1791). 
The brothers took full advantage of the boom in the iron industry which followed the end of the American War of Independence. They extended their interests rapidly, taking in kinsmen as junior partners and mortgaging land to supply investment funds when circulating capital could not be spared from the ironware business. Thus, Benjamin Gibbons built a blast furnace at Bilston in 1787, taking his cousins William and Benjamin Bickley as partners; and in 1788 he joined his two brothers in leasing a furnace at the Level, as well as a forge and slitting mill at Cradley. In this way the Gibbonses emerged as major figures in the iron industry of their native region, operating seven blast furnaces with associated forge capacity by 1812. William Gibbons achieved eminence as a citizen of Bristol as well, becoming mayor of the city in 1800-01. Indeed, William Gibbons also became an industrial lobbyist of national reputation. He was a spokesman for the iron trade during the debates on Britain's commercial future in the wake of the American debacle, giving voice to ironmasters' anxieties concerning the 'Irish propositions' in 1785, in which William Pitt the younger sought to establish free trade with Ireland; and he also took issue with the commercial treaty negotiated in the same year with France by William Eden. Later, he twice led campaigns to avert the taxation of pig iron during the Napoleonic wars, in 1797-8 and in 1806, on each occasion with success. 
The single partnership which had governed the family's affairs in the late eighteenth century was divided up after the death at Bristol of William Gibbons in 1807. The Bristol house was signed over to his only son, William (1782-1848), who was married to Anne Every (1784-1855). At the same time the midland property was divided between his surviving brothers. After the death of Thomas Gibbons in 1813 at Teignmouth his share in the midland banking and ironmaking businesses passed to his three sons: John (1777-1851) ['see below'], Benjamin (1783-1873) and Thomas (1787-1829). The control of this new generation was consolidated a year later with the retirement of the elder Benjamin Gibbons, who made over the Level furnaces and other industrial plant to his nephews in return for an annuity, a capital sum of $24,000, and the Corbyns Hall estate which the family had purchased in 1779. The separating off of Benjamin Gibbons's interests was providential, for it was to allow the family to recover from the bankruptcy which overwhelmed it in the post-war slump. The three brothers were gazetted bankrupt as bankers in March 1816, pulling the iron business down with them. Something was saved from the wreck when the eighty-year-old Benjamin Gibbons, in the guise of a preferential creditor, compelled the assignees to transfer the Level works and collieries to him. Benjamin senior lived until 1832. 
From this foundation the family was able to rebuild its fortune. The three sons of Thomas Gibbons (1730-1813) were involved in a set of interlocking partnerships, centred on the Level works but extending to Corbyns Hall, where three new furnaces were built in the mid-1820s, and to the Ketley works near Dudley.

Benjamin Gibbons (1815-1863), ironmaster, the youngest son of William Gibbons (1782-1848), entered the iron industry via firebrick manufacture. He leased the Hallfields furnace in the Black Country in 1846 and the Tipton Green ironworks in 1847. In the mid-1850s he took over the Millfield works, only a short distance from the now derelict Bilston furnace which his family had built in 1788, but by the end of the decade he had begun a partial withdrawal from the west midland iron trade. Hallfields and Tipton Green were both given up in 1859. Millfield remained in his hands, but Benjamin Gibbons's attention was now directed to the Forest of Dean, where he had purchased the Soudley ironworks in 1856. His premature death on 3 September 1863 at Athol House, Edgbaston, Birmingham, ended any chance of a renewal of the family's involvement in the iron industry. He was survived by his wife, Emily. In the later nineteenth century the surviving branches of the family lived as 'rentier' gentry.

William Harrison (d. 1745). He and his sons, Andrews and John, were the main suppliers of guns and shot in Britain in the mid-eighteenth century. The origins of William Harrison are unknown, but he is mentioned in Board of Ordnance records in 1715 acting first as surety for Richard Jones, iron-founder in Southwark, then completing his contracts for him. In 1717 he lodged a bond for $1000 with the Treasury before delivering his guns and two years later he was put on the same footing as other contractors. Within a short time he became the most important founder, supplying guns, shot, or cast-iron wheels to the board almost every year until his death. From 1718 until 1744 Harrison had a virtual monopoly selling guns and ammunition to the East India Company. A large part of his business was supplying guns for the company's ships, as well as for other merchantmen; and he also bought old guns from the East India Company and the board, indicating he had access to an air furnace to melt them down. 
Harrison had a wide network of partners. Early on he worked with Richard Jones, Samuel Gott, and Stephen Peters, and with William Jukes he leased Robertsbridge furnace, Sussex. He is frequently mentioned in John Fuller's letters, selling guns which had failed proof or lending others to complete contracts for payment. In 1741 Harrison formed a partnership with Samuel Remnant, master smith at Woolwich and Fuller's agent, and John Legas and William Gott of Lamberhurst, between them controlling five wealden furnaces: Lamberhurst, Waldron, Brede, Conster, and Hamsell. Remnant got the most profitable contracts for his partners and the least for Fuller. With so many orders, the partners were able to plan casting programmes, using the capability of each furnace, always having at least one furnace working all year with access to the sea while another was devoted to producing shot. In 1743, out of a total of 752 guns supplied to the board, 591 were from the partners and the following year 324 out of 519. Moreover, since the board paid for the actual weight of iron, Harrison made his guns as heavy as possible within the acceptable limits to maximize his profits. Although owning property in Sussex, Harrison remained in London, living at New Broad Street and leasing Stone Wharf, Southwark, from which he carried out his trade in guns. 
William Harrison died in London in January 1745 at New Broad Street, and under his will Remnant and Legas looked after the business interests of his two sons, while Harrison's clerk, Robert Bagshaw, was named guardian. The elder son,

John Harrison (b. 1729, d. before 1792) was also born there, in November 1729. Their father's partnership was dissolved when John came of age in 1750. The board began prosecuting Remnant for stealing iron over many years and accused Legas and the Harrisons of colluding with him to keep the price of iron artificially high. From then on the Harrisons were only employed by the board in time of war. Having also lost their father's monopoly of East India Company business, they concentrated on guns for the export and merchant market. 
When the Seven Years' War started in 1756 the board was forced to order guns, shot, and trucks from the Harrisons, now in partnership with Bagshaw and Richard Tapsell, Legas's nephew, because they still controlled more furnaces than anyone else. The Harrison business reached its apogee in 1760, supplying 864 guns out of 1991. Again the numbers derived from intelligent use of several furnaces, rather than from any technical improvements, although they were the only founders willing to cast the very large 42-pounder guns. 
At the end of the war the board was in a financial crisis, delaying payments to contractors. Tapsell was declared bankrupt and the Harrisons began to withdraw from casting iron, and let go their furnaces to concentrate on selling instead. This mirrored what was happening generally in the iron industry, where a shortage of skilled labour had led to a slowdown in the spread of gun-founding on a large scale, and caused the closure of many wealden furnaces after the end of the Seven Years' War. This gave competitors a chance to recruit skilled founders, and the war marked the end of the dominance of the wealden gun-founders. For the first time Welsh and midlands founders supplied ordnance. The board believed that again the iron-founders had conspired to keep the cost of iron up, and used the low price offered by the Carron Company of Scotland to force other gun-founders to lower their price. The Harrisons refused to do this. 
In the 1770s the business took new directions; the Harrison brothers formed a new company with Samuel Ambrose and Joseph Stanley. They used their old contacts in an important new venture; by 1775 they became agents for John Wilkinson (1728-1808) and his new solid-bored guns with both the Board of Ordnance and the East India Company. During the American War of Independence Wilkinson became one of the most reliable suppliers of guns, consistently producing high-quality guns in large numbers. However the company suffered when the board abruptly cancelled orders, and yet again drastically lowered the price for iron guns at the end of the war. Again the Harrisons refused on behalf of Wilkinson to lower their prices to those offered by the Walker family of Rotherham, and again lost the contracts. 
During the same period the business changed direction and became increasingly involved in wrought-iron production, taking on new premises in Deptford for anchor making and in Skinnerburn, north-east England, for nail-making. It continued to have some part in the gun trade through its ships' chandlery business at Lime Street, near the Thames. By 1786 a member of the Gordon family replaced Ambrose as a partner. By this time the Harrisons were playing a smaller part in the business; Andrews died about 1786 and John was dead by 1792. The new firm of Gordon and Stanley continued to represent John Wilkinson until 1797, after which it gave up the gun trade. It remained in maritime ironmongery, and under the name of Gordon Brothers it was able to enter the new industry of building iron ships at its yards in Deptford from 1828 until 1843.

William [ii] Hawks (bap. 1730, d. 1810); he and his first wife, Elizabeth Dixon (1735/6-1808), whom he married in 1759, are credited with the great expansion of the Hawks industrial empire. 
During the 1760s and 1770s William [ii] Hawks featured in several partnerships with local ironmongers and edge tool makers. But it was the formation of a fresh partnership in the late 1770s, with

Thomas Longridge (bap. 1751, d. 1803), a Sunderland merchant, that was the springboard for a sudden expansion of the Hawks enterprises: a plating forge was acquired at Beamish, co. Durham, in 1779, the first of four separate metalworking sites operated by Hawks and Longridge along Beamish Burn; additional smiths' shops were rented at Ouseburn on the north bank of the Tyne in 1780; a forge at Lumley, co. Durham, was occupied by the firm in the mid-1780s; and in the late 1780s slitting and rolling mills on the River Blyth in the modern county of Northumberland were taken on. By the 1790s the works at Gateshead comprised a substantial industrial complex, now producing steel, anchors, heavy chains, and steam-engine components, as well as a great diversity of smaller iron wares. The supply of ironware to the Navy Board became a speciality -- as the title New Greenwich implied. The firm's products were shipped via Hawks's London partners, the Gordon and Stanley families. These families were involved in a series of partnerships with William [ii] Hawks and his successors, with whom the Stanleys intermarried. William [ii] married for a second time in 1809. His new wife, Elizabeth (died 1831), was the widow of Joseph Atkinson. Both the Hawks and Stanley families, it may be presumed, could supply the merchant capital which William [ii] Hawks lacked, and both had links to the old ordnance industry of the Weald and the naval yards of the Thames and Medway. 
These maritime and military markets were evidently profitable, for the estate of William [ii] Hawks was assessed at 'under $30,000' at his death at Gateshead on 4 December 1810, when the works in the north-east passed to his surviving sons:

George Hawks (1801-1863), was a political notable in a more liberal vein. Born on 7 January 1801, he was a key local supporter of Sir William Hutt, Gateshead's free-trade MP after 1841, and he served as mayor of the borough in 1836, 1848, and 1849. His home at Redheugh Hall became one of the organizing centres of Liberalism in the north east. He married Elizabeth Clark Wright in 1827, and died on 15 October 1863. He was buried at Gateshead. 
The firm reached its apogee in the early Victorian period, when its reputation for engineering and bridge building was worldwide, and to which the striking High Level Bridge across the Tyne, completed by the firm in 1849, stands as a fitting memorial. At its height the New Greenwich works could boast a workforce of more than 2000. However, the grip of the Hawks family upon the firm which bore its name was increasingly tenuous. Of the fourth generation, only George Hawks displayed the entrepreneurial ability of his forebears. Hannah, Lady Hawks (died 1863), the widow of Sir Robert Shafto Hawks, and her two sons -- the one blind, the other destined for the church -- sold their shares in 1840 to George Crawshay (1794-1873), a member of the great iron-making family of south Wales, who had himself recently been bought out of his family's iron merchanting business in London by his brother William Crawshay (1788-1867). The business developed by William [ii] Hawks had been divided between his three eldest surviving sons in 1810. George Crawshay had thus acquired one of these three blocks. When he was able to acquire the shares of Joseph Stanley Hawks (1790-1875), the only surviving son of George Hawks of Blackheath, he captured a second. 
The dominant influence over the firm of Hawks, Crawshay & Sons in its last years was George Crawshay (1821-1896), the son of George Crawshay and his wife, Louise ('nee' Dufaud, of the family of French ironmasters). Like George Hawks, George Crawshay became a considerable political figure in the north-east. It may be that he devoted too much of his time to his political pursuits, however, for by the 1870s and 1880s the overcrowded Gateshead site, home to a great diversity of processes and product lines, compared unfavourably with the more streamlined and specialized engineering yards established along the Tyne by entrepreneurs such as Sir William Armstrong. Product diversity had once been the foundation of the Hawks family's success; it was increasingly a sign of technological senescence. A crisis was reached in 1889, when New Greenwich was suddenly closed. The circumstances surrounding the closure remain somewhat mysterious, for the firm's creditors were paid in full (and the company's archive destroyed). However, the dismantling of the works finally ended the association of the Hawks family with Gateshead.

Francis [ii] Homfray (1725-1798), of Broadwaters and Stourton Castle, who was to achieve fame in the iron trade. Born on 9 September 1725, he greatly extended the family's undertakings along the Stour and invested in the Shropshire coke iron industry. This period of expansion was related to his two marriages. In 1751 he married Hannah Popkin (died 1754), a member of an important ironmaking family based in south Wales. After her death in 1754, he married in 1756 Catherine (died 1766), the daughter of Jeremiah Caswell, one of the principal iron manufacturers operating on the River Stour. By 1787 Francis [ii] Homfray and John Addenbrooke owned the Lightmoor ironworks in Shropshire. In 1778 Francis [ii] was a partner in the Calcutts ironworks, also in Shropshire, at which cannon were manufactured during and after the American War of Independence. 
Two of Francis [ii] Homfray's sons continued to be involved in the midlands iron industry, operating a series of forges and mills along the River Stour. Francis [iii] Homfray (1757-1809), of The Hyde, married Mary Pidcock in 1778, and their two elder daughters married into the Crawshay family; Jeston Homfray (1752-1816) married Sarah Pidcock in 1776. After Jeston Homfray's death in 1816 his wife continued to run the Stourton mill as Widow Homfray & Son. 
However, a crisis in the ironmaking business of Anthony Bacon ('bap'. 1717, died 1786) was to draw Francis [ii] Homfray to south Wales. Bacon, a successful merchant who was manufacturing cannon at Cyfarthfa, was also MP for Aylesbury. When in 1782 'Clerke's Act' was passed prohibiting government contractors from sitting in the House of Commons, Bacon circumvented this problem by subletting the mill and forge to another operator, with the stipulation that the concern had to purchase his Cyfarthfa iron. He turned to Francis [ii] whose wide experience in slitting iron and manufacturing nails, selling iron and iron goods, operating forges and blast furnaces, and boring cannon had gained him all the necessary skills to work the forge and the mill. Bacon persuaded Homfray to lease the Cyfarthfa undertakings in 1784 with rather restrictive terms. 
Francis [ii] Homfray worked the forge and mill until March 1786. However, after a disagreement with Bacon over the supply of iron, he gave up the lease of the Cyfarthfa property. While working at Cyfarthfa, he had seen the potential for ironmaking at Merthyr Tudful. As a result, he encouraged two of his other sons --

Sir Jeremiah Homfray (1759-1833), born on 16 February 1759 -- to lease land at Penydarren and build an ironworks. The partnership was soon expanded when their brother Thomas Homfray (1760-1825) and members of the Forman family invested in the Penydarren ironworks. William Forman, one of the new partners, was an ordnance agent at the Tower of London and had become acquainted with the Homfrays through cannon manufacture. 
In 1795 Samuel Homfray was the chief promoter of the Glamorgan Canal. While managing the Penydarren ironworks he appears to have worked closely with Richard Crawshay (1739-1810) in improving Henry Cort's puddling process for making wrought iron. Crawshay and Homfray were both abrasive characters: Crawshay described Homfray as 'so ungrateful and litigious that I cannot be on neighbourly terms with him' (R. Crawshay to the Revd George Maber, 16 Nov 1795, Gwent RO, D2/162, fol. 169). Both Samuel Homfray and Richard Crawshay, in evidence to a parliamentary committee in 1811, cast doubt on Cort's patent for his puddling process, but whereas Crawshay queried its effectiveness, Homfray challenged its originality, and there is no evidence of collusion between them. 
A quarrel between Samuel and Jeremiah Homfray concerning expenditure on the Penydarren ironworks saw the management of the business fall completely on Samuel Homfray's shoulders. As sole manager of the works he could pursue his own deep interest in steam power. He installed Boulton and Watt engines to increase output and also manufactured boiler plate and engine parts. His interest in steam power brought him into contact with Richard Trevithick (1771-1833) in May 1803. The result of this meeting was that Samuel Homfray bought a one-quarter share in Trevithick's high-pressure steam patent. Homfray encouraged Trevithick to develop his high-pressure engine and one of Trevithick's engines was constructed at Penydarren in 1804 as a tram road locomotive. This locomotive is acknowledged as the world's first steam locomotive and it made several trips along the Penydarren tram road before being converted to stationary use. 
In 1787 Jeremiah Homfray married Mary Richards (died 1830). Barred from active management at Penydarren, he turned his talents to the development of other ironworks along the northern outcrop of the south Wales coalfield. He was involved in the early development of ironworks at Ebbw Vale, Aber-nant, and Hirwaun, and, in fact, seems to have made a profitable career in setting up ironworks and then selling them as going concerns. He was also later involved in leasing land for coalmining, but this proved to be less successful than his ventures in the iron trade and led to his bankruptcy. Sir Jeremiah Homfray, who was knighted in 1809, died on 9 January 1833. 
Samuel Homfray seems, like many of his family, to have had a restless nature and about 1813 he left the Penydarren Iron Company to concentrate his resources on developing the Tredegar ironworks in Monmouthshire. Handicapped at Penydarren by a shortage of coal on the property, he faced no such problems when he built his new works. In 1793 Samuel Homfray married Mary Jane (died 1846), widow of Captain Henry Ball RN and the elder daughter of Sir Charles Gould Morgan of Tredegar. The marriage saw Homfray's fortunes tied closely to those of one of the most important landowning gentry families in south-east Wales. In 1800 Morgan leased to Homfray land at Bedwellte Common, Tredegar, on which he developed the Tredegar ironworks. By 1823 Tredegar had five furnaces in blast, producing over 16,000 tons of iron each year. Homfray's connection with Penydarren continued, however, for his daughter Amelia married one of the works' owners, William Thompson (1793-1854). Samuel Homfray's success as a businessman led him to become high sheriff of Monmouthshire, and he served as MP for Stafford from 1818 to 1820. He is thought to have been the 'Mr. H' who harassed Wilberforce on a coach journey on 13 November 1816, who 'with stentorian voice left me no peace till his whole tale was told. Inventor of tram roads, founder of all great iron works in Monmouthshire, etc.' (HoP, 'Commons, 1790-1820', 220). 
After Samuel Homfray's death on 20 May 1822 his sons, Watkin Homfray (1796-1837) and Samuel Homfray (1795-1883), continued to take an active role in the management of the Tredegar ironworks. The Homfray family's involvement with the Tredegar ironworks continued until 1868, when the family sold its shares to the Fothergill and Forman families, who were co-partners. 
The Homfray family played a major part in the changes introduced in the south Wales iron industry during the industrial revolution. Members of the family were highly involved in promoting the adoption in south Wales of coal-using technology in the iron industry. Furthermore, the Homfrays' story exemplifies the migration of skills to Wales from the west midlands and clearly demonstrates the rise of steam power in the British iron industry.

Richard Knight (1659-1745). He was the son of Richard Knight of Madeley, Shropshire, and he learned his trade while working at the Lower Coalbrookdale forge. He then moved to take over the Morton forge on the River Roden, also in Shropshire. Here he met and married Elizabeth (1671-1754), the daughter of Andrew Payne of Shawbury, a member of a prominent Shropshire family involved in the iron industry. They had four sons, two of whom followed their father into the iron trade. At various times Richard Knight held furnaces at Flaxley in the Forest of Dean, Willey in Shropshire, and Ruabon in north Wales. He also owned several forges in Shropshire and the Stour valley. 
Richard Knight's interests in the iron industry of the midlands were further expanded when he entered the 'Ironworks in Partnership', which was dominated by the Foley family (per. c.1620-1716). The group comprised several ironmasters who brought their ironmaking properties together to form an important company, which was a major force within the British charcoal iron industry. Also from about 1698 Richard Knight operated the Bringewood furnace and forge and these were later linked with the Charlcotte furnace. 
By 1725 Richard Knight had left the Ironworks in Partnership in order to expand his ironmaking interests in the Stour valley. This he achieved with the help of his son

Edward Knight (1699-1780) when they entered into a partnership with Sir Thomas Lyttleton of Hagley Hall. Lyttleton brought Hales furnace into the partnership while the Knights contributed forges at Cookley and Whittington, both situated on the River Stour. The pig iron from Hales could be refined at the Stour forges to make wrought iron. This iron then found a ready market among the smiths and nailers of the midlands. 
Richard Knight seems to have exhibited much drive and enthusiasm in building up his ironmaking empire. He was certainly not afraid of switching his resources from area to area and managed to build up a large personal fortune through his activities in the iron trade. He died in 1745, five years after his retirement from the active management of the family's ironworks. 
The Knight family's interest in the iron trade now lay in two distinct and separate partnerships. The Bringewood partnership held furnaces at Bringewood and Charlcotte in Shropshire and the forge at Bringewood. The Stour partnership held Hales furnace and a series of forges along the River Stour; it was dominated by the Knights and from the late 1730s was totally in the hands of the family. From the retirement of Richard Knight the iron business had been managed by his sons Edward and

Ralph Knight (1703-1754), who married Mary Dupa. Edward Knight was the innovator and in the late 1730s and early 1740s he built a plating mill at Bringewood to produce plate to be tinned at one of the family's Stour forges. This was one of the earliest tin-plate making concerns in Britain. In 1726 Edward married Elizabeth James, heir of Olton End, Warwickshire. The marriage produced three sons and three daughters.

John [i] Knight (1740-1795). James was unmarried, but John [i] married Henrietta Cunyngham. The successful operation of all the Knight family's ironworks allowed a period of expansion in the 1740s and 1750s, when Aston furnace and a forge at Bromford, near Birmingham, were purchased. The four furnaces owned by the family gave it an important position in the British iron industry and in the late 1750s the Knights produced about 8 per cent of Britain's total pig iron output. 
Edward Knight had the foresight to adapt to the changing conditions in the iron industry during the 1750s. Charcoal iron was now competing with coke iron, whose manufacture was spreading quickly. Edward Knight used his home at Wolverley House, Worcestershire, as the centre of his operations and Wolverley forge was one of the most important parts of his ironmaking empire. It was here during the 1750s that Edward Knight introduced the manufacture of wrought iron using coke iron from Shropshire. Edward Knight was one of the first ironmasters to use coke iron at a forge, so demonstrating the acceptability of coke iron and heralding its dominance over charcoal iron. 
Edward Knight retired from his business interests in 1771 leaving the furnaces and forges to be managed by James Knight, John [i] Knight, and their uncle Abraham Spooner. This took place during a period of great uncertainty as the charcoal iron industry came under increasing pressure from the spread of the manufacture of iron using coke as a fuel. The activities of the Bringewood partnership ended in 1779 and by 1785 all the family's charcoal-fired furnaces had been finally blown out. Edward Knight died in 1780.

John [ii] Knight (1765-1850) to take a prominent position in the Stour partnership. He had a most dynamic disposition for he immediately drew up plans to modernize the family's forges. John [ii] Knight applied the new methods of making wrought iron with coke to the forges. However, the death of James Knight in 1808 prompted a dismemberment of the partnership. The Spooner family took over the ownership of the properties around Birmingham, leaving John [ii] Knight with a reduced number of forges along the River Stour. Knight now concentrated his resources at one site on the Stour. This was the Cookley ironworks, where the manufacture of wire and tin plate was introduced alongside the production of wrought iron. After successfully modernizing Cookley John [ii] Knight seems to have searched for further challenges using money generated by the sale of shares in the Cookley concern. This took the form of purchases of land on Exmoor and in 1830 Knight took up residence in the area at Simonsbath House. His first wife was Helen Charlotte Weir. John [ii] Knight's considerable talents and energies were now being channelled away from the iron trade and into a scheme for taming and farming parts of Exmoor's wild lands. This interest in Exmoor was financed by selling some of his holdings in the family business to outsiders. However, Knight did not realize all his schemes for Exmoor since the health of his second wife, Jane Elizabeth Winn, daughter of the first Baron Headley, began to fail, which prompted a move to Jersey and then, later, another to Rome, where she died in 1841. 
The sale of shares in the Cookley ironworks left the Knight family as a minority holder in the partnership. However, deaths among the partners in the late 1870s and early 1880s forced

Sir Frederic Winn Knight (1812-1897), John [ii] Knight's eldest son, to become managing partner. At the age of sixty-nine Frederic Winn Knight became the manager of the Cookley Iron and Tinplate Works, although he acknowledged that previously he had taken no interest in its management. He was educated at Charterhouse School ('c'.1823-1828) and at the age of twenty-nine took over the management of the Knight estates on Exmoor. Frederic Winn Knight married Maria Louisa Couling Gibbs in 1850 and they had one son. He was a man of great determination and almost boundless energy. In the same year that he took over the running of the Knight estates he was elected MP for West Worcestershire. Frederic Winn Knight represented the constituency for forty-four years and while an MP he was parliamentary secretary to the Poor Law Board in 1852 under Lord Derby's administration and again in 1858-9 under Lord Palmerston. His only commercial experience before the management of Cookley was gained as a director of the Bank of London and the National Provincial Insurance Association. Frederic Winn Knight was knighted in 1886 for public services as a member of parliament and a justice of the peace. He seems to have inherited the family trait of making bold decisions, for in 1886 he moved the iron business from Cookley to Brockmoor at Brierley Hill in the Black Country. He died at 19 Marlborough Buildings, Bath, on 3 May 1897. He was survived by his wife. The new works was operated by a new limited company with Knight involvement into the early years of the twentieth century. 
The Knights are a unique family within the story of the British iron industry. Although other midland families, such as the Foleys and the Darbys, had a long involvement in the iron trade, not one can match the activities of the Knights, which stretch from the seventeenth century to the twentieth.

Jonathan Walker (1710-1778), the eldest son of Joseph and Ann, was also born at Hollin House, Grenoside, on 8 July 1710. He became a partner in his brothers' ironworks on their move to Masbrough in 1746; he was in charge of transport and continued to manage the farms, in which 'he always evinced the greatest caution and prudence' (John, 14). He had a son and two daughters by his first wife, Sarah Platt, but no children by his second wife, Elizabeth Hodgkinson. He died at Grenoside on 5 August 1778 and was buried in Ecclesfield parish churchyard. 
The three brothers entered a partnership with John Booth, a nail chapman, and in 1748 built a cementation steel furnace at Masbrough. A similar furnace was erected at Grenoside in 1749-50. By 1787 the Walkers had five cementation steel furnaces at Masbrough, though the production of iron products remained their chief concern. The Masbrough site was expanded in 1753-6 by the purchase of adjacent property at the Yellands and in 1757-9 by leases of the Holmes estate. In 1766 they built their first crucible steel furnace, at Yellands. The business was boosted by government orders for cannon (some of which can still be seen in the city of Quebec), obtained through the patronage of the local landowner, Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham, when he was prime minister. The Walkers' business expanded rapidly and they became the leading ironmasters in the north, concentrating on cast and bar iron, as well as sheet, slit iron, tin plate, and many articles of wrought iron. Their fame spread when they built bridges at Yarm and Sunderland. The Southwark Bridge gave them a national reputation. 
In 1778 Samuel Walker, in partnership with Richard Fishwick and Archer Ward of Hull, began a white lead manufacturing business at Elswick, near Newcastle upon Tyne. Samuel Walker provided most of the capital, while his partners contributed business and practical expertise. Rising prices for lead encouraged many others to enter this trade about this time. Samuel died at Masbrough on 12 May 1782, and his four sons succeeded him as partners. They opened premises at London (1785), new works at Derby (1792) and Chester (1800), and a warehouse at Liverpool (1801-2). 
An obituary of Samuel Walker noted that he was 'of a thoughtful, serious disposition, and seldom indulged himself in levity or in any kind of dissipation' (John, vii). Samuel and Aaron were early converts to Methodism, and about 1758 led the Calvinistic split from the Rotherham Methodist meeting. They built a meeting-house at Masbrough in 1762 and (later) a family mausoleum. In 1795 Jonathan's son, also Jonathan, founded an Independent college at Masbrough to train students for the ministry; the college proved influential in the evangelical revival in the north. 
The next generation of Walkers continued to run the metal businesses, but were regarded as gentlemen. They served as justices of the peace and lived in grand new houses, some of which were designed by John Carr of York. Jonathan's son, Jonathan Walker (1756/7-1807), of Ferham House, Rotherham, JP, married his cousin Mary, Samuel's eldest daughter. The line ended with their son, Jonathan Walker of Ferham (1781-1842). Aaron's only son, John Walker, left the firm in 1783 and is thought to have died in Russia without issue. Samuel's four sons were Samuel (1742-1792), Joshua (1750-1815), Joseph (1752-1801), and Thomas (1756-1828). They married into families with similar industrial and nonconformist backgrounds; and Joseph Walker's second son married the daughter of Samuel Walker Parker, who in 1802 had been admitted into the lead partnership (which then became known as Walkers, Parker, & Co.). 
In 1833, after a period of uncertain trade and a quarrel among the partners, the Walkers' iron and steel partnership was dissolved. Some capital was invested in a Rotherham bank, but the family gradually moved away from south Yorkshire. The lead trade continued to prove far more lucrative. All the male descendants of the first Samuel Walker owned shares in the lead business and some were actively involved in the business, but most preferred to live as country gentlemen. Nevertheless, the firm's archives show members of the family being trained in metallurgy in Saxony in the 1850s and investigating new lead manufacturing processes in the USA in the 1870s. The managing partners at the firm's various works were still in the 1870s being drawn exclusively from the Walker family. The Walkers only finally withdrew from the lead trade in 1893 after a lengthy dispute between the partners. 
The Walkers are a classic example of a family of humble origins who rose rapidly in society through the ingenuity and hard work of the first generation and whose later members gradually withdrew from trade to live as landed gentry. Samuel, Aaron, and Jonathan Walker established an iron-founding business in the period when coke was replacing charcoal as fuel, and they soon diversified into the manufacture of both cementation steel and the new crucible steel. They rank alongside the firm established by Benjamin Huntsman in the transformation of the south Yorkshire heavy metal industries in the second half of the eighteenth century. Samuel, the gloomy genius who was mainly responsible for the firm's success, also established a successful lead business in north-eastern England. His numerous descendants became accepted as country gentry in various parts of the north and north midlands.

Samuel Walker (1715-1782) was born on 15 November 1715, also at Hollin House. The second son of Joseph and Ann, he became the master at Grenoside endowed school, but supplemented his living by land surveying and making sundials. On 18 March 1742 he married Mary (died 1793), the daughter of Thomas Sykes; they had four sons and three daughters. In the autumn of 1741 he and Aaron built an air furnace (a reverberatory furnace) in the nailer's smithy at the rear of Samuel's cottage in Grenoside. They were successful in remelting pig iron and scrap cast-iron, and in casting pots. In 1745, as the business expanded, Samuel resigned his teaching post, and the following year he and Aaron moved a few miles to Masbrough, alongside the newly navigable River Don at Rotherham, where they built a casting house.

At this time he worked on local farms, mowing hay and shearing sheep. He married Rhoda, the daughter of Bartholomew Wood, and they had a son and a daughter.

Mather, Leonard Charles (1909-1991), banker, was born on 10 October 1909 at Port Sunlight in Cheshire, the son of Richard and Elizabeth Mather. He was educated at Oldershaw School, Wallasey. After leaving school at the age of fifteen, he spent a year in a Liverpool shipping office before joining the staff of the Midland Bank branch at Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1926. In 1937 he married Muriel Armor Morris (died 1991). They had no children. 
Midland's Dale Street branch was part of a distinctive Liverpool tradition in banking, and Mather thrived on learning the special banking techniques which were needed in the city's cotton and shipping markets. There was even a time in the 1930s when he was tempted to move across to an appointment in the Booth Steamship Company. In 1937, however, he was promoted to a succession of appointments at the bank's headquarters at Poultry in London. Initially he was a branch superintendent's assistant -- an appointment at the centre of the branch network -- but during the war years he was the right-hand man of G. P. A. Lederer, chief general manager of the bank between 1943 and 1946. His duties included liaison with head office departments which had been evacuated from London, and he was also responsible for contacts with Whitehall departments. 
Between 1945 and 1948 he was manager of Midland's branch in Bolton -- an appointment which he later described as 'the most satisfying period of my career'. Decades later the Bolton office was still being described by customers as 'Mr Mather's branch' (Holmes and Green, 246). He returned to Poultry in 1948 as principal of the legal department and became an assistant general manager in 1950. Between 1954 and 1955, and again between 1956 and 1958, he was 'de facto' in charge of the Midland Bank Executor and Trustee Company. These duties in the trust company, although essential to the fortunes of the bank at that time, probably delayed Mather's journey to the most senior management posts. 
In 1958 Mather was promoted to become a joint general manager. He then joined the 'magic circle' of Midland's management committee, where his contemporaries included Howard Thackstone, Bernard Clarke, and Tony Hellmuth. He was promoted to become assistant chief general manager in 1964, and deputy chief general manager in 1966. In 1968, on Thackstone's retirement, he was appointed a director of the bank, the first occasion on which a new chief executive was given a seat on Midland's board. Mather's appointment to the most senior management position in the bank was not the clear run which it seemed, as Midland's chairman, Sir Archibald Forbes, regarded his chairmanship as a fully executive task. Consequently, for the next four years Mather, although he was perhaps the most experienced and best-qualified banker in the country, did not have the full command of strategy and management which he may have wished for. Nevertheless, in his new role he oversaw a revolution in Midland's management structure; the highly centralized systems of the previous seven or eight decades now made way for a new network of regional head offices. He was an inspirational chief, especially in his commitment to the branch network and the importance of local banking knowledge. Mather believed, 'based on long tradition, that a bank's success could be earned only by the services provided in its branches and the standing and influence of its men on the spot' (Holmes and Green, 246). 
Mather was also realistic about the bank's prospects and the need to simplify the branch structure. In 1969, along with the other clearing banks, the Midland fully disclosed its profits for the first time; and the figures revealed, to surprise inside and outside the bank, that Midland's profitability was below that of its main competitors. Shortly afterwards the introduction of the 'competition and credit control' regime in 1971 put the earnings of all the main clearing banks under severe pressure. It was a reflection of Mather's traditional banking skills that Midland was able to treble its profits between 1969 and 1973, without suffering from the property and overseas losses then being incurred by some of its competitors. 
Mather also made an important contribution to the development of the banking profession. He was well suited to a teaching role, as early in his career he had obtained not only the qualifications of the Institute of Bankers and the Chartered Institute of Secretaries but also an external BComm degree from the University of London. In the 1930s he taught banking law at the Liverpool College of Commerce; in the mid-1940s his views were an important factor in the Institute of Bankers' decision to upgrade the associateship examinations; and in the 1950s he produced a series of publications which became standard textbooks of modern banking practice. His books included 'Banker and Customer Relationship and the Accounts of Personal Customers' (1956), which was given the premier award of the Institute of Bankers. He was also in regular demand as a lecturer and speaker, and he delivered the Gilbart lectures at the University of London in 1957 and 1961, and the Ernest Sykes memorial lectures in 1966. 
These contributions led to his election to the council of the institute in 1961 and to the deputy chairmanship in 1967. He was a popular choice as president of the institute in 1969-70. In 1974 he was made an honorary fellow of the institute, at that time one of only fourteen honorary fellowships to have been awarded. His input to the literature of banking was also recognized by Loughborough University, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1978. Since the late 1960s he had been instrumental in setting up Loughborough's degree in banking and finance. 
Mather retired as Midland's chief general manager in 1972, but he remained on the board as vice-chairman until 1974 and as a director until 1984. In 1974, however, at the invitation of the Bank of England, he accepted the chairmanship of United Dominions Trust. This company, then the largest of the British finance houses, was being supported by the 'lifeboat' arrangements for companies affected by the secondary banking crisis of 1973-4. Mather's astute management of the business over the next few years was widely applauded in the City as a return to the basics of banking and finance. Under his chairmanship United Dominions' lifeboat borrowings were reduced from $500 million to under $100 million, and in 1981 the company, profitable once more, was sold to the Trustee Savings Bank. His contribution to this major rescue was recognized by a CBE in 1978 -- although there were many in the banking world who placed him even higher in their own estimates of achievement. 
Len Mather's ebullience, sense of fun, and frankness brought him affection and influence not only at Midland but throughout the banking community. A large and avuncular figure, he was a committed supporter of Midland's sports and social societies and he enjoyed golf and bridge with the same enthusiasm. Outside the bank, he served as captain and chairman (for two terms) of Wildernesse Golf Club, and he was a vice-president of the Society of Lancastrians in London. Len Mather died in hospital at Tunbridge Wells on 8 May 1991, and was survived by his wife (who died on 18 September 1991).

Geach, Charles (1808-1854), banker, was born on 1 May 1808 probably in St Austell, Cornwall, and baptized there on 4 September. He was the sixth child and second son of George Geach (1772-1850) and his wife, Grace, 'nee' Guichard (1776-1839). Little is known of his early years, but at fifteen he left school and became a clerk with a draper in St Austell. 
Geach's banking career began in 1826 when he was elected to a clerk's position at the Bank of England. This post was probably obtained through the influence of his maternal uncle, mayor of Penryn, Cornwall, and friend of the borough's MP, J. W. Freshfield, solicitor to the Bank of England. Another relative, an aunt, provided Geach with lodgings in Paddington. He made good progress in the bank and in 1828 he was chosen to go to Birmingham with Sir George Nicholls (1781-1865) to establish a branch of the bank there. Working his way through the ranks in the new Birmingham branch, he became second inspector in 1831. His progress did not match his personal ambitions, however, as he later complained of the reluctance of the directors to promote to a high level those who had joined the bank at its lower levels. During these years he nevertheless acquired a thorough knowledge of both banking practice and the Birmingham business community. Geach married, in 1832, Eliza Lucy Skally (1816-1876), the daughter of a schoolmaster in whose house he first lodged in Birmingham. 
In 1836 Geach advised a group of manufacturers in Birmingham on the establishment of a new joint-stock bank, the Birmingham Town and District Bank. Against expectations, he was not offered the managership of the new bank. A second group of businessmen then approached him to form another bank and this time he was promised, and obtained, the position of manager. The confidence that the promoters of the bank had in Geach must have been considerable: he was only twenty-eight, had never managed a bank before, and would be faced with stiff rivalry from the Bank of England and other banking institutions operating in Birmingham. In his favour, he had established a reputation for outstanding ability, industry, and 'singularly agreeable good manners' (Edwards, 130). 
The new Birmingham and Midland Bank (the Midland) opened for business in Union Street, Birmingham, on 22 August 1836. The first year was dominated by discussions with the Bank of England over the capital structure of Midland and about its relationship with the Bank. Geach shrewdly negotiated with his former masters to gain the best terms for Midland: in return for Midland circulating the Bank's notes rather than issuing its own, the Bank would give preferential rates. The decision to restructure the capital base of Midland in 1837 was a condition laid down by the Bank and was instrumental in its survival; many of Midland's contemporaries later collapsed due to inadequate capitalization. Midland's business was primarily of a commercial nature, especially the discounting of bills of exchange. Geach set strict rules as to the quality and security of bills that the bank would discount, and these measures prevented the young bank falling prey to bad debts. 
As well as overseeing the financial basis of the new bank, Geach was also called upon to protect the physical security of the bank building. In 1839 during Birmingham's Bull Ring riots it seemed likely that an advancing mob would attack the bank. Geach mounted his staff on the roof, armed with missiles, and himself rode through the mob to fetch support from the barracks. 
Geach's own business affairs were characterized by the same shrewdness and courage that had made Midland a success. In 1838 he led a group of Birmingham businessmen in purchasing the patents and works of an iron-axle manufacturer in Wednesbury. The company was reconstructed and in 1844 Geach bought out his partners. In the railway boom that followed the Patent Shaft and Axle Tree Company was transformed by the increase in demand from a small-scale operation to a large and thriving business. Similarly, in 1842 Geach bought the Parkgate Company, a failing iron manufacturing business in Rotherham. When iron prices were driven up two years later due to the demand for iron rails, the new company benefited. Geach was also an active promoter and director of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and of the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway. 
Geach was a Liberal, and his entry into politics coincided with the agitation for the repeal of the corn laws, with which he was heavily involved. He became an alderman of the Birmingham corporation in 1844 and mayor in 1847, his main contribution being an overhaul in the corporation's accounts and bookkeeping procedures. His civic duties forced him to resign as manager of Midland in 1847. Although relieved of responsibility for the day-to-day running of the bank, he joined the board as managing director, and thus retained an executive role. In 1851, following nomination by the National Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association, he was elected MP for Coventry. He seldom spoke in parliament, but was acknowledged as an authority on financial matters. On his election the family, including the six children, moved to Park Street, Westminster. However, Geach's parliamentary career was to be short-lived, as he died at home on 1 November 1854, after a short illness. The cause of death was stated to be a combination of chronic physical disorders, and the after-effects of a kick from a hansom cab horse. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.

Middleton, George (1692-1747), banker, was born in the summer of 1692, in Edinburgh, the fifth of the eighteen children of Dr George Middleton, principal of King's College, Aberdeen, and his wife, Janet Gordon of Seton, who died in 1753 at the age of 101. Young George was well educated, with access to his father's well-stocked college library. He served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith in Edinburgh and in 1703 joined John Campbell, a Scottish goldsmith banker in the Strand, London; in 1708 he became his partner. After Campbell's death on 15 November 1712 George married Campbell's daughter Mary (died 1764) -- a sweet, sprightly lady, appropriately nicknamed Honey. They had two daughters, Elizabeth (died 1746), who married in 1731 Patrick Craufurd MP, of Auchenames, and Margaret, who married in 1768 John Dalrymple, fifth earl of Stair. Elizabeth had two sons, James and John. 
Middleton was regarded with respect and affection by his family and a wide circle of friends. Campbell's was a whig bank under the patronage of the second duke of Argyll and his brother, Lord Ilay, later third duke. Most of George's friends were whigs and supporters of the Hanoverians. His eldest brother, Colonel John (1678-1739), became a general in Argyll's army, and friend of the most powerful men in Scotland. Yet some of his relatives were active Jacobites. His father's first cousin John, the second earl of Middleton (1650-1719), was an adviser to James II. He had been imprisoned as a Jacobite in 1693, escaped, and joined James II at his court in St Germain. He was involved in the failed Jacobite invasion in 1708. His sons were captured and imprisoned in the Tower, but the earl remained a loyal minister at the court at St Germain until his death. These relatives and other Jacobite friends caused the whig banker some embarrassment, but with tact and good humour he maintained friendly relations with all. 
Like many bankers at this period, Middleton undertook many different responsibilities: he was paymaster to the duke of Argyll's regiment of horse, to his brother John's regiment of foot, to the earl of Stair's dragoons, to the Royal regiment and 4th troop of Horse Guards. He also sometimes acted as an estate agent for his customers. His chief pride, however, was in his craft as a goldsmith, and he signed himself 'goldsmith banker'. John Campbell had left Middleton very much in charge at the end of his life, so it was he who was responsible for the making of ten gold collars of the Order of the Thistle for Queen Anne, between the years 1707 and 1709. In 1716 he sold a magnificent service of gilt to the prince of Wales, later George II. 
As a banker Middleton had the advantage of the patronage of the duke of Argyll and leading whigs; he was respected and trusted at home and abroad. But between 1719 and 1723, when the South Sea Bubble burst in England and the Mississippi adventure sponsored by John Law collapsed in France, he had to endure, as he wrote, 'a fiery trial' (Healey, 49). By nature cautious, nevertheless he was mesmerized by the financial success in France of his brilliant compatriot John Law, whose brother William, a banker in Paris, was an old friend. John Law had made a spectacular leap from international gambler to banker to the duke of Orleans, regent of France, in 1718. In December 1719 he was made controller of French finance: he was now 'King Law'. He had created, in 1717, the Compagnie d'Occident, which he hoped would rival the British East India Company. This Mississippi project aimed to create a French kingdom named Louisiana after the French king, which would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. By skilful manipulation Law encouraged a manic rush for shares. George Middleton, on William Law's advice, speculated. The shares and John Law's reputation collapsed as quickly as they had risen. By December 1720 Law's company was closed, and he escaped, but his brother William was imprisoned. Middleton was caught in their ruin. He had not only lost money on his own account, but he had also covered John Law on a speculative gamble on the future of the East India Company. When this failed and Law could not pay his debts, Middleton was obliged to stop payment. His 'shop' did not re-open until 5 September 1723. 
Middleton's troubles were compounded by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble in England. In 1711 the South Sea Company had been promoted by the earl of Oxford and the tory government to fund the national debt of $10 million, which had built up during the war with France. The ever-increasing value of its shares caused a rush to invest, when, as Middleton wrote, 'people were running madder every day' (Healey, 45). However, when the bubble burst, many were ruined; as Middleton put it to the duke of Argyll: 'Five goldsmiths broke in one day' (ibid., 49). Middleton was not himself deeply involved, but many of his customers were. Patiently he pursued his debtors until he was able, as he wrote, 'to begin the world anew' (ibid., 55). 
With the help of his influential Scottish friends, the duke of Argyll, Lord Ilay, and Lord Milton, Middleton rebuilt his business. They kept him informed of the negotiations for the foundation of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1727. Middleton in that year took in John Campbell's son George as a partner, and his own nephew David Bruce entered the partnership in 1740. In 1739 he moved into grander premises at 59 Strand. But years of stress had undermined his health. After a long illness he died at Bath on 17 January 1747. 
In 1755 George Campbell took in as partner James Coutts, son of the lord provost of Edinburgh, John Coutts, a director of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Coutts married Polly Peagrum, George Campbell's niece, in May 1755, and on Campbell's death inherited the bank. Thomas Coutts joined his brother on 1 January 1761. The bank founded by John Campbell in 1692 and revived by George Middleton was to become the prestigious Coutts & Co., which remained at 59 Strand.

Lane, Joseph (1851-1920), socialist campaigner, was born on 2 April 1851 in the Oxfordshire village of Benson (or Bensington), the son of Thomas Lane, a cordwainer, and Mercy Lane, 'nee' Warner, who was illiterate. Lane had virtually no education, and never managed to write grammatical English. He worked on the land from an early age, and soon took an interest in politics, supporting the campaign for land reform and taking part in the general election campaign of 1865. He moved to London, where he earned his living as a carter and spent his energy on politics. He married Isabella Adams on 5 September 1874, and had children, including several sons, but his family took no interest in his public life. He took part in the radical demonstrations of the mid-1860s, and joined the agrarian and republican movements. By the end of the 1870s he was taking a leading part in several radical organizations in central London -- the Manhood Suffrage League, the English section of the Social Democratic Club, the Marylebone Radical Association, and the Local Rights Association. He took part in the general election campaign of 1880, and then turned to more clearly revolutionary and socialist activity. 
In 1881 Lane moved to east London, where he was involved in producing the English 'Freiheit' in 1881 and 'The Radical' from 1881 to 1882. In 1881 he formed the Homerton Social Democratic Club, whose meetings were suppressed by the police in 1882; he represented it as a delegate at the International Revolutionary Congress in London in 1881 and as a signatory of a manifesto calling for the revival of the International Working Men's Association in 1883. In 1882 he helped to found the socialist Labour Emancipation League and became its secretary. He organized public meetings and working men's clubs all over east London, and produced a series of propaganda leaflets. In 1884 he led its merger with the radical Democratic Federation to form the socialist Social Democratic Federation, and joined the executive, where he made friends with William Morris and enemies with H. M. Hyndman. At the end of 1884 he joined the revolutionary majority in seceding and forming the Socialist League, signing the latter's founding documents and joining its council. He became the manager and joint publisher of its paper 'The Commonweal' in 1885, and was also an occasional contributor. 
Lane was a leading member of the anti-parliamentarian fraction in the disputes which immediately divided and eventually destroyed the Socialist League. In 1886 he was appointed to a subcommittee attempting to draft an acceptable policy statement; in 1887, when the majority report recommended parliamentary socialism, he produced a minority report reaffirming revolutionary socialism. When both reports were rejected by the annual conference in May 1887, he published his in June 1887 as a pamphlet entitled 'An Anti-Statist, Communist Manifesto', which became a standard text of extreme revolutionary and libertarian socialism short of anarchism. 
The internal disputes continued in the Socialist League, and in 1889 Lane quietly resigned, partly for private reasons (he was offended by personal slights) and partly for political reasons (he preferred William Morris's circle to the extreme anarchists). He took no further direct part in socialist activity, though he kept in touch with his old comrades and continued to collect and distribute radical literature. He published occasional leaflets from 1906 to 1912, returning to the campaign for land reform, opposing tariff reform, supporting the syndicalist movement, and attacking reformist socialists. He moved to Forest Gate, and worked for a furrier in the City until his sudden death at East Ham, Essex, on 3 September 1920. 
Lane was an earnest rather than eloquent speaker or writer, but he was an inspiring agitator and organizer. He was one of the central figures in the rise of revolutionary socialism in Britain during the 1880s, and author of its most convincing exposition produced by a native working-class writer. Unfortunately he left only manuscript notes for an autobiography. William Morris wrote to him when he left the Socialist League: 'I always looked upon you as one of the 'serious' members of the League' (Morris to Lane, 21 May 1889, 'The Collected Letters of William Morris', ed. N. Kelvin, 3, 1996, 68). And the anarchist historian Max Nettlau, who knew him in the Socialist League, wrote a decade after his death: 'I consider him to be the best head English socialism possessed in the years 1879 to 1889' (Nettlau, 3.349).

Campbell, Herbert (1844-1904), music-hall performer, was born on 22 December 1844 at 16 Hamilton Street, Kennington, Surrey, the son of Henry George Story, smith, and his wife, Hannah Fisher. Little is known of his early life beyond the agitation which resulted whenever Henry Story attended his firm's annual outing. This 'excellent husband and devoted father' would return full of gin and cockles and bash the furniture to bits with a poker, with Mrs Story yelling murder, the children screaming -- 'and household bread at a shilling a quartern' (Booth, 115). The domestic observation and philosophical tag-line reflected Campbell's comic style. 
Herbert Story started work as a messenger at 'The Sun', and made his first stage appearance at a teetotal hall in Clerkenwell, London, 'singing for ginger-beer and buns' (Thorn). He became a fan of Raynor's Original Christy Minstrels and, while working at a Woolwich gun factory, formed his own 'amateur nigger band' ('The Era', 22 Sept 1888). During the 1860s he became a professional 'bone corner' -- the bone-playing minstrel at the end of the row. After a disastrous booking in Oxford, Campbell (as he had now become) had to walk back to London. He later joined the minstrel performers Harmon and Elston but, finding his talents undervalued, abandoned burnt cork and gave his first solo performance at the Raglan Music-Hall, south London, at $3 a week. On 20 April 1867 he married Elizabeth Ann Mills (1848/9-1884), of Hoxton, London, and struggled to establish himself without a blacked-up face. Finally his cockney style caught on and in 1871 he made his first pantomime appearance in 'King Winter' at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool. He was re-engaged the following year, but soon became a favourite with London pantomime audiences at the Grecian Theatre, Shoreditch. 
In 1882 Augustus Harris (Druriolanus), the lessee of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, set Campbell on an uninterrupted run of pantomime success there that was to last until his death twenty-two years later. From 1889 he was joined every year by Dan Leno, and their partnership became the most celebrated in pantomime history. Its appeal owed much to their contrasting styles. Leno was small and whimsical with quicksilver movements, Campbell a 19 stone colossus with a voice like 'a powerful accordeon which some miracle-worker had got into tune' (Shaw). Beerbohm thought of Campbell as 'the offspring of some mystical union between beef and thunder' and took French visitors to see him 'as a liberal education in the character of this island' (Beerbohm). He often played a greedy boy or matron of a certain age, his enormous frame alternately filling blouse and breeches or an outsize frock. His only surviving film appearance shows him in the former guise guzzling a pudding, his broad features alight with gluttony. Campbell's accent was lustily cockney -- Shaw begged him to stop pronouncing 'slave' as 'slive' in 'Aladdin' (Shaw) -- and his humour was 'rich, broad and pleasantly devoid of subtlety', but he had an 'extraordinary capacity for thinking out new moves for the nose, lips and eyes to portray all the human emotions without uttering a word' ('The Era', 23 July 1904). Some critics felt music-hall was corrupting pantomime but the public regarded the Drury Lane spectaculars as the pinnacle of Christmas entertainment (even when the two stars took a few nights to polish their improvisations). 
In his solo career Campbell bridged the old order and the new, having seen the halls with their presiding chairmen give way to palatial variety houses. True to the earlier style, he based his act on comic songs; only Marie Lloyd had more in her repertoire (Kilgarriff, 140-42). On the four records Campbell made late in life he is the cockney John Bull, but he showed his satirical streak in a parody of the song 'We don't want to fight' (which gave 'jingoism' to the language). In place of the bellicose original he declared he would 'let the Russians have Constantinople'. In 'The Great McNoodle' he lampooned Sir John McDougall, a London county councillor who opposed music-hall, while the song 'In my fust 'usband's time' mocked the aesthetic movement: '
For we didn't think an old cracked pot intense, 

Nor an old blue plate sublime. 

' Popular sentiment came in for caustic treatment when he turned 'The Miner's Dream of Home' into a family horror-story: '
My pa was boozing nightly, 

And my mother was shifting the gin, 

And the lodger was taking the old girl out, 

And the old man in. 

' Campbell's own domestic arrangements were unconventional. Mrs Campbell having died in 1884, he lived as man and wife with an actress who had been Rose Wiltshire ('c'.1858-1891). After her death a third 'Mrs Campbell', in reality (Ellen) Maud Bartram, a licensee, became his companion until he died. Campbell was president of the Music Hall Sick Fund, vice-president of the Music Hall Artistes' Railway Association, and a freemason. In 1898 he, Leno, and two fellow comedians built the Granville Theatre, in Fulham. At the opening Campbell said that when he should go off 'to Peckham Rye' (die) there would now be something to keep his memory green (Read, 225). The quartet ran three other halls but lost money against stiff competition from bigger proprietors. Fond of company, Campbell always referred to his favoured glass of whisky as 'a cup of tea' (Randle, 178). By 1904 he was considering retirement when, after another triumph in 'Humpty-Dumpty', he and Leno died within months of each other. Campbell's stentorian tones were the indirect cause of his death. As he alighted from his brougham, his instructions to the coachman startled the horse, which reared and knocked him over. A bruised leg became ulcerous, causing septicaemia, and he died on 19 July from a brain haemorrhage, at 28 Quadrant Road, Islington. He was fifty-nine. At his funeral three days later the route to Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, was lined by so many mourners that traffic had to be diverted. 'Much we marvelled at him,' wrote Beerbohm, 'yet marvelling, much loved him' (Beerbohm). The irregular home life became public when his 'will' was contested in 1905. Claiming that Campbell had signed the original in the billiard-room of the Royal Music-Hall, Holborn, and then lost it, a commission agent produced a draft leaving the assets ($4477) to Maud Bartram and her niece. Campbell's relatives disputed the story, but the judge ruled that he would not have left his companion unprovided for.

Glyde, John (1823-1905), social commentator and antiquary, was born at 9 Eagle Street, Ipswich, in December 1823, the second son of John Glide (1800/01-1880), a hairdresser, and his wife, Mary (1793/4-1844). Glide first worked in his father's shop, and entertained the customers by retailing the contents of the newspapers, of which he was an avid reader. At fifteen he joined the Ipswich Mechanics' Institute, and at eighteen won a prize for an essay on social conditions in Ipswich. In 1843 he spent a year in London, and on his return opened a hairdresser's shop at 35 St Matthew's Street, Ipswich, changing the spelling of his name to Glyde. He was still described as a hairdresser in White's 'Directory of Suffolk' in 1855, though by that time he had largely abandoned the trade in favour of a bookshop, a circulating library, and a domestic agency. He was also a busy author. 
In the intervening years Glyde had been active in radical politics. He was the secretary and a pamphleteer of an Owenite group in 1841, and corresponded with John Goodwyn Barmby, the Christian socialist. He was then close to the Ipswich Chartists, and joined their Utilitarian Society when he returned from London in 1844, but he was a Unitarian, and had attended William Johnson Fox's chapel in Finsbury. By the end of the decade he had become a moderate Liberal, critical of Chartist beliefs and concerning himself increasingly with practical social reform. At the same time he was expanding his prize-winning essay into an enterprising study, which he published in 1850 as 'The Moral, Social, and Religious Condition of Ipswich in the Middle of the Nineteenth Century'. 
The work opens conventionally with a historical sketch, but then turns to discuss the contemporary town. An account of trade is followed by chapters on sanitary conditions, poverty, education, intellectual life, and religious observance. As far as he could Glyde illuminated local and national statistics with his own careful observation. His object was to record, but with a didactic purpose. He hoped for social and economic amelioration through education, but also through improvements in the physical environment. He reprobated drunkenness and the ill effects of sensational literature, but he saw crime as a product of social dislocation, and the spread of literacy as a desirable end in itself. At large he combined precept with practical action, campaigning for improvements in the water supply, for the closure of the town's churchyards for further burials and the establishment of a cemetery, and for the effective direction of philanthropic work. In 1866 he promoted a district nursing association, which foundered on sectarianism, and in 1868 worked for Foster Barham Zincke's National Educational League. 
In examining the churches and their congregations Glyde anticipated the inquiries into religious observance in the census of 1851. In the following years he expanded his book into a general survey of the county, published in 1856 as 'Suffolk in the Nineteenth Century: Physical, Social, Moral, Religious, and Industrial'. That work was said to have prompted the registrar-general to appoint him registrar of marriages in Ipswich, a post which he held until his death. His local standing was also enhanced by a series of studies of the clergy, entitled 'The Ipswich pulpit', which appeared in the 'Suffolk Chronicle' in 1857, and were followed by a larger biographical collection published as 'Suffolk Worthies' in 1858. Glyde's later works included 'The Autobiography of a Suffolk Labourer' (1894), a sympathetic composite portrait compiled from a wide range of material, and antiquarian and literary studies. In 1897 he argued that the best memorial to Queen Victoria's jubilee would be a free public library, and subsequently left a bequest of $500 to buy books for the reference collection. 
Glyde was twice married; first, on 4 March 1849, to Eliza Taylor ('b'. 'c'.1829), daughter of Robert Taylor, a builder, and the second time, in or about 1860, to Mary ('b'. 'c'.1840), a stationer's assistant (her surname is unknown), who outlived him. Both marriages seem to have been childless. He died on 14 June 1905 at his home, 22 St Nicholas Street, Ipswich, and was buried in Ipswich cemetery on 17 June. 
Glyde invites comparison with the Colchester radical William Wire (died 1857). Both had little schooling, but both developed distinctive intellectual tastes. Wire made an important contribution to archaeological studies in Essex, but laboured under a heavier burden of social disapproval than Glyde. Glyde, longer-lived, equally pertinacious but more adroit, gained social esteem in a no less conservative town, and promoted some useful changes. The originality of his interests may have helped him; they still stand to his credit.

Marsden, Richard (1802/3-1858), weaver and Chartist, was born in humble circumstances in or near Manchester in 1802 or 1803. Nothing is known about his early life, but he was a hand-loom weaver by trade. He left Manchester in search of work during the slump of 1829 and settled with his family in the weaving township of Bamber Bridge, near Preston. Marsden became the most prominent representative of the Preston Chartists, and played a significant role in the national movement for democratic reform in the late 1830s and 1840s. He was secretary of the Preston committee which submitted evidence to the royal commission on hand-loom weavers, and was the principal witness before Commissioner Muggeridge during the latter's visit to Preston in May 1838. He chaired the first Chartist demonstration in the town in November of that year, when he introduced Feargus O'Connor to a large and enthusiastic audience. After making a fiery speech supporting the 'Charter', Marsden was elected to represent north Lancashire at the national convention in London. He was a consistent and unyielding advocate of 'ulterior measures', urging the need to prepare direct action for the day when the Chartist petition would be rejected by parliament. During the spring of 1839 Marsden travelled as an official 'missionary' for the convention in Sussex and the Welsh borders, toured Ireland on his own initiative, and made a speaking tour of north Lancashire, continually asserting the people's right to armed self-defence. 
Although he became known nationally as a spokesman for 'physical force' Chartism, Marsden seems to have believed that its use would never be necessary. In August 1839 he returned to Preston for the unsuccessful general strike in support of the 'Charter', vanishing almost immediately to avoid arrest on a warrant relating to a violent speech he had made in Newcastle earlier in the month. Marsden was in Bradford during the abortive Chartist rising in January 1840 and then moved to Bolton, where he lived under an assumed name and worked at his trade. Arrested there in July, he was soon released, and eventually returned to Preston as a full-time itinerant lecturer for the Chartists. He was again arrested in a confrontation between strikers and the military just outside Preston in August 1842, but this time no charges were laid against him. In the mid-1840s he rarely left Preston, but remained an active Chartist and exerted a wider influence through a series of letters to the 'Northern Star'. 
Unlike many more prominent national figures, Marsden became less liberal and more vigorously anti-capitalist after 1839, coming increasingly to stress that Chartism was a class movement aiming at the emancipation of working people and opposed to all middle-class involvement. He took an active part in the Ten Hours movement, in the campaign of 1844 against proposed changes to the master and servant laws, and in promoting trade unionism in the cotton mills. At the end of 1845 he was appointed secretary of the newly established Preston Powerloom Weavers' Union, and in 1847 moved to Blackburn to take charge of the weavers' union there. Chosen again to represent north Lancashire at the Chartist national convention of 1848, Marsden was sent out once more as a missionary to the north-east and the midlands. His speeches were now subdued and pessimistic, in keeping with the dismal prospects for the Chartist movement as a whole. With its virtually complete collapse in north Lancashire after April 1848, Marsden's withdrawal from political life was immediate and almost total. There is no further record of his presence at public meetings, and his flow of letters to the local press ceased. Unlike many old Chartists, Marsden played no part in the great Preston strike of 1853-4. He died in obscurity, from chronic bronchitis, at 16 Club Street, Bamber Bridge, on 28 January 1858; he was fifty-five. Nothing is known of his private life; the mark of Jane Moss, who was present at his death, is on his death certificate.

Bennett, Sarah (1797-1861), governess, was born at Spalding, Lincolnshire, on 4 March 1797; her mother was the daughter of a tradesman, her father an architect and builder. Her father died aged thirty-eight, leaving a family of eight children and a ruined business. Sarah, the eldest daughter, was seven at the time of her father's death, and was sent by her godfather, a solicitor at Spalding, to his sister's school at Camden House, Kensington, London, to be educated as a governess, then the main respectable occupation for impoverished ladies. She worked for a number of wealthy families, and seemed to be establishing a stable career. In 1817, however, her former Camden House teachers moved to Spalding and invited Sarah to assist them in running their new school, which she dutifully did for eight years, until the school closed. She then returned to work in private families, entering on her last and longest engagement in 1827 with the daughters of a general. When her situation concluded in 1837, she moved to Melton Mowbray, where much of her family lived, to open a private school, for day and boarding scholars, with a friend, Miss Baldwin. 
Sarah Bennett's stress in education was on religious instruction -- hence the title of the memoir published in 1862 after her death, 'The Christian Governess'. While not against an education in the social graces, she refused to include dancing, which she dismissed as 'ungodly', in her curriculum, publishing a short pamphlet, 'Worldly Amusements' (which can be found in the appendix of the 1862 memoir), explaining her objections. She believed that dancing encouraged vanity and frivolity and discouraged domesticity among young girls, and that it was particularly injurious for the lower orders. Her educational methods, however, were not severe: instead she stressed love, example, firmness, careful attention to religious duties, and punctuality. She tried to enliven lessons by means of anecdote, and to cater for different levels of ability. She also encouraged her elder pupils to engage in charitable work, as she did, in visiting the poor. An Anglican with strong evangelical convictions, she raised funds for a school in Larne, co. Antrim, where protestants and Catholics were educated together, in the hope of ridding Ireland of 'Popery' (Bennett, 94), and she sought to convert Jews (through the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews and the London Philojudaean Society). She was also a supporter of the temperance movement, publishing a pamphlet, 'The Snare: its Danger' (apparently in the late 1830s, and included as an appendix to the 1862 memoir). When she retired in 1852, with hearing and sight impaired, the school closed. She spent much time visiting former pupils as well as family, and continued her charitable activities, including work with blind people for which she learned to read with Moon's embossed characters. Moon type (based on the Latin alphabet, invented in 1845 by William Moon of Brighton) was especially useful for older, newly blind people for whom Braille was too difficult to feel, and proved beneficial as her own sight deteriorated. 
Sarah Bennett exemplified Hannah More's (1745-1833) ideal of the dutiful and virtuous middle-class single woman, timid and yet resolute in her faith, always busy, a dedicated philanthropist of the poor and teacher of young ladies, for whom the appearance of being learned was anathema. Her letters (a selection of which are included in the 1862 memoir) give only vague hints of the difficulties encountered by governesses in fitting into a new family. The extent of her correspondence to former pupils, family, and missionaries (profits from the memoir were dedicated to the Church Missionary Society) gives an indication of the esteem in which she was held, especially as a role model for young ladies in similar straitened circumstances. Her memoirist, her nephew the Revd George Bright Bennett (1830-1890), records that after a full working life dedicated to serving others, Sarah Bennett had accumulated only enough to ensure a small annual income, which may explain her itinerant life, staying with friends and family, once the school closed. She died at Nuneaton on 12 March 1861 in the home of a former pupil, and was buried in Birmingham's Anglican cemetery, in her brother's family vault.

Cooke, Sophia (1814-1895), missionary and schoolmistress, was born in the Norfolk village of Hilborough, on 27 February 1814, attended school in Bury St Edmunds, and was a governess in Suffolk for twenty years before leaving England in March 1853 to become superintendent of the Chinese Girls' School in Singapore as agent for the Society for Promoting Female Education in the East. Tall, blonde, blue-eyed, with a lively sense of humour, she was immediately welcomed into the expatriate British community, but felt her main mission was among Asians. The only other protestant missionary in Singapore at that time was a self-supporting independent, Benjamin Keasberry, who worked among the Malays. 
In 1856 Sophia Cooke (a lifelong Anglican) persuaded the Anglican chaplain to begin mission work among the Chinese and invited a presbyterian Chinese catechist from Amoy (Xiamen) to conduct Singapore's first Chinese-language services in her school compound. Providing a sound general education, along with Christian teaching and practical housewifery skills, the Chinese Girls' School was also a refuge for orphans and adolescents rescued from prostitution. Many school leavers went on to spread the Christian message and minister to the poor and sick in Singapore, China, and as far afield as Korea. Except for her own salary Sophia Cooke had to raise all the funds for the school and for outside charity work. Much came from bazaars of handwork provided by well wishers in Britain, with whom Sophia Cooke kept up an indefatigable correspondence, while expatriate Singapore businessmen gave willingly to her good causes. 
The school was the most important of many charitable works. Sophia Cooke organized regular 'Bible' classes for Chinese women, policemen, soldiers, and others, and each week she devoted one day to visiting Asian wards in the general and military hospitals. In 1865 she established the first of two 'ragged schools' for indigent mothers and children, and ten years later she started the YWCA in Singapore on an informal basis. In 1882 she opened the Sailors' Rest near the docks; this offered cheerful surroundings, cheap beds, and food, as well as 'Bible' classes which she conducted herself, winning many converts. 
Initially enjoying excellent health, it was nearly ten years before Sophia Cooke took her first home leave, but in 1869 she became seriously ill and subsequently had to spend extended periods of sick leave in England. Defying acute rheumatism and failing sight, she continued to work a six-day week, holding 'Bible' readings and visiting the sick. Too frail to climb the stairs to Chinese tenements, she was carried upstairs by police constables. 
After being confined to bed for just a fortnight, Sophia Cooke died of erysipelas in Singapore on 14 September 1895 and was buried the same day. With policemen as pall bearers, the funeral was attended by many soldiers, sailors, and Chinese families, in addition to leading officials and clergy of all denominations. The following Sunday a memorial service was held in St Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore. 
Sophia Cooke was a capable, practical missionary, admired and respected alike by pupils, policemen, sailors, soldiers, officials, and business people, and encouraging all Christians to work together for the welfare of others.

Daniell, Louisa (1808/9-1871), philanthropist, was orphaned soon after her birth. She married Captain Frederic Daniell of the 18th Madras native infantry; they had two children before he died at Kotagiri on 3 April 1837. On returning to England she lived primarily in the midlands, educating her son, Frederick William, at Rugby School. Her daughter, 
Through this work Louisa Daniell came in contact with the County Towns Mission Society, the secretary of which, a Mr Wilson, urged her to direct her missionary zeal towards Aldershot. By the early 1860s Aldershot had a garrison of nearly 15,000 soldiers. These soldiers had few recreational facilities other than eighteen canteens on site and the twenty-five public houses and forty-seven beer houses that had been built around the camp, many of which were public brothels (approximately one-third of the soldiers were hospitalized each year with sexually transmitted diseases). Aldershot, argued Mrs Daniell, was 'one of Satan's strongholds' (Daniell, 26) -- a camp and town desperately in need of spiritual uplift. The Wesleyan Methodist Charles Henry Kelly had already opened the first soldiers' home in a small basement club-house in Chatham in 1861, but Mrs Daniell had access to more substantial funding. Supported by some of the great evangelical philanthropists -- the third earl of Shaftesbury, Lord Kinnaird, Stevenson Blackwood, and Robert Baxter -- she opened her first soldiers' home in October 1862. Baxter, Lord Radstock, and Captain E. Gardner Fishbourne RN, shared the weekly services and joined the trustees who had agreed to back the foundation of her more permanent Mission Hall and Soldiers' Home and Institute. Begun on 11 February 1863, the hall was officially opened on 11 October 1863. It eventually had a lecture hall seating up to 500 for services, a tea and coffee bar, a smoking and games room, a reading room with newspapers, and a lending library, as well as a classroom capable of holding 150 people, and several bedrooms. 
Mrs Daniell and her daughter, Georgiana, who continued her work, regarded their task as primarily a spiritual one. Every evening, save for the weekly temperance meeting, they organized hymn singing and scripture talks in the classroom, with Sunday evening services in the hall. They also founded a mothers' meeting, a women's missionary working party, and a Band of Hope for service children. Yet their activities had a greater social impact at a time when the state (as distinct from some individual regiments) provided relatively few recreational and educational facilities for the rank and file. For those soldiers who were undeterred by the evangelical piety and by the strict prohibition of alcohol, the homes provided respectable meeting places and centres where they could repair deficiencies in their education. For soldiers' and pensioners' wives, the sewing classes taught them a skill from which they could earn as much as 3 to 4's'. a week by the late 1870s, while the weekly savings club enabled them to put money aside for clothes, shoes, bedding, and coals. Women married 'off the strength' (and so denied free quarters) received charity and visits from the 'Bible' women of the Aldershot Mission Hall Soldiers' Wife Aid Society, founded a few years before Mrs Daniell's death. 
Both Louisa and Georgiana Daniell were convinced that these activities contributed to improving standards of behaviour within the army. In this respect, they invested great hopes in the Total Abstinence Society, established soon after the opening of the hall in 1863. Within a year the society had 500 members and, although many lapsed either temporarily or permanently, it continued to hold regular meetings, monitored its numbers on a weekly basis, and later awarded medals for those who kept their pledge. If these endeavours hardly transformed morals within the army as a whole (for many men were driven away by the proselytizing and the temperance regime), they may have contributed to the improving standards of behaviour within the army in the later nineteenth century. 
After Mrs Daniell died from breast cancer in Great Malvern on 16 September 1871 Georgiana continued her work, opening homes at Chatham, Weedon, London, Colchester, Manchester, Windsor, and Plymouth. For another twenty-two years she laboured on behalf of ordinary soldiers, and their wives and children, and also promoted foreign missionary activities. She earned the sobriquet the Soldiers' Friend, and her initiatives were replicated in Ireland by Elsie Sandes, who opened the first soldiers' home at Tralee in 1877, and by some churches. The state moved in a similar direction, building barracks towards the end of the century with many more recreational facilities for the other ranks. Georgiana Daniell died unmarried in the Mission Hall and Soldiers' Home, Aldershot, after a protracted illness brought on by influenza, on 24 June 1894. On 29 June her coffin was carried on a gun carriage for burial in the military cemetery at Aldershot, at which her mother's remains had earlier been interred on 26 September 1871.

Edward, Catherine (1813-1861), missionary, was born on 2 April 1813, eldest daughter of Patrick Grant (1783-1816), minister of Kirkmichael, Banffshire, and his wife, Isabella Mitchell (died 1845). After her father's death Catherine was brought up in Edinburgh, where her mother supplemented her annuity by taking in boarders. As a young woman she was a governess in the family of Principal Nicoll of St Andrews, where she remained for eight years, and later for Lord William Douglas. She was with his family in Germany when the Disruption of 1843 took place. At the end of that year she went to live with her brother William, a Free Church of Scotland minister, in Ayr. 
In 1845 Catherine and William were visited by Daniel Edward (1815-1896), a Free Church missionary who had worked among the Jews of Jassy in Moldavia since 1841. Daniel knew William Grant from their college days, renewed the acquaintance, and thus met Catherine. She shared his enthusiasm for Jewish missions and they were soon engaged. He returned to Jassy that autumn and she later went out to Germany, where they married on 25 August 1846, before going on to Moldavia. The homogeneity of the Jewish community in Jassy made the missionaries' task difficult; the few converts were generally a source of disappointment. By 1848 the mission's difficulties were compounded by the threat of war and the reality of cholera. This allowed a decent withdrawal to a new field of labour, Lemberg (Lwow) in Galicia, where the society and the surroundings were more congenial. However, it still proved impossible to establish the mission on a proper footing and in January 1852 the Austrian authorities expelled the missionaries. By this time Catherine was pregnant with the fourth of her five children and the winter journey to Breslau in Silesia proved arduous. A son was born there in March, but he did not survive and she later referred to him as her 'martyr boy'. Although the Edwards resumed their missionary work at Breslau, Catherine's part in it was reduced. On a visit to Scotland in 1852 she was described as 'so changed in appearance as... to look more like her mother than herself' ('Missionary Life', 247); her voice had weakened and her health continued to deteriorate until her death on 21 February 1861 at Breslau (where she was also buried). 
Catherine's 'Memoir' contains ample evidence of the strength of her commitment to mission work but her distaste for Jews also emerges, those in Moldavia being described as 'an indolent, idle population, which is likewise detested for its cunning, fraud and filth' ('Missionary Life', 142). The disappointments and rigours of Jassy and Lemberg (Lwow), endured during years of child bearing, took a heavy toll on her. Her later life, despite poor health, was at least accompanied by a more tolerant attitude of mind.

Kennedy, Margaret Stephen (1814-1891), missionary in India, was born in Aberdeen on 18 January 1814, the youngest of at least four daughters of John Walker ('c'.1780- 'c'.1860), a prosperous businessman whose enterprises failed in the 1830s, making it necessary for Margaret to support herself as a teacher. Fortunately she had been sent to one of the best girls' schools in Aberdeen, and had become a voracious reader and competent bookkeeper. An elder of his church, Walker dominated his family and was the principal influence on his daughter, together with Mr Aitken, minister of the Old Secession Church of Anti-Burghers, Aberdeen (later united with the Free Church of Scotland). However, she rejected the former's strict sabbatarianism and dour dutiful approach to religion. This was because she experienced, according to an autobiographical fragment left to her children, and quoted extensively in her husband's memoir of her (1892), a direct revelation, 'as if the sun had burst out in the darkness of midnight' (Kennedy, 'Memoir', 8). Faith was sheer joy and peace, despite great anguish and suffering in India, and the deaths before the age of five of three among her seven children. She loved singing hymns, and made Sunday observance enjoyable for her family. She rejected the strict Calvinist opposition to missions. 
Margaret Walker went to India and joined her sister Eliza Ann (died 1857) and her brother-in-law, the controversial Scottish London Missionary Society (LMS) missionary William Buyers (1804-1865), until 1840, when ill health forced them to leave their work in Benares, but then she married a Scottish LMS colleague, the Revd James Kennedy (1815-1899) from near Aberdeen and she stayed on as an LMS missionary. While always upholding the Westminster confession (1648) and strict evangelical principles, Margaret Kennedy became increasingly ecumenically minded in India. She also initiated work among women. Ill health forced her to go to the Kumaon hills in 1848, where from 1869 to 1877 she and her husband were involved in pioneering work developing the hill station of Ranikhet, building a church and schools and comforting lepers. She had to return to Scotland in the years 1850-53, 1857-9 (after harrowing experiences in the Indian mutiny in which her sister and many friends died), 1862-5, and 1874, when she devoted herself to her children and parish work. Always opposed to women speaking in public, she did no deputation work even though her husband wished her to preach, but conducted women's meetings in Benares and Ranikhet, ran superb Sunday schools, and did much pastoral work as she spoke fluent Hindustani and Hindi. She superintended the LMS orphanage in Benares and organized girls' schools whenever possible, but prejudice against female education made this difficult. Although not medically trained, her ministrations to the constant stream of Indian sufferers were much appreciated. Her effectiveness as an evangelist was indirect, through her friendships with members of different races and classes, even a Coorgi princess. The quality of her life distinguished her -- her cheerfulness, patience, and attempts to walk closely with God -- rather than the creation of enduring institutions. 
In 1877 the Kennedys returned to Scotland. James Kennedy was a Congregationalist minister at Portobello, near Edinburgh, from 1878 to 1882, then retired to Acton, Middlesex. Margaret Kennedy exhausted herself helping others in the extreme winter conditions of 1890-91. Smitten by bronchitis, on 23 May 1891 she died in Acton surrounded by her family. She was buried in Hampstead, London, on 27 May.

Mackenzie, Charles Frederick (1825-1862), bishop of central Africa, born at Harcus Cottage, Portmore, Peeblesshire, on 10 April 1825, was youngest child of Colin Mackenzie (died 1830) of Portmore, a clerk of session, an Episcopalian, and one of Scott's friends and colleagues. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Forbes, sixth baronet (1739-1806), of Pitsligo. William Forbes Mackenzie (1807-1862) was his brother. After his father's death in 1830 he was brought up by his eldest sister, Elizabeth, attending first a private school and then Edinburgh Academy and, from 1840, the Grange School, Bishopwearmouth, near Sunderland, where he revealed a talent for mathematics. He went into residence as a pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1844, but, finding that he would as a Scot be disqualified from holding a fellowship there, moved the next May to Gonville and Caius College. He read diligently, and in January 1848 was placed second wrangler in the mathematical tripos, Isaac Todhunter being senior. He graduated BA in 1848 and MA in 1851. From 1848 to 1862 he was fellow of and became a tutor there. Tall, well made, and muscular, he delighted in athletic exercise, was an oarsman and cricketer, and rowed and played cricket with the undergraduates of the college after his election as fellow. In May 1848 he was appointed one of the secretaries to the Cambridge board of education, and held that office until 1855. He was ordained deacon on Trinity Sunday 1851, and from October 1851 to 1854 was curate at Haslingfield, Cambridgeshire, while continuing his college work. In 1852 he was an examiner for mathematical honours, and was moderator in 1853-4, publishing in 1854 with William Walton 'Solutions of the Problems and Riders Proposed in the Senate-House Examination for 1854'. 
Although anxious to become a missionary Mackenzie yielded to friends' advice, and in 1853 refused an invitation to join the Delhi mission, but in December 1854 accepted the offer of John William Colenso, bishop of Natal, to take him to Natal as his archdeacon. Accompanied by his elder sister Anne he embarked with Colenso on 7 March 1855. For about a year and a half he acted as parish priest to the English settlers at Durban, meeting strong opposition from his congregation, who disapproved of his use of the surplice -- 'preaching in a surplice appeared to some to be only Popery in disguise' (Goodwin, 124) -- and other changes made in accordance with Colenso's wish. An opposition service was started, conducted by a layman. His sister Alice joined him in 1857, and after taking part in the Umlazi mission he was established at a post on the Umhlali River about 40 miles north of Durban, where he worked hard ministering to the scattered English settlers, the soldiers quartered in the neighbourhood, and a small congregation of Africans. He was appointed salaried chaplain to the troops in 1858. In the church conference held at Pietermaritzburg in April he advocated the right of black congregations to an equal voice with white congregations in the proposed church synod, and being defeated retired from the conference. After a severe attack of illness he returned to England in the summer of 1859. In November after David Livingstone's appeal in speeches at Oxford and Cambridge universities, he accepted the invitation of the delegates of the new Universities' Mission to central Africa to be head of their mission. The upper house of convocation having in June 1860 approved the appointment of missionary bishops, and desiring that Mackenzie be ordained bishop by the bishop of Cape Town and his comprovincials, he sailed from England -- with a presentiment that he would never return -- on 6 October, arriving at the Cape on 12 November, and was consecrated bishop of central Africa in Cape Town Cathedral on 1 January 1861. 
After a visit to Natal Mackenzie met Livingstone at Kongoni, and was persuaded by him to ascend the Rovuma, in an attempt to reach the Shire district without passing through territory claimed by the Portuguese. The river proved unnavigable and he finally ascended the Zambezi and Shire rivers. Marching into the Shire highlands under Livingstone's conduct, they encountered a party of eighty-four slaves, mainly women and children, being driven for sale in the Zambezi valley. On Livingstone's initiative the group was liberated and presented to the bishop as his first congregation. This intervention, followed by others which over the next few days brought the number under his protection to 177, determined in two ways all else that befell the mission. First, in a region torn by wars generated by the Indian Ocean slave trade, it committed Mackenzie to use force in defence of his clients. No sooner had their party been settled by Livingstone at Magomero, they were persuaded by a council of Mangania chiefs and headmen to protect Mangania territory from incursions by Yao slavers. After binding the chiefs not to enslave any captives they might make, and to discourage slavery, Mackenzie and his party joined in the war. Their help enabled their allies to win two victories which added more refugees to their settlement. 
The second consequence of such a beginning was that Mackenzie and his party were themselves widely believed to be slavers. The bishop interpreted the wars as 'tribal' and understood his own actions as giving support to the secular authority of his diocese. In practice, the whole region had passed under the control of warlords, who fought with each other irrespective of 'tribe', and whom the missionaries by seizing clients and building a stockade appeared to be imitating. Their numbers dropped as their people, fearing to be sold as slaves, abandoned Magomero. In December, when three of his party were exploring a shorter route to the Shire, they were attacked under the impression that they were slavers at the village of Mangasanja and two men and some goods seized. Mackenzie engaged the help of the Makololo people, and set out on 23 October 1861 to punish those he believed to be the aggressors, burnt Mangasanja, and recovered the missing men. He then had to hasten to the confluence of the Ruo and the Shire, where Livingstone had arranged to meet him with stores on 1 January 1862. On their way he and his companion, an ordained missionary, lost their medicines by the upsetting of a boat, and Mackenzie pushed on without them. He arrived too late to meet Livingstone, and died at Malo Island of a fever on 31 January. He was buried on Malo Island. In January 1863 Livingstone visited Mackenzie's grave and erected a cross over it. A fund raised in Mackenzie's memory was applied to the establishment in 1870 of the see of Zululand. 
Mackenzie was nearly 6 feet in height, with a pleasant expression, rather small eyes, and a forehead which, naturally large, appeared larger owing to early baldness. In manner he was winning and gentle, unselfish, and full of vigour. The controversies which drove him from Natal anticipated many of the conflicts between visiting missionaries and the settler church which have dogged Anglicanism in South Africa until recently. In the Shire highlands, his actions show him to have been profoundly innocent of the problems of the region and the complexities of his position. 
Charles Mackenzie's elder sister Anne Mackenzie (1813/14-1877) for several years accompanied him, and 'her life entwined itself around his work' (Awdry, 3). Born presumably in Edinburgh or at Harcus Cottage, Portmore, Peeblesshire, she was educated at home and 'attended classes'. An invalid, 'always ailing, often very ill... there seemed no special niche in life for her' (Awdry, 33). After her mother's death she lived mainly in lodgings, sometimes in Edinburgh, sometimes at the seaside, with her maid. 
In 1854, advised for her health to live in a milder climate, Anne Mackenzie accepted her brother Charles's invitation to accompany him to Natal. She was never a professed missionary, and was initially unenthusiastic about missionary work and did not consider being a missionary 'as quite a gentleman's profession' (Awdry, 35). A conventional middle-aged spinster -- at forty-two reportedly one of the oldest European women in the colony -- she found colonial life difficult. White ants destroyed property, Africans put rancid grease on their skins, and 'the Kafir smell, as she calls it, made her sick, or faint' (ibid., 64), and African girls were 'sad romps, knowing nothing of the duty of modesty' (ibid., 56). Nevertheless she kept house for her brother, 'made him a comfortable home' (Goodwin, 134), and tried to maintain her 'dainty ways'. She helped with his pastoral tasks, preferring to work with settlers rather than Africans. In 1857 they were joined by their sister Alice, and in 1859 Anne and her brother returned to England. In 1860 they went back to the Cape. In 1861 he went to Magomero while she remained in Cape Town intending to join him later. 
In December 1861 Anne Mackenzie and Mrs Burrup, the young bride of Henry Burrup, Mackenzie's fellow missionary, with their maids, travelled on a brig to join Mackenzie's party. After delays and vicissitudes, at Kongoni, at the mouth of the Zambezi, they met Livingstone, later than planned. He did not want them to come -- he wrote that 'most high church people lean on wives or sisters' (Jeal, 302) -- and he was 'rather abrupt and ungracious' (Awdry, 232) to Miss Mackenzie. They started up the Zambezi in Livingstone's boat, the 'Pioneer'. The journey was unhappy. Dr John Kirk considered Miss Mackenzie 'an old invalid who had followed him [her brother] through some sort of fanatical infatuation' (Jeal, 306). She disliked Mary Livingstone -- Livingstone's embittered, heavy-drinking wife -- as she considered Mrs Livingstone's criticism of missionaries an attack on her brother. There were quarrels, Livingstone was angry, and the sailors got drunk and enjoyed African women. Miss Mackenzie and Mrs Burrup transferred to a naval open gig under Captain Wilson RN, of the paddle-frigate 'Gorgon', who was helping the expedition. Miss Mackenzie was ill with fever. On 3 March she learned her brother had died. She returned ill to Cape Town and thence to Edinburgh. 
Anne Mackenzie resided with friends at Havant, Hampshire. She collected funds for Bishop Gray's Zululand 'Mackenzie mission', named after her brother, and published an edition of her late friend Mrs Robertson's letters, 'Mission Life among the Zulu-Kafirs: Memorials of Henrietta Robertson' (1866). From 1866 she edited a small missionary periodical, 'The Net'. She also taught Sunday school. 'A person of very decided opinions... a fair fragile lady, tenderly refined, and old rather with sorrow than with years' (Awdry, 257-8), she died aged 62 on 12 February 1877 at Woodfield, Havant.

Petrie, Irene Eleanora Verita (1864-1897), missionary, was born probably in October 1864 at Hanover Lodge, 14 Hanover Terrace, Kensington Park, London, the youngest of three daughters of Colonel Martin Petrie (1823-1892) and his wife, Eleanora Grant Macdowall (died 1886), youngest daughter of William Macdowall of Woolmet House, Midlothian. Both parents were of Scottish descent. Having been educated at home, unlike her sister, who had gone away to finishing school, from 1880 to 1882 she attended, at her own request, Notting Hill high school, Norland Square, London, one of the Girls' Public Day School Company schools. In 1884 she passed the Cambridge higher local examination, distinguishing herself especially in history. She painted, played the piano and guitar, and sang. Having been presented at court in March 1885, she enjoyed her coming out parties and balls. After her mother's death in January 1886 she occupied herself with philanthropic and religious work, including Sunday school teaching, through her parish, St Mary Abbots, Kensington, and in various charitable groups, locally and in the East End, including the National Health Society, the Prison Mission, the Scripture Union, and the Factory Helpers' Union. She had taken the pledge in July 1884 and was active in the Church of England Temperance Society and the Band of Hope. She also taught courses in scripture and hygiene in a correspondence school, the 'college by post', operated by her sister Mary (later Mrs Ashley Carus-Wilson). 
A member of the St Mary Abbots Missionary Union from the age of fifteen, Irene Petrie became even more interested in foreign missions while pursuing her philanthropic work, lecturing, writing articles for the Ladies' Union of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), and singing in the CMS ladies' choir at Exeter Hall. After receiving a 'call' to be a missionary in 1891, she wrote to the CMS requesting appointment. Her father encouraged her choice of philanthropic and religious work over marriage but opposed her becoming a missionary, and she remained at home until after his death in November 1892. After a short period (9-23 October 1893) at the CMS training institute, The Willows (part of the Mildmay Institution), Stoke Newington, London, encouraged by her sister she sailed for India in October 1893. 
Irene Petrie began her work in India as an unpaid volunteer at St Hilda's Diocesan Home in Lahore, which provided parochial care to poor European and Eurasian Christians employed by the railway and the post office. In April 1894 she was accepted by the Punjab and Sind corresponding committee of the CMS as an 'honorary missionary in local connexion', and joined the CMS's Kashmir mission in Srinagar for several months' intensive language study. In the severe winter of 1894-5 she lived in Srinagar with the head of the Kashmir women's mission, Miss Charlotte Hull, who remained a frequent companion in work and travel. Following language examinations in the spring of 1895 she returned to England for the summer to find 'friends for Kashmir' and to persuade the CMS to enrol her as a missionary in 'full connexion'. Having succeeded in these aims she returned to Srinagar in October 1895 to begin teaching 'Bible' classes at the CMS schools and visiting women in their homes. Her career in Kashmir was cut short, however, during a holiday in Leh in the Ladakh region of the Himalayas, where she died of fever (probably typhoid) on 6 August 1897. She was buried in the Moravian cemetery at Leh. Memorial tablets were placed in St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, and at St Luke's, Srinagar; the Irene Petrie Memorial Fund was established to support CMS work in Kashmir.

Pigott, (Emily) Jessie (1851-1900), missionary, born on 8 August 1851 at 43 Tavistock Square, London, was the daughter of George Tawke Kemp JP, a flannel manufacturer, and Emily Lydia Kemp, 'nee' Kelsall, later of Beechwood, Manchester Road, Rochdale. The family was well off, Baptist, and heavily imbued with missionary zeal. In 1877, after accompanying her father to Egypt, Jessie Kemp went on to become a missionary in Allahabad and Delhi, working with the Baptist Missionary Society. Ill health forced her to return to Britain in 1879, and she was refused medical permission to return to India. However, a cousin, Harold Schofield, had opened a medical mission in Taiyuan, Shansi province, China, under the aegis of the China Inland Mission (CIM), and suggested she join him. With her sister, Florence, she travelled to China, and in early 1883 she arrived in Taiyuan, where she became an associate of the CIM. 
In China, Jessie Kemp engaged in evangelistic work but she also undertook medical duties, notably -- and as an amateur -- operating on cataracts. There, too, she met another CIM missionary, Thomas Wellesley Pigott (1847-1900), of Ryevale, co. Kildare, Ireland, whom she married in Peking (Beijing) on 16 July 1883. In order for Pigott to recover from the effects of an assault, the couple spent from May 1885 until March 1888 in Britain, where Jessie studied treatments of the eyes, and gave birth to their only child, William Wellesley, on 4 August 1887. 
The Pigotts resigned their connections with the CIM on 4 June 1890, after disputes over the society's rules, its 'Principles and practice'. The rapidly growing mission was still under the 'godly leadership' of J. Hudson Taylor, but Thomas Pigott wanted democratic elections, a committee structure, and greater autonomy in the Shansi district, of which he had recently become CIM superintendent. The society was fractious at the best of times, but the couple were wealthy and confidently able both to assert themselves and then to support themselves independently of the mission in their quest for autonomy of action. 
After a spell in Britain -- in part because of Jessie Pigott's health, but also because they needed to establish a firm domestic base of support for their efforts -- the couple returned to China in April 1891 and established their own non-denominational mission at Showyang (Shouyang), east of Taiyuan, in 1892. The mission was not lacking in financial security and Pigott continued her medical work; by 1900 the station had eleven personnel and another branch in Taiyuan. However, in May and June 1900, the anti-foreign Boxer movement began to threaten foreigners in Shansi. On 29 June the Showyang magistrate withdrew protection from the small foreign community and the Pigotts fled to a Christian village outside the town. As the situation in the countryside grew more unstable they returned, and surrendered themselves to his custody. On 6 July they were transported to Taiyuan, and on 9 July Jessie, Thomas, and William Pigott were among the forty-four missionaries and their families publicly beheaded in the presence of the provincial governor, Yuxian. 
Jessie Pigott's persistence -- a family trait: her mother had taken over the running of the family mills after George Kemp's death -- and her husband's wealth meant that their missionary careers were atypical. In Showyang they had a governess and a tutor for their son, both from Britain. Nevertheless, their wealth ultimately did little to counteract her loneliness and the pain of separation from her family in Rochdale, to which she was very attached. Ill health, isolation, and an early death were, moreover, fairly typical rewards for missionaries in nineteenth-century China. In this Jessie Pigott was no exception.

Ruthquist, Alexina (1848-1892), missionary, was born on 8 September 1848 at Fordyce, Banffshire, the third child of the Revd Murdoch McKay, Free Church of Scotland minister at Rhynie, and his wife, Alexina Robertson. She had at least two sisters. Alexander McKay (1849-1890), CMS missionary to Uganda, was her cousin. She was educated at home and later at Miss Milne's seminary in Edinburgh. While at school she expressed a desire to become a missionary. Her mother, however, was unwilling to give her permission; in accordance with her wishes, Alexina agreed to defer her ambition and wait for a definite 'call' to mission work. 
Mrs McKay was convinced of her daughter's vocation in 1876, when a family friend recommended the McKay daughters to the Ladies' Society for Female Education in India and South Africa of the Free Church of Scotland. Her mother's approval secured, Alexina was sent to Nagpur as zenana agent (a missionary employed specifically to evangelize women) of the Free Church Mission there; she arrived in India in November 1877. 
Travelling with an interpreter and a Biblewoman, Alexina visited the homes of all who would allow her entrance, offering lessons in English, needlework, reading, and the harmonium, as well as religious instruction. She was said to have had a beautiful singing voice which she used to good effect, punctuating lessons with hymns in Marathi. Unwilling to confine her ministry to women, she made temperance visits to the local soldiers' camps. Her sister Maggie joined her at Nagpur in early 1881. Alexina spent 1883 on furlough in Britain conducting missionary meetings on behalf of the society; she declined a proposal of marriage, and returned to India. From 1880 she wrote under the pen name Phoebe for the magazine for Free Church of Scotland zenana agents, 'Jottings by Busy People'. 
In March 1884 Alexina's sister married a Swedish missionary and moved to Narsingphur. Alexina continued as zenana agent but resigned on her own marriage, which took place in Bombay on 13 October 1888, to the Revd Johan Ruthquist, also of the Swedish Mission. The couple settled in Amarwara and on 3 November 1889 their only child, Mary Juanita, was born; she lived for twelve days. With few domestic duties Alexina was able to accompany her husband as he toured the district. Her talent for singing, used before to keep the attention of her zenana pupils as well as to impart simple biblical messages, was now employed to draw audiences in the villages they visited. When in Amarwara she held 'Bible' classes, visited village women, and distributed medicine. 
Although failing in health, Alexina offered to accompany a widowed Swedish missionary to Stockholm with his two children, one a sickly infant. While the ship was in the Red Sea she became ill. After lying unconscious for two days, she died at Elektra on 5 September 1892, and was buried at Suez.

Urmston, Harriett Elizabeth Hughes (1828-1897), missionary, was born on 20 January 1828 at Clapham Common, Surrey, the fifth of six daughters of William Hughes Hughes (1792-1874), MP for Oxford, and his wife, Maria, 'nee' Field (died 1870). She lived at the family's summer home at Ryde, Isle of Wight, until she was eighteen, receiving her education from a governess. Her future husband, Henry Brabazon Urmston (1829-1898), son of Sir James Brabazon Urmston, was accepted as a cadet by the East India Company. He sailed for Bengal in 1847; in September 1850 Harriett left England and the couple married at the military station, Barrackpore, on 15 November 1850. They remained in India, with two furloughs home, until 1875. 
As the wife of a military officer and, after 1854, a civilian, Harriett's life was a series of relocations. With a growing family she often had little time for direct mission work; instead, the Urmstons opened their home to Anglican missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, as well as to local clergymen. Harriett made her convictions known by refusing to attend balls, the theatre, or the races. She derived spiritual sustenance from a long-running correspondence with Mary Kershaw, a Yorkshire invalid and active supporter of mission work; they began writing to each other in 1869 and the friendship was to end only on Harriett's death. 
Harriett Urmston found an opportunity for full-time missionary activity when her husband was sent to Rawalpindi as deputy commissioner in 1868. They remained there until 1874. By the terms of a neutrality proclamation, she was not permitted to evangelize among the people of India; in the cantonment were British soldiers, and instead she began a mothers' meeting for soldiers' wives, which in turn became a meeting for soldiers. Her services combined newly popular Sankey hymns and a sermon on a biblical text. Her practical exhortations proved popular and many were converted by her. Her unashamed ministry to any who would listen earned her the epithet 'Holy Mary'. 
Poor health forced the Urmstons' return to England in 1875 and they settled in Southsea, Hampshire. Harriett became involved with the Zenana Bible and Medical Missionary Society and between 1875 and 1884 addressed more than 300 meetings on its behalf. She visited the dockyard dining halls to lecture on temperance and, at the behest of Frederick Charrington (1850-1936), preached thirteen times at the Assembly Hall, Mile End, in east London, in 1878-9. In one year, 1877, she gave 276 addresses at which a total of 32,700 people were present. She was frequently invited to preach at local mission halls. In 1885 the Urmstons moved to Maidstone, Kent, where she regularly visited about eighty households in the parish. 
Harriett Urmston blended biblical knowledge, fervent piety, spiritual authority, and practical knowledge. Her forthrightness, especially in later life, earned her some reproach, but her biographer dismisses this as an (albeit unfortunate) product of her great zeal. She died from typhoid at her home, Ardenlee, Maidstone, on 4 September 1897. She was survived by her husband and six of their eight children: Mary Grace (1853-1933), Gertrude Elizabeth (1858-1916), Arthur Brabazon ('b'. 1861), Robert Bruce Brabazon ('b'. 1862), Beatrice Brabazon ('b'. 1864), and Florence Macan ('b'. 1866). The eldest son, Henry Brabazon (1851-1888), was killed on the Afghan frontier; and the second son, Herbert Edwardes (1855-1885), died after being invalided out of the Royal Navy.

Wakefield, Rebecca (1844-1873), missionary wife, was born in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, on 19 August 1844, the only daughter and youngest of four children born to Simeon Brewin (died 1857), a hosier and draper and Methodist local preacher, and his wife, Rebecca (1802/3-1862), daughter of Richard Wale, baker, of Mountsorrel, and herself active in local Methodist and temperance activities, and a role model for her daughter. Theirs was a close-knit, middle-class Methodist community. By 1857 Rebecca Brewin had lost two brothers, and she experienced a new religious commitment. By 1861, at seventeen, after attending school in Mountsorrel and in Loughborough, she became mistress of a school for 'young ladies'. After the death of her father and mother, she left the school in 1864 and moved to Birmingham to live with an aunt. In the same year she received a letter from her childhood friend John Mitchel, a missionary in Ceylon; he proposed marriage and she accepted, believing that she must redouble her efforts in the service of God. She was twenty, with dark brown hair and eyes, 'above the average height, well formed, and inclining to stoutness' (Brewin, 'Memoirs', 22). 
Wherever she lived, Rebecca taught Sunday school and actively joined in other church-related activities. Late in 1865 she lost both her aunt and her fiance, who died of cholera in Ceylon, and went to live with her remaining brother Robert Brewin, a Methodist minister. In 1867 they moved to Plumstead, near Woolwich, and in 1868 to Louth, Lincolnshire. She met Thomas Wakefield (1836-1902) in May 1869 at the annual assembly of the United Methodist Free Churches Missionary Society. A pioneer missionary in east Africa, he had established a station at Ribe, among the Nyika north of Mombasa. They married on 2 December 1869 and left England on 24 February 1870. 
Their storm-tossed voyage to Zanzibar took ninety-seven days in a small sailing ship and the discomfort was aggravated by Rebecca's pregnancy; their daughter, Helena Rebecca (Nellie), was born at Zanzibar on 16 October 1870. The Wakefields moved to Ribe to a two-room stone house and Rebecca took up her duties as a missionary wife. She taught the women sewing, led the singing at services, and occasionally taught the boys as well. Like other Europeans she met, she complained about Arab and African laziness and thievery. Yet she was truly distressed that British missionaries were not allowed to aid escaped slaves. She suffered periodic bouts of fever, and disastrous household losses wreaked by ants and rats that ate their way through books, clothing, and the mission's piano. Outside, night-prowling leopards scavenged their fowl and goats. In March 1873 Sir Bartle Frere visited Ribe on a government mission. His servants cooked for the thirteen officers of his party; Rebecca, again pregnant, fed his escort of fifty soldiers. Grave illness followed the birth of the Wakefields' son Bertie on 8 June 1873, and Rebecca died on 16 July, four days after she lost her son. They were buried together in the cemetery at the Ribe missionary station. 
For Rebecca Wakefield growing up in an earnest religious environment made the choice of being a missionary wife a desirable challenge. To preach the gospel to the 'heathen' was an exciting religious adventure for women as well as for men. When she died at twenty-nine, she was experienced as a worker in the field, dispensing medicine daily, planning Christian festivals, and self-consciously providing a model for Christian womanhood. Her brother Robert Brewin turned her graphic letters home into her memorial, 'Memoirs of Rebecca Wakefield, wife of the Rev. T. Wakefield, United Methodist Free Churches missionary in eastern Africa' (1876).

Lister, Thomas, fourth Baron Ribblesdale (1854-1925), politician and huntsman, was born at the Hotel de France, Fontainebleau, on 29 October 1854, the eldest son of Thomas Lister, third Baron Ribblesdale (1828-1876), and his wife, Emma (died 1911), youngest daughter of Colonel William Mure of Caldwell, Ayrshire. His father had been a devotee of the turf, and in straitened circumstances had taken his young family to live in France. Ribblesdale later observed that a spell abroad was 'a method of reconstruction often adopted in those days by families and single gentlemen who had outrun the constable, or, in Burton's phrase, had galloped themselves out of their fortunes' (Lister, 22). Lister's formal education was, however, in England, where he attended a preparatory school, Winton House, in Winchester and Harrow School (1868-72). 
In 1873 Lister joined the army. Initially with the 64th regiment, he later transferred to the rifle brigade, from which he retired in 1886 with the rank of major. He succeeded his father, who committed suicide, in 1876, and took his seat in the Lords the following year, but seldom attended the house. He later confessed that army life induced in him political apathy. By the time that he was appointed a lord-in-waiting to the queen in 1880 he had 'lost, if not forgotten' the whig principles that he had imbibed in youth from his stepgrandfather, Lord John Russell (Lister, 155). Ribblesdale found life at the royal court agreeable without always being stimulating, and he was conscious of the peculiar atmosphere that prevailed. News came practically first-hand to Windsor, but 'at the Household dinner... it was seldom mentioned and never discussed' (ibid., 107). He left court in 1885, with the fall of the Liberal government, but returned in 1892 as master of the buckhounds. Gladstone's intimation that this office might lead to greater things spurred Ribblesdale to be more active on behalf of the government. He was its spokesman in the Lords on agriculture and, later, Ireland, and with the fall of the ministry in 1895 he became chief Liberal whip, continuing until 1911. This office proved to be the acme of his political career, but by his own admission it carried little influence. 
It was riding, rather than politics, that dominated Ribblesdale's life. He had been successively a soldier, a courtier, and a politician, but was best known to his contemporaries as a great huntsman, and is best known to posterity as the subject of a great painting. John Singer Sargent's magnificent portrait of Ribblesdale (1902) captures the spirit of an age, as much as the image of one man. The subject's casual elegance exudes the confidence of the English aristocracy in its heyday before the First World War. He is depicted by Sargent wearing his favourite hunting clothes. These were not the dark green gala coat and white leathers of the master of the buckhounds: though more striking than the chosen mufti, this uniform would have been less apt. Ribblesdale's life was one of understated grandeur, and did not need the imprimatur of a uniform. An expert horseman, in 1897 he published a substantial history, 'The Queen's Hounds'. His love of hunting was shared by his first wife, Charlotte (Charty) Monckton Tennant (1858-1911), daughter of the industrialist Sir Charles Tennant, first baronet, whom he married on 7 April 1877. She was one of the celebrated sisters who took London society by storm (the others being Laura Lyttelton, Lucy Graham Smith, and Margot Asquith) and formed the nucleus of the aristocratic set the Souls. She died after a three-year fight against tuberculosis in 1911. They had five children; both their sons died on active service -- the elder in Somaliland in 1904, the younger after the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. It was in their memory, as well as their mother's, that Ribblesdale gave his Sargent portrait to the National Gallery (of which he had been a trustee since 1909) in 1916. He spent his widowhood at Rosa Lewis's Cavendish Hotel, and in 1919 married an American, Ava, widow of John Jacob Astor and daughter of Edward Willing. He died at 18 Grosvenor Square, London, on 21 October 1925; his widow renounced her title and resumed her American citizenship. His autobiographical 'Impressions and Memories', both interesting and well written, was posthumously published in 1927, with an introduction by his eldest daughter.

Winchester, Elhanan (1751-1797), Universalist preacher, was born on 30 September 1751 at Brookline, Massachusetts, the first child of Elhanan Winchester (died 1810), farmer, and Sarah, the first of his three wives. His grandfather, John Winchester (died 1694), had settled at Hingham in 1635. After beginning preaching in his home town, he joined in 1771 a local 'new light' congregation in Rehoboth, Massachusetts. Then he was baptized by immersion and ordained a Baptist preacher. When serving a racially mixed Calvinist Baptist church at Welch Neck, South Carolina, from 1775 to 1779 he condemned slavery in a sermon 'The Reigning Abominations Especially the Slave Trade' (1788). From 1780 he was minister of a Philadelphia Baptist church. About this time he read Paul Siegvolk's 'The Everlasting Gospel' (1753), published under the pseudonym of George Klein-Nicolai, which claimed God as all-powerful and all-benevolent, and as assuring universal restoration. His reading of Sir George Stonehouse's 'The Restitution of All Things' (1761), combined with his personal acquaintance with the Universalist George de Benneville (1703-1793), completed Winchester's conversion to Universalism. His church dismissed him, and he gathered a Universal Baptist congregation of which Benjamin Rush was a member. 
By the mid-1780s Winchester had been married and bereaved four times. His first wife, Alice Rogers, died in April 1776, and in the same year he married Sarah Peck of Rehoboth, who lived only a few months after their marriage. In 1778 he married Sarah Luke of South Carolina, who died in 1779, and in 1781 he married a widow from Philadelphia, Mary Morgan, who died about 1783. 
In 1787 Winchester unexpectedly left Philadelphia for England. Rush gave him letters of introduction to Richard Price (1723-1791) and others. He also knew of a London Universalist group meeting in Southwark, one of whom had reprinted his sermon 'The Outcast Comforted' (1783). In 1788 he published his best-known work, 'The universal restoration: exhibited in a series of dialogues between a minister and his friend'. According to Winchester even 'The misery of the wicked shall end because the kingdom of evil shall end' ('Universal Restoration', 4th edn, 1799, 37). The 'Dialogues' were read widely and he received many letters of appreciation. Dan Taylor of the New Connexion General Baptists replied with 'The Eternity of Future Punishment, Re-Asserted' (1800). Besides his 'Dialogues', Winchester published twenty-one items during his time in England, including ten sermons, a Universalist hymn book, and a periodical, 'The Philadelphian' (1780). 
In London, Winchester preached in meeting-houses in Blacksfields and Chapel Court, Southwark, in Moorfields, in Store Street, and in Boar's Head Yard, Petticoat Lane (1788-9); for the Glass-House Yard General Baptist meeting at Worship Street (1790-92); and at another meeting-house in Glass-House Yard itself. Late in 1792 he gathered a Universal Baptist congregation in a meeting-house in Parliament Court, Artillery Lane, Bishopgate. This congregation joined the General Baptist assembly in 1803, then became South Place Unitarian Chapel, Finsbury, and is now the South Place Ethical Society. Between 1788 and 1790 he preached in thirty-eight meeting-houses in England, eighteen of them in Kent, including Chatham, Canterbury, and Dover. He was twice in Cambridge, where he preached in Robert Robinson's Baptist meeting-house, and at Fleet and Wisbech in Lincolnshire. He also travelled to France. 
In 1792 Winchester first met the Particular Baptist William Vidler of Battle, Kent, who was converted to Universalism by reading the 'Dialogues'. Vidler had become his associate and successor at Parliament Court, when in May 1794 Winchester, troubled by the violence of his fifth wife, Maria Knowles, suddenly returned to America. English Universalist societies which originated under Winchester's influence first joined the General Baptist assembly, which had a compatible theology; by 1825, along with the General Baptists, they had all become Unitarian. By contrast most Universalist societies in America maintained a separate existence until their merger with the Unitarians in 1961. 
Back in America, Winchester itinerated in New England and briefly returned to Philadelphia, where he allowed the Universalist Unitarian Joseph Priestley, whom he had met in London in 1793, to use his pulpit. He also published 'Two Letters Addressed to Mr. Paine' (1795). 
Winchester, a handsome man, was asthmatic all his life and died of tuberculosis, aged forty-six, on 18 April 1797 at Hartford, Connecticut, and was buried on 21 April, less than three years after his return to America. He had no survivors -- seven of his children were stillborn and an eighth, Reconcile, lived for only eighteen months -- except his disturbed fifth wife.

Christopher Herman Gilkes (1898-1953), followed his father as master of Dulwich College from 1941 to 1953. He had himself been educated there before going on to Trinity College, Oxford. His first wife, Eleanor Benson, whom he married in 1921, died in 1938, and in the following year he married Kathleen Josephine Gaston Murray (1906-1960). Dulwich was one of the few schools which continued to function in London during the Second World War, and when Christopher Gilkes took over as master it was in a desperate state: no part of the buildings had escaped bombing; the numbers of pupils and the academic level had plummeted; and it was on the verge of bankruptcy. Gilkes restored it to its former eminence with vision and single-minded purpose, though not without raising some hackles. His greatest achievement was the expansion, after the 1944 'Education Act', of a scheme begun early in the century, under which the fees of particularly clever boys were paid for by their local authority. By 1961 just over 86 per cent came into this category -- more than in any comparable school. As a result, not only did the academic level become very high, but the college acquired a rare classlessness, enabling many children from deprived backgrounds to receive a first-class education which would otherwise have been denied them. Christopher Gilkes died of a heart attack at Nolton Haven, Pembrokeshire, on 2 September 1953.

Jones, Michael Daniel (1822-1898), Congregational minister and college head, was born on 2 March 1822 at the Chapel House, Llanuwchllyn, Merioneth, the third of the five children of Michael Jones (1785-1853), Congregational minister, and his wife, Mary (1786-1861). 
Jones was educated at the Dr Williams's School conducted by his father at Llanuwchllyn. He attended the Presbyterian college, Carmarthen, from 1839 until 1843, and studied at Highbury College, Middlesex, from 1844 to 1847. Since many of his relations had emigrated to Ohio, he joined them and was ordained minister of the Lawrence Street (Welsh) Congregational Church in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 7 December 1848. He returned to Wales in the summer of 1849 and was inducted into the pastorate of Bwlchnewydd Congregational Church, Carmarthenshire, on 27 June 1850. After the death of his father in 1853 he was appointed to succeed him as principal of the college at Bala on 26 September 1854. At the same time he was inducted into the ministry of the Congregational churches at Bala, Tyn-y-bont, Bethel, Soar, and Llandderfel. He resigned the pastorates of Bala and Tyn-y-bont in 1859, but continued principal of the college until his death. 
On 20 December 1859 at Pen-dref chapel, Ruthin, Denbighshire, Jones married Anne Lloyd (1831-1925), the daughter of John and Mary Lloyd of Pistyll, Bodfari, Flintshire; Mary had been married to Hugh Davies, Plas-yn-rhal, before 1851. They had two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Llwyd ap Iwan, a land surveyor, was murdered in Patagonia on 29 December 1909 by the notorious Sundance Kid. His brother, Mihangel ap Iwan, was a successful surgeon in Buenos Aires. One daughter, Mair, died in 1898 and the other, Myfanwy, married Professor Thomas Rhys (1852-1930) of Bala-Bangor College, Bangor. 
Jones's passionate interest in radical politics soon became evident at Bala. Rural Wales had long been under the thumb of tory landlords, and typical of the class was the MP for Merioneth, W. W. E. Wynne (1801-1880), the distinguished antiquary. Jones organized the Bala Reform Society to oppose Wynne. This was the beginning of the campaign that was to secure victory for the Liberals in the election of 1868. 
Jones is often called, not unjustly, the father of twentieth-century Welsh nationalism. During his stay in the United States he had noticed how soon Welsh identity was lost there and conceived a scheme to create a Welsh settlement in Argentina. The first settlers landed at Port Madryn, as they were to call it, on 28 July 1865. His hope was that a Welsh-speaking republic could be created in Patagonia, but the Argentine government would have none of it. Nevertheless the settlement, which had caused Jones much anxiety, effort, and expense, eventually began to flourish, and was still Welsh-speaking at the end of the twentieth century. 
Jones realized that the struggle for the maintenance of the Welsh identity had to be fought in Wales itself. His contribution there was to politicize the older cultural nationalism, and he nurtured the hope that a Welsh nationalist party would eventually take its place in parliament. His was a moderate nationalism, inspired by the work of Kossuth in Hungary and Mazzini in Italy. He argued for a federal union within the United Kingdom and pioneered the idea that this should be part of a federal European union on the pattern of the United States. He was a sharp critic of Victorian imperialism, and like other radicals condemned what he saw as the wasteful ostentation of the royal family. Unlike other Victorian radicals, he did not approve of unalloyed 'laissez-faire' capitalism and argued for an economy based on co-operative principles. 
All this involved Jones in constant controversy. The most bitter of his controversies, however, had to do with his own college. A plan was launched to mark the bicentenary of the Great Ejection of 1662 by merging the Bala College with the other Congregational college at Brecon. The prime mover was the formidable John Thomas of Liverpool (1821-1892). Jones opposed the plan. In the trial of strength that followed, Jones was ejected from the principalship in 1879, but he and his supporters continued to maintain their college. This meant that there were two colleges at Bala. The controversy split the Congregational denomination, and only in 1892 was it possible to reunite the colleges at Bangor under the name Bala-Bangor College. 
In theology Jones was an evangelical Arminian, and always claimed that his political principles grew out of his evangelical theology and his Congregationalism. He was a striking character. He always wore homespun clothes and ate plain food. He was a teetotaller and vigorous opponent of smoking, yet he enjoyed nothing more than a day's shooting. He was also the first Welsh nonconformist minister to wear a beard. Virtually all his writing was in articles to a variety of Welsh periodicals. He died at his home, Bodiwan, in Bala, on 2 December 1898 and was buried in the cemetery of the Old Chapel, Llanuwchllyn, on 8 December.

Hughes, John (c.1816-1889), ironmaster and engineer, was born at Merthyr Tudful, Glamorgan, the son of John Hughes, engineer. Although his family origins are obscure, his father was employed at the Cyfarthfa ironworks in Merthyr Tudful and, later, at the Victoria works in Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire. According to tradition, Hughes joined his father, learning his trade at both works. By the early 1840s he held a senior position at the Uskside engineering works at Newport. 
The Uskside works had grown from a small smithy in 1827 into a foundry specializing in ships' equipment such as anchors and chains. Hughes is variously described as proprietor, manager, and director of the works. Whatever his position, his time at Uskside was actively spent in consolidating both his personal and professional life. On 27 October 1844, at St Paul's Church, St Woolos, Newport, Monmouthshire, Hughes married Elizabeth (died 1880), daughter of William Lewis. His wife's family were associated with the Tredegar Arms, adjoining the Uskside foundry and supplying its workers with beer. John and Elizabeth Hughes lived at 36 Church Street, near the works. Their eight children, six boys and two girls, were all born at home in Newport between 1846 and 1858. During the same period, Hughes developed the Uskside works, and patented a number of inventions in armaments and armour plating. 
In 1859 the family moved to London. Through his marine engineering and armament experience Hughes obtained a senior position with the Millwall Engineering and Shipbuilding Company on Thameside, and later he became a director of the company. The firm won the British Admiralty's 1864 trials of armour plating for 'iron-clads' with the Millwall shield, and John Hughes's reputation was secured. It was this that attracted the attention of the Russian government. Hughes was invited to St Petersburg to discuss the possibility of plating the naval fortress at Kronstadt. The negotiations soon developed into a proposal that Hughes should establish a metallurgical plant somewhere in Russia. Geological surveys had already indicated the mineral riches of the Donbass coal basin in southern Ukraine. Although previous attempts at industrial development in the area had not met with success, Hughes decided, after a tour of inspection, to take up the challenge. He bought a concession for building a full-cycle metallurgical plant and rail-producing factory based on local Donbass materials from Prince Sergey Kochubey, and negotiated for land, mineral rights, and contracts. Hughes signed a formal agreement with the Russian government in 1868, and the New Russia Company Limited was registered in London on 3 July 1869, with a capital of $300,000. Hughes's professional prestige attracted a number of prominent industrialists, including Sir Daniel Gooch, Thomas Brassey, father and son, and Joseph Whitworth, whose names among his seventeen original shareholders helped to raise the necessary capital for his enterprise. 
The site Hughes had chosen for the factory lay on the open steppe, about 75 kilometres north of the nearest port. All the equipment needed to establish an ironworks had to be hauled by bullocks across the steppe from Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov. In the summer of 1870 Hughes arrived with about a hundred specialist ironworkers and miners, mostly recruited from the industrial valleys of south Wales. Within eight months, on 24 April 1871, the first blast furnace had been commissioned, despite an unusually severe winter and a cholera epidemic. Regular production of iron began in January 1872. The Russian government provided initial subsidies and relaxed import duties, although minimum production levels and commencement dates had been set for the mines and furnaces. Hughes and his men overcame the early difficulties, and by 1880 were able to produce daily the agreed weekly quota of iron. The surrounding area was able to provide the works with all the necessary raw materials except specialized labour. Hughes therefore imported a small core of expert workers from south Wales, but local labourers were also recruited and trained; nevertheless, the company continued to employ British workers in senior positions until 1917. The company's works were known familiarly by the name of the founder, a testament to his forceful personality. The 'Hughes factory' gave its name to the settlement which grew up in its shadow. Hughes and his family lived in Hughesovka (Yuzovka) from 1870; four of his sons helped to establish and run the works, and a number of his grandchildren were born in the town. 
A contemporary account describes John Hughes as 'an open-faced, clear-eyed, bluff and handsome man, with laughter as well as command in the tones of his voice' (obituary, quoted in Bowen). He was an industrial entrepreneur of the old school with a firm belief in the values of hard work, honesty, and hands-on management. He shared his workers' discomforts during the first winter at the site, and later is described visiting their homes to celebrate a wedding or to greet a new baby. In 1879 Hughes wrote from London to the minister of domains expressing his fears that an outbreak of plague could spread to Hughesovka: 'I have impressed on the workmen in our employ to abstain from drinking vodka... and also to avoid eating a large amount of cucumbers and melons and especially unripe fruit' (Central State Historical Archives, St Petersburg, F.37, op.53, d.746, p.297). He established hospitals, a fire brigade, and a police force in his town and took a personal interest in the health and general behaviour of his workforce. 
John Hughes died on 29 June 1889 of a stroke while on business in St Petersburg. His body was returned to London for interment, beside his wife, in the family plot at Norwood cemetery. The town and the works which bore his name continued to expand under his sons' leadership, becoming one of the largest industrial enterprises in the Russian empire, until by 1917 the registered capital of the New Russia Company stood at $2.5 million. After the revolution of that year the majority of the company's foreign employees left the country, although the works survived and prospered under new management and a new name. The town of Hughesovka became Stalino in 1924, and adopted the name Donetsk in 1961. It remained one of the largest industrial centres in Ukraine. The New Russia Company was formally liquidated in 1970. 
When he founded the New Russia Company, Hughes was a successful businessman in his fifties. In contrast to most foreign industrialists in Russia he cut his links with his British business interests and established his home in his adopted country. The likelihood of large profits was undoubtedly a major motivation, together with the technological challenge presented by building a new industry from the ground. His cautious, sure development of the company and paternalistic concern for his workers suggest a longer-term commitment to the creation of a stable industrial base in the Donbass, and a dynastic vision for the town which bore his name.

Evance, Sir Stephen (1654/5-1712), goldsmith and entrepreneur, was born at New Haven, New England, the son of John Evance, a London merchant who had emigrated to Virginia in 1635 and traded with the Caribbean islands. Evance presumably spent his youth in New England but in 1669, when he was fourteen and perhaps as a result of his father's recent death, he was sent to London as an apprentice to the Goldsmiths' Company. He prospered there, being admitted a freeman of the company in 1676 and elected prime warden in 1691. During these years he became acquainted with leading figures in many of the larger trading companies, notably the Hudson's Bay Company, for which by 1681 he had become the principal cashier, responsible for most of its financial transactions. His work for the company concentrated on the sale of North American furs, and on establishing trade with Russia in furs and hemp. Within twenty years he owned more than $4300 in stock, but his own considerable loans to the company, on which it often depended to remain solvent, were frequently jeopardized by late or incomplete reimbursements. The profits from his investments, when paid, were dispersed among diverse business interests, which included leasing a trading ship, purchasing stock in the White Paper Makers', Royal African, and East India companies, financing various schemes for manufacturing steel, guns, and hollow sword blades, exploiting royal copper mines in New England, and developing a newly invented air pump to allow divers to salvage wrecks. 
From 1689 Evance became one of the crown's main domestic lenders. In that year alone he raised loans to the crown amounting to $175,000, and in addition supported the government's commitments to supplying armies in Ireland and Flanders, and provided subsidies for the allies in Europe. He was able to finance these enterprises by drawing bills of exchange on the Amsterdam market while accepting payment in the form of government debt. Evance was rewarded for these endeavours by a knighthood and several gifts of money, as well as being appointed the king's jeweller and a commissioner of excise and wine licences. 
His support for the government would explain Evance's return to parliament in 1690 for Bridport, a borough recently granted a new charter and comprising a reduced corporation purged of all court opponents. Outside the house, Evance's natural opposition to the formation of the Bank of England, which threatened his financial activities, was criticized by the lords justices, but this posed no immediate threat to his importance as a financier and man of business. However, early the following year he was censured for accusing two of his fellow excise commissioners of Jacobitism, and when he was threatened with a prosecution for defamation his backers considered that his financial usefulness to the government was outweighed by both his political liability and emerging evidence of irregularities in his government contracts; by the summer he had been removed from the excise commission. 
Evance's political career was swiftly terminated by this crisis but his involvement in public life, and in a variety of entrepreneurial schemes supported by his business contacts, continued to occupy him. In 1700 he was appointed, for the second time, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the following year he led a consortium to raise a voluntary subscription of $1 million to create a company manufacturing woollen goods. He also attempted to secure a private bill for the company's incorporation. By 1702 Evance's private trading had brought him into contact with Thomas Pitt, governor of Madras, and the latter's son Robert, and when Robert returned from Madras with his father's celebrated diamond Evance was chosen as its custodian. Soon afterwards Evance embarked on an unsuccessful speculative enterprise insuring merchants, but as his losses overwhelmed him so did his business partners desert him. He was declared bankrupt early in January 1712, reputedly owing more than $100,000. On 5 March, at Woodford, in the house of Sir Caesar Child, a relative, he hanged himself from an attic window. He was unmarried, and his remaining stock, held in trust for him and amounting to $4000, was settled on his niece.

Fowle, Sir Thomas (bap. 1637, d. 1692), goldsmith and banker, was baptized on 6 January 1637, the fifth son of Edward Fowle, a yeoman, and his wife, Barbara, of Stanton St Bernard, Wiltshire. The family held enough leasehold and copyhold land directly to support the two elder sons, Edward and Henry, and to provide premiums to apprentice the next three boys, Daniel, Robert, and Thomas, to London goldsmiths. Details of Fowle's education are unknown until he was apprenticed on 12 August 1652, at the age of fifteen, for eight years, to James Pewte, a 'shopkeeping goldsmith' in Tower Street. He became free of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1660, when he probably opened a shop in the vicinity of Temple Bar in Fleet Street, where he was established at the Black Lion by 1667, the year in which he became a liveryman of the company. It was this period that first saw the provision of credit accounts and the development of the clearing system which, based on the agreement of a ring of goldsmiths to accept each other's 'notes', in effect to honour third-party debts, was the vital step in the establishment of goldsmith banking. These developments can be traced in Fowle's career. His surviving '1664 daybook' charts an emerging business serving a burgeoning clientele of gentry and lawyers living both in the west of the City and beyond, towards Westminster and the court at Whitehall. Fowle's trade was diverse, and included the sale of plate and jewellery, bullion exchange, and some provision of financial services. In the summer of 1665, when the plague was at its height in the City, Fowle closed his shop; he reopened in January the following year. Trade recovered quickly, and on 9 June 1666 he married Jane, the daughter of Roger Norton of St Anne Blackfriars, a prosperous London stationer. Her marriage portion of $900 provided a significant addition to the capital of the business. In early September the great fire destroyed much of the City but stopped just short of Fowle at Temple Bar. The goldsmiths to the east were not so fortunate, for Lombard Street was reported to be 'all in dust', which must have given, at least for a while, a competitive advantage to those in Fleet Street. 
After the great fire, Fowle started to sell the most fashionable plate, which was commissioned from Arthur Manwaring, a leading English silversmith, and from Wolfgang Howzer and Jacob Bodendick, two 'strangers' working in the 'new' or 'French fashion'. The pattern of his trade remained broadly similar for the next few years, his main profits being generated by the sale of plate and jewellery with a limited return on bullion dealings and interest on loans. In 1672 the 'stop of the exchequer' (when the repayment of loans to lenders was suspended) was a severe setback to a number of Lombard Street goldsmiths. Their difficulties may have helped the emerging Fleet Street goldsmith bankers such as Fowle, despite their client base being substantially different. Perhaps it is not coincidental that the first clearing accounts between Thomas Fowle and Robert Blanchard (later Child's Bank) appeared in Blanchard's ledger for 1672; the moneys cleared between them rose steadily to more than $17,000 in 1679. There were similar arrangements to accept and clear notes with other goldsmith bankers. These included most of those that kept 'running cashes' listed in the vicinity of Fleet Street in the 'Little London Directory' of 1677. 
Fowle's banking activities grew steadily, with net profits in the late 1670s in excess of $1000, raising to $3000 by the end of the next decade. Part of these were retained for expansion but some were used to purchase land, particularly in the west country. Despite the growth in banking activity, Fowle continued to employ a number of subcontractors and specialist craftsmen to make a wide range of plate and jewellery. In 1681 William Fowle (1658-1684), the second son of Thomas Fowle's eldest brother Edward, finished his apprenticeship with Arthur Manwaring and was established with a house and shop in Hungerford Street, off the Strand. Thomas financed his nephew's trade, taking most of his production, until William's untimely death in 1684. Prominent among William's plate were splendid toilet services, either finely cast and chased with mythological scenes, such as the Calverley set in the Victoria and Albert Museum, or flat-chased with lively chinoiseries, such as that in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. The cast and chased toilet services are considered among the finest surviving examples of Caroline goldsmithing. 
Fowle was known for his strong tory sympathies and played an active role in the life of the Goldsmiths' Company and the City. In 1682 he was elected to the court of assistants of the company. In 1686 he became an alderman and was soon after chosen as sheriff and knighted. The following year he became prime warden of the Goldsmiths' Company, but was removed from this office and discharged as alderman at a time when, having dissolved parliament, James II replaced many opposed to him. On the accession of William III, Fowle was again elected prime warden, but declined to serve. However, he co-operated with the new regime, acting as a member of the committee of City financiers that negotiated loans for the government in 1690; he also lent some $20,500 himself. He was elected member of parliament for Devizes in the tory interest in March 1690, but the proceedings of the election were disputed and he was unseated on petition the following December. Although out of parliament, he was re-elected an alderman in 1691. He died 'of an apoplexy' on 11 November 1692 and was buried on the 24th in his parish church of St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, with very considerable pomp (Luttrell, 614, 623). His wife survived him, and died on 2 January 1707. 
Fowle was clearly firm in his business dealings, as he notes, for example, in his pocketbook: 'Tho. Wotton my sarvant is indebted to me By Negligence in Letting a woman cheat Him of Five Guinys' (TNA: PRO, C104/120, pt 1). Nevertheless, he was generous in his will, for, after making ample provision for his widow and his only child, Susan (who married Jonathan Cope), he left land and money to fifteen relatives and made several charitable bequests. He also left $200 to 'my old servant' Thomas Farmer, his bookkeeper, who continued to serve at the Black Lion, under Robert Fowle, the son of Thomas's brother Robert, in partnership with Thomas Wotton, his former apprentice. His nephew Robert, as residuary legatee, was left, according to a contemporary report, $10,000 'to continue that trade, with the house and shop in Fleet Street where he lived, so his dealings seems the same as if Sir Thomas was yet living' (W. Ball to Sir Cyril Wyche, 24 Jan 1693, National Archives of Ireland, Wyche MSS).

Turner, Joseph Egbert (1853-1897), Benedictine monk and composer, was born on 10 January 1853 at 4 Fishergate, Preston, Lancashire, the seventh of the ten children of James Turner, a master tailor and draper, and his wife, Martha, the daughter of Robert Railton of Blackburn. After receiving an education from the Benedictine monks at Ampleforth, Yorkshire, he joined that community and was sent to Belmont Priory, Hereford, which was then the common novitiate for all English Benedictines, but he returned to Ampleforth for solemn profession on 8 December 1876. At that time a new foundation was being established at Fort Augustus on Loch Ness. Turner joined it and was ordained priest there on 22 May 1880. In 1883 he was recalled to Ampleforth as organist and choirmaster. 
Little or nothing is known about Turner's musical education. Dom Cuthbert Hedley, his superior at Belmont, was an accomplished organist, and there is some tradition that R. W. Oberhoffer, of York, gave him some tuition. Much of the appeal in Turner's music lies in its quaintly honest structure. Almost self-taught, he attained a standard of craftsmanship always scrupulously correct; he had a special gift of melody, and he was careful never to violate the academic rules of harmonic progression. His work may be described as highly polished if not brilliant. Only in the latter years of his life, years spent in Benedictine parishes, did he achieve fame as a composer and the reputation of one whose church music was without rival in popularity among Roman Catholic choirs, large or small. He was curate at St David's, Swansea (1885-9), St Michael's, Workington (1889-91), St Mary's, Warrington (1891-3), and St Anne's, Edge Hill, Liverpool (1893-7). In Liverpool, Turner was the musical correspondent of the 'Catholic Times' and a close friend of Sir Charles Santley and the first Eugene Goossens. 
Turner's publications consist of seven motets, six litanies, four masses, three benediction services, a 'Festival Litany of Loreto', and a few arrangements of other pieces. It was said at his funeral that he also had plans for a grand oratorio. But it was as a composer of settings of the Latin mass that his name became renowned. His first mass ('St John the Baptist') has a ring of joyous solemnity and a pleasing, often noble, melodic line. Its 'Sanctus' might owe something to Mozart's 'Requiem' but its 'Gloria' is pure Turner. His second mass ('St Cecilia') was the most popular of its type ever written. Though it is capricious in places, the celestial-sounding opening of its 'Gloria' and its copious solo passages led to the publication of eleven editions between 1892 and 1973. His third mass ('St Mary Magdalen') is a work of splendid fervour, having a magnificent 'Kyrie' and 'Gloria' and a 'Benedictus' of angelic simplicity. His fourth mass ('The Good Shepherd') was, in the opinion of his publisher, Alphonse Cary, his best work. There is a 'Kyrie' of elegiac beauty and a 'Gloria' and 'Credo' containing true polyphony, while the 'Dona nobis pacem' of the 'Agnus Dei' culminates in a mighty fugue. The seven motets -- 'Adoro te devote' (two settings), 'Ascendit Deus', 'Ave Pater sanctissimae', 'Ave verum', 'O sacrum convivium', and 'O quam suavis' -- all exhibit similar characteristics. 
In September 1897 the 1300th anniversary of the arrival of St Augustine and his companions was celebrated on the shores of Kent, with magnificent ceremonial. A choir of forty Benedictine monks was to take part, but, when summoned to take his place in procession, Turner was found to be stricken with pleurisy and unable to move. Pneumonia developed, and on Sunday 19 September 1897 he died, at 45 Grange Road, Ramsgate, Kent. His grave, with the epitaph 'Now I will sing of Thy great mercy', is in the cemetery attached to St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate.

Phillpotts, (Mary) Adelaide Eden (1896-1993), writer, was born on 23 April 1896 at Ealing, the only daughter and second of two children of Eden Phillpotts (1862-1960), writer, and his first wife, Emily (died 1928), daughter of Robert Topham. Her publishing career spanned some seventy-five years and ended in 1991 with her last book, 'The Beacon of Memory'. Compared with her father, who published over 225 books, her output was small. Between 1916 and 1991 she published forty-two books in a variety of genres -- novels, plays, and poems of great charm and considerable talent. Her works presented realistic portrayals of women experiencing the pressures and stresses of Victorian society. Her heroines (there were no heroes) embodied a capacity for suffering, a suspicion of middle-class values, and a distrust in the ability of men to make women happy. 
After a period of education under a governess, Phillpotts went to a local boarding-school, Girton House, and later to Gressendale School, Southbourne. For a brief period (1915-16) she worked with C. K. Ogden for the 'Cambridge Magazine'. Her next phase of education consisted of one year of a full social science course at Bedford College, London. The Phillpotts family enjoyed numerous literary friendships, and Adelaide benefited from the frequent visits of well-known writers, including Agatha Christie (her neighbour in Devon), Thomas Hardy, and Arnold Bennett. 
Phillpotts remained unmarried until the age of fifty-five. On 25 August 1951, at Newton Abbot register office and much against the wish of her father, she married an American bookseller from Boston named Nicholas Ross. Eden Phillpotts cut her off, and never met her after her marriage, despite several attempts by Adelaide at reconciliation. She remained happily married to Nicholas Ross until he died on 28 July 1967. 
Phillpotts's relationship with her father was somewhat unusual. Father and daughter collaborated often on writing projects and were joint authors of 'Yellow Sands' (1926), 'The Good Old Days' (1932), 'West Country Plays' (1933), and 'My Lady's Mill' (1935). They dedicated books to each other and Eden Phillpotts even wrote sonnets for her. According to Adelaide, this father-daughter relationship extended beyond literary collaboration and fatherly affection to incest, extreme jealousy, and cruelty on his part. She told her own side of this story in 'Reverie: an Autobiography' (1981), published under her married name: 'He had begun deeply to love me. I think he looked on me as an extension of himself, for he would take me into his bed and fondle me, compare my limbs with his and say ' Look! Your hands and feet are just like small editions of mine. You are so like me. And you are going to be a writer too.' He kissed me all over and said: 'You must never marry!' At six or seven that meant nothing to me. Yet I did not forget those words, which all through my youth and afterwards were repeated. I loved him too but only as a father, and for fear of hurting him I let him do whatever he liked. (Ross, 29)' Seven of Phillpotts's novels can be considered as a group, as all have, in addition to similar settings and themes, women as central characters: Janet Finlay in 'A Marriage' (1928), Leah Vinnicome in 'The Gallant Heart' (1939), Lily Lark in 'The Round of Life' (1939), Elizabeth Broad in 'Our Little Town' (1942), Jane Moor in 'From Jane to John' (1943), Allison Westaway in 'The Fosterling' (1949), and Hannah Northway in 'Stubborn Earth' (1951). These heroines showed discontent with the male-dominated society that robbed them of the power to better their lot. The Phillpotts heroine was not a modern career woman, strong and independent, but a warm and sensitive woman, a good mother, and a not so submissive wife who was beginning to show the stirrings of 'women's liberation'. 
Phillpotts was a versatile writer. She tried her hand at several literary forms, including plays, historical novels, travel writing, poems, and autobiography. 'Yellow Sands' (1926), written first as a play in collaboration with her father, was later at his wish turned into a novel (1930). The play ran successfully at the Haymarket Theatre for 610 performances. 'Akhnaton' (1926), a historical play written in verse, presented the Egyptian pharaoh's revolutionary attempt to introduce 'one god', Aton, to his people in the fourteenth century BC. 'Broken Allegiance' (1937) also dealt with a historical theme: Benedict Arnold's role in the American War of Independence. She also wrote two books of poems: 'A Song of Man' (1959) and 'A Wild Flower Wreath' (1975). In 1964 she and her husband travelled round the world. She wrote the story of this voyage in 'Panorama of the World' (1969). Her autobiography, 'Reverie' (1981), too, described extensive travels. 
Phillpotts spent the last years of her life in the village of Kilkhampton, 6 miles north of Bude, Cornwall. After she became increasingly weak and almost blind, she moved into Trelana Nursing Home, Poughill, Bude. She died there on 4 June 1993 at the age of ninety-seven, having produced a body of work impressive in its range and richness. She was buried beside her husband at Morwenstow church, Cornwall.

Reynolds, John Henry (1842-1927), promoter of technological education, was born in Salford, Lancashire, on 8 February 1842, the son and eldest of eleven children of John Reynolds, a bootmaker, and his wife, Sarah, 'nee' Hilton. He attended the Lower Mosley Street day school of the Cross Street Unitarian Chapel and, for one year, Manchester grammar school. At twelve he was apprenticed bootmaker to his father and also became a pupil teacher at the chapel's Sunday school. Here he met William Fairbairn, the Revd William Gaskell, and other leading Unitarians. Apart from a course at Owens College, he was self-educated from this time onward. On 19 August 1868 he married Ellen Ferguson at Cross Street Chapel; they had three children. 
In 1879 Reynolds was appointed secretary to the Manchester Mechanics' Institution, which by the 1870s survived mainly by providing elementary school classes. But increasing support for primary education from municipal and other sources had greatly reduced the demand for this service; by 1879 it was clearly in decline. To his new task Reynolds brought vision, administrative skills, integrity (a quality some of his predecessors lacked), and powers of persuasion -- gifts made the more effective by his enthusiasm for his work. Within a year he had devised a full programme for the survival and future development of the institution. By this time the need for better technical education was widely recognized. In July 1882 it was decided to transform the institution into a technical school. 
In 1887 Reynolds admitted that Manchester was in the third class of English towns in its provision of technical education ('Transactions of the Manchester Statistical Society', 1887, 118-9). He worked hard to set high standards and to recruit the best-qualified staff for the new school, of which he was the principal. Fortunately, money was becoming available. The new City and Guilds of London Institute was one source of funds, while the acts of 1889 and 1890 empowered local authorities to support technical education. Accordingly, the city took over the Manchester Technical School, now renamed the Municipal Technical School. At the same time Reynolds became secretary of the Manchester corporation technical instruction committee and director of technical instruction. In that capacity he, with members of the committee, visited the technological schools of Europe in 1891 and 1897 (see his published reports). The fine buildings and lavish equipment they saw, particularly in Germany and Switzerland, impressed everyone. Accommodation in Manchester was quite inadequate: Reynolds had had to arrange courses in widely dispersed buildings. In 1898 he toured the United States and Canada on another fact-finding mission, of which he published a report. 
Following a grant of land by the Whitworth Institute, what was claimed to be the finest technical college in Britain was built on Sackville Street, Manchester. It was opened in 1902 by the prime minister and renamed the Municipal School of Technology. Reynolds continued in office as principal and as director for higher education in Manchester. In that year the (federal) Victoria University awarded him an honorary MSc. 
In the following year Owens College became the autonomous Victoria University of Manchester. Under Reynolds's supervision several courses had reached university standard, and it was agreed that the new university would establish a faculty of technology in the school (1904). Reynolds became dean of the new faculty, with a seat on the senate. Although ten members of staff had been designated professors by the school, there was room for only three on the university senate. These professors and their staffs, also recognized by the university, were paid by the city. However, most of the school's efforts were devoted to part-time and evening classes. As C. H. Herford remarked, many were involved in this development but it was the idealism, the initiative, and the driving power of J. H. Reynolds that made it possible. 
After Reynolds retired in 1912 development of the school was less rapid, and it was only in the era of Dr Bowden that development rivalled that of Reynolds's day. It is now, as the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), an autonomous university (1994). It is doubtful if Reynolds would have approved of the ending, in 1956, of part-time and evening courses: these, after all, involved intimate links with local industry and with the wider community, links that he, a Manchester radical, held most important. Reynolds spent his last years at Cheadle Hulme. He died on 17 July 1927 while on holiday in Anglesey and was cremated at the southern cemetery, Manchester.

Denison, Joseph (c.1726-1806), banker, was probably the elder son of Joseph Denison, cloth merchant, of Burmantofts Hall, Leeds, and his first wife, Rebecca, 'nee' Wainman. Nineteenth-century accounts of Denison's life, seeking to contrast his great wealth in later life and the fine marriages of his daughters with his humble origins, went so far as to assert he was 'a parish boy, ignorant of reading and writing, who made his way from Yorkshire up to London on foot' (Taylor, 231). Certainly, identification is not made easier by the fact that the name of Denison was extremely common in the Leeds area, and no evidence of Denison's baptism there has been unearthed. Nevertheless, given that rags to riches was a rare phenomenon in Georgian England, a mercantile background seems more plausible. 
Reputedly, Denison became a clerk in the counting-house of an Irish Catholic merchant (Dillon) before starting out on his own account. He was connected with the Liverpool banking firm of Heywood, acting as their London agent and eventual partner, as well as handling the accounts of other large-scale north-country merchants and bankers. By the 1780s he had made a very considerable fortune, the reward, according to Taylor, of 'unabated industry and the most rigid frugality' (Taylor, 231). In fact, little is known of Denison's banking activities. But his success was evident enough. In 1787 he purchased Denbies in Surrey, built by Jonathan Tyers, the celebrated proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens; five years later he acquired, for around $100,000, the east Yorkshire estates of the duke of Leeds. 
Joseph Denison was twice married. His first wife, Sarah, was the daughter of William Sykes of Salford. After her death in 1768 he married Elizabeth (1738/9-1771), the daughter of William Butler, variously described as merchant of Lisbon and Southwark hatter. The second marriage produced a son and two daughters, before Elizabeth's early death. Their son, William Joseph Denison (1770-1849), continued his father's banking business, becoming senior partner in Denison, Heywood, and Kennard. W. J. Denison was high sheriff of Yorkshire in 1808, MP for Camelford (1796-1802), Kingston upon Hull (1806-7) and, surviving eight elections to become father of the house, MP for the western division of Surrey from 1818 until his death in 1849. His estate, reckoned to be worth a colossal $2.3 million, and realizing $80,000 a year, passed to his nephew, Lord Albert Denison Conyngham (created Baron Londesborough in 1850). By 1883 the latter's son, who became the first earl of Londesborough in 1887, was the largest landowner in the East Riding of Yorkshire, with 52,655 acres. 
However, the fame of Joseph Denison's elder daughter surpassed that of her brother. Elizabeth Denison ['see 'Conyngham, Elizabeth] married Henry Burton Conyngham: she achieved notoriety as George IV's avaricious, overweight mistress, acquiring a marquessate for her husband (lord steward of the king's household), a barony (Wenlock) for the husband of her younger sister, Anna Maria, and a peerage (which he declined) for her brother, William Joseph. By the early nineteenth century, the wealth and social range of the Denisons was a byword in Regency England. Both were founded on Joseph Denison's extraordinary assiduity as a banker. He died at home in the parish of St Mary Axe, London, on 12 December 1806, aged, according to his obituary in 'Gentleman's Magazine', about eighty. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, just outside the City of London.

Merrick, Leonard William (1864-1939), writer, was born on 21 February 1864 at 51 Belsize Park, London. His early years are clouded in obscurity, but he seems to have been the only son of William Miller and Esther Davis. His father, a businessman, and his family -- of Jewish origin -- planned his education in private schools, at Heidelberg University, and in law, but Merrick's father lost money in a business venture, and Merrick left his school, Brighton College, early. At the age of eighteen he was sent to South Africa and to the Kimberley goldfield area, where initially he superintended black labourers; later he worked as a magistrate's clerk, finally entering a Kimberley solicitor's office. A serious attack of camp fever nearly killed him. These experiences form the setting for Merrick's 'The Worldlings' (1900). 
After his return to London in the 1880s, he changed his name by deed poll to Merrick, and for two years toured England as an actor, playing largely in melodramas. Disillusioned with acting, he then turned to writing short stories for a London paper, 'Wit and Wisdom'. His first novel, 'Mr Bazalgette's Agent' (1888), although critically and commercially unsuccessful, is remarkable for its use of the selective confessional diary form in the voice of what must be the first female detective. A depressed Merrick went to New York to seek his fortune on the stage with a borrowed $50, but while unemployed there he wrote his second novel, 'Violet Moses' (1891), which satirically draws upon the Anglo-Jewish background of the St John's Wood and Maida Vale areas of late Victorian London. He returned to London in 1891 to discover that the novel had achieved limited critical recognition. On 1 February 1894, at St Pancras parish church, London, Merrick married Hope Sarah Augusta Butler-Wilkins (died 1917), of Northampton, the daughter of a dentist and the author of at least two novels, 'When a Girl's Engaged' (1905) and the posthumously published 'Mary-Girl' ('c'.1920). Between 1891 and 1911, when his last novel, 'The Position of Peggy Harper', was published, Merrick wrote nine other novels, and many short stories, and he collaborated in the writing of at least ten plays. After 1911 he concentrated his creative energies on writing short stories for high-paying magazines. 
Merrick's work is characterized by an obsession with style. Michael Sadleir observes in his 'XIX Century Fiction: a Bibliographical Record' (1951) that the uniform edition of Merrick's writing published in 1918-19 by Hodder and Stoughton in London 'represented an attempt by a group of fellow-writers to force on public notice and appreciation a delicate and conscientious artist in fiction, whose merits had never been recognized as they deserved. It is sad to record that the generous undertaking failed of its purpose. Merrick was, remained, and still is an 'author's author'. (Sadleir, 1.262-3)' Among the writers contributing introductions to the works in this edition were Sir James Barrie (for 'Conrad in Search of his Youth', 1903), Sir Arthur Pinero (for 'The Position of Peggy Harper'), Neil Munro (for 'The Worldlings'), Maurice Hewlitt (for 'Cynthia, a Daughter of the Philistines', 1896), Granville Barker (for 'One Man's View', 1897), and G. K. Chesterton (for 'The House of Lynch', 1907). Each introduction stressed Merrick's craftsmanship, his use of theatrical setting, his realism, and his concern to expose fraud. A late collection of short stories, 'Four Stories' (1925), draws skilfully upon the bohemian latin quarter of Paris where Merrick spent some of his last years. He had moved there with his only daughter, Lesley, after the death of his wife in 1917, as he found it cheaper and more comfortable than London. During the late 1920s and 1930s he made several round-the-world cruises with his daughter, who left a vivid photographically illustrated account of them, in her 'A Good Time' (1936). 
H. G. Wells noted in his introduction to Merrick's 'The Quaint Companions' (1903) that the book 'is about the tragedy of racial miscegenation. It is, perhaps, the most sympathetic and understanding novel, in its intimate everyday way, about the clash of colour and race prejudice and racial quality that has ever been written in England, and its merits make its limitation of length and scope more regrettable. (Wells, ix)' Indeed it is George Orwell in his introduction to a projected 1945 reprint of 'The Position of Peggy Harper' who summed up the reason why Merrick's work failed to achieve either best-seller status or critical acclaim: his gloomy works primarily focus on artists. Yet Merrick's realism, his concern for the outsider, and his originality of plotting ensure him a permanent place in British literary history. 
From all accounts Merrick was shy and diffident, rarely seen at the Savage, his London club. His opposition to hunting seems to have been one of his few firm public stances. His hobbies were, according to his obituary in the 'New York Times', 'music, reading other persons' novels, and seeing other persons' plays'. In his 'Contemporary Portraits' Frank Harris described him as 'a small, handsome man, slight but wiry and healthy, with melancholy, dark brooding eyes, long and straight nose, and large black moustache' (Harris, 94). Merrick died in a London nursing home at 3 Courtfield Gardens on 7 August 1939 and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex. His daughter edited a posthumous collection of his short stories, 'The Leonard Merrick Omnibus' (1950).

Isaacs, Jacob (1896-1973), literary scholar, was born in London on 6 December 1896, the son of the Revd Moses David Isaacs and his wife, Jessie, daughter of the Revd Moses Bregman. Isaacs's parents were Orthodox Jews, and he was brought up in the largely Jewish East End of London and educated at the Grocers' Company's School, Hackney Downs. In 1912 Isaacs joined the civil service where he worked until 1916. From 1916 Isaacs was on active service in France as a lieutenant (Territorial Army) in the Royal Garrison Artillery. After the 1918 armistice he became area commandant and brigade education officer. Of this period of active service, 'G. H.', writing in 'The Times' after Isaacs's death, recalled that his 'talk and clowning as a young officer on the Western front solaced many a suffering fellow intellectual' (17 May 1973, 21h). 
On 29 April 1919 Isaacs matriculated as a commoner reading English at Exeter College, Oxford. As there were very few fellows at his college at the time, he was assigned an outside tutor, Herbert Francis Brett-Smith. He seems not to have participated in the sporting activities at Exeter College. In March 1921 Isaacs was proposed as a member of the college Essay Club (the subjects ranging from Sappho to Shakespeare), was elected, and attended the meeting of 18 May 1921. He received a first-class honours degree in English language and literature, and took his BA degree on 3 November 1921. His examiners were Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Arthur Quiller Couch, Professor R. W. Chambers, and the historian of the English language Professor H. C. Wyld. On 11 June 1927 Isaacs received his MA degree from Oxford University. 
In 1921 Isaacs was appointed assistant lecturer in English at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where he worked under Professor Herbert G. Wright. In 1924 Isaacs became assistant lecturer in English at King's College, University of London, and in 1928 he was promoted to lecturer. 'G. H.' recalled in 'The Times' that 'Oxford and London in the twenties knew him as a redoubtable controversialist in almost all the arts' (17 May 1973, 21h). On 15 July 1933 he married the non-Jewish Enid Austin Dickie ('b'. 1905/6), librarian, daughter of George Austin Dickie, architect; they had two daughters. In his dedication to 'An Assessment of Twentieth-Century Literature' (1951) Isaacs wrote that his wife 'comforted me with apples and stayed me with flagons'. 
In 1938, at the invitation of the Sir Moses Montefiore Commemoration Committee, Isaacs gave a highly successful series of twelve public lectures at the Mount Scopus campus of the fledgeling Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Palestine. In 1942 Isaacs was appointed the first Montefiore professor of English in the university, and he set about organizing and heading the new English department. At the end of 1945 Isaacs, his wife, and his family returned to England. Seven years later he was appointed to the chair of English language and literature at Queen Mary College, University of London. He gave his inaugural lecture, 'The nature of literary history', on 20 May 1952. Following a series of depressions Isaacs retired from the chair and in 1964 was appointed professor emeritus. 
Isaacs's productivity ranged from critical exegesis to the textual editing of plays. He was author or editor of more than thirty books and articles, his field of concentration ranging from Shakespeare and his contemporaries, with a particular focus on Elizabethan and Restoration theatrical history, to Sir George Etherege, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and twentieth-century poetry. Isaacs's strength lay in the lengthy article rather than the full-length monograph. His 'Coleridge's Critical Terminology', published as an English Association pamphlet in 1936, revealed a fine understanding both of critical theory and of Coleridge's critical importance. Isaacs's knowledge of bibliography and theatrical history was exhibited in, for instance, his 'Production and Stage-Management at the Blackfriars Theatre', a Shakespeare Association pamphlet of 1935. Professor C. L. Wrenn, with whom Isaacs worked at King's College, described Isaacs in a June 1945 testimonial as 'brilliant', noting that this was a quality 'especially displayed in [his] lectures... In King's College students of all faculties used to crowd into Mr. Isaacs' lectures as the most stimulating to minds of every kind.' Some of this brilliance was revealed in Isaacs's pioneering six BBC Third Programme broadcast lectures in 1949, published under the title 'The Background of Modern Poetry' in 1951 and appealing to a wide rather than to a university-restricted audience. The talks were marked by clarity and scholarship and interlaced with wit, humour, irony, and choice poetic citation. Isaacs clearly revealed his bias as 'a literary historian' with 'the historical point of view' (Isaacs, 'Modern Poetry', 92). Demonstrating the range of his vision and taste, he concluded with citations from the poetry of Wallace Stevens and the Anglo-Jewish poet Lazarus Aaronson, and from the criticism of his friend T. S. Eliot. 
Six lectures broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in September and October 1950 formed the foundation for Isaacs's 'An Assessment of Twentieth-Century Literature' (1951). Isaacs's subjects ranged from the first forty years of the twentieth century, to scrutiny of 'the puzzling decade of the 'forties'' (Isaacs, 'Twentieth-Century Literature', 41). A whole talk is devoted to 'T. S. Eliot and poetic drama'. Isaacs's religious Jewish upbringing and knowledge were reflected in a series of 1966 BBC Third Programme radio talks on the influence of the Hebrew 'Bible' on English literature, English translations of the 'Bible', the Jew in English literature, and the Jewish contribution to art. Isaacs's eclecticism is reflected in the range of his publications. For instance 1954 saw the publication or reprinting of his 'Sixteenth century Bible versions' and 'The Authorised Version and after' in 'The Bible in its Ancient and English Versions'; 'Dramatic criticism', an article in the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica'; radio broadcasts entitled 'Robert Frost at eighty', published in 'The Listener'; and a broadcast entitled 'The art of Peter Paul Rubens' for 'London Calling' of the BBC overseas service. Also in 1954 he gave the British Academy Shakespeare lecture, 'Shakespeare's earliest years in the theatre', and a lecture entitled 'The academy labyrinth', published in 'Art News and Review' (1954), and introduced a broadcast discussion between Robert Frost and R. Cook on Thoreau's 'Walden', published in 'The Listener'. 
Among Isaacs's other myriad interests was film criticism: he was a member of the London-based Film Society 'for which throughout the 1930s he edited, and wrote the bulk of, the unsigned programme notes' ('The Times', 25 May 1973, 20h). In a letter to Isaacs's widow on his death, R. P. Tong, the registrar and secretary of Queen Mary College, referred to Isaacs's 'wit and humour', and particularly remembered Isaacs for the 'common interest in wines' which they shared. A fuller flavour of Isaacs's personality was revealed in the memorial reminiscences in 'The Times' of 'G. H.', who noted that Isaacs: 'was for ever compiling material for what must surely prove one of the biggest and best books never written on the history of taste. Devastating as a critic, hardly ever known (and even less frequently proved) to be wrong, he went to inordinate length to help genuine students... he gave always much more than he took.' He concluded, 'the jovial, genial giant with his quietly patient corrective voice, wrongly deemed supercilious by strangers, has gone from us, leaving us the poorer for his going' ('The Times', 17 May 1973, 21h). Lord Bernstein and Ivor Montague, in a 'Times' obituary notice, referred to Isaacs as among the 'jovial sardonics' (19 May 1973, 16h). During a lengthy period of confinement to his home, Little Court, Court Yard, Eltham, London, and bed, suffering from depression, Isaacs was looked after by his beloved wife. Isaacs died at Lewisham Hospital on 12 May 1973.

Checkland, Sydney George (1916-1986), historian, was born on 9 October 1916 in Ottawa, Canada, the second of three sons of Sydney Tom Checkland (1878-1958), journalist, and his wife, Fanny Selina Savory Mason (1880-1941), recent immigrants from England. He grew up in a strict nonconformist Baptist home and, after schooling in Ottawa, began work in 1934 as a ledger clerk in the Bank of Nova Scotia. Ambition and night school earned him the associateship of the Canadian Bankers' Association in 1937, by which time he had taken a higher-paid job as accountant with the Ottawa Sanitary Laundry Company. Keeping the laundry afloat was a major challenge, but allowed him to save $250, enough to take him to England in 1938 to study for the BComm at Birmingham University under Philip Sargent Florence. He graduated in 1941 with first-class honours and was active in student affairs, having been president of the Guild of Undergraduates of the University of Birmingham (1940-41). He was also elected president of the National Union of Students in 1941 and president of the International Union of Students the following year. On 11 September 1942 he married (Edith) Olive Anthony ['see below'], a young geographer he had met at the University of Birmingham. 
In 1942 Checkland enlisted and was quickly selected for officer training, attending a six-month crash course at Sandhurst, passing out as the best cadet with the belt of honour. As such he could have chosen any British regiment for a posting, but asked to join a Canadian unit. In the interim he was assigned to the 5th battalion of the Manchester regiment before transferring, as a young lieutenant, to the governor-general's footguards with the Canadian army, now a tank regiment. As a tank commander during the Normandy landings in August 1944 he was severely wounded at Falaise, sustaining nerve damage to his legs which gave him a slight limp. 
At the end of the war brief political ambition saw Checkland stand unsuccessfully as a Common Wealth Party candidate for Sheffield Ecclesall in the general election of 1945. Then it was a return to Birmingham to study for an MComm (awarded 1946), followed immediately by his first academic post as assistant lecturer in economic science at Liverpool University. His career progressed swiftly to lecturer (1948) and senior lecturer (1949) before he was attracted to Cambridge in 1953 by Michael Postan to take up a lectureship in economic history. His early publications produced a doctoral thesis at Liverpool and focused on economic thought and science. They attracted much interest and were the foundation for the long perspective on economic change which characterized his writings, and for his transition to economic historian. Four years later, from January 1957, he was in Glasgow, recruited by Hector Hetherington, then principal and vice-chancellor, to take up the new chair and establish a new department of economic history. 
It was in Glasgow that Sydney Checkland flourished and built an international reputation of distinction in the broad areas of business, banking, and urban history. As a newcomer to Glasgow he enjoyed the quick friendship and support of Alec Macfie, Alec Cairncross, Donald Robertson, and other newcomers, Alec Nove and Tom Wilson. This distinguished group of economists enjoyed and cultivated an exciting intellectual environment in which they promoted the growth of social sciences in the 1960s. Checkland quickly established links with the local business community to found the Colquhoun lectureship in business history in 1959, the first such post in Britain. From this initiative there grew the Business Archives Council (Scotland) and the beginnings of the unrivalled regional business archive in the University of Glasgow, thus saving for future generations the record of business and commerce of industrial Scotland. This also developed links with HM Register House (the Scottish Records Office) and with the National Register of Archives (Scotland), of which he became chairman in 1971. 
Under Checkland's leadership his young department grew rapidly, mirroring his research interests in its development. His first decade in Glasgow also produced his first two books, his highly individualistic text 'The Rise of Industrial Society in England, 1815-1885' (1964) and a fine business history, 'The Mines of Tharsis: Roman, French and British Enterprise in Spain' (1967). The next ten years produced a further three books, his biography 'The Gladstones: a Family Biography, 1764-1851' (1971) receiving the Scottish Arts Council book award. In 1975 his monumental study 'Scottish Banking: a History, 1695-1973' (1975) won the Saltire Society prize; this was quickly followed by an influential study of Glasgow, 'The Upas Tree, Glasgow, 1875-1975, a Study in Growth and Contraction' (1976). His scholarly contributions were deservedly recognized in his election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1977, and to the fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1979. 
Such active scholarship did not prevent Checkland from taking an active and leading role in his university and in the local community. He served on the university court and other major committees and was influential in establishing, in 1976, the new faculty of social sciences. In the difficult years of urban change in central Scotland, he also served as a board member (1964-8) of the East Kilbride Development Corporation. In the wider academic community he was active in the Social Science Research Council and was chairman of its industry and employment committee from 1982 to 1984. He was also president of the Economic History Society from 1977 to 1980. 
While the major part of his career was spent in Glasgow, Checkland travelled widely, twice being a member of the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, and spent periods at Monash University and the Australian National University, and at Queen's University, Kingston, and the University of Alberta. Between 1977 and 1984 he made four extended visits to Japan where he and Olive Checkland developed a strong research interest in the Japanese-Scottish connection. Throughout these years he also maintained a base in Cambridge, returning there on his retirement from Glasgow in 1982. In his final years he produced his major study of British economic and social policy, 'British Public Policy, 1776-1939' (1983), and jointly with Olive Checkland 'Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1882-1914' (1984). His final work, 'The Elgins: a Tale of Aristocrats and Proconsuls' (1988), was brought to publication by Olive Checkland after his death. 
Sydney Checkland was one of the most distinguished economic and social historians of his generation, his work pioneering and promoting the disciplines of business, banking, and urban history in Britain. He was the most civilized, generous, and urbane of men, wearing his intellect lightly and with reserve. While he made his career in Scotland and spent his adult life in Britain, he remained Canadian at heart until the end. He captured this in a sensitive autobiography, 'Voices across the Water: an Anglo-Canadian Boyhood' (1989) also brought to publication by Olive Checkland. He died at Cambridge on 22 March 1986.

Blunt, Alfred Walter Frank (1879-1957), bishop of Bradford, was born in St Malo, France, on 24 September 1879, son of Francis Theophilus Blunt (1837-1881) of the colonial service and his wife, Emily Ellen Hobart Rainsford (died 1911). The second of two sons, with three older half-siblings from a previous marriage, he was educated by his mother after his father's death in 1881, and then at Church Hill preparatory school at Crondall, near Farnham. In 1893 he went to Marlborough College, and then studied classics at Exeter College, Oxford (1897-1901). He studied education for a term before teaching at Wellington College (1902) and taking up a classical fellowship and tutorship at Exeter College. He attended Cuddesdon Theological College, where he was ordained in 1904, and took up a curacy at St John the Evangelist, Carrington, Nottingham, in 1907. Here he ministered energetically to an industrial parish, distinguished himself as an accomplished preacher, and arrived at the conviction, which he held for the rest of his life, that 'The Gospel is intended both for individual redemption and for social amelioration' (Peart-Binns, 50), a statement which explains both his Christian socialism and his willingness to support controversial causes such as women's suffrage. At Carrington, too, under the influence of his bishop, Edwyn Hoskyns, he acquired an enduring sense of the catholicity of the church, and of its relevance to every aspect of individual and social life, and began to publish his first books on the 'New Testament'. On 20 October 1909 he married Margaret (Maggie) Catherine Duke, the daughter of a doctor in the Indian Medical Service. 
In 1917 Blunt was appointed vicar of St Werburgh's, Derby, another industrial slum parish. He was offered the bishopric of Worcester in 1930, and after a lively correspondence with the then prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, about the episcopal residence, Hartlebury Castle, which he regarded as 'a white elephant' (Binns, 83), he refused the offer for private reasons and was appointed bishop of Bradford in 1931. As bishop he appealed to a broad Anglicanism which was both traditionalist and progressive, even-handedly encouraging the Anglo-Catholics in the diocese and reversing some of the strictness of his evangelical predecessor, acting as president of an Anglo-Catholic congress in Bradford in 1934. He continued to prefer ministry in the slums and youth work to convocation or church assembly meetings. A member of the Christian Social Union since 1907, and a member of the Labour Party since the general strike (1926), Blunt paid unofficial visits to factories and preached widely on unemployment, presiding over clergy conferences on the subject in 1933. He told the diocesan conference in 1936 that 'The Church must preach to the rich of the 'deceitfulness of riches'' (Peart-Binns, 178-9), arousing a chorus of protests from tory MPs. Blunt was the author of a number of books. Works such as 'The Faith of the Catholic Church' (1936), 'Our Need of God' (1937), and 'What the Church Teaches' (1942) embodied his social and religious concerns. 
The rejection of the 1928 prayer book affected him deeply, confirming his belief in the spiritual autonomy of the church and convincing him of the virtues of disestablishment. It was this conviction which made him the centre of controversy, when, on 1 December 1936, he addressed the Bradford diocesan conference on the coronation of Edward VIII. Bishop Barnes of Birmingham had suggested that there should be no communion service at the coronation in order to allow nonconformists to participate; Blunt argued 'To allow such another measure of covert piecemeal disestablishment is to make the worst of both worlds -- to retain the invidiousness, such as it is, of the name of establishment, while losing one by one every item of reality which the term connotes, and abandoning without defence any claim which we may make to have a contribution of spiritual grace to offer to the acts of the State. (Peart-Binns, 275)' He added that the sacramental effectiveness of the coronation depended, among other things, 'on the faith, prayer and self-dedication of the King himself; and on that it would be improper for me to say anything except to commend him... to God's grace... We hope that he is aware of his need. Some of us wish that he gave more positive signs of such awareness. (ibid., 277)' Blunt's speech was a plea for the church to accept the spiritual responsibilities, rather than merely the privileges, conferred upon it by establishment at a time when 'Our civilization is in a tottering and unstable condition' (ibid., 278), but his statement unfortunately coincided with revelations in the press about the king's affair with Mrs Simpson, and was widely interpreted as a veiled allusion to it. The king himself regarded Blunt's statement as 'the spark that caused the explosion' (duke of Windsor, 349). 
When Sir Richard Acland proposed to the Malvern conference (which brought together 400 Anglican priests and laity in 1941) that the church should condemn 'the present form of private ownership as a stumbling block to the Christian way of life', Blunt was vocal in his support, and when the Beveridge report was published in 1943, he urged the convocation of York to welcome it as a positive solution to problems of poverty and unemployment. In answer to those who accused him of meddling in politics, he responded 'that in the last two centuries the churches in England (and elsewhere) have largely been content to preach only part of the gospel of Christ. They have preached conversion to individuals; they have not preached the Kingdom of God to society. Christ preached both. (Peart-Binns, 187)' He had continued to move to the left politically, advocating communism in wartime, while being deeply critical of the Russian variety of it, leading the 'Church Times' editor, Sydney Dark, to praise him as the 'most courageous Churchman of our time', while arousing the indignation of Lord Vansittart. A firm opponent of appeasement and an advocate of British rearmament during the late 1930s, Blunt rejected pacifism, but was also rigidly opposed to the hate campaigns of Vansittartism. In response to a series of broadcasts by Vansittart, later published as 'Black Record', he remarked, 'It would be easy to write a similar Black Record of Britain which would prove that our policy had been sympathetically one of economic grab and exploitation, and that, if the Germans are 'butcher birds', the British are harpies' (ibid., 204). 
From 1931 onwards Blunt suffered from a series of nervous illnesses which led him to proclaim that 'Life is crucifixion' (Peart-Binns, 242). The perfectionism with which he regarded preaching and liturgy, combined with the constant controversy engendered by his political activism, both took their toll. In 1955 he was compelled to retire after a stroke. His health continued to decline and he died in York on 2 June 1957 and was buried at Calverley. He was survived by his wife. His ministry had been marked by a sincerity which at times made his surname seem singularly appropriate, and while this may have cost him ecclesiastical preferment, it was also true that his faith was thoroughly in keeping with his rebellious nature: 'It is not supreme law which we worship, but God. It is not the Christian character which we imitate, but Christ. And it is in relation to this fact that Christianity justifies itself' (ibid., 66).

Lindsay, Norah Mary Madeleine (1873-1948), gardener, the second child of Major the Hon. Edward Roden Bourke (1835-1907), and his wife, Emma Mary Augusta Hatch (1853-1935), was born in India in April 1873. The family, with three children under three years, returned to London in the following year, to live in a house in Montagu Square, and then at 25 Great Cumberland Place. Here Norah Bourke was educated by governesses and made her debut in society, becoming celebrated for her beauty and her musical skill, especially her piano-playing. On 27 April 1895 she married a dashing soldier, Henry Edith Arthur Lindsay, the 29-year-old grandson of the twenty-fifth earl of Crawford and the younger brother of Violet Lindsay (1856-1937) ['see 'Manners, (Marion Margaret) Violet, duchess of Rutland], a talented artist and the 'angel of the Souls'. The Lindsays were given, as a wedding present from a family friend, Lord Wantage, the manor house at Sutton Courtenay, on the banks of the Thames in Oxfordshire. Their children, Nancy Robina Winifred and David Ludovic Peter, were born in 1896 and 1900 respectively; soon after Norah Lindsay became interested in her garden. She was a romantic figure in enormous hats tied with chiffon and long pale dresses draped with lovely pearls, but she was also a seriously knowledgeable gardener, learning from practical work pruning, planting, and tying. The long, low, and romantic old manor house looked out onto two large garden 'rooms', the Long Garden and the Persian (or Jewel) Garden, side by side but screened from each other by high walls, covered in luxuriant roses, jasmines, and clematis. In a gardening society enthralled by Gertrude Jekyll's long drifts of single kinds of plants, Norah Lindsay led a revolt: allowing self-set seedlings to stay, she created bounteous jungles of mixed flowers, all contained and controlled by elephantine but low box hedges and carefully clipped yew sentinels. 
During the First World War Colonel Lindsay worked with the Red Cross; subsequently he used his taste and knowledge of antique furniture to become a peripatetic dealer and adviser, apparently returning to the manor house only on rare occasions. Mrs Lindsay refined her garden in the 1920s, adding a wild garden beside the river. It was described in detail in 'Country Life' magazine on 16 May 1931, in a piece which she herself wrote, a privilege rarely accorded to owners. Advised by her friend Nancy Astor, she began to charge for garden consultancy among rich friends: she inaugurated this professional career by 'dressing' the Astors' gardens at Cliveden for Ascot house parties, and arranging planting schemes for country house owners including Philip Sassoon at Port Lympne and Trent Park, Philip Lothian at Blickling Hall, and the Russells at Mottisfont Abbey. Her skill became legendary, and was admired by Christopher Hussey and jealously regarded by Vita Sackville West. In particular, her use of colour, including one-colour gardens or strident contrasts, and her way of constructing a mounded or pyramidal form on perfectly flat land, commanded applause. Her greatest gardening friendship was during the 1930s with Lawrence Johnston: their shared gardening tastes brought the planting of Johnston's garden at Hidcote Manor to its best just at the beginning of the Second World War. By the end of the war Johnston wished to retire to his garden in France and leave Hidcote Manor to Mrs Lindsay, who was now forced to sell the manor house at Sutton Courtenay, following her husband's death in 1939. When Norah Lindsay died suddenly on 20 June 1948, at her London home, Flat 410, Carrington House, Hertford Street, Westminster, Hidcote Manor was taken over by the National Trust; Sutton Courtenay was purchased by David Astor.

Wolseley, Frances Garnet, Viscountess Wolseley (1872-1936), gardener and author, was born on 15 September 1872 at 118 Belgrave Road, Pimlico, London, the only child of Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley (1833-1913), later Baron Wolseley of Cairo and Viscount Wolseley, commander-in-chief of the British army, and his wife, Louisa Erskine (1843-1920). She had the peripatetic childhood that befalls a soldier's daughter, with frequently changing homes in comfortable suburban villas, including The Limes, Mortlake, and Aylesford House, Wimbledon, and a consequently erratic private education. For her seventh Christmas she was taken to Cyprus, where her father was 'en route' to the Anglo-Zulu War, while her tenth birthday was celebrated with the news of his victory at Tell al-Kebir -- he sent her a visiting card found in Arabi Pasha's tent (having promised her the tip of the rebel's nose). In the spring of 1885 mother and daughter travelled to Cairo to join Lord Wolseley, and returned via Florence, Venice, and Paris. 
Frances Wolseley was very much her father's daughter, resembling him in her short stature, smart dress, and brisk manner; she matured early into the role of tactful companion and chaperone to the sociable Lady Wolseley. Although she enjoyed her season as a debutante in 1891, privately she preferred a country life with horses and dogs. This became a reality in 1899, when the family settled at Trevor House, at Glynde in Sussex, and she was able to indulge her interest in gardening. Aiming to equip the daughters of middle-class families to earn their own livings, in 1902 she started courses in gardening and design for young women in the walled garden at Trevor House; by 1907 the Glynde College for Lady Gardeners was proving such a success that it had to be moved to a 5 acre teaching garden, with student accommodation, at Ragged Lands, just outside Glynde village. Frances Wolseley's two-year course set the highest standard and enjoyed the patronage of such distinguished gardeners as Gertrude Jekyll, Ellen Willmott, and William Robinson. In November 1909 the college students were featured in 'Country Life' for their work building and planting the garden of the King Edward VII Sanatorium at Midhurst, which had been designed by Gertrude Jekyll. 
While leaving the day-to-day work of the college in the care of graduates Elsa More and Mary Campion, Frances Wolseley pursued a wider campaign with her book 'Gardening for Women' (1908), which suggested many ways in which women could help with the revival of the countryside economy and rural industries. She toured the country to inspect and publicize thriving enterprises in market gardening, the horticultural colleges at Swanley and Studley, and other institutions running similar courses, and private gardens where women demonstrated responsible management. She also visited South Africa and Canada, showing particular interest in the Canadian women's institutes and their adoption in Britain. She was elected to the Worshipful Company of Gardeners of the City of London in 1913, and became Viscountess Wolseley upon the death of her father the same year. 
From 1913 to 1921 Frances Wolseley lived with her mother at Massetts Place, near Lindfield: here she continued her campaign through articles and letters, culminating in her most important book, 'Women on the Land' (1916), which explained the organization of smallholdings, market co-operatives, women's institutes, and gardening for schools. She also wrote 'In a College Garden' (1916) to explain exactly the principles and practice of the Glynde College, which prospered until the death of the principal, Elsa More, just after the First World War. In 1919 'Gardens, their Form and Design' appeared, a radical analysis of the subject for that time, describing the role of the artist-gardener and setting out much of the theory for what was to be the new profession of landscape architecture a decade before the foundation of the Institute of Landscape Architects. After the death of her mother in 1920 Lady Wolseley moved to Culpepers, Ardingly, Sussex, and devoted her last years to local history research; she published 'Some of the Smaller Manor Houses of Sussex' in 1925. She died on 24 December 1936 at Culpepers and was buried at St Andrew's, Beddingham. In her will she left her collections of books and papers to Hove corporation, together with funds for the improvement of the library and the establishment of a Wolseley room; Hove Library special collections retain this material, as well as additional material relating to the life of her father.

Johnston, Lawrence Waterbury (1871-1958), garden designer and plantsman, was born in Paris on 17 October 1871, the elder son of Elliott Johnston (1826-1901), a member of a well-connected banking family from Baltimore, Maryland, and his wife, Gertrude Cleveland Waterbury (1845-1926), an equally well-connected heiress from New York city. He was brought up mainly in France, where his mother preferred to live; after her divorce from his father his mother married, in London in 1887, a New York banker, Charles Francis Winthrop (1827-1898). Gertrude Winthrop, a New York socialite, dominated her son's life. In 1893 Johnston came to England to Little Shelford, near Cambridge, where he became a pupil of a Mr J. Dunn and prepared to enter the university. In June 1894 he entered Trinity College as a pensioner; he matriculated at Michaelmas of that year and graduated BA in 1897. He had enjoyed the friendships that Cambridge afforded, and one of his friends encouraged him to study farming at New Etal, Northumberland. In 1900 he became a British citizen in order to serve as a private in the South African War, and later received a commission in the Northumberland Hussars. 
By 1904, when he was elected a fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, Lawrence Johnston was again living at Little Shelford. In 1907 Mrs Winthrop bought the small estate of Hidcote Bartrim, near Broadway in the Cotswolds. It was Johnston's nature to study thoroughly and master his interests, and he turned first to architecture in order to restore the Hidcote Manor house and buildings, and then to garden design for the enlargement of the garden. In appearance he was small and militarily smart, combining a shy and reserved manner with birdlike energy; he loved to paint and play tennis and was welcomed into Broadway society by the artist Alfred Parsons and the American actress Mary Anderson de Navarro; he also formed links with many of the distinguished local gardening fraternity. From 1907 to 1914 Johnston set about the restoration of the old garden at Hidcote, enclosing adjoining fields to create wide vistas to the west and south and planting hedges of every variety to form small sheltered 'rooms'. Although he was nearly forty-three when the war started in 1914 he went to the western front as a major in the hussars: he later told his friend Alvilde Lees-Milne how he was wounded and left for dead until the officer of the burial party recognized him and saw him move. He was invalided home in October 1914 but returned to France in 1916 and continued to serve as an officer with the Northumberland regiment until he retired in November 1922 on reaching the age limit. 
While continuing to develop his garden at Hidcote Manor (with his head gardener, Frank H. Adams, from 1922 until 1939) Johnston also acquired a French property in a valley near Menton, La Serre de la Madone, where the winters were spent for the sake of Mrs Winthrop's health. She died in 1926, releasing Johnston to pursue his plant hunting in South America, South Africa, and the Far East. In 1930 Hidcote Manor garden was featured in two articles in 'Country Life', which showed the well-grown structure of hedges and avenues of beech, holly, hornbeam, and yew and exhibited Johnston's wisdom in planning and planting them all so carefully. During the 1930s he concentrated upon filling the garden rooms with a lavish collection of rare and beautiful flowers and shrubs, his tastes and enthusiasms being shared with his closest gardening friend of those years, Norah Lindsay. Having escaped from Menton in 1940 just before Italian forces entered the town, Johnston returned to Hidcote. He maintained the garden throughout the Second World War, but it was still known to only a comparative few outside the horticultural world. However, it attracted much attention when Johnston announced that he wished to retire to his French home for the sake of his health, leaving Hidcote Manor to Mrs Lindsay. She died suddenly in 1948, and it was largely because of support by Vita Sackville-West that the National Trust acquired Hidcote Manor on behalf of the nation, entirely on the merit of the garden. This followed a public appeal for funds to preserve some of Britain's finest gardens, launched by the National Trust and the Royal Horticultural Society in June 1948. Hidcote was the first garden to be saved under this scheme and Johnston signed the deed in August 1948. 
Johnston never married, and remained a devout Roman Catholic throughout his life. After leaving Hidcote, he moved to La Serre de la Madone, where he died on 27 April 1958. He was buried in Mickleton churchyard, near Hidcote Manor, alongside his mother. His garden in Hidcote, maintained to his design and with many of his favourite planting schemes, is now regarded as one of the most influential of twentieth-century gardens, of enduring appeal and inspiration as a network of small private garden rooms. It became one of the most visited of British gardens.

Dudley Adams (1762-1830), the youngest child of George senior and his second wife, was not quite ten years old when his father died. In 1777 he was apprenticed to his brother George to train as a mathematical instrument maker. Ten years later he married a widow, Margaret Sophia de Langlade, at St Marylebone parish church. To enable him to establish a separate business his mother gave him the globe plates and tools that had belonged to his father, and in mid-1788 he opened a shop at 53 Charing Cross. Here he concentrated on globe making but also sold all types of mathematical instruments. In 1794, possibly as a result of supplying some 28 in. globes for Lord Macartney's mission to China, he was appointed globe maker to George III. 
On the death of his brother in August 1795 Dudley immediately secured the ordnance appointment for himself. In July 1796, having ousted Hannah from 60 Fleet Street, he moved there. He seems to have been a poor businessman: in 1806 he lost the ordnance trade to Matthew Berge, Jesse Ramsden's successor. In 1810 he reissued his father's obsolete 'Treatise on the Globes', absurdly calling it the '30th' edition. In May 1817 he was adjudged bankrupt, and the Adams instrument business, founded in 1734, came to an end. 
Dudley's assets were dispersed in a series of auction sales between July and September 1817. They included the freehold premises at 60 Fleet Street and a country estate called Nutting Grove in Buckinghamshire. The sale particulars suggest that he had been living well beyond his means. By 1820 he had purchased the 'medico-electrical therapeutics' business of the late Francis Lowndes in St Paul's Churchyard, located from 1822 at 22 Ludgate Street. He continued this until 1827 or later, publishing several tracts on the subject, such as 'Electricity is the Fountain, the Great Vivifying Principle of Nature' (1820), against considerable opposition from the orthodox medical faculty. His tracts and minimal surviving correspondence indicate that during the 1820s his mental state gradually deteriorated, and it is probable that he died insane. He was buried in St Bride's churchyard, Fleet Street, on 20 March 1830, aged sixty-seven. 
Dudley's wife died in 1801. Guild records reveal that they had a son George, apprenticed in 1811, but as no further trace of him has been found it is presumed that he died before completing his apprenticeship. Lack of an heir may have been what caused Dudley to neglect his business, leading to his bankruptcy. A portrait of him by Ramsay Reinagle is mentioned in the will of his elder sister Isabella but has not been traced. Isabella died shortly after Dudley in 1830, when the surname Adams in this particular dynasty died out.

Luckes, Eva Charlotte Ellis (1854-1919), nurse, was born in Exeter, Devon, on 8 July 1854, the eldest of at least three daughters of Henry Richard Luckes (1830/31-1884), banker, of the National Provincial Bank, Exeter, and later a manager of the Gloucestershire Banking Company at Ross and Coleford, and his wife, Charlotte Mortimer, 'nee' Ellis (1831/2-1894). After schooling at Malvern and at Cheltenham Ladies' College she lived at home with her family at Riverdale, Newnham, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, where she assisted her mother with the management of the household. She also visited the sick in the parish, developing an early interest in nursing. 
Luckes began training as a nurse at the Middlesex Hospital, London, as a lady probationer in 1876, but poor health obliged her to leave after three months. She resumed nurse training at the Westminster Hospital, where the matron, Elizabeth Merryweather, had introduced a system of nursing that had proved successful when introduced (by Merryweather and her sister, Mary) at Liverpool Royal Infirmary. After she completed the Westminster training course in 1878 her first appointment was as night sister at the London Hospital. She then spent a short period as lady superintendent of the Manchester General Hospital for Sick Children, Pendlebury. According to her critics Luckes's departure from Pendlebury resulted from her having clashed with the hospital's medical staff over her attempts to reform the standard of nurse training there and establish what was termed 'nursing despotism' ('Nursing Record', 9 March 1893). She returned to London, nursing at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street. 
On 27 July 1880 Luckes was appointed matron of the London Hospital, which with 790 beds was the largest general hospital in England. Situated in Whitechapel in the East End of London, the hospital served a poor, ethnically diverse, and rapidly rising population. Aged only twenty-six, she was the youngest of the five candidates for the post, but she impressed the hospital's house committee by her clear vision of what she wanted to achieve. 
The hospital had opened a nurse training school in 1873 and under her predecessor, Annie Swift, some improvements had been made. Committee members were eager to see nursing further improved, and having determined that the matron must herself be a trained nurse they forced the retirement of Swift, who was untrained. On taking up her position Luckes informed the house committee that the nursing staff was inadequate both in number and in quality and began a campaign to improve nurses' living and working conditions. The committee agreed to increase the nursing staff to 150 and to engage ward maids, who relieved nurses of the burden of scrubbing tables and floors. Regular off-duty periods were introduced, together with recreation facilities, such as a nurses' library. 
One of Luckes's first recommendations was that lockers be installed in the children's wards so that each child could have a separate towel and flannel to reduce the risk of contagion. She also urged the improvement of the diet of nurses and took greater responsibility for their food. Accommodation was also inadequate: sisters still slept in rooms between the wards they managed, and night and day nurses often alternately used the same attic beds, while there was only one bath for the nursing staff. She persuaded the committee to build a new nurses' home, opened in 1887, with separate rooms for over 100 nurses and bathrooms on every floor. 
Luckes was determined to recruit and train her own staff whenever possible. Such a course was likely to make her enemies. She also insisted on retraining those applicants for nursing posts at the London who had trained elsewhere. To facilitate recruitment the hospital's nursing committee had suggested a two-year nurse training programme, in place of the previous three years. She held to this arrangement; after 1900 probationer contracts stipulated that a further two years on the staff should be served before a training certificate was issued. When three-year hospital training courses became the norm in other hospitals this arrangement at the London was much criticized by Luckes's opponents. Recruitment did not improve, and by 1884 she suggested recruiting 'paying probationers', not under contract, who would follow short training courses and would have to be offered better living conditions. These probationers paid the hospital for their training while working free of charge, thus providing valuable income for the charity as well as saving money on staff wages. Between 1884 and 1915 well over a thousand paying probationers worked at the hospital, several hundred of whom went on to become regular, non-paying probationers under contract. 
Luckes saw the importance of theoretical training and in 1881 she started giving lectures to the probationers, augmented by lectures by such members of the medical and surgical staff as Andrew Clark and Frederick Treves. The subjects taught included elementary physiology and anatomy and medical and surgical nursing. Examinations for probationers were introduced in 1882, prizes were awarded, and certificates of training presented by the hospital's president, the duke of Cambridge. By 1884 she had developed her lectures sufficiently to publish a collection of them entitled 'Lectures on General Nursing'. Retitled 'General Nursing' in 1898, the book went into many editions and was translated into French (1903) and German (1906). Acknowledging that it was not the first modern nursing textbook, she claimed in the preface to the first edition: 'my sole object has been to collect as much practical information as possible, and place it before those studying the matter as simply as I could'. The book discouraged nurses from indulging in 'amateur doctoring', which recommended it to 'The Lancet', though the 'British Medical Journal' questioned whether the author's moral exhortations on matters of manner and conduct would be welcomed by all readers. 
Luckes also started giving two lectures each year to sisters. Her book 'Hospital Sisters and their Duties' (1886) went into several editions up to 1912. One of the first books to be published on the subjects of nursing management and nursing education, it provided advice on the management of hospital wards, the ward manager's relationship with her nurse subordinates, patients, and visitors, and on probationer training. The emphasis was on the sisters' responsibility for the care of individual patients and their role as the public face of the nursing department. Some reviewers pointed to the book's utility as a guide for the heads of households while others noted -- as they had with her previous book -- the stress the author placed on strength of character. Surviving correspondence with her readers indicates that she enjoyed a wide and enthusiastic readership in many parts of the world. 
In 1886 Luckes initiated a private nursing institution, attached to the London Hospital, to provide better-off patients with nursing in their own homes. It was one of the first such institutions attached to a teaching hospital. Initially it had a staff of forty nurses; by 1914 the private staff numbered 284, making this the largest such institution in Britain. As the reputation of the London's private staff grew, the demand for its nurses always exceeded supply: by 1914 the institution was refusing an average of sixty cases a week. In her early years as matron Luckes took a personal role in the selection of private nurses to attend each case, and was eager to find women who could adapt to any kind of social situation to which they might be posted. 
Luckes's policy of allowing probationers in their second year of training to attend private cases was especially criticized by the 'Nursing Record', a radical nursing journal that supported the aims of the British Nurses' Association, of which the 'Record''s proprietor, Ethel Gordon Fenwick, was a founder. Although the nurses at the London Hospital had received a year of instruction on the wards, had attended lectures, and taken examinations, they were, it was claimed, still untrained as their certificate of training had not been awarded. Hospitals like St Bartholomew's, where Fenwick had been matron, were increasing their length of training to three years and some advocates of longer nurse training also promoted the institution of a state register of nurses. In response Luckes circulated a paper, 'What will trained nurses gain from joining the British Nurses' Association?' (1889), which prompted a series of vituperative editorials in the 'Nursing Record'. In 1889 and 1890 there were also press allegations, citing the testimony of a former chaplain, Tristram Valentine, that the London Hospital overworked its nurses, which Luckes refuted in her evidence over several days to a House of Lords select committee on metropolitan hospitals (1890). The select committee's report, issued in 1892, found the charges against her unsubstantiated or exaggerated. Persistent attacks on Luckes's working record served to make her staff rally around her all the more and many of them remained fiercely loyal to her for the rest of her life, but she found the experience 'truly terrible' (transcript of letter to Florence Nightingale, 20 Dec 1890, Luckes papers, Royal London Hospital archives, PP/LUC/1/24). 
Luckes described her methods in an article, 'Trained nursing at the London Hospital', in the 'New Review' (October 1890). It attracted the attention of Florence Nightingale, who began a regular correspondence that lasted until at least 1898. To Luckes nursing was an art, implying that one could be a born nurse, in the same way that one could be born with a gift for music or painting. It was important that the nurse acquire knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and pathology, but she must also be aware of the doctor's role in diagnosing and prescribing, and to confine herself to efficiently carrying out the doctor's orders. Her role was to observe, report on, and take care of the patient. Technical knowledge, while important, should not displace the humanitarian side of the work. In the preface to the second edition (1898) of 'General Nursing' she wrote, 'There is a danger at the present day that the fact that nursing is an Art may be lost sight of, and work which affords some of the most beautiful qualities of which human nature is capable may thus be degraded into a mere 'Profession''. 
Luckes became the first matron in England to open a preliminary training school, in an old house in Bow, given by Lord Tredegar, the school being renamed Tredegar House. The concept of a preliminary training school, where prospective probationer nurses could follow academic studies for a few weeks, in advance of going onto the hospital wards, had first been introduced at Glasgow Royal Infirmary in 1893. Luckes, who was anxious to soften the ordeal of the first beginnings of hospital life, admitted the first twenty-five probationers to the preliminary training school in June 1895. Her scheme involved a seven-week intensive residential course as a pupil probationer prior to becoming a probationer. An early entrant to the preliminary training school (in 1896) had been Edith Cavell, who went to Belgium in 1907 to direct what became an international nurse training school. In June 1912 Queen Alexandra opened the new Tredegar House, a purpose-built preliminary training school on the site of the original house. 
To coincide with the opening of the preliminary training school Luckes designed a new nurse's uniform, in consultation with Frederick Treves, who had written on the dangers of the fashion for tight lacing and its effect on the internal organs. The new cotton uniform allowed comparative freedom of movement, constituted 'rational' dress, could be laundered at high temperature, and had removable lower sleeves that allowed for bare arms when nursing on the ward (thereby helping to reduce infection). Trained staff henceforth wore a similar design to that worn by probationers, the only difference between ranks being dress colour and apron and cap design. 
In 1896 Luckes acquired an important ally in Sydney Holland, later second Viscount Knutsford, whose energy and reforming zeal transformed the hospital over the next thirty-five years. Already chairman of the Poplar Hospital for Accidents, he sought her advice about taking up an important administrative post at a London teaching hospital, and she suggested that he seek the chairmanship of the London, to which he was elected. He perceived that the priority lay with raising the hospital's income and by the time of his death he had raised $6 million to transform it into one of the best equipped of the time. 
In 1899, during the South African War, Luckes was asked by Alexandra, princess of Wales, to provide six sisters and nurses willing to go out to nurse some of the war casualties. These were sent and the next year a further twenty nurses volunteered. Ethel Hope Becher (1867-1948) won the Royal Red Cross during the conflict and went on to help reorganize army nursing, together with another 'old Londoner' who also went to South Africa, Maud McCarthy. At the turn of the century Luckes also instituted regular 'at homes' for past and present Londoner nurses. These were held on Tuesday evenings at her flat, between 7 and 9 p.m. New probationers would be constantly surprised that the matron knew particular details about their background, interests, and present duties. She achieved this through meticulous record keeping, as in a series of 'official ward books' begun in 1901, in which she entered details reported to her by ward sisters about the progress, or otherwise, of probationers and patients. She created a remarkable series of records of her nurses and their work, often pithy and insightful, which were continued by her successors (two of whom she trained). 
Following the passing of the 'Midwives Act' in 1902 Luckes opened (in 1905) a training school for midwives, having already instituted a training course in Swedish massage (a forerunner of physiotherapy) for nurses. Other nurses were involved in radiological and radio-therapeutic work in the hospital's new X-ray and Finsen light departments. Sickroom cookery was also taught, examinations set, and a diet kitchen -- under matron's control -- was opened at the hospital in 1901. In 1905, in recognition of her quarter-century of service as matron, the London Hospital named a large new nurses' home and training facility after her. 
In April 1905 Luckes gave evidence to the select committee on the registration of nurses. She was the only nurse whose evidence opposed registration, a position she shared with Sydney Holland, who was also a witness, and she was seen as aligning herself with the hospital administrators. Her position as an anti-registrationist was controversial at the time, and remains so. Her argument was that registration would sanction lower standards than those enforced at leading training schools like the London Hospital. Certification by the state would place undue weight upon theoretical technical knowledge, tested by written examination, at the expense of the range of abilities (and especially personal qualities) that nurses needed to possess, and that the training schools alone could identify. She feared that the excellence that the training at the London Hospital unquestionably represented would be reduced to the level of that provided in the schools of nursing attached to workhouse infirmaries, which had no operating theatres or casualty departments and offered minimal medical care. She followed Nightingale, who had warned that registration would 'stereotype mediocrity'. Moreover, state registration would undermine the authority of the matron, who exercised control over the system of internal certification. On the other side of the argument Fenwick led those who regarded registration as the panacea that would raise the standard of nursing; and the select committee reported in favour of registration, but though several bills were introduced, none passed until December 1919, when a voluntary register came into being. 
In 1915 the former Guy's Hospital matron Sarah Swift and the Conservative politician Arthur Stanley promoted the idea of a college of nursing, modelled on the royal colleges of the medical profession, to organize nurses and standardize training. They were concerned that the influx of Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) and other partially trained workers employed in nursing during the First World War would harm the interests of trained nurses. Luckes acknowledged the desire of Stanley in particular to promote the welfare of nurses, but opposed the scheme he and Swift had circulated to hospital governors in December 1915. She wrote to Swift in January 1916 that wartime conditions made it an inopportune moment to open such controversial questions (McGann, Crowther, and Dougall, 12). Luckes believed that the VAD nurses' experiences would show them the wisdom of obtaining a proper training and that they would 'bring back a wholesome element into the nursing profession' that would combat 'the growing spirit of trades unionism which is so unadapted to nurses and so much to be deplored' (Luckes, 'Reasons'). Despite Luckes's opposition, the College of Nursing was founded in April 1916. 
Luckes was said to have lived for the London Hospital, maintaining a punishing routine of long days, starting at 7.30 a.m. and often going on until 11 or 12 at night. The war years were difficult for her, as her workload rose through her training of field ambulance men for the Royal Army Medical Corps. Hospital wards were occupied by wounded servicemen, and war service overseas deprived her of many of her best nurses. Her final years were interspersed with short breaks at Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, but even there she would have a shorthand writer or assistant to get through her daily pile of registration and correspondence. During her final years she suffered from arthritis, diabetes, and deteriorating eyesight. She was obliged to use a wheelchair, to spend long periods in bed, and to rely on dictation rather than conducting her correspondence in her own hand. She was nursed by the head of her private staff, Thyra Larsen, whom she named in her will as her residuary legatee. 
Luckes was awarded the Royal Red Cross and the CBE in 1917, and in 1913 became the first nurse after Florence Nightingale to be awarded the Lady of Grace Order of St John of Jerusalem. She died, in post, at the London Hospital, Whitechapel Road, London, on 16 February 1919. Her body was cremated at Golders Green crematorium and her ashes interred, behind a plaque made by Kathleen Bruce Scott, at St Philip's Church, Whitechapel (now a medical library and the museum of the hospital). The plaque carries the epitaph she chose herself, 'She loved much'. 
Already by 1892 Luckes was regarded as an exemplar of nursing, and so described by her pupil Honnor Morten, who related how Luckes had left a luxurious home to take up nursing in order to be useful in the world (H. Morten, 'How to Become a Nurse', 1892, 147). Florence Nightingale described her as 'Matron of Matrons' (Nightingale to Luckes, 22 Jan 1891, Luckes papers, Royal London Hospital archives, PP/LUC/1/4), training women who instituted her methods of nursing and hospital management all over the world. Her 'Matron's annual letters', which she spent much of her leisure time compiling, list nurses occupying positions of responsibility on every continent. Her books were easy to understand, widely read, and influential. Many of the records she compiled are preserved in the Royal London Hospital archives and continue to provide valuable insights into nursing and medical history. 
Ernest Morris, who as hospital house governor helped her achieve some of her personal aims, described her as 'true to her vision' ('The Hospital', 22 Feb 1919). Her relentless critic Ethel Gordon Fenwick wrote of her 'foreign psychology' not endearing her to her 'British subordinates' ('British Journal of Nursing', 22 Feb 1919), a description calculated to stir up xenophobic feelings and to remind Fenwick's readers that Luckes had ceased signing her surname with an umlaut during the First World War in an effort to make her name appear less Germanic. Nurse registration, which Luckes had always opposed, was introduced soon after her death, and Fenwick's name was the first to appear on the state register, but it was not until the Second World War, by which time the 'Poor Law' had been abolished in England and Wales, and the standard of nurse training in former workhouse infirmaries improved under local authority control, that state registration of nurses became compulsory. 
Described as resembling Queen Victoria, both in stature and facial features, Luckes is said to have shared the monarch's gift for remembering faces and people. In later years attired in black silk or satin dresses, lace cap, and (often elaborate) jewellery, her appearance was in marked contrast to her hygienically clad nurses. She devoted the greater part of her life to raising standards of the care of patients, not only at the London Hospital, but also nationally and internationally, through the influence of her writings and of those whom she trained.

Browne, Dame Sidney Jane (1850-1941), nurse, was born on 5 January 1850 in Bexley, Kent, one of the four children of Benjamin Stocks Browne and his wife, Jane Sidney, formerly Deane. Sidney grew up in a medical family: her father was a surgeon and her two brothers were doctors. She was educated at home, and when she was twenty-eight started nursing at the Guest Hospital, Dudley, before transferring in 1879 to the West Bromwich District Hospital to undertake a formal three-year training. As a qualified nurse she worked briefly at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, before joining the army nursing service in 1883. While at St Bartholomew's she was influenced by the matron, Ethel Manson (later Mrs Bedford Fenwick), who believed that nursing was a profession and should command professional education and status. 
As an army sister Browne was posted to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley. At this time the army nursing service consisted of about twenty sisters, and their role was ill-defined. In peacetime they were responsible for the nursing in the large military hospitals, but their small number meant that the nursing work was done by orderlies with the sisters acting as superintendents. Between 1885 and 1899 Browne held a series of increasingly responsible positions in the army nursing service, which included active service in the Sudan wars, for which she was awarded the khedive's star and the Egyptian medal and bar. She served at the military hospitals at Woolwich, Malta, and Curragh Camp, Ireland, and at the Herbert Hospital, Woolwich. With the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899 she was ordered to South Africa and served for three years as superintending sister at three different base hospitals. Following severe criticism of the War Office's handling of the medical services during the war, fundamental reforms were introduced. One of these was the establishment of a proper army nursing service, to be known as Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service. Browne was recalled to England to take up the position of matron-in-chief of the new service. For her service in South Africa she was awarded the Royal Red Cross. 
By the standards of the War Office, Browne had advanced ideas about the status of nurses. As matron-in-chief she worked for the establishment of the new service on professional lines and argued successfully for members of the service to hold officer rank. Against strong disapproval from the traditional Royal Army Medical Corps, she introduced a new system for the training of the nursing orderlies, transferring their training from the medical staff to the nursing sisters. When she retired in 1906, at the age of fifty-five in accordance with army regulations, the number of nurses in the service stood at 400. Two years later she was closely involved in another army reform, the establishment of the Territorial Force Nursing Service. With her good friend Elisabeth Haldane, sister of R. B. Haldane, secretary of state for war, she worked with the War Office to establish this reserve of trained civilian nurses who would serve in military hospitals at home in the event of war. The success of the service relied on the recruitment of civilian nurses; helped by the mood of the time, nurses responded to the opportunity to take an active part in the defence of their country. When the First World War started in 1914, Browne was responsible for the mobilization of the service and also for its rapid expansion from 3000 members to over 7000 strong, with approximately 25 per cent of its members serving at the war front. As matron-in-chief she travelled all around the country and abroad, under wartime conditions, inspecting the living and working conditions of the nurses. 
Throughout the war there was a shortage of trained nurses, and the issue of how to control the use of untrained volunteer nurses in the military hospitals was of great concern to trained nurses. Browne played a key role in mediating between the establishment and the profession. She had been a supporter of the campaign for state registration for trained nurses since qualifying and was an active member of the various associations set up to promote the cause. As a result of the war, the balance of opinion among trained nurses shifted in favour of registration and the College of Nursing was founded to provide a uniform standard of training and examination. Browne became a member of the college, and her administrative experience and financial abilities were of great value to the new organization. She became the first president and the first nurse honorary treasurer of the college. 
Browne's contribution to the great channelling of women's energy during the war was recognized at the Exhibition of Women's War Work, organized by the Imperial War Museum in 1918, where her portrait hung beside those of Dr Garrett Anderson and Dr Flora Murray. She received many tributes for her war work, including a bar to her Royal Red Cross and her appointment as DBE; the University of Leeds awarded her an honorary nursing diploma, the League of Red Cross Societies awarded her the international Florence Nightingale medal, and she was the first woman to receive the freedom of the city of West Bromwich. 
After the war Browne retired from many of the offices she held, including the position of matron-in-chief and that of British representative of Lady Minto's Indian Nursing Association. She continued to play an active role in the College of Nursing until she left London in 1927. The rest of her life was spent in Cheltenham with her long-standing friend Hilda Hoole. When she died, at 11 Tivoli Road, Cheltenham, on 13 August 1941, at the age of ninety-one, she was described as the 'modern Florence Nightingale'. The funeral, which was held on 16 August at St Stephen's Church, Cheltenham, where she was buried, was of a semi-military character. A Red Cross flag, which had flown over the army sisters' quarters at Springfontein, covered her coffin.

Swift, Dame Sarah Ann (1854-1937), nurse and a founder of the Royal College of Nursing, was born on 22 November 1854 at Blossom Hall, Kirton Skeldyke, near Boston, Lincolnshire, the second of the three children of Robert Swift, a landowner and independent farmer, and his wife, Mary Ann Lamb. She attended Cowley School (1860?-1870) at Donington, near Boston, and at the age of twenty-two went to the Dundee Royal Infirmary to train as a nurse (1877-80). The matron of the infirmary at the time was Rebecca Strong, who had reorganized the nurses' training in line with the latest developments. On completing her training Swift's first job was as sister-in-charge of the Home for Incurables in Dundee, where she remained for six years. She then worked briefly at the City Hospital North, Liverpool, and at the London Fever Hospital. 
In 1889 Swift went to America to study nursing practices in New York, and later travelled to Constantinople, where she worked in the British Seamen's Hospital. On her return to England, in 1890, she went to Guy's Hospital, London, and after completing the one-year course for paying probationers she was appointed an assistant matron. The following year she was appointed lady superintendent of the private staff, and in 1900 she was appointed matron. Her years as matron (1900-09) were a period of achievement both for herself and for the hospital. Her administrative abilities and financial acumen served Guy's well at a time of great development in medicine and nursing, and when the hospital was expanding rapidly. She believed that nursing was a profession with great potential for women, and she worked to improve the status and working conditions of the nurses. One of her main concerns was the lack of pensions for nurses, and she became involved in several schemes to provide financial relief and retirement homes for nurses, including the Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses and the Nurses' Memorial to King Edward VII. She also established sports clubs and recreational facilities for the nurses and a Past and Present Nurses' League, which she used to develop professional awareness among Guy's nurses. 
Although she retired in 1909, when the First World War started Swift offered her services and within a few months was appointed matron-in-chief of the joint war committee of the St John Ambulance Association and the British Red Cross Society (BRCS). During the war her department was responsible for over 6000 trained nurses, overseeing their selection and dispatch to hospitals at home and abroad, and also for interviewing VADs (members of Voluntary Aid Detachments who were employed as assistant nurses). Swift personally inspected the 1500 auxiliary hospitals administered by the Red Cross and the hostels and hotels used by the nurses in transit. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross, first class, in 1916, and in 1919 she was created dame grand cross of the Order of the British Empire and made a lady of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem. 
Although Swift supported the professional associations that were founded before the war, she had not taken an active part in the campaign for state registration of nurses: her character avoided publicity. However, by the end of 1915 her war work had convinced her that something would have to be done about the chaotic state of nurses' training. Knowing that the leaders of the campaign for state registration, particularly Mrs Bedford Fenwick, would oppose any attempt to introduce a voluntary system of registration, she approached Arthur Stanley, chairman of the BRCS and treasurer of St Thomas's Hospital, and asked him to help her organize a college of nursing. Stanley agreed, and they enlisted the support of Sir Cooper Perry, medical superintendent of Guy's, and several matrons of leading London teaching hospitals. The founders of the college aimed to standardize the training of nurses, with a uniform curriculum, examination, and a register of the names of those nurses that had passed the examination. Despite the irreconcilable opposition of the ardent state registration campaigners, the new initiative was well received by the majority of matrons and managers of the large training schools and hospitals in the country, and the College of Nursing was established in April 1916. 
In 1919 the 'Nurses' Registration Acts' established three new statutory bodies which became responsible for the registration of trained nurses in England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. No longer responsible for the registration of nurses, and with a membership of over 17,000, the college was in a position to expand its role. Thanks to the foresight of its founders it became a successful professional organization, responding to the educational needs of nurses and providing leadership to the new profession. The achievements of the college were recognized in 1928 when it was granted a royal charter. However, it was not until two years after the death of Swift that it was given permission to use the prefix royal and became the Royal College of Nursing. 
At the end of the war Swift stayed on at the joint war committee to help with the demobilization of nurses. The BRCS extended its charter to include peacetime health problems and Swift, a member of the council and executive committee, became very involved in this work. A League of Red Cross Societies was formed to carry out the peacetime work and she was appointed the nursing representative of the British society. She participated in numerous committees and international conferences throughout the 1920s and played an important part in setting up the first public-health nursing course in London for the league. This course attracted nurses from developing countries, who then worked as pioneers in public-health nursing in their home countries. The course was very successful and Swift took on the role of 'mother' to a generation of international students. In 1929 she was awarded the international Florence Nightingale medal for her distinguished contribution to international nursing. She also made significant contributions to developments that were taking place in nursing in Britain at the time, particularly in the care of the chronic sick and prison nursing. 
Dame Sarah said that she was happiest when she was organizing and she never really retired from her work. In 1935, when she retired from the post of matron-in-chief of the BRCS, and was presented with a scroll acknowledging her years of service by the future George VI, she remained a member of the council of the society and on several of its committees. She was also a member of the council of the College of Nursing from 1916 until her death, was twice elected its president, then a vice-president, and an honorary treasurer. Her last public appearance was at the coronation of George VI. She died a few weeks later, after a short illness, on 27 June 1937, at her London home, 20 Melcombe Court, Dorset Square, Marylebone. Her funeral took place two days later at St Mark's, Marylebone Road, and was followed by a cremation service at Golders Green crematorium; a memorial service was held at Guy's Hospital chapel. 
Swift was a very small, determined woman, about 4 feet 10 inches tall. Her whole life was devoted to nursing and her motivation was a genuine love of humanity. Her nurses knew her as a strict disciplinarian but were grateful to her for teaching them to accept responsibility. She was intensely private and disliked fuss. The many honours she received she accepted as tributes to her profession. She left instructions that on her death nothing was to be written about her.

Musson, Dame Ellen Mary (1867-1960), nurse, was born on 11 August 1867 at The Castle, Clitheroe, Lancashire, one of the twelve children of William Edward Musson (1831-1917), surgeon, and his wife, Susanna Catherine Robinson (1839-1911). Musson received a good education at home (1870-85), travelled in France and Germany, and worked as a governess before deciding at the age of twenty-seven to become a nurse. She undertook a three-year training (1895-8) at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where she was the gold medallist in her final year. The matron at that time was Isla Stewart, a leading personality in nursing politics and education, and Musson spent eight years working with her as night superintendent, sister, and assistant matron. In 1906 she moved to Swansea to become the matron of the Swansea General and Eye Hospital, and two years later was appointed matron of the General Hospital, Birmingham. 
As a matron of a large provincial hospital from 1909 until 1923, Musson was very aware of the needs of the emerging profession of nursing, and she worked to improve the nurses' working conditions and salaries. She also understood the need for proper professional education for nurses and developed the training syllabus, post-certificate courses in radiography, and the treatment of venereal disease, and established an important school of massage. Before leaving Birmingham she fulfilled one of her dreams, to open a club for nurses and professional women, with the financial support of Mrs Cadbury, the lady mayoress of Birmingham, and the local branch of the College of Nursing. 
Musson joined the Territorial Force Nursing Service when it was established in 1908, and at the start of the First World War was appointed a principal matron. She was responsible for recruiting a large number of nurses for service at home and overseas, as well as for the supervision of the nursing in the 1st Southern General Hospital, based at Birmingham. This hospital started the war with 520 beds and finished it with over 6000. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross, first class, for her services. 
Musson shared the view of the leaders of the campaign for the state registration of nurses, believing that nurses required professional independence. She took an active part in the various societies campaigning for state registration, and was a member of the influential League of St Bartholomew's Nurses and president of the General Hospital Birmingham Nurses' League. In 1916 she became one of the first supporters of the College of Nursing, despite the opposition of the leaders of the state registration campaign: she believed that the college offered a chance for unity within the profession. Her decision was a turning point for the party of moderation in the battle for control of the nursing profession, and through her influence and active support she contributed to the college's success. She was involved with the college for the rest of her life, as a member of the council until 1939, as honorary treasurer from 1938 to 1950, and as vice-president from 1950 to 1960. One of her main concerns was the poor economic position of nurses and she worked hard to improve this: one of her finest achievements was the establishment of the federated superannuation scheme for nurses in 1928. 
Apart from her work for the College of Nursing, Musson had a distinguished career with the General Nursing Council for England and Wales (GNC). In 1923, when she was elected to this new statutory body responsible for registration under the 1919 'Nurses' Act', she retired from full-time work in Birmingham and moved to Pevensey Bay, Sussex. In 1926 she became the first elected chairman of the GNC; she held this position until she stood down in 1943. As the first nurse chairman of the GNC she had a difficult task: not only was the profession divided ideologically but it was also at odds with the Ministry of Health. The government was more concerned with recruitment levels and the cost of running the hospitals than with raising the standard of nurses' professional education and status. 
In the inter-war years the biggest concern for the profession was the shortage of nurses and the large number of untrained 'assistant nurses' who made up the shortfall. In 1937 Musson was one of the four nurses to be appointed to the interdepartmental committee on nursing services, chaired by the earl of Athlone. This government committee made many recommendations concerning the conditions, discipline, and social life of nurses, but its report was overshadowed by the start of the Second World War. The recommendations were taken up by the Royal College of Nursing, which appointed a special committee in 1941 to consider how they could be implemented. Musson was also a member of this committee, chaired by Lord Horder, which published several influential reports concerning the assistant nurse, recruitment, education and training, and the social and economic conditions of nurses. After the war, when the National Health Service was being organized, many of the ideas of the Athlone and Horder committees became the foundation of future policy, including the recognition of the assistant nurse. 
In 1925 Musson attended the first post-war congress of the International Council of Nurses (ICN), held in Helsinki, as a representative of the College of Nursing, which had been invited by the president of the Finnish Nurses' Association to send an observer. (The college was not affiliated to the national association in Britain, the National Council of Nurses, because of the opposition of Mrs Bedford Fenwick, the founder of the latter and of the ICN.) Musson was very surprised to find herself elected honorary treasurer of the ICN at the meeting. This manoeuvre on the part of the organizers of the ICN illustrates Musson's status as a bridge between the two parties in British nursing. She was a very successful and popular treasurer of the ICN, and was persuaded to remain in office until 1947, when, at the age of eighty, she insisted on retiring. She contributed to the work of the ICN in many fields, including in 1934 the establishment of the Florence Nightingale International Foundation to provide funds for postgraduate study for nurses, as a memorial to Miss Nightingale. On Musson's retirement she was granted honorary membership of the ICN, and at the age of eighty-two she was persuaded to attend its fiftieth anniversary congress, held in Stockholm, when she was made an honorary member of the Swedish Nurses' Association. 
Musson's many tributes included appointment as CBE (1928) and DBE (1939), an honorary LLD degree from the University of Leeds (1932), and the international Florence Nightingale medal (1939), and she held many distinguished offices, including the presidency of the National Council of Nurses of Great Britain and Ireland (1945). She devoted her life to the profession of nursing, and to everything she did she brought a first-class brain and integrity. Despite the very real divisions within the nursing profession in Britain, she was accepted by all parties as fair. She was good-looking, with a kind face, and described her hobbies as motoring and travelling. She spent the last fourteen years of her long life, which stretched from the days of Florence Nightingale's nursing reforms to those of the National Health Service, with her brother and sister at their home in Eastbourne. Musson died at the age of ninety-three on 7 November 1960, at her home, Badlesmere, 10 Trinity Trees, Eastbourne, and was cremated in the town on 11 November.

Chant, Laura Ormiston (1848-1923), author and political activist, was born on 9 October 1848 at Woolaston, Gloucestershire, near Chepstow, daughter of Francis William Dibbin, civil engineer, and his wife, Sophia Ormiston. Educated at home, she later became an associate of arts at Apothecaries' Hall. She worked as a schoolteacher, a hospital nurse, and as assistant manager of a lunatic asylum before marrying Thomas Chant (died 1913), a surgeon, on 13 September 1877; he was the son of Joseph Chant, builder. The couple had one son and three daughters. 
Laura Chant is best known for her public advocacy of the causes of women's suffrage, temperance, and social purity, though her early association with nursing played an important role throughout her life. She was awarded the red cross by the Greek royal family for her work accompanying British nurses to the Greek frontier and to Crete, and also travelled to Bulgaria to do relief work among Armenian refugees, presumably in the late 1870s. A Liberal politically, she was a member of the Women's Liberal Federation and vice-president of the Peace Society. She was also a founder member of the National Society for the Promotion of Women's Suffrage, and sat on the executive committee of the Society for Promoting the Return of Women Poor Law Guardians. She was also a member of the Social Purity Alliance and was active in the 1890s in opposing the implementation of a 'Contagious Diseases Act' in Guernsey. She was an active member of the Ladies' National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts and one of the National Vigilance Association's earliest supporters, editing its house journal, the 'Vigilance Record'. 
Perhaps Chant's most famous campaign was that against what she perceived to be the runaway immorality associated with the music-hall tradition. In October 1894 she attended the meeting of the licensing committee of the London county council in order to challenge the renewal of the licence of the Empire Theatre of Varieties in Leicester Square, which she claimed allowed both indecent performances involving scantily clad women and disorderly conduct in the auditorium, since prostitutes were allowed to ply their trade within the establishment. Though this was the first time that Chant had taken steps to close such a theatre, she had contributed a regular column entitled 'Amused London' to the 'Vigilance Record' in 1888 and 1889, recording her visits to London's music-hall and variety shows. The committee upheld Chant's complaint against the Empire music-hall, insisting on a number of changes before the licence could be renewed, a decision which was not received favourably by the general public or by the satirical magazine 'Punch', which promptly dubbed Chant Mrs Prowlina Pry. Feminist activists, too, were divided over Chant's actions, and indeed over the work and philosophy of the National Vigilance Association with which she was so closely associated. Though her offensive was initially successful, the Empire was quickly restored to its former condition and was granted a licence without hitch the following year. In 1895 she published a pamphlet defending her actions entitled 'Why we Attacked the Empire'. She also contributed an article, 'Women and the streets', to James Marchant's volume on vice, 'The Master Problem' (1917). 
Chant was a practising Congregationalist and a member of the British Women's Temperance Association. She advocated the introduction of women preachers and published a book of short sermons. A popular and active lecturer on a variety of topics from women's suffrage and temperance to the importance of gymnastics, she was also a prolific writer and composer. She wrote pamphlets on social purity, temperance, and the poor law, published a novel, 'Sellcuts' Manager' (1899), and two volumes of poetry, 'Verona and other Poems' (1887) and 'A Merry Christmas' (1910). She also wrote many songs and hymns as well as short stories. An honorary member of two American women's clubs, the New England Women's Club and the Women's Club of Chicago, Chant was, in her spare time, a keen billiard player. 
Much of Chant's adult life was spent at The Homestead, Pinvin, Pershore. She died at home at 41 Bloxham Road, Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 16 February 1923 of cerebral haemorrhage and heart failure.

Robinson, Sarah (1834-1921), evangelist and army temperance activist, was born at Peckham, Surrey, on 1 August 1834, the fourth of the six children of John James Robinson (1795/6-1879), squire of Heasmond's estate near Lewes, Sussex, where he farmed 150 acres, and his wife, Rebecca, 'nee' Morris. She was baptized at the Grove Independent chapel, Camberwell, Surrey, on 4 October 1834. Her enthusiasm for things military began early on in her life, and she spent her childhood roaming her father's estate, playing toy soldiers with her two younger brothers, and reading biographies of Christian military heroes. From about 1844 she spent four years at an academy for young ladies in Brighton. Although described as 'delicate in health, reserved, sensitive and timid' (Chappell, 64), Robinson, a lifelong spinster, was one of a cadre of mid-century female evangelists who felt called to work among the army's 'roughs and toughs' (Anderson, 58). She was inspired, as were many female temperance workers, by the pioneering work of Julia Wightman and her book 'Haste to the Rescue' (1860). Robinson's work was typical of late Victorian gospel temperance, a combination of religious zeal and teetotalism, in which temperance itself comprised an essential dimension of personal redemption. Yet her faith was considerably more eclectic than her father's strict Calvinism, leading to affiliations with first the Church of England (from 1851) and then a Presbyterian congregation (from 1866-7). 
In 1858 the Robinson family moved to Box Grove Villas, near Guildford, 10 miles from Aldershot barracks, which were the site of Robinson's first venture into army temperance reform. Temperance workers had made little headway in the services before the 1860s. Popular representation of the soldier's life as a glamorous, heroic sacrifice lay in stark contrast to the reality of physical debilitation, harsh discipline, and high levels of profligacy. Robinson recognized that intemperance was particularly rife among the lower ranks where recruitment, billetings, and entertainment of volunteers centred exclusively round the public house. Accordingly in 1863 she helped an officer's widow, Louisa Daniell, launch the Aldershot Mission Institute, providing servicemen with an alcohol-free centre for relaxation and education. 
With Agnes Weston -- her temperance counterpart in the navy -- Robinson was charged by the National Temperance League with the promotion of several significant and permanent temperance initiatives. Between 1865 and 1873 she worked as an itinerant temperance agent, visiting military garrisons as far afield as Brighton, Bristol, Exeter, Hounslow, Leeds, Canterbury, York, and Newport on the Isle of Wight. In 1873 she spent nine weeks in an open camp on Dartmoor, accompanying various regiments on manoeuvres. Here she set up two large marquees, selling huge quantities of non-alcoholic refreshments and cheap food. In addition she distributed 'Bibles', held services and prayer meetings, and provided a reading-room for the troops, equipped with games, newspapers, and books. Robinson's success in converting servicemen to teetotalism, in providing decent entertainment and educational facilities, and in obtaining better quality accommodation for troops led to considerable national publicity and her subsequent recognition as the Soldier's Friend. She was entered in the parliamentary blue book as a lecturer in military education, and her refreshment canteens were visited by the secretary of war. Later she was included in Jeannie Chappell's popular 'Noble Work by Noble Women' [1900]. 
Robinson published several books on gospel temperance reform, of which the most significant was 'Christianity and Teetotalism' (1876). She was also a contributor to the influential collection of essays 'Woman's Work in the Temperance Reformation' (1868), edited by Hatford Battersby, and she compiled three accounts of her activities, the earliest of which was 'A Life Record' (1898). Her most celebrated temperance venture was the founding of the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute in 1874: she raised funds for the conversion of The Fountain inn in Portsmouth High Street into a place of safe, decent, Christian accommodation for military troops returning from, or embarking upon, service abroad. Sick or wounded soldiers, and the often destitute wives and families of servicemen, were housed there and given practical help. Additional recreation rooms, a lecture hall, and separate accommodation for officers were subsequently added to the building. Despite vociferous opposition by local townspeople, unappreciative of her widespread depiction of Portsmouth as 'Satan's very seat' (Chappell, 91), Robinson refused to compromise the strict teetotalism and religious moralism central to her reform programme. Within two years the institute had earned itself a national reputation for the improvement of the social welfare of troops, and in 1876 it was visited by the commander-in-chief of the British army, George, duke of Cambridge. 
Despite a worsening spinal complaint, Robinson undertook tours of England and Scotland in the summers of 1889 and 1891 in order to raise money for the institute's accumulating debts. She travelled 3000 miles in a specially constructed coach, delivering 165 addresses. She finally retired from public life, as a result of her chronic invalidism, to Burley in the New Forest, where she shared a house with Miss Alice Walker, although she continued to direct her lady helpers at the Portsmouth Institute. Walker acted as superintendent of the Soldiers' Institute for thirteen years. Robinson's final autobiographical account, 'My Book: a Personal Narrative', was published in 1914. She died at her home, The Hut, Burley, Hampshire, on 26 November 1921, and was cremated at Woking. Her success was due not only to her loyalty to and concern for the reputation of the British army as a creditable institution, but to her ability to handle the subject of temperance with discretion and sensitivity. Through the influence of the philanthropic endeavours of temperance workers such as Sarah Robinson, army authorities began to assume a greater level of responsibility for the moral welfare of their troops and to undertake the general reform of the recreational habits of servicemen.

Matheson, Hilda (1888-1940), intelligence officer and director of radio talks, was born on 7 June 1888 at 13 Dealtry Road, Putney, the elder of two children of Donald Matheson, Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Margaret Orr. Since both parents were Scottish the family spent most of their summer holidays in the Scottish highlands where Hilda became a skilled mountaineer. For four years she boarded at St Felix School in Southwold and her history teacher persuaded her to study history at Cambridge. But she had to leave school, aged eighteen, when her father suffered a breakdown and the family moved to the continent. Within three years Hilda became proficient in French, German, and Italian, having lived in France, Stuttgart, and Florence. The family returned to England in 1908 when her father was appointed chaplain to Oxford University's Presbyterian undergraduates, and she enrolled in the Society of Oxford Home Students, now known as St Anne's College, to read history. As a day student she experienced little of the social side of college life, although she participated in the dramatic society, playing a young king in 'Eagerheart' and then Andromache in Gilbert Murray's version of 'The Trojan Women'; she was also active in the Student Christian Movement. 
Matheson's first employment, in 1911, was as part-time secretary to H. A. L. Fisher at New College, the husband of her economic history tutor, who had just been appointed editor of the 'Home University Library'. She later worked in a similar capacity for David George Haworth, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. On the outbreak of war in 1914 she joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment in Wandsworth, but in 1916 was assigned to military intelligence (MI5), and ended her war service working for the British military control office in Rome. Then she worked for Lord Lothian, who recommended her as political secretary to the first female member of parliament, Nancy, Lady Astor. Astor introduced her to the realms of politics, literature, and society. It was while representing Lady Astor that Matheson first met John Reith, who offered her a senior position in the fledgeling British Broadcasting Company. She accepted the appointment, at a salary of $900 a year, with Lady Astor's blessing, as well as a large farewell cheque, in 1926. 
Nominally employed to assist J. C. Stobart administer the BBC's education department, Matheson soon became the first director of talks and established the first news section when the company became the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927. 'Always ready to try something different' (Woodruff, 81), she sought the advice of Lord Lothian and Nancy's husband, Viscount Astor, in helping to determine how the BBC could become a major provider of the news. They recommended that she employ Philip Macer-Wright, the assistant editor of the 'Westminster Gazette', and his eleven-page report, 'Suggestions for the improvement of the BBC news service', which he submitted in September 1928, was referred to constantly during the ensuing decades as the BBC refined and expanded its news presentation. 
At a time when all broadcast talks had to be scripted, Matheson devoted much time to helping prospective broadcasters express themselves clearly by teaching them how to 'write for the ear'. Genuinely interested in ideas as well as people, Matheson saw that BBC talks offered a unique opportunity to bring to the microphone the leading figures of the day, such as H. G. Wells, G. B. Shaw, Winston Churchill, and Harold Nicolson, who later portrayed her in his 1932 novel 'Public Faces' as a 'woman of tact, gaiety and determination... [whose] office table was unencumbered [who] liked being a female [and] displayed this liking in every curve of her tiny body' (Nicolson, 1946, 24). 
Matheson's colleague Lionel Fielden described her two great qualities as leadership and encouragement, and offers the following account of what it must have been like working during the early days of the BBC at Savoy Hill: 'The microphone was a gateway to great things; but in what form and to what audience? As the first Director of Talks you held in your hands (at one guinea per talk, then, and the rest persuasion) the most powerful instrument devised by man to mould public opinion for good or ill... [W]ork was the innumerable letters and interviews which you packed into six years, the reputations you built and fostered, the ceaseless struggle for wider horizons of toleration, the hours of rehearsal and experiment, the frequent 'crises', the everlasting search for ideas, and the whole queer business of discovering, by trial and error, the 'technique' of the spoken word over the air. (Matheson)' Harold Nicolson was one of those whom Matheson introduced to the new medium of broadcast talks, in 1928, as was his wife, Vita Sackville-West (1892-1962), with whom she immediately became involved in an intense lesbian relationship. This did not end until 1931, which coincided with Matheson's resignation from the BBC. Hilda's love letters to Vita, of over 800 pages, remain in Nigel Nicolson's hands. 
The primary reason for Matheson's resignation was a change in policy imposed by Reith. The regime of talks she had instituted, by 'left-wing liberals', evoked criticism in the 'right-wing' daily press. To deal with these objections Reith imposed a regime of censorship, which even embargoed reviews of new novels, declaring that he wanted to instil a sense of 'responsibility to the older generation' (explaining Fielden's remark about her departure as ('the Blimps were on the warpath and you and your kind were doomed'; Matheson, 36). For her part, Matheson believed it was 'equally part of our responsibility to provide for the intellectual needs of the intervening generations' and stated that she 'could not loyally administer a policy which seemed to be turning into a reversal of what I had been instrumental in helping to build up' (Astor MS 1416/1/1/962). 
Matheson's resignation was announced in December 1931 and caused a stir in the columns of Liberal and left-wing newspapers, and Lady Astor even tried to persuade the MP Walter Elliott to use his influence to have Matheson appointed to the BBC board of governors (Astor MS 1416/1/1/962, 9 Dec 1931). But Matheson was already involved in new ventures, rejecting an offer from Leonard Woolf to administer the Hogarth Press (Leonard Woolf archives, Sx MS 13) so that she could become the radio critic on the Astor-owned 'Observer' and write a column in the 'Week-End Review'. Matheson's revenge on Reith was sweet when her old friend H. A. L. Fisher commissioned her to write a book for the 'Home University Library', 'Broadcasting', which was published in 1933 and is still quoted. As soon as this was published Lord Lothian, at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, persuaded the Carnegie Trust to finance an important research study on British colonial policy, and Matheson was paid $400 a year for working two days a week. Its director was Sir Malcolm (later Lord) Hailey, whose work on the 'Government of India Act' prevented him from taking up his duties until 1935, and ill health during 1937-8 meant that the burden of producing the 'African Survey', of over 2000 pages, published in 1938, devolved on Matheson, for which she was made OBE in 1939. 
After leaving the BBC in January 1932 Matheson developed a stable relationship with the poet Dorothy Violet Wellesley, duchess of Wellington (1889-1956), and made her home on Wellesley's estate in Sussex. It was Dorothy who suggested a recuperative visit to the Riviera in December 1938, and there they met W. B. Yeats and his wife, George. In 1937 Dorothy had co-edited a series of the 'Broadsheet' with W. B. Yeats, who regularly stayed at her country estate, Penn on the Rocks. In what was to be the last week of his life Yeats asked Hilda to compose a setting for one of Dorothy's poems, which she sang for him. A longtime member of the Bach Choir, Hilda counted Dame Ethel Smyth among her close friends, and also the Australian composer and writer W. J. Turner, who was a fellow guest at the soiree with Yeats and later figured prominently in Matheson's last venture. 
By the summer of 1939 Matheson was again involved in military intelligence, having turned down an offer of the principalship of her alma mater. She became founder director of the joint broadcasting committee on a salary of $1000 per annum, responsible for arranging the broadcasting by foreign radio stations of British information and opinions, recording programmes in German and Italian, and scripting programmes for dispatch to neutral countries. Among others, her staff included Guy Burgess, W. J. Turner, Elspeth Huxley, and the former foreign director at the BBC, Isa Benzie. By February 1940 there were over thirty on her staff, out of a projected forty-five, and the committee's programmes were broadcast regularly in eight neutral European countries and three in Latin America. As well as setting this up, in competition to the BBC, Matheson was also responsible for initiating a publishing venture entitled 'Britain in Pictures', designed to counteract the publication in Germany of illustrated books glorifying the German empire and its soldiers, musicians, poets, cities, and mountains, distributed in neutral countries. Almost 140 volumes of 'Britain in Pictures' were eventually published. Dorothy Wellesley was a director, alongside Hilda and W. J. Turner, and the first books were published from Rocks Farm, Withyham, in Sussex, which was Matheson's home on Dorothy's estate. 
On 14 October 1940 Matheson wrote to Lady Astor soliciting her recommendation of an American publisher for this venture. But on 30 October she died of Graves' disease (a toxic goitre), following surgery for partial thyroidectomy, at Kettlewell Hill Nursing Home, Horsell, Surrey. Dorothy Wellesley erected a memorial to 'that wonderful friend [who] understood poetic genius' at Penn on the Rocks, inscribed 'Amica amicorum'. Michael Carney, Matheson's biographer, believed the 'African Survey' was her most enduring work, which British colonial policy makers regularly consulted until the 1960s, and extensive comments on radio drama from her book 'Broadcasting' figure in Tim Crook's 'Radio Drama: Theory and Practice' (1999).

MacLehose, James (1811-1885), bookseller and publisher, was born in Govan, near Glasgow, on 16 March 1811, the eldest son of Thomas MacLehose, a weaver, and Jean McLean. When he was twelve he was apprenticed for seven years to a relative, George Gallie, a bookseller and stationer in Glasgow. While with him he became a close friend of a fellow apprentice in the book trade, Daniel Macmillan. In 1833 he went to London to gain experience with Seeley & Co., booksellers in Fleet Street. When Macmillan was unable to find employment in the south, MacLehose got him a position with Seeleys and they remained close friends for the rest of their lives. MacLehose returned to Glasgow in 1838 and went into business with Robert Nelson. The partnership was dissolved in 1841 and MacLehose continued in business alone, opening a circulating library -- the Western Book Club -- in the same year. 
This was a period of intense religious debate in Scotland and in 1843 MacLehose began publishing religious tracts for seceders. His authors included Dr Hugh Heugh and Dr W. L. Anderson. In 1849 he moved his shop to St Vincent Street, which soon became 'the centre round which gathered almost daily, most of the literary and intellectual talent of his city' (MacLehose, 'Glasgow University Press', 246). His book trade concentrated on the ancient world and European theological and literary works, many of which were purchased through London agents. He also acted as bookseller to the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow and the Glasgow Faculty of Procurators. He expanded his publishing business to include local and Scottish titles, for example the works of Jemima Blackburn, the wife of the professor of mathematics at the University of Glasgow, and Thomas Annan, the celebrated Glasgow photographer. A fine bindery was opened in Glasgow during 1862 and two years later MacLehose was appointed bookseller to the university. Macmillan, by then a very successful publisher, offered him a partnership in 1865, which he refused, opening instead a printing shop in Ayr in partnership with his brother Robert McPhail MacLehose (1820-1910), a bookseller in that town. Macmillan's immediately began to patronize the new works. 
With his connections in Glasgow, James MacLehose was well placed to succeed Charles Griffin as printer to the University of Glasgow in 1871. His first publication for Professor Hugh Blackburn and Professor Sir William Thomson was a new edition of Newton's 'Principia mathematica' published in that year. He soon began publishing textbooks and monographs for university staff, numbering among his authors the brothers John and Edward Caird, William Leishman, John Nichol, and John Veitch. The university press of George Richardson in Glasgow was acquired in 1872 and the printing business, which traded as Robert MacLehose, moved from Ayr. 
On 18 July 1850 MacLehose had married Louisa Sing, 'nee' Jackson; they had three sons and four daughters. He took his two eldest sons, Robert and James, into partnership in 1881. Two of his sons, James and Norman, cemented relations with the Macmillans by marrying daughters of Alexander. Although well known in Glasgow, MacLehose never played an active part in public affairs. He died in Glasgow on 20 December 1885 and his widow died on 13 June 1898.

Mallory, George Herbert Leigh (1886-1924), mountaineer, was born on 18 June 1886 at Mobberley, Cheshire, the eldest son of Herbert Leigh Mallory (1856-1943), rector of Mobberley and later vicar of St John's, Birkenhead, and his wife, Annie Beridge Jebb. He had an elder and a younger sister and a brother, Sir Trafford Leigh Leigh-Mallory. His father changed his surname to Leigh-Mallory in 1914. Mallory was educated at West Kirby, at Glengorse preparatory school, Eastbourne (1897-1900), and at Winchester College (1900-05). Active as a gymnast, Mallory was taken climbing in the Alps with other students by R.L.G. Irving, a Winchester schoolmaster. In 1905 he entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he joined the Fabian Society and the Marlowe Dramatic Club, and captained his college boat. He came under the influence of Arthur Benson, his history tutor, and Charles Sayle, a university librarian who hosted a salon for the bright and beautiful. 
Contemporaries admired Mallory more for his beauty than his brain. In 1909 Lytton Strachey wrote: 'Mon dieu! -- George Mallory!... He's six foot high, with the body of an athlete by Praxiteles, and a face -- oh incredible -- the mystery of Botticelli, the refinement and delicacy of a Chinese print, the youth and piquancy of an unimaginable English boy. (Holroyd, 205-6)' After taking a second-class degree in history, Mallory stayed in Cambridge for a year to write an essay which he later published as 'Boswell the Biographer' (1912). During 1909-1910 he lived for five months at Roquebrune in the Alpes Maritimes to improve his French in preparation for a teaching career. His circle of Cambridge and Bloomsbury friends fostered many same-sex romances, and there has been some question about his sexual preference in this period. In 1909 he confessed his (unrequited) love to James Strachey (G. Mallory to Strachey, 20 Dec 1909, BL, Add. MS 60679, fol. 18). 
Mallory's main passion was mountaineering in the Alps, the Lakes, and north Wales. In their memoirs Geoffrey Winthrop Young, Geoffrey Keynes, and Cottie Sanders (the novelist Ann Bridge) recall climbing with him. Mallory himself wrote little about his climbing. In 'The mountaineer as artist' he compared mountaineering to music as an aesthetic experience ('Climbers' Club Journal', 1, 1914, 28-40). As a rock-climber he was renowned for his grace and sense of balance, but he also had a reputation for impetuosity, imprudence, and absent-mindedness. He was often argumentative, and his vigorous defence of his ideals earned him the nickname 'Sir Galahad'. 
In 1910 Mallory became an assistant master at Charterhouse, Godalming, Surrey, where he taught English, history, and French, and introduced students, including Robert Graves, to mountain climbing. In 1912-13 Duncan Grant painted several nude studies of Mallory. On 29 July 1914 Mallory married (Christiana) Ruth, daughter of Hugh Thackeray Turner, an architect of Godalming. They had two daughters and a son. He was required to remain at Charterhouse when war came, and wrote a pamphlet, 'War Work for Boys and Girls' (1915), to promote international understanding. He was later commissioned in the Royal Garrison Artillery as 2nd lieutenant in December 1915, and assigned to the 40th siege battery, where he participated in the shelling of the Somme. 
Transferred to a staff position, he served as a liaison officer with the French and was promoted 1st lieutenant before being invalided home. After the war he became increasingly dissatisfied with schoolteaching and drafted an unpublished public school novel. 
Geoffrey Young persuaded Mallory to join the first Everest expedition in 1921 because it would make his name and enhance his career as an educator or writer. In 1921 he explored the Tibetan side of Everest and reached the north col with Guy Henry Bullock (1887-1956) of the diplomatic service, who was a school-friend of Mallory's at Winchester, and several porters. Earlier they had glimpsed a valley on the Nepali side of Everest that Mallory named the Western Cwm. In 1922 he returned to Everest and reached 8200 metres without supplemental oxygen, saving the lives of three companions when they slipped on the descent. After George Finch's party went even higher with oxygen, Mallory led an ill-advised attempt to reach the north col after a heavy snowstorm that resulted in the deaths of seven porters in an avalanche. 
Mallory lectured on Everest in Britain in 1922 and in America in 1923. The 'New York Times' (18 March 1923) reported that when asked why climb Everest, Mallory replied, 'Because it's there.' This comment has been interpreted as a heroic manifesto, an exasperated evasion, or an editorial invention. Mallory's lecture notes and other news reports suggest that the phrase accurately reflects his ambiguous, sometimes mystical, view of mountaineering (Robertson, 215-20; Holzel and Salkeld, 295-8). In May 1923, he became a lecturer and assistant secretary in the Cambridge University board of extra-mural studies. 
In 1924 Mallory was promoted to climbing leader on Everest when Colonel E. F. Norton unexpectedly replaced General C. G. Bruce, who had fallen ill, as overall leader. Despite a prevailing prejudice, which he had shared, against oxygen, Mallory wanted to use it after seeing the benefits in 1922, and as he became increasingly obsessed with conquering the mountain. He developed a plan to give himself the best shot at the top by using oxygen with Andrew Irvine ['see below']. He told his wife: 'It is almost unthinkable with this plan that 'I' shan't get to the top: I can't see myself coming down defeated' (to Ruth Mallory, 24 April 1924, Malory MSS). After two unsuccessful attempts without oxygen, he put his plan into action. Mallory and Irvine left their camp on the north-east ridge on 8 June 1924, and were seen momentarily through a break in the clouds by Noel Odell (1890-1987), who said they were probably on a rock outcrop known as the Second Step, below the final summit pyramid. Their location during this sighting has been the subject of debate. After they failed to return, a memorial cairn was erected at the foot of Everest, and memorial services were held at Magdalene College, Cambridge, at Merton College, Oxford, at St John's, Birkenhead, and on 17 October 1924 at St Paul's Cathedral, London. Mallory was posthumously lionized as a gallant knight and romantic hero in works ranging from schoolboy pulp to W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood's 'Ascent of F6' (1936). 
Mallory's friends wanted to believe that he reached the summit, though this remains unproven, and it is usually assumed that he did not. In 1933 Percy Wyn Harris found an ice axe on bare slabs of rock below the First Step with markings that matched those on Irvine's walking sticks. In 1975 Wang Hung-bao (died 1979), a Chinese climber, found the body of an 'English dead' in old-fashioned clothing on a ledge at about 26,600 feet, also below the First Step. In 1999 an expedition dedicated to searching for Mallory and Irvine found Mallory's frozen body on a snow terrace at 27,000 feet. The body was identified by a name tag sewn into Mallory's clothing. After a brief ceremony, Mallory's body was reburied in the snow on 1 May 1999. 

Andrew Comyn Irvine (1902-1924), mountaineer, was born at 56 Park Road South, Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 8 April 1902, the second son and third of six children of William Fergusson Irvine (1869-1962), a merchant trading with Africa and a distinguished Cheshire antiquary, and his wife, Lilian Davies-Colley (died 1950), daughter of Thomas Charles Davies-Colley, a Manchester solicitor. He had four brothers and a sister. He was educated at Birkenhead preparatory school, Shrewsbury School, and Merton College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 24 January 1922 to study engineering. He was tall and stout, with a muscular physique, and was nicknamed Sandy because of his blonde hair and fair complexion. He was known as a powerful oarsman at Shrewsbury and Oxford, and gained his blue as a freshman in 1922, when he rowed no. 2 against Cambridge. He was taught to ski by Arnold Lunn and he won several slalom races in the Alps. In 1923 he joined a sledging party to Spitsbergen with Noel Odell, who recommended him for Everest in 1924. Despite Irvine's inexperience as a climber, Mallory appears to have chosen him as his partner on Everest because he valued his mechanical ability with the unreliable oxygen apparatus, admired his strength and stamina, and may have seen him as a protege. A memorial to him, by Eric Gill, was placed in Merton College grove. Irvine's Everest diaries were published in 1979.

Adams, Henry Cadwallader (1817-1899), Church of England clergyman and author, was born on 4 November 1817 at 6 Great James Street, Holborn, London, the third son of John Adams, of St Pancras, an assistant judge, and his second wife, Jane, daughter of Thomas Martin of Nottingham. He was educated at Westminster School and Winchester College and at Balliol College, Oxford, and then at Magdalen College, where he graduated BA in 1840 (second class honours in 'literae humaniores') and proceeded MA in 1842. In June 1843 he was appointed an examiner in the responsive schools and then in July he was elected a probationer-fellow of Magdalen. He was appointed master of Magdalen College School on 22 March 1844 but resigned a month later to take up an appointment as master at Winchester College, a post he retained until 1851. He was ordained a deacon on 20 December 1846 and a priest in 1852 by the bishop of Oxford. He was appointed curate of Greinton, Somerset, in 1852. Upon his marriage to Esther Pell Edmonds, the second daughter of Richard Edmonds, rector of Woodleigh, Devon, on 6 July 1852, Adams resigned his Magdalen fellowship. He became chaplain to Bromley College, Kent, in 1855, a post he held until 1867 when he resigned to become vicar of Dry Sandford with Cothill, Berkshire, where he remained until 1878. On 15 July of that year he was installed by the bishop of Chichester as vicar of Old Shoreham, Sussex, where he stayed until 1896. 
Adams was a prolific writer (in Allibone's supplement forty-seven works are listed), his works dividing into four principal categories: religious commentaries, Greek and Latin grammars, school stories, and historical tales such as 'The Boy Cavaliers, or, The Siege of Clidesford' (1868), 'Friend or Foe: a Tale of Sedgemoor' (1870), or 'Tales of the Prophets' and 'Tales of the Kings' (both 1872). Adams's forte, however, was as a writer of boys' school stories. He extolled the monitorial system, and he was one of the first of the Victorians to treat this subject seriously with such stories as 'Tales of Charlton School' (1851) or 'Schoolboy Honour' (1861). In the 'Saturday Review' his history of Winchester College, 'Wykehamica' (1878), is praised partly as a collection of school stories that will be popular among boys but 'its higher value, as the author perceives, lies in its record of the birth and development of the English system of public schools' ('Saturday Review', 47/1214, 1 Feb 1879, 148). Adams was also a passable poet. He died at his home, West Uplands, Portsmouth Road, Guildford, Surrey, on 17 October 1899.

Wardrop, Sir (John) Oliver (1864-1948), diplomatist and Georgian scholar, was born on 10 October 1864 at 3 Wolsingham Place, Lambeth, Surrey, the first child and elder son of the three children of Thomas Caldwell Wardrop (1836-1903), a joiner and partner in a building firm, and his wife, Marjory Cameron Scott (1837-1918); both parents were Scottish. A delicate child, he was sent at the age of five to his grandparents' farm in West Calder, Midlothian, where he attended the village school. His education continued at the Coopers' Company grammar school, Stepney (1873-80), and then at schools in Paris and Dissen, Germany (1880-81). He later studied at the Sorbonne (1885-6) and in Rome, where he spent three months before embarking in 1886 on an extensive tour of Egypt, the Middle East, and Georgia. 
Georgia immediately aroused Wardrop's enthusiasm. This is clearly apparent in his first book, 'The Kingdom of Georgia: Notes of Travel in a Land of Women, Wine and Song' (1888), the subtitle of which belies its author's perception and erudition. W. R. Morfill, later his Russian tutor at Oxford, read the manuscript and recommended publication. Encouraged by James Bryce, the professor of civil law, who had recently made a tour of the Caucasus, Wardrop entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1888, was thrice awarded the Taylorian exhibition, each time for a different language (Spanish, French, and Italian), and took a first in modern history in 1891. 
Wardrop held a commission in the 19th Middlesex rifle volunteers and qualified as an army interpreter in Russian, which led to his appointment as private secretary (1892-3) to the British ambassador in St Petersburg, Sir Robert Morier. He kept in touch with his many friends in the Caucasus and continued his studies in both medieval and modern Georgian, sometimes collaborating with his sister, Marjory Wardrop, who shared his admiration for the country. His annotated edition of Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani's 'Book of Wisdom and Lies' (1894), a seventeenth-century collection which enjoys in Georgia the same prestige as the fables of La Fontaine in France, was printed by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press. On his second visit to Georgia in 1894 he was joined by his mother and sister, and the English party was delighted by the warmth of their welcome. This was a testing time for the Georgians in the face of advancing Russification, and it was appreciated that the Wardrops' sympathies were with the nationalist cause. By their translations they were bringing Georgia to the notice of a wider public in the West. 
Wardrop now determined to pursue a career in Russia and the Caucasus. In 1895 he entered the consular service, and he was thereafter accompanied on his postings by his sister. They worked together on 'The Life of St Nino' (1900), a biography of the fourth-century female evangelist of Georgia translated from medieval texts. Wardrop was vice-consul in Kertch for seven years (1895-1902), was briefly in Sevastopol, and was, intermittently, acting consul-general in Poland, Romania, Tunis, and Haiti. When consul in St Petersburg (1903-6) during the Revolution of 1905, he was distressed at Cossack repression in Georgia and made great efforts on behalf of the Georgian nation, supporting public appeals and setting up a Georgian relief committee. He served as consul in Romania (1906-10), during which time his sister died and his own ill health led to his resignation from the service. 
Wardrop married a Norwegian, Margrethe Collett (1877-1960), on 15 October 1912; it was a happy marriage, and there were two sons and a daughter. In retirement he devoted himself to Caucasian studies, making accessible two great poems of twelfth-century Georgia, akin to the lays of the minnesingers and troubadours. Rust'aveli's 'The Man in the Panther's Skin' (1912) was Marjory Wardrop's translation, which he prepared for publication. His own translation 'Visramiani -- the Story of the Loves of Vis and Ramin' (1914), originally written in Persian and recast in Georgian, Wardrop described as one of the oldest novels in the world. His 'English-Svanetian Vocabulary' appeared in 1911, followed by a 'Catalogue of the Georgian Manuscripts in the British Museum' (1913), a translation of the liturgy of St James (1913), in collaboration with F. C. Conybeare, and 'Laws of King George V of Georgia' (1914). 
On the outbreak of the First World War Wardrop rejoined the Foreign Office, becoming consul-general in Bergen, then the chief channel of trade between Britain and northern Europe. He was created CMG in 1917 and appointed consul-general in Moscow, a hazardous posting in which he served throughout the revolution; on one occasion he was burning consular papers while his officials delayed armed police at the door. In 1919 he returned to the Foreign Office (political intelligence department). 
After the Bolshevik Revolution the Caucasian states broke away from Russia, and in 1919 the British government took the imaginative step of appointing Wardrop, now the pre-eminent scholar of Georgian history and literature, as British chief commissioner to the newly independent republics of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. This was the most interesting and appropriate appointment of his career; he was returning to the countries where he had travelled widely as a young man, whose languages he understood, and where he was known and highly regarded. He set up his headquarters in Tiblisi, where life was described by his assistant Harry Luke as a 'fascinating blend of the polished and the barbaric' (Luke, 118). Against the background of the advancing Bolshevik forces, Wardrop attempted to reconcile the interests of his beloved Georgia with those of Great Britain and the Western powers. It was an extremely tense time; the Caucasus was a focus for Russian emigres, and the financial and social instability of the new republics caused much hardship; it was on Wardrop's generosity that the Georgian patriarch depended for his daily bread. When ill health again obliged Wardrop to retire, shortly before the British withdrawal in July 1920, Luke observed that for both his chief and the Georgians, Wardrop's departure was a moving event. He returned briefly to the Foreign Office (department of overseas trade) until appointed a British delegate to the inter-allied commission for the relief of Russia in Paris in 1921. He was created KBE in 1922 while in his final posting as consul-general in Strasbourg (1920-27). 
Wardrop corresponded with Georgian scholars and had a fine collection of books and manuscripts; he bequeathed them to the Bodleian Library, where they form the basis of the Wardrop collection. He served on the council of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1928 (acting as vice-president in 1944) and was a governor of the School of Oriental and African Studies (1939-45). He was active on the board of management of the Marjory Wardrop Fund, which he established in Oxford in memory of his sister with the aim of encouraging Georgian studies. 
Oliver Wardrop stands in the long line of scholar-public servants. The languages, history, and traditions of the Caucasus were his lifelong interests and determined the course of his career and achievements. The plight of Georgians under both tsarist and Soviet rule concerned him greatly, and he played a decisive role in making Georgia's distinctive culture better known to the British public. 
For many years Wardrop lived at the Home Farm, Chipstead, Sevenoaks, Kent. He died on 19 October 1948 at his home, 49 Downshire Hill, Hampstead, London, and was buried in the family grave in St Nicholas's parish churchyard at Sevenoaks.

Wardrop, Marjory Scott (1869-1909), Georgian scholar and translator, was born on 26 November 1869 at 41 Canton Street, Poplar, London, the only daughter and youngest of the three children of Thomas Caldwell Wardrop (1836-1903), a joiner and partner in a building firm, and his wife, Marjory Cameron Scott (1837-1918); both parents were Scottish. The family moved to Chislehurst, and she was educated there and at Eastbourne in private schools, where she learned French, German, and Latin. She later became fluent in Russian and Romanian; it is, however, for her mastery of Georgian that she was distinguished. 

'The Kingdom of Georgia' (1888) by Marjory's brother (John) Oliver Wardrop first excited Marjory Wardrop's interest in the Caucasus. She longed to travel there herself, rather than, as she wrote, 'stay at home, just doing nothing when I might be living, learning and working' (N. Wardrop, 511). At the age of twenty she began her study of Georgian with an alphabet and a gospel. Working at home with books sent by her brother, she embarked on the challenging task of translating the long twelfth-century poem 'The Man in the Panther's Skin' by Shot'a Rust'aveli, a courtly epic from the classical period of Georgian literature. In this she was encouraged by the Georgian man of letters Prince Ilia Chadchadadze, whose permission she had sought to translate his poem 'The Hermit'. Her letter so impressed him that he published it in his newspaper as a model of literary style. She worked on the epic throughout her life, modestly denying that it was perfect enough for publication, and it appeared only after her death, prepared for the press by her brother in 1912. Meanwhile she published 'Georgian Folktales' (1894), the first translation into English of secular Georgian literature. 
Marjory's parents were persuaded that she might join her brother, then in the Caucasus, and the pleasure that she took in her first visit is vividly described in her unpublished 'Notes on a journey into Georgia in 1894-5'. Georgians rate hospitality highly, and she and her brother were entertained by friends in literary circles with open-air banquets, dancing, and singing. It was known and appreciated that Marjory was translating their national epic, and in espousing the Georgian language the Wardrops were supporting the nationalist cause. Soon after this visit Marjory Wardrop's rendering of 'The Hermit' (1895) was published. Her flowing verse makes it the best of her translations, and it was well received in Georgia. On her second visit to the Caucasus in 1896 she was feted everywhere. Such was her gentle charm and warmth of character that she made many friends and kept up a close correspondence with them. 
After her brother joined the consular service in 1895 Marjory Wardrop accompanied him on all his postings. For ten years she lived in Russia -- at Kertch (1895-1902), Sevastopol (1899), and St Petersburg (1903-5) -- and she was briefly in Tunis, Haiti, and Poland. Using her collection of Georgian books, she continued her work on Rust'aveli's epic and, with her brother, published from medieval texts the 'Life of St Nino' (1900), on the fourth-century female evangelist of Georgia. 
The contemporary problems of the country were also of great concern to Marjory Wardrop. While in St Petersburg during the Russian Revolution of 1905 she translated for the British embassy accounts of Cossack repression in Georgia. She was active on the Georgia Relief Committee and made a personal plea to the bishop of Gibraltar to intercede with the Russian holy synod on behalf of the Georgian church. The last three years of her life were spent in Romania (1906-9). After a brief illness she died, unmarried, on 7 December 1909 at the British consul-general's home in Bucharest, and on 21 December was buried in St Nicholas's parish churchyard, Sevenoaks, Kent. 
Marjory Wardrop's translations were made at a time when Georgians were emphasizing their distinctive culture in the face of increasing Russification. Her work led to a wider appreciation not only of Georgian literature but of the country itself, and for this she was held in the highest regard and affection throughout Georgia. In his sister's memory Oliver Wardrop established in Oxford the Marjory Wardrop Fund with the aim of encouraging Georgian studies; her extensive library and papers are in the Wardrop collection of the Bodleian Library.

Hardie, Matthew (1754-1826), violin maker, was born in Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, on 23 November 1754, a son of the clockmaker Stephen Hardie. He was apprenticed to a joiner, and on 19 May 1778 became a member of the south fencibles, a volunteer regiment set up by Henry Scott, third duke of Buccleuch. He obtained a discharge in 1782 by presenting another man as substitute. On 12 February 1779 he married Juliet, daughter of Alexander Baillie, from Ross-shire, in the College Kirk, Edinburgh. 
Although the Hill family of violin dealers thought that Hardie may have studied with the London violin maker John Betts, no proof is available. A more likely influence is thought to be his Edinburgh contemporary John Blair ('fl'. 1790-1822), whose work is charming and beautifully varnished. Between 1784 and 1788 Hardie occasionally repaired stringed instruments for the Edinburgh Musical Society. In 1790 he was trading as a maker in Edinburgh's Old Town, in the Lawnmarket; in 1794, as a 'Fiddle Maker' ('Williamson's Edinburgh Directory', 1794-6, 23) in Carrubber's Close; in 1795-6, at Baxter's Close; and in 1799, 'opposite the Fountain Well north side' (Hill archive, fol. 131). He and Juliet had at least two children, William ('b'. 1796) and Charles (1801-1802). By 1801 Hardie was in financial difficulties, perhaps because the Edinburgh Musical Society had disbanded in 1798, although in 1797 a cello had been commissioned for Nathaniel Gow, a 'very good Stradivari copy' (private information (C. Beare)). The quality of his work earned him the title 'the Scottish Stradivari'. 
The duchess of Buccleuch sponsored benefit concerts for Hardie. One advertisement read: 'Since the conclusion of the American War, when the South Fencibles were discharged in which corp Matthew Hardie had the honour of serving, he has applied himself to making violins, etc, but on account of his numerous family, has never been able to acquire a sufficient stock to carry on trade to advantage. (Glen, 1.xxii)' The concerts may have brought him an order from an army captain for a violin, completed in 1801, which featured in an exhibition of British makers in London in 1998; the catalogue states that his best work is 'very fine, and although firmly based on classical principles and often modelled on the long pattern of Stradivari, is full of idiosyncratic touches'. 
Juliet died on 17 September 1801, and on 29 May 1802, at Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh, Hardie married Hannah McLaren, with whom he had three children, Thomas (1803-1858), who succeeded him in the business, Hannah ('b'. 1804), and Henrietta ('b'. 1806). His second wife must have died by 26 May 1806, when he married Jean McBain at Canongate Kirk. They had a more settled life 'by the Fountain Well' ('Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory', 1810-11, 110) until 1811. In 1812 he moved to Baillie Fyfe's Close, and in 1814 to Low Calton. He married for the fourth time in Edinburgh on 27 July 1817; his new wife was Marion Gilles. He was living at 10 Paul's Work in 1822; and at 15 Shakespear Square in 1824, by which time he was trading as Matthew Hardie & Son with Thomas, who had probably started working with his father when he was about ten years old. Hardie had another able assistant, David Stirrat, and also may have employed Alexander Youle and George Ferguson, among others. 
Hardie and his son were both reputed to be alcoholics, but if so, Hardie's condition was not so severe as to inhibit his friendships with Edinburgh's best musicians, and some of his humorous and witty stories have been recorded by various authors. In 1826 he was imprisoned for debt and sent to St Cuthbert's poorhouse, where he died on 30 August 1826. He was buried in Greyfriars' kirkyard, Edinburgh, in an unmarked grave. Many of his instruments, mostly violins and cellos, remain in use in the twenty-first century; illustrations of them may be found in various books about British violin makers.

House, John (1906-1991), journalist and writer, was born on 16 May 1906 at 13 Deerpark Gardens, Tollcross (subsumed in 1912 into the city of Glasgow), the eldest of eight children born to English parents, John House, a company secretary, and his wife, Georgina Tindle Thomson; his upbringing was solidly middle-class. He attended Whitehill secondary school in Dennistoun, where he formed ambitions to become an author, actor, or artist. However, he finally acceded to his father's demand that he train to be an accountant. This, though, was not to his taste, and by 1928 he was working as a reporter and feature writer on the 'Glasgow Citizen' newspaper. 
The first major feature by House covered one of John Logie Baird's demonstrations of his new television technology at Glasgow University. He later recalled that the journalistic corps attending thought that this innovation, though interesting, would not amount to much. House also covered many major news events in the city, including the Glen cinema fire of 31 December 1928 in which eighty children died. He continued to work as a journalist on Glasgow's evening newspapers -- 'The Citizen', the 'Evening Times', and 'The News' -- and also in light entertainment for the BBC. In the 1930s House's interest in the theatre resulted in the publication of 'Eight Plays for Wolf Cubs'. This passion never left him, and later in life he acted with the Scottish National Players. In the Second World War he served as lance-corporal in the Gordon Highlanders before moving to the army cinematographic unit. Here he worked as a scriptwriter for propaganda films alongside, among others, Peter Ustinov and David Niven. 
After the war House returned to Glasgow and to journalism and, increasingly, to book publication. His knowledge of his home city (and its surrounding areas) was encyclopaedic, and he had huge affection for the place. This, combined with his lively and infectious writing style, meant that he published prolifically in the thirty years following the end of the war. In a period when Glasgow was better known for its poverty, grime, sectarianism, and violence, in books such as 'The Heart of Glasgow' (rev. edn 1965) and 'Glasgow Old and New' (1974) Jack House enthusiastically championed the character of Glasgow's people as well as the city's history, culture, and architecture. Indeed, he recounted that, on showing John Betjeman round Glasgow, the poet exclaimed that this was 'the greatest Victorian city in the world' ('Heart of Glasgow', 20). Key to his success was his willingness to spin a yarn. Although he treated facts as 'sacred', he also maintained that 'if there's a good story I'm going to tell it, whether there's an iota of factual evidence or not' (ibid., 27). Thus, in 'Heart of Glasgow', he described the city's foundation by St Mungo in the style of a medieval romance. Another key was drink; in the same book he did not flinch from relating the various ways, both ingenious and highly dangerous, that Glasgow's drunks had found to remain inebriated despite abject poverty. House was not, however, censorious; he spent a lot of time in the many bars around Glasgow's city centre, and the liveliness he found here informed his writing as much as it cemented his popularity. 
Together with Moray McLaren, a friend from Edinburgh, House formed the All Saints Club. Consisting of 100 members split evenly between Edinbrovians and Glaswegians, this was formed for the purposes of keeping the old feud between the two cities going. Although the rivalry among the All Saints was friendly (House thought it remarkable that 'in a country as small as Scotland you should find two such completely divergent towns less than fifty miles apart') there was the occasional edge; the difference between Glasgow and Edinburgh, he once told the lord provost of Edinburgh, 'is that Edinburgh has culture for 3 weeks of the year while Glasgow has culture for fifty-two' ('Heart of Glasgow', 17). 
Jack House was not sentimental about Glasgow, however, and retained a fascination from his earlier journalistic days for crime, particularly murder. In 'Square Mile of Murder' (1961) he explored four murders which occurred in the west end of the city, including the case of Oscar Slater, who was wrongly convicted of murder. In the four cases he examined he found a common thread to be a concern for respectability at the expense of honesty. 
Though his writing was seldom overtly political House was a member of the Liberal Party, and stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals at the Glasgow Woodside by-election of 1963. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s he was heavily involved in campaigning against the building of the M8 motorway through the centre of the city, which destroyed, among other places, much of the Anderston and Charing Cross areas. He was prescient in the early 1970s in describing the peripheral estates of Easterhouse, Castlemilk, and Drumchapel as slums of the future. About this time he was worried that Glasgow was losing its 'city-state' feel, and expressed a nostalgia for the town that he thought had been disappearing since the last tram ran in 1962. House married a fellow journalist, Jessie Bennet Millar (died 1974). There were no children from the marriage. 
House continued writing into his later years. In 1981 he published his first novel, 'The House on the Hill', an adaptation of the successful Scottish Television series of the same name. His last, and fifty-fourth, book, 'Music Hall Memories', was published to celebrate his eightieth birthday in 1986. During the 1980s he continued to write a column for the Glasgow 'Evening Times', 'Ask Jack', in which he answered questions from readers (on which often rested a wager) about people, places, and events in Glasgow's history. In 1988 he was awarded the St Mungo medal by the city council in honour of his services to Glasgow. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Glasgow in 1978. He died in the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, on 11 April 1991 after a short illness. 
Despite a faintly ludicrous appearance, with buck teeth and a lazy eye, House was a memorable figure. His enduring legacy, according to fellow journalist, Jack McLean, was to have defended Glasgow's working-class culture at a time when the city was perceived by many to be beyond the pale. There was some irony in his being born technically outside Glasgow, of English parentage, and into a middle-class milieu, but the respect for him among the city's people was genuine.

Houston, Renee (1902-1980), actress, was born on 24 July 1902 at 55 Grahame Street, Johnstone, Renfrewshire, one of at least two daughters of James Gribbin (1876-1939), then a spirit salesman, and his wife, Elizabeth Houston (1875-1942). She later gave her maiden forenames as Katerina Valorita. Her parents, who billed themselves as James Houston and Company, became a well-known touring variety act combining comedy and song; the children lived with their grandmother in the small farming community of Carntyne, near Glasgow, where Renee Houston, as she was known from a child, attended the local convent school. By 1914 she had developed her own act, filling in for an absent comedian in the Fyfe and Fyfe Company. She described her three years with them as her 'theatrical education' (Houston, 21), playing a variety of roles, developing the coloratura voice she inherited from her mother, and learning Scottish dancing and ballet. 
When her parents become ill on tour Renee replaced them with a double act she invented with her sister Billie. The Houston Sisters established themselves with comedy grounded in sibling rivalry, Billie playing the boy; they combined meticulous attention to detail, including furniture scaled up to make them look like toddlers, with almost tangible on-stage rapport that gave them improvisatory flair. They were both sharply observational about working-class Scottish life and childhood, and sexually magnetic. In 1926 they appeared at the royal command performance, and they were still successful when Billie retired owing to ill health in 1935. In 1923 Houston was married for the first time, her husband being George Balharrie; they adopted two sons but the marriage ended in divorce and on 28 November 1932 she married Patrick de Lacy Aherne ('b'. 1900/01), a film actor. They had a son and a daughter but that marriage, too, ended in divorce, in 1948. On 7 August that year she married the actor Donald Stewart (1909/10-1974). 
After the retirement of her sister, Houston subsequently developed an act with Donald Stewart. They performed in revue and pantomime, and in the first production of the 1959 play 'Roar Like a Dove', subsequently a Houston trademark; she was to play in six different productions. Her film career took off after the war and she played in several distinguished British films, in comedies such as 'The Belles of St Trinian's' (1957), 'Watch it, Sailor' (1961), and 'Twice Round the Daffodils' (1961), and in dramas such as 'The Horse's Mouth' (1959), 'A Town Like Alice' (1956), and 'Time without Pity' (1957). She also worked several times with the director Roman Polanski, notably on the experimental 'Repulsion' in 1965, and was an occasional member of the informal company of British comic actors who appeared in the 'Carry On' series, in 'Carry on Cabby' (1963), 'Carry on Spying' (1964), and 'Carry on at your Convenience' (1971). In 1963, while continuing with stage, film, and television work, she began a radio career in 'Petticoat Line', a lighter version of 'The Brains Trust' in which a female panel discussed listeners' questions. The show made good use of her talent for the spontaneous and her ability to interact with panellists such as Barbara Cartland and Rachel Heyhoe Flint to generate lively and controversial discussion. She worked on the show for more than ten years and became closely identified with it. 
While she never attained star status, Houston's talents are evident even in small and unrewarding roles. In 'Carry on at your Convenience', for example, she plays a strike-breaking mother who spanks her shop steward son. The role is often awkwardly written but she gives it a consistency largely absent from the script, making effortless transitions between screaming abuse and vamping her lodger with curdled charm. Her Scottish timbre freed her from the cut-glass diction that enfeebled many of her generation -- she was never typecast. Her looks were distinctive and her face mobile, seeming to become raddled or seductive within moments. 
It was not surprising that Houston continued working until her death from pneumonia at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, on 9 February 1980. One of her proudest boasts was that she had been 'christened' as a clown by the great Coco, one of the few women thus honoured. She published her autobiography, 'Don't Fence me in', in 1974. It pays extensive tribute to Donald Stewart and to her sister Billie.

Howison, John (1797-1859), writer and surgeon, was born on 10 May 1797 in Edinburgh, third and youngest child of William Howison, financial writer, and his wife, Janet Bogle. He was the brother of William Howison (b. 1796?). From 1818 to 1820 Howison travelled in Quebec and Ontario, Canada, and practised medicine in St Catharines, Ontario. His 'Sketches of Upper Canada, domestic, local, and characteristic: to which are added, practical details for the information of emigrants of every class' (1821) was an immediate success and is one of the best documentary sources for pioneer life in Canada. It went into three editions, and was translated into German. The first edition was reprinted in 1965 and 1970. 
In 1820 Howison left Canada via the United States, and in 1822 he went to Bombay as an assistant surgeon with the East India Company. He published eight short stories in 'Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine' at this time, two of which were later republished in 'Nimmo's Popular Tales' (1858). He was stationed in Poona in 1825, and belonged to the literary society there. Descriptions of the life of the foreign colony in Bombay and a journey through the Deccan with Major-General Sir Lionel Smith can be found in Howison's 'Foreign Scenes and Travelling Recreations' (1825); this work also contains an account of Cuba which continues to interest French and Hispanic historians. His 'Tales of the Colonies' (1830) consists of Gothic stories set in the West Indies. Howison became a member of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and served as vice-president in 1832. He demonstrated that he was more than an author of light travel works and fiction with his unjustly neglected 'European Colonies... Viewed in their Social, Moral, and Physical Condition' (1834). In this, his most ambitious work, Howison's analysis ranges over Africa, India, the Caribbean, and the Arctic. In 1835 the East India Company promoted him to the post of full surgeon. 
Howison's sketch of 'the Bengal assistant-surgeon, with his fists in his pockets, and habited in a dress half military, half civilian' on promenade at the Cape of Good Hope is probably a self-portrait (J. Howison, 'Foreign Scenes', 1825, 2.216). He seems never again to have experienced the 'freedom... independence... and... joyousness, connected with' Canada (J. Howison, 'Sketches', 1821, 263), and certainly India presented 'a succession of struggles against personal inconveniences and bodily uneasiness' ('Foreign Scenes', 2.74). He concluded that those who pursue 'foreign adventure' lose 'in contentment and serenity what they gain in wealth and knowledge of the world' (ibid., 2.115). Howison retired in 1842 and died on 8 February 1859 at his home, 1 Pelham Place, Brompton, London.

Jackson, Gordon Cameron (1923-1990), actor, was born in Glasgow on 19 December 1923, the youngest of the five children of Thomas Jackson, a foreman letterpress printer, and his wife, Margaret Fletcher. He left the city's Hillhead high school at the age of fifteen to pursue a career as an engineering draughtsman with Rolls-Royce. However, like his contemporary Stanley Baxter, Jackson had been a child actor with the BBC in Scotland, and he was released by Rolls-Royce during the war to play the first of over sixty film roles in the propagandist 'The Foreman Went to France' (1941). It was not long before Jackson forsook industry for acting: he worked in repertory, initially at the semi-professional Rutherglen Repertory Theatre, and then at the fully professional Glasgow Citizens' Theatre, which was founded in 1943 by James Bridie. Further appearances followed in theatres in Scotland and England, and he made his London debut in the long-running production of Hugh Hastings's farce 'Seagulls over Sorrento' in 1951. In that year he married the actress Rona Anderson (1926-2013); they had played the romantic leads opposite each other in 'Floodtide' (1949), one of the very few films about Scotland set on industrial Clydeside. They had two sons. 
Gordon Jackson's career was steady, if not spectacular. His good looks, well modulated voice, and sensitivity to nuance of character ensured that he found work in a wide range of films including 'Whisky Galore' (1948), 'Tunes of Glory' (1960), 'Mutiny on the Bounty' (1962), 'The Ipcress File' (1965), 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1968), and 'The Shooting Party' (1985). He performed regularly on the stage, most notably as Ishmael in Orson Welles's London production of 'Moby Dick' in 1955, as Banquo to Alec Guinness's Macbeth at the Royal Court in 1966, and Horatio to Nicol Williamson's Hamlet in Tony Richardson's 1969 production, which played on both sides of the Atlantic. For this last performance he gained the Clarence Derwent award for best supporting actor. Supporting actors are rarely as well known to the public as leading performers, yet the work they do can make or break productions. Jackson could be relied on to bring something distinctive to the roles he played, although until the end of his career he was apprehensive about every part he undertook, and had difficulty watching his own screen performances. 
A much higher public profile than he had enjoyed thitherto came when, from 1970 until 1975, Jackson appeared in London Weekend Television's 'Upstairs, Downstairs', a series which explored the interaction of the parallel worlds of employers and servants in an Edwardian household. Jackson played the pivotal figure of the butler, Hudson, a dogged traditionalist who took his responsibilities very seriously indeed. For this portrayal he won the Royal Television Society's award for best actor in 1975, and an Emmy award in the United States in 1976. He followed Hudson by creating the much less attractive character of Cowley, the ruthless head of an anti-terrorist organization in 'The Professionals' (1978-83); it ran for fifty-seven episodes but was unworthy of Jackson's talent. 
Jackson was one of a number of Scottish actors -- Andrew Cruickshank, Stanley Baxter, and Duncan Macrae were others -- who sought in their careers to strike a difficult balance. On the one hand, there were available to them the ethnic parts at which they were effortlessly adept, but which could so easily lead to typecasting; on the other, there was a wider range of non-Scottish roles, which could extend them as performers and in the esteem of audiences. Jackson rose well to this challenge, and subsequently enjoyed a career which was rewarding both artistically and financially. He was appointed OBE in 1979. He died, from cancer, in the Cromwell Hospital, Kensington, London, on 14 January 1990.

Keiller, John Mitchell (1851-1899), preserves and confectionery manufacturer, was born at 3 Nelson Street, Dundee, on new year's day 1851, the only child of Alexander Keiller (1821-1877), a preserves and confectionery manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth Mitchell (1813-1871). He came from a long line of Keillors, Kelers, and Killers, resident in the town for centuries, mainly in modest mercantile capacities. His formal education started at the proprietary school in Dundee, and continued, with considerable success, in the Greek-revival surroundings of the Dundee high school. At Edinburgh University he won prizes, but left before graduation to pursue -- as a prelude to commercial work -- two years of language studies in France and Germany. At the age of twenty he was back home, in the family firm. Six years later, in 1877, his father died, and he became the youthful and third-generation inheritor of the largest and most successful business of its kind in Britain. In 1883 he married Mary (1862-1907), the daughter of David Grieg MD, of Dundee: a son, Alexander Keiller, was born in 1889. 
The confectionery firm was set up around 1800 by John's grandfather James Keiller (1775-1839) in Seagate, near a sugar refinery and the busy waters of the Tay. As a young unmarried grocer, he worked in close association with his enterprising mother, Janet Mathewson. Business was initially local, but rapidly expanded as a result of harbour and transport improvements, a population explosion in and around Dundee, and the coastal probings of the London retail and entrepot markets. James Keiller's special offering was chip (shredded-peel) marmalade, a supposedly warming breakfast spread, in place of the beaten (pulped-peel) marmalade of English desserts. After his death his widow, Margaret Spence (1800-1850), took over the business, maintaining its by then famously high standards. She was followed, after her own death, by three sons: Alexander (1821-1877), William (1829-1899), and Wedderspoon (1835-1866). Wedderspoon and William successively ran new factories in Guernsey, set up in 1857 to bypass sugar duties, which left Alexander as sole manager of the Dundee firm, by that time called James Keiller & Son. By the mid-1870s it was lodged in spacious buildings off Albert Square. 
When John Keiller took control in 1877, output ranged from marmalade, jellies, and jams, through lozenges, comfits, and jujubes, to candied peels and bottled fruits. He greatly expanded the enterprise, with a 'characteristic pushfulness' ('Dundee Advertiser', 6 Jan 1899), but refrained from radical innovation. Items on the firm's 1887 price list were identical to those of twenty years earlier -- chocolate and cocoa products being added only in the 1890s. Keiller did, however, travel the world, 'ever on the alert to widen the industry by opening up new markets' (ibid.). Exhibition medals from Vienna (1873) and Cape Town (1877) were supplemented by new marmalade awards from Sydney (1879), Melbourne (1881), and Calcutta (1884). Of importance, too, was Keiller's transfer in 1879 of English production (following the repeal of sugar duty) from Guernsey to Silvertown, London. His junior co-partner, James Boyd, assisted, becoming manager of the new, markedly self-sufficient, factory on the Thames -- 'mammoth works... declared a study of marvellous perfection' ('Dundee Courier & Argus', 6 Jan 1899). In 1893 the decision was taken to make James Keiller & Son a limited-liability company. John Keiller became chairman, though he used the juncture to begin a progressive withdrawal from direct business activity. 
Unlike his modest predecessors, Keiller seemed happy to divert profits into conspicuous personal expenditure and to break out of the limits imposed by his ancestral town. Outlays included the purchase of Binrock House, Dundee, about 1880, and (on the sale of Binrock) 9 Cavendish Square and 13 Hyde Park Gardens, London; the 10,000 acre Morven and Gairnside shooting estate (with the later Craigendarroch Lodge) on Deeside in 1886; the ocean-going yacht 'Erl King'; and, for the 1887 jubilee, the donation of more than 3000 books to the Dundee Free Library and the clearance of the Albert Institute's $9500 debt (opening the way for the Victoria Galleries extension to Sir George Gilbert Scott's original building). These last gestures, combined with other gifts, a lively patronage of the fine arts, some limited public service, and a local magistracy, secured his good name in Dundee -- despite the place having latterly 'seen or heard very little of him' ('Dundee Advertiser', 6 Jan 1899). 
In politics, Keiller was conservative; in religion, Church of Scotland. He suffered poor health in his last years, and died on his yacht, in tempestuous seas between Madeira and the West Indies, on 2 January 1899, aged only forty-eight. He was buried in the western cemetery, Dundee. An annuity was bequeathed to his widow, Mary, and a $20,000 pension fund was set up for his workforce. The bulk of his estate passed, in trust, to his son.

Kidd, Dame Margaret Henderson (1900-1989), lawyer, was born on 14 March 1900 at Grange Park, Carriden, Bo'ness, Linlithgowshire, the elder daughter of James Kidd (1872-1928) and his wife, Janet Gardner Turnbull (1872-1930), a teacher. Her parents were both Scottish. Her father was a much respected solicitor and (Unionist) MP for the local seat of West Lothian (Linlithgowshire); and on his death in 1928 she contested the seat in the unionist cause but was defeated by Emanuel Shinwell. She was educated at Linlithgow Academy and thereafter at the University of Edinburgh, where she graduated MA and LLB in 1922. Her early legal training was with Mitchell and Baxter, writers to the signet, in Edinburgh where the young Robert Louis Stevenson had preceded her. She had hoped to pursue a diplomatic career but despite the passing of the 'Sex Disqualification Act', 1919, it was not considered possible. It was her father's suggestion that she should go to the bar 'and have fun'. 
When she passed advocate in July 1923 Kidd became the first female member of the Faculty of Advocates, the Scottish bar; and between 1923 and 1948 she remained the only lady advocate. Then and indeed until very much later, the ladies' robing-room was situated off a lower corridor in Parliament House, opposite the condemned cell. Margaret Kidd recalled that hot water was put in only after the Second World War. Although her practice was wide, it centred on family law, where she was appreciated by her contemporaries as adding a new dimension to old problems. She was later to recommend that a family court at sheriff court level would be more responsive. Kidd was the first lady advocate to appear before the House of Lords and before a parliamentary select committee; and in 1948 she had the distinction of becoming the first woman KC in Britain, if only by a few months. By that time she had been standing junior counsel for the Post Office and for the Ministry of Works. 
Kidd married Donald Somerled MacDonald (died 1958) on 22 March 1930. He was a writer to the signet and son of a barrister. They had a daughter, Anne, who married a Cambridge surgeon. Much of Kidd's adult life was spent in India Street, Edinburgh, where she regretted the lack of a proper garden. Her flat was filled with plants as well as legal books, good furniture, and paintings. She was kind, welcoming, and encouraging. Herself one of a large family, she always maintained a strong affection and interest in not only her own family and grandchildren, but also her extended family at the bar. Kidd was tall and, even in later life, retained the clear eyes and complexion that can be seen reflected in her portrait as a young advocate hanging in the advocates' reading-room. 
In 1960 Kidd became the first lady sheriff-principal when she was appointed to Dumfries and Galloway. Appointed to Perth in 1966, then the most prestigious of the sheriff-principaldoms, she held the post until retirement in 1974. As sheriff-principal she exercised both a criminal and a civil jurisdiction, apart from the very wide administrative duties which were part of her appointment. Kidd herself took the view that women made particularly apt administrators. In addition, she was keeper of the Advocates' Library, one of the Faculty of Advocates' main honorary posts, from 1956 to 1969. Her successor, A. J. Mackenzie-Stuart, later became the first United Kingdom judge in Europe. Kidd was also editor of the Court of Session law reports of the 'Scots Law Times' from 1942 until 1976. During all that time she never failed to meet her set timetable, and wrote her reporters' reports for them where they had failed. Her editor's strength lay in her ability to marshal facts in an orderly fashion. 
Kidd had a very active public role in Scotland. She cared about her Christian faith. An assistant lecturer in public law at Edinburgh University, she was also a founder member of the Stair Society. She became a vice-president of the Federation of University Women and of the Electrical Association for Women. A tireless worker for a number of charities, she acted as chairwoman of the Queen's Nursing Institute in Scotland and for Blind Welfare. In addition, Kidd served as a member of the royal commission on betting, lotteries and gaming in 1950 (and said that she always enjoyed a good point-to-point). In 1975 she was made a DBE. She received an honorary LLD from Dundee University in 1982 and Edinburgh University in 1984. 
Kidd was a traditionalist, a Conservative by temperament and training. But she could be both formidable and constructive in her criticism of the legal and university institutions of Scotland and of the Conservative Party. Professionally, she did not consider herself discriminated against. Never impressed by her own success, she said that she 'had a lot of luck to be in the right place at the right time'. Those who knew her well pointed to her remarkable integrity, self-discipline, and sheer hard work. As Lord Hope of Craighead said at her death, 'Her success was won by strength of character, courage and integrity and it is a mark of her true qualities that despite what might seem to be the revolutionary nature of her achievements she always held the affection and respect of others. (Hope)' Dame Margaret Kidd died at 53 Madingley Road, Cambridge, on 22 March 1989. A funeral service was held at the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh. The Scottish bar, and its lady members in particular, owe her a deep debt for the qualities and standards she brought and maintained as its first lady member.

Laurie, John Paton (1897-1980), actor, was born on 25 March 1897 at 3 Ryedale Terrace, Maxwelltown, Kirkcudbrightshire, the fifth of the six children of William Laurie (1856-1903), a Dumfries tweed mill superintendent and kirk elder, and his wife, Jessie Brown (1858-1935). Although born into a family rooted in covenanting traditions, Laurie soon became a 'lapsed Presbyterian'. A more significant childhood influence was Robert Burns's association with Dumfries. Laurie once introduced a Burns broadcast with 'His songs and poems were in the air I breathed' (Laurie MSS). 
Leaving Dumfries Academy in 1914, Laurie joined an architect's firm. From 1916 he served with the Honourable Artillery Company at the Somme and Paschendale. Invalided out, he returned to architecture in 1918. However, in 1920, the urge to act took him to a summer school of speech and drama at Stratford. Convinced by the revelation of Bridges-Adam's productions, he abandoned architecture and went to London to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama, where the renowned voice teacher Elsie Fogerty transformed his life. 
John Laurie first appeared on stage in Dumfries in 1921 in J. M. Barrie's 'What every Woman Knows'. Later that year he joined the London Old Vic to play Pistol in 'The Merry Wives of Windsor'. He performed regularly with the company until 1925, building an impressive list of credits in Shakespearian and classical roles under the director Robert Atkins. After a spell with the Stratford Festival Society Company in 1926, playing Autolycus in 'The Winter's Tale' and Conrad in 'Love's Labours Lost', followed by a period in the West End, he returned to Stratford to play Hamlet in 1927. From 1927 to 1929 leading roles at the Old Vic included both Macbeth and Hamlet. The Old Vic director Harcourt Williams wrote of his incisive diction, his Scottish vigour, and his warm personality (Williams, 77). 
In 1939 Laurie launched his screen career in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Juno and the Paycock'. He made over a hundred films, including 'The 39 Steps' (1935), 'The Four Feathers' (1939), and 'Kidnapped' (1960). With his dark wavy hair and piercing eyes, he became familiar as the dour miser or the eccentric pessimist -- usually Scottish. Until 1939 he alternated between the Old Vic, Stratford, and the West End, playing in Ibsen and in Shakespeare in roles ranging from Feste to Othello and from Malvolio to Richard III. Laurie's work then diversified and he appeared, for example, in Shaw's 'Heartbreak House' (West End, 1943), 'John Knox' (Glasgow Citizens' Theatre, 1947), and 'Tiger at the Gates' (New York, 1955). He toured Australia with J. C. Williamson's Shakespeare Company in 1959, the USSR, America, and Europe with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1964, and he joined the Chichester Festival Company in 1966. 
Work increasingly focused on television, mainly in drama series such as 'Armchair Theatre' and 'Play of the Month'. In 1968 the BBC broadcast the first episode of the legendary comedy series 'Dad's Army'. Ironically, Laurie's characterization of Private Fraser, with the catch-phrase 'We're all doomed', bestowed on him unprecedented popular recognition. Such fame tended to obscure his fine reputation as a classical actor of which he was rightly proud. Nevertheless he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in early 1980. A man of no regrets, he gladly accepted all work offered. 
As a founder member of the Apollo Society -- dedicated to the performance of music and poetry -- he was able to combine his principal relaxation, reading, with his profession. He was a celebrated exponent of Burns and McGonagall. EMI recorded a Burns concert, entitled 'The Kindling Fire' in 1974. Laurie, with a keen sense of humour and a generous nature, was known for his outspokenness. He was invited to compile an anthology of Scottish literature in 1974 and his introduction to 'My Favourite Scottish Stories' -- 'Actors as men of letters are rare birds' -- surely revealed how he saw himself. 
Laurie's first wife, the Old Vic actress Florence Mary Saunders ('b'. 1891), died in 1926. He married Oonah Veronica Todd-Naylor (1901-1990), a teacher, in 1928. Their only child, Veronica, was born in 1939. Ties with Scotland notwithstanding, he made his home in England. He died from emphysema and respiratory failure on 23 June 1980 in Chalfont Hospital, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, and was cremated in July at Amersham cemetery.

Little, Kenneth Lindsay (1908-1991), anthropologist, was born at 97 Priory Road, West Derby, Liverpool, on 19 September 1908, the son of Harold Muir Little, a ship broker, and his wife, Annie, 'nee' Livesey. Little was educated at Liverpool College and at Selwyn College, Cambridge, as a mature student in the late 1930s, having previously worked in a repertory theatre. His interest was in physical anthropology, and when the lecturer was called up for military service, Little left the students' benches for the lecturer's rostrum and finished off the course. Declared medically unfit for the armed forces, he was appointed William Wyse student at Trinity College, Cambridge, and an assistant in the Duckworth laboratory. In this capacity he travelled to Cardiff in the summer vacation of 1940 to study the stature of what he called, in the terminology of the time, the 'Anglo-negroid cross'. It was a kind of research that led into a dead end, but while in Cardiff Little became interested in the social aspects of black-white interaction and racial discrimination -- then referred to as the colour bar. His London PhD thesis (supervised by Raymond Firth and published in 1948 as 'Negroes in Britain') brought together elements from the British tradition of social surveys with lessons from the Chicago school of sociology and the Lynds' 'Middletown'. Balancing this with a history of racial attitudes, Little developed a novel theory that 'colour-class-consciousness' underlay racial discrimination in Britain. By the time the book was published, Little was in Sierra Leone conducting an ethnographic study of the Mende which, in addition to its careful examination of rice farming, paid much more attention to social change than did other contemporary ethnographies. He returned to an appointment at the London School of Economics as lecturer in anthropology, with special reference to race relations. 
Moving to head the department of social anthropology at the University of Edinburgh in 1950 (first as reader, then from 1965 as professor and from 1971 as professor of African urban studies, becoming emeritus in 1978), Little started a programme of research into British racial relations and then another into the changes associated with urbanization in west Africa. He travelled extensively, both to teach and to study. His early invitation to Fisk University (Nashville, Tennessee) and his other visits to US universities meant a lot to him, but he was particularly proud of having established the department of social anthropology at the University of Sudan in Khartoum while on leave from Edinburgh. More than most Europeans of his generation, Little struck up easy personal relations with members of the new African elite, male and female, and wrote about their parts in the changes their societies were undergoing. This was not the kind of research that builds prestige in universities. It could invoke no intellectual tradition and it challenged the prevailing demarcation of social anthropology and sociology. Its pursuit required a measure of courage as well as independence of mind, but by his pioneering work Little made it easier for his junior colleagues to take up such studies. 
In 1968 Little was appointed the first chairman of the home secretary's advisory committee on race relations research, but cerebral malaria -- contracted on a visit to Ghana -- prevented him from exploiting the new research opportunities that were opening in this field and occasioned his move sideways within the university. After 'The Mende of Sierra Leone' (1951) and the UNESCO booklet 'Race and Society' (1952) he went on to author 'West African Urbanization' (1967), 'African Women in Towns' (1973), 'Urbanization as a Social Process' (1974), and 'The Sociology of Urban Women's Image in African Literature' (1980). On 28 August 1939 he had married Birte Hoeck; they had a daughter, Katherine, and a son, John. After the dissolution of this marriage he was married from 2 June 1956 to 1979 to Iris Mary Buchanan, 'nee' Cadogan, a nursing sister. He died at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Edinburgh, on 28 February 1991.

Littlejohn, James (1921-1988), social anthropologist, was born on 20 April 1921 at Clydevale, Clydesdale Street, Hamilton, Lanarkshire, the second of three sons and a daughter of James Argentine Littlejohn, schoolteacher, and his wife, Ann Robertson, 'nee' Shanks. From Hamilton Academy (1933-9) he went with a Kitchener bursary to the University of Glasgow, where he matriculated in the faculty of arts in 1939 and studied English literature, history, and philosophy. Before he graduated he was called up in 1941 into the Cameron Highlanders. After officer training at Poona, he was posted to the 14th Punjabi regiment and was in action in the Burma campaign. After the war he was with the Black Watch before being discharged in 1947. It was in India that he met his future wife, Isabella (Ann) Anderson. 
James Littlejohn's academic career was spent entirely in the service of the University of Edinburgh. In 1948, after completing a postgraduate diploma in anthropology at the London School of Economics, he was appointed to the department of social anthropology of the university. In 1971 he succeeded Professor Kenneth Little to the chair of social anthropology. When he retired in 1983 he was elected emeritus professor and university fellow. For his doctorate Littlejohn conducted ethnographic field work in the parish of Eskdalemuir, in the Scottish borders, between 1949 and 1951. The results were presented in 1955 in a thesis entitled 'The social structure of a Scottish rural community'. The rather prosaic title conceals an intellectually ambitious project which has come to be recognized as an outstanding success. Littlejohn showed how contemporary social and cultural differentiation in the parish was the outcome of a relatively recent historical process transforming a locally determined agrarian community into one organized by a class structure embedded in the wider national social system of the United Kingdom. He also sought to find out how far anthropological techniques of research could be used effectively in the study of modern society. In this respect his research was the first study in Britain of social class by an anthropologist. The effectiveness of such techniques is evidenced in his pioneering analysis of the relationship of men and women to the class system. The thesis was published in 1963 as 'Westrigg: the Sociology of a Cheviot Parish'. 
Littlejohn then became part of a major multidisciplinary research project into industrialization and urbanization in Africa. The focus of this research was the mining town of Lunsar in Sierra Leone. Littlejohn's particular objective was to provide ethnographic data about a world defined in terms of magical relations changing into one of technical and rational relations. Field research among Temne-speaking people began in April 1959 and continued until March 1960. As in the earlier work in Scotland, Littlejohn set about investigating, through anthropological research into everyday life at a local level, historical processes of great generality. However, he was now attempting to document and explain something much more problematical: a human trajectory which Max Weber had called 'the disenchantment of the world'. In a series of articles, of which the best-known is 'The Temne house', first published in 1960 and reprinted in 'Mythology and Symbolism', edited by John Middleton (1967), he attempted to elucidate forms of knowledge and modes of thought in 'a world from which the gods have not yet departed'. In 1977 he returned to Sierra Leone and carried out further research with Temne diviners. Some of the results were presented in his unpublished Frazer lecture 'Magic boughs', at the University of Oxford on 30 November 1978. In all this work he became increasingly aware that notions such as that of 'sign', 'system', or 'metaphor' as organizing principles of knowledge were inextricably contaminated with their own European history and, while they could not provide him with concepts adequate to the larger task he had set himself, they were, as a result, subject to searching critical analysis. 
Jimmy Littlejohn (as he was widely known) died at his home, 14 Merchiston Avenue, Edinburgh, on 17 October 1988 after a short illness. His funeral took place at Mortonhall crematorium, Edinburgh. He is remembered by his students, many of whom now enjoy academic distinction themselves, as an inspiring teacher and intellectual, but also as a reserved and rather private man.

Lorimer, William Laughton (1885-1967), classical scholar and translator, was born in Strathmartine, near Dundee, on 27 June 1885, the son of the Revd Robert Lorimer (1840-1925), a minister in the United Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Isabella Lockhart Robertson (1849-1931). Lorimer was educated at Dundee high school, at Fettes College, Edinburgh, and at Trinity College, Oxford. After graduating from Oxford in 1910 he lived permanently in St Andrews, except for a period of military service in the First World War. A fondness for Italy, developed during a few months' residence there in 1904-5, later prompted him to active efforts in support of Italian prisoners of war. Lorimer held teaching posts in Latin and Greek at St Andrews University and University College, Dundee. In 1915 he married Marion Rose Gordon (died 1922). They had one son, Robert Lewis Campbell (Robin) Lorimer (1918-1996). A second marriage, made in 1929 during a period of extreme distress and despondency, was annulled within a year. From his boyhood Lorimer had shown a consuming interest in Scots vernacular speech, beginning by collecting words from the dialect of Strathmartine in Angus (his father's parish): the knowledge so obtained enabled him to become a valuable informant and consultant for the 'Scottish National Dictionary' and latterly also its chairman. 
Despite valuable publications on Greek and Latin texts and on the demographic history of Gaelic, Lorimer's most important achievement was the work of his retirement from the chair of Greek at St Andrews. This was his Scots translation of the 'New Testament', made directly from the Greek originals and prepared for by a long and distinguished life of scholarship in classical literature and lexicography, the written and spoken forms of Scots, and the tradition of 'Bible' translation in many European languages and dialects. Lorimer's aim was to revitalize the declining Scots vernacular tongue by producing a monumental prose work exploiting the full resources of the language. In this he succeeded triumphantly. As a literary and linguistic achievement, the only parallel in Scots letters to his testament is the sixteenth-century translation of the 'Aeneid' by Gavin Douglas. Lorimer's translation contains many rare words of local currency but almost none of the literary archaisms frequent in modern Scots writing, and conveys the rhythms, cadences, and idiomatic phrasing of spoken Scots with unerring skill. Perhaps uniquely among 'Bible' translations, his style is deliberately varied to reflect the characteristics of the original books. The complete work, edited by his son Robin Lorimer, was not published until 1983, sixteen years after William Laughton Lorimer's death of cancer at 18 Eglinton Crescent, Edinburgh, on 25 May 1967. His body was cremated and the ashes interred in the cemetery at Sanquhar, Dumfriesshire, where a memorial to him was erected in the church. Lorimer's Scots 'New Testament' has been widely read and appreciated, sometimes being used in services of worship, and is recognized as the most complete demonstration in recent literature of the expressive power of Scots.
