Johann Elias Haid (1739-1809) were members of a distinguished artistic family from Augsburg, the place of their birth. Johann Gottfried was trained by his father, Johann Lorenz Haid, and Johann Elias by his elder brother. They worked almost exclusively for Boydell during a period in London from 1764 to 1767, producing prints after Zoffany, Reynolds, and the old masters. After that date Johann Elias returned to Augsburg, where he died in 1809, while Johann Gottfried went to Vienna to teach at the new Kupferstecher-Academie; he died in that city in 1776.

Georg Siegmund Facius (b. c.1750, d. in or before 1813) were both born in Regensburg about 1750. Specialists in stipple-engraving, they studied in Brussels, where their father was Russian consul. They were working exclusively for Boydell in London from 1776, and collaboratively they engraved and stippled for him several plates after William Hamilton and Angelica Kauffmann, James Barry's 'Birth of Venus' (1778), and reproductions of Sir Joshua Reynolds's stained-glass windows for New College, Oxford (1785). Georg Facius also showed miniatures at the Royal Academy between 1785 and 1788, giving addresses in Leicester Fields and Soho. The brothers contributed four large-format plates to the 'Shakspeare Gallery', being paid the higher rate of $367. In 1798 Farington reported that one or other Facius was among the many foreigners imprisoned, but he was bailed out by Boydell. One of their last jobs for Boydell was a plate after West's 'Ascension', published on 2 January 1797, though they were still active in 1813.

Jean Baptiste Michel (1738/1748-1804), born in Paris in 1738 or 1748, studied in that city under Pierre Chenu (1718-1780), who had also worked for Boydell. Michel moved to London about 1780 and specialized in engravings combining line and stipple techniques. His first print for Boydell was 'William de Albanac presents his three daughters to Alfred III, king of Mercia', after West (published 9 November 1782), and plates for the 'Houghton Gallery'. He also worked on two of the large-format plates for the 'Shakspeare Gallery', and was paid the higher rate of $367. He is said to have produced more than thirty plates for Boydell over the years. Michel died in 1804.

John Peter Simon (1764?-c.1810) enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools on 31 December 1778, giving his age as '14 1st August last', though most authorities give his date of birth as about 1750. Specializing in stipple, Simon contributed to Worlidge's 'Collection of Drawings from Curious Antique Gems' (1768) and produced many prints after contemporary British artists, notably William Hamilton and Reynolds. He contributed to Boydell's 'Houghton Gallery', engraved individual plates, notably after Thomas Gainsborough's 'The Woodman' (published 1791), and produced fifteen large plates and four small plates for the 'Shakspeare Gallery'. This output included the small version of Opie's 'Capulet Finds Juliet Dead' (1792), which was rejected by Boydell, who later commissioned William Blake to produce an alternative version. Simon's plates for the gallery are marred by the poor reproduction of the etched underdrawing. He is said to have died around 1810.

William Caddick (1719/20-1794). The events of his life and his paintings have often been confused with those of his sons,

William Caddick (1756-1784). Seven portraits by the family are in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; of these two are definitely by the father and one is by Richard. Eleven more whose attributions are traditional but not always safe are known from reproductions (among these is a portrait of Thomas Bentley, the Liverpool-based partner of Josiah Wedgwood); a further handful are known only from early sources and exhibition records. 
The elder William is said to have been the son of William Caddick, Liverpool mercer, but the fact that the artist spelt his name Caddock in early life casts doubt on this, and he may have been the son William born on 9 April 1719 to William Chadock, shoemaker (although at his death on 29 December 1794 his age was given as seventy-four). Later accounts state that Caddick studied alongside George Stubbs and the marine painter Richard Wright. Entries for October 1746 in a diary kept by Caddick's friend William Clarke, when both men were working in Chester, show that Caddick often saw Wright and was in contact with Stubbs. This diary, which provides a unique glimpse of Caddick's early life, chiefly describes a short trip Clarke and Caddick made to London in August 1746, when they visited artists' studios, including those of Hudson, Ramsay, and Rysbrack, bought prints, and enjoyed life on the town. 
Caddick's first securely attributed work, a small portrait of Aaron Wood of the Burslem family of potters (who were related by marriage to the Wedgwoods), is traditionally dated to the following year. An undated portrait of Wood's sister Eliza (1724-1795), whom Caddick married about this time, was probably intended as its companion. The Caddicks and Woods apparently remained close. In 1768 Aaron Wood commissioned his nephew Richard Caddick to paint a portrait of his daughter Elizabeth; and about 1770 her younger brother Enoch was sent to Liverpool for three months to be instructed by all three Caddicks 'in the art of drawing, Perspective, Anatomy &c &c' (memorandum by Enoch Wood on the reverse of the portrait of Aaron Wood, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). A group portrait of about 1790 attributed to Richard Caddick in which items of pottery are prominent probably represents members of the two families. Liverpool's growth as a centre for the manufacture of pottery undoubtedly gained momentum from their connection. 
William and Eliza had seven children, four boys and three girls, of whom Richard Caddick, born on 7 June 1748 at Old Hall Street, Liverpool, and baptized on 4 July at St Nicholas's Church, Liverpool, was probably the oldest. He and his brother William are the only two known to have reached maturity. If the statement by later local historians is true that Richard was a founder member of the first Society of Artists of Liverpool in 1769, his youthful reputation must have been considerable; but this may represent a confusion with his father, who the same sources say was elected president of the society when it was re-constituted shortly afterwards. A similar uncertainty exists over the authorship of the Caddicks' grandest work, the portrait of the Liverpool builder Joseph Brooks (1774). This chronic confusion, as well as the fact that almost always only one of the family is recorded in street directories, suggests that they operated virtually interchangeably as a family practice. 
During the 1780s Richard probably lived away from Liverpool. The catalogue of the Society for Promoting Painting and Design in Liverpool's 1784 exhibition, at which he showed three portraits of gentlemen, describes him as 'visitor'; and he is absent from its exhibition of 1787 altogether. From 1790, however, he is recorded as portrait painter in Old Hall Street, Liverpool; this corresponds with his father's disappearance from the directories following his death on 29 December 1794. About this time, too, Richard married. He and his wife, Martha (who died aged sixty-five in 1829), had one daughter, also Martha, born in 1797. Richard evidently gave up painting altogether about 1800. Between 1805 and 1829 he is described in street directories as 'gentleman'. He died about 22 May 1831, leaving his daughter an estate valued at under $4000, and was buried on 27 May. 
Of the younger William, born on 16 June 1756, and baptized in St Nicholas's Church, Liverpool, on 13 July, almost nothing is known. The register recording his death on 12 March 1784 describes him as portrait painter, but no work can be certainly ascribed to him. Probably, however, it was he rather than his father who sent 'Portrait in the Character of Circe' to the Royal Academy in 1780, the only work exhibited by any member of the family in London. With the exception of this last work, all above-mentioned portraits that survive are in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.

John Bartholomew (1890-1962), who took over the firm on his father's death, was born at 12 Blacket Place, Edinburgh, on 12 February 1890. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh and studied cartography at the universities of Leipzig and Paris before taking an MA at Edinburgh University. In 1914 he was commissioned into the Gordon Highlanders and served in France and Flanders; he was awarded the MC in 1915 and later served on Haig's staff. His younger brother Hugh was killed in the war. On 22 May 1920 he married Marie Antoinette (1898-1972), the third daughter of Dr Georges Leon Hyacinthe Sarolea (1864-1928), a physician of Hasselt, Belgium, and his wife, Marie Felicite Goetsbloets (1871-1898). They had four sons and two daughters, one of whom died young. Also in 1920 he succeeded to the management of the family business. Ian continued many of his father's cartographic ventures, notably the association with 'The Times', and began new ones, such as the production of road maps to satisfy the demand of an expanding motoring market. He took an interest in the whole spectrum of the business from technical and cartographical aspects, including improvements to inks and papers and the introduction of rotary offset printing machines, to the design of new map projections for the age of global air travel. In 1921 he was appointed cartographer to George V. Ian Bartholomew was very active in geographical circles, being a member of the permanent committee of geographical names from 1926, a member of the national committee on geography based at the Royal Society from 1941, and honorary secretary of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society from 1920, acting as president in 1950-54; he was also instrumental in establishing the chair in geography at the University of Edinburgh, completing a project his father had begun. He was deeply attached to Scotland and was a trustee of the National Library of Scotland and active in the National Trust for Scotland. A shy man, he received various honours, notably the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1961. That same year he was appointed CBE. He died in Edinburgh on 9 February 1962, having become severely disabled by arthritis in his later years, and was survived by his wife, who died on 14 January 1972. 
Following service in the Second World War, three of Ian's sons joined the firm: John Christopher (1923-2008) became cartographic director in 1953, Robert Gordon ('b'. 1927) was production director from 1954 to 1986, and Peter Hugh (1924-1987) became chairman in 1956. John assisted his father in editing the plates of the mid-century edition of 'The Times Atlas of the World' to reflect post-war changes and was later responsible for a number of new specialist atlases, among them the 'Atlas of Europe' (1974) and 'Family Atlas of the World' (1983). 
In 1980 the company was sold to the Reader's Digest Corporation and in 1985 it passed to Rupert Murdoch's News International Corporation. It was then amalgamated with a sister News Corporation company, Harper Collins publishers in Glasgow, and continued to produce Bartholomew maps and atlases under the name Harper Collins Cartographic.

Richard Lee (c.1774-1798?), publisher and radical, known as Citizen Lee, also joined the LCS and emerged from obscurity to play an intriguing and important role in London radicalism during the mid-1790s. Nothing is known of his background, but he appears to have grown up in poverty, and by 1794, aged about twenty, he lived in Orange Street, Leicester Fields. At that time he worked as a clerk in a merchant's office and became a frequent visitor to Eaton's bookshop. In this radical milieu Lee acquired an interest in political writing and poetry, and during the course of his career he published no fewer than fifty titles under his own imprint. Under the sign of the Tree of Liberty he moved premises frequently during 1795, trading at various times from his mother's shop in St Ann's Court, Soho, 47 Haymarket, 98 Berwick Street, Soho, and then 444 Strand. Lee's connection with the LCS proved brief and unstable. As a Methodist he disapproved of the society's growing tendencies to support deism and atheism in the mid-1790s and he was reputedly expelled for refusing to sell Paine's 'Age of Reason' and Volney's 'Ruins'. Despite distancing himself from the LCS, Lee was arrested in November 1795 for publishing the regicidal handbill 'King Killing' (1795), Edward Iliff's 'A summary of the duties of citizenship. Written expressly for the members of the London Corresponding Society' (1795), as well as two extracts from the radical pamphleteer Charles Pigott. On 19 December 1795 he escaped custody and within days was bound for Hamburg, ironically eloping with the wife of James Powell, one of the most diligent government spies to join the LCS. Within six months Lee had moved to Philadelphia, where he peddled copies of his publications and published the 'American Magazine' until 1797. According to William Cobbett, Lee was in gaol during 1798, but nothing further is known of his career; it seems likely that he died, possibly from yellow fever, soon after his release from prison. 
While booksellers and printers were important allies in the society's educative and 'moral force' programme, some also had close links with 'physical force' activists. The booksellers John Bone and Thomas Evans, for example, both rose to prominence within the LCS and were members of the clandestine and revolutionary United Englishmen. Thomas Spence was also involved with a shadowy group known as the Loyal Lambeth Association (LLA), which drilled its members in the use of arms. There were significant overlaps in membership of the LLA and the LCS, with John Philip Franklow, one-time assistant secretary of the LCS, and John Shelmerdine, a hatter and member of division 12 of the Corresponding Society, the founders of the LLA in 1793.

Margaret Mann Phillips (1906-1987), Renaissance scholar and translator, was born at Kimberworth, Yorkshire, on 23 January 1906, the daughter of the Revd Francis Arthur Mann, who was then curate of Kimberworth, and his wife, Martha Hannah, 'nee' Haigh. She was educated at York College for Girls, an autobiographical account of her schooldays (1919-1924) being published posthumously, and Somerville College, Oxford, taking a first in modern languages (specializing in French) in 1927, followed by a diploma in education in 1928. After undertaking postgraduate research at the Sorbonne, Manchester University, and Westfield College, London, she took a doctorate at the University of Paris (1934) and was appointed an assistant lecturer at Manchester University (1934-6). In 1936 she became lecturer in French and director of studies in modern languages at Newnham College, Cambridge, resigning in 1945 to devote more time to her family.

Lucy Sherrard Atkinson (1817-1893), traveller and writer, was born at Sunderland, co. Durham, on 15 April 1817, the fourth child and eldest daughter among the ten children of Matthew Finley (died 1847) and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of William York, perfumer. It was a large, impecunious family and at the end of the 1830s she went to Russia, where she lived for eight years in St Petersburg as governess to the daughter of a General Muravyov. In 1846 she met Thomas Atkinson, whom she married in 1848. Between 1848 and 1853 she accompanied her husband on his travels through Siberia, south to the Kirgiz steppes and eastwards as far as Irkutsk and the Chinese border before they returned to Britain in 1854. In his memoirs Sir Francis Galton records that they were much visited by the Russian nobility at their cottage in Old Brompton Road (Galton, 176-7). After her husband's death in 1861 Lucy Atkinson, on applying to the Treasury for moneys owed to her husband, was informed that she was not legally Atkinson's wife as the woman he had married before he went to Russia was still living in Britain. No news of him had reached the claimant, Rebekah Atkinson, living as a lodger at 5 Beaufort Street, Chelsea, who held a different social position, until informed by a friend of her husband's death. In 1863 Lucy Atkinson, or 'Mrs Atkinson' as her friends continued to call her, published 'Recollections of the Tartar Steppes and their Inhabitants' (repr. 1972), and that year was granted a civil-list pension of $100.

Robert Thomson (1622-1694), merchant, had emigrated to Massachusetts in the 1630s, where he purchased the old Boston meeting-house. He returned to England and became a major in a London regiment, serving as rear-admiral in the 1642 'sea adventure' expedition to Ireland. Apparently a presbyterian, he was purged from the London militia committee in 1648 though 'a valiant and faithful commander' (Liu, 60). In 1649 he was appointed a commissioner to regulate the navy and the customs, and to the commission for propagating the gospel in New England. In the 1640s he was engaged in the East Indies trade and was active in his brother Maurice's Assada adventure. He acted as a commissioner in disputes between patentees for Connecticut and Rhode Island and was reputed to have offered $13,000 for New York. In 1663 Pepys said he talked 'very highly of liberty of conscience, which now he hopes for by the King's declaration' (Pepys, 4, 5). He represented the East India Company at the 1667 treaty of Breda and in negotiations for the purchase of Bombay. Elected deputy governor, he was involved in secret discussions with the crown over trade to Japan and the East, and was a supporter of Increase Mather's plans for New England. With his wife, Frances, he had six children, and he died at Stoke Newington in 1694.

Isabella Young (bap. 1716?, d. 1795), singer, was probably the Isabella baptized as the daughter of John and Elizabeth Young at St Lawrence Jewry on 3 January 1716. She sang at Drury Lane in the 1733-4 season, making her stage debut as Amphitrite in 'The Tempest' ('Daily Journal', 26 Nov 1733). She appeared in concerts before joining the Covent Garden company in the role of Margery, the heroine of John Frederick Lampe's burlesque opera 'The Dragon of Wantley' on 26 October 1737. The opera, with its delightfully inane libretto by Henry Carey, proved hugely successful and was performed night after night, including 31 January 1738, the day of Isabella's marriage to John Frederick Lampe (1702/3-1751). In the sequel, 'Margery, or, A Worse Plague than the Dragon' (9 December 1738), the heroine falls prey to jealousy, but there is no evidence that the Lampes' marriage was other than happy. They worked together and Isabella took the female lead in all her husband's later stage pieces, among them 'The Parting Lovers' (1739) and 'Pyramus and Thisbe' (1745). For the two seasons 1748-50 the Lampes were engaged by Thomas Sheridan at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, and they then moved to Edinburgh. Their arrival was delayed because Isabella had been seriously ill with a fever in Dublin, but it was Lampe who died from fever on 25 July 1751 in Edinburgh, where he had been 'settled very much to the satisfaction of the patrons of Music in that city, and of himself' (Burney, 4.672). Isabella returned to London and Covent Garden, and performed there every season until 1776, although her appearances grew less frequent in the later years. Her son, Charles John Frederick Lampe (died 1767), succeeded his grandfather as organist at All Hallows Barking in 1758, and his wife, Ann, sang at the pleasure gardens and Sadler's Wells in the 1760s. Isabella lived with her sister Esther, whom she cared for tenderly during a long illness. She died on 5 January 1795.

Esther Young (1717-1795), singer, was born on 14 February 1717. She joined her sisters in a benefit concert for their father at Mercers' Hall on 11 February 1736, sang with Isabella in Arne's 'Grand Epithalamium' at Drury Lane that April, and made her Covent Garden debut as the heroine's rival, Mauxalinda, in Lampe's 'The Dragon of Wantley' in October 1737. She performed in almost every season at Covent Garden until she and her sister Isabella retired in 1776, taking numerous roles in musical afterpieces and pantomimes; she was the company's Lucy in 'The Beggar's Opera' from 1746 to 1761. In Handel's oratorio season in 1744 Esther created the contralto roles of Juno and Ino in 'Semele'. On 8 April 1762 she married Charles Jones, a music-seller, horn player, and flautist, who on his death on 17 March 1780 left everything to his loving wife. She had been seriously ill for some years by December 1785, when the tenor John Beard wrote to the Royal Society of Musicians in support of a pension for her, describing her blameless and amiable character. She survived her sister Isabella by a few months and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 6 June 1795.

Isabella Young (1740/41?-1791), singer, was the daughter of Charles Young, the Treasury clerk. A pupil of the bass Gustavus Waltz, she made her first appearance singing with him at a concert for her benefit at the Haymarket Theatre on 18 March 1751. The following year at her benefit she sang and played 'one of Mr. Handel's Organ Concertos' ('General Advertiser', 2 March 1752). Her father died in January 1754, and that spring she appeared in Arne's 'Alfred', described in the 'Daily Advertiser' as a thirteen-year-old pupil of Arne, and in his 'Rosamond' and 'Eliza'. She joined the Drury Lane company to take the part of Titania in the premiere of John Christopher Smith's opera 'The Fairies' on 3 February 1755 and the following February sang Ariel in Smith's opera 'The Tempest'. She appeared at Drury Lane frequently until 1777 as an entr'acte singer, in musical afterpieces, and in singing roles, such as Ariel in Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. Handel employed her as his mezzo-soprano soloist in the last five oratorio seasons before his death in 1759 and she performed in 'Messiah' at the Foundling Hospital on several occasions. She sang at Ranelagh and, being in demand at provincial festivals, at Oxford, Cambridge, Winchester, and Leicester and at the Three Choirs meetings from 1763 to 1765. The 'Oxford Journal' of 12 April 1766 reported indignantly that she had not been engaged for Handel's 'L'allegro' because she required 'Two and Forty Guineas, for one Night's Attendance'. 
On 12 December 1757 Isabella married the Hon. John Scott, younger brother of Henry Scott, fourth earl of Deloraine. She continued to appear on stage as Miss Young until 1769, although she sang as Mrs Scott in oratorios. Her only son, John Scott (baptized on 23 November 1758), became a midshipman in the Royal Navy and was killed in action against the Americans on 9 October 1776. She retired from singing at the end of the 1776-7 season and died at her house in Kennington Lane, Vauxhall, on 17 August 1791. Her husband had died at his chambers in Gray's Inn on 31 December 1788 and in her will she left an annuity to her sister Mary Barthelemon and the bulk of her estate to Mary's daughter Cecilia Maria.

Elizabeth Young (1741?-1773), singer, was the daughter of Charles Young and was probably younger than her sister Isabella, who began her singing career earlier. Elizabeth was said to be over twenty-one on her marriage in 1762. She went with the Arnes and her young sister Mary to Dublin in autumn 1755 and took minor roles in the season of Arne operas at the Smock Alley Theatre. She seems to have returned to London with Arne in 1756 and that December sang in his 'Eliza' as First Shepherdess. In a charity benefit performance of 'The Beggar's Opera' at Drury Lane in June 1758 she played Lucy, her first speaking role, billed as 'the first Time of her appearing on any Stage' ('Public Advertiser', 22 June 1758). She was a member of the Drury Lane company from autumn 1758, appearing as Mrs Dorman after her marriage to the violinist Ridley Dorman on 9 October 1762. In February 1764 George Rush's opera 'The Royal Shepherd' was premiered with Thomas Norris, a falsetto alto, as Agenor. He was badly received and on the second night 'Mrs Dormond perform'd in his room, much applauded' ('London Stage', pt 4, 1042). She created the old maidservant Ursula in Charles Dibdin's highly successful comic opera 'The Padlock' (3 October 1768) and sang the role well over a hundred times; her last stage appearances were in June 1772. She died in the parish of St Anne's, Soho, on 12 April 1773 and was buried on 19 April at St Paul's, Covent Garden.

Educated at Gresham's School, Holt, from 1924 to 1929, he read engineering at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, overlapping in his final year with an apprenticeship at Metropolitan-Vickers, which he continued at C. A. Parsons & Co. In 1940 he joined Short Bros. at Rochester, where he soon rose to be chief aerodynamicist. He married in 1942 Dorothy De Bauduy Robertson (died 1979); they had two sons and a daughter. After the war he accompanied Shorts to Belfast, holding successively the posts of chief designer, technical director, and research director, contributing to the design of various swept-wing and vertical take-off planes.

Edward Bell (1844-1926) was born in Stockwell, London, in October 1844, and educated at St Paul's School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. After taking his degree in 1867 he joined his father's firm. In 1873 Bell married Alice van Rees Hoets (died 1917). They had three sons, including Arthur Hugh Bell ['see below'], and four daughters. A man of scholarly abilities, Bell translated, edited, and wrote works, adding to the firm's list in the field of art and architecture. Under his guidance there was a steady growth of the firm's educational business and he expanded the firm's trade with the empire through 'Bell's Indian and Colonial Library', a series which sold over 1,433,341 books between 1894 and 1911. 
The most important new textbooks published by the firm were Baker's and Bourne's mathematics books; these were followed later by the popular schoolbooks of C. V. Durell and Marc Ceppi's French books. In science Bell published the textbooks of the Nobel laureates Sir William Bragg and his son Professor W. L. Bragg, and he extended the firm's reputation on art and architecture with the works of Walter Crane, G. C. Williamson, and Sir Reginald Blomfield. 
Bell contributed to the firm's list of translations of the classics and definitive editions of standard English authors. He edited the poetical works of Thomas Chatterton (1875), and translated Goethe, producing 'Wilheim Meister's Travels' (1881) and 'Early and Miscellaneous Letters of Goethe' (1884); he also translated the 'Nibelungenlied' (1898). He wrote books on the architecture of ancient Egypt and western Asia, and the pre-Hellenic and Hellenic architecture of the Aegean, as well as various papers. 
Bell was the president of the Publishers' Association between 1906 and 1909, and took a leading part in the negotiations with the trade known as the book war, an attempt to establish price regulation which led to the net pricing of books, retelling the events in his account 'The Net Book Agreement, 1899, and the Book War, 1906-1908'. 
Bell's interests included sketching and photography. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, the Classical Association, and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, and was a member of the Wells and Camden Trust. He died on 8 November 1926 of heart failure at his home, The Mount, Hampstead, London. 
In 1904 the firm moved to purpose-built offices at York House, in Portugal Street, Kingsway, London. In 1910 George Bell & Sons became a private limited company and Edward and Ernest became directors. Ernest had followed his brother to Trinity College, Cambridge, and into the firm in 1874. He was an advocate of vegetarianism and contributed several books on the subject to the firm's list, including 'In a Nutshell: Cons and Pros of the Meatless Diet' (1920). He was a passionate defender of animal rights, writing for the 'Animal's Friend' and the Humanitarian League. In 1911 he was joined by another member of the family, Kenneth Norman Bell (1884-1951), grandson of the founder of the firm, who had returned from Toronto, where he had been a lecturer at the university, to take an active part in the business. In 1913 Kenneth was elected a director of the firm. Though after the First World War he resumed his academic career and became a tutor at Balliol College, Oxford, he continued his editorial interest in the company. After Edward's death Ernest Bell succeeded as chairman of the company and Edward's son, Colonel Arthur Hugh Bell, joined the board.

Arthur Hugh Bell (1878-1968) was born at 4 Fellows Road, Hampstead, London, on 16 April 1878. He was educated at Charterhouse School and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. On 10 October 1905 he married Gabrielle ('b'. 1883/4), daughter of James Kennedy. Bell's early career was in the Royal Engineers, and he served in the South African War from 1900 to 1902 and in the First World War from 1915 to 1916, when he was wounded. In 1917 and again in 1919-20 he was in India on the north-west frontier, Waziristan, and he served in the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919. He was appointed DSO (1916) and OBE (1919). He was posted to southern Ireland during the Anglo-Irish War (1920-21) and to Turkey in 1922-3, during the Chanak crisis. Bell retired from the army in 1928 to take a more active role in his father's company, becoming chairman in 1936. He continued to develop the firm's educational list, as conditions following the Second World War had created a need for new books and a new approach. Bell was also an expert on dowsing. In addition to a number of articles which he published in a military journal, he translated four French books on the subject and was the editor of 'Practical Dowsing' (1965). Arthur Hugh Bell died at his home, the Old Vicarage, Cuckfield, Sussex, on 21 February 1968. 
In 1977, on retiring as chairman, Richard Glanville, great-grandson of the founder, sold the list to Robin Hyman. The company, renamed Bell and Hyman Ltd, merged with Allen and Unwin in July 1986 to form Unwin Hyman. The Bell and Hyman imprint thus disappeared and in 1990 Unwin Hyman was sold to HarperCollins.

John Sutherland, seventh earl of Sutherland (d. in or before 1460), wrongly identified as Robert in the nineteenth century, is mentioned by the chronicler Wyntoun as having been knighted by his uncle, Alexander Stewart, earl of Buchan, when the latter took a Scottish contingent to Flanders in 1408. He was sent to England as a hostage for James I's ransom in 1427, probably very soon after the death of his father, and he remained there for many years, confined in Pontefract Castle, where he married Margaret Baillie (died 1509/10), probably a relative of one of his fellow hostages at Pontefract, Sir William Baillie of Hoprig and Lamington. Sutherland was still at Pontefract in July 1444, but had been released by May 1448, when he was at Dunrobin Castle, presenting a chaplain to the chapel of St Andrew at Golspie. On 29 April 1451 Sutherland and his wife received a crown charter of lands in the parish of Loth, Sutherland; the rents from these were reserved for their use during their lifetimes when, on 22 February 1456, Sutherland resigned his earldom into the hands of James II in favour of his son John. Three days later John was infeft in the lands of the earldom during his father's lifetime, by precept of sasine given by James II at Inverness. The reason for this move is unclear, but it may have been prompted by the earl's ill health. The seventh earl was dead by 1460, and was buried in the chapel of St Andrew at Golspie.

Mary Ann Kilner (1753-1831)], who was born on 14 December 1753 at Spittal Square, London, the youngest of the three children of James Maze (died 1794), a Huguenot immigrant and prosperous silk throwster and trader, and his wife, Marianne, 'nee' de Burmann (died in or before 1774). The bilingual Mary Ann was 'highly intellectual, [with] a fertile imagination and a feeling heart' (ibid.). The Maze family lived near the Kilners and shared their cultivated tastes. Mary Ann and Dorothy learned, played, and wrote together. They used the personae of Dorinda and Anna and kept up a verse-epistle soap opera about the lives and matrimonial problems of an imaginary titled family. On 18 September 1774 Dorothy's favourite brother, Thomas (1750-1812), married Mary Ann. Their move to Tom's home and silk-throwing business at 33 Spittal Square affected Dorothy's spirits profoundly. Her struggles (expressed in verse) to cultivate Christian contentment were rewarded with the birth in 1775 of Mary Ann's and Tom's daughter Mary Ann. Four more children followed, of whom Eliza ('b'. 1776) and Frances ('b'. 1783) survived. Thus began Dorothy's career as 'Aunt Do' and as a writer.

Harold Underwood Thompson (1911-1996), cartoonist and advertising and marketing executive, was born on 9 April of the same year, and where their father died on 5 June of a brain haemorrhage following food poisoning. The family decided to stay in Britain and eventually settled in Brighton; in the 1930s her mother married Gordon William Griffin. Beryl went briefly to a local junior school where she caught tuberculosis of the spine which confined her to bed from the age of nine until fifteen and entailed the loss of two fingers of her right hand, and a number of trips to a sanatorium in Switzerland. Taught at first by private governesses, she learned to write and draw with her left hand and attended the Royal Academy Schools (1928) and studied art under Stephen Spurrier for a year before becoming a freelance commercial and fashion artist. She also produced advertising posters and showcards jointly with her brother from about 1935. Harold himself attended the same junior school as his sister and later went to Brighton College, ran an antique shop in Hove in his late teens, and studied life drawing at Heatherley's School of Fine Art (1931-2). Here he met (and was subsequently briefly engaged to) Patricia Fell-Clark, a fellow student, later better known as the writer Patricia Angadi. He also studied lettering at St Martin's School of Art (1934), printing at Bolt Court, took private classes in illustration at Stephen Spurrier's school (1935), and spent two years drawing antique furniture in the Victoria and Albert Museum (1936-8). Self-taught as a cartoonist, he began submitting drawings (and self-illustrated short stories) under the pseudonym H. Botterill (Botterill was their paternal grandmother's maiden name) to 'The Bystander' (1935-7), the 'Evening News' (1936), and 'Night & Day' (1937).

Alexander Stephen (1795-1875), remained to work with his father in the Aberdeen yard. Their Footdee yard, William Stephen & Sons, was the more important of the yards, but in 1824 was still a small affair employing only thirty workers, building mainly brigs, barques, and schooners; these were generally of between 100 and 200 tons. The Arbroath yard did not prosper and was in financial difficulty from the early 1820s, causing William Stephen senior to sign a bond guaranteeing his son's debts. When William Stephen junior's creditors forced the closure of the Arbroath yard in 1828 his father could not meet the full claims and was himself forced into liquidation. The firm of William Stephen & Sons was dissolved on new year's day 1828, when William Stephen senior was sixty-nine. 
This enforced liquidation proved to be an opportunity for Alexander Stephen to enter shipbuilding on his own account. He acquired his father's bankrupt business and re-established it as Alexander Stephen & Sons; he also met his father's debts and took over responsibility for the Arbroath yard, where the debts were paid off over seven years. He chose not to operate two widely separated yards and decided to relocate from Footdee to Arbroath at the end of 1830. He immediately acquired the neighbouring yard to the small Arbroath establishment and began building there the next year. However, the long-term viability of the Arbroath site was threatened when the proposed Dundee and Arbroath railway line was routed through the yard. When construction was completed in 1840, the yard was much reduced in scale. Alexander Stephen then used his compensation payments to acquire the bankrupt stock of the New Shipbuilding Company at Dundee in 1842. He paid $550 for the stock and took the yard on a four-year lease of $150 per year, finally closing the Arbroath site in 1843 and transferring all his business to Dundee. 
Between 1814 and 1843 Alexander Stephen built ships at both Aberdeen and Arbroath, and during these years he and his sons were also ship repairers and ship operators, and entered the timber trade between the Baltic and Dundee, ranging also to the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Alexander Stephen was undoubtedly a successful businessman, but his daily diary, kept from 1824, gives some insight into his character. He was a disciplinarian, even ruthless, with his men; he frequently held down wages and costs to keep his yard in operation. He himself worked long hours, travelled widely for orders, and systematically collected information on prices, conditions, and commodities. Even when family tragedy struck, his rigid self-control was evident. His diary entry for Monday 7 June 1841 simply reads, 'My daughter Elisabeth was killed by the circular saw this afternoon'. Similarly, the move from Arbroath to Dundee is recorded briefly on Thursday 26 January 1843 as 'I have now commenced in Dundee by taking on the slip the schooner Sovereign belonging to the Dundee London Shipping Company'. In like vein his determination in front of labour problems is illustrated by an entry of 14 April 1845: 'Most of the journeymen left off work again because I discharged one of the ringleaders'. The Dundee yard was to be operated by the Stephens for fifty years from 1843 to 1893, during which time they built and launched ninety-seven ships. The longer-term future of the family, however, was to be associated with the Clyde, and in April 1850 Alexander Stephen agreed to rent a yard at Kelvinhaugh there at $800 per annum. 
The move was timely; the future in shipbuilding clearly lay with steam and iron, and the River Clyde was already the leading builder of iron and steam vessels in Britain, and indeed in the world at that time. The logistics of the Stephens' operating two yards, one on the Tay and the other on the Clyde, were eased by the fact that Alexander Stephen's three sons, William, John, and Alexander junior, had all entered the Dundee business. Alexander Stephen senior then went to Glasgow with his sons John and

Alexander Stephen junior (1832-1899) to establish the Kelvinhaugh enterprise, leaving the Dundee yard to be managed by his eldest son, William. He drew up a deed of co-partnery with William for the Dundee yard in 1856, and in 1858 he arranged for John and Alexander Stephen junior to take over the Kelvinhaugh concern. He himself then returned to work with William at Dundee in 1859. Alexander Stephen senior died of apoplexy at his home, Corona House, Broughty Ferry, Forfarshire, on 24 April 1875; he was survived by his wife, Elspeth Murray. 
The Kelvinhaugh yard was already large, employing over 500 men, and Alexander junior had ambitions for extending the business after his brother withdrew at the end of the 1850s. He quickly persuaded his older brother William, and his father, that combining the new iron framing with timber planking to create a composite style of construction had advantages over pure wood frames and struts, while at the same time having the advantages of a wooden hull which could be coppered and consequently escape the problem of fouling which beset iron hulls. He also achieved approval from Lloyd's Register in 1861 for constructing composite ships, being able to class these A1 for fifteen years. This inaugurated a period of composite ship construction at Kelvinhaugh, the Stephens concentrating on fast clipper ships which entered the tea races from China to Britain. The speed and strength of these vessels impressed the Admiralty, but also attracted the attention of agents of the Confederate states of America during the civil war. Alexander Stephen junior applied the same methods to building composite screw steamers, the first of which was the 'Sea King', built for Robertson & Co. of Glasgow. This vessel was repurchased in a roundabout way by the Confederate agents and was renamed the 'Shenandoah', a highly successful Confederate vessel. The Dundee yard of the Stephens also adopted the composite construction concept from 1865, but shortly after that was destroyed by fire and a new establishment had to be constructed between 1867 and 1868. At the same time the Kelvinhaugh lease was running out and Alexander Stephen junior negotiated the purchase of the Linthouse estate on the other bank of the Clyde in 1868, with possession early in 1869. In 1870 the Stephens launched their last ship at Kelvinhaugh and began the construction of their first vessel on the new Linthouse site. The long migration of the Stephens through the shipbuilding districts of Scotland had come to an end. 
The move to Linthouse coincided with a demand for larger and faster vessels. Alexander Stephen junior concentrated on gaining contracts and on the management and finance of the business, while his brother John was the engineer and outside manager. Alexander took after his father as a disciplinarian and hard worker, and followed his family's preference for adherence to the Free Church of Scotland, being an active member and elder though not a narrow zealot. He had a keen interest in education and was the first chairman of the Govan school board under the 1872 'Education Act'; he also defeated Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) to be the first elected chairman of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College, which was established in 1887. In public life he became lord dean of guild of the city of Glasgow in 1881 and was the first president of the Clyde Shipbuilders' Association in 1889. He was also a keen yachtsman. In 1857 he married Mary Templeton, who outlived him; they had two sons and a daughter. 
Alexander Stephen junior ensured that a fifth generation of Stephens would follow into the family business, taking his sons, Alexander Edward and

Frederic John Stephen (1863-1932), into partnership in 1887; the company secretary, Alexander Scott, and the yard manager, Robert McMaster, were also admitted as partners with a small share in the business at this time. With this new partnership Alexander Stephen junior remained firmly in control as senior partner, but then decided to withdraw from active management in 1894, passing control largely to his two sons, who were the dominant partners, though his brother John still remained as chairman of a company. The previous year had seen the closure of the Dundee enterprise when Alexander Stephen junior's brother, William, died suddenly; thereafter the Stephens built only at Linthouse on the Clyde. Alexander Stephen junior died on 19 May 1899 at 12 Park Terrace, Glasgow. 
During their apprenticeship with their father, Alexander Edward Stephen had been assigned to the engineering department while Frederic John Stephen had gone to the shipbuilding side of the business. Born on 6 August 1863 at 15 Park Circus, Glasgow, Frederic John Stephen studied naval architecture; he was awarded an MA from Glasgow University. In 1891 he married Agnes Renton, daughter of James Young, a muslin manufacturer. The couple had three sons and two daughters. Stephen later married Mabel Frew Young, who survived him. Like his father, he was a keen yachtsman, reputed to be the best helmsman on the Clyde, and in 1924 he successfully defended the Sewanhaka cup. 
When their father withdrew from the concern Alexander Edward Stephen took control of engineering while Frederic John Stephen ran the shipyard and the general administration of the business; both had the backing of professional section managers. The management style was familial, with group discussion and decision-taking in the board room, and paternalistic in relation to the men. Like their father the two brothers opposed organized labour and stood apart from the collective bargaining of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation. They operated the business as before, as a private partnership until 1900, when they converted to limited liability status, registering in Edinburgh with a capital of $350,000, of which there were 200,000 ordinary $1 shares, and 150,000 $1 preference shares. Frederic John and Alexander Edward Stephen each held 41,400 ordinary shares, their uncle John 20,000, and other family members 25,000 shares -- keeping the firm firmly within the family control. The formation of the new limited company was also the occasion of a shift of emphasis in construction away from general cargo and cargo-passenger ships into a higher class of cargo liner and passenger liner construction. The balance of control in the company also shifted, for Alexander Edward Stephen suffered declining health and this pushed Frederic John Stephen into the dominant management position in the business, retaining that leadership until his death. He managed a significant expansion of the firm during the First World War, especially in the engineering, boiler, and ship-repairing facilities. He also extended the company welfare schemes, establishing a boys' club and opening a large works canteen in 1919. In 1920 he purchased and laid out 10 acres of recreation ground for his workers, forming Coila Park. 
At the end of the war the Stephens, like other shipbuilders, hoped for continued buoyancy in the market and took steps to try to secure long-term orders. In 1919 the board agreed to sell 102,000 ordinary shares to Lord Inchcape, giving him 51 per cent control in the business. This was done in the expectation that the long association with Inchcape, now formalized, would secure long-term orders for the yard, and the move linked the yard to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Ships Company and to the British India Steam Navigation Company and its subsidiaries. Between 1920 and 1932 these links delivered ten orders to Linthouse, 24 per cent of tonnage constructed in this period; thereafter in the depression of the 1930s the connection offered no protection, nor did it benefit the family in any great way; the shares were eventually repurchased in 1933, restoring complete family control of the business. Frederic John Stephen had also linked his family to a consortium of shipbuilders to acquire control of the Steel Company of Scotland in 1920, with the objective of securing steel supplies for the company. The Stephens eventually held one-quarter of the shares but these were sold to the Colville group in 1935 for $40,155, a loss of over $353,000 to the family. 
Frederic John Stephen's stewardship of the family business spanned the hectic expansion into the war, and the prolonged contraction of the 1920s and the early 1930s. By the time of his death in 1932, Linthouse, and shipbuilding in general, was at its lowest ebb. The family strategy was to let dividends take the strain and no dividend was paid on ordinary shares between 1928 and 1937, nor on preference shares between 1933 and 1936. Frederic John Stephen died at Invergare, Rhu, Dunbartonshire, on 16 December 1932. Control of the firm passed to his sons, (Alexander) Murray and John Graeme Stephen, at a very difficult time. He was succeeded as chairman by

Richard [iii] Tattersall (1785-1859), took command on his father's death and under his direction within a decade the firm became a leader in the world of bloodstock auctioneering, with sales to the continent increasing and the development of annual yearling sales for some of the major studs. Old Dick, as he was known to distinguish himself from his son Richard [iv], was responsible for the expansion of the firm's activities to include sales at Doncaster and Hampton Court. Although he disapproved of heavy gambling -- a deeply religious man, he never bet himself -- in 1815 he opened new subscription rooms at The Corner where gambling debts could be settled. He was married to Mary Grace Robson, though the date of marriage is unknown. Following complaints of drowsiness and constant headaches, Old Dick died when on holiday at Dover on 22 July 1859. 
The business was taken over by Old Dick's elder son, Richard [iv] Tattersall (1812-1870), known as Richard the younger, who had been a partner since 1840. Under his stewardship the firm moved to Albert Gate at Knightsbridge following the expiration of the Hyde Park Corner lease in 1865. At the end of the 1860s he was instrumental in bringing in the first non-family partner, Thomas Pain, who developed a market for hunters and hounds in the midland shires.

Edmund Somerville Tattersall (1863-1942), eldest son of Edmund [iv], then became the last Tattersall to direct the firm, in a year when Tattersalls was responsible for 72 per cent of all blood stock sold at auction in England. Born on 12 August 1863, Sommy, as he was known, was educated at Eton College and later at an academy at Vevey on Lake Geneva. Fluent in French and German, as a young man he pursued skiing and mountaineering, but his passion was music, so much so that in 1904 he took a flat at 34 Rutland Gate so as to be nearer the Albert Hall. He became a partner in Tattersalls in 1885 and was later assisted by his younger brothers, Harry George (partner 1891) and Rupert Reeve (partner 1901). The former, fond of drink and careless with money, resigned from the firm in 1905 after a quarrel with Edmund Somerville, a man with a strict sense of decorum; Rupert lost a leg in the First World War and retired from the firm in 1919. A third brother, Richard Brooke, was not taken into partnership but sent to America to establish a branch of the business there, but he proved ineffective and died in comparative poverty in New Orleans. By the outbreak of the Second World War much of the auctioneering and direction of the firm had passed to non-family members and when the unmarried Edmund Somerville died on 26 October 1942, after a series of small strokes, dynastic control of the great auction house ended. During the second half of the century and into the twenty-first, Tattersalls has remained one of Britain's, and Europe's, leading firms of bloodstock auctioneers. The name Tattersalls also continues to be used at most British racecourses for the enclosure next to the members' enclosure. It is also widely applied to a check material used primarily as shirting in men's and women's 'country' clothes.

Marco Ricci (1676-1730) was born on 5 June 1676 at Belluno, in the republic of Venice, the son of Gerolamo Ricci, a landscape painter, and Gerolama Trevissoi. He probably trained with his uncle, Sebastiano Ricci ['see below'], and is said to have fled to Dalmatia, where he was apprenticed to a landscape painter, after having killed a gondolier in a brawl. With Pellegrini he was invited to England in 1708 by the British ambassador at Venice, Charles Montagu, then earl and later first duke of Manchester.

Sebastiano Ricci (bap. 1659, d. 1734) was baptized on 1 August 1659 at Belluno, in the republic of Venice, the son of Livio Ricci and his wife, Andreana. In Venice he was apprenticed to Federico Cervelli ('b'. 'c'.1625, died before 1700). Following a number of romantic entanglements, including a possible marriage to Anna Maria Venanza, on 12 September 1696 he married Maddalena Vandermer ('c'.1663-1742). Ricci's early career involved long sojourns in Bologna (where he learned the guitar), Parma, Rome, and Milan. Except for a trip to Vienna in 1701-2, he was mainly based in Venice from 1696 until 1706 when he joined Marco Ricci at the Florentine court. Sebastiano Ricci's travels enabled him to study the best of Italian art, from the proto-baroque of Correggio in Parma to the energetic and witty classicism of Annibale Carracci at the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. In Venice in 1708 he painted a lyrical homage to Veronese in a celebrated altarpiece for San Giorgio Maggiore. Perhaps he went to London, as Vertue recounts, to mortify Pellegrini; perhaps he was invited by Queen Anne, as Pascoli states; more likely he was grasping the opportunity to compete for the prestigious commission of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, for a rumour to that effect had reached John Talman in Rome by November 1711. Pellegrini had already entered the public competition of 1709, and he and Sir James Thornhill were invited in February 1710 to paint 'little cupolas' or models: it is unlikely that 'The Trinity and Saints' (V&A; repr. Knox, pl. 42) of 1710 relates to this, as it had already been decided that the subjects were to come from the 'Acts of the Apostles'. The commission was not resolved until June 1715, and Ricci's involvement is undocumented. Instead he found a lavish patron in Lord Burlington, who in 1712-13 commissioned monumental canvases of mythological subjects for the staircase of Burlington House, London, and a variety of others on biblical or classical themes, some of which were installed in his villa at Chiswick in the late 1720s. Handel also enjoyed Burlington's patronage in this period, and would have known Pellegrini and the Riccis -- some of their paintings were in his collection. Other whig figures who commissioned work from Sebastiano Ricci include Richard Arundell, a friend of Fountaine, and the duke of Portland, who paid $1000 for decorative work at Portland House completed by the summer of 1713 (largely destroyed through rebuilding, 1748). This included a ceiling with 'The Choice of Hercules' as a centrepiece, recalling the earl of Shaftesbury's espousal of the subject in 1712 as an illumination of his moral philosophy (dem. 1938). In the autumn Sebastiano and Marco Ricci decorated the duke's chapel at Bulstrode House (des. by rebuilding, 1862). Sebastiano Ricci is not documented at Kneller's Academy, where Pellegrini was one of the directors (and was active in life-drawing classes); however, he presented an allegory on the treaty of Utrecht to the Painter-Stainers' Company, perhaps at the time when Handel's 'Utrecht 'Te Deum'' was performed. While little is known of Marco's independent work, his landscapes were clearly popular and the many versions that exist of his 'Opera Rehearsal', including one at Castle Howard (1709-10; repr. Scarpa Sonino, 'Ricci', fig. 59), a playful group portrait, attest to the popularity of this early exercise in sardonic social observation. 
Portland, Burlington, and probably other patrons who employed both painters, could compare Pellegrini's sketchy, festive style with Sebastiano Ricci's powerful, dynamic manner. A more versatile, inventive artist, Ricci adapted his style to suit the developing classicizing taste of English patrons, looking to the Roman and Bolognese artists whom they admired as well as to the qualities of Veronese. Charles Talbot, first duke of Shrewsbury, an admirer of the Roman baroque, was keen to have Ricci decorate the prince of Wales's bedchamber; however, Lord Halifax insisted that the commission go to Thornhill, for the sake of his career and for the encouragement of English artists. Possibly Shrewsbury obtained for Ricci instead the commission to paint the 'Resurrection' mural at Chelsea Hospital in 1714-15. In late summer 1715 Sebastiano Ricci left England, since he is documented in Milan in September; Marco Ricci presumably left with him. In Venice the pair continued to collaborate and to work for British patrons, painting two of the allegorical tombs of whig worthies commissioned by Owen McSwiney in the early 1720s, and numerous works for Joseph (later Consul) Smith. Both were closely associated with Venetian theatre and opera. Sebastiano Ricci bought a handsome apartment in the calle del Salvadego with his English wealth where Marco resided until his death on 21 January 1730. He was unmarried. He was buried on 22 January in the Venetian church of San Moise. In London Marco had painted atmospheric landscapes in gouache on kidskin, a technique taken up by Joseph Goupy, and he probably made caricatures there too; he explored these new genres with great originality in his remaining years in Venice, while also experimenting with etching from 1723. Sebastiano enjoyed a high international reputation in his late career as a painter who had rediscovered the values of Veronese. He died in Venice on 15 May 1734. Pellegrini's later career was a peripatetic one. After two profitable years at the court of Dusseldorf, followed by a sojourn in the Netherlands, he was again invited to England in 1719 by the British ambassador at The Hague, William Cadogan, to decorate his country house (des. by fire before 1770). During these months, from May to late October, Pellegrini may also have worked on the staircase decoration at Cowdray House, Sussex, for Lord Montacute (des. 1793 by fire) and perhaps for Sir Andrew Fountaine at Narford. For the remaining twenty-two years of his life Pellegrini worked all over Europe, especially for the courts of Dresden, Wurzburg, Vienna, and Mannheim, while also painting the enormous ceiling of the 'Salle Mississippi' at the Banque Royale in Paris for John Law in 1720 (des. 1722 during renovations). He died on 2 November 1741 in Venice and was buried there in the church of San Vidal on 3 November. 
The commercial success of Pellegrini and the Riccis in England may have induced other painters to try their luck there. Niccolo Cassana (1659-1713), active in Venice from 1698 as the agent of Grand Duke Ferdinand and a friend of Sebastiano Ricci, went to London 'c'.1710 -- invited, according to C. F. Ratti, to paint portraits for Queen Anne. Vertue records that he and Sebastiano engaged in picture dealing, supplying the nobility with often dubious old masters. Vincenzo Damini ('b'. 'c'.1690x92, died after 1749), a follower of Pellegrini, is said to have come from Dusseldorf to London, and Vertue notes that he arrived about 1713, but he may not have arrived until 1719-20. He left for Italy in 1730, accompanied by his pupil, the unconventional and talented Giles Hussey. Vertue associated Damini with Francesco Riario, a Bolognese history painter, one of whose few documented works is a portrait of John Devoto ('fl'. 1708-1752), a painter of Genoese parentage who worked as a stage designer from 1718 at Drury Lane, London, and elsewhere.

Antonio Bellucci (1654-1726). He was born on 19 February 1654 in Venice and baptized there in the church of Santa Maria Formosa on 26 February, the son of Giovan Battista Bellucci and Caterina Volpato. He studied drawing in Dalmatia (Sebenico) with a nobleman, Domenico Difnico, and some time before 1680 married Maria, with whom he had three children baptized in June 1680, 1683, and 1684 in Venice. Bellucci had gained fame in his native Venice in the 1680s, developing a neo-Veronesian manner which was also indebted to Bolognese and Roman baroque art. Although he worked periodically on religious and secular commissions in Venice, he was essentially a successful court painter, celebrating the glory of the ruling Liechtenstein family at Vienna (1692-1703) and the Wittelsbach at Dusseldorf (1706-16) with allegorical cycles enshrining their virtues. In 1716 at the death of his patron, the elector Johann Wilhelm, Bellucci left Dusseldorf for London, no doubt encouraged by Pellegrini. His reputation went before him, and he decorated an unspecified house in Pall Mall on his arrival. Little is known of his patrons, and by comparison with the versatile Ricci, he may have seemed old-fashioned. His major patron was the first duke of Chandos, who brought together the leading history painters of the day at Canons, together with the stuccoists Giovanni Bagutti and Giuseppe Artari, who had also worked in Germany. Handel was still director of music at Canons in 1719, and Bellucci could well have known him from Dusseldorf. Among other decorations (des. 'c'.1747-8), he painted the enormous library ceiling with a complex allegory recalling the rhetoric he had employed for the elector palatine. His canvases from the ceiling of the chapel, completed by August 1720, survive at Great Witley church, Worcestershire, while the four paintings commissioned by the duke for St Lawrence's Church, Little Stanmore, Whitchurch, Middlesex, survive 'in situ'. At Chandos House in St James's Square, London, Bellucci decorated the duke's visiting room and picture room (des. by rebuilding, 1735). He may have felt at home in England to some extent, especially when Pellegrini returned, or when the antiquarian and connoisseur Anton Maria Zanetti, a close friend of the Riccis and Pellegrini, visited in summer 1721; moreover he would have known Giacomo Leoni from the Dusseldorf court. However, Bellucci suffered from gout, and left in July 1722, working in the Veneto until his death at the family home in Pieve di Soligo on 29 August 1726. His son Giovanni Battista Bellucci (1684-1760) remained, making his career as a portraitist in England and Ireland; his portrait of the librettist Paolo Rolli (priv. coll.; exh. NPG, 1985, no. 90) evokes the family's associations with London musical life. 
It has been convincingly argued that the first generation of whig nobility admired the mercantile, oligarchic republic of Venice and associated its civic virtues with the architectural style of Palladio, hence the position of Palladianism as the English national style by the 1720s. The employment of artists who worked in the manner of Veronese by prominent whigs has been seen as a deliberate reinforcement of this analogy with the cultural as well as political virtues of Venice. It can be objected that Pellegrini's major decorative projects were associated with Vanbrugh, and that he and the Riccis had more in common with the cosmopolitan world of Italian music and of late baroque decoration than with the essentially protestant and rational ethos of English Palladianism. However, as distinct from large-scale history painting in oil on plaster, Pellegrini and Sebastiano Ricci could also provide canvases to be inset in decorative surrounds in Palladian interiors. Sebastiano Ricci's work was undoubtedly favoured by Burlington; moreover, he designed the frontispiece to Leoni's 'The Architecture of A. Palladio' (1715), to which he and Marco Ricci were subscribers. Sebastiano was the most successful of this group of Venetians in England: Vertue reported the death in 1734 of this 'excellent and famous painter', noting that his works in England would remain 'a Monument of Fame -- to him and to the Honour of this Nation' (Vertue, 'Note books', 3.65). But in general by the 1720s the established taste for Italian opera and for Veronese-inspired history painting tended to raise nationalistic hackles, leading to a movement in favour of a more robust, naturalistic 'English' style in music, theatre, and art. The Venetian painter whom this affected most strongly was Jacopo Amigoni.

Ursula Jellicoe (1907-1986)], who had joined the office as secretary, drawn by her interest in the arts. They enjoyed a happy and fruitful fifty-year marriage and professional co-operation, in which Susan gradually built up a distinct oeuvre of her own. She had secretarial qualifications, was fluent in Russian, French, German, and Italian, and had been working as personal secretary to the managing director of the Anglo-Continental Bank. She must have seemed surprisingly high-powered to have wanted to become secretary to so small a practice, even one run by someone so lively. Susan was born on 30 June 1907 at 18 Gambier Terrace, Liverpool, one of the six children of Professor Sir Bernard Pares (1867-1949), historian and co-founder of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at London University, and his wife, Margaret Ellis (Daisy), 'nee' Dixon (1879-1964). Her early childhood was in Liverpool, then on the Wirral. From 1920 to 1925 she attended St Paul's Girls' School while living with her mother and grandparents in Belsize Park (her parents having separated in 1919). She was a graceful, artistic child, a beautiful classical dancer, and loved singing and music throughout her life. During the Second World War she worked in the Ministry of Information and distinguished herself by revealing analysis of aerial photography. From their marriage until 1984 the Jellicoes lived in a narrow Georgian house with a long garden at 19 Grove Terrace, Parliament Hill Fields. There were no children of the marriage.

Edward [i] Harford (1658-1705) continued in his father's trade of soap-making and married Elizabeth Jones (1670-1729) in 1689; they had ten children. He expanded into the tobacco trade, and became part-owner of a ship. His three grandsons in the separate Blaise Castle, Stapleton, and Stoke Bishop lines became especially prominent. 
The Stoke Bishop line was the branch most intimately involved with brass-making. It began with Mark [i] Harford (1700-1788), eighth child of Edward [i] Harford and Elizabeth Jones. Mark [i] Harford was a haberdasher of small wares who became connected with the brass trade through his marriage to Love Andrews, granddaughter of one of the founders of the Bristol Brass Company. The company was begun as the Bristol Brass Wire Company in 1702 by Quaker merchants including John Andrews, Nehemiah Champion, Thomas Coster, Abraham Darby, and Edward Lloyd, and it dominated the British brass trade for nearly a century. Mark [i] Harford's only child,

Mark [ii] Harford (1738-1798) of Stoke Bishop, increased the family's stake in the company by marrying Sarah (died 1798), daughter of Samuel Lloyd, in 1762, and became its leader. In the following years it became one of the most important industrial enterprises in the world, owning copper mines, smelters, and brassworks, in Cornwall, Bristol and its environs, Esher in Surrey, Lower Redbrook in the Wye valley, and Swansea. Mark [ii] Harford headed a committee of nine, on which sat five Harfords, including his first cousins Edward [iii] and Joseph, of the Blaise Castle and Stapleton branches. He reorganized the company in 1788 as the Harford and Bristol Brass and Copper Company with additional capital of $100,000 and ten members, of whom six were Harfords. 
Mark [ii] Harford retired in 1796, and leadership of the company passed for six years to his cousin Joseph Harford of Stapleton before returning to his second son, Mark [iii] Harford ('b'. 1768). In 1799 it could still be described by its chief rival, Thomas Williams, as 'perhaps the most considerable brass house in all Europe' (Day, 112). However, it was already declining and was managed largely as a static investment. The company continued to use slow methods to make traditional goods such as brass ingots and wire, copper sheets, and battery-ware pans and kettles. By contrast the Birmingham industry was developing new techniques and products such as gas fittings and machine components. The industrial empire began to fall apart, and even its central sites were allowed to decay. Woodborough battery mill was derelict by the 1790s, Weston battery mill was sold about 1811, and Baptist Mills was abandoned around 1814. All smelting had ceased by 1820. From 1833 the company was simply a property owner, with its remaining premises leased for $500 per annum; it was sold by the Harford family in 1862. 
The Stapleton line originated with Charles Harford (1704-1746), grocer, youngest child of Edward [i] Harford and Elizabeth Jones. Charles married Mary (died 1742), the daughter of Joseph Beck of Frenchay and niece of one of the partners in the Old Bank. Their sons were Trewman Harford ('fl'. 1727-1761), merchant, and

Joseph Harford (1741-1802), born at Frenchay, Bristol. Joseph Harford's commercial interests were based upon his father's wholesale grocery business in Queen's Square, but he extended into important new areas. He was a founding partner of the New Bank in 1786 and a partner in the bank of Ames, Cave & Co. from 1786 to 1798. He was a member of Merchant's Hall, and master of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1796. His industrial interests centred on the Bristol Brass Company, of which he was a committee member, and leader from 1796 to 1802, but he also had interests in the iron, tin, and glass trades, and financed Richard Champion's Bristol China Works in 1768. 
Joseph Harford aggrandized the family by marrying in 1763 Hannah (died 1811), daughter of Joseph Kill of Stapleton Grove, near Bristol, where they took up residence. He became a justice of the peace, treasurer of Bristol Infirmary, promoter of the Bristol Library Society, and chairman of the Bristol slavery abolition committee. He was prominent in Bristol politics during the radical campaign of 1769 and was in 1771 one of Edmund Burke's two sponsors to become a member of parliament, opening his campaign with a subscription of $300. Burke said, 'You could not have a better man than Mr Harford. He has a great bottom for confidence. He has a firm Integrity; very enlarged notions; and one of the most solid and well cultivated understandings I have met with' (Underdown, 137). Harford himself was elected to Bristol common council in 1779 and acted as high sheriff on three occasions. The Society of Friends disavowed him for taking his oath, resulting in his conversion to the Church of England. Joseph Harford died at Stapleton Grove on 11 October 1802. 
The Blaise Castle descendants of Edward [i] Harford and Elizabeth Jones sprang from their son Edward [ii] Harford (1691-1779), merchant, who married Elizabeth Lloyd, daughter of Edward Lloyd of the Brass Company. Edward [ii] expanded his father's mercantile and industrial interests, beginning to import tobacco from Virginia in 1724 and owning a ship, taking a partnership in a glassworks in 1724, and holding membership of the Brass Company.

Sir Charles Mills, first baronet (1792-1872), third son of William Mills (1750-1820), and his wife, Elizabeth Digby. After his retirement from the East India Company in the 1780s, William Mills bought the estate of Bisterne, near Southampton, and was MP for Coventry from 1805 to 1812. Born at Popes, Hatfield, on 23 January 1792, Charles Mills was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, and became partner in 1821. In 1825 he married Emily, a daughter of Richard Cox, one of the partners in Cox's Bank. He was created a baronet in 1868. Charles Mills was a senior partner at the time of his death on 4 October 1872 at Hillingdon Court, near Uxbridge, Middlesex. He ensured his family's entitlement to four-tenths of the bank's profits after the amalgamation in 1864 with Currie & Co., under the name of Glyn, Mills, Currie & Co., John Wheler Mills (1801-1865), Charles's younger brother, had become a partner in 1835, retiring in 1864 owing to ill health. The bank continued to expand during Charles Mills's years as partner. However, as in the previous generation, the bank's leading figure was a Glyn: George Carr Glyn, first Baron Wolverton (1797-1873), was the driving force behind the bank's involvement in railway finance and in overseas issues.

Charles William Mills, second Baron Hillingdon (1855-1919). Educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford, he became a partner in Glyn's in 1879 and was conservative MP for the Sevenoaks division of Kent from 1885 to 1892. His directorates also included the Imperial Ottoman Bank, the Union Bank of Australia, and the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, as well as the Anglo-Austrian Bank, another overseas bank originally linked to the Glyn's. In 1886 Charles William Mills followed the trend of aristocratic marriages by London private bankers by marrying Alice Marion Harbord, daughter of the fifth Baron Suffield who had himself married Cecilia Baring, sister of Edward Charles Baring, first Baron Revelstoke (1828-1897). Charles William Mills and his wife had three sons. He left about $1 million on his death on 6 April 1919, at 6 Park Place, Mayfair, London. Lord Hillingdon retired from active business life in 1907, owing to ill health, leaving the conduct of the bank to other partners, including his younger brother Algernon Henry Mills (1856-1922), one of the members of the Mills family most directly engaged in daily banking activities, in particular during the war years. The dominant force in the bank during the inter-war years was a Mills by marriage, General Sir Herbert Alexander Lawrence (1861-1943), who in 1892 married Isabel Mary, eldest surviving daughter of the first Lord Hillingdon. He joined the bank in 1919, bringing to it much needed enterprise and energy, presiding in particular over the merger in 1922 with Holt & Co., bankers and army agents, and with the West End bank Child & Co. the following year. Lawrence was also chairman of Vickers, Glyn's long-standing customer and one of Britain's largest companies. 
The bank's capital was sold to the Royal Bank of Scotland in the summer of 1939. The partners were mostly young men and with the approach of war it was feared that if some of them were to be killed, the payment of death duties on their family holdings would cause formidable difficulties. Although the days of the private banks had long gone, this state of affairs was partly due to the premature death of a promising member of the sixth generation. Charles Thomas Mills (1887-1915), the elder son of Charles William Mills, second Lord Hillingdon, had become a partner in the bank, as well as conservative MP for the Uxbridge division of Middlesex, in 1910. He was killed on the western front in October 1915.

John Festing (1699/1700-1774/5), music teacher, the elder brother, made his debut in March 1721 and was shortly afterwards playing in the opera orchestra as an oboist. He seems to have been rather less active than Michael as a public performer. As a flute teacher, however, he was apparently much in demand, and 'had more scholars than any master in London' (Hawkins, 2.892). And with such as John Spencer (father of the first Earl Spencer) among them, John Festing is said to have been worth $8000 when in late 1774 or early 1775 (not 1772 as Hawkins has it) he died after 'a lingering illness'. In his will he is described as a 'Gentleman of Wokingham Berks.'. From the fact that his estate passed directly to his grandchildren it may be assumed that his wife (Letitia) and all three children had predeceased him.

About 1637 he set up a bookselling partnership with his brother Edmond, Thomas Allot, and Richard Sergier in Dublin; he was also operating a bookshop in St Paul's Churchyard from 1638 onwards. He appears to have been in Dublin between 1642 and 1647 but, once back in London, he continued to issue Irish books throughout the 1650s. In 1652 he married Mary Tooke ('fl'. 1652-1685), the sister of the bookseller Benjamin Tooke. In July 1660 he petitioned for and was granted the office of printer-general in Ireland; however, he does not seem to have returned permanently to Dublin. He died intestate in Duck Lane, London, on 20 March 1669; the administration of his English estate was granted to Mary a month later, while in Dublin administration was granted to his primary creditor. Although John was formally succeeded as king's printer by his brother-in-law Benjamin Tooke, Mary took over the business until 1684, in partnership with her sons John ('c'.1657-1683), who shared the patent with Tooke from 1679 to 1683, and Andrew ('c'.1659-1732).

Bagutti was in England by about 1709 when he carried out the first stucco-work recorded since Tudor times at Castle Howard, Yorkshire. Artari joined Bagutti to work on several decorative schemes being undertaken by the architect James Gibbs. Before 1720 they were working on the chapel ceiling at Cannons, Middlesex, the great house of James Brydges, first duke of Chandos; in 1720 at the octagon of Orleans House, Twickenham; from 1722 to 1726 at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London; in 1723-4 at the church of St Peter, Vere Street, London; and in 1725 with other stuccoists (but not Bagutti) Artari was at Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire. All the work, with the exception of that at Cannons, survives. At Ditchley, Artari signed a receipt on 7 December 1725 for $201 12's'. 0died on behalf of work done by 'me & my partners' (Dillon MS, I/3/p/h). These 'partners' at Ditchley included the stuccoists Francesco Vassalli ('fl'. 1724-1763) and Francesco Leone Serena ('fl'. 1700-1729).

George Hilton (fl. 1682-1686), informer, secured the king's verbal commission to put the laws against protestant dissenters into execution. For the next four years the Hilton gang terrorized London dissent, monopolizing prosecutions for nonconformity, and securing the closure of meeting-houses of every denomination. Around forty gang members are identifiable, fifteen of them women, who secured warrants and arrests, and served as witnesses, bailiffs, and bouncers. Several members were especially prominent in these activities: Gabriel Shadd, Christopher Smith, John and Hester Collingwood, and Eleanor Shafto. Collingwood and Shafto were illiterate; Shafto was Hilton's mistress. They operated chiefly under the 'Conventicle Act' of 1670, which allowed informers one third of the fine levied upon attenders at illegal worship. The gang raised tens of thousands of pounds in fines. On Sundays they tracked down conventicles (the women sometimes feigning religious conversion); on weekdays they distrained victims' goods for non-payment of fines. No denomination was spared, and the principal leaders of dissent were their victims, including William Penn, Richard Baxter, George Fox, and Stephen Lobb. Once, in 1684, Hilton played for the highest stakes, when his female spies were crown witnesses in a treason charge against Thomas Rosewall for words spoken in a sermon. Rosewall was convicted, but the king was persuaded that it would be impolitic to execute a man on the evidence of Hilton's gang.

Reynolds, John (d. 1607), enclosure protester, was a leader in the midland revolt of 1607. Since no record appears to have survived of either his examination or trial and the only references to his involvement in the rising omit his place of origin, it is impossible to say anything of his earlier life. A chronicler's later report includes the marginal note that he was either a pedlar or a tinker. If true, then Reynolds was one of those masterless men whose mobility, and the anonymity this brought, alarmed early modern governments. 
The background to the midland revolt, and to Reynolds's involvement in it, is to be found in the economic pressures created by the long population growth of the sixteenth century and, as a response to these and the temporary relaxation of restrictive laws, the intensification of enclosure. The latter development was particularly marked in the open-field communities of the heavy claylands of the midland counties which formed the heartland of the rising. Protests began in Northamptonshire on May eve 1607, but quickly spread to the adjoining counties of Leicestershire and Warwickshire and crowds numbered in their thousands tore down enclosures. Reynolds's direct leadership and the wider rumours that circulated of his role as Captain Pouch contributed to the scale of operation and to the co-ordination and mobility across county boundaries that distinguished the 1607 episode from other protests against enclosure in the period. 
Since there is no direct evidence for Reynolds's role it can only be recovered from the correspondence of the authorities charged with suppressing the protests and from a later well-informed account of the rising added by John Howes to his 1615 edition of John Stow's 'Chronicles'. As Howes's account makes clear, Reynolds was a charismatic figure. Adopting the pseudonym of captain, an inversion of military authority, was not uncommon among leaders of protest in this period. According to Howes, Reynolds gained the title of Pouch because of a great leather pouch he wore which, he claimed, contained 'sufficient matter to defend them against all comers' (Stow, 889). His ability to command support was also based, as with other leaders of popular protest in the Europe of his time, on claims to authority from both the king and God. According to Howes, Pouch claimed 'that in this present worke, hee was directed by the Lord of Heaven'. A claim to divine inspiration could challenge the culture of obedience that characterized early modern monarchical states and Reynolds's statement, 'that he was sent of God to satisff[i]e all degrees whatsoever' might indeed be taken to represent such a challenge (Stow, 889). However, Reynolds combined this with a claim to have been given authority from the king to throw down enclosures. Although there was no truth to this, it reflected Reynolds's acute understanding of the need to assert legitimacy for the protest if he was to gain support in a political culture in which popular protest was formally proscribed. His claim to royal authority echoed the protestations of loyalty to the king made in the protesters' petitions in 1607 and commonly in other smaller- scale protests against enclosure in the period. Despite the fact that Reynolds's supporters called themselves Levellers and Diggers, titles which later took on more a more radical meaning in the English revolution, their surviving statements make clear that they saw their activities of levelling and digging up enclosures as being for the good of the commonwealth. 
Apart from actively leading the main body of protesters, Reynolds may also have had a hand in the appeal, issued under the name of the Diggers of Warwickshire, which combined professions of loyalty to the king with a biting attack on those enclosers whose greed was thought to have brought poverty and threatened famine. It is also likely that Reynolds was involved in the direct negotiations that took place with the authorities in Warwickshire in which the protesters, again professing their loyalty, promised to disband on news of the king's being informed of their grievances and agreeing to their reformation. Despite the potential for radicalism in Reynolds's leadership, his reported orders to his followers 'not to sweare, nor to offer violence to any person, but to ply their busine[s] and to make fa[i]re works' (Stow, 889) reflected a concern to keep protest within the bounds of order and was intended to contrast the orderly nature of protest with the greater threat to the commonwealth from the disorderly activities of the enclosers. Accounts by Howes and others acknowledged that, while the protesters wreaked violence upon hedges and ditches, they refrained from theft or personal violence. Despite this the central government became alarmed by the persistence of the protests and, angered by what it saw as the failure of the provincial authorities to stop the protests, issued instructions for the suppression of the rising, by force if necessary. 
In the first week of June, Reynolds was captured after a clash at Withybrook in Warwickshire, another site of enclosure, and was sent 'as the chiefest leader' ('Hastings MSS', 4.193) to London. By 9 June he was in custody and had been examined by the privy council. Although no further record survives of him, Howes records that he was found guilty of treason and that his execution was 'made exemplary'. Despite this, rumours of Pouch's activities continued to circulate, with at least one man setting himself up as his lieutenant and claiming from him authority to throw down all enclosures between Northampton and York. Having examined him, James I's privy council described Reynolds as a 'base ringleader and turbulent varlet' (ibid., 4.194) and Howes in a deliberate slight reported that his pouch was found to contain only a piece of mouldy cheese. But the reports of Reynolds's actions suggest that his leadership reflected a level of political knowledge and ability also to be found in other plebeian leaders of protest in this period. Late in the twentieth century the story of 'Captain Pouch and a few ill-armed peasants', written reputedly 'on memory's page', surfaced again briefly as a dramatic motif in one of the novels by the midlands author J. L. Carr ('Battle of Pollocks Crossing', 1985, 104, 107-8, 129-30).

Carter, Ann (d. 1629), protester, of Maldon in Essex, was twice leader of protests over food in 1629, actions which brought her brief public notice and execution in the same year. Details of her parentage and birth, or whether she married more than once, are unknown. 
Ann Barrington married John Carter, a Maldon butcher, on 6 December 1620. What little is known of her personal life after marriage suggests that the couple struggled to maintain a living. Rather more is on record about her public relationship with the authorities. By 1629 she had had a number of clashes with the town's rulers which reflected a willingness by her to defy authority. Questioned in 1623 as to why she was not at church, she told one of the town's rulers, 'yf he woold provide one to do hir worke shee would goe', adding that 'she searved god as well as he' (Essex RO, D/B3/3/1/19, fol. 154). A year later she prevented the arrest of her husband, cudgelling the town's serjeant-at-arms in the process. 
In March 1629 Ann Carter was part of a large crowd of women who protested over the export of grain. Defying attempts by Maldon's authorities to stop them, the women marched to where foreign ships were loading and made the sailors pour grain into their bonnets and aprons. The women's actions reflected a belief that to allow grain to be exported when local populations faced dearth and possibly famine was both against the moral economy and government policy. As one of the women replied when asked who had prompted her to riot: 'the crie of the country and her own want' (Essex RO, D/B3/3/208). Maldon's authorities suspected Ann Carter of being the women's leader. Her previous history as well as her behaviour at examination (where the surviving document with its many crossings-out suggests a confidence to challenge any description of her action as either violent or illegal), certainly qualified her for the role. That she had found herself in the same month presented to the court for a minor infringement of market regulations while the town's authorities failed to stop the larger activities of foreign merchants probably increased her sense of outrage. 
To this point, the episode reflected the protocols of early modern protest -- crowd restraint was matched by reform by authority -- and Ann Carter's actions were no different from those of other women who often predominated in crowd actions over food, exploiting the licence given them by their marginal political and legal positions and responsibility for feeding their families. But two months later Ann led a second crowd of several hundred unemployed clothworkers. This time there was no doubt about her role. She had ridden through the region, and had a local baker write letters, to summon support. Giving herself the title of Captain, she was reported to have said, 'Come my brave lads of Maulden, I will be your Leader, for we will not starve' (BL, Harleian MS 7000, fol. 259). Two protests in as many months challenged the convention whereby crowds expressed contrition in exchange for conciliation by the authorities. The changed context of intensifying depression in the cloth industry and the changed nature of the crowd's behaviour -- the protesters broke into a grain store and took away a large quantity of grain -- alarmed the central government which moved swiftly to punish the attack. Only a week after the riot a special judicial commission sat to execute justice. Ann Carter was found guilty and hanged the next day, 30 May 1629. This exceptional punishment -- she was the only woman hanged in the period for a food riot -- owed less to the nature of her crime than to the political instability of Charles I's government. Her husband survived her, but his frequent appearances before the town's courts confirm the family's slide into poverty and, perhaps, suggest anger at the authorities' treatment of his wife.

Powell, Edward (bap. 1608, d. in or after 1642), protester, was baptized on 8 May 1608 in the parish of Holy Trinity, Ely, Cambridgeshire, the illegitimate son of Mary Powell (died 1645?), who later, in 1613, married John Anderson. As Anderson of the Fens he was prominent in protest against the drainage and enclosure of the fens around the Isle of Ely. 
Powell spent his life in Ely, where he married Margery Marshall on 19 May 1633 and raised a family. A labourer, he was described in 1637 as a poor man when he received relief from an Ely charity. Like others in the city he had cattle which he was able to common on the surrounding fens but, again like others, he was threatened by the implementation of a major drainage and enclosure scheme in the Great Level, of which the Cambridgeshire fens formed part, led by Francis Russell, first earl of Bedford. A legal ruling in spring 1638 that Bedford had failed to perfect the drainage scheme seems to have encouraged the commoners to renew their destruction of the works and provides the background to Powell's involvement. At the beginning of June 1638 a crowd of over 200, drawn from Ely and surrounding villages and taking the name Anderson's Camp, destroyed drainage ditches on Whelpmore Fen. They did so under the guise of a game of football, a violent form of sport that often supplied a pretext for organized protest, and following rumours that Anderson was to bring the football and a hundred men. 
Powell was arrested by the authorities at Ely in a pre-emptive move and was not present at the attack but his subsequent examination revealed why the event was popularly nicknamed Anderson's Camp. Earlier, in Lent that year, Powell had paid the town crier to summon the town's inhabitants to go to petition the king, then at Newmarket, that the losing of their fens would be the losing of their livelihoods. The next day in Ely market place Powell, cudgel in hand and at the head of a crowd of some sixty men similarly armed, defied the call of a local JP to disperse, claiming that the king had personally instructed him to report any who hindered his petition. Among his fellow commoners, it was reported, Powell claimed to have had 'ordinary access and speech' with the king and that Charles I, on learning of the fenland commoners' plight, had wept on his shoulder (TNA: PRO, SP 16/409/50). Powell had managed to forestall further legal action then by going to London and entering a recognizance for his good behaviour. Examined following his later arrest in June, he refused to give up his claim to common in the fens unless he could be shown the king's signet to the grant to the undertakers of the drainage work. The declaration of loyalty to the king he then made carried with it a hint of social levelling: 'I will obey God and the King, but no man els, for we are all but subjects' (TNA: PRO, SP 16/409/50). Powell certainly showed a defiant attitude in his dealings with the authorities at Ely; as he told the JPs, they were but the bishop's justices and not the king's, a reference to the bishop of Ely's right to appoint justices in the isle. Powell spent three weeks in gaol before being bailed, a local clergyman acting as surety for him, to appear in court at Ely in late July 1638. Perhaps because of the threat posed by popular actions to the drainage scheme over which the king had assumed control, Powell was tried on the direct advice of the attorney-general and the solicitor-general. He was fined the heavy sum of $200 and sentenced to imprisonment. 
Partly because of a fear that he might be the subject of a rescue attempt, Powell was transferred to the Newgate prison in London, from where he twice sent letters to his local minister asking him to read an appeal to his fellow inhabitants to raise a collection to secure his release or to provide him, his aged mother, wife, and children with a weekly pension. He was finally released in June 1639 and returned to Ely, where he last appears as putting his mark to a petition in 1642 from some of the inhabitants of Ely against the dean and chapter of the cathedral. Powell has been described by the historian of opposition to the drainage as 'evidently an educated, literate man who was reasonably articulate and had some familiarity with the law' (Lindley, 103). Although it is now known that Powell was unable to sign his name, his brief career demonstrated that he knew what it took to become a charismatic leader. As he asked of his interrogators at examination, 'may not a man be inspired? Then, why not I to do the poore good about their Commons?' (TNA: PRO, SP 16/409/50).

Williams, John (fl. 1631-1637), labourer and protester, of English Bicknor in Gloucestershire, came to fame under the alias of Skimmington as one of the leaders of the protests against royal enclosure in the Forest of Dean. Very little is known of his life apart from the records created as a result of his political activities in the 1630s. From a petition of 1637 seeking his release from imprisonment it is evident that he was married and had several children. Variously described in the legal records as either a labourer or a yeoman, it has been suggested that he might have been a miner. The background to his involvement in the protests was the attempt by the crown to improve its revenues from the Forest of Dean by licensing large-scale enclosure and leasing rights to cut timber and to mine coal and iron ore to courtiers and financiers. This had attracted the hostility of the commoners and free miners in an area whose extensive wastes and commons had seen the growth of a large and increasingly poor population. 
Williams appears to have been first involved in the protests on Lady day (25 March) 1631 when a crowd of up to 500, drawn from English Bicknor and other forest communities, marched to the sound of drum and fife and with banners flying and destroyed timber, coal mines, and enclosures within the forest. In a second action the foresters attacked enclosures and pits assigned to Lady Villiers, the widow of Sir Edward, half-brother to the duke of Buckingham, and the London monopolist Sir Giles Mompesson. Protests continuing in Dean as well as in the other royal forests in the south-west, the sheriff tried but failed in November 1631 to capture Williams, now given the sobriquet of Skimmington. Williams was involved in at least one further protest in January 1632 which led to the attorney-general's seeking his arrest. By April of that year Williams had been captured and imprisoned in Gloucester Castle. In the same month, his (unnamed) wife was also included on a warrant for the arrest of a further group of protesters from the Forest of Dean. By late April, Williams had been transferred to Newgate where he was held a prisoner, apparently without any further legal action being taken against him. 
John Williams's alias of Skimmington was first noted in a document of November 1631. A skimmington, a long, wooden ladle used in the dairying regions of the south-west, is thought to have given its name to a popular shaming ritual prevalent in the area, which took the form of a heavily ritualized and symbolically charged procession or riding and was most commonly directed against dominant wives whose behaviour towards their husbands challenged the gender order. That the term was also used by the protesters, who talked of burying skimmington to describe the April 1632 action in which the effigy of Mompesson was paraded to the sound of music before being thrown into the disputed pits, hints at why Williams, whose precise role in the protests remains unclear, was given the alias of Skimmington. At the heart of the skimmington in a society where patriarchy served as a model of political, as well as domestic, relations was an association with ideas of order and disorder and of rule and misrule. For protesters such as Williams, who saw the inversion of enclosure as a threat to the liberties of the foresters and a denial of the norms of good lordship and kingship, their actions were intended to symbolize this inversion and, by publicly shaming the enclosers, to right the moral world. Some such thinking may help to explain the popularity of the title of Skimmington in simultaneous protests against the disafforestation and enclosure of other royal forests in the south-west. In the Forest of Braydon three of the leaders took the title of Lady Skimmington and in Gillingham Forest there were attempts to recruit Lady Skimmington to the cause, while elsewhere in Gloucestershire there were claims that Skimmington's lieutenant was to lead an action against enclosures outside the forest. This, and the fact that there was at least one other John Williams caught up in the protests in Braydon in Wiltshire, has led some historians to assume, wrongly, that John Williams of English Bicknor was leader too in these other protests. In 1637, after five years of imprisonment, Williams successfully petitioned for his release and slipped away from historical notice.

Dare, Thomas (d. 1685), political activist and rebel, was the son of a civil war cavalier and a goldsmith by occupation. He sat on Taunton's common council following the grant of a new charter to the town in 1677 (the corporation had fallen into abeyance in 1662 following the old members' refusal to comply with the 'Corporation Act' of 1661), and was a member of the whig Green Ribbon Club, which met at the King's Head tavern in Chancery Lane, London. During the exclusion crisis, he was active in promoting a petition in the name of the inhabitants and freeholders of Somerset calling for the sitting of parliament and the prosecution of Catholic recusants, which he presented to Charles II on the stairs of the House of Lords on 26 January 1680 just as the king was about to announce a further prorogation. When the outraged monarch asked 'How he dared do that?', Thomas retorted, 'Sir, my Name is Dare' (North, 543). 
It was later alleged that while collecting signatures to the petition, Dare had said 'That the subject has but two ways of redress, by petition or rebellion', and he was indicted at the Taunton assizes at the end of March for dangerous and seditious words against the government. Dare claimed that when he had been challenged about the legality of petitioning, he had simply pointed out that Henry VIII had told the northern insurgents of 1536 'that they ought not to have rebelled, but to have applied to him by petition, the subject having, as the king's words declared, but these two ways of address'. When asked, however, whether he agreed that, 'suppose the King should not hear petitions, must we rebel', he had explicitly said, 'No, God forbid' ('CSP dom.', '1680-81', 152). The presiding judge, Sir Thomas Jones, refused Dare's request to have the trial postponed so that he could call a material witness in his defence, and advised Dare to plead guilty to the words but deny the seditious intent, promising to intercede with the king on his behalf. Dare agreed, only to be fined $500, bound over to good behaviour for three years, and ejected from his seat on the Taunton common council. At the same time the grand jury made a presentment disowning Dare's petition and bound Dare over to the next assizes to answer another charge, this time for allegedly having said to someone who had advised him not to meddle in state affairs, because the king had his privy council to advise him, 'that he knew no Council the King had, but the Duchess of Portsmouth, the French ambassador, Lord Duras [Louis Duras, earl of Feversham], and the Duke of Lauderdale' (ibid., '1679-80', 428). On 22 December the House of Commons voted to impeach Jones for his harsh treatment of Dare, though the dissolution of parliament the following month meant that no action was taken. Dare remained in prison for at least ten months because he could not pay his fine, though at length he managed to escape, whereupon he fled to the Netherlands. 
Dare attended the earl of Shaftesbury on his deathbed in January 1683 and witnessed his will. By the spring of 1683 Dare was reportedly caballing against the king's interests, and over the next couple of years his house in Amsterdam became a regular meeting-place for English exiles in the Low Countries. John Locke stayed at Dare's house following his flight to the Netherlands, and continued to receive his mail there throughout this period. The duke of Monmouth and the earl of Argyll met at Dare's house in late February 1685 to plan their co-ordinated invasion of England and Scotland, and again in April to finalize details about the two-pronged attack. Dare served as paymaster for Monmouth's invasion force and sailed with Monmouth in June, coming ashore at Chideock, in Lyme Bay, several hours in advance of the main invasion force on Thursday 11 June to gather intelligence. Dare spent the next couple of days scouring the countryside around Lyme for horse, and by Saturday the 13th had managed to create the nucleus of a cavalry force. On that day he got into an argument with his co-conspirator Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun about who should have the best horse, and in the heat of the dispute Fletcher shot him through the head and killed him. His son Thomas was also involved in the Monmouth rebellion, but turned king's evidence. Dare's wife, Ellen, had accompanied him into exile; a few weeks after his death, she was apologizing profusely to John Locke that she was not yet in a position to pay him the money he had asked for.

Disney, William (b. in or after 1633, d. 1685), conspirator, was the eldest son of Molyneux Disney (1614-1694), army officer, and his wife, Mary ('bap'. 1616, died 1669), youngest daughter of Sir Robert Monson of North Carlton. The family had been well-known puritan landowners at Norton Disney, Lincolnshire, for many generations. Molyneux Disney married Mary Monson on 14 January 1633. He raised a troop of horse for parliament in 1642-3 and was active in local government in 1645-6, but appears to have become somewhat disillusioned with the parliamentary side and in 1649 was fined for having corresponded with the royalists. In 1673 he was commissioned as an officer in the duke of Albemarle's regiment of foot. 
Disney was admitted to the Middle Temple on 12 November 1654 but was apparently never called to the bar, although a contemporary later claimed he was a barrister. Disney's activities in the 1660s and 1670s remain a mystery. In the 1680s, when he became active in whig politics, he can once again be traced. In 1680 Disney confessed to Secretary of State Leoline Jenkins and the earl of Essex that he had been investigating the issue of the duke of Monmouth's possible legitimacy, trying to discover whether Charles II had indeed married Monmouth's mother, Lucy Walters. In 1681 he published a pro-parliament treatise entitled 'Nil dictum quod non dictum prius, or, A transcript of government considered as it is in the state of nature or religion'. Disney set out to prove that the 'Saxon constitution', with its emphasis on the great council of the kingdom, survived the conquest of 1066 intact. He next asserted that the power of parliament remained 'unlimited and universal... it hath power above the Law it self, having power to alter the common law of England, to declare meaning of any doubtful law, to repeal old patents, grants, or charters and Judgements whatsoever of the king, or any court of justice, if erroneous or illegal, not without, but against the king's personal consent. (W. D., 135)' Disney was reportedly related to the Rye House plotter Major John Wildman. While there is no evidence directly linking Disney to the plot to assassinate Charles II and the duke of York at Rye House in 1683 it seems highly likely that he was involved or at least knew about the conspiracy. Following the suspicious death of the earl of Essex in the Tower in July 1683 while awaiting trial for involvement in the plot, Disney was also active in whig efforts to prove that Essex was murdered and had not committed suicide. In the months preceding Monmouth's rebellion in June 1685, Disney acted as a contact between whigs and dissenters in the Netherlands and England. He apprised Wildman and former Fifth Monarchist Henry Danvers of Monmouth's plans, but both were reluctant to give support. At one point, Disney told a Monmouth envoy in London that he had consulted with some unnamed gentlemen (probably lords Delamere and Macclesfield) and that they had suggested that the duke join the earl of Argyll's invasion of Scotland, believing that the people of England were not inclined to help Monmouth. With the help of the Quaker bookseller John Brickhurst and a Rye House conspirator, Thomas Weeks, Disney printed advance copies of Monmouth's notorious 'Declaration' (penned by 'the Plotter', Robert Ferguson). 
Disney was arrested at Lambeth on 15 June 1685 with 750 partially printed copies of Monmouth's 'Declaration' and five perfect copies. According to 'A true and full account given by the minister of St. George, concerning the behaviour and last dying speech of William Disney, esq.' (1685) he was caught with just 'his shirt on and his maid in his bed'. On 16 June he was committed by Judge Jeffreys for conspiring the death of the king and exciting persons to rebellion. He was tried on 25 June in Southwark by special commission and the lord chief justice and found guilty of treason. Disney was hanged, drawn, and quartered on 29 June 1685 at Kennington Common in Surrey. His quarters were ordered to be fixed to the city gates. In his final moments he refused to make any discovery, begged God's pardon, and told the Anglican minister with him that 'he lived in and did now die in the communion of the Church of England which he repeated again in these words, 'the Protestant Church of England'' ('A True and Full Account'). The name of Disney's wife is unknown, but they had at least three children, who in 1692 petitioned for and were granted pensions in compensation for the 'services and sufferings' of their father ('CSP dom.', '1691-2', 157).

Hilton, John (fl. 1679-1688), informer, was of unknown parents. Little is known of him prior to his notoriety in the 1680s as an informer against nonconformists. The Quakers tried to discover his origins in order to expose his misdeeds. Apparently his roots were among the Roman Catholic minor gentry of Westmorland, where he was a crony of the royalist Sir Richard Sandford, baronet, of Howgill Castle. After a career of barratry and unpaid debts he moved to London during the 1670s. There he kept an ale house in Fetter Lane and was said to have seduced into marriage and then deserted the under-age daughter of a man whom he defrauded. He was possibly at some stage a soldier, and called himself Captain Hilton. 
Hilton's moment came in May 1682, when he and his inseparable brother, 
Hilton's campaign belonged to secular politics too, for it was part of the tory purge of whigs in the wake of Charles II's dismissal of parliament in 1681 and the royal coup against the whig governors of the City of London in 1682. Hilton carried the purge to the level of parish officers, prosecuting constables who connived at dissent. He also brought a charge against the whig plutocrat Sir Robert Clayton but the case fell through when Clayton undermined Hilton's credentials as a witness. 
It is probably unique for an informer such as Hilton to produce a newspaper advertising his exploits. Thirty issues of the 'Conventicle Courant' appeared between July 1682 and February 1683. As propaganda it was a junior partner to Sir Roger L'Estrange's 'Observator' and Nathaniel Thompson's 'True Domestic Intelligence'. Hilton had the backing of tories in high places: Sir George Jeffreys (lord chancellor from 1685), and particularly Sir Thomas Jenner, recorder of London. The shady ecclesiastical lawyer Sir Thomas Pinfold, 'the spiritual dragoon', connects Hilton with the Anglican hierarchy, which valued the gang's services but took care to avoid public avowals. Archbishop Sancroft is reported to have 'excused' Hilton, for 'there must be some crooked timber used in building a ship' (Whitehead, 500). 
The dissenters played an adept game of cat and mouse with Hilton. They exposed and vilified him in 'A Letter to Hilton, the Grand Informer' (1683) and 'The English Guzman, or, Captain Hilton's Memoirs' (1683). They brought cases for debt and blackmail. They instructed constables how to evade the law's requirements -- notably in Thomas Ellwood's 'Caution to Constables' (1683). Starting up the cry in the streets, 'Informer, Informer', they summoned up belligerent crowds of apprentices, sending the Hiltons scurrying for the city militia. But his reign of intimidation was not broken until James II adopted a policy of religious toleration. In 1686 Hilton met his nemesis in the Quaker shopkeeper George Whitehead, who secured the king's commission for a public inquiry, held in June. Whitehead's case notes are in the Friends' (Quaker) archives. Gang members were then prosecuted for perjury and peculation; several were pilloried and flogged. Hilton was reduced to penury and obscurity. In 1688 Henry Care's tolerationist newspaper 'Public Occurrences' reported him to be living incognito. Hilton then disappears from the record, though he haunted City tories in the election of 1690, when whig pamphlets urged voters to reject candidates who had provided him with warrants. His date of death is unknown, as is that of his brother George. 
During the final attempt in English history to coerce the nation into religious uniformity, Hilton was at the sharp end. An odious thug, a liar, drunk, blackmailer, and rapacious fraudster, he suited the tory magnates of the 1680s. His campaign reveals the extent and the limits of law enforcement at the height of Stuart authority.

Willis, Humphrey (fl. 1630-1660), Clubman leader, was probably born at Woolavington, Somerset. His father was another Humphrey Willis (1589/90-1618); his mother was Martha Drury (died 1654), who was related to a more prominent family, the Pophams of Huntworth. They were married clandestinely in Wells Cathedral in 1606. Both Humphrey's father and grandfather claimed gentility but there was some uncertainty about the legitimacy of their coat of arms. They held their lands in Woolavington from the Pym family, who were lords of the manor; some of the land was copyhold at fixed rent and fines, some of it leasehold for lives. The Willis's holdings under both tenures, amounting to over 35 acres, were scattered across the Woolavington common fields, and this led to some complicated disputes between them and their landlord, John Pym. A chancery suit between Pym and Martha Smythe (Humphrey Willis's mother, who had remarried) was eventually arbitrated in 1632. Willis thus grew up in a family accustomed to defending its legal rights even against a lawyer as formidable as the great John Pym. 
Little is known about Willis's life before the civil war beyond the fact that during an altercation in an inn at Weare in 1630 he was alleged to be keeping a whore. In June 1645, however, he emerged as the leader of the Clubmen of mid-Somerset, who like their counterparts elsewhere wished to protect their properties from the armies of both sides, and adopted an ostensibly neutral stance between king and parliament. But, unlike most of the Wiltshire and Dorset Clubmen, Willis and his followers were clearly more friendly to parliament than to the king. On 30 June an acquaintance of the royalist Sir Humphrey Mildmay was captured by Clubmen and taken before their leader, whom Mildmay scornfully refers to as 'Lord Willis' (BL, Harleian MS 454, fol. 75'v'). Willis also turned up that day at a great meeting of local people on Sedgemoor in the Somerset levels, which was intended to create a neutralist organization. In a long speech Willis offered suggestions about the Clubmen's future course of action which show considerable political sophistication. On 11 July, the day after their victory at Langport, Sir Thomas Fairfax's troops were drawn up on Sedgemoor while the Clubmen of the Polden villages gathered on Knowle Hill, a few miles away. Willis had a friendly meeting with the general, assuring him that the purpose of their meeting was simply 'for safeguard of their goods, and for peace' (Underdown, 108). The encounter strengthened the co-operation between Willis's Clubmen and the New Model Army. 
After the civil war, however, Willis became increasingly disenchanted with parliament, and especially with the radical county committee through which it governed Somerset. In the county election at Ilchester in December 1645 he vocally supported the moderate William Strode against the committee's candidates, asserting that he could deliver 500 votes for Strode. In the following June he was alleged to be exploiting the countrymen's resentments about military rule, and to be trying to provoke another rising of Clubmen, this time against the committee. He was arrested and imprisoned at Weymouth, where he composed a bitter diatribe against the committee. His confinement, he declared, was against 'Scripture, 'Magna Carta', and the Petition of Right' (H. Willis, 'The Power of the Committee of the County of Somerset', 1646, title-page). Early in 1647 Willis launched another attack on the committee and its chairman, John Pyne, in a pamphlet entitled 'Time's Whirligig, or, The Blew-New-Made Gentleman Mounted'. The title-page depicts a committeeman arrogantly ordering the arrest of a suspect while standing on an inverted globe. The allusion to the world turned upside down is further developed in the pamphlet's doggerel verses, in which members of the committee are denounced as both dangerous revolutionaries and social upstarts. 
Nothing is known of Willis's life between February 1647 and the summer of 1659, when he wrote another attack on the republican leaders; it was published early in 1660 under the title 'England's Changeling' with some revisions expressing its author's hopes from General Monck. The bulk of the pamphlet, obviously written during the rule of the restored Rump, repeats Willis's earlier complaints about the republic's destruction of the legitimate authority of the gentry. He again disappears from the historical record after the Restoration. He may have died in Glamorgan in 1687. 
Although his family claimed higher status, and his pamphlets variously describe him as 'captain' and 'esquire', Willis was a spokesman for the English countrymen, the yeomen and husbandmen who were the main supporters of the Club movement during the later stages of the civil war. Like nearly all of them he wanted to restore a proper balance to society and ensure that government was based on 'the ancient and fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome' ('Power of the Committee', 1). The civil war, he declared, had been undertaken 'Lest arbitrary Power should State and liberty devoure' ('England's Changeling'). Parliament, and particularly its local agents, had betrayed these goals in order to achieve their own selfish ends. Willis's career and writings illustrate the movement of popular opinion from the general support for parliament that existed in 1642 to the covert royalism of the later 1640s.

Briscoe, John (d. 1697), merchant and projector, is described in many records as a merchant, although little is known of his trading activities. He was apprenticed to a member of the London Salters' Company, although his name does not appear in that company's serving registers. He may have been the John Briscoe of St Antholin, London, citizen and salter, who, aged about twenty-six, married Elizabeth Carre of St Botolph, Aldgate, on 19 December 1676. 
On 15 April 1685 Briscoe petitioned 'for letters patent for the sole use and benefit of a new invention for making sizing and whitening all sorts of writing, printing and other paper' ('CSP dom.', '1685', 130). The following year he, with others, petitioned for a charter as 'at vast expense of money and time they have brought to perfection the finest sorts of writing and printing paper by the making whereof not only will thousands be employed and brought up to industry and art, but vast sums of money will be kept in the country which are now daily sent abroad to pay for imported paper. (ibid., '1686-7', 167)' They were incorporated as the Governor and Company of White Paper Makers, and in the mid-eighteenth century it was acknowledged that 'Mr Brisco & Co.... improved the paper made greatly' (Coleman, 76). 
Briscoe was involved in the establishment of a number of other companies. In 1691 he became the deputy governor of a 'new corporation for the setting the poor at Work, by a joint stock throughout England' called the Royal Corporation in England ('CSP dom.', '1690-91', 422). Also in this year he became an assistant in the Company of Copper Miners in England for the melting down, refining, and purifying of copper ore, was involved in the incorporation of a company to establish a linen manufacture in Scotland, and became the deputy governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers trading to the north-west part of America. 
In 1694 Briscoe published 'A Discourse on the Late Funds', in which he criticized existing funds and set forth the details of his proposed land bank to be founded upon the subscriptions of land by copyholders and freeholders. He proposed the issuing of bills of credit 'being a new Species of Money, and to all Intents and Purposes as useful as Money' (Briscoe, 'A Discourse on the Late Funds of the Million Act, Lottery Act, and Bank of England', 1694, 30). Despite having his plans rejected by a Commons committee in 1695 Briscoe opened the books for subscription to the National Land Bank on 11 June 1695. With the initial target of $100,000 in land subscriptions met, a meeting was held on 10 September to establish a committee for the bank. Many failed to pay their initial instalments, and consequently the bank did very little business in the early months. At this time Briscoe's proposals to lend the government much needed money to finance the war led to a collaboration with the founders of the Land Bank at Exeter Exchange, John Asgill and Nicholas Barbon. Despite opposition, particularly from the Bank of England, the two banks were incorporated by act of parliament as the Governor and Company of the National Land Bank of England to lend the government over $2.5 million at 7 per cent interest. Subscription books were opened at the end of May 1696 but very little was subscribed, and on 11 June one contemporary observed that the 'land bank makes but little progress' (Luttrell, 4.71). The failure of this scheme has been attributed not only to the shortage of coin in this year, and the financial climate more generally, but also to 'public opinion' which appeared 'to have been against the venture' (Horsefield, 207). Both banks, however, continued separately, with Briscoe's holding meetings until at least July 1696. John Briscoe died on 13 February 1697 and in his will, proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury on 24 March, he left property in the county of Hertford to his son, John, and his London property to his daughter, Elizabeth.

Brown, William (fl. 1671-1705), legal writer, is very difficult to identify. In dedicating his 'The Entering Clerk's Vade Mecum' (1678) to Thomas Robinson (later first baronet), chief protonotary of the court of common pleas, Brown referred to 'my sixteen years experience (as clerk of your office)'. Thus it would appear that Brown began his service shortly after the Restoration. As late as his 'Privilegia parliamentaria' (1704) he was described as 'a clerk of the court of Common Pleas'. It seems likely from this fact that he was of insufficient status to be identified with any of his namesakes who were educated in the inns of court after the Restoration. 
Brown's stock-in-trade consisted of books of tutorials for the aspiring clerk, books of precedents, and manuals for public officials such as justices of the peace. His first work appears to have been 'Formulae bene placitandi: a Book of Entries, Containing Variety of Choice Precedents', published in 1671, which had a second edition in 1675. 'Modus intrandi placita generalia: the Entring Clerk's Introduction' followed in 1674, with a second edition in 1687. 'The Entering Clerk's Vade Mecum' followed in 1678. Further guides and collections of precedents followed. After the revolution he appears to have branched out, publishing in 1705 'Astraeae abdicatae restauratio, or, Advice to Justices of the Peace', but the method was the same, a compendium of information. 
Brown was rarely an original writer. He edited works by William Sheppard, and the preface to Brown's 'Methodus novissima intrandi placita generalia' (1699) revealed something of his method. He had waited thirty years to obtain the drafts of William Gardiner, late of Barnard's Inn, another clerk of the common pleas, which he now presented to the public. 
Brown's date of death is unknown, but the will of a 'William Browne of the Middle Temple' was proved in October 1712. Writing on 20 April 1712, the author describes himself as 'gent', and refers to 'my circumstances being in not so good a condition as I could wish' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/529, sig. 180), and to chambers in Fig Tree Court in the Temple, which he had purchased from Denham Pritherick for life, and now rented to Sam Provost. He himself lived in Brick Lane in the Temple, and left a wife, Elizabeth, and a brother, Robert.

Leach, William (fl. 1631-1655), attorney and pamphleteer, was the son and heir of John Leach of Felmersham, Bedfordshire, gentleman. Little else is known of his personal background except that he resided for most of his adult life with his wife in a ground chamber of the Middle Temple on the side leading out of Pump Court, which he was granted for life in 1655. 
Leach entered the Middle Temple in June 1631 and was specially admitted on 25 January 1632. By the summer of 1635 he had established himself as a 'common attorney', rather than advancing to the bar. Although almost nothing is known of his professional life in the London area, court records indicate that he and his wife were frequently in debt in the latter half of the 1640s. Nevertheless he acceded to the honorary office of tipstaff to the high court of justice in 1650. 
Leach brought his experience as a common attorney, as well as a defendant, to the public discussion of legal reform that followed the execution of Charles I in 1649. Over the next four years he published sixteen pamphlets consisting of 'queries and proposals' which together outlined a programme for the reform of the entire English legal system. His concern throughout was to spur debate on the institutional corruption and nuisance cases that he believed cost the English people 'millions of money' yearly and to offer viable remedies. 
Leach's primary focus was the corruption and inadequacies of local legal jurisdiction. He devoted several pamphlets to the need for the complete overhaul of debtor's law, which, he thought, contributed to the rise of begging, vagabondage, and crime. He estimated that there were some 20,000 people imprisoned for debt in England in 1650. Most of these, he argued, either did not have the immediate means to pay their creditors or chose to remain in prison to defraud them. As a remedy, he proposed that a creditor be granted a court writ authorizing the seizure of a debtor's possessions in lieu of imprisonment. He also advocated stringent regulation of the jury system. In 'The Bribe-Takers of Jury-Men' (1652) he complained that the fall in money values allowed such disreputable types as 'needy alehouse-keepers', who were subject to pressure from their bailiff customers, to sit on lower court juries. He also charged that sheriffs failed to summon knights, esquires, gentlemen, and the 'better sort' in general to jury service, in return for gain or patronage. Leach's proposals for juries included a property qualification of at least 40's'. annual taxable value, a sobriety test, a secret ballot system for verdicts, laws to punish jury tampering by men of influence, and the right to attaint individual jurors. 
Leach was fully aware of the rising tide of litigation inundating the Westminster courts. Unlike radical reformers who called for the abolition of the common law courts, he instead focused on procedural reforms to cut waste and increase efficiency, since he believed that decentralization of the courts would inevitably lead to excessive variation in the interpretation of law. To reduce litigation, Leach recommended that plaintiffs offer a security in the amount for which they were suing, and that the decisions of courts at every level be final. He also highlighted the widespread abuse of writs issued by the chancery court by those attempting to impede or expedite the judgments of lower courts, and by the chancery clerks who trafficked in the sale of writs and precedents. As a palliative he proposed that disputed judgments be returned to their court of origin for amendment and that all writs and precedents be published so that the common litigant would have free access to them. 
In 'A New Parliament' (1651) Leach applied his understanding of the corruption of local jurisdictions to the election and sitting of parliament. He recommended annual sittings with fixed election dates, a franchise limited to all ratepayers, secret ballots, the use of election scrutineers, and an end to the representation of depopulated boroughs. He also believed that the presence of 'learned lawyers' among the MPs was necessary for the enactment of good laws and the avoidance of confusion. Yet despite his high estimation of the legal profession, he elsewhere advocated the abolition of its monopoly on pleading in the lower courts, a set schedule of fees, and the establishment of a central registry of all legal documents open to the people in the name of cost-efficiency. 
Leach's work bears witness to the marked upsurge of litigation in the first half of the seventeenth century, and the resulting popular frustration with the justice system at all levels. On the whole, his views were in line with most contemporary moderate reformers, whose work he supported in Barebone's Parliament and the Hale commission.

Reid, Patrick Robert (1910-1990), escape officer and author, was born on 13 November 1910 in India, the son of John Reid, of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Alice Mabel Daniell. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College, co. Kildare, and at Wimbledon College, and went on to King's College, London, where he was awarded a BSc in 1932. He qualified as a civil engineer in 1936, while serving his pupillage with Sir Alexander Gibbs & Partners, a leading firm of consulting engineers, from 1934 to 1937. With the outbreak of war in 1939 he was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps and was posted to France as an ammunition officer with the British expeditionary force, but he was taken prisoner on 27 May 1940 and sent to the prison camp at Laufen, near Salzburg, in Austria. In that year he was awarded the MBE. 
Dressed as a German peasant woman, Reid escaped from Laufen through a tunnel in September 1940, but was recaptured within a week, and on 7 November he was transferred to Colditz Castle, Oflag IVC, in Saxony. Built on top of a cliff overlooking the River Mulde, it was supposedly impregnable and it was the prison to which allied officers were sent if they had already tried to escape from other German prisons. Because every officer regarded it as his duty to escape, each nationality had its own committee, headed by an escape officer, and though they worked in secret the committees to some extent kept each other informed of their plans and benefited from each others' experiences. Reid was made British escape officer in January 1941. The first escape that he masterminded, in June 1941, involved tunnelling from underneath the floorboards of the canteen to a point beyond the outer wall, but it failed when the twelve officers emerging from the tunnel were betrayed by the German sentry who had been bribed to look the other way. He was responsible, however, for the success of the next attempt, by Lieutenant Airey Neave and a companion in January 1942. On 14 October, having resigned as escape officer in order to organize his own escape, he and three others succeeded in escaping from Colditz, having loosened the bars of a window with a saw smuggled in in a food parcel and with the help of a detailed plan of the castle discovered in the British Museum. They made their escape during 'music practice', conducted by Douglas Bader, who was able to signal the movements of sentries by stopping and starting the music. All four reached Switzerland safely. Reid was awarded the MC in 1943 and reached the rank of major. 
Reid spent the rest of the war in Switzerland, as assistant military attache at the British legation in Bern, working under the British air attache, Air Commodore 'Freddie' West, who was providing an intelligence service behind enemy lines and supervising escape routes from occupied territories. He later helped West to write his autobiography, 'Winged Diplomat' (1962). After D-day, Reid was part of the team, in close contact with members of the French resistance, sending and receiving information across the border, and during the winter he was one of those involved in the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners organized by the International Red Cross. In August 1943, while in Switzerland, he married Jane Cabot, one of the Boston Cabots; they had three sons and two daughters, but were divorced in 1966. 
After the war Reid remained in the diplomatic service, and was posted to Ankara in 1946, as first secretary for commercial affairs. In 1949 he joined the diplomatic staff of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), in Paris, where he spent three years as chief administrator of the Marshall aid plan. He became famous after the publication of 'The Colditz Story' in 1952 -- his account of life in Colditz and details of the escapes were regarded by some as the best escape story to come out of the Second World War -- and its sequel, 'The Latter Days at Colditz' (1953). These were followed by a film, 'The Colditz Story' (1955), starring John Mills as Pat Reid; the television series, 'Colditz' (1972-4), one of the most popular series ever shown on television; and a successful board game, 'Escape from Colditz'. Reid returned to his Colditz experiences in 'Colditz: the Full Story' (1984); by this time over sixty books had been written about Colditz, in several languages, including German, Dutch, and Polish. He also wrote 'Prisoner of War' (1953), the story of prisoners-of-war throughout history, and 'My Favourite Escape Stories' (1975). When criticized for cashing in on his wartime experiences and overshadowing the achievements and sufferings of other escapers he pointed out that he had waited ten years before writing about them, and that any of his fellow prisoners could have done likewise. He was also accused of glamourizing the life of a prisoner-of-war, as in his description of brewing beer from dried fruit received in Red Cross parcels and distilling it by using a large jam tin and lead piping from one of the lavatories. 
Prospective Conservative candidate for Dartford and Erith from 1953 to 1955, Reid failed to get elected in the general election of 1955. He returned to engineering and was a director of Richard Costain Ltd from 1959 to 1962 and of W. S. Atkins & Partners, a firm of consulting engineers, from 1962 to 1963; he then established his own business, Kem Estates Ltd, which built houses mainly in Sussex. In 1977 he married Mrs Mary Stewart Cunliffe-Lister, who died in the following year, and in 1982 he married, as his third wife, Mrs Nicandra Hood. He died in Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, on 22 May 1990.

Dick, George Williamson Auchinvole (1914-1997), pathologist and virologist, was born on 14 August 1914 in Glasgow, the second of three sons of the Revd David Auchinvole Dick (1881-1964) and his wife, Blanche Hay, 'nee' Spence (died 1945). His younger brother, Sir John Alexander Dick (1920-1994), was sheriff principal of Glasgow and Strathkelvin. Educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and at the University of Edinburgh, he graduated MB ChB in 1938 and followed this with BSc (hons. path.) in 1939, being awarded the Buchanan medal. 
Initial ideas of a career in obstetrics were changed by the outbreak of the Second World War and service as a Royal Army Medical Corps pathologist in east Africa command. The challenge of infectious diseases and their control appealed to Dick, and at the end of the war he transferred to the colonial medical research service and was seconded to the Rockefeller Foundation Yellow Fever Research Laboratory at Entebbe, Uganda. In 1941 he married Brenda Marian Cook ('b'. 1916), who joined him at Entebbe, where their first child was born. He spent five productive years there with pioneer American virologists R. M. Taylor, K. C. Smithburn, and others as colleagues. These were exciting times and many new viruses were isolated, mostly by the inoculation of mice. Uganda S and Zika viruses were mosquito borne viruses related to yellow fever virus that caused mild disease in man. Another, Mengo encephalomyelitis virus, proved to be a mouse virus related to poliomyelitis virus which demonstrated its human pathogenicity by infecting Dick, although fortunately the encephalitis was mild and transient. 
After his Entebbe period the award of a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship enabled Dick to visit the Rockefeller Institute, New York, and Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, where he enrolled at the school of hygiene and public health and graduated master of public health in 1949. He also received a gold medal for his MD at the University of Edinburgh in the same year. From 1951 to 1954 he joined the division of bacteriology and virology at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, where he published several papers on mouse hepatitis viruses with C. H. Andrewes, J. S. F. Niven, A. W. Gledhill, and F. B. Bang. Colleagues who had the good fortune to be initiated into the mysteries of tropical virology by George Dick during this period were struck by the breadth of his knowledge and his enthusiasm for research. 
Dick was now ready to head a department of his own and this he did by becoming professor of microbiology at Queen's University, Belfast, where he remained from 1955 to 1965. His research fields there included poliomyelitis, measles and its variant form, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, whooping cough, and multiple sclerosis. When live attenuated virus vaccine was first introduced for poliomyelitis it was feared that virus reversion to virulence might occur with consequent spread of the disease. Dick, appreciating the advantages of live attenuated vaccines from his knowledge of poliomyelitis and yellow fever, realized that the risk was very small and had no hesitation in giving live polio vaccine to his four-year-old daughter, causing excited press comment at the time. In Africa he had seen smallpox outbreaks and recognized the need for Jennerian vaccination there but at the annual general meeting of the British Medical Association in 1962 he called for the abandonment of infant vaccination against smallpox in the UK on the grounds that there it caused more sickness and deaths than smallpox itself. The Ministry of Health later accepted this view, the point becoming purely academic following the eradication of smallpox virus. 
In 1966 Dick transferred to the Middlesex Hospital, becoming Bland-Sutton professor of pathology in the University of London, and director of the Bland-Sutton Institute, a challenging task with a considerable administrative burden, carried with his customary energy. His research interests at this period included Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Marburg virus infections, and he was called upon to act as an expert witness in court cases. In 1973 he became assistant director of the British Postgraduate Medical Federation and postgraduate dean, south-west Thames regional health authority. His duties were to see that training kept pace with the new advances in current medical science. 
Dick also found time in a busy life to publish 'Immunisation' (1978), later reissued as 'Practical Immunisation' (1986), 'Immunology of Infectious Diseases' (1979), and 'Health on Holiday and other Travels' (1982). From 1973 to 1981 he was also emeritus professor of pathology, honorary lecturer, and honorary consultant at the Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street. He also served as an examiner at medical schools in the UK, Dublin, Nairobi, Kampala, Riyadh, and Jiddah. These academic appointments did not prevent him from becoming involved with other organizations such as Amnesty International, whose aims and objectives he shared. He was president of the Institute of Medical and Laboratory Technicians, 1966-76, member of mid-downs health authority, Sussex, 1981-4, and his work on behalf of libraries was recognized by his being made an honorary fellow of the Library Association. Perhaps the recognition that gave him greatest pleasure was to be named outstanding alumnus in public health by Johns Hopkins University in 1986 and hero of public health by its school of hygiene and public health in 1992. 
Genial and outgoing in nature, Dick was always very good company. He was a founder fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists, a member of council from 1970 to 1973 and its treasurer from 1973 to 1978. As one of the duties of the treasurer was to buy the wine, he attended and passed the examination in a wine appreciation course, with consequent benefit to the college cellar. A son of the manse and of independent spirit, he set up the Rowhook Medical Society which met at his home in Sussex, where matters of moment in medicine and the control of infectious diseases were debated. His personal contributions to this field were considerable, and not fully appreciated during his lifetime. He died from cancer of the prostate at Midhurst, Sussex, on 3 July 1997, and was cremated. He was survived by his wife, Brenda, four children, Bruce, Alison, Caroline, and John-Mark, and nine grandchildren.

Hassan, Sir Joshua Abraham (1915-1997), chief minister of Gibraltar, was born in Gibraltar on 21 August 1915, the son of Abraham M. Hassan, a cloth merchant, from a distinguished merchant family of Moroccan Sephardi extraction that had first settled in Gibraltar in 1728. He was educated by the Christian brothers of Line Wall College, then studied law in London, and was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1939. For most of his life he managed to combine both law and politics. 
Hassan's particular eminence derived from the exceptional circumstances in which Gibraltar found itself during and immediately after the Second World War. After the fall of France in 1940, the early successes of the axis powers in north Africa had an immense impact on the vulnerable but vital crown colony. While the colonial authorities were obliged to stay put, the safety and well-being of the women, children, and elderly could not be guaranteed in the desperate military situation, and they were evacuated. Hassan gained respect for his work on the Gibraltar evacuation committee and by his equally energetic efforts in 1944 to have the evacuees returned, despite severe transport restrictions. His active participation in Gibraltar's defence as a Bofors gunner enhanced his political credentials. Meanwhile, in 1941 he became deputy coroner, and in 1945 he was elected to the city council of Gibraltar. He served as mayor from 1945 to 1950 and from 1953 to 1969 (when the city council was merged with the legislative council to form the house of assembly). He married, in 1945, Daniela Salazar, of La Linea de la Concepcion, Spain. They had two daughters. 
The wartime privations on the Rock demonstrated to authorities and inhabitants alike the limitations of the chaotic multiple administrative systems that had developed in 'ad hoc' fashion. By 1949 the administration of Gibraltar, with its total area of 1360 acres and population of 27,000 civilians and military, was divided among no fewer than five semi-autonomous authorities: the three military services plus the colonial and municipal institutions. Such complexity was 'neither intelligible, reasonable, or sensible', noted a Colonial Office report in 1949, but 'foolish, absurd, and extravagant' (TNA: PRO, CO 91/537-9). As a result a new legislative council was set up in 1950. The elections to the new council held that autumn brought in two conservative independents and three candidates (including Hassan) sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights (AACR). The AACR had been founded by Hassan during the war and was closely linked to the Gibraltar Confederation of Labour, which he had long championed. Two positions on the executive council could be nominated by the governor. The favourite from the shortlist proved unavailable, since the American consulate for which he worked would not release him, and a second, on account of a communist affiliation, was regarded as unsuitable. The Colonial Office wanted at least one position to go to an AACR member. Hassan, though a one-time radical activist, had all the right qualifications. He was a Gibraltarian, he was a lawyer, he was fiercely loyal to Britain, and he had strong links to Gibraltar's workers, whose votes would prove vital in upholding the colony's links with Britain. 
Hassan's appointment to the executive council and as chief member of the legislative council marked the beginning of a career dedicated to making clear Gibraltar's rejection of Spanish claims while at the same time minimizing Whitehall's control as much as possible. In this, the international situation was to Hassan's advantage. Of all Britain's colonial possessions during this period of intense decolonization, the escalation of the cold war ensured that Gibraltar remained the most significant strategically and politically. Consequently the Gibraltar question was handled with exceptional tact and co-operation by the Colonial Office and Gibraltarians alike. 
Hassan was knighted in 1963 (he had been made LVO in 1954 and CBE in 1957). In 1964, under a new constitution, he became the first chief minister of Gibraltar. He headed petitions in 1963, 1964, and 1966 before the United Nations Committee of Twenty-four, created in November 1961 to examine questions of independence. His aim, contrary to Spanish demands, was for Gibraltar not to relinquish ties with Britain but to have an administration similar to that of the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. This had been suggested in a Colonial Office report of 1949, possibly at the instigation of Hassan himself. The United Nations was unimpressed by the arguments he and his colleague Peter Isola put forward. Nevertheless, a referendum of 10 September 1967 infuriated Spain but vindicated his approach, with a vote of 12,138 (95.8 per cent) in favour of remaining, as he put it, 'With Britain, but not under Britain' ('The Independent', 2 July 1997). In 1969 Hassan achieved his aim of a new constitution, which removed the anomaly of separate city and legislative councils, and in which Britain guaranteed that Gibraltar would never be ceded to another state against the wishes of its citizens. For Gibraltarians this proved something of a pyrrhic victory, however, with the closing in June 1969 of Spain's border with Gibraltar. Hassan's private life caused controversy the same year, when he introduced a private member's bill allowing him to divorce his wife, Daniela. Divorce was then otherwise impossible in predominantly Roman Catholic Gibraltar. Following the divorce Hassan married, the same year, Marcelle Bensimon. They, too, had two daughters. 
In the election of 1969 Hassan's AACR was narrowly defeated by Robert Peliza's Integration with Britain party. He nevertheless returned as chief minister in 1972, an office he retained through subsequent elections until 1987. Although Spain's claims to Gibraltar and its closure of the border continued after General Franco's death in 1975, the situation could be approached with less tension. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher found the new Spanish premier someone with whom she could converse, if not agree. Thatcher used the threat of a veto on Spanish entry into the EU and NATO to force the reopening of the border; the price, through the Brussels agreement of 1984, was discussion of sovereignty. Hassan's albeit reluctant endorsement of the agreement undermined his position with the people of Gibraltar. The closure of Gibraltar's airport for flights to anywhere but Britain, following the breakdown of a 1983 agreement with Spain, further weakened Hassan's support. He resigned as chief minister on 9 December 1987 and retired from politics at the election the following year. He was appointed KCMG in 1986 and GBE in 1988. 
Throughout his years as chief member and chief minister, Hassan continued to work as a practising lawyer, the position of chief member/minister being only part-time. He represented Robert Maxwell, whose holding company was registered in Gibraltar, and following his retirement as chief minister he represented one of the witnesses at the inquest into the shooting by the SAS of three suspected IRA terrorists in Gibraltar in 1987. He was chairman of the Gibraltar bar council from 1992 to 1995. 
Hassan was 'an open and accessible man, greeting people on the street of his colony, and claiming to know the names of most of them' ('The Independent', 2 July 1997). He enjoyed wide popularity, being fondly known as Salvador -- though also, less fondly, as El Pulpo, the octopus, whose tentacles reached into every aspect of Rock life. He died in Gibraltar on 1 July 1997, survived by his wife, Marcelle, their two daughters, and the two daughters of his first marriage.

Crowe, Dame Sylvia (1901-1997), landscape architect, was born on 15 September 1901 at 30 Oxford Road, Neithrop, Banbury, Oxfordshire, the daughter of Eyre Crowe, a box and cabinet manufacturer who, because of ill health, retired early to become a fruit farmer near the village of Felbridge, Sussex, and his wife, Beatrice, 'nee' Stockton. Crowe's own childhood was also marred by ill health, for after attending Berkhamsted Girls' School in Hertfordshire from 1908 to 1912 she had to stay at home receiving only spasmodic lessons as a result of her suffering from tuberculosis. None the less her memories of childhood were happy. Her parents were devoted to the countryside, their farm was in a delightful part of England beside the shores of a lake, and they often travelled in France and Corsica, where she remembered her 'fourth birthday in a Corsican forest sitting revelling in the carpet of wild cyclamen' (Harvey, 'Reflections', 31). While kept away from school in her teens she helped on her father's farm and wandered in the landscape. In her early twenties she spent several years in the beautiful countryside of Italy with her parents. She attended Swanley Horticultural College (1920-22), became a pupil of the landscape gardener Edward White (1926-7) and then worked as a garden designer for William Cutbush & Son's nurseries in Barnet. The sensitivity of her garden designs was recognized when she won a gold medal at the Chelsea flower show in 1937 for a contoured bluebell wood from which a stream flowed into a naturalistic pond. During the Second World War she served first with the Polish army in France as a volunteer ambulance driver, and then in motor transport, becoming a sergeant in the ATS. In later life she always liked to be driven by others. 
After 1945 Crowe entered private practice as a landscape architect, sharing an office, but never as partner, with Brenda Colvin, whose ideas she was soon to put into practice with startling effectiveness and perception. In 1956 she wrote: 'I gratefully acknowledge my debt to all who have contributed to the present school of thought on landscape, and in particular to Brenda Colvin... and to G. A. Jellicoe' (Crowe, foreword). Crowe was the great achiever of the landscape profession in the second half of the twentieth century. Her humanity, her common touch, and her charm, combined with vigour and clarity of purpose, enabled her to persuade her numerous clients to put her ideas about landscape into practice. She wrote: 'The object of my work and writing is to reconcile the needs and aspirations of men with the welfare of the natural order and to create beauty out of the fusion of the human spirit and the workings of nature. I try to enter into the spirit of each landscape and to express its individual character. (Emanuel, 180)' She worked in Great Britain (except for once in India and a plan for the Commonwealth Gardens in Canberra, Australia), from a small office at 182 Gloucester Place, London, assisted by Wendy Powell and a few others. The 1950s to 1970s, when she was at her most productive, were a period when minimalism was important in artistic thought. Many of her works were reticent in displaying her own artistic endeavour, so that her designs for huge modifications of the landscape for human purposes have been perceived as part of the natural order of things. Many of her works were indeed great in scale. One of her first tasks after the Second World War was to work on the reclamation of sand dunes in Lincolnshire damaged by wartime gun emplacements and so by eroding. 
In 1948 Crowe became consultant on landscape design at Harlow New Town, where she made real the green spaces on Sir Frederick Gibberd's master plan. This work led to work in other new towns, including Basildon in Essex, Washington in co. Durham, and Warrington in Lancashire. She was the landscape consultant for nuclear power stations at Trawsfynydd, in Snowdonia, where she had refused to support the principle of a power station in a national park, and at Wylfa head, Anglesey. In both these projects her interest in creating artificial hills helped to mask smaller elements and create a large-scale setting for the huge generators. She designed and saw completed numerous landscapes adjacent to buildings, university courtyards in Oxford, hospital grounds, churchyards, and training colleges. Her gardens at the Cement and Concrete Association Research Station at Wexham Springs in Buckinghamshire, the Scottish Widows' Fund offices in Edinburgh, and the Commonwealth Institute in London, were particularly well known. She also greatly enjoyed designing landscapes for reservoirs, including Bewl Bridge and Bough Beech in Kent and Wimbleball in Somerset: 'it is very largely the recreational side I have to worry about, because the water is there anyway' (Harvey, 'Reflections', 51). A masterpiece was her design for Rutland water, a project to which she was personally attached. The landscape was planned around this beautiful lake to benefit engineering, wildlife, visitors, and nearby residents in equal measure in a new place of serenity and harmony, 'created with the three great landscape elements of landform, trees and water' (Crowe, 63). 
Crowe's greatest achievement was her work as the first landscape consultant to the Forestry Commission from 1964 to 1976. 'One had to use discretion and diplomacy in the early days until gradually good landscape became accepted within the Commission... I believe that planting should be made to talk the same language as the terrain' (Harvey, 'Reflections', 44-5). She completely changed the ethos of the commission from a narrow specialism to a body able to balance the needs of timber production with wildlife, recreation, and beauty of landscape. Her ideas, communicated with an infectious smile and lucid exposition, came to be embraced by all from foresters in the field to senior civil servants. Her slim and influential book 'Forestry in the Landscape' (1966) expounded her ideas on this subject. It was one of many books, including 'Tomorrow's Landscape' (1956), 'Garden Design' (1958), 'The Landscape of Power' (1958), 'The Landscape of Roads' (1960), 'Space for Living', which she edited (1961), 'Shaping Tomorrow's Landscape', which she co-wrote with Zvi Miller (1964), 'The Landscapes of Forests and Woods' (1978), and 'The Pattern of Landscape' (1988). 
Crowe was founding honorary secretary (1948), vice-president and secretary-general (1953-9), and president (1969) of the International Federation of Landscape Architects, president of her professional body, the Institute of Landscape Architects, later the Landscape Institute (1957-9), chairman of the Tree Council (1974-6), and a founder member of the environmental planning committee of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. She received honorary doctorates from the University of Newcastle (1976), Herriot-Watt University (1976), and the University of Sussex (1978), honorary fellowships of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Royal Town Planning Institute, the Institute of Chartered Foresters, and the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, and the special honours of the president's medal of the American Society of Landscape Architects (1988), the Victoria medal of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society (1990), and the gold medal of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (1990). She was created CBE in 1967 and DBE in 1973, the first landscape architect to be so highly honoured since Sir Joseph Paxton 122 years earlier. She lived for more than fifty years in a small basement flat in Ladbroke Grove, London, fading slowly but gracefully until her death from bronchopneumonia at St Mary's Hospital, Westminster, on 30 June 1997. She never married. Her beautiful features and earthy laugh expressed contentment with life: 'I have enjoyed being a landscape architect; I would not have wanted to be anything else' (Harvey, 'Reflections', 51).

Marshall, Agnes Bertha (1855-1905), ice-cream maker, was born on 24 August 1855 at Walthamstow, Essex, the daughter of John Smith, a clerk, and his wife, Susan. After her father's early death her mother remarried. Nothing is known about her early education or where she learned to cook, but it was later stated in the 'Pall Mall Gazette' that 'Mrs Marshall has made a thorough study of cookery since she was a child, and has practised at Paris and with Vienna's celebrated chefs' (Weir and others, 12). On 17 August 1878 she married Alfred William, son of Thomas Marshall, a builder. 
Agnes Marshall became one of the foremost Victorian cookery writers, and was the best-known writer of the day on ice-cream. Her 'Book of Ices' appeared in 1885, followed by 'Mrs A. B. Marshall's Cookery Book' (1888). Her 'Larger Cookery Book of Recipes' was published in 1891. A book entitled 'Fancy Ices' appeared in 1894. Agnes Marshall and her husband also established the Marshall School of Cookery -- one of only two major London cookery schools -- at 31 Mortimer Street, London, in January 1883. From 1886 they began to produce 'The Table', a weekly newspaper devoted to 'Cookery, Gastronomy [and] food amusements', and for the first six months Agnes produced a new recipe for each issue. 
Unlike Mrs Beeton, who edited a work that also contained readers' recipes, Mrs Marshall featured dishes which she herself devised. The introduction to her first book assured the reader that 'every recipe in it has been tried out by myself, and that I have written each accordingly, and have not copied from other authors'. Her recipes were models of exact detail, simplicity, and accuracy; and, according to the 'Oxford English Dictionary', that for Cumberland rum butter was the earliest recorded. 
Marshall's most lasting contributions were her two classic books on ice-cream: only one earlier book on the subject in English is known. Her innovations included the design of a fast ice-cream machine (patented by her husband). In 1888 she suggested putting ice-cream in an edible cornet or cone -- a practice previously thought to have originated in the USA. The use of liquefied gas in the making of ice-cream can also be credited to her. She helped popularize ice-creams and sorbets, at a time when they were still novel, enabled to do so by the importation of inexpensive ice from both Norway and the USA. An adept publicist, Agnes Marshall gave demonstrations all over the country to audiences of anything up to 500 people, and these helped promote not only her cookery school and publications, but also the business that she ran with her husband. This involved the manufacture and retail of cooking equipment, stocked by top department stores like Harrods. The firm also fitted out country house kitchens. 
Mrs Marshall's reputation rapidly declined after her death. She never properly recovered after being thrown from a horse in 1904; and she died at The Towers, Pinner, on 29 July 1905. She was cremated at Golders Green crematorium, her ashes being interred at Paines Lane cemetery, Pinner. Her husband got married again within a year, to a secretary she had previously sacked. The rights to her books were sold to Ward Lock, the publishers of Mrs Beeton. The culinary equipment business declined and was also eventually sold. 
Recent publications, however, have restored Agnes Marshall to her rightful place in the pantheon of Victorian cookery experts. Elizabeth David refers to the 'famous Mrs Marshall' in her posthumously published 'Harvest of the Cold Months: the Social History of Ice and Ices' (1994), and reproduces an illustration of 'A bomba a la Fedora' from 'Fancy Ices'. A recent biographical study has the title, 'Mrs Marshall: the Greatest Victorian Ice Cream Maker' (1998).

Jackson, Raymond Allen (1927-1997), cartoonist and illustrator, was born in the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 11 March 1927, the only child of Maurice Jackson, formerly Jacobovitz (1894-1960), a journeyman tailor from Lodz, Poland, who had lived in France and then Brighton before moving to work in London's 'rag-trade' area around Great Titchfield Street. At first he changed his name to Jacob and then to Jackson and later set up his own ladies' tailoring shop in Kensington Mall, Notting Hill Gate. Raymond's mother was an Irishwoman, Marie (Polly) Murphy ('b'. 1904), who also worked in the clothing business. He was educated at Clipstone Road School, London, and Lyulph Stanley Central School, London. At fourteen he worked as a messenger boy in the Great Titchfield Street area before going to Willesden Technical College and School of Art (1941-4), where a fellow pupil was the illustrator Peter Jackson. There he spent two years in general education before studying art full-time for a further two years, training as a student teacher. On 3 April 1945 he enlisted for the Territorial Army and served at first as a driver in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps before joining its education division (1945-8). Teaching conscripts to paint, he was posted to Italy, Palestine (1945-7), and Egypt (he was an instructor at the Middle East Art College, 1947-8) and achieved the rank of sergeant. He then returned to Willesden Technical College (1948-50) to study commercial art, graduating with a national diploma in design. 
In 1950 Jackson joined the Link House Publishing Group (1950-51) as a staff artist, retouching pubic hair on photos for 'Health & Efficiency', and drawing a series of cartoons about a character called Curly. He then moved to Keymers Advertising Agency as an artist (1951-2) while also contributing joke cartoons to 'Punch', 'Lilliput', and other publications. He joined the 'Evening Standard' in 1952, first in the advertising department at 11 guineas a week, then as a freelance general illustrator for the paper before moving to the art department, producing drawings for the television and sports pages, illustrations for features (signing his drawings Ray Jackson), and occasional caricatures and pocket cartoons. In October 1954 he met his wife Claudie Grenier ('b'. 1936), a French au pair from Epernay, at the Linguists' Club in Kensington. They were married on 9 March 1957 and had three children: Dominique, Patrick, and Nathalie. 
After the death of Vicky (Victor Weisz), Jak became the 'Standard''s political cartoonist (1966-97), while also drawing for its sister paper, the 'Daily Express', on Saturdays. When the 'Evening Standard' was bought by Associated Newspapers in 1986, he stopped drawing for the 'Express' and drew instead for the 'Daily Mail' on Saturdays and the 'Mail on Sunday'. Altogether he worked for the 'Evening Standard' for forty-five years. In addition he contributed occasional journalism to the paper (especially travel articles with illustrations and photographs by himself in the 1960s), drew advertisements for Carling Black Label beer and others, illustrated several books including the 'Guinness Book of Records', edited by Norris and Ross McWhirter (1974), and 'Russia Dies Laughing' (1982), and painted in watercolour. His own publications included thirty-one annuals of 'Evening Standard' cartoons from 'The Nutty World of JAK' (1966). 
Jackson admired the work of Ronald Searle, Pat Oliphant, Ralph Steadman, and (the early) Carl Giles -- whose detailed and realistic style influenced his own greatly. He roughed cartoons out in 2B pencil on A2 layout paper (usually six a day from which the editor chose one), and completed the drawing with a brush and mapping pen using Pelikan ink on board, tints being indicated with pale blue wash. Jak always drew hands with three fingers in the style of Disney animators and signed his name in capitals with 'blob' serifs. In his early drawings he often included a portrait of his wife (with a pony tail) and their boxer dog, Shamus. He was a technically proficient artist, good at backgrounds and architectural details, but (like Giles), 'excelled at drawing types: bumbling vicars and desiccated judges; crusty clubmen with quivering moustaches; bobbies and burglars and dimwitted bruisers; vast armour-plated matrons; long-legged lovelies, top-heavy on stiletto heels' ('The Times'). Though he supported no political party his cartoons were sometimes controversial. One drawing -- 'Homo-Electrical-sapiens Britannicus circa 1970' (9 December 1970) -- which criticized a work-to-rule action by power-station workers, nearly resulted in the 'Standard''s closure as a result of sympathetic industrial action by print unions. Another ('The ultimate in psychopathic horror -- THE IRISH', 29 October 1982), caused the Labour-controlled Greater London council to stop advertising in the 'Evening Standard' as a protest. 
Jak claimed to have been the first to break the (post-Victorian) unwritten prohibition on caricaturing the British royal family. The Labour prime minister Tony Blair called him 'one of the finest political cartoonists' and Lord Rothermere added that he was 'one of the all-time greats alongside Rowlandson, Gillray and Illingworth' (foreword to 'Jak: his Life and Work'). He was voted political/social cartoonist of the year three times by the Cartoonists' Club of Great Britain (1964, 1965, 1985), British Press awards cartoonist of the year (1980), and Glen Grant sports cartoonist of the year (1981) and royal cartoonist of the year (1981). Jak was a founder member of the British Cartoonists' Association in 1966 and also belonged to the Chelsea Arts Club, the Saints' and Sinners' Club, and the Special Forces' Club. Examples of his work were included in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition 'Drawn and quartered: the world of the British newspaper cartoon' (1970) and can be found in such public collections as the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Cartoon Archive at the University of Kent at Canterbury. 
'Small, wiry and as strong as an ox' (McKay and McGill, 5), Jak was 5 feet 8 inches tall, and was usually clean-shaven with prematurely thin dark brown (later grey) hair. He had brown eyes and wore thick spectacles from the age of two. At work he would always wear a butcher's apron. A judo blackbelt and a keen golfer, his motto was a variant of Disraeli's: 'Never explain; never complain'. Raymond Jackson died at his home, 21 Seymour Road, Wimbledon, London, on 27 July 1997 following a heart operation. He was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium, London, on 1 August 1997.

Burgin, Edward Leslie (1887-1945), solicitor and politician, was born on 13 July 1887 at Timberscombe, Dollis Road, Finchley, the elder son of Edward Lambert Burgin (1858-1941), solicitor, and his wife, Marian Kate, 'nee' Showler (1862-1933). He was educated at Christ's College, Finchley, and the University of London, where he gained first-class honours in law in 1908; he also studied in Lausanne and Paris. The following year he took top place in the Law Society's final examination and joined his father's firm, Denton, Hall and Burgin of Gray's Inn Place, London, and rue Sainte-Anne, Paris. The firm specialized in international commerce, and Burgin drew on his growing practical experience of probate to inform a London University doctoral (LLD) thesis, 'The Administration of Foreign Estates', which was published in 1913. On 30 May 1912 he married Dorothy Theresa (1888-1975), third daughter of Charles Henry Cooper, a Finchley trimming manufacturer; they had one son and four daughters. 
During the First World War Burgin put his considerable linguistic talents to use as an intelligence officer and was awarded the croce di guerra for his work on the Italian front. On his return to London he combined a successful legal practice with part-time teaching for the Law Society, and served for some years in the mid-1920s as its principal and director of studies. Burgin was also an active member of the International Law Association and the Grotius Society and took a particular interest in bankruptcy law, campaigning without success for the adoption of an international bankruptcy convention. In collaboration with his colleague Eric Fletcher -- later Lord Fletcher of Islington -- he published 'The Student's Conflict of Laws' (1928), a textbook based on A. V. Dicey's classic study, which went through three editions. In 1929 he took over as senior partner. 
Alongside these demanding professional commitments, Burgin became increasingly active in politics as a member of the Liberal Party and the League of Nations Union. His political sympathies lay with the former Liberal prime minister, H. H. Asquith, and in November 1921 he stood as Liberal candidate for Hornsey in a by-election on a traditionalist platform of free trade, retrenchment, and fewer armaments. Burgin lost out narrowly to the Conservative Viscount Ednam -- a highly creditable result in a historically Tory constituency -- and fought the seat again in the 1922, 1923, and 1924 general elections, but the hoped-for Liberal breakthrough never came. In 1926 he came third in another by-election in East Ham North. Burgin was finally rewarded for his tenacity when he was adopted for the more winnable seat of Luton, which he captured from the Conservatives in 1929 with a majority of more than 3000. 
As one of fifty-nine Liberal MPs in the 1929 parliament, Burgin tolerated David Lloyd George's leadership and acquiesced in his strategy of keeping the second Labour government in power. In February 1931, however, he played an important role in scuttling the government's 'Trade Disputes Bill' by moving an amendment which confirmed the illegality of a general strike. When the National Government took office in August 1931 to deal with the budget deficit, Burgin followed Sir John Simon into a new Liberal National group which promised to support protection. He explained to Luton Liberals that he still regarded tariffs as 'dangerous expedients', but believed that ministers needed a 'free hand' at a time of national peril ('Manchester Guardian', 26 Sept 1931, 11). Though local tories were wary of Burgin, Conservative Central Office secured him a free run against Labour, and he was comfortably re-elected in both 1931 and 1935. 
As a relatively young and talented Liberal National, Burgin was now well-placed to ascend the ministerial ladder. After ten months as a charity commissioner in 1931-2, he became parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, where he helped Walter Runciman implement the government's tariff policy. Burgin spent much of his time overseeing bilateral trade negotiations, especially those leading up to the 1933 Anglo-Argentine agreement, and managing representations from cotton manufacturers and other affected industries: he also addressed a host of Chamber of Commerce dinners and luncheons. Burgin's five years at the Board of Trade (1932-7) were generally considered successful, though his long-standing acquaintance Raymond Streat worried that he was becoming increasingly vain, unpopular with his officials, and 'notorious for his speeches, which aim at verbal brilliance so painstakingly, that the subject matter is often lost sight of' ('Lancashire and Whitehall', 1.362). 
Burgin finally entered the cabinet in May 1937, when the new prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, appointed him minister of transport in succession to Leslie Hore-Belisha. Hore-Belisha had raised the ministry's profile by launching a major road safety drive, including the introduction of the famous 'Belisha beacons', and taking responsibility for major trunk roads away from local authorities. Burgin was by nature less flamboyant than his predecessor, but he had the advantage of being a keen motorist at a time when car ownership was soaring. In January 1938 he visited Germany to examine the new autobahn network in the company of the Nazi engineer Fritz Todt, and on his return he announced his support for an experimental stretch of motorway between Carnforth and Warrington in Lancashire, though he was unable to secure Treasury funding for the project. Burgin also faced the more immediate task of preparing the road and rail networks for war, and showed himself sympathetic to the railway companies' 'Square Deal' campaign for the deregulation of freight charges. 
Throughout this period Burgin supported Chamberlain's policy of appeasement -- for instance, he backed the prime minister in cabinet in the run-up to Munich -- but he was in no sense central to the government's dealings with Germany. In April 1939, however, Burgin moved into the forefront of political controversy when Chamberlain made him minister of supply, with responsibility for equipping the enlarged army which a continental war would require. In many respects it was a poisoned chalice, not only because the army had been badly neglected in the initial rearmament programme but also because many MPs had hoped that Winston Churchill would be given the post; Harold Nicolson, for instance, thought 'the impression was deplorable' because it demonstrated Chamberlain's continued reliance on 'yes-men' ('Diaries and Letters', 1.399). 
Burgin set to work with the aid of the veteran civil servant Sir Arthur Robinson, but after war broke out he faced growing criticism from Churchill and the service chiefs for deficiencies in munitions production. In discussions of military strategy he was generally a cautious influence, though he did promote an abortive plan to disrupt the Soviet economy by bombing the Caucasian oilfields. Burgin was never popular with the opposition parties, and when the coalition was formed in May 1940 Churchill replaced him with his leading Labour critic, Herbert Morrison, a decision which came as 'a disappointment and a shock' (Churchill and Gilbert, 6.356). Thereafter he represented Luton on the back benches until he retired at the 1945 election. By this stage he was already ailing from cancer, and he died at his home in Aplins Close, Townsend Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 16 August 1945. After a funeral service at Harpenden Methodist church, he was cremated at Golders Green. 
In his own way, Burgin was not only an intelligent but a charismatic man, 'dark, genial, and shrewd' ('The Observer', 6 June 1937, 21), with an easy charm and remarkable linguistic dexterity. He was an enthusiastic mountaineer and cricketer, and in his younger days was considered one of the best athletes in the House of Commons; he was also an active Methodist and a lay preacher. Yet what he possessed in talent he sometimes lacked in dynamism and political purpose, and he was perhaps too reliant on the patronage of Neville Chamberlain and Sir John Simon to emerge as a major figure in his own right. As with Chamberlain and Simon, his earlier achievements came to be overshadowed by his association with appeasement and the military debacle of 1940. 'Cato' cast him as one of the 'guilty men' who had taken Britain to the brink of disaster, and his reputation never recovered.

William Beilby (1740-1819), glass enameller, born on 9 July 1740 in Durham, the fourth of the seven children of William Beilby (1706-1765), a silversmith, and his wife, Mary Bainbridge (died 1778). The elder William Beilby established himself as a silversmith in Durham after his marriage in 1733; in 1759, after years of financial problems, he gave up his business and moved to Gateshead. The younger William was admitted in 1751 as king's scholar at Durham grammar school, where he was noted for his interest in the classics. However, owing to the family's persistent financial misfortune he was sent to Birmingham in the same year to begin an apprenticeship as an enameller. There he appears to have lived with his elder brother Richard and was indentured in 1755 to a John Hezeldine. His acquaintance with glass is likely to have begun at this period, in what was then a centre of the British glass industry. 
William moved to Gateshead in 1760 to join his family, in particular his brother Ralph Beilby ['see below'], who had set up a workshop at Amen Corner, near Newcastle Cathedral. The following years were crucial in William's technical experiments with firing enamels onto glass goblets. These were carried out at the nearby Closegate flint glasshouses and yielded the first results in rather weak white enamels but, from 1761, also in colour. 
The delicately hand-painted glassware of the 1760s shows the development of the artist's skills. In co-operation with Ralph, who had established himself as an expert in heraldry, William produced the masterpieces of his 'heraldic phase', in particular the royal goblets ('c'.1764; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and Philadelphia Museum of Art). While commissions poured in from aristocratic patrons, he must still have experienced a degree of financial hardship, as he advertised as a drawing-master in 1767; his drawing school continued until 1778. At the time the family was resident at the Forth Gardens, Newcastle upon Tyne. 
The young artist Thomas Bewick (1753-1828) joined the Beilby workshop as an apprentice in 1767, and his influence may first be discerned in the pastoral scene on the reverse of the flask for Thomas Brown (1769; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The introduction of landscapes, birds, exotic flora, and so on may be regarded as characteristic of William's later style. However, this flask is also the last-known authenticated and dated work by William Beilby. He continued to produce enamelled glassware throughout the 1770s, yet his output appears to have slowed, partly on account of the devastation caused by the 1771 Tyne flood, and partly as a result of his sister's illness. His departure from Newcastle at the end of the 1770s seems to have been motivated both by the break-up of his family after his mother's death in 1778 and by Bewick's being taken into full partnership at the family firm in 1777. There is sufficient evidence of William Beilby in Battersea over the next few years to substantiate the common view of his having set up as a drawing-master. On 12 October 1785 he married Ellen Purton ('b'. 1765), twenty-five years his junior, the niece of John Falconer, a wealthy City merchant of Scottish descent. About 1788 the couple moved to Fife to live on an estate which Falconer had bought for his niece; nothing is known about their life there. 
William Beilby's subsequent move to Hull is equally obscure, especially given his wife's significant inheritance from her uncle's fortune. In 1814 he is recorded as living in English Street. The question of his artistic activities in the years after Newcastle has been contentious, in particular the possibility of glass made in Scotland. Some watercolours survive in private collections in the Hull area, alongside earlier views of Battersea. The Beilbys appear to have had two sons and a daughter, of whom only William Turton Beilby is recorded in Hull in 1822. William Beilby died at home on 8 October 1819; no tombstone or memorial of him survives in Hull.

Beilby family (per. c.1755-1819), glass enamellers and engravers, originated with William Beilby (1740-1819), glass enameller, born on 9 July 1740 in Durham, the fourth of the seven children of William Beilby (1706-1765), a silversmith, and his wife, Mary Bainbridge (died 1778).

William Beilby died at home on 8 October 1819; no tombstone or memorial of him survives in Hull. 

Ralph Beilby (bap. 1743, d. 1817), engraver and businessman, was baptized on 12 August 1743 at St Margaret's, Durham, the third son of William and Mary Beilby. He was educated at Durham grammar school and was then apprenticed to his father. While he started to engrave in silver, he moved on to copper-engraving and seal-cutting upon the return of his brother Richard from Birmingham. Ralph was the driving force behind the family's move to Gateshead after his father's business folded. He set up Beilby & Co. and moved the business to Amen Corner in Newcastle upon Tyne after the trial for forgery of the well-known engraver Jameson had created a vacancy in the city. In addition to acting as the family's business brain, Ralph Beilby acquired considerable expertise in the fields of heraldry and chivalry, which made him the preferred engraver of the northern aristocracy. 
Ralph's own artistic work flourished through his collaboration with the historian John Brand, which produced the engraving of Thornton's monument plate for Brand's history of Newcastle and a plan of Newcastle in 1788. Yet he is mostly remembered as Thomas Bewick's master after the latter's entry into the Beilby workshop. Their collaboration produced, among other works, 'A General History of Quadrupeds'; however, disagreement over the fourth edition of this work led to the dissolution of the enterprise in January 1798. 
Ralph Beilby's artistic output became less prolific after his marriage on 3 December 1780 to Ellen Hawthorne (died 1833). He set up a new business with James Hawthorne, his brother-in-law, which dealt in the production of watch-glasses and clockwork. Their premises were destroyed by fire in 1806 and subsequently rebuilt, and shortly afterwards Ralph Beilby took early retirement. He remained active as a patron of the arts and was a founder member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne. He died on 4 January 1817 and was buried at St Andrew's, Newcastle. 

Mary Beilby (bap. 1750, d. 1797), glass artist, was baptized on 12 February 1750 at St Nicholas's Church, Durham, the last of the seven children of William and Mary Beilby. She was educated privately at Durham and appears to have joined the family workshop at a very young age. Her contribution is associated principally with William Beilby's work in the 1760s. A considerable number of items have been attributed to her, yet disentangling the Beilby hands is problematic. Many attributions to Mary Beilby seem to be a result of our lack of knowledge about other artists active at the time. Mary's romance with Thomas Bewick after the young artist's entry into the family workshop is related in Bewick's 'Memoir'. Yet nothing came of it, and in 1774 Mary suffered a paralytic stroke from which she does not appear to have recovered. It is unclear whether she followed her brother to Battersea. At any rate, she joined William and his wife at their estate in Fife, where she died in 1797.

Gillow family (per. c.1730-c.1830), cabinet-makers and upholsterers, came to prominence with Richard [ii] Gillow (1733-1811), the son of Robert [i] Gillow (1702/3-1772) ['see below'], the founder of the firm. Gillows's reputation as one of the leading British cabinet-making firms of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was established by contributions from some ten members of the family over three generations. The business was established about 1728; in 1813 probably for both economic and social reasons, the Gillow family sold the firm to three partners, Redmayne, Whiteside, and Ferguson, who retained the name Gillow & Co. Succeeding partnerships such as Waring and Gillows Ltd (founded 1897), Waring and Gillow (1932) Ltd, and other concerns also incorporated the name until the end of the twentieth century. During the eighteenth century the Gillow firm established a reputation for producing quality furniture at moderate prices, made from the best woods, by competent workmen, in elegant but practical styles, which sometimes incorporated ingenious devices. Some of Gillows's designs were based on plates from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century pattern books, while others were provided by Wyatt. However, in some instances Gillows were using designs several years before they appeared in pattern books, for example, shield, on escutcheon back chairs. Gillows produced good, solid, well-made furniture, and were the only eighteenth-century cabinet-makers to establish and maintain a branch in both London (opened 1770) and the provinces. The Gillow Archives (now in the City of Westminster Archives Centre) comprise mainly the Lancaster branch's business records from about 1728 to 1932, and include estimate sketch and memorandum books from 1759 to 1905. Although incomplete, they are the longest and largest cabinet-makers' records to have survived in the world. The Lancaster branch also stamped their name on some of their furniture from about 1789, thereby enabling some of their output to be identified and dated via the firm's estimate sketch books. 
Members of each generation became involved in the day-to-day running of the family business and from an early age represented the firm; waited on customers to take their orders; gained experience in the Oxford Street, London, shop; and became equal partners in the firm. The social status of members of the Gillow family changed with their wealth and influence, from that of successful artisan craftsman in the 1740s to established members of the squirearchy by the early nineteenth century. No clearer illustration of the Gillows' rise in status can be cited than that, whereas Robert [i] Gillow provided furniture for Lord and Lady Gerard from the 1740s, in 1801, his grandson Richard [iii] Gillow married an heiress, Elizabeth Stapleton, the cousin of another Lady Gerard.

Robert [i] Gillow (1702/3-1772), the founder of the firm, was the son of Richard [i] Gillow (died 22 Dec 1717), a yeoman of Great Singleton, Lancashire, and his wife, Alice Swarbrick (died 1721). His father was, like former and subsequent generations of the family, a devout Roman Catholic, and he suffered imprisonment for his faith. Robert was apprenticed in March 1721 to John Robinson, a Lancaster joiner, and after completing his apprenticeship in 1727 or 1728 he became a freeman of Lancaster and set up a cabinet-making business. From about 1731 to 1735 he was in partnership with another Roman Catholic joiner, George Haresnape. He entered the West Indies trade as a merchant in 1741 and the Baltic trade in 1742. Robert [i] Gillow married Agnes Fell (1709-1757), daughter of James Fell of Swarthmore, Ulverston, in 1731. Robert and Agnes Gillow had nine children, of whom only one daughter and three sons survived infancy. Alice, their first child, born in 1731, married Thomas Worswick ('c'.1730-1804), a watchmaker, on 26 April 1756, at the priory church of St Mary, Lancaster. Worswick, who founded one of the first banks in Lancaster, supplied some clocks to fit Gillows cases, and Gillows supplied cases for his clocks. The Worswick family were also devout Roman Catholics from Singleton, and like the Gillows became merchants. Of Robert and Agnes Gillow's three sons two, Richard [ii] Gillow and Robert [ii] Gillow ['see below'], became cabinet-makers. John [i] Gillow ['see 'Gillow, John (1753-1828)], their youngest son, was sent to Douai in 1766 and became president of Ushaw College. In the 1740s Robert [i] Gillow began to make some furniture for the gentry, probably through the patronage of another Lancastrian, William Bradshaw (1700-1775), an eminent London tapestry weaver and upholsterer. In January 1757, Robert [i] Gillow took his eldest son, Richard [ii] Gillow, into equal partnership; and in 1769 he retired leaving his share of the partnership to his second son, Robert [ii] Gillow. Robert [i] Gillow died at Church Street, Lancaster, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Lancaster, on 3 December 1772. He left property in the town to his sons, but his main legacy was a firm foundation for the business on which his sons, nephews, and grandsons subsequently built.

Robert [ii] Gillow (1746/7-1795) was born in Lancaster. He appears to have attended school in the Fylde area of Lancashire, like his younger brother John Gillow. In May 1762 his father paid a small sum to John Calvert for 'Bob's learning' (GA, 344/31, p. 197, 26-5-1762). He probably learned the cabinet-maker's trade from his father and brother. In 1766-7 he became a freeman of Lancaster, and in January 1769 his father left him his equal share in the firm, which became known as Messrs Richard and Robert Gillow. He took equal responsibility for the Lancaster firm's apprentices from March 1770. Robert [ii] Gillow married Jane Shaw (died 1783) by licence on 24 June 1771 at St Mary's Church, Lancaster, and they had a son, Robert [iv] Gillow ['see below'] and a daughter, Jane, in 1775. One of the partners in the London firm, Gillows and Taylor, William Taylor, died in 1775, and in January 1776 Robert [ii] Gillow left Lancaster to take charge of the business in London, assisted by his cousin Thomas Gillow, who had been Taylor's partner. Thomas Gillow also became ill in 1778, and died the following summer. Thus ten years after the London branch was established it was in the hands of the Lancaster brothers. Robert's wife, Jane, also died in London in June 1783. Two years later on 12 September 1785 Robert Gillow, widower, of Oxford Street, married again at Holy Trinity Church, Kendal. His second wife was Mary, widow of William Newby late of Horncop Hall, Kendal. In July 1791 Robert [ii] Gillow made a will in which he mentioned a son, Robert [iv] Gillow, then a minor. His daughter Jane had decided to become a nun in 1791, much to her father's dismay, as he considered she should enjoy the pleasures of life which, as a result of his successful industry, he could give her. Although Robert [ii] Gillow took charge of the London business, he returned to Lancaster regularly, calling on customers on his journey north. He sent orders from London customers to his brother Richard [ii] in Lancaster and obtained services and material unavailable in Lancaster, in addition to advising him about the latest fashions. Robert [ii] Gillow died in Lancaster on 22 September 1795 aged forty-eight. He was buried appropriately by his own firm in a grave in the churchyard of St Mary's, Lancaster, on 26 September. His sister, Sarah, was buried in the same grave in 1801. Their epitaph reads: 'they lived respected and beloved, may our end be like unto them' (Tombstone, St Mary's churchyard).

George [ii] Gillow (1765/6-1822) was the second son of Richard [ii] Gillow. He was born in Lancaster and educated in Lancashire during the 1770s with his elder brother Robert [iii] Gillow, first by William Pennington of Robert Hall, a Roman Catholic institution near Hornby, then by Peter Newby of Eccleston, near Kirkham. Their education included social graces such as learning to dance. George [ii] Gillow became a freeman of Lancaster in 1782-3, and joined his uncle Robert [ii] Gillow as a partner in the London shop restyled Robert and George Gillow & Co. from March 1791. At about this date he married Judith Gildon (died 1843), member of an ancient Dorset and Wiltshire Roman Catholic family. George and Judith had eight daughters. By January 1796 George [ii] Gillow had been joined in London by his younger brother, Richard [iii] Gillow, and their cousin, Robert [iv] Gillow. In 1813 the Gillow family retired from active participation in the cabinet-making business and sold the firm to Redmayne, Whiteside, and Ferguson. The agreement was that the new partners should purchase the firm in instalments, the final instalment being due in 1821, and that the proceeds were to be divided equally between the three remaining partners (the sons of Richard [ii] Gillow). George [ii] Gillow amused himself by forming a large collection of European paintings and drawings, 'at great expense', which included a 'grand gallery picture by P. Veronese' and other works by Masaccio, Bellini, Caravaggio, and Leonardo da Vinci, described in Christies sale catalogue of April 1824. George [ii] Gillow would not have had long to enjoy his share, since he died at Hammersmith on 1 December 1822, aged fifty-six, leaving his eight daughters as his coheirs. Judith, his wife, died on 2 March 1843.

Richard [iii] Gillow (1772-1849) was born on 8 March 1772, the third and youngest son of Richard [ii] Gillow. He married Elizabeth Stapleton (1780-1848) on 31 May 1801 at St Mary's Church, Marylebone, Middlesex. Elizabeth was the daughter and eventual heir of a Preston doctor, Charles Stapleton, younger son of Nicholas Stapleton of Carlton Hall, Yorkshire, heir to the barony of Beaumont, subsequently restored. Richard and Elizabeth had thirteen children, one of whose baptismal sponsors was Elizabeth's cousin Lady Gerard, whose forebears had patronized Richard [iii] Gillow's grandfather, Robert [i] Gillow, the founder of the firm during the 1740s. In three generations, therefore, the Gillow family had risen in status from serving the gentry as tradesmen to claiming kinship with them by marriage. Richard [iii] Gillow was described as a 'cabinetmaker and upholsterer' in 1796-7 when he became a Lancaster freeman (Freemen rolls, 132). He was an active partner in the Oxford Street shop. In May 1800 Richard [iii] Gillow of London patented an expanding dining table which was a great success and large numbers were manufactured by the firm. He lived in London for many years at Little Holland House, Campden Hill, Kensington, where many of his children were born, while others were born at Ellel Grange, near Lancaster, a property owned by one of his Worswick cousins. In February 1822 Worswick's Bank was declared insolvent; and in December 1823 both Leighton Hall and Ellel Grange were offered for sale by order of the high court of chancery. Leighton Hall was purchased by Richard [iii] Gillow, and after some renovations in April 1824, the family moved their furniture from Ellel Grange to Leighton. From 1825 'Richard Gillow Esq.' purchased more furniture from the new partners in their old family firm (GA 344/102, p. 3457, 25-11-1825). Elizabeth Stapleton died on 18 November 1848, and Richard [iii] Gillow died at Leighton on 16 December 1849; they were both interred in the family mausoleum at Leighton Hall. Richard Thomas Gillow (1806-1905), eldest son of Richard and Elizabeth, is said to have been the last family member to be associated with the firm, but he, and his father, retired from trade in 1830.

Robert [iii] Gillow (1764-1838) was born on 9 October 1764, the eldest son of Richard [ii] Gillow (1733-1811), and the brother of George [ii] and Richard [iii] Gillow who also became cabinet-makers. During the 1770s Robert [iii] Gillow and George [ii] were educated at Roman Catholic boarding-schools, by Mr Pennington of Robert Hall, near Hornby, then by Mr Peter Newby of Eccleston, who was probably a kinsman. In 1781 his father paid the expenses of sending Robert [iii] to London; by December 1786 Robert was acting as a commercial traveller for the firm, and the following year he became a freeman of Lancaster when he was described as an 'upholsterer' (Freemen rolls, 130). He married Anne Parker (1764-1841), daughter and heir of Edward Parker, esquire, at Preston in 1797. Robert [iii] and Anne Gillow had four daughters, all coheirs who married into the gentry, his two eldest daughters in the private chapel at Clifton Hill, Forton, Lancashire. Robert [iii] Gillow and his family moved to the Clifton Hill estate after December 1817 and before October 1822, and he died there on 11 July 1838, aged seventy-five. He was a generous patron of the Roman Catholic church. He also amassed a library of about 700 volumes and was in possession of the residue of his late brother George's collection of paintings and drawings which had remained unsold after Christies auction of April 1824. In his will he mentioned his furniture, plate, linen, pictures, and books, which -- apart from specific items bequeathed to his wife and daughters -- were all to be auctioned on his wife's death.

Hutt, (George) Allen (1901-1973), journalist and political activist, was born at 57 Harvist Road, Willesden, London, on 20 September 1901, the son of Edwin George Wellington Hutt, a commercial clerk and later general manager in the paper industry, and his wife, Marion de Witt, a headmistress. He was educated at Kilburn grammar school and at Downing College, Cambridge, where he gained a first in the history tripos in 1923. 
By this time Hutt was a committed Marxist. In its latter stages he was 'vehemently' opposed to the First World War, and at Cambridge he was active in the university socialist society, eventually becoming the national secretary of the communist-dominated University Socialist Federation. Briefly, in 1920-21, he was a member of the Independent Labour Party, but it was his adhesion to the Communist Party in 1922 that set the course for the rest of his political life. 
Equally fateful in professional terms was Hutt's recruitment to the 'Daily Herald', then a congenial home for communists, in 1923. Through a paternal lineage of master printers, Hutt took pride in a family involvement in the publishing industry dating from the seventeenth century. Combining political commitment with exacting professional standards, he was a priceless asset to a left-wing press disproportionately endowed with only the first of these. In addition to the 'Herald', he worked on or for the communist 'Workers' Weekly'; the Soviet news agency TASS; Palme Dutt's 'Labour Monthly', which he briefly claimed to edit 'in fact if not in name'; and 'Trade Union Unity', a short-lived venture of TUC 'lefts' like A. A. Purcell for which Hutt functioned as a self-designated 'factotum' (Hutt to Karl August, 29 Dec 1925, Hutt papers, People's History Museum, Manchester). These trade union contacts were reflected in his first book 'Communism and Coal' (1928), a collaboration with Arthur Horner, and a voluminous correspondence with the Fife miners' leader David Proudfoot. 
After a spell at the International Lenin School and two years as chief sub-editor at the newly launched 'Daily Worker' (1930-32), Hutt produced a series of books on British working-class politics, most of them developing historical narratives which seemingly culminated inexorably in the current policy of the Communist Party. Perhaps the best of them, however, was 'The Condition of the Working Class in Britain' (1933), an early example of the decade's committed documentary style, revealing a flair for the investigative side of journalism as well as its technical aspects. 
Nevertheless, it was to the latter that Hutt owed a reputation extending well beyond the left. In 1936 he joined the co-operative-owned 'Reynolds News' as chief assistant to the editor with a special brief for the paper's redesign. Six years later he rejoined the 'Daily Worker', then being relaunched after a temporary wartime ban. These were halcyon days for British communists, and much of their optimism for the post-war world was focused on the prospect of the 'new' 'Daily Worker' that, from its own distinct perspective, would match the best that Fleet Street had to offer. Hutt as chief sub-editor made perhaps the outstanding contribution to such a goal, turning 'a squad of unqualified and in some cases poorly qualified people into journalists' (MacEwen, 109). Famously rude -- the paper's editor, William Rust, likened him to 'a combination of a dragon and a porcupine' -- he nevertheless earned the tremendous respect of both his colleagues and his profession. While the 'Worker''s circulation figures never matched expectations, and from the late 1940s declined steadily, the paper won prestigious awards for newspaper design, and Hutt himself gained the rare distinction of being named a royal designer for industry. His book 'Newspaper Design' (1960), a summation of his technical experience, cemented the high professional regard in which he was held. 
For a quarter of a century from 1946 Hutt also sat on the executive of the National Union of Journalists and edited its monthly paper 'The Journalist'. Here too he achieved high honour when in 1967 he was made the union's president. If he had a great frustration, it was that on the 'Daily Worker' the positions of editor and assistant editor were the preserve of leading communist functionaries, politically dependable but often unpractised in journalism. When these posts were filled in this fashion on Rust's untimely death in 1949, Hutt was driven by the 'most bitter disappointment and humiliation' to consider his resignation (draft statement, 14 Feb 1949, Hutt papers, People's History Museum, Manchester). Through finesse or party discipline he was persuaded to change his mind, and he remained with the paper until his retirement in 1966. That same year, to his fervent dismay and contempt, the paper changed its name to the 'Morning Star'. 
Both the issue and the reaction were typical. A disciplined communist not known to have had any major disagreements with the party line, Hutt was nevertheless fiercely independent on the matters which he knew best. He married three times, in each case to an active communist, and left children by both his first marriage, to Norma, and his second, to Sheena. He died of cancer at his home, 8 Regent's Park Terrace, Camden, London, on 10 August 1973; his third wife, Avis, a nurse, survived him.

Jephcott, (Agnes) Pearl (1900-1980), social researcher, was born on 1 May 1900 at Church Street, Alcester, Warwickshire, the youngest of the four children of Edward Arthur Jephcott, auctioneer, and his wife, Agnes Amelia, 'nee' Boobbyer. She attended Alcester grammar school and then the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where in 1922 she graduated BA in history. She was awarded an MA degree by publication in 1946. After trying various careers (teaching, secretarial work, and fund-raising for Dr Barnardo's homes) Jephcott turned to the girls' club movement and in 1927 was appointed as the organizing secretary of the Birmingham Union of Girls' Clubs. She was a highly effective organizer and in 1935 was appointed as a temporary county organizer for the National Association of Girls' Clubs to develop youth work in the 'special areas' of high unemployment in co. Durham. 
The war saw Jephcott moving to London as a national organizer for the association, working on developing service cadet companies, to provide opportunities for training and voluntary service for girls. Later she became publications secretary and editor of the association's newsletter, 'Club News'. She was then granted leave of absence to complete her first major publication, 'Girls Growing Up' (1942). This was an investigation into the home conditions, work, leisure, and personal relationships of 153 English and Welsh fourteen- to eighteen-year-olds. The following year her textbook for club leaders, 'Clubs for Girls' (1943), was published. 'Girls Growing Up' was greeted enthusiastically by professionals and the general public alike, and for the remainder of her life Jephcott pursued a career in social research. The award of a Barnett fellowship enabled her to follow up the girls in her first study, and 'Rising Twenty' was published in 1948. The two studies indicate the concerns and style of much of Jephcott's subsequent research. All presented vivid, detailed, and at times passionate pictures of little researched aspects of the lives of working-class people, particularly of girls and young women. They involved detailed ethnographic research using participant observation, interviews, and autobiographical accounts, and offered practical recommendations to improve the quality of life of their subjects. 
Jephcott worked briefly for Political and Economic Planning, co-authoring three of its broadsheets, and for the northern industrial group, before joining (in 1950) the University of Nottingham, where she managed two projects. The first examined the social origins of delinquency, and the second investigated the membership of youth organizations. The latter resulted in the publication of 'Some Young People' (1954). In 1954 she was appointed as a senior research assistant at the London School of Economics (LSE) to work in Richard Titmuss's social administration department with Nancy Seear and John Smith, investigating the impact of married women in employment at the large Peek Frean's factory in Bermondsey. While her colleagues undertook the industrial side of the study, Jephcott investigated domestic conditions. The research involved sustained contact with the local community, and characteristically Jephcott lived in, and participated fully in the life of, the local area. The project had a troubled passage, but in 1962 'Married Women Working' was published. It joined the growing body of research that tempered popular hysteria against working wives and mothers. Her contributions while at the LSE went beyond her sociological research work. Her extensive youth work experience prompted invitations to sit on two government committees of inquiry: in 1957-8 she was a member of the Central Advisory Council for Education (England) and a contributor to its report, '15-18' (1959-60), and in 1958 she joined the Albermarle committee, which laid the foundations for the modern youth service in England and Wales. In addition, she undertook two commissions for the Home Office reporting on the needs of young people in the coastal areas of British Guiana and in the West Indies. 
By the early 1960s Jephcott was keen to pursue her own research interests and turned again to the subjects of her early research, who by then were women in their twenties and thirties. She completed a third research project on the women, 'The uncertain years', but the work was never published. After leaving the LSE reluctantly, her next project was the North Kensington family study, in which she investigated housing conditions and race relations in London's Notting Hill area. Her forthright report, 'A Troubled Area: Notes on Notting Hill' (1964), highlighted how scarce were the resources and support available to 'some of the most troubled of London's citizens'. She was next invited to Glasgow University to study the leisure interests of young people in Scotland. The fruits of her research were published in 1967 as 'Time of One's Own'; by this time she had moved to her next project: studying high-rise living in two Glasgow tower blocks. When published as 'Homes in High Flats' (1971), the work confirmed popular misgivings about multi-storey homes, especially that they were 'nae use for the bairns'. In 1970 she left Glasgow, but this was only semi-retirement. She travelled to Australia and continued to research and write, for example undertaking a study for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) on the situation of children and youth in Hong Kong. In 1973 she gained funding for a two-year, half-time post to research the needs of families living in high-rise flats in Birmingham, and persuaded the local authority to let her live in a council flat. The work resulted in the appointment of a social development fieldworker to work with young families in high flats. 
All Jephcott's work was suffused with concern for humanity and particularly for working-class people. From her early work as a youth leader, through her various research posts, she explored their lives with enormous sympathy and no sentimentality. On spring bank holiday 1980 she suffered a stroke. She died, unmarried, at the War Memorial Hospital, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, on 9 November 1980. After her funeral service at St Mary's Church, Oxford, on 13 November she was cremated in Oxford.

Kilner, Dorothy (1755-1836), children's writer, was born on 17 February 1755, probably at Woodford, Essex, the youngest among the five children of Thomas Kilner (1719-1804), public servant and landowner, and his wife, Frances, 'nee' Ayscough (1718-1768). Thomas moved in 1759 to Maryland Point, then a rural Essex hamlet, now in London. 
On the death of Frances Kilner, Dorothy's sister Eliza (1747-1817) became her 'Mother, Sister, friend' (private information). Dorothy 'possessed unusual strength of mind and much originality of character' (ibid.). By the 1770s Dorothy was exchanging verse epistles on religious, moral, and personal subjects with her childhood friend Mary Ann Maze [
Dorothy shared the objections of other contemporary women writers to fantasy and to romances of gallantry, love, and marriage -- a state she could afford to forgo from choice, preferring 'darling liberty'. She never married. However, it was as a devoted aunt that she began writing herself and, under an alias, she sought advice about publication from the educationist Sarah Trimmer, who recommended her to the publisher John Marshall, later a family friend. In the decade from 1779 Dorothy produced over a dozen works, published at first anonymously, then as M. P. (Maryland Point), and finally as Mary Pelham. Her 'Dialogues and Letters on Morality, Economy and Politeness' (1783?) and 'Dialogues on the first principles of religion' ('c'.1787) were didactic and pious works for children. Her 'Little Stories for Little Folks', aimed at the very young, had short episodes and short words. 
Mary Ann had by this time produced some half-dozen books, also published by Marshall, under the initials S. S. (Spittal Square). In 'The Adventures of a Pincushion' ('c'.1780), a pincushion made by two girls, Martha and Charlotte Airy, is accidentally taken by a visitor. It is variously kept and lost by a number of characters, and its 'adventures' highlight the different virtues and vices of those with whom it comes in contact. Mary Ann wanted her readers to 'avoid the failings, and practise those virtues or accomplishments, which render the contrary examples more worthy of imitation' ('The Adventures of a Pincushion', 13). 
Mary Ann's talking pincushion may have influenced Dorothy's best-known book, 'Life and Perambulation of a Mouse' ('c'.1790), in which a visitor to a country house, charged with providing an original story for a winter gathering, relates the life story of a mouse called Nimble. It was the first children's book to give its animal characters distinct personalities, but Dorothy made a rational disclaimer for her talking mouse in a prefix to her tale: 'I must beg leave to assure my readers, that, in 'earnest', I never heard a Mouse speak in all my life; and only wrote the following narrative as being far more entertaining, and not less instructive than my own life would have been' ('Life and Perambulation of a Mouse', xii). Dorothy's other books included 'The Rochfords, or, The Friendly Counsellor' ('c'.1800), 'The village school, or, A collection of entertaining histories for the instruction and amusement of all good children' ('c'.1795), 'First Going to School, or, The Story of Tom Brown, and his Sisters' (1806), and 'Edward the Orphan' (1824). All took the opportunity to show the rewards of goodness and honesty and the punishments of selfishness and misconduct. Mary Ann's books, such as 'Jemima Placid, or, The Advantages of a Good-Nature' ('c'.1783), 'William Sedley, or, The Evil Day Deferred' ('c'.1783), 'The Happy Family, or, Memoirs of Mr and Mrs Norton' ('c'.1790), did likewise. 'Memoirs of a Peg-Top' ('c'.1794) was written 'to promote the cause of virtue... with incidents of an amusing nature' (p. vi). 
A decline in the silk trade due to a fashion-switch to muslins, plus his wife's ill health, led Tom to sell his business in 1787 and to live off his properties. The family took lodgings at Margate, where the girls attended a day school. About 1789, 'at his father's earnest desire' (private information), Tom and his family moved back to share the Maryland Point house with his father and sisters. A son, George, who was somewhat indulged, was born in 1791. From then on Mary Ann Kilner's life was overshadowed by bereavements and ill health. Her father James Maze died in 1794; her devoted brother James (Gig; he called her Pig) died in 1804, as did Thomas Kilner, Dorothy's father. The year 1812 saw the death of Mary Ann's husband and the birth of her first grandchild, Maria, to young George Kilner, who had set up as a miller in Suffolk where his father had property, and married Maria Garrett of Woodbridge in 1811, before he could afford to support a family. He received financial help from his relatives (notably Dorothy) after he suffered a breakdown in physical health. Mary Ann's eldest child, also Mary Ann, died while visiting George in 1816. In 1817 a fall and resulting back injury made her a chronic invalid, and she was nursed by her daughter Frances. Mary Ann Kilner died on 1 December 1831 and was buried on 8 December at All Saints', West Ham, Essex. 
After the death of her sister Eliza in 1817, Dorothy's mind became impaired in her last years. Her eccentricities and trenchant outspokenness intimidated even her beloved nephew George. Devotedly nursed by her niece Frances and great-niece Maria, she died on 5 February 1836 and was buried at All Saints', West Ham. 
Years later a trunk was found in the loft at Maryland Point. Left there by Dorothy and Mary Ann and labelled 'For Posterity', it contained copies of their books, which had been in print over forty years, some published in Ireland and the USA. The name Pelham was appropriated by other writers, notably the flamboyant Richard Phillips, and Beatrix Potter may have derived inspiration from 'Life and Perambulation of a Mouse' through Charlotte M. Yonge's 'A Storehouse of Stories', in which Dorothy Kilner's tale was reprinted in 1870. The books, prized by collectors for their attractive bindings and illustrations rather than by juvenile readers, still offer, among the exhortations, sympathetic descriptions of children's behaviour and feelings, and lively recreations of their preferred toys and occupations -- and not always those approved by their elders.

King, John (c.1753-1823), moneylender and radical, was born in London, the son of Moses Rey, a Jewish street trader of Gibraltarian or north African origin; he was named Jacob. He was educated at the charity school of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews and then, in 1771, apprenticed by the school to a Jewish merchant house in the City of London. After leaving school he Anglicized his name to John King; later, when famous, he was known as Jew King. After completing his apprenticeship he served in an attorney's office for a short period; soon thereafter he ventured forth as a moneylender, a trade at which he was an almost immediate success, as witnessed by the fact that in 1775 he donated $100 to the charity school, in gratitude for his education, and by his marriage the following year to Sara, the daughter of Benjamin Nunes Lara, a City merchant. Their children included the writers Sophia Fortnum and Charlotte Byrne, as well as Charles King, who later took over his father's business interests. 
Although usually described as a moneylender King was, more precisely, a money broker -- a middleman who negotiated loans with funds supplied by persons who desired a high return on their money but wished to avoid the notoriety associated with moneylending. His clients included noble gamblers and profligates (Lord Byron among them) as well as more humble persons unable to live within their means. In 1806 he raised money for the millenarian prophetess Joanna Southcott, who, it was revealed in court proceedings the following year, had no intention of repaying him since she expected the millennium to arrive first. In the pursuit of well-born clients King entertained lavishly and frequently. In cultivating these contacts his long-term liaison with Jane Isabella Butler, the widowed countess of Lanesborough (1737-1828), was of great assistance. They met in 1783 and a year later King divorced his wife before a rabbinical court in Leghorn, Italy, where he had fled to escape imprisonment. The couple married on 4 January 1790 at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury. In addition to his loan activities, to which there was often a criminal dimension, King was linked to various other frauds and swindles and was frequently before the courts. From 1805 to 1811, for example, he headed a group of former Jacobins who extorted money from members of the royal family, the prime minister, government officials, and other notables. 
While pursuing these unsavoury activities King also took part in the anti-ministerial reform agitation of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Indeed he was one of the first Jews anywhere in Europe to participate in politics in pursuit of goals unrelated to matters of Jewish status. As a youth he met and was influenced by Tom Paine, and from the early 1780s (except for a brief period in the 1790s) championed reform causes. In 1783 he published an indictment of ministerial policy, 'Thoughts on the difficulties and distresses in which the peace of 1783 has involved the people of England'. In the 1790s he was close to leaders of the London Corresponding Society and contributed to their defence when they were tried for high treason in 1794. He edited or wrote for several radical newspapers, including 'The Argus' and the 'British Guardian', and participated in most of the radical campaigns of 1802-15, especially the 1808-9 attack on the duke of York for allowing his mistress, Mary Anne Clarke, to sell military preferments. 
For most of his adult life King was alienated from Judaism, even claiming in court in 1795 that he had been a member of the Church of England all his adult life. But there is no evidence that he converted to Christianity, even though he lived almost exclusively among Christians and not Jews. Then in the late 1790s he reversed course and began to re-embrace his Jewish identity, eventually becoming a spirited defender of his ancestral faith. He capped his return to Judaism with the publication, in 1817, of a new edition of David Levi's apologia 'Dissertations on the Prophecies of the Old Testament', which was first published between 1793 and 1800; in his introduction King offered a surprisingly traditional defence of rabbinic Judaism. In August 1823 he died and was buried in Florence, where he and Lady Lanesborough had lived since about 1817.

Emin, Emin Joseph (1726-1809), army officer in the East India Company and Armenian nationalist, was born in Hamadan, Persia, the son of Hovsep 
(also known as Joseph; died 1777)
, merchant. During Emin's youth internecine wars killed his mother (in 1734) and next youngest brother, scattering his family. about 1735 Hovsep emigrated with a new wife, Thekghi (died 1758), to Calcutta; Emin and his paternal grandfather, Michael, joined them in 1745. Emin studied under a Mr Parrent at the English School in the Old Court-House. Rejecting a merchant's life, Emin worked his passage to England on the East India Company ship 'Walpole' (14 February to 14 September 1751). 
In London the Armenian Stephanus Coggigian of the London Royal Exchange employed Emin to represent Armenian interests at the king's bench and advanced Emin money for tuition at Mr Middleton's Academy for Boys in Bishopsgate. When Stephanus converted to Roman Catholicism, he demanded repayment from Emin, who left school in debt. 
For three years Emin laboured for a bricklayer in Drury Lane, signed (then broke) indentures for a West India plantation, and briefly rejoined Middleton's academy as a servant-student until Middleton went bankrupt. Destitute, Emin served Mr Roberts in the City as grocer's porter and then Mr Webster in Cheapside as a law clerk. Emin also briefly studied military drill with Colonel Dingley. In 1755, while strolling in St James's Park, Emin met Edmund Burke, who guided Emin's education, employed him as a copyist, and presented him with maps of Armenia. That year Emin also gained the patronage of the duke of Northumberland, who elicited his story of his militant Armenian nationalist ambitions and encouraged him to compose an autobiographical epistle, which he then circulated among 300 members of the British elite. William, duke of Cumberland, subsequently sponsored him as a cadet officer in the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he studied mathematics and fortification under John Muller. He also received patronage and exchanged correspondence with, among others, the literary patron Elizabeth Montagu, the physician Messenger Monsey, Amelia, Lady Yarmouth, George, Lord Lyttelton, and William Pitt the elder. 
After thirteen months at Woolwich Emin campaigned (from May 1757) on the continent as a gentleman officer attached to the British and Prussian armies during the Seven Years' War, including at the battle of Hastenbeck (26 July 1757). He briefly accompanied the Prussian army under Frederick the Great against Russia, but his English patrons withdrew him on the eve of the battle of Zorndorf (25 August 1758). He joined the British St Malo raid (June 1758). Between 1759 and 1761 he travelled to rouse Armenians living under Ottoman rule. After a brief return to England he went via Russia to serve Heraclius II, prince of Georgia. For eight years he used his European-style military training, limited Russian support, and financial subsidies from Lord Northumberland in vain attempts to achieve Armenian liberation from the Turkish and Persian empires. He returned from these futile guerrilla actions to Calcutta in 1770. 
Despite his impressive credentials, the East India Company's Bengal army classed Emin as non-British, which barred him from the regular officers' corps. Instead the company appointed him (27 October 1770) only as the most junior brevet ensign (risaldar) of the first troop of Turksowars (irregular cavalry) in the 1st brigade, at Rs 300 (including 'batta', or extra pay) per month. Not even the dukes of Northumberland and Cumberland could arrange his nationalization or full commission from London. He served two frustrating years in the Bengal army, garrisoned at Dinapore, advancing (1771-2) under General Sir Robert Barker to the assistance of Nawab Shuja ud-Daula of Oudh, then returning via Benares to Calcutta. 
When Governor-General Warren Hastings disbanded the Bengal army's irregular cavalry in 1772, Emin perforce retired to half pay. Seeking advancement of the Armenian cause, he took leave and journeyed via Madras and Bombay. Settling in Jolfa, Persia, in 1776, he married Thangoom Khatoon (1748-1843), daughter of Aga David. Emin subsequently returned to India in 1782, taking his eldest son, Arshak (1777-1792), but leaving behind in Persia for a decade his wife, second son, Joseph (1781-1868), and two daughters, Begoom ('b'. 1778/9) and Ismeen (1780/82-1831). Resettling in Calcutta in 1784, Emin managed a posting in 1786 to the Bengal army's 3rd European Invalid regiment. Owing to his irregular status, he had repeatedly to petition the company for his back pay and monthly pension of Rs 91, granted only in February 1797. Emin's 640-page memoir 'Life and Adventures of Joseph Emin, an Armenian, Written in English by himself' was published in London in 1792. Thereafter he lived among the struggling Armenian community in Bengal, dying in Calcutta on 2 August 1809.

Morley, Ebenezer Cobb (1831-1924), lawyer, sportsman, and sports administrator, was born at Hull, Yorkshire, on 16 August 1831, the son (there were also three daughters) of Ebenezer Morley, Congregational minister, and his wife, Hannah Cobb, who had been married at St Mary's, Kingston upon Hull, five years earlier. Morley was baptized at his father's Holborn Street Chapel in Hull on 11 September 1831. He became an articled clerk to a solicitor and qualified in law in 1854. 
From 1858 Morley lived in Barnes, Surrey, and he practised as a solicitor at various addresses in London, including 10 King's Bench Walk and 53 Gresham House, Old Broad Street, until 1921. He was always ready to give free legal advice to the poor and he also supported working men's clubs. He was a justice of the peace and he represented Barnes on Surrey county council between 1903 and 1919, attending meetings of the music and dancing houses, racecourses and explosives licensing committee, and various education committees. He was also a conservator of Barnes Common. On 14 October 1869 he married Frances (1837/8-1911), daughter of Alexander Masters Bidgood, woollen merchant. They had no children. 
Morley was often referred to as 'the grand old sportsman of Barnes', and sport, in several forms, was his abiding interest. He was an accomplished oarsman and, in 1864, rowed in the London Rowing Club's eight for the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley. He was secretary of the London Rowing Club for many years and also founder and secretary (1862-80) of the Barnes and Mortlake regatta. He also helped to organize a big annual athletics meeting on the day of the university boat race. He kept a pack (twelve couples) of foot beagles, and for nearly fifty years he hunted with the Surrey union foxhounds and, for twenty years, the Devon and Somerset staghounds. He also built and equipped a small gymnasium -- near his Thames-side home, 26 The Terrace, Barnes, Surrey -- which was used by footballers and oarsmen. 
Football, however, was the sport on which Morley made his biggest mark. He played the game on Barnes Common before he formed the Barnes football club in 1862, which was based at the Limes Field at Mortlake. There were regular disputes about the way the game was played: Should the ball be handled as well as kicked? Should 'hacking' an opponent be permitted? Morley, a natural and willing organizer, wrote to 'Bell's Life' suggesting that football have set rules in the way that cricket had. This led to the meeting of representatives of a dozen London and suburban clubs at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London, on 26 October 1863, at which the Football Association of England (FA) was formed. Morley was a clever and effective player himself and he scored the first goal in the first representative match (London versus Sheffield, 31 March 1866). 
Morley himself drafted the FA's first set of playing laws for football, which, hitherto, had been a violent thing of the streets and fields or a collective exercise, with many confusing variations, of the public schools. Several meetings were held before there was agreement, and 'hacking' was forbidden. The FA's early influence was confined largely to the London area, but its motives and ambitions were honourably based and its authority grew steadily. Morley's strong handwriting can be seen in the first minute book which is still in the possession of the FA. Morley was secretary of the FA for three years (1863-6), and as its second president (1867-74) he was the first man to present the FA cup in 1872. He was a principal guest at the FA's golden jubilee dinner in 1913. His wife having predeceased him, Morley died of pneumonia at his Barnes home on 20 November 1924 -- eighteen months after the opening of Wembley stadium -- at the age of ninety-three. He was buried in Barnes old cemetery five days later. 
As the first secretary of the first organized football body, Morley may be described as the father of the world's most popular game. Morley and the FA gave the game shape and direction which led, a decade after the FA's foundation, to the birth of tournament and international football.

L'Estrange, Sir Hamon (1583-1654), politician, was the third but eldest surviving son of Sir Nicholas L'Estrange (died 1592) and his wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Bell of Beaupre Hall, Outwell, Norfolk. Of ancient Norfolk lineage, the L'Estrange family of Hunstanton can be traced back to the eleventh century. The family fortune was made by L'Estrange's great-great-grandfather, Thomas, who was an esquire of the body to Henry VIII and accompanied him to the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. L'Estrange inherited Hunstanton as a minor in 1592, and in 1601 was at Queens' College, Cambridge. His guardian, Sir John Peyton, arranged his marriage the next year, on 8 June, to Alice Stubbe (1585-1656) ['see 'L'Estrange, Alice], the daughter of Richard Stubbe (Peyton's lawyer) and his wife, Anne, the widow of L'Estrange's great-uncle, Sir John L'Estrange. Peyton received $1000 from Stubbe for his part in the transaction. L'Estrange was still of nonage so, while he was released from his wardship, it was necessary for his estates to be held in trust -- a role undertaken by two leading members of the Norfolk gentry, Sir Henry Hobart and Thomas Oxburgh. 
As a senior gentry figure in the county L'Estrange played a prominent role in its affairs throughout his life. He was pricked as sheriff in 1608 and through the patronage of Hobart he was appointed a deputy lieutenant in 1625. He also served twice as knight of the shire for Norfolk (1614 and 1621) and in 1625 he exploited his local prominence to gain a seat at Castle Rising. His role in the 1614 election bears close scrutiny as not only did he ally himself with Sir Henry Bedingfield, a prominent Catholic, but he and Bedingfield in collaboration with his cousin, Sir James Calthorpe, the sheriff, adjourned the election at the last moment from Norwich to Swaffham. This effectively foiled the plans of Sir Henry Rich to gain a seat. Rich waited in Norwich with a group of freeholders and the backing of Thomas, earl of Suffolk, but could not reach Swaffham in time to influence the election. 
L'Estrange played little role in the 1614 parliament, waiting until the last day to make his maiden speech in the house when he called for the Commons to vote on whether to send a reply to James's letter dissolving the parliament. He travelled to the 1621 parliament in the company of his wife and they took rooms with a Mr Haywood in Westminster at $1 10's'. per week. Through L'Estrange's meticulous accounts it is clear that this was the only time that Alice L'Estrange visited London and while her husband attended the house she bought a variety of goods for the family and Hunstanton Hall. During the parliament L'Estrange called stridently for the punishment of Sir Giles Mompesson, the notorious monopolist: 'Mompesson said he was justice 'par excellentium'. I may say 'per pestilentiam', for he hath plagued the country' (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 2.168) and he later moved that he be expelled from the Commons. He also introduced a bill concerning salt marshes, which, if enacted, would have granted title to landowners to hold and use land down to the low water mark. The bill proceeded no further than the first reading stage, probably because it overturned the well-established common-law maxim that the dividing line between county and admiralty jurisdiction was the edge of the water. In 1625 L'Estrange attended the London sitting of parliament but along with many of his fellow MPs he absented himself from the Oxford sitting. 
L'Estrange continued to play a prominent role in Norfolk affairs during the 1630s. A cultured and articulate man, he avidly purchased books to add to his library and maintained an interest in music and hawking. However, the civil war shattered his peaceful existence and along with his sons, Sir Nicholas L'Estrange (bap. 1604, d. 1655), Hamon L'Estrange (1605-1660), and Roger L'Estrange (1616-1704), he supported the king. He was disarmed in December 1642 and when King's Lynn declared for Charles I in August 1643 he was named as governor of the town. Besieged by the earl of Manchester, King's Lynn was forced to surrender on 16 September. Despite heavy financial losses L'Estrange managed to escape immediate sequestration of his estates by the terms of surrender, but he could not hide for ever and Hunstanton was eventually sequestered in 1649. Although in his last years he was badly affected by gout, he patronized the foremost English viol composer, John Jenkins, and brought him to reside with the family at Hunstanton Hall. L'Estrange died there on 31 May 1654 and was buried in Hunstanton church where his gravestone reads: '
in Heaven at home, o blessed change! 

Who while I was on earth, was Strange! 
(Blomefield, 10.326)'

Linklater, Eric Robert Russell (1899-1974), writer, was born on 8 March 1899 at Penarth, Glamorgan, the only son and elder child of Robert Baikie Linklater (1865-1916), master mariner, of Dounby, Orkney, and his wife, (Mary) Elizabeth ('c'.1867-1957), daughter of James Young, master mariner. Though herself no Scot, Elizabeth Linklater was passionately Scottish and Orcadian in her loyalties. She insisted on maintaining a holiday house in Orkney, where the Linklaters had lived for many generations, and once it became possible she transferred the family home from Cardiff to Aberdeen. Eric Linklater, who would also see himself as both Scottish and Orcadian, attended Aberdeen grammar school from 1913 to 1916. 
In 1914 Linklater enlisted in a territorial battalion of the Gordon Highlanders, but when war broke out he was rejected for service because of his poor eyesight. In 1917, however, by which time his father had died in Ceylon after an engagement with a German U-boat, he contrived to get himself accepted by the army and then posted to France. He served with the Black Watch in late 1917 and early 1918, until wounded in the course of the German spring offensive. Ironically, given the basis of his previous rejection, he became a sniper. In spite of grudgingly admitting to terror of the mud, the bullying, and the sudden slaughter of the western front, he was exalted. The war was for him a deep and intense emotional experience, as he recorded in 'Fanfare for a Tin Hat' (1970): 'My few weeks as a sniper gave my life an excitement, an intensity which I have never known since. I have, on the whole, had a happy life, and I have known much pleasure. But in my nineteenth year I lived at a high pitch of purpose, a continuous physical and mental alertness, that has never again suffused my brain and body. (Linklater, 'Fanfare', 67)' His head wound was near fatal; he was saved only by the legendary tin hat.From 1918 to 1925 Linklater was a student at Aberdeen University, first, unsuccessfully, in medicine, a course of study which he had begun in 1916 and which provided material for his first novel, 'White Maa's Saga' (1929). This was only the first example of his use of his own life experience as material for fiction. He subsequently studied English, and graduated MA in 1925, with first-class honours, being awarded the Seafield medal, the Minto memorial prize, and the Senatus prize in English. The unforgotten intensity of the eighteen-year-old, however, would leave the mature writer liable to search for novelty, change, and action, and ensured that travel would be a central feature of Linklater's life and writing. He spent the years 1925 to 1927 in Bombay, as an assistant editor of the 'Times of India'. There followed a year in Aberdeen (1927-8) as assistant to the professor of English, and two years (1928-30) in the USA as a Commonwealth fellow, based first at Cornell and then at Berkeley. 
Linklater's literary career proper began in 1929, and his output was both varied and prolific. He published twenty-three novels, three volumes of short stories, two children's books, two books of verse, ten plays (including several 'conversations' for radio during the Second World War), three fine autobiographies, and another twenty-three books of miscellaneous essays and histories. His greatest popularity was in the earlier part of his career. His reputation was effectively established by his third novel, 'Juan in America' (1931), a richly comic, picaresque extravaganza rather in the manner of Byron's 'Don Juan', but based on his observation of the United States, then in the grip of the extreme absurdities of prohibition and the resultant gangsterism. 
But, characteristically, Linklater hated to repeat himself, and he deliberately dashed the expectations of the vast readership of 'Juan in America' by following it with 'The Men of Ness: the Saga of Thorlief Coalbiter's Sons' (1932), a spare, laconic viking adventure in which traditional heroism is defeated, and the survivor, Gauk, is a small, comic figure, in some ways a precursor of the eponymous hero of 'Private Angelo' (1946). This is only the most obvious example of Linklater's preoccupation with Orkney life and Old Norse literature and culture. He wrote in a letter to a friend that he wanted 'to make Scotland 'Viking-conscious'' (Parnell, 126), and he had a personal belief in an aesthetic evaluation of action behind the viking way of life. In 'The Ultimate Viking' (1955), he wrote: 'They were unabashed by social obligation, undeterred by moral prohibition, and they could be quite contemptuous of economic advantage and the safety of their own skins. But they saw clearly a difference between right and wrong, and the difference was aesthetic. If what they did became a story that would please the ear, then it was right and beautiful. (E. Linklater, 'The Ultimate Viking', 8)' Linklater's son Andro recognized fatalism as a major element in his father's life and work, and saw Linklater as 'a convinced, unwavering pagan', perceiving a major preoccupation in his father's stories as 'the proper way to confront an inevitable fate' (A. Linklater, 'Introduction', to E. Linklater, 'The Goose Girl', vii, x). Julian D'Arcy, who devoted a book to the influence of Old Norse literature on Scottish writers, detailed Linklater's studies in the sagas, and, although he found Linklater's interpretation of viking saga and ethos a trifle slanted, concluded that he 'was so steeped in Old Norse lore and literature in both his personal and literary life, that it would be perhaps appropriate to give him the epitaph of the 'Ultimate Viking' of modern Scottish literature' (D'Arcy, 238). 
In 1933 Linklater experimented with the world of the 'Scottish Renaissance' in literature and politics, and stood as the Scottish nationalist candidate in a parliamentary by-election in East Fife. This resulted in 'Magnus Merriman' (1934), a light-hearted and thinly fictionalized account of his disastrous campaign, including much fairly affectionate satire on contemporary Scotland, and a parodic representation of C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) in the poet-leader Hugh Skene. On 1 June 1933 he had married Marjorie MacIntyre ['see below'], and after a period in Italy the couple settled at Dounby in Orkney; they had two daughters and two sons. 
Linklater's experiences in the First World War had made him particularly sensitive to the paradox of the horrors of war on the one hand, and its broadening of experience on the other. He repeatedly illustrated this paradox in his writing, and also continually expressed his unfailing admiration and love for the soldiers who carried on the war. He wrote a great deal about combat, in military histories and pamphlets as well as fiction. Between the wars he saw communism as just as dangerous as fascism, and was emotionally disabled by the Spanish Civil War, finding it impossible to support either side wholeheartedly. His fictional response took the form of 'The Impregnable Women' (1938), a loose adaptation of the 'Lysistrata' of Aristophanes, inspired by angry revulsion against the prospect of the war's renewal. 'Judas' (1939), however, with its themes of loyalty and treachery, was inspired by the way in which Britain and France in particular had deserted the cause of Czechoslovakia in the name of appeasement. 
From 1939 to 1941 Linklater commanded the Orkney fortress company, Royal Engineers. He was then posted to the directorate of public relations in the War Office, where he wrote pamphlets on several aspects of the army at war; he also produced at this time, in his personal capacity, a number of conversation pieces on war aims. From 1944 to 1945 Linklater served in Italy, and it was there that he had the experiences central to his most successful war novel, 'Private Angelo' (1946), a work dedicated to the Eighth Army. Linklater described his love affair with Italy as 'a state of idealistic adultery'. '[T]he subject of my novel was not only war and its capacity for destruction, but Italy and its genius for survival' (Linklater, 'Fanfare', 316). The work's protagonist, Angelo, has led a rout of Italians fleeing from battle, and is dismissed in the first sentence as lacking the gift of courage. But the novel goes on to re-examine the idea of courage, and to stress the importance of understanding. By the end Angelo has served in three armies (Italian, German, and British) and has become the father of children, three of them illegitimate, one English, one Polish, and one Moroccan. The tenor of the book is against nationalism, and Linklater prefigures Heller and Waugh, and even Henry Kissinger, when he has the innocent Angelo say: 'I hope you will not liberate us out of existence'. As armies bomb their own troops, and Angelo repeatedly deserts, the reader is shown the essential folly of war. But the wandering refugees, and the rapes of both Angelo and his fiancee, keep the serious horror in the forefront, and serve to maintain Linklater's conviction that, despite everything, this is a just and necessary war. 
In 1945 Linklater was elected rector of Aberdeen University, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1946. In 1947 the Linklaters left Orkney, where conditions had changed greatly during the war, for Pitcalzean House in Ross-shire. Here they lived until 1972 when, faced with oil-related developments in the locality, they moved to Aberdeenshire. In 1951 he published a semi-official history, 'The Campaign in Italy', and visited Korea with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1954 he was appointed CBE; from 1968 to 1973 he was deputy lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty; and in 1971 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 
Linklater's novels in this later period are well written and ingenious, but to an extent lack the comic energy of their predecessors; and finding himself less in rapport with the public, he turned more to history as time went on. At the end of the twentieth century, however, they had yet to receive serious critical evaluation, which some certainly deserve. Linklater's best fiction often uses myth as a central structuring device, as with his use of Byron in 'Juan in America'. 'A Man over Forty' (1963) repeats that appropriateness by juxtaposing the worlds of twentieth-century television and ancient Greek myth: Edward Balintore is a television personality who unconcernedly submits to a gruelling interview on air, only to collapse suddenly and dramatically after confessing he is afraid of being found out. The book charts his comic journey in search of peace, his gradual self-discovery, and the exorcizing of his guilt. The basic myth is that of Orestes, and Balintore's buried memory of matricide and his pursuit by twentieth-century Furies forms the sober centre of a comic novel which combines all of Linklater's best ingredients. 
Linklater was notable for his craftsmanship, his sense of style, his love of wit, and his zest for life, all of which are apparent in his autobiographies. As a novelist he excels mainly in providing civilized entertainment for intelligent middlebrow readers. Although he travelled widely his roots were deep in Scottish rural life: he loved fishing, walking, and boating, and once described himself as 'an old peasant with a pen' (Linklater, 'Fanfare', 326), although his lifestyle was in fact more that of a country gentleman. His manner tended to the brusque and military. In appearance, his most striking features were a high domed forehead, prematurely bald head with a deeply indented skull due to his war wound, rimless spectacles, and a moustache. He died in St John's Nursing Home, Aberdeen, on 7 November 1974 after a thrombosis, and was buried in the Harray churchyard in Orkney on 11 November. 
Linklater's wife, Marjorie Linklater (1909-1997), campaigner for the arts and the environment, was born on 19 March 1909 at 19 Northumberland Street, Edinburgh, the daughter of Ian MacIntyre (1869-1946), writer to the signet, Scottish rugby international, and later Unionist MP for West Edinburgh, and his first wife, Ida (died 1942), daughter of Charles Van der Gucht. Educated at St George's School, Edinburgh, Downe House, Berkshire, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London, and considered a great beauty, she acted in small West End parts, then returned to Scotland. She met her future husband while campaigning for a Scottish national theatre. One of their sons described their marriage as 'turbulent and ultimately consoling' ('The Guardian', 5 July 1997). Following the family's move to Ross-shire in 1947 she was a member of Ross and Cromarty county council (1953-69), involved in conservation and education issues. She was also a member of the Scottish Arts Council (1957-63). After her husband's death she moved back to Orkney, to which she was devoted. She was active in local heritage, arts, environment, and politics, successfully opposed uranium mining and off-shore nuclear-waste dumping, was chairman of the Orkney Heritage Society (1977-81), helped establish the St Magnus festival, and campaigned for the Scottish National Party. She died on 29 June 1997 at 20 Main Street, Kirkwall, Orkney, and was survived by her four children, one of whom, Magnus ('b'. 1942), was editor of 'The Scotsman' (1988-94) and chairman of the Scottish Arts Council (1996-2001). Another, Andro Linklater (1944-2013), was a prolific journalist and biographer, who began his writing career by completing the history of the Black Watch left unfinished on his father's death.

Allchurch, Ivor John (1929-1997), footballer, was born on 16 October 1929 at 66 Waunwen Road, Swansea, the sixth of the seven children of Charles Wilfred (Charlie) Allchurch, furnaceman, and his wife, Mabel, formerly Miller, 'nee' Smith. His parents were natives of Dudley who had moved to Swansea. He was educated at Plasmarl School, Swansea, but left at fourteen to work first in an office, then as a fish market porter. 
Allchurch's extraordinary football talents, which in peacetime would have earned schoolboy representative honours, were spotted in September 1944 by a scout from Swansea Town. He became a member of the club's ground staff in 1945 and a full professional two years later. National service with the army from 1947 to 1949 delayed his entry into league football, although he played at a high non-league standard as a guest with Shrewsbury Town and Wellington Town. He made his Football League second-division debut on 26 December 1949, away to West Ham United, and made an immediate impact as an elegant, ball-playing inside-forward. Roy Paul, a Swansea team-mate, recalled that 'Even as a youngster he had the hallmark of greatness' (Paul, 79). Within weeks of his debut Allchurch was the subject of transfer speculation, and in less than a year he was a Welsh international, capped against Ireland at Sunderland on 15 November 1950. 
Among the most gifted of a remarkable generation of footballers who emerged from Swansea in the decade following the Second World War, Allchurch was without question the one most cherished by his home town. In part this was because he was more closely identified with Swansea Town than the others. Jack Kelsey and John Charles spent their careers with other clubs, Trevor Ford played little more than a season, and Cliff Jones played five seasons with Swansea before passing the bulk of his career elsewhere. Allchurch's popularity also reflected his quality as a footballer. Tall, slim, and fair-haired -- characteristics that led to his being described as Swansea's 'Golden Boy' (Farmer and Stead, 12) -- he was described by the Scottish journalist Bob Ferrier as 'the complete natural intuitive inside-forward -- the Mozart of football' (ibid., 49). Jimmy Hill, who played against him, said 'he had elegance... the game never seemed to be going too fast for him' (ibid., 163). Jimmy Murphy, who managed the Wales national team in the late 1950s, said: 'Ivor had the lot. He was two-footed: a superb runner on the ball with a glorious body swerve. He could shoot hard and accurately with both feet, and he was very good in the air' (Murphy, 102). 
On 13 June 1953 Allchurch married Esme Thomas, an eighteen-year-old accountant machine operator in a toy factory, and daughter of Richard Thomas, labourer in a steel works. They had two sons; three other children were stillborn. Allchurch continued to play for Swansea until 1958. Some observers argued that his decision to stay with second-division Swansea led to his not fulfilling a remarkable talent. Before the abolition of the maximum wage in 1961 there was no financial pressure on players to move to leading clubs. Allchurch was described by John Charles as 'a loyal Swansea lad. All he wanted to do was play football' ('South Wales Evening Post', 11 July 1997). He was content to stay, hoping Swansea might win promotion. There were years of press speculation, much predicting that his transfer would set a new British record. In 1952 he nearly did leave, for Wolverhampton Wanderers, but as a consequence of the club's financial situation -- which was improved in time to negate the transfer -- rather than any desire on his part. Any suggestion of underachievement was belied by his international performances, particularly in the 1958 world cup, when Wales, after qualifying for the first time, reached the quarter-final before losing to the eventual winners, Brazil. Santiago Bernabeu, president of Real Madrid, then the dominant club in Europe, called him 'the greatest inside-forward in the world' (Murphy, 103). 
In October 1958 Allchurch left Swansea for Newcastle United, saying 'it is now or never' (Farmer and Stead, 85). He stayed at Newcastle until 1962, then moved to Cardiff City before returning to Swansea Town in 1965. He played his 694th and last Football League match -- at the time the third-highest career total -- in May 1968. These included 103 first-division matches, all for Newcastle. He scored 245 goals, including 160 (a club record) for Swansea. The first man to play more than fifty times for Wales, his sixty-eight caps and twenty-three goals remained national records for many years following his last cap in 1966. He was appointed MBE in the new year's honours list of 1966. 
Allchurch went on playing non-league football until the age of fifty, when his wife demanded that he burn his boots. He then worked as a storeman. He was mild-mannered and unpretentious, diffident to the point of shyness. In company he was 'modest, reserved, quietly elegant and circumspect', and in later life took on 'something of a clerical air' with a 'refined manner and somewhat nervous smile' (Farmer and Stead, 164). He died at his home, 12 Whitestone Road, Bishopston, Swansea, on 9 July 1997, of cancer. He was survived by his wife and their two sons. His funeral, at Morriston crematorium, near Swansea, on 16 July 1997, attracted more than 500 mourners. His younger brother, Len ('b'. 1933), was also a successful footballer, who played for Swansea (in 1953-4 the club's playing staff included four sets of brothers), Sheffield United, and Stockport. He won eleven Wales caps between 1955 and 1964.

Berry, Ronald Anthony (1920-1997), novelist, was born on 23 February 1920 at Lower Terrace, Blaen-cwm, at the top end of the valley of the Rhondda Fawr, Glamorgan, the son of George Thomas Berry (1896-1977), a colliery fireman, and his wife, Mary Ann, 'nee' Davies (1896-1972). Both his parents were Welsh-speaking but he had only a little of the language. His paternal grandfather, James Berry, had come to the Klondyke of the Rhondda from rural Oxfordshire in search of work. The family moved shortly after Ron Berry's birth to 17 and then 4 Michaels Road, and in 1947 to 8 Beynons Row, Blaen-cwm. 
After leaving school at the age of fourteen, Berry followed his father into the local pits, working as a collier until the outbreak of the Second World War, during which he served in both the army and the merchant navy. An injury to his knee while playing for Swansea City in 1943 put an end to a promising career as a footballer and shortly afterwards he went absent without leave from the ordnance corps, only to be caught by the military police on his own doorstep. A born rebel, he put a good deal of effort into 'ducking and dodging' (his habitual phrase), trying to keep out of authority's way, and remained sceptical of all systems and conventional behaviour throughout his life. He spent some years as a carpenter, a steelworker, and a navvy in Wales and England and, 'thick-set, pigeon-toed and peasant-fisted' (autobiography), took up professional boxing, but was often unemployed. 
Berry married Ethel Irene (Rene) Jones ('b'. 1928) on 12 July 1947, and they had five children. He was prevented from finding regular work by chronic ill health, but began writing poems, essays, and stories. After a year at Coleg Harlech, a residential college of further education for mature students, and another at Shoreditch College, where he read avidly and honed his left-wing political views in endless argument with staff and fellow students, he returned to the Rhondda in 1955, settling in Treherbert, where he spent the rest of his life at 1 Ael-y-bryn. A gruff man, he remained profoundly suspicious of academic exegesis of his writing and was so disenchanted with politicians that he never once voted in a general election. 
Back in the Rhondda, and while working during the day as assistant manager at the swimming baths, Berry wrote his first novel, 'Hunters and Hunted' (1960), which was soon followed by 'Travelling Loaded' (1963). The main characters in both novels are feckless and mainly concerned with sex, boozing, and drawing the dole. The world of drifting, libidinous, hedonistic labourers was one which Ron Berry was to make his own. The Rhondda of his stories is unlike that of any other Welsh novelist: it is economically more prosperous (before the closing of the mines), and its people are more sophisticated and less concerned with politics and religion than those of, say, Rhys Davies or Gwyn Thomas. 
Berry's concern that the old communal values, among men who lived and worked in the same village, were beginning to wither during the post-war period was first expressed in 'The Full-Time Amateur' (1966), in which social change proceeds apace as the affluent working class begin to buy cars and television sets, go to bingo, and take holidays abroad. Ron Berry saw himself as their chronicler, lovingly but sometimes caustically recording 'what remains of the past before it sputters out as garbled memory' (autobiography). This threnody for a doomed way of life centred on mining found its fullest expression in 'Flame and Slag' (1968), a novel based on the journal of a dying miner whose poignant recollections of the old, coal-bearing Rhondda and its vibrant society are used as counterpoint to the brash ignorance and apathy of his children. Berry's novel 'So Long, Hector Bebb' (1970), told in the words of the people closest to him, is a portrait of a second-rate boxer, the revoking of whose licence after a foul in the ring leads to his tragic end. 
Despite the fact that five of his novels were published in London by such reputable firms as Hutchinson, W. H. Allen, and Macmillan, Ron Berry was virtually ignored by metropolitan critics and neglected in Wales. It was twenty-six years before his next novel was published. When Dewi Joshua, the hero of 'This Bygone' (1996), is declared redundant, it looks like the end of him and his community. Yet the working class in Berry's novels, for all their shortcomings, adapt, survive, and eventually thrive in changing conditions, so that his work is more a warm-hearted affirmation of his belief in them than a rigorous critique. Above all, he drew an authentic portrait of proletarian Wales because he was born into it and never left it. His novels and stories will almost certainly be the last to be written from inside a way of life that is now passing from living memory. 
The general indifference to Berry's work took its toll and, together with the osteoarthritis which plagued him, was largely responsible for his rather sour attitude and gruff manner, even towards those who tried to help him. With time on his hands and often short of money, he spent a good deal of his time fly-fishing and bird-watching. One of his last books, 'Peregrine Watching' (1987), finely observed and rather less hyperbolic than the novels, was about the return of the peregrine falcon to the Rhondda. His financial difficulties were partially relieved when, in the 1970s, some of his writer friends were instrumental in obtaining a civil-list pension for him. His autobiography, 'History is what you Live', by turns sentimental, darkly humorous, and splenetic, was published posthumously, with an introduction by Dai Smith, in 1998, and his 'Collected Stories', edited by Simon Baker, appeared in 2000. The latter book revealed a short-story writer of considerable power and it is on this showing that Ron Berry's reputation seems likely to rest. 
Berry died in East Glamorgan General Hospital, near Pontypridd, on 16 July 1997, and was cremated at Llwydcoed, near Aberdar, six days later.

Smallwood, Sir Denis Graham (1918-1997), air force officer, was born on 13 August 1918 at 7 St Alban's Road, Moseley, Birmingham, the son of Frederick William Smallwood, rule manufacturer, and his wife, Irene May, 'nee' Kentish. Smallwood was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, and joined the RAF in 1938, becoming assistant adjutant and flying instructor in 605 (County of Warwick) squadron, an auxiliary unit flying Gladiator biplane fighters. For most of the Second World War, Splinters Smallwood was attached to Fighter Command, serving as a fighter pilot with 605, 87 and 247 Hurricane squadrons between 1939 and 1942, and leading a Spitfire wing from 1943 to 1944. 
On 14 October 1940, at the church of St Agnes, Moseley, he had married Frances Jeanne (1920-1992), daughter of Walter Needham, jeweller of Birmingham. They had a son and daughter. 
At 87 United Services squadron Smallwood commanded the ground attacks which backed up the abortive Dieppe raid on 19 August 1942 in which 4000 of the 6000 British and Canadian troops were killed, wounded, or captured. Instead of drawing the entire Luftwaffe forces in northern France into an attritional battle over Dieppe, it was the RAF that suffered a defeat with the loss of 109 aircraft. For his bravery that day in leading his squadron into action against German gun emplacements, Smallwood was awarded the DFC (1942). Following a brief spell with 247 squadron, he was placed in charge of a Spitfire wing operating from bases in Cornwall from where he roved over occupied France, attacking targets of opportunity such as trains, vehicle convoys, and gun positions. After the allied landings in Normandy, he led 131 and 165 squadrons carrying out ground attacks in support of the allied advance inland, for which he was awarded the DSO (1944). 
Between 1945 and 1946 Smallwood was directing staff at the RAF Staff College, Haifa. From there he went to headquarters British air forces of occupation Germany and in 1948 he received command of 33 squadron, a Tempest fighter squadron in Germany. Between 1948 and 1952 he was an Air Ministry planner and a member of the Joint Services Staff College. Placed in command of RAF Biggin Hill, he led a large force of jet aircraft on 2 June 1953 for the RAF salute at the queen's coronation. 
During the Suez crisis in 1956 Smallwood planned the action of the air task force which neutralized the Egyptian air force. Although the operation was successful, Smallwood, with characteristic forthrightness, called the basis on which he and his fellow planners were expected to work, 'a monumental political cock-up' ('The Guardian', 19 Aug 1987). 
After Suez he commanded the Bloodhound surface to air missile wing at North Cotes in Lincolnshire and in 1961 became commandant of the college of air warfare at Manby. Two years later he was appointed assistant chief of staff (operations). Although a renowned fighter pilot, Smallwood built a new reputation as a bomber leader when appointed to 3 group, Bomber Command, in 1965, senior air staff officer at Bomber Command in 1967, and deputy commander-in-chief, Strike Command, the following year. From 1969 to 1970 he was air officer commanding the Near East air force and, at the same time, administrator of the sovereign base area in Cyprus. Smallwood returned to Britain where he became vice-chief of the air staff, and from 1974 to 1976, commander-in-chief Strike Command. From 1975 he commanded Nato's UK air forces. 
Smallwood had the distinction of being knighted twice. Having been appointed MBE in 1951, CBE in 1961, and CB in 1966, he received a KCB in 1969 and GBE in 1975. 
Following retirement from the RAF in 1976, Smallwood spent six years as a military adviser to British Aerospace, and in his later years indulged his interest in horses, becoming organizer of the Tythrop horse trials near Thame, Oxfordshire, and chairman of the RAF Equitation Society. Other interests included shooting and gundog training, and he played a major part in charitable fields, notably at Pace, a locally based charity to assist children with cerebral palsy. He was chairman of the Air League as well as being co-founder and president of the Friends of St Clement Dane, the RAF central church in the Strand, London. 
Splinters Smallwood died from heart disease at his home, 27 Swinnerton House, Phyllis Court Drive, Henley-on-Thames, on 26 July 1997, survived by his son and daughter, his wife having died in 1992.

Young, John Zachary (1907-1997), zoologist, known universally as J. Z., was born at Fishponds, Bristol, on 18 March 1907, the first of three sons and two daughters of Philip Young (1878-1965), engineer, and his wife, Constance Maria, 'nee' Lloyd (1875-1955), schoolteacher. A great-great-grandfather, Richard, was brother to Thomas Young (1773-1829), physician, physicist, and hieroglyphist. Other distinguished scientific relations, from his mother's side, were Luke Howard (1772-1864), meteorologist, great-great-grandfather to Sir Alan Hodgkin (1914-1998), neuroscientist, and father of John Eliot Howard (1807-1883), quinologist. Although on both sides many of his family were Quakers, Young's parents brought him up in an Anglo-Catholic tradition. Bishop Charles Gore was his godfather. He left religious belief during the Oxford Moral Re-Armament movement of the 1930s, but retained a lifelong interest in philosophy and ethics. Much of this thinking was expressed in the Reith lectures for 1950 and in the last of his nine books, 'Philosophy and the Brain' (1987). 
His mother taught Young until he was nine years old, then he was sent to board at Wells House, Malvern Wells, Worcestershire. At thirteen he entered Marlborough College. In 1925 he became a demy at Magdalen College, Oxford, whence he graduated in 1928 with first-class honours in zoology. Successive college and university appointments followed, and in 1943 he was elected vice-president of Magdalen. In 1945, having failed to succeed Edwin Stephen Goodrich in the Oxford zoology chair, he accepted that of human anatomy at University College, London. There he stayed until his retirement in 1974. For the next twenty-three years he was based at the Wellcome Foundation and, later, in the psychology department, Oxford. During this time he continued to research and lecture, and published two books on neural mechanisms. 
Between 1929 and 1945 Young came to be regarded as the outstanding tutor and zoologist in Oxford. All his teaching and research had flair and enthusiasm. A dominating and charismatic personality he could sometimes be overbearing, arrogant, and unwilling to listen to criticism. In fact he was too interested in science for this behaviour to last long and usually he responded well to valid arguments, even from juniors. His dynamism and enthusiasm inspired many to careers in biology and medicine. As Professor David Barker, a former pupil, wrote: 'It was his intense interest in all living things, his almost childlike wonder and curiosity about them, that made Young such an inspiring teacher. That, and his contempt for established dogma, his insistence on establishing everything afresh'. In tutorials 'his sharp intellect could be ruthless, his exposure of flaws and errors merciless but mixed in with the criticism there would usually be some praise and always encouragement and inspiration to move on to the next topic and improve' (Boycott, 490). 
Young was without medical qualifications, and he never became a DPhil. Thus his appointment to head a department in a medical school (at University College, London) was vociferously opposed by a conservative establishment largely composed of medical anatomists and surgeons. He overcame their opposition by ignoring it, meanwhile getting his staff to use a more functional approach when teaching human anatomy and insisting they undertook significant research. He founded an intercalated BSc anatomy course, lasting 12-18 months, for those medical students who had become interested in basic biological science. These reforms triggered similar course changes in other medical schools. The department soon became a place of choice for postdoctoral workers, particularly from the USA. Opposition to his appointment evaporated. 
In Oxford, Young had begun to write a textbook that expanded to become two. These were finished during his first decade at University College, London. 'The Life of Vertebrates' (1950) and 'The Life of Mammals' (1957) were a national and international success. Their style was enjoyable to read, an innovation for zoology texts of the time. Another innovation was Young's treatment of comparative anatomy. Until these books were published animal structures were described as assemblages of facts to provide evidence for evolution. Young was brought up in this tradition, which he thought intellectually rigorous but dull and limited. He now took those facts, organized them from a functional, as well as a comparative anatomical, viewpoint, then presented them as a study of the responses of organisms to the functional and behavioural requirements of the environment. This was refreshing and the books led several generations of students and their teachers to a clearer understanding of animal structure and its evolution, as well as many other biological problems. 
Young was an effective teacher and administrator; he was also a deeply committed research worker. In his autobiographical notes he explained that he was never certain why he decided to specialize in nervous system research. However, some of the early influences on his thinking about nervous systems and on his choice of cephalopods for his main research studies are clear. He always acknowledged the special influence of Derek Denny-Brown (later professor of neurology at Harvard), who introduced him to the histological techniques he was to use throughout his career. Denny-Brown and several other friends, including John Carew Eccles, were members of Sir Charles Scott Sherrington's group in the Oxford physiology department. Sherrington always emphasized the need to search for the anatomical basis of the physiology of, and hence the behaviour generated by, central nervous systems. He sought to resolve difficulties of observation and interpretation by working on 'simpler' systems, such as the mammalian spinal cord. Modifications and amplifications of this approach became the basis for much of Young's thinking on neural mechanisms. Thus early in his career (1938) he proposed a theory of reverberating neural circuits (based on the anatomy of the vertical and superior frontal lobes of cephalopod brains) to account for the persistence in time of memories of events. This theory derived, in part, from the then current explanations of the mechanisms involved in the persistence of rhythmic scratching generated within the mammalian spinal cord after the initiating stimulus has stopped. 
A second, more practical, influence on Young's development as a research worker was Enrico Sereni. In 1929 Young became the Oxford scholar at the 'Anton Dohrn' zoological station in Naples. Sereni (an anti-fascist who was later found dead in mysterious circumstances) was the resident physiologist. He introduced Young to cephalopods as experimental animals. Together they worked on the time course and nature of degeneration and regeneration when the peripheral nerves of octopods were severed. During these experiments Young noticed an epistellar body on the stellate ganglion of the lesser octopus ('Eledone'). Out of curiosity he made a comparative anatomical study of this structure and looked for it in decapods (squids and cuttlefishes). The work unexpectedly came to be of immense general importance because it led to the discovery of the giant nerve fibre systems of decapods. These systems are made up of large diameter nerve fibres, which are, therefore, fast conducting. They control the musculature involved in a squid's fast escape responses. A single nerve fibre in the common squid can be more than 0.5 mm in diameter. This size caused great excitement among physiologists who had been trying to isolate and record from much smaller single nerve fibres. Indeed the fibres are so large that, within a few years, it even proved possible regularly to insert an electrode inside one. This innovation meant that the potential difference between the inside and the outside of a nerve fibre at rest and during activity could be measured directly, then interpreted in terms of the movements of ions back and forth across the axonal membrane. The results became basic to later theories of nerve cell conduction and fundamental to understanding the ionic properties of membranes of cells in general. Sir Alan Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Huxley were awarded a Nobel prize in 1963 for this work. Hodgkin later remarked, 'it is arguable that the introduction of the squid giant nerve fibre by J. Z. Young in 1936 did more for axonology than any other single advance in technique during the last 40 years' (Boycott, 493). 
The experience of studying degeneration and regeneration in octopus nerves became important during the Second World War. Young was asked by the Medical Research Council to organize a small group in Oxford to study peripheral nerve wounds and their repair. The group soon made some useful surgical improvements to aid regeneration, but a great deal of their work had to be basic. For example, there was little information on the rate of growth of nerve fibres and the details of the conditions affecting this. The dynamic relationships of the axoplasm, myelin, Schwann cells, the cell bodies of nerve cells, and the structures innervated, all had to be investigated and quantified. Looking back, the influence of Young's wartime group can be seen as a bridge between the descriptive past and current molecular biological approaches to problems of neural repair. 
Young did not belong to what he called the reductionist school of biological sciences. Thus he did not follow his discovery of giant nerve fibres into the study of the biophysics of their membranes, nor did he long continue research on the mechanisms of the growth and development of nerve cells. He seems to have regarded investigating cellular mechanisms as scientifically too narrow. He saw this type of work as necessary but too limited in scope to help in study of the 'big problems', such as memory. The best science, he felt, should be the study of integrated functions of organs and systems. Thus as soon as possible after the war he initiated a programme to study memory mechanisms using octopus brains. 
The practical parts of Young's octopus memory studies were carried out at the zoological station in Naples. Except for a return, when over eighty years old, to his earliest research on the autonomic nervous systems of fishes at the Marine Biology Station in Plymouth, cephalopod brain and behaviour studies were to occupy most of his personal research time from 1947 until his death. Initially the memory experiments were designed to be interpreted in terms of specified neural networks and their synapses. As time passed the emphasis shifted to a study of the interrelationship of the lobes of the octopus brain during visual and tactile learning paradigms. In short, the work became more of a cognitive study of the properties of the lobes. Perhaps this was a result of the influence of Young's reading of developments in cognitive psychology. Young had always followed this literature and expected his work on octopus brains to contribute simpler paradigms to aid the understanding of human brain mechanisms. This shift to a more cognitive study was consistent with his emphasis on the need to study organ systems as a whole. But, ironically, it seems to have made his work more limited, to understanding the brain and behaviour of cephalopods, than he had intended when he began. 
Young did not produce any deep theory or unifying hypothesis of neural action. He made the important discovery of squid giant nerve fibres, and wrote major papers and a book on the structure of cephalopod brains. He emphasized the relation between structure and function through this work and his textbooks. He was a great enthusiast for, and enabler and inspirer of, the research of others. Over sixty of his former pupils and staff became professors and directors of departments around the world. One, Sir Peter Medawar, was a Nobel laureate for immunology in 1960, and at least nine were elected fellows of the Royal Society. There were many more former pupils in positions of influence and importance. A remarkable feature of Young's impact was that all those he most influenced developed their own independent lines of work. He encouraged imagination and initiative; he did not expect, or encourage, intellectual clones, as do so many dominating personalities. 
Although a compulsive hard worker Young liked partying and was an accomplished ballroom dancer. He was greatly interested in art and some of his drive as a biologist was his aesthetic response to the 'sheer beauty of living things'. Both his wives were painters. He married Phyllis Heaney ('b'. 1905) on 17 December 1931; they had a son and a daughter. They separated in 1957; she died in March 1987. Young also had a daughter with his second partner, Raymonde May Parsons ('b'. 1916), whom he married on 29 August 1987. 
Young was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1945 and was awarded its royal medal in 1967. He received eight honorary degrees and many other distinctions, including the gold medal of the Linnean Society in 1973 and honorary citizenship of Naples in 1991. He was made an honorary fellow of the British Academy in 1986. For twenty-one years he was president and vice-president of the Marine Biological Association of Great Britain. He died of heart failure at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 4 July 1997, and was buried at All Saints' Church, Brill, Buckinghamshire, six days later. He was survived by his second wife and his three children.

Brown, Dame Beryl Paston (1909-1997), educationist, was born at 78 Ribblesdale Road, Streatham, London, on 7 March 1909, the only daughter and elder child of Paston Charles Brown, bank clerk, and his wife, Florence May, 'nee' Henson. Her father claimed descent from the Pastons of the Paston letters. Her mother was related to Herbert Hensley Henson, bishop of Durham. Beryl was a pupil at Streatham Hill high school and felt privileged all her life to have had a suburban childhood with access to art galleries, concerts, and, most important, the Old Vic. She became a scholar of Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1929, and was awarded firsts in both parts of the English tripos. She then trained as a teacher at the London Day Training College (later the London Institute of Education). 
Paston Brown's first teaching appointment, in 1933, was at Portsmouth Training College, where she divided her time between teaching students and teaching in schools. In 1937 she became a member of the English department of Goldsmiths' College, London, and remained there until 1952 with a two-year interval (1944-6) as a temporary assistant lecturer in her old college, Newnham. After Goldsmiths' she became principal of the Leicester City Training College. Her last appointment was in 1961 when she was offered the post of principal of Homerton College, Cambridge, where she remained until her retirement in 1971. 
Homerton had already a well-established academic tradition, and under Paston Brown's leadership developed this further, first with the new three-year course and then with the introduction of the four-year BEd course. Cambridge University was at first reluctant to recognize this development, and Homerton's first degree students secured their BEds from the University of London. By 1971, however, with patient diplomacy and the help of friends in the university, particularly from Newnham, the foundations of a Cambridge degree in education had been laid. Alongside all this Paston Brown's policy of consultation, delegation, and open communication transformed Homerton's fairly authoritarian culture (common among many training colleges) into one of collegiality among both staff and students. She created a representative and effective academic board in the college several years before this became a required element in all college constitutions, and students were encouraged to create a college culture comparable with that in other Cambridge colleges. 
Paston Brown was also a significant figure in the Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE). She was a lively editor (1948-54) of its journal, 'Education for Teaching', transforming it from an in-house journal into one of wider interest concerned with issues of educational policy and research. She was chairman of the principals' panel in 1960-61, and was an influential voice in preparing the association's evidence to the Robbins committee on higher education. She was later appointed a member of the Newsom committee whose report, 'Half our Future', was published in 1963. This dealt with the education of secondary-school youngsters of average and below average ability, and echoed the ATCDE policy on the value of the concurrent course for the training of teachers in this field. Beryl herself was a strong advocate of this concept of combining in the one course academic study, professional skills, and school experience, particularly for primary school teachers and some areas of secondary teaching. She was elected chairman of the association for 1965-6 and in the following year became a dame of the British empire, the first from the world of teacher training colleges to be so honoured. 
In 1971 Paston Brown retired with her Siamese cat to a small eighteenth-century house in Keere Street, Lewes, Sussex, and until her last illness greatly enjoyed her life there. She made many new friends and entered fully into the life of the community, particularly its musical and literary life, enlivened as it was by the new and neighbouring University of Sussex. She did work for Age Concern and became an enthusiastic tutor for the Open University. She was awarded an honorary degree by the Open University in 1978; this gave her great pleasure, especially as she found herself sitting next to Sir John Gielgud (a lifetime's hero) at lunch. She was an attractive, scholarly woman. Children loved her and she had great concern for them. She was a good listener, and old students and former colleagues, from the Portsmouth days and onwards, kept in touch and clearly regarded her with gratitude and affection. She died at her home, 21 Keere Street, Lewes, following a series of strokes, on 25 July 1997, and was cremated at Brighton crematorium on 5 August. She never married. Her younger brother died on active service with the RAF during the Second World War, and following the death of her father in the 1950s she was the only surviving member of her family.

Manley, John (c.1622-1699), parliamentarian army officer and rebel, came from a minor gentry family seated at Brynyffynnon, Wrexham, Denbighshire. He was the third son of Cornelius Manley, who died in 1623 while John was an infant. John's inheritance was a mere $30, and like so many younger sons of gentry he was put into trade, being apprenticed to a London skinner in 1639. Although both his brothers were royalists in the civil war, Manley enlisted in the parliamentarian army and rose to the rank of captain, possibly helped by his radical religious beliefs. As a Baptist Manley rejected infant baptism, but he went further, denying any legitimacy at all to the Anglican clergy and claiming that continuing divine inspiration made him the equal of any of the apostles. He was also interested in millenarianism and corresponded with the Fifth Monarchist preacher and conspirator Walter Thimbleton, who like Manley came from Wrexham. 
Manley's career was further assisted by his marriage in 1650 to Margaret Dorislaus (died 1675), daughter of the distinguished republican apologist and diplomat Isaac Dorislaus (assassinated by royalists in 1649), with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Parliamentary respect for his dead father-in-law, together with the $500 it had voted to each of Dorislaus's daughters, no doubt helped him to buy the office of postmaster-general in 1653, for the sum of exactly $8259 19's'. 113/4died -- 'with good securities' ('CSP dom.', '1652-3', 450). Responsible for the safe delivery of the post both at home and abroad, at fixed rates, Manley was harassed by law suits from previous holders of the office, and claimed that the costs of developing the service gave him little profit in the two years he held the position. Surveillance of the post was of crucial importance to the regime's security, as Manley's instructions to his postmasters in December 1653 made clear. Apart from their collecting and delivering duties they were to watch strangers and travellers closely, be alert for disaffection and plotting, and to open no letters without Manley's express permission. Security considerations explain why Manley had to sell the office to John Thurloe, the powerful secretary to the council of state, in 1655. During this period Manley made two trips abroad, in 1652 and 1655, possibly to the Netherlands in connection with his father-in-law's affairs. 
Manley retired to Denbighshire after 1655 but remained loyal to the republican regime, serving as a local commissioner for the assessment in 1657, captain of militia, justice of the peace, and MP for Denbigh in 1659. He helped suppress a royalist insurrection in August 1659 by arresting the Denbighshire high sheriff, and he opposed the Restoration. He kept to his dissenting religious views, too, his house in Wrexham being raided in 1663 and 1665 as an illegal conventicle. On the latter occasion his quick wits enabled many of the 100 persons present to escape, while he argued with the militia officers through an open window over their lack of a search warrant. After the Restoration he returned to London and took up brewing, though he kept his lease of Brynyffynnon. He lost his premises in the fire of London, but in the 1670s was sufficiently prosperous to become a master in his company, the Skinners. His wife, Margaret, died in 1675, and he remarried some time after, having at least one son by his second wife, Mary (died 1701). 
Manley may have considered emigrating to America, having acquired 370 acres in Carolina in 1678, but the grant brought him into contact with the earl of Shaftesbury just as the Popish Plot and exclusion crisis commenced, and Manley re-entered radical politics. He helped promote London's 'monster petition' to the king (for the elected parliament to meet) in 1679-80 and became one of Shaftesbury's agents, being sent by the earl in 1681 to organize disaffected seamen at Wapping to take arms if the king should die. Though on the fringe of the confused plotting which led to the Rye House conspiracy, Manley was never sufficiently prominent to be arrested. His business affairs suffered, however, and by the spring of 1684 he was bankrupt. Early in that year he was still associating with John Wildman and other conspirators in London, but by May he had fled to the Netherlands. 
Manley joined the duke of Monmouth's ill-fated expedition in 1685, his presence being very welcome as one of the few participants with any military experience. Monmouth promoted him to major, a rank Manley insisted on for the rest of his life. Though over sixty years old Manley was active in the fighting. Shortly after the landing at Lyme Regis he swept militia troops out of nearby Bridport with a much inferior force of a mere dozen horse, contributing to the dominance which the rebels early established over the militias of the south-west. Ten days into the rebellion, while the rebels were at Shepton Mallett, they were joined by Manley's son Isaac bearing a message from John Wildman that there were good prospects of a rising in Cheshire, and asking what could he and the duke's other London friends do. Monmouth had counted on simultaneous risings elsewhere in England to stretch royal forces, and 'young Manley' was sent back with a sharp message for the Londoners to act at once. A week later, just before the battle of Sedgemoor, Manley himself was sent to London to try to stir Wildman and his friends into action. He thus missed the climax of the rebellion, and though an arrest warrant was issued for him he evaded capture and escaped to the Netherlands. 
There Manley joined up with other survivors. He was noted as one of the 'godly' faction among them; took an active part in an attempt to establish a woollen factory at Groningen to provide employment for the exiles; threatened to kill an exile suspected of informing for the English government; and was hopeful of another rebellion if James II tried to resume church lands sold at the Reformation. He sought no pardon, and he and his son Isaac were both excepted from James II's general pardons of 1686 and 1688. He was one of three egregious rebel exiles whom William of Orange in December 1685 asked the Amsterdam authorities to arrest, in response to pressure from James II. Manley nevertheless embarked with William in 1688 and did good work, raising support for the prince in the west. He represented Bridport (Dorset) in the Convention Parliament of 1689, where he was very active, sitting on fifty-one committees and participating in the drafting of several important measures, including the oath of allegiance, the 'Bill of Rights', and the 'Mutiny Bill'. He took part in the discussions concerning religious toleration, and was lobbied by George Fox and the Quakers. 
From about 1690, however, Manley fell into oblivion in public matters, being defeated at Bridport in parliamentary elections in 1690 and 1695. He was one of the very few English rebels and exiles whom William III did not quickly favour with some office, however minor. This may have been because his views were too republican for William, or it may simply have been the effect of advancing age and poor circumstances. Described in 1684 as a 'broken brewer' (Greaves & Zaller, 'BDBR', 2.212), he had probably lost more money in the Groningen cloth venture, and in March 1696 he petitioned for a position in the customs, pleading his great loss of estate caused by sufferings in the public service. He obtained no relief, and by 1698 he was sick with the palsy and in prison for debt, with his son Isaac petitioning for an increase in his own salary in order to support his father. This finally produced a pension of $200 per annum, but Manley lived to receive less than a year of it, dying early in 1699, when he was residing at the Old Artillery Ground. He was buried at St Stephen Walbrook on 31 January 1699. His eldest son, John, married a Cornish heiress, sat as MP for Bossiney and Camelford under William and Anne, and was a strong tory; but his other son, Isaac (a rebel in 1685), remained a whig and was well rewarded, becoming postmaster-general of Ireland and an Irish MP from 1713 to his death in 1737.

Webbe, Thomas (b. 1624x6?), Ranter, first achieved notoriety in 1644 when he was arrested by order of the House of Lords for blasphemous preaching in London. At this point, he was a feltmaker and hatmaker living in Southwark. He was charged with the more advanced heresies of his day, asserting the primacy of immediate, divine inspiration by rejecting the historical Christ, the literal truth of scripture, and the immortality of the soul. Some of his alleged opinions were couched in the crude and provocative terms later attributed to the libertine antinomians known as Ranters, such as that a drunkard did the will of God and that God knew no difference between the flesh of the best saint and the flesh of a toad. Under examination by divines from the Westminster assembly he denied the more extreme heresies and grosser statements attributed to him but stood by his commitment to the primacy of personal spiritual inspiration. Thomas Edwards, the London Presbyterian minister who publicized Webbe's errors in his heresiography 'Gangraena' (1646), alleged that he had recanted to secure his liberty; Webbe answered in print that he had been cleared of all charges. According to Edwards, Webbe was twenty or twenty-one years old. 
Webbe embarked on a career of itinerant preaching during the last years of the civil war and by 1647 had acquired the living of Langley Burrell, in Wiltshire, allegedly by promising not to collect his tithe. A colourful account of Webbe's pastoral care was published in 1652 by Edward Stokes, a Wiltshire magistrate, based on the extensive documentation he had collected for the parliamentary committee for plundered ministers, which ejected Webbe in 1651. In the winter of 1649-50 Webbe lost his wife, married a woman called Mary (who, according to Stokes, was Webbe's third wife), but also took as his mistress the patron's wife, Mary White. He attempted to resolve the resulting friction between wife and mistress by setting up a commune in the manor house which became the centre of a libertine sect. He procured the seduction of his wife by a young rustic and took for himself a 'man-wife' named John Organ of Castle Combe. Thoroughly debauched, Organ abandoned his wife and children, acquired a mistress, and took to the life of itinerant preaching with Webbe's blessing. Stokes sought to discredit Webbe as a libertine antinomian and published evidence of his connections with the notorious group of Ranters led by Abiezer Coppe. Webbe was accused of Ranter-like opinions, including that Moses was a conjuror and Christ a deceiver. Preaching and lying were alike to him; he could sleep with any woman except his mother. In Ranter style, Webbe's sect were said to 'curse and swear, sing lewd songs, and drink prophane and blasphemous healths' (Stokes, 31). However, Webbe was never charged under the 'Blasphemy Act' of August 1650 which proscribed his sect's doctrines. Rather the move against him came from his own followers. In September 1650 his mistress accused him of various sexual offences; Webbe publicly repented and the case went no further. The next month two disciples accused parson and mistress of adultery, a capital offence under an act of May 1650, both with each other and various members of their group. However they were acquitted by the assize jury. 
By August 1651 Webbe was under investigation by the committee for plundered ministers. His enthusiastic opinions were duly catalogued, along with the immoral behaviour they were assumed to promote. He was also accused of rejecting all political authority and supporting the radical Levellers. Other charges were more specifically designed to secure his ejection, notably that he had excluded the lawful incumbent and wasted the glebe. Webbe lost his living in September 1651 and, after a brief pamphlet skirmish with Stokes in 1652, returned to the obscurity whence he came. Webbe's last known appearance may have been in 1654, when a Thomas Webbe was tried at the Old Bailey for an adultery committed in London the year before: the prosecution referred to his dangerous principles and opinions of four or five years earlier. During his brief period of notoriety Webbe furnished the opponents of religious radicalism with damning evidence of the moral anarchy produced by the collapse of civil and ecclesiastical authority during the English revolution.

Walcott, Thomas (c.1625-1683), conspirator, was a native of Warwickshire and (according to Roger Boyle, earl of Orrery, who knew him from the 1650s) a relative of Edmund Ludlow. His father became a settler in Ireland, and the memory of 1641 was to burn itself into Walcott's political identity. In 1672 he was to recall to his interrogators, 'how the Irish Papists had in 1641 murdered his father, and turned all his children a-begging, whereof he being one and a spectator, he believed their principles were the same now as then' ('CSP dom.', '1672-3', 152-3). 
Walcott served in Cromwell's army in Ireland in the 1650s, possibly initially in Henry Ingoldsby's regiment of dragoons, certainly as a captain-lieutenant in Edmund Ludlow's regiment of horse, for he acted as Ludlow's agent in obtaining land for troopers' arrears upon its disbandment in 1655. He commanded a troop of horse in the brigade dispatched to England in August 1659, and though he had supported the reinstatement of the Rump Parliament, he was arrested by Daniel Redman, its new commander. General Monck permitted Walcott to return to his family and estate in Ireland, 'supposing (as affaires were) he could doe less hurte there than in England', according to Ludlow's account (Ludlow, 86). Ludlow speaks approvingly of his former officer and possible kinsman in 'A Voyce from the Watch Tower': Captain Walcott was 'an honest and faithfull officer of the Irish brigade, having gained an interest in the officers and souldiers by his sincere deportement and good conduct'; he was 'a faithfull servant of the Comonwealth' (ibid., 85, 177). 
By May 1660 Walcott was back in England and on 22 May he appeared at the bar of the House of Commons to accuse the Irish Catholic Sir Edward Fitzharris of having told him in Westminster Hall 'that the Irish were the King's best subjects, and that they would have their lands againe' (Ludlow, 177). Perhaps he had returned to England with Sir John Clotworthy, who had gone over in March to represent the interests of the Irish adventurers and the soldiers settled in Ireland: when Walcott went to the Commons to accuse Fitzharris and a Mr Johnson, he was accompanied by Clotworthy. Indeed, Walcott's information seems to have played its part in the declarations by the Commons two days later that all Irish rebels and papists in England were to depart and that no Irish Catholics were to disturb the possession of any English protestant in Ireland except by due course of law until parliament had decided the future of such properties. 
The Restoration brought Walcott incarceration in Dublin Castle on suspicion of having been Charles I's executioner, but he was acquitted. About 1661 he sold his property and went to London, but had returned by early 1663. Following the disclosure of the Dublin plot early that year, Orrery, who had already required him to be bound over in $1000 for his good behaviour, sent him to Dublin for interrogation. In early 1666 Thomas Blood recruited Walcott for the abortive Liverpool plot, allegedly placing him in charge of Clare and Limerick. In November 1672 Walcott was again accused of conspiring to seize Limerick. Reportedly, he intended to acquire weapons from the Netherlands and had a declaration calling for the Long Parliament's return and the abolition of popery, prelacy, and the hearth tax. He was arrested, upon which he vividly described his panic at the thought of a new Irish rising and implied his fear of the king's pro-Catholic intentions, for otherwise, 'If the king would stand neuter, he doubted not but we were able to beat them into the sea' ('CSP dom.', '1672-3', 153). Walcott was sent to England and confined in the Tower of London on 8 February 1673, notwithstanding his professions of innocence and his assertion that the English monarchy was the best in the world. In May 1673 the earl of Essex, the lord lieutenant, who deemed Walcott 'a great man with the Anabaptist Partie here', thought he would be useful as an informer against dissidents in Ireland, but nothing came of this (BL, Stowe MS 213, fol. 196'r'). After his release, the date of which is uncertain, Walcott returned to Limerick and his estate in co. Clare, which was now worth approximately $800 per annum. 
Walcott returned to England in June 1682 at the invitation of the earl of Shaftesbury, to whom he had been introduced by William, Lord Howard of Escrick. Walcott would later admit that the earl had enlisted him in his proposed insurrection. In October 1682 the barrister Robert West, as he subsequently confessed, learned about Shaftesbury's plans from Walcott, who invited West to draft a manifesto. When Shaftesbury fled to the Netherlands in November 1682 he was accompanied by Walcott and the minister Robert Ferguson. After returning to England in February 1683 Walcott and Ferguson participated in the cabal that included Colonel John Rumsey and the whig attorneys Richard Nelthorpe and Richard Goodenough. This group plotted to assassinate Charles and James at the Rye House, near Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire ['see also 'Rye House plotters]. According to West, Walcott agreed to lead the party that would attack the royal guards, though Walcott later insisted he had opposed assassination. He admitted attending three or four meetings of the cabal, at which they asserted that their 'liberties and properties as English men... were... violated' (Walcott, 2). After the Rye House scheme collapsed, Walcott participated in meetings to plan a general insurrection. 
When the plotters learned that Josiah Keeling had disclosed the conspiracy to the government, eight of them met at Walcott's house on 18 June 1683, but he opted not to flee overseas because he suffered from gout. Walcott, said West, 'comforted himself with a prophetick faith, saying he was perswaded that God would yet deliver the Nation but did not approve of the Instruments who had at present undertaken it' (BL, Add. MS 38847, fol. 119'v'). Arrested on 8 July, he was the first person tried, probably because he had been involved with both Shaftesbury and West, and had sent a letter to Sir Leoline Jenkins offering a full confession in return for a pardon. Although he had effectively admitted his involvement, he pleaded not guilty when a pardon was not forthcoming. West, Rumsey, Keeling, and Zachary Bourne testified against him. Denouncing their credibility, Walcott insisted that he was guilty only of misprision of treason. Found guilty of treason, he was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn on 20 July. His son John received permission to bury the body, but the head was affixed to Aldersgate. 
Walcott, described as 'a very stout man' in 1672, was depicted as a tall, rather slender man with a dark complexion eleven years later (TNA: PRO, SP 63/332/47; SP 29/429/32). Although a Baptist, he once referred to himself as 'being for the Congregational way' (TNA: PRO, SP 63/332/47, 53.1). Michael Boyle, archbishop of Dublin, deemed him 'a very considerable person under the usurper [Cromwell] and a by-got in his perswasions' (TNA: PRO, SP 63/332/49); in fact, he was a man whose convictions prompted him to risk his estate and ultimately his life to save England and Ireland from the perceived threat posed by James and Catholicism.

Spence, William (1650/51-1699), conspirator and private secretary, was 'born of mean parents' ('CSP dom.', '1683', 370) at Sandreford in Fife, the son of Margaret Millar, though Spence is an Orcadian name and local tradition has it that his family hailed from the Orkney Isles. On 19 August 1684 he was said to be aged about thirty-three. He had a brother, Thomas, and four sisters. About 1676-7 he entered the service of Sir Daniel Carmichael, in whose employ he remained for about a year, before becoming secretary to the earl of Argyll. He served as courier for Argyll at the time of the Rye House plot and Monmouth rebellion, operating under the name of Butler. He travelled to London in October 1682, possibly to meet with the English dissidents who were planning an insurrection, and left for the Netherlands on 8 November, where Argyll, by now a condemned traitor who had fled justice, had taken refuge. Spence was back in London by June 1683, and was apprehended at his lodgings at the Pewter Pot, in Leadenhall Street, on the early morning of the 27th, following the arrest the day before of Major Abraham Holmes, who was taken in possession of a number of ciphered letters from Argyll which he said he had received from Butler (Spence). Spence insisted he knew nothing of any political plots, claiming that he was a student of divinity at the College of Utrecht and had come to London to buy books, though he did admit that he recognized one of the letters to be in Argyll's hand. 
Spence was imprisoned in the Marshalsea in heavy irons, but he continued to protest his innocence and so was deported to Scotland in November 1683, where the government had the option of using torture. Although Charles II wrote to his Scottish council ordaining Spence to be put to the boots 'to extort a discoverie of the late designes' ('Historical Notices', ed. Laing, 463), and despite the fact that Holmes, in his examination of December 1683, had revealed that Spence knew how to decipher Argyll's letters, the Scottish chancellor, the earl of Aberdeen, refused to put Spence to the question. English experts managed to decipher enough of the correspondence to confirm that it contained highly incriminating material, and, following the replacement of Aberdeen as chancellor by the earl of Perth and the receipt of a further letter from Charles II in the summer of 1684 authorizing torture, the Scottish council finally decided to proceed against Spence. Torture could be used in Scotland in capital cases when there was a solid presumption of guilt but only one witness to the crime, instead of the required two (the so-called 'semiplena probatio', or half-proof). However, enduring the torture was supposed to purge one of all suspicion; the suspect was not to be put to the torture again. There was no half-proof against Spence for a capital offence, but he was subjected to three different types of torture on different occasions: first, on 26 July 1684, he was put to the boot; then he was deprived of sleep for several days and nights; and finally, on 7 August, he was subjected to the thumbscrews. At last he agreed to co-operate. He helped decipher a letter written by Argyll from the Netherlands dated 21 June 1683 which talked about plans for a co-ordinated uprising in Scotland and England, and although he was probably telling the truth when he said that he did not know what was in it, he nevertheless confessed that he did 'truly believe there was an Insurrection intended', the grounds being 'the defence of the Protestant Religion' and 'the Liberties of the Kingdom' (Mackenzie, 26). 
After a brief spell in Dumbarton Castle, Spence was set at liberty in January 1685, whereupon he rejoined Argyll and the exiled dissident community in the Netherlands, becoming secretary to Argyll's council of war. In early February he was arrested at Harwich, posing as an art buyer, carrying letters from English malcontents in Utrecht, though the letters appear to have been devoid of political information (the more important messages were to be transmitted orally) and he was soon released. Later that month, back in the Low Countries, he sent a letter to the duke of Monmouth in Brussels informing him that Argyll was preparing to launch an invasion and inviting him to lend his support. Spence sailed with Argyll's invasion force in May, which stopped first at the Orkney Isles, where Spence, who had an uncle living at Kirkwall, was sent ashore to enlist recruits. Spence was captured along with his co-conspirator, Dr William Blackader, and the pair were subsequently sent as prisoners to Edinburgh in early June. Spence was tried for treason on 16 July 1685, found guilty, and condemned to be hanged on 22 July, but was reprieved at the intercession of Lord Dumbarton in the hope that he might be made use of to make a fuller discovery of the plot or to secure convictions against other leading Scottish malcontents. According to Robert Wodrow, he remained in prison until the revolution; he was certainly still in custody in April 1686, though he may have been free by August 1687, when 'two parcels containing scandalous libels against the King and his Government' ('CSP dom.', '1687-9', 61) and intended for William Spence or his assigns were found on board a ship recently arrived in England from the Netherlands. 
After the revolution, the Williamite regime made some attempt to compensate Spence for his sufferings. In January 1690 he was appointed principal warden of the mint in Scotland, and in December of the following year receiver-general of the bullion: positions which together probably carried a salary of $1250 Scots. Marriage followed position and income, and on 17 October 1692 Spence married Jean Alexander, the widow of an Edinburgh brewer named Alexander Inglis. Spence died in 1699: he was explicitly described as deceased when the successors to his offices were appointed on 26 October. Twelve years later his widow and son William sought (eventually successfully) to be released from a debt of $310 still owing to the crown on Spence's account as receiver-general, pleading against it $160 that he had spent in 1691 in getting the instruments and materials necessary for setting up the mint in Scotland, and also that he had died leaving his widow with several small children unprovided for. The clause in the 'Scottish Claim of Right' (1689) regulating the use of torture was in part a response to the treatment meted out to Spence in 1684.

Fage, Arthur (1890-1977), aerodynamicist, was born on 4 March 1890 at Portsmouth, the youngest in a family of two sons and two daughters born to William John Fage (1859-1947), coppersmith at Portsmouth Dockyard, and his wife, Annie Crook (1862-1943). Educated at Portsmouth secondary school from 1901 to 1904, Fage successfully competed for a shipwright apprenticeship at Portsmouth Dockyard, where he met Ernest Relf (1888-1970), who was to become his lifelong friend and professional colleague. The dockyard apprenticeships, combining practice with study at the Royal Dockyard School, provided a thorough and rigorous training. Fage survived the course, carried off three Admiralty prizes, and spent his fifth year at the Haslar ship tank, with evening classes at Portsmouth Municipal College, where he won prizes for mathematics and theoretical mechanics. In 1909 he won a royal exhibition to the Royal College of Science, South Kensington, where he chose to specialize in mechanics. He enjoyed sports, played football and cricket, and for many years was an enthusiastic long-distance walker, touring in England, Scotland, Germany, and Switzerland. 
At the end of three years Fage, who had achieved the highest marks in all subjects and a first class associateship of the Royal College of Science, was offered a research scholarship tenable at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Teddington, to work on a topic allied to aeronautics. Relf had preceded him as a junior assistant in the aeronautics section, and Fage joined for a two-year spell as student assistant, assigned to a variety of projects. He obtained his diploma of Imperial College in 1914 and, as the First World War coincided with the end of his studentship, he was formally appointed to the staff of the NPL. 
At this time the science of aerodynamics was ill-defined, its components, such as fluid mechanics, pressure distribution on the ground and on aircraft and airships in flight, and its effect on their structure and component materials, little known. Fage and his colleagues undertook research on many of these aspects. During 1914 he wrote a popular book, 'The Aeroplane' (1915), into which he managed to compress the whole of aeronautical engineering, with little mathematics. The book was immediately popular; by 1918 it was in its fifth edition and had also been published in the USA. After the war Fage continued his investigations into the theory and practical engineering of airscrews and published extensively; in 1917-18 he had lectured around Britain. He became ultimately a world authority on this topic. This expertise led to his specialist monograph, 'Airscrews in Theory and Experiment' (1920). He married on 1 September 1920 a colleague from the NPL physics department, Winifred Eliza (died 1951), a botany graduate and daughter of Thomas H. Donnelly, master builder, of Kimberley, Nottinghamshire. It was a most happy marriage. Their son, John Donnelly Fage ('b'. 1921), rose to eminence as a professor of African history; their daughter, Christine Mary Fage, later Richards ('b'. 1924), joined the staff of the University of Durham. 
By 1925 Fage had turned to the extremely complex problem of pure fluid mechanics and turbulence. He had already looked at the lift and drag, slipstream effects, and wake turbulence set up by aerofoils; now he concentrated on experimental work associated with these movements, both in free air and within pipes. With H. C. H. Townend he devised the fluid motion microscope, which enabled him to study under high magnification the movement of illuminated ultramicroscopic particles in turbulent water, and to apply the results to similar motions in air. This fruitful research was publicized in numerous papers in the aeronautical and scientific literature, and in his many lectures. It brought Fage, since 1918 a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, the Edward Busk memorial prize (1928), founder membership of the (American) Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences (1933), corresponding membership of the Lilienthal Gesellschaft fur Luftfahrtforschung (1937) -- he travelled to Berlin in 1936 and Munich in 1937 -- and, in 1942, election to the Royal Society. 
With the outbreak of the Second World War and the arrival of high-speed aircraft, Fage and his colleagues at the NPL were confronted with problems of transonic and supersonic flow. On 1 January 1946 he succeeded Relf as superintendent of the aerodynamics division. New wind tunnels were built to assist with problems of high-speed aerodynamics, in which he took a close interest. However, administrative duties precluded any further personal research, for much of his time was spent on committee work with the Aeronautical Research Council, various government departments, and aircraft companies, and necessarily involved lengthy overseas travel. Following the death of his wife in 1951 Fage lost his zest for work, and he retired from the NPL in June 1953, being then appointed CBE. He continued to travel abroad, and about 1955 moved to Winchelsea, where he took up painting. He returned to Teddington for five years, then gave up his committee work and moved to Yockleton, Shropshire, to be near his daughter. He died at Yockleton Grange on 7 November 1977. An obituarist summed him up as 'one who had led a full life, and had done more than most men. He was widely respected, and held in high esteem and indeed affection by the colleagues of his later years and by others close to him' (Collar, 49).

Shute, Richard (d. 1660), merchant and local politician, was a resident of St Lawrence Jewry in or before 1629. In that year his infant son was baptized there, the first of three of his children whose baptisms were recorded in the parish register, but nothing is known about the family or geographical origins of Shute or his wife, Mary. In the early 1630s Shute served as a sidesman and collector for the poor in St Lawrence Jewry. A member of the Haberdashers' Company, he was apparently not as prosperous in his early career as he later became. In a London assessment of 1638 he was rated with the middling sort, and a political detractor ridiculed him in 1643 as 'that broken citizen, out at elbowes, called Satten Shute' ('Letter from Mercurius Civicus', 4.596). 
Some time before 1640 Shute seems to have become a factor for Maurice Thompson (or Thomson), an interloping colonial trader and one of the most notable London merchants of the era. Thereafter Shute became highly visible among the new colonial merchants who gained commercial and political ascendancy in London during the civil war years: in 1642 he became a commissioner for the 'additional sea adventure' to Ireland, an enterprise in which numerous investors undertook to raise a military expedition in return for lands confiscated from Irish rebels; and the following year he became collector of tonnage and poundage for the port of London. In 1647 Shute and Thompson were part of a syndicate that sought to replace the existing customs commission, and in 1648 they were involved in a contract for provisioning the army in Ireland. By the late 1640s the geographical scope of Shute's commercial interests had extended to Brazil, to the East Indies (as an interloper), and possibly to the Guinea-West Indies slave trade. In 1648 one of several ships of which he was part owner was lost to the Dutch off the coast of Brazil with a cargo valued at $30,000. 
Shute emerged as a militant London puritan spokesman in the early 1640s. In September 1640 he and Thompson presented a petition, which they had promoted in the City, to Charles I at York. Reportedly bearing 10,000 signatures, it demanded a meeting of parliament and an end to the regime's fiscal and religious innovations. When relations between the king and the leadership of the Commons collapsed in January 1642, Shute was named to the London militia committee, and he also served as treasurer of the parliamentary committee of safety. He worked with Lord Mayor Isaac Penington to assist John Pym and the Commons leaders in organizing their war effort. 
With Sir David Watkins, Randall Mainwaring, and others, Shute presented petitions to the Commons in November and December 1642 that condemned efforts at reconciliation with the king and deplored the inadequate organization of the parliamentarian army. The petitioners offered to raise a London cavalry troop and Shute became active in raising funds for it. The petitioners also proposed two innovations for financing the war. The first of these was the system of weekly assessments in London that was quickly adopted by parliament and extended throughout the country; Shute served as a treasurer for the weekly assessments in London. The second proposal, which encouraged the imposition of reparations on active royalists, was not fully adopted until 1644. Shute was eventually appointed to the commission for compounding with royalists who were delinquent in paying their fines. 
The culmination of Shute's petitioning activities came on 30 March 1643 when he and his associates presented a further 'petition and remonstrance' to common council and to parliament. Their offer to raise and finance volunteer troops was accepted by parliament, and the committee established at Salters' Hall to superintend this endeavour superseded Shute's earlier military fund-raising. The language of the remonstrance reflected the advanced constitutional position occupied by Shute and his friends. Anticipating some of the Leveller programme, it asserted that 'originally the Supreme power' was 'in the whole people' and that annual parliaments should exercise that power in trust, without royal restraint, for the peace and safety of the kingdom ('Remonstrans Redivivus', 4). 
Shute was less active after 1643, having been reprimanded by the Commons in December 1642 for his intemperate denunciation of a London peace petition. He was a member of the vestry for the parish of St Katharine Cree in 1644-6, and in 1645-8 he was a trier in the London classis of the reformed national church. However, Shute's association with London Independent clergy such as Jeremiah Burroughs, John Goodwin, and Hugh Peters during the petitions of 1642-3 suggests that his identification with the national establishment was weakening. He was an author of the 1647 'Declaration by Congregational Societies in, and about the City of London', which sought to distance religious Independency from the Levellers. 
After the New Model Army's intervention in London in 1648 Shute was returned to the common council for the ward of Langbourn in 1649 and 1650. He was a prominent civic friend of the army leadership and served on new commissions for the London militia and assessments and for the navy and customs. He supported the revolution in city politics that transferred power from the lord mayor and aldermen to the common council, and he was a member of a civic delegation to the Rump Parliament that demanded that Charles I be held accountable for warring against the nation. He was twice nominated for the court of aldermen in 1649 and was nominated again in 1651, but he was not elected. He sat on a court that tried prominent royalists in 1649, and was appointed to the high courts of justice of the Commonwealth and protectorate in 1650, 1653, and 1654. He was one of the signatories of another declaration of the London independent churches in 1651. In 1653 Shute and two partners made an unsuccessful proposal to take over the foreign post for England, Scotland, and Ireland. 
Shute was apparently still in England in 1658, but he died in 1660, between 2 August, when he made his will, and 25 October, when it was proved, 'in parts beyond the seas'. He had perhaps emigrated or fled after the Restoration (Blagg, 544).

Shepherd, Thomas (fl. 1677-1694), merchant and conspirator, was active in the City of London from at least 1677. Nothing is known of Shepherd's origins or family. A liveryman of the Mercers' Company, he imported wine from Portugal and the Canary Islands, and linen and whale products from Hamburg. 
Shepherd was an Independent in religion, probably a follower of the Independent divine Robert Ferguson. His signature on the May 1679 London petition on behalf of a protestant succession appeared adjacent to those of fellow Independent merchants George Boddington and Edward Bushell. By 1680-81 he was 'looked upon as a man of the greatest interest in the City' ('CSP dom.', 'July-Sept 1683', 327). His substantial residence in London's Abchurch Lane was a frequent whig meeting-place, and he also possessed a country seat at Bromley. Shepherd served on the common council for Candlewick ward in 1681, and in May of that year he offered to serve as sheriff of London and Middlesex. When the civic electorate chose other whig sheriffs for 1681-2, Shepherd was instead elected city bridgemaster. He was impanelled with whig colleagues for the London grand jury in August 1681, and he served on the special jury that rejected the government's treason case against the earl of Shaftesbury in November of that year. 
When Shaftesbury and other leading whigs plotted against Charles II in autumn 1682, they turned to Shepherd as their principal city agent. He may have been a relative of the earl's gentleman servant, Anthony Shepherd. He helped Shaftesbury find secret lodging when the earl went underground, and he was regarded as 'the only honest man in London to be entrusted with a bank of money' to finance a rebellion ('CSP dom.', '1683-4', 227). A critical meeting of the duke of Monmouth, Lord William Russell, Ford, Lord Grey, Sir Thomas Armstrong, Colonel John Rumsey, and Robert Ferguson took place at Shepherd's city house in early November 1682. According to Grey and Ferguson, those in attendance agreed to stage an insurrection on 19 November to check what they perceived as a drift towards arbitrary rule. Grey recalled that Shepherd was helpful in identifying places in the city that would need to be secured. During the evening Alderman Henry Cornish, a cloth factor with whom Shepherd regularly did business, made a brief appearance. These plans for revolt came to nothing, however, when a second gathering at Shepherd's house concluded that preparations could not be completed in time. 
Shepherd remained a pivotal figure in the plotting that continued on the margins of the London whig movement until June 1683. He was in touch with Algernon Sidney and a group of whig grandees who conspired against Charles, beginning in January 1683. After receiving a letter from Shepherd, Robert Ferguson, who had fled with Shaftesbury to the Netherlands, returned to England and to plotting. Shepherd was intimate with attorney Robert West's conspiratorial cabal: they divulged to him their plan to assassinate Charles at the Rye House in Hertfordshire. Shepherd claimed to have discouraged this design out of respect for Monmouth, who may have desired the throne, but who did not desire his father's death. Shepherd also acted as intermediary between Monmouth and a group of disaffected Scotsmen, including the earl of Argyll, who hoped to organize a Scottish rebellion. They intended to lodge their funds with Shepherd, but Shepherd later denied having received any money from them. Lord Grey, on the other hand, subsequently suggested that Shepherd had received money from Russell that was intended for Argyll. Indeed, Grey thought Shepherd had raised money from Cornish and other citizens by threatening to accuse them unless they contributed. 
After the disclosure of whig plotting to the government, Shepherd surrendered. He utilized his loyalist kinsman Sir Nathaniel Johnson to intercede for a pardon in exchange for his testimony, said to have been 'the most particular account' among the early confessions ('CSP dom.', 'Jan-June 1683', 348). Shepherd gave evidence about Lord Russell's presence at his house during the plotting of November 1682. As a business acquaintance of Algernon Sidney, he was called upon to verify that the manuscript of the 'Discourses Concerning Government' was in Sidney's hand. He also provided a deposition for the Scottish trial of Robert Baillie of Jerviswood. 
Contemporary characterizations of Shepherd's role in the whig treason trials differ. Gilbert Burnet was highly critical of Shepherd's testimony about Lord Russell, and Colonel Thomas Walcott blamed his capture and death on Shepherd. Roger North remembered that Shepherd had been rebuffed by Charles II in offering to spy on his former associates on condition that his co-operation with the government was kept secret (North, 383). On the other hand, Lord Grey, who may have been involved in a plan to silence Shepherd by having him murdered, also credited Shepherd with not fully divulging evidence against 'several of our best and ablest friends' (Grey, 74). In fact, the government suspected that Shepherd had not been fully forthcoming. He appeared on behalf of Henry Cornish in the alderman's 1685 trial and insisted, despite close questioning, that Cornish had been unaware of the plotting underway during his visit to Shepherd's house in November 1682. 
Shepherd continued to trade after the whig treason trials, but he was much less visible in the city. He was confined with other leading London whigs and dissenters at the time of Monmouth's rebellion, but quickly released upon the order of James II. In 1689 he was among those London citizens who lent money to William of Orange, both before and after William's elevation to the English throne. He was probably the Thomas Shepherd who purchased $2000 of the original stock of the Bank of England in 1694 and who also owned some $4000 of East India Company stock. Shepherd is untraceable thereafter.

Rumsey, John (fl. 1660-1686), conspirator, is of unknown parentage, and served as a cornet in the New Model Army. After the Restoration he served with English forces in Portugal for seven years under Lord Schomberg, achieving the rank of lieutenant-colonel. According to Burnet 'he did a brave action in that service, and Schomberg writ a particular letter to the king setting it out' ('Burnet's History', 2.357). Rumsey returned from Lisbon in 1667. Following a trip to Jersey in late February he was ordered to join the forces fighting the Dutch. When they were disbanded several months later his return to Portugal was delayed by illness. In 1669, while awaiting another military assignment, Rumsey was awarded an allowance of $200 a year to be paid out of Queen Catherine's portion for his former 'merit and behaviour' in his majesty's services ('CSP dom.', '1668-9', 152). By April 1673 he had become the collector of customs at Bristol on the recommendation of the earl of Clarendon. In 1675 Rumsey wrote to Secretary Williamson warning the court of 'the disadvantage that the persecution' of Bristol dissenters would bring upon his majesty ('CSP dom.', '1673-5', 517). While in Bristol, Rumsey married Anna Smyth, the widow of his friend Sir Hugh Smyth. She was the daughter of the royalist John Ashburnham. 
By 1670 Rumsey had become acquainted with the first earl of Shaftesbury and was active in the latter's mining enterprises. At one point he was the chief steward of the mines with a salary of $100 and a free share of the company. In the late 1670s and early 1680s, as Shaftesbury increasingly became the vortex of opposition, Rumsey was ever by his side. Burnet described him as one of 'lord Shaftesbury's creatures' ('Burnet's History', 2.373). The Scottish conspirator William Carstares called Rumsey and Robert Ferguson Shaftesbury's 'retainers' ('State Papers and Letters Addressed to William Carstares', Edinburgh, 1774, 9). Amid the exclusion crisis Rumsey moved to Soho and joined the notorious Green Ribbon Club. In 1680 he helped to plan the duke of Monmouth's west country progress. He also went to Bristol with Shaftesbury and Monmouth to help Nathaniel Wade organize the whigs there. 
In summer and autumn 1682 Rumsey and Ferguson served as Shaftesbury's envoys to a small circle of whig leaders, including William, Lord Russell, Lord Grey of Werk, Colonel Algernon Sidney, Arthur Capel, earl of Essex, and Lord Howard of Escrick, as well as a larger cabal of former soldiers, barristers, and artisans. According to later confessions in those months a series of discussions took place concerning the leading of a general insurrection against the government. Rumsey and Wade were to lead the rising in Bristol; Monmouth and Russell in Cheshire; John Trenchard in Taunton, and lords Howard and Grey in Essex. But in December Shaftesbury learned that the government was preparing to arrest him and he went into hiding. A month later he left England for the last time, seeking refuge in Amsterdam and taking Rumsey, Ferguson, and Captain Thomas Walcott with him. 
After Shaftesbury's death in January 1683 his servants returned to London and the discussion of sedition among the whig conspirators was revived. Further, more serious consideration was now given to a plan to assassinate Charles II and his Catholic brother, the duke of York, at Rye House mill as they returned from the races at Newmarket ['see also 'Rye House plotters]. According to Burnet 'Rumsey, Ferguson, and West were often talking of the danger to executing this [an insurrection], and that the shorter and surer way was to kill the two brothers' ('Burnet's History', 2.359). All their talk, however, came to nothing, when, on June 12, their plans were betrayed to Secretary Jenkins by one of their own, Josiah Keeling. 
Aware that their discussions had been exposed several of the plotters including Rumsey met one last time on 17 June. Nathaniel Wade proposed that they immediately muster what men they could and lead a rising 'here or in the west to die like men than be hanged like dogs'. But Rumsey flatly declared that their situation was hopeless, 'The hearts of the people are down and our great men are good for nothing' ('State trials', 9.409). On 23 June a proclamation offered a reward of $100 apiece for the apprehension of Rumsey, Walcott, Wade, and others. The next day Rumsey surrendered to the duke of Albemarle and was interrogated by the privy council. As an associate of Shaftesbury's he may have felt he was a marked man and so along with the barrister Robert West he began to recount the story of the Rye House plot, as it soon became known. Charles II himself examined Rumsey on 27 June. 
According to Ormond, Rumsey was 'highly obligated by the King and the Duke that he has made himself a good fortune... and he seemed to me to be more concerned for the infamy of such ingratitude than for his own life, of which all men say he was upon service very little careful' ('Ormonde MSS', new ser., 7.53-4). Rumsey also faced family pressure. The week of his arrest his wife, Anna, was extremely sick and her daughter, Elizabeth Smyth, persuaded Rumsey to confess all he knew for her mother's sake. In the subsequent treason trials Rumsey testified against Captain Walcott, Lord Russell, and Algernon Sidney, all three of whom were executed. Rumsey was also used as a witness, following Monmouth's failed rebellion, in the trials of Henry Cornish and Lord Brandon in 1685. In July 1686 Rumsey tried to bribe a yearly pension out of Thomas Grey, earl of Stamford, a former associate of Shaftesbury's, in return for which Rumsey agreed to withhold evidence of Stamford's complicity in the Rye House plot. Both were arrested, and Stamford was committed to the Tower though he was eventually pardoned. 
Needless to say Rumsey's willingness to turn king's evidence earned him a poor reputation among fellow whigs. Burnet recounted how Lord Russell had told him that every time he saw Rumsey 'he felt such a secret aversion to him, that he was in no danger of trusting him much'. Burnet and others also asserted that Rumsey was 'a spy of the court's which some suspected he was all along' ('Burnet's History', 2.357-8). Fellow conspirator Richard Rumbold declared, 'I am convinced [Rumsey] hath been the Duke of Yorks spie and trepan managed by the Duke of Beaufort ever since he was the little Lords privado' (TNA: PRO, SP 29/430/16). Apparently the court never trusted Rumsey either. He was excepted from James II's general pardon in March 1686 and sent to St Nicholas Island a month later for the remainder of his life.

Row, John (fl. 1666-1702), conspirator, was admitted to the Merchant Venturers of Bristol on 15 October 1666 and became the city's sword-bearer in 1677, a position that gave him a prominent role in civic ceremony and access to influential people. Almost nothing is known of his background. In January 1680 the privy council issued a warrant for the arrest of Row and the Bristol clothier Joseph Tiley on charges of spreading seditious news in Bristol, but in the absence of witnesses they were released after posting bonds for good behaviour. In October 1680 Row accused the aldermen Sir Robert Canne and Sir Robert Yeamans (the former also one of Bristol's MPs) of denying the Popish Plot while insisting on a presbyterian conspiracy. Sir John Knight the elder, formerly mayor of Bristol (1663-4), and the city's other MP, corroborated Row's charge in the House of Commons, where Row testified at the bar. Both men, Row insisted, were tools of the marquess of Worcester, a staunch royalist who had previously had Row hauled before the privy council for his remarks in Bristol. Canne was briefly imprisoned and expelled from the house, whereas Yeamans apologized and was fined. In May 1681 the Bristol council dismissed Row as sword-bearer on the grounds that he had reproached several persons of quality and had refused to return from London when summoned, but he regained his office by a writ of mandamus. The council again ousted him in January 1682, though he apparently recovered his office. His business dealings must have taken him to London rather frequently, for he was a member of both the Green Ribbon Club in London and Bristol's Horseshoe (formerly the White Hart) Club, as were Tiley and Colonel John Rumsey. 
By the autumn of 1682 Row had become involved in a plot to assassinate the king and was meeting with several of its principal architects, Robert West, Robert Ferguson, Richard Goodenough, and Rumsey. Tiley was also engaged. Rumsey had apparently recruited Row, to whom he gave money and clothing for two years, and with whom he dined regularly until Christmas 1682, though Rumsey would subsequently insist he first learned of the conspiracy from Row. West would later confess that in the autumn of 1682 Row boasted that he and his friends had 500 men prepared to ride into Bristol in an uprising, but Row was prone to exaggeration. Row subsequently claimed to have seen a letter in canting language from West or Nathaniel Wade discussing the assassination of Charles and James. With John Gibbons, Monmouth's footman, Row reconnoitred Covent Garden as a possible site for the assassination. Row would later claim Monmouth knew of the plot in the spring of 1683. 
Following Josiah Keeling's disclosure of the plotting and Rumsey's arrest (24 June 1683), several conspirators wanted to drown Row to prevent him from confessing, or so he thought. Sir John Trenchard, with whom he had discussed the assassination scheme, insisted he flee to the continent, giving him $50 and a horse on which to escape. Twice more he was threatened with death by his fellow conspirators: the first time by Sir Thomas Armstrong at Cleves and the second by Captain John Matthews, Trenchard's aide. When Row threatened to inform unless he received additional money, Wade, Ferguson, and Richard Nelthorp acquiesced. For a time Row stayed with Edmund Ludlow at Vevey, Switzerland. In the meantime the government, having three witnesses, indicted him on 12 July. The Merchant Venturers consequently disenfranchised him on 15 October 1683; for speaking derogatorily of royalists in Bristol, he had again been dismissed as sword-bearer on 31 May 1683. During the planning for the Monmouth invasion, Row, as he subsequently attested, claimed hundreds of Swiss officers and gentry were prepared to enlist and equip 10,000 Swiss soldiers if Ludlow would command them, but Ferguson, Wade, and others allegedly declined on the grounds that such help was unnecessary; Row was undoubtedly fabricating. The following year he and three others claimed they had $12,000 to invest in the cloth manufactory sponsored by the exiles and the Dutch at Leeuwarden, but this too must have been a lie. 
Row returned to England in November 1688, or so he asserted. His claim may be valid, for on 28 August 1689, following his petition eight days earlier, he was appointed king's waiter at the port of Bristol and given a salary of $15 p.a. By December 1690 he had detected custom fraud involving tobacco importers who had cheated the government of $5000-6000 in the past year alone. He unsuccessfully petitioned for the surveyorship of the port of Bristol as his reward. The merchants settled for $2772 the following May, of which Row received $263 16's'. 6died for his role. On 18 April 1691 he had demanded the restoration of his membership in the Merchant Venturers, but his request was denied. So too was his attempt to regain his office of sword-bearer in Michaelmas term 1691; he sued and eventually received $100 in compensation (1695). In July 1692 Row was suspended as king's waiter after his wife accepted a bribe of $10 to persuade him not to inform against a merchant who had imported cocoa nuts in the guise of indigo. A penitent Row petitioned for restoration, which was granted on 1 March 1693. On 30 June 1702, one Maurice Houston was appointed queen's waiter in Row's place, but Houston's letters patent were superseded on 3 July. By this time Row was presumably too infirm to continue his duties or had died.

Cragg, Robert (fl. 1682-1689), conspirator and rebel, made three journeys between London and the Netherlands, under the alias of John Smith, in March-April of 1685, carrying messages between the surviving whig opposition in England and the exiled duke of Monmouth, who was preparing his ill-fated rebellion of June-July 1685. These communications carried by Cragg had a material impact upon the form which the rebellion took, and upon its outcome. Cragg was well suited to the role of messenger because he was, at the time, a minor figure and completely unknown to the government and its agents. He was an associate of the radical printer William Disney from about 1682 and seems to have made at least part of his living by distributing subversive pamphlets. In 1684 he was spreading a pamphlet which alleged that the whig earl of Essex had not committed suicide in the Tower before his trial in 1683, but had been murdered by government order. In 1684 he also ferried materials for another pamphlet on this dangerous subject to Amsterdam, to the radical preacher Robert Ferguson, and this experience in smuggling subversive material also recommended him for his missions in 1685. 
At the beginning of March 1685 Disney paid Cragg to take an oral message to the duke of Monmouth in Amsterdam asking whether he intended to participate in the earl of Argyll's planned rebellion in the highlands, word of which had reached the radicals in England. In his confession written after the rebellion Cragg claimed that he did no more than deliver this message to Ferguson (who was acting for Monmouth), and that he did not see the duke. Other accounts, also confessions written after the rebellion, assert that Cragg not only saw Monmouth but went well beyond his instructions, saying that there would be much support, in men and money, if Monmouth invaded England while Argyll raised Scotland. Possibly Ferguson (who strongly wanted a rebellion) conveyed a lying account of his interview with Cragg to the duke, who was still uncertain whether a rebellion should be attempted. In any case Cragg then made two further journeys between London and Amsterdam during March and April, each time now conveying negative messages from England that there was no money or support to be had there and that Monmouth would do better to join with Argyll's venture, and returning with angry demands from the duke for money, armed men, and co-ordinated action from his former supporters. Cragg gives a telling account of the fear, incompetence, and lack of trust which prevented many potential allies from supporting the 1685 rebellion, so contributing to its failure. 
As the venture came to its end at Sedgemoor, Cragg experienced a personal tragedy with the death of his wife and child. He did not escape abroad and was arrested in December 1685. There were rumours that before his arrest he had blackmailed prominent whigs contacted before the rebellion, and one exile wished that Cragg had been killed to silence him. However, though Cragg was held in prison for nine months and put under considerable pressure, his confession failed directly to incriminate surviving whig grandees such as Lord Delamere and the earl of Macclesfield, as James II undoubtedly hoped it would. After the 1688 revolution he was questioned by the privy council as to whether he had, in fact, been suborned to testify against these men. At the same time he was applying for assistance to John Wildman, now postmaster-general and dispenser of much patronage, but to no effect, and after 1689 he is not heard of again.
