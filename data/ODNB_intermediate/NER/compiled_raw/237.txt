Daubeney family (per. c.1225-c.1510), gentry, of Somerset and Bedfordshire, came originally from Brittany, their name deriving from the town of Aubigne in the diocese of Rennes. By the 1220s, in addition to their Breton estates, the family held property in Lincolnshire, around South Ingleby. At some time before 1225, King Henry III granted the Somerset manor of South Petherton to Philip Daubeney, seigneur de Landal (died 1236). This manor soon became their main English seat. In 1236 Philip died in the Holy Land, leaving as his heir a nephew, Sir Ralph Daubeney (died 1292). Sir Ralph was in turn succeeded by his two sons: Sir Philip Daubeney (died 1294) and Elis Daubeney, Lord Daubeney (c.1270-1305). Elis made two significant contributions to the family's interests. First, he determined that their attentions would focus on England rather than his own birthplace of Brittany, their primary sphere of influence hitherto; and in 1295 Edward I granted a charter naturalizing Elis and his heirs in perpetuity. Second, Sir Elis was the first member of the family to rise to a position of national prominence. After serving in Edward I's campaign against the Welsh rebel Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294-5, he received personal summonses to parliament until his death in 1305. He also took an active part in King Edward's campaigns against the Scots. He married Joan, with whom he had twin sons, Sir Ralph Daubeney (c.1304-1378) and Sir William Daubeney ('c'.1304- 'c'.1372). On Sir Elis's death, the crown took possession of most of his lands during Ralph's minority, his Lincolnshire properties being assigned to Joan as her dower. 
In 1326 Ralph Daubeney was granted livery of his family's English estates, while his brother, William, took possession of the Breton properties, becoming seigneur de Landal. Thereafter, these two spheres of Daubeney interest remained separate. Following the outbreak of hostilities with France in 1337, William's branch of the family ran into difficulties as a result of their English associations, and in 1373 Edward III granted Sir William's widow, Phillipa, $50 per annum until she recovered her Breton lands, which had been confiscated owing to her alleged English allegiance. Ralph, by contrast, had no such difficulties and went on to carve out a successful career. Like his father he served in the wars in Scotland, where he was knighted and appointed a knight-banneret. At some time after 1330 he was taken prisoner by the Scots and was not released until October 1337. Despite this setback, Ralph resumed his career upon release and in February 1342 was admitted to the royal council, though he apparently never received an individual writ of summons to parliament. In 1346 he fought in the bishop of Durham's retinue at Crecy, and he subsequently took part in the successful siege of Calais. Ralph was married twice: his first wife was Alice, daughter of William Montagu, second Lord Montagu, of Shepton Montague, Somerset (died 1319), and his second was Katherine, daughter of Marmaduke (III) Thwing, first Lord Thwing (d. 1323) ['see under 'Thwing, Sir Robert (III) (d. 1245x)]. 
Sir Ralph Daubeney was succeeded by Sir Giles [i] Daubeney (c.1333-1386), his son from his first marriage. Even before his father's death, Giles had begun building up his own estates, in 1357 purchasing the manors of Kempston, Bedfordshire, and Tottenham, Middlesex, for 200 marks from his uncle, Sir William Daubeney. These properties subsequently provided the descendants of Giles [i] with an important secondary sphere of influence, and in the years before his father's death Giles was active in Bedfordshire administration, serving as a justice of oyer and terminer there several times in the 1370s, and as sheriff in 1379-80. Thereafter, having received his inheritance in 1378, his interests returned to his native Somerset, and he served as MP from 1382 to 1384. He died in June 1386 at his manor of Barrington, near South Petherton. His commitment to his midland estates is, however, suggested by the fact that he was buried at Kempston. 
If the Daubeneys' decline from the heights of influence which Sir Elis had scaled was relatively slow during the seventy years after his death, in subsequent decades it accelerated, largely owing to the minorities and early deaths which beset the family from the late fourteenth century. In 1358 Sir Giles [i] Daubeney had married Alianore, daughter of Sir Henry Willington of Umberleigh, Devon. The marriage produced a son, Sir Giles [ii] Daubeney (1370-1403), aged sixteen at his father's death. During his minority his lands were farmed by Margaret Courtenay, countess of Devon, while his marriage was granted to Thomas Lee, one of the king's esquires. In 1390 Giles [ii] was assigned $20 per annum from his lands for his maintenance, and at the end of 1391 he was granted livery. Over the following years he was active in Bedfordshire, where he served as sheriff in 1394-5 and again in 1400. He died in 1403 at Kempston, where he was buried. From his marriage to Margaret, daughter of Sir John Beauchamp (died 1388?), Giles had two sons. The elder was John Daubeney (c.1394-1409), whose wardship the king granted to his consort, Joan of Navarre. John married Elizabeth, daughter of the Yorkshire knight Roger Scrope, but died in 1409 before he could produce any offspring. His heir was his younger brother, Sir Giles [iii] Daubeney (1399-1446). 
By the time Giles [iii] Daubeney took possession of his inheritance, minorities had deprived his family of more than twenty years' estate income and prevented them from playing the active role in local and national affairs which, a century before, had enabled Sir Elis and Sir Ralph temporarily to elevate the Daubeneys above the county gentry. By these minorities they had also been denied the opportunity to benefit from royal patronage, or to profit in the land and marriage markets. Their position began to improve after Sir Giles [iii] took possession of the family lands in 1416. Within two years he was in France, and campaigned there until 1421, but was apparently not among the beneficiaries of the Lancastrian land settlement in Normandy and returned to England in order to enhance his existing interests. Most of his official activities were connected with Somerset, where he served as sheriff in 1426, MP in 1424-5 and 1429, and on a variety of 'ad hoc' commissions from the late 1420s. He was also active in the administration of Bedfordshire (where he had been born), serving as sheriff there in 1431-2. He also expanded his estates. After the death of his first wife, Joan, daughter of Philip, Lord Darcy (died 1399), Giles married Mary, daughter and coheir of Simon Leke of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, thereby acquiring the manors of Cotham and Hawton and tenements in Newark. 
Upon his death in 1446, Sir Giles [iii] Daubeney was succeeded by his eldest son with his first wife, Sir William Daubeney (1424-1461), who followed his father in marrying an heiress, in his case Alice ('b'. 1432), daughter and coheir of John Stourton (d. 1438) of Preston Plucknett, Somerset ['see under 'Stourton family]. As a result of this marriage, considerable estates in Somerset, worth in excess of $80 per annum and including the manors of Yeovilton, Speckington, and Bridgehampton, came to the family. Having been knighted, William served as MP for Bedfordshire in 1448-9 and as sheriff of Cornwall in 1452-3, but does not appear to have been personally involved in the factional strife then besetting the government of Henry VI. Indeed, after 1453 Sir William performed no further official service, perhaps being content to keep his head below the parapet. 
Sir William's son and heir was altogether less reticent, and raised the family's fortunes to their medieval pinnacle. Giles Daubeney, first Baron Daubeney (1451/2-1508), was brought up a Yorkist and served Edward IV, but rebelled against Richard III in 1483 and fled to Brittany where he joined Henry Tudor. Having fought at Bosworth, he became one of Henry's closest associates and, through a series of grants, the dominant magnate in the south-west. In March 1486 Henry created him a baron. He served as a councillor, administrator, diplomat, and, from 1495, as lord chamberlain. Contemporary accusations of wavering loyalty during the western rebellion of 1497 (which he nevertheless helped to put down), and the fine imposed on him by the king in 1506, suggest that there were some strains in his relations with Henry. Nevertheless, on his death in May 1508 he was given a splendid funeral in Westminster Abbey, where alabaster effigies of him and his wife survive. He had married, by 1476, Elizabeth, daughter of John Arundel of Lanherne and his second wife, Katherine Chidiock. They had one daughter, Cecily, who married John Bourchier, Lord Fitzwarine, later second earl of Bath (died 1539), and a son, Henry Daubeney, who was created earl of Bridgewater by Henry VIII.

After serving in Edward I's campaign against the Welsh rebel Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294-5, he received personal summonses to parliament until his death in 1305. He also took an active part in King Edward's campaigns against the Scots. He married Joan, with whom he had twin sons, Sir Ralph Daubeney (c.1304-1378) and Sir William Daubeney ('c'.1304- 'c'.1372). On Sir Elis's death, the crown took possession of most of his lands during Ralph's minority, his Lincolnshire properties being assigned to Joan as her dower. 
In 1326 Ralph Daubeney was granted livery of his family's English estates, while his brother, William, took possession of the Breton properties, becoming seigneur de Landal. Thereafter, these two spheres of Daubeney interest remained separate. Following the outbreak of hostilities with France in 1337, William's branch of the family ran into difficulties as a result of their English associations, and in 1373 Edward III granted Sir William's widow, Phillipa, $50 per annum until she recovered her Breton lands, which had been confiscated owing to her alleged English allegiance. Ralph, by contrast, had no such difficulties and went on to carve out a successful career. Like his father he served in the wars in Scotland, where he was knighted and appointed a knight-banneret. At some time after 1330 he was taken prisoner by the Scots and was not released until October 1337.

Sir Ralph Daubeney was succeeded by Sir Giles [i] Daubeney (c.1333-1386), his son from his first marriage. Even before his father's death, Giles had begun building up his own estates, in 1357 purchasing the manors of Kempston, Bedfordshire, and Tottenham, Middlesex, for 200 marks from his uncle, Sir William Daubeney. These properties subsequently provided the descendants of Giles [i] with an important secondary sphere of influence, and in the years before his father's death Giles was active in Bedfordshire administration, serving as a justice of oyer and terminer there several times in the 1370s, and as sheriff in 1379-80. Thereafter, having received his inheritance in 1378, his interests returned to his native Somerset, and he served as MP from 1382 to 1384. He died in June 1386 at his manor of Barrington, near South Petherton. His commitment to his midland estates is, however, suggested by the fact that he was buried at Kempston. 
If the Daubeneys' decline from the heights of influence which Sir Elis had scaled was relatively slow during the seventy years after his death, in subsequent decades it accelerated, largely owing to the minorities and early deaths which beset the family from the late fourteenth century. In 1358 Sir Giles [i] Daubeney had married Alianore, daughter of Sir Henry Willington of Umberleigh, Devon. The marriage produced a son, Sir Giles [ii] Daubeney (1370-1403), aged sixteen at his father's death. During his minority his lands were farmed by Margaret Courtenay, countess of Devon, while his marriage was granted to Thomas Lee, one of the king's esquires. In 1390 Giles [ii] was assigned $20 per annum from his lands for his maintenance, and at the end of 1391 he was granted livery. Over the following years he was active in Bedfordshire, where he served as sheriff in 1394-5 and again in 1400. He died in 1403 at Kempston, where he was buried. From his marriage to Margaret, daughter of Sir John Beauchamp (died 1388?), Giles had two sons. The elder was John Daubeney (c.1394-1409), whose wardship the king granted to his consort, Joan of Navarre. John married Elizabeth, daughter of the Yorkshire knight Roger Scrope, but died in 1409 before he could produce any offspring. His heir was his younger brother, Sir Giles [iii] Daubeney (1399-1446). 
By the time Giles [iii] Daubeney took possession of his inheritance, minorities had deprived his family of more than twenty years' estate income and prevented them from playing the active role in local and national affairs which, a century before, had enabled Sir Elis and Sir Ralph temporarily to elevate the Daubeneys above the county gentry. By these minorities they had also been denied the opportunity to benefit from royal patronage, or to profit in the land and marriage markets. Their position began to improve after Sir Giles [iii] took possession of the family lands in 1416. Within two years he was in France, and campaigned there until 1421, but was apparently not among the beneficiaries of the Lancastrian land settlement in Normandy and returned to England in order to enhance his existing interests. Most of his official activities were connected with Somerset, where he served as sheriff in 1426, MP in 1424-5 and 1429, and on a variety of 'ad hoc' commissions from the late 1420s. He was also active in the administration of Bedfordshire (where he had been born), serving as sheriff there in 1431-2. He also expanded his estates. After the death of his first wife, Joan, daughter of Philip, Lord Darcy (died 1399), Giles married Mary, daughter and coheir of Simon Leke of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, thereby acquiring the manors of Cotham and Hawton and tenements in Newark. 
Upon his death in 1446, Sir Giles [iii] Daubeney was succeeded by his eldest son with his first wife, Sir William Daubeney (1424-1461), who followed his father in marrying an heiress, in his case Alice ('b'. 1432), daughter and coheir of John Stourton (d. 1438) of Preston Plucknett, Somerset ['see under 'Stourton family]. As a result of this marriage, considerable estates in Somerset, worth in excess of $80 per annum and including the manors of Yeovilton, Speckington, and Bridgehampton, came to the family. Having been knighted, William served as MP for Bedfordshire in 1448-9 and as sheriff of Cornwall in 1452-3, but does not appear to have been personally involved in the factional strife then besetting the government of Henry VI. Indeed, after 1453 Sir William performed no further official service, perhaps being content to keep his head below the parapet. 
Sir William's son and heir was altogether less reticent, and raised the family's fortunes to their medieval pinnacle. Giles Daubeney, first Baron Daubeney (1451/2-1508), was brought up a Yorkist and served Edward IV, but rebelled against Richard III in 1483 and fled to Brittany where he joined Henry Tudor. Having fought at Bosworth, he became one of Henry's closest associates and, through a series of grants, the dominant magnate in the south-west. In March 1486 Henry created him a baron. He served as a councillor, administrator, diplomat, and, from 1495, as lord chamberlain. Contemporary accusations of wavering loyalty during the western rebellion of 1497 (which he nevertheless helped to put down), and the fine imposed on him by the king in 1506, suggest that there were some strains in his relations with Henry. Nevertheless, on his death in May 1508 he was given a splendid funeral in Westminster Abbey, where alabaster effigies of him and his wife survive. He had married, by 1476, Elizabeth, daughter of John Arundel of Lanherne and his second wife, Katherine Chidiock. They had one daughter, Cecily, who married John Bourchier, Lord Fitzwarine, later second earl of Bath (died 1539), and a son, Henry Daubeney, who was created earl of Bridgewater by Henry VIII.

Daubeney family (per. c.1225-c.1510), gentry, of Somerset and Bedfordshire, came originally from Brittany, their name deriving from the town of Aubigne in the diocese of Rennes. By the 1220s, in addition to their Breton estates, the family held property in Lincolnshire, around South Ingleby. At some time before 1225, King Henry III granted the Somerset manor of South Petherton to Philip Daubeney, seigneur de Landal (died 1236). This manor soon became their main English seat. In 1236 Philip died in the Holy Land, leaving as his heir a nephew, Sir Ralph Daubeney (died 1292). Sir Ralph was in turn succeeded by his two sons: Sir Philip Daubeney (died 1294) and Elis Daubeney, Lord Daubeney (c.1270-1305). Elis made two significant contributions to the family's interests. First, he determined that their attentions would focus on England rather than his own birthplace of Brittany, their primary sphere of influence hitherto; and in 1295 Edward I granted a charter naturalizing Elis and his heirs in perpetuity. Second, Sir Elis was the first member of the family to rise to a position of national prominence. After serving in Edward I's campaign against the Welsh rebel Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294-5, he received personal summonses to parliament until his death in 1305. He also took an active part in King Edward's campaigns against the Scots. He married Joan, with whom he had twin sons, Sir Ralph Daubeney (c.1304-1378) and Sir William Daubeney ('c'.1304- 'c'.1372). On Sir Elis's death, the crown took possession of most of his lands during Ralph's minority, his Lincolnshire properties being assigned to Joan as her dower. 
In 1326 Ralph Daubeney was granted livery of his family's English estates, while his brother, William, took possession of the Breton properties, becoming seigneur de Landal. Thereafter, these two spheres of Daubeney interest remained separate. Following the outbreak of hostilities with France in 1337, William's branch of the family ran into difficulties as a result of their English associations, and in 1373 Edward III granted Sir William's widow, Phillipa, $50 per annum until she recovered her Breton lands, which had been confiscated owing to her alleged English allegiance. Ralph, by contrast, had no such difficulties and went on to carve out a successful career. Like his father he served in the wars in Scotland, where he was knighted and appointed a knight-banneret. At some time after 1330 he was taken prisoner by the Scots and was not released until October 1337. Despite this setback, Ralph resumed his career upon release and in February 1342 was admitted to the royal council, though he apparently never received an individual writ of summons to parliament. In 1346 he fought in the bishop of Durham's retinue at Crecy, and he subsequently took part in the successful siege of Calais. Ralph was married twice: his first wife was Alice, daughter of William Montagu, second Lord Montagu, of Shepton Montague, Somerset (died 1319), and his second was Katherine, daughter of Marmaduke (III) Thwing, first Lord Thwing (d. 1323) ['see under 'Thwing, Sir Robert (III) (d. 1245x)]. 
Sir Ralph Daubeney was succeeded by Sir Giles [i] Daubeney (c.1333-1386), his son from his first marriage. Even before his father's death, Giles had begun building up his own estates, in 1357 purchasing the manors of Kempston, Bedfordshire, and Tottenham, Middlesex, for 200 marks from his uncle, Sir William Daubeney. These properties subsequently provided the descendants of Giles [i] with an important secondary sphere of influence, and in the years before his father's death Giles was active in Bedfordshire administration, serving as a justice of oyer and terminer there several times in the 1370s, and as sheriff in 1379-80. Thereafter, having received his inheritance in 1378, his interests returned to his native Somerset, and he served as MP from 1382 to 1384. He died in June 1386 at his manor of Barrington, near South Petherton. His commitment to his midland estates is, however, suggested by the fact that he was buried at Kempston. 
If the Daubeneys' decline from the heights of influence which Sir Elis had scaled was relatively slow during the seventy years after his death, in subsequent decades it accelerated, largely owing to the minorities and early deaths which beset the family from the late fourteenth century. In 1358 Sir Giles [i] Daubeney had married Alianore, daughter of Sir Henry Willington of Umberleigh, Devon. The marriage produced a son, Sir Giles [ii] Daubeney (1370-1403), aged sixteen at his father's death. During his minority his lands were farmed by Margaret Courtenay, countess of Devon, while his marriage was granted to Thomas Lee, one of the king's esquires. In 1390 Giles [ii] was assigned $20 per annum from his lands for his maintenance, and at the end of 1391 he was granted livery. Over the following years he was active in Bedfordshire, where he served as sheriff in 1394-5 and again in 1400. He died in 1403 at Kempston, where he was buried. From his marriage to Margaret, daughter of Sir John Beauchamp (died 1388?), Giles had two sons. The elder was John Daubeney (c.1394-1409), whose wardship the king granted to his consort, Joan of Navarre. John married Elizabeth, daughter of the Yorkshire knight Roger Scrope, but died in 1409 before he could produce any offspring. His heir was his younger brother, Sir Giles [iii] Daubeney (1399-1446).

Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84), tribal rulers, who variously opposed and allied themselves with Rome. 
By the mid-first century BC, the Celtic tribes of central and eastern Gaul had developed social and political systems which supported recognizable primitive states. These peoples were ruled by elected magistrates, accountable to tribal assemblies or councils, and they had established codes of law. Kingship had been abolished among the more advanced peoples of Gaul, probably not long before 60 BC, as there still existed firm regulations which were intended to prevent individuals from re-establishing royal power. The tribes in the north of Gaul and those in Britain, however, possessed kings and among some of them at least the traditions of learning and religion fostered by druids were still strong. State-formation had thus begun in Gaul by the time of Julius Caesar's invasion in 58 BC, but had not spread throughout all the resident tribes. In Britain, an earlier stage of political development was widely represented in the mid-first century BC and was to endure for another century. 
In the island, the normal form of leadership in the late Iron Age was kingship, though that institution could take a variety of forms. As in other areas of northern Europe, kings could be elected for their martial qualities or their perceived ability to conduct specific military operations. Hereditary kingship also existed, though it is far from certain that it was the norm. Dual or even multiple kingship was maintained by some tribes. In Kent, for example, Caesar encountered four kings, probably not of four separate peoples. Half a century later, the Dobunni of western Britain appear to have had a system of dual kingship. The powers of most of the kings whose names are known were fairly certainly limited and would have depended heavily upon the measure of their success in war or other forms of dominance. From the late first century BC onward, recognition as tribal leaders by Rome may have counted as much as anything else. Rulers of the tribes most open to contact with the Roman world obviously came into consideration in this respect and it is not chance that these are the kings mentioned in classical sources. The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers. 
The earliest British leader of whom anything is known is Cassivellaunus, the leader of the south-eastern Britons at the time of Caesar's second invasion of the island in 54 BC. The closeness of his name to that of the tribe of the Catuvellauni has suggested to some that he was the king of this people, but there is no certain proof of this. Caesar does not refer to him as a king; his position may well have been that of an elected war-leader of several tribes facing a common enemy. His base lay north of the Thames and his own stronghold probably was in the borders of modern Essex and Hertfordshire. Initially, Cassivellaunus faced up to Caesar's army in what is now Kent but after a reverse there he changed tactics, avoiding battle and impeding Roman attempts to forage for supplies, with some success. But when Roman forces entered his territory and seized his own stronghold, he realized that further resistance was pointless. Peace was arranged through Caesar's ally Commius, the chief conditions being that Cassivellaunus should pay tribute to Rome and respect the independence of the Trinovantes of Essex, on whom he had encroached and whose ruler, Mandubracius, he had driven out. It is unknown whether or not these terms were adhered to, but Cassivellaunus does not appear in the record after 54 BC. 
Far more significant in his legacy to the structure of power in late Iron Age Britain was the agent and ally of Caesar in his Gaulish enterprise: Commius. In 55 BC he was sent to Britain to warn the British tribes of the impending invasion, along with British legates who had earlier been dispatched to Caesar. His legation achieved nothing. 
Commius's loyalty to Caesar was not proof against the attractions of an independent Gaul and in 52 BC he defected to that cause in the great revolt against Roman occupation. He returned to Britain in either 51 or 50 and created a power base in the area of what is now Hampshire and west Sussex, where later sources locate the British Atrebates, presumably named after Commius's Gaulish subjects. Commius was one of the few British kings known to have founded a dynasty. Three kings in the south-east of the island, Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica ['see below'], placed the filiation 'son of Commius' on their coinages. This claim may not be literally true; it certainly requires longevity in Commius and Verica at least, but it does underline the high regard in which Commius was held in Britain. 
The heirs to Commius's power were Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica, on the evidence of the coinage. Tincommius (fl. c.25 BC-AD 5) was the most senior, possibly succeeding Commius about 25 to 20 BC and ruling over the territory south of the middle Thames. A ruler signing himself Tincomarus has been identified in the same area. This rather than Tincommius may have been the proper form of the name. His later coinage is close to Roman prototypes and may well have been produced by Roman die-engravers. The metal supplies could have been supplied by imported Roman coins. These are suggestions of a treaty relationship with Rome and there is support from Tincommius's sole appearance in the historical record. The 'Res gestae' (the emperor Augustus's own account of his achievements) reports that he was received as a suppliant by the emperor, probably about AD 5, after flight from Britain. Eppillus (fl. c.AD 5-c.10) was his likely successor; some of his coins announce him as the king of Calleva (Silchester). Another series of his coins appears in the north of present-day Kent, where he may have held territory. He was followed by Verica (fl. c.AD 10-c.41), whose rule extended until AD 'c'.41, when he fled to the protection of Rome. Verica was probably reliant on Roman support. His coin types display a huge variety of classical designs and trade connections with the Roman world developed apace during his reign. 
North of the Thames, a kingdom centred on modern Hertfordshire and the Chilterns, with a major centre at Verulamium (St Albans), had emerged by 20 BC at the latest. The first named ruler in the region was Addedomarus (fl. 35 BC), probably from about 35 BC. Addedomarus may not have ruled for long, but he seems to have enlarged the stronghold at Camulodunum (Colchester). A rich burial there may be his. If so, it is of interest in that it contains a portrait medallion of Augustus, obviously a mark of Roman favour. Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.30 BC) succeeded him, a ruler who sought protection in Rome, like Tincommius, and who thus found record in the 'Res gestae' of Augustus. 
A series of rulers maintained a small kingdom in present-day Kent from the later first century BC. A king named Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.40 BC), earlier than his namesake north of the Thames, was active in northern Kent from about 40 BC. Eppillus seems to have extended his power eastward in the next generation, to be replaced by Vosenius (fl. c.AD 10) early in the first century AD. He is otherwise unknown and may have been a sub-king under the domination of the kingdom north of the Thames. Kent had certainly fallen under the control of that power by about AD 10 to 20, by which time most of south-eastern Britain was ruled by Cunobelinus, the son of Tasciovanus. Cunobelinus's supremacy during the period AD 10 to about AD 40 is underlined by Suetonius's reference to him as 'king of the Britons'. His authority extended not only over the major tribes of the Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, but also over the peoples immediately north of them and in northern Kent. His position may have been given further stability by a treaty relationship with Rome. Shortly before AD 10, unnamed British rulers had sent embassies to Augustus; Cunobelinus may have been one of this number. It suited Augustus and his successor Tiberius to maintain a stable relationship with the strongest king in southern Britain; there are no signs that either side harboured other intentions. A Roman invasion of Britain was not entertained in the last years of Augustus's reign; Tiberius had neither reason nor inclination to extend Roman territory in the west. On his side, Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by stirring up trouble and much to lose. There matters rested until Cunobelinus's death about AD 40. 
Cunobelinus had at least four sons, two of whom held sway in south-eastern Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43. These two, Caratacus and Togodumnus (d. AD 43), had swung away from their father's policy of non-provocation and had adopted a much more bellicose attitude, quite possibly in response to the invasion threat by the emperor Gaius (Caligula) in the spring of AD 40. A third son, Adminius (fl. c.AD 40), controlled part of what is now Kent before fleeing to the Roman world, perhaps expelled by his brothers. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the British forces which opposed the Roman invasion of AD 43. Their early strategy was to harry the invaders and delay their advance without risking a set-piece battle. When the British levies did come to grips, they were beaten back. Togodumnus was later killed and Caratacus retired to western Britain to continue the struggle for the next eight years. It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until AD 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces. 
Events immediately following the Roman invasion in AD 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus), the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century AD, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about AD 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in Venutius, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before AD 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84), tribal rulers, who variously opposed and allied themselves with Rome. 
By the mid-first century BC, the Celtic tribes of central and eastern Gaul had developed social and political systems which supported recognizable primitive states. These peoples were ruled by elected magistrates, accountable to tribal assemblies or councils, and they had established codes of law. Kingship had been abolished among the more advanced peoples of Gaul, probably not long before 60 BC, as there still existed firm regulations which were intended to prevent individuals from re-establishing royal power. The tribes in the north of Gaul and those in Britain, however, possessed kings and among some of them at least the traditions of learning and religion fostered by druids were still strong. State-formation had thus begun in Gaul by the time of Julius Caesar's invasion in 58 BC, but had not spread throughout all the resident tribes. In Britain, an earlier stage of political development was widely represented in the mid-first century BC and was to endure for another century. 
In the island, the normal form of leadership in the late Iron Age was kingship, though that institution could take a variety of forms. As in other areas of northern Europe, kings could be elected for their martial qualities or their perceived ability to conduct specific military operations. Hereditary kingship also existed, though it is far from certain that it was the norm. Dual or even multiple kingship was maintained by some tribes. In Kent, for example, Caesar encountered four kings, probably not of four separate peoples. Half a century later, the Dobunni of western Britain appear to have had a system of dual kingship. The powers of most of the kings whose names are known were fairly certainly limited and would have depended heavily upon the measure of their success in war or other forms of dominance. From the late first century BC onward, recognition as tribal leaders by Rome may have counted as much as anything else. Rulers of the tribes most open to contact with the Roman world obviously came into consideration in this respect and it is not chance that these are the kings mentioned in classical sources. The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers. 
The earliest British leader of whom anything is known is Cassivellaunus, the leader of the south-eastern Britons at the time of Caesar's second invasion of the island in 54 BC. The closeness of his name to that of the tribe of the Catuvellauni has suggested to some that he was the king of this people, but there is no certain proof of this. Caesar does not refer to him as a king; his position may well have been that of an elected war-leader of several tribes facing a common enemy. His base lay north of the Thames and his own stronghold probably was in the borders of modern Essex and Hertfordshire. Initially, Cassivellaunus faced up to Caesar's army in what is now Kent but after a reverse there he changed tactics, avoiding battle and impeding Roman attempts to forage for supplies, with some success. But when Roman forces entered his territory and seized his own stronghold, he realized that further resistance was pointless. Peace was arranged through Caesar's ally Commius, the chief conditions being that Cassivellaunus should pay tribute to Rome and respect the independence of the Trinovantes of Essex, on whom he had encroached and whose ruler, Mandubracius, he had driven out. It is unknown whether or not these terms were adhered to, but Cassivellaunus does not appear in the record after 54 BC. 
Far more significant in his legacy to the structure of power in late Iron Age Britain was the agent and ally of Caesar in his Gaulish enterprise: Commius. In 55 BC he was sent to Britain to warn the British tribes of the impending invasion, along with British legates who had earlier been dispatched to Caesar. His legation achieved nothing. 
Commius's loyalty to Caesar was not proof against the attractions of an independent Gaul and in 52 BC he defected to that cause in the great revolt against Roman occupation. He returned to Britain in either 51 or 50 and created a power base in the area of what is now Hampshire and west Sussex, where later sources locate the British Atrebates, presumably named after Commius's Gaulish subjects. Commius was one of the few British kings known to have founded a dynasty. Three kings in the south-east of the island, Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica ['see below'], placed the filiation 'son of Commius' on their coinages. This claim may not be literally true; it certainly requires longevity in Commius and Verica at least, but it does underline the high regard in which Commius was held in Britain. 
The heirs to Commius's power were Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica, on the evidence of the coinage. Tincommius (fl. c.25 BC-AD 5) was the most senior, possibly succeeding Commius about 25 to 20 BC and ruling over the territory south of the middle Thames. A ruler signing himself Tincomarus has been identified in the same area. This rather than Tincommius may have been the proper form of the name. His later coinage is close to Roman prototypes and may well have been produced by Roman die-engravers. The metal supplies could have been supplied by imported Roman coins. These are suggestions of a treaty relationship with Rome and there is support from Tincommius's sole appearance in the historical record. The 'Res gestae' (the emperor Augustus's own account of his achievements) reports that he was received as a suppliant by the emperor, probably about AD 5, after flight from Britain. Eppillus (fl. c.AD 5-c.10) was his likely successor; some of his coins announce him as the king of Calleva (Silchester). Another series of his coins appears in the north of present-day Kent, where he may have held territory. He was followed by Verica (fl. c.AD 10-c.41), whose rule extended until AD 'c'.41, when he fled to the protection of Rome. Verica was probably reliant on Roman support. His coin types display a huge variety of classical designs and trade connections with the Roman world developed apace during his reign. 
North of the Thames, a kingdom centred on modern Hertfordshire and the Chilterns, with a major centre at Verulamium (St Albans), had emerged by 20 BC at the latest. The first named ruler in the region was Addedomarus (fl. 35 BC), probably from about 35 BC. Addedomarus may not have ruled for long, but he seems to have enlarged the stronghold at Camulodunum (Colchester). A rich burial there may be his. If so, it is of interest in that it contains a portrait medallion of Augustus, obviously a mark of Roman favour. Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.30 BC) succeeded him, a ruler who sought protection in Rome, like Tincommius, and who thus found record in the 'Res gestae' of Augustus. 
A series of rulers maintained a small kingdom in present-day Kent from the later first century BC. A king named Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.40 BC), earlier than his namesake north of the Thames, was active in northern Kent from about 40 BC. Eppillus seems to have extended his power eastward in the next generation, to be replaced by Vosenius (fl. c.AD 10) early in the first century AD. He is otherwise unknown and may have been a sub-king under the domination of the kingdom north of the Thames. Kent had certainly fallen under the control of that power by about AD 10 to 20, by which time most of south-eastern Britain was ruled by Cunobelinus, the son of Tasciovanus. Cunobelinus's supremacy during the period AD 10 to about AD 40 is underlined by Suetonius's reference to him as 'king of the Britons'. His authority extended not only over the major tribes of the Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, but also over the peoples immediately north of them and in northern Kent. His position may have been given further stability by a treaty relationship with Rome. Shortly before AD 10, unnamed British rulers had sent embassies to Augustus; Cunobelinus may have been one of this number. It suited Augustus and his successor Tiberius to maintain a stable relationship with the strongest king in southern Britain; there are no signs that either side harboured other intentions. A Roman invasion of Britain was not entertained in the last years of Augustus's reign; Tiberius had neither reason nor inclination to extend Roman territory in the west. On his side, Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by stirring up trouble and much to lose. There matters rested until Cunobelinus's death about AD 40. 
Cunobelinus had at least four sons, two of whom held sway in south-eastern Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43. These two, Caratacus and Togodumnus (d. AD 43), had swung away from their father's policy of non-provocation and had adopted a much more bellicose attitude, quite possibly in response to the invasion threat by the emperor Gaius (Caligula) in the spring of AD 40. A third son, Adminius (fl. c.AD 40), controlled part of what is now Kent before fleeing to the Roman world, perhaps expelled by his brothers. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the British forces which opposed the Roman invasion of AD 43. Their early strategy was to harry the invaders and delay their advance without risking a set-piece battle. When the British levies did come to grips, they were beaten back. Togodumnus was later killed and Caratacus retired to western Britain to continue the struggle for the next eight years. It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until AD 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces. 
Events immediately following the Roman invasion in AD 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus), the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century AD, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about AD 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in Venutius, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before AD 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century AD, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about AD 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in Venutius, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before AD 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84), tribal rulers, who variously opposed and allied themselves with Rome. 
By the mid-first century BC, the Celtic tribes of central and eastern Gaul had developed social and political systems which supported recognizable primitive states. These peoples were ruled by elected magistrates, accountable to tribal assemblies or councils, and they had established codes of law. Kingship had been abolished among the more advanced peoples of Gaul, probably not long before 60 BC, as there still existed firm regulations which were intended to prevent individuals from re-establishing royal power. The tribes in the north of Gaul and those in Britain, however, possessed kings and among some of them at least the traditions of learning and religion fostered by druids were still strong. State-formation had thus begun in Gaul by the time of Julius Caesar's invasion in 58 BC, but had not spread throughout all the resident tribes. In Britain, an earlier stage of political development was widely represented in the mid-first century BC and was to endure for another century. 
In the island, the normal form of leadership in the late Iron Age was kingship, though that institution could take a variety of forms. As in other areas of northern Europe, kings could be elected for their martial qualities or their perceived ability to conduct specific military operations. Hereditary kingship also existed, though it is far from certain that it was the norm. Dual or even multiple kingship was maintained by some tribes. In Kent, for example, Caesar encountered four kings, probably not of four separate peoples. Half a century later, the Dobunni of western Britain appear to have had a system of dual kingship. The powers of most of the kings whose names are known were fairly certainly limited and would have depended heavily upon the measure of their success in war or other forms of dominance. From the late first century BC onward, recognition as tribal leaders by Rome may have counted as much as anything else. Rulers of the tribes most open to contact with the Roman world obviously came into consideration in this respect and it is not chance that these are the kings mentioned in classical sources. The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers. 
The earliest British leader of whom anything is known is Cassivellaunus, the leader of the south-eastern Britons at the time of Caesar's second invasion of the island in 54 BC. The closeness of his name to that of the tribe of the Catuvellauni has suggested to some that he was the king of this people, but there is no certain proof of this. Caesar does not refer to him as a king; his position may well have been that of an elected war-leader of several tribes facing a common enemy. His base lay north of the Thames and his own stronghold probably was in the borders of modern Essex and Hertfordshire. Initially, Cassivellaunus faced up to Caesar's army in what is now Kent but after a reverse there he changed tactics, avoiding battle and impeding Roman attempts to forage for supplies, with some success. But when Roman forces entered his territory and seized his own stronghold, he realized that further resistance was pointless. Peace was arranged through Caesar's ally Commius, the chief conditions being that Cassivellaunus should pay tribute to Rome and respect the independence of the Trinovantes of Essex, on whom he had encroached and whose ruler, Mandubracius, he had driven out. It is unknown whether or not these terms were adhered to, but Cassivellaunus does not appear in the record after 54 BC. 
Far more significant in his legacy to the structure of power in late Iron Age Britain was the agent and ally of Caesar in his Gaulish enterprise: Commius. In 55 BC he was sent to Britain to warn the British tribes of the impending invasion, along with British legates who had earlier been dispatched to Caesar. His legation achieved nothing. 
Commius's loyalty to Caesar was not proof against the attractions of an independent Gaul and in 52 BC he defected to that cause in the great revolt against Roman occupation. He returned to Britain in either 51 or 50 and created a power base in the area of what is now Hampshire and west Sussex, where later sources locate the British Atrebates, presumably named after Commius's Gaulish subjects. Commius was one of the few British kings known to have founded a dynasty. Three kings in the south-east of the island, Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica ['see below'], placed the filiation 'son of Commius' on their coinages. This claim may not be literally true; it certainly requires longevity in Commius and Verica at least, but it does underline the high regard in which Commius was held in Britain. 
The heirs to Commius's power were Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica, on the evidence of the coinage. Tincommius (fl. c.25 BC-AD 5) was the most senior, possibly succeeding Commius about 25 to 20 BC and ruling over the territory south of the middle Thames. A ruler signing himself Tincomarus has been identified in the same area. This rather than Tincommius may have been the proper form of the name. His later coinage is close to Roman prototypes and may well have been produced by Roman die-engravers. The metal supplies could have been supplied by imported Roman coins. These are suggestions of a treaty relationship with Rome and there is support from Tincommius's sole appearance in the historical record. The 'Res gestae' (the emperor Augustus's own account of his achievements) reports that he was received as a suppliant by the emperor, probably about AD 5, after flight from Britain. Eppillus (fl. c.AD 5-c.10) was his likely successor; some of his coins announce him as the king of Calleva (Silchester). Another series of his coins appears in the north of present-day Kent, where he may have held territory. He was followed by Verica (fl. c.AD 10-c.41), whose rule extended until AD 'c'.41, when he fled to the protection of Rome. Verica was probably reliant on Roman support. His coin types display a huge variety of classical designs and trade connections with the Roman world developed apace during his reign. 
North of the Thames, a kingdom centred on modern Hertfordshire and the Chilterns, with a major centre at Verulamium (St Albans), had emerged by 20 BC at the latest. The first named ruler in the region was Addedomarus (fl. 35 BC), probably from about 35 BC. Addedomarus may not have ruled for long, but he seems to have enlarged the stronghold at Camulodunum (Colchester). A rich burial there may be his. If so, it is of interest in that it contains a portrait medallion of Augustus, obviously a mark of Roman favour. Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.30 BC) succeeded him, a ruler who sought protection in Rome, like Tincommius, and who thus found record in the 'Res gestae' of Augustus. 
A series of rulers maintained a small kingdom in present-day Kent from the later first century BC. A king named Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.40 BC), earlier than his namesake north of the Thames, was active in northern Kent from about 40 BC. Eppillus seems to have extended his power eastward in the next generation, to be replaced by Vosenius (fl. c.AD 10) early in the first century AD. He is otherwise unknown and may have been a sub-king under the domination of the kingdom north of the Thames. Kent had certainly fallen under the control of that power by about AD 10 to 20, by which time most of south-eastern Britain was ruled by Cunobelinus, the son of Tasciovanus. Cunobelinus's supremacy during the period AD 10 to about AD 40 is underlined by Suetonius's reference to him as 'king of the Britons'. His authority extended not only over the major tribes of the Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, but also over the peoples immediately north of them and in northern Kent. His position may have been given further stability by a treaty relationship with Rome. Shortly before AD 10, unnamed British rulers had sent embassies to Augustus; Cunobelinus may have been one of this number. It suited Augustus and his successor Tiberius to maintain a stable relationship with the strongest king in southern Britain; there are no signs that either side harboured other intentions. A Roman invasion of Britain was not entertained in the last years of Augustus's reign; Tiberius had neither reason nor inclination to extend Roman territory in the west. On his side, Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by stirring up trouble and much to lose. There matters rested until Cunobelinus's death about AD 40. 
Cunobelinus had at least four sons, two of whom held sway in south-eastern Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43. These two, Caratacus and Togodumnus (d. AD 43), had swung away from their father's policy of non-provocation and had adopted a much more bellicose attitude, quite possibly in response to the invasion threat by the emperor Gaius (Caligula) in the spring of AD 40. A third son, Adminius (fl. c.AD 40), controlled part of what is now Kent before fleeing to the Roman world, perhaps expelled by his brothers. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the British forces which opposed the Roman invasion of AD 43. Their early strategy was to harry the invaders and delay their advance without risking a set-piece battle. When the British levies did come to grips, they were beaten back. Togodumnus was later killed and Caratacus retired to western Britain to continue the struggle for the next eight years. It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until AD 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces. 
Events immediately following the Roman invasion in AD 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus), the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world.

The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century AD, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about AD 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in Venutius, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before AD 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

Cunobelinus (d. c.AD 40), king in southern Britain, is the Cymbeline of Holinshed's 'Chronicles' (1578) and of Shakespeare's play. The father and predecessor of Cunobelinus, Tasciovanus (d. c.AD 10), had greatly extended the tribal kingdom of the Catuvellauni from its heartland north of the lower Thames eastward into what is now Essex and Suffolk and northward into modern Northamptonshire, thereby creating the largest of the Iron Age kingdoms in Britain. This expansion was chiefly at the expense of the Trinovantes of present-day Essex. On some of his coins Tasciovanus boasted the title 'rigonos', probably Celtic for 'rex' ('king'), thus possibly indicating a will to exercise a power independent of Roman direction. On the death of Tasciovanus about AD 10, Cunobelinus succeeded him. The time was one in which Roman diplomatic and commercial influence in southern Britain was increasing. The area occupied by the Catuvellauni was well placed for the exploitation of new opportunities. It was surrounded by lesser powers and had access to the trade routes which led to and from Roman Gaul. The tribal territory also commanded vital raw materials, especially iron, and contained rich farmlands. 
There are hints in the contemporary coinage of a power struggle among the rulers of south-eastern Britain early in the first century AD. Cunobelinus emerged as the principal victor and he subsequently held sway for three decades as the dominant king of the southern British. Nothing is recorded of his personality, nor of the detailed events of his long reign. It is known that he had at least three sons, two of whom were to play the leading part in opposing the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43. For the rest, his reign can only be reconstructed in outline from the evidence of coinage and archaeology. From his base in the Catuvellaunian heartland Cunobelinus appears first to have consolidated his hold over the Trinovantes. Shortly after AD 10 he was issuing coins bearing the mint mark CAM, for Camulodunum (Colchester), the principal centre of the Trinovantes. It is therefore clear that he had successfully annexed that people by then. He next turned his attention to the area south of the Thames. By AD 25 he had seized control of much of Cantium (Kent), while his brother Epaticcus extended his power over the Atrebates of the middle Thames valley. To the north, Cunobelinus pushed the bounds of his kingdom to the fenland margins, either directly or with the aid of sub-kings, so that his authority was effectively unchallenged in south-eastern Britain. Not inappropriately, the second-century Roman writer Suetonius referred to him as 'Britannorum rex' ('king of the Britons') and not merely as the ruler of a single tribe. Cunobelinus inscribed the title 'rex' on some of his coins, possibly after recognition by the emperor Tiberius as an allied ruler of Rome. For a time he struck coins bearing designs which closely copy those of Roman issues. Some of these coins may well have been struck from dies engraved by Roman craftsmen who came to Cunobelinus's kingdom under a diplomatic arrangement. 
During Cunobelinus's long reign of some thirty years relations between southern Britain and the Roman world were stable, probably reflecting mutually agreed arrangements designed to preserve the 'status quo'. Tiberius had no desire to extend Roman dominion into Britain. Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by disturbing the peace. There was indeed much to lose, for Roman trade links with Britain developed strongly early in the first century AD. Luxury imports of wine, fine metalwork, pottery, and other Roman goods were exchanged for a wide range of British products: corn, cattle, gold, silver, iron, slaves, and hounds, according to Strabo, writing about AD 17. The prestige which this trade generated, allied with material benefits to British nobles, would not have gone unregarded by Cunobelinus. A clear sign of the British king's acceptance of a stable relationship with Rome is provided by the return to Gaul of several shiploads of Roman troops after they had been driven on to the British coast in AD 16. The native centre of Camulodunum was greatly extended under Cunobelinus's rule, until a vast complex of about 7 square miles was bounded by massive earthen dykes. Elsewhere in the kingdom other centres began to assume urban form, as at Verulamium (St Albans) and Durovernum (Canterbury). In several respects Cunobelinus brought southern Britain close to the world of Rome. When he died, about AD 40, his mantle passed to two of his sons, Caratacus and Togodumnus ['see under 'Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84)], who were to adopt different policies towards the great power across the channel.

Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84), tribal rulers, who variously opposed and allied themselves with Rome. 
By the mid-first century BC, the Celtic tribes of central and eastern Gaul had developed social and political systems which supported recognizable primitive states. These peoples were ruled by elected magistrates, accountable to tribal assemblies or councils, and they had established codes of law. Kingship had been abolished among the more advanced peoples of Gaul, probably not long before 60 BC, as there still existed firm regulations which were intended to prevent individuals from re-establishing royal power. The tribes in the north of Gaul and those in Britain, however, possessed kings and among some of them at least the traditions of learning and religion fostered by druids were still strong. State-formation had thus begun in Gaul by the time of Julius Caesar's invasion in 58 BC, but had not spread throughout all the resident tribes. In Britain, an earlier stage of political development was widely represented in the mid-first century BC and was to endure for another century. 
In the island, the normal form of leadership in the late Iron Age was kingship, though that institution could take a variety of forms. As in other areas of northern Europe, kings could be elected for their martial qualities or their perceived ability to conduct specific military operations. Hereditary kingship also existed, though it is far from certain that it was the norm. Dual or even multiple kingship was maintained by some tribes. In Kent, for example, Caesar encountered four kings, probably not of four separate peoples. Half a century later, the Dobunni of western Britain appear to have had a system of dual kingship. The powers of most of the kings whose names are known were fairly certainly limited and would have depended heavily upon the measure of their success in war or other forms of dominance. From the late first century BC onward, recognition as tribal leaders by Rome may have counted as much as anything else. Rulers of the tribes most open to contact with the Roman world obviously came into consideration in this respect and it is not chance that these are the kings mentioned in classical sources. The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers. 
The earliest British leader of whom anything is known is Cassivellaunus, the leader of the south-eastern Britons at the time of Caesar's second invasion of the island in 54 BC. The closeness of his name to that of the tribe of the Catuvellauni has suggested to some that he was the king of this people, but there is no certain proof of this. Caesar does not refer to him as a king; his position may well have been that of an elected war-leader of several tribes facing a common enemy. His base lay north of the Thames and his own stronghold probably was in the borders of modern Essex and Hertfordshire. Initially, Cassivellaunus faced up to Caesar's army in what is now Kent but after a reverse there he changed tactics, avoiding battle and impeding Roman attempts to forage for supplies, with some success. But when Roman forces entered his territory and seized his own stronghold, he realized that further resistance was pointless. Peace was arranged through Caesar's ally Commius, the chief conditions being that Cassivellaunus should pay tribute to Rome and respect the independence of the Trinovantes of Essex, on whom he had encroached and whose ruler, Mandubracius, he had driven out. It is unknown whether or not these terms were adhered to, but Cassivellaunus does not appear in the record after 54 BC. 
Far more significant in his legacy to the structure of power in late Iron Age Britain was the agent and ally of Caesar in his Gaulish enterprise: Commius. In 55 BC he was sent to Britain to warn the British tribes of the impending invasion, along with British legates who had earlier been dispatched to Caesar. His legation achieved nothing. 
Commius's loyalty to Caesar was not proof against the attractions of an independent Gaul and in 52 BC he defected to that cause in the great revolt against Roman occupation. He returned to Britain in either 51 or 50 and created a power base in the area of what is now Hampshire and west Sussex, where later sources locate the British Atrebates, presumably named after Commius's Gaulish subjects. Commius was one of the few British kings known to have founded a dynasty. Three kings in the south-east of the island, Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica ['see below'], placed the filiation 'son of Commius' on their coinages. This claim may not be literally true; it certainly requires longevity in Commius and Verica at least, but it does underline the high regard in which Commius was held in Britain. 
The heirs to Commius's power were Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica, on the evidence of the coinage. Tincommius (fl. c.25 BC-AD 5) was the most senior, possibly succeeding Commius about 25 to 20 BC and ruling over the territory south of the middle Thames. A ruler signing himself Tincomarus has been identified in the same area. This rather than Tincommius may have been the proper form of the name. His later coinage is close to Roman prototypes and may well have been produced by Roman die-engravers. The metal supplies could have been supplied by imported Roman coins. These are suggestions of a treaty relationship with Rome and there is support from Tincommius's sole appearance in the historical record. The 'Res gestae' (the emperor Augustus's own account of his achievements) reports that he was received as a suppliant by the emperor, probably about AD 5, after flight from Britain. Eppillus (fl. c.AD 5-c.10) was his likely successor; some of his coins announce him as the king of Calleva (Silchester). Another series of his coins appears in the north of present-day Kent, where he may have held territory. He was followed by Verica (fl. c.AD 10-c.41), whose rule extended until AD 'c'.41, when he fled to the protection of Rome. Verica was probably reliant on Roman support. His coin types display a huge variety of classical designs and trade connections with the Roman world developed apace during his reign. 
North of the Thames, a kingdom centred on modern Hertfordshire and the Chilterns, with a major centre at Verulamium (St Albans), had emerged by 20 BC at the latest. The first named ruler in the region was Addedomarus (fl. 35 BC), probably from about 35 BC. Addedomarus may not have ruled for long, but he seems to have enlarged the stronghold at Camulodunum (Colchester). A rich burial there may be his. If so, it is of interest in that it contains a portrait medallion of Augustus, obviously a mark of Roman favour. Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.30 BC) succeeded him, a ruler who sought protection in Rome, like Tincommius, and who thus found record in the 'Res gestae' of Augustus. 
A series of rulers maintained a small kingdom in present-day Kent from the later first century BC. A king named Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.40 BC), earlier than his namesake north of the Thames, was active in northern Kent from about 40 BC. Eppillus seems to have extended his power eastward in the next generation, to be replaced by Vosenius (fl. c.AD 10) early in the first century AD. He is otherwise unknown and may have been a sub-king under the domination of the kingdom north of the Thames. Kent had certainly fallen under the control of that power by about AD 10 to 20, by which time most of south-eastern Britain was ruled by Cunobelinus, the son of Tasciovanus. Cunobelinus's supremacy during the period AD 10 to about AD 40 is underlined by Suetonius's reference to him as 'king of the Britons'. His authority extended not only over the major tribes of the Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, but also over the peoples immediately north of them and in northern Kent. His position may have been given further stability by a treaty relationship with Rome. Shortly before AD 10, unnamed British rulers had sent embassies to Augustus; Cunobelinus may have been one of this number. It suited Augustus and his successor Tiberius to maintain a stable relationship with the strongest king in southern Britain; there are no signs that either side harboured other intentions. A Roman invasion of Britain was not entertained in the last years of Augustus's reign; Tiberius had neither reason nor inclination to extend Roman territory in the west. On his side, Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by stirring up trouble and much to lose. There matters rested until Cunobelinus's death about AD 40. 
Cunobelinus had at least four sons, two of whom held sway in south-eastern Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43. These two, Caratacus and Togodumnus (d. AD 43), had swung away from their father's policy of non-provocation and had adopted a much more bellicose attitude, quite possibly in response to the invasion threat by the emperor Gaius (Caligula) in the spring of AD 40. A third son, Adminius (fl. c.AD 40), controlled part of what is now Kent before fleeing to the Roman world, perhaps expelled by his brothers. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the British forces which opposed the Roman invasion of AD 43. Their early strategy was to harry the invaders and delay their advance without risking a set-piece battle. When the British levies did come to grips, they were beaten back. Togodumnus was later killed and Caratacus retired to western Britain to continue the struggle for the next eight years. It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until AD 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces. 
Events immediately following the Roman invasion in AD 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus), the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable.

The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame.

That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line.

This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement.

Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers. 
The earliest British leader of whom anything is known is Cassivellaunus, the leader of the south-eastern Britons at the time of Caesar's second invasion of the island in 54 BC. The closeness of his name to that of the tribe of the Catuvellauni has suggested to some that he was the king of this people, but there is no certain proof of this. Caesar does not refer to him as a king; his position may well have been that of an elected war-leader of several tribes facing a common enemy. His base lay north of the Thames and his own stronghold probably was in the borders of modern Essex and Hertfordshire. Initially, Cassivellaunus faced up to Caesar's army in what is now Kent but after a reverse there he changed tactics, avoiding battle and impeding Roman attempts to forage for supplies, with some success. But when Roman forces entered his territory and seized his own stronghold, he realized that further resistance was pointless. Peace was arranged through Caesar's ally Commius, the chief conditions being that Cassivellaunus should pay tribute to Rome and respect the independence of the Trinovantes of Essex, on whom he had encroached and whose ruler, Mandubracius, he had driven out. It is unknown whether or not these terms were adhered to, but Cassivellaunus does not appear in the record after 54 BC. 
Far more significant in his legacy to the structure of power in late Iron Age Britain was the agent and ally of Caesar in his Gaulish enterprise: Commius. In 55 BC he was sent to Britain to warn the British tribes of the impending invasion, along with British legates who had earlier been dispatched to Caesar. His legation achieved nothing. 
Commius's loyalty to Caesar was not proof against the attractions of an independent Gaul and in 52 BC he defected to that cause in the great revolt against Roman occupation. He returned to Britain in either 51 or 50 and created a power base in the area of what is now Hampshire and west Sussex, where later sources locate the British Atrebates, presumably named after Commius's Gaulish subjects. Commius was one of the few British kings known to have founded a dynasty. Three kings in the south-east of the island, Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica ['see below'], placed the filiation 'son of Commius' on their coinages. This claim may not be literally true; it certainly requires longevity in Commius and Verica at least, but it does underline the high regard in which Commius was held in Britain. 
The heirs to Commius's power were Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica, on the evidence of the coinage. Tincommius (fl. c.25 BC-AD 5) was the most senior, possibly succeeding Commius about 25 to 20 BC and ruling over the territory south of the middle Thames. A ruler signing himself Tincomarus has been identified in the same area. This rather than Tincommius may have been the proper form of the name. His later coinage is close to Roman prototypes and may well have been produced by Roman die-engravers. The metal supplies could have been supplied by imported Roman coins. These are suggestions of a treaty relationship with Rome and there is support from Tincommius's sole appearance in the historical record. The 'Res gestae' (the emperor Augustus's own account of his achievements) reports that he was received as a suppliant by the emperor, probably about AD 5, after flight from Britain. Eppillus (fl. c.AD 5-c.10) was his likely successor; some of his coins announce him as the king of Calleva (Silchester). Another series of his coins appears in the north of present-day Kent, where he may have held territory. He was followed by Verica (fl. c.AD 10-c.41), whose rule extended until AD 'c'.41, when he fled to the protection of Rome. Verica was probably reliant on Roman support. His coin types display a huge variety of classical designs and trade connections with the Roman world developed apace during his reign. 
North of the Thames, a kingdom centred on modern Hertfordshire and the Chilterns, with a major centre at Verulamium (St Albans), had emerged by 20 BC at the latest. The first named ruler in the region was Addedomarus (fl. 35 BC), probably from about 35 BC. Addedomarus may not have ruled for long, but he seems to have enlarged the stronghold at Camulodunum (Colchester). A rich burial there may be his. If so, it is of interest in that it contains a portrait medallion of Augustus, obviously a mark of Roman favour. Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.30 BC) succeeded him, a ruler who sought protection in Rome, like Tincommius, and who thus found record in the 'Res gestae' of Augustus. 
A series of rulers maintained a small kingdom in present-day Kent from the later first century BC. A king named Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.40 BC), earlier than his namesake north of the Thames, was active in northern Kent from about 40 BC. Eppillus seems to have extended his power eastward in the next generation, to be replaced by Vosenius (fl. c.AD 10) early in the first century AD. He is otherwise unknown and may have been a sub-king under the domination of the kingdom north of the Thames. Kent had certainly fallen under the control of that power by about AD 10 to 20, by which time most of south-eastern Britain was ruled by Cunobelinus, the son of Tasciovanus. Cunobelinus's supremacy during the period AD 10 to about AD 40 is underlined by Suetonius's reference to him as 'king of the Britons'. His authority extended not only over the major tribes of the Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, but also over the peoples immediately north of them and in northern Kent. His position may have been given further stability by a treaty relationship with Rome. Shortly before AD 10, unnamed British rulers had sent embassies to Augustus; Cunobelinus may have been one of this number. It suited Augustus and his successor Tiberius to maintain a stable relationship with the strongest king in southern Britain; there are no signs that either side harboured other intentions. A Roman invasion of Britain was not entertained in the last years of Augustus's reign; Tiberius had neither reason nor inclination to extend Roman territory in the west. On his side, Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by stirring up trouble and much to lose. There matters rested until Cunobelinus's death about AD 40. 
Cunobelinus had at least four sons, two of whom held sway in south-eastern Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43. These two, Caratacus and Togodumnus (d. AD 43), had swung away from their father's policy of non-provocation and had adopted a much more bellicose attitude, quite possibly in response to the invasion threat by the emperor Gaius (Caligula) in the spring of AD 40. A third son, Adminius (fl. c.AD 40), controlled part of what is now Kent before fleeing to the Roman world, perhaps expelled by his brothers. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the British forces which opposed the Roman invasion of AD 43. Their early strategy was to harry the invaders and delay their advance without risking a set-piece battle. When the British levies did come to grips, they were beaten back. Togodumnus was later killed and Caratacus retired to western Britain to continue the struggle for the next eight years. It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until AD 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces. 
Events immediately following the Roman invasion in AD 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus), the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century AD, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about AD 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in Venutius, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before AD 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84), tribal rulers, who variously opposed and allied themselves with Rome. 
By the mid-first century BC, the Celtic tribes of central and eastern Gaul had developed social and political systems which supported recognizable primitive states. These peoples were ruled by elected magistrates, accountable to tribal assemblies or councils, and they had established codes of law. Kingship had been abolished among the more advanced peoples of Gaul, probably not long before 60 BC, as there still existed firm regulations which were intended to prevent individuals from re-establishing royal power. The tribes in the north of Gaul and those in Britain, however, possessed kings and among some of them at least the traditions of learning and religion fostered by druids were still strong. State-formation had thus begun in Gaul by the time of Julius Caesar's invasion in 58 BC, but had not spread throughout all the resident tribes. In Britain, an earlier stage of political development was widely represented in the mid-first century BC and was to endure for another century. 
In the island, the normal form of leadership in the late Iron Age was kingship, though that institution could take a variety of forms. As in other areas of northern Europe, kings could be elected for their martial qualities or their perceived ability to conduct specific military operations. Hereditary kingship also existed, though it is far from certain that it was the norm. Dual or even multiple kingship was maintained by some tribes. In Kent, for example, Caesar encountered four kings, probably not of four separate peoples. Half a century later, the Dobunni of western Britain appear to have had a system of dual kingship. The powers of most of the kings whose names are known were fairly certainly limited and would have depended heavily upon the measure of their success in war or other forms of dominance. From the late first century BC onward, recognition as tribal leaders by Rome may have counted as much as anything else. Rulers of the tribes most open to contact with the Roman world obviously came into consideration in this respect and it is not chance that these are the kings mentioned in classical sources. The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers.

The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84), tribal rulers, who variously opposed and allied themselves with Rome. 
By the mid-first century BC, the Celtic tribes of central and eastern Gaul had developed social and political systems which supported recognizable primitive states. These peoples were ruled by elected magistrates, accountable to tribal assemblies or councils, and they had established codes of law. Kingship had been abolished among the more advanced peoples of Gaul, probably not long before 60 BC, as there still existed firm regulations which were intended to prevent individuals from re-establishing royal power. The tribes in the north of Gaul and those in Britain, however, possessed kings and among some of them at least the traditions of learning and religion fostered by druids were still strong. State-formation had thus begun in Gaul by the time of Julius Caesar's invasion in 58 BC, but had not spread throughout all the resident tribes. In Britain, an earlier stage of political development was widely represented in the mid-first century BC and was to endure for another century. 
In the island, the normal form of leadership in the late Iron Age was kingship, though that institution could take a variety of forms. As in other areas of northern Europe, kings could be elected for their martial qualities or their perceived ability to conduct specific military operations. Hereditary kingship also existed, though it is far from certain that it was the norm. Dual or even multiple kingship was maintained by some tribes. In Kent, for example, Caesar encountered four kings, probably not of four separate peoples. Half a century later, the Dobunni of western Britain appear to have had a system of dual kingship. The powers of most of the kings whose names are known were fairly certainly limited and would have depended heavily upon the measure of their success in war or other forms of dominance. From the late first century BC onward, recognition as tribal leaders by Rome may have counted as much as anything else. Rulers of the tribes most open to contact with the Roman world obviously came into consideration in this respect and it is not chance that these are the kings mentioned in classical sources. The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers. 
The earliest British leader of whom anything is known is Cassivellaunus, the leader of the south-eastern Britons at the time of Caesar's second invasion of the island in 54 BC. The closeness of his name to that of the tribe of the Catuvellauni has suggested to some that he was the king of this people, but there is no certain proof of this. Caesar does not refer to him as a king; his position may well have been that of an elected war-leader of several tribes facing a common enemy. His base lay north of the Thames and his own stronghold probably was in the borders of modern Essex and Hertfordshire. Initially, Cassivellaunus faced up to Caesar's army in what is now Kent but after a reverse there he changed tactics, avoiding battle and impeding Roman attempts to forage for supplies, with some success. But when Roman forces entered his territory and seized his own stronghold, he realized that further resistance was pointless. Peace was arranged through Caesar's ally Commius, the chief conditions being that Cassivellaunus should pay tribute to Rome and respect the independence of the Trinovantes of Essex, on whom he had encroached and whose ruler, Mandubracius, he had driven out. It is unknown whether or not these terms were adhered to, but Cassivellaunus does not appear in the record after 54 BC. 
Far more significant in his legacy to the structure of power in late Iron Age Britain was the agent and ally of Caesar in his Gaulish enterprise: Commius. In 55 BC he was sent to Britain to warn the British tribes of the impending invasion, along with British legates who had earlier been dispatched to Caesar. His legation achieved nothing. 
Commius's loyalty to Caesar was not proof against the attractions of an independent Gaul and in 52 BC he defected to that cause in the great revolt against Roman occupation. He returned to Britain in either 51 or 50 and created a power base in the area of what is now Hampshire and west Sussex, where later sources locate the British Atrebates, presumably named after Commius's Gaulish subjects. Commius was one of the few British kings known to have founded a dynasty. Three kings in the south-east of the island, Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica ['see below'], placed the filiation 'son of Commius' on their coinages. This claim may not be literally true; it certainly requires longevity in Commius and Verica at least, but it does underline the high regard in which Commius was held in Britain. 
The heirs to Commius's power were Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica, on the evidence of the coinage. Tincommius (fl. c.25 BC-AD 5) was the most senior, possibly succeeding Commius about 25 to 20 BC and ruling over the territory south of the middle Thames. A ruler signing himself Tincomarus has been identified in the same area. This rather than Tincommius may have been the proper form of the name. His later coinage is close to Roman prototypes and may well have been produced by Roman die-engravers. The metal supplies could have been supplied by imported Roman coins. These are suggestions of a treaty relationship with Rome and there is support from Tincommius's sole appearance in the historical record. The 'Res gestae' (the emperor Augustus's own account of his achievements) reports that he was received as a suppliant by the emperor, probably about AD 5, after flight from Britain. Eppillus (fl. c.AD 5-c.10) was his likely successor; some of his coins announce him as the king of Calleva (Silchester). Another series of his coins appears in the north of present-day Kent, where he may have held territory. He was followed by Verica (fl. c.AD 10-c.41), whose rule extended until AD 'c'.41, when he fled to the protection of Rome. Verica was probably reliant on Roman support. His coin types display a huge variety of classical designs and trade connections with the Roman world developed apace during his reign. 
North of the Thames, a kingdom centred on modern Hertfordshire and the Chilterns, with a major centre at Verulamium (St Albans), had emerged by 20 BC at the latest. The first named ruler in the region was Addedomarus (fl. 35 BC), probably from about 35 BC. Addedomarus may not have ruled for long, but he seems to have enlarged the stronghold at Camulodunum (Colchester). A rich burial there may be his. If so, it is of interest in that it contains a portrait medallion of Augustus, obviously a mark of Roman favour. Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.30 BC) succeeded him, a ruler who sought protection in Rome, like Tincommius, and who thus found record in the 'Res gestae' of Augustus. 
A series of rulers maintained a small kingdom in present-day Kent from the later first century BC. A king named Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.40 BC), earlier than his namesake north of the Thames, was active in northern Kent from about 40 BC. Eppillus seems to have extended his power eastward in the next generation, to be replaced by Vosenius (fl. c.AD 10) early in the first century AD. He is otherwise unknown and may have been a sub-king under the domination of the kingdom north of the Thames. Kent had certainly fallen under the control of that power by about AD 10 to 20, by which time most of south-eastern Britain was ruled by Cunobelinus, the son of Tasciovanus. Cunobelinus's supremacy during the period AD 10 to about AD 40 is underlined by Suetonius's reference to him as 'king of the Britons'. His authority extended not only over the major tribes of the Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, but also over the peoples immediately north of them and in northern Kent. His position may have been given further stability by a treaty relationship with Rome. Shortly before AD 10, unnamed British rulers had sent embassies to Augustus; Cunobelinus may have been one of this number. It suited Augustus and his successor Tiberius to maintain a stable relationship with the strongest king in southern Britain; there are no signs that either side harboured other intentions. A Roman invasion of Britain was not entertained in the last years of Augustus's reign; Tiberius had neither reason nor inclination to extend Roman territory in the west. On his side, Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by stirring up trouble and much to lose. There matters rested until Cunobelinus's death about AD 40. 
Cunobelinus had at least four sons, two of whom held sway in south-eastern Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43. These two, Caratacus and Togodumnus (d. AD 43), had swung away from their father's policy of non-provocation and had adopted a much more bellicose attitude, quite possibly in response to the invasion threat by the emperor Gaius (Caligula) in the spring of AD 40. A third son, Adminius (fl. c.AD 40), controlled part of what is now Kent before fleeing to the Roman world, perhaps expelled by his brothers. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the British forces which opposed the Roman invasion of AD 43. Their early strategy was to harry the invaders and delay their advance without risking a set-piece battle. When the British levies did come to grips, they were beaten back. Togodumnus was later killed and Caratacus retired to western Britain to continue the struggle for the next eight years. It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until AD 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces. 
Events immediately following the Roman invasion in AD 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus), the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century AD, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about AD 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in Venutius, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before AD 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD.

Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century AD, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about AD 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in Venutius, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before AD 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC-AD 84), tribal rulers, who variously opposed and allied themselves with Rome. 
By the mid-first century BC, the Celtic tribes of central and eastern Gaul had developed social and political systems which supported recognizable primitive states. These peoples were ruled by elected magistrates, accountable to tribal assemblies or councils, and they had established codes of law. Kingship had been abolished among the more advanced peoples of Gaul, probably not long before 60 BC, as there still existed firm regulations which were intended to prevent individuals from re-establishing royal power. The tribes in the north of Gaul and those in Britain, however, possessed kings and among some of them at least the traditions of learning and religion fostered by druids were still strong. State-formation had thus begun in Gaul by the time of Julius Caesar's invasion in 58 BC, but had not spread throughout all the resident tribes. In Britain, an earlier stage of political development was widely represented in the mid-first century BC and was to endure for another century. 
In the island, the normal form of leadership in the late Iron Age was kingship, though that institution could take a variety of forms. As in other areas of northern Europe, kings could be elected for their martial qualities or their perceived ability to conduct specific military operations. Hereditary kingship also existed, though it is far from certain that it was the norm. Dual or even multiple kingship was maintained by some tribes. In Kent, for example, Caesar encountered four kings, probably not of four separate peoples. Half a century later, the Dobunni of western Britain appear to have had a system of dual kingship. The powers of most of the kings whose names are known were fairly certainly limited and would have depended heavily upon the measure of their success in war or other forms of dominance. From the late first century BC onward, recognition as tribal leaders by Rome may have counted as much as anything else. Rulers of the tribes most open to contact with the Roman world obviously came into consideration in this respect and it is not chance that these are the kings mentioned in classical sources. The readiness of the emperor Augustus, in particular, to treat with British kings, to receive them on occasion as suppliants or refugees, did much to strengthen the prestige of favoured rulers. 
The earliest British leader of whom anything is known is Cassivellaunus, the leader of the south-eastern Britons at the time of Caesar's second invasion of the island in 54 BC. The closeness of his name to that of the tribe of the Catuvellauni has suggested to some that he was the king of this people, but there is no certain proof of this. Caesar does not refer to him as a king; his position may well have been that of an elected war-leader of several tribes facing a common enemy. His base lay north of the Thames and his own stronghold probably was in the borders of modern Essex and Hertfordshire. Initially, Cassivellaunus faced up to Caesar's army in what is now Kent but after a reverse there he changed tactics, avoiding battle and impeding Roman attempts to forage for supplies, with some success. But when Roman forces entered his territory and seized his own stronghold, he realized that further resistance was pointless. Peace was arranged through Caesar's ally Commius, the chief conditions being that Cassivellaunus should pay tribute to Rome and respect the independence of the Trinovantes of Essex, on whom he had encroached and whose ruler, Mandubracius, he had driven out. It is unknown whether or not these terms were adhered to, but Cassivellaunus does not appear in the record after 54 BC. 
Far more significant in his legacy to the structure of power in late Iron Age Britain was the agent and ally of Caesar in his Gaulish enterprise: Commius. In 55 BC he was sent to Britain to warn the British tribes of the impending invasion, along with British legates who had earlier been dispatched to Caesar. His legation achieved nothing. 
Commius's loyalty to Caesar was not proof against the attractions of an independent Gaul and in 52 BC he defected to that cause in the great revolt against Roman occupation. He returned to Britain in either 51 or 50 and created a power base in the area of what is now Hampshire and west Sussex, where later sources locate the British Atrebates, presumably named after Commius's Gaulish subjects. Commius was one of the few British kings known to have founded a dynasty. Three kings in the south-east of the island, Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica ['see below'], placed the filiation 'son of Commius' on their coinages. This claim may not be literally true; it certainly requires longevity in Commius and Verica at least, but it does underline the high regard in which Commius was held in Britain. 
The heirs to Commius's power were Tincommius, Eppillus, and Verica, on the evidence of the coinage. Tincommius (fl. c.25 BC-AD 5) was the most senior, possibly succeeding Commius about 25 to 20 BC and ruling over the territory south of the middle Thames. A ruler signing himself Tincomarus has been identified in the same area. This rather than Tincommius may have been the proper form of the name. His later coinage is close to Roman prototypes and may well have been produced by Roman die-engravers. The metal supplies could have been supplied by imported Roman coins. These are suggestions of a treaty relationship with Rome and there is support from Tincommius's sole appearance in the historical record. The 'Res gestae' (the emperor Augustus's own account of his achievements) reports that he was received as a suppliant by the emperor, probably about AD 5, after flight from Britain. Eppillus (fl. c.AD 5-c.10) was his likely successor; some of his coins announce him as the king of Calleva (Silchester). Another series of his coins appears in the north of present-day Kent, where he may have held territory. He was followed by Verica (fl. c.AD 10-c.41), whose rule extended until AD 'c'.41, when he fled to the protection of Rome. Verica was probably reliant on Roman support. His coin types display a huge variety of classical designs and trade connections with the Roman world developed apace during his reign. 
North of the Thames, a kingdom centred on modern Hertfordshire and the Chilterns, with a major centre at Verulamium (St Albans), had emerged by 20 BC at the latest. The first named ruler in the region was Addedomarus (fl. 35 BC), probably from about 35 BC. Addedomarus may not have ruled for long, but he seems to have enlarged the stronghold at Camulodunum (Colchester). A rich burial there may be his. If so, it is of interest in that it contains a portrait medallion of Augustus, obviously a mark of Roman favour. Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.30 BC) succeeded him, a ruler who sought protection in Rome, like Tincommius, and who thus found record in the 'Res gestae' of Augustus. 
A series of rulers maintained a small kingdom in present-day Kent from the later first century BC. A king named Dubnovellaunus (fl. c.40 BC), earlier than his namesake north of the Thames, was active in northern Kent from about 40 BC. Eppillus seems to have extended his power eastward in the next generation, to be replaced by Vosenius (fl. c.AD 10) early in the first century AD. He is otherwise unknown and may have been a sub-king under the domination of the kingdom north of the Thames. Kent had certainly fallen under the control of that power by about AD 10 to 20, by which time most of south-eastern Britain was ruled by Cunobelinus, the son of Tasciovanus. Cunobelinus's supremacy during the period AD 10 to about AD 40 is underlined by Suetonius's reference to him as 'king of the Britons'. His authority extended not only over the major tribes of the Trinovantes and Catuvellauni, but also over the peoples immediately north of them and in northern Kent. His position may have been given further stability by a treaty relationship with Rome. Shortly before AD 10, unnamed British rulers had sent embassies to Augustus; Cunobelinus may have been one of this number. It suited Augustus and his successor Tiberius to maintain a stable relationship with the strongest king in southern Britain; there are no signs that either side harboured other intentions. A Roman invasion of Britain was not entertained in the last years of Augustus's reign; Tiberius had neither reason nor inclination to extend Roman territory in the west. On his side, Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by stirring up trouble and much to lose. There matters rested until Cunobelinus's death about AD 40. 
Cunobelinus had at least four sons, two of whom held sway in south-eastern Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43. These two, Caratacus and Togodumnus (d. AD 43), had swung away from their father's policy of non-provocation and had adopted a much more bellicose attitude, quite possibly in response to the invasion threat by the emperor Gaius (Caligula) in the spring of AD 40. A third son, Adminius (fl. c.AD 40), controlled part of what is now Kent before fleeing to the Roman world, perhaps expelled by his brothers. Caratacus and Togodumnus led the British forces which opposed the Roman invasion of AD 43. Their early strategy was to harry the invaders and delay their advance without risking a set-piece battle. When the British levies did come to grips, they were beaten back. Togodumnus was later killed and Caratacus retired to western Britain to continue the struggle for the next eight years. It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until AD 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces. 
Events immediately following the Roman invasion in AD 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus), the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle.

It is a striking fact that Caratacus was accepted as a war-leader by the Silures of present-day south Wales, a testimony not only to his authority but also to the weakness, or absence, of kingship within the tribe. Under his leadership, the Silures and their allies were able to tie down Roman forces in western Britain until AD 51. Staking all in a final battle in central Wales, Caratacus was defeated and fled to what he hoped would be refuge with Cartimandua (see below), the queen of the Brigantes in northern Britain. His hopes were sadly misplaced, for he had thrown himself on the mercy of a ruler whose adherence to Rome remained unshaken, and he was handed over to Roman forces. 
Events immediately following the Roman invasion in AD 43 included diplomatic manoeuvres towards treaty arrangements with those tribes with which contact had been made or which lay within reach. The most significant arrangement involved a king whose territory lay south of the Thames, most probably the area earlier controlled by the successors of Commius. This ruler was Cogidubnus (or Cogidumnus), the most influential British king in the service of Rome. He is mentioned by no source before the Roman conquest and no coins are known which bear his name. The precise date limits for his rule are thus uncertain, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that he was given the authority of a king shortly after AD 43. The bounds of his realm cannot be clearly defined. The finding of an inscription at Chichester naming him links him firmly with the area now forming west Sussex and adjacent Hampshire. The peoples additionally assigned to him are likely to have lain further west, in areas quickly annexed after AD 43. His constitutional position within the early province has long been debated, though direct evidence on the point is very slight. The emperor Claudius was prepared to countenance a wide variety of arrangements involving allied kings on and beyond frontiers. Cogidubnus's position could have been analogous to that enjoyed by several rulers on the upper Danube frontier in the mid-first century, but certainty is unattainable. 
The only western tribe whose kings are named on their coinage is the Dobunni of modern Gloucestershire and Somerset. About AD 15 to 20, the abbreviated names of a series of rulers appear: Corio, Bodvoc, Comux, Catti, Anted, and Eisu. The earliest are Corio (fl. AD 15-20) and Bodvoc (fl. AD 15-20). The latter's coins are widely distributed and he may have ruled over the entire territory of the Dobunni. Corio's issues circulated mainly in the southern area. This pair of rulers was succeeded by Comux and Catti, and they in turn by Anted and Eisu. A part of the Dobunni surrendered to Roman forces at an early stage in the invasion, presumably through an embassy, and a pro-Roman stance may have been maintained during the Roman occupation of western Britain in the next few years. If there was a formal alliance, however, between the Dobunni and Rome, it did not take shape as a client kingdom and no further rulers are heard of in this part of Britain. 
In the east, the Iceni of present-day Norfolk and Suffolk won early recognition as a tribe allied to Rome and their royal house continued to exercise at least a measure of power. A series of rulers is named on the coinage, none of them mentioned in other sources: Anted, Can Duro, and Saenu. At some date between AD 43 and about AD 50, one Prasutagus (d. AD 59/60) became king and pursued policies which Roman governors found acceptable. The accession of the emperor Nero in AD 54, however, opened a period in which the usefulness of native rulers within the empire was seriously questioned. When Prasutagus died, in either 59 or 60, the alliance between the Iceni and Rome was brought to an abrupt and brutal end. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman province and grants made to tribal magnates in the reign of Claudius were revoked. Prasutagus had left half his wealth to Nero, the rest to his two daughters. Roman officials and troops now began to treat both the kingdom and the royal patrimony as prizes of war and compounded the injury by flogging the widow of Prasutagus, Boudicca, and violating her daughters. This was savage treatment of an ally and the reaction of the Iceni (and the neighbouring Trinovantes, who had their own grievances) in rising in revolt was predictable. 
It was less predictable that the tribal warriors would be led by a woman: Boudicca (Boudica). By force of character as much as through her honoured position in the tribe, she was able to lead the rebels to attack the main citadels of Roman power and government in Britain: the 'colonia' (chartered city of Roman citizens) of Camulodunum, the Roman-backed native town of Verulamium, and the trading centre of Londinium (London). The revolt was the most serious faced by Rome in the west for half a century and it could easily have led to an evacuation of Britain. As it turned out, the British forces were no match for Roman discipline and tenacity. The governor Suetonius Paullinus rushed back from campaigning in the territory of the Ordovices (north Wales), left Londinium and Verulamium to their fate (Camulodunum having already fallen to the rebels), and chose a site on which to face the British in open battle. Boudicca and her warriors had thus far had easy targets in the cities, though they had also inflicted a defeat on a legionary force. But the Britons' reliance upon sheer numbers to break the Roman line was disastrous. The Romans weathered the storm, turned the Britons back, and slaughtered them against their own wagon-train. Boudicca escaped and is said to have taken her own life. She is the most exceptional of British leaders and it is understandable that she has enjoyed such posthumous fame. Unlike Cartimandua, she did not rule in her own right, but took charge of her people at a time of extreme crisis. That she did so herself, rather than appoint a male war-leader, is itself astonishing. Equally impressive is the fact that the warriors of her tribe were prepared to follow a woman into the battle line against the best soldiers of the ancient world. 
Only one woman is known to have ruled a British tribe, perhaps an indication of descent through the female line. This was Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes in the mid-first century AD, who owed her position, according to Tacitus, to her noble birth. The arrival of Roman forces on the southern borders of the Brigantes about AD 50 raised problems for the governance of the tribe. Alliance with the invading power held obvious advantage and that was the course which Cartimandua chose. But some of the Brigantian warriors were bent on resistance and they found a focus in Venutius, Cartimandua's husband. Originally he had been disposed to favour alliance with Rome and had accepted Roman armed support, possibly in some internal power play. By the mid-fifties, however, a quarrel had erupted between Cartimandua and the anti-Roman faction and Roman troops were sent in to assist the queen. For the next ten or fifteen years Cartimandua remained in charge but hardly in full control. In or shortly before AD 69, when Roman attention was fixed on civil strife, Cartimandua finally broke with Venutius and married his armour bearer Vellocatus. This could have been a last attempt by the queen to rebuild a warrior coalition which would hold to a pro-Roman line. If this was so, it failed. Venutius could attract enough support from the warrior elite to pose a serious threat and again Roman troops had to be deployed, this time to remove Cartimandua to safety in the Roman province. With the return of stable government to Rome in AD 70, Roman governors in Britain strengthened their hold on the north by direct annexation. The conquest of the Brigantes followed between AD 71 and 74. The leader or leaders who faced the Roman onslaught are not recorded; the fate of Venutius remains unknown, as does the further history of Cartimandua. 
In the far north of Britain, only one leader is named in the records: Calgacus (fl. c.AD 83/4), who rallied the tribes of Caledonia to face the Roman army under Gnaeus Julius Agricola after AD 80. The origins and early career of Calgacus are obscure, but Tacitus never refers to him as a king: in this area of Britain an elected war-leader seems more likely. In resolving to face the Roman army at 'Mons Graupius', an unlocated site in north-east Caledonia, he made a serious error of judgement. After withstanding the initial shock of the Caledonian attack, the Roman troops held firm and won a relatively easy victory. Had Calgacus continued his policy of harrying the Roman columns and avoiding battle, he might have been able to force a Roman withdrawal. Nothing more is heard of him after 'Mons Graupius', nor of other individual leaders in northernmost Britain. Kingship, of whatever kind, seems not to have emerged before the creation of the kingdom of Strathclyde in the late fifth century AD. 
After the collapse of Roman administration in the early fifth century, several British leaders are reported to have filled the power vacuum in the former Roman provinces; these include Vortigern, who sought to maintain his power by employing Germanic forces, Ambrosius Aurelianus, described by Gildas as a Roman rather than a Briton, who led the British resistance to Anglo-Saxon advance in the mid- to late fifth century, and possibly a second Ambrosius, who was directing British forces at the end of that century. All of these are shadowy figures who had no connection of any kind with the British leaders of four centuries before. The first two are, however, figures of history, unlike the most renowned of all early British leaders, Arthur, who must remain in the realm of myth.

Elgood, George Samuel (1851-1943), landscape and garden painter, was born on 26 February 1851 in Oxford Street, St Mary, Leicester, one of the ten children of Samuel Elgood (died 1874), a wool merchant, and his wife, Jane Octavia, the daughter of George Shirley of Mackworth, Derbyshire. In 1865 he was sent to Bloxham School, Banbury, but he stayed there only about a year. Although he seems to have been brought up in Suffolk, in the late 1860s, for financial reasons, the Elgood family moved back to Leicester, where Samuel Elgood ran a yarn agency. George attended the Leicester School of Art, studying under Wilmot Pilsbury; two of his brothers were also artists. Elgood sketched the Leicestershire countryside and its buildings with his brother Thomas -- a topographical and landscape painter -- Pilsbury, and the architectural painter John Fulleylove, who married his sister Elizabeth. His brother Richard founded the art metalwork firm of Elgood Brothers. 
Elgood began a course at the South Kensington School of Art (later the Royal College of Art), specializing in architecture, but had to return to Leicester in 1874 to carry on the family business after the death of his father. Travelling about the country for the yarn agency, however, gave him the opportunity to paint landscapes in his spare time. He exhibited his work for the first time at the Walker Gallery in Liverpool in 1874, and showed again in 1878 and 1880. He also exhibited at the Dudley Gallery and at the Baillie Gallery. In 1881 he became an associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours, and in 1882 an associate of the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours. Most of his garden paintings were shown between 1891 and 1925 at the Fine Arts Society, where they were enormously popular and invariably sold out to affluent patrons -- who included members of the royal family: Queen Victoria and Queen Mary both bought Elgood's pictures, many of which are still in the Royal Collection. 
It was after his marriage about 1881 to Mary Clephan, an artist and a woman of means, that Elgood began specializing in the painting of gardens; he was to become one of the best-loved garden painters of his time. Formal, architectural gardens were his passion, and he and his wife travelled to France, Italy, Spain, and Tangier. They spent several months in Italy every year, and visited Venice, Florence, and Rome, as well as Sicily. Although Elgood painted scenes such as 'Fishing Boats on the Lagoon' in Venice, it was his portrayals of the formal villa gardens of Renaissance Italy, including the Villa Borghese, the Villa D'Este, and the Villa Garzoni, which made his reputation. Among his subjects in England were many of the major gardens of the time -- gardens of historic interest such as Montacute, Penshurst, Compton Winyates, and Arley Hall. In an age before gardens were taken over by the National Trust, private owners proudly showed to their house party guests at the height of the season their immaculately kept herbaceous borders, rose-clad pergolas, trim yew hedges, and topiary work. These were the scenes Elgood was commissioned to immortalize in his paintings, scenes which mirrored a slice of social history in the indulgent years before the First World War when labour was both plentiful and cheap. 
Elgood's garden paintings reached a wide public after his two books were published. The first, 'Some English Gardens', was published in collaboration with Gertrude Jekyll in 1904; the second, 'Italian Gardens', appeared in 1907 and reflected his love of the formal garden in Renaissance style. He also illustrated 'The Garden that I Love', by Alfred Austen, first published in 1894. Elgood's style and the subject matter of his paintings reflected his architectural training. With his eye for detail and the contrasts of pattern and texture of building materials, he accurately depicted balustrading, finialled gate piers, flights of steps, and lichen-covered walls. The colours of his palette were mellow -- soft browns, greens, and blues -- as if perceived through a misty veil. No gaudy coloured flower-bedecked borders appeared in his paintings, which marked him apart from other contemporary garden painters such as Beatrice Parsons and Arthur Rowe. 
In 1908 Elgood moved to Knockwood at Tenterden in Kent. The garden he made surrounding the timber-framed house, with its topiary work, mellow stone walls and paths, pergola, and cottage garden flowers, was the subject of many paintings. Elgood's bearded, angular face, with its earnest expression, betrayed an eccentric, anti-social character. He was often critical of others, including garden designers such as Thomas Mawson. As he grew older, his idiosyncrasies became more pronounced: he lived without electric light or piped water until his death in 1943. When the council decided to cut down trees on his boundary he sat in his shed pointing a shotgun at them until they finally had to give in and the trees were saved (Eckstein). After his death, on 21 October 1943 at Knockwood, some of his antiquities and paintings went to the Maidstone Museum.

Wilton, Robb (1881-1957), comedian, was born on 28 August 1881 at 34 Tillotson Street, Everton, Liverpool, the son of Joseph Smith, compositor, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Poland, actress. He was soundly educated locally and was prepared for the engineering trade, but in 1899 he made his stage debut at the Theatre Royal, Garston, Liverpool, which was known colloquially as the Old Blood Tub from its penchant for melodrama. He played the villain for over three years yet, prophetically, during scene-changes he would occupy the audience with his amusing Pie-face characterization. While playing the villain in 'The Greed of Gold' at the Alexandra Theatre, Hull, in 1903, he met and courted the play's heroine, the actress Florence Palmer (died 1956); defying theatrical convention the villain married the heroine at Holy Trinity Church, Stalybridge, on 21 January 1904. This was to be a devotedly close partnership both professionally and personally: Florence acted as her husband's associate in sketches, and they sedulously avoided work that required them to be apart. Their only child, Robert, was born in 1907 and died in 1943 having fallen from a window during the wartime blackout. 
Wilton turned more specifically to comedy in late 1903 at the Liverpool Lyric and Pavilion theatres, and was spotted by the impresario Sir Walter De Frece, who offered him a three-year contract. He thus embarked on a solid career, making his London debut at the Holborn Empire in 1909, and touring to Australia, Canada, and the USA, chiefly performing his sketches as fireman, policeman, prison governor, and First World War soldier. After some twenty years as a single and double act on the halls, his stage success as the Confidential Comedian brought him a royal command performance in 1926: his sketch 'The Magistrate' served as a precursor of his later courtroom antics. He quickly adapted to the new medium of radio, making his first broadcast in 1922 from Savoy Hill, and he also appeared in films, several of which, including 'The Fire Brigade' (1928) and 'Stars on Parade' (1935), happily preserve his stage sketches. 
On stage Robb Wilton presented a burly but very still figure -- save for the rounded, pallid countenance which was a veritable circus for the emotions, with eyes and tongue ceaselessly active and with, famously, the right-hand fingers beating out a series of puzzled tics across ear, brow, cheek, and lips. The Lancastrian voice was gruff, measured, and halting in bewilderment. His catch-phrase was the widely recognizable lugubrious opening line 'The day war broke out...'. Wilton described himself as a 'comedy character actor' and he depended on his well-observed portrayal of minor officialdom in self-made scripts for his standard cameos which, as he remarked, would have been worthless to any other comic. His great strength lay in his timing, in what 'The Times' (17 February 1956) termed 'a tug of war between performer and audience'. He vied with Jimmy James as the shrewdest 'waiter' in the business. For example, when he told how his wife, Rita, insisted he must find work, the pause until his almost sighed rejoinder -- 'ee, she's a cruel tongue, that woman' -- was inordinately lengthy and beautifully judged. His forte lay in the gentle probing of petty bureaucratic officiousness. It evoked the fine tradition of Shakespeare's inefficient constable, Dogberry, in 'Much Ado about Nothing', and a whole stream of Dickensian inventions, such as Mr Bumble in 'Oliver Twist'. 
Robb Wilton created several prototypes of officials who balanced lethargic dignity with fussy inaction, four of which were especially noteworthy. The first was the policeman, confronted at his station desk by a Florence Palmer eager to confess to the poisoning of her husband, and the second the fireman, again beset by a distraught Florence, her house ablaze: 'It's a prettier run', he explained to her anxious householder concerned at the extensive itinerary he planned for the fire engine. Then there was his 'Court of not so common pleas' over which he presided as Mr Muddlecombe JP, dispensing confused justice and as unmoved by critical urgencies as by the dictates of rational sense. This caricature ensured his top stage billing as surely as it made him a household radio name from 1937 onwards. His fourth abiding creation was the home guardsman, peevish and resentful of 'Rita's' cold scepticism (advised that he wouldn't know who Hitler was, come an invasion, he commented with suitably plaintive timing: 'doesn't she know I've got a tongue in me head?') and immune to her scorn when the headquarters proved to be a little hut behind the Dog and Pullet pub. 
During the Second World War, with its emphasis on civilian involvement, Wilton found his exact niche. Confounded by frustrating controls and regulations, the embattled citizenry found enormous solace in his skits on Bumbledom. He represented the British myth of 'muddling through', the comic muse's reflection of the mood of the nation. 
Florence Palmer died in February 1956, and her husband did not long survive her. Robb Wilton made his last radio broadcast for 'Blackpool Night' in August 1956 and, following a bladder operation, died in Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool on 1 May 1957.

Scafe, John (1776-1843), poet and writer on geology, was born on 19 June 1776 in London, the only son of William Scafe (1744-1808), barrister, of The Leazes, Tanfield, Durham, and his wife, Frances, 'nee' Hodgson, of Fieldhouse, Darlington. Scafe matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 21 January 1794 but never graduated. In 1799 he obtained a commission as ensign in the army, and in 1805 attained the rank of captain in the 43rd regiment of foot. He resigned from the army in 1808 on the death of his father. 
At Oxford, Scafe penned an 'Elegy to the River Isis'. While on army service on Minorca in 1800, he composed other verses on 'Beautiful scenery' and these, together with poems written while serving in Dublin in 1806, were subsequently published. Scafe first ventured into print in 1815 with a hesitant edition (six copies) of 'Poems in Four Parts' published by J. Graham at Alnwick, where Scafe was then living. Four further volumes in similarly small editions were issued in 1817 and 1818. In 1818 Emerson Charnley of Newcastle published Scafe's collected 'Poems' (150 copies). Scafe's publishers' lists of subscribers show that the majority were gentry living in Alnwick and its neighbourhood. One poem, 'The Velocipede' of 1819, suggests an interest in technology, this early form of bicycle having been invented in Germany only two years previously. 
Scafe, of whose poems it was later noted 'few are very bad' ('Alnwick poets', 334-5, 351), might have remained forgotten had not one of his volumes, a 'jeu d'esprit' called 'King Coal's Levee' (issued at Alnwick in 1818 in an edition of twenty-five copies), come to the attention of members of the Oxford school of geology late in 1818. The work treated the order of stratification of English rocks, and the utility of such knowledge, as a poetic court scene, and it was inspired by William Phillips's 'Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales'. Geology was being popularized by the Geological Society in London (to which the last three editions of Scafe's 'Levee' were dedicated). William Daniel Conybeare helped to expand the second edition (1819), with explanatory notes by William Buckland 'comprehending all the leading features of geology' (Buckland to Greenough, 26 March 1819, Greenough archives, UCL). Third (500 copies) and fourth editions (750) appeared in London in 1819 and 1820. 
The book caused a sensation. Some accused Scafe of 'intending Personalities in it as Meaning to ridicule the Duke of Northumberland's Publick Days at Alnwick Castle' (Buckland to Mary Cole, 13 July 1819, NMG Wales). Others saw wider, national significance in such seditious times, with 'King Coal' the symbolic monarch and 'The Pebbles' the rabble -- Robert Bakewell (1767-1843) published a mocking commentary on this interpretation in his 'Geological Primer in Verse' (1820), a work long thought to be by Scafe himself. In Germany, Goethe was differently impressed, since the book 'contains all the knowledge of geology a man wants' (Morley, 369) and showed how the English 'disseminate through both serious and light poetry what everyone ought to know' (Goethe, 332). Goethe planned a translation (1824) which was never completed. 
The success of 'King Coal's Levee' led to a sequel issued anonymously in 1820, 'Court News... and the Errants', the latter inspired by Buckland's 'Table of the order of... strata' of 1818, in an edition of 250. This was printed and published by those involved with the earlier volume, so Scafe's authorship seems certain. 
Scafe may have become interested in geology through the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he appears to have been a member from 1814. In 1852 Scafe's posthumous 'Minutes of the geology of Holy Island', with an originally coloured geological plan, appeared in Raine's 'History and Antiquities of North Durham'. Scafe never married and lived at Alnwick from 1815. By 1838 he had moved to Bamburgh, where he was one of those who first brought the heroic exploits of Grace Darling (1815-1842) in 1838 to public attention. Here he died on 24 December 1843 intestate, leaving an estate of under $450.

Gower, Pauline Mary de Peauly (1910-1947), aviator, was born on 22 July 1910 at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, the younger of two daughters of Sir Robert Vaughan Gower (1880-1953), solicitor and Conservative MP, and his first wife, Dorothy Susie Elenor (1882-1936), the only daughter of Herbert McClellan Wills JP. As her father had considerable financial resources the family lived comfortably in a large house close to Tunbridge Wells. Pauline and her sister were educated at the Sacred Heart Convent in Tunbridge Wells, initially as day students and then later as boarders, although their home, Sandown Court, Pembury, was only 3 miles away. The family was not Roman Catholic but the school's principal, Mother Ashton Case, was a cousin of Pauline's mother, which, along with the school's excellent reputation, may have influenced the parents' choice. Pauline fitted into school life easily and well. She was talented and able, which, combined with her sunny personality, made her popular with both staff and her fellow students. By the time she was in her mid-teens she had developed an abiding affection for both the institution and the religion. On 16 July 1926, just before her sixteenth birthday, she was received into the Catholic church. 
After leaving school at eighteen Pauline Gower went through a London season as a debutante and was presented at court. Unsure what to do with her life, she played with ideas of furthering her interests in such things as music, Greek mythology, photography, horse riding, and politics, but she soon settled on the notion of becoming a pilot. Her interest in aviation was kindled when she went for a joyride during her last year at school. When she was nineteen her decision had been made: she would do all she could to make a career in aviation and, in the face of her father's vehement disapproval, she proceeded to arrange flying lessons. Her parents refused all financial help so she raised the necessary money by giving violin lessons. After only seven hours of instruction she made her first solo flight and by 4 August 1930, after fifteen hours and fifteen minutes flying time, was granted an A (private pilot's) licence. She was the first woman to obtain a flying certificate from Phillips and Powis School of Aviation and the first woman to fly solo after such a short period of instruction. So as to fulfil her ambition of earning a living from flying she enrolled at the London aeroplane club, Stag Lane, in order to train for a B (commercial) licence. It was here that she became friends with Amy Johnson, recently returned from a record-breaking solo trip to Australia, and met Dorothy Spicer, who was to become her partner in various aviation ventures. On 13 July, having successfully completed the night-flying test, she was awarded a B licence, becoming the third woman in the world to do so. 
While training, Pauline Gower and Dorothy Spicer had decided to establish a joyriding business, with Pauline as the pilot and Dorothy as the engineer. This they did, initially with a hired Gipsy Moth and later with a secondhand Simmonds Spartan two-seater, a twenty-first birthday present given to Pauline by her father, who had by this time become supportive of her activities. With Wallingford, Berkshire, as their headquarters they flew to various parts of the country to provide joyrides and air-taxi trips. Initially they took a light-hearted approach to flying, but their attitude changed when one day Pauline discovered that she had carelessly taken off without adequately bolting the aircraft's folding wings in position. They both settled down and studied their respective areas with great diligence and considerable aptitude. Pauline eventually obtained every flying certificate possible and Dorothy every one in aeronautical engineering. 
In 1932 the pair joined the Crimson Fleet air circus of Modern Airways Ltd and, later, British Hospitals Air Pageant. At the time Britain had gone 'air mad' and several air circuses were operating around the country, which, much like traditional circuses, would travel from town to town. After the rigours of air-circus life the partners decided to establish Air Trips Ltd, an aerial-taxi and joyriding business operating from the holiday town of Hunstanton, Norfolk. It was the first aviation company to be wholly owned and staffed by women. By 1936 they were touring again, this time with Tom Campbell Black's British Empire Air Display. Pauline was appointed the chief pilot and Dorothy the senior engineer. 
While she was with the circus in Scotland, Pauline learned of her mother's sudden and tragic death. Feeling that she should support her father she gave up touring. Air Trips Ltd moved into its final phase when the partners established an aerial garage at an airfield on Hayling Island in Hampshire. They found the work dissatisfying and as both had many other irons in the fire they decided to end the business. Their final task was to write a book, 'Women with Wings', published in 1938. Amy Johnson wrote the foreword, Pauline the body of the text, and Dorothy the prologue and epilogue. 
In the second half of 1938 Pauline's many and varied activities were recognized with a variety of honours and appointments, including her election as a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society and the conferment of the dignity of officer of the venerable order of St John of Jerusalem. She became sought after as a speaker and was asked to serve on various committees, among them the Gorrell committee, set up to look into the matter of air safety, upon which she was not only the youngest member but also the only woman. In 1939 she was appointed a commissioner of the Civil Air Guard. 
War seemed inevitable and Britain was particularly vulnerable as the Royal Air Force was small with an insufficient number of pilots. So that RAF pilots could concentrate on combat duties, such tasks as ferrying new aircraft from the factories to the squadrons and returning with damaged ones were delegated to the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). On 1 December 1939 Pauline was appointed as an ATA second officer and given the job of forming a women's section. At the beginning there were only nine women pilots flying light trainers; as the war progressed more were appointed until the number of women serving in the auxiliary exceeded 150. The women pilots eventually flew all types of aircraft, from light trainers to four-engined bombers. The value of their contribution was finally recognized when Pauline obtained the same pay for her women pilots as the men received for doing the same work. Pauline herself achieved the rank of commandant, and in 1942 she was appointed MBE. Pauline Gower's leadership abilities, organizational skill, and contribution to aviation were further recognized when she was appointed a director of British Overseas Airways on 26 May 1943, thereby becoming the first woman to obtain such a position in any national airline. Her workload increased enormously as she was still responsible for the women's section of the ATA. However, she was able to find the time for a personal life: during Easter 1945 she became engaged to Wing Commander William Cusack Fahie (1918-1972) and they were married on 2 June 1945 at the Brompton Oratory, London. Her life suddenly and unexpectedly ended on 2 March 1947, at her home, 2 The Vale, Chelsea, when she died of a heart attack, having just given birth to twin boys, Paul and Michael. She was buried on 7 March at the new cemetery, Tunbridge Wells.

Fish, Elizabeth Mary Jane (1860-1944), schoolteacher, was born at 83 North Woodside Road, Glasgow, on 22 December 1860, the daughter of William Fish, a city missionary, and his wife, Jane McNaughton. Her schooling took place at Sharp's Institution in Perth, where her parents had married and where her father was chaplain. She returned to Glasgow to pursue a career in teaching, beginning as a pupil teacher at Henderson Street public school, where she came first in Scotland in the queen's scholarship examination, and went as a student to the Glasgow Church of Scotland Training College. In June 1881 she taught at Runford Street public school; two years later she moved to Shields Road public school. In 1895 she taught at the Pupil Teachers' Institute, Glasgow, moving to Whitehill higher grade school in 1907, and in 1918 to John Street higher grade school, both in Glasgow. She also conducted evening classes for the cure of stammering, and lectured in hygiene and physiology at the Royal Technical College and the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science. She resisted calls from eugenicists to introduce 'race improvement' and 'sex hygiene' into the classrooms, seeing the latter as a parental responsibility. 
A versatile scholar, Miss Fish became an LLA (lady literate in arts) of St Andrews University in 1885, and studied Italian, for which she was awarded the Society of Arts medal, as well as French. She was president of the Scottish Modern Languages Association for two years, becoming principal teacher of modern languages at Bellahouston Academy, Glasgow, in 1920, from where she retired in August 1925. 
Miss Fish held office in the Glasgow branch of the Class Teachers' Association, was president of the Glasgow local association of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), and was active in the institute's annual ladies' meeting. She wrote for the EIS paper, the 'Educational News'. In June 1913 she was elected the first woman president of the EIS, polling 4822 votes against three male candidates whose combined votes totalled 3068. In her presidential address to the annual congress in January 1914, she called for improvements in teachers' salaries. She pointed to the declining numbers of men attracted to teaching as a career, but while acknowledging the principle of equal pay for male and female teachers, she argued that: 'if we teachers ask that the salaries of all teachers be now raised to the level of what men teachers think theirs ought to be, we shall alienate the sympathies of a public not yet convinced of the justice of our demand. ('Scottish Educational Journal', 39, 9 Jan 1914, 30)' Her obituary in the 'Glasgow Herald' (22 March 1944) nevertheless saw her as 'the champion of women teachers in Scotland', and though she considered it unwise to demand equal pay, she condemned the low pay of women teachers and warned that, as new careers opened up for women in medicine and the civil service, there would be a decline in the quality as well as the numbers of women entering the classrooms, paralleling the decline of men in the previous half century. Miss Fish died in Paisley Infirmary on 21 March 1944 after a fall in her home, Morven, 18 Dalhousie Road, Milliken Park, Renfrewshire.

Frankland, Grace Coleridge (1858-1946), bacteriologist, was born on 4 December 1858 at Beech Holme, Wimbledon, Surrey, the youngest daughter and ninth child of Joseph Toynbee (1815-1866), a celebrated aural surgeon, and his wife, Harriet, daughter of Nathaniel Reynolds Holmes. Little is known about her early life except that she was educated at home, in Germany, and for one year at Bedford College, London. Her scientific predilections seem to have developed seriously after her marriage on 17 June 1882 to Percy Faraday Frankland (1858-1946), second son of Sir Edward Frankland; a chemistry lecturer (later professor), he shared her special interest in bacteriological problems, particularly where these impinged upon matters concerning public health. 
Grace was one of the British women scientists who made notable contributions to research in the medical sciences during the late nineteenth century, a time when opportunities for women to study science were limited. She achieved success for her independent contributions as well as her collaborative work. Her first publication, in 1887, was a study of micro-organisms in air, and was the outcome of work she and her husband undertook. This was followed in 1888 by their joint studies of micro-organisms in water and soil. Other joint papers published in British scientific journals in 1889 and 1890 included a study of nitrification, of the chemical reactions which occurred in fermentation processes, and of the possibility of using fermentation processes to prepare chemically pure substances. A bacteriological appendix which she compiled appeared in another joint publication on sugar fermentation in 1892. She was also co-author of two volumes, 'Micro Organisms in Water: their Significance, Identification and Removal' (1894) and the biography 'Pasteur' (1898). Percy Frankland was magnanimous in his praise of his wife, dedicating his book 'Our Secret Friends and Foes' (1882) to 'the companion whose sympathy and invaluable assistance have so greatly enhanced the enjoyment of scientific work' ('JCS', 1998). 
Independently, Grace Frankland was probably best-known for her monograph 'Bacteria in Daily Life' (1903). She was also a regular contributor of original research papers to a number of journals, especially 'Nature'; the subjects covered included typhoid fever epidemics in America, bacteria and carbonated waters, and Dr Yersin and the plague virus. Elected a fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society in 1900, and one of the first twelve women scientists admitted to the Linnean Society of London, in December 1904, her petition for entry into the Chemical Society in October 1904 was unsuccessful. 
Grace and Percy Frankland had one son, Edward Percy; they were a popular couple whose home, which exuded a heady atmosphere of scientific adventure, was always open to visitors. They moved to Loch Awe in Argyll after Percy retired in 1919, and spent much of their time enjoying music, gardening, and travelling. Grace Frankland died at Loch Awe on 5 October 1946, a victim of senility, and was buried in the churchyard of Glenorchy, Argyll. Her husband died three weeks later.

Gay, Maisie (1878-1945), actress and singer, was born on 7 January 1878 at 27 Alexandra Road, Willesden, London, the eldest daughter in the family of at least two daughters and one son of Peter Noble ('b'. 1844/5), wine merchant's clerk, commercial traveller, and later licensed victualler, and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth 'nee' Pratt ('b'. 1852/3). She was educated in Germany and at the North London Collegiate School for Girls. By 1901 she was married to Arthur Wells ('b'. 1860/61), a foreign dealer, though her husband is not mentioned in accounts of her, and she came to use the surname Munro-Noble in addition to her stage name of Maisie Gay. A chance conversation with a chorus girl on a bus made her enthusiastic about a theatrical career, and she made her first stage appearance, in the chorus of 'The Cherry Girl' by Seymour Hicks, in Blackpool in November 1903. The following year she joined the company of theatre manager George Edwardes on tour in J. T. Tanner's musical play 'A Country Girl', later playing the leading part of Nan over 1000 times between 1904 and 1907. She toured in other Edwardes productions as well as those of the company of playwright and theatre manager George Dance. In April 1908 Gay made her debut in the West End at the Hicks Theatre as Fifi in 'A Waltz King', followed by Clementine in George Grossmith's 'The Girls of Gottenberg'. The latter led to her being cast as Mrs Farquhar, 'an impecunious woman of fashion', in the hugely successful musical by J. T. Tanner, 'Our Miss Gibbs', a role she played for almost two years. This also marked her first appearance at the Gaiety Theatre which, with the Adelphi, was where she appeared most often. 
In 1911 Gay toured as Madame Blum in Tanner's 'The Quaker Girl'; she played the same part in London, then in New York and across the United States -- in 160 towns in 266 days. Back in London in 1913 she appeared in Tanner's musical farce 'The Girl on the Film' before going again to America, appearing in 'Phyllis' in Boston, as Adelaide Fontaine in 'High Jinks', by Frederick Lonsdale, touring through 1914 and 1915, and in 'Sybil', by Harry Graham, in New York. She also appeared in the 1915 American film 'The Siren's Song'. In London in 1916 she followed a reprise of her role in 'High Jinks' by starring in a successful series of musical comedies ('The Boy', by Fred Thompson, 'The Beauty Spot', adapted from the French by Arthur Anderson, and 'Soldier Boy', by Rida Johnson Young) and, especially, revues. Her revue debut was in 1919 in 'The Whirligig', by Albert de Courville, followed by his 'Pins and Needles' in 1921 (reprised in New York the following year). Next came 'A to Z', by Dion Titheradge and 'Snap', by Ronald Jeans and Titheradge, both in 1922 (introducing the song 'March with Me' in the former, and touring the provinces with the latter). She also appeared in Noel Coward's 'London Calling!' in 1923, 'Charlot's Revue of 1924' and 'Charlot's Revue of 1925', both by R. Jeans, and Coward's 'This Year of Grace!' in 1928. In 1929 Gay appeared in the last named in Melbourne and toured major cities in Australia. The following year she was in 'Cochran's 1930 Revue', by Beverley Nichols. Cochran later wrote in tribute that 'in her particular genre Maisie Gay was unique and irreplaceable' ('The Times'). Later musical comedies included 'Better Days' in 1925, 'Wildflower' in 1926, and 'White Birds' and 'Peggy-Ann', both in 1927. 
In December 1930, at the Winter Garden, Gay succeeded Sophie Tucker as Georgia Madison in 'Follow a Star'. Also that year she made her first sound film, 'To Oblige a Lady', written by Edgar Wallace from his play, in which she again sang her song from 'London Calling!', 'What Love Means to Girls Like Me'. She then appeared as Mrs Harris, the charlady, in Wallace's play 'The Old Man', subsequently appearing in the film version in 1932. Her last appearance on the London stage was the same year at the Queen's Theatre as Bibbo in 'Caravan' before ill health forced her premature retirement. She suffered from severe arthritis; at times she had had to use the downstairs dressing-room with the chorus girls instead of that upstairs for the principal because of the great difficulty she had in using stairs. 
According to an early biographer of Noel Coward, 'Maisie Gay was plump and her pop-eyed face as round as a full moon' (Cole Lesley, 'The Life of Noel Coward', 1967, 77). Gay wrote an autobiographical volume 'Laughing through Life' in 1931. Upon her retirement she had built a small house, Kingsdown, at Box in Wiltshire, a few miles north-east of Bath. However, she was practically bedridden and her activity was limited largely to reading and listening to the radio. She did, though, give a series of talks for invalids for BBC radio in 1941. Gay died, unmarried, at her home, Kingsdown, on 13 September 1945.

Goodenough, Ethel Mary (1900-1946), naval officer, was born on 12 January 1900 in India and baptized on 14 February at Simla, in the Siwalik hills of northern India, the daughter of Captain Herbert Lane Goodenough (died before 1946) of the Indian army and his wife, Muriel Grace, 'nee' Mitford (died after 1946). She was privately educated and in 1918 joined the civilian staff at the Admiralty in London, becoming an established civil servant at the end of the war. She held a number of posts, preferring that of assistant secretary to Sir Oswyn Murray, secretary to the Admiralty, as this brought her closer to the Royal Navy, her main interest, for there were several serving officers among her relatives. Angela Goodenough, as she was generally known, gained a detailed working knowledge of the Admiralty and made many friends among the naval staff, who were later to prove invaluable. In 1937 she was appointed chief woman officer, responsible for the welfare of all female civil servants and for recruiting temporary staff. 
Goodenough's experience and knowledge of the Admiralty led to her appointment in April 1939 as deputy director in the newly created Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS). Her appointment was popular among naval staff and her contacts proved very useful when negotiating conditions for the fledgeling service. She was principally concerned with welfare, including clothing and accommodation, and for relations with the press, a side of the work in which she took great pride and interest. Her strong views on what was required, coupled with a great determination and a happy knack of getting her own way without rows, laid the foundations for the good welfare conditions in the service. After a second deputy director was appointed, she remained in charge of welfare aspects until autumn 1944. 
As the war in the East intensified, a senior officer was required to oversee the welfare of the growing number of Wrens posted to the region. Goodenough was selected and, although she was reluctant to leave the familiar circumstances of the Admiralty, she accepted the appointment as superintendent on the staff of the commander-in-chief, East Indies, and in September 1944 left for Ceylon. She made a great success of the job, finding happiness and many new friends. She contracted infantile paralysis, however, and, after two days suffering from what was thought to be a light fever, she became unconscious and died in Colombo on 10 February 1946. She was buried there the following day with a full captain's bodyguard, the funeral being attended by over 200 Wrens and a large number of naval officers. Later in the month the WRNS directorate arranged memorial services at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, and at St Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore, both of which drew many of her friends from the Admiralty and naval services.

Howel, Thomas (c.1480-1537), merchant and philanthropist, was the son of John Howel, a prosperous and well-established merchant of Bristol, and his wife, Alice, who subsequently married Sir Thomas Morgan of Pen-coed, Monmouthshire. His father's family seems originally to have come from Monmouthshire. Born and bred in Bristol, Howel went to Spain about 1502 as an apprentice to Hugh Elyot, a merchant of Bristol. Howel married Joanna Christian, who proved to be an admirable wife and business associate to him. By 1507 he had moved to London and become a freeman of the Drapers' Company, and in 1512 he enlisted the interest of William Roche, warden of that company. In 1514 he was retained by the earl of Surrey for military service in France. He joined the livery of the Drapers' Company in 1517 and in 1527 became its junior warden. 
By this time, Howel had long been a very successful and wealthy merchant engaged in Anglo-Spanish commercial exchanges. He traded in fine cloths of all kinds which he exported to Spain and in return imported oil, alum, iron, raisins, and wine. He stated in June 1528 that he had been in Spain on and off for about twenty-six years, and in that year he took up permanent residence in Seville. He left his wife to look after his affairs in London; she died in 1529. One of the most interesting remains of Howel's activities as a merchant is the remarkable ledger he kept. Deposited with the Drapers' Company during his lifetime and preserved in Drapers' Hall ever since, it is of unique interest for two reasons: for the light it sheds on Anglo-Spanish trade during the early Tudor period, and as the earliest surviving English example of double-entry bookkeeping. 
Howel's health was failing by 1536, when he drew up his third and final will, and he died and was buried in Seville the following year. Under the terms of his will he left by far the biggest sixteenth-century charitable endowment for marriage subsidies. Having no children, Howel bequeathed 12,000 ducats in gold to his company to be employed in the purchase of land so as to raise 400 ducats a year to provide marriage portions for deserving Welsh maidens, with an indicated preference for orphan girls of his own lineage. Although many benefited from the bequest, it also gave rise to much controversy and litigation. Finally, the report of the fourth Charity Commission of 1837 dealt with Howell's Trust among other charities. A private act of parliament (1853) provided for a scheme to regulate Howell's Charity. In 1860 two girls' schools, each known as Howell's School, were established, one at Llandaff and the other at Denbigh. They have since become two of the best-known schools in Wales.

Strudwick, Ethel (1880-1954), headmistress, was born on 3 April 1880 at 14 Edith Villas, Fulham, London, the only child of John Melhuish Strudwick (1849-1937), artist, and his wife, Harriet Reed (1856-1941). Her father was one of the Pre-Raphaelites, and Ethel as a child met several of the group. She was educated at Queen Elizabeth's School, West Kensington, where she was a star pupil whom her teachers had 'to praise sufficiently without sounding fulsome' (Hughes, 175). She won the coveted Reed scholarship to Bedford College, London, and graduated with honours in classics in 1900. After two years as a classics mistress at the Laurels School, Rugby, she returned to Bedford College, where she graduated MA with distinction (1904), taught classics (1903-13), and became head of the Latin department (1909). 
In 1913 Strudwick was appointed headmistress of the City of London School for Girls in succession to Alice Blagrave, so embarking on the first of two headships whose tenure embraced the social changes from before the First World War until after the second. Almost immediately she was plunged into the problems of running a school in wartime. Her pupils were encouraged to make garments for the troops, work on the land, and raise money for the Red Cross. After the war she created a physics laboratory and introduced social work by the school in south London. Under her influence many of her pupils secured important posts in the new career opportunities available for women. 
Out of forty-six candidates Ethel Strudwick was appointed high mistress of St Paul's Girls' School in Brook Green, London, in 1927. For the second time she succeeded a founder head (her predecessor, Frances Gray, having been appointed in 1903) and was faced with the task of preserving young but cherished traditions while moving forward. She herself taught a half timetable and, as at both Bedford College and the City of London School, generations of pupils were inspired by the lucidity and clarity of her teaching, enthralled by her diction, and absorbed by her scholarship, whether in the classics, literature, or the scriptures. 
As high mistress Strudwick immediately initiated a programme to build a new science block, which was opened in 1933, 'the last word in equipment and comfort', she told parents at speech day (St Paul's School for Girls, Strudwick box). Her philosophy of education found expression in a volume of essays by headmistresses, published in 1937, in which she wrote that 'schools exist to show how many possibilities there are, not to tie upon young shoulders precisely the same little packet of knowledge to take out into the world' ('The Head Mistress Speaks', 113). Schools were to her not so much workshops as places of mutual trust and fellowship. 
In 1939 the imminent prospect of war raised various options for the school's immediate future. Strudwick decided on an evacuation policy involving 183 girls going to Wycombe Abbey School in Buckinghamshire, where they spent the winter of 1939-40. A small but influential lobby wished the school to go to Canada. At the height of the invasion crisis in May 1940, the high mistress canvassed parents, who voted by 155 to 44 to return to Brook Green -- though by the autumn term pupil numbers had shrunk to sixty-five. For the second time in her career Strudwick balanced the needs of education and the demands of war. She sought, with some difficulty, to get girls involved in work on the land, took her own share (with staff and pupils over sixteen) in fire-watching, taught in the air raid shelter, and stood 'as a bulwark against all that was uncertain, hazardous and fearful' (Harrison, 26). The exercise of authority -- whether in war or peace -- seemed to come to her effortlessly, and burdens were carried serenely. 
School numbers quickly rose to 300 and at the end of the war Strudwick could tell the governors that not a day passed without parental 'letters begging for admission for their daughters' (St Paul's School for Girls, archives, report to governors, 30 May 1945). When she retired in 1948 she was hailed as one who had 'brought to her profession distinction and greatness' ('Paulina', 2). 
Strudwick was already a public figure, for whom retirement meant simply more time to give to her various interests. She had been on the senate of the University of London since 1921 (and remained so until 1952) and a trustee of the London Museum since 1934. From 1931 to 1933 she was president of the Association of Headmistresses and in 1937 she became the first president of the British Federation of Business and Professional Women. She was a governor of four educational institutions and became, in 1948, a member of the council of the Girls' Public Day School Trust. 
Ethel Strudwick was no militant feminist; as a young woman she had 'silently disapproved from the Embankment' (Harrison, 14) of her suffragette friends marching to the Albert Hall. But she contributed to the cause by demonstrating the highest professionalism, setting a model for women's careers after the first 'heroic' phase of the foundation of modern day schools for girls. Unlike many of the pioneers of the girls' school movement, she had herself undergone a formal schooling, and she set out to make this an enriching experience for later generations. Her devotion to liberalism was fundamental to her outlook: 'liberalis' in her commitment to the concept of freedom, justice, and educational opportunities for all, and Liberal in her political affiliation. She served from 1943 on the Liberal Party council and, in 1949, became president of the Women's Liberal Federation, campaigning in the general election of 1950. Yet this tall, possibly austere, figure with a profound sense of obligation to society was not without humour. She could collapse in 'gusts of uncontrollable laughter' (Harrison, 33) in the theatre (to which she allegedly went on 1600 occasions), act in staff reviews, and struggle to conceal her mirth when rebuking a pupil for some misdemeanour. Leisure times found her walking with friends as much as 30 miles a day in the Lake District or the Dolomites. She claimed no aptitude for domestic chores but rejoiced when a Paulina commented that her education at St Paul's had given her something to think about when she did the washing up. 
Ethel Strudwick's work was recognized when she was appointed OBE in 1936 (Edward VIII's only honours list) and advanced to CBE in 1948. She died at her home, 15 Leinster Avenue, Mortlake, Surrey, on 15 August 1954, and was cremated at Mortlake crematorium five days later. There was a memorial service in St Paul's Cathedral; 'a great lady and a great leader' (Harrison, 40), declared the preacher.

Smith, (Ellen) Marion Delf- (1883-1980), botanist, was born on 31 January 1883 at 6 Capel Road, East Ham, Essex, the daughter of Thomas William Herbert Delf, an insurance secretary, and Catherine Mary 'nee' Bridges. She was educated at James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich, and attended Girton College, Cambridge, on several scholarships. At Girton she earned a first class in both parts of the natural sciences tripos, and was joint winner of the Montefiore prize in 1906, her final year. Originally planning to stay at Cambridge to study plant physiology with F. F. Blackman, she instead accepted an offer to teach botany at Westfield College, University of London. 
At this time Westfield College offered only elementary and intermediate level courses in science, so students wishing to obtain the BSc degree had to complete their courses elsewhere. Delf's appointment was part of a deliberate attempt by the college to upgrade its offerings in at least one scientific subject, botany. When she arrived she found no money for equipment or assistance in the college's attic laboratory, and a botanical collection consisting of 'eight or ten bottles with bits of plants, mostly in very poor condition' (Sondheimer, 62). She also encountered a strong evangelical religious tradition, exemplified by the college's principal, Constance Maynard. Delf challenged Maynard on the religious question, refusing to attend the principal's divinity lectures, and insisting on teaching her students about the theory of evolution. In spite of these obstacles, Delf was able to raise money to purchase equipment and obtain specimens. In 1910 the University of London approved the Westfield laboratory to prepare students for the final BSc pass examination in botany and granted Delf the status of a recognized teacher of the university. The college was recognized to prepare students for honours degrees in botany in 1915. 
During this period Marion Delf also managed to continue her own research, begun so promisingly at Cambridge. Between 1911 and 1916 she studied the transpiration of plants, the process by which plants excrete water, particularly the morphology of 'Ulvaceae' or seaweeds, publishing her results in four papers in the 'Annals of Botany'. In 1912 she was awarded the London DSc degree for a thesis based on original research, as well as the Gamble prize from Girton for an essay entitled 'The biology of transpiration'. 
In 1914 Delf was granted a Yarrow fellowship from Girton to work on transpiration in evergreens. Her fellowship was interrupted, however, by war work. From December 1916 to January 1920 she was a research assistant at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine in London. As a member of a team led by Dr Harriet Chick she investigated the vitamin content of foods as pertaining to the rations of the military. In 1920 she went to South Africa as a temporary research fellow attached to the Institute of Medical Research, Johannesburg, where she continued this line of research, investigating the vitamin C content in the diets of local mine workers, 'as a result of which their health was substantially improved' ('Girton College Newsletter', 32). She was offered a chance to remain permanently in South Africa, but rather reluctantly chose to return to Westfield, when she learned that a new laboratory had just been built for her. 
Marion Delf was to remain at Westfield for the rest of her career. She was appointed a university reader in 1921, and became head of the Westfield botany department in 1939. In 1928 she married Percy John Smith, an etcher and book illustrator, from which time she was generally known as Delf-Smith. She moved with him to Haverstock Hill in Hampstead, remaining at Westfield as a non-resident lecturer. Percy Smith died in 1948, the year of his wife's retirement. 
Delf-Smith was a life member of the British Association, a fellow of the Linnean Society, a member of the South East London Botany Society, the South East Union of Scientific Societies, and the Association of Women Science Teachers, and served on the advisory algae committee of the Scottish Seaweed Organization. Her interests were, however, by no means narrow. She shared with her husband a love of drawing and gardening, serving as the Westfield garden steward after her retirement. She became devoted to the college, serving on its council and as head of the alumnae association. In 1955 she was elected an honorary fellow, a distinction rarely given. Believing that the job of a teacher was to 'at least awaken the desire amongst students to follow some line of investigation for themselves' (Sondheimer, 62), Delf-Smith taught many students who went on to have scientific careers, including her Westfield colleagues Violet Grubb and Alison Westbrook. She died in the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, on 23 February 1980.

Mann, Julia de Lacy (1891-1985), economic historian and college head, was born on 22 August 1891 in London, the daughter of James Saumarez Mann ('b'. 1851), editor and former fellow and tutor of Trinity College, Oxford, and his wife, Amy Gertrude, 'nee' Bowman. She grew up in Bromley, in a home characterized by 'liberal politics and a strong evangelical atmosphere' (Major, 1), and received a strong grounding in classics at Bromley high school which prepared her to read 'literae humaniores' at Somerville College, Oxford (1910-14). Little is known of her childhood or years at Oxford, where a contemporary described her as a tall and imposing young woman, who 'was a fine Hercules' in the first-year play (ibid., 2). Apparently, she developed an interest in social work through her mother, leading her to spend the year 1914-15 living in the Women's University Settlement in Southwark, while reading for the social science certificate at the London School of Economics. At the LSE, however, Mann discovered the emerging field of economic history: 'At the beginning of the First World War, I thought I would do social work, and so I went to the L.S.E. and did the Diploma in Social Science, and that's where I met economic history for the first time, and I thought this is the stuff for me... I didn't want to teach and teaching and social work were about the only professions you could have in those days if you were a woman. (Berg, 314)' Mann's pursuit of economic history was delayed by the First World War. From 1915 to 1916 she served as a clerk in the Admiralty, and from 1916 to 1919 in the Foreign Office, attending the Paris peace conference as one of the staff. 
In 1919 Mann returned to Somerville College, Oxford to do the diploma in economics. Through one of her tutors, J. A. Todd, who was secretary of the empire cotton-growing committee of the Board of Trade during the war, Mann became interested in the cotton industry. After serving for a short time as Todd's secretary, in 1922 Mann returned to the LSE to work for a PhD on the development of the cotton industry prior to the industrial revolution, supervised by Lilian Knowles. The following year Mann left the LSE upon her appointment as vice-principal and tutor in economics at what was then known as St Hilda's Hall, Oxford. 
At that time, St Hilda's was the smallest of the Oxford women's colleges: Mann was one of five resident tutors in 1924. Probably because of her habitual shyness, 'as a tutor, Mann was not a great success and old students remember long silences during tutorials' (Rayner, 62). In fact, Mann kept in contact with many of her students long after they left St Hilda's. She proved herself, however, an able administrator when she found herself virtually running the college during the illness of the principal, Winifred Moberly. Julia Mann was elected principal of St Hilda's after Moberly's death in 1928. 
Mann served as principal of St Hilda's during the difficult years of the depression, the Second World War, and the post-war period. At her retirement in 1955 she left the college in a strengthened position -- free of debt and ready to embark on a major period of expansion in which it would be accepted as a full college of the university. As principal of St Hilda's, Mann needed to balance the college's lack of endowment with the need to expand numbers and to provide more scholarships and research funding. Although the college was limited to 150 members by the university in 1927 (raised to 180 after the Second World War), in practice it could not even expand to this level because of the cost of building additional accommodation for students. Even though Mann disliked appealing for money, she carried through the raising of funds for the building of a new library wing in 1935. Under Mann's leadership after the war, the college launched a major fund-raising and building campaign, the first fruit of which, the Sacher Wing, was opened in 1954. During the early 1950s the college also prepared for self-government, leading to the granting of a new charter in 1955. 
Possessing little ambition for herself, Julia de Lacy Mann was dedicated to St Hilda's College. During her tenure as principal she performed many routine administrative functions single-handedly, while never accepting her full salary and living in two rooms in the college. After the death of her uncle, a former warden of Merton College, she became a benefactor of St Hilda's. Although Mann's responsibilities at St Hilda's gave her little time to participate in the university, as senior principal of the women's colleges she was a well-respected figure in Oxford, serving on the council of Barnett House, which provided training in the social sciences, and on the appointments board. 
Julia Mann's contributions to women's education were matched by her contributions to economic history. During her early years at St Hilda's she continued her research on the cotton industry, publishing 'The Cotton Trade and Industrial Lancashire, 1600-1780' with A. P. Wadsworth in 1931. 'Tentative and pathbreaking in the 1930s, it is a book that has remained authoritative and fertile' (Harte and Ponting, xi). During this period, Mann was also active in the Economic History Society, which had been founded in 1926, serving on its council and as assistant editor of its journal, 'Economic History Review', under joint editors R. H. Tawney and Ephraim Lipson, with whom she had studied at Oxford. As principal of St Hilda's, however, Mann limited her research in the subject to publishing bibliographies in 'Economic History Review', supervising post-graduate students, and reviewing books. 
Julia Mann's career entered a new phase after her retirement in 1955, when she moved to the town of Melksham in Wiltshire. Mann began to undertake research on the textile history of the region, publishing chapters in the Victoria county history of Wiltshire (1959) and 'Studies in the Industrial Revolution Presented to T. S. Ashton' (1960) and editing 'Documents Illustrative of the Wiltshire Textile Trades in the Eighteenth Century' (1964). She also published a chapter in 'A History of Technology' (1958) and articles in 'Economic History Review' and the new journal 'Textile History', founded in 1968. Her research culminated in the publication of 'The Cloth Industry in the West of England from 1640 to 1880' (1971). Like her earlier study of the cotton trade, this work was noted for its exhaustive research, attention to detail, and clear prose. Mann uncovered many new sources, gaining access to the records of textile firms held in private hands. During her retirement, Mann also gave support and encouragement to a new generation of economic historians, shown by the publication of the festschrift 'Textile History and Economic History: Essays in Honour of Miss Julia de Lacy Mann', edited by N. B. Harte and K. G. Ponting (1973). 
Mann was active in her Wiltshire community, serving on the county education committee and the county records committee, and acting as president of the West Wiltshire Historical Society and chair of the Melksham Local History Group. She frequently attended concerts in Bath and enjoyed reading, particularly nineteenth-century memoirs. In the last years of her life she developed a new interest, transcribing the letters of her father's Guernsey ancestors. At her home at Melksham, which she shared at first with three other women, one of whom was her Somerville contemporary Frances Griffiths, she welcomed many friends. Although she did not have close relatives of her own, she took a particular interest in the daughters and grandchildren of a friend. In her last months she was cared for by her devoted housekeeper. Julia de Lacy Mann died at The Cottage, 462 Bowerhill, Melksham, on 23 May 1985 at the age of ninety-three.

Tull, Walter Daniel John (1888-1918), footballer and army officer, was born on 28 April 1888 at 57 Walton Road, Folkestone, Kent, the fifth child of Daniel Tull ('c'.1856-1897) and his wife, Alice Elizabeth Palmer ('c'.1853-1895). Daniel, a carpenter, was born in Barbados and in 1876 settled in Folkestone. Through attendance at the Grace Hill Wesleyan Methodist Chapel he met Alice, born in Hougham, Kent. She gave birth to six children. In 1896, a year after the death of Alice from cancer, Daniel married her cousin Clara Alice Susannah Palmer. They produced a daughter Miriam, born on 11 September 1897. Three months later Daniel died from heart disease. Unable to cope with five stepchildren and an infant child of her own, Clara placed the youngest boys -- Edward, eleven, and Walter, nine -- in the children's home and orphanage in Bonner Road, Bethnal Green, on 24 February 1898. Edward was adopted in 1900 by the Warnock family of Glasgow, where he qualified as a dentist in 1912 and practised, probably as the first black dentist in Britain, at 419 St Vincent Street (as Edward James Alexander Tull-Warnock) until his death in 1950. 
Walter Tull served an apprenticeship as a printer but made his name as a footballer. In 1908-9, his first season in senior competitive football, he was described as the 'catch of the season' for his team ('Football Star'). Clapton won the amateur cup, the London county amateur cup, and London senior cup. Tottenham Hotspur, impressed by his coolness, skilled technique, and robust tackling invited him on their summer tour of Argentina and Uruguay. On return he was invited to sign professionally, and made his first team debut in Tottenham's inaugural game in the first division, away at Sunderland. His home debut was against FA cup holders Manchester United in front of a crowd of 32,000: '[Tull's] display on Saturday must have astounded everyone who saw it. Such perfect coolness, such judicious waiting for a fraction of a second in order to get a pass in not before a defender has worked to a false position, and such accuracy of strength in passing, I have not seen for a long time... Tull is very good indeed. ('Daily Chronicle', 13 Sept 1909)' He had 'much to contend against on account of his colour', commented one contemporary (but anonymous) journalist. During a match at Bristol in October 1909 the same reporter notes he received 'a cowardly attack on him in language lower than Billingsgate'. Yet, 'Tull is so clean in mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football... [He] was the best forward on the field' (undated press cutting, Finlayson collection). Mysteriously, by the end of the month, he had been dropped. 
At the end of the following season (1910-11) Tull was transferred to Herbert Chapman's Northampton Town, for whom he played over 110 matches, mostly as an inside forward. In December 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in the British army -- the first among his colleagues to do so -- and was appointed lance-corporal in the 17th (1st football) battalion, the Middlesex regiment. He was promoted to corporal then lance-sergeant before he had seen any action. In April 1916, after six months in France, he was hospitalized, suffering from shell shock. In September 1916 he returned to action with the 23rd (2nd football) battalion, which suffered heavy losses in the battle of the Somme. He then returned to Britain for officer training at Gailes in Ayrshire and on 10 May 1917 he was appointed to a commission in the special reserve of officers, before rejoining the 23rd battalion of the Middlesex regiment as a second lieutenant. 
Not only was it virtually impossible for a man of colour to be commissioned an officer, but the 'Manual of Military Law, 1914' stated that 'aliens [including blacks must]... not... exercise any actual command or power' (p. 471). He came to hate the conflict but was decorated with the 1914-15 star and British war and victory medals. Yet Tull led his men and was mentioned in dispatches for his 'gallantry and coolness' at the battle of Piave in Italy in January 1918. He died, unmarried, on 25 March 1918, shot through the head in no man's land near Favreuil, France, during the second battle of the Somme. Subsequently the commanding officer of the 23rd battalion recommended him for a Military Cross. Tull, through his actions, ridiculed those barriers that tried to deny people of colour equality with their contemporaries, revealing the shallow substance of these obstacles by the strength of his integrity. A garden of remembrance for all those connected with Northampton Town Football Club who died in the two world wars, with a sculpture to commemorate Tull forming its centrepiece, was dedicated on 11 July 1999.

Chamberlain, Brenda Irene (1912-1971), painter and writer, was born on 17 March 1912 at 4 Euston Road, Bangor, Caernarvonshire, the elder child of Francis Thomas Chamberlain, originally from Hill Ridware, Staffordshire, and then employed as an inspector of bridges for the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway, and his wife, Elsie, 'nee' Cooil (died 1972), who as a Labour councillor served as mayor of Bangor. Brenda Chamberlain was educated privately and at Bangor County School for Girls, where she showed such artistic ability that she was sent for lessons at the Royal Cambrian Academy in Conwy. On leaving school, she spent six months in Copenhagen, discovering the early work of Gauguin and exploring that fiercely independent style of living which she was to follow for the rest of her life. In 1931 she won a place at the Royal Academy Schools in London, where she met and, on 11 May 1935, married, the artist-craftsman John Petts (1914-1991); they shared a studio flat in Redcliffe Road, South Kensington. 
The following year, drawn by their love of mountains, Chamberlain and her husband returned to Wales, making their home at Ty'r Mynydd, a pair of cottages high above the village of Rachub, near Llanllechid, in northern Caernarvonshire. Determined to live by their art, albeit frugally, they bought an Adana printing machine and founded the Caseg Press, originally producing hand-coloured greetings cards from their own woodcuts and engravings. Their first joint exhibition was held in Bangor in 1937. The coming of war in September 1939 and the growing rivalry between them as artists strained their marriage, particularly after John Petts became a conscientious objector and left to join a field ambulance unit in Europe and the Middle East; his wife remained in Snowdonia, working as a mountain guide for the Red Cross. Between November 1941 and June 1942, at the suggestion of the poet Alun Lewis, they printed (though not on the primitive Caseg Press) a series of six broadsheets in editions of 500 copies featuring poems by Dylan Thomas, Alun Lewis, Lynette Roberts, and Brenda Chamberlain; the story of this venture is told in her book 'Alun Lewis and the Making of the Caseg Broadsheets' (1969). She and Petts separated in 1943 and were divorced three years later. 
In 1946 Brenda Chamberlain paid a six-week visit to Germany, where she stayed with Karl von Laer, a German whom she had known in Bangor before the war. On her return to Wales she settled on Bardsey, a sparsely populated island a few miles off the extreme tip of the Llyn peninsula in north-west Wales; her companion there was a Frenchman, Jean van der Bijl. She resumed painting and writing, determined to achieve recognition as an artist in her own right, painting canvases such as 'Children on the Seashore', 'The Cristin Children', and 'Man with a John Dory'. Exhibitions of her work were held at the Gimpel Fils and Zwemmers galleries in London and she won the gold medal for fine art at the national eisteddfodau of 1951 and 1953. Her first collection of poems, 'The Green Heart' (1958), was dedicated to Karl von Laer, and was followed by 'Tide-Race' (1962), a journal of life on Bardsey. The latter book, although a sympathetic portrait of the island, touches on the social tensions of the small community of crofter-fishermen and gave offence to some; when the writer eventually severed her connection with the place it was at the request of the owner, Lord Newborough. 
In 1963 Brenda Chamberlain went to the island of Ydra in the Sardinia Gulf, where she was to live intermittently for the next five years; her time there was spent in the writing of a novel, 'The Water-Castle' (1964), which draws on her relationship with Karl von Laer, and 'A Rope of Vines' (1965), an account of her life on Ydra. The colonels' 'coup d'etat' of 1967 filled her with despair, and in November of that year she left Greece, although not before writing a play, 'The Protagonists', based on a visit to a detention centre for political prisoners. The play was performed in Bangor in October 1968, but her plans for taking it to London, together with an exhibition of the paintings she had done on Ydra, failed through lack of funds. Her last home was at 10 Menai View Terrace, Bangor. 
Brenda Chamberlain was physically tough and self-sufficient; she had a small, boyish frame, a long bony jaw, heavy forehead, aquiline nose, and a childlike rather than feminine sensibility. Towards her friends she was kind, generous, and extremely loyal, and her nature was innocent, fervent, deeply fatalistic, and vulnerable. But she was also, towards the end of her life, frustrated in her artistic ambitions, desperately lonely, short of money, and given to bouts of depression. In 1969, shortly after the publication of 'Poems with Drawings', she suffered a nervous breakdown and spent some time in hospital. In 1970 her last exhibition, 'Word + image', work done on Ydra in collaboration with the composer Halim al-Dabh, was organized by the Welsh Arts Council. On 9 July 1971 she told a neighbour that she had done 'a very foolish thing' in taking eighteen sleeping tablets and that this was 'a 'cri de coeur''. She was rushed to Caernarfon and Anglesey Hospital but lost consciousness and died on 11 July. The coroner's verdict was accidental death, and after a service at St Peter's Church she was buried in Glanadda cemetery, Ffordd Caernarfon, Bangor, where her tombstone is inscribed with the words: 'I was born to live; I was born to die.'

Davies, James (1902-1952), Welsh-language writer, was born on 16 June 1902 in Pant Afallen, Cardiganshire, the third son of Thomas Davies, smallholder and miner, and his first wife, Martha, 'nee' Davies. About a year later, the family moved the short distance to the smallholding of Y Llain, Llwynpiod, where a fourth child, Laetitia, was born. 
Situated on the edge of the Red Bog of Tregaron, the poor soil of Y Llain was insufficient to support the family, and Thomas Davies followed the established pattern of moving to work as a miner at Nantgarw, returning home at intervals to work on the smallholding. The death of Martha Davies split the family for the first time when James was seven, and he was sent to stay for a year with an aunt in Banbury until Mary Davies, their mother's sister, came to Y Llain to keep house for the family. That traumatic experience developed a precocious self-consciousness in the seven-year-old which fundamentally affected his later development. From Y Llain he travelled the short distance to the church school in Tregaron, and later to the county school, where he came under the influence of the charismatic history teacher S. M. Powell. In the county school he acquired the nickname Kitchener, because of a supposed resemblance between his father and the field marshal. The name stuck, and even appears on his death certificate, although he never assumed it legally; it is as Kitchener that he continues to be known, in preference to his baptismal name. 
Two years before Davies left the county school to go as a pupil teacher to Blaengwynfi, his father sold Y Llain and moved to Blaengarw, where he married the woman with whom he had been lodging. Davies later referred to this event as the second great sadness of his life, the third coming when he learned that Mary Davies, his 'aunt/mother', who had moved to Tonypandy when the family split up, was dying of cancer. After taking a general arts degree and training as a teacher in Aberystwyth between 1922 and 1925 Davies established himself as a teacher in the Rhondda valley, where he spent the rest of an active life. On 15 April 1940 he married Mair Irene Rees (1911-1990) of Ffos-y-Ffin, Cardiganshire, the daughter of Evan Rees, schoolmaster. They had three children: Megan, Mari, and Manon. 
In the Rhondda Davies was active as a political campaigner on behalf of Plaid Cymru, and threw his weight behind the movement to establish Welsh-medium education in an area where the language was under the severest pressure. He stood for election to the county council and for parliament (1945 and 1950), and was active within the party. He was a member of the Calvinist Methodist chapel, Bethania, in Tonypandy, and was an active lay preacher. He also wrote regularly for the periodical press, and broadcast on literary and cultural topics. 
In spite of all of this, however, it is for his poetical and dramatic work that Davies is now chiefly remembered. In 1934-5 he achieved notoriety as the author of a naturalistic play, 'Cwm Glo' ('Coal valley'), originally entitled 'Adar y to' ('Sparrows'), which investigated the relationship between social conditions, manners, and morals in the coal-mining valleys of the south with a frankness and honesty quite unparalleled in Welsh literature up to that time. Other less important poetic and dramatic works followed, but his next major achievement was the poetic drama 'Meini gwagedd' ('Stones of emptiness'), whose title echoes a phrase in 'Isaiah' 34: 11. The inspiration for his final and greatest work was his experience of the cancer which killed him. While in hospital recovering from an operation he dictated to his wife his introspective radio poem 'Swn y gwynt sy'n chwythu' ('The sound of the wind which blows'), again of biblical inspiration. In all of these works Davies brought a sharply critical consciousness to bear on his own formative experiences and on the myths central to Welsh culture. His work was simultaneously critical, revisionary, and constructive, and although he wrote comparatively little, he has a clear claim to being one of the most important Welsh writers in the twentieth century. 
Davies died of cancer at his home, Aeron, Brithweunydd Road, Trealaw, Glamorgan, on 25 August 1952, and was buried at Llethr Du, Trealaw. He was survived by his wife and three daughters. On 3 September 1977 a plaque in his memory was placed on the wall of Llwynpiod Calvinist Methodist Chapel. His widow published a volume of his works in 1980, but many of his papers were destroyed in a fire in her home in Llangwyryfon, Cardiganshire, in 1990, in which she also died.

Goodwin, Geraint Arthur (1903-1941), novelist and short-story writer, was born on 1 May 1903 at 43 Commercial Street, Llanllwchaearn, Montgomeryshire, the only child of the third marriage of Richard Goodwin (1843-1911), rate collector and assistant overseer for the parish, and his wife, Mary Jane Watkin ('nee' Lewis) (1862-1943), who, like him, had been previously married and widowed. The writer was eight when his father died and twelve when his mother was married for a third time to Frank Humphreys, whose family were provision merchants in the markets of several Welsh border towns. From two Goodwin stepbrothers the writer gained a connection with journalism; from Frank Humphreys and his mother a lifelong enthusiasm for the countryside, angling, and rough shooting. To a large extent these influences shaped his life. He was educated at a local elementary school and, from the age of thirteen, as a boarder at Tywyn county school, Merioneth. 
In 1920 Goodwin found employment with the 'Montgomeryshire Express' at Newtown, where his stepbrothers had begun their careers. In 1923 he went to London, initially to work for W. T. Cranfield's publicity and news agency, but within the year he joined Allied Newspapers. A portrait of him by the Welsh painter Evan Walters shows him as a young journalist, trench-coated, fair-haired, and handsome, with intensely watchful eyes. He was a successful reporter, principally with the 'Daily Sketch', but was determined to become a writer. His first book, 'Conversations with George Moore' (1929), was, he acknowledged, a clumsy extension of his journalism. In the same year he became seriously ill with pulmonary tuberculosis, which necessitated lengthy treatment in a sanatorium and several months of convalescence. He returned to the 'Daily Sketch' in the spring of 1931, but had become disillusioned with journalism and was more than ever ambitious to write. On 17 October 1932 he married fellow journalist Rhoda Margaret Storey (1902-1991), who supported his ambition. 
A promising autobiographical novel, 'Call Back Yesterday', appeared in 1935. The publisher, Cape, offered a contract for two further books. Thus encouraged, Goodwin quit Fleet Street and the family moved to Lower Farm, Dagnall, Hertfordshire. He set to work under the inspirational guidance of Edward Garnett (1868-1937), then a reader for Cape. So began a fruitful relationship which continued until Garnett's death in 1937. The first product was a novel, 'The Heyday in the Blood', published in 1936 to considerable critical acclaim. A collection of short stories, 'The White Farm and other Stories', followed in 1937, and a further novel, 'Watch for the Morning', in 1938. The writer's mother, reputedly a remarkably handsome and vigorous woman, is the archetype of several of Goodwin's formidable female characters. Similarly, certain of his male characters are endowed with facets of the writer's own appearance and personality. Evan in 'The Heyday in the Blood' and Wyn in 'Watch for the Morning' are also tubercular. Though noted for their sensuous descriptions of the countryside, larger than life characters, rumbustious crowd scenes, and episodes of broad humour, the novels are essentially elegiac. In April 1938 the Goodwins moved to Pen-y-cwm, a cottage in Upper Corris, Merioneth. There he wrote his last novel, 'Come Michaelmas' (1939), set, like 'Watch for the Morning', in a thinly disguised version of his birthplace, Newtown. It was welcomed by the 'Times Literary Supplement' reviewer (29 April 1939) as the work of a 'fresh and individual talent'. 
Goodwin's future as a novelist seemed assured, but his health deteriorated rapidly and in June he entered the sanatorium at Talgarth, Brecknockshire, where he remained for several months. He was still frail when he discharged himself to rejoin his family at their new home in the ancient market town of Montgomery. A bout of influenza precipitated a further decline in his health, and in the summer of 1941 he was again admitted to a sanatorium. The disease was too far advanced, however, and he returned to Montgomery, where he died on 18 October 1941, at his home, Bowling Green Cottage, Churchbank, aged thirty-eight. He was buried five days later at Montgomery parish church.

Jones, Lewis Richard (1897-1939), political activist and novelist, was born on 28 December 1897 at 4 Sunny Bank, Blaenclydach, a mining village in a side valley of the Rhondda, Glamorgan, the illegitimate child of Jane Jones (died 1940/41), a domestic servant, and was brought up by his grandmother. He lived all his life in Blaenclydach, which is the setting of both his novels, 'Cwmardy' (1937) and 'We Live' (1939). His attendance at the local primary school was punctuated by frequent absences during which he lived a street life in an attempt to supplement his family's meagre income. At the age of twelve he went to work underground at the Cambrian colliery and, seven years later, on 9 April 1917, married Elizabeth Mary Jones ('b'. 1898/9), the daughter of Daniel Jones, a timberman; they had two daughters, Megan and Avril. Within a year of his starting work the Cambrian Combine owned by Lord Rhondda, whom Jones pilloried in his novels as Lord Cwmardy, embroiled all the pits of mid-Rhondda in a strike which ended in defeat for the miners, and in 1910 he witnessed the Tonypandy riots, a civil disturbance by locked-out miners which is among the most famous events in the history of the south Wales coalfield. 
Elected chairman of the Cambrian lodge, a hotbed of the 'advanced', mainly syndicalist thinking of the South Wales Miners' Federation, in 1918, Jones began a career as a public speaker of legendary power. During his first year at the Marxist-orientated Central Labour College (1923-5) he joined the Communist Party and, on his return to the Rhondda, became one of its most eloquent and able representatives as well as an organizer of immense talent. By the general strike, which began in May 1926, his ambition to be a mining engineer had dwindled as he became more interested in political philosophy. On the miners' ignominious return to work in the following November, after they had held out for nearly seven months against Stanley Baldwin's government, Jones -- like many militants -- was removed from his job as check-weighman for refusing to work with blackleg labour. He then became an organizer for the National Unemployed Workers' Movement in an area where unemployment was endemic, widespread, and long-term. In this capacity he led contingents of hunger marchers from the Rhondda to Cardiff and from south Wales to London in 1932, 1934, and 1936. He also arranged demonstrations against the hated means test which culminated in the mass movement of 1935. In that year he attended, as a British delegate, the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International in Moscow but, always a maverick, sometimes in bad odour with his party, and appalled by the cult of leader, refused to stand or clap for the person or name of Stalin. 
In 1931 Lewis Jones had been elected a member of the Welsh committee of the Communist Party and, for the last three years of his life, was one of two communist members of Glamorgan county council. A fiery orator, who served a three-month prison sentence in 1926 for his allegedly seditious speeches and was fined for 'inciting disorder' during the 1930s, he commanded a strong personal following among miners and other workers in the heavy industries of south Wales. Ardent in his support for a popular front between communists and the Labour Party against the threat of fascism at home and abroad, he also played a prominent part in the campaign in Wales on behalf of the beleaguered Spanish republic. He died of a heart attack at 12 Clare Road, Cardiff, on 27 January 1939 after addressing some thirty street meetings in the week that Barcelona fell to the fascist forces of General Franco. His secular funeral procession, the coffin draped with a scarlet banner, seemed to some observers as it wound its way through the packed streets of Tonypandy to the Judges' Hall in Trealaw to symbolize the thwarted hopes of 'Red Rhondda' and the passing of one of its most militant sons. He was buried in Trealaw cemetery, Rhondda, Glamorgan. 
Like other left-wingers in south Wales during the inter-war years, Lewis Jones was influenced by the syndicalism of the pamphlet 'The Miners' Next Step' (1912), but the essential fact of his volatile but attractive personality, whether expressed in his stormy political career or in his writing, was the Marxism which he had embraced so wholeheartedly in his youth and to which his life was dedicated. He was remarkable not least because, during a brief, difficult, and busy life, he wrote -- besides articles and stories contributed to the 'Daily Worker' -- two novels about the mining communities of south Wales which, though unsatisfactory in strictly literary terms, gave an authentic account of the social deprivation and political militancy which were typical of his time and place. 
In a preface to 'Cwmardy' (1937) the author attributed the inspiration for the book to the miners' leader Arthur Horner, who 'suggested that the full meaning of life in the Welsh mining areas could be expressed for the general reader more truthfully and vividly if treated imaginatively, than by any amount of statistical and historical research'; there he also admitted that the novel had been written hastily 'during odd moments stolen from mass meetings, committees, demonstrations, marches and other activities'. The novel's focus is divided between scenes of vivid documentary in its description of strikes, pit explosions, and the workers' clashes with troops and policemen, on the one hand, and a sensitive exploration of the psychology of the principal character, Len Roberts, and his sweetheart, Mary, and their denial of sex, on the other. Len, the archetypal wounded hero, grows increasingly sceptical about the efficacy of political action and is drawn to introspection and a quest for aesthetic beauty. His political involvement is part of the price he has to pay for not pursuing the life of the imagination, a compromise reflecting one of the main tensions in the author's own life. This theme is further developed in the sequel 'We Live' (1939), which was finished after the author's death by Mavis Llewellyn, a communist with whom he shared his last years, and published posthumously. It brings an added subtlety to both books, which otherwise might be read as merely propagandist novels bristling with outrage against working-class conditions and advocating radical, even revolutionary, means of exposing and improving them.

Jones, William Ronald Rees (1915-1987), journalist and poetry editor, was born at Blaensawdde, near Llanddeusant, Carmarthenshire, on 26 December 1915, the only son of Morgan Jones, a tenant farmer, and his wife, Margaretta, 'nee' Evans. The name by which he was known in literary and journalistic circles was taken from a small river, the Ceidrych, which ran near his home; for a while in the 1960s he used this spelling. Educated at Llandovery grammar school, he found his first job in a local bank, but after an incident involving a shot-gun was dismissed, and shortly afterwards, at the age of twenty, left Wales for London to seek a career in journalism; he worked as a public relations consultant to various animal welfare charities. 
Rhys launched the magazine 'Wales' in 1937 as 'an independent pamphlet of creative work by the younger progressive Welsh writers', taking as his motto, 'Though we write in English, we are rooted in Wales.' The first series (1937-40) ceased publication during the war but the second, started three years later, ran for eighteen numbers and was edited from Rhys's home at Llan-y-bri and then from the famously cluttered office of the Druid Press in Lammas Street in Carmarthen. 
In October 1939 Rhys married, in a secret ceremony and against his parents' wishes, Evelyn Beatrice Roberts (1909-1995), known as Lynette, a poet whose Welsh parents had emigrated to Argentina from Australia; the best man was Dylan Thomas, who once referred to him as 'the best sort of crank'. They lived first at Penybont, a farm near Llangadog where his parents lived, and then rented a whitewashed cottage known as Ty Gwyn at Llan-y-bri on the Tywi estuary. The marriage was put under strain by Rhys's prolonged absences from home while serving with the 53rd London Welsh regiment and then the Royal Artillery, during which time his wife suffered a miscarriage; for refusing to serve overseas while she was unwell, he was held in Woolwich arsenal for a few weeks. After his own health broke down, he worked with the Ministry of Information but saw the war out as a correspondent in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. 
Rhys published only a small booklet of his own poems, 'The Van Pool' (1942), in which he wrote mainly about the farming community of his youth and separation from his wife during war service. He also edited three anthologies of verse: 'Poems from the Forces' (1941), 'More Poems from the Forces' (1943), and 'Modern Welsh Poetry' (1944), of which the last-named was the most influential. Among its thirty-seven contributors were Dylan Thomas, Alun Lewis, Glyn Jones, Idris Davies, Vernon Watkins, Emyr Humphreys, and R. S. Thomas. Quixotically, Rhys stood as the Independent Progressive candidate in the Carmarthen county elections of March 1946. His marriage ended in divorce in 1948; the couple had a son and a daughter. He resumed his career as a journalist, notably as a Welsh columnist with 'The People' from 1954 to 1960. In 1954 he was married again, this time to Eva Smith, with whom he had a son. From 1956 until 1960 he served as London editor of Tambimuttu's intermittent magazine 'Poetry London-New York'. The third and final series of 'Wales' (1958-60), published as a monthly from London, was less literary than the early numbers, though it continued to carry poems and stories by some of the best Welsh writers of the day such as Rhys Davies. 
Keidrych Rhys, an indefatigable impresario on behalf of Welsh writers, was a generous and gifted editor who was often short of money and could not always pay his printer's bills or his contributors. His was an ebullient personality which delighted in anecdote and controversy, and he was an inveterate purveyor of scandal, especially about members of the Welsh establishment, among whom his paranoia detected many a plot against him. A fluent Welsh speaker, he was a lifelong supporter of Plaid Cymru, for which he arranged publicity in London. In his later years, he dealt in antiquarian books. Rhys died at his home, 40 Heath Street, Hampstead, London, on 22 May 1987.

Vaughan, Hilda Campbell (1892-1985), novelist, was born in a house known as The Castle in Builth Wells, Brecknockshire, on 12 June 1892, the youngest daughter of Hugh Vaughan Vaughan (1852-1936) and his wife, Eva, 'nee' Campbell, of Dunoon, Argyll. Her father's surname had been assumed by royal licence in lieu of Thomas in 1885; the family traced its descent from the Vaughans of whom the poet Henry Vaughan, the Silurist, was the most illustrious member. Hilda Vaughan's father, a successful country solicitor, held various public appointments and offices in Radnorshire, becoming clerk of the peace and under sheriff and clerk of the county council and its education committee. It is with Radnorshire, where most of her novels are set, that Hilda Vaughan is generally associated. 
Educated privately, though sketchily, by a succession of governesses, she remained at home until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, during which she first came into contact with the harsher realities of life while serving in a Red Cross hospital and then, for three years, as organizing secretary of the Women's Land Army in Brecknockshire and Radnorshire. At the war's end she left home for London and, while taking a writing course at Bedford College, met the novelist Charles Langbridge Morgan (1894-1958), who had just been appointed junior drama critic on the staff of 'The Times'. They married on 6 June 1923, and took a flat in More's Garden, Chelsea, where they were to remain for nine years until their removal to a house in Campden Hill Square. Their shared ambition to become writers drew them together, as her husband's letters reveal, but her subsequent career was somewhat overshadowed by his reputation -- especially after publication of 'The Fountain' in 1932 -- as one of the foremost English novelists of his day. There were two children of the marriage: Roger Morgan, the former librarian of the House of Lords and previously of the House of Commons, and Shirley Morgan, who married the marquess of Anglesey. 
Hilda Vaughan's first novel, 'The Battle to the Weak' (1925), set near Builth Wells, is a didactic work which exploits her knowledge of the topography, speech, and atmosphere of Radnorshire, but also reflects her own struggle to achieve recognition in her own right. Her third novel, 'The Invader' (1928), is a comedy and perhaps the most authentically Welsh of all her works, and in 'Her Father's House' (1930) she again makes use of her native place. Her most successful novel, 'The Soldier and the Gentlewoman' (1932), set in Carmarthenshire and published by Victor Gollancz, was a new departure into ironic tragedy; it was dramatized by Laurier Lister and Dorothy Massingham, and produced at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, in 1933. Her subsequent novels, 'The Curtain Rises' (1935), 'Harvest Home' (1936), 'Pardon and Peace' (1945), 'Iron and Gold' (1948), and 'The Candle and the Light' (1954), are romantic in theme but realistic and unsentimental in their acute observation of human character, particularly in adversity; compassion is at their heart. The fourth of these was first published in the United States, to which Charles Morgan had sent his wife and children during the Second World War, under the title 'The Fair Woman' (1942). She also wrote two plays in collaboration with Laurier Lister: 'She Too was Young' (1938), performed at Wyndhams Theatre, London, concurrently with her husband's 'The Flashing Stream', and 'Forsaking All Other', which was never staged. Her most exquisite writing is found in the novella 'A Thing of Nought' (1934; revised edition 1948), a tale of star-crossed love told with great economy and again set in the hills of Radnorshire. 
In 1957 the Morgans visited the West Indies for the benefit of Charles's health, but the relief was only temporary and he died the following year, after which, her own health affected, Hilda Vaughan published no more novels. A statement about her religious faith, which bordered on the quasi-mystical, is to be found in her introduction to an edition of Thomas Traherne's 'Centuries of Meditations', published in 1960. Apart from the autobiographical essays 'A country childhood' and 'Far away: not long ago', which first appeared in 'Lovat Dickson's Magazine' in 1934 and 1935, this was the only occasion on which she wrote about herself. She was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1963. 
Hilda Vaughan died on 4 November 1985 at Hazlewell Nursing Home, 29/31 Hazlewell Road, Putney, and was buried at Diserth, Radnorshire.

Griffith, Llewelyn Wyn (1890-1977), writer and broadcaster, was born on 30 August 1890 at 10 Penrhyn View, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Colwyn Bay, Caernarvonshire, the eldest son of John Griffith (1863-1933), schoolmaster, and his wife, Dora (1861-1940), daughter of Owen Jones of Tal-y-sarn, Caernarvonshire. His childhood was spent in various places in rural north Wales; he received his secondary education at Blaenau Ffestiniog, Merioneth, where his father taught science at the county school, and at Dolgellau in the same county, where his father became headmaster of the grammar school. The family was Welsh-speaking and Welsh was Griffith's mother tongue, but his education was wholly through the medium of English, and it was in that language that most of his creative writing was done. 
Griffith left Wales in 1909 to join the civil service, making his career with the Inland Revenue, of which he was assistant secretary from 1945 until his retirement in 1952; he wrote a history of the civil service, published in 1954, its centenary year. It was as an attempt to recapture and record the Welsh nonconformist tradition as he had known it, and from which he drew sustenance during a long and distinguished career in England, that most of his writing, particularly 'Spring of Youth' (1935), was undertaken; he returned to this subject in his autobiographical essay in the book 'Y llwybrau gynt' (ed. Alun Oldfield-Davies, 1971). 
Griffith's impulse to write about his own life had its origins in his experiences as a captain with the 15th battalion (London Welsh) of the Royal Welch Fusiliers during the First World War, in which he won the Croix de Guerre. His book 'Up to Mametz' (1931) is a vivid but reliable account of the conflict which, although it lacks the urbane irreverence of 'Goodbye to All That', has been compared with Robert Graves's book; it is certainly, with David Jones's 'In Parenthesis', among the most authentic. Above all, it relates how the innocence of youth was destroyed during a battle in which thousands of Griffith's comrades, and his younger brother Watcyn, were killed. 
After the war, during which he had married Winifred Elizabeth Frimston (1887/8-1977) on 6 March 1915, Griffith lived in the village of Neston in Cheshire, commuting to Chester and Liverpool as an officer of the Inland Revenue, but in 1933 he moved to Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire, where the rest of his life was spent. His next two books were novels: 'The Wooden Spoon' (1937) and the more substantial 'The Way Lies West' (1945), in both of which he strove to recapture not only the essence of his own youth but that of his parents; neither is as accomplished as his earlier autobiographical works. 
Griffiths also wrote a little poetry, including the verse-play for radio 'Branwen', which was collected in the slim volume 'The Barren Tree' (1945). Most of his poems drew their inspiration from Welsh legend or from his experience of war; one of his sons was killed in action in 1942. He abandoned poetry shortly afterwards, turning instead to the writing of factual books about the land and people of Wales for the enlightenment of English readers, including his own children, who were brought up in England and were unable to speak Welsh. The most authoritative, and for long the only book on its subject in English, was 'The Welsh' (1950), which was first published as a Pelican paperback. This book presented a fastidiously balanced view of Wales, its history and culture, and also argued in favour of a measure of administrative devolution within the British state, although it had little to say about industrial south Wales and was dubious about whether Cardiff deserved to become the country's capital; for Griffith, Wales was where the Welsh language was spoken. The same desire to introduce English readers to literature written in Welsh animated his work as a translator. He translated 'Tea in the Heather' (1968) and 'The Living Sleep' (1976), both by the major prose writer Kate Roberts, and wrote a children's version of a tale from the 'Mabinogion', 'The Saga of Pryderi' (1961). 
Griffith also represented Wales as a prominent member of many public bodies. He was chairman of the council of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, perhaps the most establishmentarian of all the London Welsh societies; vice-chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain and chairman of its Welsh committee; chairman of the National Book League; vice-president of the London Centre of the PEN Club; and a member of the Welsh committee of the British Council. A frequent broadcaster in both Welsh and English, he was for twenty-one years a member of the Welsh team in the popular radio series 'Round Britain Quiz' and gave many radio talks about the complexities of PAYE (pay as you earn) income tax in the series 'Can I Help you?' His contribution to Welsh life brought him honours from several quarters: he was made a CBE in 1961 and received the honorary degree of DLitt from the University of Wales and the gold medal of the Cymmrodorion. He died on 27 September 1977 in Southbank Nursing Home, 1-2 Cavendish Road, Bowdon, Cheshire, and was buried in the graveyard of Nebo Chapel, Rhiw, Caernarvonshire.

Fuller, Nicholas (1543-1620), lawyer and politician, was the son of Nicholas Fuller, a London merchant of Neat's Hall in the Isle of Sheppey. He attended Christ's College, Cambridge, from December 1560, and graduated BA in 1563. Admitted that year to Gray's Inn, Fuller was elected pensioner on 23 November 1584, and reader on 26 May 1587. By 1584 he had married Sarah, daughter of Nicholas Backhouse, alderman and former sheriff of London, and in 1586 the couple set up home at Chamberhouse, near Thatcham, Berkshire. The eldest of their seven known children, also named Nicholas (died 1620), was born in 1592, admitted to Gray's Inn in 1601, and knighted by James I on 22 June 1619. 
In 1585 Fuller was offered the post of solicitor-general in Dublin, but managed to avoid the duty. On 8 February 1588 he became dean of the chapel of Gray's Inn, and in 1591 was elected to the prestigious role of treasurer. From 1588 he was often employed by the privy council in matters concerning state servants and national security. But he also began to incur official disapproval. In July 1590 the puritan minister John Udall was tried for writing a 'seditious' book, and Fuller acted for him. When Judge Clarke instructed the jury to find Udall guilty on the fact of his authorship and 'leave the felony to us', he intervened caustically, provoking a hostile response from the prosecutor and noisy scenes as Udall was removed from the chamber. 
In 1591 Fuller appeared for Thomas Cartwright and other ministers whose attendance at synods and classes was said to amount to sedition. The case was dramatically altered when, at Cheapside on 16 July 1591, Edmund Copinger and Henry Arthington proclaimed Elizabeth deposed, and William Hacket the new messiah and king of Europe. This was sedition indeed. Four days later Fuller was committed to the Fleet by the same warrant which ordered Hacket's arrest, perhaps because he had offered to represent the accused. The authorities failed to secure the conviction of Cartwright and his fellow ministers; this has been attributed to 'the highly professional resistance of the puritan lawyers', which 'perhaps owed much to Nicholas Fuller' (Collinson, 420-1). He remained close prisoner until 15 August. The flow of state commissions dried up, and Fuller's indiscreet libel against the lord admiral in 1596 must have confirmed his disfavour within an increasingly conservative establishment. 
In 1593 Fuller sat as MP for St Mawes. He was prominent in opposing government attempts to extend the scope of the 1581 recusancy laws to separatists, fearing that it might also be used against non-separatist puritans. On 4 April 1593 he denounced the second of two bills, sent from the Lords after the rejection of the first, as 'dangerous to good subjects': it made 'schisms to be equal with seditions and treasons, which is against the equity of the former law'. He moved in committee 'to the striking out of the title and the whole preamble. No man spake for it' (Hartley, 3.162, 167). After further hostile scrutiny the bill passed in heavily amended form. 
Fuller appears not to have sought re-election in 1597-8, but he sat in the first parliament of James I, as a member for the City of London. For the next ten years he was the government's sharpest and most tenacious critic. In 1606, for example, he urged action against recusants, and spoke for deprived ministers; and he presented economic grievances over purveyance, the farming of fines, patents, various impositions, and cloth production. 'Mr Fuller of Gray's Inn, a prime man in the council of London' (Willson, 33-4) was clearly important to city merchants. But commercial issues were rarely separable from politics. Fuller helped pursue the government agent Tipper, charged with obtaining money under false pretences while in service of the revenue. He complained against impositions on currants. This was cause in Bate's case, in which the exchequer found that the king was entitled to raise customs rates in peacetime. Fuller urged that duties imposed without parliamentary consent were illegal. He was prominent in opposition to 'purveyance', under which the crown might buy supplies at less than market prices. He objected that purveyors enriched themselves at the expense of suppliers and of the state, and imposed this abuse through their own 'court of green cloth'. Efforts to abolish purveyance ran into opposition, notably from those concerned to defend or extend the limits of the royal prerogative. 
Fuller was interested in other issues which bore on constitutional principles. When attending joint conferences between the two chambers, MPs were made to stand hatless, respectfully awaiting the pleasure of the Lords. In March 1607 he recommended on behalf of the committee of privileges that the Lords be asked to treat them more considerately. He appealed to a principle of equality between the two chambers: when in the past a few peers had visited the Commons to confer, 'it is not likely the whole commons did stand or were bare in reverence of so few sent down to them' (Willson, 233). On 12 April 1606 he reported that at a joint conference the judges had tried to present their views on the legality of a bill as unchallengeable by MPs. He had objected that the conference was not a court, and was rebuked for it, although subsequently cleared of fault by the House of Commons. 
Ministerial plans for union with Scotland aroused widespread suspicion in parliament. In February 1607 Fuller warned that impoverished Scottish artisans and feuding lairds might descend on the lush pastures of English commerce and law. The speech sought to connect both with the fears of artisans and merchants, and with resentment at Scottish courtiers, who, many felt, were showered with offices and honours. But Fuller spoke less crudely than many among the opponents of union. His main concern was with the legal issues raised by the proposals. These were not merely technical; they seemed to present political dangers. In Scotland the independence of parliament was not well entrenched; while two legal systems prevailed, the government disposed of extra discretionary powers which bypassed the statutes of either country, powers which appeared at odds with parliamentary 'liberties'. He feared the subordination of the English common law to courts operating outside the control of statute, and the extension of the royal prerogative. 
Fuller's constitutional ideas led him into serious conflict with these forces. In early 1607 he agreed to act for two men, Thomas Ladd of Yarmouth and Richard Mansell of Gloucester, imprisoned by the high commission for actions subversive of the established church and its courts. Having secured a writ of habeas corpus, Fuller undertook their defence in king's bench, at hearings on 6 May and 13 June. He argued that the court of high commission had no power to arrest or imprison. Its officers were corrupt, its procedures popish and illegal. Fuller took his arguments into parliament. In June 1607 he charged that the high commission 'at every renewing increaseth and encroacheth more power and more', in breach of the laws of the land, and presented a bill which if passed would have emasculated it (Willson, 351). Despite, or because of, his public assault on the ecclesiastical courts, he seems to have retained the confidence of most MPs. On 26 June 1607, the Commons desired to elect him chairman of the committee of the whole house; Fuller modestly stood aside in favour of Hobart, the attorney-general. While the house sat, he could claim privilege against arrest. But his actions threatened the very existence of the high commission, and soon after the prorogation on 4 July, it arraigned and imprisoned him in the White Lion at Southwark. 
Fuller immediately appealed to the common law judges. Fenner and Croke upheld the right of king's bench to determine whether the high commission held jurisdiction in his case. King's bench was in recess, but would hear the case when it reconvened; in the meantime, they issued a prohibition, halting the commission's legal pursuit of Fuller. In September 1607 a conference was held between the barons of the exchequer and the judges of the king's bench and common pleas. It issued a 'consultation' which enabled the high commission to proceed against Fuller on lesser charges of heresy and schism. On 20 or 21 October he was convicted, fined $200, and gaoled, but quickly secured from king's bench a new writ of habeas corpus, which challenged the authority by which he was detained. 
Fuller was in effect arguing that the commissioners had no power to imprison him even in relation to cases lying within its jurisdiction. It had no coercive power at all. The full implications of his case now lay exposed. The king could only delegate powers whose limits had been defined by statute: the powers set out in letters patent, under which the commission operated, were illegal. This called into question not only the existence of the high commission but the royal prerogative itself. Ministers became alarmed. On 24 November 1607 the judges of king's bench accepted the attorney-general's view that, having conceded jurisdiction in the determination of guilt, they had no right to pronounce on sentence. Fuller was sent back to prison. Two days later he secured a second hearing, on the grounds that he had lacked counsel at the first, and the arguments were re-rehearsed. 
James I had become convinced that the common lawyers were out to extend their jurisdiction at the expense of ecclesiastical authorities appointed by him. He visited Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, and pressed him to pursue the case, urging Cecil that 'the ecclesiastical commission may not be suffered to sink besides the evil deserts of that villain [Fuller]' ('Salisbury MSS', 19.285-6), lest the monarchy itself be harmed. James kept the case under continuous review, repeatedly urging expedition upon his ministers. When, on 24 November, the judges found against Fuller again, he thanked them, congratulating Cecil upon his discreet handling of the matter. 
In the Fleet Fuller faced conflicting pressures. A prosperous lawyer and parliamentarian, he had forced the authorities to the view that the defence of both the high commission and the prerogative depended on his committal. Now, however, he vacillated, signing a submission and then withdrawing it at the behest of his wife and friends. On 5 January 1608, after signing a second submission, he was released. Earlier, however, he had passed a draft account of his argument against the commission to radical associates, who in December published it as 'The Argument of N.F.'. These were not new friends. From 1604 Fuller seems to have advised clerical opponents of the bishops on how they might use the common law courts to resist deprivation. A group of these, including Mansell, circulated a series of illegal pamphlets, printed on a secret press. But in January 1608 copies of 'The Argument of N.F.' were seized and on 27 February, at Star Chamber, Mansell, Fuller, and three others faced charges of sedition. 
Citing both Foxe's martyrology and legal precedent, Fuller's 'Argument' held that many of the powers and procedures of ecclesiastical courts were not only technically illegal but affronted the rule of equity and common justice. He proceeded to a memorable summary: 'the laws of England are the high inheritance of the realm, by which both the King and the subjects are directed'. The law 'admeasureth the King's prerogative so as it doth not extend to hurt the inheritance of the subject'. No charter or commission was legal 'unless the same charters and commissions, do receive life and strength from some Act of Parliament'. And if 'any grant or commission from the King doth tend to charge the body, lands or goods of the subjects unlawfully, the Judges will redress the same' ('Argument', 3, 9, 11, 14-15). The last assertion reflected great faith in judicial independence, still largely untested in 1608, but it helped ensure that the judges would be so tested. Nicholas Fuller thus made his own theoretical contribution to the disintegration of the Tudor compromise on sovereignty, anticipating the pronouncements of Hakewill and Coke. It seems that 'The Argument' had come to light before Fuller's release; he was rearrested and by 26 January 1608 was 'close prisoner with the Dean of Pauls'. The outcome of the case in Star Chamber is unclear; on 10 April the court ruled that Fuller might practise law, but was to be confined to the precincts of Gray's Inn pending further action, of which nothing is known. 
Throughout his career Fuller remained active in his parish, and encouraged participation in its affairs by other leading laymen. The churchwardens were made to record their accounts more fully, and forbidden to lease parish property without permission. In 1608 a charge for communion bread was levied on all but the poorest. Fuller was a trustee of local charities; probably on his initiative a legal ruling was obtained in October 1610, ensuring that their resources were used for the relief of the poor. 
When Fuller returned to Westminster in 1610, the conflict with the authorities had in no way diminished his status. His basic ideas were unchanged. In principle, he continued to stand for the abolition of wardship, which would both remove a burden from many subjects and agree better with God's laws. But it was necessary to provide legal security for any agreement with the crown, and this was not easy: 'I would willingly give somewhat out of my estate, so as I might be assured to know what the rest were and enjoy it safely. But before those fears be cleared I cannot for my part have any comfort in the bargain' (E. R. Foster, 2.321). On 23 June 1610 Fuller set out his views on the prerogative with special sharpness, restating the view of his 'Argument' that both king and subjects were subject to law, and attacking unparliamentary taxation. His speech was greeted by 'a great silence' (ibid., 2.165). In November he attacked again his old enemy the high commission, urging that parliament should not trust verbal promises that agencies unaccountable to it would refrain from abusing their powers. Prelatical courts 'would turn their chair into a throne, an abuse contrary to the laws of this kingdom, and (I verily think), the law of God'. He reviewed the Commons' efforts to restore deprived ministers, end non-residency, enforce the sabbath, and reform wardship and purveyance: 'there were never wiser gentlemen in the House and never less done'. If these bills 'had passed for law by joint assent of the other house and his Majesty', England might now be the happiest of states (ibid., 407-10). This came close to blaming king and Lords for the deficiencies of nation and church. 
In March 1614 there was a contest over parliamentary seats in London. The city chose Sir Thomas Low as their first knight, but refused 'to admit Master Recorder [Montague], alledging only that he is the King's sergeant. Master Fuller is their first burgess.' The choice, it was rightly remarked, was 'as much subject to interpretation as the refusal of the other' ('Letters of John Chamberlain', 2.515-16). Fuller opposed reform proposals of April 1614, by which bills of 'grace and favour' were to be granted by the king in return for early supply. When, in May, Bishop Neile accused the house of sedition in questioning the right of the king to fix duties, Fuller responded that Neile 'hath great access to the King and that he is most unworthy of it' ('JHC', 499). With the Addled Parliament, Fuller's long career as a leading parliamentarian came to a close. 
Now in his seventies, Fuller still kept up a busy schedule; he remained active in parish affairs, and audited the churchwardens' and almshouse accounts. He continued to attend meetings of the Gray's Inn benchers until 19 November 1619. He died on 23 February 1620 at Chamberhouse and was buried at Thatcham church on 2 March. In his will Fuller left much property, mostly to his wife, Sarah, and son, Nicholas; there were bequests to the poor at Newbury and to the preachers Stephen Egerton and John Dod. 
Fuller left two monuments. His shield once appeared on the south window of the Old Hall at Gray's Inn; there is a representation of it in Dugdale's 'Origines juridiciales' (1671). At the Chamberhouse chapel he appears wearing a barrister's gown, with his wife, two sons, and five daughters. The inscription celebrates Fuller's piety, his fame, and his commitment to knowledge, truth, and justice.

Pickering, Lewis (bap. 1571), courtier and convicted seditious libeller, was baptized in February 1571, the son of John Pickering of Tichmarsh, Northamptonshire, and his second wife, Ursula. He matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1587, but apparently left without a degree before entering Gray's Inn in 1592. Emmanuel was a cradle of puritanism, and whatever religious sentiments Pickering acquired there were undoubtedly reinforced at his inn, a favoured haunt of Northamptonshire's godly. 
Upon Elizabeth I's death in 1603, and presumably with the backing of weightier figures in Northamptonshire or in other puritan circles, Pickering headed for Scotland, where, he later claimed, he was the first to give James 'intelligence that he was proclaymed & generallie accepted as Kinge of England' (Cecil MSS, 192, fol. 18). Trusted by James and welcomed into the royal entourage, Pickering tried to use his good fortune to aid the cause of further reformation in the English church. For the first two years of the new reign Pickering, along with the Scot Patrick Galloway, was a key point of contact at court for the revived puritan movement, acting as a conduit for strategic news, reformist schemes, and godly petitioning. Early in 1605, however, as puritan optimism began to fade in the face of James I's studiously moderate ecclesiastical policy, Pickering's brief court career came to a catastrophic end. In February, Thomas Bywater, a fellow puritan, named Pickering as the author of a bitter verse libel, 'The Lamentation of Dickie for the Death of Jockie', that had been pinned to the hearse of the late archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, in March 1604. Although he denied writing it, Pickering was prosecuted in Star Chamber in May 1605 for seditious libel. 
Pickering's conviction was as much a political as a legal necessity. By tarring a relatively prominent puritan with sedition, the authorities could powerfully demonstrate what they repeatedly asserted: that puritan resistance to royal ecclesiastical policy was politically subversive. To secure this highly useful conviction, Attorney-General Sir Edward Coke was forced, in part by Pickering's defence and in part by these political exigencies, to clarify and reformulate seditious libel law. Coke's reformulations made the Pickering case a major legal precedent, establishing that the dead could be libelled, that truth was no defence, and that attacks on royal ministers constituted seditious assaults on royal authority. Pickering was sentenced to a year in prison and a $1000 fine. He was to be pilloried in London, Croydon, and Northampton, and, if he refused to confess, to have his ears nailed to the pillory. Pickering was pilloried at least once, though it is not known whether he was mutilated, and he was imprisoned until late in the year, when he was released and his fine excused. Shortly afterwards, Pickering signed a paper recanting his puritan views: he acknowledged the legitimacy of the ceremonies mandated by the church and accepted the crown's right to deprive those clergy who refused to do likewise. 
At the time of his arrest, Pickering was engaged to marry a Mrs Russell, a widow in the countess of Bedford's service. Whether his marriage plans survived his disgrace is unknown, as is the date of his death.

Oates, Samuel (bap. 1614, d. 1683), General Baptist preacher and Leveller, was baptized at St Saviour's Church, Norwich, on 26 September 1614, the son of Titus Oates, a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Anne. He is not to be confused with a namesake, the son of another Norfolk clergyman, born at Marsham in 1610. Nothing is known of Oates's youth, and we have only his own claim, reported by John Drew, that during the early 1640s he received 'a direct and lawful call from a church in Norfolke to a pastorall charge there' (Drew, 11). In 1647 hostile witnesses described him variously as a weaver and a button maker. 
Oates was probably rebaptized by Thomas Lamb, the soapboiler, perhaps on the latter's visit to Norwich in early 1642. Oates's fame spread quickly: on 14 December 1643, at Westminster, John Lightfoot referred to him as a 'notorious anabaptist about Norwich' ('Whole Works', 13.81). Oates continued there for some months, but visited London in early 1645, preaching at Lamb's church in Bell Alley. He seems to have joined that congregation soon after, and in September set off with Lamb on a missionary tour, giving sermons at Guildford and Portsmouth. This apprenticeship served, he struck out on his own in a career of itinerant evangelism which caused acute anxiety to the authorities in several counties. 
In Essex, the following spring, it was noted that Oates 'hath been sowing his Tares, Bookmong, and wild Oates in these parts these five weeks without any controll, hath seduced hundreds, and dipped many in Bocking River'; he was 'a lusty young fellow' who 'traded chiefly with young women and young maids, dipping many of them, though all is fish that comes to his net, and this he did with all boldnesse, and without all controul for a matter of two months' (Edwards, 2.147-8). This lurid picture probably owed much to the imaginations of the presbyterian ministers who painted it. But at the Essex quarter sessions at Chelmsford, in March 1646, Oates was certainly charged with unlawful assembly at Braintree and Bocking, in breach of the peace and in contempt of authority. Imprisoned for a time in Colchester gaol, he was reported to have been visited by large numbers of friends from London, some in coaches. In April he was acquitted of having caused the death of a young woman by immersing her in a river. At Terling he debated with John Stalham, who also recalled a sermon by Oates 'at the corner of a corn field in our town' (Stalham, preface). On 29 June he disputed for several hours with Ralph Josselin, vicar of Earls Colne, and the following morning commenced three days of exercises at Chelmsford. Essex magistrates seem not to have succeeded in stopping his activities, but the following year Oates turned his attention elsewhere. 
In March 1647 Oates appeared in Rutland, where the parish ministers urged the authorities to act against him. But here, as in Essex, it was impossible to mobilize the machinery of the law when the political and military will to punitive action was wanting. Oates continued to win a following, partly on the basis of agitation around the issue of tithes; lay preachers thought it proper to 'live of the gospel', and he seems to have achieved success in this by passing his own hat among the audiences. By early December 1647 nineteen parish ministers of Rutland were complaining to parliament that he continued touring 'from town to town preaching and rebaptising very many and drawing a concourse of people after him'. To Oates, they attributed much doctrinal deviancy, including the belief that Christ had died for all men and that the soul died with the body. And his meetings became more openly political: it was reported that the preacher had 'lately been a great dispenser and promoter' of 'that seditious paper Called the 'Agreement of the People', bringing or sending it to diverse places through the country, which he hath by himself or his agents brought or sent to several towns in the countie' (Betteridge, 207-9). One of these agents was probably Robert Everard, an agent of Cromwell's regiment, who had published the agreement in November and was soon after active among the Baptists of nearby Leicestershire. 
This turbulence evidently provoked the central authorities to act: on 11 December the House of Lords ordered that Oates be arrested and brought before them, but on the 31st they found it necessary to issue a second order, admitting that he had escaped, and instructing the sheriffs of Lincolnshire, Rutland, Leicestershire, and Northamptonshire to return him to London, should they succeed in apprehending him. Neither this, nor a further order of 22 January 1648, had much practical consequence. Rearrested in Rutland, Oates was bound to appear before the judges of assize; he did not attend, but was acquitted anyway on a technicality. In May 1648 the Lords received further news. Oates remained active in Rutland, unrepentant and highly politicized, having uttered 'most sedicious and treasonable speeches against monarchy itself': in another outraged petition the county ministers pleaded for 'the dissolving of the schismatical and mutinous meetings of his deluded followers' (Betteridge, 210-11). But Oates continued on his way. At Barrow-on-Soar, Leicestershire, he had a hostile encounter with George Fox; it was probably about this time that an excursion to Lincolnshire provoked the pamphlet against him by John Drew, rector of Barrowby. And at Oakham, Rutland, some time during the first half of 1649, Oates's wife, Lucy (died in or after 1697), a midwife from Hastings, gave birth to a baby boy, to whom they gave the name Titus ['see 'Oates, Titus (1649-1705)]. 
On 30 October 1649 Oates disputed in public with William Sheffield, rector of Ibstock, at Leicester Castle. Here the proponent of anti-paedobaptism was said to have been reduced to silence, but this victory (if such it was) was not enough for the magistrates. For his speeches Oates was the following day incarcerated in the castle's dungeon, together with his associate, Ralph London. Soon, however, he was freed, and by February 1650 was commissioned chaplain to Colonel Pride's regiment, possibly through the influence of another General Baptist, John Mason, who had been made lieutenant-colonel about August 1648; this was one of the regiments which invaded Scotland in July 1650 and pursued the Scottish forces to Worcester the following year. 
Like other political radicals, Oates opposed the trend in General Baptist churches towards the receiving of members with the laying on of hands (though he was later accused of inconsistency), and some time in 1653, being in the county, he intervened at the request of a Lincolnshire church who opposed their pastor's adoption of it. About May 1653 Oates was in London, disputing with John Spittlehouse, an open-membership Calvinistic Baptist who also espoused this practice. Perhaps a little later, Cromwell received a letter concerning the dissolution of the Rump and the new assembly on behalf of the congregation at the Stone Chapel, St Paul's, led by Edmund Chillenden. This was signed by Oates and other men, chiefly military figures. 
Oates was again chaplain of Pride's regiment when it returned to Scotland in April 1654; his service may have been continuous from 1650. On 2 December he wrote from Aberdeen to Corporal Parkinson of Whalley's regiment 'in great heaviness to think how we made the hearts of the righteous sade... by our not answering there expectations; for we have promised to make them a free people, and that they should have free and sucksessive parlements, but parforme neither' and enclosed a summary of a letter already sent to sympathizers in several regiments, urging them to meet at the Green Dragon in Edinburgh on 1 January (Nickolls, 132). Papers found on Oates indicate his deep disquiet with the powers vested in Cromwell as lord protector. Perhaps, he wondered, the new regime might be better than it appeared; he struggled to suppress his fears, in the hope that some authoritative representative of the new order would allay his anxieties. These musings did not amount to any well-worked plan, but on 16 January 1655, as Monck reported, Oates was arrested. He was expecting trouble, complaining bitterly against the 'cry that is unjustly on me'. There was 'not word of sedition' in the letter circularized to soldiers: 'we intended nothing but was consonant to the ground and end of our warres, and the honest declarations we have made, and concluded in fine to offer our service in this matter in an humble petition to the Protector' (MS Rawl. A.34, fols. 49-50). 
The context, however, was one in which several high army officers in Scotland were planning a coup involving the enforced installation of Robert Overton as commander. Overton seems not to have been a party to the conspiracy, and it is also possible that Oates was merely an auxiliary, to whom the military plans were not confided. Still, he was courtmartialled, cashiered, imprisoned, and shortly afterwards taken to London. Here he was granted a reprieve, and perhaps the satisfaction he had sought, for on 31 March, Monck reported that 'yesternight Oates was with his highness, who gave him only a sharp reproof for his folly, upon promise of his faithful deportment for the future' (Firth, 'Clarke Papers', 3.31). 
Very little is known about Oates after the Restoration. The government suspected him of involvement in the Yorkshire plot in 1663, but this is unlikely. On 29 June 1667, following a brief stay at Merchant Taylors' School, Titus Oates was admitted to Caius College, Cambridge; the following year his father abandoned the Baptists and was instituted to the rectory of Hastings. In 1673 he resigned and returned to London, rejoining his old denomination. In 1682 he visited Henry Danvers and may have been on the fringes of groups that were plotting against the government. He died on 6 February 1683, leaving his widow and sons Titus, Samuel, and Constant.

Eckenstein, Oscar Johannes Ludwig (1859-1921), mountaineer, was born at 29 Douglas Road, Islington, London, on 9 September 1859, the youngest of six children of Frederick Gottlieb Eckenstein (1820/21-1891), a general merchant who had fled Germany in the wake of the 1848 revolutions, and his wife, Julie Amalie Antonia Helmke (1830/31-1921). His sister was the feminist polymath and cultural historian Lina Dorina Johanna Eckenstein (1857-1931). He was educated at University College School, London, and studied mathematics and chemistry at the universities of London and Bonn. He enjoyed a professional career as a railway engineer (with the International Railway Congress Association) and, later, as an analytical chemist. He espoused radical political and social views, was intolerant of what he regarded as English snobbery and xenophobia, and enjoyed gymnastics, rowing, skiing, poetry, puzzles, and playing the bagpipes. 
Eckenstein started climbing when just thirteen, although little is known of his early exploits. Serious ascents in the Alps began in 1886 and went on until at least 1912. Together he and his occasional climbing companion August Lorria published a lavish volume of photographs of the Pennine Alps -- 'The Alpine Portfolio' (1889). He regularly returned to Switzerland, and although a deep aversion to publicity meant that few of his routes were recorded in detail his distinctive approach is captured by an account of him shunning Alpine huts in favour of his own tent with a cork mattress and rubber underlay, using a handy crevasse as a refrigerator. He often climbed without the assistance of professional guides. 
Eckenstein's domestic rock-climbing began on Lliwedd in 1887 and he returned regularly to Snowdonia, making a distinctive contribution to its climbing culture. He was a member of the first recorded mixed-sex climb (with Sophie Bryant, Sophie Nicholls, and Ashley Perry Abraham) in 1897. He regularly teamed up with J. M. Archer Thomson, and occasionally with other pioneers including Humphrey Owen Jones and Harold Hughes, and was a founder member of the Climbers' Club (1898). He pioneered 'shack' life at the Pen y Pass hotel at the foot of Snowdon, living during his visits at Christmas and Easter in an iron shed left behind by one of the copper mining enterprises. He practised his technique of holds and balance on the large 'Eckenstein' boulder, and cultivated his muscular strength. Although he led new climbs only rarely, his climbing ethic refashioned the approach to domestic rock. It was later written that 'provided he could get three fingers on something that could be described by a man far advanced in hashish as a ledge, [Eckenstein] would be smoking his pipe on that ledge a few seconds later, and none of us could tell how he had done it' (Crowley, 19). 
In 1891 (William) Martin Conway asked Eckenstein to accompany him on his expedition the following year to the Karakoram. Two more contrasting characters in ideology, temperament, and approach to mountaineering could hardly have been imagined, and their relationship was not a happy one. Any initial plans to attempt the world's second highest mountain K2 (8611m) faltered, and Eckenstein, suffering from ill health, left the party to return home. He provided a prosaic if enthusiastic travelogue of his experiences in 'The Karakorams and Kashmir' (1896), the most striking episode being his account of the meal he and Charles Glanville Bruce enjoyed on coming down from the mountains after two months of living on flour and mutton. In twenty-four hours they ate three chickens, a dozen chops, and over fifty eggs, washed down with gallons of milk. 
In 1898, while at Wasdale Head in the Lake District, Eckenstein met Aleister Crowley. They became firm and loyal friends, notwithstanding Eckenstein's lack of interest in the occult. They journeyed to Mexico, where they climbed Popacatapetl (5452m) in 1901, the expedition exhausting its supplies so that for the last three days they subsisted on champagne and butter. The following year Eckenstein and Crowley attempted the ascent of K2. The multinational expedition ran into a series of difficulties: Eckenstein was temporarily refused permission to enter Kashmir (possibly owing to fears that he was a German spy); team members suffered from illnesses including altitude sickness and malaria; and there were quarrels concerning food, pack weights, and the route to be taken on the mountain. After reaching a respectable 6532m on the north-east ridge the expedition turned back, its achievements subsequently overshadowed by sensationalist accounts and by the notoriety which surrounded Crowley. 
Eckenstein was both a pioneer in the development of the athletic potential of the human body on rock, and an innovator in the technology of mountaineering. He designed a new design of ten-point crampons and a much shorter and more wieldy ice axe which could be used one-handed, conducted experiments into the relative strength of knots, and championed the use of tricouni nails in climbing boots. Many of these innovations, which later became commonplace among the mountaineer's tools of trade, were regarded with great suspicion by the establishment circles of the Alpine Club, which he scorned. 
During the First World War, Eckenstein served as a special constable, replacing active mountaineering with a bibliophile's fascination with the explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton. By this time Eckenstein's health was poor as tuberculosis took a grip. As he was a bachelor of long standing his marriage on 31 January 1918 to Margery Cattley Edwards (1890-1976), thirty-one years his junior, came as a shock to his friends, Crowley writing of 'the unhappy termination of his life in phthisis and marriage' (Crowley, 155). She was the daughter of William Edwards, vicar of Bognor. The Eckensteins moved to The Cave, Oving, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, where Oscar died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 8 April 1921. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. 
This short, sturdy, asthmatic, bearded, sandal-wearing, shabbily dressed bohemian, whose choice of pipe tobacco was found particularly noxious by his companions, in retrospect appears to belong to the alternative culture of a much later generation of rock climbers. Fiercely independent, a determined controversialist in private and very occasionally in print, Eckenstein abhorred convention. Crowley stated: 'His detestation of every kind of humbug and false pretence was an overmastering passion. I have never met any man who upheld the highest moral ideals with such unflinching candour' (Crowley, 151).

Heslop, Harold (1898-1983), coalminer and author, was born on 1 October 1898 in the village of Rough Lea, Hunwick, co. Durham, the second of the eight children of William Heslop, coalminer, and his wife, Isobel (or Isabella), 'nee' Whitfield. The Heslops had been miners for several generations; Heslop's father was deputy at Rough Lea colliery (managed by his grandfather) and later an overman at neighbouring Bitchburn colliery. Heslop won a scholarship to King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland. When he was fourteen, however, his father was appointed manager of an ironstone mine at Boulby on the north Yorkshire coast; the nearest grammar school, at Guisborough, was too far to walk, so he began working underground at Boulby. 
Within a few months his mother died in labour. William Heslop remarried almost immediately and accepted a job as manager of a reopened seam at Wylam in Northumberland. The family moved again and Heslop started work there, but his stepmother had children of her own and encouraged her stepchildren to leave home. Heslop moved to South Shields and started work at Harton colliery, where he remained for the next eleven years, apart from a few months' training with the 110th Royal Hussars at the end of the First World War. He was secretary of his Independent Labour Party branch and active in his union lodge, which he represented on the council of the Durham Miners' Association. 
In 1923 Heslop applied for a Durham Miners' Association scholarship to study at the Central Labour College in London, earning the highest marks out of a hundred candidates that year, and he studied at the college from 1924 to 1926. It seems likely that he joined the Communist Party while he was in London. He met Phyllis Hannah Varndell, a young ledger clerk at Selfridges from a family active in the Social Democratic Federation; her father, Samuel Varndell, was a sculptor. They married at Lambeth register office on 27 March 1926. 
While at the college Heslop wrote a novel about the activities of the communist-led minority movement in the Durham coalfield. He could not find a publisher for it, but Ivan Maysky, secretary to the Soviet legation in London, arranged for it to be published in 1926 as 'Pod vlastu uglya' ('Under the sway of coal') in the Soviet Union, where it sold over half a million copies. 
The Heslops returned to South Shields in October 1926, in time to see the Durham miners go back to work, defeated again after a stoppage lasting nearly seven months. Because he refused a clerical job at Harton colliery it was another five months before he was working. He taught classes in Marxism and economics for the National Council of Labour Colleges in South Shields and Newcastle, and contested the Shields ward (unsuccessfully) for the Labour Party in local elections of 1927. He was also active in the minority movement inside the Durham Miners' Association, and wrote two penny-pamphlets attacking the anti-trade union sentiments of the local Northern Press newspapers, 'Who are your Masters'? (1927) and 'Who are your Masters Now'? (1927). 
At the end of 1927 Harton colliery made 900 men redundant, including Heslop. He and Phyllis moved to live with her mother in London, where he found occasional work as a labourer between long periods of unemployment. He published two novels, 'The Gate of a Strange Field' (1929) about the general strike and 'Journey Beyond' (1930) about unemployment in London. He returned north during the general election campaign in 1929 to support the Communist Party general secretary, Harry Pollitt, who stood against Ramsay MacDonald for the Seaham division of Durham. He also helped Bob Ellis to write and edit the minority movement paper 'The Worker'. 
In November 1930 Heslop and Ellis attended the second conference of the International Union of Proletarian and Revolutionary Writers in Kharkov in Ukraine; there he met senior Comintern literary intellectuals including Mikhail Sholokhov, Louis Aragon, and Alexander Fadayev. He returned a convinced admirer of Soviet communism. At the same time he was important to the Soviet literary apparatus. Four of his novels were published in the Soviet Union, including 'Red Earth' (1931), a utopian novel about a successful revolution in Britain which was never published in the UK. The Soviets even considered filming 'Pod vlastu uglya' with a script by the novelist Yevgeny Zamyatin, whom Heslop met in Leningrad in 1930. 
Back in London, Ivan Maysky found Heslop work at Arcos, the Soviet trading mission in London; in 1935 he moved to the London office of Intourist. Four more books followed, to very considerable critical acclaim: 'Goaf' (1934), an English version of 'Plod vlastu uglya'; a detective novel, 'The Crime of Peter Ropner' (1934); 'Last Cage Down' (1935); and (as Lincoln J. White) 'Abdication' (1937), a study written with Bob Ellis about the abdication crisis, which sold over 40,000 copies. 
During the Second World War the Heslops and their two children, Maril and Michael, moved to Taunton in Somerset. There he finished his last and most successful novel, 'The Earth Beneath' (1946). It was a rich and scholarly history of work and family life in the Durham coalfield in the nineteenth century, Methodism and socialism, poaching and preaching, and the bitter struggles to establish trade unionism. The novel sold 9000 copies and was translated into Italian. It was published in the USA, where it was entered for the MGM movie contest; the novelist Pearl Buck declared it 'one of the best novels I have read' (letter to Heslop, 1947, Heslop MSS). 
In 1948 Heslop began working for the Ordnance Survey in Taunton. He was still active in the Labour Party: secretary of the Taunton constituency Labour Party, he twice stood for Taunton council and contested North Devon as Labour candidate in the general election of 1955. Although he continued to write for the rest of his life (including an autobiography) he never had anything published again. He died in Tone Valley Hospital, Taunton, on 10 November 1983. 
Almost single-handed Heslop created the mining novel in Britain. Other miner-novelists were later able to build on his achievements. But it was Heslop who first proved that it was possible to write about life in a pit village without D. H. Lawrence's scorn or George Orwell's sentimentality.

Swingler, Randall Carline (1909-1967), writer, was born on 27 May 1909 at Glebe House, Church Lane, Aldershot, Hampshire, the fourth of the seven children of Humphrey Thomas Carline Swingler (1877-1938), assistant curate of Aldershot parish church, later vicar of Long Eaton in Nottinghamshire and Cranbrook in Kent, and his wife, Mabel Henrietta Davidson (1878-1962). His grandfather, Henry Swingler, was an ironmaster, railway builder, coal owner, and deputy lieutenant of Derbyshire. His maternal grandfather was Colonel Charles Elliott of the Seaforth Highlanders and the Madras artillery. His uncle and godfather was the archbishop of Canterbury Randall Thomas Davidson (1848-1930). Stephen Swingler (1915-1969), his younger brother, became a junior minister in Harold Wilson's government. 
Swingler was educated at home until he was ten, when he went to St Ronan's preparatory school in Worthing. He attended Winchester College from 1921 to 1928 and graduated from New College, Oxford, where he earned a reputation as a runner, flautist, and poet. In 1931 he met the concert pianist Geraldine Peppin (1913-1980), for whom he wrote 'Poems' (1932). They married on 17 April 1933 and moved to the Cotswolds, where their daughter Judith was born in 1935. Swingler was a schoolteacher for a few years after leaving Oxford. 
Like many of his generation Swingler believed that the political and economic crises of the 1930s required revolutionary solutions, a conviction expressed in the poems of 'Reconstruction' (1933) and the widely acclaimed 'Difficult Morning' (1933). In 1934 the Swinglers joined the Communist Party and Randall gave away his inherited wealth to the party. With his Jean Gabin-like good looks and unworldly charm, Swingler was the best-known young writer then active in the party. He edited 'Left Review' and published Nancy Cunard's 'Authors Take Sides on the Spanish War' (1937). He wrote a new version of 'Peer Gynt' for the Group Theatre (where he was assistant editor of the 'Group Theatre Magazine') and several plays for the Unity Theatre, including the mass declamation 'Spain' (1936), and 'Crisis', about the Munich negotiations (1938). He wrote 'Peace and Prosperity' (1937) for the London Choral Union, a new version of Handel's 'Belshazzar' (1938) for the London Co-op Choirs, and the chorale finale of Alan Bush's 'Piano Concerto' (1938). In 1938 he launched his own radical paperback publishing company, Fore Publications, selling half a million books in twelve months. 
A flautist of professional standard (he played with the London Symphony Orchestra), he was active in the Workers' Music Association and in the Left Book Club, for whom he and Bush edited the 'Left Song Book' (1938). Swingler and Bush also organized the 1939 Festival of Music and the People, which included an Albert Hall pageant written by Swingler and starring Paul Robeson, as well as the premier of Benjamin Britten's 'Ballad of Heroes', for whose libretto Swingler collaborated with W. H. Auden. Swingler published two well-received novels, 'No Escape' (1937) and 'To Town' (1939). In 1939 he was made literary editor of the 'Daily Worker'. 
During the first months of the Second World War Swingler worked as a staff reporter for the 'Daily Worker', writing anti-government blitz journalism until the paper was banned in 1941. He took over the journal 'Poetry and the People', relaunching it as 'Our Time', and brought the magazine 'Seven' into the Fore Publications stable as a magazine of new writing from the forces. Called up at the end of 1941, he trained as a wireless operator before being posted overseas with the 56th divisional signals. Swingler took part in the Salerno landings in September 1943, and was in almost continuous action for the next twenty months. He was made a corporal at Anzio, and for his part in the battle of Lake Commachio (April 1945) was awarded the Military Medal for bravery. 
Swingler returned to London in 1946 to edit 'Our Time' with Edgell Rickword. He broadcast regularly for the BBC, taught adult education classes for the University of London, and collected his war poems in 'The Years of Anger' (1946). A familiar figure in the London bars of Fitzrovia, he had a brief affair with the novelist Penelope Dimont ['see 'Mortimer, Penelope Ruth (1918-1999)]; their daughter, Deborah, was born in 1948 after the affair ended earlier that year. 
In cold war London Swingler found himself attacked from both sides. His adult education classes were investigated and he was blacklisted at the BBC; inside the Communist Party he was attacked for liberal sympathies and forced to resign from 'Our Time'. Its successors 'Arena' and 'Circus' both proved short-lived, too literary for the Communist Party and too political for the book trade. When in 1950 Fore Publications published a series of poetry books, including Swingler's 'The God in the Cave', they were ignored by literary London and denounced as 'bohemian' by the Communist Party. Visits to Czechoslovakia in 1953 and Romania in 1954 did nothing to persuade Swingler that communism was not in crisis, and he resigned from the Communist Party early in 1956, just prior to the Hungarian rising. The following year he helped found the journal 'New Reasoner'. 
Swingler spent the last decade of his life in the village of Pebmarsh in Essex. While Geraldine taught at the Guildhall School of Music, he stayed at home to look after their son Dan, born in 1951. He wrote a book about the Lidice massacre, in Czechoslovakia during the Second World War (unpublished), and several librettos for his friends Bernard Stevens and Alan Rawsthorne. By 1965 writer's block, political despair, financial worries, heavy drinking, and medication for a serious heart condition combined to cause a breakdown. He died of a heart attack on 19 June 1967, outside the York Minster pub in Soho, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium, London. 
Although Randall Swingler published only five books of poetry, he was a prolific playwright, novelist, librettist, critic, editor, and lyric poet, and a unique and unflinching witness to his times, from the idealistic communism of the early 1930s to the grim defeats of the cold war.

Crabb, Lionel Kenneth Philip (1909-1956), naval frogman, was born on 28 January 1909 at 4 Greyswood Street, Streatham, London, the son of Hugh Alexander Crabb, a commercial traveller for a firm of photographic merchants, and his wife, Beatrice Goodall. Crabb was described by contemporaries as a most courageous diver able to endure great discomfort, but technically inept and a man of action rather than a thinker: those assessments well summarize an overexciting career below the surface that extended from 1941 to a controversial end in 1956. 
Little is known about Crabby or Buster Crabb's early life save that it was modestly commercial -- unlike his diving career, which combined a fascination for ultra-secret missions with Edwardian flamboyancy. He was apt, as a commander, to carry a gold-topped cane and wear a vivid waistcoat under a naval monkey jacket; and he displayed an imperious manner which contrasted oddly with his habitual lopsided grin and 5-foot-and-a-bit stature. Crabb joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve before the war, and in 1940 he volunteered for bomb disposal duties. Following attacks by Italian human torpedoes in the Mediterranean a call went out for shallow-water divers to help defend Gibraltar harbour against submerged predators. Crabb responded to join a small team charged with singularly forbidding responsibilities. These included combating Italian underwater saboteurs and disabling weapons attached to ships' hulls, removing depth charges from sunken aircraft, and recovering dead bodies from the sea. 
After the Italian armistice in 1943 Crabb co-opted frogmen of the former enemy into a resolutely non-bureaucratic anti-German activity near Venice; and, when the war ended, he was seconded to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in a risky venture to help observe the behaviour of trawlers at close hand. In 1947 he was invested with the George Medal and the OBE. Crabb was first into the water, in a vain effort to assist, after HM submarine 'Truculent' had sunk by accident in the Thames estuary in 1950. He was promoted to commander in 1952, and on 15 March that year he married Margaret Elaine, the daughter of Henry Charles Brackenbury Williamson and the former wife of Ernest Albert Player. The couple separated in 1953, and divorced about two years later. 
Crabb retired in 1954 but reappeared at Portsmouth on 17 April 1956 with a relatively junior member of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and booked a room at the Sally Port Hotel. He met senior police officers and then went to HMS 'Vernon' (the torpedo, anti-submarine, and diving establishment), where Crabb persuaded a clearance diver to dress him for an important dive on the following day and take him by car to the dockyard where the Soviet cruiser 'Ordzhonikidze', bearing the Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchov to Britain for a formal visit, would be lying alongside the premier berth. 
Subsequent events, although still the subject of media speculation, are in no doubt. At 5.30 p.m. on 18 April 1956 Crabb, required by the SIS on behalf of naval intelligence to measure the Russian cruiser's propellers for the benefit of the north Atlantic sound surveillance system (SOSUS), entered the water at King's Stairs some 80 yards from his objective; but he became caught in dockside piling and aborted. Early the next morning Crabb tried again but had difficulty with his equipment and swam back to King's Stairs for a few minutes. He returned to the water but was never seen alive again, except briefly at 7.35 a.m. by a lookout on one of the Soviet cruiser's escorting destroyers. A body, without head or extremities but with every indication of being Crabb, was discovered in Chichester harbour, Sussex, on 9 June 1957, over a year later. Meanwhile, the British government was embarrassed by clumsy attempts to cover up Crabb's disappearance. The prime minister, Anthony Eden, had expressly forbidden any intelligence operation during the Russian visit, and he was furious when he learned of MI6's involvement in the escapade. 
The facts were that Crabb was middle-aged and unfit for diving at the limits of safety for non-revealing apparatus: a colleague remarked that he trained on whisky. Oxygen and/or carbon dioxide poisoning was almost inevitable in the circumstances. Tidal streams and currents predictably carried the corpse 10 miles to where it was eventually found -- marking the sadly fruitless demise of a brave man.

Joseph Walker (1673-1729), nailmaker and farmer, of Grenoside, in the parish of Ecclesfield, 5 miles north of Sheffield, and his second wife, Ann Hargreaves (died 1741); there were also three daughters. Following their marriage in 1710 Joseph and Ann lived at Hollin House, Hill Top, Grenoside, and some time after 1722 they moved a short distance to Stubbing House, though they continued to lease Hollin House and two cottages in Grenoside. Joseph Walker was one of the numerous nailmakers who lived and worked in the countryside immediately north of the cutlery-manufacturing district centred on Sheffield. The mining and smelting of iron there were centuries old, and industries were now slowly adapting from charcoal fuel to the use of coke. South Yorkshire was also becoming a centre for the manufacture of steel in cementation furnaces and in the new crucible furnaces pioneered by Benjamin Huntsman. Joseph Walker died at Grenoside on 21 December 1729.

Essex, Agnes of, countess of Oxford (b. 1151, d. in or after 1206), noblewoman, was the daughter of Henry of Essex, royal constable, and his wife, Cecily. Betrothed by her father to Geoffrey de Vere, brother of Aubrey de Vere, first earl of Oxford, Agnes was raised from the age of three in the earl's household. When she was six Geoffrey took her into his own care, but Agnes refused to accept him as her future husband. The alliance between their families was rescued by her marriage to Aubrey in early 1163. The middle-aged earl had no heir when he made this, his third marriage, with the twelve-year-old Agnes. Although she was not an heiress, she brought him five knights' fees in the eastern counties. 
Shortly after his daughter's marriage, Agnes's father was accused of treason and defeated in trial by battle. As a consequence of the scandal, the de Veres sought to have the earl's marriage annulled. The case came before Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London. Agnes fought the annulment, finally appealing to Rome on 9 May 1166. While her case was being reviewed the countess had to endure the earl's displeasure; Bishop Gilbert rebuked Aubrey for having confined Agnes in one of his castles, denying her her marital rights and preventing her attendance at mass. The earl appears to have heeded the bishop, for the couple's first child was most likely born before 1168. 
The de Vere case was among those Pope Alexander III considered as he developed the canon law of marriage. Although the extant papal letter does not discuss the specifically legal issues under consideration -- it addresses the earl's treatment of Agnes, and threatens excommunication and interdict if he fails to conform to the church's ruling -- the pope assumes throughout the validity of the marriage of Agnes to Aubrey. Among the contended issues, that of consent was foremost. The de Veres contended that Agnes's betrothal to Geoffrey invalidated her marriage to Aubrey. As Agnes herself had pointed out, having been raised by the de Veres as Geoffrey's intended bride from the age of three, she had no formal opportunity to consent to or reject the plans made for her. Yet before her twelfth birthday, Agnes had taken the unusual step of writing to her father to express her absolute opposition to the match with Geoffrey. The church accepted that action as sufficient to break their betrothal, freeing her to marry the earl. 
Agnes and Aubrey de Vere had at least four sons and a daughter: Aubrey (IV) de Vere, second earl of Oxford; Roger; Robert de Vere, the third earl; Henry, possibly a clerk of his uncle, Bishop William of Hereford; and Alice, wife of Geoffrey de Say. She witnessed few of her husband's surviving charters, but they were joint founders of a small nunnery at Castle Hedingham, Essex ('c'.1190), and were benefactors of the de Vere priory at Earls Colne, Essex, and of the hospitallers, of which order the earl's brother was a member. Her husband died in December 1194, and the countess survived him for at least a dozen years. In 1198 she offered the king 100 marks for the right to marry whom she wished; Agnes paid the debt within a year and remained unmarried until her death, which took place in or after 1206. Agnes was buried beside her husband at Earls Colne Priory, Essex.

George Vandenhoff (1820-1885), actor and lawyer, born on 18 February 1820, made his debut at Covent Garden on 14 October 1839, as Leon in Beaumont and Fletcher's 'Rule a Wife and Have a Wife'. Among other parts later played by him at that theatre was Mercutio in Madame Vestris's production of 'Romeo and Juliet'. In August 1842 he took his farewell of the English stage, as Hamlet, and migrated to America, where he made his debut, as Hamlet once again, at the Park Theatre, New York, followed by appearances at the Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. For the next ten years he lived mainly in New York, where he staged a translation of Sophocles' 'Antigone' with music by Mendelssohn (1845), played Claude Melnotte at Wallack's Theatre (1852), gave poetry readings, and taught elocution. On 20 August 1855, in Boston, he married an actress, Miss Mackean, who had appeared in New York and Philadelphia, but on her marriage decided to retire from the stage. Soon Vandenhoff returned to England. He ceased to act after he was called to the bar in November 1858. He continued to give poetry readings, however, and published a volume of theatrical anecdotes, 'Dramatic Reminiscences' (1860). His final appearance on stage was with Genevieve Ward in 1878, when he played Wolsey in 'Henry VIII' and Gloster in 'Jane Shore'.

John Gibbons (1703-1778), who was active as an ironmonger by the mid-1730s. By origin the family were yeoman farmers who steadily acquired modest amounts of land in the parish of Sedgeley in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Landownership led them into mineral exploitation, and the Gibbonses were engaged in the coal trade from at least the 1620s. Their entry into the burgeoning metalware manufacturing sector in the west midlands was at the initiative of John Gibbons. The son of William Gibbons (1673-1744), farmer and coal proprietor, and his wife, Elizabeth Hawksford, Gibbons evidently flourished as a putting-out nailer, since from the 1750s he moved into primary iron processing, leasing first Pitchford forge in Shropshire, then a succession of forges in the Stour valley on the border of Staffordshire and Worcestershire. 
John Gibbons and his wife, Grace Austin (1708-1785), had three sons, who carried on their father's business after his death in 1778:

John Gibbons (1777-1851), ironmaster, proved the most technically adept of the brothers, publishing two short works on industrial practice: 'Practical Remarks on the Construction of the Staffordshire Blast Furnace' (1839) and 'Practical remarks on the use of the cinder pig in the puddling furnaces, and on the management of the forge and mill' (1844). He was married to Elizabeth Steen (died 1889), who survived his death in 1851. 
As a whole, the family was innovative, being one of the earliest south Staffordshire iron partnerships to adopt J. B. Neilson's patent hot-blast technology when it became widely available in the mid-1830s. However, there was little they could do to overcome the declining competitiveness of south Staffordshire as a pig iron-producing region, eclipsed as it was by Scotland and Cleveland in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. The family's problems in the iron trade were for a long time compensated for by the resilience of their coal interests. The long-established Gibbons habit of buying land stood them in good stead, for it furnished them with a good deal of mineral-rich real estate in south Staffordshire. The Corbyns Hall estate proved a consistent source of wealth in this respect. Yet the family's difficulties were compounded by entrepreneurial (and demographic) failure. A new generation of ironmasters did not emerge, leaving the elder Benjamin Gibbons, a childless bachelor, to preside over a slow running down of the business. The Level works were relinquished in the mid-1840s and the Ketley furnaces were never worked after 1858. The Corbyns Hall furnaces were the last to go, being blown out in 1869. 
The last burst of entrepreneurial dynamism in the iron trade came from the Bristol branch of the family, not the west midland.

Pickard, Percy Charles (1915-1944), air force officer, was born at 82 Main Road, Handsworth, Sheffield, on 16 May 1915, the youngest in the family of two sons and three daughters of Percy Pickard, stone merchant, and his wife, Jennie Skelton. In 1920 the family moved to Hampstead, London, where Pickard's father began a successful catering business that later became part of the Mecca Organisation. After an undistinguished academic career at Framlingham College, Suffolk, Pickard left for Kenya in 1932, where he farmed for four years and earned a three handicap at polo. In November 1935 he joined the King's African rifles reserve as a territorial. 
After returning to England in 1936, Pickard failed to qualify as an army officer, but was accepted by the RAF and was commissioned in 1937 as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force reserve of pilots (for which his public school education qualified him) and was posted to Bomber Command. By 1939 he was assistant and personal pilot to Air Marshal Sir John Baldwin, commandant of the RAF college at Cranwell. On 11 November 1939 he married (against her parents' wishes), at Caxton Hall register office, Westminster, Dorothy Hodgkin (1912/13-1998), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Sidney Hodgkin and his wife, Elsie Gray McMordie, daughter of a former lord mayor of Belfast. They had a son, born in 1943. 
Promoted to squadron leader in 1940, 'Pick' Pickard gained a well-deserved reputation for leadership (he was awarded the DFC in July 1940), if a touch eccentric in his methods. He took his wife's sheepdog, Ming, on training flights as an 'Observer', and relaxed from flying bombers by solo acrobatic flying in tiger moths. In early 1941 he was posted to command 311 (Czech) squadron, and gained the DSO in March. Blond, pipe-smoking, and 6 feet 4 inches tall, he came to the notice of the film director Harry Watt, who chose him to star as the pilot of the Wellington bomber 'F for Freddy' in the Crown Film Unit's documentary feature, 'Target for Tonight' (1941). Subsequently he was flight commander with 9 squadron, where he met Sergeant John Alan ('Bill') Broadley, who joined him as a regular navigator. 
In November 1941 Pickard took command of 51 squadron, with the rank of wing commander. He led the force of twelve Whitley bombers which successfully dropped paratroopers at Bruneval on the French coast during the night of 27-28 February 1942 to capture, examine, and destroy a German radar station. After doing a reprise of the Bruneval drop for the king and queen, Pickard was given the opportunity by George VI to explain how Pickard's boot-black footprints and backside came to decorate the mess ceiling. For his part in the Bruneval raid he was awarded his second DSO in May 1942. In October 1942 he was given command of 161 squadron at RAF Tempsford; from there, with his exceptionally gifted pilots flying Lysanders and Hudsons, he took part in Special Operations Executive missions over occupied France. Awarded a second bar to his DSO in March 1943, he became the first RAF officer during the Second World War to be awarded the DSO three times. In May 1943, handpicked by Air Vice-Marshal Basil Embry, commander of no. 2 group, Tactical Air Force, he was promoted acting group captain and given command of 140 wing. Throughout winter 1943-4 his wing attacked German V-1 rocket sites in the Pas-de-Calais. 
On 18 February 1944, commanding his wing (487 squadron Royal New Zealand Air Force, 464 squadron Royal Australian Air Force, and 21 squadron RAF, and one photographic reconnaissance aircraft) now based at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, Pickard led operation Jericho. The objective of the raid, originally designated by the codename operation Renovate, was to breach the walls of the prison at Amiens in order to free members of the French Resistance movement, some of whom were facing imminent execution at the hands of the Germans. It was a daylight raid, comprising nineteen Mosquitos, requiring precision bombing from low level (50 ft). After the first two waves of bombers had successfully blasted open sections of the walls, Pickard stayed behind to assess the impact, but was attacked by two German Focke-Wulf fighters, and shot down near the village of St Gratien, 5 miles north-east of Amiens. He and Flight Lieutenant Broadley, his navigator, were killed. They were buried by the Germans on the following day in the cemetery of St Pierre, next to the prison at Amiens. 
Pickard's lack of experience of low-level sorties had, in the view of Embry, who organized the operation, contributed to his death. Embry had intended to lead the operation himself, but was forbidden to do so by his commanding officer, Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, commanding the allied expeditionary force. In his memoirs Embry wrote: 'It is impossible to measure Charles Pickard's loss to the RAF and Britain, but in courage, devotion to duty, fighting spirit and powers of real leadership, he stood out as one of the great airmen of the war and as a shining example of British manhood. (Embry, 264)' After the war Pickard's widow and son emigrated to Southern Rhodesia. As a memorial to Pickard and his friend Broadley, a Mosquito repainted and re-coded to represent the aircraft that they flew to Amiens, is on exhibition at the De Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre, London Colney, near St Albans.

James William Wallack (1818-1873), the son of Henry John Wallack and Fanny Wallack, 'nee' Jones, affectionately referred to as Young Jim Wallack, became an extremely successful actor. He was born in London on 24 February 1818 and taken to the USA by his parents the following year. His first appearance on stage was at the age of four at the Chesnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, playing the part of Cora's child with his uncle James William Wallack (1795-1864) in 'Pizarro'. He was educated at private schools in New York and England, and at the age of fourteen he became a call boy at the Bowery Theatre, New York, where he also played small parts. In 1835, after three years of touring England with various provincial companies, he joined his father, then stage-manager at Covent Garden. In 1837 he was engaged for the National Theatre, New York, by his uncle James William, who opened there in 'The Rivals', young James playing the role of Fag. By 1844 he had married at New Orleans a Mrs Ann Sefton (1815-1879), formerly Ann Duff Waring, a tragic actress, who subsequently appeared with him in many plays. They had two children, who both died young. Among the more successful roles played by the younger James William in the next few years were Othello at the Haymarket, London, in 1851 and Macbeth at the Arch Street Theatre, Philadelphia, in 1852. In 1853 and 1855 he made attempts at management in London and Paris without much success. Afterwards he remained in the United States, where he built a highly successful and lucrative career. In 1865 he joined the stock company of his cousin Lester Wallack at the latter's theatre in New York, and in December 1867 he appeared for the first time in the role of Fagin in 'Oliver Twist'. At Booth's Theatre, in the winter of 1872-3, he made a good impression on the public as Mercutio in 'Romeo and Juliet', Jaques in 'As You Like It', and other classic Shakespearian characters. Soon, however, he was forced by tuberculosis to retire from the stage. He died a few months later, on 24 May 1873, on a train near Aiken in South Carolina, where he had gone for the benefit of his health.

Toynbee, Jocelyn Mary Catherine (1897-1985), archaeologist and art historian, was born at 12 Upper Westbourne Terrace, Paddington, London, on 3 March 1897, the daughter of Harry Valpy Toynbee (1861-1941), secretary of the Charity Organization Society, and his wife Sarah Edith, 'nee' Marshall (1859-1939). She was educated at Winchester High School for Girls and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she was awarded firsts in both parts of the classical tripos (1919 and 1920). Her family was noted for its scholarly talents and its social concerns; her mother, who had been a student at Newnham and had taken a first in the Cambridge historical tripos, was a particularly important influence upon her. These family traits were continued in her own generation by her brother Arnold Joseph Toynbee and her sister Margaret, as well as by herself. 
After briefly teaching classics at Cheltenham Ladies' College, at twenty-four Toynbee was appointed tutor in classics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, a post she held from 1921 to 1924, when she resigned along with the other tutors in protest against the dismissal of Cecilia Ady by the principal Eleanor Jourdain. She then became lecturer in classics at Reading University. Her election in 1927 as fellow and director of studies in classics at Newnham and appointment in 1931 as lecturer in classics at Cambridge provided her with a secure post and an ideal base for developing her own research interests. She held these posts until 1951. 
Toynbee played a notably supportive role at Newnham. She was a devoted and sympathetic tutor of undergraduates. At first meeting she might appear austere and a little forbidding, but her charm and obvious humanity were quick to emerge. She helped many of her pupils to find posts after graduation. She was also a helpful and careful supervisor of research students, though at no stage did they constitute a school. Her lectures were distinguished by her great powers of exposition as well as by her wide and deep knowledge of her subject. She was not an active excavator or field worker, but she was an accomplished interpreter of archaeological evidence. Her particular forte was Roman art, encouraged by early contacts with Eugenie Strong, though this was as broadly based as it could be, including architecture, coinage, dress, and even hair-styles. In the mid-twentieth century she was the leading British scholar in Roman artistic studies and one of the recognized authorities in this field in the world. 
Toynbee's particular interest was the culture of the Roman empire and the continuity of Greek artistic traditions within it. Her major publications began with 'The Hadrianic School: a Chapter in the History of Greek Art' (1934), based on the dissertation for which she was awarded an Oxford DPhil in 1930, and 'Roman Medallions' (1944). They were greatly augmented after her election to the Laurence chair of classical archaeology at Cambridge in 1951. Her long career as a college tutor and lecturer who could cover a wide academic range in both classics and the archaeology of the classical world and her world reputation as a scholar and expositor made her the obvious choice for the appointment. Over the following eleven years a series of major works appeared, ranging from Rome to Roman Britain. With J. B. Ward Perkins she published 'The Shrine of St Peter and the Vatican Excavations' in 1956. As a convert to Roman Catholicism and a devoted Catholic thereafter, this was a project with peculiar significance for her. Her mastery of Roman sculpture and its subtle resonances was brilliantly displayed in 'The Flavian Reliefs from the Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome' (1957). 
These monographs were accompanied by many papers on individual discoveries from north Africa to the temple of Mithras in London and the moving early Christian mosaic in the villa at Hinton St Mary in Dorset. Toynbee's interest in the art of Roman Britain revealed a wide appreciation of provincial and Celtic art as well as work in the Graeco-Roman tradition. At the time of her retirement from the Laurence chair, in 1962, she was involved with a major exhibition of Romano-British art at the then Guildhall Museum in London, for which she wrote the catalogue 'Art in Roman Britain' (1962). This was shortly followed by 'Art in Britain under the Romans' (1964). Her retirement to Oxford, where she joined her sister Margaret, opened another productive phase. 'Death and Burial in the Roman World' (1971) covered an immense sweep from Etruscan Italy to the Ostrogothic kingdom. 'Animals in Roman Life and Art' (1973) is a delightfully characteristic work which reminded her former Cambridge pupils of lectures in earlier decades. 'Roman Historical Portraits' (1977) was more severely technical and lacked the humane insights of her earlier studies. 
At the heart of Jocelyn Toynbee's life and work was her devotion to learning, especially classical learning. Given the scholarly nature of her family, this is understandable. For her, scholarship was an essential and unquestionable part of life. She was genuinely distressed by the thought that schools might not provide instruction in Latin. Administration was not a field in which she felt at home, but she met its inevitable demands with dutiful attention. Her wise counsel was deployed at Newnham and in the learned societies to which she belonged. She was a determined fighter for the causes she espoused, but she won many to her side by her total absence of rancour. Long after her formal retirement she was still advising research students and other young scholars, despite increasing deafness. Until shortly before her death she was still eager to hear of new discoveries and reinterpretations. 
Toynbee was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1943), which awarded her the Frend medal for her contributions to the archaeology of the Christian church, a fellow and medallist of the Royal Numismatic Society, and a fellow of the British Academy (1952). She also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Newcastle (1967) and Liverpool (1968). She died, unmarried, at 4 Marston Ferry Road, Oxford, on 31 December 1985.

Welsford, Enid Elder Hancock (1892-1981), literary scholar, was born on 26 February 1892 at Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex. She was the daughter of Joseph William Wilson Welsford (1856-1909), mathematics master at Harrow School and a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and Mildred Laura Hancock (died 1935), a painter of some note. Until 1909 Enid Welsford was educated at the Conamur School in Sandgate, Kent. A creative and sensitive child, she was the author of a book of poetry, 'The Seagulls and other Poems', which her parents had published and placed in the Cambridge University Library in 1904. At seventeen Welsford began her literary studies with W. P. Ker at University College, London, taking her first degree in 1911. In that year she went to Newnham College, Cambridge, where in 1914 she earned first-class honours in the medieval and modern languages tripos, with a distinction in Old English. At Newnham, Welsford met Nora Kershaw, later Chadwick, who became a lifelong friend. In 1915 Welsford was awarded a Marion Kennedy studentship at Newnham which she used to study comparative literature with Professor H. M. Chadwick, her friend's husband, beginning what she described as 'a long and delightful initiation into research' (Welsford, viii). Welsford continued her research with Chadwick until about 1917 or 1918, when she decided to concentrate on a later period of literature. She began teaching at Newnham in 1916. 
In 1918 Welsford was awarded an associate research fellowship at Newnham, where she spent the rest of her career. She was elected a fellow in 1921 and served as director of studies in English from 1929 to 1952, as a lecturer in the faculty of English from 1923, and university lecturer from 1928 to 1959. Demonstrating her versatility, Welsford also served as director of studies in archaeology and anthropology from 1939 to 1952, and in moral sciences from 1941 to 1952. Conscious of the cold climate for women scholars in Cambridge, Welsford founded the University Women's Research Club in 1919 with M. D. Haviland, and served as its president several times. 
Welsford's early publications included an article in the 'Modern Language Review', 'Italian influence on the English court masque', in 1923, and four articles in the 'Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics' (1917-21). Her first book, 'The Court Masque', was published in 1927. She acknowledged the influence of Professor Chadwick and her Newnham colleague Jane Ellen Harrison, describing the masque as 'strangely like those pantomimic ritual dances of which we hear so much from the students of comparative religion' (Welsford, viii). Extremely erudite, wide-ranging, well written and researched, 'The Court Masque' was awarded the Rose Mary Crawshay prize of the British Academy in 1928, and has been reissued many times. Welsford dedicated it to her only brother, Geoffrey, who was killed in the First World War. 
Welsford's most important work, 'The Fool: his Social and Literary History', was published in 1935. She delighted in recounting how the publisher commissioned the work, telling her that she was the ideal person to write on the subject. Well reviewed in its time, the book has remained influential, as a source for theatrical production, and inspired a Festschrift, 'The Fool and the Trickster: Studies in Honour of Enid Welsford', in 1979. 
At Newnham Welsford was a popular if demanding teacher. She established lifelong friendships with many of her students, including literary scholars Elsie Duncan-Jones, Sita Narasimhan, and Dorothea Krook. She founded the Informal Club, where students, liberally provided by her with sweets and cigarettes, discussed literary issues of the day. As well as a respected scholar and teacher, Welsford was known for her engaging personality, absent-mindedness, and sense of humour. She relished the amusing anecdotes that were often told about her, and she loved to argue and debate. A colleague recalled examining with her for the English tripos: 'Miss Welsford once prolonged a meeting for three hours by her objections to one question. Of course she won' (Duncan-Jones, 219). Welsford's intellectual engagement extended into religion. An active and committed Anglican, she was, however, closely connected with the Franciscan community of St Benet's in Cambridge. She was strongly ecumenical in outlook, serving as a member of the committees of the Christian Frontier Council and the Student Christian Movement for the inter-denominational conference of university teachers from 1950 to 1959. Welsford was also remarkable for her diminutive size; she had to have clothes specially made and had some difficulty doing ordinary tasks (although she was fond of skiing, skating, and more daringly fencing). 
Welsford remained active in the Newnham and Cambridge communities after her retirement. She continued her research, publishing 'Salisbury Plain, a Study in the Development of Wordsworth's Mind and Art' in 1966, and an edition of Spenser's 'Fowre Hymnes, Epithalamion' in 1967. She suffered a stroke in 1978. After several years of struggle, she died at her home, 7 Grange Road, Cambridge, on 4 December 1981. She was cremated; on 26 March 1982, as she requested, her ashes were interred in her mother's grave at Harrow.

Fielding, Una Lucy (1888-1969), neuroanatomist, was born on 2 May 1888 in Wellington, New South Wales, Australia. She was the eldest of five surviving children of the Revd Sydney Glanville Fielding, Anglican clergyman and author, and Lucy Frances Johnson. In 1893 the family moved to Windsor, near Sydney, where Una attended a small private school, transferring to St Catherine's Clergy Daughters' School in Waverley, New South Wales, in 1900. In 1907 Fielding won a scholarship to the University of Sydney, where she graduated BA in English and French in 1910. For six years she taught as a governess and in secondary schools in New South Wales, until, fulfilling a lifelong ambition to study medicine, she returned to the University of Sydney, earning the degree of BSc in 1919 and graduating MB ChM in 1922, one of only ten women in a class of over one hundred students. 
After a short time as a demonstrator at the University of Sydney in 1923, Fielding left Australia for University College, London, where her compatriot, Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, was head of the department of anatomy. At first Fielding earned so little as a demonstrator that she had to trim hats in the evening in order to support herself. Elliot Smith encouraged her to study the 'monotremes', the lowest form of mammals. In 1925, she presented her first paper on the brain of 'notoryctes', the marsupial mole, to the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, which she had joined in 1923. 
In 1927 Fielding spent a term as a demonstrator in neurology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and in 1928-9 was seconded as acting professor of histology and nervous anatomy to the American University of Beirut, where she helped to set up the department of anatomy. During this period Fielding collaborated with A. Parkes and F. W. R. Brambell in several publications on the ovary. She produced her most important work, however, upon her return from Beirut, when, based on her observations of 'notoryctes', she and Gregor T. Popa, professor of anatomy at the University of Jassy (Romania) and Rockefeller research fellow at University College, discovered the vascular link between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland; their joint findings were published in 'The Lancet' and the 'Journal of Anatomy' between 1930 and 1932. 
In 1928 Fielding was appointed lecturer in anatomy at University College, where she taught physiology undergraduates, pre-clinical medical students, and helped supervise postgraduates. Possessing a lifelong interest in anthropology Fielding also taught elementary physical anthropology to students in University College's department of archaeology and Egyptology. Meanwhile she continued her own research on the brain of the marsupial mole, publishing several papers independently in the 1930s. In 1935 Fielding was promoted to reader in neurological anatomy (known from 1937 as neuroanatomy) at University College. During this period Fielding started work on a textbook of neuroanatomy, of which her encyclopaedic knowledge and clear presentation made her an ideal author. She was interrupted, however, by the sudden death in January 1939 of H. H. Woollard, Elliot Smith's successor, and by the outbreak of war, during which all the notes for her book were destroyed by enemy action. From 1939 she served as acting head of the department of anatomy, initially overseeing the evacuation of the women medical students to Sheffield, and later the removal of the whole medical school to a manor house near Leatherhead, Surrey. Colleagues recall her tenure as a unique period in which men and women students and staff members found themselves living and working together under the same roof in one of the first truly co-educational medical school environments in England. Indeed, some colleagues felt that Fielding, who was particularly supportive of the women students, was never fully recognized for her role in holding the medical school together during the war years. 
Fielding remained as acting head of the department until the appointment of Professor J. Z. Young in 1945. In 1947, feeling that she needed a change, she resigned from University College to take a position organizing the anatomy department at the new Farouk 1st University in Alexandria, Egypt. Although she enjoyed the challenges of her work in Egypt, Fielding had to resign her position in December 1951 because of a radical shift in government policy which prohibited foreigners from holding office. She left Egypt in February 1952, forced to leave behind her valuable collection of books, papers, and drawings. 
After returning to England Una Fielding taught as a visiting lecturer at St Mary's, St Thomas's, and Middlesex Hospital medical schools, and tried once again to write her textbook. In 1965 she was appointed to the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England to reorganize and summarize the catalogue of brain specimens originally prepared by her mentor, Elliot Smith, in 1902. She produced a small book illustrated by line drawings which summarized the main points of each entry for students. 
Never in good health, Una Fielding became seriously ill in late 1968, and died on 11 August 1969 at St Pancras Hospital, London. In addition to her command of anatomy, Fielding was knowledgeable about literature, the arts, and architecture. She was active for many years in the British Federation of University Women, in fact living in its headquarters and residence, Crosby Hall, in Chelsea. Her colleagues described her as small in stature, with dark hair and eyes, usually wearing dark clothing and a hat. Although modest and self-effacing, she had a strong sense of justice and a reputed complete disregard for appearances in pursuing her beliefs.

Gorer, Geoffrey Edgar Solomon (1905-1985), anthropologist and author, was born at 45 Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead, London, on 26 March 1905 in London, the eldest of the three sons of Edgar Ezekiel Gorer (1872-1915), a London art dealer of note who died on the 'Lusitania', and his wife, Rachel Alice, 'nee' Cohen (1873-1954). The immunologist and geneticist Peter Alfred Isaac Gorer (1907-1961) was his younger brother. He was educated at Charterhouse School, spent a year at the Sorbonne (1922-3), graduated in 1927 from Jesus College, Cambridge, with a double first in classics and modern languages, and then passed the following year at the University of Berlin. 
As a young man Gorer saw himself as an imaginative writer, but his plays were not staged and he could not find a publisher for his picaresque novel. His first published book, 'The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade' (1934), enjoyed considerable critical success. Gorer was the first writer outside France to recognize de Sade as more than a purveyor of pornographic filth. The book was also his first attempt to explain modern social phenomena in psychological terms: in this case, the popular vote for the Nazis. 
Gorer's travels in the mid-1930s to Africa and the Far East drew him closer to the academic study of cross-cultural variation. On a trip to the USA in 1935 he met Margaret Mead, whose intimate colleague Ruth Benedict was then reviewing his 'Africa Dances' (1935, repr. 1945, 1949). Over the four months of his stay, Benedict informally instructed him in social anthropology. Mead became a very close friend for the rest of their lives. Though he espoused long-term study of a people, his only intensive fieldwork was a three-month spell among the Lepchas of Sikkim, published as 'Himalayan Village' (1938). Because of the injuries he sustained when he fell off a rock while in the Himalayas, he was advised, at least for the immediate future, to avoid further fieldwork in non-westernized areas. 
Instead Gorer deepened his social and psychological studies into western peoples. In 1939 he went to live in the USA when the humanities division of the Rockefeller Institute invited him to study the impact of radio and film on Americans. Subsequently he worked for the allied authorities on a series of investigations of national character. From his own account, his first such study, 'Japanese character structure and propaganda', produced as a mimeograph, had a 'quite fantastic circulation and influence' ('The Gorer papers', University of Sussex website). After the war he worked with Benedict and Mead on a series of studies of 'cultures at a distance'. His 'The Americans' (1948) was an analytical summary of opinion-poll surveys about American domestic culture. A year later he collaborated with the psychiatrist John Rickman to produce 'The People of Great Russia' in which he tried to interpret common Russian attitudes and behaviours in terms of their upbringing. 
In 1950 Gorer bought a small manor house and farm in Sussex, where he lived until his death. There he settled down as a freelance social scientist and literary critic, and devoted much time to his garden, winning prizes for his rhododendrons. During these decades he produced several substantial studies of English culture, the result of commissions by national newspapers: 'Exploring English Character' (1955), 'Death, Grief and Mourning in Contemporary Britain' (1965), and 'Sex and Marriage in England Today' (1971). He died at his home, Sunte House, near Haywards Heath, Sussex, on 24 May 1985. 
Gorer was considered a gallant man, of broad acquaintance. His friends included W. H. Auden, who dedicated a book of poems to him. His most significant and long-standing friendship, however, was with Margaret Mead. For decades they maintained an intense correspondence and went on annual holidays together, with Gorer organizing everything and vainly trying to show his workaholic companion 'how to have a good time'. Though it was often rumoured that the two (he a lifelong bachelor, she bisexual) were to marry, Mead later confided that she could not imagine having to apply medicine to his back. 
Gorer himself claimed that his 'chief sin' was sloth. He stated that he had not dedicated himself exclusively to social scientific work because of his private income and the easy money he made through journalism. Even though in 1966 his publisher described him as 'probably Britain's best known and respected social anthropologist', his work is little acknowledged today. While contemporary academics are unimpressed by his readiness to produce generalizations for the whole of a complex society, such as the USA, and his persistent enthusiasm for explaining social phenomena by reference to child-rearing practices, his genuinely pioneering social investigations of film, radio, television, and literature, as well as his studies of everyday culture, all deserve recognition as neglected exemplars of cultural studies 'avant la lettre'.

Balchin, Nigel Marlin (1908-1970), writer, was born on 3 December 1908 at The Butts, Potterne, Wiltshire, the third of the three children of William Edwin Balchin (1872-1958), grocer and master baker, and his wife, Ada Elizabeth Curtis (1870-1939). Balchin was educated at Dauntsey's School, West Lavington, near Devizes in Wiltshire, and then as an exhibitioner and prizeman at Peterhouse, Cambridge, gaining a second in part one of the natural sciences tripos (1929) and graduating in 1930. At Cambridge he wrote short stories which were influenced by his scientific studies. After graduation he joined the National Institute of Industrial Psychology and became a consultant to J. S. Rowntree & Son, the chocolate manufacturers in York. Here he pioneered a study of the psychology of the workplace to increase efficiency (he also claimed to be largely responsible for the marketing success of the Aero and Kit Kat chocolate bars). 
On 21 January 1933 Balchin married Elisabeth Evelyn Walshe (1910-1991) ['see 'Ayrton, Elisabeth Evelyn], whom he had met in Cambridge where she was a student; she was the daughter of the writer Douglas Walshe, and was later a writer herself. The couple had three daughters, including Penelope Leach, the developmental child psychologist. In the mid-1930s Balchin developed a second career as a writer and became a regular contributor to 'Punch'. Several articles for that journal were republished in book form as 'How to Run a Bassoon Factory' (1934) and 'Business for Pleasure' (1935) under the pseudonym Mark Spade; both were satires on efficiency in the workplace, and drew on his work at Rowntrees. He also wrote three novels under his own name -- 'No Sky' (1934), 'Simple Life' (1935), and 'Lightbody on Liberty' (1936), all critically successful -- and several stage plays. 
Balchin joined the War Office as a psychologist in its personnel section in 1941 and went on to become deputy scientific adviser to the army council, attaining the rank of brigadier. His experience of the cynical machinations of government departments in wartime, and the internecine rivalries and skulduggery of civil service mandarins, were graphically portrayed in his fourth and fifth novels, 'Darkness Falls from the Air' (1942) and 'The Small Back Room' (1943). The latter was made into a film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger in 1949. They were riveting stories, with steadily mounting tension and drama, but they also acquired instant status as contemporary social documents. In detached, terse, unsentimental prose, bitterness and humour being deployed in equal measure, Balchin captured the authentic atmosphere of London during the blitz, especially from the viewpoint of those working in Whitehall. He interwove private lives and emotions with depictions of life in government offices; the frustration of those in the lower ranks, desperate to get things moving but fated to see fresh initiatives stifled, were contrasted with the Machiavellian manoeuvres of complacent senior civil servants and their masters, intent on maintaining their own positions. With the publication of these two books Balchin attained some prominence as a novelist. He was also popularly credited, in later years, with having coined the terms 'back room boy' and 'boffin', although the evidence in support of these claims is not altogether conclusive. 
With the ending of the war Balchin moved from London to Kent, and decided to become a full-time writer, though he retained business interests into the 1950s. He consolidated his success with 'Mine Own Executioner' (1945), a cleverly developed tale of a psychoanalyst who, inspired initially with zeal and dedication, becomes disillusioned and goes sadly adrift in failing to prevent a steadily developing catastrophe. During the next ten years Balchin produced a novel on average every eighteen months, but these later works, while well crafted and usually quite absorbing, were not in the same league as their immediate predecessors. His output also included a number of short stories and some non-fiction work, and he continued to write plays. 
By the late 1940s Balchin's marriage was over. A cordial menage with the artist Michael Ayrton and his partner Joan, with whom Balchin was having an affair, ended when Elisabeth and Ayrton fell in love (they married in 1952). Balchin's novel 'A Way through the Wood' (1951) draws on this experience. Divorced from his first wife in 1951, Balchin married Yovanka Zorana Tomich ('b'. 1930), a Yugoslav refugee, on 5 February 1953; they had a son and a daughter. From 1952 until 1961 he devoted most of his attention to writing screenplays, at first in England and later in Hollywood. He received a BAFTA award for 'The Man Who Never Was' (1956) and did some preliminary work on 'Cleopatra' (1963), but life in Hollywood soon palled owing to his growing reliance on alcohol. During the 1960s he wrote three more novels, including 'Seen Dimly before Dawn' (1962), and some television plays. 
In appearance Balchin was a tall, sparse man, with penetrating blue eyes and an erudite expression. In later life he grew a beard. He interested himself in a wide range of activities, including music, gardening, wood-carving, and all types of sport (polo excepted). He died from a coronary thrombosis and pneumonia in the Greenaway Nursing Home, Fellowes Road, Hampstead, London, on 17 May 1970. He was buried at Hampstead cemetery three days later. His wife survived him.

Potter, Gillie (1887-1975), comedian and broadcaster, was born at 27 Weston Street, St Paul, Bedford, on 14 September 1887, the eldest son of the Revd Brignal Peel, a Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Elizabeth Stimson. He was educated at Bedford modern school and, briefly, Worcester College, Oxford, before embarking on the stage career that first made his name. 
He first appeared in E. M. Royle's 'The White Man' at the Lyric Theatre, London, thereafter in touring theatre, musical comedy, concert parties, and pantomime, and in 1915 was George Robey's understudy at the Alhambra. He served as a lieutenant in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary from February 1917. Returning to music-hall after the war he developed his highly individual comedic style and stage persona, described by critic James Agate as 'that sham Harrovian who bears upon his blazer the broad arrows of a blameful life' (Mosley, 116). In straw boater, wide grey flannel trousers (he claimed to have invented 'Oxford bags' at the London Coliseum in 1920), and 'Old Borstolian' blazer (blue, with white convict arrow on the breast pocket), and generally carrying notebook and rolled umbrella, he lectured his audience in deadpan tones on unlikely and esoteric themes peppered with literary, historical, and linguistic allusion. Though a classical education was needed fully to appreciate his act, it was widely popular: in 1930 he appeared in the royal variety performance, and the following year made his radio debut. 
At a time when the BBC was seeking new variety styles beyond the broad humour typical of inter-war music-hall, Potter's literate and allusive humour, with its echoes of 'Punch' and 'Beachcomber', was hailed as the radio comedy of the future. He was soon one of the most popular radio entertainers in Britain, one of the pioneer generation that included Leonard Henry, Mabel Constanduros, A. J. Alan, and Ronald Frankau. His celebrated opening catch-phrase, 'Good evening England. This is Gillie Potter speaking to you in English', signalled his principal themes of the English language and character. His act included at various times the adventures of 'my brother who was educated at Borstal', burlesques of 'society snippets', and parodies of 'Who's Who' entries. However, his fame rests chiefly on his chronicles of the mythical English village of Hogsnorton -- the name a typically arcane reference to the proverbial Oxfordshire village where 'pigs play on the organ' ('Brewer', 523) -- its noble but impoverished ancestral family, the Marshmallows of Hogsnorton Towers, and their disorderly world of inverted logic and improbable situations. Potter's combination of mock erudition, absurdity, and nostalgia struck a chord with inter-war audiences and made him a household name. When the BBC evacuated much of its staff to Wood Norton Hall, near Evesham, on the eve of the Second World War, its new base was known, inevitably, as Hogsnorton. 
Beyond the comedy routines the English language, history, and people were an abiding passion in Potter's life. He was an authority on heraldry, genealogy, and church history, a knight templar, a member of the Middle Temple and the Society of Genealogists, a vice-president of the Royal Society of St George and the Society of King Charles the Martyr, as well as for many years parish clerk of the church of St Botolph, Aldgate, London. His letters to 'The Times' from the 1930s to 1960s attest both to his eclectic scholarship (topics on which he offered his expertise ranged from the iconography of St Cuthbert to the heraldic derivations of the bunting celebrating the centenary of Waterloo Station) and his distaste for modern trends. He deplored the 'alien' pollution of the English comedic tradition by European and particularly American influences. Though he continued to broadcast throughout the Second World War, he felt increasingly out of sympathy with 'this era of Priestley and 'Penguins'' ('The Times', 10 Aug 1940). After the war, writing from what he termed 'unoccupied England', his targets included the adoption of the word 'university' by new scientific higher education institutions and the plans for the new Coventry Cathedral (a 'cross between a super-cinema and an abattoir'; 'The Times', 27 Nov 1951). His anger at what he considered the BBC's declining moral standards made him an unlikely spokesman for the Popular Television Association, which campaigned in the early 1950s for a commercial alternative to the BBC. He once considered standing for parliament as an independent on the platform of 'England for the English', with special reference to the theatre. 
Potter's style of comedy, and the attitudes that coloured it, were increasingly hard to accommodate in the post-war years. His love of language and eye for the absurd led to his being called the English Thurber, but his comedy lacked Thurber's humanism and seemed increasingly dated, particularly on stage. He retired from live performance, it was said, after a chastening experience at the London Palladium performing to an audience of young girls impatient for the headline act Danny Kaye ('The Guardian'). He was increasingly at odds with the BBC, partly because of his outspoken criticism of its output, partly because he resisted undertaking any broadcasting other than series, partly -- mostly, he believed -- because of his political views. He completed his last radio series, 'Mr Gillie Potter', in 1952, and the following year made his last broadcasts as a comedian, 'Coronation at Hogsnorton' for radio and 'A Little of What you Fancy' for television. 
Potter was married to Beatrice Fanny Scott; they had two children, a son (J. H. B. Peel, a 'Daily Telegraph' writer on country matters) and a daughter. In the early 1960s he retired to Bournemouth, occasionally appearing on talks programmes but refusing to speak to the press. His last broadcast appearance was in the panel game 'Sounds Familiar' in 1970. He died on 4 March 1975, aged eighty-seven, at Douglas House, 84 Southbourne Road, Bournemouth.

Westaway, Katharine Mary (1893-1973), classical scholar and headmistress, was born on 8 February 1893 at School House, 128 Chapel Street, Dalton in Furness, Lancashire, the only child of Frederick William Westaway, headmaster and HM inspector of schools, and his wife, Mary Jane, 'nee' Collar (1865-1947), formerly of Hammersmith, London. Frederick Westaway was a teacher, specializing in mathematics and science, and at the time of Kate Westaway's birth he was a headmaster in Dalton. Her mother was also a teacher before her marriage. The pedagogic tradition was strong on both sides of the family. 
By 1902 Frederick Westaway was a schools inspector in Bedford, where his daughter entered the high school, one of the two Harpur Trust girls' schools. As the only child of scholarly parents, Kate Westaway was close to both and the focus of attention particularly of her father, who coached her in mathematics. Fortunately, perhaps, she was an academically able child. Her early achievements included school exhibitions, honours in public examinations, and an open scholarship in classics to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1912. She was well liked at school and a keen supporter of school societies, although her only attempt at sport was to play tennis and suffer ignominious defeat in her time as head girl of the school. Her own account of this was humorous and self-deprecating and none of her considerable academic success appeared to make her either boastful or the object of envy. 
While at Cambridge Westaway studied for both the classical tripos (she was awarded a first in part two in 1915) and a London BA degree (1914, graduating MA in 1917). At Cambridge she entered fully into college life, becoming a well-liked president of the college debating society. Her sense of fun combined with a calm demeanour were to be lifetime characteristics. The war postponed a plan to study at Heidelberg and she began a course at the teacher training college at Cheltenham Ladies' College. She was quickly offered a teaching post in the school but by 1919 had been awarded the Marion Kennedy research fellowship at Newnham. She studied at Leiden and London, writing her thesis, 'The educational theory of Plutarch' (DLitt, London, 1921), which was published in 1922. In 1920 she was appointed lecturer in classics at Royal Holloway College and seemed set for an academic career of teaching and research. Then in 1924 the headship of Bedford high school fell vacant. With the encouragement of her father and Bedford friends she applied and was appointed to the post at the age of thirty-one. 
Westaway rapidly established herself with authority among both staff and pupils, despite the fact that some of the former had been her own teachers. Her aspirations as a scholar took second place to the educational, pedagogic, administrative, and social demands made upon the headmistress of a large, successful girls' school. She embarked on a highly successful scheme to provide new buildings for the school and to diversify the curriculum so as to cater for the less academically able girls. She developed facilities for teaching in science, built a new gymnasium and library, encouraged the teaching of domestic science, and introduced secretarial and pre-nursing courses for older girls. Meanwhile the school continued to send girls to Oxford, London, and Cambridge, and to other universities. She dealt firmly with staff, pupils, and governors alike while maintaining good relations and the respect of all. There was rejoicing when she refused appointment as head of Cheltenham Ladies' College in the mid-1930s. 
Nationally, Kate Westaway served on the executive committee of the Association of Headmistresses and as a member of the Burnham committee. She decided to retire in 1949 and moved to the Yorkshire dales with her lifelong companion, Eleanor Osborne. In retirement she served a ten-year stint as a Harpur Trust girls' schools governor. She returned to Bedford in the 1960s and died at Clapham Hospital, Clapham, Bedfordshire, on 16 June 1973. Her ashes were buried at Renhold church.

Ormsby, Hilda (1877-1973), geographer, was born on 1 November 1877 at 44 Charles Street, Hanley, Staffordshire, one of the large family of the Revd W. Rodwell Jones (1834-1914), a Welsh Wesleyan Methodist minister, and Sarah Ann Cuthbertson. There is no known record of her early life, but the family is known to have moved seven times by the time Hilda was twenty-one, owing to the peripatetic nature of the Methodist ministry. She took the certificate in geography at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in 1908-9 and was a teacher in England and France, studying at the Ecole Normale de Melun in France (probably 1909-11). There she studied mostly French and German languages, fitting a three-year course into two. She graduated BSc (Econ) in 1918 while assistant lecturer at the LSE and was one of the few geographers to proceed to the degree of DSc (Econ) (1931). 
Hilda Rodwell Jones initially came into contact with Halford Mackinder's work through his Saturday lectures for schoolteachers at the LSE, which she attended with her brother Llewellyn in 1911. She was appointed as demonstrator in geography at the LSE in 1912 and having been the mainstay of the geography department during the First World War was promoted lecturer in geography at the LSE in 1918, taking on responsibility for organizing the diploma and honours BSc (Econ) under Professor A. J. Sargent. In 1919 Llewellyn Rodwell Jones joined his sister in the LSE department, having previously been lecturer in geography at the University of Leeds and having completed distinguished war service. Theirs was a sister-brother partnership unique in United Kingdom geography departments, and included shared responsibility for some courses. In 1920 she became a recognized teacher in the University of London at the London School of Economics. In the same period ('five glorious weeks', according to Harrison Church; 'Geography', 423) she was promoted to lecturer in commerce with special reference to commercial geography, appointed assistant to Mackinder (replacing her brother), and on 26 June 1920 married George V. Ormsby (1885-1950), a fellow LSE student and Reuters journalist who went on to become chief of the London bureau of the 'Wall Street Journal'. Her key period of research and lecturing followed and she was subsequently promoted to reader in 1932. Her brother Llewellyn succeeded Mackinder as professor in 1925. 
Intellectually, Hilda was much influenced by Mackinder, and recounted how she had sat on the unfinished foundations of an LSE building while Mackinder read to her the manuscript of his 'Democratic Ideals and Reality' (1919). Mackinder's influence was explicitly acknowledged in her introduction to 'France' (1931) but his influence pervades her texts, with their great emphasis on the physical patterns and processes underlying patterns of human activity, the historical development of those patterns, and the need to use maps to understand the region being studied. Ormsby invariably worked as a regional geographer, producing 'London on the Thames' (1924) and 'France' (1931), drawing as much as possible on field observation (conducted independently or with the Le Play Society). However, although profound, Mackinder's influence was not undiluted. Hers was an approach to the region that bore the mark of her tutor Professor A. J. Sargent and the French geographer Vidal de la Blache as much as Mackinder. Vidal believed that the physical environment did not determine the character of a particular region but rather presented opportunities for the inhabitants and this approach characterized Ormsby's work as seen clearly in her opening sentences to 'France' (p. 3). 

'London on the Thames' is thought to be the first geographical text on London and one which was used as a basis for class and field study and was acclaimed for its original contour map of London. Both books were rich in maps and other illustration and were well received. 'France', organized around the geographical regions defined by drainage basins, was not always accessible to the general reader, but despite this, it remained Ormsby's abiding contribution which, although she described it as a stop gap at the time of publication, continued to be a standard undergraduate text into the 1960s and was still in print at the time of her death. Other European regional studies focused on issues of contemporary topical interest, notably her 'Mitteleuropa' (1935) which examined the concepts of central Europe, Deutschland, and Germany. Sadly the manuscript for a long-researched book on Germany was destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War. 
While remembered more for her tutorials and map classes than for clarity in lecturing style, Ormsby was a successful teacher and extremely competent departmental organizer. She gave memorable courses on Europe, inspired students to study France, and ran a celebrated seminar on London given in the late 1920s and early 1930s, enlivening lectures with her zest and sense of fun. Known as Dr O. or simply Hilda to staff and students alike, Ormsby earned 'high praise from those under whom she worked' ('Geography', 423) and was a lively conversationalist and hostess. She was an attractive woman, remembered for her generosity, vivacity, candour, and sometimes unconventional behaviour. 
Ormsby, along with her brother, was one of the thirteen founder members of the Institute of British Geographers formed in 1933 to meet the needs of the emerging community of academic geographers of Britain, at a time when the Royal Geographical Society was considered to be concerned primarily with exploration. Ormsby was the only woman in the founding group (although joined by eleven others within the year) and the first woman to serve on the council of the institute, as an ordinary member in 1936-8. In 1962, at the age of eighty-five, Ormsby was created an honorary fellow of both the London School of Economics and the Royal Geographical Society. 
Ormsby worked on maps for the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty during the First and Second World Wars and was deeply concerned that British soldiers in the First World War suffered at the hands of cartographers more concerned with aesthetics than accuracy. She and her husband also served as wardens in the air raid precaution service from the beginning of the battle of Britain onwards. 
After retiring, Ormsby lived at Water End, an Elizabethan cottage in Hertfordshire, which (like her London homes at Fetter Lane and Clifford's Inn before) became a meeting place for students. Her husband died in March 1950 and she outlived him by twenty-three years, dying on 23 October 1973 within a few days of her ninety-sixth birthday at a nursing home in Althorne, Essex. Her body was cremated on 30 October at Chelmsford. A student bursary at the LSE was endowed by Hilda and George Ormsby.

Melhuish, Sara (1861-1939), educationist, was born on 28 April 1861 at Oxton, Cheshire, the daughter of Charles Melhuish (died before 1891), general merchant, and his wife, Emily Martha Hull. Little is known of her early life until 1885, when she appeared as a day student at University College, Liverpool, residing in Birkenhead. She was an excellent student, earning a scholarship and a first-class honours degree in history in 1890 from the Victoria University, of which University College, Liverpool, was a constituent school. Upon graduation she received the Charles Beard fellowship, enabling her to remain at the college as an assistant to the professor of history from 1890 to 1891. She was granted an MA degree from the Victoria University in 1905. In 1891 she received a scholarship to attend Somerville College, Oxford, where, after only one year of reading, she received second-class honours in the second public examination of the school of modern history. 
Sara Melhuish had extremely varied experiences as a teacher. From 1892 to 1895 she remained at Somerville as a lecturer and tutor in history. From 1895 to 1900 she was principal of the Mount Vale School, a private school in York. For the next four years she served as head of College Hall, the residence for women students attached to University College, London. In order to improve her knowledge of pedagogy she spent a term at the Maria Grey Training College in London and acted as a supervisor of teaching practice at the London Day Training College. She also taught in a county council school in Essex and as an occasional teacher in elementary and continuation schools. During this period she earned the London postgraduate teacher's diploma. 
In 1907 Sara Melhuish returned to Liverpool, taking a post as lecturer in education and tutor to women students in the university's training college. She was responsible for the training of both elementary and secondary school teachers, for the organization and supervision of the practical work of all the women students and of some of the men students, and for lecturing on the history of education and principles of teaching. She also served as an examiner in education for the undergraduate degree and for the postgraduate diploma, and was a member of the faculty of arts, the training college board, the philosophy and education board, and other university committees. She even found time to teach a history form at Liverpool high school. Her colleagues praised her knowledge of the interrelationship of theory and practice, her familiarity with many types of schools, including elementary schools and their relationship with secondary schools, and her skill in maintaining relations with other university departments and with outside authorities such as heads of schools and local officials. 
In 1910 Sara Melhuish took a position as head of the training department at Bedford College, University of London. The Bedford College training department, which had been founded in 1891, was a leading centre for training women graduates to be secondary school teachers. Supported by Department of Education grants, the department reached its height during Melhuish's tenure, with sixty students and a staff of four specialists. Melhuish was appointed university reader in education in 1915. A colleague recalled the Oxford-educated Melhuish's high standards: 'Miss Melhuish demanded of the students under her a standard of academic and professional excellence to which not all could attain, but which gave to the department a quality of its own in keeping with its position as belonging to a school of the university. (Tuke, 260)' The training department, renamed the department of education in 1920, began to decline in the latter years of the First World War, and was closed for financial reasons in 1922, the year in which Melhuish retired. In 1930 she was appointed a governor of Bedford College. She died from a coronary thrombosis in German Street, Winchelsea, Sussex, on 23 October 1939 and was buried at Conduit Hill, Rye, Sussex, on 25 October. 
Sara Melhuish was a well-respected proponent and practitioner of teacher education, as was shown in 1920 by her being given the opportunity to visit 'People's High Schools and rural technical schools for girls and young women' in Denmark with the intention of possibly applying their methods to elementary schools in Britain. She was also something of a scholar, or at least an interpreter of historical scholarship. During the First World War she did part-time work in the historical section of the Foreign Office. She was the author of 'English History Illustrated from Original Sources from the Earliest Times' (1911), part of A. C. Black's 'School History' series, and was a contributor to the 'Victoria county history' on the ecclesiastical history of Lincolnshire.

Cooke, Alice Margaret (1867-1940), historian, was born at 24 Boston Street, Hulme, Lancashire, on 18 September 1867, the daughter of John Cooke, a cotton yarn agent, and his wife, Eliza Anderson Jackson. She attended a private school in Manchester and then, from 1883 to 1887, Manchester High School for Girls (Girls' Public Day School Trust), where she was first inspired to become a historian. A classmate remembered her as 'a hard worker, very earnest and conscientious, and already rather academic, with eyes set on her goal' (Horner and Haworth, 1). Because her parents did not want her to leave home, in 1887 she entered Victoria University of Manchester (Owens College), which had been open to women only since 1883. There she was an excellent student, earning the Bradford history scholarship in 1888 and a first-class honours degree in history in 1890. In that year she became the first woman to be awarded the Jones fellowship, the highest distinction in history conferred by the college. The fellowship enabled her to pursue her love of medieval history, leading to the publication of 'The settlement of the Cistercians in England' in the 'English Historical Review' (1893), which was for long the standard account of these early monastic foundations. 
In 1893 Cooke received the MA degree, the first to be awarded to a woman at Owens College, and became the first woman to be appointed a lecturer there. She was one of the first women appointed to a university-level academic post in Britain. At that time, provision for women students at Owens College was limited. As well as teaching she served as assistant tutor to women students from 1897 to 1901; in this capacity she raised money for a new women's union and was one of the founders and joint honorary secretary of Ashburne Hall, the first hall of residence for women at Owens, and she served as chairman of the women's athletic union. In 1897 she was elected a member of the court of governors of Victoria University. She lectured for university extension, supported the Manchester University settlement, and worked for the cause of women's suffrage. Furthermore, during this period she was invited by her friend Mrs Rylands to compile a catalogue of Earl Spencer's Althorp Library, which became the nucleus of the John Rylands Library, University of Manchester. She was also fond of cycling and travel. 
From 1901 to 1903 Cooke was lecturer in history and head of the Aberdare hall of residence for women students at the University of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff. In 1903 she became the first woman entrusted with librarian's work at the Cambridge University Library, where she was invited to catalogue Lord Acton's library, a historical collection of 60,000 to 70,000 volumes. In Cambridge she lived on Clare Road near Newnham College, where she taught modern history from 1905 to 1907. 
In 1907 Alice Cooke was appointed lecturer in history at Leeds University, where she was chosen over the young F. M. Powicke, later regius professor of modern history at Oxford. At Leeds, where she was appointed reader in 1919, she established the department of medieval history and played an important role in strengthening the library's medieval collections. During the First World War she patrolled the streets of Leeds by night as a policewoman, which may have contributed to a breakdown in her health in 1920. 
After two years recuperating at home in Manchester, Cooke returned to Cambridge as director of studies in history at Newnham College, where she remained until her retirement in 1927. After her retirement she lived in Cambridge with Lena Ward, the daughter of her old friend Sir Adolphus Ward. Cooke was fond of Cambridge, but her health remained poor, and in 1934 she became a complete invalid after an accident. She was able to retire to Manchester, where, although not a Roman Catholic herself, she was taken in by a community of Catholic nuns, who cared for her until her death, at St Joseph's Hospital, Carlton Road, Whalley Range, Manchester, on 26 January 1940. 
Because of her teaching responsibilities and poor health, Alice Cooke was not able to devote as much time to historical research as she might have wished. Nevertheless, as well as her seminal article on the Cistercians, she wrote forty articles on medieval history, beginning with the letter N, for the 'Dictionary of National Biography', and made several indexes to the 'Cambridge Modern History'. In 1901 the Chetham Society published her edition of the manuscript 'Visitationes B.M.V. de Whalley'. While at Leeds she was commissioned to write the chapter on monasticism for the 'Cambridge Medieval History', but was unable to complete it because of illness; it was eventually published as 'A study in twelfth century religious revival and reform' in the 'John Rylands Library Bulletin' (January 1925). After a trip to Assisi in 1909 Alice Cooke had become fascinated by St Francis, and published 'St. Francis of Assisi' in the 'Church Quarterly Review' in October 1929. Her greatest contribution, however, was probably as a pioneer in women's education in her native Manchester and as a teacher. A former student at Leeds University recalled that Alice Cooke had 'acquired something of the saintliness and humility and the sublime joy of the early Franciscans, and was able to communicate a measure of this to her pupils' (Horner, 43).

Murphy, John Thomas (1888-1965), political activist, was born at 235 Gorton Lane, Gorton, Manchester, on 9 December 1888, the son of John Murphy, a blacksmith's striker in an iron foundry, and Sarah Pratt. His father was an Irish Catholic and his mother an English Baptist; Murphy himself was a Primitive Methodist in his teens. He left Wincobank council school, Sheffield, at the age of thirteen to take up an apprenticeship at Vickers' Brightside engineering works in Sheffield, where he became a lathe turner. His studious capabilities were turned away from trying to enter the civil service towards reading revolutionary literature, and he became a militant shop steward highly influenced by syndicalist ideas. During the First World War, after leading a remarkably successful illegal strike by 12,000 Sheffield workers, Murphy encouraged the co-ordination of stewards' organization across the city's munitions factories into a Sheffield Workers' Committee. By 1917 he had become a recognized leader of the national Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committee movement, which had sprung up within the engineering industry. 
J. T. Murphy was a prolific writer in 'Solidarity', the paper of the wartime stewards' movement, and his pamphlet 'The Workers' Committee' (1917), became the chief theoretical statement to emerge from the movement. The pamphlet, which developed and expounded the novel theory of independent rank-and-file organization capable of fighting independently of the union leadership wherever necessary, represented an important development on the strategy of pre-war syndicalism. After the war Murphy, profoundly influenced by the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, helped to draw out the full revolutionary implications of the stewards' militant wartime activities, and conceived the workers' committees as embryonic soviets, the institutional form through which the working class could take control of society. 
Murphy subsequently made a significant contribution to the formation and early development of British communism. After joining the syndicalist-inclined Socialist Labour Party (SLP) in 1917, he stood as an SLP parliamentary candidate in the general election of 1918, and then helped forge negotiations for the merger of the various small Marxist groups into a united British Communist Party. In 1920 he went as a shop stewards' delegate to the Second Congress of the Communist International in Moscow, where he completely embraced the Bolshevik notion of a revolutionary party capable of leading the working class to power. His abilities were soon recognized by the Russian leaders and, after helping to launch the Red International of Labour Unions, he became a member of the presidium of the executive committee of the Communist International based in Moscow between 1926 and 1928 (during which he was given the 'honour' of moving Trotsky's expulsion from the Comintern). On 18 January 1921 he married Ethel (Molly) Morris (1890-1964), who was a full-time organizer of the Women's Social and Political Union in Sheffield and later a nurse for the wounded Spanish republican soldiers on the civil war battlefront around Madrid. They had one son. 
During the 1920s and early 1930s Murphy also served as a leading full-time central committee member of the British Communist Party, with responsibility for the party's industrial activities, and as editor of 'Communist Review'. One of the most gifted of his generation of self-educated intellectuals within the leadership of British communism, Murphy made a distinctive theoretical contribution to a number of controversial trade union and political debates in a series of articles for various journals. However, his loyal and unquestioning attachment to the defence of the USSR and the rising Stalinist bureaucracy was to affect profoundly his independent political judgement and distort his revolutionary socialist politics. It led him to support every twist and turn of Stalinist policy inside Britain, including in the late 1920s the adoption of an ultra-left stance, denouncing the Labour Party as 'social fascist'. Ironically, in 1932 Murphy was expelled (after his resignation was ruled 'impermissible') from the Communist Party over his support for a campaign for trade credits to be granted to the USSR, and he became a strong critic of the organization he had helped to construct. After a spell as the general secretary of the Socialist League, a left-wing ginger group inside the Labour Party, he went on to campaign for a 'people's front' alliance against the threat posed by Nazi Germany and in support of the allied effort during the Second World War. 
J. T. Murphy died at his home, 4 Broughton Gardens, Highgate, London, of a cerebral haemorrhage on 13 May 1965. His reflections on the crucial period in the history of the British working-class movement in which he played such a prominent role were recorded in 'Preparing for Power' (1934) and in his autobiography, 'New Horizons' (1941).

Berkenhead, William (bap. 1648, d. 1701), Jacobite spy, was apparently born at Northwich in Cheshire and baptized there in Witton Chapel on 3 April 1648. His parents were Randolph Berkenhead, the earl of Derby's bailiff in Northwich, and his wife, Elizabeth Harcourt, one of the Harcourts of Wincham, near Northwich. His uncle was Sir John Birkenhead. The family were royalists and prospered after the Restoration. In February 1676 Berkenhead was given a job in the customs, first as a landwaiter at Southampton and then, in February 1688, as surveyor at Dover. While at Southampton he married, about 1678, Frances Harwood. They had four children, only one of whom, Elizabeth, survived into adulthood. Frances herself is reported as having been dead 'some years' by 1696 ('Memoirs of... Ailesbury', 2.396). 
After the revolution of 1688 Berkenhead, though protestant, remained loyal to James II and used his position at Dover to help the first Jacobites cross secretly to France. He was caught and dismissed in May 1690 but the earl of Ailesbury then gave him the more important task of handling Jacobite correspondence with St Germain and establishing a route by which Jacobite messages and travellers could pass safely between London and the continent. A farm on Romney Marsh in Kent, tenanted by James Hunt, was the main staging post on the route. From the end of 1692 Berkenhead was continually ranging over the English section of the route, conveying letters and escorting important Jacobite travellers. From about the same time he also worked for the French as a naval spy, receiving his instructions direct from navy minister Pontchartrain. 
Three or four times a year Berkenhead visited St Germain, either on escort or courier duty or for consultations with his superiors at the exiled court. He met James, the deposed king, and his queen, Mary of Modena, on many occasions and was well known to Lord Melfort and his secretary David Nairne. When William III's Queen Mary died in December 1694 it was Berkenhead who conveyed the news to St Germain. Having served as captain of a troop of the Southampton trained band, Berkenhead was usually called Captain Berkenhead. He also had several aliases. The earliest was South, corresponding to Melfort's North. Afterwards he used East, West, Baker, and Fish, and latterly, from mid-1695 on, Steel. For his services St Germain paid him an annual salary of $100 plus expenses. 
Over the winter of 1695-6 when a combined English Jacobite rising and French invasion was being planned, Berkenhead's charges included Sir George Barclay, whom James II had commissioned to raise the Jacobites, and the duke of Berwick, James II's illegitimate son, who came over to encourage the rebels. Barclay was also plotting to assassinate William III. During the crackdown following the discovery of this plot Berkenhead was arrested and imprisoned in Newgate in April 1696. He escaped at the end of August after inviting the keeper to supper and drugging his wine. Having made his way via the Romney Marsh farm to France, he returned with French sailors the next day, Saturday 30 October, and kidnapped Farmer Hunt, who had turned anti-Jacobite informer. 
In France James rewarded the now-exiled Berkenhead by appointing him his clerk of the kitchen in February 1697. In April 1701 Berkenhead was accompanying James and Mary to the spa town of Bourbon-Lancy when he was taken ill at Montargis. Having been put to bed in the royal castle, he converted to Roman Catholicism and died shortly after, on 14 April 1701 NS; he was buried in the chapel of the town cemetery the following day.

Clark, Hugh (1745-1822), heraldic engraver, was born on 17 March 1745 and baptized on 31 March 1745 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, the son of Hugh Clark, cordwainer, and Grisseld Matheson. On 11 June 1760 he was apprenticed to Thomas Orpin, a goldsmith in the Strand, for a term of seven years; a premium of $3, much less than for Orpin's other apprentices, was paid by the trustees of the charity school near Hungerford Market, Charing Cross. He completed his apprenticeship on 13 April 1768. Subsequently he lived for most of his life in Soho, much of it in Rupert Street and Princes Street, now the southern part of Wardour Street. Despite the migration of the aristocracy in the middle years of the eighteenth century, particularly to Mayfair, Soho continued to be fashionable, attracting many highly skilled craftsmen such as Clark. 
In 1775 Clark and Thomas Wormull, also a heraldic engraver, jointly edited 'A Short and Easy Introduction to Heraldry'. It was a small pocket-sized booklet of some fifty-five pages, consisting mainly of twelve plates and a glossary. The preface, the only text apart from the glossary, stated: 'The following work was first designed to instruct a few private Persons, who, by its short and easy Method, gained a knowledge of the Science'. Unlike other heraldry books of the period it was not aimed at the nobility. Of Clark's 217 subscribers all but three lived in London or its environs, only three were titled, and a significant proportion lived in, or close to, Soho. This appears to be the first book on heraldry compiled specifically for middle-class readers with little or no knowledge of the subject. George Kearsley, an enterprising London bookseller, saw the potential of the book and published an enlarged edition in the following year; three further editions followed in quick succession. Much of the credit for this success must go to Kearsley, who had had similar successes with other books, particularly travel guides. In 1778 Clark and Wormull produced 'The Arms of the Nobility of England, Scotland and Ireland', which was also published by Kearsley, and in the following year their 'Peerage of the Nobility of England, Scotland and Ireland' was published in Dublin. Clark, encouraged by the success of the earlier works, compiled 'A Concise History of Knighthood' (2 vols., 1784). This work, not published by Kearsley, appears to have been less successful; Moule stated that 'The 82 plates of the Stars and Badges are not to be depended upon, particularly those of the Foreign Orders' (T. Moule, 'Bibliotheca Heraldica Magnae Britanniae', 1822, 450). 
Clark died aged seventy-seven in Haymarket, London, in May 1822 and was buried on 26 May, probably in the burial-ground of St James, Piccadilly, on the Hampstead Road. He had been the sole author of the eighth (1812) and ninth (1818) editions of the 'Short and Easy Introduction to Heraldry', which continued to prosper during the nineteenth century; a further nine editions were published after his death. 'It was', wrote J. R. Planche, Somerset herald, 'one of the earliest and handiest little books published on the subject in a popular form' ('The Recollections and Reflections of J. R. Planche', 2 vols., 1872, 2.249). However, in basing it on the work of others Clark and his successors had perpetuated incorrect information and myths. In 1866 Planche prepared a revised, eighteenth edition, in which 'exploded theories [were] omitted and erroneous opinions corrected' (ibid., 2.250). This edition was reprinted seven times, the last in 1910. A facsimile of the eighteenth edition was published in 1974.

Piggott, Sir Francis Taylor (1852-1925), jurist and writer, was born on 25 April 1852 at 31 Lower Belgrave Street, London, the son of the Revd Francis Allen Piggott (died 1871) of Worthing; his mother, Mary Frances Errebess, daughter of Dr John Hollamby Taylor, died at the time of his birth. He was educated in Paris, at Worthing College, and at Trinity College, Cambridge (MA, LLM), and was called to the bar (Middle Temple) in 1874. In 1881 he married Mabel Waldron ('b'. 1854x7, died 1949), eldest daughter of Jasper Wilson Johns MP, and founder of the Colonial Nursing Association; they had two sons, Francis Stewart Gilderoy and Julian Ito. Piggott practised for a while at the bar and wrote legal texts, but he aspired to an official position and, after 'ad hoc' involvement in Foreign Office initiatives concerning the recognition and enforcement of foreign and colonial judgments, he was appointed in 1887 to a three-year term as constitutional adviser to the Japanese prime minister Hirobumi Ito. In 1893 he was secretary to the attorney-general, Sir Charles Russell, for the Bering Sea arbitration, and later that year he accepted the post of procureur- and advocate-general of Mauritius. It is for his turbulent career as chief justice of Hong Kong (1905-12), however, that Piggott is best known. In 1905 Piggott received a knighthood. 
Piggott had a natural capacity, it seems, to provoke the administrative branch of government almost beyond endurance. The first Hong Kong governor with whom he worked, Sir Matthew Nathan, liked him well enough at first, but by the time Nathan left the colony the two were not on speaking terms. Nathan's successor, Sir Frederick Lugard, stated in 1907 that Piggott was a bugbear 'at war with Govt'. 'The C.J. is like all C.J.s, I [hadn't] been here a week before I got letters about 'ignoring the position and dignity of the Bench', and so on, and since then he has shot me in a series of letters raking up every conceivable grievance. He is socially very affable (not to say garrulous) with a constant cackle laugh which gets on your nerves. He considers himself No. 1, A1, especially at Bridge, which he does not play too well. I think I can deal with 'him'. (Lugard MSS)' But Lugard, whose wife Lady Flora described Piggott as 'a most cantankerous and universally detested person' (ibid.), had frequent disputes with his chief justice and did not always gain the upper hand. 
Piggott was genial but tactless, pompous but lacking in dignity, learned but inaccurate, industrious yet impecunious, and admired by a few while reviled by many. His record as a judge is sound, though he failed as a judicial administrator and there were many allegations of his partiality on the bench. Eventually he was required to retire soon after reaching the age of sixty. This was a rude shock to him, even though an amendment, known colloquially as 'the Piggott Relief Ordinance', had been made to the local pensions legislation precisely to facilitate his removal. He was chronically short of money; indeed in 1922 he was adjudged bankrupt, with creditors in Hong Kong alone owed $15,000. On losing his Hong Kong post he sought employment in Peking (Beijing), but the Foreign Office advised the Chinese government not to appoint him. His return to Hong Kong to practise at the private bar was considered almost scandalous, and when he left for England in 1914 his passage was paid for out of the vote for the relief of destitutes. 
Piggott was a cultured man who published two novels (under the name Hope Dawlish) and a 'musical playlet', wrote books and articles on Japanese arts, and exhibited his paintings in London. His legal writings included more than a dozen major books and several articles. His intention in retirement was to produce a series of historical and legal works on the law of the sea. The 'Times' obituary, on his death on 12 March 1925 at his home, 33 Thurloe Square, London, referred to 'his energy, enthusiasm, and cultured mind' which: 'did much to stimulate the study of international law in days when it needs to be studied more severely than ever, and it may well be that, in the perspective that finally tests the authority of jurists, his labours will secure a permanent place. ('The Times', 13 March 1925)' Piggott's legal tomes, however, are now largely forgotten. He was a capable lawyer, though often accused of carelessness, and his books on international law were marred by an inappropriate patriotism; his disputes with officialdom were based on principled positions strongly argued. His faults of temperament were his great weakness, so far as the Colonial Office was concerned, and they largely subverted his judicial career. Yet the Law Society of Hong Kong presented him with an address in farewell which expressed warm appreciation of 'the patience and forbearance, courtesy and consideration, consistently displayed by you during your tenure of the office of Chief Justice' (private information). It may be that he was too aggressively independent to win the admiration of colonial officials, and that is not a bad recommendation for a colonial judge.

Smith, Walter Parry Haskett (1859-1946), rock climber, was born at Bognor, Sussex, on 28 August 1859, the second son of Haskett Smith (1813-1895), of Trowswell, Goudhurst, Kent, landowner and farmer, and his wife, Anne, 'nee' Davies, formerly Britten (1819-1893). He was educated at Eton College, where he enjoyed a reputation as both an athlete and a scholar of some promise, and read classics at Trinity College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship, graduating in 1882 with a third-class degree, an athletics blue, and the unofficial long-jump record (25.5 feet). He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1885, but appears never to have practised. Instead he relied on his private income to facilitate a life of travel and scholarly inquiry. 
While still at Oxford, Haskett Smith visited first Snowdonia (in 1880) and then the Lake District (in 1881) as a member of reading parties. 'For eight hours in every day we absorbed Aristotle and Plato; for six or seven we scoured the surrounding fells' ('Climbing in Cumberland', 'Alpine Journal', 16, 1892, 143). At Wasdale Head in 1881 he encountered the barrister and fellow of Trinity F. H. Bowring (1823-1917), who introduced him to some exciting scrambles, and in 1882 Haskett Smith returned with his younger brother Edmund to put up first ascents of routes on Pillar Rock above Ennerdale and Deep Ghyll on Scafell, among others. 
At the time most British mountains were climbed by the route of least resistance: few sought out difficulty for its own sake. Some budding alpinists sought to hone their skills on snow and ice at home before putting them into practice in Switzerland, but the possibilities of climbing on rock were barely comprehended. Haskett Smith, in making solo ascents, and shunning the use of a rope (which he, in his early years, decried as 'illegitimate'), was setting out on a different trajectory altogether. He devoted himself to domestic opportunities, and only after having revolutionized the profile of British rock climbing did he invest time and energy in more conventional alpinism (joining the Alpine Club in 1890). Initially there was some friction between more established alpinists such as William Cecil Slingsby and this remarkable 'outsider', but cordial relationships were swiftly established and the pair went on frequently to climb together. 
In 1883 Haskett Smith walked with the great pioneer Charles Packe (1826-1896) in the Pyrenees, but in 1884 he was back in the Lakes, making the acquaintance of another local mountaineer, J. W. Robinson (1853-1907). He and Robinson reconnoitred Napes Needle, a remarkably iconic 70 foot rock spire ('the Dent du Geant of the Lake district;' 'Pall Mall Budget', 5 June 1890) at the foot of Needle Ridge on Great Gable. 
On 27 June 1886, snatching a few days in Cumberland between visits to Skye, Haskett Smith made a solo ascent of Napes Needle. By the end of the decade the Needle was being regularly climbed, and sketches and photographs of men and women atop this seemingly perilous pinnacle began to appear in the popular press. Napes Needle was not a summit, but it was a distinct challenge, and others followed Haskett Smith in seeking out similar tests of their athleticism and nerve. The sport of rock climbing, as distinct from mountaineering, had been launched. 
Haskett Smith went on to make further first ascents, his 1891 north climb on Pillar (a route of 320 feet in length), his last great achievement, involving crawling over apparently unstable blocks of stone 'like a fly on sugar' ('Black and White', 4 June 1892). In the main his accomplishments as a climber were swiftly surpassed by younger men, who prized balance above sheer physical strength. He largely climbed gully routes and ridges, rather than the faces that would attract later cohorts of climbers. 'He climbed for fun and his passion stopped well this side of obsession' (Hankinson, 98). 
Haskett Smith's second major contribution to the development of British rock climbing was the publication of his 'Climbing in the British Isles' (two vols., 1894, 1895). These were the first guidebooks to the climbing landscapes of Britain, and although a third volume proposing to deal with Scotland was never written they paved the way for other authors' more substantial volumes dealing with the Lake District and Snowdonia. Previously information had to be sought in books kept at the hotels favoured by climbers, or passed on by word of mouth. Haskett Smith enlisted the assistance of Albert Frederick Mummery for information on chalk cliffs, and the inclusion of such, alongside passages detailing the opportunities to be found on the Cornish coast, or down pot-holes, indicated that climbing was not to be restricted to Britain's mountain districts. The Irish section of the second volume was written by the Dublin botanist H. C. Hart (1847-1908) while some of the research for material on Wales was carried out in the company of Owen Glynne Jones. 
The volumes were both inspirational and idiosyncratic. Geoffrey Winthrop Young wrote that 'they were to many of us the first notice that such a domestic fairyland existed' (Young, 113). Taking the form of an alphabetical list they jumbled geographical information on crags and climbing technique alongside etymological, folkloristic, and historical discursions and grisly depictions of fatalities suffered by unwary visitors to the high fells. Haskett Smith's voracious appetite for knowledge and his somewhat unruly personality shone through, his descriptions leavened by wry humour. Bear Rock on Great Gable, he wrote, 'was gravely attacked [in 1889] by a large party comprising some five or six of the strongest climbers in England. It is a little difficult to find, especially in seasons when the grass is at all long' ('Climbing in the British Isles', 1.6). Although they occupy an honoured place in climbing history the volumes' sales were modest. 
Haskett Smith served as president of the Climbers' Club (1901-3) and of the Fell and Rock Climbing Club (1913-17), and twice served terms on the committee of the Alpine Club. He travelled widely, climbing and walking in Scotland, Wales, the Pyrenees, the Alps, Norway, Canada, north Africa, Greece, the Balkans, the West Indies, and the Andes. He published a number of articles (mainly of reminiscence) in the 'Fell and Rock Climbing Club Journal', and warm obituaries of his friends in the 'Alpine Journal'. 
Haskett Smith's range of interests were far wider than rock climbing alone. He was a keen philologist, genealogist, amateur archaeologist, and antiquarian. As a liveryman of the Fishmongers' Company he rose to become prime warden (1915-16) and produced (in 1916) 'Lists of Apprentices and Freemen' [of the company] 'in 1537 and 1600-50'. Although he rarely returned to the Lakes after the First World War he remained a keen, often eccentrically dressed, rambler of the home counties. 
Haskett Smith's fitness was proven for a final time when, in 1936, at the age of seventy-six, and in front of 300 members of the Fell and Rock Climbing Club, he made a 'jubilee' ascent of Napes Needle to mark the fiftieth anniversary of his original solo climb, having the previous day climbed Pillar Rock. 
Shortly after this episode Haskett Smith's strength began to fail and his health deteriorated. Never having married, he shared a flat in Kensington for many years with his sister, but bomb damage during the Second World War forced him to move to Parkstone in Dorset, where he lived with one of his brothers. He died at the Duncliffe nursing home, Parkstone, Poole, on 11 March 1946. 
Haskett Smith was strongly individualistic. To Young his appearance (balding, with long moustaches) was 'not unlike that of some Chinese philosopher -- of exceptional physique' ('Alpine Journal', 1946, 417). A widely read man who rarely stopped talking when in the hills or even on the rocks, he is primary claimant to the title of 'the Father of British rock-climbing' (Kelly and Doughty, 28).

FitzGerald, Edward Arthur (1871-1931), mountaineer, was born on 10 May 1871 at Litchfield, Connecticut, USA, the third son of William John FitzGerald, barrister, a British subject, and Mary, daughter of Eli White, of New York. He was educated at St Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1890 but did not graduate. In 1892 he married Jeanne Marie, daughter of Baron de Rothiacob of Rouen, France; she died the next year. In 1894 he joined part of William Martin Conway's walk across the Alps and met Mattias Zurbriggen ['see below'], whom he hired as a guide for five years. In 1894-5 he travelled with Zurbriggen to New Zealand, intending to climb Mount Cook, its highest peak, but local climbers reached the summit at Christmas, just after their arrival. Together FitzGerald and Zurbriggen made the first ascent of Mount Sefton, and, with Jack Clarke, one of the New Zealanders who climbed Mount Cook, first ascents of mounts Sealy, Silberhorn, Tasman, and Haidinger. Zurbriggen made a solo ascent of Mount Cook because FitzGerald only wanted to make first ascents. New Zealanders respected Zurbriggen's climbing, but resented FitzGerald's conceited and haughty attitude. FitzGerald exaggerated his achievements in a paper delivered to the Royal Geographical Society, 'The first crossing of the Southern Alps in New Zealand', and in 'Climbs in the New Zealand Alps' (1896), which erased Clark's image from a photograph of the Mount Haidinger summit. 
FitzGerald was very wealthy and best known for his large, personally financed expedition to South America in 1896-7. He took a geologist, surveyor, engineer, and naturalist to make scientific surveys, and six alpine guides led by Zurbriggen. FitzGerald made several unsuccessful attempts before Zurbriggen went on alone to make the first ascent of Aconcagua (22,835 feet), the highest peak in the Americas. FitzGerald later suffered from typhoid fever, which delayed the publication of his 'The Highest Andes' (1899). 
In 1900 FitzGerald joined the imperial yeomanry to fight in the South African War, where he received a commission as second lieutenant in the 5th dragoon guards, and first lieutenant in 1901. He was later transferred to the Inniskilling dragoons, and was promoted captain in 1906, and major in 1912. He was employed in the War Office from 1914 to 1919. In 1903 he stopped climbing after an accident in Zermatt and married, at Hampstead register office, Menie Muriel Dowie (1866-1945), traveller and author, daughter of Muir Dowie, and formerly wife of Henry Norman (1858-1939), who had divorced her after discovering that she had committed adultery with FitzGerald. They lived at 38 Green Street, Park Lane, London, and Marsden Manor, Rendcombe, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, where FitzGerald died on 2 January 1931. 

Mattias Zurbriggen (1856-1917), alpine guide, was born on 15 May 1856 at Saas Fee, Switzerland, the son of Lorenz Zurbriggen (died 1864), shoemaker and miner, and Veronica del Prato (died 1890) of Stalden. After his father's death, he worked at a variety of jobs before becoming a mountain guide in Macugnaga, Italy. On 29 September 1885 he married Maria Orsola Schranz (died 1912). On 28 February 1886, they had a daughter, Maria Margherita, who lived only a few hours, and on 25 August 1889 a son, Mattia Lorenzo, who emigrated to the United States about 1909. Mattias attracted the attention of ambitious British climbers, including Oscar Eckenstein, T. Fisher Unwin, and William Martin Conway, who invited him to the Karakoram in 1892. His partnership with Edward FitzGerald culminated in his first ascent of Aconcagua -- alone -- on 14 January 1897. In later years, he led Fanny Bullock Workman (1859-1925) in the Karakoram, Prince Scipio Borghese (1871-1927), and Professor Guilio Brocherel in the Celestial Mountains of Tien Shan (Tianshan), and Julius Kugy (1858-1944) in the Alps. His autobiography, 'From the Alps to the Andes' (1899), was the first published by an alpine guide, but his British patrons edited out the exuberance, extravagance, and passion for which he was known. After his return from Argentina, he began drinking excessively. Zurbriggen later left his wife in desolation, and moved to Geneva, where he worked for some years in the kitchen of an inn located on rue Blanvalet in the Eaux-Vives section. He committed suicide by hanging himself, and was found dead on 20 June 1917.

Caryll, Ivan (1861-1921), composer and music director, was born on 12 May 1861 in Liege, Belgium, the son of Henry Tilkin, an engineer. He was educated at the Paris Conservatoire and settled in Britain in the mid-1880s. His earliest days in London were spent largely in musical hack work and teaching, and although he had a comic opera, 'The Lily of Leoville', produced in London as early as 1886, it was as a conductor that he made his first noticeable mark in the musical theatre. When Henry J. Leslie bought the Gaiety Theatre production of 'Dorothy' and transferred it to the Prince of Wales, the Gaiety's music director, Meyer Lutz, remained at his own theatre, and Caryll was appointed conductor for the revamped show which was to become the musical-theatre hit of the era. He remained Leslie's music director through the four years and three shows of the producer's dramatic career, shifting with him to his new Lyric Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue, where 'Doris' and 'The Red Hussar' were produced, and staying there, when Leslie's operation went under, as music director for the theatre's new manager, Horace Sedger. 
Caryll subsequently supplied part-scores for local adaptations of several French musicals and completed the score for the late Alfred Cellier's 'The Mountebanks', before he got the opportunity to write the complete music for the latter-day burlesque 'Little Christopher Columbus', built around the under-voiced American starlet May Yohe and backed by her lordly lover, Francis Hope. It featured two songs -- the 'coon' song 'Oh Honey, my Honey' and the ballad 'Lazily, Drowsily' -- which took Caryll straight to the fore of the musical-theatre profession. 
The young musician was soon snapped up by the watchful George Edwardes for the Gaiety Theatre, where he remained as music director for fifteen years, supplying the music for all the great hits of that theatre's most prosperous period, from 'The Shop Girl' (1894) through to 'Our Miss Gibbs' (1909). Under Edwardes's aegis a writing partnership between Caryll and Lionel Monckton (1861-1924) evolved, beginning with Monckton as the subsidiary 'additional songs' member, but later on equal terms, with both turning out much of the best of the light theatre music on the London stage in its most successful Victorian and Edwardian years. 
Caryll did not confine himself in those years to writing for the Gaiety. In the early years of the new century he turned out a bevy of scores, both in the musical-comedy style, notably the charming 'The Girl from Kay's' (1902), and in the light opera vein, with 'The Duchess of Dantzic', a score which echoed the most attractive tones of French 'opera comique'. 'The Earl and the Girl', written with Seymour Hicks and staged with the remnants of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, was another of Caryll's notable successes in this period. At Christmas 1903 he had the then unparalleled distinction of having five musicals running at the same time in the West End of London. 
In 1910, with 'Our Miss Gibbs' still giving him one of the greatest successes of his career, Caryll left Britain for America, where he combined with the American librettist C. M. S. McLellan on a series of musicals based, like 'The Girl from Kay's', on French plays. Their second Broadway venture, 'The Pink Lady', in particular, proved as great a success as his English shows, and while, in the wake of 'The Merry Widow', everything that was singable in Vienna was making its way to America, 'The Pink Lady' unusually made the reverse trip, to play London, Paris, and Budapest. This series of shows based on French farces, of which 'Oh! Oh! Delphine' and 'The Girl behind the Gun' (known in Britain as 'Kissing Time') were the other prime examples, helped largely to set the fashion for modern 'musical comedy' on the American stage. 
Throughout his career Caryll maintained close links with the European theatre. A considerable number of his musicals got showings in Paris, Vienna, and Budapest at a time when the product of the English-language stage was largely ignored on the continent, and he composed original scores both for Paris ('S.A.R.', or 'Son altesse royale', 1908) and for Vienna ('Die Reise nach Cuba', 1901). 
Caryll's career encompassed three eras of the musical theatre, and he seemed to be equally happy in each of them. If his first great successes were made in the light musical-comedy area, epitomized by the Gaiety Theatre shows, he proved with scores as divergent as the operettic 'The Duchess of Dantzic' and 'S.A.R.', on the one hand, and the post-war 'The Girl behind the Gun', with its modern fox-trot and one-step rhythms, on the other, that he was a theatre composer who (unlike his contemporaries Lionel Monckton and Sidney Jones) could and would move with times and musical styles. His scores for 'The Pink Lady' and 'Oh! Oh! Delphine' contain numbers which equal the best that both the Viennese waltz masters and the new wave of American dance- and songwriters were producing in the years around the First World War. Unlike so many of those who followed him, he was as capable of turning out a complicated finale or concerted number as a catchy point number or comedy song but, largely because so much of his work was written for a kind of show which was by its nature ephemeral, few of his songs have survived as standards. Caryll was married for a period to the American singer (Annie) Geraldine Ulmar (1862-1932) and later to another musical-comedy performer, Maud Hill. He died in the Ambassador's Hotel, New York, on 29 November 1921.

Rubens, Paul Alfred (1875-1917), musical comedy writer and songwriter, was born at 11 Dawson Place, Kensington, London, on 29 April 1875, the eldest son of Victor Rubens, a wealthy Berlin-born Jewish stockbroker, and his wife, Jenny, 'nee' Wallach. He was educated at Winchester College and studied law at University College, Oxford (1895-7), where he took part enthusiastically in university dramatics. Although he had no formal musical training, he also began writing songs in Oxford, among them a set for a stage production of 'Alice in Wonderland' in which Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) took a hand. He was still only nineteen when his song 'The Little Chinchilla' was accepted by the era's most important musical-theatre producer, George Edwardes, and introduced into the hit musical play 'The Shop Girl' at the Gaiety Theatre. 
In the years that followed Rubens contributed individual songs to a number of West End musical comedies and burlesques, but his breakthrough came when he was hired by the producer Tom Davis to provide additional numbers to Leslie Stuart's score for 'Florodora' (1899). The bright, tunefully simple songs that Rubens wrote for, in particular, the show's 'soubrette', Ada Reeve ('Inkling', 'Tact', 'When I leave town'), won him his spurs, and he was swiftly put under contract by Edwardes as a supplier of supplementary songs for his productions. 
Edwardes gave the young songwriter a bigger opportunity to demonstrate his talents when he mounted 'Three Little Maids' (1902), a lightweight piece of musical theatre for which Rubens had written the book, the music (with Howard Talbot), and the lyrics. 'Three Little Maids', 'alternately music-hally, pretty, pale, mildly suggestive, and also successful' (Ganzl, 'Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre', 2.1252), went on to be played around the English-singing world. It was followed by the similarly built 'Lady Madcap' (1904) before Rubens surprised everyone by coming up with a work far in advance of his two recent hits in substance and quality. 'Mr Popple of Ippleton' was a genuine musical comedy in the style of the French vaudeville, with a farcical and funny story and some charming and gently amusing songs which mostly avoided the rather schoolboy-naughty tone too often found in Rubens's lyrics. George P. Huntley and Ethel Irving created the lead roles of the winning tale of a country mouse (male) in the wicked city, and the piece did well enough that, after its British run, Rubens's libretto was borrowed by the American producers Comstock and Marbury to be remade as a 'new' musical play, 'Nobody Home', with songs by Jerome Kern. 
Rubens returned to his habitual lightweight, light-blue style for Robert Courtneidge's successful production 'The Dairymaids' (1906) and then turned out the show which was to be his most enduring success. Although he was originally scheduled to write alone what he disarmingly called the 'chatter, jingles and tunes' for 'Miss Hook of Holland' (1907), the consumptive illness from which he suffered all his adult life prevented him from doing so, and the director Austen Hurgon ended by helping out with the show's libretto. 'Miss Hook' was a major hit, and Rubens and Hurgon went on to provide two further pieces for its producer, Frank Curzon. 'My Mimosa Maid' and 'Dear Little Denmark' were, however, much less successful. 
Curzon then switched Rubens away from libretto writing and teamed him instead with his newest playwriting discovery, the young Freddie Lonsdale, who had just provided the producer with a major hit in the romantic, Ruritanian costume musical 'King of Cadonia' (music by Sidney Jones). Rubens's 'tunes' (this was all he ever supplied; the accompaniments had to be written for him) for 'The Balkan Princess' were far from being of the quality or the musicianship of Jones's work, but -- as ever -- they proved to have that catchiness that makes for success. 'The Balkan Princess' became a West End success, an overseas hit -- produced from Broadway to Budapest to Havana -- and a longtime feature of the British touring circuits. 
Rubens was then signed by Edwardes as principal composer to the Gaiety Theatre, and in the years that followed he provided the famous producer with songs for 'The Sunshine Girl' (1912), 'The Girl from Utah' (1913), 'After the Girl' (1914), 'Tina' (1915), 'Betty' (1915), and, above all, Fred Thompson's adaptation of the famous farce 'Les dominos roses' as 'Tonight's the Night' (1914). Supplied with a libretto of quality, and limited again to writing just melodies and lyrics, Rubens proved, with a singular success, that this kind of light and bright illustration of a classy comic text was what he did best. However, just as an era of such pieces was beginning in the British theatre, Rubens's illness got the better of him. He died from tuberculosis at Roscarrack, Budock, Falmouth, Cornwall, on 4 February 1917, at the age of only forty-one. 
W. Graham Robertson provided a eulogy: 'That strange genius who masqueraded as a good-looking boy, wandering listlessly through life in the hope of amusing himself, and who got through more good work in his short life than many a composer of fifty has to his credit. (Robertson, 321)' Although during his lifetime the dark-featured Rubens carried an excessively public and blazing torch for several lovely actresses -- notably Phyllis Dare -- he never married.

Parry, John Humffreys (1816-1880), serjeant-at-law, son of John Humffreys Parry (1786-1825), antiquary, and his wife, a daughter of John Thomas of Llanfyllin, was born in London on 24 January 1816. He received a commercial education at the Philological School, Marylebone, and spent a short time in a merchant's office in London; but his literary talents made commerce distasteful to him, and he accepted a post in the printed book department in the British Museum. While thus occupied he attended lectures at the Aldersgate Institution and studied for the bar. He was called to the bar in June 1843 by the Middle Temple. He joined the home circuit, and soon obtained a good criminal business, becoming prominent at the central criminal court and the Middlesex sessions. His appointment as a serjeant-at-law, in June 1856, gave him access to better work in the civil courts, where, thanks to an admirable appearance and voice, great clearness and simplicity of statement, and the tact of a born advocate, he was very successful in winning verdicts. He was also prominent in compensation cases, especially for the London, Brighton, and Coast Railway. He obtained a patent of precedence in 1864 from Lord Westbury after lords Campbell and Chelmsford had refused it on the mere ground of his being a serjeant (Ballantine, 207), and he afterwards led the home circuit. In November 1878 he was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple. He was best-known for several notorious cases: the trial of Manning in 1849; of Muller, for the murder of Mr Briggs, in October 1864; the Overend and Gurney prosecution in 1869; the indictment of Arthur Orton, the Tichborne claimant, in 1873-4; and 'Whistler v. Ruskin' in November 1878. In the last he appeared for Whistler, his own rather melodramatic court style fitting the odd nature of the case and helping to secure a verdict which did not punish his client. 
In politics Parry was an advanced liberal. At the time of the first Chartist movement he sympathized with the more moderate of their views, and knew many of their leaders, and assisted William Lovett in his latter days. Parry was also one of the founders of the Complete Suffrage Association in 1842. In 1847 he unsuccessfully contested Norwich against Lord Douro and Sir Samuel Morton Peto and in 1857 was beaten in Finsbury by Tom Duncombe and William Cox, coming third at the poll, and spending $790. 
Parry published 'Lord Campbell's Libel Act' (1844) and 'A Letter on Feargus O'Connor' (1843). He was twice married: first to Margaret New, who died on 13 September 1856; and afterwards to Elizabeth Mead, daughter of Edwin Abbott (1808-1882); she predeceased him by a few hours. Parry died on 10 January 1880 at his house, 66 Holland Park, Kensington, of congestion of the lungs, aggravated, it is said, by the faulty drainage of the house. He was buried at Woking on 15 January 1880. He had two sons, of whom the elder, John Humffreys, an actor, died in 1891. The second was Sir Edward Abbott Parry (1863-1943), judge and author, who was born on 2 October 1863. He was a barrister and, from 1894 to 1911, a county court judge based in Manchester, later becoming prominent for chairing tribunals. He was knighted in 1927. Parry was also a prolific author and dramatist and a theatre producer, describing his varied life in 'My Own Way' (1932). He was twice married: first to Helen (died 1932), daughter of Thomas Hart; second, in 1936, to Ellen Ann Page. He died on 1 December 1943.

(Leonard Edward) Rowan Bentall (1911-1993), department store owner, was born on 27 November 1911 at Ferney, 23 Lovelace Road, Surbiton, Surrey. Educated at Eastbourne College, he joined Bentalls in 1930. His father arranged for him to spend a year working at Harrods in 1933, after a plan to send him to Macy's, in New York, was cancelled because of the international financial situation. He was appointed a director of Bentalls in 1936. On 15 September 1937 he married Adelia Elizabeth Hawes (1916-1986), daughter of Edgar David Hawes, company director, of Southgate, London. They had three sons and two daughters. In 1940 he joined the East Surrey regiment as a private and was later commissioned into the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He served in the Eighth Army at El Alamein, in Sicily, and the mainland of Italy, and took part in the Normandy landings in 1944. 
On demobilization in 1946 Rowan Bentall became merchandise director of Bentalls and in 1947 he made a six-week tour of the United States, visiting thirty-eight stores. Much impressed by what he saw, he recorded his impressions in a booklet, 'My American Tour' (1947). Like his father, he took a particular interest in publicity, with advertising campaigns such as the 'June bride' in 1951, promoting the idea that everything for a wedding and a couple's future home could be bought in the store, and 'Italy in Kingston' in 1955. He became deputy chairman of Bentalls in 1950, and after his brother's heart attack in 1963 he became managing director. Under his chairmanship, which lasted from 1968 to 1978, the turnover of the group doubled, and in 1973 he opened a new store in Bracknell, Berkshire. He published a history of the firm, 'My Store of Memories', in 1974. On 23 June 1987 he married Katherine Christina Allan ('b'. 1935/6), a physiotherapist. 
Bentall died at his home, Hill House, Buckholt Road, Broughton, near Stockbridge, Hampshire, on 24 July 1993. He was buried on 30 July in the churchyard of St Andrew's parish church, Chippenham, Wiltshire. In 1982 his eldest son, L. Edward Bentall ('b'. 1939), became chairman, the fourth generation to head the family business, which was still widely known as Bentalls of Kingston upon Thames. Bentalls stores continue to trade at Kingston and Bracknell at the start of the twenty-first century.

James, Edward Frank Willis (1907-1984), art patron, was born on 16 August 1907 at Greywalls, Gullane, East Lothian, the youngest of five children of William James (died 1912), landed gentleman, and Evelyn Elizabeth (1869-1929), eldest daughter of Sir Charles Forbes, fourth baronet, of Castle Newe, Aberdeenshire. His father was of American extraction, his mother Scottish. During his mother's childhood she became friendly with the future king and queen, Edward VII and Alexandra. The king became Edward's godfather, and it was often rumoured that he was the father of the boy. Correspondence between Evelyn James and the royal couple suggests that this was most unlikely. There is, however, considerable evidence that Colonel John (Dosie) Brinton may have been Edward's real father; William James was probably left impotent after a severe attack of mumps about 1889. However, James never mentioned that William might not have been his father. 
William James died when Edward was only four, leaving him in the hands of the most demanding and possessive of mothers; his childhood and adolescence were eased only by the kindness of Dosie Brinton. Edward was sent to Le Rosey, a private school in Switzerland, and was brought home to attend crammers to prepare him for the Eton College entrance exam. He was there from 1920 to 1924, and won the Geoffrey Gunther memorial drawing prize, presented to him with a flattering commendation by Roger Fry. James went up to Christ Church, Oxford, from 1926 to 1928. He first read history, but in his second year changed to modern languages, doing little of either and leaving Oxford without a degree. But he made his name by the flamboyant decoration of his rooms and by his lavish entertaining. 
James published his first book of poems in 1926, the start of a long line of 'vanity' publications which appeared during the next thirty years. He became friends with John Betjeman, subsidizing the Oxford University student newspaper the 'Cherwell', which Betjeman then edited, and in 1931 publishing Betjeman's first book of poems, 'Mount Zion', under the imprint the James Press. Much of his energy at this time was spent in freeing himself from the interference of his mother. Her death in 1929 solved some of his problems, and shortly afterwards the inheritance of huge fortunes from his father and his late uncle Frank created many others. 
In his new-found independence, aided by his great wealth, James's eccentricity began to emerge. During a short honorary posting at the British embassy in Rome he mainly distinguished himself by engineering a personal appointment with Mussolini, but the Duce, seeing his youth through the door, refused to see him. In 1928 he had a more fateful meeting in London with the beautiful dancer Ottilie Ethel (Tilly) Losch ('c'.1904-1975). This led to their disastrous marriage in New York in 1931, which deeply affected his future. It has been suggested that Losch agreed to the marriage for financial security, in the certain belief that Edward was homosexual and that the marriage could be rapidly terminated. Living in New York, Losch was overtly unfaithful to James, who sued for divorce; in 1934 she counter-sued for cruelty and homosexuality. There was not a shred of evidence to support her charges and she lost the case. In theory, society at that time ostracized husbands who divorced their wives. James complained that he was cut by old friends, but in reality he was moving into a more bohemian world of artists and composers, spending much of his time on the continent. 
In 1931 James, already sensing a coldness in Losch, determined to win back her affections by creating a ballet in which she would be the prima ballerina. The project was finally realized when James met Georges Balanchine in Paris, struggling to launch his new ballet company. With James's money everyone's dream became a reality, and Les Ballets 1933 put on brief performances in Paris and London, with Losch in two starring roles. But she failed to attend the final party James gave for the company at the Savoy. His generous patronage of Les Ballets failed to win back Losch, but it did launch Balanchine on a meteoric career in America, an achievement James seems never to have noticed. However, the Frenchwomen like Marie-Laure de Noailles who had encouraged his patronage led him on to support several important contemporary French composers. 
During the 1930s James spent more and more time travelling throughout Europe and renting the beautiful Villa Cimbrone above Ravello which he regarded as his home. He returned to England from time to time for brief stays at his London house, 35 Wimpole Street, bombed during the Second World War, and at West Dean Park and the smaller Monkton House, which Lutyens had built for William James on the nearby South Downs. This nomadic way of life continued thereafter until James's death: from Europe to America to Mexico, to a last few years in Italy. 
In the early 1930s James became attracted by contemporary painting and above all by the surrealists and the work of Salvador Dali. James said he first became aware of Dali's painting when in 1932, staying with the Noailles at Hyeres, he saw the artist's striking portrait of Marie-Laure. Exactly when he first met Dali is uncertain but was probably at some time in 1933 at Hyeres. James was much attracted by the young Catalan painter, and in December 1936 he signed a contract with Dali, purchasing all the work he produced between June 1937 and June 1938. Dali claimed later that Edward had all his best work. Dali's paintings -- others acquired at other times -- became the crowning glory of James's collection of paintings; many of the best pictures were bought in the 1930s though he continued to collect until late in his life. He also had a fine collection of works by Magritte, de Chirico, Picasso, Paul Delvaux, Pavel Tchelitchew, and Leonora Carrington. James hated to be thought of as a collector -- an academic, uncreative word. He liked to think of himself as a creative patron, to some extent involved in the creative process. 
Thus motivated, late in 1935 James decided to refurbish Monkton, the Lutyens house he always thought 'too cottagey'. He took Dali to the first meeting with the architects, Kit Nicholson and Hugh Casson. Casson had said that Dali mixed the purple colour for the outside walls but thereafter had nothing to do with the 'surrealization' of the house, whose interior was put into the hands of a decorator, Norris Wakefield. 
James continued to publish books of poetry and was deeply hurt by Stephen Spender's cutting review in the 'New Statesman' of 'The Bones of my Hand' (1938). Occasionally James did write moving poetry, but much of his work was too self-conscious. His inspiration in the late 1930s was the beautiful film star Ruth Ford who -- though fond of Edward -- like Losch was more interested in his wealth and certainly never intended to marry him. In February 1939 Edward sailed for New York, to help with some of Dali's projects, and did not return to England until 1947. 
In 1940 James decided to settle in California, but in May he visited the artists' colony, Taos, made famous by D. H. Lawrence in the 1920s, and was drawn to Los Angeles by the hope of friendship with Aldous Huxley and Gerald Heard, and, on his own written admission, by homosexuality. He found the latter but failed to make friends with Huxley, Heard, or other famous people in Los Angeles. He lived a desultory life in Los Angeles, moving from house to apartment to hotel. Always impractical, and obsessively clean, he covered every surface with tissues until, forced to dispose of them, he pushed them down the lavatory; when it was totally clogged, he tried to clear it by setting fire to the paper, and often the room. 
In 1944, staying with a friend in Cuernavaca, James fell in love with Mexico and, more deeply, with Plutarco Gastelum in the local telegraph office. This passion for Mexico and Gastelum filled most of the last chapter of James's life. In 1945 he discovered Xilitla, and in 1947 they bought the first land there, adding to it later. Gastelum married, had children, and built a large house in the village, where Edward lodged in one wing. The mountains rose steeply on one side of their land, with waterfalls running down the slopes. James was enchanted and started by planting thousands of imported orchids. Next he introduced various species of animals but he soon learned that he could not keep them without cages. This led to the idea of enriching the exotic landscape with highly coloured surrealist architecture. With the help of local labour and the practical talents of Gastelum, the Entrance Tower, the Summer Palace, the Plaza San Eduardo, and several other polychromed concrete buildings began to rise high above the shade of the tropical forest. James's imagination created a place of intriguing beauty. 
James had long been a tax exile, and his visits to England were limited. Strangely, while trying to curry favour with Huxley, he had written to ask him to help convert West Dean Park into some kind of artistic community. The house was then offered to several institutions, all of which refused it. In November 1964 James gave the house and much of his land to the Edward James Foundation, including the furnishings in the house and the greater part of his art collection. He kept Monkton with 500 acres. It was a munificent gift, but as yet the trust had no precise purpose. It was not until 1969 that Major-General Cyril Lloyd, formerly director-general of the City and Guilds, suggested to the trustees the foundation of an arts and crafts college, which opened in 1971. Strangely, James never mentioned the similar scheme he had suggested to Huxley. 
James, at first enthusiastic, never appreciated that the college could not be launched without considerable capital, which could have been raised by the sale of furniture and pictures. When in England he sniped at the college from Monkton, but retired for most of the time to a friend's house in Perinaldo, near San Remo, until, dissatisfied with that, he moved to a nearby restaurant. In early autumn 1984 he became ill there and the ever-patient owner drove him to Paris, where he collapsed on reaching his hotel. Eventually he returned to a nursing home in San Remo where he died on 2 December 1984. He was buried, at his wish, in the arboretum at West Dean.

Lanteri, Edward (1848-1917), sculptor and teacher of sculpture, was born at Auxerre, France, on 1 November 1848, the son of a tradesman. Although he showed precocious talent as a violinist, in his mid-teens he accepted an offer from the academic sculptor Aime Millet to receive training in his Paris studio; at the same time he attended the Petite Ecole de Dessin ('c'.1863- 'c'.1865). He subsequently worked for Francois-Joseph Duret and received a more formal sculptural education at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, under Pierre-Jules Cavelier and Eugene Guillaume ('c'.1865- 'c'.1868). The Franco-Prussian War brought a temporary setback to Lanteri's career: for eighteen months he worked as a cabinet-maker's assistant, repairing furniture damaged during the bombardment of Paris. In July 1870 Lanteri married, probably Honorine (the name of his widow). 
Through the expatriate French sculptor Jules Dalou, who was based in London, Lanteri received an offer of employment from Joseph Edgar Boehm in 1872. The critic M. H. Spielmann later claimed that Lanteri's 'extraordinary skill and intelligent perception are to be found in much of the best productions' of Boehm (Spielmann, 128). While Lanteri certainly contributed to Boehm's success, their relationship was founded on mutual respect and friendship and lasted until Boehm's death in 1890. Boehm probably helped secure Lanteri's appointment as Dalou's successor as instructor in modelling at the National Art Training School, South Kensington, in 1880. As Lanteri was little known at the time, this caused controversy and press comment, with Edmund Gosse calling the affair 'the Dalou-Boehm job' (Stocker, 'Royalist and Realist', 332). 
It soon emerged, however, that Lanteri's appointment was little short of inspirational. He remained at the school (from 1896 the Royal College of Art) for thirty-seven years and was made its first professor of sculpture and modelling in 1901. Although the institution was severely criticized in two government reports in 1887 and 1911, on both occasions Lanteri's areas of activity were handsomely endorsed. Student numbers reflected his success, the total increasing from twelve in 1874 to 105 in 1899. A high point came in 1903, when Lanteri's friend Auguste Rodin visited the Royal College of Art and pronounced himself 'delighted with all the students' work' (Frayling, 84). Spielmann claimed that 'A very large proportion of the most successful British sculptors of to-day who are not more than middle-aged owe to Professor Lanteri much of the success they have achieved' (Spielmann, 1). They included Alfred Gilbert, Alfred Drury, and Albert Toft, all major figures in the New Sculpture. Lanteri's students of a later generation, such as Charles Sargeant Jagger, Gilbert Ledward, and Charles Wheeler, took sculpture into the era of art deco and early modernism. Also significant was a talented array of women sculptors, including Margaret Giles, Ruby Levick, and Gwendolyn Williams. 
In response to requests to publish his notes used for demonstration classes, Lanteri compiled the three-volume text 'Modelling: a Guide for Teachers and Students' (1902-11), described as ''the' classic treatise on the techniques of figurative sculpture' (N. C. Hale in Lanteri, 'Modelling and Sculpture', 1.vi); a reflection of its enduring significance was its republication in 1965 and 1985. Lanteri avoided being drily academic, stressing that 'art is essentially individual' (ibid., 2). The aim of art teaching should be 'to put within the pupil's grasp all that is necessary to help him to express his thoughts by the simplest, surest and quickest means' (ibid., 3). Lanteri regarded drawing as 'the principal foundation of sculpture' (p. 4), and knowledge of anatomy was equally essential (ibid., 4). Elaborate modelling tools were unnecessary: 'the human finger is more firm, and at the same time more sensitive, than any mechanical instrument. It is nature's spatula and should be used in preference to anything else' (Staley, 84). In handling composition he advised restraint on the teacher's part: 'For a master to impose on his pupil his own conception of a subject is entirely contrary to the rules of artistic teaching' (Lanteri, 'Modelling and Sculpture', 2.98). Lanteri practised what he preached. One of his pupils, Francis Shurrock, who later laid the foundations of sculptural education in New Zealand, recalled: 'None of Lanteri's students worked as he did, each developing in his own way, & that is just what Lanteri wanted' (Stocker, 'Francis Shurrock', 50). 
Although Lanteri could only devote limited time to his own sculpture, he exhibited seventy works at the Royal Academy between 1885 and 1917. Their poor survival rate has contributed to his relatively low art historical profile. To some extent Lanteri was himself culpable: a perfectionist, he was recorded by Spielmann as having destroyed many works. His stylistic versatility is reflected in the lively rococo modelling of 'Sketch for a Garden Design' and the more serene, classical carving 'The Duet' (1891), a sculptural counterpart to the paintings of Albert Moore and Frederic Leighton. Surviving works -- such as the busts of 'The Peasant' ('c'.1901) and 'Alfred Stevens' (1911; both Tate collection) -- convey confidence in handling material and psychological insight. Lanteri's most prominently sited works are his architectural carvings for the Victoria and Albert Museum (1905-7). They were executed with assistance from four advanced Royal College of Art students and comprise 'Fame' at the summit of the main tower and figures of 'Sculpture' and 'Architecture' below. As a medallist Lanteri was second only to Alphonse Legros in significance. Like Legros, he encouraged the revival of the cast medal and responded to Italian Renaissance precedents, seen for example in 'Julio Monticelli' (1888; British Museum, London). 
Lanteri died at his home at 50 Perryn Road, East Acton, Middlesex, on 18 December 1917 and was succeeded at the Royal College of Art by his former pupil Francis Derwent Wood. Apart from Sir Edmund Gosse -- who unaccountably omitted Lanteri from his influential essay 'The New Sculpture' -- reactions to him were invariably enthusiastic. Shurrock claimed, 'Lanteri was more than a teacher, he was an inspiration' (Stocker, 'Francis Shurrock', 50), and Gilbert called him a 'man of infinite sensibility, subtle imagination and inflexible will, endowed, too, with natural poetical instincts' (McAllister, 25). Examples of his work are in the Tate collection; the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, London; and the Musee d'Orsay, Paris. His statue of Sir Samuel Sadler may be seen in Victoria Square, Middlesbrough, and that of Ludwig Mond at Winnington Lane, Northwich, Cheshire.

Christian, Ewan (1814-1895), architect, was born on 20 September 1814 in London, the seventh of the nine children of Joseph Christian (died 1821) and his wife, Katherine (died 1822), daughter of John Scales of Thwaitehead, Lancashire. His father's family was of Manx and Cumbrian origin; it included a number of clergymen and Christian was himself intended for ordination. Orphaned at an early age, he was educated in the junior department of Christ's Hospital, Hertford. He married on 6 July 1848 Annie (died 1895), daughter of William Walker Bentham of Rochester, a kinsman of Jeremy Bentham. They had three daughters. 
Christian was articled to Matthew Habershon in 1829 and studied at the architectural school of the Royal Academy. He provided illustrations for Habershon's 'The Ancient Half-Timbered Houses of England' (1836), a book that was highly critical of Pugin. In 1836 he joined the office of William Railton (from 1838 the architect to the ecclesiastical commissioners) with whom he worked on drawings for the Houses of Parliament competition. After a period with the Norwich architect John Brown, and a visit to Rome and Naples in 1841, he set up independently in London in 1842. 
Although Christian was never exclusively an ecclesiastical architect, churches became his speciality. His first, Hildenborough, Kent (1843-4), won in competition, as were most of his early works, showed considerable design flair in providing uncluttered preaching space. Christian considered his restorations of Austrey, Warwickshire, Scarborough, Yorkshire (from 1844), and Wolverhampton (from 1850) to have established his career and, along with his appointment as consulting architect to the Lichfield Diocesan Church Building Society (and probably the good offices of Railton), these led in 1851 to his appointment as architect to the ecclesiastical commissioners, an influential post that he occupied until his death. 
Christian was a prolific architect with over 2000 completed works to his name; many of these were church restorations carried out in his capacity as architect for the ecclesiastical commissioners, but included ninety new churches, many parsonages, schools, and private houses. Much of his work, often completed within very tight budgets, appears off-the-shelf, spare, and uninspiring, but he was capable of fine and original designs. Among his finest churches (in addition to Hildenborough) were Wickham Bishops, Essex (1849-50), Kenilworth, Warwickshire (1851-2), Leyland, Lancashire (1854-5), St Peter's, Rochester (1859-60; dem.), St Mark's, Leicester (1870-72, and perhaps his best), Sunk Island, East Riding, Yorkshire (1875-7), and St Matthew's, Cheltenham (1878-9). Notable restorations include those of Carlisle Cathedral (1853-7) and Southwell Minster (1848-8); of his secular buildings, the National Portrait Gallery, London (1890-95), may be singled out. 
Christian attained great prominence within his profession. He was elected vice-president (1880) and then president (1884) of the Royal Institute of British Architects; he received the institute's gold medal in 1887. He acted as consulting architect to a number of bodies, notably the Incorporated Church Building Society and (in 1887) the charity commissioners (for whom he provided the most comprehensive survey of Wren's London churches ever carried out). He was a member of the board of judges for Admiralty and War Office competitions and assessor to many others including Edinburgh (1872) and Liverpool (1884) cathedrals. His partners were James K. Colling, Henry Purday, and his cousin J. H. Christian; well-known architects who passed through his office included Axel Haig and W. D. Caroe. He was J. L. Pearson's brother-in-law and a close friend and executor of S. S. Teulon. 
Christian was highly regarded for his competence, integrity, and technical skills, but his reputation began to wane even during his lifetime, and his obituaries convey the impression of a man widely admired but not considered outstanding -- a 'safe man' but 'in no sense a heaven-born genius' ('Building News', 1 March 1895). He was a devout and energetic evangelical Anglican who favoured auditory rather than highly ritualistic designs and who demanded strict economy on work carried out for the ecclesiastical commissioners, a body much distrusted by the high church. It was his low-church credentials more than his abilities as an architect that helped fuel adverse criticism, a situation already clear at the time of the Liverpool Cathedral competition (1884), when highly placed critics openly queried his decision. A century was to pass before Christian's reputation began to recover from this critical legacy. 
Christian died at his home, which he designed himself, called Thwaitehead, 50 Well Walk, Hampstead, London, on 21 February 1895 and was buried at Hampstead cemetery on 25 February.

Samuel, Walter Horace, second Viscount Bearsted (1882-1948), art collector and philanthropist, was born on 13 March 1882 in London, the eldest child and only surviving son of Marcus Samuel, first Viscount Bearsted (1853-1927), and his wife, Fanny Elizabeth Benjamin (1857-1927). Educated at Eton College and at New College, Oxford, Walter Samuel's childhood coincided with the rapid expansion of his father's family trading business, M. Samuel & Co., into the sale of petroleum. In 1904 he joined the staff of the Shell Transport and Trading Company (founded by his father and uncle in 1897), becoming a director in 1907 and succeeding his father as chairman in 1921, a post which he held until his own retirement in 1946. Samuel's marriage on 23 July 1908 to Dorothea 
(Dorothy; 1882/3-1949)
, daughter of Edward Montefiore Micholls, gave him a family of three sons: Marcus Richard, subsequently third Viscount Bearsted (1909-1986), Peter Montefiore, who became fourth Viscount Bearsted (1911-1996), and Anthony Gerald ('b'. 1917). In the First World War, Samuel served with the West Kent yeomanry on the general staff, ending the war as a captain with the Military Cross. In the Second World War he served in the intelligence corps with the rank of colonel. 
His position and great wealth gave Samuel the opportunity to pursue the interests for which he is best remembered: philanthropy and art collecting. An observant Jew of the United Synagogue, he supported many Jewish charities, including the Bearsted Memorial Hospital at Stoke Newington and the Bearsted maternity home at Hampton Court, both in London. He worked for the emigration of Jews from Nazi Germany in the 1930s and, although no Zionist himself, for a peaceful accommodation in Palestine. He was an art collector and public benefactor even before succeeding to his father's titles in 1927. The first viscount had financed a new wing for Maidstone Museum to house his son's Japanese collection, which reflected the family's oriental trading activities. Samuel had started collecting paintings by European old masters before the First World War and purchases, inspired by his fine eye and personal tastes, continued unabated until the year of his death, forming one of the most important collections of the century. In 1927 he acquired Upton House on Edge Hill in Warwickshire where he could indulge his passion for hunting. He transformed the house into a suitable setting for his growing collection, which included the original versions of 'The Haymakers' and 'The Reapers' (both 1783) by George Stubbs, El Greco's 'Disrobing of Christ', and 'The Dormition of the Virgin' by Pieter Bruegel the elder; works by other masters such as Hogarth, George Romney, Giovanni di Paolo, Guardi, Steen, and Metsu also featured. Acquired individually, mainly through dealers and with the benefit of advice from such experts as Sir Alec Martin of Christies, the paintings chosen by Samuel also included masterpieces by lesser known artists. Combining his philanthropy with his love of art, in 1948 he gave this internationally important collection, together with Upton House, its fine garden, and a large endowment, to the National Trust. 
Samuel was chairman of the trustees of the National Gallery, a trustee of the Tate Gallery, a major benefactor of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (with a donation of $18,000 in 1938), and in the last years of his life chairman of the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London. Reserved and private in character, Samuel spoke in the House of Lords only on the subjects of petroleum and Jewish affairs. He died at Upton House on 8 November 1948.

Oliver, Thomas (1791-1857), architect and surveyor, was born on 14 January 1791 at Over Crailing, near Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, the second son of Adam Oliver (1749-1793), weaver, and his wife, Elizabeth Bell (1762-1829). He was educated at Jedburgh School before working for his future father-in-law, James Lorimer (or Lorrimer), a Kelso stonemason. He moved to Newcastle in or just before 1814, when he married Margaret Lorimer (died 1838), with whom he had two daughters and four sons. He married secondly, in 1840, Elizabeth Best, with whom he had a son, Charles William (1847-1855). In 1821 he began independent practice as a 'land surveyor and architect'; this was after six years as pupil and assistant to his more illustrious and slightly older contemporary John Dobson, by whom Oliver tended to be overshadowed throughout his career. 
In fact, the number of buildings which can be ascribed to Oliver is comparatively small. His principal contribution is perhaps the series of superb engraved maps of Newcastle which he issued in 1830, 1844, 1849, 1851, and (posthumously) 1858, and his topographical works 'A New Picture of Newcastle upon Tyne' (1831) and 'The Topographical Conductor: a Descriptive Guide to Newcastle and Gateshead' (1851). In addition, he undertook a number of more specific surveys for the corporation and between 1824 and 1825 worked as a surveyor for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company. 
Oliver was also a noteworthy planner in his own right. He put forward several unexecuted schemes for new streets which would have considerably improved Newcastle's inadequate communication routes; some of these are indicated on his 1830 'Plan of Newcastle upon Tyne'. However, claims that he was the real author of the entrepreneur Richard Grainger's redevelopment of central Newcastle between 1834 and 1839 cannot be sustained. Oliver's ideas were concerned mainly with the periphery of the town, and his 'Plan of Building Ground, Together with Proposed and Projected Improvements in Newcastle upon Tyne' of July 1834 indicates that he was summarizing rather than initiating events; it shows not only Grainger's proposals but also those of other developers (including one planned by Dobson) and was almost certainly produced for public sale rather than for Grainger himself. 
Oliver's architecture lies within the classical tradition of late Georgian and early Victorian Newcastle. Here his main work was Leazes Terrace, an extended stone-faced block, built for Grainger between 1829 and 1834, together with the elegant but more modest Leazes Crescent; he also designed the West Clayton Street Congregational Chapel (1850-51; dem.). Earlier he had designed for Dr John Baird in 1824 a pair of fashionably stone-fronted houses on the west side of Northumberland Street (dem.), and prepared for the corporation plans for Blackett Street and Eldon Square. The latter two developments were, however, ultimately financed by Grainger and built (1824 and 1825-31 respectively; now mostly dem.) largely to the designs of Dobson. Between 1836 and 1848 he laid out for George Tallantire Gibson a development of neat two- and three-storey streets 'suited to the wants of the humble yet respectable classes of the community' (J. Collingwood Bruce, 'Handbook to Newcastle upon Tyne', 1863, 116). It contained the Gibson Street Methodist (New Connexion) Chapel of 1837 and the Victoria Bazaar (1836-7), a triangular shopping arcade at the junction of Buxton, Gibson, and Melbourne streets which was possibly the prototype for Grainger's prestigious central arcade ('c'.1836-8) in Grey Street. 'Gibson Town' (dem. 1962-8) would, with additional parts of east Newcastle, have been conveniently linked to the quayside had an improvement scheme by Oliver of 1855 been implemented. Oliver died on 9 December 1857, at his home, 3 Picton Place, Newcastle, and was buried in Jesmond (formerly Newcastle general) cemetery. Of his sons by his first marriage, two were civil engineers, while Thomas jun. (1824-1902) became a noted architect in Sunderland and, after his father's death, founded in 1881 the Newcastle partnership of Oliver and Leeson (later Oliver, Leeson, and Wood).

Murray, Charles Fairfax (1849-1919), artist and art connoisseur, was born on 13 September 1849 at 14 High Street, Bow, in London, the son of James Dalton Murray (1808-1876), a draper, and Elizabeth Scott (1816-1853). About 1862 he was working in an engineering drawing office, but he entered Edward Burne-Jones's studio about 1866-7, as an assistant. Murray exhibited a painting, 'Children in the Woods' (exh. RA, 1867), and began work for William Morris. His tasks included transferring designs to stained glass (including the windows of the Castle Howard chapel), doing miniature illustrations for Morris's poems (including 'A Book of Verses', 1870, 'Virgil', 1875, and the 'Ruba'yat', 1872, painting panels on furniture, and transferring Burne-Jones's designs to the South Kensington Museum panels. In 1869-70 he worked in Rossetti's workshop as assistant, factotum, and proof-reader of Rossetti's poems, and in October 1870 he travelled with Morris to Bruges. Touring Italy in 1871-2 he executed copies of the Camposanto frescoes in Pisa: Burne-Jones showed John Ruskin these copies and Ruskin hired Murray as a copyist, sending him to Italy where he copied for Ruskin until 1883. Murray began living in Florence after 1878, periodically returning to London from about 1884-5. He took a studio in Holland Park on 19 November 1886, and leased Burne-Jones's home, The Grange, from 1898. His paintings are in a late Pre-Raphaelite style, while his copies encompass both Renaissance and Pre-Raphaelite art, including copies of several of Rossetti's paintings. 
Murray's major contributions were as collector, art dealer, connoisseur, and buyer, for public museums as well as for private collectors. His own collections included Italian and English art, especially Pre-Raphaelite art, rare and illuminated books, incunabula of different origins, and a complete series of the Kelmscott editions, forming one of the finest European book collections. Ruskin praised Murray's knowledge of Italian art in 'Ariadne Florentina' in 1872, and in 1877 Murray acquired Verrocchio's 'Madonna and Child' for him for $100. During the late 1870s he was a consultant for Charles Moore of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University. During the 1890s he was a consultant for several directors of the Fitzwilliam Museum -- J. H. Middleton, M. R. James, and Sydney Cockerell -- and was a generous benefactor of that museum, donating Titian's 'Tarquin and Lucretia' in 1918. He worked for two directors of the National Gallery, Frederick Burton and Edward Poynter, obtaining works by several early Italian painters, including Duccio, Matteo di Giovanni, Nicolo di Buonaccorso, Andrea del Castagno, Giovanni Bellini, and Barna da Siena, and donating a Pietro Lorenzetti painting in 1882. He worked for the South Kensington Museum under Thomas Armstrong for whom he purchased Orcagna's mosaic from the west front of Orvieto Cathedral about 1890 -- and for his successor, J. H. Middleton. He also advised Edward Hooper of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1897. His publications include several volumes on the rare books in his collections, a catalogue of the duke of Portland's collection (1894), and catalogues of his drawing collections. He was an agent for the art dealership Agnew's and for the dealer Martin Colnaghi. In 1903-6 he sold his Pre-Raphaelite collection to the Birmingham City Museum; between 1907 and 1910 he sold his Renaissance drawings to Pierpont Morgan for $40,000 (Pierpont Morgan Library, New York). He gave paintings to the Dulwich Gallery in 1911, and three years later sold some of his collection at Georges Petit, Paris, for 1,668,800 French francs. After his death, his library was sold in England; his son John's collection was sold in 1929; the remaining collection was sold in 1961. 
Murray was a typical Victorian connoisseur, who valued sensibility above science. He looked for 'quality', holding that the identity of the artist should not affect appreciation of a work of art on its own merits; although happy to give attributions, he wisely recognized that these were merely opinions open to revision as art historical studies advanced. Murray advised the budding connoisseur to train the eye by the study of one school at a time, holding that connoisseurship was 'just a question of memory and practice'. This workmanlike attitude to his profession was underpinned by a shrewd eye to the financial value of art: when asked if his reattributions had devalued one client's collection, Murray replied that 'it is worth... about two-and-a-half times as much as it was before' (Benson, 216-18). 
On 10 April 1875 Murray married Angelica Albina Isolina Collevicchi (died 'c'.1927), a seventeen-year-old, originally from Volterra; they lived in Siena and after 1878 in Florence. They had six surviving children, three daughters and three sons, all born in Florence and holding dual nationalities. One other daughter died very young. In February 1888 Murray met Blanche Richmond (died 1952), with whom he had a family in London of six children. Murray died at his home, 77 Barrowgate Road, Chiswick, Middlesex, on 25 January 1919. His drawings are held by his family and in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Birmingham Art Gallery, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Whitworth Gallery in Manchester, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, and the Delaware Art Museum, and in the universities of Yale, Princeton, and Stanford.

Anthony Devis (1729-1816/17), landscape painter, was born on 18 March 1729 in Preston, Lancashire, and baptized in April in Preston, the elder son of Anthony Devis and his second wife, Anne Blackburne, who was from Yorkshire and was born at a house called Frier Head. In 1742 he was described in the Preston guild roll as 'of London, Painter'. He exhibited landscapes at the Free Society of Artists in 1761 and 1763, and at the Royal Academy in 1772 and 1781. He was in 1764: 'at the Hon. Mr. Vernon's, Newick Park Sussex; 1770 Sept at Robert Child's Esq., Osterley Park; 1771 Robert Child's Esq. Upton; Sir John Chichester's, Youlton near Barnstaple; 1773, June, Duke of Manchester's, Kimbolton; Sept, John Peploe Birch Esq. Garnston, Herefordshire; Oct., the Hon.

('N&Q', 416)' In 1780 he purchased Albury House, Guildford, Surrey, of which he made many paintings, drawings, and watercolours (1792, Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston; undated, British Museum, London). He travelled widely to sketch and paint English scenery. He died, unmarried, at Guildford on 26 April 1816 or 1817.

Amelia, Princess (1711-1786), daughter of George II, was born on 30 May/10 June 1711 at the palace of Herrenhausen in Hanover, Germany, the summer residence of her grandfather, Georg Ludwig, elector of Hanover (from 1714 King George I of Great Britain), the second daughter of Georg August (1683-1760), electoral prince of Hanover (after 1727 elector of Hanover and King George II of Great Britain), and his wife, Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1683-1737). Her full names were Amelia Sophia Eleonora. In October 1714, shortly after her grandfather acceded to the British throne, she and her sisters, Anne (1709-1759) and Caroline Elizabeth ['see below'], accompanied their parents to England, where the family was installed in St James's Palace. Her brother Frederick Lewis (1707-1751) remained in Hanover. 
Amelia's later taste for intrigue may well have been formed by the ongoing familial power struggles that involved her from as early as December 1717, when her parents were ordered to leave St James's Palace by George I. The king insisted, however, that the children remain. Although he and the prince and princess of Wales were fond of the children, they were pawns in the adults' power game. When the king granted the princess of Wales but not the prince easy access to the children, the prince promptly brought a lawsuit to try and secure their return to his care. He found to his chagrin that in England royal grandchildren belonged to the crown: he could not force the king to return them, nor could he even control their education. Tensions between the two royal households gradually receded after 1717, but the king and prince were not officially reconciled until 1720, and even then their relationship was never smooth. For Amelia and her sisters the reconciliation brought little change: they remained in the king's household at St James's, subject to every shift in family affections. In 1722 Amelia and Caroline attracted widespread public notice when they were inoculated against smallpox using a method only recently brought to England by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. The process was still so new as to generate debate in England and be viewed with alarm by relatives on the continent. Fortunately, all went without incident. 
Amelia (or Emily, as she was often called in Britain) benefited from the joint efforts of two intelligent women: her mother and Johanne Sophie, countess of Schaumburg-Lippe, whom the king had placed in charge of the princesses' household. Consequently she grew up well educated, trilingual (in English, German, and French), highly politicized, latitudinarian in religion, and fond of music, especially that of Handel. She was clever and articulate, but also, less flatteringly, bluntly outspoken, often to the point of tactlessness, impatient, and generally ill-suited to the machinations of a court and its politics. She particularly lacked the patient subtlety and flattering emollience needed to negotiate successfully the ever shifting alliances, deep family divisions, and contending political factions that came to dominate her father's court. Nor did her character lend itself to the prevailing ideals of passive submissive femininity. As a young woman, she was drawn far more to the stables than to the drawing-room or ballroom. She enjoyed fishing and loved horses. An avid hunter, she soon earned the reputation of being the hardest rider after stags in the royal family. Even when she was over forty she was still capable of shocking the 'good women' at Hampton Court by attending chapel on Sunday 'in riding clothes with a dog under her arm' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 37.341). 
Walpole's tone of studied amusement is reflective of his ambiguous feelings towards Amelia. A member of her inner circle of acquaintances for fifty years, he wavered continually between being inordinately proud and flattered to be a favourite and being sharply critical of her character and behaviour. He preferred pretty, pliant, conventional women who wore their intelligence lightly; it is not surprising that he found Amelia's forthright assertiveness, occasional arrogance, and tendency to disregard convention somewhat grating. More unfortunately for her historical reputation, however, she was also exactly the wrong sort of woman to appeal to the leading memoirist of George II's court, the exquisitely effeminate John, Lord Hervey. His dislike of her as a woman was exacerbated by the fact that he saw her as a rival, first for the attention of the prince of Wales and then, more importantly, for that of the queen. His description of her in 1734, when she was only twenty, paints her as darkly as possible for posterity: '[she] was glad of any back to lash, and the sorer it was the gladder she was to strike. She had much the least sense (except her brother) of the whole family, but had for two years much the prettiest person. She was lively, false, and a great liar; did many ill offices to people and no good ones; and for want of prudence said almost as many shocking things to their faces as for want of a good-nature or truth she said disagreeable ones behind their backs. She had as many enemies as acquaintances, for nobody knew her without disliking her, nor was anybody acquainted with her without knowing her; and everybody in the Court being of the same opinion about her, people spoke their opinion with as little caution as variation. (Hervey, 81)' While Amelia's acerbic tongue could make enemies, it was also one of her attractions. Lady Louisa Stuart, who encountered her in old age, was more even-handed than Hervey when she described Amelia as: 'a woman of quick parts and warm feelings, but without Lady Yarmouth's 'bonhommie', [who] knew more of the world than princes usually do; partly from native sagacity, partly from keeping better company and having a mind above that jealous fear of the superior in understanding. (introduction, in 'Letters and Journals', 1.lxxxi)' However, even she noted that the inflated mock grandeur of her relative, Lady Mary Coke, could try the princess's patience sorely. Still, Amelia managed to stay on good terms with Lady Mary for over twenty years, quite a feat in itself. Indeed, over the years she gathered around her a group of intelligent, often witty, well-read and politically aware intimates, including ladies of her household such as Lady Cecilia Isabella (Bell) Finch, who became lifelong friends and acquaintances. While Walpole occasionally complained that her regular levees and private parties were stuffy and 'trist', he continued to attend and take part in their fine mixture of social and political gossip, their discussions of the latest political tracts and literature, and their never-ending games of loo. 
Amelia's life would undoubtedly have been very different had George I lived long enough to carry out his plan for a double marriage between his Hanoverian and Prussian grandchildren. He had intended her to marry Prince Frederick of Prussia (after 1740 Frederick II, 'the Great'), but negotiations collapsed following the accession of George II to the throne in 1727. As there were few other suitable protestant princes and, it seems, marriage to a British commoner was never considered, Amelia had no choice but to remain single. She and Caroline remained unmarried while Anne married William, prince of Orange, in 1734; the younger sisters, Mary (1723-1772) and Louisa ['see under 'Anne, princess royal], married respectively Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Cassel in 1740 and Frederick V, king of Denmark, in 1743. Although Walpole suggests that Amelia held out hopes for a marriage as late as the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, this seems unlikely given her age. As the first unmarried adult English princesses in living memory, she and Caroline, who maintained their own households, were both central and marginal to the court and its politics. Superfluous to the succession, they were doubly hampered by gender: traditional options open to younger sons were closed to them. Following the death of her mother in 1737, Amelia, as the eldest of the widowed king's daughters resident in Britain, became the highest-ranking woman at court. Her proximity to the king and his known reliance on female advisers in the past meant that she could have significant political influence. This situation would have been ideal for a woman with real political ability. Amelia, however, lacked the interpersonal skills and the necessary political sense to use to advantage the queen's death and the factional politics of the 1740s. Her jealousy of her father's politically astute mistress, Amalie von Wallmoden, countess of Yarmouth, limited her influence with her father and his ministers from the outset. Furthermore, in the late 1740s she aligned herself politically with her younger brother William Augustus, duke of Cumberland (1721-1765), and his political cronies, the hot-headed John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, and his supporters, thereby choosing allies who were distrusted by the king, the prime minister Henry Pelham, and the reversionary interest of her brother Frederick's court at Leicester House. Her continued support of her brother William after the death of the prince of Wales in 1751, and the part that she reputedly played in influencing the king against Augusta, dowager princess of Wales, in the subsequent regency debate, earned her the lasting dislike and distrust of both the princess of Wales and her son, the future George III. 
Amelia was appointed ranger of Richmond Park in 1751, gaining her own residence for the first time at New Lodge. Her period as ranger brought her notoriety and revealed her inability to see the political consequences of her actions. It resulted in a series of lawsuits as she tried, ultimately unsuccessfully, to limit public access to the park and traditional rights to gravel, wood, and water. In attempting to close the park to the public after 1751 and make it accessible only to a select group of friends and those neighbours who had been granted special passes, she also gained, for historians such as E. P. Thompson, a high place on the list of arrogant aristocratic landowners intent on removing common rights from the 'people'. She was by no means alone in what she was doing, however, and would probably have succeeded with a minimum amount of fuss had her estate been elsewhere. Like many contemporary landowners she was a firm believer that private property should be private -- and that estates should be closed to the public. Even Walpole noted that in closing Richmond she was only 'imitating what the Duke has done at Windsor' (Walpole, 'Corr.', 20.322). The problem arose from a combination of factors: her rank -- as a member of the royal family, she was expected to set an example for the rest of the country; her gender -- her actions went against gender stereotypes which defined women as caring, considerate, and philanthropic by nature; the location of Richmond Park -- it was far too close to London and the vocal London press for her actions to remain unnoticed; and the nature of the 'public' that she was excluding -- not a group of untutored and impoverished rustics, but prosperous members of the middling sort and substantial tradesmen and artisans who felt that their traditional liberties were being threatened and who were more than ready to use all methods available to them to combat the perceived injustice. 
Under the capable direction of a brewer, a stonemason, and a shoemaker, the closure of the park became a public issue. They organized public meetings, printed memorials in the press (particularly the 'London Evening-Post'), and even gathered a substantial number of signatures on a petition which they had presented to the king. In the end, they had recourse to the law. In a series of judgments between 1754 and 1758, Amelia was forced to grant the public rights to use the ancient footways across the park. These cases, especially the last at the Surrey Lent assizes of 1758 before Sir Michael Foster, were high-profile affairs. In a society that was still highly deferential, the idea of trying a case against a member of the royal family posed particular concerns for the jurors. Foster was forced to put a talesman on the jury and fine absentees $20 each in order to ensure that they did their duty. And they did. As a result of the final verdict in 1758, the public was given access to the park via stepladders (gates could be closed; stiles and ladders could not so easily be stopped). When John Lewis, the brewer who had brought the successful case of 1758, returned to the court to complain that the rungs of the ladders were set too far apart for children and old men, Foster specified that they be changed so as to accommodate 'not only children and old men, but OLD WOMEN too' (Thompson, 113). After this ruling Amelia withdrew from active involvement in the park, so it is possible that she did not see the transfer of the rangership to John Stuart, third earl of Bute, in 1761 as a great loss. 
After her father's death in 1760, Amelia lost her apartments at St James's Palace, but received a pension of $1000 p.a. on the Irish establishment and a household of three ladies of the bedchamber. She took Sir Richard Lyttelton's house in Cavendish Square and, following the loss of New Lodge with the rangership of Richmond Park in 1761, she bought Gunnersbury House in Ealing, Middlesex. George III was hostile to female politicians and his ministers were opposed to Amelia, so she lost what special political influence she had enjoyed. However, her later years were perhaps her happiest, devoted as they were to her circle of acquaintances and her estate at Gunnersbury, where she improved the gardens and built a temple and shell grotto bath house. Although she became increasingly arthritic, deaf, and blind as an old woman, she remained interested in political developments and characteristically opinionated. Despite the poor relationship she had with George III, she refused to use her electoral interest as a landowner in Middlesex against the king. She was highly incensed when, during the Middlesex election of 1774, William Ponsonby, second earl of Bessborough, used her name without her permission to support Hervey Morres, second Viscount Mountmorres, an opposition candidate supported by her despised other nephew, William, duke of Gloucester. Amelia disapproved strongly of the behaviour of George III's younger brothers and later his sons, and this may have been behind her decision to leave her estate to her German nephews, the second and third sons of her sister Mary, landgravine of Hesse-Cassel. 
Amelia died at her house in Cavendish Square, London, on 31 October 1786, and was buried on 11 November in the royal vault in Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey. A frustrated politician, she was by temperament prevented from making the most of the possibilities open to her through gender, birth, and circumstance.

Power, Richard (1724-1794), judge and politician, was the second of three sons of John Power (died 1743), a landowner of Barretstown, co. Tipperary, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of the Revd John Congreve. A member of the Church of Ireland, he was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, entered the Middle Temple in 1752, and was called to the Irish bar in 1757. He became usher of the court of chancery in 1763, and a king's counsel in 1768, receiving the degree of doctor of laws 'honoris causa' from Trinity in 1769. He was MP for Monaghan Borough (1767-8) and for Tuam, co. Galway (1768-72), purchasing his seat on both occasions. Noted in 'Baratariana' as a prominent supporter of the Townshend administration (1767-72), and a close associate of Sir George Macartney, chief secretary (1769-72), he was lampooned for his verbose and theatrical speeches. On one occasion in the House of Commons he made a vigorous attack on William Blackstone, and damaged a copy of Blackstone's 'Commentaries' by thumping it against the benches while displaying 'the vociferation of a Bedlamite and gesture and attitude nicely copied from the state kettle-drummer' ('Baratariana', 152). In another debate he showed more statesmanlike qualities by making a speech of great clarity, in favour of the administration, to explain an important alteration to a controversial money bill of 1769; the bill, however, was rejected by the Commons because it was not drawn up in that chamber, leading Townshend to prorogue parliament until February 1771. The pamphlet 'A Comparative State of the Two Rejected Money Bills in 1692 and 1769' (1770) has been attributed to Power. 
During his parliamentary career Power made little secret of his desire to be a judge, and he was rewarded for his loyalty to the Townshend administration by being appointed second baron of the court of the exchequer in 1772, while retaining his chancery position. Some observers regarded his behaviour on the bench as excessively austere, but his defenders claimed that this was simply a result of his insistence on legal precision and regularity. When Lord Carlisle and William Eden came to office in December 1780 they immediately decided to assert their authority, and in May 1781 recommended Power's dismissal on the grounds of his continued absence from duty, but he managed to hold onto his offices. 
From 1771 to 1794 Power lived successively in Stephen's Street and Kildare Street, Dublin; he was well known as a connoisseur of the fine arts in Dublin. It was thought that he would probably receive a peerage in 1791 but this came to nothing. A contemporary described him as 'a morose, fat fellow, affecting to be genteel: he was very learned, very rich, and very ostentatious' (Gilbert, 3.290). Much of his fortune came from the lucrative office of usher of the court of chancery, a position mainly remunerated by interest which accrued on lodgements in the court. In a case between the duke of Chandos and his tenants, Power was entrusted with a large sum of money lodged by the tenants under a court order. After several years the tenants won and were declared entitled to the fund. Power returned the principal but, in right of his office, withheld the interest, which amounted to almost $3000. The tenants presented a petition against this to the lord chancellor, John Fitzgibbon, who ordered Power to appear before him on 5 February 1794 to explain his actions. Power remonstrated strongly against this summons, claiming that as a judge he should not be subject to such an indignity, but the chancellor insisted on seeing him. An arrogant man, Power had often clashed with the equally arrogant Fitzgibbon, and the prospect of appearing before him threw him into a panic. According to one account Power then decided to murder Fitzgibbon (Daunt, 2.146), and drove to his house at Ely Place with a pair of loaded pistols in his pockets. Not finding Fitzgibbon at home Power then resolved on suicide; friends believed that two recent bouts of illness had also influenced his resolve to die. 
On Sunday 2 February 1794 he spent the morning arranging his papers and made his will. Accompanied by his groom he rode to Dublin's South Wall, one of his favourite rides, where he dismounted and instructed his servant to walk the horse to Ringsend to await his return. Power waited until he was alone, then filled his pockets with pebbles, walked into the sea, and was drowned. It was said that he carried an umbrella to protect himself from the rain as he walked off the pier. His body was discovered next day on the strand, near the Pigeonhouse. Although it was widely known in Dublin that he had committed suicide, the coroner's jury recorded a verdict of accidental death. His fortune was estimated at $60,000: he left $10,000 of this to Lord Macartney, his patron in the Townshend administration, and, as he had no children, the remainder went to his nephews. His elder brother, Ambrose Power of Barretstown, had been killed by the Whiteboys in 1775; his younger brother, John Power of Tullamaine, co. Tipperary, was aide-de-camp to Lord Clive at the battle of Plassey.

St Leger, Anthony (bap. 1731, d. 1786), army officer and racing enthusiast, was baptized in February 1731, presumably at or near Grangemellon, co. Kildare, the fourth of five sons of Sir John St Leger (died 1743) of Grangemellon, twenty-eight years a baron (or judge) of the Irish exchequer, and his second wife, Levinia, daughter of Kingsmill Pennefather of Cashel, co. Tipperary; Arthur St Leger, first Viscount Doneraile, was his uncle. Educated at Eton College between 1745 and 1748, St Leger entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1750 but left without taking a degree. On 21 August 1754 he was gazetted sub-lieutenant in the 2nd troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, before transferring to the 3rd King's Own dragoons as a captain-lieutenant on 25 December 1755. On 5 May 1756, as a captain, St Leger took command of the regiment's newly raised troop of light dragoons. The British army's light dragoons, which placed a premium on horsemanship, were rapidly established as an elite force by their actions during the Seven Years' War, and in June and August 1758 nine troops, drawn from nine different cavalry regiments and including St Leger's, took part in combined operations against the French coast at St Malo and Cherbourg. When in 1760 John Manners, marquess of Granby, offered to raise a new regiment of 'light armed cavalry' called the Royal Foresters, St Leger was selected by him as one of three field officers, each of whom was recommended as 'being such as are well affected to His Majesty, and are most likely by their interest and connections to assist in raising the said corps' (TNA:PRO, WO 4/60, 434-5). The new regiment was taken onto the establishment as the 21st light dragoons, St Leger being gazetted major on 5 April. A number of his old command transferred to the 21st light dragoons alongside him. 
The Royal Foresters never saw action and on 13 February 1762 St Leger took the opportunity to secure further advancement by becoming lieutenant-colonel of the 124th regiment of foot. When, with the ending of the Seven Years' War the following year, this regiment was disbanded, St Leger retired to civilian life with his new wife, Margaret (died 1776), daughter and coheir of William Wombwell of Wombwell, Yorkshire, whom he had married in October 1761. In 1765 he purchased the estate of Park Hill at Firbeck in the West Riding of Yorkshire. St Leger now entered politics and, with the marquess of Granby's support, was returned unopposed to parliament in 1768 for the borough of Great Grimsby. He sat for six years and although he was never reported as having spoken in the House of Commons, he voted throughout for the opposition. The one exception was on 8 May 1769 during the debate over the Middlesex election when, in an echo of the notoriously indecisive conduct of his patron Granby on this issue, he voted for the government. 
St Leger's chief claim to fame, however, is as a racing enthusiast; his Park Hill estate even had its own racecourse. In 1776 he had the idea of a 25 guinea sweepstake for three-year-old horses run over 2 miles. The inaugural race, held on Cantley Common outside Doncaster, was won by a horse owned by the great whig magnate Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham. Two years later, on the eve of the third running, when it was suggested that the race should be named after him, Rockingham is said to have replied: 'No, it was my friend St Leger who suggested the thing to me -- name it after him' (St Leger, 66). The St Leger stakes, run annually at Doncaster racecourse, remains, in the first decade of the twenty-first century, one of five British classic flat races. 
Although St Leger had been promoted colonel in the army on 29 August 1777, it was only in 1779, after the entry of France and Spain into the American War of Independence, that he resumed his active military career. Just as the marquess of Granby had done nineteen years previously when he raised the Royal Foresters, his son Charles Manners, fourth duke of Rutland, offered to raise a regiment at no expense to the government. As before, St Leger was given an appointment, this time as colonel (gazetted 30 September 1779). The unit was subsequently taken onto the army's establishment as the 86th regiment of foot. In April 1780 St Leger sailed with his new regiment to the West Indies, where he eventually took command of the forces on the island of St Lucia. When, in May 1781, St Lucia was menaced by a French fleet under the comte de Grasse, St Leger's 'most soldierly dispositions' ('Annual Register', 24, 110) proved sufficient to deter a serious attack. Promoted major-general on 19 October 1781, he was to remain in the West Indies for the rest of the war, the request made by him in February 1782 to be allowed to return to Europe for the sake of his health having been refused by the government. 
The 86th regiment of foot was disbanded after the peace of 1783 and St Leger went on half pay, but in 1785 he received a position as a general officer on the staff in Ireland, where the duke of Rutland was now viceroy. He died on 19 April 1786 in Dublin, and was buried in St Anne's Church, Dublin. As he had no children, his nephew John Hayes St Leger ['see below'], succeeded to his estate and an income of $2000 a year. 


With the end of the Seven Years' War the 95th regiment was disbanded. Barrimore St Leger may now have returned to Cambridge, as he was elected Ramsey fellow at Peterhouse in 1763. Although promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 25 May 1772, St Leger did not succeed to command of a regiment until he received the 34th regiment of foot on 20 May 1775. On 7 or 18 April 1773 he married Mary, 'nee' Bayley, Lady Mansel (died 1788), widow of Sir Edward Mansel, second baronet (died 1754), of Trimsaran, Carmarthenshire; they had no children. Lady Mansel had inherited her husband's estate and Trimsaran probably became their country residence, though they also had a London house in the parish of St George, Hanover Square. In 1776 St Leger led his regiment to combat the rebellion in America and was present during the opposed landings at Trois-Rivieres, Canada, on 8 June. St Leger's previous experience of warfare in North America then recommended itself to General Sir John Burgoyne in the planning of his 1777 campaign in the Hudson Valley: St Leger was given command of the secondary thrust in the Mohawk Valley. Advancing from Oswego, on Lake Ontario, on 26 July 1777, St Leger led his force of 340 regular troops, 360 provincials and Canadian militia, and 1000 Native Americans against Fort Stanwix, held by 750 Americans. The strength of the garrison and the fortifications surprised St Leger, and having failed to bluff the enemy into surrender by holding a review of his army within their view, he settled down to a siege. An attempt by 850 American militia under General Nicholas Herkimer to relieve Fort Stanwix was defeated at Oriskany on 6 August. However St Leger's Native American forces suffered heavy losses, and a simultaneous sortie by the besieged garrison against the British camp and the looting of their effects increased the disenchantment. St Leger's endeavour to stampede Fort Stanwix's defenders into surrender by suggesting that he might not be able to restrain the Native Americans from massacring the Mohawk Valley's civilian population was rejected with contempt. His small calibre artillery had no effect on the fort's defences, and, when news came of the approach of another American relief force under Benedict Arnold, the Native Americans, alarmed by an exaggerated report of enemy numbers, deserted 'en masse'. St Leger was forced to withdraw on 22 August. Retracing his steps to Canada, he was unable to unite with Burgoyne's main force before the latter's surrender at Saratoga on 17 October. The most recent historian of St Leger's expedition suggests that its British commander suffered from a drink problem. 
Barrimore St Leger spent the remainder of the American War of Independence in Canada, commanding troops at Sorel and St John's. He was promoted colonel on 17 November 1780 and, in October 1781, led a 1000-strong force to Crown Point to make contact with Vermont separatists, a negotiation brought to an abrupt end by news of the British defeat at Yorktown. In November 1784 he succeeded General Frederick Haldimand as commander of British troops in Canada; but suffering ill health, and without waiting for orders, he resigned his command the following year and retired from the army. He then disappeared and even his elderly wife was forced to draw up her will in March 1787 on the assumption that he was dead. St Leger, however, reappeared either shortly before or immediately after his wife's death and proved her will on 8 November 1788. On 12 May 1793 he married, at the abbey church, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Frances Lindley, his long-standing companion, with whom he had two children, John Lindley St Ledger ('b'. 'c'.1766, died in or after 1804) and Catherine (1782-1801). He died at Worksop on 26 December 1793 and is commemorated in the abbey church by a memorial. His son received a commission in his father's old regiment, the 34th foot, in 1787, and was transported in 1797 after supporting the United Irishmen in Armagh. He fled Australia in 1804 and was not heard of again. 
Anthony and Barry's nephew, 
By now, at least, St Leger was solvent, having in 1786 inherited his uncle Anthony's estate. After returning to England in 1787 he was reappointed to the prince's household, as well as receiving a commission as captain and lieutenant-colonel of the 1st foot guards. In 1791 he was elected to parliament for the borough of Okehampton, leaving behind him the political hooliganism that six years before had seen him lead a whig mob in smashing the marquess of Buckingham's windows. By 1793, as the whig split became increasingly apparent, he gravitated towards the duke of Portland's wing of the party; he stood down from parliament three years later. St Leger's military interests were instead now uppermost, and having accompanied the duke of York to Berlin in 1791, he became the duke's deputy adjutant-general, and later barrack-master, during the Flanders campaigns of 1793 and 1794. A brevet colonelcy in 1793 was followed by promotion to major-general on 26 February 1795, while St Leger's brief period as lieutenant-colonel of the 16th light dragoons in 1794-5 gave way to a colonelcy of the 80th regiment of foot on 16 June 1795. In August 1796 St Leger sailed to take command of the troops at Trincomalee in Ceylon. He died, unmarried and childless, at Madras on 31 January 1800 following a convulsive fit; his estate passed to his brother, Anthony Butler St Leger.

Gooch, Sir William, first baronet (1681-1751), army officer and politician in America, was born on 21 October 1681 in Yarmouth, the son of Thomas Gooch (died 1688), alderman of Yarmouth, and Frances (died 1696), daughter of Thomas Lone of Worlington, Suffolk. Orphaned before his fifteenth birthday, he forged a close bond with his brother Thomas Gooch (1675-1754), who became bishop of Ely in 1748. He attended Queen's College, Oxford, for a time, and at the age of nineteen was commissioned a junior officer in the army. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-13) he served with the duke of Marlborough in the Low Countries, and was present at the battle of Blenheim (1704). In 1714 he married Rebecca Staunton (died in or after 1751) of Hampton, Middlesex; they had one son. A year later he rendered important service against the Jacobites in the highlands uprising, and was promoted to the rank of major. 
In the next few years Gooch discovered -- like many another eighteenth-century British officer -- that promotions in the peacetime establishment were excruciatingly slow. Frustrated, he resigned his commission and settled in Hampton, hoping to secure some sort of governmental sinecure. By good fortune he obtained the patronage of the duke of Newcastle, secretary of state for the southern department, who controlled political appointments in the American colonies. In 1727 he was commissioned lieutenant-governor of Virginia, succeeding Sir Hugh Drysdale, who had died the year before. As actual colonial governors normally remained in England at this time, he assumed the duties of governor when he arrived with his family at Williamsburg in September. Thus he embarked upon a tenure as chief executive of Virginia that would last until 1749, a period exceeded in length only by that of Sir William Berkeley. 
Gooch's term of office was marked by great amicability between the governor, council, and house of burgesses. This was remarkable, given that relations between previous king's representatives and the people of Virginia had usually been anything but cordial. Gooch encouraged the burgesses to initiate legislation that they believed important for the development of the colony, and he established an informal political relationship with Virginia's gentry that was favourable to the development of self-rule in the province. He allowed the house of burgesses to take advantage of his acquiescent attitude to extend its own authority, and he evinced a sincere desire to support Virginia's interests at Whitehall. In 1746 he allowed the burgesses to appoint a commission for expending public revenues rather than attending to the matter himself. He thereby established a precedent that the burgesses tenaciously adhered to in later years. He also reinforced the notion that the burgesses rather than himself had sole authority to appoint the treasurer of the colony. His operative principle in handling potential political opponents was to 'kill [them] with kindness' and 'if possible, to avoid Displeasure'. He cemented his ties with the Virginia gentry by investing in land and iron mining in the province, and his son married a woman from Maryland. So effective was the collaboration between Gooch and the colony's leaders that near the end of his tenure the chief executive was able to report to his brother that he had 'ruled without so much as a murmur of discontent'. For their part Virginia's leaders were happy to co-operate among themselves and flatter Gooch in order to continue this trend. Moreover, the burgesses praised him as a faithful trustee of their ancient rights and privileges. Although he was not among the most politically influential of colonial governors with authorities in London, his relations with Newcastle and the prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, were close enough to give him some leverage. 
Upon his arrival in Virginia, Gooch had learned that the major concerns of the tobacco-growing gentry were depressed prices and a lack of market regulation for the golden leaf of their staple crop. Seizing an opportunity to cultivate the leaders of the colony, he proposed a measure that he believed to be in the best interests of the growers, the government and merchants in Britain, and his own tranquil administration. Warehouses would be built at state expense, wherein tobacco growers would store their crop and allow it to be inspected for quality. In order to reduce the possibility of politics intruding into the process, all members of the house of burgesses would be excluded from serving as inspectors. Tobacco that did not meet rigorous standards of inspection would be destroyed in order to improve and maintain the overall quality of the crop. Because Virginia suffered a serious lack of currency as a result of parliamentary restrictions upon the printing of money, certificates for the stored tobacco would be allowed to circulate as bills of exchange. 
Gooch realized that he must exercise considerable political acumen to get this measure enacted by the burgesses and accepted by the British government and merchants, for a similar earlier proposal by Governor Alexander Spotswood had been rejected. He corresponded with merchants and officials in England, overrode the concerns of customs officials, and persuaded the Board of Trade that the law would increase governmental revenues by improving the quality of the tobacco crop. Addressing planters who disliked the idea of destroying inferior leaf, Gooch wrote 'A dialogue between Thomas Sweet-Scented, William Oronoco, planters... and Justice Love-Country' (1732) to persuade objectors that the law would provide them with increased income because of better quality. In 1730 he prevailed upon the house of burgesses and council to enact the bill, thus confirming his abilities as a politician. He also proved to be prescient in his expectations of the law's economic benefits, for by the mid-1730s tobacco prices had risen and Virginia had entered an extended period of prosperity. He bolstered the colony's economic boom by encouraging the settlement of western lands, and with the approval of the government in London distributed millions of acres on the frontier to the Virginia gentry. 
Although Gooch earlier had resigned his army commission, he retained an interest in military affairs. In 1741, during the War of Jenkins's Ear (1739-42), he commanded colonial troops in a British expedition under the leadership of Admiral Edward Vernon against Cartagena, a Spanish stronghold on the Caribbean coast of South America. Although Vernon commanded 28,000 men and expected to compel the surrender of Cartagena with ease, half his men died from virulent fever and Spanish gunfire, and he withdrew without accomplishing anything. Gooch himself was severely wounded by a cannon-ball and contracted the fever that killed so many in the British squadron. Having returned to Virginia, he was rewarded for his services by being made a baronet in 1746 and by being promoted to major-general in the British army a year later. For years afterward he suffered from the debilitating effect of his wound, and soon was so impaired by rheumatism that he had difficulty in maintaining the responsibilities of his office. In addition he was afflicted in spirit by the deaths in quick succession of his son, grandson, and brother-in-law. In the summer of 1749 he resigned as lieutenant-governor of Virginia and returned to England. For the next two years, he unsuccessfully sought reimbursement for expenses that he had incurred in the Cartagena expedition. He also failed to secure a new position in government. He died at Bath on 17 December 1751, while taking the waters in an attempt to restore his failing health. He was buried in Yarmouth. Goochland county, Virginia, which was formed in 1728, was named in his honour.

Booth, Bartholomew (bap. 1732, d. 1785), Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster, was born at Mellor, Derbyshire, where he was baptized in the village chapel on 7 October 1732, the son of Bartholomew Booth (died 1750), the village schoolmaster. His family appears to have belonged to a cadet branch of the Booth family of Dunham Massey, Cheshire, earls of Warrington and barons Delamer. Taught initially by his father, Booth continued his education at Manchester grammar school from 1750 to 1752 before taking up a temporary post as usher to the schoolmaster at Marple, Cheshire. He married Mary Chatterton (died 1789) of Marple on 6 March 1753, and from 1754 was a student at Brasenose College, Oxford, which he left in 1756 without taking a degree. 
Appointed master of the charity school at Disley, Cheshire, in 1756, Booth served as a deacon at Disley before his ordination as a priest at Chester on 2 July 1758 and his appointment in 1760 as curate of Marple chapel. When his wife's growing mental instability intensified shortly thereafter, he separated from her and took custody of William and Robert, the elder two of their three sons. After a series of brief curacies in Derbyshire -- at St Alkmund's, Derby, in 1762 and Brassington in 1764 -- and an equally brief period as second master of Derby grammar school in 1763-4, he moved to Liverpool, where he opened a private academy on the waterfront in 1765. There he quickly gained the patronage of two wealthy sisters, Mary Valens (1740-1810), who thereafter became his 'constant companion', and Anne Bardsley (1732-1781), a young widow. With their assistance, both financial and domestic, Booth opened in 1766 Woolton Academy, a boarding-school located at Woolton Hall, near Liverpool. There he and his assistant master, Peter Newby (1745-1827), offered an unusually wide and enlightened curriculum, comprising English grammar, Latin, Greek, French, German, writing, arithmetic, merchants' accounts, geography, navigation, astronomy, surveying, mathematics, drawing, perspective, music, dancing, and fencing. This type of education, which echoed much of Benjamin Franklin's educational philosophy, attracted the sons of the landed and mercantile classes from all parts of England and from North America, among whom were the future bibliophile George Hibbert (1757-1837) and the future general and MP Isaac Gascoyne ('c'.1760-1841). 
After selling Woolton Hall in 1772, Booth moved his academy briefly to High Beach in Essex, before emigrating to Maryland with his two sons and two patronesses in the summer of 1773 to begin a new life away from the 'mean repinings' (Newby, 51) of his wife. Again with the financial assistance of his two female companions Booth purchased a substantial tract of land called the Forest of Needwood, near Frederick, in western Maryland, where he planned to spend the rest of his days quietly as a planter. Unusually for an Anglican clergyman, Booth identified with the republican cause at the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Following considerable pressure from certain of the American leaders who were aware of his sound reputation as a schoolmaster in England, he sought and eventually obtained extraordinary permission from the Maryland legislature to open at the Forest of Needwood an academy which operated from 1778 until 1785. To this school, which was one of the few in the emerging United States to exist without interruption throughout the war, significant numbers of prominent Americans sent their sons. Booth's patrons included General Benedict Arnold, Dr James Craik, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Morris, the financier of the revolution, Dr William Shippen, and George Washington, whose nephew and heir Bushrod Washington was Booth's student. 
Despite his close and unwavering identification with the republican cause, Booth, as a recent English immigrant, was viewed with suspicion by the local populace in western Maryland. He was eventually forced to move his academy in 1783 to a new estate in Maryland, close to modern Hagerstown, to which he gave the name Delamer. There his educational work continued until an unspecified illness led to his untimely death on or about 10 September 1785; he was buried on his estate a few days later. 
Booth's two elder sons perished at sea in the winter of 1785 'en route' from Maryland for Britain on a visit to their estranged mother and their younger brother, John. The latter emigrated to the United States in 1786 to claim his inheritance, but a considerable part of the schoolmaster's large estate, valued at $8445 in Maryland currency, reverted on his death to Mary Valens, who in 1786 married Booth's close friend and confidant General Horatio Gates (1727?-1806). 
Bartholomew Booth owed his success as an educator to a number of factors. His ability to combine skilfully all that was best in the classical tradition with the most useful elements of a 'modern' curriculum appealed greatly to enlightened parents on both sides of the Atlantic; and the substantial financial support of his two patronesses, combined with the continued support of a tightly knit, transatlantic, and largely masonic network of educational patrons, helped to give his work a prominence that it might not otherwise have enjoyed.

Kelly, (Martha) Emily (1872/3-1922), mountaineer, was the eldest sibling in a large family; details of her birth, parentage (and hence her maiden name), and education are not known. Growing up, she found herself responsible for 'more than the average girl's share of domestic duties' ('Pinnacle Club Journal'), and all her life she was known for her capacity for hard work combined with a natural organizational flair. These abilities stood her in good stead when later she became a businesswoman. By February 1917, when her will was drawn up, she was married to the celebrated cragsman Harry Mills Kelly (1884-1980), with whom she was living at Levenshulme, Manchester. She shared an office in Manchester with her husband, an insurance clerk. 
Pat Kelly began climbing at the beginning of 1914 and was apparently a graceful and bold balance climber. Her husband remarked that most of their climbing on local gritstone was done solo. She did so from choice -- wishing, as she said, 'to develop her own technique in her own way' (Clark and Pyatt, 159). Harry Kelly thought one of her most outstanding achievements was to climb solo Jones's route from Deep Ghyll in the Lake District; observers on Scafell pinnacle told him of their consternation on seeing this lonely figure coming up the arete. Friends described her 'indomitable will' and 'almost inexhaustible vitality', but also noted her warm-heartedness ('Pinnacle Club Journal'). 
Pat Kelly was dedicated to encouraging other women to overcome their natural timidity on rock. The idea of a women's rock-climbing club germinated naturally from this, and her drive and enthusiasm gradually brought it to fruition. Harry Kelly recalled how by 1920 their 'small office at 29 Fountain Street, Manchester, had become the seat of operations' (Angell, 3). A letter in the 'Manchester Guardian' announcing the proposed formation of a club for women rock-climbers was boosted by an appreciative leader written by C. E. Montague (himself a climber). The inaugural meeting of the Pinnacle Club, the first dedicated rock-climbing club for women, was held at Pen-y-Gwryd in north Wales on 26 March 1921; its entry requirement was the ability to lead a 'difficult' rock climb. The club started out with more than sixty members; its first honorary secretary was Pat Kelly, and Mrs Eleanor Winthrop Young its president. 
As a young woman in the early 1890s Pat Kelly had readily identified with the mood of awakening feminine consciousness. Influenced by such writers as George Eliot, the Brontes, and Olive Schreiner, she read a paper on Eliot before a local literary society in which she defended 'her kind from the cheap male sneer that woman's only place is at home looking after the baby' ('Pinnacle Club Journal'). But contemporaries took pains to stress that no sex antagonism or rivalry fuelled her convictions. It was just that, when climbing with men, women hardly ever got to lead or to master the finer points of route finding, technique, or responsibility. Mrs Kelly's ambition was to provide an atmosphere of encouragement in which women and girls could discover and develop their own skills. 
The accident which killed Pat Kelly occurred on 17 April, the last day of a club meet in north Wales at Easter 1922. No one saw what happened. She was discovered with head injuries at the foot of Tryfan, and with one boot missing, having fallen from apparently easy ground after other climbers had packed up for the night. She was taken to the Carnarvonshire and Anglesey Infirmary, Bangor, where she died from a fractured base of the skull on 26 April 1922, aged forty-nine. 
It mystified all who knew her how so sure-footed a climber as Kelly could have fallen in this way. But sixty-six years later, when the history of the Pinnacle Club came to be written, an explanation finally emerged. Its author, Shirley Angell, was told that some months after the accident friends of Pat Kelly found the missing boot jammed immovably in rocks by one of its front nails. She was known to be experimenting with a new pattern of nails that day. Unused to them, she must have caught her foot during descent and been thrown off balance. The boot was clearly wrenched from her as she pitched headlong. Those who made the discovery vowed never to speak of it during the lifetime of Harry Kelly or of the friend who had supplied the new nails for his wife.

Thompson, Dorothy Evelyn (1888-1961), mountaineer, was born on 29 May 1888 at 17 Colville Mansions, Kensington, London, one of two daughters and a son of Frederick Charles Thompson (died 1919), a civil servant in the India Office, and his wife, Eleanor Frances, 'nee' Wilson. With parents who were keen hill walkers, she first climbed in Perthshire during family holidays. On holiday in Wasdale, before the First World War, she met some serious rock climbers, and made friendships that led to her joining the Fell and Rock Climbing Club in 1919. During the war she joined the staff of a relief fund, and afterwards was for many years a secretary at the School of Oriental Studies in Bloomsbury. 
Dorothy Thompson was a frequent attender at the Fell and Rock Climbing Club's Easter meets, and went on to tackle climbs in Corsica and the Pyrenees before venturing into the Alps in 1920. There she met Joseph Georges, known as 'Le Skieur', climbed with him for many seasons thereafter, and went ski-mountaineering from 1933. In 1929 she was the first woman to ascend Mont Blanc by Brouillard Ridge and in 1934 she scaled the same peak by the Aiguille de Bionassay, pioneering the return by Peuteret Ridge, the only time it had been descended. She and Georges were an ideal climbing pair and led several parties in the Alps. A small person with a keen sense of humour, she concealed behind a very quiet exterior an indomitable will and purpose. She often led on glaciers, and as she was small and light her friends felt that it would have been easy to retrieve her if she fell into a crevasse. 
Thompson never married; during the 1920s she lived with her mother at Porchester Square, Paddington. Subsequently she moved to Sussex, where she could indulge her love of gardening and birds. She had begun working on a book of climbing reminiscences and completed it shortly after the Second World War. This was not a good time to find a publisher, and eventually she decided to have it published privately. By this time she was suffering from heart trouble and its attendant restrictions. She died at her home, Donnithorne, Station Road, Heathfield, Sussex, on 2 December 1961 and was cremated in Eastbourne. Her book 'Climbing with Joseph Georges' (1962) was seen into print with the help of the Ladies' Alpine Club and her friends. It captured the spirit of adventure during the inter-war years, when women were first accepted as equal partners with men, willing to share the risks and enjoyment of challenging the highest peaks.

Tullis, Julia Elissa May (1939-1986), mountaineer and climbing instructor, was born at 3 Kingsdown Avenue, Croydon, on 15 March 1939, the daughter of Francisco Juan Palau ('b'. 1896), who came from Spain, and his wife, Erica Julia Augusta, 'nee' Saucerotte, who was born in Germany. The couple had met and married while working in a hotel near Croydon, and went on to run a Basque restaurant in Knightsbridge, London. Julie (as she was always known) was their second daughter. Like other British children during the war, Julie and her sister, Zita, were evacuated out of the capital to escape the bombing. They stayed on a farm in Norfolk and adored the country life. Once the war was over, their mother took the girls abroad during most summers to see relatives scattered throughout Europe. Julie always said that driving in old cars (bought each year for the purpose) and camping along the way were what encouraged her lifelong wanderlust. 
Tullis, who attended Godolphin and Latymer School, Hammersmith, until she was seventeen, discovered rock-climbing as a teenager and spent most of her weekends either in the mountains of north Wales or on the sandstone outcrops of the Kent and Sussex border, a popular training ground for London climbers. In 1956, at High Rocks near Tunbridge Wells, she met Terence Michael (Terry) Tullis ('b'. 1935), the son of Frank Charles Tullis, originally from Fife. They married at Streatham on 7 November 1959 and had a son, born in 1962, and a daughter two years later; by then the Tullises were living in Groombridge, Sussex, where they ran the village shop and climbing cafe. 
Both Julie and Terry Tullis also worked as climbing instructors, mostly with school groups. Their students included young people with physical and mental disabilities, work for which Julie's patience and natural warmth made her particularly suited. She encouraged many able-bodied and disabled youngsters to widen their horizons, while at the same time her own confidence and horizons were widening with the discovery of budo. This combination of various martial art disciplines, including karate and aikido, transformed her attitude to life. The flexibility and mental strength she derived from it infused her climbing. It was not simply that practising slow, controlled movements improved balance and co-ordination, she wrote in her autobiography, 'Clouds from Both Sides'; with budo came an understanding that tiredness and pain do not mean that one has to give up. The body can go on. This truth subsequently saved her life on several occasions. 
In 1978, with their children in their mid-teens, the Tullises went on their first major climbing expedition, to Peru. Terry by this time was limited in what he could achieve, having suffered a horrific leg injury some years before, but Julie climbed two Andean peaks, Pisco (18,898 feet) and Huascaran Norte (21,800 feet), and her passion for high places was ignited. Forming a climbing partnership with the well-respected Austrian mountaineer Kurt Diemberger, a family friend, she turned her sights to the Himalayas. Diemberger, in a climbing career spanning thirty years, had already trodden the summits of five 'eight-thousanders' (the fourteen highest mountains in the world), two of them as first ascents. He was also a film-maker, and in need of an assistant. Julie set herself to become a sound recordist to be able to complement his camera work. It delighted them both how well they worked and climbed together, and in time, as they went from one Himalayan giant to the next, they came to be known as 'the highest film team in the world'. 
Their first joint assignment, to Nanga Parbat with a French expedition, was in many ways disappointing, as the leader -- having convinced himself Tullis must have lied about her altitude experience -- would not countenance her climbing above camp 1. Nevertheless, she found the mountain enchanting, and hoped to return. Their film picked up many awards. In 1983 they went to the Chinese (northern) side of K2 (28,250 feet) with an Italian party, and this time climbed together to 26,248 feet, the magic 8000 metre line. In addition they tramped many extra glacier miles exploring the empty valleys of this rarely visited side of the Karakoram and Aghil ranges. Within a year they were back on K2 with an international team, attempting the more frequented Abruzzi Ridge in Pakistan. This time their high point was 24,115 feet. Nearby Broad Peak beckoned. This was one of the eight-thousanders already climbed by Diemberger twenty-seven years before. He could not resist trying it again. When they came down from K2, he and Tullis decided to make a lightweight raid on its summit. They were, as Diemberger later wrote in his book 'The Endless Knot: Triumph and Tragedy on K2' (1991), 'probably the oldest couple climbing in the Himalayas', but after two months in the Karakoram they were at a peak of condition and acclimatization. They made it to the summit, only to be faced with a nightmare descent through unstable, new snow. They survived one avalanche and dodged others before getting down safely. 
The busiest year for Tullis and Diemberger was 1985, with attempts on Everest and Nanga Parbat. They made films of both trips, and also shot a delightful documentary of a remote Himalayan village tucked under the great peaks of Makalu and Everest. 'Tashigang: Tibetan Village between the Worlds of Gods and Men' went on to take a first prize at the annual Trento mountain film festival. When the opportunity came to return to K2 the following year, they jumped at it. Of all the high peaks they had come to know, the second highest mountain in the world was their 'mountain of mountains', and they welcomed another chance to climb it. 
The summer of 1986 proved a disastrous one for the eleven expeditions booked to attempt K2. Though some climbers reached the top, by the end of July six had died on the mountain. Two more perished in the first week of August. Meanwhile, those who still entertained summit hopes -- representatives from four separate expeditions -- were attempting the mountain simultaneously, Diemberger and Tullis among them. On 4 August they stood on top of K2, as did several of the others, including another Briton, Alan Rouse. Tullis's was the second British ascent of K2; no British woman had ever climbed so high. 
But it was late in the day, and disastrously late in the season. Five climbers made it back that night to camp 4 (still above 8000 metres), only to be trapped there by fierce storms. Diemberger and Tullis did not join them there until the following day, having survived a fall and been forced to bivouac on their way down. The storms raged on for days. Julie Tullis succumbed to high altitude during the night of 6-7 August 1986. She was buried in a crevasse at camp 4, with a memorial on the Gilkey Cairn below. Of the seven people marooned in that camp only two got down alive, Kurt Diemberger and Willi Bauer, on 11 August. 
Although Julie Tullis was undoubtedly Britain's most experienced female high-altitude mountaineer up to the time of her death, her achievements received little recognition in a climbing establishment that was all too ready to mark her down as a star-struck appendage of Kurt Diemberger. Yet her resilience and calm brought much to that partnership. For the style of mountaineering they preferred, they complemented each other perfectly, with Tullis providing a steadying foil for Diemberger's volatility. It is hard to believe that six major expeditions to the world's highest mountains and a lifetime's dedication to climbing would have been so lightly dismissed had she been a male mountaineer. Tullis's career as a high alpinist is the more remarkable for not having begun until her fortieth year. She was once asked if she felt it had all happened too late. 'Not at all', she responded. 'I think I am enjoying it more now than ever I would have done earlier' (personal knowledge). Most of her climbing partners were older than she was: Diemberger was seven years older. He was so full of vitality, she observed, that he would go on enjoying mountains and exploration for a long time. 'Age doesn't frighten me', she said, 'I just take each year as it comes' (ibid.). A commemorative campsite in memory of Julie Tullis was opened at Harrisons Rocks, Groombridge, near the home she shared with Terry, who survived her.

Whillans, Donald Desbrow (1933-1985), mountaineer, was born on 18 May 1933 at St Mary's Hospital, Salford, the first of two children of Thomas Whillans (1906-1986), a grocer, and his wife, Mary Burrows (1909-1985). He attended state schools in Salford and served his apprenticeship as a plumber, studying for but not completing City and Guilds Institute examinations. His early involvement in hiking began while he was at Broughton modern school. He joined the Boy Scouts, but also began a series of extended solo hikes in the Peak District. The hikes continued during his apprenticeship and he did his first rock climb in 1950, untutored and with completely inappropriate equipment, at Shining Clough in Derbyshire. 
Whillans became a very good climber very quickly, at a time when the sport was primarily a middle- and upper middle-class activity characterized by protracted apprenticeships. He first met Joe Brown ('b'. 1930), a jobbing builder, climbing at the Roaches (near Leek, Staffordshire) in 1951. The two went on to form through most of the 1950s a partnership, though not a close or lasting friendship, which had a revolutionary effect on British climbing. Climbing together, and with others, they created a series of British rock climbs that were of the highest quality and difficulty, especially given the equipment and technique available at the time. 
Later in 1951 Whillans, Brown, and ten others, mostly working-class climbers from Manchester, came together to form the elite Rock and Ice Club. The reputation of the club, and its members, lasted well into the 1960s and influenced several subsequent generations of climbers. These were the 'hard men' who made first ascents of climbs with reputations that terrorized other climbers, and who also knew how to look after themselves in a fight (Whillans's nickname, the Villain, derives from the latter). And Whillans was the 'hardest' of them all -- 'the 'ard little man in the flat 'at'. The short stature and stocky build of both Whillans and Brown led to some bizarre physiological theories regarding the physique necessary for climbing at the highest level. 
Whillans made his first trip to the Alps in 1952, and in the following years he was involved in a number of major first ascents and first British ascents. In 1953 he became a founding member of the elite Alpine Climbing Group, dedicated to raising the standard of British alpinism. On his first Himalayan expedition, to Masherbrum in 1957, he turned back just 300 feet from the summit after some extremely difficult climbing. On an expedition to Trivor in 1960 he suffered from a mild attack of poliomyelitis. But his account of his return trip ('Solo by motorcycle from Rawalpindi to Lancashire') is a small gem of adventure travel literature. The writing is understated and full of good humour, anticipating his subsequent lecture style, and leaving the reader wishing that he had written more. His autobiography ('Don Whillans: Portrait of a Mountaineer', 1971) was compiled with Alick Ormerod from a series of interviews. 
Between these two expeditions Whillans married Audrey Whittall on 24 May 1958. She was a cutter in a clothing factory, did some climbing with Don, and was invariably tolerant of some of the excesses of his social life. In 1960 they moved to Crawshawbooth in Rossendale, Lancashire, where Whillans had been evacuated for six months during the Second World War; and in 1976 they opened a guest house at Penmaen-mawr in Caernarvonshire. 
After the early 1960s Whillans did little serious rock climbing in Britain and focused on expeditions -- Aiguille Poincenot (1962) and the central tower of Paine (1963), both in Patagonia, and Gauri Sankar in the Himalayas (1964). The latter involved Whillans in some very difficult face climbing at high altitude, but he turned back before the summit because of avalanche risk and his partner's risk of frostbite. By the late 1960s he had visited the Andes (Huandoy) and Yosemite, California, worked as an instructor in Switzerland, was a popular lecturer, and had begun to design equipment (for example, the Whillans harness for climbing, and the Whillans box for camping in extreme weather). 
Whillans's greatest mountaineering success came in 1970, when he and Dougal Haston climbed the south face of Annapurna, the first major face climb on an 8000 metre peak. The following year he and Haston reached the highest point (27,500 feet) on the south-west face of Everest, but failed to reach even that height in bad weather on their return in 1972. He was involved in the ascents of Roraima (H. McInnes, 'Climb to the Lost World', 1974), and Torre Egger, and in attempts on Tirich Mir (1975), Shivling (1981), and both Cerro Torre and Broad Peak in 1983. It should be noted that all of Whillans's climbs were accomplished in spite of the fact that he suffered from vertigo. 
Whillans's achievements were honoured by his being given the freedom of the city of Salford on 29 July 1971. He was presented with a commemorative plate by the mayor of Rawtenstall on 23 September 1970, to celebrate the success on Annapurna. The British Mountaineering Council appointed him as a vice-president (1973-6), and subsequently put his name forward to be considered for a queen's honour. Dennis Gray, general secretary of the council from 1974 to 1989, suggests that Whillans was 'perhaps the greatest British mountaineer of his or any other generation'. However, Gray notes that his name was withdrawn from consideration by the prime minister's office after a drunken incident involving a fight with the police resulted in a large fine. 
Whillans's occasional bouts of misbehaviour, in part a result of drinking and a feisty nature, but also a consequence of his frequently being challenged because of his small size and large reputation, stand in stark contrast to his enormous good sense and competence as a climber and the great affection in which he was held, and is remembered. The repeated stories about Whillans reached mythical proportions. Mike Thompson's article 'Out with the boys again', on the successful Everest south-west face expedition in 1975 (an expedition to which Whillans was, perhaps unfairly, not invited) describes 'Whillans jokes': 'Happy hours were passed recounting those epics in which Whillans would gradually unfold an account of his rectitude and forbearance in the face of seemingly unbearable chicanery and provocation. Like some Greek tragedy the sequence of events would move inexorably to the inevitable, fateful conclusion. All such tales led to the same final and literal punch-line: 'So I 'it 'im'.' Examples of typical 'Whillans jokes' can be found in Tom Patey's 'A short walk with Whillans' (1963), Jim Curran's 'Whillans!' (1985), and Dennis Gray's 'Simply Whillanesque' (1993). But there are also many stories about aspects of Whillans's character and climbing ability that commanded enormous respect, such as the ones where he risked his own life in attempts to rescue others -- Brian Nally on the north face of the Eiger in 1962, Harish Bahuguna on Everest in 1971, and Mick Coffey on Torre Egger in 1974; and where he took care not to place others at risk by pushing for the summit when they were fatigued (for example Masherbrum, 1957). 
Don Whillans died of a heart attack while sleeping at a friend's house at 30 Bagley Wood Road, Kennington, Oxfordshire, on 4 August 1985. He had just returned from the Dolomites after another epic motorcycle journey, riding in rain from Paris to the channel. He was cremated at Bangor crematorium, north Wales. His wife, Audrey, scattered his ashes on Snowdon -- within sight of Clogwyn du'r Arddu, where he had made a number of his most significant rock climbs. The British Mountaineering Council started a Don Whillans memorial fund later that year -- including a 'Buy a pint for Don' appeal -- and purchased Rockall Cottage below the Roaches. Audrey Whillans, who first met Don at the Roaches, opened the climbing hut in his name in January 1993.

Haston, Duncan Curdy McSporran (1940-1977), mountaineer, was born on 19 April 1940 at 21 Dolphin Road, Currie, Midlothian, Scotland, the second of two children of Robert Bremner Haston (1900-1972), journeyman baker, and his wife, Margaret Curdy McSporran (1900-1967). He was educated at state schools in Currie and, an early beneficiary of British educational reforms easing working-class access to higher education, attended Edinburgh University in 1959 to read philosophy, but did not complete his degree. 
Youthful adventures on the Currie Railway walls were followed by Haston's first visits to the highlands while at West Calder high school. By the late 1950s he had become a serious climber on rock and snow and ice. He was part of the small group of Edinburgh climbers who helped to regenerate Scottish climbing at this time, and he made a number of important first ascents. Haston also began climbing in the Alps, and came to prominence with the second British ascent of the north face of the Eiger in 1963. 
At Easter 1965 Haston was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in the death of a hiker in Glencoe. He was charged with causing death by careless driving and served a sixty-day prison sentence. His friends disagree about the chastening effect of the incident, but he never drove again. Subsequently, Haston decided to devote himself to alpinism and began to spend the majority of his time outside the UK. 
Haston joined John Harlin at the International School of Mountaineering (ISM) at Leysin, Switzerland, where they planned a direct ascent of the north face of the Eiger. The successful ascent in winter 1966, on which he teamed up with a rival German group, made Haston famous, but Harlin fell and was killed when a rope broke during the climb (Gillman and Haston; Haston, 'The Eiger'). 
Haston took over from Harlin as director of the ISM in 1967, and carried out a series of major ascents (including first ascents and first winter ascents) in the Alps, and a notable early attempt on Cerro Torre (Patagonia, 1968), during the next three years. He met Anne Jennifer (Annie) Farris, an English registered nurse, at Leysin; they married on 8 October 1969. The marriage is given one line in his autobiography ('In High Places', 1972) which, characteristic of the terse style of writing he developed at university (cf. 'Nightshift in Zero', 'Edinburgh University Mountainering Club Journal', 1962), contains very few details of his private life. The elite French Groupe de Haute Montagne invited him to join in 1969, and Annie notes that he was 'inordinately proud' of being one of the first foreigners admitted. 
In 1970 Haston and Don Whillans (1933-1985) reached the summit of Annapurna via the south face -- the first major face route in the Himalayas. Midlothian county council presented him with an address on 19 May 1971, in honour of his mountaineering achievements; and he was also awarded the Royal Scottish Geographical Society medal. In 1975, during the south-west face expedition, Haston and Doug Scott became the first British climbers to reach the summit of Everest. This was the sixth attempt on the difficult high-altitude route (Haston had been on three of the previous attempts), and the best publicized, adding to Haston's fame. His other important ascents with Scott include Changabang (Himalayas, 1974), and the south face of McKinley (Alaska, 1976). 
Scott notes that Haston 'was very much like a Sherpa -- reticent, self-contained, economical in word and deed'; he 'never wasted a step'. Other views of Haston characterize him on the one hand as anti-social, critical, icy, and aloof, and on the other as a hard-drinking risk taker who, according to Jimmy Marshall, 'set out to test every transgression, every canon prevailing in climbing society'. His appearance also left a strong impression. Jim Gilchrist likened him to a rock star, and Dennis Gray to a Pre-Raphaelite poet. Robin Campbell recalled Dougal's 'long loping stride, narrow hips, wide shoulders, a lipless grin and bright blue bivouacked eyes' (Campbell). 
Dougal Haston died in an avalanche while skiing alone below the Col de Luisset, near Leysin, on 17 January 1977. The accident was foreshadowed in his novel 'Calculated Risk' (1979), which his girlfriend, Ariane Giobellina, typed up and sent to a publisher after his death. The title captures Haston's driving, single-minded, and self-reliant approach to climbing. He was buried in Leysin cemetery and is memorialized by a stone plinth outside the post office in Currie.

Boardman, Peter David (1950-1982), mountaineer and author, was born on 25 December 1950 at 19 Ack Lane, Bramhall, Cheshire, the second of two sons of Alan Howe Boardman (1920-1979), engineering executive, and his wife, Dorothy Griffiths ('b'. 1923), lecturer. From 1956 to 1969 he attended Stockport junior school and Stockport grammar school, and he subsequently went on to Nottingham University, where he graduated BA in English studies in 1972. He gained a PGCE in English and outdoor pursuits, with distinction, from University College of Wales, Bangor, in 1973. 
Boardman's professional life was as a mountain guide. In 1973 he became an instructor at Glenmore Lodge in the Cairngorms, where he met his wife, Hilary Eve Collins ('b'. 1951), a teacher specializing in outdoor pursuits and in teaching children with learning disabilities; they were married at her home town, Chester-le-Street, co. Durham, on 25 August 1980. In 1975 he became national officer of the British Mountaineering Association, based in Manchester. In 1978, after Dougal Haston's death, he was appointed director of the International School of Mountaineering in Leysin, Switzerland. Elected president of the British Association of Mountain Guides in 1979, he played an important role in that organization's entry into the Union Internationale des Associations des Guides de Montagne. A testament to his versatile skills comes from an elderly member of a trekking party in Nepal in 1980 (the only trekking party he ever led): 'I shall cherish the memory of a supremely gentle giant with panther-like tread, who led his motley flock (twelve of us) with patient humour and whose dreaming eyes, usually scanning the far horizon, still managed to keep an unobtrusive watch on the heads of the elderly. (private information)' Boardman began climbing while at school. After joining Stockport's Mynydd climbing club in 1966 he quickly became a proficient rock-climber on the traditional forcing ground of Derbyshire gritstone, as well as in the mountains of Snowdonia and the Lake District. He first went to the Alps in 1970, and rapidly established himself as one of the leading alpinists of the day, with a particular passion for the unfrequented big mixed routes of the Bernese Oberland. As well as climbing the north face of the Matterhorn he made first British ascents of the north face direct on the Olan, the Gervasutti route on the north face of the Breithorn, the north face of the Nesthorn, and the north face direct on the Lauterbrunnen Breithorn. 
Boardman's first visit to the greater ranges came with the 1972 Nottingham University Hindu Kush expedition, which made first ascents of five minor summits and climbed five new routes. Particularly noteworthy were alpine-style ascents of the north faces of the Koh-i-Mondi and Koh-i-Khaaik (also a first ascent of the peak). In 1974 a trip to Alaska with Roger O'Donovan yielded a first ascent of the south face of Mount Dan Beard. A trip to the Caucasus followed in early 1975. 
These early expeditions led to an invitation to join Chris Bonington's 1975 expedition to the south-west face of Everest. The military organization of the traditionally run expedition (which Boardman described in his diary as 'one of the last great Imperial experiences that life can offer') was a new experience for a climber specializing in fast alpine ascents, but he adapted well and was selected as a member of the second ascent team. On 26 September, two days after Doug Scott and Dougal Haston reached the summit, he left Camp 6 with Sherpa Pertemba, the expedition sirdar, Martin Boysen, and Mick Burke. Boysen soon turned back, but Pertemba and Boardman reached the summit at 1.10 p.m. While descending they met Burke heading upwards 30 metres below the summit. They waited for over an hour on the south summit for Burke, before blizzard conditions forced them to descend. Mick Burke was never seen again. Boardman and Pertemba only made it back to Camp 6 by the skin of their teeth. 
The following year Boardman teamed up with 
Joe Tasker climbed extensively in the Alps with Dick Renshaw from 1971 to 1975, with an impressive string of ascents that included the north face of the Eiger (in summer in 1973 and then in winter in 1974) and the east face of the Grandes Jorasses (which he considered one of his most memorable alpine climbs). In 1975 he and Renshaw made a pioneering and epic alpine-style ascent of the south ridge of Dunagiri (7066 metres) in the Garhwal Himalaya. 
The ascent by Boardman and Tasker in 1976 of the west wall of Changabang (6864 metres) in the Garhwal Himalaya (India) over a total of forty days is widely recognized as a major breakthrough in lightweight expedition climbing in the Himalayas. Boardman's account of the expedition, 'The Shining Mountain' (1978), was an immediate success in the climbing world and won the 1979 John Llewelyn Rhys memorial prize. In 1978 both men joined a small expedition led by Chris Bonington to the west ridge of K2 (8611 metres). The expedition was abandoned after Nick Estcourt was killed by an avalanche. In 1979 Boardman and Tasker teamed up with Doug Scott and Georges Bettembourg for another pioneering oxygen-free ascent of the north ridge of Kanchenjunga (8598 metres). The three British climbers all reached the summit, despite the fact that Boardman broke his ankle on the approach march. 
Boardman and Tasker went back to K2 in 1979 with Doug Scott and Dick Renshaw, but were beaten back by avalanches and bad weather. In 1980 Boardman made another fine alpine-style ascent of the west ridge of Gauri Sankar (7134 metres) in Nepal with John Barry, Tim Leach, and Guy Neidhardt. That winter Tasker joined an unsuccessful expedition to the west ridge of Everest, which led to his first book, 'Everest, the Cruel Way' (1981). In 1981 both men joined Al Rouse and Chris Bonington to climb Kongur (7719 metres) in China's Xinjiang province. 
Boardman's final expedition, and Tasker's, was to the north-east ridge of Mount Everest in the 1982 pre-monsoon season. The expedition was a small one: the other climbing members were Dick Renshaw and Chris Bonington. On their fourth foray onto the ridge the two men disappeared while attempting to climb the series of pinnacles below the junction of the north-east ridge with the original north ridge route. They were last seen alive on 17 May 1982, moving upwards at approximately 8200 metres on the north-east ridge of Mount Everest, some 600 metres short of the summit. Bonington wrote: 'Pete Boardman and Joe Tasker lost their lives on a climb they were superbly qualified to attempt and which they both deeply and maturely wanted to achieve' ('Alpine Journal', 1983, 286). Boardman's wife survived him. Tasker was unmarried. Both men wrote acclaimed books which were posthumously published: Peter Boardman's 'Sacred Summits' (1982) and Joe Tasker's 'Savage Arena' (1982). An appeal after their deaths led to the establishment of the annual Boardman-Tasker award for mountaineering literature -- a fitting tribute to two of Britain's leading mountaineers and authors.

Thomas Joseph Tasker (1948-1982), whom he had first met in 1971 on the north-east spur of the Droites. This was the beginning of one of the best-known and most successful climbing partnerships in recent British climbing history. Tasker was born at 3 Lee Smith Street, Hull, on 12 May 1948, the eldest son in the family of ten children of Thomas William Tasker, painter and decorator, and his wife, Elizabeth Duffy. At the age of thirteen he was sent to Ushaw College, a Jesuit seminary, where he was encouraged in his climbing by one of the priests. On discovering, at the age of twenty, that he had no vocation for the priesthood, he left Ushaw and went on to study at Manchester University, where he graduated in sociology in 1973.

Anthoine, Julian Vincent (1939-1989), mountaineer, was born at 249 Marlpool Lane, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, on 1 August 1939, the second of two children of Joseph Franklin Anthoine (1907-1972), carpet designer, and his first wife, Enid May Smith (1899-1944). He was educated at Bennett Street primary school and King Charles I Grammar School in Kidderminster, before leaving at sixteen to become a trainee manager in the carpet industry. His first climbing experience occurred during an Outward Bound course that was part of his management training. He began to spend spare time climbing in north Wales, and left the carpet industry after a summer climbing in the Alps to take a job as climbing instructor at Ogwen Cottage Outdoor Pursuits Centre in north Wales. 
In 1961 Anthoine hitch-hiked across Europe and Asia to Australia, where he took a variety of jobs. On returning to Britain in 1963, he married on 22 February 1964 Margaret June Golding ('b'. 1939/40) of Bangor, a hotel receptionist, the daughter of Roland Golding, a Post Office engineer. He enrolled at Coventry College of Education, where he completed his certificate in education in 1967. After teaching for one year in Sheffield he moved to north Wales, where he started a company (Snowdon Mouldings) which manufactured climbing helmets and other equipment. He also became a technical consultant for film and television productions, and worked as a safety officer, camera operator, and stunt double on such films as 'The Mission', 'Rambo 3', and 'Five Days One Summer'. His marriage was dissolved on 17 April 1968 and he married, second, on 25 January 1969 Jacqueline Marie (Jackie) Phillippe ('b'. 1944) of Nant Peris, a clerk, the daughter of John Arthur Percy Phillippe, an accountant. 
Anthoine's climbing career falls into two parts: in the 1960s he focused on technical rock climbing and alpine mountaineering in the European Alps, and during the 1970s and 1980s he went on expeditions almost every year to the mountains of North and South America, Africa, and the Himalayas. He made a number of first ascents of British rock climbs, the best-known being The Groove on Llech Ddu in north Wales. However, Anthoine's reputation as a mountaineer began to be established on his expeditions. While a number of the Himalayan expeditions were to relatively unexplored areas (such as Garhwal, Kishtwar, and Langtang), his more notable expeditions include Roraima in 1973 (MacInnes), Trango Tower in 1976, Ogre in 1977, Gasherbrum IV in 1978, and two attempts on the north-east ridge of Everest (1986, 1988). He was a climbers' climber, and his reputation as a strong and safe mountaineer might have remained within the closed world of mountaineering if it had not been for his friendship with the poet and writer Al Alvarez. He probably saved Alvarez's life on a storm-bound ascent in the Italian Dolomites in 1964, of which a fictionalized account ('Night Out') appeared in the 'New Yorker' in 1971. Alvarez's biographical profile of Anthoine ('Feeding the Rat', 1988) also appeared in the 'New Yorker'. An extended version was published as a book by the same title, which derives from Anthoine's attempt to characterize his 'itch' for adventure -- his need regularly to feed the 'rat' that gnawed away at him. 
Anthoine's skill, modesty, and refusal to publicize himself were most evident on the Ogre ascent in 1977, when he and Clive Rowland effected an amazing rescue of Doug Scott (broken ankles) and Chris Bonington (broken ribs). In the blaze of media attention that followed, Bonington and Scott were identified as the heroes; Anthoine was content to remain in the background and take no credit. He was an amateur in the best sense of that term, and always emphasized the process rather than the outcome. Safety, the companionship of friends, and travel to and from the mountains were all more important than the summit. 'The Times' noted that his 'earthy humour [was] balanced by great warmth and inventiveness', and Ian McNaught-Davis, who gave the eulogy at his funeral, described him as a 'rich, generous and unpredictable character'. However, the 'earthy humour' could sometimes become cruel, and his 'unpredictability' included a very low tolerance for pomposity and officiousness. 
Mo Anthoine died of a brain tumour on 12 August 1989 at his home, Tyn-y-ffynnon, Nant Peris, Caernarvonshire, survived by his second wife, Jackie, and two children. He was buried at St Peris Church in Nant Peris on 18 August. At the time of his death, he and Joe Brown had started to use their experience to help organize expeditions for young climbers. Anthoine once told Alvarez, 'But to snuff it without knowing who you are and what you are capable of, I can't think of anything sadder than that' (Alvarez, 'Feeding the Rat', 158). In his short but full life he evidently fulfilled his ambition.

Bury, Charles Kenneth Howard- (1883-1963), mountaineer and army officer, was born at Charleville Castle, King's county, Ireland, on 15 August 1883, the only son of Captain Kenneth Howard-Bury (1846-1885), army officer, and his wife, Lady Emily Alfreda Julia (1856-1931), youngest daughter of Charles William Bury, third earl of Charleville. He had one sister, Marjorie (1885-1907). His mother had become heir to the estates at Charleville Forest, King's county, after the last of her brothers and uncles died in 1875, and the peerage became extinct. His father, a grandson of the sixteenth earl of Suffolk and Berkshire, assumed the additional surname of Bury after their marriage in 1881; on his death in 1885, Lord Lansdowne, viceroy of India and a relative, was appointed to be Howard-Bury's guardian. He was educated privately at Charleville, at Eton College, and at the Royal Military College in Sandhurst (1902-4). 
Howard-Bury joined the 60th rifles in 1904 and was posted to India, where he went travelling and big game-hunting. In 1905 he secretly entered Tibet without permission and was rebuked by Lord Curzon. His early travel diaries date from 1906 and show his keen powers of observation, encyclopaedic knowledge of natural history, and linguistic ability. In 1912 he inherited Belvedere House, Mullingar, co. Westmeath, from a cousin, Charles Brinsley Marlay. In that year he spent six months in the Tien Shan (Tianshan) Mountains. Although he prepared a draft book from his diaries, it was not published until 1990, as 'The Mountains of Heaven'. He resumed army duties in 1915 and commanded the 7th and 9th battalions of the King's Royal Rifles (dispatches seven times; DSO in 1918). He served at Arras, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Ypres, where he was captured; he remained a prisoner of war at Furstenberg until 1919. 
After the war the Royal Geographical Society was eager to attempt the ascent of Mount Everest, but political opposition from Tibet and from the British government remained an obstacle. In 1920 Howard-Bury travelled to India at his own expense to lobby the government of India. He met the viceroy and other British officials, including Charles Bell, the political officer in Sikkim, who shortly afterwards received permission from Tibet for an Everest expedition in 1921. Though not an experienced climber, Howard-Bury was offered the leadership of the first Everest expedition partly in recognition of his role in persuading British officials to obtain permission from Tibet. Howard-Bury led a diverse expedition of surveyors, climbers, and military officers, which achieved the goals of surveying Everest and finding a route to the summit for later climbers. He wrote 'Mount Everest: the Reconnaissance, 1921' (1922), which later appeared in French and Dutch and a shorter version in 1991. A variety of white primula discovered during the expedition was named after him, 'Primula buryana'. He was awarded the founders' medal of the Royal Geographical Society and gold medals from the French Geographical Society and Club Alpin Francais (French Alpine Club). 
The Everest expedition made Howard-Bury a public figure and in 1922 he was elected to parliament for Bilston (South Wolverhampton) as a Unionist. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the under-secretary of state for war from 1922 to 1924, when he lost his seat. He was elected as MP for Chelmsford in 1926, but retired in October 1931, after he inherited his ancestral castle at Charleville on the death of his mother. He served as deputy lieutenant and JP in co. Westmeath and also honorary colonel to the 85th East Anglian field brigade of the Territorial Army from 1927 to 1932. During the Second World War he was appointed an assistant commissioner of the British Red Cross. 
About 1940 Howard-Bury met Rex Beaumont (1914-1988), an actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company then in the Royal Air Force, who became his close friend and heir. In the post-war period Howard-Bury and Beaumont restored Belvedere House and gardens and built a villa at Dar al-Oued in Hammamet, Tunis. Dar al-Oued became a meeting-place for creative personalities and authors such as Andre Gide, Sacheverell Sitwell, and Dame Freya Stark. Howard-Bury and Beaumont continued to entertain many writers, explorers, politicians, and clerics at Dar al-Oued and at Belvedere, and became close friends with Colonel H. al Bourguiba, first president of Tunisia. The only known portrait of Howard-Bury was painted at Dar al-Oued by Paul Hannaux. He was 6 feet 2 inches tall, had the appearance of a distinguished gentleman, and was widely known as 'Monsieur Le Colonel'. Howard-Bury died of old age at Belvedere House on 20 September 1963 and was buried in his family's vault in St Katherine's Church, Tullamore. He bequeathed Charleville to a cousin and Belvedere to Rex Beaumont. He never married.

Lloyd, Robert Wylie (1868-1958), collector and mountaineer, was born at Grove House, Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Lancashire, the only son of John Lloyd, a calico printer, and his wife, Rachel Wylie (1844-1890). His grandfather was Nathaniel Lloyd, a successful calico printer at Church, Accrington. His father and mother separated, and he was brought up by his mother in reduced circumstances at Clapham. He started work as a clerk in Mincing Lane in the City of London, and by ruthless determination became a rich businessman, not only as managing director of his own company, Nathaniel Lloyd Ltd, colour printers and paper manufacturers, but also as a director of Druce & Co. Ltd, Chadwicks (Manchester) Ltd, cotton piece finishers, and Christie, Manson, and Woods Ltd. 
It was at Clapham that Lloyd first started to collect beetles and butterflies, of which he made an important collection, and it was in pursuit of his entomological interests that he climbed the hills of Norway, and there discovered the fascination of mountains. Lloyd made important ascents in the Valais, the Matterhorn, and Mont Blanc, accounts of which appeared in the 'Alpine Journal'. He travelled in the old style, with one or two first-rate guides, but after a serious operation had put an end to his own climbs he devoted his energies to raising funds for the expeditions of others, including the celebrated Mount Everest expedition of 1953. It was said that his assiduity in raising funds was matched only by his extreme reluctance to part with them. 
Lloyd was a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society of London from 1885 and a member of the Alpine Club from 1901. He was scrupulously honest but at the same time had a dour strain and a vein of ruthlessness in his character. He never married. He died in his chambers at 15 The Albany, Piccadilly, London, on 29 April 1958, and was buried, at his express wish, in his mother's grave in the necropolis, Glasgow. 
Lloyd's substantial collections of alpine books were left to the National Library of Scotland, his Swiss topographical prints and drawings and his Turner drawings to the British Museum, as were his Japanese swords and Chinese red lacquer. His entomological collections are at Manchester University. He was also a collector of Napoleonica -- he bequeathed a portrait of the emperor to the museums of France -- and he was known to express regret that Wellington had won at Waterloo. The variety of his collections provoked the opinion that he was essentially a collector of collections.

Rouse, Alan Paul (1951-1986), mountaineer, was born on 19 December 1951 at Highfield Maternity Hospital, Wallasey, the son of John Arnold Rouse (1924-1971), a clerk with the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, and his wife, Eve Kathleen, 'nee' Turner. Rouse, who shared a talent for mathematics with his father and younger sister, won a scholarship to Birkenhead School, and from there entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1970 to read mathematics. His interest in climbing began about 1968 with local rock-scrambling, but he soon developed the strength of hand and the techniques which, as a member of the local Gwydir mountaineering club, introduced him to numerous climbs in north Wales. By the time he arrived in Cambridge, where he became president of the university mountaineering club, Rouse had already conquered some of the hardest solo ascents in north Wales, had ventured into the Alps, and was forming climbing partnerships which endured throughout his life. 
The energy and enthusiasm he displayed in climbing were matched by Rouse's passion for life generally. His friend Geoff Birtles described his transformation at Cambridge: 'From a clean-cut bespectacled pride of school he entered the freedom of that flower-power age bedecked with all the long hair and trappings of Sgt Pepperdom, went wild for a while dabbling in the cults and grey customs of his time, climbing all the while, emerging at the end of growing up a respectable sort who still liked a good 'wheeze', which was his word, borrowed from a childhood comic, for having a good time or getting a good deal. (Birtles, 'Obituary', 16)' Unfortunately his preference for weekend climbing and 'ardent womanising' (Hall, 21) over study deprived him of the grade to which his ability would have entitled him: having taken a second in part 1A of the Cambridge mathematical tripos in 1971, he graduated with an ordinary pass degree. 
On leaving Cambridge in 1973 Rouse worked periodically as a schoolteacher, but increasingly spent his time on expeditions to remote parts of the globe. As a student he was already tackling serious winter climbs in Scotland, working his way round the Alps in both summer and winter, and had travelled to California to climb in Yosemite National Park. In Patagonia in 1973 bureaucracy proved more of an obstacle than the peaks, but plans were laid for another year. By this time Rouse was earning his living as a lecturer and writer, and as a consultant to the suppliers of mountain clothing and equipment. From time to time accidents and broken limbs briefly suspended his activities, but he was never deterred or prevented from joyously meeting further challenges. 
The major expedition to South America took place in 1977. Rouse, with a party of five climbing friends and several girls, climbed new routes in Patagonia, before rounding off their trip with a visit to Yosemite, after which Rouse did some guiding work in the Palisades. Turning east, he continued the alpine-style approach to high-peak climbing which he had pioneered in the Andes with his ascent of Jannu (25,295 feet) in the Nepalese Himalayas after the 1978 monsoon season. In the following summer a group climbed in the Peruvian Andes, and Rouse immediately went back to Nepal and continued to the Everest base camp, joining with others to force a new route up Nuptse. In 1980 he and Chris Bonington went to China, where they prospected Mount Kongur (25,325 feet) in the remote north-western Xinjiang province, and were the first to scale Sarakyaguqi (20,340 feet). Rouse led the British expedition attempting Everest under severe winter conditions, without oxygen or Sherpas; it failed to reach the summit, but an assault during the summer of 1981 on Kongur was successful. 
In 1983 an international group spent a considerable time in the Karakoram region, essaying various new routes, and with Rouse making his first attempt on K2 (28,250 feet, climbed by an Italian team in 1954) by a new route up the south ridge. Rock-climbing in Jersey during April 1984 was followed by a disappointing season in Pakistan, where Rouse's ambitions were defeated by bad weather. In 1985 a lecture tour of New Zealand provided the opportunity to climb in the New Zealand Alps. He was also elected vice-president of the British Mountaineering Council. 
The strong British team which went out to K2 in 1986 intended to attempt the first ascent of the north-west ridge, but was driven back by bad weather. It was a disastrous season, with several deaths already logged. Rouse and the film-maker Jim Curran stayed on after the rest of their team went home, and met people of other nationalities who were still on the mountain, tackling various routes with and without oxygen, and with one couple engaged in filming. On 4 August 1986 Rouse became the first Briton to reach the summit of K2, followed two hours later by Julie Tullis, but on the descent he and others were trapped by storms at camp 4, at about 26,250 feet, and were forced to spend several days at this dangerously high altitude without adequate supplies. When the weather improved, Rouse was too ill to move; on 10 August 1986 he was left there and is presumed to have died later that day. He was survived by his mother and sister, and by his girlfriend Deborah Sweeney, who gave birth to their daughter, Holly, three weeks later.

Marco Alexander Pallis (1895-1989), musician, mountaineer, and metaphysician, was born on 19 June 1895 at Tatoi, Aigburth Drive, Liverpool. His education included a brief spell (1908-10) at Harrow School. During the First World War he served as a second lieutenant in the Grenadiers on the western front, where he was seriously wounded. He then worked as a censor of letters. As Arnold Dolmetsch's guest in 1920 he munificently financed the new workshop at Haslemere, to the early music movement's great benefit, commissioning an entire chest of viols, a spinet, and a harpsichord, all of which he learned to play, and co-founded, with his inseparable friend Richard Nicholson, the Liverpool Consort of Viols. Discovering mountaineering, he equipped and led the 1933 Himalayan expedition to the Gangotri glacier (source of the Ganges). Gentle, compassionate, yet firm, and treating servants as equals, he became an admirer of Gandhi and of the eminent Buddhist traditionalist, Rene Guenon. In 1936 he revisited Sikkim-Ladakh, made the abbot of Lachhen his spiritual father, and became a convert to Tibetan Buddhism (as Thubden Tendzin), acquired fluency in Tibetan, meditated upon death and impermanence, and voiced loud opposition to the idea of a British school in Lhasa. His 'Peaks and Lamas' (1939) skilfully interpreted transcendental Buddhism to Westerners. From 1947 he and Nicholson based themselves in India to give Tibetans warning of the massive impending threat to their culture. When China invaded Tibet in 1950-51 the two men returned to England. Marco continued to perfect his 'marriage of wisdom and method' ('The Independent', 13 June 1989), aiding refugees and creating music, including an opera (never finished) about the Tibetan sage Mila Repa. He died at Eastbury Manor nursing home, Compton, Surrey, on 5 June 1989, following a stroke. He never married.

Thornely, Sir Arnold (1870-1953), architect, was born on 7 October 1870 at Green Hill, Godley, Cheshire, the second of the seven children of James Thornely ('b'. 1844/5), a cotton mill manager, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Harris ('b'. 1846/7). He was educated at Dunesville School in Birkdale, Tideswell grammar school in Derbyshire, and the Liverpool School of Art. Between 1887 and 1891 he was articled to the Liverpool architects Francis Usher Holmes and George Holme. Thornely then worked as an assistant to William Edward Willink (1856-1924) and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse (1860-1920), and two years later he was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1898 he began his own practice in Liverpool and in 1906 joined Frank Gatley Briggs (1862-1921) and Henry Vernon Wolstenholme (1863-1936) in partnership as Gatley, Wolstenholme and Thornely and later with F. B. Hobbs (1862-1944) as Hobbs, Thornely, Briggs and Wolstenholme. After the deaths of Briggs and Wolstenholme, Thornely continued in partnership (from 1925 to 1943) with his elder brother Herbert Lionel Thornely (1868-1944), with offices in the Royal Liver Building, Liverpool. On 28 August 1902 at St Paul's Church, Helsby, Cheshire, he married Caroline Thornely (1870-1962), daughter of Frederick Thornely, with whom he had two children, Ronald and Ethel Mary. 
Though Thornely is now best known for Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast, the largest part of his architectural career was spent in and around Liverpool, where in his several partnerships he was responsible for a number of prominent public buildings. With F. B. Hobbs he designed the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Building (1903-7), a large rectangular baroque block with four polygonal corner turrets and a central copper-covered dome. Now known as the Port of Liverpool Building, it was the first of three structures on the city's pier head, the others being the Royal Liver Building (1908-11, Walter Aubrey Thomas) and the Cunard Building (1914-16, Herbert J. Rowse), that subsequently formed a prominent city landmark widely known as the 'three graces'. This was followed by the Bank of British West Africa, or West Africa House (completed 1920, with Briggs and Wolstenholme), a Portland stone block displaying the American classicism then fashionable in Liverpool with Charles Reilly, the university's professor of architecture, and his students. American influences were again evident in the India Buildings (completed 1930, with Rowse), a nine-storey structure with Italian Renaissance detailing that occupied a complete block of the city. With Briggs and Wolstenholme, Thornely's other Liverpool designs included the Jane Herdman laboratories for the geology department of Liverpool University (1927-9) and a sizeable extension to the Walker Art Gallery (1931-3). Elected a fellow of the RIBA in 1907, he served on its council between 1910 and 1911, in which years he was also president of the Liverpool Architectural Society. 
Beyond the centre of Liverpool Thornely (together with Briggs and Wolstenholme) designed new premises for the Blue Coat School at Wavertree (1906) and King Edward VII Grammar School, Lytham (1908), as well as a series of private houses -- including his own, The Homestead, Mount Wood, Prenton, Cheshire -- and the town halls at Wallasey (1914-19), Preston, and Barnsley (both 1933). The latter project subsequently prompted criticism from George Orwell, who questioned why 'so many of the northern towns see fit to build themselves immense and luxurious public buildings at the same time as they are in crying need of dwelling houses' ('The Road to Wigan Pier', 1937, 61). 
Though many of Thornely's Liverpool commissions arose from his success in competition, his best-known work, Parliament Buildings, Stormont, was the result of a direct invitation in 1921 from the British first commissioner of works. This came a year after the 'Government of Ireland Act' had partitioned the island of Ireland and made it necessary for the newly created Northern Ireland to have its own parliament house, buildings for government departments, and a high court of justice -- the latter being designed by James Grey West (1881-1951) and built in central Belfast. Consideration was initially given to three other sites for the new parliament, Belfast Castle, Orangefield, and Belvoir Park. When Stormont Castle was put up for sale the Northern Ireland government purchased the 300 acre estate and house for $20,334 in December 1921. The original plan was for a classical style domed parliament house flanked by two government buildings (hence the plurality of its name), with Thornely responsible for the parliament and Ralph Knott -- architect of London's City Hall -- for the government offices. However, rising costs led the British Treasury to insist in November 1925 on a more modest design, in which Thornely combined the parliament and government offices in a single non-domed building while Knott oversaw the speaker's house on the Stormont site. The estate and grounds were designed by William Jackson Bean, a former curator of Kew Gardens, with the horticulturist Hugh Armytage Moore. The governor of Northern Ireland, James Hamilton, third duke of Abercorn, laid the foundation stone in 1928 and Parliament Buildings -- constructed by Stewart and Partners -- was occupied in April 1931 and opened by the prince of Wales on 16 November 1932. On the same day Thornely was gazetted a knighthood for his services to architecture and in 1933 he received the RIBA bronze medal for Ulster. 
Situated at the end of a three-quarter mile straight avenue, Thornely's Parliament Buildings was purposefully imposing and impressive. Articulating a 'sombre and dignified strength', the design derived from a Palladian house 'with the portico raised on a rusticated ground floor and the principal decoration concentrated about the first floor windows' (Dixon, 82). It is a building resplendent with Italian marble work, and dominated by a sculptured pediment above a portico with six Ionic columns rising through three storeys. The figure of Britannia flanked by lions surmounts a lavishly decorated attic storey and, like several of Thornely's other large-scale public buildings, it is strikingly faced in Portland stone. This aspect of the building was significantly altered during the Second World War, when, acting as an operations base for the RAF, Parliament Buildings was camouflaged with cow dung and bitumen, damaging the stonework and dulling its appearance. To 'The Times''s architectural correspondent Thornely's design was 'uncompromising, though not in the least aggressive', able to 'command respect rather than inspire architectural enthusiasm' (14 Nov 1932). 
Until prorogation in 1972 members of the Northern Ireland (Unionist) government regarded Parliament Buildings not just as the location of their parliamentary sessions but as a monumental architectural symbol underlining the connection of the state to Great Britain. This is most visibly expressed in the sculptured tympanum (designed, along with the rest of the statuary, by Thornely), which may be interpreted either as Northern Ireland handing the flame of loyalty to Britain, or Britain handing the flame of liberty to Northern Ireland. At the opening ceremony Lord Craigavon, Northern Ireland's first prime minister, described Thornely's design as 'a noble building... a symbol of the link between Great Britain and Northern Ireland', and 'a memorial not only to the distinguished Architect but also to the enterprise and skill of the Ulster working man' ('The Times', 17 Nov 1932). However, others were less welcoming. Parliament Buildings was widely criticized by contemporaries in Northern Ireland, both nationalists and independent unionists, with the Catholic 'Irish News' publishing a stinging political attack in a special supplement, 'The truth about Stormont' (January 1933), which condemned its expense at a time of severe depression. Opened only a month after the cross-community outdoor relief riots in Belfast, Parliament Buildings eventually cost $1,150,000. 
How Thornely's design has been viewed has been indelibly linked to Leonard Stansford Merrifield's statue of the former leader of Ulster Unionism, Edward Carson, which was unveiled in front of Parliament Buildings in July 1933. Merrifield also created the statue of Lord Craigavon installed at the top of the staircase in the main foyer in October 1945. Craigavon's sarcophagus was placed to the east of the building in 1940, an act that led his biographer St John Ervine to comment that one symbol of the Northern Ireland state's security had joined the other. Between 1973 and 1998 Parliament Buildings housed the Northern Ireland civil service and in 1995 the original Commons chamber was destroyed by fire. Subsequently remodelled, it has served as the chamber of the Northern Ireland Assembly since 1998. 
Sir Arnold Thornely spent his later life at Greystones, Eaton Park Road, Fairmile, Cobham, Surrey, where he died on 1 October 1953, survived by his wife and children. In its obituary 'The Times' noted that Thornely's architecture 'was distinguished by robust masculinity in the handling of the English Renaissance', but admitted that his style of classical architecture 'came at the end rather than at the beginning of a period' (3 Oct 1953). While his death merited only passing mention in the Belfast press Thornely's Parliament Buildings has been of lasting significance to Northern Ireland.

Armitage, Thomas Rhodes (1824-1890), campaigner for blind people, was born at Tilgate, Sussex, on 2 April 1824, the sixth of seven sons of James Armitage (1793-1872), a prosperous Leeds ironfounder, and his wife, Anne Elizabeth, 'nee' Rhodes. Edward Armitage, history painter, was his eldest brother. The family had largely detached itself from its industrial roots, and for much of his early life Thomas lived with them abroad: first in Normandy and from 1833 in Frankfurt. 
Armitage received his education at school in Offenbach and at the Sorbonne, before returning to study medicine at King's College, London, graduating MD from the University of London in 1852. He was licensed by the Royal College of Surgeons in 1848 and by the Royal College of Physicians in 1853. He probably practised initially in London hospitals, where he acquired a particular interest in the hydropathic treatment of fever patients; after studying this therapy in Paris and Vienna he published 'Hydropathy as Applied to Acute Disease' in 1852. He was for a period attached to the Marylebone dispensary, and then served as assistant physician in the civil hospital of Renkioi, in Turkey, during the Crimean War, before setting up in a successful private practice in west London. His inherited and professional wealth was further enlarged by marriage, on 29 November 1860, to Harriet (died 1901), daughter of Stanley Black; she brought with her an estate at Noan, near Thurles, co. Tipperary. They had two sons and a daughter. 
Armitage's career as a doctor was ended by 1866, when his sight -- which had been defective since his student days and perhaps earlier -- deteriorated to a point where he was unable to read. From this juncture he devoted himself to voluntary effort on behalf of the blind, and more especially to that large majority among them who suffered economic distress. He acted as a domiciliary almoner and committee member of an old-established evangelical charity, the Indigent Blind Visiting Society, and through this medium formed his own views on the education and welfare of the blind. In 1868 he recruited a number of blind friends and acquaintances in order to set up the British and Foreign Blind Association (BFBA), whose affairs he was to direct, as its honorary secretary, for the rest of his life. 
The association was to be chiefly identified with the promotion of Braille as a system of relief type for the blind, and the production of literature and apparatus to this end. Its earliest object had been to displace rival forms of embossed print in existing schools for the blind. It set out to create 'the public opinion of the intelligent blind' on the merits of different designs of embossed print by mobilizing a body of exclusively blind witnesses in a systematic process of adjudication (T. R. Armitage, 'The Education and Employment of the Blind', 2nd edn, 1886, 39). From the early 1870s, however, the BFBA embraced a second cause, that of improving the opportunities of remunerative employment among adult men who had lost their sight, whether in childhood or maturity. In the case of the former Armitage urged the large potential of the field of music and piano tuning, 'certainly the most profitable as well as the pleasantest occupation open to the blind' (T. R. Armitage, 'The Condition of the Blind in Great Britain and Ireland', 1878, 10). During the 1880s he engaged in a third campaign, to support the labour of self-employed blind home workers through the 'Saxon system' -- a machinery of aftercare, developed in Germany, that centred on the technical institutions that had trained the blind as adolescents. 
On all these fronts the success enjoyed by the BFBA was principally owed to Armitage's own exertions. It was he who drafted its reports; produced most of the copy for its periodical, 'Progress'; made rounds of visits to blind educational centres throughout the United Kingdom, in Europe, and the USA; delivered papers to international conferences, recruited patrons and corresponding members; and provided a substantial part of its financial support. His most important publication, 'The Education and Employment of the Blind', issued in two editions in 1871 and 1886, was at once a manifesto and a record of the association's aims and activities. It was Armitage, too, who, on behalf of the BFBA, organized the funding of what became the Royal Normal College for the Blind, conceived primarily as an advanced school of music. He persuaded the American teacher of music to the blind, Francis Joseph Campbell (1832-1914) to become its principal when the college opened in 1872. Over the following years Armitage was said to have donated almost $40,000 to the school's funds. His public standing was marked, in 1886, by his appointment (alongside Campbell) to represent the blind on the royal commission chaired by Lord Egerton of Tatton 'to inquire into the condition of the blind, the deaf, and dumb of the United Kingdom'. The commission investigated the education of various classes of the disabled and reported in 1889. 
By his later years the most prominent public spokesman of the blind population in Britain, Armitage died of heart failure at Cashel, co. Tipperary, on 23 October 1890, a few days after his horse fell and rolled over him. He was buried at Noan. 
Although none of Armitage's pre-eminent goals had been wholly realized by the time of his death, they had all gained sufficient approval within the forum of blind charity to secure continued advance. The adoption of Braille for educational purposes made rapid progress in the 1880s, thanks to the increasing literary productivity of the BFBA. The Normal College had secured by 1890 the status of a premier music school, though it had not eliminated competition from other blind establishments. Aftercare arrangements for school leavers were endorsed by the royal commission, and effected gradually before the First World War. In all these enterprises, moreover, Armitage looked beyond national boundaries. He viewed the task of assisting the blind as one to be supported in every part of the world. The BFBA corresponded with institutions and fellow workers all over the world, converted Braille into several languages and alphabets, and supplied its books, music, and apparatus across the globe. 
Armitage's ideas on blind welfare were not static; he had the faith of a typical mid-Victorian scientist in the progressive influence of knowledge. But he adhered to some constant moral and intellectual convictions. The literacy of the blind he valued especially as a means to self-improvement, and hence to social acceptance. 'A man is isolated by everything which renders the acquisition of knowledge difficult and tedious, and his isolation is diminished by everything which facilitates his power of self-education' ('Education and Employment of the Blind', 41). But still more vital to the interests of the blind was their capacity to support themselves through work; and this outcome required an education wider than that provided by the conventional school fare. He urged that attention should be given to 'physical development, force of character, moral worth, absence of bad habits, knowledge of the world, insight into character' ('Progress', Nov-Dec 1886, transcript, 33). The social conditions of the blind would be improved, he believed, not by any concession of political or legal rights but by a consistent observance of generally accepted conventions of behaviour. He disapproved equally of mendicity, of the contraction of marriages between blind partners, of inattention to personal appearance and hygiene. 
In these respects Armitage's outlook was that of a member of that urban elite of philanthropic enterprise with which he was acquainted through his contacts with the Charity Organisation Society. On issues of blind education and employment he largely agreed with the society: that some part of instruction could be afforded in ordinary elementary schools; that technical education should be supported by state funds; that blind workshops should be assisted by the placement of government contracts. He was, on the other hand, more radical than most of his contemporaries in his approach to poor law reform, arguing that special workhouse accommodation should separate the aged and deserving blind from more disreputable paupers. In all this he conceived of a public and a voluntary sector co-operating to common ends. Philanthropic effort, selectively funded by public revenue, should continue to play a large role in the provision of services: for education, employment, pensions, home visiting. But he had little patience with small and inefficient agencies, or with charities conducted exclusively by sighted directors. 
Armitage was clearly a man of great energy and wide interests. His private journal reflected his taste for travel, and his constant appetite for information on subjects of farming and estate management, as well as on the administration and operation of schools and institutions for the blind. He immersed himself in the technicalities of stereotype printing, of the manufacture of relief maps and writing machines, as well as of the construction of Braille in English and other languages. He emerges as a man of gregarious and equable temperament, with close and loyal friends as well as strong family ties. 
Armitage was, at the same time, a paternalist radiating the confidence of personal authority. He ran the Indigent Blind Visiting Society and the BFBA almost as private feofs. The BFBA had its only office in his home, relied on the services of his own secretary, and consisted of a hand-picked executive communicating its actions to an inert membership. Its management was, on Armitage's death, passed to members of his family -- his brother as chairman, his widow as secretary. He can, in this sense, scarcely be termed the founder of the National Institute for the Blind, which evolved from his association only when it acquired leaders like Sir Arthur Pearson, more attuned to corporate life and with a greater flair for publicity. Armitage's achievements were the product rather of personal convictions and commitments; they testified to his own qualities: accumulated knowledge, pragmatic judgement, powers of persuasion, business capacity, and unremitting application. In the diverse and unregulated world of Victorian charity these were essential attributes.

Ghose, Aurobindo (1872-1950), politician and spiritual leader in India, was born at 14 South Circular Road, Calcutta, on 15 August 1872, the third son of Krishna Dhan Ghose (1844-1892/3), a civil medical officer, and Swarnalata Bose or Basu ('b'. 1852). He spent his first five years in Rangpur, Bengal. Their Anglophile father did not allow Aurobindo and his brothers to learn Bengali, and in 1877 sent them to a convent school in Darjeeling. Wishing one or more of them to enter the Indian Civil Service, Dr Ghose took his family to England in 1879 and left the boys in the charge of William Drewett, a Manchester clergyman. Swarnalotta, who gave birth to a fourth son, Barindrakumar, near London in 1880 (a daughter had been born in 1877), did not rejoin her husband on her return to India. Subject from 1873 to serious emotional disturbances, she soon lapsed into incurable psychosis. In Manchester Aurobindo was educated by Drewett and his wife. He won a foundation scholarship to St Paul's School, London, in 1884, a senior classical scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, in 1889, and passed the Indian Civil Service entrance examination in 1890. Two years later he was awarded a first class in the classical tripos, and passed the Indian Civil Service final, but feeling no call to the civil service, failed to attend the riding test and was rejected. 
Aurobindo returned to India in 1893, on obtaining a post in the service of the maharaja of Baroda. He worked in Baroda for thirteen years, in various administrative departments, as the maharaja's unofficial private secretary, and as a professor in the state's college. During these years he perfected his Sanskrit and Bengali, read voraciously in many languages, and wrote much poetry and prose in English. In 1901 he married a fourteen-year-old girl, Mrinalini Bose (1887-1918), in Calcutta. They spent little time together and had no children. 
Aurobindo had been opposed to the British government of India since his schooldays, but had no time for the moderate politics of the Indian National Congress. Six months after his return he began a series of articles condemning the Congress's tactics, and hinting that real political change could only come about through revolution. About 1900 he and his friends began organizing secret societies in Bengal and western India, with the idea of preparing the country for a general uprising. They made little progress until, in 1905, the British partition of the Bengal presidency for political and administrative reasons created conditions conducive to radical politics and revolutionary terrorism. Quitting his job in Baroda, Aurobindo went to Calcutta, working first as principal of the National College, and later as editor of the influential English-language daily 'Bande Mataram' (1906-8). Meanwhile a secret society, inspired by him but led by his brother Barindrakumar, began planning terrorist acts. Aurobindo was prosecuted for sedition in 1907 and acquitted. The next year he, Barindrakumar, and others were arrested in the wake of an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate a British judge. After a year-long trial, Aurobindo was acquitted for lack of evidence. He rejoined the national movement, speaking widely and editing the political and cultural journal 'Karmayogin' (1909-10). In February 1910, warned of a planned sedition prosecution, he left Calcutta for the nearby French enclave of Chandernagore, and in April sailed for Pondicherry, the capital of French India. 
In Pondicherry Aurobindo devoted himself to writing and to the practice of yoga, which he had taken up five years earlier. Now convinced that lasting social change could only come about by an individual and collective change of consciousness, he sought to put himself in contact with the 'supermind' -- 'the truth of that which we call God' (Sri Aurobindo, 'The Life Divine', 132) -- and to make it an effective power on earth. Between 1914 and 1921 he developed his philosophy in his new monthly review, 'Arya'. Grounded in Indian scriptural tradition -- which he interpreted in 'Isha Upanishad' (1920), 'Essays on the Gita' (1922), and 'The Secret of the Veda' (1956) -- and influenced by European evolutionary theory, it unites an Indian recognition of the primacy of the divine with a Western concern for this-worldly perfection. In 1920 Aurobindo was joined by Mirra Alfassa (1878-1973), a Frenchwoman of Levantine Jewish extraction, whom he recognized as his spiritual equal and gave the name the Mother. In 1926 he retired from public view, placing the Mother in charge of the ashram (spiritual community) that had grown up around him. During the 1930s and 1940s he carried on an enormous correspondence (published in 1970 as 'Letters on Yoga'), and revised his 'Arya' works for book publication. 'The Life Divine' (1939-40) was followed by 'The Synthesis of Yoga' (1948), 'The Human Cycle' (1949), 'The Ideal of Human Unity' (1950), and 'The Future Poetry' (1953). He also worked on his chief poetical production, the epic 'Savitri' (1950-51). Suffering from an enlarged prostate, he developed uraemia in 1950, refused major treatment, and died at his ashram, 9 rue de la Marine, Pondicherry, on 5 December 1950. Four days later his body was placed in a vault (samadhi) in the courtyard of the ashram, his passing mourned by thousands of followers. 
Fifty years later, Sri Aurobindo's influence is greater than it was during his lifetime. The Sri Aurobindo ashram is a flourishing community of 2000, with its own farms, cottage industries, schools, and research centres. Auroville, an experimental community founded by the Mother in 1968, attracts settlers inspired by his vision of a spiritually united humanity. More than a dozen of his books are continuously in print, and his complete works are being published in thirty-four volumes. His philosophy and politics are discussed in learned journals, and his teachings are an inspiration to tens of thousands of people in all parts of India and the West.
