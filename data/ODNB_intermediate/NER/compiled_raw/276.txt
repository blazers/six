Hamilton, Marguerite Alberta Cora (1907-1982), Hispanic scholar, was born of Anglo-French parentage in Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 11 June 1907. Her father, Robert John Nanco, was a barrister. She was educated in Trinidad to school certificate level; she then became a boarder at Notre Dame Girls' School in Clapham, London, where she gained the University of London general schools certificate, with distinction in French. In 1925 she was admitted to King's College, London, to read Spanish (with French subsidiary). She graduated with an upper second in Spanish in 1928 and a teachers' diploma in 1929. Her mentor, Janet Perry, encouraged her to begin an MA thesis on Juan de Valdes, which however remained unfinished. Rita Nanco went on to read French medieval literature at the Institut Francais in London, where she obtained the 'licence es lettres' (Lille), soon afterwards joining Miss Perry in the work of Westminster Tutors from 1934. On 13 July 1935 she married a barrister and professional transfer agent, Albert Cosmo Hamilton (1910-1999), at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Clapham. There were no children of the marriage. 
Rita Hamilton had the exceptional ability of becoming entirely trilingual in spoken and written English, French, and Spanish, skills that were put to good use in 1941 when, alongside her close friend Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson, later a distinguished economist, she began to undertake the vetting of recruits and other work for the Foreign Office, which continued after the war, when she always travelled abroad on a British diplomatic passport. At the same time she was giving evening classes at Birkbeck College for the remnant of the King's College Spanish department after the main part of the college had been evacuated to the University of Bristol in 1940. When it was reinstalled in the Strand in 1944, by which time she was estranged from her husband, she was appointed assistant in Spanish; she was promoted to assistant lecturer in 1949, lecturer in 1952, and senior lecturer in 1959. She was allotted more and more teaching in the growing honours school, while continuing to teach the subsidiary Spanish classes, and she became solely responsible for developing the medieval literature course. 
Mrs Hamilton (as she was known) was a firm believer in introducing undergraduates to detailed textual study of the 'Poema de mio Cid' (which she helped Janet Perry to translate into English) and Juan Ruiz's 'Libro de buen amor' in the first week of their university course. She taught with such intensity and enthusiasm that she inspired many of her students with a desire to undertake research at an early stage in their career. Rarely did she use written-out texts for her lectures, relying almost always on a few notes and the texts in front of the class, and frequently she did not complete her sentences, allowing her voice to rise dramatically to the point where her students felt they could complete them from their own newly acquired insights. It was indeed the art of a great teacher: to give the pupils the impression of making important discoveries and to leave the subject open-ended, with much still to be pursued. Ten of the twenty-four contributors to the Festschrift presented to her in 1976 had been her undergraduate or graduate students, and five of them had become university teachers of medieval literature, taking with them her methods and ideas. 
Hamilton's commitment to her teaching, her department, her college, and her university meant that she had little time to complete her own research, though she published articles of quality on Juan de Valdes, the 'Poema de mio Cid', and the 'Libro de buen amor', and brought out a revised version of the 'Cid' translation in the Manchester bilingual series in 1975 (as 'The Poem of the Cid'), which reappeared in 'Penguin Classics' in 1984 and was frequently reprinted. 
Tall and charming, with striking good looks, Hamilton was well known at academic conferences in Britain and abroad. She showed the utmost loyalty to five successive heads of department at King's and served on many committees. She had little taste for the cut and thrust of academic politics, though together with her colleague Rosalind Franklin she succeeded in the mid-1950s in a campaign to have the membership of the previously all-male senior common room overlooking the Thames extended to women. She was happiest in her role as 'mother of the Spanish department'. When she was suddenly afflicted by a stroke while lecturing in 1972, and was rushed to Westminster Hospital, she overcame its worst effects and insisted on returning to teach part-time in the session of 1973-4, declaring to her colleagues that after almost fifty years' association with the college she 'wished to leave King's on her feet' (private information). She was made a fellow of King's College in 1973, and retired in 1974. 
Hamilton's principal hobby was travelling in Spain and the Americas. When she joined a small group of medievalists to explore the Cidian routes in 1971 she proved to be an imperturbable voyager, and would stand entranced at important sites reading aloud from a battered copy of the 'Poema' while her harassed colleagues pored over inadequate maps. She often lent her splendid contralto voice to amateur performances in King's College, and attended operas at Covent Garden whenever she could. She had a quick mind, adept at solving puzzles, which she exercised daily by completing 'The Times' cryptic crossword during her short journey from Westminster Palace Gardens to the Aldwych. She once entered the Cutty Sark crossword competition and reached the semi-finals with ease, but her dislike of publicity led to her withdrawal from the final stages. Through her long connection with Westminster Tutors, for a time she regularly took tea at 10 Downing Street in order to brush up Mrs Attlee's spoken French for diplomatic visits. She became a close friend of Cardinal Heenan, and performed many charitable acts in secret; the spiritual and corporal works of mercy were for her to be carried out whenever the opportunity arose. She was devout in the best sense, and her devoutness was leavened by a keen, quite worldly, sense of humour. During the last years of her life she moved to the convent of the nuns of the Temple at 67 Holland Park, where she died of a ruptured aorta on 14 December 1982. After eight small bequests, including one to the Spanish department at King's College, London, she left the residue of her estate to the Catholic Crusade of Rescue, a Catholic adoption agency.

Ballard, Stephen (1804-1890), civil engineer, was born at Ivy House, Malvern, Worcestershire, on 5 April 1804, the son of Philip Ballard (died 1845), attorney, and his wife, Charlotte, 'nee' Bayliss (died 1846). His father had been bankrupted by a libel suit, and to help support the family his mother took in lodgers, one of whom, the marchioness of Donegal, provided Stephen with useful connections. He spent some years learning the horticultural trade with the firm of Lee and Kennedy in Hammersmith before taking an apprenticeship with the Cheltenham builder Henry Lucy. 
Through a contact with the Biddulph family of Ledbury, whose members included the MP for Hereford, Ballard was employed by the Gloucester and Hereford Canal Company first as its clerk and then its engineer. The canal project was stalled at docks on the outskirts of Ledbury, but he brought fresh enthusiasm to the undertaking, resurveying the remaining course of the canal, and securing a new act of parliament. The canal's final eighteen miles into Hereford were completed in 1845. This was followed by another waterway project, as resident engineer on the middle level main drain (1844) for land drainage in the East Anglian fens. Elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1837, he was transferred to membership of the institution in 1846, having contributed papers to the minutes of its proceedings and been awarded its Telford medal in 1842. 
Ballard's experience of the fens led to his employment by the railway builder Thomas Brassey on the construction of the Great Northern line between Biggleswade and Peterborough where, to stabilize the fugitive subsoil, he made innovative use of brushwood stacks to displace underlying water. After a few months of railway survey work in India in 1851 he was again taken on by Brassey in 1852 to help with the construction of the Danish Rhenish Railway which, between Utrecht and Rotterdam, also involved construction over peat. His next job was as a contractor for Brassey on the Worcester and Hereford Railway. Tunnelling through the very hard rock of the Malvern Hills was a major feat for which he used a steam drill. One of the lasting achievements of this line is the Ledbury viaduct, thirty-one arches long with elegant tapering brick piers 19 metres high. Finished on 12 June 1861, it required some five million bricks, which were made on site by his brother. 
Ballard's final undertakings were on the Ashchurch and Evesham Railway (1862), the Evesham and Redditch (1864) and the Bedford to London extension of the Midland Railway (1865). In 1854, aged fifty, he married Maria Bird ('c'.1829-1911), and with characteristic energy fathered eight children, of whom the youngest was the horticulturist Ernest Ballard ['see below']. Settled at The Winnings, Colwall, over the route of the Malvern tunnel, he established a fruit farm and later a successful cider vinegar making works. He was involved in the construction of Jubilee Drive, a route round the side of the Malvern Hills. To curb squatter encroachment on the hills he helped to secure the creation in 1884 of the Malvern Hills board of conservators. Though not formally religious, he was a man of natural piety; he had strong humanitarian interests, objecting to capital punishment, and was a benevolent employer, concerned for the welfare of his navvies. Perhaps in reaction to his father's weakness for the bottle he was a lifelong teetotaller. He died on 14 November 1890 at The Winnings, Colwall, and was buried on his estate in a spoil mound excavated from the air-shafts of his tunnels. He left extensive diaries, written in a shorthand, and notebooks in which he recorded extensive observations of nature. His nephew Robert Ballard (1839-1912) trained as a civil engineer under him and went on to undertake several important railway construction projects in Australia. Another nephew, Thomas Ballard (1836-1908), was a successful genre painter. 
The youngest of Stephen Ballard's eight children, Ernest Ballard (1870-1952), horticulturist, was born at The Winnings, Colwall, Herefordshire, on 2 May 1870, and briefly attended Malvern College (1885-6) before being sent to Mason College, Birmingham, during 1887-9 to study chemistry in preparation for a position in the family business, where he returned to work as a chemist and was engaged in commercial vinegar production for twenty-five years. On 3 October 1899 he married his first cousin once removed, Ella ('b'. 1870), daughter of Roger de Quincey, East India merchant. They had three daughters and a son. After her death he married later in life Marie Bland (died 1973). 
Ernest Ballard brought his scientific training to bear on his hobby, gardening, and became noted as a breeder of Michaelmas daisies, autumn-flowering hardy perennials that he considered had been unduly neglected by hybridizers. He was the first breeder to identify and then achieve the potential of the existing varieties of 'Aster novi-belgii' (Michaelmas daisy) to produce a wide range of colours. In 1906 he started his own nursery, enjoying early success with a double flowered plant, Beauty of Colwall, which was awarded a first-class certificate in the Royal Horticultural Society's aster trials of 1907, the only plant out of 300 aster cultivars to receive the award. In further aster hybrid trials he strove to develop a compact form, bigger double-rayed flowers of strong, bright colours and a stem some 21/2 or 3 feet long. 
As early as 1912 Ballard advertised the potential of Michaelmas daisies as an adornment to autumn gardens, valuable for their 'hardiness, ease of culture, variety of colour, habit and wild profusion of bloom' ('Gardeners' Magazine', 14 Dec 1912, 952), and during the First World War began to make his hybrids commercially available from his Old Court Nursery in Colwall. Over subsequent decades his varieties were always ahead of his rivals in their new shades of colour, flower size, and other characteristics. His habit was to name cultivars after family members: Marie Ballard, named after his second wife, had a double flower of dark lavender, the closest he achieved to the strong blue he particularly sought. 
Ballard's interests also included the alpine family and in pursuit of new varieties he travelled widely through the Alps, the Caucasus, and frequently to Corsica. In 1916 he bred a noted hybrid between two European species of hepatica he had collected which he called 'Hepatica x media Ballardii'. This, with its large, velvety, ice-blue flower, was a great success and a Royal Horticultural Society prizewinner. He hybridized new strains of ramonda ('R. myconis' for instance) and haberleas. He also experimented with varieties of aubrietias, iberis, hellebores, fritillaria, nerines, and cyclamen. He had success improving 'Echinacea (rudbeckia) purpurea' (the coneflower), producing a variety whose petals stood out more firmly called 'The King'. 
A familiar figure at the Royal Horticultural Society's autumn shows, where more than half of his ninety new varieties of Michaelmas daisies received awards of merit, Ballard was given in 1949 the Society's highest award, the Victoria medal of honour. Like his father he was an inveterate note taker, occasionally gathering his thoughts into books, such as 'Days in My Garden' (1919). His nursery became neglected as a result of manpower shortages in the Second World War, but it revived after the recruitment of Percy Picton as head gardener. Ballard moved to the nearby village of Staplow, Herefordshire, where he died at The Cottage on 30 March 1952. His speciality of flowering asters is maintained at the Old Court Nursery, which now holds a national collection of Michaelmas daisies. 
Ernest Ballard's daughter-in-law (Grace) Helen Ballard (1908-1995) was herself a horticulturist of note. Born at Culverwood, Waldron, Sussex, on 11 January 1908, the daughter of Arthur William Ranken, electrical engineer, and his wife, Sarah Kate, 'nee' Phillips, she married Peter Cecil Wilson, art dealer, on 10 January 1935; they had two sons. Following their divorce in 1951 she married in that year Ernest Ballard's son, Philip Ernest Ballard (1909-1987). Her special interest in hybridizing hellebores was said to have originated from her father-in-law's gift of four 'Helleborus orientalis' plants, two reds and two whites, which she planted in the famous shady north border on her farm at Mathon under the Malverns in Worcestershire. The results started her off on the work of the last thirty years of her life. Her vision was of large, bowl shaped, outward and upward looking flowers on a stem that would hold the flower clear of the foliage, with pure, strong colours. She was indefatigable, travelling in the Caucasus and around Europe for native specimens of the 'orientalis' type. She found new pure colours: a yellow from 'H. odorous', dark purples from 'H. torquatus', and greys and purples from 'H. purpurascens'. She hybridized with as large a gene pool as possible to retain vigour, and tackled the problem that hybridized change in hellebores is notoriously hard to stabilize. Her interest in 'H. niger' (the Christmas rose) led to a large flowered strain, and many crosses with 'H. lividus' and 'H. argutifolius'. After her husband's death she lived at Mathon with a companion, Joan Bridges, until her death, at the St Cloud Nursing Home, Callow End, Worcester, on 28 May 1995.

Hare, Richard Gilbert (1907-1966), Russian scholar, was born on 5 September 1907 in London, the second son and second child in the family of four sons and two daughters of Richard Granville Hare, Viscount Ennismore, later fourth earl of Listowel (1866-1931), and his wife, Freda (1885-1968), younger daughter of Francis Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone, second Baron Derwent. His brothers all enjoyed notable careers: William Francis Hare, later fifth earl of Listowel (1906-1997), as a Labour politician and colonial governor, John Hugh Hare, later first Viscount Blakenham (1911-1982), as a Conservative politician, and Alan Victor Hare (1919-1995) as an intelligence officer and chairman of the 'Financial Times'. 
The Listowel family estates included Convamore, Ballyhooly, co. Cork (which was burnt down by Sinn Fein in 1921), the Oxton estate in Devon, Kingston House at 3 Knightsbridge, London, and the houses in Ennismore Gardens, London, but Hare's childhood was largely spent at 14 Bryanston Square and with his maternal grandparents in the holidays at Hackness Hall, near Scarborough. A sensitive and shy child, he was sent to Rugby School to toughen him up. Not given to sports, he was unhappy there, but found encouragement from William Wymar Vaughan, the headmaster, who recognized the academic potential of his young pupil. Vaughan's wife, Margaret, had been a close friend of Virginia Woolf, and as a frequent visitor to the Vaughan household it was through their daughter, Janet (later Dame Janet Vaughan, the haematologist) and her fiance, David Gourlay, that Hare met the younger members of the Bloomsbury set in London in the late 1920s, and his future wife, the sculptor Dora Gordine (1895-1991). 
In 1925 Hare went to Balliol College, Oxford, to study philosophy, politics, and economics, and graduated with a first-class degree in 1929. There followed a period at the Sorbonne and Berlin University as a Laming travelling fellow. He entered the diplomatic service in 1930 and served as third secretary at the British embassy in Paris and then from 1932 at the Foreign Office. In November 1931 his father died, leaving the family property to the two younger brothers, John and Alan. However, Hare did receive an amount sufficient to give him independent means, allow him to travel to the exotic locations then fashionable in artistic circles, and enable him to resign his post at the Foreign Office in 1933. In 1934 he was writing from the Hotel Satrya, Denpasar, Bali, to Godfrey Samuel, the modernist architect, praising the beauty of 'this remarkable place' and complaining that 'it will probably soon be spoilt by Europeans' (Hare to Samuel, 7 April 1934, British Architectural Library, SaG/8/1). He also visited Dora Gordine and her first husband, G. H. Garlick (physician to the sultan of Johore), in Johore Bahru, Malaya. On his return to the UK he undertook the commissioning of a new studio house for Gordine from Samuel, on a plot in Hampstead. By June 1935 planning permission for the new house had been refused, Gordine's first marriage had failed, and she had returned to Europe. In 1935-6 Hare financed and project-managed without an architect the building of Dorich House (in Kingston Vale, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, on the edge of Richmond Park) for Gordine, to her own remarkable design. He and Gordine were married at Chelsea register office on 6 November 1936 and lived in Dorich House until their deaths in 1966 and 1991 respectively. 
Hare's Russian was excellent, leading to wartime service initially in the publicity department of the Anglo-Soviet relations division of the Ministry of Information. In 1944 he succeeded the spy Peter Smollett as director of the division. It was during this time that he decided to begin his collection of imperial Russian art. Berthe Malnick, who worked with him during the war and then as a colleague at the University of London, later wrote that Hare's 'work at the Ministry convinced him that the English public needed insight into Russia as much as Russians needed knowledge of Britain' (Malnick, 271). 
After the war Hare was invited to return to the Foreign Office, but decided instead to further his interest in Russian literature, art, and culture by translating 'Fathers and Children', 'A Nobleman's Nest', and 'Rudin' by Ivan Turgenev, one of his favourite authors, for Hutchinson (1947). Another translation undertaken in 1949 for John Lehman was 'Dark Avenues and Other Stories' by Ivan Bunin. Hare wrote in the foreword 'These stories... are mainly centred in erotic episodes, which provide vivid and disquieting glimpses into the recent Russian past and into a state of mind which seemed to accept the disintegration of Russian culture as a decree of fate.' In 1947-8 Hare was a Rockefeller Foundation fellow at the Hoover Institute, Stanford University, the premier resource at that time for Russian studies, and in 1949 he joined the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, as a lecturer. He became a reader in 1960 and holder of the first chair of Russian literature in 1962. In 1959 he was a visiting lecturer in Russian literature at the University of Indiana. 
Hare's first book, 'Russian Literature from Pushkin to the Present Day' (1947), was an introduction to Russian literature for a public that was newly interested in Russian culture after the wartime alliance. Other publications included 'Pioneers of Russian Social Thought' (1951), 'Portraits of Russian Personalities between Reform and Revolution' (1959), and 'Maxim Gorky: Romantic Realist and Conservative Revolutionary' (1962). Hare's affection for and sometimes exasperation with the Russian psyche shone through his very personal considerations of the work of Russian writers. His books received mixed reviews for their restrained but opinionated tone, but there was general acknowledgement of the breadth of his scholarship, drawn from material that had not previously been published in English. His last book, 'The Art and Artists of Russia' (1965), was a beautifully illustrated survey of porcelain, silver, icons, portraits, and other art in Russia before the revolution, and included many examples from his own by now extensive collection at Dorich House. It was panned as serious scholarship by Vera K. Ostoia in the 'Slavic Review', but well received by others and recommended by 'The Times' as a challenge to popular generalizations of Russian nineteenth-century art, and for its 'exceptionally clear and fine' illustrations ('The Times', 22 April 1965). Hare also wrote numerous articles for journals and other publications, including the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica', 'The Connoisseur', the 'Russian Review', the 'Times Literary Supplement', and the 'Royal Society of Arts Journal'. He regularly contributed articles to the 'Slavonic and East European Review', and was on its editorial board for some years. 
Hare was a sceptic and a committed modernist. A shy, gentle person, he lived chiefly for beauty, art, and his writing. He found in his wife, Dora, a lifelong companion who understood and admired his quiet personality, which provided a perfect foil to her energetic artistic zeal and exuberance. The name of their home, Dorich, was a conflation of their two names, and their life there was spent entertaining friends and collecting and making art. He died at Dorich House of a heart attack on 14 September 1966, without an heir and with a sense of estrangement from his family, leaving his widow to fulfil his wishes to leave Dorich House and his collection of imperial Russian art for the enjoyment of the British nation.

Stahl, Ernest Ludwig (1902-1992), German scholar, was born on 10 December 1902 in Senekal, in the Orange River Colony, the son of Philip Stahl, merchant, and his wife, Theresa. His parents had emigrated from Bavaria. He studied at the University of Cape Town (MA, 1925), was encouraged to come to Oxford, graduated from Wadham College with a first in German in 1927, then went to the universities of Heidelberg and Bern, where he wrote a thesis on the intellectual sources of the 'Bildungsroman', for which he was awarded his doctorate in 1931. He taught from 1932 to 1935 at the University of Birmingham before returning to Oxford in 1935 as a lecturer in German. That soon meant a wartime programme of thirty tutorial hours a week, which others might have built into a legend of pedagogic stamina but which Stahl characteristically deflated with the assurance that he always allowed himself a leisurely breakfast with the newspapers and never started teaching until ten. On 1 August 1942 he married Kathleen Mary Hudson (1918-1993), Africanist and daughter of John Adamson Hudson, shipping agent; there were no children of the marriage. 
In 1945 Stahl was elected a student (that is fellow and tutor) of Christ Church, Oxford, where his quiet sociability and gentle wit made him a popular figure among senior and junior members. There was at the time of his election more to restore than the inward-looking life of a college, and Stahl was one of a group who founded the Michael Foster scholarships to bring young Germans to Oxford at a time when the Rhodes Trust had not yet accepted Germany back into the fold. Stahl's attachment to Christ Church was such that he hesitated before taking in 1959 the university's highest post in his subject, the Taylor professorship of the German language and literature. The move to Queen's College, where the chair was attached, was not a wholly happy one. In ways untypical of Oxford there were persons there who created gratuitous unpleasantness for him. Others, however, showed him kindness, which he later remembered with a legacy to the college's social life. Yet he remained deep down a Christ Church man. 
Stahl's tenure of the Taylor chair confirmed his reputation, and in 1966 he was awarded the gold medal of the Goethe Institut, Munich. Goethe, Schiller, Holderlin, Kleist, and that whole high eighteenth century period of humane letters were the centre of Stahl's work, with poetry in general and Rilke in particular among the moderns forming a later accompaniment. Stahl's scholarship was not materially massive; his books -- 'Holderlin's Symbolism' (1945), 'Heinrich von Kleist's Dramas' (1948), and 'Friedrich Schiller's Drama: Theory and Practice' (1954), for example -- were compact and lucid. Of his teaching there were unanimously warm memories. He was the least schoolmasterly of teachers, gentle to a fault. His criticisms came in a tentatively voiced 'I wonder if you've thought of...'. In his doctoral seminar he would say, as if seriously locating the rash judgement of a first-year graduate in the history of scholarship, 'Some have held that view'. Just occasionally there might be a quiet but firm 'No'. The effect was proportionate. But his tolerance was rarely strained to that point. His was a sensitivity that respected others' sensitivities, as well as a modesty that genuinely shrank from obtruding his authority. He would return a draft thesis chapter with ample annotations, but with the spoken reminder that its author could always rub them out. 
It was all a lesson in how unassuming distinction could be. Not every academic refrains, in the natural flow of conversation -- or perhaps guiding the flow -- from telling his interlocutor where in the wider world he has lately been. Stahl's guest professorships, on the other hand, at Cornell, Princeton, and Yale, had to be unearthed in 'Who's Who'. Likewise he never name-dropped about the poets he knew -- W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas, Louis MacNeice, Stevie Smith. He had been a close friend of MacNeice's since their time as lecturers in Birmingham, and it was through MacNeice that his scholarship had its most considerable public impact, yet paradoxically without much public recognition. For the two-hundredth anniversary of Goethe's birth in 1949 MacNeice was commissioned to write a version of 'Faust' for the BBC Third Programme. The snag was his lack of German. What more natural than that he and Stahl should do it together? So in London and in a cottage in Provence Stahl 'plied Louis with synonyms and antonyms and with as many quotations and allusions as I could, however inadequately, muster, until he found what he considered the appropriate version or its near equivalent' ('The 'Faust' translation', 67-8). The 'however inadequately' is characteristic. With similar modesty Stahl turned MacNeice's deficiency into the advantage of a poetic empathy that could go its own way, 'freed, as he was, from the inhibitions of bilingual knowledge' (ibid., 68). Stahl's name, to his disappointment, did not figure alongside the poet's on the title-page of the book, apparently a decision of T. S. Eliot's as a director of Faber and Faber. Nevertheless MacNeice dedicated the book 'to my great friend E. L. Stahl who went through the German text with me line by line and without whom I should never have started, let alone ended, this translation'. 
Having lived latterly at 43 Plantation Road, Oxford, Stahl died on 14 September 1992 at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, of cerebrovascular ischaemia.

Gill, Austin (1906-1990), French scholar, was born on 3 September 1906 at 6B Northgate Street, Stockport, the second child and first son of Austin Gill ('b'. 1876/7), a cotton operative, and his wife, Ada, 'nee' Nuttall ('b'. 1880/81). His parents were also born in the Stockport area, though the family was originally from Ireland. His mother was a devout Catholic, but Gill rejected religious beliefs at an early age. 
The family moved to the village of Hawkshaw, near Bury, Lancashire, from where Gill attended Bury municipal secondary school before studying French at the University of Manchester. There he came under the influence of the eminent Romance philologist John Orr, to whose 'teaching, example and friendship' he later paid tribute ('Ramonneurs', viii). After graduating with first-class honours in 1928 he went to study in France, principally in Grenoble, but also in Paris. A strong football player, he played centre-half for the Grenoble club, who offered to pay him clandestinely to play for them as an amateur. He rejected this subterfuge, and a series of grants from Manchester allowed him to remain in France until 1933, obtaining a 'licence-es-lettres' and broaching some of his later research topics. 
In 1933 Orr moved to the chair of French at Edinburgh University and offered Gill a post as lecturer in the department, where he remained for the next ten years. In 1939 he was married in Oran, Algeria, to Madeleine Henriette Monier, 'nee' Troegeler ('c'.1915-2004), a north African-born Frenchwoman, who had a daughter, Helene, by her previous marriage. Madeleine was a teacher in the Edinburgh French department and after 1940 the representative in Scotland of General de Gaulle, a post that took this striking young woman to bleak military outposts on the Firth of Forth. Gill too was active in promoting Franco-British understanding, and in 1943 he was appointed British Council representative in French north Africa, which was now under allied control. The year he spent there saw the establishment of a provisional French government under de Gaulle against some opposition from the Americans and the British; setting up a British Council office in this environment was a delicate diplomatic task. Gill's work brought him into contact with French writers, notably Andre Gide, who wrote in his 'Journal' of the 'tres aimable Gill' (Gide, 'Journal II (1926-1950)', 1997, 996-7). 
After the liberation of Paris in August 1944 Gill was transferred to the French capital as acting representative of the British Council, and remained there for nearly a year. His successor wrote in a memorandum to the council that 'the retirement of Mr Gill, whose energy and experience have built up this office, leaves a gap which no one man can easily fill. He has worked under incredibly difficult conditions and has definitely placed the British Council on the Paris map. (Anthony Bertram, 8 Oct 1945, TNA: PRO, BW 31/13)' He organized a wide range of activities and brought to Paris the Old Vic, an acclaimed exhibition of children's art, and such figures of note as T. S. Eliot, Julian Huxley, and Henry Moore. 
In September 1945 Gill resigned from the British Council to take up a fellowship in French at Magdalen College, Oxford. During his years there the college was a place of high academic distinction, with such notable fellows as C. S. Lewis and A. J. P. Taylor. Unlike some of his colleagues Gill was not a larger-than-life 'character'; he impressed his pupils as a man like other men, who was also an inspiring tutor. They remembered his imposing physical presence, his high academic and moral standards, his courtesy, humour, and understanding, his love of France, and his deep knowledge of French language and literature of all periods. His interests stretched from the history of the language (in particular slang) and Saussurian linguistics to Renaissance and modern literature. Unusually, in the Oxford of his day, he spoke French impeccably and lectured in the language. 
From 1950 to 1954 Gill returned to Paris, having been offered the post of director of the British Institute, for which his combination of diplomatic and academic experience and his knowledge of French life and culture made him uniquely qualified. He turned down the offer of the post of adviser to the British embassy in Paris, preferring to return to academic life at Magdalen, where he acted for some years as vice-president. He was made CBE for his British Council work in 1955. In Oxford his combative character made him enemies as well as friends, and in 1966 he unexpectedly resigned to take up the Marshall chair of French in Glasgow. In his short time in Glasgow he made many institutional changes, completely revised the departmental syllabus, and was remembered for 'his dynamic leadership, his exacting standards, his great integrity, his mastery of the discipline and dedication to all things French' ('The Independent', 28 March 1990). 
Gill retired in 1971 in order to devote himself to writing, ably supported by his wife. Until then he had published little: an edition (1957) of 'Les Ramonneurs', a newly discovered, anonymous seventeenth-century comedy that he convincingly attributed to Alexandre Hardy; the general editorship of a three-volume textbook series, 'Life and Letters in France' (1965-70); and a number of articles in learned journals, concerned above all with the poet Mallarme. He had discovered Mallarme in Grenoble and been enthralled by the sound of his verse. He had first intended to elucidate the more famous later poems, but came to believe that it was essential to study in its own right the early work, in which the poet's method and beliefs were elaborated. The result was the two volumes of 'The Early Mallarme' (1980 and 1986), which distilled decades of detailed and wide-ranging research into Mallarme's early life and his intellectual and literary world, with particular stress on his rejection of Christianity. In his faithfulness to biographical research and his belief that 'in his poems Mallarme expresses ideas' (Barbier, 145) and that 'the obscurity of Mallarme's hermetic writings can in principle be dispelled' ('Mallarme's Poem', 6), Gill was a representative of the old philological school who found himself at odds with the critical tendencies of the 1980s. He disliked what he saw as the wilful obscurity of much Mallarme criticism and once wrote to a correspondent: 'For me the word 'crystal-clear' shines like a star. My firmest vow, as a scholar, made many years ago, is never knowingly to write obscurely about M[allarme] (or attempt to explain what I don't understand)' (Gill to John Cocking, 'c'. March 1980, Magd. Oxf., Gill papers, box 5). 
In his last years Gill's health declined sharply; he suffered a stroke and began to be affected by Alzheimer's disease. He died of bronchopneumonia in Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, on 21 March 1990 and was cremated in Glasgow, his ashes being scattered in a rose garden. He was survived by his wife, Madeleine.

Gallie, Menna Patricia (1919-1990), writer, was born at Dolycoed, Station Road, in the Welsh mining community of Ystradgynlais, Brecknockshire, on 18 March 1919 (though she celebrated her birthday on 17 March, and her year of birth has commonly been given as 1920), the youngest of the three daughters of Elizabeth, 'nee' Rhys Williams ('b'. 1883), and her husband, William Thomas Humphreys, a carpenter and for a time a colliery engine fitter. She came from a close-knit, chapel-going, Welsh-speaking family where 'Aunts stood around us like the Druid stones' (videotape, 1985, South Wales Miners' Library, Swansea University). She claimed that she was eight before she learned any English and that her monoglot maternal grandmother knew just two English sentences: 'I like ice cream' and 'Keir Hardie called me Comrade' (interview, 1984). Her maternal grandfather, Rees Rhys Williams, a collier and farmer, had helped to found the Labour Representation Committee in South Wales. She was proud of her socialist heritage: 'There was no question of one's politics. No other way of thinking -- you were a socialist' (ibid.). 
When Menna was seven the local community became engulfed in the general strike and its aftermath. This affected her deeply and later became the subject of her first novel, 'Strike for a Kingdom' (1959). As she admitted, her account of the village she called Cilhendre was partly autobiographical. This was a historical novel, a detective story, and an evocation of the rural-cum-industrial nature of the colliery communities of south Wales, as well as both a tragedy and a wickedly humorous tale. It calls for justice for a murder that reveals blighted lives and it demands justice for the miners. At its centre is a brilliant portrayal of a gentle miner-poet forced to re-evaluate his very title as a justice of the peace but a true dispenser of justice. Such figures were once a force in Welsh mining communities. Her central character was based on her uncle, William Rhys Williams (known as W. R.), a collier from the age of thirteen who attended Ruskin College, Oxford. Active in the South Wales Miners' Federation, he was also a magistrate, Independent Labour Party chairman, Labour county councillor, and poet. 
The Humphreys family moved to neighbouring Creunant in the Dulais valley when Menna was ten. She flourished at Neath Grammar School for Girls and went on to University College, Swansea, where she gained a degree in English. On 13 July 1940, a month after finishing her final degree examinations, she married a philosophy lecturer, (Walter) Bryce Gallie ['see below']. Five days later he left for the army. 
After war work for the Inland Revenue in Llandudno and London, Menna Gallie spent the rest of the 1940s back in Ystradgynlais. Here were born her two children, Charles and Edyth. The Polish-born artist Josef Herman was also living in the village. He became a friend and Gallie modelled for him. During the early 1950s, when W. B. Gallie had a chair at the University College of North Staffordshire, the family lived in the midlands. The second of Menna Gallie's six published novels, 'Man's Desiring' (1960), was loosely based on this experience and sought, less successfully than her first book, to explore another kind of community life as well as class and cultural differences between south Wales and England. She returned to the subject matter she knew best in her third novel (her personal favourite). The 'The Small Mine' (1962) portrays Cilhendre in the late 1940s. Its straightforward title stands out from her other book titles with their puns and literary allusions. With first-hand knowledge of the Swansea, Neath, and Dulais valleys and attention to men and women in the community, it is a valuable corrective to the dominant fictional representation of Welsh colliery society by male writers emphasizing the industrial and heavily populated Rhondda valleys further east and heroic, militant miners. 
Gallie wrote these three novels in co. Down, Northern Ireland, where the family lived in a house on the grand Castle Ward estate within sight of Strangford Lough. Her husband held a chair at Belfast, while she taught part-time at Orangefield Boys' Secondary School in Belfast, did voluntary work in Downpatrick, and guided visitors around the stately home of her neighbour the duchess of Bangor. She also typed up her husband's lecture notes. As her children grew older she gained more time to write. A consummate raconteur, Gallie appreciated the art of story-telling in Ireland. Alert to the similarities between Welsh and Irish place names and traditions, she found that the combination of place and space -- Celtic familiarity coupled with physical distance from Wales -- and the richness of linguistic expression freed her to become a writer. Yet she was aware of the irony: 'What I owe to Ulster is of course the peace I've found in this so-called violent country' (Menna Gallie papers, L1/9). 
Yet, like many aspiring women novelists, Menna Gallie initially lacked confidence in her ability to write books. 'Strike for a Kingdom' was written in just three months but languished in a drawer for a year before Bryce Gallie persuaded her to send it to a publisher. Victor Gollancz accepted it and then published four more of her novels. Harper and Row became her American publisher. 'Strike' was extensively reviewed on both sides of the Atlantic, translated into Japanese, and praised by Eleanor Roosevelt. The 'Herald Tribune' described Gallie as 'A born writer, indeed almost a poet' who 'seems to breathe her story, rather than manipulate it' (Menna Gallie papers, L4/1). Although her most enthusiastic following was in America (comparisons with Dylan Thomas, whom she knew, probably enhancing her reputation there), 'Strike' received positive reviews across the UK and was a runner-up for the Crime Writers' Association of Great Britain's prestigious gold dagger award. 
Gallie made broadcasts for the Northern Ireland Home Service and was active in PEN (Poets, Essayists, and Novelists), representing Northern Ireland at a PEN conference in Yugoslavia. In 1968 'Travels with a Duchess' appeared, a story of two women shedding inhibitions and indulging in holiday 'flings' in Dubrovnik. Her protagonists are middle-aged -- Gallie delighted in shocking and ridiculing convention. She also exposed such indignities as the obstacles facing married women on joint passports who chose to travel alone and so anticipated issues about to exercise the modern women's movement. She remained, however, wary of the feminist label even though her years in Cambridge (where this book was written) helped to make her in practice, if not name, a defender of women's rights. 
Menna Gallie had relished her years in Northern Ireland. She was less enthusiastic about the period from 1967 to 1978 in Cambridge, which was her one place of residence that did not become the backdrop for a novel. Admittedly the heroine of Gallie's next novel was a middle-aged Welsh widow and civil servant based in Cambridge, but she was seeking solace in Northern Ireland. 'You're Welcome to Ulster' (1970), with its explicit account of Sarah Thomas rekindling a relationship with a married man, reflected the sexual liberation of its time. It also heralded an approach that would become a trademark of the 1970s by bringing together the personal and the political. This was one of the first novels about the modern 'troubles' in Northern Ireland. Set where Gallie had lived, the action takes place in July 1969, culminating in the events of the twelfth. A blend of fact and fiction -- prefaced by an extract from the 'Special Powers Act' of 1922 -- it deplores violence and bigotry of any kind and affirms her commitment to constitutional socialism. For thirteen years she had been active in the non-sectarian Northern Ireland Labour Party. Written when the investiture of the prince of Wales was causing some unrest within Wales, 'You're Welcome' also addresses her concern about extreme forms of Welsh nationalist politics. 
The Gallies spent their last years in Newport, Pembrokeshire, in a house in Upper St Mary Street which they named Cilhendre. They entertained -- with customary verve -- a wide circle of friends. Menna Gallie had already produced a pamphlet, 'Little England's Other Half' (1974), about local customs, and translated Caradog Prichard's Welsh novel 'Un nos ola leuad' under the title 'Full Moon' (1973). Her last book, 'In these Promiscuous Parts' (1986), was published only in America (by St Martin's Press). Previous novels had been written retrospectively after leaving a locale. In contrast this was set in the rural community where she was now playing an active role. It lacked the punch of Gallie's earlier Welsh fiction, perhaps partly because she remained so close to her subject matter. She had written her earlier novels (not all of which were published) at speed. This book took shape slowly and with difficulty, exacerbated by her arthritis. 
Menna Gallie died of a stroke at home in Newport on 17 June 1990. She was cremated at Narberth on 22 June. Her reputation waned after her death but her writing has recently been re-evaluated. Now she is becoming recognized as one of the leading Anglo-Welsh women novelists of the second half of the twentieth century. Four of her novels were in print twenty years after her death. 
Menna Gallie was survived by her husband,

Tozer, Alfred Robert (1853-1906), fire officer, born in London on 22 December 1853, the eldest of five children of Alfred Tozer (1831-1911) ['see below'] and his wife, Jessica Louisa, 'nee' Brown (1832-1900), belonged to a noted fire-fighting dynasty. 
His grandfather Robert Tozer (1799-1877) was the first known fire-fighter in the family, having worked for the Hand-in-Hand Fire Insurance Company's fire brigade. From 1832 until his retirement in 1860 Robert Tozer was employed by the London Fire Engine Establishment. He was married to Maria, and had at least three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, 
Alfred Robert Tozer was raised at the Watling Street fire station in London, accompanying his father to numerous fires, including the Tooley Street disaster of 1861, where James Braidwood died. After his family's relocation to Manchester he became a general assistant to his father and acted as messenger boy for the Manchester Fire Brigade, running between stations to carry messages of fire. In about 1870 he served an apprenticeship at the works of a hydraulic engineer. Shortly afterwards he moved to London to work at the fire-engine manufacturers Merryweather & Sons, where he developed a working knowledge of fire-engine machinery. He married in London, in 1874, Charlotte Susanna (1849-1896), daughter of William Biddle, railway porter. They had six sons and three daughters. 
In 1876, at the age of twenty-three, Tozer successfully applied for the position of chief superintendent of Bristol Fire Brigade, which was a police fire brigade comprising police constables who assumed fire-fighting duties during emergencies. His experience in Bristol made him a lifelong opponent of the police fire brigade model, which he criticized as an inefficient and uneconomical use of public funds. Instead he advocated that large towns should be protected by professional fire brigades, independent of police control, and staffed by full-time fire-fighters. 
In 1879 Tozer applied for the position of chief superintendent of Birmingham Fire Brigade. Since 1874 the town had been protected against fire by an under-resourced police fire brigade, which ignominiously failed to rescue a family from a burning house in August 1878. In the aftermath of the fire the town council appointed Tozer, with a salary of $250, and gave him 'carte blanche' to reorganize the brigade along professional lines. Taking up residence at the town's central fire station on Little Cannon Street, Tozer systematically modernized the fire brigade during his first few years in office. Most of his ideas emanated from his observations of fire-fighting organization under his father. First the fire brigade was reorganized into four divisions to decentralize operations and speed up response rates, with hose carts adopted as the first line of attack. Other modern appliances purchased included a horse tender similar to that used in Manchester, a telescopic escape, and a plethora of stand and branch pipes, hand pumps, alarm bells, ceiling hooks, pocket lines, and axes, all designed to improve efficiency. Second, the retained men were all replaced by a permanent staff of fire-fighters, who underwent a period of probationary training. Third, he adopted the telegraph and street fire alarms to improve the brigade's responsiveness and flexibility. He also patented his own combined street fire alarm and first-aid box in 1892, which was adopted for use in the city. Fourth, he pressed the town council to build a new central fire station, which was opened on Upper Priory, adjacent to the newly developed Corporation Street, in 1883. 
Tozer's influence extended beyond Birmingham: he was president of the Midlands Fire Brigade Association (1884-7), which was amalgamated with other regional bodies in 1887 to form the National Fire Brigades Union, which lobbied government to make fire-fighting a statutory duty of local authorities. He was also a founder member of the Association of Professional Fire Brigade Officers in 1902, which was a driving force behind the service's professionalization during the first half of the twentieth century. In 1903 he was elected an honorary vice-president of the association as a celebration of his contribution to the service's development. To mark his invention of an ambulance cart operated by fire-fighters Tozer was also made an honourable serving brother of the order of St John in 1897. 
Like his father Tozer preferred to hire a combination of former sailors and artisans as fire-fighters. He believed that sailors were qualified for fire-fighting work because they were used to living in barracks, climbing to great heights, working under intense weather conditions, and obeying orders. Between 1880 and 1920 roughly half of all the men appointed by Birmingham Fire Brigade were recruited from the Royal Navy. Artisans, particularly slaters, builders, carpenters, and roofers, also made good fire-fighters because they had a good local knowledge of building construction and were generally suited to the physical demands of fire-fighting. 
Tozer caught a chill in March 1906 while directing his men at a fire. This, combined with a protracted liver infection, caused his death, at the central fire station, Birmingham, on 25 April 1906. His funeral three days later was described as 'one of the most imposing spectacles ever witnessed in Birmingham' ('Fire and Water', June 1906, 52). The cortege was headed by an escort of firemen followed by the city's police band. The coffin, along with his helmet, belt, and axe, was carried on a fire tender. The lord mayor and numerous aldermen, councillors, and officials were present, as were the chief officers of various provincial fire brigades. In his address the Revd J. D. McCready described Tozer as 'a hero imbued with the spirit of a Nelson' (Ewen, 93). 
Alfred Robert Tozer was a central figure in the building of a professional fire service in provincial England. His greatest achievement was in training a generation of fire-fighters who, through their work in the midlands and elsewhere, moulded the service's development as a branch of local government during the twentieth century. Four of his sons became serving fire-fighters. The eldest, also Alfred Robert Tozer (1875-1944), joined Birmingham Fire Brigade in 1892 and was promoted assistant engineer in 1896, chief clerk in 1898, and second officer in 1901. He succeeded his father as chief fire officer in June 1906, and continued to superintend the brigade until his retirement in November 1940. William Tozer (1877-1936) also served in Birmingham Fire Brigade until his appointment as chief officer at West Bromwich in 1900, where he worked until his death. Charles Wright Tozer (1879-1940) joined Birmingham Fire Brigade in 1900 and in 1906, on his brother's promotion to chief officer, became second officer, a position he held until his retirement in 1938. The youngest son, Frederick Noble Tozer (1888-1973), joined Manchester Fire Brigade in 1911, where he continued to serve as a station officer during the mid-1930s. The younger Alfred Robert Tozer's son, another Alfred Robert (1899-1968), also served as a fireman in Birmingham Fire Brigade, joining in 1915 and rising to third officer in 1926.

Alfred Tozer (1831-1911), fire officer, was born at Horsleydown, Bermondsey, Surrey, on 13 June 1831 and joined the London Fire Engine Establishment in 1851. During a celebrated career in London, he was the first fireman to receive the medal for gallantry from the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire for saving two lives in a fire in 1853. In that year he married Jessica Louisa (Jessie) Brown. He volunteered to become officer in charge of fire protection at Scutari Hospital in the Crimean War, taking charge of a manual fire engine and a crew from the London Fire Engine Establishment and collaborating with Florence Nightingale. In 1860 he was promoted to chief engineer at London's Tooley Street fire station, working directly under James Braidwood. In 1862 he was appointed chief superintendent of Manchester Fire Brigade, which he reorganized. Previously the Manchester force comprised men who worked in other occupations; Tozer created a body of permanently employed firemen, and improved their equipment, inventing a small hand pump. Even during major fires, which he attended in his customary dress of bowler hat and long macintosh, he appeared unruffled, and his orders were clear and short. Although fearless, he was never reckless, and despite his brusque manner he was popular with his men. Combining administrative skill with the ability to handle an emergency, he was described as 'one of the great firemen of the world' ('Manchester Guardian', 6 Jan 1911). After his retirement in August 1892 he went to live on the Lancashire coast, where he died at his home, Morecambe View, Knott End, on 4 January 1911.

But Panchanan and Joyram had to leave their properties at Gobindapore when the British decided to build Fort William at that site. Joyram was compensated with the contract for building the fort, and the family was given land in the part of Calcutta called Pathuriaghata, near the river. There they built a mansion still known as Tagore Castle and a family bathing 'ghat' or pool.

In 1765 the two brothers fell into a property dispute, as a result of which Nilmoni left home to find a niche elsewhere. He built a modest house in Mechhuabazar in north Calcutta and added to it after Darpanarayan gave him his legitimate dues from the family property. This became Jorasanko House. The Tagore family was thus bifurcated into the Pathuriaghata branch under Darpanarayan and the Jorasanko branch under Nilmani.

Prasannakumar left seven lakhs of rupees for religious and educational purposes, including the endowment of a law professorship at Calcutta University. He was as famous for his library of law books at Pathuriaghata House as his brother

Sourindramohan Tagore (1840-1914), were leading men in the world of theatre and music besides remaining powerful landholders. Jotindramohan was given the titles of raja bahadur, maharaja, and maharaja bahadur. Sourindramohan earned a doctorate in music from the University of Pennsylvania in 1875 and was the author of 'An Universal History of Music' (1896). 
At Jorasanko House Nilmoni left three sons, Ramlochan Tagore (died 1807), Rammani Tagore (1759-1833), and Ramballav Tagore. Rammani's son Dwarkanath Tagore (1794-1846) was adopted by Ramlochan, who was childless. Dwarkanath's meteoric career took him from Bengal to Europe. He turned himself into an independent merchant at a time when wealthy Indians in the mercantile professions worked only as 'banians' to European firms. In 1834 Dwarkanath Tagore chose to retire from his high post as 'diwan' of the board of customs, salt, and opium and launched the firm of Carr, Tagore & Co. He was congratulated by the governor-general, Lord William Bentinck, for being the first Indian to start an Indo-British commercial enterprise. The firm supplied indigo and silk, and did business in coalmining, shipping, insurance, and banking. Dwarkanath Tagore added spectacularly to the family estates and had many successes on his tour of Europe in 1842, when he dined with Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace, and had audiences with the pope in Rome and with King Louis-Philippe in Paris. In his own country he was Rammohan Roy's dedicated partner in founding the monotheistic Brahmo Samaj, in abolishing the rite of 'suttee' or widow burning, in sponsoring the Landholders' Society for monitoring the government's land legislation, and in championing freedom of the press. After his death 'The Times' of London asserted that 'his name will be proudly associated with all the noble institutions flourishing in Calcutta' ('The Times', 3 August 1846). He was popularly known as 'Prince Dwarkanath', both for his great generosity and for his high style of living. He entertained his European guests lavishly, and acquired a suburban house called Belgachia Villa for the purpose, in deference to his wife, who was religiously and socially orthodox. He also had a 'baithak-khana', or living room, built for himself in the courtyard of Jorasanko House. He was sensitive towards his family's way of life. In his own personal faith he remained a Vaishnava Hindu throughout, but his way of worship was his own. He was remarkable in combining his love of his country and heritage with his radical thinking. His younger brother Ramanath (1800-1877) was his close ally in business and in social reform.

Debendranath Tagore (1817-1905), was the first Tagore to become an initiated brahmo, and led the Brahmo Samaj movement. With his uncompromising austerity he paid off his father's debtors instantly, thus effecting a reversal in the economic status of the Jorasanko branch of the family. He was popularly called Maharshi, or great sage. Like his father he did not interrupt the family's religious rituals but he dissociated himself from them after he became a brahmo. He married Sarada Devi (1826?-1875). Among their progeny Dwijendranath Tagore (1840-1926) was a freethinking philosopher whom Mahatma Gandhi revered; Satyendranath Tagore (1842-1923) was the first Indian member of the Indian Civil Service, who emancipated the women of his family from the purdah or veil; Jyotirindranath Tagore (1849-1925) was a painter and patriot who courted bankruptcy for 'swadeshi' (the promotion of Indian economic self-sufficiency); his daughter Swarnakumari Tagore (1855-1932) was a writer; and Rabindranath was a world-renowned poet and educationist. Debendranath's nephew Gunendranath Tagore (1848-1881) was the father of two great painters, Gaganendranath Tagore (1867-1938) and Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951), who led the new Bengal school of art from Jorasanko. 
Although from the 1760s the Tagore family was divided into two branches they acted as one 'paribar' or joint family in matters of property, marriage, ritual, and social status. In business ventures too there was collaboration. Dwarkanath and his cousin Ladlimohan Tagore (died 1833) of Pathuriaghata together entered joint ventures with European merchants. At any given time the family placed itself under a 'dalapati' or leader of the Tagore 'dal', or party, who was the senior member of the two branches. When there was dissent, as there was over supporting Rammohan Roy's reforms, the cousins Dwarkanath and Prasannakumar chose to follow their own convictions and became young 'dalapatis' themselves. The orthodox and the liberals coexisted in both households. As middlemen in a trading world the family willingly allied themselves with European merchants in banking, insurance, and plantations, believing that was good for their country and its future. They established the material foundations of a society which was at ease with high British culture, held their own solidly in British-Indian commerce, and grew in their position as cultural nationalists. With them there was an advent of new ideals, which at the same time were old.

Colville, David (c.1581-1629), classical and oriental scholar, was the fifth and youngest son of Robert Colvill (died 1584), the protestant laird of Cleish, Kinross-shire, and his wife, Margaret Lindsay, daughter of the laird of Dowhill. A precocious student who displayed a great talent for Greek and Hebrew, Colville graduated MA at St Andrews University in 1601, when he must still have been a protestant. Although details of his early life are sketchy, he appears to have travelled to Spain in 1605, where the resident ambassador, Sir Charles Cornwallis, met him in Valladolid and remarked that Colville had become a Roman Catholic like his paternal uncle, the political conspirator John Colville, who had converted in 1600. Some time before 1606 David went to Avignon to study theology. In 1608 he was enrolled in the Scots College in Rome, which he left without having taken holy orders. He studied law and medicine in Padua and Bologna, probably between 1609 and 1615, and also appeared in Venice in 1611. In 1617 he moved briefly to Pisa and Rome, whence he departed for Spain. 
At the end of 1617 Colville arrived in Madrid, and was appointed royal interpreter by Philip III, with the obligation to reside at the Escorial, near Madrid. Colville was one of the many Catholic Scots who came to serve the Habsburg crown; chief among them was Colonel William Sempill, who gathered around him a circle of illustrious compatriots, including Sir Robert Ker (later first earl of Ancram). Colville entered into correspondence with Sempill about his possible assistance with learned editions of texts prepared by the Jesuits for the Plantin Press. He also corresponded with a number of antiquarians such as Giovanni Battista Doni and his fellow Scot Thomas Dempster. Despite these political and social contacts Colville spent his ten years in the Escorial mostly as a recluse, studying, cataloguing, and teaching. He must have become a Catholic priest during his time there, as he was later called 'a priest from Scotland' ('sacerdos e Scotia') by Cardinal Federicus Borromaeus (Durkan, 'David Colville', 148). 
Colville had already learned Greek and Hebrew before arriving at the Escorial, but he started studying Arabic only in 1621 and 'without any help except through books and dictionaries', as he himself stated in the colophon to one of his works (Lofgren and Traini, 1.76, no. 131). His intellectual interests were extremely wide-ranging. During his ten-year sojourn at the Escorial he catalogued the vast majority of Greek and Arabic manuscripts, as well as many Latin and Hebrew ones. In all these languages he perused authors whom the Inquisition viewed with suspicion; consequently he often needed the special permission of his superiors to consult and copy them. When he left the Escorial in 1627 his prior described him as a reliable man who had done great service in teaching the monks Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic. 
It is particularly in the area of Arabic studies where Colville's influence, if indirectly, is most keenly felt today. Three products of his scholarly efforts during this decade illustrate the extent of his knowledge. First, he partly copied a manuscript of the 'Koran' that originally consisted of the Arabic text, Latin translation, and notes based on the Muslim exegetical tradition (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan, MS D100 inf). Generally speaking, Christians during the middle ages and the Renaissance had mostly been interested in the 'Koran' as a heretical text, and made little effort to understand it in the light of Muslim doctrine. By copying a 'Koran' that contained notes based on Arabic commentaries ('tafsir'), Colville tried to understand the Muslim holy writ not primarily from the perspective of anti-Islamic polemic. In using the same tools as the Muslims, he preceded European 'Koran' scholarship by several decades. Only with the publication of Luigi Marracci's 'Alcorani textus universus' (1698) did the use of 'tafsir' become firmly established. 
Second, Colville recognized early on that Arabic versions of Greek medical texts could fill the gap where the latter were no longer extant. He found a number of manuscripts in the Escorial containing the Arabic version of those parts of Galen's 'Commentary on the Hippocratic 'Epidemics'' no longer surviving in Greek, and collated them. In doing so he displayed great philological acumen, since he compared the various manuscripts of the Arabic version at his disposal. Moreover, he also recognized the importance of the 'Questions on the 'Epidemics'', an abridgement of the text in question and answer format produced by Hunain ibn Ishaq, a famous ninth-century translator and court physician in Baghdad. Colville's partial copy of this latter text (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan, MS B135 sup, fols. 119-44) is the only one known still to exist today. He thus laid the foundation for modern editorial efforts in this area. 
Third, Colville collated four Arabic manuscripts of al-Firuzabadi's (died 1415) 'Comprehensive Dictionary' ('al-Qamus al-muhit'). This work marks a high point in the Arabic tradition of national lexicography. The dictionary lists Arabic words according to 'radicals' (or 'root letters'), and gives an explanation of the various meanings, again in Arabic. Colville finished copying and collating this manuscript (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan, MS D141 inf) in 1623, some five years after Federicus Borromaeus had charged Antonio Giggeo with translating al-Firuzabadi's 'Comprehensive Dictionary' into Latin, and seeing the translation through the press. The resulting work was printed in four volumes under the title 'Kanz al-luga al- 'Arabiya, sive, Thesaurus linguae arabicae' (1632) at the cardinal's expense. It represented the first European Arabic dictionary to pay proper attention to the indigenous Arabic dictionaries, and therefore constituted a milestone not only in Arabic lexicography, but also in Oriental studies in general. Colville's exact contribution to this work remains to be investigated, but it is likely that his manuscript of al-Firuzabadi's 'Comprehensive Dictionary' played an important part. 
In 1625 Francesco Barberini, the papal secretary of state, had visited the Escorial and made Colville's acquaintance. Two years later, in June 1627, and perhaps because of this meeting, Colville returned to Rome, where he entered Barberini's circle. There he encountered a fair number of his contemporaries, among them the Scottish diplomat and educator George Conn. In February 1628 he left Rome on a trip to consult various Italian libraries; it led him first to Florence, and thence to Pisa, Genoa, Pavia, and finally Milan, where he met Federicus Borromaeus, a great patron of the arts and founder of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana and its sister institution, the Collegium Ambrosianum. In March 1628 Colville returned to Rome via Turin. Later that year, in August, he went back to Turin and stayed there until June 1629 to serve as interpreter to the duke of Savoy, Carlo Emanuele I. At the end of August 1629 he finally returned to Milan and stayed with Cardinal Borromaeus. He died only four days after his arrival, of a fever -- or perhaps of the scholarly melancholy to which he had been prone most of his life. The cardinal reported Colville as saying on his deathbed that scholarship and manuscripts were his only delight.

Westkarre, William (d. 1486), Augustinian canon and suffragan bishop, is of unknown origins, and nothing is known of his early life before February 1443, when -- with the degree of doctor of theology -- he was the first recorded head, or 'prior studentium', of St Mary's College, the house for Augustinians studying in Oxford that had been founded in 1435. During 1443 he also acted as commissary to the chancellor of the university. He was commissary again in May 1446, having also been 'cancellarius natus' (acting chancellor when the office was vacant) in February 1444 and April 1445. He was reported, too, to have been an excellent preacher. 
Westkarre was also a canon of the London priory of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, and on 23 May 1445 royal assent was given to his election as prior. However, assent had already been given, on 21 April, to another candidate, Thomas Pomeroy, and controversy ensued. On 21 June a commission was appointed to keep the goods of the priory safe until the election was settled. This happened on 19 February 1446, when Pomeroy was confirmed and Westkarre was instructed to return the temporalities of the priory. 
For the next five years Westkarre's whereabouts are unknown, but by 1451 he was a canon of Burscough, Lancashire. On 13 July that year the pope instructed the archbishop of York and the archdeacons of Hereford and Colchester to grant him the next available benefice, and dispensed Westkarre to hold it for life together with his canonry at Burscough. About the same time he obtained significant preferment in the south of England, when a commission appointed by Bishop Waynflete of Winchester declared that William Marlynburgh, prior-elect of Mottisfont, Hampshire, had insufficient title to his post, and nominated Westkarre instead. 
Success bred success. Waynflete became chancellor of the realm on 11 October 1456, and probably needed assistance in the running of his diocese. On 14 December the University of Oxford wrote to the pope, praising Westkarre's virtues and accomplishments, and it may well have been at the same time that a letter in his favour was sent to the pope in the name of Henry VI, whose agent in Rome was instructed to present it and to be diligent 'unto theffectuell conclusion of our desire' ('Letters', ed. Monro, 66). If the purpose of these letters was to secure Westkarre's elevation, they achieved their end. On 29 April 1457 Pope Calixtus III granted a faculty for his consecration as bishop of Sidon, 'in partibus infidelium', and on 1 May issued a licence empowering him to exercise episcopal powers outside his nominal diocese. On 6 May the pope confirmed that the new bishop could retain the priory of Mottisfont, together with two other benefices, one secular and one regular. This was extended on 28 June to two canonries and two prebends, though not in cathedral churches. 
The first additional benefice that Westkarre held was the rectory of Cobham, Surrey, to which he was admitted on 9 January 1460. He had resigned this by December 1465, having become rector of St Martin Ludgate, London, which he held until 1468. On 22 April that year he was installed as rector of St Mary in the Marsh, Romney, Kent, a benefice in the gift of the archbishop of Canterbury, which he held until 1473. It is perhaps no coincidence that Westkarre was in Canterbury in March and April 1468, conducting ordinations, and that on Easter day he celebrated mass at the cathedral's high altar because the prior of Christ Church was unwell. He was also for several periods rector of All Saints', Southampton. At the time of his death in 1486 he was rector of Chilbolton, Hampshire. 
From 1457 until his death Westkarre principally exercised his episcopal powers as suffragan to the bishop of Winchester, as was doubtless intended. But like many suffragans he was active in several other dioceses as well. In 1459 he consecrated burial land for the bishop of Bath and Wells, and in 1463 he consecrated chrism at Canterbury. In 1473 he acted as a commissary of the bishop of Chichester in confirming the grant of Sele Priory, a small alien house, to Magdalen College, Oxford, founded by Waynflete fifteen years earlier. He served as suffragan to the archbishop of Canterbury again in 1480, when he was also the bishop of Worcester's suffragan. From 1471 he was living in London, hearing appeals to the apostolic see and various other cases, mostly marital disputes. 
Westkarre was still prior of Mottisfont when he died in 1486, probably on 27 June, the day on which his successor as prior, Henry Rowe, ordered that Westkarre should be commemorated by an annual distribution of food to the poor. Westkarre was buried in Winchester Cathedral. On 5 July 1797 a slab measuring 12 feet by 5 feet was lifted from in front of the so-called Holy Hole, a doorway in the retrochoir's feretory screen. Legend would have it that this was the grave of St Swithin, but the complete skeleton that was found inside it was wearing a monk's cowl and leather boots and had been interred with a crozier and mitre. These could be Westkarre's remains.

Draper, John (d. 1552), Augustinian canon and bishop-suffragan of Winchester, is of unknown origins. From about 1510 he studied at the University of Oxford (probably at St Mary's College, a house of study created for Augustinians in 1435). Some twelve years later, on 21 March 1522, he supplicated for the degree of bachelor of theology. By this time he was already prior of Christchurch Priory, Hampshire, having been elected by acclamation on 31 January 1521. In this he may have had the advantage of kinship to another John Draper, who had been prior from 1477 to 1501. He seems to have attracted the attention of Stephen Gardiner, who on 13 November 1532, less than a year after his own elevation to the see of Winchester, had Draper made bishop of Neapolis, a see 'in partibus infidelium', so that he could act as suffragan in Gardiner's diocese. He held this position until his death. 
The 1530s were mostly good for Draper. It was common for the priors of Christchurch to supplement their income with the vicarage of Puddletown in Dorset, a living in the gift of their house, and Draper became vicar on 29 January 1536. Later that year, on 24 February, he was instituted as rector of Iwerne Courtney, also in Dorset. Having cultivated good relations with Thomas Cromwell by sending him historical books, including works by Bede and William of Malmesbury, it is perhaps not surprising that in 1538 he was able to style himself king's chaplain. 
But in that same year everything changed for Draper. The 'valor ecclesiasticus' compiled in 1535 had estimated that the priory had a net value of $312 7's'. 01/4died per annum, and although the king's commissioners produced a favourable report in 1537, those of 1538 recommended its dissolution. Draper petitioned to save his house, noting that it acted as a parish church, fed the poor, educated children, and had recently established a daily lecture in divinity. This did not save it, though the priory church did survive to become the parish church (after commissioners had first defaced the chapel erected by Margaret Pole, countess of Salisbury, the last of the Plantagenets, whose son Cardinal Reginald Pole had become a thorn in the king's side). The priory itself, now thought to be worth $519 3's'. 61/2died, was officially surrendered to the crown on 28 November 1539. 
Draper was not a man for heroics. The commissioners reported to Cromwell that they found him 'honest and conformable' ('LP Henry VIII', 14/2, no. 627). He was well rewarded for his conformity, receiving a pension of $133 6's'. 8died and the right to occupy the prior's lodgings at Somerford for life, rent-free. Further rewards followed. In 1541 Winchester Cathedral, formerly a monastic establishment, was reconstituted with a secular chapter, in which Draper was appointed canon and prebendary on 28 March. He continued in favour in the reign of Edward VI. On 26 March 1547 he was made warden of the hospital of St Mary Magdalen, Winchester, an office in the gift of the bishop. On 3 June 1551, now styled vice-dean as well as suffragan, he acted as proctor to Archbishop Thomas Cranmer when John Ponet was installed and enthroned by proxy as bishop of Winchester. 
Draper died on 29 September 1552. He had made his will on 6 June 1549 (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/36 fol. 15'r'- 'v'), bequeathing his soul to 'god almighty my Creator and Redemer'. He left money to the prebendaries, minor canons, lay vicars, choristers, and even bell-ringers, of Winchester Cathedral, while the church at Christchurch was given paving stones for its floor and an embroidered coverlet 'to lye before the high aulter on the high days'. The poor of Christchurch were to have 3's'. 4died a week for three years. There followed a number of bequests to individuals, some of them his parishioners at Puddletown, while Brixton parish church (on the Isle of Wight, also in the gift of the bishop of Winchester) was left a cloth of gold corporal for use in the eucharist. The residue of Draper's estate was to go to his executors, Francis Trynce and Sir Walter Gurth; probate was granted on 3 February 1553. 
Originally Draper probably intended to be buried in the chantry chapel he commissioned in the late 1520s from the Winchester mason Thomas Bertie. Placed at the east end of the south choir aisle of Christchurch Priory church, its stone screen (which bears Draper's initials and the date 1529) makes striking use of Italianate 'all'antica' decorative motifs, in the context of a structure that remains basically Gothic. But no tomb or altar was ever built inside the chapel, and by the time Draper died the chantries had been dissolved. Perhaps it was for that reason that in his will of 1549 he asked to be buried 'before the quere dore there at the hedd of hym that was first Prior there' (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/36, fol. 15'r'- 'v'). In 1822 his remains were moved to rest in front of his chapel.

Smart, John (d. in or after 1539), abbot of Wigmore and suffragan bishop, is of unknown origins. He is first recorded in 1498, as a novice member of St Augustine's Abbey, Bristol. About 1505 he became a scholar of St Mary's College, Oxford, and graduated BA on 19 June 1507. By 1511-12, now a priest, he had become a canon of St Augustine's, though he spent this year studying in Paris. On 18 February 1514 he proceeded BTh. On 19 June 1518 Smart was elected abbot of Wigmore, Herefordshire, by Cardinal Wolsey's appointment; he may have applied, or even paid, for his preferment, but no details survive. In 1519 he assisted Charles Bothe, bishop of Hereford, by conducting visitations when Bothe was away at a church council. It was common at this time for the heads of religious houses to assist diocesan bishops by acting as suffragans, and the fact that Wigmore was the only non-exempt abbey in Hereford diocese made Smart an obvious candidate for such promotion there. Nothing happened quickly, but on 2 July 1523 Bothe applied to the papal curia for Smart's elevation, and on 13 July 1526 he was made bishop of Panada 'in partibus' by papal provision; he was licensed to continue at Wigmore by being granted the abbotship 'in commendam'. That year he ordained sixty-three candidates to different orders in Hereford Cathedral and remained suffragan bishop in that diocese until 1535. He also acted as suffragan in the dioceses of Worcester (1526-31) and Llandaff. 
When Smart became abbot, Wigmore had long been a source of concern to successive bishops of Hereford, but under its last abbot the monastery's reputation plumbed new depths. The first sign of trouble came in a letter from Smart to Thomas Cromwell in 1528, informing him that Cuthbert Marshall, archdeacon of York, was seeking his resignation and that Bothe had also written to Cardinal Wolsey. In a letter of 31 August 1529, Rowland Philippes, vicar of Croydon and one of Wolsey's emissaries, informed the cardinal that Smart had turned down his offer of a pension of 40 marks if he would resign and had observed that he did not expect the cardinal to last much longer. Philippes advised Wolsey that his only options were to leave Smart in place to destroy the abbey or to attempt to remove him by canonical process. 
Wolsey fell from office before he could achieve anything. He had had genuine grounds for concern, for Wigmore faced the threat of financial destruction, so much so that on 17 January 1530 Bishop Bothe, concerned about the monastery's debts and crumbling buildings, handed over its administration to John Cragge, a cathedral prebendary, and John Lee, a canon of Wigmore. They were instructed to sequestrate and administer the revenues and to pay only the conventional allowances to the inmates. When another canon, Richard Cubleigh, returned from London to discover the change in administration (and his own depleted stipend), a fierce quarrel ensued, in which Cubleigh, after being attacked by John Tykkel, a supporter of Lee, drew his sword and killed his assailant. 
Within a couple of years, however, Smart had regained control of the monastery, fully supported by Cubleigh, to whom the pope granted a dispensation on 25 March 1532. The abbot's standing and confidence appear to have been undiminished by his temporary suspension. He was appointed visitor for the diocese of Hereford on 11 March 1534, and a year later had no qualms about proposing himself (albeit unsuccessfully) for the recently vacated see of St Asaph, telling Cromwell in a letter dated 20 July 1535 that 'if I were a man of sufficient qualities I trust you would help me to succeed him' ('LP Henry VIII', 8, no. 1073). 
Meanwhile Wigmore continued to decay, and Smart's temporary replacement by Lee did nothing to improve relations between them. On 19 September 1536 Hugh Corwen, vicar-general to the new bishop of Hereford, Edward Fox, conducted a visitation. This was a delicate task for Corwen, as he had recently been ordained by Smart at Wigmore. That year's royal injunctions were perhaps delivered at the same time, though Fox delayed issuing his own for six months. While cautious in phrasing, the latter were nevertheless damning in content: presumably on the basis of Corwen's findings, Smart was effectively found to be guilty of incontinence and dilapidation, of bullying the abbey's inmates, and of selling off the monastery's possessions. The canons also came in for criticism, with Richard Cubleigh singled out for particular condemnation for failing to attend choir, engaging in the unmonastic pursuits of hunting and hawking, and brawling in the precincts. 
When Fox died on 8 May 1538, a year after issuing his injunctions, little had changed at Wigmore. By then it was clear that the monasteries would not survive much longer, but Lee decided to stand up to his abbot one last time. On 7 September he travelled to Hereford to apply for permission to report Smart to Cromwell for contravening the royal injunctions. During Lee's absence Smart took the opportunity to search his room, claiming to be looking for a stolen vestment. The vestment did not materialize, but he did serendipitously discover an allegedly treasonous letter to the canon from none other than John Cragge, Lee's co-administrator at Wigmore during Smart's suspension. 
Smart instantly attempted to use local influence to have Lee arrested at Wigmore Castle. The deputy constable, Sir John Croft, was under no illusions about the state of the monastery, and had complained to Cromwell five years previously that: 'My neighbour th'abbot of Wigmore were bound to pray for you, if ye would write unto him to reform himself and his brothers; for in my conscience there is no worse rule kept within England nor Wales than is there kept... of all hands. ('LP Henry VIII', 6, no. 946)' Clearly sympathetic to Lee (who acted as his chaplain), he claimed to have no authority to arrest him, and when Smart's agent John Brydges tried to do so, Croft threatened to smash his head open and put him in the stocks. 
Croft agreed to hold Lee overnight at his own house and to take him next morning to see his father, Sir Edward Croft, who was a justice of the peace. Meanwhile other JPs travelled to Ludlow, to search and make an inventory of Cragge's house. Nothing treasonous was discovered, but Smart claimed that allegedly stolen goods were found together with a bag containing $71, with the result that Cragge was arrested and sent to Cromwell. Meanwhile in Wigmore three days passed without news, so Sir Edward granted Lee's request that he, too, should be sent to Cromwell in order to present his charges. Twenty-nine articles against Smart, written by Lee and presented to Cromwell, survive, and it is reasonable to conclude that they were delivered at this time. They are similar to many of the counts referred to in Fox's injunctions, though even more lurid -- they include murder, rape, sexual incontinence, extortion, simony, superstition, illegal sales of property, wholesale ordinations of undesirables for payment, and gross mismanagement of the abbey and its community. 
What Cromwell made of all of this remains unknown, but with the monastery's dissolution imminent, and the local gentry already vying for its assets, close investigation probably seemed futile. It must have also suited him politically to keep proceedings unresolved when he was justifying the destruction of monastic life in England. By the time that Bishop Rowland Lee of Coventry and Sir William Sulyard received the surrender of Wigmore over two months later, on 18 November 1538, Smart still had not responded to Lee's accusations. And when Bishop Lee went to Wigmore to complete the dissolution in early December, John Lee admitted that he could not support his charges, withdrew them, and renounced any intention of proceeding further. Acting on instructions received from Cromwell, the bishop immediately allowed Smart 'his goods'. On 3 April 1539, moreover, Smart was granted a pension of $80 per year, considerably more than the 40 marks ($26 13's'. 4died) offered to him by Wolsey in 1529 and four times the pension granted to the previous abbot in 1518. With his future secured, Smart, along with Lee and Cragge, then disappeared into obscurity. 
Over 300 years later John Smart was recovered from that obscurity by the historian J. A. Froude, who in 1857 presented the accusations against him as evidence for the decadence of the church in England on the eve of the Reformation, and in the process helped to make him something of a test case in a historiographical debate on late medieval monasticism that was conducted along largely confessional lines. The main protagonists were Francis Gasquet, who attempted to salvage Smart's reputation, and the scholarly controversialist G. G. Coulton, who applied himself to demolishing it again. It is a measure of Coulton's success that when David Knowles published a measured summary of the 'Wigmore case' in 1950, although he dismissed Lee's accusations as the work of 'an irresponsible and malicious man... in many of its articles and details either pure fabrication or reckless gossip', he still concluded that Smart was an 'ambitious, dishonest and unworthy man' (Knowles, 'Last abbot', 145). 
It is true that none of the charges against Smart can be corroborated, while at least one can be disproved: diocesan lists for Llandaff in 1534 show that he did not, as Lee asserted, ordain indiscriminately there. But Smart's propensity to scandal, the similarities between Lee's articles and Fox's injunctions, and the number of specific details included by Lee argue strongly that Smart was indeed totally unsuited to the position he held. He made no attempt to defend himself against Lee's allegations, while failing dismally in his attempts to discredit his accuser. The articles against Smart may have been the work of an angry and dissatisfied man, but Lee was also a canon of apparently exemplary conduct who had helped to save his house from financial ruin. His outburst against his abbot, though arguably imprudent, can certainly be defended on the grounds of inherent plausibility, making it only just that his charges should have ensured that history's view of Smart would not be as generous as his pension.

Cavenagh, Sir (William) Orfeur (1820-1891), army officer and colonial governor, was born at Hythe, Kent, on 8 October 1820, the third of five sons and fourth of seven children of James Gordon Cavenagh (1766-1844), army surgeon, and his wife, Ann (died 1846), daughter of Odiarne Coates, of Grene Court, New Romney, Kent. The Cavenagh family had been landed gentry in co. Kildare and then co. Wexford, Ireland, with a recent tradition of service in the armed forces. After training at the East India Company's college at Addiscombe, Cavenagh joined an Indian regiment of the Bengal army. In the Gwalior and Sutlej campaigns of the mid-1840s he was twice seriously wounded and lost part of his left leg. Meanwhile, on 7 September 1842 he had married Elizabeth Marshall Moriarty, daughter of Lieutenant James Moriarty, naval officer. They had two sons, both of whom became army officers. 
In 1850 Cavenagh's knowledge of Nepal led to his attachment to the Nepal mission to London. In 1854 Dalhousie appointed him town major, Calcutta, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in effect administrative commandant of the Calcutta garrison, which in 1857 was tempted to join the rising up country, but Cavenagh, a former regimental interpreter who understood the sepoys' mentality, acted skilfully and firmly to prevent this. However, Sir Colin Campbell, the commander-in-chief, objected to a relatively junior officer being directly responsible to the governor-general and secured the abolition of the post. Canning then offered Cavenagh the governorship of the Straits Settlements, which he held from 1859 to 1867. 
On arrival Cavenagh found the Straits Settlements in political limbo, as its transfer to the control of the Colonial Office was held up until additional revenues were found to fill its persistent budget deficit. Proposals for customs duties and income tax met bitter resistance but Cavenagh eventually hit on the idea of applying Indian stamp duty to, among other things, the bills of exchange by which Singapore merchants paid for goods received on consignment from Britain. Since the new impost could be passed back to British principals or forward to Chinese distributors they grudgingly consented to it. The other high-profile event of Cavenagh's governorship was his decision to send a gunboat to bombard the state capital of Trengganu, on the east coast of the peninsula, in 1862. It was a token gesture but it fluttered the dovecotes of regional diplomacy and was criticized in parliament in London. However, it induced Siam to withdraw an envoy sent to bring Trengganu under its influence. 
In his general conduct of government Cavenagh, shrewd and above all approachable, was more successful and popular than predecessors who had held themselves aloof. After he retired the Singapore community named the new bridge across the Singapore river after him. The staff establishment of the Straits Settlements had been reduced in the 1830s and the Indian Civil Service would not accept postings to such a backwater. The senior administrative (and also police, medical, and public works) posts were therefore held by officers of the Indian army who thus made a new career, becoming an efficient and respected cadre. Cavenagh himself had also to deal with visiting Malay dignitaries, Lord Elgin on his way to China, senior British army and navy officers, and Dutch and French officials. He once proposed to an admiral over dinner a novel method of warship construction to which the latter replied tactfully that 'it might be feasible'. In his tours of rural districts of Penang and Malacca he went as far as possible by carriage and then dismounted to walk, changing his artificial leg for a more robust simple 'peg leg', noting with amusement the astonishment of Malay villagers at the change of limb. He was 'Small in stature and with a merry twinkle in his eye... more like a skipper of the old school than a military officer' (Makepeace and others, 2.529). 
Cavenagh had already served for seven years as governor when the long-delayed transfer to the Colonial Office became imminent. He felt -- with justification -- that the new regime would start well if he stayed on to see it in, and he proposed that half a dozen senior administrators also should remain in post. However, the Colonial Office was resolved to make a clean sweep and did not even notify Cavenagh of the appointment of his successor, Sir Harry Ord. Mortified when he heard the news from a well-informed Singapore merchant, Cavenagh pointedly did not stay to hand over but departed a fortnight before Ord arrived. Another grievance was that he had not received the knighthood that came as a matter of course to governors of Indian provinces and he caused consternation at the India Office when, paying his valedictory visit, he raised the matter with the secretary of state. However, placed on the British army list, he was promoted lieutenant-general (1874) and finally general (1877). Then in 1881 came the long-coveted KCSI. After retiring to Long Ditton, Surrey, he became honorary colonel of the volunteer (territorial) 3rd battalion of the East Surrey regiment and served as a member of Surrey county council. He died at St Aubyns, Long Ditton on 3 July 1891 and was survived by his wife and their two sons.

Innes, Emily Anne (1843-1927), author, was born on 5 March 1843 in Boxley, Kent, the third of the six children of James Craigie Robertson (1813-1882), curate of Boxley, and his wife, Julia Maria, 'nee' Stevenson (died 'c'.1884). In 1859 her father, a distinguished theologian and church historian, became a canon and the librarian of Canterbury Cathedral. Emily, of whose education nothing is known, was then sixteen. Her siblings left home for marriage or a career but for fifteen years she lived among the cathedral clergy wives as her mother's companion. However, on 28 January 1875, in the cathedral she married a colonial official, James Innes (1834-1901), son of an eminent Scottish antiquary, Cosmo Innes. 
Soon after their marriage James Innes took his new wife out to Sarawak, where he was government treasurer. He was a slack, incompetent administrator who drank too much. But until his death in 1901 Emily was a dutiful and loyal wife and a ferocious champion of her husband. Her slightly wistful references to Malay children hint at disappointment that she had none. But it was a marriage of companionship that both needed. In 1876 Innes lost his job in Sarawak but secured a district officer's post at Kuala Langat, the royal capital of Selangor, which had recently come under British control. For six years the couple lived in Selangor with a brief interval in neighbouring Perak. For Emily it was a period of uncomfortable living in remote places, a time of loneliness and tedium, interrupted occasionally by a crisis. She studied the Malay language in books and practised it with her visitors. She dispensed what medicines she had, noting that few of her patients died, and she helped to tackle a local outbreak of cholera. To recover her health she visited the district officer and his family on Pangkor island. Chinese robbers broke into the house, killed the husband, and left his wife and Emily Innes unconscious. The arrival of the two women at Penang, bearing the marks of the attack, caused 'a considerable sensation' (Innes, 'Chersonese', 2.115). 
As the years went by James and Emily Innes fell out with residents and other officials and their wives, and became more isolated than ever. In Perak James Innes objected to Hugh Low's policy of tolerating Malay debt-bondage, an institution that Europeans regarded as a form of slavery. Low recognized the superior intelligence and marital influence of the wife and lent her official papers setting out his policy of gradualism. But loyalty to her husband made her obdurate. Although hostile to Low, the most talented resident of his time, Emily Innes nevertheless had a grudging respect for him. After returning to Selangor, James Innes quarrelled ever more bitterly with Bloomfield Douglas, the resident, and resigned at the end of 1881, to return to England. 
In the course of her brief visit to the Malay states in 1879 Isabella Bird, the celebrated traveller, did not come to the station at which James and Emily Innes then lived. When Bird's book 'The Golden Chersonese' appeared in 1883 Emily, back in London, conceded that everything in it was 'perfectly and literally true' (Innes, 'Chersonese', 2.242). But her 'The Chersonese with the Gilding Off' (1885) recorded what Bird had hardly seen and so not mentioned. The book is the basis of her fame. Much of it is a detailed account of her experiences and hardships, written with a bitterness that, according to an American historian, bore 'the marks of paranoia' (Heussler, 67). When published it attracted little attention. Bird, preoccupied with personal problems, did not respond. However, modern historians, in search of contemporary evidence of early colonial rule, have recognized its value as a vivid and perceptive picture of the Selangor Malay elite then coming to terms with colonialism, and the book was republished in 1974 with an introduction by a leading Malayan historian. Although she writes unsympathetically Emily Innes gives a good description of the Malay lifestyle and of the individuals she knew. There are lighter touches, as when she tells of her unlikely friendship with an elderly Malay aristocrat, formerly a pirate. Invited to tea and tennis, he scampered about hitting the ball high in the air with much satisfaction. He declined tea but was refreshed with Bass's pale ale in homeopathic doses. 
Refused a pension by the Colonial Office, James Innes scratched a living in the 1880s as a London tea broker until money inherited from parents came to sustain him and his wife. Emily spent her last years at Nairn in Scotland in reflected glory, near where the Innes family had been lairds. Her neighbour was Lord Finlay, a former lord chancellor and husband of her sister-in-law. She died at Drummuir, Albert Street, Nairn, on 7 November 1927, of pneumonia. She was an intolerant and quarrelsome snob, but her gifts of observation and description made a valuable contribution to Malayan historiography. Her courage and determination in face of adversity also deserve respect.

Berkeley, Hubert John Aloysius (1864-1942), colonial administrator, was born on 25 June 1864 at Overbury, Worcestershire, the fourth of six sons of Robert Berkeley (1823-1897), landowner, of Spetchley Park, Worcestershire, and his wife, Lady Mary Catherine, 'nee' Browne (died 1924), younger daughter of Thomas Browne, third earl of Kenmare. After training on HMS 'Conway' he became a midshipman in the Royal Navy. 
In 1886 Berkeley joined the service of the Malay state of Perak and from 1904 to 1926 (with an interval of military service in 1914-18) he was district officer of Upper Perak, which he administered in the fashion of a Malay chief and with little regard for higher authority. This inaccessible district had only a sparse Malay population. However, when Berkeley took charge in 1904 there were surface mines at Klian Intan just over the border in the state of Rahman, which was under Siamese control. The headwaters of the Perak river in Rahman were exposed to the risk of pollution by sludge discharged from the mines, which had recently been expanded by the hydraulicing operations of two European companies. Berkeley urged that this danger to Malay agricultural areas lower down the Perak river be contained. His local knowledge played an important part in boundary negotiations in 1909, and the vulnerable Perak river catchment area was transferred from Rahman to Perak. Thereafter, throughout his long tenure in Upper Perak, Berkeley encouraged only traditional Malay settlement, mainly through irrigation schemes. He grew his own food and travelled on horse or elephant, abominating motor cars, roads, newspapers, moneylenders, and lawyers. 
Berkeley was a commanding figure who habitually wore a bush jacket and shorts surmounted by a khaki helmet or by a straw boater with a ribbon inscribed HMS 'Malaya'. His hospitality to chosen friends and his annual journey of inspection to Belum at the extremity of his district were elaborately organized. He claimed to know the history of every Malay village and to be personally acquainted with its headman, and his unceremonious and direct style of administration was popular with them. During the First World War he served as a captain in the Worcestershire Regiment, though to his disgust he was employed mainly in the supply of cavalry remounts in Palestine and the Sudan. He was appointed a companion of the Imperial Service Order in 1921. 
His successor in Upper Perak noted that Berkeley 'had woven a legend about himself' through the dissemination of anecdotes of his own eccentricity and defiance of the state government (Morkill, 27). In the best-known of these episodes he reported that a non-existent bridge was down or that a large tree had fallen (it had been felled) across the only road, and thus prevented his superiors from paying their threatened visits of inspection. Summoned in 1913 to the state capital for the celebration of the GCVO conferred on the sultan of Perak he sent word to the harassed organizer that he would bring 47 elephants, 25 buffaloes, 87 schoolboys, 65 actors, 24 cooks, and 100 general attendants. 
Berkeley did a great deal for the welfare of the Malays of the district, but his opposition to change, although shared by some of his colleagues, was not entirely in tune with contemporary Malay aspirations. For example Sultan Idris of Perak held his state council spellbound with his expertise on Malay custom, but doubted the wisdom of the Malay reservations legislation of 1913 that aimed to put a ring fence round areas of Malay settlement throughout the Federated Malay States. 
The significance of Berkeley lay not in what he did but in his image among his colleagues. Somerset Maugham, who had visited Malaya in Berkeley's time in search of material for his short stories, observed of the Europeans that 'the vast majority... were ordinary people ordinarily satisfied with their station in life', and so he wrote of the exceptions only, such as Berkeley (Maugham, 8). A fellow administrator agreed with George Orwell (in Burma) that in Malaya 'most of us belonged to the upper lower (or lower upper) middle class' (Purcell, 291). Berkeley's colleagues, elevated 'ex officio' to higher status in colonial society, but enmeshed in a tight bureaucracy, were fascinated by Berkeley as a flamboyant aristocrat who resisted change among the Malay community that would eventually undermine the basis of colonial rule, and who used the remoteness of Upper Perak and his self-confidence to defy the powers that be. They admired (or thought they did) this model of a nonconformity they themselves did not practise. 
On retiring from Malaya, Berkeley farmed at Clink Gate Farm, an inherited property near Droitwich in Worcestershire. He became chairman of the local magistrates' bench and rode to hounds twice a week, going about in a yellow four-wheeled dogcart drawn by a pair of horses. On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 he joined the local Home Guard. He died at Clink Gate Farm of a cerebral haemorrhage on 27 April 1942, lamenting the changes in Malaya since his time and its fall to the Japanese. He was unmarried.

Holland, Vyvyan Beresford (1886-1967), author and translator, was born Vyvyan Oscar Beresford Wilde on 3 November 1886 at 16 (later 34) Tite Street, Chelsea, London, the younger son of Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900) and his wife, Constance Mary, 'nee' Lloyd (1858-1898). His parents were respectively Irish, and half-Irish, half-English. 
Holland's memoir, 'Son of Oscar Wilde' (1954), the main source for much of Wilde family life between 1887 and 1895, recorded happy years with a devoted mother. His amusing alcohol primer 'Drink and Be Merry' (1967) quoted a kindly nurse (perhaps a source for minor Wilde dialogue), 'Master Vyvyan, you must behave properly or not at all!'. He recalled Oscar Wilde as a loving father compensating for his absence with Gaelic songs adapted as lullabies, and with fairy stories (some published). Vyvyan's birth may have forced sexual abstinence on his parents for economy, inducing Wilde's discovery of his own homosexuality, ultimately resulting in his trial and two-year prison sentence for gross indecency with male prostitutes, in May 1895. 
Following his father's imprisonment, Vyvyan was taken from his preparatory school, Hildersham House, Broadstairs, Kent, to Switzerland, Germany, and Monaco with his elder brother, Cyril (1885-1915), their surnames changed, to be placed after their mother's death under coldly indifferent guardians. Nine-year-old Cyril had surreptitiously bought a newspaper recording his father's scandal; Vyvyan was an adult before he knew what it meant. Cyril concluded he had to atone for his father, and did so by dying as a soldier in the First World War in what Vyvyan thought a virtual duel with a German sniper. Vyvyan, educated separately from Cyril, had studied under the Jesuits in Monaco and at Stonyhurst, becoming a Roman Catholic without knowing his father had died in that faith. He studied law at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, from 1904 and (after a London interval in 1906-8) graduated in 1909. 
Like Cyril, Vyvyan Holland met and was charmed by Wilde's literary executor Robert Ross, whose expurgated edition of 'De Profundis' (1905) began a rehabilitation process enhanced by Ross's multi-volume collections of Wilde's works (1908-9), and the reburial of Wilde in Pere Lachaise cemetery (1909). Ross had drawn Wilde into the homosexual world and paid the penalty in caring for him as best he could after Wilde's release in May 1897, but his economic rescue of the Wilde literary estate, and his personal support for the Holland boys, were goodness in itself. He made Vyvyan at home in a Georgian literary scene where Wilde's name won respect without recrimination, but neither son thought it advisable to resume the surname. Vyvyan, called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1912, married Violet Mary Craigie ('b'. 1881), daughter of Edmund Warren Craigie, barrister, on 7 January 1914. She was killed (by accident from an open fire, comparably to Wilde's half-sisters) in 1918; Vyvyan served during the First World War in the Interpreters Corps, the Royal Field Artillery, and staff of 3rd Corps. He was mentioned in dispatches four times and appointed OBE in 1918. 
Demobilized as a captain in 1919, Holland pursued his wartime role as a translator, initially as 'H. B. V.' in unfulfilled hopes he might some day discard the role, despite the warning of his friend and mentor the Proust translator Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff that it imprisoned its practitioners. Few translators gain notice however effective, but Holland won immediate recognition as a master. 'Who is H. B. V.?' demanded Desmond MacCarthy, opening his lead review in the 'New Statesman' (11 August 1923). 'He is a most accomplished translator'. 'Open All Night' (by Paul Morand) 'is one of those rare translations which make it unnecessary to read the original'. One could say of Holland what he wrote in an obituary of Scott Moncrieff, that in translation he had 'the courage to be literal and at the same time the skill not to be ridiculous' ('Evergreen Garland', 122). He made it a principle to translate works he would decide after two chapters he admired, not reading the rest of the text until actually translating. His talent reflected his ancestry, both Oscar Wilde and Wilde's parents William and Jane having been accomplished translators whose originals -- like Holland's -- were in many languages. Like them he sought to enrich English literature by making little-known foreign works of unusual genius accessible. 
Holland evidently intended to help create a climate in which sexual adventure would win merited literary acclaim. He did not share his father's homosexuality; he did nurture belief in an intellectual culture where it could express itself in print alongside many other fascinating explorations. Languages enabled him to see Gaelic awareness as important for Oscar Wilde, a perception aided by his friendships with Gaelic speakers such as Liam O'Flaherty and Shane Leslie. He notably supported the proposed though unrealized biography and collected edition of Wilde by the revolutionary biographer A. J. A. Symons, whose 'The Quest for Corvo' (1934) had broken new frontiers in comprehending the 1890s, but who died young in 1941. Holland's memoir of Symons (printed in 'An Evergreen Garland', 1968) shows that he had intended Symons to tell his story in the life of Wilde, the loss of which ultimately induced Holland to overcome his own distaste for self-proclamation and write 'Son of Oscar Wilde' (1954). Its value more than compensated for Wildeana's loss in Symons's premature death. The happiness brought by Holland's marriage to the Australian beautician (Dorothy) Thelma Helen Besant (1910-1995), daughter of Frank Besant, lawyer, on 11 September 1943 and the birth of his son, Merlin, in 1945 gave him the stability he needed for autobiography. 
Holland found the truly scholarly editor of Wilde's letters he needed in the publisher of 'Son of Oscar Wilde', Rupert Hart-Davis, and nobly withdrew his objections to content whose frankness outstripped the bounds even of the avant-garde writers of his own translation such as the homosexual writer Julien Green, and Albert Cohen, whose 'Nailcruncher' in Holland's English version (1940) shocked George Orwell ('New Statesman', 7 December 1940). His friend the novelist Rebecca West convinced him to let virtually all Wilde's texts be published unscathed. Holland's gentle, clear, and forthright 'Son of Oscar Wilde' combined with the 'Letters' (1962) to restore Wilde's humanity and thus place his works on a genuine foundation whence all subsequent scholarship derived. Holland's extraordinary and exemplary absence of bitterness was exactly the tone needed to enable Wilde to triumph over homophobes, hedonists, and hagiographers alike. 
Holland shared his father's mockery of self-admiring industry, and thus took Brother Idler as his name for the literary dining club the Sette of Odd Volumes from the mid-1920s. In fact he threw himself into onerous enterprises, as editor and translator, such as the Chapman and Hall series of eighteenth-century French 'romans', working with such cicerones as Aldous Huxley who wrote the introduction to Crebillon's 'The Opportunities of a Night' (1925); the Chatto and Windus collected 'Stendhal' in translation (1926-8); and the French short stories in Somerset Maugham's 'Tellers of Tales' (1939), the Doubleday anthology of a hundred tales chosen from American and European literature. His own translations included texts from Henri Barbusse, L. S. Bernhardt, Pierre Joseph Victor, baron de Besenval, Charles Brainant, Claude Joseph Dorat, Georges A. Escoffier, Jean Galli de Bibiena, Albert Gervais, Julien Green (several), Rudolf Koch, Gerard de Nerval, Pierre Mac Orlan, Paul Morand (several), Charles J. L. A. Rochette de la Morliere, and Allegra Sander. His least successful translation was probably his father's 'Salome' (1957), which defies rendition into English. 
Holland's Second World War work was partly in the foreign service of the BBC using his linguistic expertise, and partly as a sergeant in the Home Guard. He visited Australia in 1947-8. With the death in 1945 of Lord Alfred Douglas, to whom Wilde had written 'De Profundis' in prison, the full text could now be published without fear of libel, in place of that prepared by Ross whence all allusions to Douglas had been removed, thus more than halving its length. The British Museum, custodian of the original manuscript, was bound by Ross's instructions not to permit its inspection until 1960, so Holland published the best text possible in 1949, using what later proved a defective typescript prepared for Ross. Hart-Davis established the definitive text for the 'Letters'. Holland worked on other problematic Wilde texts such as the original four-act 'Importance of Being Earnest' (1957), cut down before production to three acts, and the full-length 'Portrait of Mr W. H.' (1958), lost in 1895, which greatly strengthened Wilde's thesis that Shakespeare's sonnets had been written to the actor creating his great female parts. Holland also introduced the one-volume 'Complete Works' (1966) but his finest Wilde introduction was that of the fairy stories for Duckworth, 'The Happy Prince' (1957), blending his memories of his father's nursery narration of some of them with his own memories of comparable stories read by himself as a child before and after the tragedy. 
Holland wrote further reminiscences, 'Time Remembered after Pere Lachaise' (1966), a brief pictorial life of his father (1960; rev edn, 1966), a portrait of Goya (1961), and an authoritative study, 'Hand Coloured Fashion Plates, 1770-1899' (1955), as well as becoming a historical film consultant on, among others, 'The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders' (1965). He died at the Charing Cross Hospital, London, on 10 October 1967, following a stroke. Tragic as Wilde's life had been, he was truly fortunate in his second son. Holland's own son, Merlin, became (after the deaths of Richard Ellmann and Rupert Hart-Davis) the leading authority on Oscar Wilde in his time.

Priebsch, Robert (1866-1935), German scholar, was born on 11 June 1866 at Tannwald in Bohemia, the second of four sons of Johann Priebsch, cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Eleonore, 'nee' Riedel. The Priebsch family, which probably owed its name to the town of Priebisch, north-east of Glogau, can be traced back to the early seventeenth century; there was much intermarriage between them and the Riedels, who were known as glass-blowers and glass-painters as well as magistrates. Priebsch had most of his schooling at Reichenberg. From 1886 to 1895 he studied successively at Prague, Leipzig, Berlin, Graz, and Strasbourg universities, devoting himself to a wide range of subjects including Germanic mythology, German literature, philosophy, logic, and Anglo-Saxon. He took his doctorate on a topic in medieval German literature at Graz in 1895. 
After leaving Strasbourg, Priebsch came to England to examine and catalogue German medieval manuscripts in public and private collections, including those of Lord Ashburnham, Sir Thomas Phillips, and the earl of Crawford. Through his 'Deutsche Handschriften in England' (1896-1901; repr. 1979) and a series of articles on German manuscripts in the Royal Library at Brussels, published in 'Zeitschrift fur deutsche Philologie' between 1903 and 1907, he came to be the acknowledged authority on German palaeography. His rapidly growing scholarly reputation led, first, to his appointment as lecturer in Anglo-Saxon at the University of Liverpool through an invitation from the eminent Celtic philologist Kuno Meyer, and then, in 1898, to the chair of German at University College, London, where, together with John George Robertson, he built up a distinguished school of Germanic studies. On 12 July 1898 he married Ada Mary Rademacher (also known as Radmar), the highly cultivated granddaughter of a Rhinelander who had settled in London, and daughter of Charles John Rademacher, company director. They had one child, Hannah Margaret Mary (1905-1953). 
Always correctly clad in frock coat and silk hat, Priebsch cut an elegant figure. Despite being afflicted since childhood with paralysis of the foot muscles he had enjoyed his student life to the full, manfully fighting duels that scarred his kindly face for life. His disability doubtless helped foster his love of books. He gradually built up a remarkable collection of manuscripts, incunabula, and other early printed German books, most of which form part of the Priebsch-Closs collection of the Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies of the University of London, while another portion, mainly sixteenth-century books, form a similarly named collection at Princeton University. He had a rare gift for friendship, dispensing gracious and generous hospitality and showing himself to be genuinely helpful towards his students. He was no facile popularizer; indeed his lectures were arduous for beginners, but his more advanced students soon came to appreciate his scrupulous scholarship and share the warm glow of his enthusiasm for his subject. Among his many distinguished pupils, of whom several became professors of German themselves, were his son-in-law, August Closs, professor at the University of Bristol from 1948 to 1964, Leonard Willoughby, at University College, London, from 1931 to 1950, Frederick Norman, at King's College, London, from 1937 to 1965, and William Edward Collinson, at the University of Liverpool from 1914 to 1954. Collinson collaborated with Priebsch on 'The German Language' (1934), which ran to six editions by 1966. Priebsch's most important book was his study of Cotton manuscript 'Caligula A.vii' of the Old Saxon Biblical poem 'Heliand' (1925). His article on German in the eleventh edition of 'Encyclopaedia Britannica' was a model of erudition. In 1905 he was a founding editor of the 'Modern Language Review'. 
The First World War was a great blow to Priebsch, attached as he was to the countries mired in mutual enmity. He fell under suspicion, not least on account of his sending and receiving postcards containing what appeared to the British authorities to be highly suspect coded messages but which, in fact, were the shelfmarks of manuscripts in the British Museum. He was stripped of his status as a naturalized Briton under the 'Defence of the Realm Act'. It was only with difficulty that his friends were able to arrange for him to receive a meagre pension on his retirement in 1931. Priebsch thought he might be able to pick up the threads of his former life in Austria, but he reckoned without the changes wrought by the First World War and its aftermath. In 1934 he moved to Dubrovnik on the Adriatic, but his health deteriorated and he returned to Vienna, dying of lung disease at the Perchtoldsdorf sanatorium on 25 May 1935. He was survived by his wife and daughter. His daughter married his pupil August Closs in 1931, and became an art critic and novelist. She published 'Art and Life' (1936), the prose romance 'Tristan' (1940), and three novels on the Albigensians: 'High are the Mountains' (1945), 'And Sombre are the Valleys' (1949; reissued 'c'.1960 as 'Deep are the Valleys'), and 'The Silent Tarn' (1955), which were reissued as 'The Tarn Trilogy' (1978).

Brown, Maud Frances Forrester- (1885-1970), orthopaedic surgeon, was born at Wyverndern, The Ridgeway, Enfield, Middlesex, on 15 November 1885, the daughter of James Samuel Brown, civil engineer, and his wife, Emma Laetitia, 'nee' Tomkins. No evidence of siblings has been traced. After spending some of her childhood in India (where her father was consulting engineer to the government of Bombay), she attended Bedford high school from March 1898 for eight years, where her headmistress described her as a most brilliant and well-balanced scholar. On application for a place at the London School of Medicine for Women, with clinical training at the Royal Free Hospital, she gave her name as M. Forrester Brown. The source of the additional name Forrester is not known, nor why she later introduced a hyphen, to adopt the surname Forrester-Brown permanently. Placed first out of five candidates at an entrance examination, she was awarded a school scholarship and started basic science studies in late 1906. The school's records confirm excellent examination results as a student and she received the London MB BS in 1912, with honours in pathology and in forensic medicine. Postgraduate courses followed in London and Newcastle on Tyne. A Gilchrist studentship from London University enabled her to study in Berlin, including operative gynaecology, and after obstetric experience she gained the MD (London) in 1914 in gynaecology. She held junior hospital posts as far apart as Dundee and London, including that of house surgeon to Sir Harold Stiles at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh. 
In 1916 Forrester-Brown's senior residency in Sheffield was cut short and her subsequent career shaped by an invitation from Stiles to join him as orthopaedic resident at the Edinburgh War Hospital, Bangour, to investigate peripheral nerve lesions due to missile wounds. This resulted in several communications and, in 1920, an MS (London) for a dissertation entitled 'The results of operations for peripheral nerve injury'. In 1921 she and Stiles published 'The Treatment of Injuries of the Peripheral Spinal Nerves', of which she wrote two-thirds and for which she drew all the illustrations of operative techniques. Clearly inspired by this experience, she became orthopaedic surgeon to Fairmuir Specialist School, Dundee, and visited Sir Robert Jones in Liverpool and G. R. Girdlestone in Oxford, who were establishing orthopaedic centres throughout England and Wales. This may have promoted the award of a William Gibson research scholarship in 1923, enabling her to visit orthopaedic surgeons in the United States, Italy, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and many in Britain, and doubtless determined her subsequent appointment as resident surgeon of the newly established Children's Orthopaedic Hospital, Bath, in 1925, of which Jones and Girdlestone were honorary consultants. 
Nominated visiting surgeon to childrens' clinics, Forrester-Brown worked prodigiously and by 1926 was attending some eleven clinics in Somerset and Wiltshire. At the hospital 51 operations were performed in 1924, the number increasing to 237 in 1927, the vast majority by Forrester-Brown. The addition of Dorset added another five clinics, which she was said to visit on horseback for what was termed 'her out-week'. Soon the Bath and Wessex Orthopaedic Hospital gained many more beds, including twenty in a babies' ward with a pool which she dedicated to Jones, who had died in 1933. She was joined by another surgeon in 1935, who took over Wiltshire, and they visited some twenty-one clinics periodically. With the initiation of the National Health Service in 1948 she was termed consultant orthopaedic surgeon and was joined by two further surgeons. She retired in December 1950. 
In 1929 Forrester-Brown published 'Diagnosis and Treatment of Deformities in Infancy and Childhood', a guide and a plea for general practitioners and school medical officers to refer deformities as soon after birth as possible. With R. G. Gordon, a neurologist, she wrote 'Paralysis in Children' (1933), an erudite and detailed work, and in 1935 she described her remarkable experience of 152 cases of club foot. To congenital problems and poliomyelitis was added the care of joint tuberculosis, rickets, and nerve lesions; she had no remit for acute trauma. An active attender of conferences at home and abroad, she was in 1921 the first female member of the British Orthopaedic Association, later its secretary and an emeritus fellow; she was also an emeritus member of the International Society for Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery and the Medical Women's International Association. 
After her move to Bath, Forrester-Brown lived at 22 Combe Park, opposite the hospital where she would often arrive on horseback; she had consulting rooms in the Circus, Bath. After retirement to Edinburgh she undertook locum work, including as surgeon to the Holy Cross Hospital, East Pondoland, Transkei. Despite active horse-riding, swimming, skiing, and golf, she sustained four episodes of fracture suggesting underlying osteoporosis, although she died after a cerebro-vascular accident, at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 12 January 1970. She never married.

Robert Lyon (1894-1978), then master of painting at Armstrong College, Newcastle upon Tyne. Lyon had been born on 18 August 1894 in Warrington, Lancashire, the son of Charles Lyon ('b'. 1864/5), a journalist and writer originally from Scotland, and his wife, Grace, 'nee' Wood ('b'. 1869), from Scarborough. After war service with the King's Liverpool regiment, Lyon studied at Liverpool School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London, where he received the prix de Rome (painting) in 1924. On his return from Italy he had taken a teaching post at Hornsey College of Art and moved to Armstrong College in 1932. 
At first Lyon sought to educate the Ashington class in the aims and achievements of the old masters, using lantern slides. But disconcerted by his students' lack of even the most rudimentary knowledge, he soon decided that art history was lost on them and that practicality was the only option. As Lyon put it, his method became 'Seeing by doing' ('Catalogue of an Exhibition of Paintings by Members of a Workers' Educational Association Art Appreciation Group, Ashington Northumberland', YMCA hall, Ashington, December 1936, introduction). 
Starting with linocuts and proceeding after a couple of weeks to painting in whatever materials they could acquire, the men rapidly caught on to the idea. Many of the group had studied together before (taking classes in, for example, geology and evolution) and were used to looking out for one another on shift, so they were free and easy in company. The subjects that Lyon initially set them ('Rest', 'Dawn', 'Deluge') were given as homework and brought to the class for mutual criticism. Members of the group regarded their paintings as exercises to be checked over for accurate self-expression. In the words of one of the group's founding members,

Oliver Percival Kilbourn (1904-1993), 'We became enthralled with this and carried on to paint all we felt about our lives' (Kilbourn archive). Kilbourn, who became the group's best-known artist, was born on 6 October 1904 at 75 Chestnut Street, Ashington, the fifth child of James Smith Kilbourn ('b'. 1867/8), coalminer, and his wife, Mary Hannah, 'nee' Chilton ('b'. 1868/9). He was educated at the local elementary school and began work as a miner at the Duke pit, Ashington, three days after his thirteenth birthday. With the closure of the Duke pit, Kilbourn moved to the nearby Ellington colliery, where he became a coalface drawer aged twenty-four. He remained at Ellington for the rest of his working life, becoming a salvage drawer during the Second World War and a wasteman, responsible for the maintenance of the mine's airways, three years before his retirement in 1968. On 20 November 1952 he married Margaret Isabel 
(Peggy; 1914-2006)
, daughter of John Edward Parker, who worked as the librarian at Ashington public library. Kilbourn had attended tutorial classes organized by the Ashington Miners' Union and then the WEA since the mid-1920s, and it was through this route that he enrolled on Robert Lyon's art appreciation course in October 1934. 
Under Lyon's guidance the Ashington group concentrated on the familiar -- 'the things we knew about' as Kilbourn put it. That these subjects were extraordinary to those living beyond the coalfields soon became apparent, not least to Lyon. Keen to air what he termed 'an experiment in art appreciation', he arranged two exhibitions of the group's work in November and December 1936 -- first at the Hatton Gallery, Armstrong College, and then at the YMCA, Ashington -- and also introduced the group to Helen Sutherland, a wealthy patron and collector who lived at Rock Hall, near Alnwick. Writing later she recalled how she was moved by 'the vital freedom which the solidarity of the Group induces in its members and the rich diversity of accumulated experience commonly shared' (H. Sutherland, introduction, exhibition catalogue, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, June 1941). She in turn introduced members to some of the artists in her circle, notably David Jones and Ben Nicholson. In February 1936 she paid for a weekend trip to London to see exhibitions at the Royal Academy, National Gallery, and Tate Gallery, as well as to visit the Larkhall housing estate, Lambeth, and the studio of Alfred Hardiman where they viewed the sculptor's statue of Earl Haig, destined for Whitehall in the following year. According to another prominent member,

Harry Wilson (1898-1972), the London visit had a significant effect on the group's development: 'we began to feel like a unit, a group of people that had somewhere to go, something to do... it became almost a duty then to find something to do to justify the interest that had been taken in us. (Feaver, 'Pitmen Painters', 43)' As a result of being gassed during the First World War Wilson worked not as a miner but as a dental mechanic and insurance salesman. He had moved to Ashington in 1926 and made friends through attending meetings of the WEA, of which he became secretary in the following year. Wilson's painting 'East Wind' (1935; reproduced in two early magazine articles on the Ashington artists, by Lyon in 'The Listener', May 1935, and 'Mine', February 1936) quickly became an example of the group's interest in representing scenes from daily life. Lyon's 'Listener' article also reproduced 'The Miner' (1935) by (James) Leslie Brownrigg (1905-1976). Brownrigg, the son of James Robinson Brownrigg ('b'. 1872), police constable, and Sarah Ann, 'nee' Mather, had been born on 20 December 1905 at the police station, Alnwick; like Oliver Kilbourn he worked as a miner but later became an elementary school teacher. Along with Lyon, between 1936 and 1938 the Ashington artists also contributed essays on art appreciation for the 'Ashington Collieries Magazine': Brownrigg wrote on Leonardo da Vinci, Kilbourn considered modern art, while Wilson wrote on sculpture. 
Hailed as pioneer working-class artists, and with a growing following among southern radicals, the Ashington group faced the prospect of being both patronized and exploited. Tom Harrisson, the head of Mass-Observation, learned of the group from a 1938 'Listener' article. Harrisson and the artist Julian Trevelyan (who had Northumberland gentry connections) made contact and in October 1938 held a conference at Bensham Grove Settlement, Gateshead, on 'Vision and social realism', which featured a debate with members of the group, whose 'unprofessional painting' was shown alongside works by self-taught and 'outsider' artists. Harrisson's hopes for publicity (Tom Driberg, 'William Hickey' of the 'Daily Express', attended the conference) were dashed by the onset of the Munich crisis in the same week. Following the Bensham Grove conference the group's work was exhibited at several venues in London, and, in November, Lyon and Wilson travelled to Alexandra Palace to appear on the BBC television programme 'Picture Post' with Leslie Mitchell. But there was no further involvement with Mass-Observation, from which the Ashington artists, weary of Harrisson's zeal for endless particulars, readily dissociated. Their ambitions were keyed to art, not anthropology, as members had made clear in their contributions to the 'Ashington Collieries Magazine'. 'It is the artist's emotional reaction towards the scenes that holds you and not the mere representation itself', wrote the elementary school teacher George Rowe (Dec 1936, 337). In the words of Andy Foreman, another elementary teacher: 'it has been the aim of our experimental group to study art from within' (June 1937, 153). Some years later Kilbourn wrote: 'Below ground all the more rubbishy emotions are purged and instead strong comradeship prevails. I never paint dramatic accidents, although I have been in them, because I don't want to force people's emotions, I would like them to feel it in a more subtle way. (Kilbourn archive)' Aware of the virtues of limitation, the value of eyewitness, and the advantage of their circumstances, Kilbourn and the other Ashington artists took a pride in their independence. Until the mid-1960s the group numbered about fifteen. Of these half a dozen were exceptionally dedicated, notably Wilson, whose work emphasized the deprivation of daily life (for example, 'House Drain', 1938, which depicts backstreet open sewers); the miner Jimmy Floyd (1898-1974), whose artlessness was sustained with charm over forty years; and Kilbourn who, given the chance, would have gone to art school and become a professional artist: 'I'm not so sure now that I have missed out as I might have ended up painting like someone else if I had gone [to art school] and of course I would not have had the burning intensity to depict the mining life. (Kilbourn archive)' The outbreak of war brought a spate of fresh subject matter. Despite extra shifts, and duties in the Home Guard and ARP, members still made time for painting. 'The war hasn't finished us', wrote Arthur Fletcher Whinnom (1899-1962), a colliery cashier, in December 1939. 'We do our most intensive art-production in the winter months. Meaning blackout preparations and inconveniences and hours and hours of ARP and rotten travelling.' The group's subject matter reflected the times (for example Harry Wilson's 'Wartime Wedding', 1940, and Whinnom's 'Gas Mask for Baby', 1941) but equally, as Whinnom commented, members resisted 'subordinating everything to the idea of War; we finally decided to gang oor ain gait as we had always done -- paint what we wanted -- and to explore a bit' (Arthur Whinnom MSS, Kilbourn archive). The group's second show at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle (June 1941), was followed in August 1942 by a selling exhibition at the Lefevre Galleries, London, after which Lyon arranged for the paintings to be shown at the National Gallery of Scotland. 
No longer a WEA class, the group became self-sufficient when Robert Lyon moved to become principal of Edinburgh College of Art in the summer of 1942. Shortly before his move Lyon had completed a thesis on the 'Appreciation of art through the visual and practical approach' and he continued to broadcast on his experience with the Ashington painters, writing to them in April 1945 of the Ministry of Information's intensive use of ''The' Group... as part of their propaganda' (Feaver, 'Pitmen Painters', 130). In the following year a report on art in adult education by the Dartington Hall trustees identified Lyon as the 'teacher greatly responsible for the great success of the Ashington Group' and his students as 'the most interesting' of the societies then 'engaged in painting and handicrafts', a success attributed to its being 'a homogeneous group with long experience of working together' (ibid., 125-6). At Edinburgh, where he remained until his retirement in 1960, Lyon established the degree course in fine art and, as a painter, undertook murals for Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, the school of dentistry at King's College, London, and Essex County Hall, Chelmsford. 
Five years before Lyon's departure the group had bought a hut for $10 and erected it at Long Horsley, about 12 miles from Ashington, for use on summer weekends. In 1943 they took possession of it again (the hut having been commandeered by the army) and transferred it to Ashington on land belonging to the Ashington Coal Company with an annual ground rent of 1's'., later rising to 10's'. This became the group's meeting place for the next forty years, with members gathering each week to paint, discuss their work, or attend an illustrated lecture, usually presented by Oliver Kilbourn: 'We really loved our Hut as it was a focus of so much happiness and friendship. This helped keep us together', he later wrote (Kilbourn archive). The group's activities in this period included a second visit to London in January 1948, where they were invited to tour the British Museum. A 'News Chronicle' photographer caught them advancing down the steps of the Tate Gallery: heroes of the era of 'We are the masters now'. This confidence, built on a deep-seated sense of independence, was fostered by Lyon, who kept in regular contact and who supported the group's decision to distance itself from both national bodies, which sought to exploit their northern identity, and amateur art societies: 'Ashington does not need the stimulant of association with other groups -- or sketch clubs', he wrote to Arthur Whinnom in May 1953 (Feaver, 'Pitmen Painters', 132). The post-war period also saw changes in the group's membership, as founding members like Leslie Brownrigg became less active and were replaced by newcomers such as the craftsman joiner Len Robinson (1896-1987) and the colliery joiner, Fred Robson Laidler (1918-1988). 
By the early 1970s the Ashington group comprised ten active members and, after a period of relative obscurity, their work and practice of 'seeing by doing' now gained new publicity. Between January 1972 and April 1973 a selection of the group's permanent collection (numbering about 100 paintings stored in their hut) was exhibited at a series of British galleries, opening in Durham and concluding at London's Whitechapel Gallery. The paintings were later shown in Berlin (1977) and Rotterdam (1978), by which time, for safety, the collection had been transferred to a National Coal Board training centre in Newcastle. Oliver Kilbourn and his wife attended the exhibitions in Germany and the Netherlands and in the mid-seventies Kilbourn completed a series of thirty-eight paintings to tell the story of his working life; under the title 'My Life as Pitman' the paintings were shown in Nottingham in 1978 and in London a year later. 
In 1971 a film by Tristram Powell for the BBC told the story of the group through the recollections of Kilbourn, Wilson, Floyd, and Laidler, who discussed their work and revisited Rock Hall. Harry Wilson died on 20 February 1972, a month after the programme was broadcast, followed by Jimmy Floyd (1974), Leslie Brownrigg (December 1976), and the group's tutor, Robert Lyon, who died on 7 June 1978 at his home in Cavendish, Suffolk. Writing to the group from Edinburgh in 1945 Lyon had spoken of his seven years of classes at Ashington as ''high-lights' in an otherwise not uninteresting life' (Feaver, 'Pitmen Painters', 130); he was survived by his wife, Mabel, and their son, Peter, who achieved note as a sculptor. Powell's film was also seen by staff at the Chinese embassy and this led, in 1980, to an exhibition of the group's work in China under the auspices of the British Council. The exhibition, one of the first from the West following the cessation of the cultural revolution, began in Beijing and went on to tour the country's mining provinces. 
By 1982 the group's regular weekly attendance had dwindled to Kilbourn and another former miner, Jack Harrison (1904-2004). A year later the artists' hut was demolished and in 1988 Ashington colliery was closed. At this time the group's permanent collection was placed by its trustees, Oliver Kilbourn and William Feaver, in the Woodhorn Colliery Museum and in 2006 the paintings were installed in a purpose-built gallery at the museum. In the following year the activities of the group formed the subject of Lee Hall's play 'The Pitmen Painters', inspired by Feaver's book of the same title. Kilbourn, the longest surviving of the group's founders, died in April 1993. A continuous presence in the history of the Ashington artists, he was well placed to assess its motivation and the reasons for its success: 'A key factor in our long life, I think, was the fact that we were never a commercial group but preserved our idealism. We thought we were doing something that no one else could do. We were depicting a way of life both below and above ground in a mining village that only we knew by experiencing it. Life goes on and we paint life... A funny thing, once you've painted a picture, you feel it's part of your life. (Kilbourn archive)'

Duffield, William (c.1475-1537/8), Franciscan friar and suffragan bishop, was the last member of the English province of the Franciscan order (which was partitioned between the Observant reform and the Friars Minor Conventual from the middle of the fifteenth century) to be consecrated as a suffragan and to exercise his ministry under the gathering shadow of the dissolution of the mendicant houses. Following his career is complicated by severe problems of identification. In the last few decades of the English province there were three friars of this name who belonged to the custodies of Newcastle, York, and Coventry; two of them became doctors of theology. The first was at Newcastle when ordained deacon in the chapel of the south aisle of the nave of Durham Cathedral on 30 March 1499. He was one of the last members of that community to be ordained before the transfer of the friary to the Observant reform. The second was at York when ordained subdeacon on 18 September 1501 at the city's Greyfriars; he was at Hartlepool when he was ordained to the diaconate on 26 March 1502 in the lady chapel of York Minster. The third was at Worcester when ordained subdeacon on 29 May 1507 at St Mary's collegiate church, Warwick, and at Oxford at the time of his ordination to the diaconate in the chapel of St Mary on the bishop of Salisbury's manor at Ramsbury, Wiltshire, on 18 December 1507. Because the order's constitutions required candidates for ordination to have attained their twenty-fifth birthday, a tentative date of birth for the two northern friars would be about 1475 and a slightly later one for the friar from the midlands. 
The loss of the order's archives impedes the quest for fuller information on these three friars. Friars groomed for higher studies cut their theological teeth in the local friaries before being appointed to teach at the custodial schools. It was probably one of the two William Duffields from the custodies of Newcastle and York who took his doctorate in theology at the University of Cambridge in 1521-2, having previously lectured in the custodial schools. But the friar named William Duffield, also a doctor of theology, who on 20 December 1525 was licensed to preach in the diocese of Hereford with an indulgence of forty days for those who heard him, was most likely the one from the custody of Worcester. This friar can be identified with the warden of Shrewsbury who received a gallon of wine from the bailiffs of that town after he had preached to them. Four of the five ordinations recorded above were conducted by suffragan bishops, an office filled by several friars. Thus the prelate who conferred orders on 29 May 1507 was Ralph Haylesdon, a conventual Franciscan who was bishop of Ascalon from 1505 to 1523. 
By the later middle ages some English bishops selected their suffragans from the ranks of secular and regular clerics well known to them and trusted by them. While relatively few friars assisted in the diocese of Durham, some from the custody of York were consecrated as suffragans to assist the metropolitan. A friar conducting a ministry in the custody of York, with its houses in Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire, would also have been known to the bishop of Lincoln. John Moorman's view that the bishop hailed from one of the northern custodies is thus persuasive. Although the bishop's donation of his pontifical to the friary at Coventry enters a caveat, it was not in fact unusual for suffragans to move easily across the Humber and to be active in both dioceses. In the end there can be no absolute certainty as to which of these three friars was raised to the episcopate, but it seems very likely that it was a northern William Duffield, a conventual friar with the degree of doctor of theology, who was provided to the diocese of Ascalon by Pope Clement VII on 10 July 1531, on the recommendation of Paolo Emilio Cesi, cardinal-deacon of San Eustachio in Campo Marzio, and authorized to minister in the diocese of St Asaph. 
Thereafter Duffield's career as a suffragan bishop can be traced in some detail. Unlike his fellow Cambridge alumnus John Underwood, another Franciscan conventual who was bishop of Chalcedon between 1505 and 1541, and who held a series of benefices in the diocese of Norwich, Duffield was an itinerant suffragan, moving between the dioceses of Canterbury, Lincoln, St Asaph, and York. Henry Standish, a Franciscan who became bishop of St Asaph, licensed him to perform episcopal duties before he moved to the diocese of Lincoln, where nine of his confreres had ministered as suffragans between 1322 and 1530. John Longland, bishop of Lincoln, gave him a general commission on 12 November 1531 for the archdeaconries of Lincoln, Leicester, Northampton, Huntingdon, and Bedford. This licence permitted him to bless and dedicate altars, belfries, vestments, and altar vessels; he was also permitted to bless chapels, oratories, and cemeteries. In addition, he was authorized to ordain clerics to all major orders and to bless abbots, abbesses, widows, anchorites, and hermits. His presence in the diocese of Lincoln is attested by his admission to the guild of St Katherine the virgin at Stamford the following year. This may indicate that he was spending some time in the locality, if not the town perhaps at the local Greyfriars. He held ordinations on 30 March 1532 in Lincoln Cathedral, on 21 December 1532 in the prebendal church at Liddington, and on 13 April 1533 in the cathedral again. 
On 27 August 1533 Duffield was transferred as suffragan to Canterbury. His stay there seems to have been relatively brief because on 13 July 1535 Edward Lee, archbishop of York, gave him a suffragan commission. On 12 September 1536 he was licensed to consecrate the chapel of St Lawrence in the village of Elstronwick, in the parish of St Peter at Humbleton in Holderness. On 6 February 1536 he was delegated to hold an ordination at Greyfriars, York. In addition, he held ordinations at Whitefriars, York, on 1 April 1536 and at Austin Friars in the same city on 24 February 1537. Despite the fact that one Martin or Maternus was appointed bishop of Ascalon on 19 January 1534, Duffield continued to use that title. His pontifical, printed at Lyons in 1511, was purchased in London shortly after his consecration. The volume (now Harsnett Library, Colchester, H.h.14) was given to the friary at Coventry, a house dissolved in October 1538; this suggests that Duffield had died in 1537 or 1538.

Legge, (Mary) Dominica (1905-1986), French scholar and historian, was born on Sunday 26 March 1905, whence the name Dominica by which she chose to be known, at 38 Leinster Gardens, Bayswater, London, the second daughter of James Granville Legge (1861-1940), inspector of reformatory schools, later director of education in Liverpool, and his wife, Josephine, 'nee' Makins (died 1957). Her grandfather James Legge was a missionary in China before becoming the first professor of Chinese at the University of Oxford. She had three siblings, one of them the conductor Henry James Granville (Harry) Legge (1914-2000). 
Dominica Legge was educated at Liverpool College, Huyton, and Somerville College, Oxford, where she graduated with a second-class degree in French in 1926, having specialized in medieval French, and particularly in Anglo-Norman under the guidance of M. K. (Mildred) Pope. Anglo-Norman, more precisely the cultural and social relationships of continental and insular French from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, became the focus of the immense and influential research effort that occupied the rest of her life. She was awarded the degree of BLitt in 1928 for her thesis on the 'Lumiere as lais' of Pierre de Peckham, and (after serving as an editor for the Selden Society from 1928 to 1934) was appointed Mary Somerville research fellow in 1935, a position that enabled her to complete work on the edition of 'Anglo-Norman Letters and Petitions from All Souls MS 182', begun in collaboration with Maud V. Rose; the edition was published in 1941 by the Anglo-Norman Text Society, which Legge had helped to found in 1937. She was appointed assistant lecturer in French at Royal Holloway College, University of London, in 1938, assistant lecturer in French at University College, Dundee, in 1942, and lecturer in French at the University of Edinburgh in 1943, where she was promoted reader (1953) and professor, with a personal chair of French (Anglo-Norman studies), in 1968. 
A mark of Legge's stature as a scholar even early in her career is the distinction of those who chose her as a collaborator: Sir William Holdsworth for the edition of the 'Year Book of 10 Edward II' (1934) and Eugene Vinaver for the edition of 'Le Roman de Balain' (1942). However, it was her two monographs on Anglo-Norman culture, 'Anglo-Norman in the Cloisters' (1950) and 'Anglo-Norman Literature and its Background' (1963), that unequivocally established her reputation as the leading scholar in Anglo-Norman studies, while also consolidating the particular place of Anglo-Norman within French studies, becoming, according to A. H. Diverres, 'the standard guides to the field'. She was made a DLitt by the University of Oxford (1965) and an honorary fellow of Somerville College (1968) in recognition of her published research. The corpus of this is remarkable, running to seventy-two items between 1928 and 1986, excluding book reviews. Remarkable also is its range. A historian as much as a philologist and literary scholar, Legge put the patronage of texts and their social and historico-cultural context at the heart of her research, and actively promoted the notion that many works of medieval French literature, especially insular ones, were commissioned to mark notable events in the lives of patrons. Although this idea, like the sub-genre of the 'ancestral romance', which she championed, was later questioned, it remained a valuable concept in research. 
Legge's credentials as a historian saw her elected a fellow of the Royal Historical Society (1942) and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (1958). For the value of her general scholarly work she was elected corresponding fellow of the Medieval Academy of America (1971) and fellow of the British Academy (1974). In 1971 the French government appointed her an officer of the Ordre des Palmes Academiques. On her retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1973 she was granted the title of professor emerita. 
Legge was known for the trenchant and pithy expression of her views, especially on declining standards, remarking with dismay that 'students don't read Bacon any more', and commenting that the university's librarians 'in their ignorance catalogued Mill, 'On Liberty' alongside 'Mill on the Floss'' (private information). In reality, however, she was extremely generous and supportive to students and young colleagues, who would regularly be invited to her small flat at 204 Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh, the walls of which were covered with pictures mostly of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artists, including George du Maurier and J. B. Yeats; there they would be offered tea or coffee and warned to be careful with the cups because 'Oscar Wilde drank from them' (ibid.). She also regularly took students on historical and archaeological expeditions. 
In retirement Legge (who never married) lived at 191A Woodstock Road, Oxford. She continued to be very active in attending conferences and undertaking research, and working on her revision of Paul Meyer's edition of 'La vie de Guillaume le Marechal' for the Anglo-Norman Text Society. However, she suffered from cataracts and from problems with her knees, which hindered her efforts towards the end of her life. An operation for cataracts improved her sight temporarily, but an accident damaged an eye and negated its effects. A further fall required hospital treatment, after which she entered St Luke's Nursing Home in Latimer Road, Oxford. She died there of a pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis on 10 December 1986.

Orr, John (1885-1966), linguist and French scholar, was born on 4 June 1885 at 4 Cross Side, Egremont, Cumberland, the son of Peter Orr and his wife, Lillias Duncan, 'nee' Allan. His father, of Scottish origin, was a joiner; he emigrated to Australia with his family in 1885, settling first in Albany, Western Australia, then in Launceston, Tasmania, where Orr received his schooling. In 1902 he enrolled at the University of Tasmania with a scholarship, reading classics. In 1905 he won a Rhodes scholarship and entered Balliol College, Oxford, where, after a second in classical moderations in 1907, he graduated with a third-class degree in jurisprudence in 1909. His interests were wide and as an undergraduate he was president of the Arnold Society. He was tall and athletic, standing over six feet tall: he rowed in his college eight that went head of the river in 1907. Despite this he suffered ill health, especially a tendency to nervous depression all his life. A bout of this caused him to spend time in the south of France in 1910. There he met and married, on 5 March 1910, Augusta Berthe Brisac (died 1961), daughter of a French family settled in St Petersburg. They had one son. 
It was at this time that Orr's interest in medieval French and Romance linguistics developed; he studied in Paris at the Sorbonne, the Ecole des Hautes-Etudes, the College de France, and the Ecole des Langues Orientales under a number of masters including Joseph Bedier, Jules Gillieron, and Mario Roques. In 1913, on completion of his BLitt thesis, an edition of 'Les oeuvres de Guiot de Provins', he was appointed assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester. In 1915 he moved to a lectureship at East London College. At the beginning of the First World War he had joined the officer training corps in Manchester, and in 1916 he was seconded first to the Admiralty and then to the Military Intelligence Corps, serving in London and in France. 
In 1919 Orr was appointed to the chair of French at the University of Manchester; he moved to the chair of French at the University of Edinburgh in 1933. Although he published a number of significant articles while in Manchester, it was in Edinburgh that his publishing career blossomed with his revised and augmented translation of Iorgu Iordan's 'Introduction to Romance Linguistics' (1937), and his major essay, 'On homonymics' (in 'Studies in French Language and Mediaeval Literature presented to M. K. Pope', 1939). 
The Second World War was far from kind to Orr: his son was killed in action with the Royal Air Force in June 1944, and he himself suffered a serious breakdown lasting from 1940 until 1943. However, 1944 brought an event that stimulated all his energies and brought out his best qualities as an organizer, a lover of France, and a networker. The destruction of Caen and its university by allied bombardments in July galvanized Orr, who founded the Edinburgh-Caen Fellowship to bring relief to the city and its population. His first proposal that Edinburgh should adopt Caen was rejected by the British government as inappropriate, but his tireless work and correspondence with members of the government, the duchess of Sutherland, the countess of Rosebery, and members of the French government in exile saw the fellowship operative by October 1944 and formally established as a war charity on 13 April 1945. Contributions in kind -- books for the devastated university library, clothes and food for the citizens -- and money flowed in. In recognition of his efforts Orr was invited to attend at the reopened University of Caen on 13 December 1945 to receive a doctorate 'honoris causa'. The rector of the Academie de Caen regretted that he could not invite Orr to speak on that occasion, but would invite him specially to lecture later, 'when the largest hall in the town would not hold the audience of grateful citizens who would want to listen' to him (R. Mazel, 30 Nov 1945, U. Edin. L., MS gen. 868/32). The rue du professeur John Orr in Caen was named in his honour. 
After the war Orr continued his academic career, publishing many more articles and reviews, editions of Eustache d'Amiens, 'Le boucher d'Abbeville' (1947), and Jehan Renart, 'Le lai de l'ombre' (1948), and a collection of essays, 'Words and Sounds in English and French' (1953). Correspondence associated with his edition of 'Contes et poemes' by Jules Supervielle (1950) led to a lasting and close friendship with the author. In 1951 Orr realized that the changed circumstances of higher education in Britain required a restructuring of his department. At his own urgent request the University of Edinburgh created a new chair of French literature and renamed Orr's chair that of French language and Romance linguistics. He held this chair until his retirement in 1955, serving also as the dean of the faculty of arts in 1950-54. 
Orr had always been committed to work beyond the university: in the 1920s and 1930s he had served on the committees of the Whitworth Institute and Manchester City Art Gallery; in the 1950s he was Edinburgh University's representative on the city of Edinburgh education committee, a member of the board of Edinburgh College of Art, and honorary vice-president of the Society of Scottish Artists. His efforts were instrumental in the founding of the Institut Francais d'Ecosse in 1946. From 1953 to 1955 his diplomatic skills saved the Societe de Linguistique Romane from the extinction that had threatened it at its congress in Barcelona in 1953. He became president of the society in 1965. From 1957 to 1959 he suffered a relapse of his nervous illness, forcing his resignation from the executive council of the 'Scottish National Dictionary': a letter from the editor recalled that it was Orr's intervention, bringing the editorial team to the University of Edinburgh, 'which saved the dictionary from coming to an untimely end' (David Murison to John Orr, 26 June 1959, U. Edin. L., MS gen. 868/34). 
Orr was much appreciated as a lecturer by students and colleagues alike. The interview of him published by the University of Edinburgh newspaper 'Student' in its series 'Elders and betters' brought out both his sharp mind and his great charm. The affection he inspired in his colleagues can best be seen in the correspondence between Orr and Georges Poulet in December 1950 in which Poulet's disappointment at being passed over for the second chair of French in Edinburgh was tempered by expressions of admiration for the man he still called his friend. In this matter Orr showed a hard-headedness with a distinctly modern ring, as he advised Poulet that his decision to concentrate on pure research to the exclusion of administrative responsibility made him unfit to lead a university department in the climate of post-war Britain. A similar blend of scientific rigour and a challenging sense of humour infused his research: among his many articles were those on 'bougre', 'foutre', and words with similarly 'scabrous' etymologies. This unconventional side of his nature extended to his producing a mock epic poem, 'La geste des chinchons', satirizing the organization of, and the Franco government's impact on, the congress of the Societe de Linguistique Romane held in Barcelona in 1953. 
Orr's many achievements earned him appropriate honours: he was elected a fellow of the British Academy (1952), received the Encomienda de Alfonso X el Sabio (1953), became president of the Modern Humanities Research Association (1954) and of the Association Internationale des Etudes Francaises (1955-7), was promoted commander of the Legion d'honneur (1955), was elected corresponding fellow of the Real Academia de Buenas Letras de Barcelona (1957), and was president of the International Federation of Modern Languages and Literatures (1963-6). In addition to Caen he received honorary doctorates from the universities of Manchester, St Andrews, and the Sorbonne. He died in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 10 August 1966 following a heart attack. His obituary in 'The Times' described him as 'the doyen and outstanding representative of Romance philology in Britain, and in the English-speaking world' ('The Times', 15 Aug 1966), a well-deserved accolade, which was consecrated by its being quoted to illustrate the usage of the word 'doyen' in the revised edition of 'Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable' in 1981.

Marriage, Ellen (1865-1946), translator, was born on 23 August 1865 at Laboratory Yard, Stratford, Essex, the eldest of the four children of James Haworth Marriage (1839-1913), confectionery manufacturer, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Brookfield (1835-1899). She spent her early life in George Lane, South Woodford. The family had Quaker roots, and accordingly all four children were sent to Quaker schools, the son, Ernest, to Sidcot in Somerset, Ellen and her sisters, Caroline and Elizabeth, to The Mount in York. Ellen's stay there lasted from January 1880 to June 1883; she retained fond memories of the place, but it was Elizabeth who achieved the greatest academic success, proceeding in 1893 to Newnham College and thence to scholarly research into German folksong. Ellen became a (reluctant) office-worker: 'The invoice clerk -- that is me -- had such piles of invoices to make that he could do nothing else -- none of his other work.' The 'other work' included wide reading in English and French and experiments with writing: 'Don't you like to draw sketches and to find the best words... to give the effect you mean and search after? I have hundreds, almost, now' (Ellen Marriage to Elizabeth Marriage, 20 April 1889, priv. coll.). 
It was the literary scholar A. R. Waller, a friend and neighbour of the Marriages, who suggested Ellen Marriage as translator when he put forward the idea of a complete edition of Balzac's 'Comedie humaine' to the publisher J. M. Dent. Up to this time no complete edition had been published in England, although a few novels had appeared singly since the 1850s and a complete edition was coming out in America between 1885 and 1896. (Strictly speaking, neither edition was truly 'complete', as both omitted the most 'shocking' works, 'La physiologie du mariage', 'Sarrasine', 'La fille aux yeux d'or', 'Une passion dans le desert', and 'Petites miseres de la vie conjugale'.) Under George Saintsbury's editorship, all forty volumes were completed between 1895 and 1898, an immense task for which Marriage eventually had to be assisted by Clara Bell. In addition one volume was translated by Rachel Scott and several by a 'James Waring'. However, this was apparently a pseudonym: according to Frank Swinnerton, who worked in Dent's office in the 1900s, Waring was 'none other than Ellen Marriage working under a masculine name [for the bolder works]. Whether this prudishness was Dent's or the translator's I do not know' ('Background', 68). Swinnerton's evidence was only hearsay, but the styles of Ellen Marriage and James Waring are certainly similar. 
Of the forty volumes of the Dent edition of the 'Comedie humaine', several containing more than one work, Marriage translated nineteen and James Waring seven. Marriage took far greater trouble over them than was then common with translations of French novels, not only searching for 'the best words' but visiting France to check local details and grappling manfully with Balzac's specialized vocabularies: 'I have some heraldry that has fairly beaten me. There seems nothing left but the desperate step -- a lunatic's step -- of going to the College of Arms and trying what impudence will do' (Ellen Marriage to Elizabeth Marriage, 3 Jan 1896, priv. coll.). The results were justifiably admired; her versions, particularly the descriptions and narration, often have the 'colour and swing' she admired in other writers and usually avoid the unnatural literalness that had characterized many earlier versions. Dent incorporated several of the novels into his 'Everyman's Library', begun in 1906, and many long remained in print. Financially they were less rewarding; at the height of her career Marriage was receiving '$3 to $4' for what she could translate in a week. 
The prolonged effort and isolation of the Balzac translations exhausted Marriage; she confided to her sister Elizabeth that she did not want to become involved in such a project again. She published only three further translations: Henri Murger's 'Scenes de la vie de boheme' in 1901 and Marcel Prevost's 'Frederique' (1900) and 'Lea' (1902). In 1901 she was admitted to Nayland Sanatorium in Suffolk, suffering from neurasthenia. During her seven-month stay she met the journalist (Fydell) Edmund Garrett (1865-1907), whose terminal tuberculosis had brought him to Nayland. As they lay on adjacent 'long chairs' they discovered common interests in life and literature; they were married on 26 March 1903 and took up residence first in Windy Park, St Ives, and later in a cottage at Wiverton Acre near Plympton, Devon. After Garrett's death Ellen moved back to the south-east, where she 'collected and arranged' his translation of 'Lyrics and Poems from Ibsen' and revised the translation of 'Brand' he had published in 1894; the whole was published by Dent in 1912. 
For a period from 1910 Ellen Garrett took an interest in the suffragist activities of her husband's cousins Millicent Garrett Fawcett and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, and worked with 'Common Cause', the suffragist newspaper. Her journalistic contacts proved useful from the First World War onwards, when she contributed articles, usually anonymously, to various journals, including the 'Manchester Guardian', the 'Westminster Gazette', and 'The Observer'. Several of these were on political or social aspects of Bulgaria; in 1904 her sister Elizabeth had married Constantin Mincoff, a Bulgarian diplomat. For most of the 1920s Ellen lived in Elgin Crescent, Notting Hill, moving in the early 1930s to The Folley in Wells Road, Malvern. She died on 23 December 1946 at South Grove, Abbey Road, Malvern, Worcestershire, of heart failure.

Hazlitt, William (1811-1893), editor and translator, was born in Winterslow, Wiltshire, on 26 November 1811, the only surviving child of William Hazlitt (1778-1830), writer and painter, and his wife, Sarah, 'nee' Stoddart (1774-1840). From 1812, when the elder Hazlitt had secured a regular post as a parliamentary reporter on the 'Morning Chronicle', the family lived together in Westminster. In 1819, however, the parents separated, the younger William staying mainly with his mother. His upbringing was consequently unsettled; his parents frequently quarrelled and, according to acquaintances, he learned to play off one against the other, becoming very spoiled in the process -- when he was eight John Keats called him 'that little Nero' (Hazlitt, 'Four Generations', 1.106). He had attended at least three different small schools by the age of eleven and for a time was taught by Mary Lamb, alongside Mary Novello, the future Mary Cowden Clarke; at thirteen he was sent to a school run by a Unitarian pastor, William Evans, near Tavistock in Devon. But despite all difficulties his father remained as close to him as he could. In 1827, for example, he had 'his boy' with him for a short stay in Paris. 
When Hazlitt's father died, virtually penniless, in 1830, Hazlitt was left with neither professional training nor inherited income. To the end his father had hoped to leave him with an independence. At the same time various plans to qualify him for some career had been thought of and abandoned; his father had envisaged him as 'a good painter, if such a thing could be hoped' (Howe, 17.99), while his mother had thought at one time that he might become a singer after lessons with John Braham. In fact he followed his father into the literary trade. With the aid of the radical newspaper editor William Coulson -- a member, like his father, of the Lambs' circle -- he too became a parliamentary reporter and reviewer on the 'Morning Chronicle'. At the same time he was editing the 'Literary Remains of the Late William Hazlitt', to which he contributed a biographical preface; it was published in 1836. In the same year he also brought out a new edition of his father's 'Principles of Human Action'. 
From about 1824 Hazlitt had been frequenting the family of Carew Reynell, one of his father's printers; on 8 September 1833 he married Reynell's daughter Catherine (died 1860). At first they lived over a cabinet-maker's at 76 Charlotte Street, London, where their son William Carew Hazlitt was born in 1834, then at various other lodgings until they settled in Ovington Square, Brompton, in 1838. Life was a struggle; William Carew Hazlitt described his father as constantly searching for a permanent post until he was forty-three. In the meantime Hazlitt produced new editions of many of his father's works, as well as writing for a variety of journals, including the 'Daily News' and 'The Times' as well as the 'Morning Chronicle'. 
In the same period Hazlitt also edited the publisher David Bogue's enterprising 'European Library' (later taken over by H. G. Bohn) and himself contributed various translations to it, including Alfred de Vigny's 'Cinq-Mars' (1847) and Luther's 'Table Talk' (1848). He also translated books for other publishers and edited several, most notably perhaps the 'Works' of Defoe in three volumes, to which he added a memoir of the author (1840-43). In 1839 he started his own 'Romancist and Novelist's Library', whose contents were published first as twopenny numbers and then in book form; translations were to be 'a very important feature of the work', he wrote to Leigh Hunt in March 1839 (Gates, 345). The 'Library' included works by Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Paul de Kock, Goethe, Schiller, and Ida Pfeiffer, as well as by such historians and travel writers as Francois Guizot, Augustin Thierry, Jules Michelet, and Evariste Huc. His translation of Hugo's 'Notre-Dame de Paris' was the first in the field, appearing only two years after the original as 'Notre Dame: a Tale of the 'Ancien Regime'' (1833), with a 'literary and political preface' comparing the lawlessness of 'ancien regime' France with the 'regime of conquest' underlying modern British society. 
In November 1854 Hazlitt at last achieved an official appointment, becoming registrar of the London bankruptcy court, where he remained until his retirement. In collaboration with H. P. Roche he wrote books on the 'Bankruptcy and Debtors' Acts' of 1861 and 1869; a further edition, revised by R. Ringwood, covered the act of 1893. Catherine Hazlitt had died in 1860. Hazlitt himself survived until 21 February 1893, when he died at his home, Oakfield, Addlestone, Chertsey, Surrey, of colic and cardiac failure.

Baldick, Robert Andre Edouard (1927-1972), French scholar and translator, was born on 9 November 1927 at 69 Heaton Road, Paddock, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, the only son of George Sidney Baldick, schoolmaster, and his French wife, Marie Octavie Angela, 'nee' Marielle. He was educated at Royds Hall Grammar School, Huddersfield, and Queen's College, Oxford, where he read French and German, graduating with a first in 1948. In 1952 he was awarded his DPhil for a groundbreaking thesis on the French novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans. After a brief stint as assistant lecturer at the University of Glasgow he returned to Oxford in 1953 as lecturer in French at Pembroke and University colleges. He was appointed fellow and tutor in French at Pembroke in 1958. On 29 July 1949 he married Grace Evelyn Adlam (1928-2000), only child of Percy W. Adlam, municipal accountant. They had three children, (Robert) Julian, Christopher, and Hilary (Julian and Christopher became university teachers, of Islamic studies and English respectively, while Hilary worked for the BBC). They were divorced in 1967, and on 21 October the same year he married Jacqueline Anne (Jackie) Harrison, a native of Baltimore and graduate of Cornell University, with whom he had a son, Nicholas, later a political campaign strategist in the USA, and a daughter, Oriel, who became a clinical psychiatrist in Texas. 
Known to his colleagues as Bob, Baldick specialized in vivid recreations of nineteenth-century Parisian literary and cultural life. In addition to biographies of Huysmans (1955), Frederick Lemaitre (1959), and Henry Murger ('The First Bohemian', 1961), and anthologies of extracts from the autobiographical writings of Chateaubriand and the Goncourt brothers, he published an introduction to the Goncourts (1960) and a narrative of the siege of Paris (1964), which, like the biographies of Huysmans and Lemaitre, was translated into French. He also wrote a history of duelling (1965). His last book, 'Dinner at Magny's' (1971), the French translation of which he wrote himself, is an authentic reconstruction of racy conversations between members of the celebrated 1860s dining club. Its dustwrapper depicts the bearded author plausibly seated at table in the company of Flaubert, George Sand, and others. (Joanna Richardson alleged he resembled in appearance the poet Jose-Maria de Heredia.) The photograph was taken against the nineteenth-century French wallpaper of the senior common room of Keble College, with the portraits of Keble and Newman suitably obscured. Various colleagues, together with Jacqueline Baldick, posed for the majority of the figures, their heads subsequently replaced by the writers' own. At the time of his death, he had completed much of the research for a biography of Zola. 
Baldick's life of Huysmans, based partly on unpublished material belonging to his friend the scholar and bookseller Pierre Lambert, was his major scholarly achievement, and fundamentally changed perceptions of a much misunderstood figure. Taken together, his books reveal his commitment to rescuing minor figures from comparative oblivion, his eye for a story, and his stylish writing. They attest furthermore to his prominence in an Oxford tradition of nineteenth-century French studies that, in the wake of Enid Starkie, not only accorded a privileged role to biography, but also encouraged a crossing of the divide between the academy and the wider world of letters. His literary judgements were those of a connoisseur, his finely judged distribution of criticism and praise resembling his assessment of the Pembroke wine cellar, of which he was the appreciative steward. 
Bilingual from infancy, and having spent his national service translating for the RAF, Baldick produced English versions of two of Huysmans's early works before making his mark, in 1959, with an influential translation of the same author's 'A rebours' ('Against Nature'). There followed accomplished renderings of works by Flaubert, Sartre, Jules Verne, and a host of other writers and scholars, both classical and contemporary. As befitted his own phenomenal productivity, he translated a number of novels by Simenon, dictating his version directly into a machine. The majority appeared under pseudonyms. Male and female pseudonyms, among them a lewd Flaubertian pun, were employed for further translations, including a streamlined version of the fifteenth-century 'Cent nouvelles nouvelles', a widely read selection of short stories, and an additional range of nineteenth-century masterpieces. As editor of the 'Oxford Library of French Classics' and joint editor of 'Penguin Classics' he did much to raise standards of translation and improve the status of the literary translator. 
In addition to presenting radio talks on various nineteenth-century French subjects Baldick translated a number of plays for the BBC, several of which were later staged. Other plays translated by him, including work by new dramatists such as Georges Schehade and Eduardo Manet, also led to stage productions. His translation of Jean-Louis Barrault's 'Rabelais' was performed at the Roundhouse and in New York, and his adaptation of Camus's 'Les justes' at the Mermaid. Plans for a dramatized version of 'Dinner at Magny's' in collaboration with Vivian Cox were interrupted by his death, which also prevented him from seeing the television drama his close friend Terry Nation had written under the title 'The Incredible Dr Baldick'; it featured an eccentric Victorian aristocrat given to investigating mysteries. He wrote regular reviews of new novels for the 'Daily Telegraph'. One such was devoted to 'Last Exit to Brooklyn', and he appeared as a defence witness at the obscenity trial. 
A convivial companion and storyteller, Baldick was a flamboyant figure who skilfully adapted the mores of a nineteenth-century Frenchman to the age in which he lived. He counted among his friends Maurice Druon, the French academician, and Brian Aldiss, the science fiction writer. He was a member of the Savile Club and the Winegrowers of Chateauneuf du Pape, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1957. He died of a cerebral tumour at the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 24 April 1972, and was survived by his wife, Jackie, and his five children.

Gilbert, (Arthur) Stuart Ahluwalia Stronge (1883-1969), Indian civil servant, translator, and literary scholar, was born on 25 October 1883 in Kelvedon Hatch, near Brentwood, Essex, the only child of Major Arthur Stronge Gilbert, retired army officer, and his wife, Melvina, 'nee' Rundiher Singh Ahluwalia (1860-1919), daughter of the rajah of Kapurthala and his Anglo-Indian wife, also Melvina. His father was born in Dublin about 1833 and served in the Donegal Militia Artillery, the 36th foot (in which he served during the New Zealand Wars of 1863-4), and the 70th foot before transferring to the reserve list in 1870; he took up various directorships, and married Gilbert's mother in 1883 in Epsom. In the 1891 census the family was listed as living at Kelvedon Hatch with two servants. They later moved to Cheltenham. 
Gilbert was educated at Dean Close Memorial School, Cheltenham, at Cheltenham College, and at Hertford College, Oxford, where he took a first in classical moderations in 1904 and a second in 'literae humaniores' in 1906. In 1907 he joined the Indian Civil Service and was posted to Burma, where he served as an assistant commissioner and postal censor and then, after war service as a lieutenant in the no. 3 Burma Ford Van Company (1916-19), a judge in Moulmein and Rangoon. He took early retirement in 1927. Meanwhile, he had in 1919, while on leave, married a Frenchwoman, Marie Agnes Mathilde (Moune), 'nee' Douin. 
In 1927 Gilbert and his wife settled in Paris, where they remained (with the exception of the Second World War years, when they lived in Wales) for the remainder of their lives. It was soon after moving to Paris, when strolling past Shakespeare and Company, the bookshop founded by Sylvia Beach on the rue de l'Odeon, and a favourite meeting point for Anglophone authors, that their lives changed permanently. The window display included some pages from 'Ulysses', in a French translation by Auguste Morel and Valery Larbaud, in which Gilbert noticed a number of errors and interpolations. Beach recommended that Gilbert leave his contact details and said that Joyce would contact him. He did, and a lifelong collaboration ensued, leading not only to Gilbert becoming a literary translator (initially helping to translate 'Ulysses' into French; later, unusually, he translated both from English to French and from French to English) but to the publication of Gilbert's seminal work 'James Joyce's Ulysses: a Study' in 1930 and the first volume of Joyce's 'Collected Letters' in 1957. 
The Gilberts and the Joyces became close friends and Richard Ellmann's biography of Joyce documents numerous holidays taken together in Salzburg, Le Havre, and Dublin, or staying at the Imperial Hotel in Torquay. Moune and Stuart Gilbert were also instrumental in persuading Nora Joyce not to leave her husband on repeated occasions. The Joyces were regular visitors at the salon the Gilberts established in their gracious top-floor apartment at 7 rue Jean du Bellay on the Ile Saint-Louis, with its spectacular views over the Seine. Guests were treated to what Peter du Sautoy called 'uninhibited comments on the literary figures of Paris' from their host ('The Times', 14 Jan 1969). Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford, Samuel Beckett, and D. H. Lawrence visited, as did a number of Gilbert's professional acquaintances, the company reflecting the close relationships between writers and publishers of the period. 
Gilbert's reputation as a literary translator was based less on his translations of Joyce into French than of contemporary French authors, most of whom he knew personally, into English. He presented a heterogeneous mix of innovative newcomers, including Albert Camus, Jean Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, Georges Simenon, and Antoine de Saint-Exupery; Andre Malraux became a particularly close friend. In practice, Moune -- as the native French-speaker -- was an active co-translator but what Ellmann described as her husband's 'conscientious and wittily sceptical temperament' (Ellmann, 600) was fundamental. Together with Moune, Stuart Gilbert was almost single-handedly responsible for introducing a whole generation of contemporary French authors to a new readership. He translated not only well-known works of fiction but the plays of Camus, the memoirs of Saint-Exupery, the art history of Malraux, and the philosophy of the existentialists. In the last decade of his life he translated many texts to accompany art books, notably those published by Albert Skira of Geneva. 
However, 'Ulysses' and, to a lesser degree, 'Finnegan's Wake' remained closest to Gilbert's heart. In his preface to the first edition of 'James Joyce's Ulysses: a Study', Gilbert wrote: 'In writing this commentary I have borne in mind the unusual circumstance that, although 'Ulysses' is probably the most discussed literary work that has appeared in our time, the book itself is hardly more than a name to many. I have therefore quoted freely from the text, so that those who are unable... [to] acquire the original may, despite the censorial ban, become acquainted with Mr. Joyce's epic work. (p. 9)' The revised edition was published twenty years later in a wholly altered social context, and Gilbert accordingly noted: 'I have not tried to alleviate the rather pedantic tone of much of the writing in this study. For one thing, Joyce approved of it... Moreover, in those early days most readers and many eminent critics regarded Ulysses as a violently romantic work, an uncontrolled outpouring of the unconscious mind... it was necessary to emphasise the 'classical' and formal elements... and the minute attention given by the author to detail, each phrase, indeed each word, being assigned its place with 'pointilliste' precision. (Preface, 1952 edn, 12)' Thus Gilbert's degree in classics and detailed knowledge of the ancient world stood him in good stead in rooting 'the voyage to Ithaca'. He took issue with the 'stream of consciousness' form of modernism and its use in interpreting Joyce. In his foregrounding of the conscious mind, his primary acknowledgement was 'my indebtedness to James Joyce himself, to whose assistance and encouragement this work owes whatever merit it may possess' (ibid., 13). 
Gilbert and Joyce invented puns and traded epithets, from the facetious to the sardonic. Joyce claimed to have obtained some words from the Burmese grammar compiled by Gilbert which he 'borrowed and did not return' (Ellmann, 600). When 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' competed with 'Ulysses' as the erudite Parisian tourist's must-have, Joyce asked Gilbert to read him some pages from it. He listened carefully before summarizing his response in one word: 'Lush'. He then instructed Gilbert: 'That man really dresses very badly. You might ask instead for something from his friend Aldous Huxley, who at least dresses decently' (ibid., 615). The diaries, notebooks, typescripts, manuscripts, letters, postcards, photographs, and other items kept by Gilbert, and now in the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin, bear witness to the extent to which this was not simply a working relationship and to the fun the Gilberts and Joyces enjoyed in each other's company. Gilbert outlived Joyce by twenty-eight years, dying at his home in Paris on 5 January 1969. Moune died in 1985.

Pykenham, William (d. 1497), lawyer and ecclesiastic, was one of four sons of John Pykenham (died 'c'.1436), a successful lawyer who probably came from a prosperous London merchant family, and his wife, Katherine Barrington. His mother was a member of a prominent Essex gentry family, with estates held of the crown in Hatfield Broadoak and elsewhere, and she herself inherited a moiety of the manor of Otes, High Laver (possibly her birthplace), from her grandmother's family -- her great-grandfather Sir Thomas Enfield had held it early in the fifteenth century. William studied first at Cambridge and then at Oxford (1450-65), where he was made a fellow of All Souls College in 1456. Despite occasional brushes with the university authorities -- in 1456 he was briefly imprisoned for carrying weapons and striking a man with his fist, and two years later he was in trouble for insulting the chancellor's commissary-general -- he emerged with bachelor's degrees in civil and canon law and a doctorate in canon law. In 1457 he was employed by Osney Abbey, Oxford, as its proctor. 
Prepared by his education for a career in the law and in the church, the worldly success he enjoyed and the patronage he was able to attract have led to William Pykenham's being described as 'one of the cleverest young men of his generation' (Richmond, 'John Hopton', 216). At one time or another he held some sixteen ecclesiastical benefices, in Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Kent. His qualifications and intelligence apart, he owed these preferments mostly to the Bourchier family. His father's clients included Anne of Woodstock, countess of Stafford, whose third husband had been Sir William Bourchier, raising the possibility of an inherited connection, and, while he was a student in Cambridge, Pykenham could also have encountered Anne's son Thomas, a future archbishop of Canterbury, when the latter was bishop of Ely. But the strongest link with the Bourchiers was through his mother's family, the Barringtons, who like them had long been established in Essex. It was Henry Bourchier, Baron Bourchier and later first earl of Essex, Countess Anne's eldest son, who in 1461, while Pykenham was still at Oxford, presented him to his first living, the rectory of Little Hallingbury, Essex. A year later he was presented to another Essex rectory, that of Rayleigh, by his mother's cousin Thomas Barrington. He also enjoyed the patronage of bishops Walter Lyhert and James Goldwell of Norwich; the former made him archdeacon of Suffolk in 1472, the most important appointment of his whole career, and later named him as one of the executors of his will. Pykenham also came to hold a number of other important offices and positions. Again in 1472 Bishop Thomas Kemp of London collated him to the prebend of Wenlocksbarn in St Paul's Cathedral. In 1481 he was appointed keeper of the spiritualities of the see of Ely, and also chancellor of the archbishop of Canterbury and the latter's prelocutor in convocation; the prebend of Leighton Buzzard in Lincoln Cathedral, and that of Gaia Major in Lichfield Cathedral, followed in 1483 and 1485 respectively. His final preferment came in 1493, when he was presented to the deanship of the college of St John the Baptist, Stoke by Clare, Suffolk. 
Pykenham's benefactors expected something in return for their liberality. As an able lawyer he seems to have been constantly in demand, notably as a trustee of the earl of Essex's estates from 1475 to 1493, and later a feoffee for his sons. He enjoyed, too, a lifelong professional association, and friendship, with Thomasine Barrington, another Essex cousin, and her third husband, John Hopton of Blythburgh, an important landowner in Suffolk, Yorkshire, and elsewhere. In 1486 he was an executor of the will of Archbishop Thomas Bourchier, as might have been expected, but it is a sign of the range of his professional contacts (and perhaps also of his political affiliations) that in 1495 he should have been called upon to act in that capacity for the great Yorkist matriarch Cecily, duchess of York. Pykenham's training as a civil lawyer gave him a specialized interest in maritime law, making him a natural person for John Hopton to employ in a long-running dispute with the authorities of Dunwich over the town's harbour. After years of wrangling the king's intervention ended the dispute in Hopton's favour, probably in May 1466. Three years later Pykenham was one of the commissioners appointed to hear another maritime case, an appeal against a judgment given in the admiralty court. 
At this stage in his career Pykenham was probably sustained by one of his two Essex livings. In 1470, however, Archbishop Bourchier presented him to the living of Hadleigh, Suffolk (an archiepiscopal peculiar), and Pykenham moved into the rectory there. Then, on his becoming archdeacon of Suffolk two years later, he took up residence in the substantial Ipswich archdeaconry premises, on the north side of the town church, St Mary-le-Tower. At this stage of his career his architectural ambitions were relatively limited, and he seems to have confined himself to rebuilding the modest gatehouse. But the emoluments of his ecclesiastical offices, along with his legal fees, must have been growing, so much so that about 1485 his considerable wealth enabled him to build a monumental three-storey gate-tower, housing a suite of elegant living quarters, at the west end of Hadleigh church. With its latrine tower on the south side, it boasted a series of apartments suitable for a man of his status. Indeed the architecture is unmistakably ambitious, in both artistic and social terms, looking back to such East Anglian models as Lord Cromwell's Tattershall Castle, begun in the 1430s, and Oxburgh Hall, more recently constructed by Sir Edmund Bedingfield. Function and appearance alike proclaimed Pykenham's determination to attain the elegance and comfort aspired to by other members of the ecclesiastical elite in the late fifteenth century. 
William Pykenham died in 1497, between 6 April, when he drew up his will, and 8 May, when it was proved. What must be his Purbeck marble tomb (it also served as an Easter sepulchre) survives on the north side of the high altar in Hadleigh church. He had provided for the saying of 1000 masses by 1000 priests for his own soul and for the souls of his parents, but otherwise his most significant legacy to an individual was that of $10 and two long gowns to Thomasine Risley, perplexingly described as 'my sister' but not otherwise recorded as a member of his family. But if Pykenham does not seem to have remembered his kinsfolk, he was generous to his employees. It is a further sign of his standing and wealth that at his death he should have maintained a household of at least nineteen servants, all named in his will, where provision was made for their being given food and drink and their usual wages for three months after their employer's death, and they also received gifts of money. 
Otherwise Pykenham's bequests were almost entirely ecclesiastical ones. He left his accumulated lands in trust to support almshouses (effectively a refoundation of the pre-existing poorhouse), a chantry chapel in Hadleigh, and also the college at Stoke by Clare, to which he was generous in other ways, leaving $20 to complete building works he had begun there, 'a great Bassyn of sylver parcel gylt' valued at $17, and all his books of law and theology. He also left a copy of Jean d'Abbeville's sermons, and three separately bound commentaries by Nicolas Gorran -- which are now in the British Library -- to the hospital of St Thomas of Acon, London. All Souls College was given a noble cope of red and gold and $20, and there were bequests to a number of religious houses, nearly all in Suffolk. Moreover William remembered a high proportion of the livings of which he had at some time been parson. Little Hallingbury, his first benefice, was to have 66's'. 8died for a cope; otherwise he usually left money to the incumbent and the poor inhabitants of each parish, and typically for the fabric of their churches as well. Throughout his will Pykenham showed himself concerned for the relief of poverty. His funeral was not to be excessively grand, so that the money saved could be given to the needy, and when all his bequests had been disbursed the residue of his moveable wealth was to be spent on charitable works, and especially on provision for poor scholars at Oxford or Cambridge. 
Given his outstanding intellectual abilities, the success of Pykenham's career seems almost preordained. Only one thing was lacking, a bishopric. In the last years of Yorkist rule vacancies on the episcopal bench were scarce, and Thomas Bourchier was becoming old and frail. Even so, Pykenham could probably have expected elevation in due course, had it not been for the change of dynasty in 1485. The new king, and then a new primate, had their own candidates for preferment, and his archdeaconry remained the summit of William's career.

Hunt, Edgar Hubert (1909-2006), musician, was born on 28 June 1909 at 2 Upper Byron Place, Clifton, Bristol, the only son and elder child of Hubert Walter Hunt (1865-1945), organist and master of the choristers at Bristol Cathedral, and his wife, Clara Harriett Clements, teacher and singer, daughter of James Clements, village schoolmaster, of Haddenham, Buckinghamshire. On his father's side he came from a long line of church musicians: his grandfather had been a tenor lay clerk at St George's, Windsor. He was educated at Bristol grammar school, and in 1927 he took up a flute scholarship at Trinity College of Music, London. He was awarded the college's diploma in 1930, but remained at Trinity until 1933, having more lessons while unsuccessfully attempting a MusB degree of Durham University. In 1933 he was apprenticed to the music reader in the music printing factory of Novellos, and remained there for a year after finishing his apprenticeship in 1936. 
It was at Trinity that Hunt became interested in the recorder, through the director of studies, Joseph Cox Bridge, the former organist at Chester Cathedral who in 1886 had discovered the 'Chester recorders' in the vaults of the cathedral. Hunt first heard recorders played in 1928, at a recital by the German Singers in Bristol, and fell in love with the pure sound of the instrument. He bought a treble recorder made by Oskar Dawson, and after teaching himself to play from 'The Modern Music Master' (1731) he visited the Haslemere festival for the first time in 1930. Wanting to teach schoolchildren the recorder (he already taught the flute and the clarinet), but finding there was no recorder tutor available in England, he wrote his own, 'A Concise Tutor for Descant, Treble and Tenor Recorders for Use in Schools' and 'A Practical Method for the Recorder' (both 1935). There were no inexpensive recorders available either, unlike the situation in Germany, where recorders had been mass-produced since the early 1930s. But Hunt discovered that these recorders had a simplified fingering system, which meant that they had a limited range, poor sound quality, and were out of tune in most keys. In 1934 he persuaded one German maker, Wilhelm Herwig, to produce recorders with what he called 'English fingering', based on eighteenth-century fingering. He passed the Herwig agency on to a Liverpool firm, and recorder playing began to be introduced into elementary schools. Hunt was supported in this by Cyril Winn, chief inspector of schools. With his ensemble, Old Music with Old Instruments, he gave concerts in schools around the country so that the children could see and hear the instruments. But although he wanted every child to play the recorder, he fought all his life against the notion that the recorder was just something to play before moving on to a 'real' instrument. 
Already teaching flute at Trinity, Hunt started recorder evening classes in 1935, and it was thanks to him that in 1937 Trinity started setting external recorder examinations, the first examination board to do so. In 1938 he was responsible for Trinity establishing the school of old music at Old Devonshire House, Bloomsbury; this was the first early music department in a music college in Europe. It closed at the outbreak of the Second World War, but was revived in 1947 as the department of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century music, with Hunt as head -- he taught recorder, baroque flute, and viola da gamba -- and Trinity became the first music conservatory in the world to award recorder diplomas. 
In 1937 Hunt began to work for Schott & Co., the music publisher. He had been publishing recorder music since 1934, and in 1938 Schotts published the first of many collections of music arranged for recorder by him, 'Twelve National Airs' and 'Twelve Christmas Carols'. In 1937, with his friends Max and Stephanie Champion, and with Carl Dolmetsch, he founded the Society of Recorder Players. He started, and from 1937 to 1941 co-edited, 'Recorder News', the journal of the society. In the first months of 1940 he produced 'Edgar Hunt's Recorder News-Letter', and broadcast illustrated talks on the recorder. He was also invited to direct the first summer school for recorder players at Downe House, near Newbury, in 1939; these continued until 1960. On 11 June 1938 he had married Elizabeth Willingham Voss (died 1966), daughter of Edward George Voss, an industrial chemist who worked in the oil industry before becoming a schoolmaster; they had one daughter. Elizabeth Voss had founded the quarterly 'The Amateur Musician' in 1935, for which Hunt started to write soon after it began, starting a 'Home music supplement' in which he published recorder music. 
As the outbreak of the Second World War became imminent, and the supply of cheap wooden recorders from Germany was no longer available, Hunt, in collaboration with Mark Barnes of Barnes and Mullins, began to design plastic recorders. These were manufactured by Schotts throughout the war. From 1941 to 1946 Hunt served in the Royal Artillery in India and was commissioned into the Inter-Services Broadcasting Unit in New Delhi, but after the war he returned to Trinity and to Schotts, where he was in charge of recorder music and recorder marketing, and had a workshop where he tested and repaired Schott recorders. He and Walter Bergmann built up the recorder catalogue and Schotts became the leading publisher of music for the recorder. His many editions included Anthony Holborne's 'Pavans, Galliards, and Almans' (1599) arranged for recorder consort, a complete edition of John Dowland's consort music, and the four Handel recorder sonatas. He spent much time in the British Museum discovering a previously unknown repertoire for the recorder. The Society of Recorder Players was revived in 1946, and Hunt was elected chairman; he retired from this position in 1972. In 1948 he was one of the founders of the Recorder in Education Summer School; he was chairman until 1989, having been a tutor every year since the beginning. From 1962 to 1968 he collaborated with Jean Henry in organizing Anglo-French recorder courses, and from 1975 to 1995 he taught at Jean Henry's Rencontres Internationales de Musique Ancienne et Danses du Cour. He also ran courses on Renaissance music and dance at Missenden Abbey for many years. 
Although he had first become interested in the recorder as a historical instrument, Hunt also encouraged contemporary composers to write for it. His favourite modern solo work for the recorder was Rubbra's 'Meditazioni sopra 'Coeurs desoles'', commissioned by Dolmetsch at Hunt's suggestion for his Wigmore Hall recital in 1949. 
Hunt published 'The Recorder and its Music' in 1952. This became the standard work in English, and was revised and updated in 1977. He also edited the 'Recorder and Music Magazine' from 1974 until 1991, writing extensively for it, and although he was not a harpsichordist, in 1974 he started and until its demise in 1986 edited the 'Harpsichord Magazine' (latterly the 'English Harpsichord Magazine'). He wrote tutors for the bass recorder (1974) and the crumhorn (1975), and in 1977 brought out 'Robert Lucas Pearsall, 'the compleat gentleman', and his Music (1795-1856)', based on a lifetime's research by his father, Hubert Hunt. He was a founding member of the Galpin Society, started in 1946 to further the study of the history of musical instruments. 
Hunt retired from Schotts in 1974, and from Trinity in 1981. Despite his enormous influence on the revival of recorder playing in England he was a modest and unassuming person who preferred to keep out of the limelight, while working quietly behind the scenes. Described by many as the perfect English gentleman, he was good-humoured, tactful, patient, and generous with his time. A dedicated teacher, he wanted to make the recorder and its music available to as many people as possible. He died on 16 March 2006 at Wycombe Hospital, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his daughter, Rosemary. As a tribute Colin Hand wrote 'Quartet in Memoriam Edgar Hunt' (2006); a memorial concert was held on 11 November 2006 at the Old Royal Naval College chapel, Greenwich.

Michael Williams (1785-1858), mining entrepreneur and politician, who was the second son of John Williams (1753-1841) and his first wife, Catherine Harvey (1757-1826). He was born at Burncoose House, Truro, on 3 June 1785 and on 5 March 1813 married Elizabeth Eales (died 1852), daughter of Richard Eales, of Easton House, Devon. Educated at a private school in Devon, he played a pivotal role in consolidating the family's business interests. Initially employed in managing the Williams family's copper mining interests in the parish of Gwennap, near Redruth, in Cornwall, he became the leading partner in Williams, Foster & Co., with business activities in both England and Wales. In 1853 he was widely credited by the region's mining adventurers with saving the Cornish copper industry from total collapse at a time of great economic difficulty. Michael Williams was also active in the wider development of the Cornish economy in the mid-nineteenth century through his chairmanship of the Cornwall Railway Company from 1854 onwards and as a partner in the Cornish Bank, which was principally owned by the family.

Dawes, Jesse Cooper (1878-1955), sanitary inspector, was born at Hall Street, Blakenhall, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, on 21 October 1878, the son of James Cooper Dawes, tinplate worker, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Belcher. He received his early education and his subsequent training in public cleansing in Wolverhampton. He served in Greetland and then York where, on 2 March 1910, he married Alice Gertrude Clarke, a 29-year-old elementary schoolmistress, daughter of Joseph Thomas Pallister Clarke, a civil engineer. In 1911 Dawes was appointed chief sanitary inspector and cleansing superintendent at Keighley, Yorkshire, a position he held for the next ten years. 
Dawes played a central role in Britain's 'refuse revolution' (Luckin) of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In fact he was one of the first to suggest such a phenomenon: 'Public Cleansing has undergone a revolution in recent years and now calls for a high degree of technical skill if it is to be carried out in an efficient, cleanly and economical manner' (Dawes, 'Report of an Investigation'). Before about 1870 refuse collection in Britain was sporadic, and relied principally on 'ad hoc' provision of service by private contractors. As part of the extension of service industries and the revolution in government, management of household and trade waste increasingly became the province of a phalanx of municipal technocrats -- borough engineers, medical officers of health, and cleansing superintendents. In the first instance this shift to professionalization and municipalization of waste was closely allied to the emergent technology of refuse destructors or incinerators. Dawes embarked on his career in public cleansing just as the initial enthusiasm for incinerators began to wane. In Keighley he established a reputation for his work in slum clearance and salvage recovery. During the First World War recovery of materials from domestic and trade waste became increasingly important, and Dawes travelled throughout Britain, encouraging local authorities to salvage. In 1916 he was seconded to the Department of Supply as assistant director of national salvage and in 1918 he assumed the post of chief technical adviser to the National Salvage Council, which was chaired by the secretary of state for war, Lord Derby. His services to the nation were acknowledged when he was appointed OBE at the end of the war. 
On the formation of the Ministry of Health in 1919 Dawes was appointed the department's inspector of public cleansing and salvage. His subsequent election as president of the Institute of Cleansing Superintendents (established in 1898) in 1924 (and subsequently in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1945, and 1946) confirmed his pre-eminent position in waste management. In 1923 he was also elected a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. As the Ministry of Health's inspector of public cleansing and salvage he advised local authorities and presided over public inquiries related to local authority applications for loans for purchase of land, vehicles, plant, and buildings in aid of public cleansing. 
In Keighley Dawes had embraced 'controlled tipping' (called 'sanitary landfill' in the USA), which had been introduced in 1915 by Ernest Call, Bradford's cleansing officer, as an alternative to refuse incineration. In 1922 Dawes introduced the Ministry of Health's 'tipping precautions', a code of practice that provided public support for controlled tipping. He thereby played a pivotal role in the early institutionalization of controlled tipping within British waste management regimes. He further rationalized waste management practices through the introduction of a costing system for local authorities in 1926. A year earlier, in 1925, a deputation from London county council had requested the Ministry of Health to investigate public cleansing in London. This resulted in Dawes's exhaustive exploration of the subject, and culminated in his influential 'Report of an Investigation into the Public Cleansing Service in the Administrative County of London' (1929). Popularly known as the Dawes report, it articulated the guiding principles of Dawes's approach for the remainder of his career, and left a lasting legacy in British waste management for the rest of the twentieth century. He contended that public cleansing must be sanitary and economically efficient. He decried indiscriminate burning and dumping of refuse, and promoted centralization of services that encompassed separation, pulverization, and controlled tipping. He acknowledged that suburban growth both compounded and highlighted the deficiencies of refuse dumps surrounding urban areas like London. In this respect he reserved special condemnation for South Hornchurch, 'the worst refuse dump in Britain and by far the biggest' (Dawes, 'Report', 30). Moreover, he depicted dumps such as this as constituting a 'disfiguring and damaging environment' (ibid.). 
As chairman of the International Association for Public Cleansing from 1928 to 1935 and president of the first International Conference on Public Cleansing, held in London in 1931, Dawes reiterated the importance of public cleansing in terms of hygiene, amenity, and cost. In the four years before 1930 he had attended three conferences and exhibitions of German public cleansing services, and he concluded: 'taking England as a whole it is, probably, better cleaned than any other European country and... the work is being done at a much lower average cost than elsewhere' (TNA: PRO, HLG 51/3). Furthermore, he actively promoted the international conference as a potential showcase for British refuse collection vehicles. This was indicative of his broad commitment to all facets of effective public cleansing. As chairman of the British Standards Committee he sought to define the specifications for the most effective dustbin, with a smooth interior, tight-fitting lid, and an absence of corners. The international scope of his interests was confirmed by his acceptance of an invitation by the Maltese government to advise them on their public cleansing in 1936. 
Dawes became president of the Sanitary Inspectors' Association (forerunner of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health) in 1938 and retained this position until 1952. He was the first local government officer from the sanitary and cleansing services to hold the presidency. With the declaration of war in 1939 he was seconded to the directorate of salvage and recovery within the Ministry of Supply, as deputy director and then director, to build on his work for the National Salvage Council in the First World War. Among other things the National Salvage Council had introduced 'modern refuse disposal plants'. These were incinerator plants that were modified to include separation and salvage. Under Dawes's guidance Britain had continued to pursue salvage during the inter-war years, and in 1940 he declared that the nation had derived more salvage from domestic waste since the First World War than all other continental European countries combined. Nevertheless, he argued that too often valuable raw materials continued to be discarded: in 1939 he spearheaded the distribution of a 'salvage circular' to 2000 local authorities, imploring them to modify collection of refuse to retrieve such recyclable goods as paper, metal, rags, and foodstuffs. Dawes's contribution to the promotion of wartime salvage helped to achieve the reuse and recycling of 7,500,000 tons of materials between 1939 and 1946. His wartime contribution was acknowledged when he was appointed CBE in 1947. 
Dawes transferred to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1948, and remained there in a part-time capacity until his retirement in 1951. Through his various prominent roles, his considerable number of publications, and his addresses he garnered enormous respect in the field of waste management. A contemporary recalled: 'Everyone trusted Dawes, he was reliable, his advice was sound, he had no axe to grind, he was there to help and he knew just when and how that help could be applied. We all had such faith in him, no wonder he could hold a Conference spellbound when he addressed it. (H. A., 'Public Cleansing and Salvage', 404-5)' His international reputation was equally impressive: in 1949 he became technical consultant to the World Health Organization in matters of refuse collection and disposal, and undertook an investigation of provisions in the USA. He toured European countries in 1951 in his capacity as honorary chairman of the OEEC's technical assistance mission; and in the same year he provided a survey and report on refuse disposal services in the city of Trieste. 
Dawes found time in the years following his retirement to pursue his interests in football, bowls, and gardening. While pruning a tree, he fell and broke his ankle. He never fully recovered from the shock of this injury, and died from pneumonia in Edgware General Hospital, Hendon, London, on 10 June 1955. Perhaps ironically, Dawes, the great proponent of controlled tipping, was cremated. A memorial service was held at Harrow on 14 June 1955. The Chartered Institution of Wastes Management continues to acknowledge his legacy through the annual award of a travelling scholarship in his name.

Jones, Arthur Stuart Duncan- (1879-1955), dean of Chichester, was born Arthur Stuart Jones at Mayfield, Oldham Above Town, Lancashire, on 25 April 1879, the son of Duncan Llewellyn Davies Jones, curate at St James's Church, Oldham, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Griffith. The family left Oldham in 1881 for Lincolnshire, where his father held the curacy of Willoughby, before ill health led to retirement to Somerset and an early death in 1887, aged thirty-four. 
Duncan-Jones (it is not clear exactly when he adopted a hyphenated surname) was educated at Pocklington School in Yorkshire and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he held a Hebrew scholarship and read oriental languages. After graduating in 1901 he was ordained deacon in 1904 and appointed chaplain and lecturer at Caius; and once priested (1905) he became a fellow and junior dean at Caius the following year. On 15 August 1907 he married Caroline Mary Stewart Roberts ('b'. 1887), daughter of the master of Caius, Ernest Stewart Roberts. In 1910 he was appointed dean of Caius, and examining chaplain to the bishop of Lincoln. The following year he was invited to be select preacher to the university (an office he also held in 1928 and 1932) and in 1912 became rector of Blofield, Norfolk, before moving in 1915 to Louth in Lincolnshire, also as rector. But his particular contribution to the Anglican church at large was already emergent: in 1913 he had initiated a summer school of church music at Oxford devoted to raising the musical standard of worship in parish churches, and when in 1916 a successor was sought to Percy Dearmer at St Mary the Virgin, Primrose Hill, Duncan-Jones was an obvious candidate, and was to stay there, other than a brief period (1928-9) at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, until his preferment to the deanery at Chichester. 
The new incumbent at Primrose Hill soon saw that his role was primarily that of maintaining a practice set by Dearmer, in which the beauty of the interior of the church and of its liturgy attracted worshippers from far afield. This challenge engaged him in much pastoral activity, but he found considerable energy for other ventures too. His Hulsean lectures at Cambridge were published as 'Ordered Liberty, or, An Englishman's Belief in his Church' (1917); from 1916 he was secretary, later chairman, of the publications committee of the Alcuin Club (a society committed to the enrichment of worship through study of the 'Book of Common Prayer'); and he wrote 'Church Music' (1920), in which he explored his certainty that music in worship was a servant of the liturgy rather than an opportunity for 'a choir effect'. In 1921 he was secretary of a meeting at Central Hall, Westminster, to appeal to all Christians for a new spirit in approaching the Irish question. He was a leader writer and assistant editor of the 'Guardian: the Church Newspaper' (1923-38), and the author of 'Archbishop Laud' (1927). 
Aspects of each of these ventures -- crucially, Englishness, liturgical innovation, and the application of Christian principles to political and social questions -- were to form the central thrust of Duncan-Jones's ministry at Chichester, where he became dean in 1929. Chichester (the city and the cathedral) soon discovered a new presence in its midst: within weeks clergy ministering in the sanctuary at services were replaced by young male servers; partygoers at the Sussex Folk Dance Club in the Corn Exchange discovered the new dean dancing among them; and for Whitsuntide 1930, the first red-letter celebration he was able to plan 'ab initio', a festival of music and dance was held to raise funds for repairs to the fabric at the cathedral. Gustav Holst contributed to the music, and 240 singers and dancers demonstrated within and without the cathedral the 'beauty of the universe in terms of sound [and movement], the glory of God [being] too great to be expressed in words', as Duncan-Jones wrote ('Sussex Daily News', 28 Oct 1930). The festival was widely acclaimed and the cathedral began to be known as a 'people's cathedral'. 
Duncan-Jones's vigour and innovation extended in many directions: to lecturing in America; to leading the first compline broadcast by the BBC (on 30 March 1930), with reference in the service to the Chichester poet William Collins; to establishing regular services specifically for children, and for holidaymakers; to sending financial succour to unemployed miners in co. Durham; to leading the first ever watch night service; to promoting the value of the League of Nations, working as chairman of its Christian organizations committee and preaching in Geneva at the nineteenth assembly of the league; to appointing himself headmaster of, and revitalizing, the prebendal school, essentially the choir school of the cathedral; to promoting the first-known showing of a film in a cathedral (scenes of life in the Holy Land); to commissioning a pageant, 'The Acts of St Richard', performed twice in his lifetime (1933 and 1953); and, after the war, to leading the annual service of remembrance at the Albert Hall and gathering together his liturgical practice in the 'Chichester Customary' (1948), a volume that had an impact on worship in cathedrals across the country 'much in the way that Dearmer's 'Parson's Handbook' had done in parishes almost fifty years beforehand' (Foster, 60). 
If the 'Customary' is Duncan-Jones's most enduring literary legacy, he is also remembered in a stone let into the floor of the retro-quire, adjacent to the altar of St Richard that he did so much to promote. The inscription reads 'Lucerna ardens et lucens' ('A burning and shining light'; 'St John' 5:35); and it was a tongue of fire from that light that had led him to fly to Berlin in July 1933 to meet Hitler to determine his intentions. Later, in an essay under the title 'The crooked cross' in 'England Speaks' (1941), he denounced all aspects of Nazism, alongside writers as established as C. E. M. Joad, Harold Laski, A. A. Milne, and E. M. Forster, as he had in the earlier 'The Struggle for Religious Freedom in Germany' (1938). This same Christian patriotism had determined in the early 1930s that a table of fifteen portrait corbels should complete the restoration of the cathedral's fourteenth-century great south transept window. The subjects for the portraits were national (Baldwin and Ramsay Macdonald) and local (the bishop, George Bell, and the cathedral canons, and also the architect, the builder, and the foreman in charge on site). In acknowledgement of this recognition of professional skill and trade craft, the man who carved the portraits 'in situ' started his work with two portraits in the centre -- George V and, at his right hand, Duncan-Jones himself. 
After suffering a heart attack on 12 January 1955 Duncan-Jones was taken to the Royal West Sussex Hospital, where he died on 19 January. He was cremated at Downs crematorium, Brighton, on 24 January. At his funeral service, held at Chichester Cathedral on 22 January, Bishop Bell (with whom relationships had always been difficult) gave what the local paper headlined as a 'glowing tribute' ('Chichester Observer', 28 Jan 1955). He was survived by his wife, and by his six sons and two daughters.

Rutling, Thomas (1854-1915), singer, was born in Wilson county, Tennessee, USA, on 24 December 1854, into slavery. His father had either run away or been sold before his birth, and his mother was sold when he was three; the fates of both parents were unknown to him. He and two siblings (an older brother and older sister) moved to a new plantation when their master's daughter married. He began working in the fields when he was eight, but soon became a household servant. In 1865, freed by Union soldiers, he joined his brother and sister in Nashville, where his sister taught him to read and write. After a brief period working for a surgeon he enrolled at the high school at the newly founded Fisk University -- a collection of army huts where white teachers of the American Missionary Association trained hundreds of former slaves. He paid for his tuition by waiting on the teachers' tables. He soon became a leading participant in the Literary Society's weekly debates, which developed his linguistic skills. In 1871 he became (as a tenor) a founding member of the choir that toured far from Tennessee, to promote awareness of the university and to gather funds for it. After a gruelling start, the choir -- soon named the Fisk Jubilee Singers -- attracted widespread interest with their renditions of Negro spiritual songs, and in March 1872 performed for President Ulysses S. Grant at the White House. 
In April 1873 Rutling and the choir reached England. The British counterpart of the American Missionary Association was the Freedmen's Missions Aid Society, which had just elected Lord Shaftesbury as president. He sponsored the choir's first performance and alerted his many associates to the presence in Britain of the Jubilee Singers. Rutling and his ten companions impressed, and they were invited to sing at the home of the duke and duchess of Argyll on 7 May. By chance the queen called; the singers were now a social success. In August 1873 they moved from London to Scotland, sometimes collecting over $100 daily from ticket sales. Patrons included John Burns, co-founder of the Cunard shipping line. At their final London performance in May 1874 the troupe's work was said to have raised over $10,000. 
The Fisk choir returned to England in May 1875, remaining in Europe until June 1878. With the completion of Jubilee Hall at Nashville in 1876, the original motive for the touring ended but they continued, at the risk of health and voices. The tour was hectic; other black choral groups were exploiting the market, and pirate copies of their arrangements were on sale widely. The singers took a summer break in Switzerland, and they gave a concert in Geneva before returning to London. Rutling fell ill, but rejoined the group, which met up with Isaac Dickerson (a former member of the choir) in Edinburgh (where Dickerson had been sponsored to study). In 1877 they started a tour of the Netherlands, appearing before high society and the royal family, and went to Germany, where they again performed for monarchs. Marred by illness, bickering, and the rigours of travelling -- to Switzerland then back to Germany -- the tour ended in Hamburg in June 1878. 
Following the disbandment of the original Jubilee Singers (the bass Frederick Loudin later re-formed the Fisk Jubilee Singers as a purely commercial venture) Rutling took an extended holiday in Switzerland to recover his health before returning to performing and touring in Germany, Italy, and Austria -- where he seems to have fathered a son. He subsequently returned to England, where he had sponsorship from the orchestral director, August Manns. He worked as a voice teacher at various schools in Britain until 1907 when he went back to touring, mostly at nonconformist church halls, where older members were still interested in Fisk University. His autobiography, 'Tom' ('c'.1907), which had music but was a mere sixty-four pages, was published in Bradford and again in Devon (suggesting that it was a private venture for sale after his recitals). Having lived in Harrogate, Yorkshire, since 1905, he died on 26 April 1915 at 97 Valley Drive, Harrogate, of disease and cancer of the liver. Friends in Harrogate paid for his funeral and the plot in Grove Road cemetery, and for the stone cross inscribed 'Late Jubilee Singer, Fisk University' and 'They sing the song of the lamb'. The plot also contains the remains of some of his Harrogate friends. He was remembered with affection, and his impact on wider British society was significant: his singing, his eloquence, and his diplomatic role as a representative of Afro-Americans matched those of his best friend in the Jubilee Singers, Isaac Dickerson, who had died prematurely in London in 1900.

Turnbull, David (1793?-1851), journalist and slavery abolitionist, was 'a native of Scotland' (Turnbull to Lord John Russell, 22 Jan 1841, TNA: PRO, FO 72/584), though his precise origins are uncertain. There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that he was the David Turnbull born at Glasgow on 2 July 1793, son of David Turnbull, grocer, and his wife, Agnes, 'nee' Adam, but this cannot be established for certain. On the title-page of one of his publications he was described as 'M.A.', though it is not known at which university he graduated, his name not appearing in the graduation lists of Glasgow or Edinburgh. He was described as formerly resident in Glasgow before his marriage, on 18 August 1826, at Ballylesson, co. Down, to Elinor (1805?-1843), daughter of Roger Casement, 'a man of great wealth and respectability in the county of Antrim, with whom I was previously connected by the marriage of my sister to his son' (ibid.). His sister Agnes was married to Elinor's brother, Hugh Casement. Following their marriage, David and Elinor moved to London and then to Edinburgh. 
From 1830 Turnbull was a correspondent for 'The Times' covering continental Europe; he lived for periods in Paris (1830 and 1831), The Hague (1831), and Brussels (1831). His known address in Paris confirms him as the author of an eyewitness account, 'The French Revolution of 1830' (1830). In 1832 he was sent to Madrid, where he stayed for about two years. He supported the efforts of the British minister in Madrid, George William Frederick Villiers, to end the illegal slave trade in the Spanish colonies. This culminated in a treaty with Spain in 1835, reinforcing an earlier treaty of 1817 that had outlawed the slave traffic in the Spanish dominions with effect from 1820. 
In late 1834 Turnbull returned to Paris, where he remained until 1837, when he resigned his position at 'The Times' and moved temporarily to Britain, residing in London and co. Down. He continued to promote the anti-slavery cause as a member of the English Anti-Slavery Society. Between 1838 and 1839 he visited Demerara, Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica, Port au Prince, and Cuba. His observations were published in 1840 as 'Travels in the West', dedicated to Villiers. They gave a detailed account of the illegal slave trade in the last two Spanish colonies, Puerto Rico and Cuba, pointing out that 'British capitalists, under the cloak of a foreign partnership, still assist in the trade' ('The Times', 21 Feb 1840). Early in 1840 he took part in an anti-slavery deputation to the king of France, drawing attention to the continuance of slavery in French dependencies. In August 1840 he became a member of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, created to secure the abolition of the slave trade throughout the world. 
Later in August 1840 Turnbull was appointed British consul in Havana, a position he held jointly with that of superintendent of liberated Africans at Havana, under the mixed commission for the suppression of the slave trade created by the treaty of 1817. He 'was the most outspoken abolitionist England ever sent to Cuba' (Corwin, 75). Despite the Anglo-Spanish treaties of 1817 and 1835, the slave trade to Cuba continued extensively, and as a recognized abolitionist Turnbull faced hostility from the Spanish colonial authorities and from British planters and merchants who had moved to Cuba, where they continued to employ slave labour (or benefited from it). On his arrival in Havana in November 1840 he endeavoured to find out the whereabouts of slaves illegally introduced after 1820, later claiming to have obtained the liberty of about 2000 slaves. Furthermore, he demanded the release of all slaves resident in Cuba who had been born in Britain or any of her colonies from 1807. His plan 'to overthrow this colossal grievance [the slave trade]', was founded on the idea of 'making the purchaser and possessor of an African slave insecure in the enjoyment of his unlawful acquisition that he is to be deterred from paying the price' (Turnbull to Palmerston, 13 March 1840, 'Select committee', 62-3). Palmerston resisted Cuban pressure for Turnbull's removal, asserting that Turnbull's opinions 'are shared by the whole British nation' (Palmerston to Flores, 17 Aug 1841, Corwin, 76). Palmerston nevertheless cautioned him to be more tactful in correspondence with the Spanish colonial authorities: 'you write with so much bitterness of feeling; with so much of sneer and irony, that you excite a suspicion that you are actuated by some personal or vindictive motives as much as by a sense of duty... Moreover, you constantly exaggerate things, which require no exaggeration, and thus you defeat your own purpose. (Palmerston to Turnbull, 2 Aug 1841, Curry-Machado, 80)' Turnbull travelled to other Cuban provinces, such as Matanzas, where slaves had been introduced illegally after 1820, to investigate reports that Africans kidnapped in Jamaica were subsequently taken to Cuba. The local colonial authorities at Matanzas disputed his authority, detained him on 13 November 1841, and ordered him to return to Havana. Pressure from Spain, and from British merchants and shipowners, led Lord Aberdeen, Palmerston's successor as foreign secretary, in February 1842, to separate the positions of consul and superintendent of liberated Africans, and to revoke Turnbull's appointment as consul. Aberdeen noted that Turnbull's proceedings at Havana had 'not been regulated by that spirit of moderation and discretion which your instructions enjoin' and that 'the commercial interests of HM subjects in Cuba have suffered' by the combination of the two offices, those trading interests requiring 'the entire and undivided attention of an individual of tact and experience' (Aberdeen to Turnbull, 10 Feb 1842, TNA: PRO, FO 72/608). 
Turnbull's continuing anti-slavery activities as superintendent exposed him to death threats, and he sought refuge on HMS 'Romney', anchored at Havana. After two months confined to the ship his wife fell ill and he requested another posting. He moved in August 1842 to New Providence, Nassau, from where, in October 1842, he embarked on a risky mission to Gibara-Holguin in Cuba, in search of British subjects being kept as slaves in plantations belonging to British farmers. The local authorities were alerted and he was arrested, taken to Havana, and subsequently expelled from Cuba on 6 November 1842. Aberdeen now abolished the office of superintendent of liberated Africans in Cuba. 
Turnbull returned to London and in January 1843 Aberdeen appointed him judge of the court of the mixed commission at Kingston, Jamaica, a post that had been created as a result of a treaty between Britain and Portugal for the suppression of the slave trade signed in July 1842. Kingston's proximity to Cuba raised further Spanish objections, and there were allegations that he was implicated in the Cuban 'escalera' slave uprising in 1844. His involvement was never conclusively proved, and continues to arouse debate. 
Turnbull's first wife died in Jamaica in December 1843, and he married there, on 1 August 1844, Alice, daughter of John Musson. His actions in Jamaica against the slave trade continued to be highly regarded by British abolitionists, and in March 1850 he returned to Britain to give evidence (7 May 1850) to a select committee of the House of Lords on the African slave trade, recounting details of his work. He also published 'The Jamaica Movement for the Promoting of Slave-Trade Treaties' (1850). Palmerston requested him to seek support from French planters and merchants in the fight against the slave trade, and it was on this mission that he died in Paris, at 38 avenue Gabriel, Champs Elysees, on 7 May 1851, following a long illness. The paper he had prepared to be read before the French Academy of Sciences in Paris was subsequently distributed among the academy's members. Palmerston paid tribute to him, referring to his death as 'a great loss to the slave trade suppression cause' (Murray, 219).

King, Sir Alexander Boyne (1888-1973), cinema manager and booking agent, was born on 24 October 1888 at 113 McLean Street, Govan, Glasgow, the only son of James L. King, clerk, and his wife, Jane, 'nee' Boyne. He was educated at Rutland Crescent School, Glasgow. His father died when King was just twelve years old. With his mother to provide for, he started working at a bakers in the morning and as a programme seller at the Royal Princess's Theatre in the evenings while still attending school in between. A story that as a programme seller he collected discarded programmes at the end of each performance and took them home, where his mother ironed them so that he could resell them the next evening, turned out to be a myth stemming from a tale told by his friend the music hall star Harry Lauder. In later life he recalled that his greatest thrill was when he handed his first wages to his mother. 
On leaving school King worked at the Clyde Navigation Trust, while still at the Princess in the evenings. Rich Waldon built the Palace Theatre next door and appointed King as head programme boy. He then found evening work at the Grand Theatre in Cowcaddens, as ticket tearer and cashier. His enthusiasm and hard work led to swift promotion to assistant manager. Experience at the Grand led him, together with some friends, to invest in the Lorne Cinema in 1914. He booked films with big names like Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd, which drew crowds and established the Lorne as 'one of the best of Glasgow's numerous cinema entertainments', according to the 'Glasgow Observer' in 1915 (Peter, 89). By 1920 his cinemas were known as the King Circuit (with King on the board of some and booking films for all of them), and he was a member of the Scottish branch of the Cinematographer Exhibitors' Association; by 1924 he was elected as Scottish delegate to the association's national council. On 24 April 1919 at Burlington House, Glasgow, he had married Helen Craig (1892/3-1965), daughter of John Craig, shipping clerk, of Glasgow. They had two daughters, Eleanore and Xandra. 
In 1928 Caledon Pictures Ltd became the new owners of the Lorne Cinema and King became a director. By this point he was responsible as booking manager for many of Glasgow's independent cinemas. He took over the Lyceum in Govan, where twelve years earlier he had been turned away when scouting for work. There his entrepreneurial skills became evident when screenings of 'The Man in Mexico' were attended by usherettes and ushers donned in ponchos and sombreros, much to the delight of audiences. Soon King became booking manager for the Inverness-based Caledonian Associated Cinemas, helping to expand the business from nine cinemas in the north-east in 1935 to forty-nine throughout Scotland by 1950, by when it was a rival to the ABC franchise. 
King's light, cheery manner endeared him to film artists on both sides of the Atlantic, making him an ideal publicist for many Scottish events. Accordingly he was made chairman of the special attractions committee for the Empire Exhibition at Bellahouston in 1938. He was responsible for publicity and managed to entice the likes of Gracie Fields, Anna Neagle, Eddie Cantor, and Charles Laughton. He later recounted his difficulty in introducing Gracie Fields to a crowd of 80,000 people. After he made several attempts at an introduction, Fields shouted out, 'Come on baldy, speak up!' (House, 3). 
In 1937 King was appointed CBE. As film officer for Scotland he directed the Scottish evacuation film scheme for the Department of Health in Scotland at the outbreak of the Second World War, which provided cinema entertainment for evacuees. He later took up the post of chairman of the Scottish advisory committee of the Ministry of Information, in which he proved his skills in international relations, providing hospitality for overseas troops visiting Scotland. He was knighted in 1944 in recognition of his wartime activities with the Ministry of Information and his great works of charity in support of the war effort. He received this accolade in an air raid shelter under Buckingham Palace. 
By the mid-1940s King was booking for about ninety cinemas throughout Scotland. A strong believer in worthy causes, by 1954 he had raised over $100,000 for Scottish charities. He relentlessly and tirelessly campaigned for a reduction in the entertainment tax imposed on cinema exhibitors, outraged at the unfair rates, then set at seven times those on theatres and music halls. His aim was for cinemas to pay the same amount as theatres, and he had already succeeded in a reduction in tax on seats costing up to 6died by the mid-1930s, which helped smaller independent exhibitors. When he became annual president of the Cinematographer Exhibitors' Association in 1949 he championed the cause of the British Film Producers Association, winning the support of producers as well as exhibitors and renters. He also served as chairman of the Films of Scotland Committee, which had existed briefly from 1938 until the Second World War broke out, then was revived in 1954, lasting until 1982. This was an important body in which, as chairman, King encouraged the promotion of Scottish life and culture through film, helping producers to get their films made and even helping Walt Disney when he made a film about Scotland for his 'People and Places' series. He assisted the producers of 'The Lilt and the Kilt', the first cinemascope film on Scotland, and helped to have a film made about Burns country. As a leading independent distributor he ensured that Scottish films would have access to distribution. 
In the 1950s King was made vice-chairman and treasurer of the Scottish Tourist Board, where he supervised the worldwide distribution of documentary films about Scotland. In 1960 he also became chairman of Grampian Television for eight years. He received an honorary doctorate in law from Glasgow University in 1957, as well as an honorary fellowship from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. His lifetime ventures and achievements were all conducted with an enthusiasm and humour that never waned. He was a great supporter of Scottish causes, although, as reported in the 'Kinematograph Weekly' in 1949, 'I've never in my life owned a kilt' ('Kinematograph Weekly', 15 Dec 1949). He died on 12 February 1973 at 309 Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, following a heart attack, and was survived by his two daughters.

Gibson, Sir Herbert, first baronet (1863-1934), landowner and livestock breeder in Argentina, was born at Henderson Place, Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, on 8 July 1863, the fourth son among the nine children of Thomas Gibson (1816-1903) and his wife, Clementina, 'nee' Corbett (1829-1886). The family had been prominent landowners in Argentina since 1819, with an emphasis on pedigree sheep ranching. After schooling at the county school in Elmham, Norfolk, he embarked on the career path prescribed by his father, starting in 1882 as a managerial apprentice on one of the family's Argentinian ranches ('estancias'), Los Yngleses, Ajo, Buenos Aires; the ranch was part of a larger landed business empire incorporated in 1891 into Gibson Brothers (Buenos Aires). Unusually for a British expatriate he became an Argentinian citizen in April 1888, allowing him to serve as president of the school council of the town of Ajo and, later, as its mayor. 
The Gibsons were pioneer breeders of Lincoln sheep in Argentina, demonstrating the breed's suitability to the climate and the export market. Within five years Herbert Gibson became a manager and expert breeder in his own right; under his direction the firm's Linconia stud farm became further renowned for its prize breeding stock. His mastery and passion for the subject was shown in his well-received book 'The History and Present State of the Sheep-Breeding Industry in the Argentine Republic' (1893). He married in Edinburgh, on 6 July 1895, Madeleine Jessie (1869-1953), widow of George Leonard Paice and daughter of William James Savell, an Anglican clergyman and headmaster of Holborn grammar school, St Clement Danes, London. They had four sons and later, in 1921, adopted a seven-year-old Scottish orphan girl in Buenos Aires. 
Gibson's opinion on agro-pastoral matters in Argentina was highly valued, and he published investigative studies in Spanish on topics ranging from dairy farming to ear-marking sheep. An often cited piece was his history of Argentinian husbandry written for the national agricultural census of 1908. He was heavily involved in the Argentinian Rural Society (Sociedad Rural Argentina), the pre-eminent landowners' organization in the country, and became the society's vice-president. His request in 1903 that the Royal Agricultural Society should nominate a judge to adjudicate British cattle breeds at the annual national show in Argentina cemented a transatlantic relationship between Argentinian and British pedigree breeders. 
Gibson's contributions to British periodicals helped to popularize Argentina's economic achievements and potential. In Argentina he urged the merits of free trade while excoriating protectionist policies. Recognizing Argentina's natural resources he pointed to the comparative advantage of utilizing its abundant, fertile land to fuel economic growth. A fervent believer in the complementary nature of Argentina's and Britain's economies, he was resolute in his belief that Argentina, through 'thrift', immigration, and the passage of time, would become a heavily populated, non-export-oriented economy. In 'The Land We Live On' (1914) he dismissed land taxes and mortgage assistance as means to encourage wider landownership, instead placing a laissez-faire trust in Argentina's eventual abandonment of extensive ranching for family-owned farming. 
Gibson was a foremost advocate of British community cohesion in Argentina, remaining active in the Scotch Church and St Andrew's Society of the River Plate. As president of the British Literary Society in Buenos Aires he led the organization of the British-Argentine Exhibition of 1905, which extolled British contributions to the nation's development. He was among those who pressed for the establishment of a British chamber of commerce, which came to fruition in 1914; his brother Hope was the chamber's first chairman and he himself held the position from 1927. He also had a particular interest in the anthropology of South American indigenous peoples. 
Gibson's family divided their time between residences in Britain and Argentina, with Gibson regularly travelling between the two. In 1915, during the First World War, he was readmitted to British citizenship. He made efforts to be close to his eldest son, an army officer twice wounded on the western front, and joined the Church Army in 1917 to oversee its frontline 'huts', offering recreational facilities for the troops. As a recognized expert on agriculture he served as Britain's wheat commissioner to Argentina and Uruguay to secure supplies for the allies. With a $40 million credit, he oversaw the purchase of a third of Argentina's wheat between the harvests of 1917-18 and 1919-20. For this activity he was made KBE in 1920. 
Agricultural depression in Argentina during the 1920s seriously curtailed the family's cash flow, and Gibson took on local directorships of British companies, becoming chairman of the Buenos Ayres Great Southern Railway in 1931. During the visit to Argentina in 1925 of the prince of Wales he arranged the itinerary in the provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios. He spent two years organizing the British Empire Trade Exhibition in Buenos Aires in March 1931, an attempt to augment flagging British exports and underscore the Anglo-Argentine bilateral trade campaign, whose slogan was 'Buy from those who buy from us'. Opened by the prince of Wales, the exhibition drew over one and a half million visitors; its success resulted in a baronetcy being conferred on Gibson in June 1931. Reflecting his dual loyalties, he chose to be described as 'of Faccombe and Linconia', the former representing his British home in Hampshire, the second his stud farm in Argentina. He wrote of 'the true and lasting bond that unites the two peoples: their common love for the field and the fresh air, the lust for the open spaces of the land' ('The Times', 10 March 1931). After suffering from prostate cancer he died at his Buenos Aires flat, 296 Calle San Martin, on 28 December 1934. Large numbers of Argentinians as well as members of the British community attended his funeral at Chacarita cemetery, Buenos Aires.

Barnham, Alice (1523-1604), silkwoman and benefactor, was born on 7 September 1523 at Chichester, Sussex, one of the youngest of the fourteen children of William Bradbridge (died 1546), a successful and prosperous mercer, and his wife, Alice. Alice Barnham is now known for commissioning one of the earliest family portraits in England, dated 1557, in which she appears alongside her two eldest sons. In addition to the portrait, which provides the sole evidence for Alice's date of birth, further information on her life derives from parishs registers, the records of the Drapers' Company, the court of aldermen, and the court of exchequer, and from a memoir, 'The character of Sir Martin Barnham, knight', written by her grandson, Sir Francis Barnham, for which she served as a source. Alice's father, who was three times mayor of Chichester, raised his children in a tradition of civic prominence and public service -- qualities that would serve Alice well in adult life. Two of her elder brothers achieved prominence in the church: Augustine became chancellor (1560-62) and treasurer (1562-7) of Chichester Cathedral, while William Bradbridge succeeded Augustine as chancellor in 1562 and was elected bishop of Exeter in 1571. 
Alice probably married in 1546 or 1547, with the ceremony most likely taking place in her home parish in Chichester. Her husband was 
Francis Barnham was the son of Steven Barnham, who described himself as a yeoman in his will (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/34, fols. 2-3, proved October 1550). According to Francis's grandson, Steven had been a groom of the privy chamber of Henry VIII but the value of the family's estate had depreciated after his second marriage, which was said to be 'merely for love' (Barnham, 264). Francis was first placed in the royal household but, finding this 'a slow way of preferment' (ibid.), soon left to begin an apprenticeship as a draper, which he completed in November 1541. He was an exporter primarily and developed 'a very extraordinary reputation in those foreign parts where he traded' (ibid.). On 9 July 1550 he was admitted to the Drapers' livery, and in 1554 was made company renter (charged with collecting rents on the Drapers' extensive holdings); thereafter he was elected first warden of the Drapers in 1566-7, and in 1569-70 and 1571-2 served as master. For the company Barnham secured the administration of almshouses founded in Kent by the antiquary and lawyer William Lambarde. He was also a merchant adventurer and, having helped finance the failed search for a north-east passage to China, which succeeded in opening new markets in Muscovy, became a charter member of the Russia Company in 1555. 
Barnham's civic career began with a churchwardenship at St Mildred Poultry between 1554 and 1556. By 1558 he was a common councillor (and was active in the project to build the Royal Exchange, contributing $5 in 1566). In 1559-61 and 1572-4 he was governor of the Bridewell (having supported its creation as a workhouse) as well as governor of St Thomas's Hospital (1564-70 and 1574-6, serving as treasurer in 1567-9), alderman of the large and unruly ward of Farringdon Without the Walls from 1568 (switching to Tower ward in 1573), and sheriff of London in 1570-71. Only death prevented his election as lord mayor. For the crown he collected fifteenths in 1558; in 1569 Elizabeth I advised her lieutenants-general that 'one Barnham' would bring $1500 to provision troops confronting the northern rebellion. These may have been his own funds. Although he seems to have emerged unscathed from a charge of violating the statute against usury in 1574, it is clear that he -- like so many merchants -- had a long career as a moneylender. He lent $50 to Philip and Mary in 1558, was owed more than $1400 by Elizabeth in late 1571, and -- as was alleged in 'R. v. Barnham' -- lent $600 to Sir Walter Waller in 1573. 
As a merchant Francis Barnham was prohibited from keeping a shop, and the retail branch of the family's business was evidently headed by his wife. Alice Barnham sold fancy fringes and points to the Drapers' Company in the early 1560s, and seems to have had the status of a professional silkwoman. Silkwork was a popular career for the wives of leading citizens who, like all freemen's wives, were authorized to operate as 'femmes soles', in which capacity Alice was able to bind her own apprentices, keep her own shop, and was responsible for her own debts. Her stock probably serviced Francis's attempts to disguise large loans as sales of merchandise; she was, for example, directly implicated in the usury charge of 1574. After her husband's death two years later two of his apprentices worked out their terms with her. By not remarrying she protected her freedom of the city and bound at least three more apprentices in her own name, freeing the last when she was in her late seventies. The female monopoly on the silk trade ended about 1570 (according to the Barnhams' contemporary, the historian and topographer William Harrison), making Alice one of the last of the London silkwomen. In 1583 she matched her youngest son, Benedict, with Dorothy Smith (died 1639), the daughter of the queen's silkman. 
In addition to the wealth of material available on her business career, Alice Barnham is the principal subject of one of the earliest known English family group portraits, formerly identified as 'Lady Ingram and her Two Boys Martin and Steven' but now titled 'Alice Barnham and her Sons Martin and Steven' (1557). The misattribution of Barnham as Lady Ingram derives from a paper tag that was probably tacked to the back of the panel in the 1660s, when members of the Ingram and Barnham families intermarried. However, two original 'trompe l'oeil' inscriptions on the painting -- 'Martin was born the 26 of March at 9 of the clock before noon in Anno Domini 1548' and 'Steven was born the 21 of July on a Sunday at night and 10 of the clock Anno Domini 1549' -- identify Alice and Francis Barnham's eldest sons, who were baptized at St Mildred Poultry, London, on 27 March 1548 and 27 July 1549 respectively. A third inscription above the head of the female sitter -- 'I was born the 7 of September on a Sunday 1523, turned from that I was unto that ye see Anno Domini 1557' -- establishes Alice Barnham as the person responsible for commissioning the painting. Until 1998 the portrait hung at Boughton Monchelsea Place, a Kent country house inherited by Sir Francis Barnham in 1613. It was then purchased for the William and Bernadette Berger collection and is now exhibited at the Denver Art Museum, Colorado. 
In the portrait Alice's writing box rests on a table cover ornamented with silk ribbons. Like the blackwork lace and trimmings of her costume and those of her sons, these probably represent her own wares. On her left Martin is portrayed holding a popular protestant text, Thomas Sternhold's metrical translation, 'The Proverbs of Solomon' (1549), which is open to the verse 'My son receive ye these my words, the which shall be right wise'. Alice poses as if having just written in response, 'That we all may receive the same'. Sir Francis (himself a moderate puritan) described his grandmother as 'a constant professor of the true religion' during 'those times of persecution' (Barnham, 265). Between 1553 and 1555 she is known to have taken her children to hear John Bradford preach from prison before his martyrdom. 
The painting has been connected on stylistic grounds with Hans Eworth, a Flemish expatriate who kept a studio in Southwark from about 1549. Though it lacks his distinctive HE signature, it has strong affinities with his portrait of Mary Neville, Lady Dacre, of the late 1550s; she is similarly shown in three-quarter view and with quill in hand. Equally the family portrait may have been painted in the Low Countries, if Alice joined her exiled brother William there in 1557. She could have sent the panel back to Francis, who continued to maintain a high civic profile during the Marian years, as evidence of her good stewardship of their sons' health and religious education. The turn of her inscription, 'from that I was unto that ye see', may allude to the spiritual crisis of those years, to the probable death in infancy of her third son, or simply to the years she had lived since her birth (at this date surpassing the age of Jesus at the time of his death). 
Francis Barnham died in 1576 aged sixty and was buried on 23 May at the parish church of St Clement Eastcheap. The tomb Alice Barnham commissioned for her husband, on the north side of the choir, was destroyed in the great fire of 1666. In 1592 she placed a brass plaque in Chichester Cathedral that is dedicated to her natal family and reads (in part): 'This stone was finished at the charges of the Worshipful Mistress Alice Barnham, widow.' In her widowhood Alice was courted by the grocer Sir Thomas Ramsey, who served as sheriff in 1567 and as lord mayor a decade later. Discovering that Alice had rented jointure properties to her son Martin at below-market rate (so that Martin received the 'benefit' of their incomes), Ramsey insisted that she reclaim her leases before finalizing the marriage. 'Nay', replied Alice (in the words of her grandson): 'be not so hasty, except it be to appoint your wedding day with some other wife, for on me I assure you, you must not reckon. For I shall never think my self happily bestowed upon a husband that setteth so small a value on me as you have done in making this little improvement of my jointure... a necessary condition of your match with me. But it hath fallen out well and given me two satisfactions, the one of your nature, which is surely so set upon covetousness as would have given me but small comfort in you; the other, that of my son's duty and good affection to me, which made him comply with my desires though to his own prejudice. (Barnham, 269)' Refusing Sir Thomas, she restored the leases to Martin. 
Alice Barnham died in 1604 and was buried on 14 May. Of her four sons she was survived by Martin, who became high sheriff of Kent in 1598, was knighted in 1603, and died in 1610, and Steven, who became MP for Chichester and died in 1608. A third child, Anthony, probably died soon after his baptism on 18 March 1558, while Benedict Barnham, who died in 1598, amassed one of the great city fortunes of the period and was a benefactor of St Alban Hall, Oxford. In his will Benedict had described Alice as 'a most rare and loving mother and a good and just woman' (Orlin, 57). The Barnhams' grandchildren, Alice (1592-1650) and Elizabeth (1592-1622x4), both daughters of Benedict, married Sir Francis Bacon, the philosopher and future lord chancellor, and Mervin Touchet, second earl of Castlehaven, respectively. In her own will Alice left an assortment of charitable bequests, including $5 each to the poorest prisoners at several London gaols, $10 to children at Christ's Hospital, $4 to purchase food for inmates of Bedlam, $20 to impoverished students of divinity at Oxford and Cambridge universities, $120 for young merchants in Chichester, and sums of between $5 and $10 to poor persons in London, Hampshire, and Sussex. Barnham Street in Southwark is named for Francis's bequest to Christ's Hospital, but in his edition of the 'Survay of London' of 1617 Anthony Munday singled out Alice instead, praising her as one of forty-three 'citizens' wives deserving memory for example to posterity'.

Francis Barnham (1515/16-1576), a draper and alderman who made frequent appearances in the London records of the time. In his will (proved in 1546) Alice's father specified a marriage portion of $10, while Alice's grandson recalled that the new couple had a joint total worth of $1000 (Barnham, 265). At the time of Francis Barnham's death in 1576 the couple were realizing rental incomes of $1000 annually from properties purchased in London, Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, Essex, Dorset, and Wales, and they had a 'great personal estate' of moveable goods (ibid.). The family's house on St Clement's Lane, Eastcheap, once the London residence of the abbot of Stratford Langthorne, featured a stone gate and its own garden. Improvements made in 1568, including a modish projecting window, prompted neighbours to complain (with little success) to the city's aldermen. In Tudor terms theirs were 'new' lives; Francis was granted a coat of arms in 1561 and the two oldest Barnham sons achieved country gentility.

Bell, Clara (1834-1927), translator, was born on 29 January 1834 in Westminster, the eldest of the four children of the architect Ambrose Poynter (1796-1886) and his wife, Emma, 'nee' Forster (1800-1848). Her mother was the granddaughter of the sculptor Thomas Banks, who had initiated the family's strong links with the arts and the continent. He himself worked in Italy for seven years; Clara's father trained in Italy and Greece, worked in France in 1830-32, and in 1836 was again in Paris, where his son Edward, later Sir Edward Poynter, the painter, was born. From an early age Clara mixed with artists and non-Anglophones, at first friends of her parents, later also those of her brother, who in 1856-9 studied with the painter Charles Gleyre in Paris. 
On 24 April 1856 Clara Poynter married, at St Margaret's, Westminster, Robert Courtenay Bell (1817-1896), son of William Bell, of the East India Company's civil service, Madras. At the time of their marriage he gave his occupation as gentleman; he was later registrar of the National Provincial Bank. One of their close friends was George du Maurier, who had been a fellow student of Edward Poynter's in Paris; he described Clara in 1860 as 'the most exquisite amateur singer I 'ever' heard' and in 1863 as 'the cleverest woman of our acquaintance' (du Maurier, 6, 202). The Bells lived first at 64 Torrington Square in Bloomsbury and from 1861 in Richmond Road, Kew; five sons and two daughters were born between 1857 and 1872. The musicologist J. A. Fuller Maitland described the household as 'a paradise for young people addicted to literature and the arts', since Clara, 'amazingly competent, was an expert translator' and the children 'shared their parents' artistic proclivities' ('Door-Keeper of Music', 86). Through Edward Poynter's marriage to Agnes Macdonald, one of the Macdonald sisters, the family also had connections with Rudyard Kipling and Edward Burne-Jones, who introduced other Pre-Raphaelites; Robert Browning was an occasional visitor. 
In 1876, when her youngest child was four, Clara Bell began her career, translating, with her sister Eleanor, Wilhelmine von Hillern's romance as 'The Vulture Maiden'; it was published by Sampson Low in England and Tauchnitz on the continent. In the following year the same publishers engaged her to translate 'Uarda', a historical romance by the Egyptologist Georg Ebers. The genre proved popular, particularly in America, where she attracted very enthusiastic reviews; she translated a further sixteen similar romances between 1878 and 1892. In 1880 she was recruited to translate Ebers's non-fictional 'Egypt: Descriptive, Historical and Picturesque', which was followed by some sixteen non-fiction books on a variety of subjects (including art, music, travel, and biography) and from a variety of languages (German, French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish). In 1881-4 she collaborated with Fuller Maitland on a translation of Philipp Spitta's three-volume work on J. S. Bach (1883-5). Fuller Maitland later recorded that 'as her knowledge of music was about on a par with my knowledge of German, we could help each other, and the work occupied some three years very happily' ('Door-Keeper of Music', 86). When Count von Moltke died in 1891, she was called in to translate his 'Franco-German War' and 'Letters... to his Mother and his Brothers', while in 1890 she translated Henrik Jaeger's 'Life of Ibsen' (from the German version). From 1882 she had also been translating fiction other than historical romances, including novels by Perez Galdos, Guy de Maupassant, Pierre Loti, and Louis Couperus. In 1895-8 she was engaged to help with the forty-volume 'complete' translation of the 'Comedie humaine' by Honore de Balzac, which was being brought out by J. M. Dent & Sons. The first translator had been Ellen Marriage, who remained 'our mainstay' according to Dent, but Clara Bell proved an 'adequate coadjutor', translating thirteen of the volumes. Like all her translations, these showed some signs of haste; in the same period she was also working on Dutch art books and J. K. Huysmans's 'The Cathedral' (1898). 
In August 1896 Robert Courtenay Bell died; Clara continued translating for another ten years. She died at her home, 86 Ashley Gardens, Westminster, on 16 January 1927 of cardiac and respiratory failure brought on by influenza. Several of her sons pursued distinguished artistic careers. E. Hamilton Bell (1857-1929), who emigrated to America, started as an actor and stage designer and worked with Augustin Daly among others; he eventually became the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Malcolm Bell ('b'. 1859) was an art historian. Charles Francis Bell (1871-1966) became a pioneering curator of the department of fine art in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, writing the standard work on his great-great-grandfather Thomas Banks (1935) among other books. Hugh Poynter Bell (1872-1961), who emigrated to Canada, was the music critic of the 'Montreal Star' from 1923 to 1949, an amateur painter and composer, and a notable patron of the arts in Montreal.

Tappe, Eric Ditmar (1910-1992), Romanian scholar, was born on 8 July 1910 at Homelands, Haringey Park, London, the son of Adolph Robert Tappe, a bank clerk of German extraction, and his wife, Winifred, 'nee' Davis. At the time of his birth registration his parents lived at 47 Queens Road, Finsbury Park. He attended Sir Roger Cholmeley's School at Highgate as a foundation scholar and in 1928 won an open scholarship in classics to Oriel College, Oxford. He was awarded a second in 'literae humaniores' in 1932, following which he was appointed sixth-form classics master at Brighton College. Four years later he moved to a similar post at King Edward VII School in Sheffield. One of his pupils, Harold Guite, later recalled that of ten students in his class, eight won scholarships to Oxford or Cambridge, one to London, and one to Sheffield: 'Without any overt pressure or haste he had us devouring Greek and Latin so fast that we had read some 30 texts before we went to university' ('The Independent', 28 May 1992). 
In October 1940 Tappe was called up and commissioned in the Royal Signals. After service in Northern Ireland he was posted in April 1942 to Oxford to organize the signals unit of the university senior training corps. Seeking a more adventurous role, in March 1944 he answered a call for volunteers to learn Romanian. While following a crash course in the language taught by Grigore Nandris at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, he received orders to undergo parachute training for a drop into Romania, where it was intended that he would link up with the anti-German resistance. King Michael's coup against Marshal Antonescu and Romania's 'volte-face' in August 1944 pre-empted this mission and he was assigned instead -- after arriving more conventionally by plane in Bucharest -- to the British military mission that was sent that autumn as part of the Allied Control Commission to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement between the allies and Romania. He served with the mission chiefly as a staff officer, but with occasional duties as an interpreter. 
While serving in Romania, from October 1944 to February 1946, Tappe witnessed the imposition of communist rule and the heavy-handed behaviour of the Soviet authorities towards the Romanians, among whom he made several friends. Whenever he could he used his official position to protect them; while off duty he would pin union jacks to Romanian-owned cars to prevent their being commandeered by Soviet officers. One night, as the senior officer on duty at the headquarters of the British mission, he foiled an attempt by Soviet troops to kidnap General Nicolae Radescu, the former Romanian prime minister, who had taken refuge there to escape arrest, by firing warning shots over the heads of the advancing soldiers. 
After his demobilization in 1946 Tappe resumed his position at King Edward VII School, but in April 1948 he was appointed to a lectureship in Romanian language and literature at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies. He remained there until his retirement in 1978. For the first decade his main teaching duties involved giving army officers instruction in elementary Romanian. At the same time he set himself the task of raising the study of Romanian language and literature to the level of other language degrees at London University. In 1954 he devised a syllabus and courses for a BA degree in Romanian, the first of its kind offered at a British university. He taught all aspects of the degree single-handed until 1969, when he was finally given an assistant. He was promoted to a personal chair in Romanian studies in 1974, the first such chair in the English-speaking world. 
Tappe's publications reflected his efforts both to make Romanian literature accessible to the Anglophone public and to provide teaching materials for his students. An anthology entitled 'Romanian Prose and Verse' (1956) was followed by 'Documents Concerning Romanian History, 1427-1621' (1964), meticulously researched and transcribed from British archives. His sensitivity as a translator was reflected in 'Fantastic Tales by Mircea Eliade and Mihai Niculescu' (1969; he corresponded occasionally with Eliade) and 'Sketches and Stories by I. L. Caragiale' (1979). Caragiale was also the subject of a monograph, published in Twayne's 'World Authors Series' in 1974. 
Tappe's distaste for the communist authorities in Romania made him a keen supporter, academically and financially, of emigre Romanian scholarly journals. He never forgot the friends he had made in Romania. Despite being banned from the country until 1962 (when he did return he was placed under permanent surveillance) he maintained discreet links with some of his friends and worked to obtain the release from prison of others who had been jailed. In 1962 he personally paid the bulk of the 'ransom' demanded by the Romanian authorities for the release of a former employee of the British military mission in Bucharest, Maria Golescu, who after thirteen years' imprisonment was allowed to travel to Britain with her aged mother. With further assistance from Tappe both Golescus lived out the rest of their lives in Eastbourne. 
Tappe was among the most influential champions of Romanian studies in the English-speaking world in the latter half of the twentieth century. As a teacher he had a gift for inspiring enthusiasm. He brought a sense of humour to his classes, which matched the sense of the absurd in Romanian literature. Tall and portly, and a man of exceptional kindness and warmth, he was an avuncular figure to his students, with many of whom he maintained close contact after their graduation. As a colleague he was always willing to give advice when asked and was generous with his time. After his retirement many were beneficiaries of his hospitality at his home in Markwick Terrace, St Leonard's, Sussex, among them several of his Romanian friends. His last years were clouded by the onset of Parkinson's disease, and he spent his final months in a nursing home, Queen Mary's Lodge, St Leonard's, where he died, unmarried, on 13 May 1992 of bronchopneumonia. He was cremated at St Leonard's crematorium.

Pallis, Alexander (1850-1935), cotton merchant and translator, was born Alexandros Alexandrou Palles on 15 March 1850 at Piraeus, Greece, the youngest child in the family of three sons and one daughter of Alexandros Anastasiou Pales, later Palles (1808/9-1849/50), magistrate, descended from Epirot landowners, and his wife, Panagiotitsa, 'nee' Kouskouri (1815/16-1908), from Mystras. His elder brothers became respectively governor of the Bank of Greece and aide-de-camp to King George I of Greece. Pallis's maternal aunt Polytimi wrote a successful geography of classical Greece (1854). 
Born after his father's death, Pallis grew up in Athens's Albanian quarter, the Plaka, revering his dour, chain-smoking mother, who was a superb natural storyteller, and learning to prize the unaffected language in which, an eyewitness to Ioannis Kapodistrias's murder, she recalled her refugee childhood. He began a course in literature at the University of Athens in 1869, but after a few weeks was whisked off to Manchester, with a blessing and a $5 note, in order to rescue a small calico business jeopardized by his uncle's death. His canny trading impressed the head of a firm of Chiot cotton importers, Pandias Ralli (Rallis), who offered him a clerkship with excellent prospects, provided he 'married into the family'. 
In the autumn of 1875, Ralli Bros shipped Pallis out to Bombay, posting him directly to an up-country buying agency. His punctiliousness, adaptability, and extraordinary stamina (the average lifespan of his mother, himself, his children, and his grandchildren, excepting one child who died in infancy, was ninety) won him promotion to Bombay branch manager, with his own Malabar Hill bungalow and servants. India's flora and civilization enthralled him, and his zest for travel took him to almost every place of interest in the subcontinent. No great mixer with the English, he held literary court for Greeks, gaining two other Ralli box-wallahs as allies: the poet Eftaliotis, and Pallis's future son-in-law Petros Vlastos (Peter Vlasto). When on furlough in Liverpool, on 30 December 1881, at Toxteth register office, he married Pandias Ralli's daughter, Julia Pandia Ralli (1857-1940), plain, featherbedded, and devoted -- as her husband was not -- to classical music. Her 'long loveless sacrifice to duty' (D. Vlasto) produced five offspring: the ecologist Marietta Pallis (1882-1963), the diplomat and historian Alexander Pallis (1883-1975), Aziza Pallis (1884-1986), who married Peter Vlasto, Andreas Pallis (1888-1977), and Marco Pallis ['see below']. 
In 1894, after a brief sojourn (terminated by Julia) on Corfu, and although 'he still yearned for retirement in his native land' (D. Vlasto), Pallis, promoted Liverpool branch manager, entrenched himself on sporting, philistine Merseyside. He took British citizenship in 1897, four months after the catastrophic Greco-Turkish war. A botanist 'manque', he had purchased, backing onto the 200 acre 'rus in urbe' of Sefton Park, the woodland residence, 20 Aigburth Drive, that he sardonically renamed Tatoi after the Greek royal estate. Its regrettable interior was offset by 'a well-used and elegant library' (D. Vlasto), fine carved furniture, and indiscriminately amassed orientalia (including carpets, weapons, and ceramics). Copying the London Greeks' panache, Pallis affected the pipe and droll stories of the Victorian paterfamilias, joined Liverpool's Reform and Lyceum clubs, and chaired the local branch of the Classical Association. He would rise at seven, walk the three miles to and from the office, work until six, and pursue literary studies after dinner, retiring to bed at one in the morning; on Sundays he would read his family the appointed gospel in his own demotic version, before their attendance at the Greek church. For marital and other jaunts he had two cars, each with a chauffeur: a Sizaire-Berwick, in which even the hairbrush was gold-plated, and a vintage Mercedes, succeeded by a funereal Daimler complete with worry-beads. His annual European round of ex-mistresses was diversified with the Dreyfus trial in 1899 and the Paris Expo in 1900. On his eldest son he settled $60,000, on his two younger sons $50,000 apiece, at majority, thus avoiding death duties. (For her $30,000, unbiddable Marietta had to wait until his decease.) He endowed places at Eton College, where his son Alec had been captain of school, for boys from poor or war-stricken families. His children had as good an English education as money could buy, since he meant them to go 'home' and set the raw Greeks an example of political skills and administrative honesty. 
This late Victorian capitalist and accomplished, if wilful, classical scholar was also a language rebel, a pioneer of the Greek spoken today. The 'language question' -- than which there was, according to Peter Vlasto, 'perhaps no subject more dreary' -- confronted a 'purist' language ('katharevousa'), often stilted, but 'de rigueur' in education and literature, with a 'people's language' ('dimotiki'), purporting to distil folksong and street speech. In 'longhair' (that is progressive) periodicals Pallis campaigned playfully and abrasively for 'dimotiki', as 'the battle of individual culture against collective traditionalism' (P. Vlasto). Simultaneously, in the best traditions of Epirot mercantile benefaction, he funded deserving young writers liberally, the poet Palamas (who wrote the words to the Olympic hymn) in particular. (Pallis himself congratulated the Greek winner of the 1896 Olympic marathon in verse.) His original poems, where not caustic, have a Carrollian charm: he wrote attractively for children. His translations, manifestos for demotic, included a prose 'Merchant of Venice' (1894); a disastrous modernization of Kant; and a British astronomy primer. But his masterpiece was an exhilarating demotic ballad rendering of Homer's 'Iliad' (1904), which Oxford University Press 'bestowed an unusual amount of care' in typesetting on India paper, and reckoned 'as good a piece of printing as has ever been seen' (manager of Liverpool Booksellers to Pallis, 24 April 1912). 
In the autumn of 1901, against wise advice, Pallis serialized his demotic version of the 'New Testament' in the Athenian newspaper 'Akropolis'. The translation was (for his 'Times' obituarist) 'clear and harmonious', but once word got round of its imminent publication Pallis was accused of atheism, burlesquing God's word, and, topically, Panslavism. The 'gospel riots' (5-12 November) in Athens saw university students -- pro-church, anti-monarchist -- incited by their lecturers to a then unfamiliar pattern of action: protest marches, vandalism, stoning the police, a mass meeting (disrupted with eight dead), and armed occupation of the university. A month later the translation was publicly burnt, and banned. 
Pallis was a republican liberal who considered Cromwell the greatest of all Englishmen. In his fine baritone he lobbied for Venizelos, notably at the Queen's Hall, London, in 1916, when he was chaired by Emmeline Pankhurst. He made a dozen visits to Greece, 'free' or 'unfree', a distinction he would have rejected, for he saw Turks, Arvanites (Albanian-Greeks), and Hellenes -- a trinity exemplified in himself -- as brothers and a single nation in danger of Slav ingestion. His last visit was a leisurely secular pilgrimage into the Agrafa foothills, written up in 'Brousos' (1921), in which wit, learning, and unsparing criticism of Greek foibles clothe a robustly didactic philosophy of life. Other septuagenarian squibs were open letters, to the archbishop of Canterbury on the Dodecanese, and to the pope on fascism. 
Imposing, high-spirited, laconic, combative in his likes and dislikes, clubbable, philoprogenitive, princely in giving, Pallis played to perfection the reluctant (but successful) exile. Even on Merseyside he cherished his self-image as Lek the Longhair Arvanite, the warrior descending from the Balkan hills to champion common sense and common language. He died, fortified by the words of Plato's 'Phaedo', at his home in Liverpool on 18 March 1935, of uraemia and acute pyelitis. Appropriately the last of him, his ashes, were by his own wish brought from England and interred in Epirus, in the garden of the Philanthropinon monastery on the lake isle at Ioannina.

Meijer, Reinder Pieter (1926-1993), Dutch scholar, was born on 2 January 1926 in Zwolle, the Netherlands, the son of a head teacher. Little is known about his youth and early years, most probably because both he and his brother, the writer Henk Romijn Meijer (1929-2008), left the provincial Dutch town of their birth for Amsterdam at the earliest opportunity. In 1944 he completed his grammar school education in Zwolle, before moving in 1945 to post-war Amsterdam, where he studied Dutch language and literature at the University of Amsterdam. He became part of a group of young 'Neerlandici', or Dutch scholars, immortalized in the fiction of their colleague J. J. Voskuil. It was during this period that he met his wife, Edith, who was to remain his constant companion thereafter. 
Alongside his studies, Rein Meijer also worked as a research assistant at the Instituut voor Dialectologie in Amsterdam from 1948 to 1951, from where he was sent out into the field to follow the linguistic boundary between Dutch and French in Belgium. This he did on foot and by bicycle, becoming familiar with the language and culture of Flanders, something which would inform his later appreciation of the linguistic unity of the two Dutch-speaking territories. Having completed his studies in 1950, Meijer moved to Australia where he took up a teaching post at the University of Melbourne in 1951. There he embarked on a PhD on the work of the troubled twentieth-century Dutch poet Gerrit Achterberg. The doctorate was awarded in 1958 and though the thesis itself was never published, its subject featured in Meijer's work, including a special issue of 'Poetry Australia' in 1974 devoted to post-war Dutch and Flemish poetry, which was selected and introduced by Meijer. The volume opened with 'Trumpet' and 'Statue' by Gerrit Achterberg in strong translations by Meijer himself. 
Although most of his professional life was devoted to teaching and writing about literature, as a lecturer in Dutch outside the Netherlands Meijer faced the challenge of students who knew little or no Dutch on coming to university. His first book, written with Jacob Smit, a colleague at the University of Melbourne, was a textbook for learners of Dutch, 'A Dutch Grammar and Reader'. Published in 1958, it was one of the main textbooks in use at many universities around the world for some twenty years. Meijer's empathy and understanding, combined with an insistence on high standards, made him a memorably successful teacher. 
In 1971 Meijer took up the chair of Dutch studies at Bedford College in the University of London, where his interest in the relation between the language and culture of the Netherlands and that of Flanders provided the topic of his inaugural lecture, 'Dutch and Flemish: Two Literatures or One?'. As head of department, he consolidated the department of Dutch into a serious player in the field of Dutch studies, steering it through the rough waters of university reorganization to a new location at University College, London. This created opportunities for interdisciplinary research and teaching long before these became the norm: Meijer initiated a Centre for Low Countries Studies which brought language and literature scholars together with specialists in Dutch history and art history. He retired from the chair of Dutch studies in 1988, following a year spent teaching in Jakarta (1983-4) and a period of ill health. 
Meijer's major contribution to the field of Dutch literature was as a commentator, chronicler, literary historian, and, as Dick Boukema described him, a literary 'gatekeeper'. From about 1966 Meijer had begun to review new fiction for the Dutch newspaper 'NRC Handelsblad' under the pseudonym of P. M. Reinders, and continued to do so, producing more than 700 reviews of Dutch and English fiction by the time of his death. As well as helping to shape literary tastes in the Netherlands, he also wrote a more considered chronicle of Dutch literature for colleagues teaching at universities outside the Netherlands and Flanders in the journal of the International Association for Dutch Studies. The idea of regular chronicles on publications relevant for practitioners of Dutch studies was Meijer's own, which he duly put into practice for Dutch literature from 1978 onwards. His last chronicle appeared posthumously in October 1993. 

'Literature of the Low Countries', first published in 1971, completed Meijer's influence on the perception of Dutch literature and to some extent on the creation of a literary canon. In it he provided a history spanning the entire literary production of the Low Countries, that is, of both the Netherlands and Flanders, from the early medieval period to modern times. By contemporary Dutch standards it was a remarkably concise work, setting out to capture the bigger picture while at the same time offering lucid literary portraits, not so much of the writers themselves, but of their writing. Meijer demonstrated an unerring sense of the distinctive contribution of each writer, particularly of his (and only occasionally her) style of writing, characters, and preoccupations. As a literary historian he was most at home with the twentieth century, where his personal preferences played a part in his judgement. He championed the personal and subjective at a time when many of his colleagues, particularly in the Netherlands, were intent on becoming more scientific. He was something of a stylist himself, both in Dutch and English, producing a limpid prose which rejected fussiness and pomposity, reminiscent in its insistence on everyday language of the Dutch poets of the 1930s whose unassuming diction he so admired. The closing words of 'Literature of the Low Countries' were later much quoted: 'where the present tense asserts itself, History bows out' (2nd edn, 1978, 375). In 1978, the year in which the second, revised edition of 'Literature of the Low Countries' appeared, Meijer's beautifully written introduction to the novel 'Max Havelaar' was published in the 'Penguin Classics' series. In it, he created a vivid picture of the book's author, the former Dutch colonial administrator Multatuli (Eduard Douwes Dekker), preparing the reader for the complexities and tensions of an extraordinary narrative once described by D. H. Lawrence as 'the greatest mess possible' (Meijer, 'Introduction', Multatuli, 'Max Havelaar', 1978, 10). 
Meijer understood the importance of professional networks for teachers of Dutch who often worked on their own or in small departments. He was a founder-member of two associations: the Association of Dutch Language Teachers in the UK and the International Association for Dutch Studies, whose journal, 'Neerlandica Extra Muros', he helped to develop into a serious academic publication in the field of Dutch studies. During his retirement in Muswell Hill, London, he continued to work with literature in both Dutch and English. He collaborated with his wife, Edith, on translations of work by Saul Bellow and John Updike into Dutch, and in 1993, the year of his death, he published a reader of Dutch literature for learners of Dutch (co-edited with Jane Fenoulhet), 'Basisteksten Nederlands: Proza, 1930-1990'. He died at his home in Firs Avenue, Muswell Hill, London, on 29 September 1993, of cancer of the colon, having been supported throughout his final illness by Edith and their three children. He was cremated on 8 October 1993.

Latcham, Richard Edward (1869-1943), civil engineer and anthropologist, was born at Cross Hands, Almondsbury, Gloucestershire, on 5 March 1869, the second child and eldest son of Tucker Latcham ('b'. 1840/41), wheelwright, and his wife, Victoria Adelaide, 'nee' Cartwright ('b'. 1843/4). He was a boarder at Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School for boys in Bristol, and went on to the Polytechnic Institute, London, where he qualified in civil engineering in 1888. A meeting in London with a Chilean who was involved in the colonization of the Araucania region by Chile led to his appointment there as a surveyor and road builder, though he was as yet unable to speak Spanish. He remained in Araucania for five years engaged in land surveying and civil engineering projects, and also did some English teaching. Later he settled in La Serena, where he worked as a mining engineer, and married a Chilean woman. Although he spent his adult life in Chile, and was known as Ricardo Eduardo Latcham, he retained his British nationality. 
While working on the roads and railways in the southern regions Latcham met many Mapuche people; he learned their native language, Mapuzungun, and had ample opportunity to talk to them and observe their way of life. Following in the steps of Jose Toribio Medina (1852-1930) and Max Uhle (1856-1944), he decided to dedicate himself to the study of the Mapuche and other indigenous societies in Chile, and became a self-trained anthropologist, though it was not until 1928 that he could pursue these interests as a full-time activity. 
Latcham was one of the pioneers of Chilean anthropology, and indeed ethnography and the archaeology, undertaking excavations of burial mounds and cemeteries. He produced numerous books on indigenous histories, including books (in Spanish) on the Chango people of the Chilean coast (1910), the social organization and religious beliefs of the ancient Araucanians (1924), Chilean pre-history (1928), and the archaeology of the Atacama region (1938). He also published over 200 papers, including some in such major journals as the 'Revista Chilena de Historia y Geografia' and the 'Revista Chilena de Antropologia'. His research was admired for its critical and scientific method, and it continued to be cited long after his death, though some of his preoccupations -- notably his study of the size and thickness of the skulls of indigenous peoples, and definition of them as 'subraces' -- were anachronistically Victorian. 
In 1928 Latcham became director of the National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, a position he held until his death. During his directorship the museum secured the necessary funds to renovate its main building and it successfully re-launched the 'Boletin del Museo', a scholarly journal that included numerous pieces on the contemporary exhibits of the museum, the research of its staff, and broader debates about anthropology, archaeology, and museum theory. He secured the services of Grete Mostny, a renowned expert in pre-Columbian cultures and future director of the museum. From 1929 Latcham combined the museum directorship with the position of dean of the faculty of arts at the University of Chile, where he taught American prehistory. He was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of San Marcos, Lima, having carried out excavations on Inca sites in Peru, and the University of La Plata, Argentina; in 1939 the government of Chile conferred on him the order of merit. He died in Santiago on 16 October 1943. In 1969 the Chilean National Museum published 'In Homage to Ricardo Latcham'.

Woodward, Michael (1932-1973), Roman Catholic priest, was born in Vina del Mar, Chile, on 25 January 1932, the first of five children (three sons and two daughters) of Edward Gerard (Roy) Woodward (died 1999), an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Yriberry. His mother was Chilean (of Basque and Irish descent) and his father, who had been posted to Chile by his company in 1927, was the son of a British army officer; they had married in Chile in 1931, and remained there until 1947. Michael, who had dual nationality, spent the first fifteen years of his life in Chile. After attending a small school for English-speaking children in Vina del Mar he was sent in 1941 as a boarder to the Grange School in Santiago (originally founded to prepare English-speaking boys for the examinations needed for entry to public schools in England). In 1947 his father arranged for him to travel to England and to study at Downside, a Catholic boarding school in Somerset. According to Michael's biographer, who was one of his friends at Downside, Roy Woodward always considered his son's home to be England (Crouzet, 6); his Englishness, both in speech and manner, was commented on throughout his later life in Chile. 
After completing his secondary schooling Woodward went on to study at King's College, London (1950-53), where he obtained a pass degree in civil engineering. In 1954 he decided to go back to Chile to train as a priest. He entered the pontifical seminary in Santiago in March 1954 and was ordained to the subdiaconate in June 1960 and to the priesthood in February 1961. Between 1961 and 1963 he undertook a course at the Institut Superieur de Catechetique in Paris, and returned to Chile in 1964 having 'discovered a completely new theology' (Crouzet, 30). A new understanding of what it meant to be a Christian emerged at this time; Latin America's traditionally conservative Catholic church began to take a greater interest in and to seek to change the lives of the poor. Institutionalized at the Second Vatican Council (1962-5) and the Conference of Latin American Bishops in Medellin (1968), the 'theology of liberation' allowed for a dialogue between Christians and Marxists. Organized movements of Christian activists sought to use religion as a base from which to transform society. To their minds, Christian faith had to be linked to social action to be meaningful. In Chile as elsewhere, many priests spoke out against social injustices and sought to provide leadership to politically marginalized groups. 
Woodward, who spent the years 1964 to 1966 at the chaplains' house at Valparaiso, was greatly influenced by and took an active part in such initiatives to construct a 'church of the people'. In June 1966 he was appointed priest of the parish of Pena Blanca, a small suburban town near Vina del Mar, where he became involved in the religious education provided by local schools, began to work with youth groups in the area, and used scriptural quotations to emphasize God's love for the poor. In April 1969 he visited Europe on leave, and when he returned to Chile later in the year he left his parish, and moved to Cerro Placeres in Valparaiso. He joined a movement of priests called Christians for Socialism (who claimed that the aims of a true Christian were essentially socialist) and found employment as a lathe operator in a shipyard, where he took a particular interest in providing educational opportunities for the workers. 
During the first year of the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende, elected in September 1970, Woodward taught physics and mathematics in the Centre for Studies and Industrial Training (CESCLA), a department of the Catholic University of Valparaiso. Its objective was to enable workers to gain a university qualification. He also became a member of a local action group linked to the Unified Movement for Political Action (MAPU), which was involved in land occupations after the earthquake that damaged Valparaiso in July 1971. Later he was nominated president of his neighbourhood council's provision and price committee, a response to the food shortages and the exorbitant prices of black market goods that plagued Allende's administration (the committees attempted to supply essential foods to people at affordable prices). 
Woodward was formally suspended from the priesthood by Bishop Emilio Tagle in August 1972. Just over a year later, on 11 September 1973, Allende's socialist experiment was brought to an abrupt halt by a violent military coup. The government of the junta of the armed forces declared that Allende's government had 'engendered a blind, fratricidal struggle based on ideas alien to our national heritage' (that is socialism); it proclaimed that the 'internal and external security of the country [was] in dire peril', that its 'very existence as an independent state [was] in danger' ('The reasons of the junta', reproduced in Loveman and Davies). Through his involvement with radicalized church organizations and as a leader of a pro-Allende neighbourhood council, Woodward was doubtless regarded as part of the 'subversive threat' that the military junta intended to eliminate. 
There are disputed accounts as to when Woodward was arrested. In 1991 the report of the Chilean national commission on truth and reconciliation (also known as the Rettig commission), which investigated human rights abuses resulting in death or disappearance during the years of military rule, concluded that he was arrested by a naval patrol at Cerro los Placeres on 16 September 1973. Subsequently it has been suggested that he was not arrested until 22 September (Crouzet). There is, however, a consensus about what happened to Woodward once he was arrested: he was interrogated and tortured aboard the 'Esmeralda', a naval training ship, and died later on 22 September 1973 at the naval hospital at Valaparaiso from internal injuries sustained during his torture. (The official death certificate recorded his death as having taken place on the public highway at Valaparaiso on 22 September, from 'cardio-respiratory arrest'.) He was buried in a pauper's grave at the edge of the cemetery of Playa Ancha, though his body has never been found. In November 2008 nineteen former naval officials were arrested and charged with his murder.

Kaufmann, Gordon Bernie (1888-1949), architect, was born on 19 March 1888 at Leiningen Villa, Lowther Hill, Forest Hill, Kent, the son of Gustav Kaufmann ('b'. 1849), an immigrant merchant from Bavaria, and his wife, Matilda May, 'nee' Isaacs ('b'. 1850), from Margate, Kent, and of Scottish descent; though his mother's maiden name was given as Isaacs in the census of 1911 it was entered as Cook on Kaufmann's death certificate. Kaufmann's second forename at birth, Beni -- which he later changed to Bernie -- reflects his father's Jewish origins. Little is known of his early years, and his own record is not wholly reliable. His parents moved regularly between England and Germany, poignantly naming their successive Surrey residences Homeville. In 1896 Kaufmann's name appears in the rolls of the Hansa School in Bergendorf, outside Hamburg, and he entered Whitgift School, Croydon, in 1903, albeit for a shorter time than he later stated. At Whitgift he apparently struck up a strong relationship with the chief science master, Walter Cross. Cross must have recognized his talent and potential, since two years later he was apprenticed to the architect A. W. S. Cross, Walter's eldest brother, chiefly known for his design of public swimming baths. Kaufmann studied at the London Polytechnic and the Royal Institute of British Architects, gaining his studentship in 1908. 
According to informal comments to his friends and associates Kaufmann next spent time in continental Europe, some of it working in architects' offices in Germany. In 1910 he emigrated to Canada and worked for architectural practices in Montreal and Winnipeg. In April 1912 he married Eva St Denis McFarland ('b'. 1888), from Winona, Ontario. By 1914 he had decided to emigrate again, this time to southern California, purportedly for reasons of his wife's health. Immigration records show the Kaufmanns, travelling with a son, Kenneth, who was born before their marriage, and a very young daughter, Cecil, disembarking in Vancouver with a destination of Pasadena. In Los Angeles he had trouble finding work, and was employed as a gardener before being taken on as a draughtsman in the partnership of Reginald Johnson and Roland E. Coate, known for their Spanish colonial revival designs. In 1920 he became an associate of the firm and quickly made his mark. He was approved as a member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1921, and became a partner of the firm in the following year. During the early 1920s he contributed to many high-class residential commissions, as well as public buildings, including All Saints Episcopal Church, Pasadena, and St Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, Los Angeles (dem. 1980), both influenced by English styles. He also co-operated with Paul Thiene and Frank Lloyd Wright (responsible for landscaping) on the Ben R. Meyer residence, where he made his mark 'as a virtuoso interpreter of Mediterranean traditions' (Watters, 75). 
In 1924 the partnership with Johnson and Coate was dissolved -- amicably, according to Kaufmann, who now set up his own practice. With money and skilled craftsmen available, this was a prosperous time and many southern Californian architects experimented with the Mediterranean style, which they considered naturally appropriate for their region. In 1924 Kaufmann was appointed to the design committee of Bel Air, whose developers encouraged designs drawing on the region's Spanish heritage. Kaufmann was responsible for several fine residences, including the Arthur S. Bent house (1926), and Il Vescovo ('The Bishop', 1927, for William T. Bishop), where he used patently Italianate styles to fashion a distinctly Californian mansion. One of his most significant commissions was for the Isadore Eisner house, Hancock Park, which won him his first AIA award in 1926, and which, with its multiple courtyards, became the prototype for his later work at Scripps College. In 1928 Kaufmann put forward the Eisner house as a model for the restoration of domestic privacy for clients seeking to escape the city ('A house of Tuscan inspiration', 'Arts and Decoration', Feb 1928). 
Kaufmann's reputation spread quickly and he took on many ambitious and high-profile contracts. In 1927 he executed the original design for the Beverly House, later owned by William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies. His most famous commission in this decade was perhaps the sixty-seven-room Greystone Mansion (1928), built for the oil baron Edward Doheny, with its English Gothic exterior and eighteenth-century English interior set in more than 400 acres of grounds; the house, which features prominently in the works of Raymond Chandler, remains a popular location for film-makers. Called extravagant and disproportionate by some critics -- and possibly the subject of Edmund Wilson's uncomplimentary reference to a 'pocket-size replica of heraldic Warwick Castle' (E. Wilson, 'American Jitters', 1932, 226) -- Greystone 'reflected Kaufmann's deft ability to combine elements of different periods in compositions that were subtle, classically proportioned, and seemingly of a single style' (Watters, 226). This assignment was followed by two prominent structures of enduring appeal, Scripps College, Claremont, and the La Quinta Inn, Desert Springs. A commission for the Royal Laundry, Pasadena (1927), brought out Kaufmann's underlying interest in technology and its relationship to design, and he also started experimenting with art deco influences. Nevertheless the traditional projects continued. In 1928, the year in which the architect Harris Allen first defined the notion of the eclectic 'California architecture', Kaufmann designed the Athenaeum at Caltech -- truly more suggestive of the Italian Renaissance -- and then built his own house at Holmby Hills in authentically California Mediterranean style. 
By now Kaufmann's marriage was failing. He sold the Holmby Hills house in 1931. Some time after this Kaufmann married Elsie Bryant (1890-1968), and he was happy to let the official records state that this was his only marriage. Though demand for large-scale residential projects declined during the depression, Kaufmann continued to accept prominent residential commissions like the Malcolm McNaghten house (1933) in Holmby Hills -- acquired by Bing Crosby in 1943 and later demolished by Aaron Spelling -- in addition to other work in Pasadena and La Quinta. However, he also turned to commercial and industrial work, including an art deco styling of Santa Anita racetrack, which opened in 1934 and for which he was awarded a bronze medal at the Paris International Exhibition in 1937. 
As president of the AIA's southern California chapter (1930-32) and head of the California state chamber of commerce, Kaufmann's reputation continued to grow and he used his connections well -- mixing as easily with the bohemians of Jake Zeitlin's circle as with the bibliophilic Zamorano Club and industry and cinema magnates. The years 1932-3 also saw a dramatic shift from his Mediterranean phase to modernism. His Los Angeles Times Building is an imposing slab design, decorated with classical reliefs, which dominates its surroundings and symbolizes the power and influence of the newspaper's publisher, Harry Chandler. Commissioned in 1931 and completed four years later, it was awarded a gold medal at the Paris exhibition. In 1931 Kaufmann was also selected by the US Bureau of Reclamation to design three buildings for dam workers in Boulder City, a project that led to an invitation to assess plans for the Hoover Dam itself. Without any relevant experience he was then selected to design the dam (known until 1947 as the Boulder Dam), perhaps his most magnificent and famous construction. Many observers believe that Chandler, an advocate of the development of new water sources for southern California, must have helped Kaufmann win these commissions. Certainly the Hoover Dam project -- situated on the Colorado River between Arizona and Nevada -- gave him a remarkable opportunity. Kaufmann's designs, based on a preliminary sketch published in January 1933, reshaped the dam's crest, intake towers, spillways, and the powerhouse at the foot of the structure. Here Kaufmann was able to display his talent for integrating modernism and art deco in a design that married functionalism with elegance, creating what he described as 'a visual scheme that would complement rather than clash with the engineer's design' ('The architecture of Boulder Dam', 'Architectural Concrete', 2/3, 1936). His hand is also evident in the dam's coloration and interior design, and he similarly oversaw the competition to select the dam's ornamental monuments. Among recent commentators Wilson has suggested that Kaufmann's scheme was influenced by Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' -- and also possibly by the Italian futurist Antonio Sant' Elia, and Tony Garnier's designs for dams in 'Une cite industrielle' -- while Starr notes the influence of 'The Metropolis of Tomorrow' (1929) by the architectural illustrator Hugh Ferris. Kaufmann's achievement was to transform the previous inelegant drawings for the Hoover Dam into a far more impressive concept that highlighted the underlying technology while bringing the structure into closer harmony with its environment. Success on the Colorado River also led to his involvement in the design of the Parker, Grand Coulee, and Shasta dams. Later examples of Kaufmann's modernism, with strong echoes of his designs for the Hoover Dam, include the Salisbury Investment Company Building in Salt Lake City (1935) and the Aluminum Company of America Building in Vernon, California (1938). 
In 1937 Kaufmann was elected a fellow of the AIA and from 1939 to 1940 he was a co-designer of the Arrowhead Springs Hotel, in the Inland Empire region of southern California. In 1940, with accurate premonitions of public opinion, he published an article on the equitable distribution of architectural commissions during wartime. Kaufmann had taken American citizenship in 1934 and in November 1941 left his architectural practice to join the chemical warfare service in Washington, DC, with the rank of colonel. He received the Legion of Merit on his discharge in November 1945 and returned to architectural work in California as senior partner at Kaufmann, Lippincott, and Eggers, concentrating on modernist and international styles, including offices for the Shell Oil Company at Shell Point ('c'.1944). Photographs from this period show him to have suffered a rapid deterioration in health. After several months of illness he died from lung cancer on 1 March 1949, at his home, 627 South Carondelet Street, Los Angeles, and was buried at the Golden Gate National Cemetery, San Bruno, California. He was survived by his second wife, who, following her death on 7 June 1968, was buried next to him. At his request his architectural papers were destroyed. 
The recognition that Kaufmann now enjoys as an architect was, for several reasons, relatively slowly established. A modest and unassuming man, he did not boast of his achievements or promote himself strongly. His age was dominated by Frank Lloyd Wright, whose character was the direct antithesis of Kaufmann's, and by the mostly fruitless debates about traditionalism and modernism. In March 1949 the AIA awarded its gold medal to Lloyd Wright (who was not a member, and who disapproved of the organization); Kaufmann received a one-line death notice in the association's journal a year later. Subsequently his name has often been misrepresented (as, for example, George Kaufman) in popular books on architecture. Furthermore, architectural taste in the United States was for a long time determined by an east-coast elite sceptical of Californian designs. 
It was not until the 1970s that critics and historians made serious appraisals of work by Kaufmann and his fellow southern California architects. His domestic architecture has been praised by Clark for its clean exploitation of space and integration of multiple influences into a recognizable Californian style, with Kaufmann bringing 'a generosity of approach which was partly personal and also part of his inheritance, a peculiarly British sensibility about the house and about public work' (Clark, 1). Kaufmann certainly brought a sense of proportion to a Mediterranean style often prone to excess and eclecticism, and the lessons he had learned in Britain and continental Europe -- from the Ecole des Beaux Arts and from Edwin Lutyens -- led him to build dignified and memorable homes alongside the more expansive designs for which he was commissioned. Nevertheless his most famous legacy remains the Hoover Dam. Writing in 1937 J. B. Priestley considered Kaufmann's design worthy of the description 'a work of art; as if something that began with utility and civil engineering ended somewhere in the neighbourhood of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony' ('Midnight on the Desert', 1937, 111), while to a later commentator Kaufmann converted the dam's 'banal, warmed-over classicism... into a vibrant symbol of modernity' (Wilson, 'American modernism', 312). However, his diffidence regarding the dam -- coupled with his wish (recounted to Clark) that he had made the Los Angeles Times Building 'more modern' -- suggest that Kaufmann was more at ease with his more modest public projects and his domestic designs.

Matthews, Abraham (1832-1899), Congregational minister and settler in Patagonia, was born at Llanidloes, Montgomeryshire, in October 1832, the son of John Matthews or Mathews ('b'. 1800), weaver, and his wife, Ann Jones ('b'. 1804). When he was three years old his parents went to Australia and, owing to his weak constitution, he was left in Wales in the care of Edward and Ann Lewis, farmers from Cardiganshire who at the time lived in Bryn Du, near Llanidloes, and had four children of their own. The whole family then moved to Blaencwmlline, Cemais, where he was christened ('c'.1836). He stayed on the farm until the age of twelve, when he served his apprenticeship in a textile factory in Newtown apparently belonging to his paternal grandfather, John Matthews. He left the factory about 1848 to earn a living as a craftsman, but he soon decided to leave these occupations to follow a different calling. 
Despite his affluent family background Matthews kept a distant relationship with his father and reportedly refused his share of the family inheritance, only accepting the family bible. The religious fervour inherited from his maternal grandfather, Abraham Jones, was nurtured in his adopted home by his surrogate father, a faithful member of the Cemais Calvinistic Methodist chapel, where Matthews enthusiastically attended Sunday school. After his conversion at the age of seventeen he became a member of the Congregational church at Llanwnnog and officiated at Sammah Congregational Chapel, Cwmlline, before starting his theological studies at Bala College. It was during the three years he spent in Bala (1856-9) that, greatly influenced by the principal, Michael D. Jones, he became aware of plans to channel Welsh emigration into a single settlement where colonists could preserve their cultural heritage and achieve self-government. 
After his graduation from Bala, Matthews preached at the recently established Congregational chapels of Horeb, Llwydcoed (1859-65), and Elim, Cwmdar (1859-60), as well as Adulam, Merthyr Tudful (1862-5). On 22 May 1863, at Merthyr's Congregational Ynysgau Chapel, he married Gwenllian Thomas (1842-1922). 
When the first contingent to the Welsh settlement ('y Wladfa', 'the colony') in Patagonia was organized Matthews not only enlisted but also inspired about fifteen settlers from the Aberdar area to join him, his wife, and six-month-old daughter, Mary Ann, aboard the 'Mimosa', which departed from Liverpool on 28 May 1865. They arrived at New Bay (later Porth Madryn or Puerto Madryn) on 28 July. Although he joined the venture as a mere settler, the bishop of 'y Wladfa', as he became known, was to play a key role in the development of the colony. In the first sermon delivered there he likened the Welsh settlers in the Chubut steppe to the Israelites in the desert. He was one of three preachers among the settlers aboard the 'Mimosa'; the other two, Robert Meirion Williams (Baptist, from Llanfairfechan) and Lewis Humphreys (Congregational, from Dolgellau), had returned to Wales by 1867. Their departures left him to tend to the spiritual needs of the Welsh Patagonian community single-handed until the arrival in 1874 of another three clergymen: David Lloyd Jones (a former teacher at Bala College who carried out missionary work among Patagonia's indigenous peoples), John Caerenig Evans, and David Stephen Davies (1841-1898). Matthews received no stipend for his services and earned a living from labouring on his farm and hunting with his dog. These circumstances led him to assert, on an occasion when his hound was prevented from entering the chapel where he was to preach, that his faithful companion contributed more than many of the settlers to the maintenance of religious services in 'y Wladfa'. His zeal for preaching resulted in his characteristic limp: in his haste to deliver a sermon in one of the chapels of the Chubut Valley he prematurely discarded a plaster cast placed around his broken leg after a horse-kick. 
Matthews also played a significant role in the civic dimension of the settlement: he was a member of the first elected council and of various decision-making committees formed thereafter. Moreover it was largely due to his (self-funded) canvassing trips to Wales and the United States in 1873-4 that by 1875 the population of the settlement, which had previously been in decline, tripled. He lived there in Rawson (at Parc yr Esgob, 'bishop's field') and Drofa Dulog but returned to Wales in 1889-90 and again in 1892-4. The latter visit was undertaken with the intention of staying there permanently for the sake of the education of his two younger children, and he became a preacher at Severn Road Congregational Chapel, Cardiff. On hearing of the death of his fellow pioneer Edwin Cynrig Roberts, he set about writing 'Hanes y Wladfa Gymreig yn Patagonia' (1894), the first published chronicle of the Welsh settlement in Chubut. 
In 1894 Matthews returned to Patagonia, where he resumed his work as a minister in various chapels and took on the role of editor of 'Y Dravod', the newspaper established by his 'rival' Lewis Jones in 1891. He died at 300 Avenida Fontana, Trelew, Patagonia, on 1 April 1899, as a result of an acute bout of double pneumonia contracted while fulfilling his pastoral duties. His wife and four of his five children survived him. He was buried on 3 April in the graveyard of Moriah Chapel, near Trelew, where he had preached since it was built in 1880.

Grubb, Wilfrid Barbrooke (1865-1930), missionary and explorer in Paraguay, was born at Ferryhill, Liberton, Edinburgh, on 11 August 1865, the third of five children of John Barbrooke Grubb (1823-1893), chemist, and his wife, Ann Mary Lang (1825-1916). He was of Scottish descent, though both parents were by birth English and by denomination Anglican. He was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh. Not scholarly, he excelled at games. By the age of sixteen he was showing interest in religion. Two probable influences on his choice of career were the writings of the Scottish religious author Henry Drummond (1851-1897) and the visit to Edinburgh in 1883 of the American evangelist Dwight Lyman Moody. Having initially contemplated overseas mission service in Africa, on or around his nineteenth birthday Grubb offered himself to the South American Missionary Society (SAMS), an Anglican organization. The society accepted him for service a year later. In the intervening period he was a lay reader and undertook other parish duties in Chobham, Surrey. In March 1886 he set sail for the society's mission base on Keppel Island in the Falklands. 
From Keppel missionaries evangelized among the indigenous Yahgan people of Tierra del Fuego, some of whom were brought to the island for that purpose. For three years Grubb worked as a lay catechist. During this time, and largely at the prompting of Waite Hockin Stirling, first bishop of the Falkland Islands, SAMS began a new attempt (earlier efforts having proved unsuccessful) to extend its operations further into the interior of Chile, and also into Paraguay. In September 1889 Adolpho Henricksen, the leader of the Paraguayan mission, died, not long after commencing work. The society nominated Grubb as his replacement. Before he departed from Keppel in November Grubb became engaged to Mary Ann Varder Bridges (1870-1922), daughter of the Revd Thomas Bridges, former SAMS missionary. Their engagement lasted eleven and a half years. 
Grubb's destination was the Paraguayan Chaco, a vast, remote region, arid in parts but also with extensive areas of forest and pasture. The Chaco was sparsely populated by diverse groupings of indigenous peoples. Grubb's main priority was to locate a suitable site for a mission base. He spent much of 1890 exploring the region. Despite its remoteness the Chaco was not untouched by Western influences. Following a disastrous war that ended in 1869 the Paraguayan government, bankrupt, sold huge tracts of land to overseas business interests. By the late 1880s cattle ranches had been established, as had factories processing quebracho logs for tannin. Inevitably these developments had implications for indigenous peoples. They also affected the conditions for missionary work. Grubb's initial attempts to find a suitable permanent mission base were not successful. In late 1891, however, the representative of an English company operating in Paraguay offered land at Makthlawaiya free of charge to the mission. Grubb took advantage of this offer, and over the next four years expanded both the size of the mission and the range of its activities. 
Grubb was fascinated by the Chaco and its people. He took every opportunity to explore and to record his observations. He later wrote that 'there is a sense of freedom and novelty in such a life, which people who are in normal touch with civilisation cannot possibly understand or appreciate' ('A Church in the Wilds'). He believed, not unjustifiably, that his presence among the local Lengua Indians gave him special insight into their lives. They appear, in the main, to have liked and respected him. He enhanced his reputation among them by surviving a potentially fatal assault by an ostensibly friendly Indian associate. 
Although the mission's primary aims were evangelization and the building up of an indigenous church, Grubb insisted that the Lengua should acquire skills necessary to adapt to the demands of Western farming and industry. If they were to survive as a people, he surmised, some at least would need to become wage labourers. He intended that the mission would look after their interests, negotiating with foreign businesses and with the Paraguayan authorities on their behalf until they were able to do so themselves. 
The number of converts remained small and some SAMS officials and supporters questioned Grubb's emphasis on 'industrial' training; but Stirling was supportive, as was his successor as bishop from 1902, Edward Francis Every. Grubb was becoming an important asset to the society. On his first furlough, in 1896, he undertook an extensive series of promotional tours throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland. These appear to have been successful, not least because of the information about South America that Grubb was able to impart to his audiences. He was a good speaker, and illustrated his talks with lantern slides, photographs, and Lengua 'curios' brought from Paraguay. By the time of his next furlough, in 1899-1900, Grubb was becoming better known, both as a missionary and as an explorer. He presented a paper on the Chaco and its people at the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in January 1900. Returning to South America via Canada and the United States enabled him to publicize further the work of the mission and also, in New York in April, to address an international ecumenical conference on foreign missions. In 1901 he began work on a book. Based mainly on his correspondence and reports, this was published three years later as 'Among the Indians of the Paraguayan Chaco'. 
Also in 1901 Mary Bridges, who had been living with her family in Tierra del Fuego, joined Grubb in Buenos Aires. There they were married on 15 May 1901, and they spent three years together in the Chaco. Thereafter they were apart for long periods as she returned to Scotland, where their two daughters were born: Bertha in 1904 and Ethel (known as Molly) in 1909. 
Committed to what he described as the 'temporal welfare' of indigenous peoples, Grubb founded in 1900 a local organization to that end, the Paraguayan Chaco Indian Association. This represented a further step towards making the mission at Makthlawaiya into a self-sufficient, co-operative Christian community. However, he was by now restless and keen to evangelize and explore more widely afield. In 1909, back in London again, he secured from the general committee of SAMS permission to begin planning a mission in the Argentinian Chaco. 
At this time the London publishing firm of Seeley & Co. approached the committee, suggesting that the story of the Paraguay mission had the makings of a bestseller (with royalties that would accrue to the society). In 1911 Seeley issued 'An Unknown People in an Unknown Land'. Packed with incident and ethnographic detail and not excessively religious in tone, the book made Grubb's reputation as an expert on the indigenous peoples of South America. He also published articles in learned journals and, in 1914, a further book, 'A Church in the Wilds'. In June 1919 the Royal Geographical Society elected him an honorary fellow. 
Grubb's renown helped attract recruits and funds for SAMS's work. The strain of constant travel and difficulties in setting up an 'industrial' mission in the Argentinian Chaco adversely affected his health. Nevertheless, with other Anglican missionaries and clergy, he argued for further expansion of missionary activity in South America, in part to prevent recurrence of atrocities such as those Roger Casement exposed in the Putumayo region of Peru in 1912. 
Grubb's health broke down and he returned home in August 1912. He recovered and resumed work in June 1913, but his thoughts turned increasingly to retirement and reunion with his wife, Mary, and their daughters, in Scotland since 1909. Not until October 1921, however, his health failing, did he finally leave South America for the last time, to settle in Lasswade, near Edinburgh. Shortly after his arrival Mary Grubb became ill, and died on 9 January 1922. Grubb continued to live at Lasswade until his death there, at his home, Springbank Lodge, on 28 May 1930. His funeral took place at St John's Church, Edinburgh. He was buried at Liberton, next to his wife, on 31 May. 
Grubb's mission strategy represented in part an attempt to ameliorate the harmful effects of Western expansion on the indigenous peoples of the Chaco. He regarded those peoples as both childlike and independent-minded, and he viewed them with a scientific as well as a missionary eye. Through lectures, articles in journals, and books he conveyed information about Paraguay to a very wide audience (some of his writings have been translated into Spanish). In the 1920s and 1930s Seeley & Co. issued many books about his life and work. These were aimed at both adults and children and they almost invariably presented the 'Livingstone of South America', as he had become widely known, as an exemplar of British Christian courage, endurance, and humanitarianism.

Caldcleugh, Alexander (1795-1858), businessman and traveller, was born on 17 June 1795 in London (where he was baptized at St Olave's, Hart Street), the only son and fourth of five children of Alexander Caldcleugh (died 1809), shipowner and merchant, of Broad Green, Croydon, Surrey, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Beatson (died 1835). He inherited property in Scotland from his father, who was of Scottish descent. Little else is known of his early life. 
On 9 September 1819 Caldcleugh left Plymouth on HMS 'Superb' for Rio de Janeiro, where he arrived on 21 October 1819 as private secretary to Sir Edward Thornton (1766-1852), the British minister to the Portuguese court in Brazil. Caldcleugh remained in Rio and its surroundings from October 1819 until January 1821, when he was invited by Captain Stanhope to visit Buenos Aires on board the 'Alacrity'. He visited Montevideo before arriving on 5 February 1821 at Buenos Aires, where he was well received by a local British merchant, George Frederick Dickson, who was later appointed consul to London by the Buenos Aires government. From the River Plate Caldcleugh travelled to Mendoza, and subsequently to Chile. On 14 April 1821 he left Valparaiso for Lima on board the 'Creole', and stayed in Peru for few days. Afterwards he returned to Valparaiso, and from there once again crossed the Andes and arrived back at Mendoza on 9 June 1821. From Mendoza Caldcleugh returned to Buenos Aires and there embarked for Rio de Janeiro in late June. At the end of 1821 he left Brazil for England, where he arrived on 22 November 1821. 
From 1822 to 1829 Caldcleugh lived at Broad Green, Croydon. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1822, and a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1823, having collected South American plant specimens for A. B. Lambert of Kew Gardens. The Chilean plant 'Caldcluvia' was named for him. During his travels in South America he had kept a detailed diary, on the basis of which he published 'Travels in South America, During the Years, 1819-20-21, Containing an Account of the Present State of Brazil, Buenos Ayres, and Chile' (2 vols., 1825), which was very well received in Britain, and was translated into German the following year. Travellers wrote extensively about Latin America during the decades of independence, and among the British writings Caldcleugh's are regarded as some of the most important descriptive works. They contain not only personal experiences, but also historic, geographic, statistical, and commercial information. 
In 1829 Caldcleugh returned to Chile as a commissioner to liquidate the failed Anglo-Chilean Mining Company. He made personal investments in mining enterprises in the provinces of Coquimbo and Serena (his greatest investment is believed to have been the Panulcillo mine, Ovalle), and he also acquired farming land in central Chile. He was appointed agent of the British bondholders of the loan of $1 million that the government of Chile had raised in London in 1822. The Chilean government defaulted on the loan in 1826, and Caldcleugh entered into direct negotiations to obtain payment of dividends and in 1842 reached a settlement for the repayment of the debt. In the early 1840s he was entrusted with similar powers by the British bondholders of the 'Peruvian loan'. He negotiated with the Chilean government on behalf of Admiral Thomas Cochrane to obtain compensation for Cochrane's services. Caldcleugh himself was appointed by a Chilean governmental decree of 19 May 1835 to organize the circulation in Chile of British copper coins of low denomination: the first copper coins arrived in Valparaiso from London in July 1836, followed by a second cargo in early 1837. In 1855, with two other British investors (Thomas Cood and William Waddington), he obtained the exclusive rights to build a railway between La Serena and Coquimbo, one of the first to be constructed in South America. 
Caldcleugh maintained his scientific interests and in 1831 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, publishing a paper on the Chilean earthquake of 1835 in the society's 'Philosophical Transactions'. He was recommended to Charles Darwin by Henry Stephen Fox, the British minister at Rio de Janeiro, as 'a very accomplished chemist and mineralogist, as well as a most agreeable well informed and obliging person' (Fox to Darwin, 25 July 1834, 'The Correspondence of Charles Darwin', vol. 1, 1985, 403). During the 'Beagle' voyage Darwin visited him, first in 1834 at Santiago de Chile and Valparaiso, and again at Valparaiso in 1835, when Caldcleugh assisted his excursion through the Andes. He invited Darwin to visit his mine of Panulcillo, where they spent a few days together in May 1835. 
During his residence in Chile, Caldcleugh lived at Valparaiso, Santiago de Chile, Coquimbo, Ovalle, and La Serena. On 5 July 1845 he married Leonor del Carmen Calvo (1805-1849), the widow of Manuel Jose Valdivieso y Balmaceda (died 1844). A widower, Caldcleugh spent his last two years semi-retired at Valparaiso, where he died on 11 January 1858 in the house of Isabel Valdivieso, sister of Miguel Estalisnao Valdivieso, who regarded himself as Caldcleugh's 'political son'. He was buried in Valparaiso cemetery. Having no children of his own, he bequeathed his property to his deceased wife's three daughters.

Koebel, William Henry (1872-1923), businessman and author, was born at 4 The Drive, Honor Oak Park, Forest Hill, Kent, on 11 January 1872, the eldest son in the family of five sons and two daughters of Oscar Koebel (1835/6-1921) and his wife, Emma Elizabeth ('b'. 1836/7), daughter of William Mills, an officer in the Royal Navy. Both parents were born in London. The Koebel family lived at The Mount, Duppas Hill, Coulsdon, and was comfortably off. Oscar Koebel was in partnership in the City of London with A. F. Koebel; they acted as East India merchants specializing in the indigo trade until the partnership was dissolved in 1893. 
William Koebel was educated privately and in France, Germany, and Switzerland. Early in his adult life he was listed as a wine merchant, and his occupation was given as 'merchant' when he married, on 19 March 1898, Eleanor Mabel, who was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and was the daughter of Anthony Garstin of New Zealand. They had one daughter, Marjorie, who seems to have taken her mother's maiden name after the Second World War. 
Koebel was a prolific author and traveller, especially in South America, during the years before and after the First World War. His particular interest was trade and the British share in Latin America. Articles that had appeared in the 'Manchester Guardian' and 'The Globe' were the basis of his book 'Modern Argentina: the El Dorado of Today' (1907) which contended that while South America offered considerable business opportunities, Britain's former trade supremacy was being challenged by other nations, which he attributed to the conservatism of British business practice and especially to its failure to respond to the needs of local markets. These were continuing themes of many of his writings. He undertook special commissions for 'The Times' and such other journals as 'The Standard' and 'The Sphere' and was editor-in-chief of the 'Encyclopaedia of South America' (1913). 
Koebel's 'British Exploits in South America' (1917), which celebrated the Britons who had played a noteworthy part in the making of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries of South America, was criticized in the 'American Historical Review' (1917) for its scholarly deficiencies and partiality, but the book's tone was consistent with the propaganda mission he undertook in the region in 1917 and 1918, for which he received the thanks of the war council in 1921. His four brothers were commissioned officers in the British armed forces during the war (one of them dying at Gallipoli) and he refuted journalistic innuendo about possible German sympathies, suggested by his surname, explaining that only a weakness of the heart prevented him from enlisting (Koebel, 'British Exploits', viii-ix). 
In the years immediately after the First World War Koebel renewed his urgings that British businesses should address the potential of the South American market, now penetrated by both the United States and Japan. 'South America: an Industrial and Commercial Field' (1918; 2nd edn, 1923) encouraged British exporters to emphasize the prestige built up by British settlement in the region over the previous century, while 'The Great South Land' (1919) described the British communities on the River Plate and in southern Brazil, and emphasized the personal ties between Britain and South America, while insisting on the need for more advertisement of British products. One of his recurrent complaints was that the heads of British firms rarely visited South America, and he founded and compiled the 'Anglo-South American Handbook', first published in 1921 by the Federation of British Industries as a comprehensive guide to the countries of South America, as well as Mexico and Cuba, and providing commercial data intended specifically for the business traveller. This became 'The South American Handbook', which remains his principal legacy. 
Koebel's writings did not meet with universal approval and his view of British commercial weakness was often coloured by his emphasis on the failure to employ the decimal system and trained commercial travellers rather than more fundamental and deep-seated issues like shortage of capital and lack of shipping capacity in the post-war years. He was nevertheless a readable and well-informed commentator on British interests in South America. He died on 20 June 1923 at his home, 23 Gilston Road, the Boltons, London, having contracted pneumonia. His funeral was held at Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his wife and daughter.

Hedges, Frederick Albert Mitchell- (1882-1959), adventurer and travel writer, was born in Barnsbury, Islington, London, on 22 October 1882, the eldest of four children of John Hedges (1847-1934), a dealer in precious metals and jewellery from Aston Abbotts, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Julia Alice ('b'. 1852), daughter of Martin Goldstein, a Polish-born silversmith. In common with other members of his family Frederick adopted the name Mitchell from his paternal grandmother, Louisa Mitchell, and from his early twenties signed himself Mitchell-Hedges. Educated at Berkhamsted School and University College School, London, he renounced formal education at sixteen and at the instigation of his father joined a copper prospecting expedition to northern Norway under George Brooke Mee. After returning to London he worked as a clerk in the stock exchange until early 1902 when he departed for Montreal, then to New York, to seek his fortune on Wall Street. Back in London and running a stockbroking business, he married on 24 November 1906 Lilian Agnes (Dolly) Clarke ('b'. 1878), the Pimlico-resident daughter of Alexander Clarke, deceased, and his wife, Charlotte. The couple subsequently moved into Charlotte's country house at Sandbanks, near Parkstone, Dorset, and although they enjoyed separate lives for the next forty years they appear to have remained on friendly terms, Frederick, throughout his travels, consistently nominating Lilian as next of kin. 
Between 1907 and 1918 Mitchell-Hedges visited the United States on at least three occasions, and in 1913 migrated to Mexico, where he might have been associated with the rebel leader Pancho Villa. He was back in England early in 1914 when he fathered a son, Frederick Joseph Stanners Mitchell-Hedges (died 1977), with a Miss Mary Florence Stanners. The son became an officer in the Royal Artillery, serving for some time in Tanganyika. Mitchell-Hedges' third visit to New York in January 1917 brought him into contact with Lev Davidovich Bronstein (Leon Trotsky). Later that year he set out for Port Colborne, Ontario, to trace the surviving members of the le Guillon family, whom he had met in France in 1906 and who had since emigrated to Canada. Finding that the mother had died in childbirth, and the father on the western front, he was persuaded to adopt a ten-year-old daughter of the family, Anne-Marie (Anna or Sammy) le Guillon (1907-2007), whom he took back to New York and subsequently dispatched to boarding school. Mitchell-Hedges returned to England in 1919; then, after declining work with the intelligence service in Russia, he spent more than a year in the Central American republics before returning via New York on 24 December 1920. The precise reasons for this excursion remain uncertain, although ships' records give his occupation as 'merchant'. 
Until now Mitchell-Hedges had suffered mixed fortunes, and in July 1912 his stockbroking partnership, Pembery, Robinson & Co., had faced bankruptcy after an affair involving artificially depressed share prices. But in 1921, following a chance encounter at Waterloo Station, he entered a financially beneficial liaison with the wealthy deep-sea angler and self-styled explorer Lady Lilian Mabel Alice Richmond Brown (1885-1946), daughter of Robert Roussel of Guernsey and estranged wife of Sir Melville Richmond Brown, third baronet. The following year they sailed for Panama, fished together, and spent time with the Kuna people on the Rio Chucunaque. Back in England in March 1923 Mitchell-Hedges recalled their angling exploits in his first book, 'Battles with Giant Fish', while Richmond Brown, in 'Unknown Tribes, Uncharted Seas', offered an absurd and patronizing account of the allegedly uncontacted Kuna, a tribe known since the time of Columbus. A number of Kuna artefacts were donated to the Pitt Rivers Museum; then later that year, in the company of the artist and yachtsman Henry Scott Tuke (1858-1929), the couple sailed again for Central America, this time in search of vanished Mayan cities in the forests of Honduras. 
Returning to England with Richmond Brown on 25 May 1924, and now a minor celebrity, Mitchell-Hedges engaged a secretary, Gladys Harvey (Jane) Houlson ('b'. 1899), and later that year set out with Houlson and Richmond Brown for British Honduras. There they encountered the retired district medical officer and archaeologist Thomas William Francis Gann (1868-1938), who guided them to Lubaantun, a ninth-century Mayan city that Gann had first discovered in 1903. After returning on 20 September 1925, and in an article for the 'Illustrated London News' claiming the discovery for themselves, Mitchell-Hedges and his party were sent back to Lubaantun to conduct more extensive excavations under the auspices of the 'Daily Mail'. Their work resulted in the discovery of a stone-built amphitheatre, the first ever found on the American continent. It also prompted the British Museum to dispatch three annual expeditions, 1926-8, under the direction of the professional archaeologist and museum curator Thomas Athol Joyce (1878-1942). Mitchell-Hedges' party returned to England on 3 October 1926, soon after which he returned to Honduras to spend five years based at Roatan, sometimes with Houlson and Richmond Brown, angling and prospecting around the Islas de la Bahia, where he is reputed to have discovered pirate treasure and to have excavated twenty-one sites, recovering artefacts he was convinced came from the lost civilization of Atlantis. 
In 1931 Mitchell-Hedges was named as co-respondent when Richmond Brown was divorced in an action brought on behalf of her husband (whose affairs were under the control of a master in lunacy). Extensive financial resettlements followed, and from that date Mitchell-Hedges travelled almost exclusively in the company of his secretary, Houlson, commuting between New York and Central America in 1932-3 and 1933-4. On the second of these trips, from which he returned to Philadelphia on 17 May 1934, and the rest of his party on 28 September 1934, he was escorted by his adopted daughter, Anna. In 1934, on the death of his father, he returned briefly to England, and in the same year Anna went to Paris to train as a beautician and later manage a salon on the liner 'Normandie'. On 16 August 1934 Mitchell-Hedges arrived back in New York where he hosted a weekly radio show, aired on Sunday evenings, telling dramatic tales over a background of jungle drums. After a flirtatious affair with a Mrs Shepherd, a New York socialite, he apparently was married a second time, 'after securing a divorce in Mexico', to a gold-digger named Dorothy Copp. The marriage lasted only briefly and in 1938 Dorothy sued for divorce. 
Mitchell-Hedges returned to England to live at Coverack, Cornwall, and began a lucrative trade in antique silver that would support him comfortably for the rest of his life. During the Second World War he lived with Anna at Uplands and Burgate Manor, Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where he reputedly entertained prominent politicians and generals. In October 1943 he purchased at Sothebys for $400 a skull allegedly fashioned out of crystal that had previously fallen into the hands of the London art dealer Sydney Burney. The so-called 'crystal skull', which had first surfaced in London around 1933 and would in later years bring Mitchell-Hedges name to the fore, was claimed to have been carved by a lost pre-Columbian civilization and was said to possess mystic powers. Contemporary records point wholly against the claim by Anna le Guillon that the skull had been discovered at Lubaantun in 1924. It is now recognized that the skull is a modern forgery probably manufactured shortly before its appearance in London. 
In 1946 Mitchell-Hedges and Anna moved to Canterton Manor, Brook, Hampshire. Between 1948 and early 1950 they twice visited South Africa, apparently at the invitation of Field Marshal Jan Smuts. Mitchell-Hedges made several generous bequests from his collection of silver, and at St Lucia, a favourite scenic resort, Anna received (then on her second visit sold) a hotel and several surrounding properties. Passenger lists also confirm that Mitchell-Hedges' wife Lilian, now resident at Polperro, Cornwall, returned from South Africa in February 1952 and might have been a member of the party. In 1953 he, Lilian, and Anna moved to a substantial estate at Farley Hill, near Reading, Berkshire, where he penned his reminiscences 'Danger my Ally', then in 1958 he and Anna moved to Shaldon House, Shaldon, near Teignmouth in Devon. Mitchell-Hedges died at Shaldon House, of a stroke, on 12 June 1959 and was cremated at Torquay crematorium three days later. His ashes were scattered into the sea off Shaldon by his devoted Anna, to whom Mitchell-Hedges had previously signed over much of his fortune. Anna eventually migrated back to Canada, bought a motel in Kitchener, Ontario, and spoke widely of her experiences. She died in April 2007 at the age of a hundred. 
Although Mitchell-Hedges led a moderately interesting life as a stockbroker and entrepreneur turned angler and amateur archaeologist, his reputation as an explorer has been vastly exaggerated, largely as a result of the edifice of mystery erected around him by his less rational devotees. In fact, had it not been for his association with the crystal skull controversy, he might well have sunk into the obscurity that befell so many others of his genre. Careful analysis of ships' passenger lists and other reliable documents confirms that the basic framework of travels portrayed in his writings is essentially truthful, but his inclination to overstate the significance of his adventures, his eagerness to embrace the unorthodox, and his propensity for transforming pedestrian exploits into epics of survival and discovery have tended to compromise whatever genuine contribution he might have made to the field of exploration, archaeology, and natural history.

Vowell, Richard Longfield (1795-1870), army officer in South America and writer, was baptized at St James's Church, Bath, Somerset, on 24 July 1795, the only son in the family of six children of Richard Vowell (1746-1806) of Hallatrow, near Bath, and of co. Cork, and his wife, Ann Evans, 'nee' Hamilton (died 1807). His father, who had served as a major in the 66th regiment in the West Indies, sat in the Irish parliament as MP for Gorey (1783-90) and was surveyor general for Munster and a Cork county magistrate. Orphaned by the age of twelve, Vowell matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 17 May 1814, aged eighteen, and was elected a scholar in the following month. Some accounts have suggested that he abandoned his university studies in 1815 on inheriting some money, but college records show that on 11 December 1815 he was expelled. 
Vowell was, according to George Laval Chesterton, 'infected by a prevailing mania' and 'resolved to bear arms for the emancipation of Venezuela' (Chesterton, 140). He crossed the Atlantic aboard the ship 'Two Friends', arriving at the Danish colony of St Thomas in mid-1817. When the expedition broke up without leadership he joined a group seeking to reach Gregor MacGregor on Amelia Island. When this journey was also unsuccessful he set off to join Simon Bolivar on the mainland. His service in the independents' army was undistinguished during late 1817 and early 1818. Vowell noted that as he had no time to accustom himself to the new style of horse-riding in Venezuela, his mistakes and discomforts caused 'great disorder [in] the ranks and the undisguised merriment of the llaneros' (R. L. Vowell, 'Campaigns and Cruises', 1831, 61). At the battle of Semen (16 March 1818) Vowell was separated from his unit of free black soldiers, the Barloventos. He avoided capture by lying still among the many corpses (or, according to Chesterton, hiding in a bush) until the victors had left the field. He then wandered through Venezuela trying to rejoin Bolivar's army. These months of encounters with indigenous peoples and 'llaneros' (plainsmen) shaped Vowell's subsequent sympathetic accounts of South American daily life. His experiences on the llanos provided much of the material for the anecdotes, ethnographic descriptions, and eventual plots of his novels. He returned to the republican army, crossing the Andes and reaching Bogota in 1820. He continued in the Colombian army and navy throughout the 1820s, serving in Cali, Ecuador, Acapulco, and Baja California before spending the last years of the decade in Chile, at times serving under Lord Thomas Cochrane, including in the defeat of the final royalist garrison, at Chiloe in 1826. 
After independence from Spain was assured, Vowell left South America in November 1829 and arrived in Portsmouth in spring 1830. Unlike most of the other mercenaries who enlisted under Simon Bolivar, Vowell not only survived to tell his tales, but was equipped to do so with a sharp sense of observation and a fine literary style. He dedicated a year to writing up his travels, which were published anonymously in three volumes in London in 1831. The first volume, 'Campaigns and cruises in Venezuela and New Granada and in the Pacific Ocean, from 1817-1830, with the narrative of a march from the River Orinoco to San Buenaventura on the coast of Choco and sketches of the west coast of South America from the gulf of California to the archipelago of Chiloe', was part travel narrative, part chronicle. The second volume was a novel, 'The Earthquake of Caraccas', as was the third, 'The Savannas of Varinas'. Both novels are romances filled with heroic protagonists, thwarted love affairs, period detail, ethnographic digression, and references to the work of Sir Walter Scott. A French translation of the first volume was published in Paris in 1837. 'The Earthquake of Caraccas' told a love story against the backdrop of the warfare associated with the first Venezuelan republic (1810-13). 'The Savannas of Varinas' had similar themes, although the action had moved on to the late 1810s, and the setting was now the Venezuelan 'llanos' rather than the capital and coast, with regular cultural descriptions and picaresque episodes punctuating the central love story. 
The first Spanish translations of Vowell's works were published in Madrid in 1916. Since then the books have become recognized as among the most reliable and interesting chronicles of the wars of independence in Hispanic America, with new editions published in Spanish in the 1970s. Anonymous publication meant his identity remained a matter of debate among historians until the mid-twentieth century, and authorship of his works was sometimes attributed to Captain William D. Mahoney. Contemporaries also had trouble spelling Vowell's surname, a difficulty that is continued in many library catalogues (variously Vawell, Wovell, Vole, Biold, or Woule). His middle name is also sometimes mistakenly given as Longueville. 
Vowell wrote the preface to his three volumes of reflections on his adventures in Bath in 1831, and it has often been assumed that he died there in the late 1830s. It is now established, however, that he arrived in Sydney, New South Wales, as a convict in 1835, and that he died at Bruk Bruk, Casterton, Victoria, Australia, on 18 December 1870, and was buried in Old Casterton cemetery. What crime he had committed, and what he did between 1835 and 1870, remain obscure.

Mandeville, John Henry (1773-1861), diplomat, was born in Suffolk. After attending Dedham School he entered the navy, but later held a commission in the 1st light dragoons. On 16 September 1797 he married Mary Serle (died 'c'.1818), with whom he had a son, who predeceased him. For over twenty years, from 1801, he held unpaid posts as an attache in the diplomatic service: in the summer of 1801 he was commissary for prisoners of war in France, and was from 1802 to 1804 attached to the embassy at Paris, before moving to Vienna in 1804, Brussels in 1815, and Frankfurt in 1817. He became paid attache at Paris in 1824, and was appointed secretary to the embassy at Lisbon in 1828 and secretary at Constantinople, where from 1831 to 1833 he was minister plenipotentiary. He was 'considered by his superiors active, trustworthy, and intelligent' and has been seen as a 'typical workhorse' of the British diplomatic service (Jones, 19). 
In October 1835 Mandeville was named minister plenipotentiary at Buenos Aires, replacing Charles James Hamilton (1779-1856). He arrived there on 3 May 1836, and occupied an important role in diplomatic, political, and military affairs during his period of office, which coincided with the dictatorship of Juan Manuel de Rosas. In May 1839 he negotiated a treaty with Rosas's foreign minister, Felipe Arana, by which slave traders were to be regarded as pirates. He developed close relations with Rosas (despite the fact that the dictator treated him with a certain mockery) and his daughter, Manuelita, at whose soirees and entertainments he was a frequent visitor. A cultured man with an intriguing personality, physically small, bald, and with tiny, penetrating eyes, he was dashing in both his attire and his social life, a well-known figure in political circles, at the theatre, and in the social events of Buenos Aires, where he resided in the Parque Lezama district. While under no illusions about Rosas's despotism, Mandeville viewed him as pro-British, and committed to upholding the treaty of friendship signed in 1825. He also saw Rosas as an important source of stability in Argentina, British residents and property being vulnerable to any breakdown in order. Mandeville was criticized, however, for being too slow to condemn the killings of Rosas's political opponents, though he made formal protests to the Argentinian leader in 1840 and 1842. 
When British policy under the Conservative foreign secretary Lord Aberdeen became more hostile to Rosas, Mandeville was urged to develop closer relations with Uruguay, with whom in July 1839 he had concluded a treaty against the slave trade. In July 1842 he signed a treaty of friendship, trade, and navigation with the government of Fructuoso Rivera of Uruguay. He failed to halt the hostilities between Argentina and Uruguay, which led to Rosas's forces surrounding Montevideo, and an apparent promise by him of military aid in support of President Rivera was later repudiated by London. When, early in 1843, a British naval force under Commodore John Brett Purvis (1787-1857) intervened on the River Plate to prevent the bombardment of Montevideo, Mandeville opposed more aggressive actions against the Argentinian blockade, fearing repercussions for the British community in Buenos Aires. He was replaced in May 1845 by William Gore Ouseley, and retired on a pension in August 1845. 
Mandeville was a controversial figure. He was publicly criticized by British business interests in Montevideo for failing to support them in the face of Rosas's aggression, and for misleading them into believing that there would be military intervention. Privately, his successor, who opposed his policy towards Rosas, alleged that he had received favours from the dictator, and that the Mrs McDonald whom Mandeville presented at social occasions as his 'niece' was in fact a mistress, who occupied a house provided by Rosas (Ouseley to Aberdeen, 23 July 1845, Lynch, 377 n. 75). Jose Marmol's novel of the dictatorship, 'Amalia' (1851), depicted Mandeville as servile to Rosas. Yet there is no doubt that his complicated and often contradictory diplomatic role was highly beneficial to the British residents of Buenos Aires, who were a very privileged group during that period. In retirement he continued to work on the River Plate question and travelled to Paris, where he had an audience with King Louis Philippe and Guizot on 1 January 1847, when it was reported that he was preparing to travel to Buenos Aires to take charge of the peace talks with Rosas (this did not occur); in 1847 and 1848 he briefed Lord Howden and Henry Southern before they went as envoys to Buenos Aires. He died at his home, 11 Rutland Gate, London, on 16 March 1861.

Fraser, Patrick Allan- (1813-1890), artist and architect, was born at Arbroath, Forfarshire, the third and youngest son of Robert Allan, a stocking manufacturer, and his wife, Isabel Macdonald. Both his parents were from established trade families in the town. After education at Arbroath Academy, Allan eschewed his father's wish that he enter the legal practice of his uncle, John Macdonald, and declared that he would become an artist. He was promptly apprenticed to another uncle, Alexander Macdonald, a high-class painter and interior decorator. Encouraged by his uncle, Allan began to paint portraits of local figures and dignitaries in the area. On completing his apprenticeship Allan enrolled as a student at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh. Here he began a friendship with the painter Robert Scott Lauder, which continued when Allan joined Lauder at the British Academy of Art in Rome in 1836 to continue his studies. The contrast between the two artists soon began to show. Lauder, newly married and with greater financial responsibilities, did not have the freedom or ability to exploit the social opportunities provided by the city's expatriate community. While Lauder painted a number of portraits and worked on his epic painting 'The Trial of Effie Deans', Allan painted views of Rome to support himself and took advantage of the city's visitors and patrons, notably the naturalist Walter Trevelyan of Wallington, Northumberland, then resident with his wife, Paulina, for a three-year honeymoon. 
After returning to Britain in 1840, Allan set up a studio at 11 Seymour Street, Euston Square, London, and travelled frequently to Paris to study at the Louvre and to undertake a lucrative series of paintings for tourists and collectors. He also began to show his historical paintings -- largely depicting scenes from the novels of Sir Walter Scott -- in London and Edinburgh. It was during this period that the artist William Powell Frith encountered Allan in the Louvre. Writing of the meeting in his autobiography, Frith told of how he introduced Allan to his fellow students at the Royal Academy Schools, and invited him to become part of their recently formed sketching club, the Clique, then one of the country's first informal artists' groups. Through his participation with the Clique, Allan extended his contacts -- notably via the painter Augustus Egg -- with those proposing the creation of a philanthropic society for needy artists and writers, which led in 1850 to the founding of the Guild of Literature and Art by Charles Dickens and Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton. 
In 1841 Cadell, the Edinburgh publishers of Scott's 'Waverley' novels, offered Allan a text of his choice to illustrate for the planned deluxe edition of 1843. Allan chose 'The Antiquary' and, though the commission was not completed, he returned to Arbroath and to Hospitalfield House -- the model for Monkbarns, the home of Jonathan Oldbuck, the antiquary of the novel. It is not known whether Allan had previously met Elizabeth Fraser-Baker (1805-1873), heir to the Hospitalfield estate, but the development of a strong relationship resulted in their marriage on 13 September 1843 at Arbroath. Elizabeth had previously been married to Lieutenant Arthur Baker of the 3rd light dragoons, who had disappeared after failing to inherit the Fraser family estates, and who later died at Dover in mysterious circumstances. As a result of evident irregularities in the management of the Hospitalfield estate -- notably the erosion of shoreland following the removal of rocks for the construction of a railway track -- Allan sued for damages, settling out of court for several thousand pounds against the Dundee and Arbroath Railway Company; the company's secretary was John Macdonald, clerk to the Fraser family trustees and Allan's uncle. In 1851 Patrick added the name Fraser, by royal licence, and was known thereafter as Patrick Allan-Fraser; he also assumed the arms of the Frasers of Hospitalfield. 
After this hard-won beginning came the task of reviving the family's fortunes, which had fallen into neglect after the death of Elizabeth's father, Major John Fraser. Land was added to the Hospitalfield estate and new properties were acquired in Perthshire at Blackcraig (1847), Glenkilrie (1853), and Coldrach (1854). The poverty and living conditions in this area drew Allan-Fraser's attention to the possibility of land improvement and he attempted a sustainable economic model for the uplands consisting of small crofts or holdings interspersed by large areas of stone and heather moor. A programme of trenching, draining, and the creation of up to 20 miles of dykes converted 150 acres of land to arable farming and 200 acres to forest. The home estates of Hospitalfield and Kirkton were also extensively reworked and the county farmers were rallied to form an 'analytical association', of which Allan-Fraser was the first president, to research and report on the improvement of farm yields. 
Plans for remodelling the house at Hospitalfield began in 1849 and focused initially on the old barn (dating from 1325) which now became the picture gallery. Allan-Fraser intended the gallery to contain works personally commissioned from friends and acquaintances, including (in 1858) a series of self-portraits by former Clique painters -- among them Frith, Egg, John Phillip, Matthew Ward, Henry Nelson O'Neil, and Henry Lejeune -- as well as works by a younger generation of artists including John Pettie and John MacWhirter. Over the next four decades, and almost entirely with his own workforce, Allan-Fraser undertook a programme of building at Hospitalfield and Blackcraig Castle on his highland shooting estate at Strathardle. During this time he developed a system and approach to construction that prefigured the Scottish arts and crafts movement, especially in its use of local materials (notably gathered fieldstone for Blackcraig Castle and his own estate-quarried sandstone for Hospitalfield) and the involvement of craftsmen in the designs for wood and stone carving. A succession of wood carvers at Hospitalfield, beginning with John Hutchison (1833-1910), kept the trade alive between its mid-century decline and re-emergence with the revival of craft practices in the 1890s. The remodelling of the drawing room included David Maver's remarkable ceiling decoration (1883-8) which, comprising 197 highly detailed wood carvings set into a coffered cedar framework, provided an inventory of the estate's flora and fauna. The room itself was designed around two newly acquired arboreal Flemish tapestries that echoed Lovell's green room dream sequence in 'The Antiquary'. As a whole, Allan-Fraser's gradual reworking of Hospitalfield between 1850 and 1890 provides a survey of changing taste: from the heavier historical prototypes of Scott's romanticism to a freer, lighter expression of materials and imagery relating to the site's natural history. 
Alongside his redesigning of Hospitalfield, Allan-Fraser spoke publicly about his views on good and bad building practices. In his lecture 'Architecture, with special reference to local buildings' (summarized in the 'Building Chronicle', 4 May 1854) he identified 'usefulness' as the 'one great principle' of 'ancient' buildings and lamented its absence in such modern buildings as the Arbroath and Dundee infirmaries. With his emphasis on the need for function over style, and his awareness that form changes according to society's needs and technology develops to serve utility, Allan-Fraser provided an early formulation of the view -- subsequently proposed by pioneering modernists like Charles Rennie Mackintosh -- that structural function was central to a building's plan and design. Allan-Fraser's support for struggling artists also drew him to criticize perceived social inequalities, and other published lectures at Arbroath included a consideration of factors that 'retard the moral and intellectual progress of the working class'. In 1861 he published his voluminous 'An Unpopular View of Our Times, being the result of a free enquiry into the existing sources of demoralisation' -- a rambling survey of current values and a call for a return to 'individual obedience and individual responsibility'. He returned to this theme with 'Christianity and Churchism' (2nd edn, 1884) in which he denigrated formal religious worship and leadership as hypocritical and advocated a strict personal observance of the gospels as the guiding principle for a moral and healthy society. Despite these unorthodox opinions Allan-Fraser was not ignored by the artistic establishment. In 1871 he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy in recognition of his encouragement of the visual arts in Scotland. The Allan-Frasers also supported the training and career of the operatic tenor Durward Lely (1852-1944; born James Dorward Lyall), the son of Allan-Fraser's stonemason, who became a celebrity as Gilbert and Sullivan's leading tenor, and later the touring partner of the Spanish-born singer Adelina Patti. 
In 1853 the death of Allan-Fraser's mother-in-law had brought him further property in and around her family's residence at Hawkesbury Hall, Warwickshire. The burden of management fell heavily on Allan-Fraser who sought to spend more of his time on architectural projects. His attempt to donate Hawkesbury to the Guild of Literature and Art -- an idea encouraged by Augustus Egg from 1854 -- failed when Dickens refused to give assurances not to sell the house. Egg's contribution to the paintings for Hospitalfield by Clique members, 'Self Portrait as a Poor Author' (1858), depicted the artist's performance as the destitute author, David Fallen, in Bulwer-Lytton's play, 'Not So Bad as We Seem', which had first been performed in 1851 to raise funds for the guild. 
The death of his wife on 24 November 1873 led Allan-Fraser to plan and direct construction of the remarkable Fraser of Hospitalfield memorial chapel in Arbroath's western cemetery. Intended as a monument to his wife's family, and as a mausoleum, Allan-Fraser's neo-Gothic structure was gifted by him to Arbroath town council as a non-denominational mortuary chapel. Despite undertaking this celebrated work, Allan-Fraser was deeply affected by Elizabeth's death and his friends noticed a withdrawal from society. In 1874 he was elected president of the British Academy of Art in Rome, and set a new challenge of reviving the fortunes of the academy he had attended with Robert Scott Lauder in the 1830s. He remained president until his death, during which time he oversaw the academy's move to new, more practical, premises and provided a $3000 endowment for its security. Since 1869 Allan-Fraser had been planning his own institute at Hospitalfield for talented, impecunious young artists, and in 1873 he established a trust for 'the advancement of Art and the support and benefit of Professional men' (Hay, 1). In the following year Allan-Fraser persuaded the dying American sculptor William Rinehart to follow his example and establish a school for artists; this became the Rinehart School for Sculpture, now part of the Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore. 
On 13 October 1886, shortly after the completion of the memorial chapel, Allan-Fraser was honoured with the freedom of Arbroath. In failing health, and with no direct heirs from his marriage, he began to plan for his own art school, ordering casts to be sent from Rome, and making provision for the new studio building on his estate. Allan-Fraser died at Hospitalfield on 17 September 1890, and was interred beside his wife on 22 September. The Patrick Allan-Fraser of Hospitalfield Trust was activated on his death and continues into the twenty-first century at Hospitalfield House. Since 1890 it has played a major role in nurturing successive generations of Scottish visual artists, counting among its alumni members of national academies, lecturers, and teachers who have helped create the reputation of Scottish art that is enjoyed today, and for which the trust acts as an ambassador for an increasingly international programme.

Tutill, George (1817-1887), banner and regalia maker, was born on 16 April 1817 in Howden, Yorkshire, and baptized there on 19 April, the son of Thomas Tutill (1775/6-1860), corn miller, and his wife, Elizabeth Richardson (1789/90-1859), who is said to have been a regalia apron maker. He had at least one sister, Jane. Details of his early life are obscure; the family appears to have moved to Hunslet near Leeds before 1823. There is an apocryphal story that Tutill started out as a travelling showman, but there is no evidence to support it. He always claimed to have set up his business as a banner maker by 1837; on 28 June 1838 he married Emma Fairfield in Sculcoates, Yorkshire, giving his occupation as artist. By 1841 he was living in John Street, Tower Hamlets, London, with his wife, Emma, who died from tuberculosis later that year. 
Between 1846 and 1858 Tutill exhibited a number of landscape paintings in London, among them 'Scarborough Castle' at the Royal Academy in 1846, and five works at the British Institution, including 'Douglas Bay' (1850), 'Holy Island Castle' (1851), and 'Glengareff' (1852). Their whereabouts are unknown. It was, however, as an entrepreneur of banner and regalia making that Tutill made his reputation and fortune. By 1851 his principal occupation was 'banner supplyer', and by the end of the decade he had moved his business into purpose-built premises at 83 City Road, where it remained until the building was destroyed in the blitz in 1940. Tutill's business fed on the mid-Victorian delight in civic and community associations and public politics: friendly societies, trade unions, freemasons and Sunday schools all flourished in this period, and many of them went to Tutill's for their emblems, regalia, and banners. As befitted an entrepreneur in this age of empire, Tutill did not restrict his work to the British Isles: his firm produced banners for unions and friendly societies in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa, and took prizes in several colonial exhibitions. He toured Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in 1881. 
Tutill's banners were made of woven silk and painted in oils on both front and back. They bear evidence of connections to fairground art: brightly coloured silk backgrounds were highly embellished with golden scrollwork (either woven into the silk or painted on afterwards), ornate lettering on streamers imitated the ripple of the banner itself, and the central painted image was often supplemented by a series of inset cameos. Tuthill produced the banners from scratch, beginning with raw silk and weaving it to the required size (from the 1880s on a purpose-built Jacquard loom, which Tutill claimed was the largest in the world). Teams of specialist artists would then paint different aspects of the banner: portraitists, landscape artists, technical scene painters, and signwriters were all employed on a production line of popular art. Criticized both for their ostentatious gaudiness and for the uninspired academicism of the central images, the friendly society and trade union banners provide important visual evidence of the social and ideological development of working-class politics. The early nineteenth-century trade associations of elite craftsmen preferred iconography that drew on classical and biblical themes and emphasized the respectability and antecedents of labour, while from the late 1880s onwards the new mass unions of unskilled labour were represented by more overtly political and socialist images and slogans that emphasized future advances rather than past glories. The Tutill style dominated banner-making for over a century and was widely imitated; this causes some difficulties in dating banners. 
Tutill was from the 1840s active in the friendly society the Ancient Order of Foresters: he was the first district chief ranger of the City of London district, and was a long-serving member of court 'Industry' no. 1752. Despite the association of his firm with trade unions, he was not himself a union man, and it was not until 1934 that his workforce was unionized. 
Tutill's domestic life was unconventional; after the death of his first wife he formed a liaison with Elizabeth Allsop Bale, 'nee' Turner (1819/20-1884), the wife of Thomas Trout Bale, an eating-house keeper of Leadenhall Street who became insolvent in 1853, with whom she had two sons and two daughters; she was the daughter of Samuel Turner, wire drawer. The birth of her daughter with Tutill, Georgina Tutill Bale, was registered early in 1855; the child was living with her father in Islington in 1861. A son, George, was born in 1862 and died in 1864. By 1871 Tutill had moved out of central London to the Red House, Upton Lane, West Ham, Essex, where he lived with his 'wife', Elizabeth, their daughter, and three servants, although he did not in fact marry Elizabeth until 5 April 1878 (when she was described as 'widow' of fifty-eight years) shortly before the marriage of their daughter to Charles Henry Lewis, agent. 
The Red House, a large eighteenth-century building, stands as a visible symbol of Tutill's success. He had it substantially remodelled; over the door the motto 'There is much to be done' bears witness to the credo of a self-made man. He died there on 17 February 1887 and was buried in the churchyard of Howden Minster, Yorkshire; a memorial window was placed in the minster the following year. Among his goods sold at auction in 1888 were several suites of carved oak furniture, marble statuary, and two suits of armour. Tutill's business continued to grow after his death, and the firm maintained the fiction in its advertising literature that Tutill himself continued to run operations. It was in fact successively managed by Henry Storey, Georgina Tutill's second husband, and then her son Lewis, and continued to flourish throughout the twentieth century, surviving the move out of London during the Second World War, the destruction of its premises and comprehensive business records, and the decline of the banner and regalia industries: George Tutill Ltd continues as a manufacturer predominantly of flags. 
Few, if any, of the surviving Tutill banners date from the period before Tutill's own death. With dimensions of up to 12 feet by 11 feet, a Tutill banner could require eight men to carry it: two to carry each of the vertical poles and four more to hold the steadying guy-ropes. In 1861 Tutill patented a process for coating the centre of banners with india rubber to give additional flexibility and durability to the paintings. But although banners represented a significant investment for the organizations that commissioned them, they were essentially ephemeral and more easily destroyed than preserved. The major collection of Tutill's trade union banners and related material, made by John Gorman, is in the People's History Museum in Manchester.

Lorne, Tommy (1890-1935), music-hall entertainer and comedian, was born on 7 December 1890 at 8 Fleming Street in the Cowcaddens district of Glasgow, the youngest of the six children of John Corcoran (1852/3-1917), a mason's labourer, and his wife, Mary Ann Gallagher (1854/5-1908). His paternal and maternal grandparents were Irish migrants to Scotland, the Corcorans eventually settling in Kirkintilloch, an industrial town in east Dunbartonshire. Although his parents moved to Glasgow in the 1880s and he was identified as quintessentially a Glaswegian comedian, Lorne retained close family ties with Kirkintilloch and claimed to have made his first stage appearance there at the age of five. He subsequently developed as a child entertainer, performing with such ensembles as the Port Dundas Court Juvenile Minstrels, where he honed his singing and dancing skills. 
However, there was another side to the young Corcoran's talents. Academically gifted, his particular aptitude was for mathematics and science. During the early 1900s he became one of a select group of working-class Roman Catholic boys who won bursaries to St Aloysius' College, a Jesuit-run school in Glasgow with a strong teaching reputation. By producing a generation of professionals, academics and clergymen, St Aloysius' helped to shape the city's increasingly influential Catholic middle class. After he left school, about 1907, the St Aloysius' connection helped to secure his first full-time job as an apprentice chemist at the Steel Company of Scotland's Blochairn works in Glasgow. 
The industrial career did not last. Determined to continue with performing, Corcoran spent his spare time in the highly competitive world of music-hall amateur talent nights or as one of the variety 'turns' that interspersed cinematograph shows. His emerging stage persona owed much to his tall, gangling physique, and he worked especially well alongside the contrasting figure of an apparently nimbler foil. After several shortlived partnerships he teamed up with Billy Wallace, forming the double act Wallace and Lorne, comedians and dancers. Originally known as Tom Lorne, he adopted the more familiar Tommy during or immediately after military service, some time between 1917 and 1920. He was already a professional music-hall artist by the time of his marriage, on 10 November 1914, to Mary Frances Ellard ('b'. 1895/6), daughter of Christopher Ellard, tailor. The couple went on to have three children: John (Jackie), Richard, and Eileen. 
According to Lorne's own testimony Wallace and Lorne often played a gruelling six to twelve towns per week on the Scottish variety circuit ('The Era', 31 Oct 1925). Pantomime and revue offered more sustained performing opportunities and in 1915 the duo became associated with the productions of Harry McKelvie, manager (and later proprietor) of the Royal Princess's Theatre in Glasgow's Gorbals district. Possessing shrewd promotional abilities, McKelvie and his business partner Richard Waldon had become famous in the city for their lavish stage shows, aimed at working-class family audiences. McKelvie productions were distinctive as they absorbed elements from nineteenth-century 'Scotch drama', with emphasis on vernacular dialogue and ostentatiously tartanized set-pieces, including the ubiquitous kilted chorus girls. By 1915 the Princess's pantomime had become a local institution, running for a lengthy season of around twenty weeks. 
With their Glasgow roots, eccentric characterization, and knockabout humour, Wallace and Lorne fitted easily into the tradition. Their partnership ended some time after the winter of 1915-16, almost certainly because Wallace had joined the armed forces, leaving Lorne as a solo act, appearing the following season in another touring McKelvie pantomime, 'Tom the Piper'. His own term of military service commenced in 1917 when he joined the Royal Field Artillery and was stationed in India, along the north-west frontier. He continued to perform in army concert parties and later made the dubious claim of having been 'the first white comedian' to have played in Afghanistan ('The Era', 31 Oct 1925). 
After demobilization Lorne renewed his professional connection with McKelvie and was cast as one of the principal comedians in the 1920-21 Princess's pantomime, 'Peter Piper'. He was partnered with Bret Harte, a veteran entertainer who had achieved considerable success with his wife, Dora Lindsay, in a Glaswegian patter act. Harte's sense of timing made him the ideal feed for Lorne in their roles as impecunious but resourceful travelling showmen, and their rapport with the Gorbals audience meant that they soon became the pantomime's star attraction. Lorne established his professional reputation in three successive seasons at the Princess's, generating lucrative income for McKelvie along the way. His popularity confounded post-war predictions that a dual onslaught from Hollywood cinema and London musical comedy would kill the 'Scotch' pantomime tradition. In a review of 'Goody Two-Shoes', even the 'Glasgow Herald' (18 December 1922), a stoutly middle-class and conservative broadsheet, enthused that Lorne's 'long proportions, quaint mannerisms and inimitable dialect are gems in the rich setting of this pantomine'. 
The 1920s represented Lorne's golden decade. He acquired a London agent and became one of the most immediately recognizable comedians in Scotland. In addition to pantomime he toured in revue across the British Isles, playing up the 'Scotch' dimension in comically exaggerated highland dress, including over-sized Glengarry bonnet, short kilt and big brogues. In Scotland his catchphrases became common currency, especially the exasperated expletive 'in the name of the wee man!' or simply 'in the name...!' Lorne recognized his potential earning capacity early on and in 1923 broke with the notoriously tight-fisted McKelvie. During the 1923-4 season he starred in Harry Roxbury's production of 'Goody Two-Shoes' at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, impressing the 'Scotsman' reviewer with his 'quaint, queer and clever' characterization (29 Jan 1924). It was also at the King's that he played his first dame role in an opulent 1927-8 production of 'The Sleeping Beauty'. His feed was the Australian-born comedian W. S. (Billy) Percy, playing Muddles, the royal secretary, to Lorne's Queen Quibblina. The immediate bond between the two performers meant that their successful pantomime partnership endured until 1934. 
The King's was run by Howard and Wyndham, an Edinburgh-based theatre management company that also had an interest in the Theatre Royal, Glasgow. For the 1929-30 season the company's managing director, A. Stewart Cruickshank, took Lorne back to his performing roots in Cowcaddens, where the Royal was located. Compared to the Princess's its pantomimes had a classier, less earthy quality, but in 'The Sleeping Beauty' and subsequent Roxbury productions Lorne did not compromise his characterizations. He was soon breaking box-office records, and earning a huge weekly salary of more than $200. During the depressed years of the early 1930s the traditional pantomime themes of strength in adversity and the quest for good fortune had especial resonance for Scottish audiences, and Lorne's absurd but empathetic humour was regarded as an antidote to difficult times. 
Lorne's success also created personal problems. Some biographers have suggested that pressure of work led to excessive drinking, and there can be no doubt of eventual conflict with Cruickshank over Lorne's share of Howard and Wyndham's profits. In consequence Lorne acted as his own promoter and manager during the 1934-5 season and attracted large audiences to his touring production of 'Cinderella'. However, the physical effort of two shows a night, as well as financial responsibilities, caused his health to deteriorate. After 'Cinderella' he went straight into revue at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, but exhaustion soon obliged him to enter a nursing home in the city. He developed bronchio-pneumonia and died at 11 Ainslie Place, Edinburgh, on 17 April 1935. As obituaries reported, he had recently patched up his differences with Cruickshank, signing a contract to star in the 1935-6 pantomime at Glasgow's Theatre Royal. Both Cruickshank and McKelvie were pallbearers at an emotional funeral attended by some 3000 people at St Roch's Roman Catholic Church, Garngad, Glasgow. Lorne was buried alongside his parents at the Auld Aisle cemetery, Kirkintilloch. 
Countless tall tales have been circulated about Lorne, some of them self-generated, others embellished by journalists. For instance the legend persists that Lorne sausage -- a distinctively Scottish breakfast favourite -- was named in tribute to the comedian's catchphrase, 'Sausages is the boys!' (Shields). Because of the strength of Lorne's characterizations his identity as Hugh Corcoran faded into the background and numerous inconsistencies arose about his life in order that writers could match the man with his comic persona. Yet there can be no questioning the affection and respect he continues to inspire in Scotland, largely owing to his achievements in maintaining the integrity of popular 'Scotch' performance, especially the thriving genre of pantomime.

Bain, James Thompson (1860-1919), trade unionist in South Africa, was born at Dudhope Crescent, Dundee, on 6 March 1860, the third child of Andrew Bain and his wife, Eliza, 'nee' Thomson. His parents were both mill workers. At the age of seven he started work in a factory. At sixteen he joined the 13th (Prince Albert's) light infantry. After training he was sent, in 1878, to join the first battalion of the regiment, which was then the main unit enforcing the British occupation of the Transvaal. He saw combat in the campaign against Sekukuni in 1878 and the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. On returning to England he was reallocated to the second battalion of the 13th, then in India, and spent two years on garrison duty at Kamptee, near Nagpur. 
In 1883 Bain, now back in Scotland, was placed on the reserve, and at a relatively advanced age commenced his apprenticeship as a fitter. He was a voracious autodidact reader, and in this period developed a lifelong fascination with the writings of Thomas Carlyle. The young man was drawn into radical politics, becoming a member of the Scottish Land and Labour League, a group affiliated with William Morris's Socialist League. Bain heard Morris speak, and became a devotee of Morris's thought. 
In 1888-9 Bain worked as a fitter in South America, probably in Buenos Aires. By early 1890 he had moved to Cape Town, where he became active in local British immigrant trade unionism. There he met Charity Martha Hermina van der Riet ('nee' Bell), from Bredasdorp in the Cape. Following her divorce from her previous husband, they married and had three children -- Archibald ('b'. 1890/92), Olive ('b'. 1896), and James ('b'. 1906). 
After a brief stay in Kimberley the couple settled in Johannesburg, where Bain found work in his trade. In 1892 he was the central leader in the founding of the first significant trade union movement in the Transvaal, the Witwatersrand Mine Employees and Mechanics Union, also known as the Labour Union, which focused on organizing British, Australian, and North American immigrants. He developed a political position that combined fierce anti-capitalist hostility to the mine owners with a racist protectionism of the position of white workers against the competition of the cheap labour of people of colour. This was to be his characteristic viewpoint in his subsequent political career. 
The Transvaal was by now back under Boer rule. Bain developed a strong sympathy for the Afrikaners, whom he saw as defending a bucolic way of life against the rapacious capitalism of the mine owners. After internal disputes in the Labour Union and allegations of corruption against Bain, he pulled out of the movement. In 1896 his allegiance to the Boer cause led him to accept a position as a secret agent for the police of the Transvaal republic. He undertook some assignments gathering information on prostitution and drink rackets, but his main task was to spy on the pro-British organizations in the Johannesburg area. The year 1899 saw Bain emerge as editor of the 'Johannesburg Witness', a publication that managed to combine radical socialism with support for Paul Kruger's republic. The 'Witness' was clandestinely financed by the Transvaal government. Bain made an unsuccessful attempt to establish an International Independent Labour Party in Johannesburg, collaborating in this venture with Robert Noonan, later to become known as Robert Tressell, author of the socialist novel 'The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists', who was then resident in the Transvaal. 
When the South African War broke out in 1899 Bain decided to fight for the Boers. He joined the Irish brigade commanded by the American soldier J. Y. F. Blake and the Fenian John MacBride. Bain participated in the fighting in Natal. After the British captured Johannesburg in mid-1900 Bain was imprisoned in the city's fort and threatened with execution for treason. In the end he was sent to Ceylon, where he was held in the prisoner-of-war camp at Diyatalawa for two years. 
On returning to the Transvaal Bain worked at his trade, first in Johannesburg (1903-6), then in Pretoria (1906-9), and subsequently on the Cullinan diamond mine (1909-12). During this period he became something of an elder statesman to the growing immigrant labour movement in the Transvaal. He was active in the local branches of the British Amalgamated Society of Engineers, in the Transvaal Independent Labour Party (1906-9), and in the South African Labour Party (from 1909 onward). In 1907 he organized a march of the unemployed from Johannesburg to Pretoria. He played a part in hosting the visits of important British socialist leaders to South Africa, including those of James Keir Hardie, Tom Mann, and Dora Montefiore. He was influenced by the doctrines of syndicalism and contributed to the Johannesburg syndicalist paper the 'Voice of Labour'. At the first election for the Union of South Africa parliament Bain stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the South African Labour Party in the Pretoria North constituency. 
Charity Bain died in 1906 following the birth of James junior. In 1911 Bain married Nora Borrowman, a British immigrant. They had no children. 
Bain was chosen in April 1913 as full-time organizer for the Transvaal Industrial Federation. The next month a strike by white workers broke out in the mining town of Benoni. Bain not only took the leadership of the movement, but used it to generate a full-scale confrontation over wages and conditions between white labour and the mine owners' organization. Two months of fierce clashes between the police and strikers followed, and the strike spread along the East Rand. By the beginning of July Bain was able to force the calling of a general strike. On 4 July 1913, at a mass rally in central Johannesburg, after a speech by Bain, the strikers were charged by police and British troops. A night of arson and looting followed. On the next day the Royal Dragoons killed over twenty demonstrators in the city. Bain and his colleagues met the prime minister, Louis Botha, and the defence minister, Jan Smuts, in tense negotiations. The result was a triumph for the unions, with the government and the mine owners conceding virtually all the trade unionists' demands. 
In January 1914 a second strike broke out. But this one was ill prepared, and Smuts directed an operation aimed at extracting revenge for the humiliation inflicted on the government the year before. Martial law was declared and the newly formed Union Defence Force was deployed to enforce it. Bain and hundreds of others were arrested. Smuts then had Bain and eight other strike leaders deported to Britain. In doing so he acted without legal authority and had to claim retrospective indemnity from parliament. The South African government's action generated an enormous outcry in British trade-union and socialist circles. On arriving in London, Bain and his comrades found themselves heroes to the left. A major campaign on behalf of the deportees culminated on 1 March 1914 in Hyde Park in the largest single demonstration of the British left before the First World War. 
During the next few months Bain lived as a pensioner of British labour organizations. This limbo-like existence came to an end with the outbreak of the First World War. Botha had to allow the deportees to return to South Africa in order to gain the South African Labour Party's support for his war effort. 
Back in Johannesburg Bain found work at the power station. He joined the International Socialist League, a breakaway anti-war faction of the South African Labour Party. But Bain quickly fell out with S. P. Bunting, the proto-communist leader of the league. Ostracized by both the party and the league, Bain became isolated politically. He confined himself to working in the South African branches of the Workers' Educational Association and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. 
In March-April 1919 a strike by the power-station workers in Johannesburg developed into a general confrontation between the city employees and the authorities. Bain led the labour movement in the seizure of the Johannesburg municipal offices. They established a board of control for the city, chaired by Bain and ostensibly modelled on the Russian soviets. But after the city conceded most of the strikers' practical demands the movement fizzled out. Later that year, on 29 October 1919, Bain died in Johannesburg General Hospital following an operation. He was accorded a mass funeral by the local labour organizations, and was buried in Johannesburg on 1 November. 
Bain was loathed by his many enemies, foremost among them Jan Smuts, who told the South African parliament that signing an agreement with Bain was the hardest thing he had ever had to do in his public life, a humiliation and a disgrace. Allegations of financial corruption in the Labour Union hung over Bain for many years and in the 1890s he was notorious for his temper and violent inclinations. Yet after his return from the South African War Bain became revered and indeed loved by many of his comrades in the labour movement. He, more than any other single individual, can be regarded as the founder of trade unionism in southern Africa. The form in which he pursued it involved defence of the privileged position of white workers, but there is some slight evidence that towards the end of his life he started to become more sympathetic to the plight of black labour. And in 1914, for a brief and now forgotten moment, he was a national hero to the British left.

Love, Thomas George (1792/3-1845), journalist in Argentina, was born in January 1792 or 1793 in London, close to Hyde Park, which he later emphasized in repudiating a newspaper report that had referred to him as 'The Cockney' ('British Packet', 8 Dec 1838). He received a classical education and became a merchant's clerk in London; after travelling on the continent of Europe he was sent to Buenos Aires to manage a British firm's local agency. He arrived in October 1820, and in 1822 took charge of the British Commercial Room, founded as a business meeting place by the first British merchants to become established on the River Plate. In 1829 members of other nationalities were admitted to the renamed Buenos Aires Commercial Rooms (Sala Comercial de Buenos Ayres), which Love owned. 'A Five Years' Residence in Buenos Ayres', 'by an Englishman', published in London in 1825, is attributable to Love. The work, addressed to a British readership, vividly describes the customs of Buenos Aires, its institutions, culture, education, literature, and theatre. It was later translated into Spanish and is still the principal source of information for Argentinian life in the early years of independence. 
In 1826 Love founded an English weekly periodical, the 'British Packet and Argentine News', published in Buenos Aires on Saturdays from 4 August 1826 to 25 September 1858. As well as internal and political news, it contained a complete list of shipping news of the River Plate, and was the principal source of information for foreign residents. The newspaper was a mute witness to local politics until 1829, when the struggles between Unitarios (centralists) and Federales persuaded him to applaud the election as governor of Juan Manuel de Rosas (Federal). Along with many other Britons in Argentina, Love viewed Rosas as the only leader who would bring order to the country. This position was not shared either by the local Unitarios or by the British merchants of Montevideo, who criticized his actions and dubbed the 'British Packet' 'the official mouthpiece' of Rosas's dictatorship. Under the first French blockade of Buenos Aires (1838-40) the British merchants of Uruguay profited at the expense of their Buenos Aires counterparts and great rivalry arose between the two British groups. The rivalry was accentuated by the Argentinian siege of Montevideo (1843-51), initiated by Rosas and the Uruguayan Manuel Oribe, head of the Blanco party in their war against the Uruguayan President Rivera's Colorado party, supported by the Argentinian Unitarios exiled in Montevideo. In mid-1842 the Montevideo merchants founded their own periodical, the 'Britannia and Montevideo Reporter', to counteract the 'British Packet'; it accused Love of being a traitor to his country and a lackey of Rosas. Responding to their allegation that Rosas read every line of the 'British Packet' before it was published, Love answered that 'under the administration of Governor Rosas, never has an editor in any part of the world, been more unshackled than we have been' ('British Packet', 6 Aug 1842). 
Love wrote fiercely against the actions of Commodore John Purvis, commander of the British naval forces in the River Plate, who supported Rivera and the Unitario cause, and the British minister from 1845, William Gore Ouseley. Love's position was backed by the British community in Buenos Aires. In July 1845, when the rupture of relations between Argentina and Britain was imminent, he ridiculed the offer by the British squadron to transport British residents of Argentina to Montevideo as a place of safety, leaving behind the property they had built up over the previous three decades ('British Packet', 19 July 1845). He believed that Britain had begun an absurd, illegal, and unjust war ('O God! That our country should have joined in this most infamous bastardly crusade against its best friends'; ibid., 1 Nov 1845) and had violated the sovereign rights of Latin American countries, interfering in affairs that should have been resolved by Argentina and Uruguay alone. He was convinced that underlying these actions was the objective of enforcing the free navigation on the Parana and Uruguay rivers, and that the British and French were treating the Argentinian republic not as a member of 'the great family of nations' but as one of the 'mere vassals of the crowned heads of Europe' (ibid., 19 July 1845). 
Love died, of an unexpected illness, in Buenos Aires on 28 November 1845, during the Anglo-French blockade of the River Plate. An obituary referred to his ambition to strengthen the bonds between Britain and the Argentinian republic, and his tireless effort to impress upon the British government the duty, and expediency, of recognizing Argentinian rights of sovereignty and independence. He was involved in founding the principal British charitable, sporting, cultural, and religious institutions in Buenos Aires: 'Never was there a man so esteemed by the British residents of this country' (Mulhall, 578). A good-humoured man, as a writer 'his normal tone' was 'of humorous irony', enlivened by quotations from Virgil and Shakespeare. In physical appearance he was remarkable for having no hair, not even eyebrows. He was said to have adored the women of Buenos Aires, though with 'disinterestedness' (Groussac), and died a bachelor.

Malloch, Peter Duncan (1852-1921), fishing tackle maker and naturalist, was born in Almondbank in Methven parish, Perthshire, on 15 July 1852, the second son in the family of at least four sons and one daughter of Joseph Malloch (1820-1890), a beetler (bleach worker) in the bleachfields serving the linen industry for which Almondbank, Luncarty, and Perth were well known, and his wife, Margaret, 'nee' Duncan ('b'. 1826/7). He was raised for the first twelve years of his life in a cottage at Almondbank until the family moved about a mile upstream to a cottage even closer to the banks of the River Almond, a small but productive tributary of the River Tay. There he learned to fish for brown trout, sea trout, and salmon. By the age of ten he was making his own fishing tackle, an ability that was well served by his apprenticeship as a millwright at Huntingtower bleaching works. Such was his mechanical acumen that he was granted a journeyman's wages while still an apprentice. During this period his local reputation as an enthusiastic and resourceful angler, naturalist, and taxidermist became established. 
In 1872 Malloch and his younger brother James left the bleachworks and established a small taxidermy and fishing rod and tackle shop in Perth, where business grew so rapidly that he had to work day and night to satisfy demand. After only two years the business moved to larger premises on Perth's High Street and took on staff. On 24 December 1879 he married Jane Donaldson ('b'. 1855), a dressmaker and milliner, daughter of William Donaldson, general merchant. They had four sons and a daughter. 
By 1885 Malloch's achievements had been recognized in many fields. His fishing tackle business was flourishing, he had begun what was to become an unrivalled series of triumphs in the Loch Leven angling championships, and the large collection of Fisheries Exhibition medals that adorned his company stationery began in Norwich in 1881 and was repeated in Edinburgh, London, Bolton, and Paris. His knowledge and experience were applied not only to such items of tackle as fishing reels, rods, and lines (his patent spinning reel and Kingfisher lines were two of the most notable inventions) but also to larger freshwater engineering projects. In his extensive travels throughout Scotland he contributed to improvements like salmon ladders to enhance or create access to spawning grounds, and the construction and design of dams and weirs to create new lochs or improve river flow. Such was his authority that details of his innovations and statistics of his catches were regularly cited in the annual reports of the Fishery Board for Scotland, and he gave evidence as an expert witness in 1899 to the royal commission on Irish inland fisheries and in 1900 to the royal commission on salmon fisheries. He regretted the slow pace of legislation to protect salmon stocks. 
In 1898 Malloch expanded the firm into what became its best-known premises, at 24-28 Scott Street, Perth. At 7000 square feet it was the largest sporting establishment in the UK, boasting its own brass foundry and extensive workshops. The business benefited from an annual pilgrimage of sportsmen, their families, and their entourages, who followed the example of the royal family and took to the Scottish hills, rivers, and lochs in pursuit of fish and game. At the gateway of the railway network serving the Scottish highlands Perth made an ideal junction for breaking the journey and stocking up on all manner of sporting supplies -- a market that Malloch was to cater for in almost every respect. Malloch fishing tackle was also used to capture mahseer in India, trout in New Zealand, and ounaniche in Canada. Not only did he make and sell tackle and guns, but he also became a sporting agent through whom suitable fishing beats and sporting estates could be leased. 
In 1899 Malloch significantly extended his fishing and financial enterprises by becoming a founder and first managing director of the Tay Salmon Fisheries Company. This dynamic salmon netting concern very quickly bought out and rationalized the substantial and diverse netting interests on the River Tay and created a virtual monopoly. From the outset its avowed intention was not purely commercial, and it aimed to improve salmon stocks and assist rod fishing by managing and reducing the total net fishing effort. Although there were immediate successes in this regard, the Tay Salmon Fisheries Company's own commercial prowess brought it into longer-term conflict with the proprietors of rod fishing on the upper river. It took almost a century for the company to fully realize the founder's ambition of transforming the Tay into a river exclusively for anglers. 
Malloch's major contribution as a scientific naturalist was in understanding the habits of Salmonidae. His finely produced and richly photographically illustrated 'Life-History and Habits of the Salmon, Sea-Trout, Trout and other Freshwater Fish' (1910) was impressive when it appeared and remained a respected and sought-after work. It was one of the first generally available publications to properly describe the life cycle of salmon and was also the first widely available text to provide a detailed explanation of the significance of scale readings to the scientific study of fish. Its detailed and thorough exploration of the subject displays the author's rigour, combined with wide reading (he drew on Italian research of 1906 respecting the spawning grounds of the eel). He was able to refute many common fallacies, and firmly and correctly stated that 'bull trout' were none other than sea trout and in his second edition of 1912 that 'salmon bull trout' were in truth simply spawned salmon. Other areas of his expertise were natural flies and their better-known angling imitations. He was one of the first anglers known to have consistently linked his observations of natural insects on one day to the flies he tied for use on the next. His admired 'Fishing Gazette' articles on salmon fly dressing were based on his extensive studies (and were later published as a book in 1994). 
Highlights of Malloch's own angling career were the capture of twelve salmon on the River Earn that weighed an impressive 198 lb. His largest Tay salmon was an exceptional 45 lb fish from the Stobhall water. A day's fishing on Loch More in Sutherland with his son Gilbert saw them land a staggering 212 lb of trout. Over his lifetime he had claimed first prize in over 150 fishing and casting championships. 
Malloch was known for his quiet, forceful charm that gained him wide respect, while also being noted as 'a very clever and successful man of business' ('Fishing Gazette', 4 June 1921, 392). Photographic portraits suggest a handsome, well-groomed, bearded figure with an unmistakably intelligent and attractive countenance. He died at his home, Almond Villa, 81 Glasgow Road, Perth, on 22 May 1921, survived by his wife and five children. His legacy as perhaps Scotland's most accomplished and knowledgeable 'sportsman' from the period when the Victorian passion for Scotland and its field sports reached its pre-First World War zenith survives in the name of the firm he founded. His fishing tackle continues to be avidly collected, while his casts of large salmon display a beauty and craftsmanship that may never be rivalled.

Chatfield, Frederick (1801-1872), diplomatist, was born at 42 Welbeck Street, Marylebone, London, on 6 February 1801, the fourth and youngest surviving son in the family of five sons and one daughter of Allen Chatfield, an officer in the East India Company's maritime service, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Coggan (who was the subject of a portrait by John Opie). Little is known of Chatfield's personal life, particularly his early years. He appears to have been well educated, though the school he attended is unknown. In 1818 he was commissioned into the Life Guards, but gave this up after three years on account of the expense and instead purchased a lieutenant's commission in the 20th foot regiment. Writings in his later life reveal that he accumulated considerable personal debts in this period. 
Chatfield began his diplomatic career in 1826 as consul to the Baltic port of Memel. A cholera outbreak there, along with Chatfield's fortune of being in Aix-la-Chapelle during the Belgian crisis of 1830, brought the young consul's reports to the attention of the foreign secretary, Palmerston. He returned to Memel in 1831 during the Polish risings, and early in 1832 was made consul at Warsaw, where he was severely critical of Russian brutality. Having gone beyond his commercial remit, he was recalled from Warsaw in August 1832. He was a strong advocate of British interests and recommended an active policy -- he went so far as to suggest that Poland would be useful 'as a Colony to England' (Chatfield to Palmerston, 16 June 1832, cited in Rodriguez, 36). In March 1833 Palmerston named him consul to the United Provinces of Central America. Chatfield appears to have had no knowledge of Central America at this time, but spent the months before taking up his position studying the history of the region and learning Spanish. He arrived in British Honduras in May 1834 and Guatemala in the following month, becoming the most significant Briton in the region for the next two decades. Apart from a brief interregnum from 1840 to 1842 he remained Britain's chief representative in Central America until 1852. In 1849 he achieved the rank of charge d'affaires. 
British interests in Central America long predated Chatfield's arrival. A British settlement in Honduras had been established in the seventeenth century. From this toehold British adventurers, traders, and woodcutters expanded elsewhere in the region, occupying at times the island of Ruatan in the Bay of Honduras and establishing relations with the Miskito Indians on the Mosquito Coast (the Caribbean shore of present-day Nicaragua). 
Despite these established interests and the strategic importance of the region (an isthmian canal was already talked about in the early nineteenth century), Britain lacked a coherent policy in the years after the collapse of Spanish rule in Central America in 1821. Unlike the United States, which recognized the independence of the United Provinces of Central America in 1824, Britain never extended recognition to the Central American federation (and, indeed, would not recognize an individual state until Guatemala in 1849). British diplomacy lagged behind British commerce, which, from its base in British Honduras, quickly came to dominate the Central American market (this despite the fact that Britain had not negotiated a commercial agreement with the Central Americans, something achieved by the United States in 1825). 
More than any other individual Chatfield formulated and implemented a British policy towards Central America during the 1830s and 1840s. He sought to incorporate the region into the British empire. He promoted the activities of British traders and woodcutters, and encouraged investment and immigration from his home country. Only by bringing Central America into the orbit of the British empire, Chatfield maintained, could its economic growth and political stability be achieved. He also sought to expand British claims and protectorates over such strategically important territories as the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast. British entrepreneurs in the region, as well as the superintendent of the British settlement in Honduras, Alexander Macdonald, goaded Chatfield into pursuing ever more assertive and expansionist policies. 
If Chatfield's objective was consistent over time the same cannot be said of his tactics. Despite the legend to the contrary he advocated the union of Central American states in the 1830s, on the grounds that British interests would best be advanced through dealings with a single Central American partner. He went so far as to work alongside unionists to help draft financial legislation aimed at restoring the solvency of the government in 1837. When dissolution into several separate states became inevitable in 1839, however, he changed course and pursued a divide-and-rule strategy. By the 1840s he actively opposed Central American unionists, in large part because of their alignment with the United States. 
Chatfield increasingly advocated intervention in pursuit of British claims and interests. His dispatches to London included unsubtle attempts to commit the Foreign Office to territorial claims or naval actions he deemed in the national interest. He had no qualms about meddling in Central American politics, nor did he hesitate to invoke the Royal Navy in discussions with his Central American counterparts. He infuriated Central Americans by refusing to discuss territorial questions on the grounds that they involved interpretation of Anglo-Spanish agreements from the eighteenth century to which they were not party. His strong-arm tactics alienated many Central American statesmen and contributed to his failure to establish a regional network of collaborating elites. Britain's experience elsewhere in Latin America revealed the importance of forging lasting relationships with local elites. 
Chatfield's proclivity for liberally interpreting his instructions from London (if not disregarding them altogether) led the Foreign Office to rebuke him on several occasions. Aberdeen reminded Chatfield that he was to act 'not as an independent person, which you have done in too many instances, but as a subordinate and responsible agent' (Humphreys, 162). It was a message that even his erstwhile sponsor Palmerston would find necessary to send. Tension between an agent on the periphery and statesmen in London was not uncommon in the mid-nineteenth century. What is noteworthy, however, was Chatfield's success in steering the metropole towards a more assertive policy. By the late 1840s he had coaxed London into several expansionist actions: the enlargement of the borders of British Honduras, the occupation of Ruatan Island, and the establishment of a protectorate on the Mosquito Coast (the likely eastern terminus of an isthmian canal). Chatfield's indispensability to the Foreign Office is revealed by its refusal to recall him, despite several requests to do so from Central American governments. 
The final years of Chatfield's term as consul were marked by competition with the United States. The United States' annexation of Texas (1845) and conquest of northern Mexico (1846-8) increased American interests in establishing an isthmian passageway in Central America. Chatfield and his American rival, Ephraim Squier, engaged in a diplomatic duel for regional supremacy. The two raced to secure favourable treaties with Central American states, and battled for hearts and minds in Central American newspapers. But Chatfield over-reached himself in October 1849 when he responded to Honduras's potential transfer of Tigre Island to the United States by pre-emptively seizing it for Britain as compensation for outstanding claims. The Foreign Office repudiated this action, thus signalling its willingness to compromise with the new whig administration in the United States. The result was the 1850 Clayton-Bulwer treaty, in which both nations agreed to co-operate in the future construction of an isthmian canal and pledged not to 'occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume or exercise any dominion... [in] any part of Central America'. 
The Clayton-Bulwer treaty marked the beginning of the end for Chatfield, who had no interest in co-operating with his American rivals in Central America. His continued advocacy of assertive and expansionist policies led Granville, the foreign secretary, to recall him in January 1852. The Foreign Office soon retreated from the positions that Chatfield had advocated in the Bay Islands, the Mosquito Coast, and the port of San Juan del Norte (or Greytown). It was the Americans, not the British, who became predominant in the region in the coming decades. 
By the end of his time as consul Chatfield had become 'persona non grata' in Central America. As one San Salvador newspaper put it, 'there is an evil, horrible and interminable, there is a living curse which corrodes the vitals of Central America -- and this is Chatfield, the eternal Agent of England' (Rodriguez, 316-17). Central American politicians and commentators projected back this view of Chatfield, blaming him for the break-up of the union in the late 1830s. Squier continued the public relations campaign against his old adversary, publishing several books after Chatfield's departure that excoriated the English diplomat. So too did his reputation suffer in Britain. On his recall 'The Economist' (7 Feb 1852) labelled Chatfield a 'fifth class diplomatist'. 
Chatfield, who was unmarried, retired to Brighton, where his generous benefactions to local institutions earned him the nickname the Brighton Peabody. He died at his home, 3 Belgrave Terrace, Brighton, Sussex, on 30 September 1872, and was buried in the extramural cemetery, Brighton.

Chalmers, George (1857-1928), mining engineer in Brazil, was born at Flushing, Cornwall, on 17 January 1857, the youngest son of Captain John Chalmers (1810-1870), an army officer who had served in Jamaica before retiring to Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Goater (1820-1885). He was educated at Holy Trinity church school, Springfield, Essex, and then studied engineering at King's College, London, from 1875 to 1878. He worked for Harvey & Co. in Cornwall, principally in mining operations, from 1879 to 1882, when he joined the Brentford Gas Company. On 30 September 1883 he married Augusta Maria (1860-1885), the daughter of Richard Frederick Tyacke, vicar of Uny Lelant, Cornwall. 
In 1884 Chalmers became superintendent of the Morro Velho gold mine owned by the St John d'el Rey Mining Co. Ltd in Nova Lima, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Located some 435 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, the Morro Velho ('old hill') mine had probably been worked since the early eighteenth century. It had been purchased by British investors in London in 1834, and over the next fifty years yielded prodigious quantities of gold and employed what may have been the largest slave force in Brazil at the time (1500 slaves), enabling the St John d'el Rey company to pay out annual dividends of around $25,000 to stockholders from the 1830s to the 1880s. In November 1886, not long after Chalmers's arrival, the mine collapsed killing dozens of miners (British and Brazilian). He drew up comprehensive plans to dig a new mine alongside the old and build a completely new and modern refining facility. He then persuaded the management to raise the capital to carry out his plans and reopen the mine. Over the next decade he led the rebuilding of the mine and by 1901 the new operation was again paying regular dividends averaging around 7 per cent annually to stockholders. By the 1930s the mine reached a depth of 2453 metres, making it the deepest mine in the world until the 1950s. 
Under Chalmers St John d'el Rey became the largest foreign enterprise in early twentieth-century Brazil. In addition to gold mining operations he bought up iron deposits in Minas Gerais and experimented with the production of steel. Beginning in the 1890s he built a series of hydroelectric plants to power mining operations and to provide lighting in Nova Lima. He also experimented with the production of aluminium, alcohol-powered vehicles, and the planting of tracts of eucalyptus trees to supply wood and charcoal for the mine. By the late 1920s the company's revenues ($500,000) were equal to about one-fifth of the total revenues of the state government. The St John company was easily the single largest taxpayer in Minas Gerais, where Chalmers formed friendships with many of the most powerful politicians and businessmen. With more than 5000 workers among the 15,000 inhabitants of Nova Lima, the company was also the state's largest employer. Nearly all the company management was British, as were the mining captains and department heads. The British community in Nova Lima numbered several hundreds, and had its own Anglican church, cemetery, priest, school, hospital, club, and football team. 
In 1924 Chalmers stepped down as superintendent and was given the title of general manager of the mine. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. On the death of his mother in 1885 he and his two elder brothers, John and William, shared an inheritance of nearly $40,000 that together with other family inheritances made him an independently wealthy man. An avid hunter and fisherman, he bought a private estate (Jaguara) to which he frequently retreated by the 1920s. Following the death of his first wife from tuberculosis soon after they arrived in Brazil, he married her elder sister, Eleanor Josephine Tyacke (1857-1900), despite a Church of England prohibition against marriage to a deceased wife's sister; the ceremony was conducted by a Methodist pastor in Rio de Janeiro in 1886 over the objections of her father. He had two sons with his second wife, the elder of whom, Alexander George North Chalmers (1887-1960), succeeded him as superintendent of the Morro Velho mine. Shortly after returning to England for medical treatment he died of heart failure on 4 February 1928 in a London nursing home. He was cremated at Golders Green.

Gilmour, James (1843-1891), missionary, was born at Cathkin in the parish of Carmunnock, to the south-east of Glasgow, on 12 June 1843, the third of six sons of James Gilmour (died 1888), a wright and joiner who made a comfortable income, and his wife, Elizabeth, 'nee' Pettigrew (died 1884). The family was Congregationalist and on Sundays walked into Glasgow to attend church, bypassing churches of other denominations on the way. Gilmour was educated at Bushyhill subscription school in Cambuslang, followed by Gorbals youth school, Glasgow, and Glasgow high school, after which in 1862 he began attending classes at Glasgow University, where he gained distinctions in Latin and Greek. At Glasgow, as he later recorded, he underwent a conversion experience and entered the theological hall of the Congregational Church in Edinburgh. While there he applied to the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1867 and was accepted as a missionary and sent to Cheshunt College, the LMS training institution for prospective missionaries, where he studied until 1869, when he moved to Highgate seminary. 
Gilmour was assigned by the LMS to reopen the Mongolian mission, possibly having been recommended by Hannah Swan (1809-1890), the widow of William Swan (1791-1866), who had accompanied Edward Stallybrass on the first LMS mission to the Buryat Mongols of Siberia from 1817 until its suppression in 1840 by the Russian authorities. Gilmour's initial response to such a remote mission among lamaist Buddhists was at first unenthusiastic, and he undertook it as a duty rather than a call. Shortly after his ordination at Augustine Church, Edinburgh, on 10 February 1870, he departed for China, where the second Mongolian mission (no longer welcome in Russia) was to be based. In May 1870 he arrived in Peking (Beijing), where he joined John Dudgeon MD and Joseph Edkins. A month after his arrival the Tientsin (Tianjin) massacre occurred and he used the anticipated French military intervention as an excuse to depart for Mongolia, despite the fact that his instructions from the LMS called for him to live at least three years in Peking learning Chinese and Mongolian. His first journey, travelling in the company of a Russian merchant, took him to Kiakhta on the Russian border, where he lived in the yurt of a lama who taught him Mongolian. He also met some people who had known the earlier LMS missionaries, whose graves at Selenginsk he visited. After returning to Peking in November 1871 he embarked in April 1872 on a tour of the Mongols of the agricultural regions to the north-east. On his return he decided to concentrate his evangelizing efforts on the nomads of the plains, on the grounds that their tents were open to strangers, allowing a missionary to mix freely with them. 
The major problem throughout Gilmour's career was, however, that neither the Mongols nor the Russians wanted him to stay in Mongolia, though he was welcome as a traveller. During his missionary career of over two decades he used Peking as his permanent post and made almost annual trips into Mongolia, beyond Kalgan on the border with China, where he travelled mainly by camel, finding shelter in tents or the poorest inns, and surviving on a meagre diet, while going for long periods without meeting other Westerners. He also adopted Mongolian dress. In later years he travelled with a blue tent, which he pitched near Buddhist temples, handing out medicine while preaching. The isolation and lack of results bore on him: early in his mission he reported to the LMS board: 'I have got 'the Blues' and that badly' (10 Nov 1873, Lodwick, 155). In 1874 he admitted that he had not converted any Mongol to Christianity, nor had he ever met one who was even remotely interested in the subject. 
Mongolian custom required that anyone approaching a yurt at sundown be given accommodation for the night, so Gilmour achieved entry into Mongolian homes from his first day on the steppes. A sharp observer, he developed a keen eye for customs and was able to write about them in a mostly non-judgemental manner. In one instance he described the kindness of a Mongolian woman who had provided him breakfast, fetched and helped him to load his camel, gave him more tea, then held off the semi-wild dogs while he mounted the camel and departed at dawn, and observed that she was at least as civilized as some who thought they lived in civilized countries. He contributed articles for the Shanghai-based 'Chinese Recorder', the protestant periodical that documented the mission movement from 1867 to 1941. Many of his articles, written under the pseudonym Hoinos (meaning 'from the north' or 'from the rear'), were about lamas, marriage customs, prisons, the purchase of camels, and similar matters. 
Gilmour had gone to China as a single man, but was soon in correspondence with the sister of the wife of his colleague Samuel Evans Meech (1845-1937), a fellow student at Cheshunt, who had wanted to join the Mongolian mission but was assigned to Peking. The correspondence with Emily Prankard (1853-1885) resulted in her accepting Gilmour's proposal of marriage. Their wedding took place on 8 December 1874, a week after her arrival at Shanghai. They settled into life at the LMS compound in Peking, where she began language lessons, and accompanied him on his journey to Mongolia in 1876, though the communal nature of tent life created difficulties. Their first son, James, was born in April 1877, delaying their departure for Mongolia that year until June. Two more sons were born: William in 1879 and Alexander in 1884. On their third journey, in 1879, their experience of being caught in a windstorm for four days was so disturbing to his wife that they returned to Peking and decided that in future she would not travel in Mongolia. 
Despite the hardships he had undergone Gilmour had still failed to make a single Mongol convert by the spring of 1882, when he and his family left for home, in their only furlough together in Britain. While they were there, in April 1883 the Religious Tract Society published 'Among the Mongols', based on his articles. It was an immediate success, well reviewed, his solitary life among the Mongols being compared to 'Robinson Crusoe'. After returning to China in September 1883 with heightened spiritual earnestness he adopted an extremely ascetic regime, travelling on foot and on occasions carrying his bedding during a journey into Mongolia in 1884. The depression that he suffered from, which afflicted other members of his family, intensified as a result of long periods of isolation and uneasy relations with his missionary colleagues at Peking, who regarded Mongolia as an unproductive field and who dissented from his uncompromising view that church members should abstain from alcohol and tobacco. Following the death of his wife, on 19 September 1885, he embarked on a twenty-five-day trip to the plains, where his failure to make converts caused him further disappointment. Early in 1886 he settled in Dazhengxu, where there were agricultural Mongols living with Chinese. In this area he baptized two Chinese, but in reporting this to London admitted he thought they would give up the religion as soon as he left the area. His depression was worsened in 1886-7, after his two older sons were sent back to England for their schooling, and during that time he came into contact with a vegetarian sect, the Tsai Li Ti, and tried vegetarianism himself. His youngest son died in Peking in December 1887. The breaking-point came when his long-hoped-for colleague, a medical doctor, was diverted to Tianjin to replace one of Gilmour's best friends who had died suddenly. The news resulted in Gilmour's mental collapse and in March 1889 he was sent home to Britain, staying at the family home in Hamilton. 
Soon pronouncing himself cured, Gilmour set sail for China in January 1890, and embarked on another journey to Mongolia in March. In the spring of 1891 he travelled to Tientsin for the annual meeting of the LMS Peking and Tientsin district committee, became ill with typhus, and died there on 21 May 1891. His funeral in Tientsin took place on 23 May. In 1899 a granite monument was erected in Hamilton in memory of him, his wife and youngest son, and his eldest son (who died in 1898). 
Gilmour succeeded David Livingstone in LMS periodicals as the missionary icon who laboured in an extremely remote and difficult field with no converts to show for his efforts. His solitary and self-denying toil was made the subject of hagiographical biographies intended for Sunday schools as an example to boys. If he viewed himself as a failure as a missionary he certainly was not as an observer of Mongolia. 'Among the Mongols', reckoned 'one of the best books ever written on Mongolia' (Bawden, 1), became the classic work on Mongolian life in the late nineteenth century, and had numerous reprintings into the twenty-first century, as well as being translated into Japanese, Mongolian, Russian, Swedish, and Turkish.

Lewsham, Amelia (b. c.1748, d. in or after 1798), white negress, was born in Jamaica about 1748 to a black couple from whom she inherited a recessive gene causing albinism. She was described as being 'as fair as the fairest among the Europeans' ('The White Negro Girl'), although her features were those of her parents, of west African origin. Her mother was a house slave of Sir Simon Clarke, sixth baronet, who lived in Spanish Town. In 1753 Clarke sent her to England, to his son Kingsmill Clarke of the Inner Temple. He sold Amelia to John Bennett or Burnet, who kept a bird and beast shop off St Martin's Lane in London. Kingsmill Clarke asked for 400 guineas, although Amelia was probably bought for less. Amelia 'had the Honour to be shewn to the Royal Family, and to the Royal Society' (ibid.), as well as to ordinary people prepared to pay 1 shilling. She also toured the country and on 17 April 1766 was baptized in St Lawrence's, Exeter, Devon, under the name Amelia Harlequin. She believed, like many black people, that baptism made her free and at this point she left John Burnet to exhibit herself. 
About this time Amelia married a Mr Lewsham or Newsham; she had at least six children with him. Shortly after Olaudah Equiano's return to London in 1777 he 'saw a remarkable circumstance... A white negro woman, that I had formerly seen in London and other parts, had married a white man, by whom she had three boys' (Equiano, 220). He probably saw Amelia and her children at Bartholomew fair, held annually at Smithfield on the northern edge of the City of London. She also attracted the attention of medical men and in 1788 the surgeon John Hunter commissioned a painter, probably Johann Zoffany, to do a portrait of what appears to be Amelia, her husband, and two of their children. 
The last sighting of Amelia came on 1 May 1798, when she was taken before a justice of the peace in West Ham, Essex, because her appearance there the night before had caused a public disturbance. She was travelling and exhibiting herself with a man named James Briggs and her illegitimate son Christopher, born in Bristol and then about eight years old, which suggests that her husband was dead or the two had separated. The JP found that no law had been broken and sent the three on their way. What happened to her, or to any of her children, is not yet known. 
For a 'curiosity', Amelia's career was relatively long. Whether she kept on exhibiting herself because she needed the money or because she enjoyed the attention is not known. Though to later generations it came to be seen as distasteful to display or gawk at physical peculiarities, it was not so in the eighteenth century. Amelia was described as a 'wonderful Phaenomenon of Nature' ('The White Negro Girl'). She and others like her were not regarded with revulsion or embarrassed pity, but as wonders and marvels. Moreover the alternative for Amelia was not appealing: had she not been born with albinism she would most likely have spent a much shorter life as a slave in Jamaica. Indeed her career perhaps helped her to live longer than she would have done had she remained in the tropics, where her lack of melanin would have made her vulnerable to skin cancer.

Hazlitt, John (1767-1837), miniature and portrait painter, was born on 13 May 1767 at Marshfield, Gloucestershire, the eldest son of the Revd William Hazlitt (1737-1820), Unitarian minister, originally from Shronell, co. Tipperary, and his wife, Grace, 'nee' Loftus (1746-1837), daughter of Thomas and Grace Loftus. Hazlitt's father was a bold and controversial minister and religious writer who played a prominent role in the development of Unitarian theology in England, Ireland, and America in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
Hazlitt's first three years were spent in Marshfield, before the family moved to Maidstone, Kent, where his father served as Presbyterian minister in the town for the next ten years. Here, two of Hazlitt's siblings were born: Margaret (1770-1841) and William Hazlitt (1778-1830), the celebrated writer and essayist. In 1780 the Hazlitts moved to Bandon, co. Cork, at what was a troubled time for the family. John's father sought to alleviate the suffering of American prisoners of war who were held at Kinsale prison, but, in doing so, he incurred the displeasure of officers at a nearby British military garrison. Following death threats the family left Ireland for America in 1783. They sailed from Cove on 3 April, arriving in New York harbour on 26 May. They spent the next three years in America and it was here that John Hazlitt's career as a miniature and portrait painter began. 
A self-taught artist, Hazlitt began painting portraits in the early 1780s. His time in America was very much a coming of age, both personally and professionally, and he quickly gained a reputation as a talented portraitist. In spring 1785, aged seventeen, he advertised to open a drawing school with the English-born miniature painter Joseph Dunkerley (died 1806), with the school to be run from Dunkerley's house in North Square, Boston. However, in June Hazlitt advertised that he intended to paint portraits in Salem, Massachusetts. Over the next two years he executed miniature, pastel, and oil pictures in Salem, Weymouth, Dorchester, and Hingham. He painted portraits of prominent figures including the scientist John Winthrop, the Congregational ministers Ebenezer Gay and William Bentley, the revolutionary army officers Benjamin Lincoln and Nathan Rice, and the physician Dr Joshua Barker. He is also known to have painted a picture of two wild turkeys for the Boston merchant Samuel Vaughan. 
Though Hazlitt worked in America primarily as a portrait painter, he appears to have supplemented his income with interior decorative painting and may also have gained commissions for architectural studies. He has been credited with the high-quality ornamented panelling, depicting English landscape scenes, from two houses in Hingham, Massachusetts, owned by the Thaxter family. Other works -- now owned by the Hingham Historical Society -- include raised decorative panels for the home of the loyalist Elisha Leavitt. In 1900 the Wampatuck Club, Canton, purchased seventeen decorated panels, thought to be the work of Hazlitt, which now cover the club's chimney wall. 
By 1786 the finances of the elder William Hazlitt were depleted and it became clear that permanent residence in America was no longer possible. Aged nineteen, John Hazlitt returned to England with his mother and siblings in autumn 1786 and his father followed them a few months later. In 1787 the family settled in Wem, Shropshire, but John remained in London to develop his career as an artist. As John's great-nephew William Carew Hazlitt later noted, 'His progress and success in his calling as a miniaturist must have been extraordinary' (Hazlitt, 1.211). His work was informed by Jonathan Richardson's writings on the theory of art. In 1788, at the Royal Academy, Hazlitt exhibited four miniatures after paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He exhibited work at the academy each year from 1788 to 1819, apparently attracting warm praise from Reynolds. Hazlitt's success enabled him to rent a studio at 288 High Holborn, before moving to 12 Rathbone Place. On 16 May 1789, at St Anne's, Soho, he married Mary Pierce (1768-1846) of Portsea, Hampshire, the daughter of Thomas and Dorothy Pierce, and a descendant of James Pierce, who was dissenting minister at Exeter between 1715 and 1726. The couple had three children, Harriet (1802-1882), Mary (1805-1876), and William (1810-1885). The Hazlitts were lifelong friends of Charles and Mary Lamb and, according to the latter, Mary Hazlitt suffered from John's behaviour during the marriage. In November 1809 Mary Lamb wrote that Hazlitt 'has been very disorderly lately', recounting that he had returned from the alehouse with one Mr Brown: 'a gentleman he had hired as a madkeeper to take care of him at forty pounds a year... It was with great difficulty, and by threatening to call the aid of the watchman & constables that she [Mary Hazlitt] could prevail on Mr Brown to leave the house. (Marrs, 3.31)' Concerns about Hazlitt's alcoholism persisted throughout his life. 
None the less Hazlitt's artistic career proved lucrative. In 1804 he moved his studio to more fashionable quarters at 109 Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, where he advertised portraits at 7 guineas each. Five years later he earned 54 guineas in Rochester, Kent, and he is said to have been offered the position of miniature painter to Tsar Alexander I, though he declined because of his distaste for despotic government. Hazlitt had been connected to London's radical political circles since the early 1790s. He was a close friend of William Godwin, Thomas Holcroft, and John Thelwall, among other leading reformers. His portrait of Thelwall ('c'.1800-1805; NPG), depicts the Jacobin orator as intellectual and calm, and thus at odds with his portrayal by political loyalists (Poole, 6). In November 1794 Hazlitt and his wife celebrated the acquittal of Thomas Hardy, founding member of the London Corresponding Society, following charges of treason. In the same month Hazlitt was mentioned during the trial of John Horne Tooke when a meeting of the Society for Constitutional Information at the Crown and Anchor tavern, held on 29 June 1792, came under legal scrutiny. At the meeting Hazlitt was reported to have received hundreds of copies of Thomas Paine's 'A Letter to Secretary Dundas' for distribution. Though Hazlitt remained close to his brother William throughout his life, his influence on the development of William's career -- in artistic and radical political circles -- was particularly marked in the opening years of this decade. 
In addition to Thelwall, Hazlitt's sitters included his brother William (two undated studies; Maidstone Museum and Bentlif Art Gallery), Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Clarkson (undated; Colchester and Ipswich museums), Edward Jenner, Charles Kemble, Joseph Lancaster ('c'.1818; NPG), Theophilus Lindsay, and Arthur Young, He also continued to produce landscape, biblical, and historical paintings following his return from America. In February 1806 Charles Lamb lamented that Hazlitt was at work on a large painting of the Virgin Mary with child, modelled on his wife and six-month-old daughter Mary: 'He is a clever man... But he will go on painting things he ought not to paint, & not painting things he ought to paint' (Marrs, 2.208). William Carew Hazlitt also noted that his great-uncle once undertook 'a recumbent Aphrodite on an unprecedentedly large canvas' (Hazlitt, 1.215). 
By 1815 Hazlitt's fortunes appear to have been on the wane. In the autumn of that year he applied for an associateship at the Royal Academy, but failed to receive a single vote. That he was also advertising for sitters in newspapers suggests he was struggling to find commissions. Little is known of his later career: in 1824 he moved to a cottage just outside Exeter, presumably to be closer to his sister Margaret and his mother, who lived at Crediton. He finally settled in Stockport, Lancashire, in May 1832 to be near the Carlingfords, a prominent family who had known Hazlitt from a previous provincial tour. He continued to paint in his final years, executing a number of portraits for patrons in Stockport. Though Hazlitt's date of death is unknown, he was buried on 16 May 1837 in St Mary's, Stockport. He was survived by his wife, who died at Newport, Isle of Wight, on 28 April 1846.

Fletcher, Christian, Lady Abercrombie (1619/20-1691), royalist heroine, was born in Kinneff, Kincardineshire. About 1642 she married James Granger or Grainger (1603/4-1663), presbyterian minister of Kinneff church since 1640. He had graduated MA from the University of St Andrews and had been a preacher in Montrose. Their children were John, Robert, and James, and the family lived in the manse at Kinneff. 
Christian Fletcher achieved fame for helping prevent the honours of Scotland (the crown, sceptre, and sword of state) from falling into the hands of Cromwellian forces. The honours were used at the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1651, but could not be returned thereafter to Edinburgh Castle which had fallen to Cromwellian forces. In June 1651 the honours were ordered to Dunnottar, a castle owned by the Keith family, earls Marischal, on the coast of Kincardineshire near Stonehaven. Katherine Drummond (daughter of Patrick Smith of Braco, wife first of John Cowan of Tailourtown and second of David Drummond, minister of Moneydie) carried the honours there, hidden in sacks of wool, through territory occupied by Cromwellian forces. She was never rewarded for this heroic feat. 
By September 1651 it was only a matter of time before Dunnottar's small garrison surrendered. A plan to spirit away the honours and the king's papers was hatched with the involvement of Mary Erskine, dowager Countess Marischal; Elizabeth Douglas, wife of George Ogilvie of Barras, governor of the castle; and Christian Fletcher. Ogilvie and James Granger might also have been involved. Douglas's kinswoman and 'dependant', Anne Lindsay (daughter of Alexander Lindsay of Cuichbirnes, in the parish of Logie Buchan, and later wife of John Willcox, minister of Kemnay) walked out of the castle with the papers sewn into her belt, taking them safely through enemy lines -- a further act of female heroism that went unrewarded. In her 'informatione' to the Scottish privy council in 1664 Fletcher claimed to have visited the castle three times to remove the honours. In February 1652 Elizabeth Douglas gave her the crown and sceptre, which she brought away on horseback, riding always close to the cliffs, having resolved to throw the honours into the sea rather than let them fall into English hands. In March 1652 she went on foot with a servant, who took away the sword in a sack of hards (coarse flax tow) on her back. Later in March 1652 she removed the sword case in a sack of cods (pillows). Barron considers her account to have been 'written in a conscious spirit of self-advertisement' ('In defence', 20) and instead favours the story, recounted by William Meston, tutor in the Marischal family in the eighteenth century, that the crown and sceptre, and perhaps also the sword, were lowered from the castle to Fletcher's servant girl, who waited on the beach below and took them away hidden in a creel of 'Dulse and Tangles' seaweed (ibid., 165). This version is plausible, though influenced by Barron's distaste for Fletcher on account of her later sexual conduct, and it still names Fletcher as having been involved in planning the scheme, providing a servant, and receiving the smuggled honours. The name of Fletcher's servant girl, whom both versions agree to have been active in the enterprise, is not known, and her heroism was never rewarded. 
However they came to have the honours, it is agreed that Fletcher and her husband buried them in Kinneff church by night and in secret. Dunnottar surrendered on 24 May 1652 and the Cromwellians were angry to find the honours gone when they took the castle two days later. A story put out by the Countess Marischal that her son, John Keith, had removed them to the continent threw the English off the scent and the hunt was discontinued. The honours remained at Kinneff church and every three months Fletcher and Granger disinterred them by night, aired them, and reburied them in fresh cloths. They surrendered them after protracted negotiations on 8 October 1660. The Countess Marischal secured money and titles for her son by falsely insisting that the story of his having smuggled them to the continent was true. Ogilvy secured a lesser reward by claiming the main role in saving the honours, and a bitter feud broke out between the families over their claims, all of which minimized the role of Fletcher, Granger, and the servant. An act of the Scottish parliament of January 1661 recognized that Fletcher had been 'most active' in conveying the honours to safety and then preserving them from the 'English usurpers', and awarded her a sum of 2000 merks Scots. The money was, however, never paid. 
James Granger died just before 20 May 1663. On 18 October 1663, at Kinneff, Christian Fletcher married James Sandilands, first Lord Abercrombie ('b'. before 1627, died after 1667), a dissolute spendthrift whose first marriage to Jean Licton had ended in divorce in March 1663. A daughter, Margaret, was baptized on 27 February 1664, just four months after the wedding. In January 1664 Abercrombie granted Fletcher a life-rent charter of the estate of Largie. Nothing is known of Fletcher's later life. She died in February 1691, aged seventy-one. 
Interest in Fletcher grew after the rediscovery by Walter Scott on 4 February 1818 of the honours, which had lain forgotten in Edinburgh Castle since 1707. Scott mentioned Fletcher's and Granger's role in saving them in several publications and this led to the repetition of the story in numerous Scottish guidebooks, accounts of antiquities, and histories. In a letter of 7 February 1818 Scott referred to the tradition that Fletcher and Granger had been tortured by the boots, but rightly considered this to have been improbable. The story of the saving of the regalia appealed to Scottish painters: Alexander Chisholm's painting 'The Minister of Kinneff and his Wife Concealing in the Church the Scottish Regalia' was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1846, and David Wilkie produced three studies for a painting of the burial of the honours (NG Scot., 1835/6; Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow; priv. coll.), but it is thought that he never executed the work. Fletcher's bravery and patriotism were cited in 1912 by Lady Agnes and Sir Robert Baden-Powell as an example to Girl Guides ('Handbook', 410-11). An investigation by J. P. Campbell (2007) provides useful biographical detail and is far more sympathetic to Fletcher than was Barron, whose work, however, remains the standard source. 
In the rebuilt church at Kinneff (now the old kirk) Victorian monuments honour James Granger (the allusion to his enjoyment of heavenly reward draws attention to the fact that he had none on earth), as well as Ogilvie and his wife, but not Fletcher. In Dunnottar Castle an inscription over a fireplace commemorates the role of Ogilvie, his wife, and Anne Lindsay in saving the honours. Following their rediscovery, the honours have been on show at Edinburgh Castle since 1819. Ironically they were never again used in a coronation ceremony, though the crown was displayed at the inaugural sitting of the Scottish parliament in 1999, the opening of the Scottish parliament building in 2004, and at ceremonies marking new parliamentary sessions. Though her precise role in events is disputed, Fletcher epitomizes the fact that women took most of the risks in saving the honours while men took most of the glory.

Adams, Carol (1948-2007), educationist, was born on 28 July 1948 at Hackney Hospital, London, the daughter of (James) Gordon Adams, wine merchant, and his wife, Daisy Ellen, 'nee' Matthews. At the time of her birth registration her parents lived at 103 Glyn Road, Hackney. She grew up in working-class east London at the height of the 'Windrush' era, and saw first-hand the influence and impact that a multi-ethnic London, rich with immigrants, would have during the next decades. She won a scholarship and was educated at Christ's Hospital Girls' School, Hertford, a school founded in 1552 to provide a first-class education for disadvantaged children, and it was there that the roots of her enduring commitment to an education system open to and fit for all began to grow. 
Adams read history at Warwick University in the 1960s and during this decade of counterculture and revolution she began to explore issues of equality, particularly within the feminist movement. She spent time at the University of California at Berkeley during the peak of the civil rights movement and then returned to London to obtain a postgraduate certificate of education at the Institute of Education. She started teaching history in 1970 at a number of inner London state secondary schools before a stint as the Tower of London's education officer. She then managed the inner London education authority's history and social sciences centre, which ignited her lifelong passion for the promotion of professional development opportunities for all teachers. During this early period of her career she began to write and publish books, including 'The Gender Trap' (with Rae Lauriekietis, three volumes, 1976) and 'Ordinary Lives: a Hundred Years Ago' (1982), along with numerous teaching and in-service training materials focusing on equal opportunities within the school setting and gender issues. Meanwhile, on 26 March 1978, at Hendon Reform Synagogue, she married Richard Louis Noss ('b'. 1950), schoolteacher, and son of Michael John Noss, company director. They had two children, Joseph (Joe) and Amy. The marriage ended in divorce and he remarried, but she and Richard Noss remained lifelong friends. 
The next stepping stone for Adams was to become a chief inspector for equal opportunities for the inner London education authority in 1983 and concurrently to study for an MA in human rights at the Institute of Education, awarded in 1984. From 1965 until its abolition in 1990 the education authority for the twelve inner London boroughs promoted and celebrated not just history, but feminist history, to all teachers in Greater London, in over 1000 schools. (Adams had already contributed to the burgeoning literature on women's history as co-editor of Cambridge University Press's 'Women in History' series, and as a member of the editorial advisory board of Virago, the feminist publishing company.) When the authority was abolished in 1990 she was sought out to become the London borough of Haringey's assistant chief education officer and later the director of education in Wolverhampton. These roles next led her to Shropshire in 1994, where she became the first female chief education officer in England. 
In 1997, after Labour's election victory, Adams joined a task force to explore the establishment of an independent professional body for teachers in England. When the General Teaching Council for England was established by the 'Teaching and Higher Education Act' of 1998 she took the helm as chief executive to set up what would become a globally recognized model of self-regulation and registration for over half a million qualified teachers in England. She worked alongside Lord Puttnam (first chair of the council) as well as a broad coalition from across the education landscape in the UK to create an organization that would benefit the teaching profession. After its launch in September 2000 she and the organization faced criticism from teachers who felt they had not been properly consulted or briefed (despite an extensive consultation period with the public as well as the teaching unions and other bodies). Undaunted, she shouldered much of the criticism and worked indefatigably to reassure teachers around the country that the council was in their best professional interest, and would work both with and for them. 
Never afraid to speak her mind, or to swim upstream against public opinion, Adams brought her determination to make evidence count in educational policy-making to Whitehall, and fought tirelessly to ensure that all children experienced a high quality of learning. She believed that education was the key to life chances and always worked to promote a high standard of achievement by all pupils. Her ability to bring the reality and expertise of the classroom to the corridors of Whitehall and Westminster contributed greatly to the influence and impact of the council's advice relating to professional development opportunities and entitlements for teachers. 
Adams made sure that she did not get 'lost' in the bureaucracy of her role by visiting schools and education settings around the country on a regular basis, even when it meant catching the milk train to start her day. When one letter-writer to the 'Times Educational Supplement' proclaimed the General Teaching Council for England a 'government poodle' (23 April 2004), she responded by marching into a meeting with education ministers wearing a pink T-shirt emblazoned with a poodle. Critical of many of the previous government's policies, she was not afraid to tell the Labour government to resist further changes to school grant-maintained status because it distracted governing bodies from more important preoccupations, such as literacy and numeracy. The fearless advocacy of equality and diversity and opposition to bigotry and prejudice of her early days as an adviser was continued in her role of commissioner for the Commission for Racial Equality, a non-departmental public body that aimed to combat racial discrimination and promote racial equality. 
A keen follower of jazz, Adams played the clarinet and saxophone and retained a love of nineteenth-century industrial history along with swimming and travelling. Fearless and forthright, she fought against cancer privately for several years and finally lost her battle on 11 January 2007, a month after retiring as chief executive of the General Teaching Council. Her dedication to the teaching profession was recognized in small part through the council's sponsorship of the Carol Adams memorial award for excellence in professional development, equalities and diversity. She was survived by her children.

Bracewell, Dame Joyanne Winifred (1934-2007), judge, was born on 5 July 1934 at 5 Orville Drive, Burnage, Manchester, daughter of John William Bracewell, cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Lilian, 'nee' Gibson. By the time of her birth the family was comfortably off, her father having worked his way up from humble origins to become director of a cotton manufacturing company. She was educated privately and became a talented child actor, appearing in a number of 'Children's Hour' productions of E. Nesbitt's plays and also in two films produced by Film Studios Manchester in 1948, 'Cup-tie Honeymoon', starring Sandy Powell, and 'Holidays with Pay', starring Frank Randle and Tessa O'Shea. No doubt this experience contributed to the beautiful voice and outstandingly clear diction that she later deployed in court. 
Bracewell studied law at the University of Manchester, from which she graduated LLB in 1954 and LLM in 1956. She was one of the law faculty's star students of the early 1950s (her achievements were later recognized with an LLD degree in 1991). Perhaps it was her early acting career that drew her to a career at the bar. This was still an inhospitable place for a woman, despite the pioneering example of Rose Heilbron, with whom she had brains, beauty, courage, and determination in common. She was called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1955, did pupillage with Godfrey Heilpern (later leader of the northern circuit) from 1955 to 1956, and became a tenant in his chambers, then at 60 King Street in Manchester. Women were not then allowed to attend the bar mess dinners, where men were elected to the circuit, and were elected at the 'business court' instead. By dint of ability and sheer hard work, she built up a strong common law practice. It is reputed that such was her dedication to work that one day, unusually, she asked her colleagues whether her undefended divorce cases could be taken ahead of theirs because she was getting married that day. True or not, it was certainly in character. She married Roy Copeland, a 34-year-old textile merchant (son of Jack Copeland, also a textile merchant), on 12 September 1963, at Manchester register office. They adopted a son in 1965 and a daughter in 1967. 
After her marriage and the arrival of her children Bracewell continued her career without interruption. She was an inspiration to the women who followed her to the Manchester bar, including Brenda Hale in 1969 and Janet Smith in 1972. She took silk in 1978 and became head of her chambers, masterminding the move to their own premises at 28 St John Street. She was appointed a recorder in 1975 and a circuit judge on the northern circuit in 1983, transferring to the western circuit in 1986. She and Roy bought a large and beautiful house and garden in Somerset, which they ran as a guest house. Roy was also a talented jazz musician, playing both saxophone and clarinet, and their hospitality both in Manchester and in Somerset was legendary. 
Bracewell's 'big break' came with the passing of the 'Children Act' 1989. The lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, recruited her to help with the implementation of the act and to act as its ambassador in winning over the 'hearts and minds' of those who would have to make it work on the ground. She was a great success. In 1990 she was rightly rewarded with promotion to the High Court (and the accompanying appointment of DBE), only the fifth woman (after Elizabeth Lane, Rose Heilbron, Margaret Booth, and Elizabeth Butler-Sloss) to hold that office. She was also family division liaison judge for London from 1990 to 1997 and chaired the Children Act Advisory Committee from 1993 to 1997. She was responsible for the invaluable 'Annual Report' and 'Handbook of Best Practice in Children Act Cases' (1997). She was consulting editor of 'Family Court Practice' and of 'Butterworth's Family Law Service'. 
In court Bracewell was known for her 'air of quiet authority, a measured approach, great courtesy of manner, and an almost superhuman power to maintain those qualities when faced with difficult or emotional litigants, or insensitivity on the part of any advocate who appeared before her' (Potter, memorial address). She was a tough judge, expecting the same high standards of others -- be they local authorities in their child protection work or parents in the care of their children -- as she expected of herself. She hit the headlines in 2004 with an open-court judgment transferring children from the care of their mother to their father because the mother had obstructed their contact with him. She took an even stronger line when she transferred the care of two children born to a lesbian couple from their birth mother to their other mother, because of the birth mother's attempts to deny the importance of the children's relationship with their other mother and her son. (Unusually, in that case the law lords thought she had been too tough.) She supported proposals for early intervention, to nip such problems in the bud before they escalated into a court dispute, and also for more flexible and constructive approaches to enforcing contact orders once made, which were implemented in the 'Children and Adoption Act' 2006. 
Tough she may have been, but Joyanne Bracewell was also friendly and approachable, enjoying the company of other family lawyers at Family Law Bar Association conferences (where she would label herself Joyanne rather than Mrs Justice Bracewell). She was unfailingly cheerful and optimistic, continuing to work for as long as she possibly could during her final illness. This she faced with typical courage -- the same courage with which she faced a frustrated litigant who threatened the Court of Appeal with a (convincing replica) gun. She and her fellow judges then had the unusual experience of giving evidence at the Old Bailey, where she had also sat as a judge. She died of breast cancer on 9 January 2007 at St Margaret's Hospice, Yeovil, Somerset, and was survived by her husband, Roy, and their two children. A celebration of her life was held at Gray's Inn Hall, London, on 19 March 2007.

Cockfield, (Francis) Arthur, Baron Cockfield (1916-2007), businessman, politician, and international civil servant, was born on 28 September 1916 at 26 Devonshire Road, Horsham, Sussex, the second son of Charles Francis Cockfield (1890-1916) and his wife, Louisa, 'nee' James (1890-1974). He never knew his father, a second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery, who had been killed in action at the battle of the Somme on 27 August 1916. He was educated at Dover grammar school and subsequently at the London School of Economics, where he read law and economics and graduated both LLB and BSc (Econ). 
In 1938 Cockfield embarked on a career in the Inland Revenue while also studying law (he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1942). At the outbreak of the Second World War most of the administration of the Inland Revenue was evacuated to Wales, but Cockfield had the good fortune to find himself part of a relatively small, central staff that remained in London, where his formidable intelligence and energies found rapid and widespread recognition. By 1945 he was already an assistant secretary and director of statistics, and in 1951 he was appointed a commissioner of Inland Revenue at the astonishingly early age of thirty-five. Meanwhile, on 23 July 1943, at the King's Chapel of St John the Baptist, Savoy, London, he had married Ruth Helen Simonis (1914-1998), daughter of Henry Solomon Simonis, academic lawyer. They had a daughter, Hilary Ann ('b'. 1944), and a son, Roger Edmund ('b'. 1947). The marriage ended in divorce in the early 1960s, a profound rift with his family which remained total until his death. 
Despite his rapid rise to the upper ranks of the Inland Revenue, Cockfield soon began to feel frustration at the slow pace of public administration and the political constraints on the Whitehall machine. Along with an increasing number of senior mandarins, he decided to follow the lure of a more challenging and risky life in the commercial world. In 1953 he left the Inland Revenue and moved to the Boots Pure Drug Company, initially as its finance director (1953-61) and then, as managing director and chairman of the executive management committee (1961-7), presiding over a steady expansion of its retail, manufacturing, and international export businesses. 
Even while micro-managing Boots, Cockfield still nurtured his interest in the functioning of the economy at large, for instance chairing a study, for the Royal Institute of Public Administration, of potential new sources of local revenue -- which, interestingly, came down firmly against the idea of a poll tax as regressive and likely to be massively unpopular. He also served on Selwyn Lloyd's National Economic Development Council from 1962 to 1964. Within a short time of the Conservative government's defeat in 1964 he became intimately involved in the party's rethinking of its economic policies, working closely as economic adviser to the shadow chancellor, Iain Macleod, on the development of a taxation strategy in preparation for a return to government. From 1968 to 1969 he was president of the Royal Statistical Society and in 1970 he married his second wife, (Aileen) Monica Mudie, 'nee' Blurton (1919-1992), a choreographer. There were no children of this second marriage. 
When Macleod died in 1970 within days of becoming chancellor of the exchequer in the new Conservative government under Edward Heath, Cockfield was both personally and professionally bereft, but he continued to serve as adviser to Macleod's successor, Anthony Barber, for whom he devised a radical tax credit system. In 1973 he received a knighthood. In March of that year, as inflation reached well into double figures and industrial relations became increasingly polarized, the Heath government set up a pay board and a price commission in an attempt to bring wage and price inflation under control. Cockfield was appointed chairman of the price commission. Although a profound believer in the free market, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to making sense of the job with the intellectual rigour and meticulous attention to detail that were already his hallmark. Such was his zeal in holding back price rises that he felt able to claim before the end of the first year that he had already saved the shopper $320 million. 
When the new Labour government came to power in 1974 it promptly abolished the pay board but retained the price commission. It was a tribute to his manifestly fair-minded and balanced approach to competition that Cockfield, though openly a staunch Conservative, was retained in post by the incoming secretary of state, Shirley Williams. For three more years he continued to use his remorselessly penetrating analytical powers to corner companies into cutting back or even abandoning their proposed price increases as inflation peaked at 25 per cent in 1975 and then began to fall back. In July 1977 he left the price commission to return full-time to his role as an adviser to the Conservative Party, playing a leading part in the work of its economic reconstruction group under Geoffrey Howe, planning the party's economic strategy and policies on public expenditure and reform of the tax system. He was made a life peer in 1978, as Baron Cockfield. 
When the Conservatives returned to power in 1979, Cockfield became minister of state at the Treasury, in charge of the Inland Revenue and a strong influence behind the tax-reforming budgets that followed. In 1982 he was promoted to the cabinet, being sworn of the privy council and becoming secretary of state for trade. When, only a year later, the Department of Trade was once again merged with Industry after the general election of June 1983, he became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Freed from departmental responsibilities and with a seat in the cabinet and most key cabinet committees, he earned himself few friends over the next fifteen months as he frequently and fearlessly ambushed his colleagues' proposals over a wide policy front. 
The most important turning point in Cockfield's professional life came in the summer of 1984, with the decision of the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, to send him to Brussels as the senior British member (at that point Britain chose two European commissioners, by convention one Conservative and one Labour) and vice-president of the new European Commission which was to take office in January 1985. He resigned as chancellor of the duchy and absented himself from the House of Lords in order to devote himself entirely to preparing for Brussels. He was in many ways an unexpected choice for the job, having taken very little interest in European Community matters until then, but by the time he arrived in Brussels (asking warily whether it was safe to drink the water) he had read the treaty of Rome from cover to cover three times -- he would later often tartly remark that some of his colleagues had clearly never even read it once -- and had briefed himself exhaustively on every conceivable area of community activity. His predecessors also advised him to learn French, as the all-important language of the Brussels corridors; he tried, but soon gave up, so that when a visiting minister once asked if he might speak French, Cockfield replied 'By all means. ['pause'] But I shan't understand a word you say' (personal knowledge). 
To appreciate the scale of what was to turn out to be Cockfield's crowning achievement, it is important to recall the extent to which the process of European integration had slowed to a snail's pace in the preceding years, reflecting economic stagnation, sluggish progress on enlargement, and above all the stalling power of the United Kingdom government in pursuit of its claims for a rebate on its contributions to the community budget. That and other thorny issues had at last been resolved at the Fontainebleau European council in June 1984. The new president of the commission, Jacques Delors, who had been one of the main players, as French finance minister, in reaching agreement on the British budget refund, was determined to make a fresh start and to use his presidency to restore momentum to the community's development. Even before the new commission took up office, Delors and Cockfield had agreed that completing the internal market was the biggest single area of community business left unfinished. It was also the objective most likely to be supported by most member governments -- not least by the United Kingdom -- and by the overwhelming majority of the commercial and industrial community. 
Delors and Cockfield shared the analysis that, for the economies of Europe to compete successfully with those of the United States and Japan, all the obstacles that prevented them from functioning as a single market needed systematically to be removed. With characteristic ambition and thoroughness, and with total confidence in his own ability to hold all the parts together, Cockfield not only successfully claimed the internal market portfolio for himself but persuaded Delors that it should be significantly enlarged to include company and indirect taxation, financial institutions and the customs union, many of the manufacturing industries with the strongest interest in a single market (such as food, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, wholesale and retail distribution, textiles, and the construction industry), and the implications for the internal market of all other policies. That such a raid on the traditional definition of portfolios should have been achieved without the bloodletting usually associated with incoming commissions was a measure of Delors's ability to persuade his colleagues to accept from the outset the primacy and the scale of ambition of the single market project as the flagship of his term of office. It also suited Cockfield's personality, giving him the autonomy to master and resolve for himself the dossier's many inherent complex and intractable policy conflicts, which would have tested his limited skills in handling people had they involved trying to reconcile his own and his colleagues' interests. Not that he was afraid of confrontation: he positively relished it in the council of ministers and, if necessary, even within the commission itself, where only the very brave dared to cross him -- and often regretted it. Members of his team soon learned that, faced with an impasse at their own level, the suggestion that 'maybe your commissioner had better discuss it with mine' could yield capitulation within minutes (personal knowledge). 
Within days of taking office Delors and Cockfield set the commission a deadline of June and the next European council summit in Milan to produce a white paper outlining a comprehensive plan for completing the internal market. Cockfield called on the whole commission to draw up an inventory of all the measures that would be needed to remove all the barriers that prevented member states from functioning as a single market. Within weeks hundreds of pieces of legislation had been identified, some of them already on the negotiating table, some lurking in desk drawers waiting for the commission to have the courage to put them forward, many others still to be conceived and drafted. As word spread that the internal market was the bandwagon to climb aboard, long-neglected drafts were dusted off and put forward as vital to the cause. In response Cockfield was ruthless in repelling all boarders who were not absolutely needed on the voyage, and the programme finally settled at a formidable 300 measures. 
With a programme of such immense scope, Cockfield's study of community history had taught him that the council's tendency would be to back the easy winners and leave the rest to lag behind or fall by the wayside altogether. He, however, stuck uncompromisingly to the insight that, for the physical, technical, and fiscal barriers to the free market to be abolished, every single pretext for their continued existence had to go. With the rigorous logic of the super-bureaucrat that he was, and certain that it had to be all or nothing, he therefore built in a detailed timetable, with deadlines measure by measure, monitored by annual progress reports, reinforced by periodic high-profile strategic reviews in 1988, 1990, and 1992, and, most importantly, committed to an overall political deadline of the end of 1992 for completion of the entire project. (1992 would mark the end of two commission terms of office and, at that time, Cockfield, who was in Thatcher's good books, could expect to be reappointed to see the programme through.) 
By early June 1985 Cockfield and his team had the whole programme sewn up. His fellow commissioners were bowled over by the sheer magnitude and audacity of the plan, whose unanswerably detailed logic they were all able to follow without interpretation as Cockfield laid it out before them in his slow, lugubrious drone. By the end of June the commission had bounced the Milan European council into committing itself to 'a precise programme of action based on the White Paper... with a view to achieving completely and effectively the conditions for a single market in the Community by 1992 at the latest in accordance with... a binding timetable', and to convening the intergovernmental conference that would give birth the following year to the 'Single European Act', the change in the rules (introducing qualified majority voting in the council for a wide variety of measures) needed to make the target credible and legally binding. 
Alongside the widespread applause from all quarters for the ambition of the project, there was no shortage of voices asserting that it simply could not be done. This was a red rag to a bull, and for the next three and a half years Cockfield ploughed doggedly on with his programme, determined to prove the Jeremiahs wrong, harrying his own troops to keep to the timetable, facing down the member states in the council of ministers, and roundly denouncing faint-heartedness, foot-dragging, or outright obstruction wherever he sniffed it out. Inevitably he particularly relished tearing strips off British ministers and, though this undoubtedly boosted his credibility with his colleagues in Brussels and the other capitals of Europe, it was eventually to cost him his job. 
As far as Cockfield's lifeline to London was concerned, the rot had, in fact, set in almost from the start. Thatcher had first taken issue with Cockfield as early as the publication of the white paper itself, over what she saw as his unwelcome 'invention' of the need for tax harmonization. His own account of the clash recorded: '
Myself: It was in the Treaty of Rome. 

The PM: It was not. 

Myself: It was. 

The PM: It was not. 

Myself: It was. 



This unproductive conversation was brought to an end by the Private Secretary being sent to find a copy of the Treaty of Rome. I asked him to read out Article 99, which reads as follows: 'The Commission shall present proposals for the harmonisation of indirect taxes...' This was greeted in complete silence. I was to learn over the years that silence was always the Prime Minister's response when in difficulties. But thinking, as I then did, that it was possible to penetrate this iron defence, I said:Myself: You ought to have read it before you signed it. 

The PM: I didn't sign it. 

Myself: I know you didn't. But you were a member of the Cabinet which did sign it. 



Silence. (Cockfield, 56-7)' The writing had been on the wall ever since then, made more indelible by what Thatcher saw as his complicity in trapping her into agreeing to the 'Single European Act'. His appetite for pillorying British ministers in council meetings eventually lost him the support of the Foreign Office, which considered such public shows of national discord unseemly. By June 1988 he knew that he would not be reappointed, confirmation of which first reached him, as was the new vogue for the out-of-favour, through a Downing Street leak. But in that same month the Hanover European council declared that progress towards the single market was now 'irreversible', so that, sad though he was not to have a chance to steer the flagship home himself, he felt confident that he had set it on its course and that the momentum he had generated would see it in on time to a safe harbour. It certainly did not detract from his sense of ownership of the project: his own account of how it was all achieved, 'The European Union: Creating the Single Market' (1994), was written almost entirely in the first person singular. 
Four years after Cockfield's departure from Brussels, in December 1992, the vision became reality and, despite delays in implementation by some member states, the Edinburgh European council declared the single market complete in all essential respects. Not everything was as Cockfield had originally designed it -- his radical proposals on VAT and excise duties, too extreme in their logic to be swallowed by finance ministers, were denatured as soon as his back was turned -- and in some important respects, such as the energy market, there was still more to be done. But the whole unprecedentedly ambitious project as set out in the white paper had been substantially realized. 
Cockfield's role in the creation of the European single market was recognized in a series of honorary doctorates and fellowships from universities on both sides of the Atlantic as well as by the award by Belgium of the grand cross of the order of Leopold II. From 1988 he worked for some time as an adviser on European affairs to the London accountants Peat, Marwick, McLintock, and he was much in demand as a speaker at conferences on the single market. 1992 was, however, also the year in which his wife Monica, his constant companion, suddenly died, leaving him a lonely and isolated figure in his final years, though he continued to attend regularly and to speak in debates in the House of Lords until shortly before his death at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 8 January 2007, of gastro-intestinal bleeding. He was survived by his two children. 
Over an exceptionally long working life Cockfield had several distinguished careers, each of which would have earned him a solid footnote in the history books. But in the twilight of those years, arguably in just six months of superhuman intellectual effort, he made a whole chapter his own. The completion of the single market has been called the greatest leap forward in the process of European integration, profoundly altering the balance of economic power between the world's major trading blocs. Cockfield was perhaps an unlikely candidate for the status of European hero, but with his formidable, all-encompassing ability to hold both the detail and the wider picture together, combined with an unwavering loyalty to the rightness of his cause, he proved that the apparently impossible can, just occasionally, be achieved.

Denton, Sir Eric James (1923-2007), marine biologist and physiologist, was born on 30 September 1923 at 53 Denby Street, Bentley, Yorkshire, the only child of George Denton, a fitter at a colliery, later a grocer, and his wife, Mary Ann, 'nee' Ogden, who ran a dress shop. He won a scholarship to Doncaster grammar school and a state scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he read physics for two years before joining the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Malvern in 1942. There he worked on radar technology and met Nancy Emily Wright, whom he married at Christ Church, Doncaster, on 19 December 1946. She was the daughter of Charles Henry Wright of Doncaster. They had a daughter, Susan Mary ('b'. 1948), and two sons, Andrew ('b'. 1950) and Christopher ('b'. 1954). 
In the same year as his marriage Denton joined the biophysics group of the Nobel laureate A. V. Hill at University College, London. During this period he graduated BSc in physiology with first-class honours. Denton often remarked that this was the most important period in his career, as it allowed him to begin to apply physical principles to physiology -- an approach that underpinned much of his subsequent career. In 1948 he gained a full lectureship at the University of Aberdeen, focusing his research on the physiology of vision. He spent eight years in teaching and research in Aberdeen before moving in 1956 to the Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) as a physiologist. He became concurrently a Royal Society research professor at the University of Bristol in 1964. 
The MBA provided the perfect environment for Denton's research endeavours, being one of the foremost physiological and marine biological laboratories and attracting world-class scientists, including the Nobel prize-winning squid physiologists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley, along with many others. Denton's research interests began to broaden further at Plymouth. His research on vision extended from the study of the visual pigments of vertebrates to obtaining a deeper understanding of the structure of the eyes, luminescent organs, and external reflective surfaces of fish. He greatly improved the understanding of camouflage in fish and how they use reflective scales that, in the light environment under the sea, enable them to render themselves largely invisible to predators. His research was punctuated with groundbreaking discoveries, such as the finding that a species of deep sea dragonfish could use a 'searchlight' to illuminate its prey. He went on to make major discoveries relating to buoyancy in fish and cephalopods. In his later researches he developed a fruitful collaboration with Sir John Gray (former secretary of the Medical Research Council) through which they applied a combination of physiological and theoretical approaches to deepen the understanding of how fish perceive sound, movement, and distance, and in particular how their anatomy allows particularly efficient coupling between the swim bladder and the ear. Denton's skills in the laboratory were matched by his enthusiasm for working at sea on research vessels like 'Sarsia' and 'Discovery', which helped him to place his biophysical work into a broad biological and ecological context. It was his view that all scientific staff at the MBA should have experience of working at sea. 
Denton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and made ScD of Cambridge, both in 1964. He served as a council member and vice-president of the Royal Society, sat on many committees, and was a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution (1973-6). He was appointed CBE in 1974. Also in 1974 he became director of the MBA, taking on a substantial administrative load. He continued to develop the reputation of the MBA as a premier marine biological research laboratory, in particular making its facilities open to its many visitors, whom he regarded as being as important as the resident staff. His directorial style allowed scientists and visitors the freedom to explore the most interesting and exciting problems of the time and he engaged fully and enthusiastically with all researchers in Plymouth. He continued to carry out his own experiments, dividing his time between the laboratory and the director's office. Those who worked with him were struck by his desire for rigorous analysis and scientific discussion, driven by his natural curiosity. Coffee breaks would invariably turn into discussion sessions and he would simply, and often unexpectedly, drop into a laboratory or office to find out what was going on -- and what had been discovered recently -- from whoever was there. He was an extremely sociable individual and he and Nancy received many guests at their family home in St Germans, Cornwall. 
Denton received a number of the highest academic accolades, the most notable of which were (both in 1987, the year of his retirement) the Zoological Society's Frink medal and the Royal Society's royal medal. He was also knighted in 1987 for services to marine biology. He was awarded the Japan international prize for biology in 1989. He carried on with his research as an honorary fellow of the MBA after his retirement for a number of years. The progression of Parkinson's disease made it increasingly difficult for him to continue and eventually to communicate. True to his character, however, he developed a keen scientific interest in the condition and invented numerous devices to allay the symptoms based on his increasing understanding of its neurological basis. His family cared for him in his final years and he died on 2 January 2007 at Poldhu Nursing Home, Poldhu Cove, near Helston, Cornwall. He was cremated at Bodmin crematorium in January 2007, and was survived by his wife, Nancy, and their three children.

Elgar, Sybil Lillian (1914-2007), educationist, was born on 10 June 1914 at 88 Tubbs Road, Harlesden, Middlesex, the daughter of Frederick Green Craymer (1892-1939), railway locomotive fireman and later engine driver, and his wife, Ellen, 'nee' Thomas, who worked in the local Pathe News factory. At some point her family adopted the surname Green-Craymer. She was brought up in Willesden. During the Second World War she was a local government clerk responsible for accommodating evacuees in north London, and trained as a mortician. On 8 June 1940 she married John William Elgar (1914-1994), then a sapper in the Royal Engineers, formerly a railway clerk, and later a surveyor and civil servant. They had one daughter, Jacqueline (Jackie). 
After the war Sybil Elgar worked as a school secretary. On deciding to become a teacher she became a student of the Montessori method and owing to lack of financial resources she embarked on a correspondence course to gain her diploma. In 1958, while studying, she went to see the Marlborough Day Hospital for 'severely and emotionally disturbed children'. She was horrified by the scene she was confronted with and 'could not get out of her mind how soul-destroying the place was and how miserable the children were' ('The Guardian', 24 Jan 2007). At the time of the visit children with autism were viewed as being 'psychotic' and Leo Kanner's 'refrigerator mother' theory was prevalent. Parents, particularly mothers, were thought to be largely responsible for their offspring's difficulties due to a 'genuine lack of maternal warmth' and 'parental coldness', and it was widely accepted that children with disabilities should be placed in institutions (L. Kanner, 'Problems of nosology and psychodynamics of early infantile autism', 'Journal of American Orthopsychiatry', 19/3, 1949, 416-26). On visiting the hospital for a second time, in 1960, it was clear to Elgar that nothing had changed. Frustrated, she resolved to provide an alternative. 
In 1962 Elgar succeeded in setting up her own school for autistic children in the basement of her home in St John's Wood, London. There she developed a new and innovative way of teaching, allowing her pupils time to internalize what they needed to do, through clear instructions that she would write down or present in pictorial form. In doing so she became one of the first teachers able to see beyond the difficult, often severely challenging or withdrawn behaviour of autistic children to the underlying child, and to act on her belief that every child had the capacity to learn. As word spread, demand from parents grew. In September 1965, with support from the Autistic Children's Aid Society of North London (renamed the National Society for Autistic Children in 1966 and the National Autistic Society in 1975), she was able to open a residential school for children with autism, in Ealing. The school, initially named the Society School for Autistic Children, was the first of its kind in the UK, and, it is thought, the world. 
Although Elgar faced some critics who described the project as over-ambitious, the school quickly gained an international reputation as an example of how autistic children should be taught. At first nine children with an age range of five to fourteen years were accommodated within one building, which included a live-in flat for Sybil Elgar and her husband. However, within five years the school grew rapidly and the society was able to purchase three more adjoining houses, with the pupil intake growing to forty. Elgar's work was widely admired and she influenced, for example, Eric Schopler from North Carolina, USA, who came to view her work in 1965 and went on to develop the structured teaching model known as TEACCH (the treatment and education of autistic and related communication-handicapped children), which became part of the essential toolkit for teaching children with autism. 
In October 1969 Elgar celebrated a historic moment when an inspection by the Department of Education and Science granted the school formal recognition. The following year a visit from Edward Short, the secretary of state for education, gave further credibility to the pioneering work of Elgar and her team. In 1972 the National Society for Autistic Children marked its tenth anniversary. In the commemorative issue of the society's magazine, 'Communication', Elgar stated that 'Children need praise and congratulation but most of all they need the opportunity to continue their education and training so that they can maintain and extend educational capabilities, develop social and personal ability and acquire occupational skills' ('Communication', June 1972). This vision was shared by a growing number of educationists and carers, and reflected Elgar's determination to promote the rights of all children and adults with autism to learn and to have that learning facilitated throughout their lives. 
Despite celebrating tremendous success within the field of education Elgar was increasingly drawn to a similarly pioneering role for adults with autism. Soon after establishing the school she recognized that while the children improved considerably in their behaviour and awareness they still remained autistic, and if they did not continue to receive appropriate support into adulthood they could easily regress or struggle to cope with daily life. So, after an enormous fundraising effort, in 1974 she founded the first residential service for adults with autism. Still working with the National Society for Autistic Children, she oversaw the purchase of Somerset Court, a large house at Brent Knoll in Somerset. Moving twenty of the older children from the Ealing school, she set about showing how the skills the children had acquired at school could be developed and built on, greatly enhancing their lives as adults as well as their ability to function within society. According to Wendy Brown, the founding head of two later National Autistic Society schools (Helen Allison School and Broomhayes School), it was at Somerset Court that Elgar 'showed the effectiveness of a person with autism's functioning within society was based on other factors, including an appropriate education, the fostering of motivation, and a stimulating environment'. She also observed that Elgar 'was perhaps also the first person to realise that the language disorder was close to the heart of the condition' (private information, W. Brown). 
Sybil Elgar was appointed MBE in 1975 and retired in 1984, having made a major contribution to the body of expert knowledge, understanding, and experience of autism. She was an inspirational leader who had true determination and tenacity. Her last years were spent in Dawlish, Devon, where her daughter, Jackie, and her family lived. She died at Palm Court Nursing Home, Dawlish, on 8 January 2007, of pneumonia, and was cremated at Exeter crematorium. She was survived by her daughter. The principles of her work continued to inform the education and care of children and adults with autism throughout the UK and the world and she was commemorated by the renaming of her pioneering school as Sybil Elgar School. Each year at the school's graduation ceremony the Sybil Elgar cup is presented for 'most progress made'.

Ervine, David Walter (1953-2007), paramilitary and politician, was born on 21 July 1953 at 11 Chamberlain Street, Belfast, the third son and youngest of the five children of Walter Ervine, engineering worker, and his wife, Elizabeth (Dolly), 'nee' Tate. As a boy he attended Sunday school at the local Presbyterian church but gradually drifted away from formal religious observance. He was educated at Orangefield Boys' Secondary School but left formal education in June 1968, shortly before his fifteenth birthday. He subsequently worked in a number of manual and administrative jobs. On 1 March 1972, at the Megain Memorial Presbyterian Church, Knockbreda, Belfast, he married Jeanette Cunningham, a tobacco factory worker three years his senior, daughter of Robert Alexander (Bobby) Cunningham, fitter. They had two sons. 
Following the outbreak of civil conflict in Northern Ireland in August 1969 Ervine became involved in low-level vigilante activity, including the manning of barricades against the threat of republican bomb attacks. At the age of nineteen he joined the loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). His decision, he said, was inspired by the events of 21 July 1972, known as bloody Friday, when the Provisional IRA exploded some twenty-two bombs across Belfast, killing nine people. Ervine saw the decision to join the UVF as a means of defending his community. 
In November 1974 Ervine was arrested while driving a vehicle containing a 5 pound explosive device. He was tied to the vehicle by members of the security forces and forced to disarm the bomb himself. He was subsequently convicted of possessing explosives and served six years of an eleven-year sentence before he was released in 1980. While in the Maze prison he discovered a renewed interest in education, which led to his taking GCE O-level examinations and beginning an Open University course. He was one of a number of UVF prisoners influenced by their fellow prisoner Augustus (Gusty) Spence, a founding member of the UVF, who encouraged the organization to pursue a more directly political strategy. After his release from prison Ervine had a number of jobs including running a newsagent's shop, but he was increasingly drawn towards the world of politics. In 1984 he became associated with the Progressive Unionist Party, which was popularly viewed as the political wing of the UVF. He was a candidate in the district council elections of 1985 but was not elected. 
As the Northern Ireland peace process developed in the early 1990s Ervine played a significant role in discussions with other political actors, not least those from the Republic of Ireland. After the loyalist paramilitary groups declared a ceasefire in October 1994 he made an increasing number of media appearances, in which he was presented as someone who was close to the thinking of the UVF. His eloquence and ability to explain the loyalist position to a wide, and often critical, audience won him many admirers outside his own political constituency as well as the somewhat back-handed compliment of the nickname Dictionary Dave. He was elected to the Northern Ireland forum from the East Belfast constituency in May 1996. This was an area that for generations had been dominated by employment in heavy engineering companies and had returned Northern Ireland Labour Party members to Stormont in the 1950s and 1960s, before the outbreak of the 'troubles'. Indeed, Ervine's father had been a member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party. In May 1997 Ervine became a member of Belfast city council when he was elected in the Pottinger ward, also in east Belfast. He retained his seat in the May 2005 council elections. 
After the signing of the Good Friday agreement in April 1998 Ervine was a strong proponent of the agreement and for a 'yes' vote in the subsequent referendum on it. In 1998 he was elected to the Northern Ireland assembly to represent East Belfast and was again returned to the assembly in 2003. In April 2002 he succeeded Hugh Smyth as leader of the Progressive Unionist Party. In May 2006 he announced that he was supporting the Ulster Unionist Party group in the assembly, a move which, under the D'Hondt mechanism used to allocate ministerial posts in the Northern Ireland executive, potentially gave the Ulster Unionists a third seat in the executive. In September, however, the speaker of the assembly ruled against this arrangement, leading an angry Ervine to complain that, although the Northern Ireland executive required a compulsory coalition between parties, a voluntary coalition was not permitted. 
Ervine died at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, on 8 January 2007 following a heart attack and stroke. He was buried at Roselawn cemetery near Belfast on 12 January 2007. A funeral service held earlier that day at Newtownards Road Methodist Church was attended by many leading political figures including Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams. Adams's presence, in a staunchly Unionist area, was in itself perceived as a measure of success for the peace process in which Ervine had played a significant part. He was survived by his wife, Jeanette, and their two sons.

Hodges, Sir Lewis Macdonald (1918-2007), air force officer, was born at 6 Ormond Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 1 March 1918, the son of Arthur Macdonald Hodges (1879-1940), decorative artist and later antiques dealer, and his wife, Gladys Mildred, 'nee' Lewis (1891-1975). He was educated at St Paul's Boys' School in Barnes and at the RAF College at Cranwell, which he entered in 1937. Known as Bob, he was commissioned into the RAF as a pilot officer in December 1938 and joined Bomber Command. Based at RAF Finningley in Yorkshire, he began flying Vickers Wellesleys with 78 squadron, moving to 49 squadron in 1940, flying Handley Page Hampdens. 
Hodges's Hampden was damaged returning from a raid on Stettin on 4 September 1940 and he was forced to crash-land in Brittany. An eight-month sojourn on the run ensued. After setting fire to the plane Hodges and his air gunner (who had not heard the order to bale out) set off southwards to escape to Spain. With the help of farmers they reached Marseilles, where they were arrested by the Vichy authorities. Hodges managed to escape and stowed away on a cargo boat but was captured again in Oran and returned to Marseilles. Sent to the Vichy-controlled camp for British prisoners at St Hippolyte du Fort, near Nimes, he escaped for a second time and made his way to Perpignan and across the Pyrenees. Arrested by Spanish customs officials, he spent some weeks in the prison camp at Miranda de Ebro before the British embassy secured his release. He returned to England in June 1941 and rejoined 49 squadron. He was awarded the DFC in May 1942 for operations that included attacks in the English Channel on the German battlecruisers 'Scharnhorst' and 'Gneisenau' in February 1942. 
Later in 1942 Hodges was chosen by Wing-Commander Charles Pickard to join 161 squadron, based at RAF Tempsford, Bedfordshire, which was one of two squadrons detailed to support the Special Operations Executive on secret missions. Flying Halifax bombers, Hodges dropped agents and supplies all over occupied Europe. Awarded a bar to his DFC and promoted to commander of 161 squadron in May 1943, with the rank of squadron leader, he then flew Hudsons and Lysanders on six dangerous missions to pick up leading figures in the French resistance, landing on each occasion in remote and difficult places in rural France. Among the passengers he brought to Britain were two future French presidents, Vincent Auriol and Francois Mitterand. The former appointed him a commandeur of the Legion d'honneur in 1950; the latter advanced him to grand officier of the Legion in 1988. In October 1943 he received the DSO. 
Hodges attended the RAF Staff College in 1944 and was briefly attached to Bomber Command's operations staff. Selected to serve in the Far East as staff officer to Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, he requested a return to active duties after the death in action in Burma of his younger brother. It was another narrow escape, as Leigh-Mallory's plane and all its crew were lost over the Alps. Hodges then took command of 357 squadron at RAF Jessore near Calcutta in December 1944, flying four-engine Liberators, twin-engine Dakotas, and Lysanders. This was another special duties squadron supporting the Special Operations Executive, this time in Burma, with additional responsibilities assisting groups resisting Japanese occupation in Thailand and Malaya. The vast scale of these operations entailed sorties in Liberators of up to twenty hours. For his service in the Far East Hodges was awarded a bar to his DSO in October 1945. 
After the war Hodges was a member of the directing staff at the staff college in Haifa and then joined the new Joint Services Staff College at Latimer in 1947. He was attached to the Air Ministry from 1949 to 1952 as staff officer to the deputy chief of air staff and then in the directorate of plans. He returned to Bomber Command in 1952 and commanded the team of three RAF Canberras that entered the London-New Zealand air race in 1953: they finished fourth after engine trouble, but set a new London-Colombo record in the process. On 17 June 1950, at St Saviour's Church, Walton Street, Chelsea, he married Elisabeth Mary Blackett ('b'. 1925), daughter of Geoffrey Herbert Blackett, stockbroker. They had two sons, David ('b'. 1952) and Nigel ('b'. 1955). 
For the next two decades Hodges held a succession of highly responsible positions in the RAF and Air Ministry that took him to the very top of the service. From 1954 to 1959 he was involved in the development of Britain's V-bomber nuclear force. He began as chief instructor at the new operational training unit at Gaydon, training crews on Vickers Valiants. In 1956 he moved to command one of the largest RAF bases, at Marham, where the Valiants were being introduced in place of Canberras. He received there the two visiting Soviet leaders, Nikita Khrushchov and Nikolai Bulganin. He was promoted group captain in 1957 and appointed CBE the following year. After two years as assistant commandant at Cranwell between 1959 and 1961, now an air commodore, he was sent to Aden to oversee British air operations there. In 1963 he attended the Imperial Defence College, was promoted air vice-marshal and appointed CB, and was then posted to supreme headquarters, allied forces in Europe, as air executive to the nuclear deputy. 
In 1965 Hodges returned to the Air Ministry as assistant chief of air staff (operations): for three years he was focused on the Indonesian emergency and the British withdrawal from Aden. In 1968 he was promoted air marshal and advanced to KCB. As commander-in-chief of air support command he was responsible for RAF transport aircraft worldwide for the next two years. Then in 1970 he became air member for personnel for three years, in which role he was involved in the reorganization of the RAF and reductions in its manpower. In 1971 he became air chief marshal. From 1973 to 1976 his final position was within NATO as deputy commander-in-chief, allied air forces, central Europe. During this final period of his career he was also air aide-de-camp to the queen. 
After retiring from the RAF in 1976 Hodges was active in business and benevolence. He was a director of Pilkingtons from 1979 to 1983 and of the British United Provident Association (BUPA) from 1987. Active on behalf of the RAF Benevolent Fund -- he chaired its education committee from 1979 to 1986 -- he was also president of the Royal Air Force Association from 1981 to 1984 and directed the successful refurbishment of the RAF Club in Piccadilly. Unsurprisingly he was especially committed to the RAF Escaping Society, a charity that gave assistance to those French who helped on the escape lines that conveyed aircrew out of occupied Europe, and to the Tempsford reunions, which brought together those who had been involved in the wartime Special Operations Executive operations from the base. A record of his wartime service was published in 1983 by the RAF Benevolent Fund in 'Royal Air Force at War'. He retained a lifelong affection for France. 
Bob Hodges died of a stroke at his home, Cob Orchard, Tree Lane, Plaxtol, near Sevenoaks, Kent, on 4 January 2007. He was survived by his wife and their two sons. A service of thanksgiving for his life was held at St Clement Danes, London, on 15 March 2007.

Kelly, Barbara (1924-2007), performer and television personality, was born on 5 October 1924 in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Her father was an Irishman who worked as a lorry driver; her mother originally came from Manchester. Her childhood was not happy, and she hated the ballet and elocution classes forced on her by her stage-struck mother. Leaving school early, she nevertheless took up modelling, and joined an amateur dramatic company, performing at the Vancouver Little Theatre. It was during a performance there in 1940 that she was spotted by a cast member then rehearsing for a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio production of the York and Chester mystery plays. She was cast as the Virgin Mary, and it was while working on this production that she met her future husband, 
Recalling his first meeting with Kelly during rehearsals, Braden wrote that it was not only her outstanding beauty that drew attention: 'It was the voice that caused a hush. The range was incredible... I thought it phenomenal. So did everyone else' (Braden, 16). Her precocious talent and microphone technique led to her gaining a permanent place in the CBC's radio repertory company, while continuing her work as a fashion model. She and Braden were married on 13 April 1942, after which the couple moved to Toronto, where Braden continued to write and perform for the CBC; together they starred in a highly successful radio serial, 'John and Judy'. They had three children between 1943 and 1948, Christopher, Kelly, and Kim. 
In 1947 CBC sent Braden to Britain to make a series of documentaries on post-war recovery. It was a short working trip, but the material gathered for these programmes formed the basis of a book, 'These English' (1948). In 1949 he was back in the UK, this time with Kelly. The couple quickly established themselves as popular entertainers on stage and radio, their bright, lively personalities, attractive accents, and warm humour endearing them to British audiences. Braden played the part of Harold Mitchell in Laurence Olivier's production of 'A Streetcar Named Desire', which opened at the Aldwych Theatre later the same year. Both Braden and Kelly were in demand separately in radio dramas, and Kelly became a hit in the West End show 'Male Animal', also in 1949. Although she appeared in a number of stage shows subsequently, she confessed that she never liked the medium, being much happier on radio, and later television. In May 1949 the couple appeared in a one-off situation comedy about two Canadians living in London, called 'Leave Your Name and Number'. The show was so successful that the BBC developed it as a full series, starting in April 1951. 
By this time Braden had established himself with the hugely successful 'Breakfast with Braden', a Saturday morning comedy and music series that was first aired in January 1950. The format was preserved when the programme moved to an evening slot in September 1950, becoming 'Bedtime with Braden', when Braden was joined by Kelly. In June of that year the couple appeared on the cover of the 'Radio Times'. Braden's impact on British radio audiences of the time may be judged by an article in the 1951 edition of the 'BBC Year Book': 'One of the more mobile, quick-firing units in the current Canadian invasion of British entertainment is a one-man blitz named Bernard Braden... So far nobody has explained whence Braden derives the energy that has rocketed him to stardom in only a year. ('BBC Year Book', 92-3)' In 1951, the still-young BBC Television featured 'An Evening at Home with Bernard Braden and Barbara Kelly'. 

'Bedtime with Braden' continued to run for a further four series, but in 1953 Kelly left the show to join the television panel game with which she was to become most associated, 'What's my Line'. Chaired by Eamonn Andrews, and featuring the panellists David Nixon, Gilbert Harding, Isobel Barnett, and Kelly, the format was a simple one: members of the public would perform a short mime, from which the panel attempted to guess their occupation. Broadcast on Sunday evenings on the only television channel available until the launch of ITV in 1955, 'What's my Line' was almost compulsory viewing for those families possessing a television set. It ran until 1963, and in 1984 it was revived, running for a further three years, with Kelly and Andrews the only survivors of its original cast. 
During the early 1950s Kelly also appeared in a number of films, among them 'A Tale of Five Cities' (1951), 'Glad Tidings' (1953), and 'Love in Pawn' (1953). These were undistinguished works, but they helped to subsidize the Bradens' flamboyant lifestyle, with a large flat in Knightsbridge and a fine house in Hampstead. By the start of the 1960s Kelly was one of the best-known personalities on British radio and television. Over the next decade, however, her career was eclipsed as her husband's moved into the ascendant. From 1962 to 1968 Braden presented the programme for which he is best remembered, 'On the Braden Beat', for ATV. With this programme and its BBC successor, Braden created a new genre; the programme, a pioneering example of consumer television, won a BAFTA award in 1964, and Braden became the Variety Club's personality of the year in 1965. In 1968 he presented a BBC version in a similar format, 'Braden's Week', which ran until 1972, when Braden was sacked, allegedly for presenting a margarine commercial on ITV. The broadcaster Esther Rantzen, a researcher on the show, later went on to present 'That's Life', a television programme much like 'Braden's Week' in style and format. Although Rantzen always acknowledged her debt to Braden, Kelly remained bitter about the chain of events. 
From the 1970s onwards the careers of both Kelly and Braden were in decline; despite some further occasional radio, television, and stage work, they were never again to reach the remarkable heights of popularity and public acclaim they had enjoyed during the 1950s and 1960s. During this time they developed Adanac Productions (Adanac being Canada spelt backwards), specializing in presentations at business conferences. Kelly also started an agency offering advice on career development to celebrities and, through her company Prime Performers, supplied the services of entertainers and broadcasters as after-dinner speakers. 
In May 1987 Kelly was operated on for throat cancer. This was successful, but it left her face scarred and from this time she became more reclusive. In 1990 Braden published his memoirs, 'The Kindness of Strangers', and in 1992 the couple celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. Despite being in poor health herself, Kelly nursed her husband through a series of strokes. At the time of his death, at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, London, on 2 February 1993, following a heart attack, Braden was working on a second volume of autobiography. In 2000 Kelly set up a new company, Speakerpower, 'specialising in personal training for everyone who has to speak in public', and utilizing the services of successful broadcasters and performers as trainers. Suffering from cancer, she died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at the Marie Curie Hospice, Camden, London, on 15 January 2007. She was survived by her two daughters, her son Christopher having predeceased her. By the time of their deaths, radio and television trends had changed out of all recognition, and Kelly's and Braden's last years were spent in relative obscurity. Nevertheless they had had a remarkable influence on post-war British media over a period of nearly thirty years. Kelly, vivacious, charming, attractive, was a breath of fresh air and a household name on both radio and television, while Braden deserves recognition not only for his extreme versatility, but for his major contribution to broadcasting by pioneering consumer television.

Kenrick, Bruce Henderson (1920-2007), Presbyterian minister and housing campaigner, was born on 18 January 1920 at 14 Poulter Road, Walton, Liverpool, the son of John Ernest Drury Kenrick (1890-1968), incorporated accountant's clerk, later accountant, and his wife, Sarah Mabel, 'nee' Barber (1891-1962). He was brought up in Liverpool, educated at Merchant Taylors' School there and, until called up for military service in the Second World War, was training to be an accountant. During the war he served as a stretcher bearer in the Royal Army Medical Corps in the Gold Coast and later with both the Eighth Army and the Parachute brigade in Italy. Although he planned to be a doctor and went to Edinburgh University to study medicine after demobilization, he became involved in mission work with the Christian Union and subsequently switched to divinity. He graduated in 1954, the same year that he married Isabel Howland Witte (1926/7-2010), an American historian whom he met in Edinburgh where she was on a Fulbright scholarship. 
After ordination as a Presbyterian minister Kenrick continued his studies at the Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey and it was when he was there that he became involved in the East Harlem protestant parish in New York. This was a ministry of social action, working cheek by jowl with the urban poor, drug addicts, and the homeless, and it made a deep impression on him. For three years thereafter (1956-9) he lived in Bengal, where he worked as a missionary and supported movements for land reform. However, typhoid forced him back to Britain and he and his wife, now with three daughters (the fourth child, a son, was born later), moved to the Scottish island community of Iona to recuperate. While he was there he wrote 'Come Out the Wilderness' (1962) advocating a fully socially engaged and active church. 'The point of the Gospel', he wrote 'is not just to patch up society's wounds; it is also to grapple with the wills of the men who have inflicted those wounds, and who might well inflict them again.' This was his most influential book, although he also wrote 'The New Humanity' (1956) and 'A Man from the Interior: Cuba's Quest' (1980). 
In 1962 Kenrick and his family moved to London's Notting Hill, into a house in Blenheim Crescent purchased with his father's legacy. The area then was far from the desirable location of later in the century, with large numbers dependent on an often exploitative private rented sector. Kenrick quickly involved himself in finding ways to improve what he described as 'damnable housing conditions'. Working in a team ministry, he was part of a campaign to persuade the Conservative-controlled council to take action, but struck out on his own in December 1963 when he called a meeting that led to the establishment of the Notting Hill Housing Trust, designed to do what the council would not do, namely to buy and renovate property for rent at affordable prices for those in need. Displaying the flair for publicity for which he would become renowned, he took the risk of spending large sums of money on hard-hitting advertising, including a photograph of a family of six in one room under the headline 'Heartbreak Notting Hill and you'. The result was that the trust in its first year was able to buy five houses and house fifty-seven people. Within five years it had become a significant presence in west London, housing nearly 1000 people. By then, though, Kenrick had moved on. 
Although he had done much to raise the problem of poor housing into a political issue -- Harold Wilson's Labour government that came to power in 1964 was committed to action -- Kenrick struggled with the limitations of an essentially local organization, believing that the campaign for better housing had to be national if it were to be fully effective in forcing local councils to take their housing responsibilities seriously. This the committee of the Notting Hill Trust was not prepared to do, so Kenrick took on the task himself. The result was Shelter, which became a reality in 1966, thanks to Kenrick's tireless energy, lobbying, and promotion. Described as Shelter's founder, Kenrick wrote, 'The most exhilarating fact about the launching of Shelter's National Campaign for the Homeless is that it brings fresh hope of good, low-rent homes to many of Britain's three million families who now live in slums, in near slums, or in grossly overcrowded conditions. ('The Times', 2 Dec 1966)' Shelter was given an enormous boost by the coincidence of its launch with the screening ten days earlier by the BBC of the film 'Cathy Come Home', which provoked a public outcry over homelessness. However, while Shelter established itself quickly as a major player on housing issues, Kenrick soon fell out with his colleagues and left the organization after it appointed Des Wilson, a talented organizer, as its director. This is perhaps not surprising for a man decribed by his daughter as a 'crusader' ('The Guardian', 2 March 2010), by a former colleague at Notting Hill Housing Trust as a 'marvellous one man band' ('The Times', 24 Jan 2007), by a former chief executive of Shelter as 'a founding member of the awkward squad' ('The Times', 20 Jan 2007), and by a Glasgow 'Herald' obituarist as a 'thrawn maverick' who 'could have raised a fight in a quiet cathedral, and indeed often did' ('The Herald', 27 Jan 2007). His successor in the chair at Shelter acknowledged, though, that 'it was Bruce Kenrick who started Shelter and without him it would never have existed' ('The Guardian', 19 Jan 2007). Later he was described by the chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organizations as one of the 'sector heroes' of social enterprise ('Bubb's blog', 10 February 2010, http://bloggerbubb.blogspot.com). 
Kenrick remained in Notting Hill until 1980, and after further assignments in parishes in Bayswater and Hackney, moved again to Iona. Divorced from his wife in 1983 (though they remained close) and increasingly plagued by illness, he remained in Iona for the last twenty years of his life, sustained by his membership of the Iona Community. Although he lived quietly, he was writing another book at the time of his death, at the Lorn and Islands District General Hospital, Oban, of a gastro-intestinal haemorrhage, on 15 January 2007. He was survived by his four children.

Kogan, Maurice (1930-2007), civil servant and scholar of education and public policy, was born Maurice Cohen on 10 April 1930 at 48 Stephens Road, West Ham, London. He and his identical twin, Philip, were the youngest of five boys and one girl of Barnett Cohen, born Barnett Kogan (1884/5-1935), and his wife, Hetty, 'nee' Vicker (1893-1978). The family was Jewish; his father, who had fought for Britain in the First World War, came from Russia, his mother from Poland. Though the birth certificates of the twins were in the name Cohen, their passports were always in the name Kogan, the story being that Barnett, arriving in England as Kogan, assumed the Anglicized form Cohen under family pressure, but the family reverted to the Russian form Kogan after 1945. When Maurice and Philip were four their father died and their mother ran a sweetshop to make ends meet. 
The young Maurice Kogan won a place at Stratford grammar school in east London. Hard working, politically minded, he typified the clever grammar school pupils given a chance by the 'Education Act' of 1944. He won an exhibition to read history at Christ's College, Cambridge, and went on to gain a first in the historical tripos in 1953. In the same year he also achieved first place in the home civil service administrative grade examinations. Preferring, as he put it, the hands-on intrigues of Whitehall to the archival intrigues of medieval popes, he chose the Ministry of Education, where he was to remain for fourteen years. 
On 11 August 1960 he married Ulla-Britta Astrid Svensson, daughter of Vilehard Svensson, florist. The marriage took place in Stockholm, the city in which she had been born and brought up. The newly married couple immediately set off for the United States on the Harkness fellowship that Kogan had been awarded for 1960-61, which gave him visiting status at Harvard, Chicago, and Stanford. On their return they settled in a terrace house in Islington decades before the area became fashionable, and had two sons, Tom and Peter. After the children started school Ulla became a social worker. Later they bought a house in Suffolk. 
Kogan stayed in the Ministry of Education (from 1964 the Department of Education and Science) until 1967. He had been identified early as a high-flyer. From 1957 to 1959 he was private secretary to Sir Edward Boyle, at the time an influential parliamentary secretary. From 1963 to 1966 he was secretary to the Central Advisory Council (England) which, under the chairmanship of Bridget, Lady Plowden, produced a ground-breaking report on child-centred primary education. He was rewarded with promotion to assistant secretary status in 1966. During his time at the Central Advisory Council he and his superiors had hoped he would have a spell in the prime minister's office, another marker of his civil service career potential. But Lady Plowden, a forceful chairman, would not let him go. 
In 1967 Kogan, convinced he had missed his civil service chance, moved into academia, joining Brunel University as director of the Hospital Organisation Unit. Brunel was a former college of advanced technology which had become a university in 1966, following the 1963 Robbins report on higher education. Though the former colleges of advanced technology did not have the cachet of Oxford and Cambridge, the major civic universities, or the new campuses like Sussex and York, Brunel stood out as attracting some very distinguished social scientists who believed that 'the new map of knowledge' of the 1960s should include technological institutions. They included Elliott Jaques, Keith Hopkins, Dan Miller, and John Vaizey. In 1969 Kogan became professor of government and social administration. In 1970 he was made head of department, a post he held for twenty years. From 1971 he was dean of the faculty of social sciences. In 1989 he became acting vice-chancellor for nine months, following the sudden death of the incumbent. By that time he was such an internationally acclaimed scholar of public policy, and particularly higher education, that full-time academic politics and management did not tempt him -- other than 'their bloody great cars and their salaries' (personal knowledge). In 1990 Brunel established the Centre for the Evaluation of Public Policy, which he directed until 2004. 
Kogan produced many notable publications over forty years. Four books came out in 1971 alone, built around the public policy contracts he had won for Brunel and his experience at the Ministry of Education. By the end of his life he had produced almost forty books and about seventy articles. Their themes were power, politics, policies, and the processes of change, with a focus on public policy and the way in which forms of knowledge, the governance of knowledge, and professional values interacted with institutional change. There were important books on health but the majority were on education, especially higher education, and latterly on issues of evaluation. A hallmark was what came to be called evidence-based research (a revealing comment on social-science research of the 1970s and 1980s). Illuminated by empirical evidence, the conclusions of Kogan and the collaborators with whom he regularly worked (including Tony Becher, Mary Henkel, Ivar Bleiklie, and Stephen Hanney) were major contributions in conceptualizing the shift that was taking place from government to governance, and in particular how conflicts of values, beliefs about knowledge, and institutional pressures work out within political and administrative systems. 
Notable among these 'evidence-based' books were 'The Politics of Education' (1971), an analytic conversation guided by Kogan between politically opposed ministers of education; 'County Hall' (1973), on the inner London education authority; 'Directors of Education' (with Tony Bush, 1982); 'Government and Research: the Rothschild Experiment in a Government Department' (with Mary Henkel, 1983; second edn, 2006), a study of the Department of Health (unravelling the issue of how government and scientists interacted on policy gave Kogan great satisfaction and continued to illuminate his thinking); 'Reforming Higher Education' (with Stephen Hanney, 2000); and 'Transforming Higher Education' (with Marianne Bauer, Ivar Bleiklie, Mary Henkel, and others, 2000; second edn, 2006). In parallel were Kogan's works that were destined to become standard social-science texts exploring policy-making theory: 'Educational Policy-Making' (1975), 'The Politics of Educational Change' (1978), and, most important, 'Process and Structure in Higher Education' (with Tony Becher, 1980; second edn, 1992). 
A third group of publications reflected Kogan's passionate engagement in political issues. Notable among these were the two books he co-wrote with his journalist nephew David Kogan. The first was 'The Battle for the Labour Party' (1982). Horrified by the advance in London politics of the so-called Outside Left -- the unlikely alliance of Trotskyists, Communist Party members, and supporters of Tony Benn MP -- they uncovered the process by which the Outside Left's preferred candidate, Ken Livingstone, was able to seize the leadership of the London Labour Party and the Greater London council in 1981. 'The Attack on Higher Education' (1983) followed, chronicling the undermining of the collegial tradition in the management of universities. Both reflected Kogan's passionate beliefs as much as his rigour. 
Kogan was much in demand for national and international public-policy inquiries; his public service included membership of the Davies committee on hospital complaints procedure (1971), the Houghton committee on teachers' pay (1974), the education sub-committee of the University Grants Committee (1972-5), and the Social Science Research Council (1975-7). He undertook reviews for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development of education or higher education policy in the USA, Finland, Greece, Sweden, and Norway, and for many years edited its journal 'Higher Education Management and Policy'. In 1988 he was one of the founders of the academically respected Consortium of Higher Education Researchers. In 2000 he became a founding fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences. He received honorary doctorates from two universities (Hull, 1987; Brunel, 1991). 
The respect, affection, and gratitude in which Maurice Kogan was held was demonstrated on his birthday in 2005, when leading scholars of higher education came from around the world to offer him a Festschrift devoted to themes on which he had provided inspiration and leadership. Edited by his long-time collaborators Mary Henkel and Ivar Bleiklie, 'Governing Knowledge' showed how much his rigorous and humane work had permeated scholarship and public-policy thinking. Although already diagnosed with a cancer that doctors expected to carry him off before then, he lived almost two years more. He died on 6 January 2007, survived by his wife, Ulla, and their sons.

Kerr, Antonella Reuss, marchioness of Lothian (1922-2007), journalist and charity founder, was born in Rome on 22 May 1922, the only child of Major-General Sir Foster Reuss Newland (1862-1943), Royal Army Medical Corps doctor and director of Middle East medical services, and his wife, Donna Nennella (Agnes), 'nee' Salazar y Munatones, daughter of Count Michele Salazar, a lieutenant-general in the Italian army. Her parents were married in 1918 when her father was fifty-six, her mother twenty; the marriage was dissolved in 1928. Her mother then married William Greenwood Carr, a young army officer who later became a brigadier and lieutenant of the king's bodyguard of the yeomen of the guard. They had one further daughter, Annabel ('b'. 1930), who later married the thirteenth Earl Ferrers. 
As an army officer's daughter Tony Newland had a peripatetic childhood, the more so after her parents divorced. She divided her life between Rome and San Remo in Italy, and Suffolk. She was home-educated with a group of cousins; unusually, this was in the liberal teaching methods of the Parents' National Educational Union movement. Like many young women of her class and generation she was sent to Munich to be 'finished' in 1936. There she came across the horrors of fascism and master-race eugenics, political ideologies that provoked in her a lasting care and concern for 'the voiceless weak' and a determination to help those in trouble. 
In 1940 a brief time at Oxford was interrupted by wartime duty as a nursing auxiliary. She always regretted not finishing her education, but it was at Oxford that she met up again with a childhood friend, Peter Francis Walter Kerr, twelfth marquess of Lothian (1922-2004). He was serving in the Scots Guards when they married on 30 April 1943 at the Brompton Oratory in Knightsbridge, London. After the war they lived in one of the remaining Kerr family properties, Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire, which they renovated and opened to the public in 1951. (Peter's predecessor as marquess of Lothian had bequeathed Blickling Hall in Norfolk to the National Trust, and Newbattle Abbey to the Scottish universities.) In 1950 they moved to the Scottish borders and began the restoration of Monteviot, the family's 18,000 acre country estate near Jedburgh, into which they eventually moved in 1962. But she was most proud of their rescue of Ferniehirst, a 'frontier castle' in the borders dating back to the seventeenth century, to which they retired in 1986. While she was proud of her husband's ancestral inheritance in the Scottish borders, she was unimpressed by the pomp of the aristocracy: 'I suddenly assumed an identity that had nothing to do with me' (Paton, 58-9). But she managed to pull off the trick of being both establishment and anti-establishment throughout her life. 
Between 1944 and 1957 Tony and Peter Lothian had six children. They were active parents; he the quiet one, fond of jazz and playing the piano, she more outgoing and flamboyant. In 1949 she was asked to edit 'Catholic Mother', the quarterly magazine of the Catholic Mothers' Union. The circulation rose from 2000 to 20,000 by the time she left in 1961. She delighted in commissioning articles from friends such as Elizabeth Pakenham and Evelyn Waugh. In 1960 she was offered a weekly column in the 'Scottish Daily Express' by its editor, Ian McColl (who is reputed to have said that if she could increase his readership too by 20,000 she was hired). Her trial article on trade sanctions against Rhodesia made the centre spread. For fourteen years she wrote (on the floor at home, in longhand and surrounded by children) on the critical social issues of the 1960s and 1970s, from working women to sex education, drugs, and youth. Balanced comment was her aim on all subjects, but as she later said, balance was not fashionable at the time. 'This', she said, 'gave me profound respect for the media men and women who told the truth' (Paton, 42). Her respect for those journalists who did fearlessly tell the truth led to her setting up, in 1974, the Valiant for Truth award with her good friends the American Marxist editor Mikki Doyle and the actress Renee Goddard. 
Long before then, in 1955, came the project for which Tony Lothian was best remembered. In that year she persuaded Odette Hallowes, the former Second World War resistance fighter, and Lady Georgina Coleridge, the formidable 'Lady G', a magazine editor and publisher, and subsequently also Violet Attlee, wife of the former prime minister, to help her launch a Luncheon to celebrate women of achievement from all walks of life. The post-war achievements of women in business, academe, the trades, and professions were at the time generally ignored. Men had their clubs, their exclusive dinners, and established structures for status and recognition; women, for the most part, had nothing remotely similar. The Women of the Year Luncheon, held annually at the Savoy Hotel in London, set out to fill this gap. Artists might sit next to hospital matrons; a thatcher next to a station master, racing driver, or pop singer; Marxists next to high tories. 
Every woman who attended the lunch was a 'woman of the year'. They came by invitation only, each guest paying for her ticket. Any profits went to charity, originally the Greater London Fund for the Blind, but later the foundation set up by the Women of the Year Luncheon to fund entrepreneurial projects for women around the world. There was a certain irony about the original choice of charity: Hallowes, Coleridge, and Lothian all subsequently had eye problems (Tony Lothian lost an eye to cancer), and from 1970 onwards each wore an eye-patch at the lunches. In her own style of red or white shirt, black waistcoat, and black skirt, Lothian cut 'a rakish, piratical-looking figure with a cockatoo shock of dark hair, a black eye-patch and what looks suspiciously like an Irish shillelagh' (Paton, 5). Guests included Valentina Tereshkova, who became a good friend and received Tony Lothian on several visits to Moscow for international conventions, and about whom she later wrote a book, 'Valentina, First Woman in Space' (1993). Other notable national and international guests included Margaret Thatcher, Queen Noor of Jordan, Princess Margaret, Princess Diana, Coretta King, Jung Chang, and Simone Weil. Tony Lothian met many of the guests through her work as vice-president of the Royal College of Nursing (1960-80), court patron of the Royal College of Gynaecologists, patron of the National Council of Women, and president of the Institute of Journalists. 
Tony Lothian was appointed OBE in 1997 for services to women and blind people, and became a dame of St Gregory in 2002 for her work in interfaith understanding. She was the first president of the Order of Unity, which later became the Scottish Order of Christian Unity. She said that her major inspirations were Emmeline Pankhurst and Hildegard of Bingen. She died at Ferniehirst Castle on 6 January 2007, after a stroke. Her funeral and requiem mass were held on 15 January at St David's Roman Catholic Church, Dalkeith. A memorial service was held at Westminster Cathedral on 11 June 2007. She was survived by all six children. Her elder son, Michael, known as Michael Ancram ('b'. 1945), Conservative politician, had succeeded his father as thirteenth marquess of Lothian. In honour of her life and work, in 2009 her daughter Elizabeth, countess of Dalkeith, set up the Tony Lothian Biographers' Club prize for uncommissioned first-time writers of biography.

Magnusson, Magnus (1929-2007), Icelandic scholar, broadcaster, and environmentalist, was born on 12 October 1929 in Reykjavik, Iceland, the son of Sigursteinn Magnusson (1899-1982), European export manager of the Icelandic Co-operative, and later Icelandic consul-general for Scotland, and his wife, Ingibjorg Sigurdardottir (1905-1983). The second youngest of four children, he had a brother, Sigurdur (1927-1985), and two sisters, Margret (1928-1996), and Snjolaug ('b'. 1935). With this nationality and parentage he should have been called Magnus Sigursteinsson, but this was regarded as too difficult for non-Icelanders to pronounce in the family's newly adopted country of Scotland, where they moved when Magnus was nine months old. So, Magnus Magnusson he became, and remained, although he Anglicized the spelling by removing the accents. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, where he was dux (he later wrote the school's history, 'The Clacken and the Slate', 1974), and, having won an open scholarship, at Jesus College, Oxford, where he graduated with a second-class degree in English in 1951. 
Forsaking the academic life, Magnusson began his long and distinguished career in the media. He started as a staff writer and was later assistant editor (1953-61) of the 'Scottish Daily Express'. He was sought out by Alastair Dunnett, the editor of 'The Scotsman', to be chief features writer and rose to become assistant editor. It was in these jobs that he honed his skills as an investigator and writer of repute. Meanwhile, on 30 June 1954, at Wardlawhill parish church, Rutherglen, Glasgow, he married Mary Ian (Mamie) Baird (daughter of John Baird, janitor, and his wife, Sarah), a fellow journalist and chief feature writer on the 'Scottish Daily Express'. They had five children, Sally, Margaret, Anna, Siggy, and Jon. Siggy was killed in a motor accident aged eleven. The other children followed their father into radio or television broadcasting. Magnusson was a true family man, being described by his daughter Sally as 'the most generous, steadfast, loving and loved of husbands and fathers' ('The Times', 8 Jan 2007). 
Magnusson began his television career as a presenter and producer of current affairs and documentaries on BBC Scotland in the mid-1960s. This was followed by two years as a presenter on the late evening current affairs programme 'Tonight'. A long-running archaeological programme, 'Chronicle' (1966-80), followed; Magnusson was creator, researcher, and presenter, displaying his mastery of gathering knowledge and communicating it to a wider audience. 
Magnusson was best known as the 'interrogator' in the television quiz series 'Mastermind' which he fronted for twenty-five years, from 1972 to 1997. This programme suited his approach to knowledge: he described his hobbies in 'Who's Who' as 'digging and delving'. He had a mellifluous voice and deep humanity, always putting contestants at their ease behind the scenes with a smile and a joke. The phrase he made famous, 'I've started, so I'll finish', had special significance as Magnusson was the consummate finisher of everything he started. The final programme, recorded in St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney, brought together three facets of his interests: broadcasting, the Nordic world, and outstanding national heritage. 
Magnusson was deeply attached to his native country in mind and soul, although he never lived there permanently. 'My hearth is in Scotland, but my heart is in Iceland', he often said. He was a master of Iceland's history and folklore, an expert on Icelandic literature, could read Old Norse and modern Icelandic with ease, and could speak and translate the Icelandic language fluently. He studied Old Norse literature at Oxford University and in Copenhagen. With his colleague and collaborator Hermann Palsson, he translated five of the Sagas: 'Njal's Saga' (1960), 'Eirik's Saga' (1965), 'The Vinland Sagas' (1965), 'King Harald's Saga' (1966), and 'Laxdaela Saga' (1969). Such was his meticulous approach to translation, the sign of a true scholar, that he revised his translations for a new publisher late in life. He was a consummate interpreter and teller of Iceland's history. Those fortunate enough to hear him give a recitation from Logberg (the Law Rock at the world's first democratic parliament, the Althing, in Thingvellir) felt they had experienced the drama and significance of the original proceedings. He led tours telling the stories set out in the sagas. Listening to him telling the story behind the name of each hummock in the landscape was to attend a master class in cultural history. He translated five of the novels of Iceland's nobel laureate in literature, Halldor Laxness, bringing to the English-speaking world otherwise inaccessible novels of the highest quality. His services to Iceland were recognized by his being made a knight of the order of the Falcon in 1975 and knight commander in 1986, and also by an Edda (equivalent to a BAFTA award) for his contribution to television. 
Magnusson was immensely passionate about Iceland's natural environment, had little time for conserving just a few special places, and argued that the whole of the Icelandic highlands should be a national park. This was not achieved in his lifetime. He acted as the environmental guide and mentor to his great friend, the former president of Iceland, Vigdis Finnbogadottir, who later said of him 'no one has matched the scale on which Magnus presented Iceland to the English speaking world' (funeral oration). He was revered throughout the Nordic world and he was warmly welcomed whenever he visited those northern realms. His daughter Sally's account of visiting Iceland with her father in 'Dreaming of Iceland: the Lure of a Family Legend' (2005) told of the handing on of the love affair with his native country and provided insights into her father's character. 
Magnusson was a wordsmith of the highest calibre. He wrote some fifteen books, translated another ten, and wrote many speeches and articles. What began as a small task might end as a well researched and highly readable book. A talk on the Hebridean island of Rum ended with a book on its history (1997). The series of broadcasts entitled 'Tales of a Grandfather' (after Sir Walter Scott's classic book) ended as a 700-page 'tour de force', 'Scotland: the Story of a Nation' (2001), which was described by a reviewer as 'so well written, so well researched, so well understood'. Erudition, scholarship, rigour of research, vigour and determination in the execution, along with elegant phrasing, were hallmarks of his approach. Quotations from many sources peppered his talks and books. He was particularly fond of Gerard Manley Hopkins. He published a book of quotations collected over his lifetime of reading, 'Keeping my Words' (2004). He devoured dictionaries and was a severe grammatical taskmaster. It was said about working with him, 'to unforgivably split an infinitive... was a serious offence' (Smout). 
Magnusson investigated each subject meticulously, whether for a book, a speech, or a broadcast. He prepared for every event as if all of life depended upon it, whether a meeting with a government minister, a parliamentary committee, or a board meeting. He recorded briefings on his trusty pocket recorder, listened to them assiduously, and typed them into his notes. His preparation of a lecture or talk was equally detailed. He wrote all of his speeches and declaimed them word for word, although few realized this as his delivery was so accomplished. Giving a speech from notes left too much to chance, he believed, but he admired those who could do it. 
Magnusson's contribution to heritage and the environment was also very significant. The starting point was bird watching as a schoolboy at Edinburgh Academy. At the age of fourteen he won the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds' public schools essay competition on the mating rituals of blackbirds. Later in life he became president of the society (1985-90) and loved to focus the lens of his precious Bausch and Lomb binoculars on a bird and identify it by its 'jizz'. 
Magnusson was chairman of the Scottish Churches Architectural Heritage Trust (1978-85), and of the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland (1981-9). His work on national heritage, particularly in Scotland, in increasing the public's understanding through broadcasting, writing and committee work was recognized with the award of an honorary KBE (he retained his Icelandic nationality), and the Medlicott medal of the Historical Association, both in 1989. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the secretary of state for Scotland, surprised many and silenced critics by appointing him chairman of the newly created Scottish Natural Heritage (1992-9). In preparation for this role he was appointed by Rifkind successively as chairman of the Scottish advisory committee of the Nature Conservancy Council (1989-91), and chairman of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland (1991-2). He worked tirelessly and with enormous determination to resolve many inherited conflicts in pursuit of his vision of bringing people and nature together. 
Magnusson never avoided difficult tasks, but sought to bring opposing factions together, both in Iceland and in Scotland. Some very knotty problems were what he called 'a two pipe job'. Debates about the future of the Cairngorms Mountains in Scotland (he chaired a government working party in 1991-3), about geese and farmers on Islay, or about access over sporting estate land in Scotland, were addressed, along with a foray into the conservation battles around Lake Myvatn in Iceland. To all of these, and many other contentious issues in the environmental field, he applied his intellect and humanity alongside his ability to ensure that opponents began to see the sense of a different approach. The title of his report on the Cairngorms, 'Common Sense and Sustainability', echoed his whole approach. 
Magnusson devoted a great deal of effort to the education of younger generations, and being with children gave him great delight. He was chairman of the Scottish Youth Theatre (1976-8). He was a very effective rector of Edinburgh University (1975-8), bridging the gap between the student and teaching communities. He later devoted his boundless energy to the chancellorship of Glasgow Caledonian University (2002-7). He would have been delighted with the Magnus Magnusson awards established by the university in 2007 to promote the ideas of young people, the Magnus Magnusson fellowships to stimulate discussion of issues of major concern to society, and the Magnus Magnusson PhD studentship, first awarded by Scottish Natural Heritage in 2008. His contributions to the life and heritage of Scotland were recognized by the honorary degrees awarded by seven universities (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Glasgow Caledonian, Napier, Paisley, Strathclyde, and York). 
Magnusson was a brilliant, charismatic man of many parts who graced public life, literature, and the media in Scotland, Britain, and Iceland. He achieved more in one lifetime than most would achieve in three. He was the archetypal polymath and, as he liked to say, an opsimath: a learner late in life. He was also one of the most kindly and humane of people, with a great sense of humour. He had his favourites, people whom he trusted and who shared his visions, took action, and were not bowed down by bureaucracy. A favourite phrase was 'I like the cut of his jib', of someone he had just met and was keen to work with. He could use his personality and knowledge to gain the upper hand, for example, in meetings with government ministers, much to the chagrin of their officials. To others about whose views he was sceptical he would respond enigmatically, 'You may well be right'. He was by nature an optimist and always wished to find solutions. He despised humbug and arrogance, and was intolerant of negativity. He was very demanding and expected everyone to work as long and as hard as he did; he could not tolerate missed deadlines. His daughter Sally summed her father up exquisitely: he 'did everything to excess: drank hard, smoked fervently, loved deeply, gave generously, worked furiously, committed himself passionately to the things he cared about and drove himself relentlessly. Mediocrity was anathema. Political correctness never got a look in' ('Sunday Herald', 11 March 2007). 
Magnusson died of pancreatic cancer on 7 January 2007 at his family home, Blairskaith House, in Balmore, Torrance, north of Glasgow. He was buried ten days later at Baldernock parish church near his home and beside his son Siggy, perhaps reflecting where his heart ultimately lay. By the time of his death he had raised the standard of television broadcasting to new heights through his research and communication skills, and through the most famous quiz programme of his generation. In her funeral oration for Magnusson, Vigdis Finnbogadottir said that 'he transformed the way the world saw Icelandic culture and civilisation' and that 'he was a cultural icon in both Britain and Iceland'. He demonstrated that a combination of intellect, hard work, meticulous preparation, and a winning smile could result in significant movement from entrenched positions. He galvanized a new approach to dealing with environmental conflicts in Scotland. And he made a more comprehensive contribution to communication and broadcasting than almost anyone of his generation.

Nolan, Michael Patrick, Baron Nolan (1928-2007), judge and first chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, was born on 10 September 1928 at 2 Woodside Avenue, North Finchley, Middlesex, the younger son and youngest of three children of James Thomas Nolan (1895-1955), motor engineer, later estate agent, and his wife, Jane Agnes, 'nee' Walsh (1894-1954). His siblings were Elizabeth 
(Betty; 1923-1940)
and James 
(Jim; 1925-2001)
. The branch of the Nolan family from which he was descended had been living in co. Kerry, Ireland, until they were driven out by the potato famine of the mid-nineteenth century. His grandfather took the family to England. 
Michael Nolan was brought up first in North Finchley and then at Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, where his parents went to live to look after his father's ailing parents in the mid-1930s. Nolan regarded his own parents, who were devout Roman Catholics, as the first and foremost influences on his life. By 1940 the family was back in their North Finchley home. He was educated at Ampleforth College. When he was studying there for the higher certificate his main subjects were Latin, Greek, and ancient history, with German and Spanish as further options. One other discipline he learned there from one of the monks was the art of fly-fishing. The passion for this remained with him throughout his life. It seems legitimate to infer that his devotion to the Roman Catholic faith was also firmly settled by the time he left school. This gave him the unshakeable personal integrity that was such a prominent feature of his adult character. He later said that although the teaching at Ampleforth was excellent, the most important things he learned there were self-confidence and the proper use of authority. Ampleforth with its wide Yorkshire landscape filled the gaps created by earlier years spent in towns and cities. He enjoyed Yorkshire village cricket as the captain of a school team called the Optimists and excelled at rifle shooting. 
After Ampleforth Nolan spent his two years' national service in the army (1947-9), ending with a commission in the Royal Artillery and duties in Germany. (His first preference had been the Irish Guards, but on interview the regimental colonel told him that there were vacancies only for those seeking a regular commission; his second choice, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, also never became a possibility.) He maintained his military links after national service with some six years of service in the Territorial Army (1949-55). Meanwhile in 1949 he went to Wadham College, Oxford, as a commoner. The original intention had been that he would read Greats under the watchful eye of Sir Maurice Bowra, the distinguished classical scholar who was warden of the college. But Greats took four years and Nolan was by then more attracted by a three-year course. It seems that the suggestion that he should select law as his subject came from his Ampleforth headmaster, Paul Nevill. Whatever the source of this selection it undoubtedly suited Nolan admirably, both intellectually and temperamentally. In his first term at Wadham, Peter Carter became the law tutor of the college. He had won the Croix de Guerre (with silver star) in Normandy, and subsequently developed a great reputation as a legal scholar and teacher. (He became an honorary bencher of the Middle Temple in 1981 and an honorary QC in 1990, no doubt with Nolan's backing.) Nolan graduated with a second in jurisprudence in 1952. 
After graduating Nolan went as a pupil into the chambers of Melford Stevenson (later a High Court judge). His pupil-master was Alan Orr (later a High Court judge and thereafter a lord justice of appeal). He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1953. On 9 April the same year he married Margaret Mary Noyes ('b'. 1932), the younger daughter of the poet Alfred Noyes and his second wife, Mary, 'nee' Mayne. In his uncompleted memoirs he related how he had gone to a ball without a partner. He was asked to look after a girl whose partner was smitten by flu and had to go home early. Nolan was not very pleased with the idea of looking after an unknown girl, his preference being to be a free agent. 'But then I saw Margaret, smiling at me across the room. As she will be the first to confirm, I have no gift at all for romantic words, in speech or in writing, so I simply state as a fact that I knew at once that I had found the love of my life. Margaret has the most beautiful smile in the world, and it has never ceased to gladden my heart, nor to remind me of the first time I saw her. (Michael Nolan, memorial address)' They had five children: Patricia ('b'. 1954), Michael ('b'. 1955), Sheila ('b'. 1957), Anne ('b'. 1959), and Clare ('b'. 1965). 
At the time Nolan qualified as a barrister it was notoriously difficult for a beginner to make much of an income at the common-law bar. He had to wait seven years before he could bank his first cheque. Even then he had a problem in deciding whether to frame it or bank it. This paucity of common-law work caused him to think that he might do better by joining one of the specialist bars. His reflections led him to choose the tax bar. He approached Cyril King, who was the head of a leading set. King invited him to tea in his chambers while making it clear that the decision must rest with the juniors. Nolan had tea with three of them. He was invited to have a second cup of tea. This was the moment of decision. Number 4 Pump Court became Nolan's chambers for the rest of his time at the bar. 
Nolan's career started slowly but he gradually built up a formidable tax practice. He became a wholly persuasive advocate with a calm and measured style, and with the habit of making the main points once and once only. He would have nothing to do with schemes for the avoidance of tax. His approach was invariably ethical and principled. His exceptional grasp of accounting fundamentals led to his appointment as a member of the Sandilands committee on inflation accounting (1973-5). 
Nolan took silk in 1968. When his work involved litigation in Northern Ireland he joined the bar there too in 1974. He also became a serious performer in Singapore and Hong Kong, fortuitously starting his career in each territory with a win on behalf of the Inland Revenue. These successes naturally stimulated further briefs from both sides of the line. He was made a bencher at the Middle Temple in 1975 and took an active part in the life of the inn and its committee work. He would have been an obvious choice to become treasurer of the Middle Temple had not the volume of his public duties rendered this impossible. 
In his practice Nolan had had no experience of dealing with the criminal law. To gain such experience he tried first to be appointed as a JP in Kent in order, as he put it, to see the criminal justice system from the bottom rung of the ladder. But no such appointment was forthcoming. So in 1975 he took the somewhat surprising step of applying to be appointed a recorder of the crown court. This would involve him annually in sitting for two to four weeks as a judge in a criminal court, trying cases, summing up the evidence to the jury, and sentencing those found guilty. His application was accepted and he duly sat for some seven years as a recorder. He trained himself diligently for the role by studying and sitting alongside colleagues who were recorders. He was given every assistance by both branches of the profession and by the officials who serviced the courts of the western circuit. He may have wanted to be appointed as a recorder in order to share the experience of his contemporaries at the bar. Moreover it may be that he contemplated the possibility that his name might one day come up for consideration as a candidate for a High Court judgeship and he did not want that possibility to be destroyed by the revelation that he had no knowledge of the substance and procedures of the criminal law. 
Nolan was indeed appointed as a judge of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in 1982. He sat as a judge for many years. Much of the work was routine but some high-profile cases came before him which provided the opportunity for the display of his cool and independent judgement. In 1984 he granted the National Coal Board injunctions against the use of flying pickets by the National Union of Mineworkers. The following year he awarded injunctions in favour of Westminster council restraining the Greater London council from using posters to persuade Londoners to back the fight against its own abolition. In 1989 he awarded Muslim leaders the right to challenge a JP's refusal to issue blasphemy summonses against Salman Rushdie, author of 'The Satanic Verses'. In another case he, controversially, sentenced a man who had raped his daughter to only three years in prison. No doubt Nolan believed that there were special circumstances that justified a more lenient sentence than would have been normal. But the appeal judges took a different view, and his sentence was set aside. In 1984 he was asked by the lord chief justice, Lord Lane, whether he would like to take on the job of being presiding judge on the western circuit. Nolan had never himself belonged to a circuit and had no idea what was involved. Lane explained: 'It is very simple. It means that if anything goes wrong on the Western Circuit you get the blame' (Mackay of Clashfern, memorial address). With this encouragement Nolan accepted. 
In 1991 Nolan was promoted to the Court of Appeal. He had caught the eye of the lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, when they had both served on a committee set up to simplify the tax system, in the early 1970s. As a lord justice of appeal he was involved in many cases that hit the headlines. He decided that an anorexic girl could be forcibly treated against her will. In another case he agreed with the court's decision to reject compensation claims for nervous shock brought by relatives of those who died in the Hillsborough football stadium disaster. In a case arising out of the deaths of fifty-one people in the 'Marchioness' riverboat disaster he refused to overturn the decision of the director of public prosecutions to bring no criminal charges. In an important case it was alleged against Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, that he had acted in contempt of court in failing to secure that a Nigerian citizen was brought back to the UK from Nigeria, since he had been aware of but had ignored an order made by a High Court judge that barred any attempt to return the would-be immigrant to Nigeria. Nolan was one of the majority in the Court of Appeal who upheld the finding of contempt against Baker, naming him personally. In the House of Lords the law lords accepted an argument to the effect that the contempt order should not name Baker personally but should be issued against the secretary of state for home affairs. 
In 1992 Nolan was a member of a Court of Appeal panel that decided in Judith Ward's case that the prosecution had failed in its duty to share with the defence evidence that tended to show weaknesses in the prosecution's case or which revealed that the defendant's mental state was such as to make her supposed confessions intrinsically unlikely to be true. The extent of the non-disclosures and the number of persons in the prosecution team who were guilty of reprehensible conduct led the court in its judgment to state that 'a grave miscarriage of justice had occurred' ('The Independent', 5 June 1992). This decision had a very significant effect on the manner in which all prosecutions were thereafter handled. 
In 1994 Nolan was promoted to the House of Lords as a lord of appeal in ordinary, with the title Baron Nolan. He took as his motto to accompany his shield the three words 'Fides, familia, lex', which aptly summarized his philosophy. Much of his time as a law lord was, however, taken up by his duties as the first chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (1994-7). The lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, had recommended to the prime minister, John Major, that Nolan was the best lawyer to take the chair of this new committee. The prime minister asked Mackay to ascertain whether Nolan would accept the appointment. His telephone response was immediate: 'If the Prime Minister wants me to do it, I certainly shall' (Mackay of Clashfern, memorial address). 
The prime minister had established the committee to deal with numerous charges of misconduct being made by members of the public and by the media against members of parliament. Most, but not all, charges were against Conservative MPs. One group of charges involved allegations that MPs took money in exchange for asking questions. A committee of nine members was appointed under Nolan's chairmanship with secretarial support. Three members represented the three major political parties, each being a serving MP or member of the House of Lords. The committee worked with extraordinary efficiency and collegiality. As Nolan insisted, all the reports produced by the committee during his term of office were unanimous. It took evidence from the public, from the media, and from experts. Evidence was taken orally in many parts of the country. The committee's hearings were held in public. There had been an episode soon after it was first appointed when a spokesman for the prime minister announced that the committee would probably sit in private. This led at once to a statement by Nolan that his committee would sit in public. That was what he was trained to do as a judge, he said, and he had no intention of altering his practice. 
Over a period of three years the committee worked on and took evidence leading to the publication of four reports: 'Standards in Public Life' (Cm 2850, 2 vols., May 1995); 'Local Public Spending Bodies' (Cm 3270, 2 vols., May 1996); 'Standards of Conduct in Local Government in England' (Cm 3702, 2 vols., July 1997); and 'Review of Standards of Conduct in Executive Non-Departmental Public Bodies, NHS Trusts and Local Public Spending Bodies' (no command paper number, 1 vol., Nov 1997). As its title indicated, the fourth report reviewed what had been the response by late 1997 to the first two reports. The report indicated that considerable and welcome progress had been made, though more needed to be done. 
It is clear that the first report was the most important. A striking feature was the promulgation in it of what were called the 'Seven Principles of Public Life', namely selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty, and leadership. The report stated that 'these principles apply to all aspects of public life. The Committee has set them out here for the benefit of all who serve the public in any way' ('Standards in Public Life', 14). Each principle had an explanatory text. For example, selflessness, which was the first principle, was described as follows: 'Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends' (ibid.). The other reports produced when Nolan was chairman all repeated the seven principles in a prominent position. The principles became well known and widely reproduced, sometimes with additions. 
The prime minister had when appointing the committee asked that it should produce its first report within six months. Nolan responded to this by saying that the available time did not permit the committee to cover the entire field in six months, so it confined its first report to the three subjects which appeared to be giving rise to the greatest public concern, namely issues relating to members of parliament; ministers and civil servants; and executive quangos and NHS bodies. As Nolan reported in a letter of May 1995 to the prime minister, published at the front of the report, the public consultation which the committee undertook confirmed that it had correctly chosen the three areas which gave rise to the greatest public concern. The experienced parliamentarians and other eminent persons who were the nine members of the committee admired the calm and gentle style of their chairman. Without making any fuss he managed to steer the debate towards his own conclusions. As one member put it, 'he was endlessly gentle and courteous in his handling of the committee, allowing everyone to have their say, never showing any sign of impatience' (private information). Another member confirmed that Nolan gave excellent leadership and deserved the fullest credit for the respect the committee enjoyed and for the standing that its reports subsequently had: 'Certainly I found it a matter of pride but also something which did command wide respect -- the simple statement that 'I was a member of the Nolan Committee'' (private information). 
When the first report was published it was well received by the public. But some of those who were criticized in the report (such as members of parliament) were highly critical. They claimed that they were represented as acting like criminals. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, declared that Nolan seemed to lack a certain 'worldliness' ('The Times', 19 May 1995). Nolan, however, was quite impervious to such criticism and simply carried on with his work on the next three reports. The public was impressed. The House of Commons decided to implement the recommendations that concerned it; and the omnipresent sleaze that had been gaining ground in the early 1990s suffered a serious check (albeit to resurface in the form of the abuse of parliamentary expenses in the following decade). 
Nolan retired as a lord of appeal in ordinary in 1998, having reached the age of seventy. He seldom spoke in debates on the floor of the house. When he did so the speech or intervention tended to be linked to matters of which he had personal knowledge from his time on the bench. He remained an interception of communications commissioner until 2002, having been appointed in 1994. The last task he undertook in relation to the setting of standards was carried out at the request of the archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor. Many cases had been reported in the media in the 1990s where Catholic priests were charged with sexual abuse of children. In some instances the abuse had continued over a period of years and had resulted in grave trauma for the children. In 2000 the cardinal asked Nolan to investigate child protection in the Catholic church in England and Wales and to report, giving his recommendations for cleansing the stables. He immediately undertook the task with a committee. His first report was published in 2001. The tone was set by an early paragraph in this report: 'Child abuse is a great evil. It can leave deep scars on victims and their families. It is particularly abhorrent when a child or young person is abused by someone in a position of trust and responsibility. It is most abhorrent when that position of trust is held by a member of the clergy or a lay Church worker. The care of children is at the forefront of the teachings of Christ and is, therefore, one of the primary responsibilities of all members of the Church led by their priests and bishops.' The report made some fifty recommendations, including fundamental provisions to the effect that there should be an investigation into the background of every person who wanted to serve the church in any capacity who might come into contact with children. All with doubtful backgrounds should be denied employment and all contact. Those who appeared innocent but who were subsequently alleged to have transgressed should be debarred from contact subject to a full investigation of the allegations.Nolan was a member of the Bar Council for 1973-4 and a member of the senate of the inns of court and the bar for seven years (1974-81), for two of which (1977-9) he held the office of treasurer. He was a member of the governing body of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Woldingham (1973-83), and a governor of Combe Bank School (1974-83). He was an honorary fellow of Wadham College from 1992, chairman of the board of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies from 1994 to 2000, and from 1997 to 2002 he was chancellor of Essex University, well known for his 'hands-on' approach in the role. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Essex (1996), Surrey (1996), Warwick (1998), Exeter (1998), Middlesex (1999), and Bournemouth (2000). In 2002 he was made a knight of St George. In 1996-7 he and Sir Stephen Sedley gave between them six Radcliffe lectures (three each) at the University of Warwick. The series was entitled 'The making and remaking of the British constitution'. Geoffrey Wilson delivered a postscript and the entire collection was published. 
A contemporary from Oxford (not himself from Ampleforth or on the Nolan committee) observed: 'I think what characterised Michael was always a quiet and courteously managed certainty in all that he undertook'. While lacking proof he was inclined to identify Nolan's time at Ampleforth as providing the engine for this. 'Michael was a very faithful Roman Catholic, and one became aware of this and -- I think -- of an inner strength of mind and purpose deriving from it -- the better one got to know him' (private information). Lord Lloyd of Berwick wrote that 'Michael was a marvellous judge to sit with. Like Denning, he had a clarity of mind, and simplicity of language which few have equalled. Of all the judges I have known, he was the least ostentatious' ('The Guardian', 26 Jan 2007). 
Nolan died at his home, Old Farm Cottage, Scords Lane, Toys Hill, Westerham, Kent, on 22 January 2007 of bronchopneumonia and multi-system atrophy, having had to endure a progressive degenerative disease that ultimately took away even his capacity to speak, leaving only the ability to smile. It was appropriate that a splendid memorial service should have been held on 22 March 2007 at Westminster Cathedral with Cardinal Murphy O'Connor presiding. In his homily he expressed his 'great admiration, esteem and gratitude for someone who did the Church a great service, but did it in such a way that it seemed the most natural thing for him to do'. The congregation was asked by the cardinal to 'remember and pray for the repose of the soul of this good man, Michael Nolan' (Cardinal Murphy O'Connor, homily). Nolan was survived by his wife, Margaret, and their five children, three of whom followed careers in the law.

Ridley, Walter John (1913-2007), songwriter and record producer, was born at 23 Medburn Street, St Pancras, London, on 28 February 1913, the eldest of five children of Walter Ernest Ridley, at the time a cloth worker's salesman, later a furniture dealer, and his wife, Edith Elizabeth Rose, 'nee' Sutton. He started piano lessons when he was six and was soon demonstrating the instruments his father sold in his furniture store in Camden Town. In 1926 he won a scholarship to the Northern Polytechnic, London, to study piano manufacture. When he was fifteen he joined the music publisher Feldmans to demonstrate songs to stage and radio performers. His first composition, written with the veteran music hall composer Harry Castling, 'One Little Hair on his Head', was recorded by Gracie Fields. By 1935 he was a manager at another publisher, Peter Maurice, and he promoted Michael Carr and Jimmy Kennedy, helping them without credit (according to his testimony) to write the standards 'Dinner for One Please, James' and 'Did Your Mother Come from Ireland?' He matched 'Home Town' with the Crazy Gang comedians Bud Flanagan and Chesney Allen, and he wrote 'My Way' for the Paul Robeson film 'Jericho' (1937). On 15 April 1939 he married Libuse (Liba) Izerova (1918-1997), a secretary, born in Czechoslovakia, daughter of Cyril Izer, tailor. They had one son and two daughters. 
Because of suspected tuberculosis Ridley was exempted from military service during the Second World War, but his contribution to the war effort was considerable. He coached a young singer, Vera Lynn, thereby expanding her range. He produced her radio series, 'Sincerely Yours', which made her the Forces' Sweetheart, and found her biggest success, 'We'll Meet Again'. He was impressed with a Canadian army captain based in Britain, Robert Farnon, and promoted his talent. 
In 1948 Ridley persuaded the BBC to broadcast a radio series live from a theatre. The series starred Donald Peers, and his signature tune, again found by Ridley, was 'Powder Your Face with Sunshine'. Ridley expected the BBC to mock his suggestion of a radio series featuring a ventriloquist, but 'Educating Archie' with Archie Andrews and Peter Brough captured twenty million listeners and made household names of Beryl Reid, Max Bygraves, Harry Secombe, and Tony Hancock. Later in 1948 Ridley joined EMI Records to establish a popular catalogue for the HMV label. The label, restricted by shellac shortages, only had regular releases from Joe Loss and George Melachrino and their orchestras. Soon Ridley was having success with Peers, Bygraves, Ronnie Hilton, and Malcolm Vaughan. There was also Alma Cogan, known as 'the girl with the giggle', another of Ridley's suggestions. In 1955 a tearful Jeannie Carson told Ridley that she needed a decent song, 'something like 'The Trolley Song'' (made famous by Judy Garland), for a film she was making, 'An Alligator Named Daisy'. Ridley wrote 'I'm in Love for the Very First Time'. 
At EMI Ridley had to determine which records from America's RCA Victor label were right for release in the UK. In 1956 he released Elvis Presley's 'Heartbreak Hotel', and EMI nearly sacked him. However, the public bought the record and it went to number two. Although he tried with Don Lang and Bert Weedon, Ridley knew that British artists couldn't capture that sound and he had his main success with middle of the road ballads, producing 'St Therese of the Roses' for Malcolm Vaughan and 'No Other Love' for Ronnie Hilton. They fitted Ridley's maxim that if a song was well written, had a clear, clean message, and was delivered with sincerity with a good quality performance, good orchestra, and good sound, it would sell and sell. His first venture into rock 'n' roll was with Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, who topped the UK charts in 1960 with 'Shakin' All Over'. The British beat explosion of the mid-1960s was not for him but he did produce top ten hits by the Swingin' Blue Jeans, including 'Hippy Hippy Shake' (1963). 
When a music publisher asked Ridley to cover an American song, 'Mad Passionate Love' (1958), he expected the song to be taken seriously, but Ridley placed it with the comic actor Bernard Bresslaw, whose lugubrious delivery made it a hit. Ridley worked with many comedians, finding Morecambe and Wise's signature tune, 'Bring Me Sunshine', and producing Max Bygraves's 'Gilly Gilly Ossenfeffer Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea' (1954), Benny Hill's 'Ernie (the Fastest Milkman in the West)' (1971), and Windsor Davies and Don Estelle's 'Whispering Grass' (1975). He also produced big-selling albums by the Black and White Minstrel Show as well as recording the Deep River Boys, Andy Stewart, Iris Williams, and the Mike Sammes Singers. 
In retirement Ridley undertook occasional projects, producing, for example, 'Love is Jose Carreras' (1984). He won two Ivor Novello awards for his contributions to the music industry. He died at his home, Vermala, Southlea Road, Datchet, Berkshire, on 23 January 2007, of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was survived by his three children.

Akehurst, Sir John Bryan (1930-2007), army officer, was born on 12 February 1930 at Marlow, Harsted Avenue, Chatham, Kent, the only child of Geoffrey Guy Akehurst (1901-1956), bank cashier, later bank manager, and his wife, Doris Jessie, 'nee' Kerwin (1903-1990). Educated at Cranbrook School, Kent, he enlisted in the army as a private soldier in 1947. The following year he was selected to attend the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst; he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Northamptonshire regiment on 16 December 1949. In 1952, after two years' service in Trieste, he volunteered to be seconded to the Malay regiment, serving as a lieutenant with its 5th battalion in operations against communist guerillas and gaining a mention in dispatches. With promotion to captain, he married, on 18 May 1955 in Malaya, Shirley Ann Webb ('b'. 1935/6), daughter of Major W. G. Webb, a Malayan civil servant. Their two children died young, of cystic fibrosis. 
Between 1956 and 1960 Akehurst resumed duties with the Northamptonshire regiment, serving in Hong Kong and England. He attended the Staff College, Camberley, in 1961, earning a posting the following year as brigade major to 12 infantry brigade in the British army of the Rhine. In 1965 he was a company commander with the 2nd Royal Anglian regiment in Cyprus before being recalled to the staff college to join the directing staff there. Early in 1968, after two years at Camberley, he was given command of the 2nd Royal Anglian regiment. As part of 19 infantry brigade in the strategic reserve his battalion had to be ready to serve anywhere at short notice; and over the next two and a half years, besides participating in exercises in Cyprus, Kenya, and Malaysia, it was also called upon -- at a time of Spanish sabre-rattling in 1968-9 -- to reinforce Gibraltar. Between 1970 and 1974 he was successively on the directing staff of the Royal Defence College in London and, newly promoted to colonel, commandant of the junior division of the Staff College at Warminster. By now he had long been regarded as a man of promise: his confidential report acknowledged that while the best officers should appear able to do their job one-handed: 'With John, however, I have sometimes heard a whisper of 'Look, no hands!'' ('Generally Speaking', 150). 
In January 1974 Akehurst was chosen to command the Dhofar brigade in the sultan of Oman's service. The brigade, British-officered but otherwise comprising Omani and Baluchi troops, was embroiled in a nine-year-long civil war in Oman's Dhofar province against communist-inspired tribesmen backed by neighbouring South Yemen. After his arrival in south Arabia, a chance conversation with a Special Air Service non-commissioned officer, who told him that the 'firqats' -- groups of rebels who had surrendered and taken up arms for the sultan -- were eager to return to their tribal areas, led Akehurst to initiate a strategy 'to secure Dhofar for civil development' ('We Won a War', 65). He would capture rebel-held territory, drill water holes for the 'firqats'' cattle, create the beginnings of villages, and -- after warning the 'firqats' that if the rebels reappeared the water supply would be cut off -- left them to it. Writing to London on 4 November 1974, the British ambassador in Oman was enthusiastic: 'John Akehurst's decision to get the Firqat back into their own tribal areas and to take responsibility for them instead of sheltering in strong points... seems to be paying off' (TNA: PRO, FCO 8/2216). Later, in the final push for victory in October 1975, Akehurst showed his ability to exploit a fast-changing tactical situation. A diversionary attack launched from the mountain fastness of Sarfait having achieved unexpected results, he promptly ripped up his plans and reinforced success instead. 'Meet your flexible brigadier', he smilingly announced (Jeapes, 223). The war was now won, although on Christmas day 1975 rebel gunfire was still capable of forcing down Akehurst's helicopter. 
Akehurst moved to the Ministry of Defence as deputy military secretary in 1976 and, as a major-general, commanded 4th armoured division in Germany in 1979-81. His subsequent term as commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, was considered notably successful. In 1984, on promotion to lieutenant-general as commander, United Kingdom field army, and inspector, general territorial army, he was created KCB. His last appointment, in 1987-90, as a full general, was as deputy supreme allied commander Europe, 'the perfect bridge between working and not working', as Akehurst, who believed that the position carried little influence, described it ('Generally speaking', 208). 
In retirement Akehurst wrote an amusing memoir, 'Generally Speaking' (1999). He achieved wider public recognition as an expert on BBC TV's 'Newsnight' during the Gulf War of 1990-91. The 'Sunday Times', in a poll on the performance of war pundits in the media, awarded him 10/10. He lived at Dresden Cottage, 46 Vicarage Street, Warminster, Wiltshire, which he had bought in 1981. In retirement he was involved in many organizations, including as a member of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (1993-8), chairman of the governors of Harrow School (1991-7) and Princecroft primary school, Warminster (1995-2000), and president of the Warminster Civic Trust (1998-2007). He died on 20 February 2007 at the Royal United Hospital, Bath, after a stroke, and was survived by his wife, Shirley. A memorial service was held in the Royal Memorial Chapel, Sandhurst, on 3 June 2007.

Bowie, Malcolm McNaughtan (1943-2007), scholar of French and comparative literature, was born on 5 May 1943 at 1 Hollesley Villa, Saxmundham Road, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, the elder of two children (both sons) of George Alexander Bowie ('b'. 1913), a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and his wife, Beatrice Georgina (Betty), 'nee' Strowger ('b'. 1920). On discharge from the army his father trained as a psychiatric nurse and eventually, in partnership with his wife, became superintendent of a home for psychiatrically infirm elderly people in Aldeburgh. Bowie grew up in the Aldeburgh area; his secondary education was at Woodbridge School. Intrigued by the children's books his father had brought back from war service in France, he warmed to French at school and chose to study French and English at Edinburgh University. On 30 August 1964, while still a student, he married, at the West Central Liberal Synagogue, London, Eva Zwalf, a 21-year-old graduate student of English, and daughter of Meyer Zwalf, research economist. Having graduated with a first in 1965, he studied for a DPhil at Sussex University, focusing on the complex verbal and visual universe of the poet Henri Michaux, and thus launching a lifelong engagement with what he saw as the transformative power of poetic language. 
While writing his thesis Bowie served for two years as assistant lecturer at the University of East Anglia (1967-9), and was then appointed lecturer at the University of Cambridge and fellow of Clare College (1969-76). At Cambridge he formed close associations with Lloyd Austin, the Drapers professor of French, and Alison Fairlie, fellow of Girton, leading scholars of nineteenth-century French poetry. These friendships continued to flourish after his appointment, in 1976, to a professorship at Queen Mary College, London. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 17 March 1979 he married Alison Mary Finch ('b'. 1948), daughter of Joseph Finch, schoolteacher. A fellow literary scholar, then carrying out pioneering work on Proust's manuscripts, Alison Finch had studied with Alison Fairlie at Girton and was a university lecturer and French fellow at Churchill College. The union was exceptionally happy and well balanced (Bowie was a natural feminist). They lived in Cambridge, Bowie commuting to London; they had a son, Sam, and a daughter, Jessica. 
Bowie's second book, 'Mallarme and the Art of Being Difficult' (1978), confirmed his exceptional gifts as a reader of literary texts, while also revealing another of his enduring strengths, the conviction that the new critical theories emanating from Paris could contribute significantly to the understanding of complex literary works. While showing what Julia Kristeva, Roland Barthes, or Michel Serres could bring to the reading of Mallarme, Bowie took up the challenge of interpreting the difficult and often abstruse psychoanalytic thought of Jacques Lacan for a non-specialist audience, providing an incisive essay in John Sturrock's 'Structuralism and Since' (1979), and later a pellucid monograph, 'Lacan', in the 'Fontana Modern Masters' series (1991). While from this point on non-doctrinaire psychoanalysis provided some of the impetus for Bowie's writing, his wide and eclectic reading in philosophy, art history, and musicology (music was an abiding passion) helped him forge a unique and multifaceted critical idiom. His remarkable virtuosity as a prose stylist emerged fully at this juncture, for example in the scintillating inaugural lecture he delivered at Queen Mary College in 1978, 'Proust, jealousy, knowledge', incorporated as a chapter of his third book, 'Freud, Proust and Lacan: Theory as Fiction' (1987), where the three writers are seen as 'portraitists of the mental life' (p. 7) and as theorists of desire. 
As head of the French department at Queen Mary, Bowie progressively involved himself in the affairs of London University while establishing his position as a figurehead for French studies in the UK, a role he retained for the rest of his life. From 1980 to 1987 he succeeded Austin as general editor of 'French Studies', the leading journal in the discipline, and also in 1980 became founding general editor of 'Cambridge Studies in French', a monograph series that, for the next fifteen years, published a stream of outstanding books (forty-two in all), each benefiting from his painstaking advice, and at their best characterized by the editor's own ability to combine meticulous scholarship with new critical vistas. In 1983 he was instrumental in the creation of the Modern Critical Theory Group and its journal, 'Paragraph', which became a leader in its field. He showed a similar dynamism when in 1989 he persuaded the University of London to establish the Institute for Romance Languages. Almost overnight the institute, subsequently subsumed into London's School of Advanced Study, was buzzing with the cross-disciplinary energies Bowie increasingly came to incarnate. Stepping down from the headship and other administrative burdens at Queen Mary, Bowie, as founding director (1989-92), made the institute's premises on the third floor of Senate House his headquarters, presiding over a dazzling range of lectures and colloquia that brought world-class quality to the sometimes parochial world of modern languages in Britain. 
In 1992 Bowie was appointed to the Marshal Foch professorship of French literature at Oxford and became a fellow of All Souls. From 1995 to 2002 he was actively involved in the recently established European Humanities Research Centre at Oxford, serving as director from 1998 to 2002, and setting up its imprint, Legenda. Under his guidance Legenda developed monograph series in various European literatures, including Yiddish, as well as in comparative literature, and became a leading academic publisher of outstanding work across modern languages and beyond. At All Souls, and in the sub-faculty of French, he organized numerous high-level research seminars, inviting distinguished critics to Oxford, including speakers at the annual Zaharoff lecture connected with the Foch chair, and the holders of the Weidenfeld visiting professorship in European comparative literature, which he helped to inaugurate. Once he had settled in, the family moved to Oxford, Alison becoming a fellow of Jesus, and then of Merton College. During his Oxford years Bowie was made a fellow of the British Academy (1993) and the Royal Society of Literature (1999) and served as president of the Society for French Studies (1994-6) and the British Comparative Literature Association (1998-2002). 
Bowie's decade in Oxford saw the fruition of his many years of close study of Proust. Building on the insights of 'Freud, Proust and Lacan', and the essays collected in 'Psychoanalysis and the Future of Theory' (1993), which include a marvellous chapter on the 'European unconscious' that placed Freud in his cultural and historical context by way of interconnections with Mahler and Schoenberg, he progressively composed his masterly 'Proust among the Stars', published to great acclaim in 1998 and awarded the Truman Capote award for literary criticism in 2001. Bowie's 'Proust' is the work of a supreme stylist. On page after page, elegant and enriching formulations of the essentials of Proust's achievement, gathered under plain headings ('Self', 'Time', 'Art', 'Politics', 'Morality', 'Sex', 'Death'), incite readers to refine their appreciation of the multitudinous ways in which Proust's alter ego charts 'the inscrutable inwardness of human desire' (p. 327). Bowie's contribution (on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries) to 'A Short History of French Literature' (2003), co-written with Sarah Kay and Terence Cave, placed Proust in a wider context and demonstrated afresh the breadth as well as the depth of Bowie's knowledge of French literature (a breadth apparent from the beginning of his career in the range of his reviewing). At Oxford he was able to give full rein to his outstanding qualities as a doctoral supervisor. As Clive Scott noted, he 'encouraged in his students not only the adventurousness and fearlessness of his own thinking, but attention to the revelations of textual detail, and scrupulous scholarship' ('The Independent', 5 Feb 2007). Scott added that 'there are many academic careers that have prospered thanks to his careful and caring guidance' (ibid.), an observation that applied more widely to the many younger colleagues for whom Bowie served as an ideal older brother, unfailingly generous with his time, sagacious in his advice, and delightfully amusing in conversation (as with everyone: a colleague remarked of him that he was able to make the most boring meeting seem fun). 
In 2002 Bowie returned to Cambridge to be master of Christ's College, where he took pleasure in welcoming visitors to the college of Milton and Darwin and relished his role in spearheading the college's celebrations of its 500th anniversary in 2005. He proved a popular master, held in esteem and affection by fellows and students alike. But his tenure was short-lived. In 2004 he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable form of cancer. A bone-marrow operation offered the possibility of lengthy remission but the disease returned and he stood down from the mastership two months before he died, at Arthur Rank House, a hospice in Cambridge, on 28 January 2007. His funeral took place at Cambridge crematorium on 7 February. He was survived by his wife, Alison, and their two children. In 2008 the Society for French Studies inaugurated an annual Malcolm Bowie prize for the best article published by a young researcher in the field of French studies. 
The uncomplaining fortitude and good humour with which Bowie had carried on his work after the diagnosis were entirely characteristic. Visitors to the master's lodge observed the enduring delight he evidently took in the powers of literature, thought, and art, as well as the joy he derived from his family life. In the wake of his work on Mallarme and Proust he had come to give increasing prominence to music and painting. In the outstanding programme notes he wrote for Covent Garden, essays on Mallarme and Debussy, or Proust and Italian painters, or in his last publication, a magnificent review of books on the German Lied for the 'Times Literary Supplement', he articulated a broad and generous vision of the humanities, whose cause he sought to advance with great urgency in his last years. 'Why Art Matters', the title of a symposium in his honour, held in Cambridge in December 2005, summed up the essence of Bowie's legacy. Through the power and originality of his intellect, the warmth and generosity of his personality, the flair and commitment with which he created contexts where research could flourish, and through the brilliance and humanity of his writing, Bowie was not only the leading figure in French studies of his generation but a scholar of lasting importance in the wider fields of literary and cultural study.

Clarke, Peter William Hanwell (1948-2007), social worker and children's commissioner, was born on 7 October 1948 at the Maternity Home, Oxford Road, Llandudno, Caernarvonshire, the son of William Arthur Clarke, a captain in the army, and his wife, Jean Barbara, 'nee' Hanwell. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 2 Abbey Road, Llandudno. He attended fourteen schools, owing to his father's peripatetic life. He withdrew from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after six months when he realized he was only doing what was expected of him and started work as an untrained social worker at Stamford remand centre, London, before reading philosophy and politics at Sussex University, while working in an old people's home at night. He then graduated MA in philosophy, again at Sussex. After qualifying as a social worker at Warwick University he became a field social worker in London and Brighton. In 1985 he joined the Spastics Society as a community care adviser. In 1987 he married Jennifer Mary (Jenny) Thompson; they had two sons, Liam and Bryn. 
Clarke moved back to Wales in 1991 to become the first director of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship Wales. In 1995 he became head of ChildLine Cymru, a twenty-four hour helpline for children. His own childhood gave him empathy with many of the children with whom he worked. There had been, he admitted, 'difficulties' about which he preferred not to speak. This personal attachment to those with whom he worked was perhaps allowed its fullest expression when, in March 2001, he was appointed children's commissioner for Wales, the first children's commissioner in the UK. 
Between 1997 and 2000 an inquiry headed by Sir Ronald Waterhouse had investigated abuse in children's homes in north Wales and its report recommended that such a post be created. Countries in Europe and elsewhere had established children's ombudsmen (the first post was created in Norway in 1981) but the idea had been rejected by successive UK governments. Following the Waterhouse report the government relented (but stipulated that the commissioner and his staff be funded by the Welsh Assembly). After the Welsh post came into being others followed in Scotland in 2004 and Northern Ireland in 2007. In 2005 a children's commissioner's role was created in England but in a far more circumscribed form. Clarke's passion, and his involvement of children and young people in his job, underpinned by his independence and considerable powers, set the tone for the others. 
As well as the more obvious children's issues -- health, education, and social services -- Clarke was charged with considering planning, transport, the environment, economic development, and rural affairs. He also had the power to consider and make representations to the Welsh Assembly on any matter he deemed to affect children's rights and welfare in Wales. When 'listening to children' was too often honoured in the breach than the practice, Clarke showed consistently how children and young people could influence services for the better (he pioneered using children for the commission's appointments panels). He used the means by which children and young people communicated -- including emails, message boards, and texting by mobile phone -- to draw them in. He set up an advice line that children could call any time. 
Clarke was tireless in his advocacy of children's rights. In 2004 he said that an additional $700,000 for what were then the new child and adolescent mental health services in Wales was welcome but 'totally inadequate' in the face of the growing crisis in provision ('Times Educational Supplement', 19 Nov 2004). Just before he died he was threatening legal action against the assembly on how it took decisions about children. In 'Telling Concerns' (2003) he reviewed social services departments, and he produced practice guides on whistleblowing, children's advocacy, and children's complaints, as well as training materials. Like his other publications, these were written in formats accessible to children and young people. His major inquiry was the 'Clywch' inquiry ('clywch', significantly, being the Welsh command to listen) into child sexual abuse at Rhydfelen secondary school. This was published in 2004 and resulted in new safeguards for children in Wales and influenced thinking elsewhere in the UK. In addition to his work in Wales Clarke was involved at a UK level with the Family Justice Council and other bodies, and was president of the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children (ENOC) in 2005-6. He was also a board member of Voices from Care. 
Young people were frequently characterized, Clarke opined, as 'angels or demons and rarely as human beings' ('South Wales Evening Post', 21 May 2005). He believed that the failure of systems, procedures, and professionals stemmed from a failure to allow the needs and rights of children and young people the same importance as those of adults. By making respect the foundation of his own work he provided a model of a children's advocate and of a good service for children. Even after being diagnosed with lung cancer he remained fully committed to his role and continued to speak up for children's rights. He died at Ty Bryngwyn Hospice, Prince Philip Hospital, Llanelli, on 21 January 2007, and was survived by his wife, Jenny, and their two sons.

Ellenshaw, Peter (1913-2007), special effects artist and landscape painter, was born William Samuel Cook Ellenshaw at 76 Chatham Road, Battersea, London, on 24 May 1913, the son of Adeline Eyles. His mother was named on his birth certificate as Alice Ellenshaw, formerly Eyles, and his father as William Ellenshaw, engine driver at a laundry. The origin of the name Ellenshaw was unknown to him and he always understood that his father was James S. Alcock (died 1921), an Irishman whose family came from Enniscorthy, co. Wexford, who had once owned a silver mine in Rico, Colorado, but now operated a laundry in the Wandsworth area. Although the names William Samuel appeared on official documents well into his adult life, he was known as Peter from childhood. He had two older sisters (registered as Eyles), Dorothy and Lulu, with whom he was evacuated during the First World War to Vange, Essex. At one point he briefly attended a preparatory school in Deal, Kent. He acquired a younger half-sister, Irene, after his mother married Edward James Hook, a gardener, in 1920. Sent to school in Chipstead, Surrey, he left at the age of fourteen and worked as a garage mechanic. 
A talented, self-taught amateur artist, Ellenshaw spent his evenings making copies of paintings by the old masters that earned the encouragement of the Royal Academician Walter Percy ('Pop') Day (1878-1965), a pioneering special effects artist at Alexander Korda's London Films. Day specialized in creating hand-painted mattes: paintings on large sheets of glass which, suspended in front of the camera, or double exposed, created the illusion of scenery, thus obviating the need for elaborate sets or location filming. Day became Ellenshaw's mentor and, in the early 1930s, engaged him as his apprentice; Ellenshaw gave uncredited assistance with the creation of mattes for films including 'The Scarlet Pimpernel' (1934), 'Things to Come' (1936), 'Fire over England' (1937), 'The Four Feathers' (1939), and 'The Thief of Baghdad' (1940). The closeness of Ellenshaw's relationship with his employer led to his introducing his mother, Adeline, to the widowed Day. She left James Hook and moved in with him, initially as his 'cook', although she subsequently adopted his surname, and in 1953 they married. 
Ellenshaw joined the Civil Air Guard in 1938, and served as a fighter pilot in the RAF during the Second World War. In 1941 he was posted to Albany, Georgia, USA, for training. There he met Bobbie Palmer (died 2000), a nurse at the Lawson General Hospital. They married in 1942 and had a son, Peter (known as Harrison), and a daughter, Lynda. On demobilization he returned to work with Day, most notably on three films produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 'A Matter of Life and Death' (1946, chosen for Britain's first charity royal film performance), 'Black Narcissus' (1947), and 'The Red Shoes' (1948). 
Ellenshaw's long association with Walt Disney began in 1947, when he undertook the matte paintings for the producer's first live-action film, 'Treasure Island' (1950), filmed in England. The tutelage of Day paid off and Ellenshaw created highly convincing shots of Bristol harbour crowded with three-masted schooners as well as giving the English locations the appearance of an exotic Caribbean island. In an era before computer-created effects the work of the matte artist was indispensable and Ellenshaw's ability to render paintings with a photographic realism resulted in his becoming rapidly established as a master of the craft. 
The success of Ellenshaw's work on 'Treasure Island' led to his painting a vista of ancient Rome for Mervyn LeRoy's MGM epic 'Quo vadis?' (1951) and two more projects for Disney that involved a year's work painting fifty-two and sixty-two matte paintings respectively for 'The Story of Robin Hood and his Merrie Men' (1952) and 'The Sword and the Rose' (1953). The skill with which he discharged this huge undertaking resulted in his moving to California in 1953 to enter into an exclusive contract with Walt Disney Productions, although this did not prevent his taking on occasional uncredited jobs for other studios, including more scenes of ancient Rome, this time for Stanley Kubrick's 'Spartacus' (1960). 
Between 1953 and 1979 Ellenshaw painted the mattes for every live-action film Disney produced (some thirty-four in total) as well as contributing to the concept art and special effects for many films and, on some titles, acting as production designer. Significant work included the underwater sequences in '20,000 Leagues under the Sea' (1954), which were shot in the demanding format of Cinemascope; the astonishing sequences set in the underground leprechaun kingdom in 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People' (1959); and the vertigo-inducing alpine landscapes of 'Third Man on the Mountain' (1959). Among other notable films to which he contributed were 'Swiss Family Robinson' (1960), 'Kidnapped' (1960), 'In Search of the Castaways' (1962), and 'Summer Magic' (1963). Between films he worked on Disney's television shows, including 'Davy Crockett' (1955), 'Zorro' (1957-60), and 'Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color' (1955-65). He also painted one of the first aerial maps of Disneyland, featured on early guidebooks and postcards, as well as contributing to the design of several attractions at the theme park. 
Ellenshaw won an Academy award (or Oscar) for best visual effects for his work on 'Mary Poppins' (1964), which memorably featured the title character's flight across the skyline of Edwardian London, the 'feed the birds' sequence set around St Paul's Cathedral, and the rooftop antics of the chimneysweeps, whose dance number, 'Step in Time', was inspired by his recounted memories of the London pub dance 'Knees Up, Mother Brown'. He was Oscar-nominated three more times, for 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' (1971), on which he served as art director, and for 'The Island at the Top of the World' (1974) and 'The Black Hole' (1979), on both of which he acted as production designer. 
Throughout his career Ellenshaw painted powerful landscapes and seascapes, notably of the south-west coast of Ireland (where he kept a holiday home), the Mojave Desert, the American Pacific coastline, and the Himalayas. After his official retirement in 1979 he devoted more time to his paintings, which fetched high prices at leading New York galleries, although, with a defensiveness born out of his lack of formal art training, he disarmingly confessed that 'sophisticates think they're corny' ('New York Sun', 15 Feb 2007). He came out of retirement to work with his son, providing mattes for 'Superman IV: the Quest for Peace' (1987) and Disney's 'Dick Tracy' (1990). He also contributed somewhat over-prettified paintings of scenes from Disney animated films, which became a line of best-selling lithographs for the Disney studio's merchandising arm. Designated a 'Disney legend' in 1993, Ellenshaw was a man of huge charm who concealed a considerable ego beneath a cloak of self-effacing modesty. He died at his home in Santa Barbara, California, on 12 February 2007 and was survived by his two children, both of whom had followed him into the film industry, Harrison as an Oscar-nominated visual effects artist and Lynda as a visual effects producer.

Franca, Celia (1921-2007), ballet dancer, choreographer, and ballet director, was born on 25 June 1921 at 57 Nicholas Street, Mile End, London, the daughter of Solomon Franks, boot salesman, later ladies' outfitter, and his wife, Gertie, 'nee' Feigenbaum. Her parents were of Jewish descent. She started dance lessons at the age of four, and won scholarships to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Royal Academy of Dance. She made her professional debut as a tap dancer in the musical comedy 'Spread It Abroad', aged fourteen. Its choreographer, Walter Gore, recommended her to Marie Rambert, and she joined the Ballet Rambert in 1936, also attending Rambert's school, where she was taught by Stanislas Idzikowsky, Vera Volkova, and Antony Tudor. Having adopted the stage name Celia Franca, over the next few years she danced in over two dozen ballets with the company, including Tudor's acclaimed 'Jardin aux lilas' (1936) and 'Dark Elegies' (1937), and his 'Suite of Airs' (1937, broadcast on television), a revival of Frederick Ashton's 'Les masques' (playing both the wife and the lady friend), Frank Staff's 'Peter and the Wolf' (1940), and work by Ninette de Valois, Andree Howard, and others. She also produced her own choreography, notably 'Constanza's Lament' (1938), to Beethoven's music, and 'Midas' (1939) to a score by Elizabeth Lutyens. 
Following the closure of Ballet Rambert in 1941 as a result of the disruption of the Second World War, and after a brief engagement with the International Ballet, Franca joined Sadler's Wells, initially replacing the injured June Brae. Among her most notable roles were as the Queen in Robert Helpmann's 'Hamlet' (1942), the Prostitute in his 'Miracle in the Gorbals' (1944), Wrath in Ashton's 'The Quest' (1943), and the Spider in Howard's 'Le festin de l'araignee' (1944). She was reputed by many to be the company's best dramatic dancer. For Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet (when the main company moved to Covent Garden she decided she would be bored by three months of 'Sleeping Beauty', so did not follow) she choreographed 'Khadra' (1946), to Sibelius's music, and 'Bailemos' (1947) to Massenet's. In 1947 she joined the small Metropolitan Ballet as soloist and ballet mistress, choreographing 'Dance of Salome' (1949) and 'Eve of St Agnes' (1950), both televised. After performances with the Ballet Workshop she then returned briefly to Ballet Rambert. Meanwhile, on 27 February 1941, at Watford register office, she had married a fellow Ballet Rambert dancer, Leo Kersley ('b'. 1920), son of Edwin Charles Kersley, art dealer. They subsequently divorced, but remained close friends. 
In 1950 Ninette de Valois was asked to recommend someone to run a new national Canadian ballet. There were then already two Canadian ballet companies, the Russian-influenced Volkoff Ballet and the largely amateur Winnipeg Ballet, but a group of Canadians had decided that they would like a new ballet company, in the style of Ballet Rambert or Sadler's Wells (who had toured triumphantly in North America in 1949). De Valois recommended Franca, who for the next twenty-three years (1951-74) was artistic director and effective shaper of the new National Ballet of Canada, based in Toronto. At first she found the going tough -- the ballet's first base was a dilapidated building with pigeons in the rafters, rats in the basement, and barely functioning heating, and Canadians, used to the more flamboyant and athletic style of Russian ballet, did not initially take to Franca's more nuanced repertoire -- but she persevered, and succeeded in building a company of international standing. She nurtured local talent, especially through the National Ballet School, which she set up in partnership with Betty Oliphant, but also formed long associations with such stars as Erik Bruhn (with whom she had worked at the Metropolitan Ballet) and the temperamental Rudolf Nureyev (whom she disliked on a personal level). 
Franca danced many leading roles with the National Ballet until 1959, when she handed over to a succession of dancers she had trained herself, though she continued to dance the occasional role. She also choreographed, her notable creations including versions of 'Nutcracker' (1964) and 'Cinderella' (1968, which was televised, and won Canada's first Emmy award in 1970). In 1964 she oversaw the company's move to the O'Keefe Centre in Toronto. She also organized and accompanied many international tours by the company. Always demanding as a choreographer and taskmaster and direct in speech, she was increasingly dictatorial in the way she ran the company; one of her leading stars, Karen Kain, described her as 'ferocious' ('The Independent', 21 Feb 2007). Already exhausted by constant battles with her board of directors over finance and other matters and disappointed by the reception of some of her more daring productions, she was eventually manoeuvred into resignation in 1974 (blaming a falling out with Betty Oliphant, whom she suspected of trying to usurp her). She nevertheless, after a few years, and particularly after Frederick Ashton's lover Alexander Grant was appointed the company's artistic director, continued to choreograph for the National Ballet, and in 1978 she published a history of the company in collaboration with the photographer Ken Bell. She also served as joint artistic director of the Ottawa School of Dance. 
Franca was appointed an officer of the order of Canada in 1967, and a companion of the order in 1985. She was married twice while in Canada: in 1952 to a theatre technician, Hubert Anderson (died 2004), whom she divorced in 1954; and in 1960 to the clarinettist James Morton (died 1997). She died in Ottawa on 19 February 2007. She had no children. The Celia Franca Centre, the Canadian National Ballet School's new studio facilities, had been opened in 2006. She was described by the choreographer James Kudelka as 'the icon of ballet in Canada' ('The Guardian', 22 Feb 2007).

Ghoussoub, Mai (1952-2007), writer, publisher, and artist, was born in Beit Shabab, a town in the mountains above Beirut, Lebanon, on 2 November 1952, the second daughter of Raymond Ghoussoub, lawyer and amateur footballer, and his wife, Maggie Bridi, mathematics teacher. Her parents were Maronite Christian Arabs. She was educated at the Lycee Franco-Libanais, Beirut. As an eighteen-year-old she gave early evidence of intelligent determination when she wrote, and tried unsuccessfully to publish, an article defending a maid condemned by the Lebanese media for killing her newborn baby, born after rape by the girl's employer. Ghoussoub took a degree in French literature at the Lebanese University simultaneously with a degree in mathematics at the American University in Beirut. 
When in 1975 the Lebanese civil war broke out, Mai Ghoussoub was a member of a Trotskyite splinter group who refused to join the fighting; she and her childhood friend Andre Gaspard helped distribute medical supplies in a poor, mixed area of Beirut that the doctors had left. Her car was hit by a shell when she was driving a casualty to hospital, and aged twenty-three, she lost an eye and left Beirut for treatment in England. Despite her facial injuries she remained strikingly attractive, with a dancer's slender body, long dark hair, and a penchant for dramatic clothes and jewellery. 
In 1976, while working as a journalist in Paris, she wrote, together with Andre Gaspard, a book about the society they had both left, 'Comprendre le Liban' (1977), under the pseudonyms Magida Salma and Selim Accaoui. Back in London in 1978 Ghoussoub realized that London had no Arabic bookshop, rang Gaspard, and suggested that they start one. Although they lacked funds, work permits, and premises, they founded the Al-Saqi Bookshop at 26 Westbourne Grove, near Paddington, London, in the same year. It became the centre of Middle Eastern cultural life in London, and survived her, as did the publishing house that sprang from it, Saqi Books. In 1990 Ghoussoub and Gaspard co-founded a sister publishing house in Beirut, Dar-al-Saqi. Meanwhile she married, in 1978 at Islington register office, Jonathan Isaiah Rothschild, a translator five years her senior, and son of Jack Rothschild, management consultant. The marriage ended in divorce, and on 4 February 1991 she married the Lebanese writer and journalist Hazim Saghie, otherwise Hazem Saghieh ('b'. 1951), son of Rashid Saghie, merchant. Theirs was a notably happy relationship full of laughter and argument. 
In the 1980s Mai Ghoussoub (as she continued to be known) had begun a parallel career as a visual, literary, and performance artist, studying sculpture at the Henry Moore Sculpture Studio, Morley College, London, but always seeing her creative practice as a unity. The issues she explored as a publisher were equally central to her art: freedom and censorship; sexual, cultural, and gender stereotyping; the power of women. She also saw fun and beauty as ends in themselves, so her sculptures were often playful, with witty, cartoonish lines. 'Divas', her 2000 monologue with sculptures, featured vividly energetic caricatures of such female icons as Josephine Baker, the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, and Edith Piaf, and Ghoussoub attached scraps of cloth, wire wool, beads, earrings, and 'frivolous' accoutrements like a little gold bag to the strong, dark single lines of metal that defined the women's bodies. She exhibited nationally and internationally, in Beirut, Berlin, Copenhagen, and Chicago. In 2004, sharing a show with the Israeli artist Anna Sherbany, she dressed up in a white 'chador' and dark glasses and walked around Shoreditch with a tennis racquet: no one batted an eyelid, proving her point that London was basically tolerant. 
During the 1990s Mai Ghoussoub was effectively creative director of the Saqi publishing house. She entertained visiting artists and intellectuals generously and was a source of inspiration on the alternative London arts scene. In 1998 she published her semi-autobiographical 'Leaving Beirut', a remarkable sequence of fluidly linked chapters that told the story of life during the civil war and in its bitter aftermath through a series of character studies; she managed to understand both the freedom fighter and the torturer. The book was framed by the lightly fictionalized story of an assignment Ghoussoub wrote as a girl at the French 'lycee' that glorified revenge, incurring the displeasure of her revered Jewish teacher. This subtle, brilliant book explained the difficulty but absolute necessity of forgiveness. 
Under Ghoussoub's and Gaspard's leadership Saqi Books published international literary fiction in English by writers including Ismail Kadare, first winner of the international Man Booker prize, brought key Western texts to the Arab world in translation, and published many books banned in Arab countries. In 2005 Ghoussoub spoke to the Freemuse Conference on Freedom of Expression and Music in Beirut, citing her central principle 'mamnou' al-mane' ('it is banned to ban') and the Arabic saying 'kul mamnou' marghoub' ('what is banned is desired'). 'Words do not kill: people do', she said. Her art and journalism continued to challenge censorship, prejudice, and abuses of human rights. 
In 2006 the Israeli invasion of the Lebanon sent Mai Ghoussoub into creative overdrive. She organized readings, co-curated an exhibition for the Liverpool Biennial, and published 'Lebanon, Lebanon', an elegiac anthology for the country she loved, in aid of child victims of the war. In 2007 she contracted severe gastroenteritis, was hospitalized (at St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, Westminster) on 16 February, and died suddenly the following morning of heart failure. She was cremated at the west London crematorium, Kensal Green, and was survived by her husband, Hazim Saghie, her parents, and her sister Houda. Her obituary in the 'Daily Star' of Lebanon praised her work but also evoked her restless cosmopolitan glamour: 'Ghoussoub was cool. Seeing her around Beirut or London... was like catching sight of Debbie Harry in New York... [She] made things happen' ('Daily Star', 19 Feb 2007).

Henshaw, Alexander Adolphus Dumphries (1912-2007), aviator, was born on 7 November 1912 in Peterborough, Northamptonshire, one of four children of Albert Henshaw (1888-1964), a wealthy entrepreneur in agriculture, property, and the holiday industry in Lincolnshire. He was educated at Lincoln grammar school and King Edward VI Grammar School, Stratford upon Avon. While still a boy he received a Royal Humane Society award for saving another boy from the River Witham. Although his first interest was in engineering, he opted instead to join the family agricultural business. 
Henshaw first became attracted to flying early in 1932 when captivated by Royal Air Force aircraft performing low-level aerobatics. After an intensive flying course that year with the Skegness and East Lincolnshire Aero Club, and first flying solo on 7 May, he gained his private pilot's licence on 6 June, and his air-minded father bought him a second-hand de Havilland Moth biplane for $300. He soon aspired to aerobatics himself, and this led to the purchase of a new Comper Swift single-seat monoplane with which, after only thirty-five hours of flying, he became one of the youngest ever competitors in the prestigious 1933 king's cup air race. He was also the youngest pilot to win the Siddeley challenge trophy -- awarded to the light aeroplane club whose representative pilot in the race was the first to complete the 831 mile course -- having averaged 128 m.p.h. He purchased a larger, passenger-carrying de Havilland Leopard Moth for the 1934 race, but was not placed. Together with his father, he also honed his skills in dead reckoning navigation and blind flying around Europe before replacing the Swift with the one and only prototype Arrow Active I light racing biplane in May 1935. 
For the 1935 royal jubilee year king's cup race Henshaw purchased a specially built Miles Hawk Major monoplane. However, a crankshaft failure forced him to ditch in the Irish Sea and he was fortunate to be rescued by the steamer 'Manx Queen'. Then, while he was aerobatting the Arrow Active later that year, the engine caught fire, forcing him to bale out, using the parachute that his father had bought him for his birthday only four weeks earlier. After flying the Leopard Moth in the 1936 king's cup race, and having had to retire with low oil pressure, he swapped it for a much faster Percival Mew Gull single-seat monoplane G-AEXF. He entered the 1937 king's cup race but suffered from oiled-up plugs. Nothing daunted, in 1938 he finally won the trophy with the suitably modified Mew Gull, setting an average speed of 236.25 m.p.h., the fastest time then recorded, over a course of 1012 miles -- a record which still stood at the time of his death. 
Henshaw then set his sights on the formidable objective of setting a new record flight to Cape Town and back. With his father he surveyed the route in the spring of 1938, checking routings down both sides of Africa. Opting to fly the western side, with the further modified Mew Gull, he departed from Gravesend on 5 February 1939. Without radio or navigation aids, he made fuel stops in Algeria, the Belgian Congo, and Angola before reaching Cape Town in just under forty hours, having flown 6377 miles. After only twenty-eight hours there, he followed a similar return route, landing completely exhausted at Gravesend on 9 February -- four days, ten hours, and sixteen minutes after his original departure. He had broken the homeward record, established in November 1937 with a twin-engined aircraft flown by two pilots, by seven hours, and the out-and-back time by almost thirty-one hours. However, this truly epic achievement was overshadowed by the imminence of war and Henshaw received no public recognition at all. 
Volunteering for war service with the RAF as a fighter pilot on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Henshaw accepted an invitation to join Vickers-Armstrongs as a test pilot. In June 1940 he was posted to the newly opened Vickers-Supermarine Spitfire shadow factory at Castle Bromwich, near Birmingham, becoming chief production test pilot for the huge output of Spitfire fighters, and later Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, built there between 1940 and the end of the war in 1945. With a production rate rising to ten Spitfires a day in 1943, he often flight-tested twenty aircraft in a single day. In one instance in 1943, while ferrying a Spitfire from the satellite unit at nearby Cosford in bad weather, and suffering engine failure over the outskirts of Coventry, his hurried forced landing largely demolished a small house but fortunately he suffered only minor injuries and no one else was hurt. On another occasion he was forced to abandon his aircraft when the engine exploded: despite his badly torn parachute, he still managed to land safely. Often called upon to demonstrate the Spitfire to groups of visiting VIPs, he notably made a virtuoso display before the highly air-minded wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill. The authorities were less pleased when he flew a Spitfire (inverted) down Birmingham's Broad Street. He also test-flew Lancasters and was reputed to be the only pilot able to barrel-roll the bomber. 
Altogether 11,694 Spitfires and Seafires (the naval sibling) and 305 Lancaster bombers were built and repaired at Castle Bromwich and the local dispersal factories at Cosford and Desford. Under Henshaw's intensely active leadership together with twenty-five short-stay RAF officers, 37,023 test flights were logged there. Henshaw himself test-flew some 2360 individual Spitfires and Seafires, amounting to more than 10 per cent of the overall total of 22,749 of these aircraft built anywhere. 
On 17 February 1940 Henshaw had married Countess Barbara Maude de Chateaubrun (1916-1996), the widow of Count Guy de Chateaubrun, who had been killed in an air accident. She was the daughter of Sidney Harris Denman. They had one son, also named Alex. After the war, and a period in South Africa as a director of Miles Aircraft, in 1948 Henshaw rejoined his family's farming and holiday business, giving up flying in deference to his wife and the loss of her first husband. He then developed six miles of the Lincolnshire coastline, which had been requisitioned during the war, incorporating a residential estate at Sandilands, Sutton-on-Sea, with the main avenue bearing his name and all the streets and roads being named after the various aircraft he had flown. Yet despite his preoccupation with his diverse business interests, his abiding passion was for aviation and he remained in great demand at aviation functions for the rest of his life. 
After his only national recognition with the somewhat meagre award of the MBE in 1944, in 1953 Henshaw was awarded the queen's commendation for bravery for his rescue work during the great floods of that year. Always taking great interest in promoting 'airmindedness' in young people, in 1997 he was awarded the Air League's Jeffrey Quill medal. In 2003, the centenary of flight year, the duke of Edinburgh invested him as a companion of the Air League. He became an honorary fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society the same year. He captured his aviation life for posterity in four graphically descriptive books, and in many lectures and magazine articles. In 2005 he donated his papers, photographs, trophies, and specially commissioned aviation art collection to the RAF Museum at Hendon. He died on 24 February 2007 at his home, Arborfield, Fordham Road, Newmarket, of heart disease. He was survived by his son, Alex.

Jellicoe, George Patrick John Rushworth, second Earl Jellicoe and Baron Jellicoe of Southampton (1918-2007), army officer, politician, and businessman, was born on 4 November 1918 at Holwell House, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the only son of John Rushworth Jellicoe, Viscount Jellicoe of Scapa, later first Earl Jellicoe (1859-1935), naval officer, and his wife, Florence Gwendoline (1877-1964), daughter of Sir Charles Cayzer, founder of the Clan Line shipping firm. Born into a family of national prominence and into a life of privilege, he was conscious from his early years of the expectations and responsibilities this entailed. George V was his godfather, the king and queen regularly stayed with his family on the Isle of Wight for Cowes week, and he was a page of honour at the coronation of George VI. He became Viscount Brocas at the age of seven, when his father was made an earl. He was educated at Winchester College and while still at school inherited his father's earldom. He won an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, and before taking this up spent a year in Germany learning the language with a view to a diplomatic career. At Cambridge he achieved a first in history and -- in the vacations -- developed an enthusiasm for the Cresta run and for challenging skiing. 
At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Jellicoe surprised many people by opting for the Coldstream Guards rather than the navy with which his name was so closely associated. He was seconded to a guards commando unit and after training in Scotland saw active service in 1941 in north Africa, where he was wounded while leading a patrol behind enemy lines. In 1942 he was recruited by David Stirling for the newly formed Special Air Service (SAS) and the following year became commander of the Special Boat Squadron (SBS), which was deployed on dangerous sorties against the German-occupied Greek islands. In June 1942 he led a raid on Heraklion airfield on Crete, which was being used by the Germans to harass shipping convoys in the eastern Mediterranean. After being dropped off in rubber boats from a submarine his party cut the perimeter wire around the airfield and when they were challenged by sentries managed to convince the Germans that they were merely drunken Greek peasants. In the event they managed to place time-bombs on some twenty-one German aircraft and a munitions supply dump, eventually escaping to a rendezvous with another submarine. For this escapade Jellicoe was appointed DSO. 
Other adventures followed thick and fast. In 1943, after the the Italians had signed an armistice with the allies, he was parachuted into Rhodes to try to persuade the Italian governor to hand the island over to the allies rather than to the Germans. He landed off course and, fearing he would be captured, ate the letter he was carrying from General Maitland Wilson to the Italian commander. When he managed to reach the latter he was frustrated by his lack of the swallowed credentials and the Italian's reluctance to antagonize the 10,000-strong German garrison. This setback did not prevent him from arranging for various other islands to be successfully occupied by British troops. For this operation he was awarded the MC. In the course of his campaigning he was also mentioned three times in dispatches and awarded the Legion d'honneur, the Croix de Guerre, and the Greek war cross. When the allied forces were eventually closing in on Athens and the Germans were evacuating the city it was Jellicoe (on a borrowed bicycle) who arrived first in the capital and announced to an ecstatic Greek population that they were liberated. Before demobilization he had reached the rank of colonel, although still only twenty-seven. 
Jellicoe married on 23 March 1944 the Shanghai-born Patricia Christine (Patsy) O'Kane (1917-2012) (daughter of Jeremiah O'Kane, marine engineer), whom he had met in Beirut while they were both engaged in sensitive operations; they had two sons, Patrick and Nicholas, and two daughters, Alexandra and Zara. He also made many enduring friendships during his special operations, notably with Patrick Leigh Fermor, who was engaged in activities similar to his own and with whom he remained on close terms until the end of his life. 
With the war over Jellicoe achieved his original ambition of joining the foreign service. He served in Washington and Brussels as well as in the northern department of the Foreign Office (responsible for Soviet affairs) in London, and was widely considered (like his Washington colleague Nicko Henderson, later ambassador in Germany, France, and the USA) to be a rising star. However, by the time he was posted to Baghdad as deputy secretary-general of the Baghdad pact his marriage had run into difficulties and he set up house with Philippa Anne Bridge, a highly attractive young divorced woman (the former wife of Christopher Charles Cyprian Bridge, and the daughter of Phillip Rushwell Rendell Dunne, of Gatley Park, Herefordshire) he had met in London in 1955. The Foreign Office felt that this arrangement was not sustainable, and he was offered the choice of parting with Philippa or resigning from the diplomatic service. Without hesitation he chose the latter, although it was to be more than ten years before he obtained a divorce from Patsy and was free to marry Phillipa, which he did on 4 April 1966. They had a son, John, and two daughters, Emma and Daisy. 
Long before his second marriage Jellicoe had embarked on a successful new career, this time in politics. He had already demonstrated an interest in political -- particularly foreign -- affairs with speeches in the House of Lords, and his first appointment, notwithstanding the scandal of his leaving the diplomatic service, was as a lord-in-waiting to the queen. He was promoted as a member of successive Conservative governments through a variety of junior posts until in 1963 he was appointed first lord of the Admiralty, in 1967 deputy leader of the opposition in the House of Lords, and in 1970 lord privy seal, minister for the civil service, and leader of the House of Lords. He played a major part in promoting government legislation in a number of fields including European affairs, industrial relations, public service conditions, and the handling of emergencies. He was widely respected as a prodigiously energetic minister who was popular with politicians and civil servants alike. 
Given Jellicoe's steady ascent up the ministerial ladder it came as a serious shock when in 1973 Scotland Yard inquiries into a call-girl ring revealed his name. When questioned by the cabinet office about the accusations, he admitted to having had relations with call-girls, and although there was never any implication that national security had been compromised by his involvements, the simultaneous and more serious allegations -- involving drugs and prostitutes -- against Lord Lambton, and the vivid recollections of the embarrassment caused by the Profumo affair of a few years before, persuaded the prime minister, Edward Heath, to accept Jellicoe's promptly offered resignation. There were many who felt that his departure from the political scene was unnecessary as well as unfortunate, and there was a general consensus that he had acted honourably in not attempting to hang on to office. But it was now the second time that his promising career in public service had been undone by extra-matrimonial affairs. 
Jellicoe immediately embarked on yet another successful career, this time in business. He became, among other things, chairman of Tate and Lyle, the Davy Corporation, and the British Overseas Trade Board, president of the London chamber of commerce and industry, a director of Sothebys, Smiths Industries, Morgan Crucible, and Warburgs Bank, and governor of the Centre for Environmental Studies. In 1995 he became involved with Hakluyt, a confidential intelligence company. He also took on the chancellorship of Southampton University and the presidency of the Royal Geographical Society. All these bodies benefited from his energy and leadership skills. He was appointed KBE in 1986, elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1990, and created a life peer (to enable him to remain a participant in the House of Lords), as Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, in 1999. He remained an active and highly sociable figure until his death. He had always been well off financially. He had bought Tidcombe Manor in Wiltshire soon after he left the diplomatic service, and this estate became a convivial and happy centre for his extended family. He died there on 22 February 2007 of a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Philippa, their children, and his first family. He was succeeded as third earl by his son Patrick ('b'. 1950). 
A biography of Jellicoe (published by Lorna Windmill in 2005) was entitled 'A British Achilles', and made clear that his Achilles heel was his susceptibility to women, to whom he had always been a very attractive figure on account of his dash, humour, and generosity of spirit. But he was also dearly loved by almost all who met him on account of his life-enhancing ebullience. The 'Daily Telegraph' obituary of Jellicoe described him as 'by consensus... one of the nicest men in public life' and few contemporaries would have disagreed with the verdict.

Kyle, (John) Keith (1925-2007), journalist, broadcaster, and historian, was born at the nursing home in Sturminster Newton, Dorset, on 4 August 1925, the only child of William Ernest Kyle (1890-1969), land agent, and his wife, Elsie Mary, 'nee' Maule (1895-1972). His parents were then living in nearby Iwerne Minster. He led a relatively solitary childhood as his parents feared that too close an association with the village children would leave him with an indelible west-country accent. In his early years he was taught at home by his mother, a qualified schoolteacher, who was determined that her son should be the first member of her family to go to both public school and university. At the age of nine he was sent to a nearby preparatory school, Chafyn Grove in Salisbury, from where he won a scholarship to Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire. A delicate boy, never any good at games, he found himself fully at home in the school library. His reward was to win an exhibition to Magdalen College, Oxford. By then the Second World War was well under way but those under the call-up age of eighteen were encouraged to spend two or even three terms at university before being required to join the forces. Kyle spent the Hilary and Trinity terms of 1943 being tutored by the already celebrated Oxford don A. J. P. Taylor, with whom he was to form a lifelong friendship. 
Summoned to the colours in November 1943 Kyle at first joined the infantry but later transferred to the Royal Artillery, into which he was commissioned in 1944. Not released from the army until 1946 -- he spent most of the intervening period serving in India, where he reached the rank of acting captain -- he returned to Oxford in the Michaelmas term of 1947, continuing his studies in modern history under Taylor and embarking on medieval history with another celebrated Magdalen don, Bruce McFarlane, as his tutor. A promising pupil, who was also able to play a full part in the university Liberal club (of which he became chairman) and the Oxford Union, he seems to have hoped to become an academic. A disappointing second-class degree in 1950 effectively put an end to that ambition, though Magdalen generously renewed his exhibition, allowing him to spend his last term as secretary of the Oxford Union. 
At this time there were real anxieties about Kyle's health. He appears to have suffered from an undiagnosed version of myalgic encephalomyelitis (probably the cause of his relative failure in his degree examinations) and it was with some trepidation that he took up his first job in London. This was at the English Speaking Union headquarters in Mayfair, where he helped to run the organization's publications and meetings. It had not, in fact, been his first choice of employment as he had previously applied for a talks producer's job with the North American service of the BBC. The corporation, though, had taken so long to respond that, despairing of getting a positive answer, Kyle went to the English Speaking Union instead. He was rescued, however, when Bush House (its grant-in-aid from the Foreign Office having finally come through) offered him employment at double the salary he was receiving from the English Speaking Union. 
In 1953 Kyle's experience in dealing with North American topics prompted him to apply for a Commonwealth Fund travelling fellowship in the United States. On the awards panel sat Geoffrey Crowther, the editor of 'The Economist', who -- according to Kyle's account -- gave him a particularly hard time. There was, however, a reason for that, Crowther having decided that the gangling youth in front of him (Kyle stood 6 feet 3 inches in his socks) would make an admirable correspondent for his own paper in Washington. Although it meant sacrificing the Commonwealth fellowship, which Crowther was kind enough to tell him he had already been awarded, Kyle had no hesitation about accepting the 'Economist' offer. That autumn he arrived in Washington to take up his post as the first-ever British resident correspondent for the weekly. It was a glittering opportunity, and Kyle seized it with both hands. He was to spend five years working for 'The Economist' in the United States, years that saw the formal desegregation of the nation's schools, the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, the 1956 presidential election, and the emergence of the young John F. Kennedy as a potential White House contender. Reporting latterly also for the 'News Chronicle' (which had a New York but not a Washington correspondent) Kyle -- although his contributions to 'The Economist' were necessarily anonymous -- effectively made his reputation as a commentator on the American scene. 
It was no surprise to his expatriate journalistic colleagues in Washington when Kyle was summoned home in the autumn of 1958 to become 'The Economist''s political and parliamentary correspondent. Again he dazzled and shone. From his first report on a particularly ill-fated Liberal assembly held at Torquay through his coverage of the 1959 general election to his vivid evocation of the gradual disintegration of the Macmillan government, he set a new standard in political reporting. He also became a familiar face on the BBC, appearing regularly on the early evening 'Tonight' programme and accepting globe-trotting assignments for a variety of television projects. He left 'The Economist' in 1961 but continued to work as a newspaper journalist (notably for 'The Observer' and 'The Spectator') as well as a broadcaster (for both the BBC and independent television). His coverage for both media of decolonization in Africa and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was highly regarded by his fellow professionals. 
By now, however, Kyle's own sphere of interest had become the domestic political arena itself. After the 1959 election he shook off the remnants of his Liberal allegiance and joined the Labour Party. On 29 September 1962 he married Susan Mary (Suzy) Harpur, a television current affairs producer eleven years his junior, and daughter of Douglas George David Harpur, vicar of St Michael's Church, St Albans, and it was at St Albans, in the 1966 general election, that he first stood for parliament. Having lost there he did not find a seat for the 1970 general election, but in 1974 he contested the new constituency of Braintree in both the February and the October general elections. Narrowly losing there the first time, just before the second election he suffered a stroke and, though he managed to appear at the eve-of-poll rally, he was still a thousand votes short of victory. That marked, he declared, the end of his parliamentary aspirations and, while he fought one further election -- this time for the Social Democratic Party at Northampton South, where he managed to come second in 1983 -- that proved in effect to be the case. 
The rest of Kyle's career, which included eight years, from 1982 to 1990, on the staff of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), could be dismissed as being an anti-climax. But that would be unfair -- for in 1991 came his lasting claim to fame, his definitive account of the Suez crisis of 1956. Entitled simply 'Suez', it was easily the best twentieth-century book on that whole bizarre diplomatic and military episode, owing a good deal to the ringside seat that its author occupied in Washington at the time. His other books included 'Whither Israel?' (1993), 'The Politics of the Independence of Kenya' (1999), and an engaging and remarkably candid volume of autobiography, 'Reporting the World', published posthumously in 2009, but none was to match and certainly not to surpass this model volume of contemporary history which led, quite properly, to his being invited to take up a visiting professorship at the University of Ulster, which he held from 1991 to 1998. He died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm at University College Hospital, Camden, London, on 21 February 2007. His funeral was held at his local church of St Mary, Primrose Hill, on 14 March 2007 and he was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. His wife, Suzy, and two adopted sons survived him.

McGregor, Sir Ian Alexander (1922-2007), malariologist, was born on 26 August 1922 at 12 Church Street, Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, the son of John McGregor (died 1945), tailor, and his wife, Isabella Chapman Greig, 'nee' Taylor (died 1974). He had two older half-brothers, his mother's first husband having died in an industrial accident. He was educated at Rutherglen Academy, Lanarkshire. Uncertain as to whether to pursue a career in medicine or veterinary medicine, he was too late to gain a place in medicine at the University of Glasgow. He elected instead to study at the extramural St Mungo College and Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and graduated in 1945, having secured the class medals in anatomy, physiology, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, and public health, with certificates of merit in seven other subjects, a record McGregor himself described simply as 'good' (autobiographical notes). 
McGregor was conscripted into the army in 1946. Before the end of the year he was posted to a field ambulance at Suez, by the side of the canal, relocating after only a few weeks to al-Sarafand in Palestine. He was ordered to train as a malariologist at the Middle East School of Hygiene at Dimra, near Gaza, and then assumed the post of command malariologist, spending his time travelling through Palestine and Transjordan inspecting the seven malaria control units that were in his charge and organizing training courses for other regimental medical officers. 
Having completed his military service in 1948, McGregor enrolled to study for the diploma in tropical medicine and hygiene at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and in 1949 was persuaded by Benjamin Stanley Platt, professor of human nutrition at the school, to join the Medical Research Council (MRC)'s human nutrition research unit that had been established in the Gambia. He was asked to investigate the possible contributory role of parasitic infections on protein malnutrition and began by assessing the incidence of splenic enlargement and anaemia in children under ten years of age in the village of Keneba, in the remote Kiang West district. It was during this period of relative isolation in Keneba that his lifelong interest in acquired malarial immunity and the mechanisms responsible for it developed. He had observed a reduction in the incidence of malaria in residents of Keneba as a result of the use of insecticide and periodic drug treatment but even when used in combination these interventions failed to eliminate the disease. Repeated serious episodes of malaria in young children stood in stark contrast to the infrequent cases in adults, leading McGregor to question the view that immunity to malaria was ineffective. 
McGregor published the results of his preliminary but detailed observations in 1952, as 'A nutritional assessment of the results of the control of parasitic diseases in Keneba, a rural Gambian village' in the 'Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene'. This led to the MRC's invitation to him to develop his research on diseases that were important in the Gambia, as director of the Gambian unit, later termed the MRC Laboratories, in 1954. Meanwhile, on 30 January that year, at Mapledurham, Oxfordshire, he married (Nancy) Joan Small ('b'. 1922), an executive officer in the MRC, and daughter of Frederick Herbert Small, company director. They had two children, Alistair ('b'. 1956) and Lesley ('b'. 1957). 
As director of the MRC's Gambian unit, McGregor embarked on the seminal field studies of malaria immunity that led to the demonstration that antibodies from adult Gambian serum had the capacity to reduce both the levels of malaria parasites in the blood and the clinical effects of the infection in the recipients who were young Gambian children suffering acute clinical 'Plasmodium falciparum' or 'Plasmodium malariae'. This was the first reliable experimental data showing that humans repeatedly exposed to malaria infection could develop an immunity that was capable of restricting clinical illness and the density of parasites in the blood. Since this acquired immunity could be transferred by antibodies from immune serum, vaccination against malaria was at least theoretically possible. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that adult Gambian serum had the same therapeutic effect when used in children from Tanzania who had 'Plasmodium falciparum' malaria, suggesting that west and east African strains of the malaria parasite had common features and that a vaccine against parasites from one region of Africa might be effective in protecting against parasites from other regions. 
Many other important contributions followed. McGregor's work at the MRC Laboratories, Gambia, on malaria immunology and epidemiology underpinned the global effort to combat malaria. The quest for an effective vaccine, essentially triggered by McGregor's passive transfer of immune serum, continued at his death. His nutritional studies from Keneba provided demographic and health data that was also still being used by researchers at the time of his death. 
McGregor served as chair or rapporteur on several important World Health Organization committees on malaria. He gave generously of his time, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of malaria, gleaned from his many years of practical experience in the field, ensured that the epidemiological features of malaria immunity were paramount when decisions on policy and planning of malaria research and control activities were being made by the World Health Organization in Geneva. McGregor was one of the very few scientists who had a complete mastery of malariology, amply demonstrated in his publication, with Walter Wernsdorfer, of 'Malaria: Principles and Practice of Malariology' in 1988. 
McGregor finally left the Gambia in 1980, becoming a professorial fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. He continued to write about malaria and was particularly supportive of younger researchers at the school until he retired in 1994. He received many prizes and other honours. He was appointed OBE in 1959 and CBE in 1968, and knighted in 1982. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1981 and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1987, and was president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene from 1983 to 1985. He died at Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, on 1 February 2007, following a heart attack suffered at home in Homington, Wiltshire, and was survived by his wife, Joan, and their two children.
