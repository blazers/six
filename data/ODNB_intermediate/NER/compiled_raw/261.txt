Sir John Campbell of Cawdor (d. c.1642), son and heir of the murdered laird, married Jean, daughter of Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy. Meanwhile various branches of the clan Donald were afflicted by internal strife, which they were unable to bring under control; one who was to benefit from this was Donald Campbell, natural son of the murdered Cawdor. He became involved in northern affairs through marriage with Jean Campbell, widow of Angus Mackintosh the younger of Torcastle and mother of the young heir who succeeded as chief in 1606 and to whom Donald was curator. Donald Campbell also kept a close interest in the west and later acquired Macdonald lands in Ardnamurchan, including the castle of Mingary, and also parts of Appin with the spectacular Castle Stalker on its rock in Loch Linnhe. 
The rifts in the clan Donald also provided the background for the younger Cawdor's greatest acquisition. For a brief period after 1519 Sir John Campbell had undertaken the administration of the MacIan lands on Islay, but the interest of his great-grandson Sir John in that fertile island revived through the marriage of his sister Margaret to Sir John Macdonald of Dunyvaig, whose family held most of it in the 1590s. Turmoil among the island clans resulted in rebellion in 1614 and Cawdor, backed by Argyll and the privy council, was ordered to lead an expedition to Islay, where he took the castles of Dunyvaig and Lochgorme. In 1615 he arranged to buy the forfeited Macdonald lands from Argyll for sums which proved to be so large -- his debts were said at one point to have amounted to 100,000 merks -- that he had to sell silver and some land in the north to raise the money, and later generations are said to have regretted the purchase. Cawdor devolved Islay to his son John Campbell (died 1654), who was declared insane in 1639 during his father's lifetime and whose affairs until his death were managed first by Cawdor's brother Colin Campbell of Ardersier (died 'c'.1642) and then by a younger brother, George Campbell. An attempt was made to develop Islay by settling friends and supporters there and by trying to raise profits from the island, including an attempt to 'drawe in Inglische men to Ila boithe for the fisching and leid myneis' (Innes, 250) and by building up a large cattle trade.

Edward [i] Kemeys (d. c.1607) held the estate in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. He was married first to Elizabeth, daughter of Rowland Morgan of Machen, and second to Catherine, daughter of William Kemeys of Llanrhymney and widow of Henry Morgan, the second son of Rowland Morgan of Machen. Between 1573 and 1608 he was on the commission of the peace and was four times sheriff of Glamorgan. According to contemporary reports, he was unscrupulous and 'abused every function which it was left to him as sheriff to commit'. In 1585, the Star Chamber indicted him for accepting a bribe and releasing a prisoner, selling offices, and imprisoning the county gaoler. In mid-1595 he handpicked a coroner's court jury in a murder case to save the life of a friend, and in 1599 he was fined $500 and 100 marks damages. This action also led to his removal from the commission of the peace 'until his right honourable the Lord Keeper should be better satisfied of his behaviour' (Williams, 107). He died about 1607 and his will was proved in March 1610.

On 13 June 1643 he was knighted at Oxford, and on the death of his father in 1648 succeeded him as second baronet. He was similarly a staunch royalist who attacked Cardiff in 1646 and later defended Pembroke Castle. Upon its surrender he was fined $5262 and exiled for two years. He married twice; his first wife was Blanche, daughter of Sir Lewis Mansel of Margam, and his second wife was Margaret, daughter of Sir George Whitmore, lord mayor of London in 1631-2.

In 1628 he was elected member of parliament for the borough of Monmouth, and in 1631-2 was appointed sheriff of Monmouthshire, and in 1638-9 high sheriff of Glamorgan. On 13 May 1642 he was created a baronet by Charles I and became the MP for Glamorgan. He was an ardent royalist commander during the first civil war. He raised a regiment of horse and was appointed governor of Cardiff Castle. On 25 May 1648 he died defending Chepstow Castle for three weeks after refusing to surrender to Cromwell's forces. His body was dismembered and parts of it later adorned the hats of his roundhead attackers. A later poem described Kemeys's brave defence of the castle: '
Let us Sir Nicholas Kemeys' name rehearse, 

Let not our bards his noble deeds forget! 

Perchance his bright example may be yet 

A beacon to some hero yet unborn! 

Our land may yet by cival war be torn 

Perchance some valiant Welshman yet may rise 

To emulate the deeds of our Kemeys!

He was MP for Monmouthshire in 1685-7 and 1695-8, and for Monmouth borough in 1690-95. He also held the office of sheriff of Glamorgan about 1689, and he was the governor of Cardiff Castle in 1702. He married twice, but the indications are that he was a less than affectionate husband as he 'worshipped the bottle rather than his wife and proved demonstrably neglectful of her feelings' (Jenkins, 101).

Sir Charles [iii] Kemeys, fourth baronet (1688-1735), was born on 23 November 1688. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 17 June 1706. He was sheriff of Glamorgan between 1712 and 1713 and MP for Monmouthshire in 1713-15 and for Glamorgan from 1716 to 1734. There were a number of political intrigues involving Charles [iii] Kemeys, notably concerning election expenses, and there is one tale of his friendship with George, the elector of Hanover, and his reluctance to accept him as the king of Great Britain. In spite of Kemeys' support for the Stuart cause, the king sought to renew his friendship with Sir Charles and allegedly remarked 'Send for him -- tell him he must come. I long to smoke a pipe with him'. Kemeys nevertheless proved his loyalty to the Stuarts by stating, 'I should be happy to smoke a pipe with him as Elector of Hanover, but I cannot think of it as king of England' ('Cefn Mably', 'South Wales Daily News', Jan-Feb 1910). With his death, without issue, on 29 January 1735 the baronetcy became extinct.

Joseph Burrell (1759-1831) is generally regarded as the founder of the firm, and he was certainly in business on his own account by about 1790, repairing agricultural implements. Within a few years he was beginning to make implements as well. He first attracted notice in 1803 when, at the annual Holkham sheep shearing, he exhibited a seed and manure drill of his own design. The following year he filed a patent for an improved threshing machine, and in 1805 he showed a mowing machine at Holkham. On these foundations the business run by the three Burrell brothers was able to develop. James Burrell managed the business alone after his two elder brothers died, and on his death in 1837 control passed to his second son, aged only twenty. This was

Sir Edward Baynton (c.1520-1593). 
This Edward was much embroiled in lawsuits over land. His first wife, Agnes, daughter of Sir Griffith Rhys, whom he married about 1553, had been left an interest in lands belonging to William, Lord Stourton, whose mistress she had been. Stourton's heir tried, but eventually failed, to counter Agnes's claim to Stourton lands, and she and Edward held them from 1557. It is somewhat surprising that Baynton married her: there were rumours that she and Lord Stourton had actually married, and although unfounded they worried the Bayntons. So a memorial brass to Edward Baynton's two wives insisted that Agnes, who died in 1574, was 'his first trew wife' (Kite, 63). Their eldest son, William, died in 1564, allegedly the victim of witchcraft. Their surviving children, out of thirteen, were one son and two daughters. Baynton's second wife was Anne (died 1578), daughter of Humphrey Packington. Further lawsuits stemmed from his brother Andrew's presumably forged assignment and sales of property to Pleydell, Sharington, and Snell, which conflicted with the previous entail to Edward. Eventually Baynton gained possession by law, and by numerous deeds secured his holdings in Stanley Abbey, Bremhill, his parcels in Chippenham, and other property. He continued to increase his estates by purchase, and became a vital member of the county administration. Knighted in 1574 he represented Wiltshire in the 1563 parliament, and sat twice more for boroughs. He was one of the county's most active JPs, attending quarter sessions very regularly in the 1570s and 1580s, even sending in material until a few months before his death in 1593, and he held other posts from time to time.

Sir Henry Baynton (1571-1616), purchased further lands worth perhaps $3000 from Sir William Throckmorton and Sir Thomas Tracy. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant, and became a JP briefly in 1592 and continuously from 1594. He followed his father's example of hard work in running the county, attending several quarter sessions each year, or sending in recognizances, until eighteen months before his death on 14 October 1616. He was four times a member of parliament, sitting as knight of the shire in 1597. A survey begun in 1612 listed a large tenantry on his manors: he exercised great influence around Bromham, Stanley, Chippenham, and also Bremhill, where he had another substantial house. Bromham was an important weaving centre, but the weavers suffered severely during depressions in the cloth trade. Baynton was a man of conscience: he founded a hospital or almshouse in 1614, probably intended for impoverished weavers, and in his will in 1616 he left significant sums to the vicars and the churches where he held property, as well as $5 to the preacher at Steeple Aston, and money for the poor in several parishes. His executors were other Wiltshire gentry. He had married Lucy, daughter of his father's very good friend Sir John Danvers, another fortunate alliance, for she inherited property through her grandfather. They had two children. Lucy's will left money and rings to her daughter Elizabeth, who married John Dutton ['see under 'Dutton family], and to her Danvers relations, including an 'ashcolour' velvet gown and satin waistcoat and petticoat, and also money for a minister to say the service in Foxham Chapel, in Bremhill parish; she died in 1621 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Sir Edward Baynton (1593-1657) matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 April 1610, but is not recorded as taking a degree. He was knighted in 1613, before his father died. Sir Edward played a major role in the county's politics, but was a more quarrelsome man than his ancestors and made many enemies. He married, first, Elizabeth Maynard (died 1635), with whom he had a son, Edward, and second, Mary Bowell, with whom there were sons, Henry and Nicholas, and a daughter, Mary. His executors were his wife and son Robert. But he was not a faithful husband, and in 1629 he was charged in the court of high commission with neglecting a woman with whom he had had two illegitimate children; King Charles pardoned him for these adulteries and any others. 
Office also brought trouble: Baynton was a deputy lieutenant, but in 1632 the sheriff complained that he neglected his duties. As sheriff himself in 1637-8 he clashed with other leading gentry over his harsh tactics in collecting ship money, yet he was also in trouble with the privy council over his accounts in 1639. He had not immediately followed his father as a JP, but was appointed in 1619. He was very active in that capacity, usually attending at least three sessions a year. Like his forebears he dealt with the tiresome between sessions work as well, such as orders for bridge repairs when Calne inhabitants would not pay as requested, and disputes between Bromham cloth workers. He was listed at the head of the Wiltshire JPs in October 1640, though it is not clear whether he was present at quarter sessions in January 1641 when they made a resolution that ship money was contrary to the laws and statutes of the realm. 
Baynton sat in every parliament but one up to 1653, having been first elected for Devizes in 1614. He was MP for Chippenham throughout the Short and Long parliaments. By 1640 he supported the parliamentary side, and although wounded in a duel with another MP he commanded Wiltshire parliamentary troops when the civil war began in 1642: ironically his experience as a deputy lieutenant in the king's militia was to help in the fight against the king. In 1643 he had a violent quarrel with his fellow Wiltshire parliamentary commander Sir Edward Hungerford, and this possibly led to Baynton's temporary move towards the king in 1643. His return to the parliamentary cause came at a high cost for his family: in 1645 royalist soldiers destroyed the great house at Bromham. Sir Edward adhered to the more radical group in the Commons, and as an independent retained his seat after Pride's Purge in 1648, sitting to the end of the Rump in 1653; he had been named as one of the king's judges. One of his sons was a royalist. 
Like his forebears Baynton sought to add to his family's wealth, making purchases in Wiltshire, so that along with lands inherited from his mother he passed on an increased estate worth nearly $2000 p.a. to his eldest son. Following the destruction of Bromham House he built another house nearby, at Spye Park (described disparagingly by Evelyn in 1654). His will, made in 1657 shortly before his death, has a long religious preface, expressing fervent hopes for redemption -- perhaps he regretted his tumultuous personal life.

Sir Edward Baynton (1618-1679), shared his father's commitment to the parliamentary and puritan cause. Like his father he went to Oxford, this time to St John's College, where he matriculated on 15 January 1636, but again like his father cannot be shown to have graduated. He became MP for Devizes in 1640, so that he sat in parliament along with his father up until Pride's Purge in 1648, and assisted his father on committees and in the parliamentary army; captain of horse in 1642 he was a major by 1644. He sat in five further parliaments; defeated in the 1661 election he was returned again in 1675. Although made a knight of the Bath in 1661 he was deeply critical of Charles II and his government; in 1677 he was dismissed as a JP. Bayntun, as he spelt his name, kept a commonplace book between 1657 and 1679 into which he copied political lampoons. The commonplace book also records his activities in local government and his dealings concerning the Baynton lands. He did not marry until 1661, when he married Stuarta, sister of Sir Thomas Thynne of Longleat: they had two sons, Henry and Thomas, and two daughters, Ann and Lucy. But he fell out with his wife, and left her nothing in his will made in 1670, directing that she and her relations were to have no part in his children's education, nor to meddle with their estate. 
Sir Edward had a great estate to pass on. He recorded his rents in his commonplace book, which shows that in the 1660s, as in the past, the family's wealth was based upon land. The annual rents from Stanley manor and its dependencies alone amounted to around $730, while those from Bromham, Bremhill, and the smaller estate of Rodbourne added much more, bringing the total of rents and renders (for items like loads of hay) to a little over $2000 per annum for most years in this decade. Income fell slightly in the 1670s, but still amounted to a very substantial yearly revenue. Moreover there are very many tenants named in the lists, a pointer to the influence the Bayntons could normally expect to exert among the surrounding population. They were to encounter unforeseen problems after Sir Edward's death, however. His elder son and heir,

Henry Baynton (1664-1691) maintained the family tradition of firm protestantism, and also that of representing Wiltshire boroughs (Calne and Chippenham) in parliament, but times had changed -- a tory, in contrast to his father and grandfather, he nevertheless feared the threat posed by James II's Catholicism. He would not agree to the repeal of the 'Test Act', and was dismissed from the Wiltshire commission of the peace and deputy lieutenancy in 1688, remaining excluded until the end of James's rule. 
In 1685 Henry Baynton had married an heiress, Lady Anne Wilmot, daughter of John, second earl of Rochester, an alliance which promised further increase of the family's estate. Henry was eager to continue the Baynton family name and made hopeful provision for sons and their male heirs for 500 years to come. But his careful plans were doomed; for on 11 July 1691 he died aged only twenty-seven. His son John apparently had problems and had no children, dying in his twenties in 1716; his memorial in Bromham church sadly proclaims that he was the nineteenth in lineal descent from Sir Henry Baynton. But he was the last in direct line. John's will of January 1716 bequeathed the major estates to his sister Anne Rolt's second son, his nephew Edward Rolt, the will specifying that Edward and his heirs take the name of Baynton Rolt. Heads of the Baynton family had struggled for centuries to ensure an unbroken father-to-son hold on Bromham, and the influence this conferred in Wiltshire, but they had been foiled by demographic fate.

This John Nye was baptized on 30 November 1630 at St Dionis Backchurch, London, where his father was then lecturer. On 3 July 1650 he was admitted a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, but he subsequently migrated to Oxford, where he matriculated from Magdalen College on 23 February 1654 and graduated BA the same day. By June that year he was acting as a clerk to the commission of triers and ejectors, of which his father was a prominent member. When one of the clergymen examined by the commission, Anthony Sadler, aired objections to his treatment in a pamphlet entitled 'Inquisitio Anglicana', it was almost certainly Nye who published anonymously a systematic defence of the commissioners' proceedings, 'Mr Sadler Re-Examined, or, His Disguise Discovered' (1654). 'The Approvers', he asserted, 'do the utmost in them lies to keep mens souls from being starved by the remainder of this Episcopall generation' (p. 13). He claimed to be 'now in no relation to them' (p. 1) and indeed on 10 February 1655 Nye was admitted to the Middle Temple, but he seems to have continued as clerk until the Restoration: in 1662 he was ordered to hand over the triers' papers to the archbishop of Canterbury. On 14 April 1664 he married at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, Anne Chumley or Cholmley, with whom he had two sons, John and Cholmley. He died in 1672, and was buried on 14 October at St Michael Cornhill, London, just seventeen days after his father had been interred there.

Jane Nasmyth (1788-1867) was born in the parish of St Andrew Kirk, Edinburgh, on 29 March 1788. The parish register records her first name as Jean but she signed her work Jane, the name by which she was known. Nicknamed 'Old Solid' by the family, she assisted with the raising of her younger brothers and sisters before helping with the running of the school. Her brother James recorded that 'My father consulted her in every course of importance in reference to business and financial affairs' ('James Nasmyth', 54). She sometimes accompanied her father on working trips and became his trusted confidante. The titles of her exhibited works suggest that she travelled a good deal, painting views of Windermere, Cumberland, Derbyshire, Richmond, Windsor, and Putney, as well as many others in various parts of Scotland. She also painted one scene of Geneva (exh. Royal Manchester Institution, 1851) and another of Lake Lausanne (priv. coll.). There is no evidence, however, that she went abroad, and for these two landscapes probably made use of her father's drawings. She favoured lake and mountain scenes, old trees, and sometimes her landscapes included towns such as 'A View of Perth' (exh. Royal Manchester Institution, 1845), or 'The Village of Swanston' (1826). Her work closely resembles that of her father, particularly in the painting of trees, rocks, and paths, and foreground details. Her figures are not so lifelike, however, and are often colourfully attired. Sometimes her foreground areas resemble water in their flat treatment, for example, 'Loch Katrine' (repr. in Johnson and Money). Some of her later works are closer to those of her sister Charlotte, the tree trunks and dead branches in the trees particularly. She often bathed her distances in a pinkish evening light, so common in Scottish skies and beloved by her father. She signed her work 'Jane Nasmyth' with the date, sometimes only on the exhibition label attached to the frame or stretcher, and favoured a Glasgow framer, Brand & Co. She died on 11 May 1867 and was buried in Putney Lower Common cemetery, in a grave to the right of the chapel. In due course her sisters Margaret, Barbara, and Charlotte were buried in the same plot.

Barbara Nasmyth (1790-1870) was born in St James's Square, St Cuthbert's parish, Edinburgh, on 15 April 1790. She accompanied her sisters Charlotte and Margaret on a visit to London in 1816, but the titles of her works suggest that, in general, though she went to Patricroft in 1840 and later settled in London, she painted mostly Scottish subjects in the vicinity of Edinburgh and in the lowlands. These included loch scenes, castles, river views, and townscapes in Edinburgh, Kenmore, and Comrie. Evidence of expeditions south of the border includes views of Westmorland, Derbyshire, and Essex. She was the last of the sisters to exhibit her work, beginning in 1845. She excelled in woodland scenery, cottages, and loch scenes, for example 'Highland Landscape with Loch' (priv. coll.), in which the trees are closer to Charlotte's than her father's in their roughness of bark and lighter colouring. Her figures are finely detailed, and she loved painting sailing boats as in 'Scottish Landscape' (repro. in Johnson and Money). She signed her work 'Barbara Nasmyth' neatly with a fine brush, sometimes adding the date. She died on 2 February 1870 at her home, Stanhope Villas, Charlwood Road, Putney.

Margaret Nasmyth (1791-1869) was born on 11 April 1791 in Hill Street, St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh. She followed her father in style, but like Barbara she preferred the more detailed and minute brushwork of her brother Patrick. Margaret left home in 1836 to live with her brothers James and George, at Green Lane House, Patricroft, Manchester. She did not exhibit until 1841 at the age of fifty, by which time the whole family had come to live with James, when presumably she had more time to herself. She travelled much, drawing subjects from all over Scotland as well as Cumberland, Lancashire, north Wales, Shropshire, Westmorland, and Cheshire, and further afield, in Blackford Heath and Chigwell, Essex. Her technique is fine and detailed, and she lavished much care on all parts of her paintings. Good examples are 'Lake Scene' and 'View of Kinfauns Castle Perthshire' (both repro. in Johnson and Money). She signed her work 'Margaret Nasmyth' in the bottom left-hand corner in a large, clear hand, though sometimes 'MN' with the date, in the bottom right-hand corner. She died at Stanhope Villas on 3 November 1869.

Elizabeth Wemyss Nasmyth (1793-1862) was born on 26 August 1793 in Hill Street, St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh. On 25 June 1815 she married the actor Daniel Terry (1789-1829). The marriage possibly took place rather suddenly, for in Nasmyth's letter to his children in Edinburgh of a few weeks earlier he makes no mention of it. Elizabeth was a talented designer and through Daniel Terry's association with Sir Walter Scott over the building of Abbotsford prepared designs for Scott's armoury. On 15 July 1815 Terry wrote to Scott: 'Mrs Terry is at length returned to her easel our visitors are departed & quite singular labour is again embarked upon we have upon the frames three transparencies the designs of two are already outlined & are armour clad men in appropriate landscapes (Wainwright, 174)' Wainwright notes that 'these transparencies could refer to cartoons for stained glass, but they more probably refer to transparent painted roller blinds of a type popular at the time' (ibid., 174-5). On 11 May 1816 Terry wrote again to Scott: '... nor the window blinds for Abbotsford are forgotten with the restored health of the artist [Mrs Terry] they will be proceded with' (ibid.). In September 1818 Terry advised Scott: 'I think you will like your windows with your arms, old abbots, knights and the Stirling heads with their coloured borders and ornaments' (ibid.). The following month Scott wrote to a friend that 'Naesmythe and his daughter Mrs Terry have arrived here unexpectedly', presumably to see how work was progressing on the house (ibid.). 
Elizabeth continued with her painting, sending works to the British Institution from 1816 to 1829. Her style is perhaps the coldest and least painterly of the sisters, a rare signed example being 'Driving Cattle by a Loch' (priv. coll.). Though identifiable as of the 'Nasmyth school', and competently finished, her work is stylistically less romantic. This is partly due to her use of bright colours, which distinguishes her work from that of her sisters. Her works tend to be inscribed on the stretcher 'Elizabeth Nasmyth'. 
The Terrys lived in London at 9 Devonshire Street, Portland Place. A letter of 1832 from Alexander Nasmyth to T. W. Winstanley indicates that Elizabeth stored unsold paintings and helped her father to organize his London life. She also ran art classes with her sister Anne from this address. Correspondence between Daniel Terry and Scott records Elizabeth's difficulty in having children. The couple had three children, Walter Scott Terry ('b'. 1816), Jane Terry ('b'. 1821), and Elizabeth Terry ('b'. 1822). Daniel Terry died after a long struggle with illness and financial difficulty on 12 June 1829. Elizabeth then married the lexicographer Charles Richardson (1775-1865) on 23 May 1835. They had no children. She died at 9 Charlwood Road, Putney, Surrey, on 10 July 1862 and was buried with her husband in Putney Lower Common cemetery. A lengthy epitaph on her tombstone erected by her broken-hearted husband testifies to a long and happy marriage.

Anne Gibson Nasmyth (1798-1874) was born on 13 November 1798 in Princes Street, St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh. She assisted her sister Elizabeth with classes in her London home and between 1829 and 1838 exhibited sixteen works in the London galleries, including one at the Royal Academy. Her work demonstrates her fondness for highland and sometimes stormy scenery. Her paintings vary from close emulation of her father's style to others reminiscent of Charlotte's (for example, 'Windsor', repro. in Johnson and Money). She also produced some precise pictures of small gardens, their conservatories, and plantings, such as 'Garden Scene' (repro. in Johnson and Money). She signed her work Anne Nasmyth or 'A Nasmyth'. When they first set up as engineers in 1831 Anne spent time with her brothers James and George in Manchester. There she met an engineer, William Bennett, whom she married in London at the parish church of St Pancras on 13 August 1838. She was the only one of Alexander Nasmyth's children to follow him to Italy, and spent her honeymoon in Rome. The Bennetts lived first in Leaf Square, Salford, Lancashire, and afterwards moved, in 1851, to Charlwood Road, Putney, where their home became a pivotal point for the Nasmyth daughters and granddaughters. She died on 28 January 1874, having been widowed in 1866, and was buried with her husband beside her four sisters.

Richard Lingard (d. 1655), Church of Ireland clergyman, with whom he has often been confused. The elder Lingard is said to have been educated at Cambridge University 'about the year 1620, or during the reign of King James' (Stokes, 'Worthies', 4) and proceeded to Ireland, where he was ordained deacon on 22 October 1621 and priest on 22 October 1622 by Thomas Ram, bishop of Ferns and Leighlin. He became vicar of Killaire on 5 November 1630 and by September 1633 had been collated to the vicarage of St Mary's, Athlone, and later to that of Killcleagh and the curacy of Ballyloughloe. In March 1639 he was appointed archdeacon of Clonmacnoise and was granted the rectorial tithes of his Athlone benefice as an augmentation by Charles I, the tithes of Ratoath, co. Meath, being added.

Theodosia Abrams (c.1769-1849), singer, seems to have made her debut in the Concerts of Antient Music in 1783, and she was the youngest of the principal vocal performers listed for the 1784 Handel commemoration concerts. She then appeared in almost every concert and private entertainment in which Harriett performed, singing as a soloist as well as in ensembles. On 6 August 1804, at Plympton St Maurice, Devon, she married the 21-year-old Thomas Fisher (1782-1810), a captain in the North Devon militia, who died in May or June 1810, leaving her with two children, Charles and Harriett. On 17 March 1812, at St Margaret's, Westminster, she married Joseph Garrow (1789-1857), the clever, musical, and artistic son of a Scottish father and Indian mother, who had trained as a lawyer but never practised. Their only child, Theodosia ['see 'Trollope, Theodosia], was born on 28 November 1816. The Garrows lived in Torquay, where Joseph became the friend and correspondent of Walter Savage Landor and where the poet Elizabeth Barrett found him 'a sensible intelligent man & an active magistrate' ('Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning', 1.316). On a continental tour with her parents, the younger Theodosia met Thomas Adolphus Trollope, elder brother of the novelist Anthony Trollope, and they married in April 1848. Tom Trollope remembered his mother-in-law as still vigorous, 'a very fierce old lady' with 'brilliant and fierce black eyes' (Trollope, 156). He relates how the composer and pianist John Baptist Cramer had told him admiringly that she had been able to pick out a false note played by a single instrument in a large orchestra. Mount Edgcumbe described Theodosia's voice as the most beautiful contralto he had ever heard, and found it still unimpaired in 1834. Her health declined after the death of her daughter Harriett in Florence on 12 November 1848 and the Garrows returned to England the following June. She died at her home, The Braddons, South-Hill, Torquay, Devon, on 4 November 1849. Her death was attributed on her death certificate to deranged digestion, abscess, and exhaustion. She was buried at St Saviour, Tormoham, Devon, on 8 November 1849.

Anne Radcliffe, countess of Sussex (d. 1579x82), was the daughter of Sir Philip Calthorp, a Norfolk landowner, and his second wife, Jane Blennerhassett. She and Sussex had three children: Egremont Radcliffe; Maud, who died young; and Frances, who married Sir Thomas Mildmay. But the relationship proved stormy, at least partly because of religious differences. Sussex's conservatism was not shared by his wife, who had a position in Queen Katherine Parr's household and shared the latter's evangelicalism -- she was one of the queen's ladies whom Anne Askew was pressed to incriminate in 1546. But there seem to have been other differences. In 1552 the countess was in the Tower, charged with sorcery, and when she fled abroad after Mary's accession her husband divorced her; in November 1553 a bill was introduced into parliament 'against the adulterous living of the late countess of Sussex' (Loach, 71). The bill did not pass, nor did another in 1555 which would have deprived her of her jointure unless she came back to England and underwent purgation before a bishop. But she may have returned, for in the following year she acted as intermediary between the French ambassador and Princess Elizabeth, when the latter was contemplating flight abroad. In April 1557 she was in the Fleet prison, but the bill which finally passed in 1558 was somewhat more generous over her jointure than the abortive previous ones had been.

John Varley (1850-1933), son of Albert Fleetwood and his wife, Caroline Roper, was born on 26 January 1850, at New Road, Fulham, London. He achieved a considerable reputation for his views, in watercolour and oil, of Egypt, particularly street scenes of Cairo, and views of the Nile, and also of India and Japan, France and Italy, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1876 and 1895, and which were the subject of one-person shows in London in 1904 and 1913. Like his grandfather, he was interested in astrology and the occult. He and his wife, Isabella, 'nee' Pollexfen, aunt of the poet W. B. Yeats, whom he married in 1876, were drawn to theosophy and were members of the inner circle gathered round Madame Blavatsky in 1883-4. He died of cancer at the Imperial Nursing Home, Montpellier Parade, Cheltenham, on 20 May 1933, leaving at least one daughter.

A third generation protestant, born in Paris of unknown parentage and learned in ancient and modern languages excluding English, Turval arrived in England in 1603, perhaps in the train of the marquis de Rosny, the French ambassador. He settled in London, retaining friends in the embassy. Turval was often employed by James I on secret errands to France. He translated the king's 'Apologie for the Oath of Allegiance' into French, and hid for three months in Paris to get it printed there in 1609. The next year he translated extracts from Joseph Hall's works, and similarly arranged printing in Paris.

Born at 239 Woodstock Road, Oxford, on 20 July 1909, he was the eldest of the three children of John Garrett Bussell (1883-1915), clergyman and schoolmaster, and his wife, Dorothea Bickerton (1885-1962). His father was killed in action at Ypres when Jan was six. His mother encouraged his early passion for model theatre productions and was amused rather than annoyed by his defection from Brasenose College, Oxford, to join Edward Stirling's English Players in France. On his return to London he met Waldo Lanchester and Harry W. Whanslaw, then running the London Marionette Theatre, and there he served his apprenticeship as a puppeteer. He was instrumental in securing a booking for the London Marionette Theatre with John Logie Baird, who was experimenting with television. Their performance of Pirandello's 'The Man with the Flower in his Mouth' was in 1931 one of the first puppet productions to be transmitted. At the Players' Theatre he met Ann Hogarth, and in 1932 they set up their own puppet company, the Hogarth Puppets. The couple married on 23 March 1933 and spent their honeymoon camping and touring the Cotswolds with the Hogarth Puppets. They did everything themselves, booking the church halls, advertising, carrying scenery and puppets, selling tickets, showing people to their seats, and finally performing their puppet circus show, billed as 'One and a half hours of scintillating entertainment!' There followed more and more complex productions, and fifty years of touring both in Britain and around the world.

Basil William Douglas, Lord Daer (1763-1794) was born on 16 March 1763, the second but eldest surviving son of Dunbar Douglas, fourth earl of Selkirk (1722-1799), and Helen (1737/8-1802), daughter of John Hamilton of Blackadder, Berwickshire. A younger brother, Thomas Douglas, fifth earl of Selkirk, achieved prominence as an advocate of colonization in North America. Daer was educated first at Anna and Rochemont Barbauld's school at Palgrave, Suffolk, and later at Edinburgh University under the moral philosopher Dugald Stewart. In 1789 he travelled to Paris, from where he returned with an enthusiasm for the French Revolution, becoming an active protagonist in the British reform movement. He was one of the earliest LCS activists and held concurrent membership of the Society for Constitutional Information and the Scottish Association of the Friends of the People. This provided the LCS with an important early link to other reform societies. Though a strong critic of the union (1707), Daer called for English and Scottish radical societies to work together 'to have mutually beneficial results: providing Scots with greater say in government while relieving you of that vermin from this country who infect your court, parliament and every establishment' (Daer to Charles Grey, 18 Jan 1793, quoted in Bewley, 54-5). Daer's radical career, however, was cut short when he died, unmarried, from tuberculosis on 5 November 1794 at Ivybridge, Devon; he was buried in Exeter Cathedral. 
Over the years the LCS continued to attract men of prominent social and professional standing. Although the egalitarian nature and constitution of the society meant that these men were treated equally, there were distinct advantages in recruiting members from the higher social ranks. Many brought a certain image of respectability to the LCS, while others maintained important links with middle-class reform associations and provided, through their professions, a certain strategic advantage. Barristers and attorneys were particularly useful in providing advice during the society's continual legal engagements. Members among this group included James Agar, Peregrine Palmer, Felix Vaughan, and John Pierce, who served as assistant secretary to the LCS. Joseph Gerrald was another attorney who played a particularly important role in the LCS during its formative years. In 1793, as delegate of the LCS, he travelled to the British Convention of the Friends of the People in Edinburgh, where he was arrested and subsequently transported to Botany Bay as one of the five 'Scottish martyrs'. Maurice Margarot was another member of 'superior education, intellect, and information' (Thale, xxii) who accompanied Gerrald to the British Convention as an LCS delegate. Margarot was one of the first members, along with Hardy, to rise to a position of prominence within the society. He served as chairman, authored addresses, composed the society's correspondence, and contributed to the drafting of its constitution. His formal association with the LCS, however, ceased when he too was transported to Australia in 1794. 
Physicians were also well represented, among them Richard Barrow, William Hodgson, and Robert Thomas Crossfield, who served as president of the society in 1798. Undoubtedly the most significant physician active in the LCS was James Parkinson, a prolific and powerful propagandist who was a regular contributor to the society's campaign. Another member, the surgeon John Gale Jones, was an accomplished orator who displayed his skills at LCS mass meetings. In 1796 he was sent, along with John Binns, on an important mission as a representative of the LCS to Birmingham, Maidstone, Portsmouth, Rochester, and other areas of southern England to gauge the state of reform activity and to enliven interest in the campaign for reform. 
Apart from these well-placed members, the LCS also benefited considerably during the early stages from the contribution of educated men who were not formal members of the society but who were closely acquainted with Hardy and other early recruits. Veteran reformers such as Thomas Brand Hollis, John Cartwright, Daniel Stuart, and John Horne Tooke provided valuable advice which Hardy later acknowledged: 'Much political information I frequently received from gentlemen experienced in the cause of Reform which was communicated to the Society and received with great approbation, and which was of much use in regulating their conduct as a Society' (Thale, xxii). 
Despite the influence of such individuals, the LCS was primarily conceived as a working-class organization -- a forum for tradesmen, mechanics, and shopkeepers. As Hardy once asserted, the LCS was to represent those who were 'but few in number and humble in situation and circumstances' (Graham, 282). The low weekly subscription of 1died reflected this aim, and the society's campaign for annual parliaments and universal manhood suffrage was designed to appeal to the disenfranchised citizens. Such inducements were indeed successful, with shoemakers, weavers, and tailors the three largest employment categories of the known members. To some contemporary detractors the LCS was nothing more than a group of illiterate rabble-rousers, 'the very lowest order of society... filthy & ragged... wretched looking blackguards' who were being unscrupulously led by a minority 'who possess strong but unimproved faculties' (Thale, xix). The general membership profile of the LCS was, however, quite unlike this characterization. The majority of members were recruited from a politically conscious and articulate artisan population, and those of higher social and professional standing were rarely placed in authoritative positions within the society for fear that, as Hardy stated, the ordinary members would be discouraged from 'exerting themselves in their own cause' (Goodwin, 197).

John Ashley (c.1762-1829), shoemaker and radical, served as secretary to the LCS after Hardy's resignation in 1794. On 12 November 1795 he addressed an outdoor LCS meeting near Copenhagen House, London, which attracted a crowd of some 300,000-400,000 people. He resigned as secretary in December 1796, and as a delegate of his division several months later, before leaving the society in June 1797. Ashley, described by one colleague as 'a serious thinking man' (Thale, xx), moved to Paris in June 1797, where he is thought to have prospered in business. There he maintained his radical activities, providing the French directory with inflated estimates of the number of pro-French sympathizers in London who were 'active and decided men... ready to co-operate against the Government' (Goodwin, 437). He was also active in a militant circle of United Irish emigres who worked for a rising in Ireland before his death in 1829. 
It was Ashley who introduced Francis Place to the LCS. Place quickly rose to prominence in 1795, serving as chairman of the general committee, which co-ordinated the activities of the different divisions, and of the executive committee, which dealt with the society's correspondence and the writing of addresses and resolutions. Like Place, John Thelwall came from an artisan background to become a central character in London's reform movement, joining the LCS in 1793, where he proved a highly effective lecturer and propagandist. Not all working-class members were as gifted as Thelwall, nor did many have such enduring careers, yet the LCS provided ordinary and obscure men with the chance to acquire some standing within the society. Robert Oliphant, for instance, a tailor, and Anthony Beck, a saddler, served at various times as treasurer; John Philip Franklow, another tailor, James Savage, warehouseman, and Benjamin Pemberton Binns, a plumber and brother of John Binns, each served as assistant secretaries of the society.

Thomas Stiff (b. c.1740, d. in or before 1808), hairdresser and radical, the son of a victualler Bartholomew Stiff of Lawrence Haltham, Berkshire, was another LCS member with an apparent interest in arming the society. On 2 April 1754 he was bound as an apprentice for seven years to Stephen Goodson, a barber, and on 2 June 1761 was admitted to the freedom of the Worshipful Company of Barbers. A year later he established a barber shop in Paternoster Row, London, and remained there for his entire career. By 1793 he was a member of the LCS and served as delegate to division 13. His premises were sometimes used as the meeting place for LCS committees and in 1794 he drew a print showing military and arming exercises. The print proved particularly useful, with one colleague commenting that, as a result of the drawing, 'many of the Members [of the LCS] already know their Exercise' and that Stiff was very capable at training those who were yet to learn (Thale, 149). Stiff disappears from LCS records after 1794 and is marked as dead in the records of the Worshipful Company of Barbers in 1808. 
The subversive activities of the LCS were a great concern to the government, which employed an intricate network of spies to infiltrate the society. Often recruited from the working classes, men such as Henry Alexander, linen draper, Edward Gosling, hairdresser, George Lynam, ironmonger, and Frederick Polydore Nodder, botanic painter, blended with other members of the LCS and moved freely among their radical subjects. James Powell, a clerk, was something of a double agent, acting as assistant secretary to the LCS in 1797 and reporting frequently to the government.

William Metcalfe (fl. 1778-1799), attorney and spy, was another informer who operated effectively within the society. His background remains obscure, but on 16 June 1778 he was elected clerk of the Tallow Chandlers Company, a position which he held by annual election until he was discharged on 5 September 1799 for financial irregularities. As an attorney he had been employed by the government in conducting criminal cases in the mid-1780s, and in 1793 he was again working in an official capacity on 'business of confidence and secrecy' in Shropshire, Worcestershire, and Liverpool (Thale, 126). Early in 1794 he began spying on the LCS and at Thelwall's lectures, for which he was to receive a sum of $300 per annum. His usefulness, however, came to an abrupt end in September 1794 when, at the request of the government, he was revealed as a spy during the capture of Paul Thomas Lemaitre and other LCS members accused of the so-called Popgun Plot to murder George III. Following this Metcalfe virtually disappears from public record apart from his involvement until 1799 with the Tallow Chandlers Company. 
Reports of spies often provided the government with the bulk of evidence required to take legal action against those society members suspected of subversive intentions, and it was the treason trials of 1794 which marked a decisive point in the history of the LCS. In May thirteen men, all members of the LCS or the Society for Constitutional Information, were indicted for high treason. Hardy, Tooke, and Thelwall were the only men eventually brought to trial, and though each was acquitted many LCS members were subsequently discouraged, disillusioned, and frightened. While the society's membership showed signs of improving during the next twelve months, the government's 'Treason and Sedition Acts' (1795) effectively sent the LCS into a downward spiral. Internal schisms had also fractured the group, with secessionist organizations such as the London Reforming Society, the Friends of Liberty, and the Friends of Religious and Civil Liberty (consisting of disgruntled Methodists) forming in 1795. 
During 1796 the society fell into financial trouble through a combination of declining membership revenue and legal expenses, as well as costs associated with staging massive outdoor meetings and the unprofitable publication of the 'Moral and Political Magazine'. By 1798 the government again adopted repressive measures to quell radical activity, and in April of that year mass arrests crippled the LCS. The 'Habeas Corpus Act' was suspended, and some of the men captured were detained in prison without trial for up to three years. A few defiant LCS members continued to meet following these arrests, but the society, along with the United Englishmen, United Scotsmen, United Britons, and United Irishmen, was outlawed by name in legislation passed on 12 July 1799.

Sheridan William Robin Russell (1900-1991) was the younger son of Henry Russell ('c'.1870-1937), professor of singing, and his wife, Nina, 'nee' Andrade ('b'. 1870). Music was a prominent theme in his family: Russell's father became artistic director of first the San Carlo and later the Boston Opera companies; his uncle, Sir Landon Ronald (1873-1938), was a composer and conductor, as was his paternal grandfather, Henry Russell (1812?-1900). His mother was the daughter of a Spanish leather merchant and his Portuguese wife. Both parents were of partly Jewish descent. Sheridan Russell grew up in Rome, Paris, Boston, and London, with little formal education but on familiar terms with singers and composers of the times. He became a young virtuoso cellist, but because of a hearing defect (first noticed by Debussy) had later to abandon this career -- although not his musical and artistic interests. Fluent in French, English, and Italian, he was recruited for work at Bletchley Park and later in the war was transferred, with the rank of captain, to work with the Italian partisans. His change to social work after the war led to another distinguished career as head almoner at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases. While there he started the flourishing and nationwide Paintings in Hospital charity -- to which in its early days he persuaded Matthew Smith, among other well-known painters, to contribute works.

George Mattocks (1734/5-1804), singer and theatre manager, sang as a boy at Southwark fair in September 1746, and in August 1748 was advertised as singing and dancing at Bartholomew fair. A Miss Mattocks, perhaps his elder sister, acted minor roles at Southwark fair and at the Goodman's Fields Theatre in autumn 1746 and appeared at Covent Garden in early 1748. The young George Mattocks sang at Drury Lane in February and March 1749 in 'The Triumph of Peace', Thomas Arne's masque celebrating the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. He remained at Drury Lane until summer 1752, singing between the acts and in musical pieces and acting Donalbain in 'Macbeth'. After appearing in the provinces during the next few years, he returned to London to play Macheath in 'The Beggar's Opera' at Covent Garden on 1 November 1757, advertised as having 'never appeared on that stage or any other these 6 years' (Stone, 623). In fact, he had sung the role for his benefit at Norwich earlier in 1757.

At some date he married; his wife, Elizabeth, survived him. There is no evidence of any children. By 1648 he was curate of Maghull in the parish of Hassall, Lancashire. There he signed the harmonious consent of the presbyterian ministers in Lancashire. The Commonwealth church survey of Lancashire found him 'a painful and godly minister' (Fishwick, 87). On 23 December 1660 a William Aspinwall -- in all probability this man -- was one of the signatories to the address and petition to the king by sixty ministers of the gospel in Lancashire. Little is known of him after his ejection, but he probably stayed in the Maghull area, as he was described in the parish register as of Aughton, 3 miles from Maghull, when he was buried at Ormskirk on 3 December 1673.

Oonagh Guinness (1910-1995), born on 22 February 1910. The three Guinness sisters were to be celebrated as the Golden Guinness Girls of 1920s fashionable society. Their upbringing was both very luxurious and, according to Maureen in later life, loveless. Ernest Guinness took the family brewing business under his wing. His private passions -- the brewery, yachting, and every kind of technical innovation -- completely dominated his life. A martinet who insisted that the domestic routine ran with calculated precision, he gave his daughters every advantage that money and position could buy (including in 1923 a world cruise in his state-of-the-art yacht 'Fantome II'), but little understanding. After 'coming out' in the mid-1920s, they took London by storm. They were as gay and beautiful as they were wealthy, and titled young men fell over themselves to win their favours. 'They are all transparent-skinned, with pale hair and light blue eyes. You can very nearly see through them', wrote film director John Huston ('The Times', 6 April 1999). With figures in the style of the duchess of Windsor, they made throughout their lives striking fashion statements, and were great favourites with gossip columnists and society photographers; in later life Maureen had a penchant for diamante-encrusted, horn-rimmed spectacles. They enjoyed an inexhaustible flow of money and relished to the utmost the irresponsible lifestyle espoused by the fashionable elite. When the golden age came to an end, the golden girls, like brilliant parakeets in a coal shed, found it impossible to adapt to a world that had become drab and serious.

Helen Mary Cherry (1915-2001), actress, was born on 24 November 1915 at Thurgarton, Worsley, Lancashire, daughter of (John) William Cherry, a works manager then serving as a captain in the 45th provisional battalion, and his wife, Annie, 'nee' Nall. Educated in Harrogate, she trained as a commercial artist, intending to be a theatrical designer, but instead found work in northern repertory; her first part was as an extra in 'The Vagabond King' in Manchester in 1938. Her London debut was in Herbert Farjeon's revue 'In Town Again' at the Criterion in 1940. Spotted by Robert Atkins, actor-manager of the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, London, she appeared in many of his productions there, at the Westminster Theatre, and -- after a season at Alec Clunes's Arts Theatre, where she met Howard -- at the Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon. Her Rosalind in 'As You Like It' (1943) was particularly well received. After the war she remained in demand for Shakespeare and Restoration comedy, though she also appeared in many modern plays. Her Ursula in John Gielgud's production of 'Much Ado About Nothing' at the Palace Theatre in 1955 earned outstanding reviews; her Goneril in his 'Japanese' 'King Lear' the same season was also acclaimed, though critics disliked the production. Her last West End appearance was in 'Ladies in Retirement' at the Fortune Theatre in 1982. She appeared in more than twenty films, mostly derived from stage plays. She also featured in many television productions and reached a wider audience through the quiz show 'Guess My Story'. Tall, auburn-haired, and blue-eyed, she was renowned for her elegance and sense of style. She bore her husband's philandering with stoicism, and after his death was quick to defend his reputation. She died on 27 September 2001 at the BUPA Hospital, Heathbourne Road, Bushey, Hertfordshire, of multiple organ failure and cerebrovascular disease.

Edmund Bedingfield (1443-1496), who was the son of Thomas Bedingfield (died 1453) and Anne Waldegrave (died 1453). It was Edmund who decided to move the family's main residence to Oxburgh, erecting a fine brick-built moated house there about 1482. Oxburgh thereafter became the home of the main branch of the family with cadet branches residing at Quidenham in Norfolk, Redlingfield and Bedingfield in Suffolk, and elsewhere. Edmund, a Yorkist supporter, was knighted by Richard III about 1483, but the family soon accommodated itself to the Tudor regime, entertaining Henry VII and the court at Oxburgh in 1487. Sir Edmund was married twice, first to Alice Shelton and then to Margaret Scot (died 1514). 
On Edmund's death at Oxburgh in 1496, his eldest son, Thomas (died 1539), succeeded to the estate. Thomas was knighted at the coronation of Henry VIII, but it was Edmund and Margaret's youngest son and eventual heir,

Sir Edmund Bedingfield (1479/80-1553), who served the dynasty most successfully, being knighted for his bravery in the French wars by Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, in 1523. He was later entrusted with the custody of Katherine of Aragon at Kimbolton Castle in Huntingdonshire after the royal divorce and was responsible for the arrangements for her funeral procession from there to Peterborough in 1536. In 1539, aged fifty-nine, he inherited Oxburgh from his brother Robert. He married Grace Marney (died in or after 1553), the daughter of Henry, first Baron Marney, and had died by June 1553, when he was succeeded by his son Sir Henry Bedingfeld (1509x11-1583). Henry was a privy councillor to Mary Tudor but remained a staunch Roman Catholic under Elizabeth, which led to the family's withdrawal from active participation in national and county politics by the time of his death. His recusancy occasionally brought him into conflict with diocesan authorities, and members of the family (especially his son John) were often cited before the courts; however, the relative isolation of their main estates around Oxburgh and their detachment from more politically active forms of Catholicism afforded some protection to the family. Henry was succeeded in turn by his son Edmund (died 1585) and grandson Thomas (died 1590).

Sir Henry Bedingfield (1581/2-1657), the son of Thomas Bedingfield and Frances Jernegan, was still a child at his father's death and the ensuing minority compounded the effect of the family's recusancy, increasing its financial difficulties and further excluding its members from engagement in local politics. By this time the family had withdrawn socially into the recusant community, forging marriage alliances with such other well-known East Anglian Catholic families as the Southwells and the Jerninghams. In 1604 Henry, then aged twenty-two, reinforced the alliance by marrying Mary (died by 1611), daughter of Lord William Howard of Naworth (Cumberland) and granddaughter of the duke of Norfolk, who had been executed for treason in 1572. Like many other Roman Catholic gentry, Henry was a loyal supporter of Charles I and was restored to the county bench in the 1620s. During the civil wars he raised troops for the king and three of his sons took up arms; one of them, John, was killed at the battle of Worcester. Henry was knighted for his services to the crown about 1645, but after the defeat of Charles he was imprisoned in the Tower from 1647 to 1649. There he composed a meditation on the passion which he dedicated to his second wife, Elizabeth Hoghton (died 1662), of the well-known Lancashire Catholic family, whom he had married in 1611. As an active royalist Henry's estates were sequestered by parliament in 1652 and the house suffered extensive damage from fire at this time. He was succeeded at his death on 22 November 1657 by his eldest son Thomas (died 1665), who had been a colonel in the royalist army and was wounded during the siege of Lincoln, and on Thomas's death by Henry's second son,

Sir Henry Bedingfield (d. 1685), who had been living abroad with the royal court since the end of the civil wars. Another son, Edmund, had been educated abroad at St Omer and was ordained priest at Seville about 1644; he later returned to Flanders as chaplain to the Carmelite nuns at Antwerp, where two of his cousins had been sisters, and he moved with that community to its new home at Lierre in Brabant in 1648, remaining there as a canon of the cathedral until his death on 2 September 1680. During the 1650s two other cousins of the Suffolk branch of the family resident at Bedingfield were also working in Flanders as Jesuit priests, one of them, Henry (died 1659), as provincial of the order there. 
At the restoration of Charles II the royalist Henry Bedingfield returned to England but not to Oxburgh, where the damage done to the house and the losses incurred on the estate during the wars, estimated by him at more than $45,000, proved too daunting. In recognition of his service to the Stuarts he was made a baronet by Charles II in 1661, but no financial recompense was forthcoming. Henry made safe the buildings at Oxburgh when he finally regained possession of it and the family's other Norfolk properties in 1665, but chose to reside at Beck Hall near Billingford from 1660 until his death on 24 February 1685. He retained the family's strong attachment to Roman Catholicism, having married a member of another Norfolk recusant family, Margaret Paston (died 1703) of Appleton, in 1634. Two of their daughters joined the Carmelite nuns at Lierre, where their uncle Edmund was chaplain; another, Frances, married Richard Caryll of West Grinstead, the younger son of a recusant family which produced many priests and religious figures during the eighteenth century; and a fourth, Mary, married Thomas Eyre of Hassop in Derbyshire, with whom she had ten children, two sons entering the priesthood and two daughters becoming nuns. In the house at Oxburgh there is an attractive votive painting showing the family of Sir Henry under the protection of Our Lady's mantle: Sir Henry is depicted in his armour and two of his daughters are in their nun's habits, while in the background there are two scenes depicting his escape from the battle at Marston Moor and his subsequent departure overseas. It is true to say that, notwithstanding its connections among the recusant families of East Anglia and further afield, the immediate circle of the Bedingfields at this time was as likely to be found on the continent as in England. 
The continental connection was most pronounced through the branch of the family which resided at Redlingfield and which was descended from John, the third son of Sir Henry Bedingfeld (1509x11-1583). John was a known harbourer of priests and was reputed always to have kept a priest in his house. This was a tradition maintained by his son Francis (died 1644), who also educated his children on the continent, where they were to make a substantial contribution to English Catholic life. Francis and his wife, Katherine Fortescue, had eleven daughters who all became nuns, and it is worth recording some of their careers. Helena (1603-1661), the eldest, went to St Omer when she was eight to live with her grandmother, who was resident there. She was professed in 1622 at the Augustinian house at Louvain where her aunt, Mary Fortescue, was also a nun. In 1629 she was sent with others to establish a house at Bruges; eventually she became prioress of the community, and she retained the position until her death in 1661, when she was succeeded by her niece Mary Bedingfield, who continued as prioress until her own death in 1693. The community at Bruges also included Grace Bedingfield, a sister of Helena, who had been professed at Louvain in 1635, and Elizabeth, the widow of Sir Alexander Hamilton and the mother of Mary, who was prioress in 1661. Margaret, the second daughter of Francis, joined the Poor Clares at Gravelines in 1624, and moved in 1645 to the community of Rouen where she too became the superior. A younger sister, Anne (1623-1697), also joined the Poor Clares at Gravelines; she was professed in 1639 and elected as abbess in 1667, a post which she held for thirty years until her death. The third daughter, Philippa (died 1636), entered the Benedictine community at Ghent, being professed as Sister Thecla in 1630; she died there on 14 December 1636, having filled the office of infirmarer. Catherine, the sixth daughter (1614-1650), entered the Carmelite convent at Antwerp in 1632, taking the name Lucy. She was subsequently sent to the convent at Dusseldorf as sub-prioress, but was recalled to Antwerp, where she died in 1650 as prioress. Another sister, Magdalen (1621-1684), also joined the Antwerp Carmelites and subsequently moved to Dusseldorf, where she became sub-prioress and then prioress. She was then chosen to head a new community, established by Philip, elector palatine of the Rhine, at Newburg, and remained there until her death in 1684. Her reputation for sanctity was enhanced in 1727, when her body was found to be entire and 'the habit she was buried in whole and not the least rotted' (Coleridge, 54). Three other sisters joined the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the order recently founded by Mary Ward. Winifred (1610-1666) had been entrusted to the care of Mary Ward as a young woman and later joined the institute; she became head of the Munich house in 1631, when the community there faced financial ruin. Despite her youth she was an effective administrator and leader, freeing the house from debt before her death in 1666. 
Another sister, Mary, also joined the institute, but the most celebrated member of this impressive sisterhood was

Henry Bedingfield (d. 1704), to Lady Anne Howard (died 1682). The newlyweds lived at Oxburgh and, following the death of his father in 1685, the second baronet set about restoring the house and estate, making it the centre of a Jesuit mission and becoming well known for the hospitality he provided there. Despite the financial and legal penalties which continued to inconvenience Roman Catholics, from this period the Bedingfields could now settle to the life of country landowners, entering into the social if not the political life of the county and acting as supportive landlords to the tenantry on their estates. A period of renewed prosperity meant that outwardly the lifestyle of the family did not differ greatly from that of their protestant neighbours, though domestically it continued to be marked by their Catholic piety and their children were still educated abroad. Following the death of Anne in 1682, the second baronet married Elizabeth Arundell (died 1690), and in 1699 their son,

Henry Arundell Bedingfield (d. 1760), travelled to Lierre, where his three sisters were staying at the convent with their aunt Margaret and two of their Eyre cousins who were nuns there, probably to attend the celebrations on the fiftieth anniversary of the convent. Henry and his sisters then moved on to Brussels with Henry's tutor, Thomas Marwood, whose diary records their stay there and provides details of the extensive networks of English Catholics in the Low Countries at this time and the social and religious milieu in which they lived. The Bedingfield daughters returned to Lierre to continue their education before they moved on to the Benedictine convent at Dunkirk, where one of their Caryll aunts was abbess. Henry Arundell and Marwood remained behind in Brussels, where Henry's education was continued by his tutor and the Jesuits, who had a school there. They left Brussels later in 1700 and, travelling under the alias of Nelson, Henry Arundell moved around the Low Countries with his tutor, often staying with family members at various convents until, in January 1701, they arrived in Paris on their way to the Jesuit college at La Fleche. This college, which had English Jesuits on its staff, educated a number of English Catholic gentlemen; among them Henry Arundell found a friend from another Norfolk family, James Waldegrave, with whom he spent one holiday travelling to Mont-St Michel, as well as sons of other well-known recusant families: Brudenell, Scrope, Browne, and Widdrington. Henry Arundell remained at the school until 1705 when, following the death of his father a few months earlier on 14 September 1704, he returned briefly to Oxburgh before setting out on the grand tour in 1710. He returned again to Oxburgh in 1713 and set about improving the estate and remodelling the house, rebuilding the south-east wing. Henry Arundell continued as a Roman Catholic, registering his Norfolk estates at the annual value of $1551 in 1715, though he later married a protestant, Lady Elizabeth Boyle (died 1755), daughter of the earl of Burlington. Their son, Richard, was educated abroad by the Jesuits at St Omer, but despite having Jacobite sympathies the family accommodated itself to the Hanoverian regime. It continued to produce priests, and a cousin of Henry Arundell, Anthony, of the Redlingfield branch, joined the Jesuits and was ordained priest at Ghent in 1723. Anthony worked at Flixton in Suffolk during the 1730s and later in Liverpool before eventually returning to Flanders, where he died at Liege on 2 June 1752. Henry Arundell Bedingfield died at Oxburgh on 15 July 1760. 
The family's adherence to Catholicism throughout the period cost it dearly both in political power and financially throughout the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries, though some recovery was seen after 1700. Its close association with the Stuarts led to two members of the family, from cadet branches, achieving public positions in the law, albeit briefly: Sir Thomas Bedingfield (1591/2-1661) was appointed a serjeant-at-law by Charles II at the Restoration, and Sir Henry Bedingfield (bap. 1632, d. 1687) acted as chief justice of the common pleas under James II. To that degree the story of the Bedingfields is representative of the history of post-Reformation English Catholicism, but unexceptionally so, as there was no martyr and the family kept aloof from plots. What marks it out as exceptional in these years, however, is the number of members, especially among the women, who entered the religious life, and the influence which they exercised on the English Catholic community abroad, as leaders of religious communities, educators of the sons and daughters of the Catholic gentry, and providers of hospitality to their co-religionists. In this respect their experience testifies to the close contact between English and continental Catholicism during this period, contact often overlooked in the traditional accounts of the social isolation of Catholic gentry families within English society at the time. 
Under the terms of her will of 1513, Margaret, widow of Sir Edmund Bedingfield, established a chantry chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity in Oxburgh parish church, which became the burial place for succeeding generations of the family and the location of a number of monuments and memorials to its members.

On 25 March 1480 he either already was or was newly appointed as a member of the ensemble of four adult professional singers which since before 1400 had been employed at Westminster Abbey to enhance with polyphonic music the observance of the daily Lady mass and evening Marian antiphon performed in the lady chapel there. Composers of music in these genres had lately expanded its sonority and scope by adding boys' voices to the long-established performing ensemble of men's voices alone. Cornysh was now appointed to raise a team of six boys from the abbey's flourishing almonry school, whom he was to train as singing-boys and with whom he was to expand and modernize the resources of the existing lady chapel choir.

He was apprenticed to Charles Hatfield in 1737 and turned over to David Willaume in 1742, taking his freedom in 1744. From 1767 to 1793 he lived at the sign of the Golden Cup, Air Street, St James, Westminster. The mark TP in a square box, presumably entered in a register of the Goldsmiths' Company, now lost, is assumed to be his. His trade card announced him as a working silversmith, making and selling all sorts of large and small plate. He produced dessert baskets and stands, and specialized in epergnes -- an elaborate type of centrepiece for table decoration -- some of these being in fashionable chinoiserie style. These wares were retailed through Parker and Wakelin and other suppliers to the luxury domestic plate market. It is not known when he died but, according to the rate books, Thomas's Air Street premises were taken over in 1794/5 by the silversmith Paul Storr.

Joseph Pitts was turned over immediately to Philip Day, plate case maker and leather-seller, and when made free in 1781 described himself as a plate case maker, a practitioner of an important ancillary craft to that of the silversmith; he was at Frith Street in the same year, when he took an apprentice. William [i] Pitts took his freedom in 1784, having registered his first mark, WP in an oval, as a platemaker at 17 St Martin's Street, Leicester Fields. He married Mary Armitage on 30 December 1782. A second registration in 1786 gave his address as 26 Litchfield Street, which remained good for the third, in partnership with Joseph Preedy, registered as W.P over I.P in an oval. Pitts and Preedy produced the same wares as Pitts's father. In the Regency period they took up the manufacture of ornate candelabra in a neo-rococo style. His fourth registration, in 1799, shows him trading alone at 15 Little Wild Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields; for the fifth, in 1806, he was at 14 James Street, Lambeth Marsh, and in the same year his own son William [ii] Pitts was apprenticed to him.

John Cleveley the elder (c.1712-1777), the son of Samuel Cleveley, a joiner of Newington Butts, Southwark, who was already dead when, perhaps aged about fourteen, his son was apprenticed on 3 November 1726 to another joiner, Thomas Miller. Later he was turned over to John Hall, a shipwright and Deptford boat builder. He first appears in the Deptford rate books (St Paul's parish) in July 1742, for a house in or near Slade's Court, and on 9 June 1743 was sworn a freeman of the Shipwrights' Company on the testimony of Hall and William Houlder, shipwright, although he must then have been long out of indentures. Cleveley's main career was spent as a shipwright in the royal dockyard at Deptford. He lived in King's Yard Row, Dogg Street, at least from 1747, died there in May 1777, and was buried on 21 May at the parish church of St Paul's, Deptford. Letters of administration granted to his widow, Sarah, on 14 June 1778 refer to him both as lately of that parish and as 'Carpenter belonging to his Majesty's Ship the 'Victory' in the pay of his Mys Navy' (General Register Office for England, AA 1777 Farrant). 'Victory' was held in ordinary (reserve) at Chatham from her launch in 1765 until first commissioned for sea in March 1778, so Cleveley may latterly have been attached to her in some capacity, although not as her regular carpenter. 
How Cleveley learned to paint is unknown, although it may have been been through association with ship painters, whose opportunities increased from 1704 when the Admiralty reduced carved ship decoration in favour of painting. The earliest date yet found on his work is 1747, and he specialized in shipping and Thames shipbuilding and launching scenes, especially at the Deptford yard. He also produced other marine views (including of shipbuilding in East Anglia), Hanoverian comings and goings in the royal yachts, sea fights, and ship portraits. The last tend to be repetitive, often with little more than a change of name. Little of the artist's work was engraved, but he contributed shipping to the prints of Sheerness, Chatham, and Plymouth dockyards (1755-6) by Thomas Milton, and possibly those of Deptford, Woolwich, and Portsmouth (1753-4) in the same set. Cleveley was a good draughtsman and colourful painter. His art combines a valuable historical record with much human detail and at its best has an unpretentious grandeur. While not the equal of Samuel Scott, he must have known the latter's work and perhaps that of Canaletto's English period (1746-55). He exhibited at the Free Society from 1764 to 1776, but confusion at the time with his son John ['see below'] makes it unclear how many of the forty-three pictures listed under his name for those years may have been by the younger man. His work is widely dispersed, but the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, has sixteen paintings, the most impressive being a fictitious placing of the 'Royal George' (launched in 1756) off Deptford at the launch of the 'Cambridge' in 1755. This too was a composition he repeated. No portrait of Cleveley is known, but he sometimes seems to have included himself in his work: a view of the 'Buckingham' on the stocks at Deptford (dated 1752 and also at Greenwich) shows a sturdy, respectably dressed figure drawing the scene depicted. 
Cleveley and his wife, Sarah (1722-1798), had seven known children: John and Hannah ('bap'. 1744 and 1747) presumably died in infancy. Another Hannah was baptized in 1750 and Rebecca in 1754. A younger son, James ('bap'. 29 June 1752), was a ship's carpenter and served as such under Captain Cook in the 'Resolution', on Cook's third Pacific voyage (1776-80).

Sir John Delaval (1498-1562) were said to produce salt which was 'esteemed by sutche as buye the same to be better than any other white salt' (Earnshaw, 4). Evidently the salt and coal trades were already considerable revenue earners for the family, and it was said of Sir John a few years after his death that he 'hath been a patron of worship and hospitality, most like a famous gentleman during many years, and powdreth no man by the salt of extortion of oppressing his neighbour, but liberally spendeth his salt, wheat and malt like a gentleman' (Hedley, 150). Knighted by 1519, he was five times high sheriff of Northumberland between 1527 and 1554, a position which many of his descendants were to occupy. He married Mary, daughter of Thomas Carey of Chilton, Wiltshire. 
The lands in Hartley in the early sixteenth century were held by the crown and by other families besides the Delavals, but much of the township was being leased to the latter and Sir Robert Delaval ('c'.1541-1607), grandson of Sir John, bought out all the freeholders between 1574 and 1577. He converted the tillage lands to pasture and effectively annexed the manor of Hartley to that of his manor of Seaton Delaval in 1578.

However, his youngest son, Thomas, wrote an affectionate portrait of his father as a man who: 'kept an open, great and plentiful house for entertainment, his own family consisting daily in his house of threescore persons and above... His life was religious. He kept a chaplain ever in his house that read public prayers daily in his house and preached each Sunday commonly in his chapel and taught and educated his children. He governed his people in excellent order, and stocked and managed his whole estate himself, directing his servants daily their several labours. He kept also the books of his cattle, corn, etc., and how they were disposed. He never rid to any public assembly without five or six men in liveries and two or three of his sons to attend him. He never affected drinking. Cards nor dice, he never could abide them... His apparel ever decent not rich. He was a man of voluble tongue, excellent discourse and of good memory. He understood the Latin and Greek tongues, and in his younger days did write of several subjects. He understood the laws of the land expertly. His times of private devotions were daily -- at morn, noon and night. He loved hunting but left it off long ere he died. He was very zealous in religion which he openly professed to the last, and, having settled his estate... taken the communion, blessed his wife and children and desiring absolution of his sins from the minister, which done, within 24 hours he made a calm and quiet period of his life.

Sir John Delaval, third baronet (bap. 1654, d. 1729), subject to a payment of $8000 for any daughters born to Ralph and Diana. Sir John had married Mary Goodyer (1659/60-1683) in 1683, but she died after a few months of marriage; he later had a daughter, Ann ('c'.1689-1723), but there is no evidence for a second marriage. He had a distinguished military career, served in many campaigns in Flanders, and rose to become colonel in the guards; he was elected MP for Morpeth, Northumberland, in 1701 and 1702. 
His brother Sir Ralph died five years after their father, leaving only a daughter, Diana (1686-1710). His personal estate went to pay his creditors, while the Seaton Delaval and Hartley estates devolved upon his widow, Diana, under the terms of their marriage settlement, and Sir John came into possession of Seaton Sluice, the coalmines, quarries, and salt pans. Diana married again in October 1699; her husband, Sir Edward Blackett (1649-1718) ['see under 'Blackett, Sir William] of Newby in Yorkshire, tightened his grip on the $8000 portion by marrying his stepdaughter Diana to his own eldest son, William, within two months of his own marriage. The younger Diana was only thirteen years old at the time, but there was a clear advantage to Sir Edward in having her both as stepdaughter and daughter-in-law. At the same time Blackett ensured that the $8000 should be paid to him rather than to his son, and in 1709 he secured an agreement from the sole surviving trustee for the settlement, that 6 per cent interest should be charged on the $8000 from 1691. 
Meanwhile Sir John Delaval was facing familiar problems with the deterioration of a pier at the harbour, and he attempted to recoup his $500 outlay on its repair by seeking to recover the remainder of Charles II's earlier offer of a grant to his father. In his unsuccessful argument Sir John noted the great benefits that had accrued from Sir Ralph's work; eight salt pans were now at work, the excise on salt alone averaging $5000 per annum, and during the year 1704 some 1400 chaldrons (nearly 3700 tons) of coal had been exported. But even greater financial problems faced Sir John as he was presented with his brother-in-law's claim arising from the marriage settlement, the sum at issue having increased through interest charges to $14,624 by the time of the former Lady Delaval's death in 1713. Sir John put forward his own claims to Seaton Delaval and Hartley on Diana's death, but faced with Blackett's claim, which was confirmed by a court order of 1715, and which amounted to a sum well beyond his means, it was inevitable that he should have to sell off a large portion of his property, namely the manor of Seaton. 
The only member of the family in a position to rescue the situation was Admiral

The third son of George Delaval ('c'.1628-1695) and Margaret Grey (died 1709), the admiral became MP for West Looe in 1715 and 1722, but it was his combined naval and diplomatic careers -- he had been employed in embassies in Morocco and Portugal -- that brought him sufficient wealth to pay off various fractious and impoverished members of the family. During 1718 he bought Sir John out of Seaton and Hartley, paid off Blackett, purchased the Bavington estate in Northumberland, and commissioned Vanbrugh to design Seaton Delaval Hall as a replacement for the old Delaval Castle; Sir John was left with a life interest in Hartley and Seaton Sluice. Admiral Delaval, who never married, gained little of the fruits of his enterprise for he was thrown from his horse and promptly died of his injuries in 1723; Seaton Delaval Hall was still six years from completion, and Vanbrugh himself died three years later and was, therefore, never to see his finest work completed. Gutted by fire in the early nineteenth century, its shell survives as a dramatically angular conflation of differing elements -- classical, medieval, and contemporary -- all tightly bound together in a startling unity. 
The admiral's will, made a few weeks before his death, devised Bavington to his sister's son George Shafto and the remainder of his estates to his brother's son,

Francis Blake Delaval (bap. 1692, d. 1752), the son of Edward Delaval of South Dissington ('bap'. 1664, died 1744) and Mary Ord, 'nee' Blake ('c'.1664-1711). Francis, a naval captain in the impress service, had inherited the Ford estate in north Northumberland from his maternal grandfather, Francis Blake, in 1718, and under the terms of that will he replaced his Delaval surname with that of Blake. On succeeding to Admiral Delaval's estates Francis also added his original surname. In 1729 he inherited Sir John Delaval's possessions, including Seaton Sluice. In 1724 Francis had married Rhoda Apreece (died 1759), heir of Sir Thomas Hussey of Doddington, Lincolnshire, her maternal grandfather, and she brought the Doddington estate to the marriage as part of her dowry; Francis could now afford to finish off the building of Seaton Delaval Hall. The income from the estates was perhaps $6000 per annum when Francis inherited, and it seems to have remained at about that level until he died. All of his properties were settled on his eldest son, Sir Francis Blake Delaval, of a family of seven sons and three daughters but the future fortunes of the Delavals were to rest upon the second son, John Hussey Delaval, Baron Delaval (1728-1808), industrialist and politician. The third son was Edward Hussey Delaval (bap. 1729, d. 1814), natural philosopher.

William York MacGregor (1855-1923) and his friend James Paterson ['see below'], who painted together from the mid-1870s. Macgregor was born in Finnart, Dunbartonshire, in September 1855, the son of John MacGregor, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Margaret, 'nee' York. He studied painting as a pupil of James Docharty in Glasgow and then at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, under Alphonse Legros. This more formal training, combined with his private means and a certain 'gravitas' in his manner, gave him the sobriquet 'Father of the School', but in artistic terms he was eclipsed by the events of 1885 and took only a minor role in later years. He was crippled by asthma, and left Glasgow for the cleaner air of Bridge of Allan in 1886 as well as visiting South Africa in 1888 in the hope of a cure. On 30 April 1918 he married Jessie Watson, a nurse, and they lived at Albyn Lodge, Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire. He died on 28 September 1923 at the Great Western Hotel, Oban, and was buried at Logie, near Bridge of Allan. His friend Paterson wrote that 'he relished a good sermon, loved savoury food, drank little or nothing, smoked fine cigars... [was] an omnivorous reader, keenly interested in classical music... always shy with women, [with] a cordial contempt for 'Swells'' (Paterson).

Donald Ruadh MacCrimmon (fl. 1731); and to them are attributed a number of piobaireachd, often on legendary rather than historical grounds, their skills having been originally acquired from the fairies -- a common motif in Gaelic mythology. However, there is historical as well as stylistic support for some of the attributions. Donald Mor is credited with the composition of 'MacLeod's Salute', a tune which shares a characteristic fingering feature with others attributed to him. A remission granted under the great seal on 13 January 1614 refers to a piper called Donald MacCruimien, and it is assumed that this is the same man. Patrick Mor is said to have composed 'The Lament for the Children', one of the most famous and extended of piobaireachd. Others attributed to him also tend to be extended, though 'Cumha Dhomhnaill an Lagain' is an exception. It was said that this lament for Donald of Laggan was played nightly in Dunvegan as Donald's daughter, wife to the MacLeod, could not sleep without hearing it. 
Patrick Og is particularly remembered for the lament for Iain Garve of Raasay and the beautiful and gentle lament for Mary MacLeod, who was unofficial bard as well as nurse to the MacLeods and who died in 1707. 
Patrick Og's son Malcolm is said to have composed a lament for his half-brother Domhnall Ban, known both as a song, 'Cha till mi tuille', and in piobaireachd form as 'MacCrimmon's lament'. It was believed to have been composed after MacCrimmon foresaw his own death following the rout of Moy (1746), and there is some evidence to support the story (see Blankenhorn, 1978). 
The MacCrimmons were far from being the only major family of hereditary pipers. The MacArthurs and MacKays too ran piping schools. However, the MacCrimmons were undoubtedly leading figures in the development of piobaireachd, though the publication of a thorough scholarly study of the family and its music is still awaited.

Sir Thomas Prendergast, second baronet (bap. 1702, d. 1760), politician, was baptized at St Peter's and St Kevin's Church, Dublin, on 20 May 1702 and became a child ensign in his father's regiment. He was admitted a fellow-commoner at Clare College, Cambridge, on 21 May 1719, and entered the Inner Temple in 1721. He lobbied Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond, who had married his cousin Lady Sarah Cadogan, for a seat in the British parliament, and was returned to the Commons in March 1733 as MP for Chichester. In his first week, he voted against the government over the 'Excise Bill' because Sir Robert Walpole would not make him Irish postmaster-general. Walpole covertly ensured his defeat in the 1734 general election. George II called him 'an Irish blockhead' (Sedgwick). Meanwhile, Prendergast was defeated in October 1733 in a by-election for the Irish Commons at Clonmel by Guy Moore, grandson of his grandfather's benefactor. The Commons reversed this on petition, and he sat for Clonmel until his death; this was one of several such setbacks to the Moore family's government-backed campaign to make it their pocket borough. Swift, however, blamed the 'parson-hunters', Prendergast's fellow anti-clericals. His Commons antics in 1736 provoked Swift in the poems 'Noisy Tom' and 'The Legion Club' to assail vituperatively both father and son: '

Walter Gore (1910-1979), dancer, choreographer, and ballet director, was born on 8 October 1910 at Waterside, Ayrshire, to John William Taylor and his wife, Margaret Anne, 'nee' Snape; both parents were actors. Gore went to London in 1924 to study drama at the Italia Conti School of Drama and Dance; he appeared in plays, and a revue by C. B. Cochran starring the dancer Leonide Massine, whose example inspired Gore to take up ballet. He studied with Marie Rambert and appeared with her company from its first season in 1930, also taking roles with the Vic-Wells Ballet, most intensively during 1934-5 when he partnered Ninette de Valois in 'Coppelia' and created the title role in 'The Rake's Progress'. A flair for characterization, through both movement and his expressively lively, sharply angled face, quickly marked him out to create roles for Ashton (in 'Facade', 'Les masques', etc.), de Valois ('Job'), and Tudor ('Dark Elegies'). In such parts he was unequalled, but he succeeded also in the virtuoso display of 'Bluebird', or even in romanticism as Albrecht in 'Giselle', thanks to his intensity and sense of style. During the mid-1930s he took time off to appear in musicals, where he also did his first choreography, besides meeting the dancer Aase Lavendt Nissen ('b'. 1915/16), whom he married on 16 September 1938. That year also saw his first ballet for Rambert, 'Valse finale' to music by Ravel, soon followed by further pieces among which the short, tense 'Confessional' (based on a poem by Browning) in 1940 was the most notable and durable. This revealed Gore's flair for dance drama and also that of its soloist, Sally Gilmour (1921-2004), who became the choreographer's off-stage partner (his wife had returned to her native Scandinavia). During the Second World War Gore was called up into the navy (1942-4) but was discharged on medical grounds after being twice torpedoed. On returning to dance he had a particular success with 'Simple Symphony', a lively interpretation of Britten's youthful music, and with the comic 'Mr Punch'. Ballet Rambert's long Australian tour in 1947-9 brought a change in his private life. This was mirrored in a new ballet, 'Winter Night', where he played a man torn between his old and new loves, Gilmour and Paula Hinton. From then on, Hinton and Gore worked as a team; they married on 9 January 1950 following the dissolution of his first marriage. They shared a serious sense of purpose, enthusiasm for hard work, and a flair for theatrical effect.

Hugh Fraser, lord of Lovat (d. in or before 1440), appears under this style in March 1416. In 1421 Hugh was deputy sheriff of Inverness, and he also took part in national politics, being one of the party which met James I at Durham on his way back to Scotland in 1424. 
Lovat supported the king against the lord of the Isles in 1429, and consequently suffered the ravaging of his lands at Abertarff on Loch Ness. For serving the crown in the north, Lovat was rewarded with promotion to sheriff of Inverness by 1431. He was a key figure in the earl of Mar's Lochaber campaign of 1431, but following Mar's death, in 1435, Alexander MacDonald, the lord of the Isles, reasserted his position, and major north-western landowners were forced to come to terms with him, as Lovat did in January 1437, granting to his new feudal superior his right to one third of Glenelg. Lovat's first wife, Janet Fenton, had died before December 1429, by when he was married to Isabel Wemyss. He was dead by 20 July 1440, when his son, Thomas Fraser, witnessed a charter as lord of Lovat, and maintained thereafter his family's prominent position in north-west Scotland; the bond of manrent which he gave to Alexander, lord of the Isles and earl of Ross, in 1442, possibly in an effort to bring stability to local politics at a time when national politics were in a state of turmoil, is the earliest to survive. He died before 20 May 1455 and was succeeded by his son.

His youth was remarked upon, and a motion made for the expulsion of minors, but no action was taken possibly because the earl of Plymouth's son, Thomas Windsor, looked even younger.

Fanny Margaretta Holcroft (bap. 1785, d. 1844) followed her father in making a career in writing. She was the daughter of Holcroft's third wife, Dinah, and was baptized on 11 June 1785 at St Andrew's, Holborn, London. Fanny Holcroft seems to have been very devoted to her father, and to have received a broad and liberal education in modern languages and the arts; she shared her father's liberal political opinions and assisted him in his literary work. In 1802, on the recommendation of William Godwin, she was engaged by Lady Mountcashell as governess for her daughters -- a post previously held by Mary Wollstonecraft -- but she was quickly dismissed when 'The Times' reported that Thomas Holcroft was a French spy. Fanny Holcroft provided the incidental music for her father's successful melodrama 'The Lady of the Rock' (1805). She also provided translations of politically liberal plays by Alfieri, Weisse, Lessing, Calderon, and Moratin for her father's periodical the 'Theatrical Recorder' (1805-6). She published 'Memoirs of the Life of the Great Conde' (1807), a translation of a biography of the French prince and military leader during the seventeenth-century French civil wars. After her father's death Fanny Holcroft published two novels, 'The Wife and the Lover: a Novel' (3 vols., 1813) and 'Fortitude and Frailty: a Novel' (4 vols., 1817), dedicated to her father's memory. These adapt his reformist politics to the post-Napoleonic era of emergent liberalism with stories of vicissitudes in private life, recommending personal virtue and social conciliation.

Philip [i] Roettier (1640-1718), also born in Antwerp, in May 1662 John was made joint chief engraver at the Royal Mint, at a salary of $325 per annum. This was 'over and above their piece-work rates on the coinage and a further $450 [subsequently] granted to them in 1669 out of the coinage money paid into the Exchequer' (Challis, 'New History', 363). This last was a life grant which it was intended should reduce to $350 per annum for two survivors and to $250 per annum for one survivor. 
To some, then as now, this was a most puzzling appointment, for it was made at the expense of Thomas Simon, one of the greatest engravers the mint has ever had. Previously it was surmised that this preferment came because Charles II liked the portrait of himself produced by Simon less than that done by the Roettiers, or that because of his service under the protectorate Simon lacked royal favour, or that Simon failed to produce dies quickly enough for the first hammered issue of coins. But the real explanation was given by the master of the mint, Henry Slingsby: 'When Monsieur Roettier and his two brothers were sent over in the year 1661, and Mr. Johnson [the Roettiers' smith] likewise, they came in opposition to me, Blondeau and Simon, but finding the Roettiers's way of engraving only fit to carry on the new way of coining I turned their friend. (Challis, 'Presidential address', 171)' Their 'skill complemented that of Blondeau and thus ensured that the Mint could make the best possible use of the newly installed mechanised process', the screw press (Challis, 'New History', 350). 
The three brothers worked together until 1679, John being concerned principally with producing the puncheons and Joseph and Philip [i] with sinking the dies. They were also engaged in engraving dies for the copper coinage of 1672-6, at a halfpenny per pound weight, and in 1675 in producing working tools for the Edinburgh mint. About February 1679 Joseph Roettier left for France, where he became naturalized and rose to be engraver-general of coins. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Nilis (died 1680), with whom he had a daughter and four sons -- one of whom, George, became an engraver at the Paris mint -- and second, on 12 June 1690, to Helen Stonehouse, with whom he had three sons and three daughters. He died in Paris on 11 September 1703. 
After 1679 John and Philip [i] Roettier continued their partnership on the same salary until 1685, when, again about February, Philip ceased to be remunerated and subsequently migrated to the Low Countries. There he became engraver-general of coins, and in 1686 he was appointed engraver at the mint in his home town, Antwerp. On 10 February 1674 he married Jeanne Marie de Mangelaer, with whom he had two sons. Philip [ii] Roettier succeeded his father, following the latter's death in Antwerp in 1718, as engraver-general of the Low Countries, which post he held from 1719 to 1732. His brother, Francis Roettier (1685-1743), was an engraver and professor at the Academie de Peinture et de Sculpture in Paris. 
John Roettier continued in office in London, ostensibly alone but in reality, since he had become infirm in his engraving hand, assisted by his second and third sons,

Maedoc (fl. 7th cent.), whose feast day is 31 January, was the founder of the church of Ferns (co. Wexford) and patron of Drumlane (co. Cavan) and Rossinver (co. Leitrim). His name, Mo-Aed-oc, means 'my little Aed'; he is also known as Aidan. According to tradition, he was born on the island crannog of Inis Brechmaige in Templeport Lake (co. Cavan). His father, Setna, was of the Ui Moccu Uais (a branch of the Airgialla). His mother, Eithne, was of the Ui Amalgaid (Tirawley, co. Mayo). After an education in Wales with St David he returned to Leinster where he established his principal foundation of Ferns. His death is recorded in the annals of Ulster as an addition to the year 625 by their fifteenth-century compiler Cathal Mac Maghnusa. 'Chronicum Scotorum' and the annals of Tigernach have it noted at 625 and again at 656 and 659. The later date may refer to a similarly named saint, Aed (feast day 11 April), whose church was Cluain Mor Maedoc (Clonmore, co. Carlow). The latter was a member of the Ui Dunlainge dynasty of north Leinster, from the valley of the River Tolka. It can be shown that there was a deliberate conflation of the two lives of these saints for political purposes in the eleventh century. From the late tenth century, the main segment of the Ui Chennselaig dynasty based at Ferns was opposed by a rival branch based at Clonmore. In 1040 Diarmait mac Mael na mBo, the Ui Chennselaig king who was soon to become ruler of the whole province, plundered Clonmore as part of a ruthless elimination of his rivals. It is likely that the life of Maedoc was rewritten at the time of Conchobar Ua Laidhgneain, abbot of Ferns and St Mullins (or Tech Moling: Timolin, co. Kildare), who died in 1062, in order to suppress the cult of Aed. By introducing Brandub, a king of Leinster who supposedly died in 605, it also served to enhance the prestige of Brandub's descendant, Diarmait mac Mael na mBo. The same circumstances probably gave rise to the association of Maedoc with Mo Ling, founder of St Mullins.

Mael Ruain (d. 792), founder and patron saint of Tallaght, co. Dublin, who was the central figure in what historians have described as the monastic reform movement known as the Celi De, 'Clients of God'. His feast day, 7 July, is given in the martyrology of Tallaght, completed 'c'.830 and reflecting the interest of his circle in earlier saints, both Irish and non-Irish. The versified counterpart, known as the martyrology of Oengus the Culdee ('Felire Oengusso Celi De'), is of the same period. Possible supporting evidence that Mael Ruain was indeed the founder of Tallaght (called Mael Ruain's Tallaght, Tamlachtae Maele Ruain, after him) is given by a note in the martyrology of Tallaght for 10 August, 'Mael Ruain came to Tallaght with his relics of the holy martyrs and virgins' (ed. Best and Lawlor, 62). The word 'tamlachtae' means a burial-ground but in the eighth century this was not necessarily yet attached to a church. Tallaght is not attested before Mael Ruain; the note may thus refer to a foundation rather than merely to the arrival of relics.

Anne Shadwell (fl. 1661-1705)], daughter of Thomas Gibbs, proctor and public notary at Norwich. She may have been the Anne Gibbs who, aged seventeen, married Thomas Gawdy of Norfolk in 1662. There was a rumour that Shadwell 'hath owned himself... married by a Popish priest' ('Loyal Protestant', 9 Feb 1681), which he denied, saying only that he had had an active interest in Catholicism for about eight months in 1660-61. Anne acted in several of Shadwell's plays. She performed with the Red Bull Troupe in Oxford in July 1661, and that year was among the eight actresses in Sir William Davenant's Duke's Company in Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. She had some musical skill, singing and playing the lute. She may have been still acting as a member of the United Company in 1686-7 and even in 1699, as a member of Christopher Rich's company at Drury Lane. In his will Shadwell called her a 'diligent careful and provident woman and very indulgent to her children' ('Works', 1.ccxxxvi). She dedicated Shadwell's play 'The Volunteers' to the queen in 1693 and was still alive in 1705.

Joan Waterhouse (b. 1547/8), Agnes Waterhouse's daughter. She began her pre-trial examination by denying any knowledge of witchcraft, although she said that her mother had attempted to teach her 'this art'. However, shortly afterwards she began to confess that she had tried out the familiar spirit, Satan, in her mother's absence, and used him to punish a neighbour's child, Agnes Browne, for uncharitable acts towards her. Browne is shown in 'The Examination and Confession' as giving sensational evidence against both Joan and Agnes Waterhouse, and it seems likely that her stories played a large part in bringing both women to trial, along with Frauncis. She said that she had been 'haunted' by a black dog with an ape's face which had asked for butter, played in the milkhouse, and finally attempted to kill her with a knife which he said belonged to Agnes Waterhouse. Browne was counselled by a clergyman during her alleged experiences, rather as if she were a possession victim, and she had the backing of the pamphlet which treated her as a star witness. However, Joan Waterhouse was acquitted and Browne's credibility in court must therefore be in doubt. Other felonies and witchcraft cases at the 1566 summer assizes went unreported. 
Witchcraft was usually thought to have occurred where disputes arose between victim and suspect, followed by misfortune. The second Essex pamphlet illustrates this well. It contains accusations against four women, Elizabeth Frauncis and three others. The first was

Her father came from a family of ornamental plasterers, and her mother from a family of craftsmen in wood.

After graduating she worked as a typographer at the publishers Chatto and Windus, then as supervisor of publications at the National Gallery, where she worked under Kenneth Clark, and helped with the removal of its treasures to Blaenau Ffestiniog. During the Second World War several of her watercolours were acquired for the Recording Britain project, and in 1945 she left the National Gallery to make her living as a writer and artist. She produced guides to Suffolk (1948, with illustrations by Rowland Suddaby) and Cambridgeshire (1953) before marrying Edwin Smith.

After her husband's death she managed his collection of negatives and prints, and edited the selection published in 1984. She also produced her own works, including children's stories, an opera libretto ('The split goose feather', for Christopher Brown), and 'Movement in Two Dimensions' (1963), a study of the precursors of cinema. She was active in civic as well as social life in Saffron Walden. She was a founder member of the Fry Art Gallery Society, which in 1987 established the Fry Art Gallery there.

William Mostyn (1521-1576), who had already begun to play a part in local affairs. He had some experience of military service under William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke, in suppressing the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger early in 1554 and he was the first member of the family to sit in parliament, representing Flintshire in 1553, 1554, and 1572. Mostyn married Margaret, daughter of Robert ap Hywel of Whittington, Shropshire, by 1542. The couple had three sons and two daughters. Service under Pembroke suggests that the Mostyns moved with the religious changes of the times; unlike their Talacre kinsmen, they certainly conformed after the accession of Elizabeth I and there seem to have been no recusants among them. From 1569 William Mostyn was a JP for Flintshire, being named of the quorum four years later, and sheriff of Flintshire three times and Caernarvonshire once. He began extending the house at Mostyn but died before the work was complete; his heir left it unfinished. His second marriage, to Margaret Goodman ('b'. in or after 1539, died 1594), daughter of Sir William Brereton of Cheshire and his wife, Jane, and widow of a wealthy Cheshire merchant, was part of a double transaction, common among the gentry of north Wales, his new wife's daughter marrying his heir. Mostyn died on 19 September 1576. If his father's will reflected the old faith, his was uncompromisingly protestant. At his death the Mostyn rent roll was just under $300, putting the estate among the most substantial in north Wales at that time.

He was the first member of the family to be knighted, the accolade being bestowed when Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, was entertained at Mostyn on his way to Ireland in April 1599. In the subsidy of 1592 he was assessed at $10; only one Flintshire squire was assessed at a higher figure. According to the family history, it was Sir Thomas Mostyn who began to assemble the famous Mostyn library. Like his father, he married twice. After the death of his first wife, Ursula (died 1578), daughter of William Goodman, with whom he had three sons and two daughters, he married his kinswoman Katherine, daughter of Piers Mostyn of Talacre and his wife, Ellen, and widow of Sir Rhys Griffith of Penrhyn. Katherine Mostyn was the mother of the privateer and spendthrift Piers Griffith (1568-1628), who, at the same time, married Sir Thomas Mostyn's daughter Margaret. Neither marriage was a success; the activities of Griffith may well have contributed to the failure of them both. Although Sir Thomas Mostyn's allegiance to the Elizabethan settlement seems never to have been in doubt, he was described by a contemporary as 'a man not very rigid against Catholics but one that complied with the times', which made it all the more embarrassing when, about 1582, he came face to face with a seminary priest near his house at Gloddaith and was obliged to arrest him. He died at Mostyn on 21 February 1618 and was buried at Whitford. 
Sir Thomas Mostyn was succeeded by his elder surviving son from his first marriage,

(John) Edward Massey (1831-1891). Thomas Walker was reputed to be a nephew of Edward Massey. 
Entries in London trade directories record that John Edward Massey, trading as 'Edward Massey, successors of the original inventor and sole manufacturer by special appointment of patent logs and sounding machines to Her Majesty's Royal Navy', received the only gold medal awarded at the International Fisheries Exhibition, London (1883), and another medal at the International Inventions Exhibition, London (1885). In 1876, following a patent taken out in 1875, he also advertised as: 'Stamp makers, die sinkers and engravers; sole inventors and patentees of the new post office lock stamps used for dating, defacing and impressing or any purpose requiring the secure use of movable type'. 
The younger Edward Massey was by no means the first person to have the idea of measuring the distance travelled through water by mechanically recording the revolutions of a dragged or falling vaned rotor, designed to turn at a constant rate. However, his designs were the first to produce instruments which worked well in practice and which ordinary mariners could afford to buy. 
An interesting reference to the development of his log at Newcastle is found in the papers of the Liverpool antiquary, jeweller, and goldsmith Joseph Mayer (1803-1886), who was also born and raised in Newcastle under Lyme: 'On dismissal from school almost every Saturday afternoon several of my school fellows went to the canal where opposite the Cotton Factory... Massey tried his log machine and we thought it a privilege to be allowed to trail the machines by running them along the canal.' During this period, Edward Massey junior also developed various horological devices, and in 1808 he patented a design for an improved cock or tap. In 1803 the Society of Arts awarded him 20 guineas for the design of a clock striking train which did not use a fly, for accurate indication of time during astronomical observations, and another 50 guineas for two clock escapements. After the death of his father in 1813 he moved to Ironmonger Row, Cross Cheaping, Coventry, where he continued to manufacture logs and sounders, and to exploit the horological inventions which he patented in 1812 and 1814, especially his new design for a detached lever escapement for watches. The inventions also include a robust keyless winding mechanism and an adjustable temperature compensation curb for watches, a remontoir chronometer escapement, and a gravity escapement for a pendulum regulator clock. Entries in trade directories and an advertisement in 'The Times' for 21 April 1815 suggest that the Masseys soon concentrated on manufacturing, supplying, and fitting parts for their patented devices, rather than on manufacturing complete watches or chronometers. Coventry was an obvious place to set up such a business as it already had a reputation for exploiting apprentice labour in workshops to finish the rough movements produced in the Prescot area of Lancashire, rather than using the skilled watch finishers working in areas like Liverpool and Clerkenwell. Many watches with Massey's escapement from this early period were signed by Edward Massey, or marked 'Massey's Patent', but many more were signed by other manufacturers or retailers, and marked 'Patent Detached Lever', with escapements fitted or supplied by the Masseys. 
Massey's version of the detached lever escapement was by far his most important contribution to horology, and exists in a number of variant forms. These, unlike the earlier versions produced by such eminent London watchmakers as Thomas Mudge and Josiah Emery, could be inexpensively produced in large numbers, and it appears that Massey was the first maker to use 'draw' as a matter of course in his lever escapements, from around 1820. This is an escapement design feature which limits intermittent friction when a watch is carried on the person, and is essential for the satisfactory performance of lever watches. It may have been the subject of a patent applied for in 1820 for which no specification was ever filed. 
From 1812 until the late 1840s Massey's was the dominant form of detached lever escapement used in English watches, produced in great numbers, especially by the Liverpool watchmakers. It can be seen as the precursor of both the English single table roller lever escapement and the Swiss double roller escapement, which were produced in ever greater numbers from the second half of the nineteenth century. Through the many watches exported to the USA, Massey also influenced the development of the great American watch factories. The first American machine-made watches (manufactured by H. and J. Pitkin of Hartford, Connecticut, from 1838) had a version of his escapement. The Massey design and the layout of the early Massey escapement watches can themselves be seen as a development of the rack lever watches produced in the Liverpool area following Peter Litherland's patents of 1791 and 1792. 
By 1819 the Masseys had opened a manufactory at the Scholes, a sixteenth-century recusant house near Prescot (apparently because the skilled workmen required to develop Edward's chronometer escapements were not available in Coventry), and by 1825 another manufactory at Clerkenwell, to exploit the London market. By the early 1830s Edward and all his children were working at various addresses in the cities of London and Westminster, manufacturing patented nautical instruments, horological devices, and other items such as early fountain pens (according to designs patented in 1833 and 1834). Special items supplied by the Masseys include fast beating stopwatches (originally designed to ascertain accurately distance by sound in gunnery), and seconds beating 'journeyman' watches (to carry the time from a fixed regulator or chronometer about an observatory or ship). Further patents for various horological devices were taken out by Edward junior in 1838 and 1841, and by his son Francis Joseph (1801-1845) in 1841. 
After trials at the Greenwich Royal Observatory in 1842, Massey's chronometer no. 1 was purchased for the Royal Navy for 50 guineas, 'their Lordships having been pleased in order to mark the superior performance of it to assign to it a proportionately increased price to that usually given'. However, the only member of the Massey family who seems to have produced a significant number of chronometers was Edward John (1810-1872), probably a nephew of Edward junior, who worked in Liverpool from the early 1830s. Edward Massey junior died at his home, 17 Chadwell Street, Clerkenwell, London, on 10 May 1852 of 'age and debility', and was buried at St John's Church, Duncan Terrace, Islington. 
The Massey family enjoyed for many years a virtual monopoly of supply of logs and sounders for Royal Navy and merchant ships. Taken as a whole, their products did much to advance the arts of navigation and hydrography and thereby to improve maritime safety.

Matthew Hood (fl. 1800-1804) were contemporaries of John the younger and may also have been his brothers, and therefore John the elder's sons. All produced estate maps, of which several are extant in collections in Ireland and Britain. Henry was in the 1790s employed by the first marquess of Abercorn, whose agent considered that he spent too much time studying and was too diffident and abstemious. Henry and John the younger developed a complex system of land classification for recording the type and quality of land they surveyed. The family was noted for the high quality of its work but did not achieve prosperity thereby: Matthew noted that even so successful a surveyor as his brother Henry had only one instrument. Matthew was a farm manager at Baronscourt on the Abercorn estate from October 1796 to May 1806 and his 200 letters to Lord Abercorn, account book, and map of Baronscourt (all at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland) give a detailed picture of his management of the land.

Francis Grose (1756-1814), born on 8 May 1756, the eldest son of the antiquary Francis Grose (bap. 1731, d. 1791) and his wife, Catherine, 'nee' Jordan (1733?-1774). Grose's military career had begun in 1775 when he was commissioned ensign in the 52nd regiment. He was promoted lieutenant that year. He served as a captain in the 85th and 51st regiments in the American War of Independence. A fellow officer in the 51st was Henry Phipps, afterwards third baron and first earl of Mulgrave, who became an important patron. Grose returned to Britain in 1779, after having received wounds in America, and spent two years as a recruiting officer. In 1783 he was placed on half pay as a major in the 96th regiment, where he remained until he was appointed lieutenant-governor of New South Wales and commandant of the New South Wales Corps in 1789. His first duty was the raising of soldiers, and he did not arrive at Port Jackson until February 1792. 
Grose appointed the first three captains of the corps in June 1789:

Nicholas Nepean (bap. 1757, d. 1823), William Paterson (1755-1810), and William Hill. Nepean was baptized at Saltash, Cornwall, on 9 November 1757, one of the five children of Nicholas Nepean ('c'.1700-1772), an innkeeper, and his second wife, Margaret Jones. He was the younger brother of the highly influential Sir Evan Nepean, first baronet, under-secretary of state in the Home department and a client of Sir Joseph Banks. Nicholas Nepean had joined the marines as a second lieutenant in December 1776, and after active service in the American War of Independence, like Grose, became a recruiting officer in the later phase of the war. On 21 April 1784, at Stoke Damerel in Devon, Nepean married Johanna Francina Carolina (1767?-1845), the daughter of Major Wedikind of the 11th Hanoverian regiment; they had four daughters. His wife and children did not accompany him to Australia. He arrived in Sydney in June 1790 and was acting commanding officer of the corps until Grose's arrival. 
The army lists show that more than seventy officers were commissioned into the New South Wales Corps between its formation in 1789 and its return to Britain in 1811. Of these, sixty-two men served in the critical years between their arrival in 1790 and the military insurrection against Governor William Bligh in 1808. They were not young; indeed, their average age on arrival in New South Wales was 29.4 years. The older officers included Thomas Brabyn (aged thirty-seven), the surgeon John Harris (thirty-six), and the irascible, ill-tempered Nicholas Bayly (thirty-five). The youngest officers were John Piper (aged nineteen), John Macarthur (twenty-three), and the Montreal-born Edward Abbott (twenty-six). These were primarily career officers who had developed networks of interest and commercial and social contact. Most officers had patrons. Bayly was the son of another Nicholas Bayly, MP for Andover, Hampshire, and was a nephew of Henry Paget (formerly Bayly), first earl of Uxbridge. George Johnston was under the protection of Hugh Percy, second duke of Northumberland, and Joseph Foveaux ['see below'] was the client of General Richard Fitzpatrick, second son of the earl of Upper Ossory. Patronage was a juggling act. A patron could never be taken for granted, and officers oiled the relationship with gifts of Australian birds, marsupials (especially wombats), and botanical specimens. Nothing in New South Wales which crawled, flew, swam, or burrowed was safe from being killed, preserved, and shipped to Great Britain. 
The majority of officers were born in England, but there were three prominent Irishmen -- Lieutenant William Cummings, surgeon John Harris, and William Minchin, the adjutant at the time of the military mutiny in 1808. Paterson and Hugh and John Piper were Scots, Abbott was from Canada, and Francis Barralier was French. Among the English-born officers there was no geographical concentration. 
The officers of the corps lived from the start in an uneasy relationship of conflict and co-operation. Macarthur attempted to have Nepean court-martialled on their arrival in New South Wales as the result of an argument during their journey, and John Harris attacked Nepean for using the men under his command for his own profit while stationed at Parramatta from May 1791. Aside from specific charges relating to conduct, officers were concerned with points of honour and duels were frequent. Macarthur nearly killed Paterson in 1801, and Nepean, Foveaux, and Hill were all involved in conflict. 
The departure of Governor Arthur Phillip in December 1792 left Francis Grose in charge of New South Wales, and Grose's initiatives during this time provided incentives for the officers to involve themselves with the development of the colony. Grose made land grants of 25 acres available to serving members of the corps who requested them; he believed that encouraging the officers to farm would lead to New South Wales becoming self-sufficient. This had not been achieved by the time Grose left Australia in December 1794, but many officers had farming or surveying experience which played a prominent role in identifying fertile land. Several were committed farmers, and one officer, Archibald Bell, had wanted to bring his Alderney cow to New South Wales, alongside his pregnant wife and nine living children. The transport commissioners had found the whole project 'totally impractical'. John Macarthur became a leading landowner and was the most prominent of the officers who laid the foundations of large-scale wool-farming in New South Wales; George Johnston, with the support from Britain of the duke of Northumberland, established Australian horse-breeding. Several officers had scientific interests which underpinned their economic enterprises. Grose's botanical concerns were recognized by his fellowship of the Linnean Society. Paterson had explored in southern Africa in 1777-9 and became a fellow of the Royal Society. Macarthur showed a keen interest in the Aboriginal people and, like William Cox and Thomas Hobby in the Hawkesbury Valley (which began to be opened up during Grose's administration of the colony), was on good terms with them. This interest in the Aborigines did not prevent the corps from efficiently destroying resistance to British settlement in the Hawkesbury Valley, although Cox and Hobby seem to have been less bloodthirsty than their soldiers, who also held land in the area. 
Francis Grose never returned to New South Wales; he was eventually promoted major-general in January 1805, when posted to Gibraltar. Twice, in 1808 and 1809, he applied to become governor of New South Wales, but was rejected. His first wife died on 12 January 1813, and he married Elizabeth Paterson, 'nee' Driver (1760x75-1825), William Paterson's widow, in April 1814. By this time he was a lieutenant-general. Grose died at his home in Croydon, Surrey, on 8 May 1814. 
Nicholas Nepean had been dispatched to Britain in September 1793, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1814. He died at Newton Abbot, Devon, on 18 December 1823. William Paterson thus became commanding officer of the New South Wales Corps on Grose's departure. When Paterson returned to Britain on sick leave in August 1796,

William Penderel (c.1609-1700), was born at Hobbal Grange and was living with his wife, Joan (died 1669), a sister of William Cope, husbandman of Tong, at Chillington in the neighbouring parish of Brewood, in 1641 when they were both indicted for recusancy. He was then described as a yeoman. By 1651 he was the caretaker of Boscobel House and on 29 August 1651 offered sanctuary to the royalist earl of Derby after his disastrous defeat at Wigan in Lancashire. Six days later he met the fugitive king in the inner parlour of White Ladies Priory and 'promised to do his utmost' (Broadley, 118) to assist him, a pledge he amply fulfilled on 6 and 7 September.

John Penderel (d. c.1683), 'tooke the most pains of all the brothers' (Matthews, 113). During the civil war he fought for Charles I as a common soldier and probably served under Colonel William Careless in the royalist garrison at Tong Castle in his native parish. When Charles II took refuge at White Ladies on 4 September he was then living in the house, 'a kinde of woodward there' (ibid.). He was initially delegated the task of conveying the king's companion, Henry, Lord Wilmot, towards London; and after many narrow escapes finally left him with Thomas Whitgreave of Moseley Hall. He then trudged on foot back and forth between Moseley and White Ladies bearing messages from Wilmot to the king, who used him on 6 September to inform Squire Whitgreave of his intention to seek protection at Moseley. Along with his other four brothers, all armed, he escorted Charles at dead of night from Boscobel to his new sanctuary, and remained with him for the next few days serving as a royal messenger. At the Restoration he received an annuity of $100 and a number of other payments from the crown in recognition of his services. By the late 1660s he had migrated to Albrighton in Shropshire following his marriage to Jane Southall of Beamish Hall in that parish. At this time his social rank is given as that of a husbandman, suggesting that he did not prosper as well as the other Penderel brothers from the king's largess, and significantly he left debts in excess of $100 at his death about 1683.

Humphrey Penderel (d. 1687/8), the fourth brother, was a miller at the time of the king's flight, running the mill next to White Ladies Priory. During Charles's concealment in Spring coppice on 4 September he acted as a scout and that evening at Hobbal Grange offered to reconnoitre in advance the king's route to Madeley, but his services were declined. On 6 September, while the king was hiding in the royal oak, he was sent to Shifnal to gather intelligence about the enemy troop movements, and there he was closely interrogated by a Cromwellian colonel who threatened him with dire punishment if he withheld information and promised a $1000 reward should he give it. But Humphrey 'pleaded ignorance and was dismissed' (Blount, 29). Unfortunately, on his return to Boscobel he rather tactlessly informed Charles of these proceedings, causing him some anxiety, and it took all of Humphrey's 'urgent asservations' (ibid.) to set the king's mind at rest. It was during the famous night march from Boscobel to Moseley, however, that Humphrey Penderel made his most notable contribution to the royal escape. He provided his old mill horse for Charles to ride on, prompting the king to quip 'It was the heaviest dull jade' he had ever encountered, to which Humphrey supposedly replied 'Can you blame the horse... when he hath the weight of three kingdomes upon his back?' (Broadley, 67). This witty riposte is often regarded as apocryphal, but Penderel himself confirmed that he made it in a petition to Charles II in January 1673.

George Penderel (d. in or before 1684) was the youngest of the five brothers. He too fought for Charles I in the first civil war and in 1651 was serving as a domestic in the White Ladies' household. He was the first man to welcome Charles at White Ladies on 4 September and spent most of that day in reconnaissance around Tong and Spring coppice to ensure that the king's pursuers remained at bay. He also shared a meal with the king and accompanied him to Hobbal Grange. His final assistance to the royal refugee was to guard him during the evening ride to Moseley. After the Restoration George settled at Hednesford in Staffordshire and thanks to royal favour rose in status, being described as a yeoman in May 1668 and a gentleman in February 1671. Such was his improved standing that he was appointed one of the three overseers of the poor in the parish of Cannock in 1670. During the Popish Plot hysteria he was regularly indicted for recusancy and had to be protected by the king, who exempted him from prosecution in January 1679. He married and had several children, and had died by June 1684. To the very end the king retained 'a gracious sense' ('CSP dom.', '1684-5', 77) of his indebtedness to George and the rest of 'the five loyall and faithfull brothers' (Broadley, 101).

Jennet Preston (d. 1612) of Gisburn in Craven, Yorkshire, had already been convicted at the York assizes of 27 July for the murder by witchcraft of Thomas Lister the elder and hanged two days later; she had allegedly been present at the Malkin Tower feast soliciting help in killing Lister's son Thomas. She continued to protest her innocence on the gallows, and her husband of twenty-five years, William ('bap'. 1564?), and her kin claimed that she was the victim of a malicious prosecution. She had been acquitted at the previous York assizes of killing a baby by witchcraft. Five of the accused at Lancaster -- Elizabeth Astley, John Ramsden, Alice Gray of Colne, Isabel Sidegraves, and Lawrence Hay -- were found not guilty, although the judges clearly regarded at least some of them as guilty of witchcraft. The precise charges against them are not known, although Alice Gray had certainly been reported as present at the Good Friday feast. At the same assizes three other women were tried for witchcraft: Jennet Bierley, Ellen Bierley, and Jane Southworth, the so-called witches of Samlesbury. Their case was presented in the published account of the trials, 'The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster' (1613), as a counterpoint to the Pendle witches. The Samlesbury women seem to have been the victims of false accusations instigated by Jesuit malice.
