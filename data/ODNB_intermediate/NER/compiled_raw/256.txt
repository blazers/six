Claxton, William (1530-1597), antiquary, was the first son and heir of Ralph Claxton (died 1549) of Wynyard, co. Durham, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Hebborne of Hardwick, near Sedgefield, in the same county. He succeeded his father at Wynyard on coming of age in 1551. He had married Margery, daughter of Robert Lambert of Owton, co. Durham, by 1549, and they had two sons (who predeceased him) and three daughters (one of whom predeceased him). In 1575 he verified the pedigree of his own and other branches of the Claxton family for the visitation by William Flower, Norroy king of arms, and Robert Glover, Somerset herald. 
Claxton's father-in-law and more than one other relative had suffered loss of their lands for taking part in the northern uprising of 1569; a cousin, his namesake of Waterhouses, co. Durham, was later a convicted recusant; and his second daughter, Alice, married another, Sir William Blakiston. Claxton's own sentiments are no doubt indicated by the traditional heading 'Jesus' on his letters to John Stow, the London antiquary, in 1582, 1585, and 1594. In the first of these, in which he refers to an earlier meeting with Stow in London, he mentions 'that simple pece of worke which you have of myne... upon the causes of Busshopbryck of Durham' (BL, MS Harley 374, fol. 10), but it is not known to survive. (He could however have supplied material for the portion of Camden's 'Britannia', first published in 1586, on co. Durham.) In that and the subsequent letters, besides giving various historical information, he discusses the loan of medieval manuscript books to and from Stow, some of the former borrowed from other owners, one identifiably from Durham Cathedral Library (MS C. IV. 15). 
Claxton's verifiable signature occurs in one of two leading fourteenth-century collections of Durham monastic chronicles, which are each continued by several hands of the later sixteenth century. At least one of those hands was probably Claxton's own, and the others may have been those of members of his family and friends; they recur in other Durham historical manuscripts. Those continuations include medieval narrative which has been misattributed to William Chambre, but go as late as 1575. Evidence from some of the contents and the handwriting of the earliest dated copy, 1593, of 'The rites of Durham', suggest that Claxton may also have been the compiler of that evocative description of Durham Cathedral both before and after the suppression of the monastery, though much of it, as of the chronicle sequels, must have come from older sources, some perhaps orally, from one or more of the last monks and first canons, or lay officers, of the priory and chapter. 
Claxton made his will on 19 November 1596, asking to be buried in Brancepeth church, co. Durham, under or near his ancestral tombstone. He must have died, probably at Wynyard, soon after a second codicil dated 5 May 1597, possibly before 14 May; his wife had died by 1596.

Damet, Thomas (c.1542-1618), historian, was born in Great Yarmouth; his parents' names are unknown. He is recorded initially as a notary and scrivener, later as a merchant. In 1566-7 he was fined for not being a free burgess, suggesting that he was now aged twenty-four. Town clerk of Yarmouth in 1568-73, he soon became a leading and trusted burgess, being chosen as alderman in 1574, one of the two ruling bailiffs of the town in 1577, 1592, and 1602, JP from 1578 onwards, and MP in 1584, 1586, 1593, and 1604. Local patriotism and the search for precedents during the town's protracted suits with Lowestoft over control of the herring fishery and in connection with applications for government help towards costly harbour works inform his historical writing. This includes a manuscript history of Yarmouth harbour from 1549 to 1567, a transcript of the borough's charters dated 1580, and a brief Yarmouth chronicle. His main work is 'Greate Yermouthe: a booke of the foundacion and antiquitye of the saide towne', completed between 1594 and 1599 and previously attributed to Henry Manship senior (died 1569). It was first published in 1847. There is no indication that Damet was aware of contemporary historians such as Camden but he draws heavily on the town's archives and projects his vision of the dramatic landscape changes that permitted its rapid post-conquest development on an offshore sandspit. His work was derided by the more sophisticated Henry Manship junior (died 1625), whose own history of Great Yarmouth was completed in 1619, but was quarried by Thomas Nashe for his 'Lenten Stuffe' of 1599. Two manuscript maps compiled under Damet's influence reconstruct the Yarmouth-Norwich region as it was in the year AD 1000. 
Damet's three wives were: Anne Ellys of Hemsby, Norfolk (married 1565, died 1590); Alice Bishop, widow, 'nee' Ylberde, of Yarmouth (married 1590, died 1601); and Grace Humfrey, widow, whom he married in 1602. He fell ill in 1610 and retired to Grace's house at Rishangles in Suffolk; he died in 1618 and was buried at Great Yarmouth on 18 March. By his will dated 4 April 1617 he left four almshouses for Yarmouth seamen's widows. His daughter Mary married Ralph Owner, town clerk of Yarmouth in 1609-33, but his son Edward had disappeared and was believed dead in 1617. He subsequently reappeared to put in a claim as heir, but was in want in 1625 when the town granted him a small pension. He died in 1628.

Strangman, James (c.1555-1595/6?), antiquary, was the second son of William Strangman (died 1573) of Hadleigh, Essex, and his wife, Mary ('fl'. 'c'.1550-1580), daughter of Sir Thomas Barnardiston, of Kedington, Suffolk. The Strangmans held other lands in Essex and were settled at Hadleigh by the fourteenth century. James matriculated as a pensioner of Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1572, but is not known to have graduated. That he attended university when his elder brother, Bartholomew, like other members of the family, was entered at Lincoln's Inn in London suggests that he may have been intended for the church. If so he struck an independent line, and seems to have established himself in the capital, devoting himself to historical studies. 
Strangman's life is obscure and was apparently short: he was alive in 1592, and is said to have died in 1595 or 1596. He seems not to have held public office, but he had access to the public records and to other archives and read them closely. In a letter which he drafted to George Boleyn, dean of Lichfield, seeking permission to work in the cathedral library, he described himself as a lover of antiquities and as hoping particularly to find chronicles and histories. His chief interest was probably in the history of Essex, but contemporary references to his work show that he took note of other material and was generous with his findings. He was a member of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries in 1591. He communicated notes on manors in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire to Robert Glover, Somerset herald, and he told the Pembrokeshire antiquary George Owen of a reference to Kemes in the red book of the exchequer. He probably owned Old Hall manuscript (BL, Add. MS 57950), a major compendium of medieval music, at some time in his career. 
Strangman was apparently the first antiquary to study Essex. Nathanael Salmon (1675-1742) and Philip Morant (1700-1770) both acknowledged indebtedness to him, the former acclaiming him as 'a great Collector of Antiquities for this County' (Salmon, 360). Strangman clearly understood the importance of public records as a source of local history. It seems likely that the bulk of his manuscripts, of which only a few examples remain, were later incorporated with those of Thomas Jekyll (1570-1653); these then passed through the hands of William Holman to Salmon and Morant. Those successors all respected him as a pioneer.

Swalwell, Thomas (d. 1539), Benedictine monk and archivist, became a monk of Durham Cathedral priory about 1483. In 1486 he is recorded as a scholar at Durham College, Oxford, where he qualified as a doctor in theology in 1503. His notes for lectures on Peter Lombard's 'Sentences' survive in the margins of one of the many early printed books that he owned and annotated in his distinctive handwriting. Some of these annotations were directed towards preaching and teaching, and they reveal Swalwell's very wide range of reading, from the Fathers through to contemporaries, and a conservative interest in such matters of current debate as the eucharist and papal authority, together with a great concern for decorum in the conduct of the liturgy. He provided many manuscripts in the community's collections with detailed lists of contents, so facilitating their use, and he catalogued the books at Durham's cell at Finchale. 
Swalwell was entrusted with important offices in the monastery, as guest-master and chief land agent for ten years (1504-14), and then as almoner for over twenty, with responsibility for four hospitals and a school. It was perhaps the period between 1496 and 1500 when he was monastic chancellor that first stimulated his abiding concern for the monastic archives, where he broke new ground in important ways. He gathered up and arranged the series of annual accounts, presented by some twenty-five different monastic office-holders over a period of more than two centuries, and he devised a subject classification for a substantial proportion of the more miscellaneous material. These activities probably made a decisive contribution to the survival of very important sections of Durham Cathedral's muniments, which now form one of the most significant medieval archives in Britain. Swalwell died, probably in Durham, in the second half of 1539, shortly before the monastery where he had spent most of his long life was dissolved on the last day of the year.

Marryat, George Selwyn (1840-1896), angler, was born on 20 June 1840 at Chewton Glen, Milton, Hampshire, the second of the eight children of Lieutenant-Colonel George Marryat and Georgiana Charlotte, 'nee' Selwin, and nephew to the author Frederick Marryat. By 1854 the family had moved to Mapperton House, Dorset, and George Marryat's passion for fly-fishing first blossomed on the River Frome at Maiden Newton in Dorset. After his education at Winchester College (1854-7) his family bought him a commission in the 6th dragoon guards (the carabiniers). He served in India (1859-61) and after deployment on the subcontinent his regiment returned to England, where Marryat received his promotion to second lieutenant on 28 January 1862. After resigning and selling his commission in 1864 he travelled to Australia, where he became a stock rider in the bush. 
Marryat returned to his homeland after a sojourn of about five years. He was living in Edinburgh by about 1872, probably the year in which he married Lucy Dorothea, 'nee' Clinton (1843-1911), daughter of Colonel Frederick Clinton of Ashley Clinton, in Hampshire. They moved back to Hampshire at the end of 1874, and settled at Shidfield (Shedfield), Hampshire. Over the next five years they had three daughters. 
While at Winchester College Marryat had fished on the River Itchen, at a time when the dry fly was the established way to catch trout. Following his return from Australia he became the most expert and celebrated dry-fly fisherman on the southern chalk streams. A chance meeting in April 1879 between Marryat and Frederic Michael Halford, in the hut by the Sheepbridge shallows on the River Test in Hampshire, formed a fishing partnership that has not been equalled. Halford had admitted to Marryat his many shortcomings with tying artificial flies; Marryat resolved to help in any way he could. The partnership produced two very significant books, 'Floating Flies and How to Dress Them' (1886) and 'Dry Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice' (1889). Without Marryat's input it is arguable that Halford would not have written them; but Marryat refused Halford's request to become co-author on the ground that 'it would be impracticable to have two writers'. His only known publications were two letters, one in 'The Field' of 8 January 1881, entitled 'Quill bodies for flies', and one in the 'Fishing Gazette' of 28 June 1884, entitled 'Who invented dry-fly fishing?'. Marryat conducted much of the early fieldwork on the development of the up-eyed 'Snecky Limerick' hook and the new methods of dressing the artificial split-winged dry flies on these new hooks, working closely with Henry Sinclair Hall. 
By 1885 Marryat and his family had moved to the cathedral close in Salisbury, Wiltshire. It was here that he did his most important work on the entomology of the fly-fisherman's natural insect and its matching artificial fly. An accomplished fly-dresser, amateur photographer, and microscope-user, he linked the last two enthusiasms in his fascination for karyokinesis (cell division). He had endless patience, setting about all this research and documentation with a will that was typical of the Victorian country gentleman. He was modest by nature, but widely read, knowing his Shakespeare almost by heart. Marryat could be the life and soul of the party when in the right company, but did not suffer fools gladly. 
Marryat died on 14 February 1896; he suffered influenza followed by a coma, and finally succumbed to a stroke. He was cremated four days later and his ashes were scattered beneath the cedar trees in the cloisters of Salisbury Cathedral. The dry-fly discipline today would not be as complete without Marryat's mastery. He died leaving behind him the most uncontested reputation in the history of trout fly-fishing.

Nowell, Laurence (1530-c.1570), antiquary, was the second son of Alexander Nowell of Read Hall, Whalley, Lancashire, and Grace, daughter of Rafe Catherall of Mitton in the same county. About 1540 his family moved to Woolden Manor, Eccles, near Manchester. By 1550 he had matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, where in April he was elected to the second rank of philosophers, and by October had become lector in mathematics. He graduated BA in 1552, and his name appears in the buttery books as late as December 1554. While at Oxford, he apparently had a dispute with Francis Alford, also of Christ Church, that may have led him to depart for Paris in late 1553. After visiting Rouen, Antwerp, and Louvain, he returned to Oxford but soon set out for Paris via Dieppe. He then journeyed to Geneva to become tutor of two of the sons of Sir James Harington of Exton, Rutland, and in 1557-8 went from Venice to Padua and Rome. Although these visits coincided with Queen Mary's reign, Nowell was neither a religious refugee nor an ordained churchman like his cousin and namesake the future dean of Lichfield ['see below']. 
Shortly after Queen Elizabeth's accession, Nowell returned home and represented Knaresborough, Yorkshire, in her first parliament that sat from 25 January until 8 May 1559. He may have owed his seat to the patronage of Sir Ambrose Cave, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Before the session ended he went into Wiltshire, probably with William Lambarde. If so, it was his earliest known association with this friend who shared his scholarly interest in Old English. Nowell continued exploring the realm, visiting Kent, Chichester, the Isle of Wight, and Northampton. His travels were interrupted by an illness in late 1559, but in 1560 he visited his family in Lancashire and then sailed to Ireland. During his journeys, he kept a commonplace book (University of California at Los Angeles, special collections 170/529) in which he made notes principally from classical works. It was probably not until 1561 that he began to study Anglo-Saxon, which he learned by using as cribs the Latin equivalents of the Old English Bede, the Old English Orosius, the Anglo-Saxon laws, and Aelfric's 'Grammar and Glossary', all of which he was in part at least to transcribe or translate. By early 1563 at the latest he was residing at Sir William Cecil's house in the Strand, London, where he made a transcription (BL, Add. MS 43703) of several Anglo-Saxon texts, including the Old English Bede and the 'Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'. He also owned what is now BL, Cotton MS Vitellius A.xv in the British Library, the collection of Anglo-Saxon writings sometimes known as the Nowell codex, which contains the only surviving text of 'Beowulf'. 
Thomas Randolph had recommended Nowell as a scholar and cartographer to Cecil, who by June 1563 appointed Nowell as the tutor of his ward and future son-in-law, Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford. About that time, having requested employment as Cecil's map maker in a Latin letter, Nowell produced for him a pocket map of the British Isles (BL, Add. MS 62540) on which he sketched images of himself and of Cecil. His other maps, except for four lost after Lambarde presented them to Nowell's friend Adrian Stokes in 1574, are at the British Library (Cotton MS Domitian xviii). 
On or about 25 March 1567, having named Lambarde as one of the executors of his last will and testament, Nowell departed for the continent in order to become more fluent in foreign languages and to pursue other studies. While at the University of Paris, he forwarded to Lambarde a transcript of the 'Gesta Normannorum ducum' of William of Jumieges (University of Virginia, MS Hench 6435a, 4). His friend Daniel Rogers, whom he met in Paris at this time, addressed three poems to him (Hunt., MS HM 31188), one of them dated in July 1569. Nowell moved on to Venice and Padua and then enrolled at the University of Vienna. Next he travelled to Basel and was at Leipzig by August 1569. The last record of his whereabouts is his October matriculation at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau. That same year his cousin Robert Nowell of Gray's Inn bequeathed to him a $5 annuity and some satin cloth. In 1571, having had no message from him for two years, his brothers Charles, John, and Thomas, and seven others petitioned the court of requests to declare Nowell dead and to order Lambarde to release their inheritances. Lambarde reluctantly granted their petition but retained the library Nowell had left in his custody, not only making full use of his manuscripts and books in his own writings but also sharing them with friends. Over the centuries this collection has been widely scattered, especially after the final dispersal of the Lambarde library in 1924. 
Nowell's greatest legacy is the 'Vocabularium Saxonicum', used by generations of lexicographers in manuscript until it was printed as recently as 1952. Although he was familiar with more than half the extant corpus of Old English poetry, his major interest was texts with obvious historical or topographical content, particularly Anglo-Saxon laws. He made the first critical edition of Alfred's laws along with a modern English translation (BL, Henry Davis collection, MS 59 [M 30]), which was used by Lambarde for his 'Archaionomia' (1568). He studied other early laws including the code known as Cnut I-II (Canterbury Cathedral, MS Lit. E 2). No complete inventory of his transcripts and manuscripts can be compiled since discoveries continue to be made. Some of the other most important ones can be found in the libraries of Canterbury Cathedral, Glasgow University, Lambeth Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the Bodleian, Oxford. Although he is best known for his pioneering work in Anglo-Saxon studies, his journeys abroad point to a deep interest in learning about the past that extended well beyond the history of England. 
Until recently, Laurence Nowell the antiquary has been confused with 
Nowell married Mary Glover, a widow with two sons, and between 1567 and 1574 they had four daughters and five sons, including his namesake heir who matriculated at Brasenose College in 1590. With Alexander, Laurence served as executor of their brother Robert's will in 1569. The next year, he denied the charge of Peter Morwent, a prebendary of Lichfield, that he had made seditious speeches against Queen Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. In 1575 he bought an estate in Sheldon and some lands in Coleshill, Warwickshire. In his will, dated 17 October 1576, he named Alexander and his half-brother John Towneley his overseers. He was dead by 22 November, when his successor as dean, George Boleyn, was installed. He was probably buried at Weston, Derbyshire.

Blyden, Edward Wilmot (1832-1912), advocate of pan-Africanism, was born on 3 August 1832 on the island of St Thomas (then under Danish rule) in the West Indies. He was the third of the seven children of Romeo Blyden, a tailor, and his wife, Judith, a schoolteacher. He later claimed that his background was of 'pure Negro' parentage from the Igbo people of eastern Nigeria (Lynch, 3). Edward Blyden was, however, brought up in a largely Jewish and English-speaking community, and with his family attended services of the integrated Dutch Reformed church. In 1842 the Blydens moved to Venezuela, returning about 1845. Influenced by the Revd John P. Knox and his wife, Edward Blyden applied in 1850 to Rutgers Theological College, USA, but was rejected because of his colour; but he remained in the USA with the Knoxes. He met a number of religious leaders involved in the African Colonization Society. Encouraged by them, he went to Monrovia, in recently independent Liberia. There he became a lay preacher in 1853, and soon after a tutor at Alexander high school. 
In 1856 Blyden published his first pamphlet, 'A Voice from Bleeding Africa', and married Sarah Yates, the mixed-race niece of G. P. Yates, vice-president of Liberia. The marriage was not happy, Blyden blaming this on his wife's loyalty to the mixed-race community, of which he became a 'fanatical opponent' (Lynch, 39); there may also have been other sources of discord. The Blydens had three children. Blyden was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1858, being promoted at the same time to be principal of the high school. He conducted a considerable correspondence with prominent people in English-speaking countries, among them W. E. Gladstone, who advised him on classical studies and sent him books on Homer. In 1861 Blyden was appointed Liberian educational commissioner, travelling to the USA and Britain on a tour to lecture, fund-raise, and encourage African-Americans to emigrate to Liberia. In Britain he met Gladstone and other prominent persons, Gladstone offering to support him at a British university. Blyden turned down the offer and on his return to Liberia taught classics at Liberia College. He served as secretary of state from 1864 to 1866, but in 1871 left Liberia for Sierra Leone after a quarrel with Edward James Roye, the new president and hitherto his friend, over an expensive British loan to Liberia (Blyden was declared innocent of the charge of adultery with Roye's wife). He was able after Roye's death to return to Liberia again to head the high school, and from 1877 to 1879 was Liberian minister in London. He was disappointed at his failure to gain financial support for his country. He was minister of the interior in 1880-82 and again president of Liberia College in 1880-84. Once more in exile in Sierra Leone, he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of Liberia in 1885. He was again minister in London in 1892, and was special envoy in Paris and London in 1905. From 1906 to 1910 he was director of Muslim education in Sierra Leone. His health deteriorating, he was operated on for an aneurysm of the knee in the Royal Southern Hospital, Liverpool, in 1909. The Colonial Office arranged a pension of $25 in 1910 (subscribed by the governments of Sierra Leone, Lagos, and the Gold Coast). Blyden died in Sierra Leone, at his home in Rawden Street, Freetown, on 12 February 1912; his coffin was carried by Muslims to the graveyard at Freetown racecourse, where he was given a Christian burial. 
Throughout his life Blyden published widely on race and pan-Africanism. In the Liberian context his views were highly controversial because his concept of the 'negro' largely excluded people of mixed heritage. His hope was that 'pure negroes' would return to Africa and provide an educated elite to lead the continent to freedom. He encouraged Christian-Muslim understanding in Africa. Disappointed by the failure of African-Americans to return to west Africa to provide leadership, he came to see European expansionism as a necessary phase in African development. He consequently supported British expansionism in west Africa, hoping that Sierra Leone would develop into a major west African state. He preferred Britain's localist approach to government in Africa, and strongly opposed the French policy of seeing African territory as an integral part of French government and culture. Blyden worked with Mary Kingsley to encourage a better British understanding of African social systems. He was himself a strong defender, in principle as well as practice, of polygamy. From 1876 he lived with Anna Erskine (a black schoolteacher from Louisiana), though still married and spasmodically living with Sarah, from whom he never formally separated; this probably prompted his resignation from the Presbyterian church in 1886. 
Blyden's collected articles, 'Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race' (1886), with an introduction by Sir Samuel Lewis, created a considerable impact, being published just after the Berlin conference which arranged the partition. In all he published some twenty-nine books and pamphlets. Blyden was important in Africa as a person articulating many of its future concerns, both accepting the imperial phase and already looking past it. In Britain he represented African intelligence of a high order, with an imposing physical presence, at a time when a sense of racial superiority was in danger of becoming instinctive.

O hUiginn family (per. c.1300-c.1600), Gaelic poets, were notable as a learned bardic family in Connaught for several centuries. The origin of the surname O hUiginn is obscure, but it is a noteworthy fact that forenames of Norse origin (such as Iomhar, Maghnus) occur in several of the medieval generations in the genealogy of this family. Therefore, since no native forename Uige(a)nn (genitive Uiginn) has otherwise been attested, it is generally assumed that the surname has been based on a forename which was a borrowing of Norse 'vikingr' 'viking'. In the sixteenth century the surname O hUiginn was to be found widely distributed in the midlands and west of the Shannon. The genealogy given in the seventeenth-century compilation now generally referred to as the 'O Clery Book of Genealogies' was clearly for the Connaught branch of the family, apparently the only one which distinguished itself in the bardic profession. The principal patrons of this learned family over a period of almost 400 years were O'Conor-Sligo in Sligo (barony of Carbury), McWilliam Burke in Mayo, O'Hara in Sligo (barony of Leyny), O'Rourke in Leitrim, and O'Donnell in Donegal.

Heaton, Clement (1824-1882), joint founder of a firm of stained-glass makers and architectural decorators, was born on 21 August 1824 in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and baptized there on 14 November, the only son of James Heaton (1782-1862), Methodist minister, and his wife, Sarah, 'nee' Walmsley. His co-founder James Butler (1830-1913) was born at The Butts, Warwick, the second son of James Butler (1786-1851?), publican, and his wife, Charlotte. Both men learnt their trade in Warwick where, until 1851, Clement Heaton was employed as a glass painter by the local stained-glass maker, William Holland, and James Butler worked as a lead glazier, very probably for the same firm. 
In the early Victorian period the rising tide of the Gothic revival led to a rapid increase in the demand for stained glass. Aware, no doubt, that there were, as yet, few stained-glass makers in the capital, Clement Heaton left Warwick in 1851 or 1852 and travelled to London. Here he set up his own stained-glass studio in Albany Street, and married Mary Louisa Matthews ('b'. 1835), the daughter of a glass cutter, on 17 November 1853. They lived first at 94 Albany Street, later at 8 D'Aumale Villas, Twickenham, and Verulam House, Watford. Two years later James Butler followed Clement Heaton to London where, by 1857, the two men had founded the firm of Heaton and Butler, with premises at 236 Marylebone Road. That year Butler married Kate Stultz (1830-1858), and they lived in Rutland Street, Hampstead. Kate died the following year. About 1865 Butler married, second, Eliza Bacon (1837-1896). 
Although Clement Heaton and James Butler were sound craftsmen, and their business prospered, the artistic quality of the windows they produced in the early years of their partnership cannot be compared with that of the best designers in the field. Two far more accomplished artists, who were also engaged in establishing themselves as stained-glass makers at this date, were John Richard Clayton and Alfred Bell. But though they were skilled designers and draftsmen, their practical knowledge of the processes involved in the manufacture of stained glass was weak. 
Clearly, the two firms must have seen advantage in working together for, in 1858, Heaton and Butler took additional premises at 24A Cardington Street, in the same building as Clayton and Bell. As a result, Heaton and Butler's designs drew closer to those of Clayton and Bell, who may on occasion have drawn the cartoons for the other firm's windows, while Clayton and Bell benefited from the technical expertise of Heaton and Butler who, according to one source, did much of their glass cutting, leading, painting, and fixing at this time. 
The event which enabled the firm of Heaton and Butler to reach the top rank in terms of design, however, was the advent of Robert Turnill Bayne (1837-1915). He was born on 11 December 1837, at Starton in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, the second son of Richard Roskell Bayne (1802-1878), architect and engineer, and his first wife, Ann Turnill. Bayne is said to have had a public school education and begun a career as a portrait painter before turning to stained glass. Initially he was apprenticed to Clayton and Bell but soon left to join Heaton and Butler, becoming a full partner on 26 March 1862. From then on the company was known as Heaton, Butler, and Bayne, the title it retained until it was dissolved in 1953. In 1869 Bayne married Marion Charlotte Hutchings, and they lived first at Ravensbourne Park, Lewisham, moving in 1896 to Wimbledon Park and then to Surbiton, Surrey. As part of his training with Clayton and Bell, Bayne learned to follow the principles of medieval design whereby the figurative elements of the composition are surrounded by a decorative architectural framework. But when he became chief designer of Heaton and Butler, a firm which had not as yet developed a distinctive style of its own, Bayne was free to experiment. Abandoning the strictly historicist approach advocated by Clayton and Bell, he began to heighten the drama of his work by exaggerating the gestures and 'medieval' facial features of the teeming figures that filled his windows. Fine examples of his work at this time are found at St Mary's, Brome, Suffolk (1863), Nordelph Church, Norfolk (1865), and St James's, Chilton Cantelow, Somerset (1865). 
But just as striking as the improvement in design, was the firm's adoption of a much more vivid palette of colours. The production of stained glass is always a collaborative process carried out by a team of craftsmen, and this often makes it difficult to say who may have been responsible for what. However, it seems probable that Clement Heaton played an important part here since he was, throughout his life, particularly interested in the techniques involved in glass making and could, by this date, produce 130 different tints. But such things are also a matter of fashion. Heaton, Butler, and Bayne were not alone in changing their palette in the 1860s; although Clayton and Bell added only a few new colours at this time, Lavers and Barraud, the other major firm established in London during the previous decade, were much more adventurous. Following Pre-Raphaelite taste, both they and Heaton, Butler, and Bayne added lime greens, clear pinks, mauves, oranges, and various shades of blue to the more traditional range of colours -- red, blue, amethyst, brown, and yellow -- used in the medieval period. 
The demand for stained glass reached a peak between 1860 and 1870, and it is no surprise, therefore, to find Heaton, Butler, and Bayne expanding at this time. In 1863 they moved to grand new premises at 14 Garrick Street in Covent Garden, a studio building specially designed for them by Arthur Blomfield, an architect with whom the firm had a long and successful relationship. Here there was sufficient space to experiment with other media and, by 1865, they had not only branched out into the field of painted decoration but were also carrying out designs using mosaic, inlaid stone, and incised mastic work. From 1870 until the beginning of the First World War they were the most prolific of all the firms producing large-scale decorative schemes for churches, public buildings, and private houses. 
By the mid-1860s Heaton, Butler, and Bayne were probably employing upwards of a hundred men. Like all stained-glass firms of this date, they used production-line methods to keep the cost of their work within bounds. A few skilled cartoonists did nothing except figurework, while a second tier of draftsmen specialized in architectural decoration, drapery, or repetitive patterning. A further group of craftsmen carried out the more menial tasks of glass cutting, firing, leading, and fixing of the windows. And yet more men were employed to decorate walls and ceilings. 
About 1870 taste changed again, and the jewel-like windows of the previous decade, formed by a kaleidoscope of different coloured pieces of glass, began to give way to something more sombre. From this time on until the beginning of the First World War, the colour range most frequently used by Heaton, Butler, and Bayne included brown, green, yellow, blue, and deep red. A typical design would also include plenty of contrasting white glass, with features such as yellow hair and gilded ornaments picked out in yellow stain. At the same time the firm abandoned their 'medieval' style, whereby faces and other features were merely drawn in outline, and began to use much more shading to make objects look three-dimensional. This also had the effect of reducing the luminosity of the glass and making the colours darker. 
Some of the most outstanding stained glass made by the firm in the last three decades of the nineteenth century, however, was not designed by the 'in house' cartoonists but by specially commissioned freelance artists. This was the case at St Elisabeth, Reddish, in Manchester, where about 1883, the architect Alfred Waterhouse commissioned Frederick Shields to make the cartoons for the windows. Some years earlier, he also had Shields design glass for the chapel of the duke of Westminster's vast new mansion, Eaton Hall in Cheshire (house dem. 1961, chapel survives), where Henry Stacy Marks was employed to paint murals. Heaton, Butler, and Bayne made all the stained glass for the house and chapel windows, and were also asked to carry out much of the other decoration. They in turn called in Lewis F. Day, an artist who specialized in the design of wall coverings, tiles, and stained glass for domestic interiors, giving him a contract to help with this particular job. 
On 24 February 1882 Clement Heaton died in Bournemouth and was succeeded by his son, Clement J. Heaton (1861-1940). Two years later, following a dispute with the other partners, Heaton resigned and set up his own company, Heaton's Cloisonne Mosaics Ltd, specializing in metalwork and enamelling. In 1893 he emigrated to Switzerland where he became a successful designer, eventually moving to America. Sadly, Robert Turnill Bayne had a stroke in 1885 and, although he lived until 1915, was no longer able to work. He died on 18 September 1915 at his home, Losely Hurst, in Surbiton, Surrey. After this the great years of the firm were over. James Butler died in London in 1913 and was succeeded by Clement James Butler (1859-1929). Richard Cato Bayne (1870-1940) joined the company in 1887, and his only son, Basil Richard Bayne (1897-1953) saw it through its final years.

Heaton, Clement (1824-1882), joint founder of a firm of stained-glass makers and architectural decorators, was born on 21 August 1824 in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and baptized there on 14 November, the only son of James Heaton (1782-1862), Methodist minister, and his wife, Sarah, 'nee' Walmsley. His co-founder James Butler (1830-1913) was born at The Butts, Warwick, the second son of James Butler (1786-1851?), publican, and his wife, Charlotte. Both men learnt their trade in Warwick where, until 1851, Clement Heaton was employed as a glass painter by the local stained-glass maker, William Holland, and James Butler worked as a lead glazier, very probably for the same firm. 
In the early Victorian period the rising tide of the Gothic revival led to a rapid increase in the demand for stained glass. Aware, no doubt, that there were, as yet, few stained-glass makers in the capital, Clement Heaton left Warwick in 1851 or 1852 and travelled to London. Here he set up his own stained-glass studio in Albany Street, and married Mary Louisa Matthews ('b'. 1835), the daughter of a glass cutter, on 17 November 1853. They lived first at 94 Albany Street, later at 8 D'Aumale Villas, Twickenham, and Verulam House, Watford. Two years later James Butler followed Clement Heaton to London where, by 1857, the two men had founded the firm of Heaton and Butler, with premises at 236 Marylebone Road. That year Butler married Kate Stultz (1830-1858), and they lived in Rutland Street, Hampstead. Kate died the following year. About 1865 Butler married, second, Eliza Bacon (1837-1896). 
Although Clement Heaton and James Butler were sound craftsmen, and their business prospered, the artistic quality of the windows they produced in the early years of their partnership cannot be compared with that of the best designers in the field. Two far more accomplished artists, who were also engaged in establishing themselves as stained-glass makers at this date, were John Richard Clayton and Alfred Bell. But though they were skilled designers and draftsmen, their practical knowledge of the processes involved in the manufacture of stained glass was weak. 
Clearly, the two firms must have seen advantage in working together for, in 1858, Heaton and Butler took additional premises at 24A Cardington Street, in the same building as Clayton and Bell. As a result, Heaton and Butler's designs drew closer to those of Clayton and Bell, who may on occasion have drawn the cartoons for the other firm's windows, while Clayton and Bell benefited from the technical expertise of Heaton and Butler who, according to one source, did much of their glass cutting, leading, painting, and fixing at this time. 
The event which enabled the firm of Heaton and Butler to reach the top rank in terms of design, however, was the advent of Robert Turnill Bayne (1837-1915). He was born on 11 December 1837, at Starton in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, the second son of Richard Roskell Bayne (1802-1878), architect and engineer, and his first wife, Ann Turnill. Bayne is said to have had a public school education and begun a career as a portrait painter before turning to stained glass. Initially he was apprenticed to Clayton and Bell but soon left to join Heaton and Butler, becoming a full partner on 26 March 1862. From then on the company was known as Heaton, Butler, and Bayne, the title it retained until it was dissolved in 1953. In 1869 Bayne married Marion Charlotte Hutchings, and they lived first at Ravensbourne Park, Lewisham, moving in 1896 to Wimbledon Park and then to Surbiton, Surrey. As part of his training with Clayton and Bell, Bayne learned to follow the principles of medieval design whereby the figurative elements of the composition are surrounded by a decorative architectural framework. But when he became chief designer of Heaton and Butler, a firm which had not as yet developed a distinctive style of its own, Bayne was free to experiment. Abandoning the strictly historicist approach advocated by Clayton and Bell, he began to heighten the drama of his work by exaggerating the gestures and 'medieval' facial features of the teeming figures that filled his windows. Fine examples of his work at this time are found at St Mary's, Brome, Suffolk (1863), Nordelph Church, Norfolk (1865), and St James's, Chilton Cantelow, Somerset (1865). 
But just as striking as the improvement in design, was the firm's adoption of a much more vivid palette of colours. The production of stained glass is always a collaborative process carried out by a team of craftsmen, and this often makes it difficult to say who may have been responsible for what. However, it seems probable that Clement Heaton played an important part here since he was, throughout his life, particularly interested in the techniques involved in glass making and could, by this date, produce 130 different tints. But such things are also a matter of fashion. Heaton, Butler, and Bayne were not alone in changing their palette in the 1860s; although Clayton and Bell added only a few new colours at this time, Lavers and Barraud, the other major firm established in London during the previous decade, were much more adventurous. Following Pre-Raphaelite taste, both they and Heaton, Butler, and Bayne added lime greens, clear pinks, mauves, oranges, and various shades of blue to the more traditional range of colours -- red, blue, amethyst, brown, and yellow -- used in the medieval period.

Robinson, Sir Thomas, first baronet (bap. 1618?, d. 1683), lawyer and legal writer, was probably the Thomas, son of John Robinson, who was baptized in St Margaret's, Westminster, on 11 September 1618. He became a member of Staple Inn, and entered practice as an attorney of the common pleas in the early 1640s. By about 1648 he was sufficiently established to marry Jane (died 1665), daughter of Lumley Dew, and in Hilary term 1657 he was able to purchase the immensely lucrative office of chief protonotary of the common pleas. This office usually changed hands for over $5000, which was indeed the sum paid for the succession on Robinson's own death. According to custom, he was made an associate bencher of the Inner Temple, where the office was housed, and he soon became one of the inn's principal figures, in social as well as physical stature. After the great fire he contributed over $8000 towards rebuilding 7 King's Bench Walk, which was completed in 1671 and known as Sir Thomas Robinson's Building until the nineteenth century. Six years later he was made a complete bencher, and from 1682 until his death he served as treasurer, taking a keen interest in the improvement of Temple Church and the controversial negotiations over the new organ. The screen in the old hall bore his initials until its demolition in 1867. Meanwhile, in 1676 or 1677, Robinson had purchased Kentwell Hall in Long Melford, Suffolk, an attractive Elizabethan house of red brick with twelve wainscot rooms, where he laid out an avenue of limes in 1678. In January 1682, presumably in return for a further considerable outlay, he was created baronet. In the early hours of 2 August 1683, while Sir Thomas was sleeping in the Temple, a fire spread to King's Bench Walk from the Whitefriars, whereupon 'he, to avoid the fury and violence of the Flames, adventured to leap out at his Chamber Window, and thereby (being a very corpulent Man) so bruised his body, that he soon expired. (Philipps, 136)' When the fire abated, an iron chest was found in Robinson's rooms containing melted gold and silver plate thought to be worth nearly $10,000. He was buried on 7 August in the south aisle of Temple Church, where a monumental inscription remained until 1941, when it was destroyed in an air raid; a coffin plate with his arms was discovered in the rubble. 
In 1684 there was published under Robinson's name 'A Book of Special Entries', a collection of pleadings compiled by him in the course of his practice. The preface claimed that they had been selected from a 'Many-Volumed Atlas of Pleadings' and destined for the press 'chiefly for the Benefit of the Clerks and Attorneys of his Office'. Robinson also left an unpublished series of notebooks that were found in Kentwell Hall in 1960 and are now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. These contain brief reports or notes of common pleas cases from 1657 to 1678, in Robinson's autograph, with some memoranda on practice stretching back to 1641. The baronetcy became extinct in 1743.

Hastings, Katherine, countess of Huntingdon (c.1538-1620), noblewoman, was one of the youngest of the thirteen children of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland (1504-1553), and his wife, Jane ('c'.1509-1555), daughter of Sir Edward Guildford. On 25 May 1553, four days after the marriage of Guildford Dudley to Lady Jane Grey, Northumberland celebrated Katherine's wedding to Henry Hastings (1536?-1595), the eldest son of Francis Hastings, second earl of Huntingdon. Within a year the bride saw her father executed and her husband imprisoned in the Tower for their involvement in the attempt to divert the succession in favour of Lady Jane Grey, though Mary quickly pardoned Lord Hastings, great-nephew of her archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Pole. Elizabeth's promotion of Robert Dudley immediately after her accession further reinforced the young couple's connections with the court. 
The premature death of the second earl of Huntingdon in June 1560 placed upon the new earl responsibility for the education and settlement of his nine brothers and sisters, while the countess increasingly concerned herself over her husband's financial difficulties. Both having been introduced to protestantism at an early age, as soon as they came into their inheritance they set about creating a godly household at Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire under the guidance of the former Genevan exile Anthony Gilby. In 1570 Gilby published for the use of their family his translation of Calvin as 'Commentaries... upon the Prophet Daniell', following it in 1580 with another translation from Beza, 'The Psalmes of David Truely Opened and Explaned', intended specifically for Lady Katherine. 
When Elizabeth fell ill with smallpox in November 1562, the protestant party looked to Huntingdon as her successor, on which account his wife received a 'privy nippe' from the queen the following spring (BL, Harley MS 787, fol. 16). Handicapped by his birth, Huntingdon obtained no major public office until 1569, when the queen employed him to guard Mary, queen of Scots. Then, late in 1572, she appointed him president of the council in the north and the countess, while still frequently attending court, assumed charge of the viceregal household at the King's Manor in York. Although she had no children of her own (she may have suffered a miscarriage in early 1566), she showed a particular interest in the training of young people. As he lay dying in Dublin in 1576, the first earl of Essex entrusted his two daughters and younger son to the earl and his wife at York, where they also welcomed the countess's favourite nephew, Thomas Sidney, after his father's death in 1586. The household established at Hackness in Yorkshire at the turn of the century by Margaret Hoby with its round of public and private religious observances almost certainly mirrors the practices she learned from her mistress the countess of Huntingdon, who at this time received the dedications of Nathaniel Gilby's translation of G. Sohn as 'A Briefe and Learned Treatise... of the Antichrist' (1592), John Stockwood's translation of L. Daneau entitled 'A Fruitfull Commentarie upon the Twelve Small Prophets' (1594), and Francis Bunny's 'A Comparison betweene the Auncient Fayth of the Romans, and the New Romish Religion' (1595). 
The earl of Huntingdon was planning to join his wife at court when he died unexpectedly at York on 14 December 1595. Despite the great care the queen took over breaking the news, the countess was devastated by grief. Refusing to accept the administration of her husband's much encumbered estate, she settled in Chelsea and remained very close to Elizabeth until the queen's death. In her widowhood she devoted herself to advancing the career of Sir Robert Sidney, delighting in having his young children in her care during his embassies abroad. Theological writers also continued to seek her patronage, and books dedicated to her in her latter years included Henry Holland, 'The Workes... of M. Richard Greenham' (1599), Thomas Savile, 'The Raising of them that are Fallen' (1606), and Thomas Collins, 'The Penitent Publican' (1610). Approaching eighty in 1618, she still prided herself on her ability 'to breed and govern yong gentlewomen' ('Rutland MSS', 1.99). She died at Chelsea, and was buried in her mother's tomb in Chelsea Old Church on 14 August 1620.

Turner, Henry (1656/7-1724), lawyer, was the eldest son of John Turner (died 1669), a merchant of Fulham, London, and his wife, Martha Pettiward (died 1681) of Putney, Surrey. Turner's parents married in December 1655, John Turner receiving a marriage portion of $2500. With some of this money, in 1658 John Turner purchased some land from the St John family in Leicestershire, and acquired a mortgage on Cold Overton Hall, where he made his seat. Henry Turner was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 February 1672, and he may have entered Oriel College, Oxford, on 28 April 1672. The law was his chosen career, and he was called to the bar on 9 July 1679. In 1681 Turner had to ward off a challenge to his right to present to Sapcote, Leicestershire, from the earl of Huntingdon. 
Turner married on 9 February 1688 at St Martin Outwich, London, Mary (1671/2-1735), daughter of Thomas Frewen MP of Brickwell House, Northiam, Sussex, and his second wife, Bridget Layton. They had one son and one daughter. In June 1691 Turner and his fellow barrister Edward Strode challenged the right of the masters of the bench of Lincoln's Inn to appoint a preacher in succession to John Tillotson, the new archbishop of Canterbury, but without success. Turner was made a serjeant-at-law in November 1700, being sponsored by his father-in-law, Frewen, and the tory politician Anthony Hammond. 
Turner was presumably a very active barrister, for in December 1717 he was sufficiently wealthy to invest $600 in East India Company stock. He served as treasurer of Serjeants' Inn from 1721 to 1724. Turner died on 29 March 1724, aged sixty-seven, while attending the assizes at Coventry, and was buried at Sapcote on 4 April. His will, made in December 1718, made reference to the fact that most of his landed estate had been settled previously. The remainder of his real and personal estate was left to his son, John (1691-1753), also a barrister. In 1727 John married Selina Frewen, the daughter of Sir Edward Frewen and a granddaughter of Thomas Frewen and his first wife, Judith Woolverstone. Turner's daughter, Martha (1695-1752), had married in 1713 Selina's brother, Thomas Frewen. Turner's wife survived him, dying on 13 October 1735.

Corder, Stephen Pit (1918-1990), linguistic scholar, was born on 6 October 1918, at 4 Bootham Terrace, York, the second of the two sons of Philip Corder ('b'. 1885), schoolmaster, and his wife, Johanna Adriana van der Mersch ('b'. 1887). His father was English and his mother Dutch. Pit, as he was known to colleagues, attended the Quaker school, Bootham, in York. At Merton College, Oxford (1936-9), he read modern languages. Corder's father belonged to an old Quaker family and was himself a master at Bootham School. After Oxford, Corder taught at Ayton (Quaker) school until he was called up for military service in the Second World War. Having registered as a conscientious objector, he was awarded exemption conditional on his working with the Friends' Ambulance Unit (FAU). He served with the FAU throughout the war period in Finland and Egypt. In 1946 Corder married Nancy Proctor ('b'. 1916). Second cousins, they maintained his mother's house in the Lake District during their years abroad. They had two sons and a daughter. 
After the war Corder joined the British Council, and served in Austria, Turkey, Colombia, and Jamaica. At the time the council was rapidly expanding its English teaching operations worldwide. For this purpose it needed a cadre of specialists. Corder's background in language studies and his own interest in the work led in 1957 to his joining the newly established school of applied linguistics in the University of Edinburgh to study for the postgraduate diploma in applied linguistics. After that year he was seconded for a period to the Nigerian ministry of education in order to develop language teaching materials for television. Then in 1961 he was outposted by the British Council to the University of Leeds, where Peter Strevens, with whom he had served in the FAU, was developing postgraduate training in English language teaching. In 1964 he resigned from the British Council on appointment as director of the school of applied linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. There he remained for the rest of his career, serving successively as senior lecturer, professor of applied linguistics, head of the department of applied linguistics, and head of the very large department of linguistics, which had more than thirty academic staff. He was a founder member of the British Association of Applied Linguistics, following Peter Strevens as its second chair, president of the International Association of Applied Linguistics for two successive periods of three years each, a member of the British Council's English teaching advisory committee, and the first holder of a university chair in applied linguistics in the UK (and possibly in the world). He was promoted to a personal chair in 1971 and was created emeritus professor on retirement in 1983. 
The Edinburgh school (later department) of applied linguistics had been set up in the late 1950s with government funding under the Colombo plan to provide at an advanced level research-based training for English teachers from the former colonies. Corder quickly brought together a young and enthusiastic team of academic researchers, and with them developed the influential teaching materials that became internationally known through the four volumes of the 'Edinburgh Course in Applied Linguistics', published by Oxford University Press (1973-7). As academic applied linguistics swiftly expanded to other universities, many of Corder's students were appointed to lead the new departments. 
Corder's publications chart his own intellectual development, moving from the very traditional (and successful) textbook 'An International English Practice Book' (1960), through the early attempt to integrate language teaching with situation in 'The Visual Element in Language Teaching' (1966), on to the magisterial defining of a coherent linguistic discipline in 'Introduction to Applied Linguistics' (1973), and finally to the innovative cognitive approach in his later papers, brought together in 'Error Analysis and Interlanguage' (1981). It was these papers in which he offered a view of language learning that captured the imagination of researchers internationally, providing them with a rationale for investigation that remains hugely productive. What Corder pointed to was both daring and obvious, but he was the first to provide the necessary explanation: namely, that the learning of a second or foreign language is developmental, that it follows a sequence that can be checked, and that it can be studied by analysing the errors that learners make. These errors, he insisted, are signs of positive thinking rather than of negative inadequacy. Corder's claim that the learner's language, which, following a seminal paper by Larry Selinker (1972), he termed 'interlanguage', is a language in its own right is now generally accepted. 
In spite of the esteem of his colleagues in British applied linguistics, in the late 1970s and 1980s Corder seems to have found himself increasingly isolated intellectually. In part this reflected his growing dissatisfaction with the British tradition of English language teaching, to which applied linguistics was initially attached and which Corder himself had done so much to promote in his early career and in the 'Edinburgh Course in Applied Linguistics'. That approach he came to see as finally wanting, considering that its attempt to marry bits of theory to practical issues was ultimately incoherent. What was needed, he seems to have thought, was a proper marriage between practice and theory. His dissatisfaction also reflected both his own excitement in ideas, his moving on always to new ventures, and his lack of interest in anything empirical, whether in practice or in research. Language teaching as such did not engage him, thereby absolving his students and younger scholars from any responsibility for the ever-increasing gap between language teaching practice and language acquisition research. Neither was he personally excited by research. That he left to his students. What really mattered to Corder was the sudden poetic or artistic insight, 'the incision of inspiration which cut through the clutter of established thought' (Widdowson, vi). 
Corder's ideas were influential but he did not establish a 'school'. He inspired by example and by his own intellectual curiosity. He belonged to a very British tradition of speculative curiosity. His hobbies showed that, just as much as did his intellectual interests. His craftsmanship in wood, his music, and his home-making and family were as important to him as his career. He was a man of conviction, clear about his place in the world. That is why he could move from one phase of his career to another with finality. After a series of mild heart attacks he retired in 1983, and when he and his wife moved back to the Lake District he donated all his academic books to his department. They and the rest of his academic life had provided a temporary vehicle for his speculation. He did not look back. Corder died of a heart attack on 27 January 1990 at his home, Burnside Cottage, Braithwaite, near Keswick. He was survived by his wife and children.

Sheffield, Douglas, Lady Sheffield (1542/3-1608), noblewoman, was born in 1542 or 1543 (she was seventeen when she married in 1560), the eldest of the three daughters of William Howard, first Baron Howard of Effingham (c.1510-1573), naval commander, and his second wife, Margaret (died 1581), third daughter of Sir Thomas Gamage of Coety, Glamorgan, and his wife, Margaret. Her elder brother was Charles Howard, second Baron Howard of Effingham and first earl of Nottingham (1536-1624). The best explanation for her unusual Christian name is that her godmother was probably Margaret Stewart, 'nee' Douglas, countess of Lennox. 
In the absence of any family papers the circumstances of Douglas Howard's childhood are unknown, but although she has left no other evidence of serious intellectual pursuits (there were only four books dedicated to her), she spoke and wrote French with some fluency. Her father protected her cousin Elizabeth I (1533-1603) in 1554-5, despite being lord high admiral to Mary I. For this service he was appointed lord chamberlain of the household at Elizabeth's accession, and Douglas Howard and her sister Mary (died 1600) maids of honour by the time of her coronation. In autumn 1560, however, she vacated her place on her marriage to John Sheffield, second Baron Sheffield ('c'.1538-1568), nobleman, of Butterwick, Lincolnshire, only son and heir of Edmund Sheffield, first Baron Sheffield, and his wife, Anne. According to Robert Kenny, her dowry amounted to a miserly $800. The queen, however, provided a wedding gift on 27 October 1560 (BL, Add. MS 5751A, fol. 57'r'). The couple had two surviving children, Edmund Sheffield, third Baron Sheffield and first earl of Mulgrave (1565-1646), and Elizabeth (died 1600), who married Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond (1531-1614), in 1583. Lord Sheffield died on 10 December 1568 and his widow returned to court as an extraordinary gentlewoman of the privy chamber. 
In the early 1570s Douglas Sheffield began an affair with Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester (1532/3-1588), courtier and magnate, the fifth son of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Jane, that came to dominate the rest of her life. There is only one item of reliable evidence for the affair, apart from the circumstances of the birth of their son, Sir Robert Dudley (1574-1649), on 7 August 1574, and gossip at court in May 1573 that Sheffield and her sister Frances (1553/4-1598) were both 'very far in love' with Leicester (LPL, MS 3197, fol. 79). This is the long undated letter Leicester wrote to her at some point before 1574, defending his refusal to marry for fear of Elizabeth's displeasure ('Letter... to a lady', 14-26). However, in 1584-5 the tract 'Leicester's Commonwealth' broadcast round Europe details of what had been the discreet knowledge of the court. More controversial still were the two depositions Sheffield supplied on 6-7 June 1604 in 'the great cause of Sir Robert Dudley', the court of Star Chamber case arising from his claim to be Leicester's legitimate son, in which she declared under oath that Leicester had formally married her (CKS, U 1475/L 2/3, items 12-13). 
The story originating in 'Leicester's Commonwealth' and embellished in the seventeenth century that their affair began at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, during the royal progress in 1568 and that Leicester had Lord Sheffield poisoned to expedite their adultery is a myth, not least because Elizabeth never visited Belvoir. In his letter Leicester specifically mentions that his relationship with Douglas Sheffield began 'after yor wydowed beganne uppon the first occasione of my cominge to you' ('Letter... to a lady', 21). According to 'Leicester's Commonwealth', she gave birth to a daughter by Leicester about 1572 at Dudley Castle, Staffordshire, the home of her sister Mary, who married Edward Sutton (known as Dudley), fourth Baron Dudley, in early 1571, but the child was stillborn and buried secretly. 
In 1604 Sheffield vehemently denied she had any children by Leicester other than Robert Dudley. She claimed that she married Leicester at her family's house at Esher, Surrey, between 11 November and 25 December 1573, having persuaded him to agree to a contract of marriage in 1571 because she believed then that she was pregnant. Although her testimony was central to her son's case, she could supply no supporting evidence and claimed that servants had stolen all the records of her marriage, apparently at Leicester's behest. She did, however, state that the principal mover of the marriage was her cousin Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk (1538-1572), and it is possible that he encouraged the affair to solidify an alliance with Leicester for his own rehabilitation in 1570-71. Equally obscure are the circumstances under which Leicester abandoned her. She deposed that at some point before his marriage to Lettice Devereux, dowager countess of Essex, in 1578, he offered her $700 a year for life to disclaim their marriage. When she refused, 'he departed from her with protestation not to come any more to her' (CKS, U 1475/L 2/3, item 13, fol. 12). 
On 28 November 1579 Sheffield secretly married at her house at Blackfriars, London, the gentleman pensioner Edward Stafford (1552-1605), diplomat, of London, first son of Sir William Stafford of Chebsey, Staffordshire, and his second wife, Dorothy. This marriage was in its own way as controversial as her affair with Leicester. Most of what is known of the circumstances comes from Stafford's own lengthy deposition in 1604, which was testimony against Sheffield, for if she had been married to Leicester she had committed bigamy in marrying him (CKS, U 1475/L/2/4, item 3). Stafford stated that he had courted her in the summer of 1579 after his first wife died. On 1 November 1579 Sheffield agreed to marry him and told him then that she had contracted marriage with Leicester and had borne him a son. 
Immediately after his marriage, Stafford left for France as Elizabeth's envoy to Francois, duc d'Anjou. He finally returned to England on 16 February 1580, when he was summoned to a dramatic interview with the queen. After forcing him to admit that he had married Sheffield, Elizabeth claimed to have evidence that she was already married to Leicester. With a mixture of bribery and cajolery she tried through Stafford and others to persuade Sheffield to testify to this effect. Sheffield -- almost hysterical -- refused to concede any more than breach of contract. Her refusal, Stafford considered, was crucial evidence against the marriage. There is some external confirmation of this phase of the saga. On 8 February the French ambassador, Castelnau de Mauvissiere, reported that Elizabeth was angry because Stafford had secretly married a cousin of hers. 
When the discrepancy between her testimony and her husband's was put to Sheffield in 1604 she claimed that she had believed that since Leicester had remarried she was free to do so as well. Thanks to intimidation by Leicester -- and after his death by his widow and her son, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex -- she had been afraid ever to mention their marriage again. This, however, is not the only unresolved question. How did Elizabeth find out about Sheffield's marriages? It is possible that the famous revelation to her by Jean de Simier, Anjou's agent, was not just that Leicester was married to the dowager countess of Essex, but that he was already married to Sheffield as well. A second issue is whether Leicester actually arranged Sheffield's marriage to Stafford, as Mauvissiere was informed. She and Stafford vehemently denied this and made much of their hatred of Leicester when questioned at length on the subject in 1604. In his opening statement Sir Robert Dudley described Stafford as 'a man very adverse' to Leicester (Hawarde, 199). Yet Stafford and Leicester were on good terms before 1579. Last there is the issue of the young Robert Dudley himself. Sheffield deposed in 1604 that Leicester offered her $1000 for the custody of their son, but she refused. In fact custody appears to have been settled quite amicably. By 1580 Robert Dudley was 'being then brought upp at the Lord Northes' -- with Leicester's close friend Roger North, second Baron North -- yet he also had 'leave to see the said ladie [Sheffield]' (CKS, U 1475/L/2/4, item 3, fol. 36). 
By autumn 1580 Sheffield was 'great with child' and ultimately she and Stafford had two sons, but both predeceased their parents and little is known about them (CKS, U 1475/L2/4. item 3, fol. 33). Marriage brought her no financial advantages, for Stafford was notoriously poor and admitted in 1583 that he was dependent on her jointure income from the Sheffield estate. In October of that year he was appointed ambassador to the French court and she accompanied him. Thanks to her place at Elizabeth's court and her command of French, Sheffield was the most socially successful of all the wives of the Elizabethan ambassadors in France. Not only did she get on famously with Catherine de' Medici, but she also made a significant contribution to the administration of the Valois court. At the beginning of 1585 Henri III promulgated a new series of household ordinances intended to give him greater privacy. These, Jacques de Thou later recorded, were based on discussions he had had with Sheffield about Elizabeth's practice. 
Sheffield was equally involved in the more controversial aspects of Stafford's embassy. In December 1583 her cousin Charles Arundel arrived in Paris following his implication in the Throckmorton plot, and she and Stafford entertained him, unaware (so they said) of the reasons for his departure from England. At the same time Stafford proposed that his wife should disguise herself as a Catholic in order to gain greater access to the French court and penetrate the English exile circles. This plan was firmly quashed. During spring and summer 1584 Arundel and his friends compiled 'Leicester's Commonwealth', and Sheffield's affair with Leicester was high among its juicier contents. Stafford was relatively relaxed about the publication of the first (English) edition in the autumn of 1584, but was seriously alarmed by the preparation of a French edition with an 'addition' supplied from England in the spring of 1585. He then reported that embarrassment caused by the first edition had made his wife ill and he was worried about the possible effects of the new one. She may have contemplated retiring to England at this point, but he persuaded her to 'pluck up a good heart' and stay with him ('CSP for.', '1584-5', 400). 
What is particularly interesting is that while Sheffield was identified in the first edition, Stafford was sufficiently close to the compilers to be assured by them that she would not be in the French edition. This was in fact the case, but the 'addition' was another matter. It included a deliberately obscene libel, the story that Leicester tried to seduce a lady of honour with an aphrodisiac containing his own semen. Although the lady was not identified, the fact that she was described as still living made Sheffield an obvious candidate. The extent of Stafford and Sheffield's involvement with the compilers of 'Leicester's Commonwealth' remains a perplexing issue. Neither of them would appear to have wanted her personal affairs exposed in this manner, but they were close to Arundel and how else could the work have contained so much detail? The editor of the modern edition leaves the question open, but then he does not consider the references to Sheffield to be more than a 'jest or two', which is undoubtedly an understatement (Peck, 29-31). The case against her involvement rests primarily on her later denial of the stillborn daughter. 
Even more puzzling is the fact that the publication of 'Leicester's Commonwealth' did not terminate Stafford and Sheffield's relations with Arundel. Arundel advised the Spanish agent in Paris in 1584 that Stafford could be bribed, and he was the intermediary between Stafford and Bernardino de Mendoza when Stafford's 'treason' began in earnest in 1587. The extent of Sheffield's involvement in this is unknown, but one of Stafford's attractions to the Spaniards was that her brother was lord high admiral and Arundel's friends claimed to have received political information from her. 
Stafford remained as ambassador in France until 1591, but he sent his wife home in August 1588 for her own protection. Sheffield arrived at Dover the day Leicester died (4 September), and was gratified to learn that he had named her son heir to his estates after his brother Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, and that 'the Queen had assured her that shee would take great care of him'. To this Stafford replied 'with his acustomed humour... that whensoever that the Queene did the said Sir Robert good the next newes the said Lady Sheffield should heare would be that he [Stafford] was chosen Pope' (CKS, U 1475/L/2/4, item 3, fols. 76-9). Sheffield returned to service at court during the next decade, although there are only a few references to her. She was certainly there in July 1592, when she participated in a scheme to persuade Henri of Navarre to retain a portrait that Elizabeth was sending to his sister, Catherine of Bourbon. Her letter to the French ambassador, Beauvoir la Nocle, is the one known example of her French composition. It includes an apology for her 'movez escritur, qui est desaprins ['sic'] depuis que suis en Engleterre' (Egerton, 415). 
Sheffield's involvement in Sir Robert Dudley's case is the final mystery of her life. Dudley filed suit for defamation over his bastardy at the commissary court at Lichfield, Staffordshire, in September 1603. Stafford heard about the suit shortly afterwards and was 'as much amased as ever he was at any thinge in his life'. Angry at having his own marriage called into question, he went to see his wife at Sudeley Castle, Gloucestershire. After a stormy encounter he was convinced that she had been browbeaten by her son into supporting his case, though only under the condition that Dudley would not use her evidence until she was dead. Stafford claimed he had persuaded her not to 'medle nor entre with the matter any more', but, after he left, Dudley came to see her and 'did so terrifye her... tellinge her that shee was soe far gone that theare was noe torninge back' (CKS, U 1475/L/2/4, item 3, fols. 44, 55, 58, 64). Sheffield claimed that she was not involved in the Lichfield case and only agreed to acknowledge her marriage to Leicester after it, 'althogh she hath been often moved by her son for such purpose' (CKS, U 1475/L 2/3, item 13, fol. 1). She denied she had delayed in order to ensure that her testimony confirmed that of her son's other witnesses. Yet, however important her depositions were to her son's case, they were ignored in the Star Chamber judgment, which was concerned specifically with the 'conspiracy' behind the Lichfield suit. Many, both at the time and since, have noted that the substantive issue of her marriage to Leicester was never addressed at the trial, let alone resolved, but the inconclusive result also saved her from a possible charge of perjury. 
Sheffield tried to maintain contact with Dudley in his self-imposed exile in Florence through the Tuscan agent in London, but in her last years she drew closer to her elder son, Lord Sheffield. She made her will on 14 September 1608, though still 'in health of body and mind'. She requested burial either in Reigate, Surrey, with her parents or in St Margaret's, Westminster, 'by my sister', Lady Dudley, not mentioning that Stafford, who had died on 5 February 1605, was buried there as well (Greenfield, 368-70). Her executor was 'my friend' William Crashaw, a puritan preacher then closely associated with Lord Sheffield (Adams, 'Protestant cause', 434). She died in Westminster at the beginning of December 1608, and was buried in St Margaret's on the 11th. No monument to her or to Stafford was erected. 
Sheffield has either attracted sympathy as a betrayed woman or been dismissed as insubstantial. Neither verdict is justified. It should not be forgotten that her sister Frances, who became first the mistress and then the second wife of Edward Seymour, first earl of Hertford (1539?-1621), enjoyed almost as colourful a love life as she did. She was clearly a woman of intelligence, though also of stormy temper and powerful mood swings. For all Stafford's claims of a happy marriage, there were frictions there as well: he referred to jars with his wife in 1586, and admitted that she was annoyed by his joke about the queen in 1588. Sheffield's claim in 1604 that she had been married to Leicester can no longer be credited, for there are simply too many discrepancies in her account. The Tuscan agent, who investigated her son's claims in 1621, neatly put his finger on it: 'his friends maintain that his father married Lady Sheffield, but they are unable to account for her marriage during his lifetime, an act so injurious to the alleged legitimacy of her son' ('Skrine MSS', 183).

Wyndham, Sir Hugh (1624-1671), politician, was the eldest son of Sir Edmund Wyndham MP (1600/01-1681) of Kentsford, St Decumans, Somerset, and his first wife, Christabella (died 1658), daughter of Hugh Pyne MP of Cathanger, Somerset. His mother was governess to the infant Prince Charles, which led to later comments that Wyndham was Charles II's 'foster brother, they both sucked the same milk' (BL, Harley MS 7020, fol. 38). Wyndham was an active royalist in the civil war, receiving a knighthood at some date before 21 July 1645. He was captured at the siege of Bridgwater in 1645, and may possibly have entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 8 October 1646. If he did enter the university, he soon abandoned his studies, for in April 1649 he was on board 'The Guinea' when it was captured. Wyndham seems to have been disguised as a common sailor, and escaped to resume his royalist activities on board the 'Santa Teresa'. When this ship was captured, he was sent to Pendennis Castle charged with high treason. While a captive he met his future wife, Joan (1631-1694), daughter of Sir Francis Drake, first baronet, whom he married on 4 February 1650 at Buckland. The Drakes had important parliamentarian connections and Wyndham was able to compound for his estates, selling a small parcel of land before paying off the fine in January 1652. Wyndham was not involved in royalist plotting before the Restoration. 
Wyndham was elected for Minehead at the 1661 general election. He was an opponent of religious toleration and in 1664 he was noted as a court adherent. On 16 October 1667 Wyndham complained to the Commons about the conduct of Lord Chief Justice Kelyng at the Somerset assizes. Wyndham, acting as chairman of the grand jury, and his fellow jurors were confronted by a case in which they found that a man had been killed 'per infortunium' (through misfortune). Kelyng refused to accept this and ordered them to consider finding a bill either 'billa vera' (well founded) or 'ignoramus'. When the jury refused to alter their findings Kelyng fined some of them $20 a man, and bound them to good behaviour and to appear before the king's bench. Wyndham replied that he would claim his privilege as an MP. The Commons investigated Wyndham's complaint, and on 13 December Kelyng was brought before the bar of the Commons. Upon hearing what Kelyng had to say Wyndham remarked that although the lord chief justice 'had given him some unhandsome passionate speeches, as that he was the head of a faction and that he would make [him] know he was now his servant' ('Diary of John Milward', 169), since he had taken no notice of it in his defence he would forget it and forgive him. This no doubt helped the chief justice, for although the Commons passed resolutions affirming that the fining and imprisonment of jurors was illegal, it took no further action against the judge. 
Wyndham remained a court supporter, remarking on 18 February 1668 that the new 'Triennial Bill' was 'brought in, I had almost said with impudence' (Grey, 1.82) by Sir Richard Temple, third baronet. Following a petition of 10 December 1668 Wyndham was appointed customer of Bridgwater on 4 January 1669. Wyndham's father married for a second time in November 1669, and shortly beforehand he seems to have made over Kentsford to his son. Wyndham himself, however, was not a well man, and on 22 May 1671 his father wrote to Secretary of State Williamson informing him of his imminent journey to Somerset 'on account of the dangerous sickness of my son' ('CSP dom.', '1671', 260). Wyndham did not recover, dying on 20 July. He was buried at St Decumans, and his epitaph complained that he had 'lost fortune, blood [and] gained nought but scars' (Wyndham, 264) during his sufferings for the crown in the civil wars. His only son, Edmund, succeeded to the estate, dying childless in 1698.

Dudley, Anne, countess of Warwick (1548/9-1604), courtier, was the eldest of the three daughters of Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford (1526/7-1585), magnate, and his first wife, Margaret (died 1562), daughter of Sir John St John of Bletsoe, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Margaret. Thanks to the loss of most of the Russell family papers for the sixteenth century her childhood is effectively a blank. How well educated she was is equally unknown. She was said to have been 'no good secretary' in 1600 ('Letters', ed. Collins, 2.192), and her sister Margaret was taught no language other than English. 
Anne Russell's life was shaped by two events in her adolescence: her appointment as a maid of honour to Elizabeth I in 1559 and then her marriage at the age of sixteen to Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick (c.1530-1590), magnate, fourth son of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Jane, in the queen's chapel at Whitehall Palace on 11 November 1565. It is possible that she entered Elizabeth's household before the accession. In 1564 Warwick's brother Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester (1532/3-1588), referred to Bedford having 'as it were bequeathed' ('Unpublished lettter', 284) his daughter to the queen, and Warwick in his will requested Elizabeth 'to continue her good favour towards my said wife, whom I leave to continue her most faithfull and devoted servant' ('Letters', ed. Collins, 1.42). Anne Russell's marriage to Warwick was arranged between her father and Leicester in autumn 1564. Leicester carefully sought Elizabeth's permission and she gave the union her enthusiastic backing. The marriage was celebrated with great ceremony and was pregnant with political symbolism, for it not only sealed the alliance of two of the leading protestant dynasties, but was also vital for the Dudley succession. Warwick was nearly twenty years older than Anne and no children had survived from his two previous marriages, while Leicester was unmarried at the time. Yet this marriage proved childless too, and was accepted by Leicester as such early in the 1570s. 
According to her admiring niece and goddaughter, Lady Anne Clifford (1590-1676), the countess was 'a mother in affection' to her youngest brother, William Russell, first Baron Russell of Thornhaugh (c.1553-1613), and her sisters Elizabeth Bourchier, countess of Bath (1558-1605), and Margaret Clifford, countess of Cumberland (1560-1616), following the early death of their mother, and later to their children (Williamson, 37). Anne may have had a particular influence on her father, which gave her a leading role in the family crisis that broke out after his death on 28 July 1585. As a result of the deaths of Bedford's three elder sons the earldom was inherited by his grandson Edward Russell. The third earl of Bedford was a minor and, since his mother was dead as well, Leicester and Warwick claimed and initially received his wardship on behalf of the countess of Warwick. However, this settlement was challenged by Elizabeth Russell (1528-1609), linguist and courtier, the widow of Bedford's uncle, John Russell, Baron Russell. She was a notoriously combative woman, who accused the countess of Warwick of persuading the second earl of Bedford to revoke an earlier settlement for John Russell and his heirs in the will he made on 7 April 1584, thus disinheriting her two daughters. She appealed to her brother-in-law, William Cecil, Baron Burghley, and to the queen, who had second thoughts. This in turn provoked Warwick to complain on 31 August 1585 about the queen's treatment of 'my poor afflicted wyfe' (TNA: PRO, SP 12/181/238). The Dudleys were ultimately successful in obtaining the wardship, but Lady Russell was still charging the countess with 'cruelty' as late as 1601 ('Salisbury MSS', 9.562). 
The countess's marriage appears to have been a model of domestic harmony and partnership. When Sir Edward Stafford came to see the dying Warwick at Bedford House in February 1590 (he died on the 21st), he found her distraught, 'sitting by the fire so full of teares that she could not speak' (CKS, U 1475/L2/4, item 3, m. 80). She was no less close to Warwick's family. In his first will (1582) Leicester effusively left 'my noble & worthy sister the countys of Warwyk at whose hands I have ever found great love & kindnes [a gift worth 100 marks] praying hir to accept yt as from hym that in his lyffe tyme did both honor & esteme hir asmoch as any brother did his syster' (Longleat House, Dudley papers, box 3, article 56, m. 10). However, there was a less fortunate side to the Dudley connection. When he died Warwick left her North Hall, his house at Northaw, Hertfordshire, and his fee simple lands as an estate of inheritance, and she lived there for the rest of her life. But he also left her debts totalling over $7000. After her own death the heir to her Dudley lands, Sir Robert Sidney, inherited a residual debt of $2700. In 1574 Warwick added the lands he had gained from the 'Great Berkeley Law-Suit' to her jointure (Berkeley Castle, charter 5211), and as a result she faced legal battles with Henry Berkeley, seventh Baron Berkeley, in 1593 and 1597. In 1599 she lamented to Sir Robert Cecil that 'suits and troubles at law have emptied my purse' ('Salisbury MSS', 9.21). 
During the 1570s and 1580s the earl and countess of Warwick lived either at North Hall or at court, and her attendance on the queen was thus uninterrupted. The countess served as an extraordinary gentlewoman of the privy chamber until the end of the reign and, according to Anne Clifford, was 'more beloved and in greater favour with the queen than any other woman in the kingdom' (Gilson, 24-5). Since Anne Clifford was only thirteen when Elizabeth died, there is an element of legend here. Nevertheless in the 1590s the countess, her sister-in-law, Katherine Hastings, countess of Huntingdon (after she was widowed in 1595), and Charles Howard, first earl of Nottingham, the lord admiral, were widely understood to be the queen's closest intimates, and Anne was among those attending Elizabeth at her death on 24 March 1603. Interestingly, she feared Elizabeth's death might cause a 'commotion' and advised her sister and niece to take refuge in her London house. Although she was graciously received by King James on his arrival, Anne Clifford later remembered that Anne of Denmark 'shewed no favour to the elderly ladies'. In the autumn of 1603 the countess retired to North Hall 'something ill and melancholy' ('Diaries of Lady Anne Clifford', 21, 23-4, 27). On 11 October she made her will and in the following month gave all of Leicester's and Warwick's pictures at North Hall to the countess of Huntingdon (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/103, fols. 100'r'-103'r'). Her fee simple lands she left to her beloved brother William, who was also her executor. The remaining Dudley lands went to her nephew, Sidney. She died at North Hall on 9 February 1604 in the presence of her immediate relatives, having outlived Elizabeth by less than a year. At her own request she was interred with the Russells at Chenies, Buckinghamshire, not with Warwick. An alabaster effigy and altar-tomb of black marble were then erected for her. 
Thanks to the countess's intimacy with Elizabeth her influence was believed to be extensive and much solicited, but owing to the destruction of her papers after her death it can be gauged only from the comments of others. The prevailing impression is of a very effective advocate and medium for submitting petitions and letters, as, for example, John Dee found. Anne Clifford described her as 'a great friend to virtue and helper to many petitioners' (Gilson, 24-5). Both before and after Warwick's death the countess's hand can be found in a wide range of lesser patronage. Best known is her help to various puritan divines, but she was also involved in university and ecclesiastical appointments, wardships, pensions, lawsuits, minor military postings, and land transactions. Whether she gained in any material way from her influence is a moot point. In 1594 Sir Thomas Shirley was quick to dismiss as slander gossip that she had received a share of his purchase of office. Some twenty books were dedicated to her, about half in her widowhood. Quite a few were by men her husband patronized, among them several puritan divines, but in the 1590s the authors were more literary and included Edmund Spenser. Yet there were also limits to her influence. The most extensive series of references to her help comes from the correspondence of Sidney's agent, Rowland Whyte, from 1595 to 1600. If, in Whyte's words, 'she doth labour as if it were for her owne brother for your sake' ('Letters', ed. Collins, 2.74), Sidney used her primarily to lobby for home leave from his command at Flushing. When he wished to pursue offices, she advised him to employ 'a man of greatness and authority' (ibid., 2.122). When her brother William was lord deputy of Ireland from 1594 to 1596, Elizabeth commanded her 'not to meddle in Irish causes' ('Salisbury MSS', 5.481). The countess was undoubtedly one of the pivotal women in Elizabeth's court, but her intimacy with the queen may, in the last resort, have depended on her not overstepping the mark.

Bacon, Francis (1600-1663), politician, was born on 30 January 1600, the fifth son of Edward Bacon (1548/9-1618) ['see under 'Bacon, Sir Nathaniel (1546?-1622)] of Shrubland Hall, Barham, Suffolk, and his wife, Helen (1564-1646), daughter and heir of Thomas Little of Bray, Berkshire. Always somewhat in the shadow of his brother Nathaniel Bacon (bap. 1593, d. 1660), seven years his senior, Francis at least went up to a different Cambridge college, Queens', in 1617 as a fellow-commoner, but in the next year followed Nathaniel at Gray's Inn and was called to the bar eight years later. The brothers jointly presented their famous uncle Francis's works to the library of the inn in 1635, and Cave Beck dedicated his 'Universal Character' to them jointly in 1657. 
On 30 April 1633 Bacon married Katherine (died 1660), daughter of Sir Thomas Wingfield of Letheringham, whose sister was married to William Bloyse, merchant of Ipswich, then newly established at Grundisburgh where the wedding took place. Bacon and Bloyse were lifelong colleagues; indeed Bacon bought Bloyse's house in St Nicholas's parish, Ipswich, about 1650. 
The staunchly protestant Bacons of Shrubland were early supporters of the parliamentary cause. In a letter of April 1640 to John Winthrop, governor of Massachusetts, Bacon regrets having bought an estate from him, for 'if a good change come not by the Parliament I shall wish my money in my purse again and both it and myself with you' ('Winthrop Papers', 4.228). Public life in Ipswich began for him when he was made town counsel and his brother recorder on the same day in 1642; next he became a Suffolk commissioner for assessment, for the sequestration of delinquents, and the levying of money for the war effort in 1643. Then came membership and the rotating chairmanship of the committee for the associated counties, and the hearing of evidence against scandalous ministers. When there were misgivings about the New Model Army in the seven counties, Bacon was a moderating influence. 
In 1646 Bacon was first elected to parliament for Ipswich (Nathaniel representing Cambridge University), and was soon given committee responsibilities. In late 1647 he was one of those working for a peaceful settlement with the king. Secluded from the house at Pride's Purge, he was readmitted in June 1649, but did not sit with the Rump, returning to attend to Suffolk and Ipswich business. When in June 1652 the town invited the celebrated presbyterian preacher Stephen Marshall to take on its preachership, Bacon's entertainment helped secure his assent. 
Nathaniel and Francis represented the town jointly from 1654 to 1660, William Bloyse sitting for the county, and Francis was a master of requests in 1656-9. Perhaps because his enthusiasm for the Commonwealth waned after Oliver Cromwell's death, he was listed as a possible member of a royalist uprising in Suffolk in 1658. Nothing came of this and in May 1660 it was the Bacons and the town clerk who were sent to Whitehall with gifts for the restored monarch; but in the 1660 Convention Francis, still pro-presbyterian, was given a manager, William Ellys. 
Katherine Bacon bore her husband six sons and two daughters between 1634 and 1646, four of the sons dying young. She died at their Kensington house on 23 October 1660 and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields two days later. Bacon, already an ancient and bencher of his inn, was made a reader in 1662. He spent his last month at Grundisburgh where William Bloyse recorded his death on 23 September 1663; taken to London, his remains were interred next to his wife's on the 27th. He left property in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Staffordshire, and had shipping interests which possibly included trade with Danzig; his will provided mainly for his children Francis, Nathaniel, and Katherine.

Knollys, Katherine, Lady Knollys (c.1523-1569), courtier, was undoubtedly the daughter of Mary Boleyn ['see 'Stafford, Mary, (c.1499-1543)], but although she and her brother Henry Carey (later first Baron Hunsdon) were recognized as the children of Mary's first husband William Carey (c.1496-1528), their mother's affair with Henry VIII, between about 1522 and 1525, has always raised questions about the paternity of her children. Henry Carey's date of birth (4 March 1526) suggests that his conception may have postdated the affair; but Katherine was probably the elder of the two and the king's daughter. Her surviving portrait, which was painted early in 1562 and records her age as thirty-eight, suggests a birth date of 1523/4, and this is in keeping with the known facts of her early adulthood. In November 1539 she was appointed a maid of honour to Anne of Cleves, and on 26 April 1540 she married Francis Knollys (1511/12-1596). According to a note in Francis's Latin dictionary their first child, Henry, was born 'the Tuesday before Easter Day [12 April] 1541'. Since maids to an adult queen were usually aged sixteen or more, and marriage at thirteen or less did not usually involve cohabitation, this evidence, too, suggests that Katherine was older than her brother and born before 1525. 
In 1540 an act of parliament assured the newly-weds of their right to inherit the Knollys family manor of Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire. In the following thirteen years, while Francis rose steadily at court (he was knighted in 1547), Katherine bore the first ten of their sixteen children and evidently maintained a close friendship -- one probably begun in childhood -- with Princess Elizabeth, who sent her a farewell letter signed 'cor rotto' ('broken heart') when she and her husband went abroad. Their departure, among the more prominent Marian exiles, has traditionally been dated to 1553 but is more likely to have occurred in spring 1556, possibly as a result of the discovery of the Dudley conspiracy. The following winter Sir Francis, at least, was recorded in Basel, and by June 1557 Katherine and five of their children were with him in Frankfurt am Main. The date of their return to England is uncertain. The initial privy seal warrant of 3 January 1559 appointing Katherine one of the four waged ladies of the bedchamber may have anticipated her arrival, but they were certainly back by 14 January. Although the 'cor rotto' letter may be the only firm surviving evidence of Katherine's earlier relations with Elizabeth, from 1559 it was often noted that Katherine was, in the words of Thomas Newton's verse epitaph on her, 'In favour with our noble queen, above the common sort', possibly reflecting the inadmissible fact that they were half-sisters. 
Lady Knollys retained her post in the bedchamber until she died, despite the needs of her many children and Elizabeth's demanding nature, which made Katherine 'often weep for unkindness' (Knollys, 'Papers', 65). There were compensations. Her children, notably Lettice Dudley, gained places in the household, and her eldest son's wedding in 1565 was honoured with a court tournament. But the queen remained exigent. When Katherine died at Hampton Court Palace Sir Francis was at Bolton Castle supervising the captivity of Mary, queen of Scots. He had repeatedly asked both Elizabeth and Sir William Cecil to let him return, and he fumed at the queen's 'ungrateful denial of my coming to the court this Christmas' (ibid., 60), particularly as Katherine had been ill with a fever. A letter from Cecil assuring him that Katherine was 'well amended' prompted Sir Francis to write to her at the end of December, pouring out his frustrations and suggesting they retire from court and live 'a country poor life' (ibid., 65). But Katherine's recovery was short-lived, for she died barely a fortnight later, on 15 January 1569, 'lying in a princes court... very often visited by her majesty's own comfortable presence' ('Salisbury MSS', 1.400). The queen was so grief-stricken that she became 'forgetful of her own health' (ibid.), and she spent $640 2's'. 11died on a lavish funeral ceremony for Katherine, complete with interment in Westminster Abbey. It was considerably more than Elizabeth paid towards the exequies of the duchess of Suffolk (died 1559) and the countess of Lennox (died 1578), two cousins who shared her descent from Henry VII; and Katherine's funeral furniture was valuable enough to cause a dispute between the abbey and the college of heralds.

Norris, Henry, first Baron Norris (c.1525-1601), courtier and diplomat, was the only son and second child of Henry Norris (b. before 1500, d. 1536) and Mary (died in or before 1530), daughter of Thomas Fiennes, eighth Baron Dacre. His father was a gentleman of the privy chamber, groom of the stool and keeper of the privy purse, who in May 1536 was accused of adultery with Anne Boleyn and executed for treason. Before Anne's fall, Norris had been tutored in her household by Nicholas Bourbon, a French evangelical reformer. Thereafter he apparently remained at court as a ward of the king. The act of parliament condemning his father had allowed him to supplicate Henry VIII for the restoration of the family estates. Accordingly, in 1539 all his lands were returned except those which had been forfeited to the crown or were part of his maternal grandmother's estate. In 1544 he was granted new holdings in Southampton, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire, including extensive lands of the former monastery in Reading. 
Under Henry VIII, Norris held minor office at court. In 1544 he was described as the king's servant; he was an official of the royal stable, and may also have been an attendant of Prince Edward. In the next reign he was a gentleman of Edward VI's privy chamber and sat in the parliament of 1547 as MP for Berkshire. In 1553 he was one of the witnesses to Edward's letters patent assigning the throne to Lady Jane Grey. 
By 1544 Norris had married Margery (Margaret) [Margery Norris, Lady Norris (d. 1599)], the younger daughter and coheir of Sir John Williams and Elizabeth Edmonds; Sir John was created Baron Williams of Thame in 1554. This family connection became very important to Norris during the reign of Mary I. A strong partisan of the new queen, Williams acted as the protector and patron of his son-in-law, who had been an adherent of Northumberland and was out of sympathy with Catholicism. In 1553 Norris withdrew from court and retired to Wytham in Berkshire, one of Williams's manors. In 1556 the queen jointly granted the two men monastic land around Little Marlow in Buckinghamshire. Also thanks to Williams, Norris and his wife came to know Princess Elizabeth. As one of the princess's two guardians during her period of house arrest at Woodstock, Williams entertained her more than once at his house at Rycote in Oxfordshire, almost certainly while the Norrises were present. In May 1554 she was royally entertained there when stopping overnight on her way from the Tower to Woodstock. There is some evidence that over the next year, occasional short visits to Williams's house provided some relief from her otherwise isolated existence at Woodstock. In July 1555, on her return to London, she again stopped at Rycote. The memory of these visits and Williams's kindness to her during her period of confinement possibly prompted Elizabeth's warm feelings towards the Norrises at the beginning of her reign. 
Immediately on her accession, Elizabeth removed the restrictions on Norris's inheritance. He inherited further landholdings in Berkshire and Oxfordshire on the deaths of his father-in-law and of his uncle Sir John Norris; with Williams's decease in 1559 he and his wife took possession of the family's primary seat at Rycote, Oxfordshire; and in 1565 he secured Yattendon, his uncle's property in Berkshire. His influence in these two counties proceeded apace: from 1559 he was JP for Berkshire, and for Oxfordshire from at least 1562. 
Between 1563 and 1565 the Norrises spent much time at court. Although Margery was not appointed to the privy chamber, she was an intimate of the queen with the nickname Crow because of her dark complexion. In 1560 she was the chief mourner at the funeral of Lady Amy Dudley, probably because of her rank in the county of Oxfordshire where the death occurred. In September 1562 Norris had his first diplomatic experience when he was sent as special envoy to Paris, apparently with instructions to protest at the persecution of the Huguenots. In November 1565 he participated in a tournament in the queen's presence on the occasion of the marriage of the earl of Warwick. In September 1566 he was knighted when the queen visited him at Rycote on her return to London from Oxford. It has been suggested that his elevation was a preliminary to his appointment soon afterwards as ambassador to France. 
Norris arrived in France in January 1567, and lived with his family outside Paris in a house chosen for its suitability to receive visitors without observation. His messages home were full of rumours of international conspiracies as well as detailed description of the military manoeuvres of both sides in the second and third French civil wars. He took the lead in requesting the return of Calais in the spring of 1567 in accordance with the treaty of Cateau Cambresis -- a request that was quickly rebuffed by the French. Besides writing regularly to the queen, Cecil, and Leicester (through whose influence he had probably secured the position of ambassador), Norris's recipients included Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Pembroke, and Sir Walter Mildmay. One of his informants was Daniel Rogers, the son of the first Marian martyr. Norris was impressed with Rogers's lineage and learning, and appointed him tutor to his children as well as steward and secretary in his household. Another of his secretaries was Edmund Mather who came under suspicion of treason in 1571. 
Norris found his stay in Paris difficult. Cecil criticized him for exceeding his allowances in the pursuit of low value intelligence. Elizabeth chided him for being 'somewhat too partial' towards the prince of Conde, especially in exaggerating his successes in the military conflicts ('CSP for.', '1566-8', 401). The French royal family did not trust him because of his sympathy for the Huguenots and consequently his post was seized on several occasions, his servants were arrested, and attempts were made to search his house. Worn down by these indignities and wanting to return to England where he faced several legal suits, Norris requested a recall in the spring and summer of 1569, or at the very least the return of his wife and family, but he had to wait until December 1570 before Francis Walsingham arrived in France as his successor. 
After his return home in March 1571, Norris sat as MP for Oxfordshire in the parliament which opened on 2 April 1571. There he spoke on the 'Bill to Preserve the Queen's Safety' and served on various committees. In May 1572 he was called to the House of Lords as Baron Norris of Rycote. In February 1576 he petitioned parliament for his restoration in blood and honours, and an act was passed to this effect. In 1585 a statute went through parliament to settle a lengthy law suit with Lord and Lady Dacres. 
After 1572 Norris carried out a few ceremonial duties for the queen and gave her advice on martial matters. In November 1581 he participated in the trial of Lord Vaux (for harbouring Edmund Campion), and in April 1589 was summoned to hear the trial of Philip, earl of Arundel. For the most part, however, Norris served Elizabeth at a local level. From 1578 he was the keeper of the armoury and porter of the outer gate of Windsor Castle. He probably became high steward of Abingdon on Leicester's death, though the evidence is not clear, and definitely succeeded the earl as high steward of Wallingford in 1588. In July 1588 he was appointed captain of the light horse in the queen's bodyguard. He acted as joint lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire and Berkshire between 1585 and 1599 (an office shared with first Sir Francis and then Sir William Knollys). In this post, he was responsible for home defence and for mustering men for service abroad during the Spanish war. Although Sir Robert Naunton suggested that Norris competed aggressively with the Knollys family for local influence, later historians believed the factional conflict had been exaggerated and point to evidence of co-operation between them over parliamentary patronage and the protection of puritans. 
In 1586, while carrying out his duty as a leading magistrate, Norris was physically attacked by a group of students from Magdalen College, Oxford, after their peers had been imprisoned for poaching royal deer. In 1596 his house was targeted for attack by a group of Oxfordshire men planning a rising against enclosures. They had heard that the house was full of munitions and timed their action for St Hugh's day, when most of the local gentry would be in London to celebrate Elizabeth's accession day. The rising, however, proved abortive and Norris was made responsible for interrogating its leaders, one of whom was his own carpenter, Bartholomew Steer. 
From the 1570s onwards the Norrises' six sons fought as soldiers in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. Norris and his wife supported their exploits financially and politically. They sold some of their manors, mortgaged their lands to the queen, and ran into debt to help pay the costs of their sons' martial careers. Both petitioned Burghley on John Norris's behalf, first when he was banished from court in 1587 over his quarrels with Leicester during the Netherlands campaign, and again in 1589 when he was in trouble for his part in the disastrous Portugal campaign. In the 1590s both wrote to Robert Cecil to request their sons' return from Ireland. 
In September 1592 Norris took advantage of the queen's visit to Rycote to present his children in a favourable light. In a courtly pastime, Elizabeth was offered gifts, ostensibly from a messenger sent by four of Norris's five surviving sons who were then serving her abroad. Each gift was an expensive token designed to remind the queen of their individual military service. In addition, Elizabeth was presented with a jewelled daisy supposedly sent by Norris's daughter Catherine who was married to Sir Anthony Poulett, governor of Jersey. Norris's sons tried in their turn to promote their father but without success. In September 1585 John suggested him as governor of Flushing, and in October 1598 Edward Norris reminded Essex of his 'promise touching my aged father when any councillors shall be named' ('Salisbury MSS', 8.405). All but one of Norris's sons died in royal service abroad: the eldest, William, in Ireland in December 1579; Maximilian in Brittany, 1593; John in Ireland in September 1597; and two years later both Henry and Thomas Norris also died in Ireland. On the death of John, Elizabeth wrote Margery a personal letter of condolence addressed to 'Mine own Crow'. When Henry and Thomas died within weeks of each other in the summer of 1599, she again tried to comfort Margery and immediately relieved Margery's only surviving son, Edward, of his post as governor of Ostend, sending him home to be with his parents. Grief-stricken, Margery died soon afterwards, in December 1599. On her death, a court of wards commission was set up to inquire into her property and Elizabeth wrote off $2000 of debt to relieve Norris. He remained in good health until his death in June 1601. On 5 August he was buried in the chapel at Rycote, having been briefly interred at Englefield church, Berkshire. His heir was his grandson Francis Norris, the son of William.

Sidney, Mary, Lady Sidney (1530x35-1586), courtier, was the eldest daughter of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland (1504-1553), politician, of Halden, Kent, and his wife, Jane Dudley (1508/9-1555) ['see under 'Dudley, John], daughter of Sir Edward Guildford of Halden, Kent, and his first wife, Eleanor. The Dudley genealogies do not supply dates of birth and they separate the five daughters from the eight sons. Mary Dudley may have been born as early as 1530, but equally possibly after Robert Dudley (1532/3-1588). Her brothers included Ambrose Dudley, Henry Dudley ['see under 'Dudley, John], and Guildford Dudley. No details of her education are known, but she is said to have had an understanding of French, Latin, and Italian. Her intellectual interests included romances (Geoffrey Fenton dedicated his 'Certaine Tragicall Discourses' to her in 1567), versifying, and alchemy. 
Mary Dudley married Henry Sidney (1529-1586), courtier, of London, first son of Sir William Sidney ['see under 'Sidney, Henry], and his wife, Anne. The marriage took place at Esher, Surrey, on 29 March 1551, a ceremony repeated publicly at Ely House, London, on 17 May. Sidney was a gentleman of the privy chamber in Edward VI's household; he was knighted in October that year. It is not impossible that like that of her brother Robert, Mary's marriage was a romantic one, and it was certainly highly compatible. The surviving Sidney papers contain a wealth of personal information about her, including a record of the births of most of her children in the family psalter, but unlike her children neither she nor her husband has yet received a full biographical treatment. 
Both were members of the court at Edward's death (Mary Sidney apparently brought the news to Lady Jane Grey that she was to be queen), and the disaster attending her father, now duke of Northumberland, in July 1553 placed them in an extremely difficult position. Like the rest of Northumberland's children she was included in his attainder. Sidney himself had been with Northumberland at Cambridge, but he was able to make his peace with Mary I quickly, thanks in part to three sisters who were members of her household. Nevertheless, he did not sever relations with his wife's family. He served in an embassy to Spain in the spring of 1554 partly to secure the release of his brothers-in-law from the Tower of London. Mary Sidney's brother John Dudley, Viscount Lisle and earl of Warwick ['see under 'Dudley, John (1504-1553)], died at Penshurst on his release in October 1554. Her first child, Philip Sidney (1554-1586), born on 30 November, was given a significant combination of godparents: Philip II and the dowager duchess of Northumberland. When the duchess died in January 1555, Sidney was the executor of her will. 
Mary Sidney accompanied her husband when he went to Ireland as vice-treasurer in 1556. It was about this time that her second child, Mary Margaret (died 1558), was born. She returned to England in September 1558, having benefited from the repeal of the Dudley attainder (4 & 5 Philip and Mary c. 12) passed earlier in the year. In January 1559 she was appointed a gentlewoman 'without wages' of Elizabeth I's privy chamber (TNA: PRO, LC 2/4/3/104), and thereafter, like her brothers, was at the centre of the new court. In the autumn of 1559 the queen employed her to tell the imperial ambassador that Charles von Habsburg, archduke of Styria, should visit her immediately. When Elizabeth later hedged the proposal with a number of qualifications, Mary Sidney claimed that the queen and her brother had exploited her. 
Sidney returned from Ireland at the end of 1559. Mary Sidney's service at court was thereafter shaped by the demands of her family and her husband's public career (in particular his appointment as lord president of the council in the marches of Wales in 1560 and then his three postings as lord deputy of Ireland). In October 1560 she used Robert Dudley's house at Kew for the birth of her third child, her daughter Elizabeth (who died in Dublin in 1567). In 1561 she accompanied her husband to the marches, and her fourth child, Mary (1561-1621) ['see 'Herbert, Mary], the future countess of Pembroke, was born on 27 October at Tickenhall, Worcestershire. Her most dramatic if unfortunate service in the privy chamber occurred in October 1562 when she nursed Elizabeth through her near-fatal attack of smallpox. Sidney's account of the effect on their lives in his 'Memoir of services' in March 1583 deserves quotation in full. It follows his complaints about the queen's failure to reward his manifold services and her claims that he was living too extravagantly: 'I spend above xxxli a weke, here some will object that I upon the same kepe my wief and her followers. True it is she is now with me and hath ben this half yere and before not in many yeres and if both she and I had our foode and house roome free as we have not in conscience, we have deserved it. For my parte I am not idle but every daye I work in my function and she for her ould service and marks (yet remaining in her face) taken in the same meriteth her meat. When I went to Newhaven [Le Havre] I lefte her a full faire Ladye in myne eye at least the fayerest, and when I retorned I found her as fowle a ladie as the smale pox could make her, which she did take by contynuall attendance of her majesties most precious person (sicke of the same disease) the skarres of which (to her resolute discomforte) ever syns hath don and doth remayne in her face, so as she lyveth solitairilie 'sicut Nicticorax in domicilio suo' ['like a night-raven in the house', Psalm 102, verse 6] more to my charge then if we had boorded together as we did before that evill accident happened. (TNA: PRO, SP 12/159, fol. 38'r'- 'v')' There is no evidence to support claims that Mary Sidney only appeared in public afterwards in a mask. This seems to have originated in a comment by Sir Fulk Greville that 'she chose rather to hide herself from the curious eyes of a delicate time than to come upon the stage of the world with any manner of disparagement' (Hay, 18). Neither her court service nor their married life came to an end in 1562 as Sidney seems to imply; he often wrote in an exaggerated manner and this is no exception. Robert Sidney (1563-1626) was born at Penshurst on 19 November 1563 and Ambrosia (died 1575) was born in 1564 or 1565. Mary Sidney accompanied her husband to Dublin at the end of 1565 when he took up his first lord deputyship, losing her 'whole apparail and all her jewels' when one of their ships was wrecked on the voyage over (TNA: PRO, SP 15/12/245). In 1567 she succumbed to the strains of the criticisms of him, 'as she fell greveously sick upon the same and in that sicknes remayned ones in traunce above fifty-two houres, upon whose recoverie I sent her into England' (TNA: PRO, SP 12/159, fol. 38'r'- 'v'). 
Mary Sidney did not accompany her husband to Ireland for his second lord deputyship at the end of 1568, thanks probably to her pregnancy with her last child, Thomas (1569-1595), who was born on 25 March 1569. Sidney expected her and their son Philip to join him in 1570 but he was recalled in March 1571 instead. After his second recall he spent most of his time in Wales and she at court, and this seems to have been the period when they lived apart most extensively. Thanks to her unwaged status in the privy chamber, Mary was dependent on annual stipends from her husband. More of her correspondence survives from this period than for any other and, like her husband's, it has a definitely querulous tone. Both complained increasingly of ill health and of Elizabeth's failure to reward their various services. In May 1572 Mary Sidney interceded with William Cecil, Baron Burghley, lord treasurer, to have the promised offer of a barony to Sidney withdrawn if it was not accompanied by an increase in his estate. Accommodation at court was another issue, over which she appears to have gone on a virtual strike in 1574, by refusing to attend if she did not retain the chambers she had come to regard as hers. There has been a temptation to interpret this incident as a form of political harassment by the new lord chamberlain, her brother-in-law, Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex. But if Sussex displayed a certain officiousness on taking up a new post, the Sidneys' well-cultivated sense of injustice was undoubtedly a factor. 
After the death of Ambrosia at Ludlow, Shropshire, in February 1575, Sidney received one of Elizabeth's famous letters of condolence and an invitation to send young Mary to court as a maid of honour. The family as a group joined the progress to Kenilworth in 1575, where Lady Sidney killed a buck. It was from Kenilworth that Sidney departed on what became his last lord deputyship, but this time there appears to have been no question of his wife's accompanying him. In the spring of 1577 she was superintending the arrangements for Mary's wedding to Henry Herbert, second earl of Pembroke, probably at Penshurst. Her court career came to an end some eighteen months later. On 6 July 1579 Don Bernardino de Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador, reported that a sister of the earl of Leicester (Robert Dudley), of whom the queen was very fond and to whom she had given rooms at court, had retired to her own house. Ill health was probably the cause, although by 1582 she had joined her husband at Ludlow. In March 1583 Sidney alluded to the possibility that he could remarry and have a second family as his wife was not 'so healthie'. As it transpired, his health gave out first and he died on 5 May 1586; but although she attended his funeral at Penshurst in June Mary did not survive him for very long (Coll. Arms, Dethick's book, fols. 1-2). She died on 9 August, possibly at her son Philip's lodgings in Walsingham House, London, and was then buried with full dignities in her husband's tomb at Penshurst. 
The Sidneys were in some respects the golden couple of the court in the early years of Elizabeth's reign. But from the end of the 1560s they became increasingly embittered by what they regarded as shabby treatment at the queen's hands. The extent to which they were justified is still debated. The nature of their relations with Elizabeth in the later years is best expressed in a letter of Mary Sidney's, written during the course of the dispute over accommodation in 1574: 'old Lord Harry and his old Moll [probably Elizabeth's nicknames for them] will do as well as the[y] can in [accepting?] lyck good friends the small portion alotted our long servis in Courght; which as lyttle as hit is, seams somethynge to mooche' (Collins, 1.272).

Carter, Samuel (bap. 1641, d. 1713), law reporter and legal writer, was baptized at St Martin's, Birmingham, on 5 August 1641, the son of Thomas Carter and Margaret Ailesbury. He was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 26 May 1657, graduating BA in 1660-61. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1665 and called to the bar on 23 November 1673. 
Carter's main activity appears to have been the research and publication of legal texts. In 1688 he published some law reports relating to the reign of Charles II. His next work appears to have been published in 1701: 'Lex custumaria, or, A Treatise of Copy-Hold Estates'. In keeping with this kind of work, in 1706 he published 'The Law of Executions'. 
No doubt Carter's legal researches were facilitated by his appointment on 4 June 1709 as 'library keeper' at the Inner Temple at a salary of $20 p.a., his son, Thomas, providing the surety. In 1710 he published 'Legal Provisions for the Poor, or, A Treatise of Common and Statute Laws Concerning the Poor', which proved sufficiently popular to run to a fifth edition in 1725. Finally, he published 'Lex vadiorum: the Law of Mortgages', a second edition of which appeared in 1728. 
Carter was buried on 8 March 1713 in the Temple Church. His will appears to have been proved by his sister Mary Lostin in October 1713.

Gorges, Helena, Lady Gorges (1548-1635), courtier, was born in 1548 in Sweden, the daughter of Ulf Henriksson (died 1560x68), a nobleman of Ostergotland, and his wife, Agneta Knuttson (died after 1568). Helena (Elin) had two brothers and several sisters. Her father was a supporter of Gustav Vasa, king of Sweden, and came from the old noble family of Baat, while her mother was a descendant of the jarls or earls of Orkney. The name Snakenborg was taken from her mother's family, which was originally from Mecklenburg. 
Helena was one of six young Swedish girls appointed from 1564 to 1566 as maids of honour to Princess Cecilia, margravine of Baden, daughter of Gustav Vasa. Late in 1564, when she was fifteen, they embarked on a voyage to England. It was rumoured that Cecilia decided to visit England to revive the suit of her brother Erik XIV to marry Elizabeth I, but it is not clear that this was the case. Taking a roundabout route over land and travelling through Poland and Germany, in order to steer clear of hostile countries, the party was so hampered by bad weather that almost a year passed before it reached its destination. 
On its arrival in England many prominent members of the nobility received the party. Helena was by all accounts a beautiful woman, having large brown eyes, red hair, and a perfect pink and white complexion. She caught the attention of William Parr, marquess of Northampton (1513-1571), nobleman and courtier, the third and only surviving son of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal, Westmorland, and his wife, Maud. He soon endeavoured to court her. Northampton presented her with many extravagant gifts such as clothes and jewels, and 'being an impressionable and romantic young girl, Helena was swept off her feet by the experienced older man' (James, 395). Cecilia built up large debts due to a lavish lifestyle and left England in April 1566 in order to escape her creditors. She wanted to take Helena back to Sweden with her; however, her young maid, enjoying life in her new country and becoming close to the marquess, was keen to remain. This wish was granted through Elizabeth's influence. 
Northampton hoped to marry Helena but felt prevented from doing so because, although divorced in 1551, his first wife, Lady Anne Bourchier, was still alive. Elizabeth was fond of Helena and appointed her a maid of honour from about 1567, before promoting her to gentlewoman of her privy chamber -- a highly respected position at the heart of the court in which she was among the queen's most intimate servants and controlled access by the press of courtiers. She was entitled to many privileges, such as her own lodgings at court, servants, and a horse. However, she was not a waged member of the privy chamber and it is not known how regularly she attended court. Bourchier died on 26 January 1571 and Northampton and Helena were finally able to marry in May. The wedding took place in Elizabeth's presence in the queen's closet at Whitehall Palace. The bride was twenty-two and the groom fifty-seven. They seemed happy together and divided their time between their houses in Guildford, Surrey, and at Stanstead Hall, Essex. The marriage came to a sudden end within a few months when the marquess died on 28 October in Thomas Fisher's house in Warwick. There were no children. The marchioness received a substantial dower of $368 per annum, drawn from her husband's estates in Cumberland. This may have been exchanged for lands worth $400 per annum in Huntingdonshire. 
It was not too long before Helena captivated another admirer, Thomas Gorges ['see below']. The queen was originally in favour of his approaches to Helena but changed her mind and refused to consent to a marriage, perhaps as a result of her notorious sexual jealousy regarding gentlewomen of her privy chamber or because she had strong views on unequal marriages; Helena was a marchioness and Gorges only a gentleman. The couple wed in secret about 1576. When Elizabeth learned of their deceit, Helena was banned from court, although she was later reinstated, possibly with the help of her influential friend Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, the lord chamberlain. The queen warmed to her again and with wholly uncharacteristic generosity granted her manors in Huntingdonshire and Wiltshire. The couple's first child was born in June 1578 and named Elizabeth (1578-1659) after the queen, who was her godmother. Their first son, Francis (died in or before 1599), was probably born in 1579. Gorges was persuaded by his wife to make his property of Longford, Wiltshire, bought after 1573, more appealing by rebuilding it. The mansion had been damaged by fire when he acquired it and a replacement was completed at great expense by 1591, under the final supervision of John Thorpe, since the entrance on its north-east front bears that date. Longford was the model for the 'Castle of Amphialeus' in Sir Philip Sidney's 'Arcadia'. Gorges was knighted in 1586. During this time Helena settled down to raise her family. She had two more daughters, Frances (1580-1649) and Bridget (1584- 'c'.1634), and four more sons, all of whom were knighted: Edward Gorges, first Baron Gorges of Dundalk ('b'. 1582/3, died in or before 1652); Theobald (1583-1647); Robert (1588-1648); and Thomas ('b'. 1589, died after 1624). 
The marchioness was still valued highly by Elizabeth and often acted as her deputy at the baptism of the children of distinguished noblemen, particularly towards the end of the reign, when the queen's health was deteriorating. Helena must have been distressed when Elizabeth, whose friendship and guidance she had known ever since her arrival in England, died in March 1603 and she was the chief mourner in the funeral procession as senior peeress because Arabella Stuart refused to undertake the role. The accession of James VI to the English throne paved the way for the removal of many of Elizabeth's old courtiers and Gorges was demoted. Helena did not retain all her privileges but was probably glad to escape the rivalry that existed among the gentlewomen of the privy chamber to Anne of Denmark. After Gorges died on 30 March 1610 at the age of seventy-four, Helena increasingly retreated from public life, although she remained a devoted member of the Church of England. Helena died on 10 April 1635 at Redlynch, Somerset, the residence of her son Sir Robert Gorges, and was buried on 14 May in Salisbury Cathedral. She had no fewer than ninety-two direct descendants at the time. She granted over $1700 in annuities and bequests in her will.

Hughes, William (1587/8-1663?), translator and compiler of legal works, was the eldest son of Reginald Hughes (died 1616), a citizen of London and member of the Fishmongers' Company, and his wife, Margaret. Hughes matriculated at St Alban Hall, Oxford, on 18 January 1605, aged seventeen, and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 7 November 1606. There is no date for his call to the bar, but he was made an ancient on 7 June 1627, and on 14 March 1628 his son, also William, was admitted to the inn. 
Hughes was more of a translator and compiler of legal works than a reporter of cases in the strictest sense. His first published work was 'The Parson's Law' (1641). On 25 September 1645 the Stationers' Company records an entry for 'The Mirror of Justice... Translated out of the Old French into English by William Hughes of Gray's Inn'. Other works followed in the 1650s, including 'Reports of Certain Cases... Reviewed... by... Justice Godbolt', published by Hughes in 1652. 'The Commentaries upon Original Writs', which produced the original writs from the books, duly edited, was published in 1655. 'An Exact Abridgement of Public Acts', covering 1640-56, appeared in 1657, and in 1659 he produced 'The Declarations and Other Pleadings' in Coke's reports. 
Hughes continued to publish after the Restoration. 'The Grand Abridgement of the Law Continued', a three-volume collection of the principal case and points of the common law of England, appeared in 1660-63. In 1663 'An Exact Abridgement of All the Statutes in Force', a comparative work of the sixteenth to eighteenth years of Charles I, and the twelfth to fourteenth of Charles II, was published, as was 'Gregories Moot-Book... much Inlarged by William Hughes'. 'An Exact Abridgement in England of the Cases Reported by Sir F. Moore', collected by Hughes, was published in 1665. 
The date of death of William Hughes is unknown, but is conjectured to be 1663.

Stafford, Dorothy, Lady Stafford (1526-1604), courtier, was born on 1 October 1526, one of the seven daughters of Henry Stafford, tenth Baron Stafford (1501-1563), and his wife, Ursula Stafford (d. 1570) ['see under 'Pole, Margaret]. She spent part of her childhood in the household of her aunt Elizabeth Howard, duchess of Norfolk, and in 1545 married her cousin Sir William Stafford (died 1556) of Chebsey, Staffordshire, whose first wife, Mary Boleyn, had died the previous year. While her parents remained loyal to the old church, her husband prospered in the court of Edward VI and her later association with the future Elizabeth I may have begun then. 
On 29 March 1555, together with two of their children, Elizabeth and Edward Stafford, and their cousin, Elizabeth Sandys, Dorothy Stafford and her husband took up residence in Geneva. Elizabeth Sandys had been a long-serving member of Elizabeth's household until Mary ordered her removal for her strong protestantism in 1554. They all joined the English church at Geneva after it was founded on 13 October 1556, and there another son, John, was baptized on 4 January 1556 with John Calvin serving as his godfather. Sir William died several months later and was buried on 5 May 1556. Lady Dorothy never remarried, but six children are commemorated on her funeral monument, three boys and three girls. The third son was William Stafford, later involved in a conspiracy to prevent the execution of the queen of Scots in January 1587, but her other two daughters may have died in infancy. Following a dispute with Calvin over the custody of John Stafford, Dorothy left Geneva with Elizabeth Sandys for Basel, where she was granted burghership on 3 November 1557 and where they lived until 14 January 1559. David Starkey has 'guessed' that Lady Dorothy was the source for their neighbour John Foxe's narrative of Elizabeth's captivity, but Elizabeth Sandys is more likely. What, if any, association she had with the conspiracies involving her brother Thomas Stafford, executed in 1557, and her brother-in-law, Sir Robert Stafford, who helped her in her dispute with Calvin, is a mystery. 
In 1559 Dorothy Stafford and Elizabeth Sandys went to France, where Dorothy claimed to have legal business to resolve, and where they were 'the queen's own gentlewomen' treated to the queen of Scots' 'disdainful speech' during that summer ('CSP foreign, 1558-9', 522). Both returned to England in the autumn and joined the privy chamber soon afterwards, although in Lady Dorothy's case there is conflicting evidence over the date. The cofferer of the household's account records her entering wages on 13 August 1562, although the privy chamber wage list of 1589 dates the warrant to 13 August 1559. The not entirely reliable Sir James Melville of Halhill recorded seeing her during his embassy to Elizabeth in September 1564: '[the queen] caused me to eat with hir dame of honour my Lady Stafford (ane honourable and godly lady, wha had bene at Geneva banissit during the regne of Quene Mary), that I mycht be always neir hir Majestie, that sche mycht confer with me; and My Lady Staffordis dochter [presumably Elizabeth] was my mestres for I was of ther acquaintance when they passit throw France. (Melville, 123)' The Spanish ambassador's description of Dorothy Stafford as mistress of the robes in 1582 may not be entirely accurate, but by then she was undoubtedly one of the most established gentlewomen of the privy chamber. She was also the only waged gentlewoman from the 'old nobility', though her prominence may have been due as much to personality as to rank. She was certainly one of Elizabeth's favourite sleeping companions. In October 1576 she broke her leg in a riding accident, and Mary Scudamore had to be recalled from holiday to replace her so that Elizabeth could sleep peacefully. She and Elizabeth suffered simultaneous nightmares over the execution of Mary, queen of Scots, in 1587. She was active in numerous minor acts of patronage, though not as a protector of the godly, possibly a result of her disillusion with Calvin. 
Dorothy Stafford's children were undoubted beneficiaries of their mother's closeness to the queen. Her daughter Elizabeth (who may have been Elizabeth's goddaughter) joined her in the privy chamber on 28 November 1568, serving as a chamberer until her own death in 1599. When Elizabeth's first husband, Sir William Drury of Hawsted, Suffolk, was killed in a duel in 1590, she received one of the queen's more famous letters of condolence. But the political waywardness of Dorothy's sons Edward and William, both of whom flirted with treason, may have put their mother's influence severely to the test. She did not attend Elizabeth's funeral, possibly because of ill health, and died in September 1604. She was buried in St Margaret's, Westminster, where her funeral monument, recording that she had served Elizabeth for forty years, 'lying in the bed chamber', was erected in the nave just below that of Blanche Parry.

Nevill, Sir Edward (d. 1705), judge, was the second of the three sons (there were at least three daughters) of Henry Nevill of Bathwick in Somerset. Admitted to Gray's Inn in 1650, he was called to the bar in 1658, and became an ancient of that inn in 1676. By the mid-1670s he had embarked upon a career of loyal service and advancement under the Stuarts. The king appointed him deputy lieutenant of Nottinghamshire on 28 July 1675, on the recommendation of the earl of Ogle. He was knighted in June 1681 on the occasion of an address he delivered to the king in his capacity as the recorder of Bath. Nevill was created serjeant-at-law on 21 January 1685, and James II appointed him king's serjeant upon his accession later that year. On 11 October 1685 James further promoted him to the position of baron of the exchequer. 
Nevill was dismissed from this position on 21 April 1686 for refusing to uphold James's broad interpretation of the dispensing power. When the Convention Parliament of 1689 asked him to describe the circumstances of his dismissal, he stated that the king had sought his opinion on four separate occasions on his claim to have the authority to repeal all penal laws against religious dissenters. In his first three interviews he gave his opinion that the king had no such powers of dispensing, and he maintained this position during his fourth interview despite the chancellor's open threat of dismissal. Nevill received his dismissal eight days later, a casualty of James's purge of the courts. 
Nevill returned to public life during the deliberations of the Convention Parliament in the role of expert legal counsel. On 30 January 1689 he was invited to appear before the House of Lords to give his opinion on the constitutional question of whether there existed an original contract between king and people upon which royal government is based. Like the other judges consulted, Nevill affirmed the existence of an original contract, although there was no mention of it in the law books. In his opinion contracts 'per se' originated in man's first submission to government, a fact not mitigated even by conquest: 'In conquests the government puts the laws upon them [the governed], yet in a little time that becomes an original contract. It must of necessity be implied by the nature of government' ('House of Lords MSS', 2.1689-90). In this way he contributed to the growing consensus that kings held their titles not from God immediately but from God mediately with the community's sanction. 
On 18 March 1689 Nevill was again sworn in as baron of the exchequer under King William's settlement of the courts. His patent was renewed on 20 April 1689, changing the condition of his tenure from the king's pleasure to good behaviour. Thereafter all barons of the exchequer held their office on condition of good behaviour. On 30 October 1691 he was translated from the exchequer to the court of common pleas, where he took his place above justices Rokeby and Powell due to his seniority in the bench. Nevill continued in this position under Queen Anne, who reappointed him on 23 June 1702. During these years he assisted in several of the state trials, where he 'seems to have acted an honest and independent part on the bench' (Foss, 'Judges', 399). Nevill died on 8 August 1705 and was buried in Hammersmith Chapel, Fulham, Middlesex, on 11 August. His wife, Frances, is named in his will, dated 1 July 1703, but nothing else is known of her; they had no heir.

Bayly, Sir Patrick Uniacke (1914-1998), naval officer, was born on 4 August 1914 at Bayly Farm, Nenagh, co. Tipperary, the second of three sons of Lancelot Francis Sanderson Bayly (1869-1952), artist, and his wife and cousin, Eileen Maude Bayly (1886-1961). He was educated at Aravon, Bray, co. Wicklow, and at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth (1928-31). The family had an association with the navy dating back to Trafalgar, when Midshipman James Bayly was on board HMS 'Euryalus'. Following his sub-lieutenants' courses and time in the cruiser 'Amphion' and the sloop 'Penzance', Bayly was appointed first lieutenant in the river gunboat 'Cicala', joining her at Canton (Guangzhou) during a Japanese air raid on the city in 1938. 
From November 1939 to July 1941, although he lacked the specialist qualification, Bayly was gunnery officer aboard the First World War cruiser 'Durban'. Reports written on him in later years frequently mention his initiative, a quality apparent during his time in 'Durban'. In Singapore during a refit Bayly learned to fly when some Gypsy Moth float-planes in a hangar set him thinking. The three D class cruisers, whose role was to patrol the 4000 miles between Colombo and Taiwan looking for enemy raiders, were hopelessly obsolete. Bayly's suggestion was to remove the midships turret and torpedo tubes and replace them with a Gypsy Moth and a crane, thus vastly increasing their range of observation. This novel and quite practical idea was not taken up. 
Sent to Scotland to train beach landing parties in 1942, Bayly was flown to north Africa in June 1943 as an emergency replacement for a sick principal beachmaster. He was promoted acting lieutenant-commander and appointed commanding officer of M beach commando (as it was now called). His astute choice of beaches and coolness under fire gained him a DSC and bar in successive landings in Sicily and at Salerno. In the former, Bayly and his team brought the 51st division safely ashore in roughly half of the programmed time. At Salerno the opposition was much stiffer in the face of a well-camouflaged battery of the particularly effective 88 mm. guns. The landing proceeded on schedule. 
Despite the decorations that Bayly won in the summer of 1942, it was perhaps his last such operation, the crossing of the River Volturno under fire that October, that gave him the most satisfaction. Summoned at about twelve hours' notice to prepare a landing for tanks at dawn, the team arrived at the river, which was in spate, with the assault phase in trouble: barely a company was across, instead of a battalion. The army refused them a boat, but they found one abandoned with a rent in the canvas bow. The hole was stuffed with clothing, and with the bow lifted clear of the water by positioning themselves and the equipment in the stern, they paddled across. Uncertain as to the state of the front, Bayly split his team, sending four along the bank while with the other three he swept downstream to the sea before paddling back close to the north shore. Just after they landed on the only suitable beach the other four arrived. Accompanied by a runner, Bayly returned to the brigade headquarters to report, after which he and his group crossed again to the beach. They were under fire both ways from multi-barrelled mortars. The tanks landed at dawn. 
To his surprise Bayly had a virtually untroubled view of the D-day landings from the bridge of the cruiser 'Mauritius', to which he had been appointed first lieutenant in 1944. He left the 'Mauritius' early in 1945 and, having married Third Officer Moira Gourlay (Moy) Jardine ('b'. 1922), of the WRNS, on 4 April, was delighted to be on the Royal Naval Staff College course at Greenwich. Another enjoyable period ashore followed, appropriately enough at the Staff College, Camberley, before Bayly's next appointment saw him in the Mediterranean as staff officer (operations) first in 'Orion' and later in the modernized 'Mauritius', the flagships successively of the 1st cruiser squadron. Frequently involved in the anti-immigration patrols off Palestine, with others of the ship's company he often witnessed harrowing scenes, which he described at some length in an unpublished memoir. 
Promoted commander, in mid-July 1948 Bayly joined the directorate of training and staff duties. His 68-page booklet 'Notes on the Royal Navy' became the 'bible' for the Joint Services Staff College. Other navies also sought it, and by 1954 some 17,000 copies had been printed. Bayly took command in November 1951 of the sloop 'Alacrity', and later of the destroyer 'Constance'. Both saw action in the Korean War, from which he emerged with a second bar to his DSC, together with appointment to the American Legion of Merit. 
On his promotion to captain in 1954 Bayly went to the joint planning staff in the newly created Ministry of Defence. During the Suez crisis of 1956 his paper 'The control of the Nile' demonstrated the futility of a proposed scheme to influence Egyptian policy by controlling the headwaters of the river. To his surprise it was significant enough to be quoted by the prime minister. In the following year, after a truncated spell at the Imperial Defence College, he was appointed to command HMS 'Cavendish' as captain (D), 6th destroyer squadron. This was followed by a more relaxed two years in the NATO headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, and an equally happy period as commodore, chief of staff, to the commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. 
Bayly then got what he said was the best job in the navy: that of flag officer, sea training, with the rank of rear-admiral. On the wall behind his desk was an appropriate quotation from Nelson's letter to St Vincent before the battle of Copenhagen: 'I am brushing these fellows up, they do not have that activity that my mind carries with it'. He was appointed CB in 1965, and his next post was that of admiral president of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Bayly's last post, on promotion to vice-admiral, was in NATO as chief of staff to the commander of naval forces in southern Europe. Appointed KBE in 1968, he retired in 1970. Bayly was the director of the Maritime Trust from 1971 to 1988. He was a trustee of the British Korean Veterans' Association and patron of the Royal Naval Commando Association. For twelve years he was chairman of the governors of the girls' Royal Naval School at Haslemere. 
Pat Bayly was a gentleman of the old school. Although invariably courteous, he was barely tolerant of fools or incompetents. He disclaimed any intellectual pretensions, but was an accomplished watercolourist and could dash off competent verse. He also researched at length the site of St Paul's shipwreck on Malta. His description in his unpublished memoir of the passage down the Volturno under fire, the four men lying back in the stern of the boat to lift its damaged bow clear of the water, 'floating down like the Lady of Shallot', was typical. He had no doubts about the role of luck in a successful career, one of his after-dinner speech topics being called, with typical humility, 'Right place, right time'. 
Sir Patrick Bayly died in Forest Brow residential home for the elderly, 63 Forest Road, Liss, Hampshire, on 1 May 1998, survived by his wife and two daughters. His ashes were buried at sea, off the Nab tower in the Solent, on 28 May 1998.

Jones, Sir Francis Avery (1910-1998), physician and gastroenterologist, was born on 31 May 1910 at 26 Ritson Street, Briton Ferry, Glamorgan, the son of Francis Samuel Jones (1879-1947), a surgeon, and his wife, Marion Rosa, 'nee' Chaston (1875-1967). Both Francis and his brother used Avery as part of their surname. Avery Jones was educated at the Sir John Lemen School, Beccles, and at the medical school of St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He qualified in medicine in 1934 and it was a sign of his distinction at that early period of his career that he was selected as house physician successively to professors Sir Francis Fraser, Leslie Witts, and Ronald Christie -- three of the most distinguished academic physicians of their day. He married, on 1 September that year, Dorothea Bessie (1907-1983), a shorthand and typing teacher, the daughter of Henry Pfirter, a stockbroker; their son, John Francis Avery Jones, was born in 1940. In 1936 he obtained a Baly research scholarship and became assistant to Professor Witts, who was investigating the new technique, introduced by Meulengracht in Denmark, of liberally feeding patients who were bleeding from peptic ulcers instead of starving them. Using blood transfusion he and Witts were able to show that the mortality of the condition, then a common cause of hospitalization, could be dramatically reduced. This early interest in gastroenterology was further stimulated by an invitation in 1937 to attend the foundation meeting of a gastroenterological club, organized by Sir Arthur Hurst of Guy's Hospital, who was a major inspiration to him. The club later became the British Society of Gastroenterology. 
In 1940 Avery Jones was appointed physician to the nutrition department of the Central Middlesex Hospital. Nutrition became one of his abiding concerns. During the war he organized a meals-on-wheels service to the population around his hospital. Together with his colleagues, Horace Joules and Richard Asher, he was determined that hospitals such as the Central Middlesex would play an increasingly important role in the medicine of the metropolis. But it was through his determination and quiet encouragement of gastroenterology at his hospital that he was able to establish a department which became famous worldwide and which attracted students from all over the globe. 
He was particularly adept at the technique of gastroscopy, using the semi-rigid Wolf-Schindler instrument for diagnosis and to observe the progress of healing of peptic ulcers. In 1946, with the return of young and ambitious physicians from the war, Avery Jones was joined by Richard Doll as his research assistant. Together, over the course of more than twenty years, they clearly showed that the bland diets and other now rejected treatments were of no benefit, and that stopping smoking was. At the same time Doll and Avery Jones conducted extensive surveys of peptic ulcer in the community that surrounded them. It was particularly entertaining for Avery Jones, whose natural reserve concealed a twinkling sense of humour, that when they conducted a survey in the nearby Heinz factory, whose well-known trade mark was '57', they found that the incidence of peptic ulcer symptoms was 57 per thousand. 
With the establishment in 1948 of the National Health Service (NHS), which Avery Jones strongly supported, his unit became increasingly busy. Nevertheless he was able to produce 'Modern Trends in Gastroenterology' (1952), the first modern textbook on the subject in Britain. Soon afterwards he played an important if unobtrusive role in the development of the fibre-optic techniques that were to transform the practice of gastroenterology during his lifetime. In 1954 Harold Hopkins, of Imperial College in London, together with his student Kapany, published their epoch making paper describing their construction of a flexible fibre-optic bundle which would transmit light and enable an image to be defined. Hopkins was always disappointed that his paper made so little impact on the medical profession. One of those, however, who at once recognized the importance of Hopkins's discovery for the investigation of the alimentary tract was Avery Jones, who immediately asked a young South African research fellow, Dr Basil Hirschowitz, to explore the possibility of using fibre optics in gastroscopy. No British firms, however, were interested, and Hirschowitz went to the United States, where he successfully developed an instrument that could not only be used to see the stomach but could also be introduced into the duodenum. This achievement was at once taken up by Japanese academics and commercial firms, bringing about a revolution in gastroenterology as almost the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract could be seen directly. 
By now Avery Jones had established a remarkable department at the Central Middlesex to which all aspiring gastroenterologists came. He had also developed a highly successful private practice and so gave his expertise not only to individuals in Britain but increasingly to those from overseas. In this way his experience of his subject became unique there. Always quiet and patient, often working long hours which might bring him to the patient's bedside late at night, he would write his highly valued opinion in a characteristically scratchy hand. He became increasingly in demand not only as an expert diagnostician but also as a humane and caring physician. 
During those years the elite London teaching hospitals paid little attention to gastroenterology, then not recognized as a speciality. It was Avery Jones at the Central Middlesex Hospital who provided the facilities for studies of gastrointestinal disease and teaching in the capital. By 1957 -- supported by the Nuffield Foundation, the Medical Research Council, and the hospital authorities -- he had established a well-equipped unit with facilities for radiological investigation and screening. At the same time the Medical Research Council, which had sponsored and published much of the work of Avery Jones and Doll, was increasingly interested in supporting a centre where there was an abundance of clinical material and where a physiological approach to the study of human disease could be adopted. The unit was established alongside Avery Jones's department in 1960 under the direction of Tom Rowlands. The proposal had been strongly supported by Sir Harold Himsworth, the charismatic secretary of the Medical Research Council. The research unit played an important role in adding research training to the clinical experience of the Central Middlesex. 
Avery Jones himself was increasingly in demand. In 1950 he had become civil consulting gastroenterologist to the Royal Navy. He also provided a consultant service to the Postgraduate Medical School of London at Hammersmith and served as a physician to St Mark's Hospital, then orientated particularly to the surgery of the bowel. He always encouraged the closest co-operation between physicians and surgeons, and it was fitting that he became one of those rare physicians to be awarded the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons. 
Avery Jones had a finely honed social conscience. He was the first to try and persuade the Royal College of Physicians to take action on the hazards of smoking. Having Richard Doll, co-discoverer with Professor Austin Bradford Hill of the dangers of the cigarette, working with him on his unit, he knew all too well the dangers of a habit which since he qualified in medicine had caused the death rate from cancer of the lung to rise from 3000 to nearly 17,000 a year. He had also persuaded a colleague, the chain-smoking Horace Joules, to abandon his pernicious habit overnight. In 1956, deeply concerned by the rising number of patients with cancer of the lung, he wrote to Lord Brain, then president of the college, to express his misgivings and ask that the college should put out a statement. Brain, however, replied that enough had already been said and that the college should play no part in advising the public. This response from a member of the specialist London elite of the teaching hospitals to a physician from a district hospital on the outskirts of London, was symptomatic of the time. It was not until Brain retired the next year that the new president, Robert Platt, established a committee on smoking and health, of which Avery Jones became a member. The committee published its epoch making report on the hazards of smoking in 1962, a major contribution to the public health. 
Throughout his career Avery Jones was devoted to improving the structure of the National Health Service. He was chairman of the king's fund committee on catering and diet in hospitals and he chaired the King Edward VII Hospital fund development and emergency bed service committee, as well as the Department of Health's advisory committee on medical records. He always maintained his interest in nutrition. He had a deep interest in the dietary fibre controversy, when it was suggested that the lack of undigested material in the digestive tract might lead to all manner of illnesses. He was a member of the British Nutrition Foundation and the first chairman of the Royal Society of Medicine's forum on food and health. 
Avery Jones was increasingly involved in medical education. He served on the medical subcommittee of the University Grants Committee, was a member of the council of the University of Surrey and a governor of his old medical school, St Bartholomew's medical school, an appointment which particularly delighted him. He was a devoted member of the British Society of Gastroenterology, which developed from the club whose inaugural meeting he had attended in 1937 at the age of twenty-six. He became president in 1966. He had founded the journal of the society in 1960 and was an early editor. He called it 'Gut', a characteristically straightforward choice which sometimes caused amusement among German colleagues. As Avery Jones had foreseen the journal, starting as a relative unknown in the world of medical publishing, met a need both in Britain and in the wider world, for it soon established an international reputation as its circulation climbed. Avery Jones was committed to 'Gut''s remaining a clinical rather than coldly scientific journal. He wanted to see it on physicians' desks. Asked in later years how he accounted for its remarkable success, Avery replied: 'If I see the word rat or dog in the title, I cross it out'. 
Avery Jones received many national and international distinctions. He gave the first memorial lecture of the American Gastroenterological Association, was vice-president of the World Organization of Gastroenterology, and was the first medallist of a distinguished American honour, the Bockus medal. He received the CBE in 1967 and a knighthood in 1970. 
After retirement Avery Jones maintained a keen interest in medicine, nutrition, and the NHS. An inveterate addict of the telephone, his many friends and pupils welcomed his continued interest and encouragement in later life. Shortly after the death of his wife Avery Jones married, on 4 August 1983, Kathleen Joan Edmunds, a retired nursing sister. At their home, 19 Peter Weston Place, Chichester, Sussex, he developed a remarkable herb garden, which included a collection of medicinal herbs. As the years passed he became increasingly frail. Nevertheless in 1997, the year before he died, he was able, though confined to a wheelchair, to attend the diamond jubilee of the British Society of Gastroenterology, and there he heard the lecture named in his honour. His own career had spanned the entire life of that society, which reflected the events of his own life. Much of what Avery Jones did was done unobtrusively behind the scenes, quietly and without fuss. But his major personal achievement was that from humble beginnings in a relatively unknown west London hospital, he became one of the leading and most influential physicians of his era. He died on 30 April 1998 at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, and was cremated at Chichester a week later.

Raphael, Ralph Alexander (1921-1998), organic chemist, was born on 1 January 1921 in Croydon, Surrey, the only son and eldest of four children of Jacob (Jack) Raphael (1889-1978), a master tailor, and his wife, Lily, 'nee' Woolf (1892-1956). His father, whose family moved to Britain from Poland towards the end of the nineteenth century, was a moderately Orthodox Jew who found it difficult to stay in steady work during the depression, so Raphael's early schooling was disjointed, and included spells at schools in Leeds, Sunderland, and Dublin, as well as in London. His talent for science and mathematics having been discovered and nurtured at Tottenham county school (1936-9), he studied chemistry at Imperial College, graduating from the wartime two-year course in 1941 with first class honours and the Hofmann prize for practical chemistry. Under E. R. H. (Ewart) Jones's supervision he completed a brilliantly successful two-year PhD thesis, which fired his lifelong enthusiasm for the chemistry of acetylenes. In 1943 he was sent to May and Baker Ltd under wartime government direction to work on the newly discovered antibiotic penicillin. On 23 May 1944 he married Prudence Marguerite Anne Gaffikin ('b'. 1922), a violinist, and daughter of Colonel Dr P. J. Gaffikin, medical officer of health for Maidstone; they remained happily together for the rest of his life and had two children, Richard Anthony 
(Tony; 'b'. 1945)
, later a research chemist, and Sonia Elizabeth ('b'. 1952), later a schoolteacher. Raphael turned away from religion entirely in 1941. 
Raphael returned to Imperial College in 1946 as an ICI research fellow. His imaginative research on the applications of acetylenes in organic synthesis was recognized in 1948 by the award of the Meldola medal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry. He was appointed lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 1949, and then moved in 1954 to become the first professor of organic chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast, where he built up a successful new department and published an influential monograph, 'Acetylenic Compounds in Organic Synthesis' (1955). He was called back to Glasgow in 1957 to be regius professor of chemistry, a post he held until moving to Cambridge in 1972. 
Raphael's tenure in Glasgow saw the greatest blossoming of his scientific work, including pioneering syntheses of shikimic acid (an important intermediate in amino acid biosynthesis), queen bee substance (a key insect pheromone), and chrysanthemic acid (a component of natural insecticides). In recognition of his contributions he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1958 and of the Royal Society in 1962, and was awarded the Chemical Society's Tilden medal in 1960. He was a popular teacher and an inspiring research supervisor, his period at Glasgow producing a generation of outstanding organic chemists including both academics (including J. R. Maxwell FRS, R. Ramage FRS, A. I. Scott FRS, and W. Parker, who died prematurely) and pharmaceutical company executives (including P. Doyle and T. McKillop, both of ICI/Zeneca). He was also a highly effective collaborator, notably with Geoffrey Eglinton in devising applications for gas-liquid chromatography. 
In 1972 Raphael was elected 1702 professor of organic chemistry at Cambridge, as successor to Lord Todd. This position carried with it the headship of the department of organic, inorganic, and theoretical chemistry; the separate department of physical chemistry shared the same building and facilities, an arrangement which did not always lead to comfortable relationships between the two departments. At Cambridge, Raphael continued to produce a stream of innovative and elegant natural product syntheses, including virantmycin (an antiviral compound), aaptamine (an greekLetteralpha-adrenoceptor blocker), and steganacin (an anti-leukaemic). He received the Pedler medal of the Chemical Society in 1973, its Ciba-Geigy award in 1975, and the Davy medal of the Royal Society in 1981, and was appointed CBE in 1982. He also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Stirling and East Anglia (both 1982), and from Queen's University, Belfast (1989). He became a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1972, and was elected an honorary fellow on his retirement in 1988. Above all he valued his fellowship of Imperial College, awarded in 1991. 
As head of department Raphael encouraged his younger staff to explore new and unconventional areas of science. He defined his success not in selfish terms of his own scientific or monetary triumphs, but through the collective achievements of his department, and he took great pleasure in the success of some of those he had appointed, particularly A. B. Holmes FRS, J. K. M. Sanders FRS, and C. Abell. His style did not sit easily with the accountancy-led world of the 1980s: he saw the university as publicly funded for the benefit of the country, and he gave his scientific advice freely. Within the department and elsewhere he was a popular and avuncular figure, always available for constructive advice or an amusing but relevant anecdote. 
Although most of his research fell within the conventional boundaries of organic chemistry, Raphael's broader interests, particularly in music, were displayed in some of his more unusual research papers, and he collaborated with David Rubio (a Cambridge violin maker) to produce modern preparations that replicated some of the warm tones of the instruments of Stradivarius and the Cremona school. He retired in 1988, but retained a lively interest in chemistry, reading the latest papers enthusiastically until a few weeks before his death from ischaemic heart disease at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 27 April 1998. His body was donated to the university's department of anatomy and then cremated, on 1 June 1999. He was survived by his wife and two children.

Cholmondeley, George, second earl of Cholmondeley (c.1666-1733), army officer, brother of Hugh Cholmondeley, first earl, was the second son of Robert Cholmondeley, Viscount Cholmondeley of Kells (died 1681), and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1692), the daughter and coheir of George Cradock of Caverswall Castle. He was educated at Westminster School and entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1680. He became in 1685 a cornet of horse, and in 1686 was promoted captain of the Queen Consort's regiment of horse. In 1688 he joined the northerners who under the earl of Devonshire assembled at Nottingham in support of the prince of Orange. On William's accession he was appointed groom of the bedchamber. He was MP for Newton from 1690 to 1695. As lieutenant-colonel, he commanded the Horse Grenadier Guards in 1690 at the battle of the Boyne, and distinguished himself in 1692 at Steenkerke. He was then promoted colonel of the first troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, with whom he served between 1693 and 1715. Later, on 17 June 1697, he was made brigadier-general of horse. About 1701 he married Elisabeth (died 1722), the daughter of Heer van Ruytenburgh, governor of Sas van Ghent, and his wife, Anna Elisabeth, the daughter of Lewis of Nassau, lord of Auverquerk, field marshal of the forces of the states general; the couple had three sons and three daughters. 
After the accession of Queen Anne, Cholmondeley was, on 1 July 1702, appointed major-general and governor of the forts of Tilbury and Gravesend. On 1 January 1704 he was promoted lieutenant-general of horse. Under George I he continued in his offices, and on 11 February 1715 was made captain and colonel of the third troop of Horse Guards. On 12 April 1715 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Newborough of Newborough, co. Wexford, Ireland, and on 10 July 1716 was created Baron Newburgh in the Isle of Anglesea. On succeeding his brother Hugh as earl of Cholmondeley, on 18 January 1725, he was appointed lord lieutenant of the county and city of Chester and 'custos rotulorum' of the county; he was also lord lieutenant of north Wales. On 25 March 1725 he was appointed governor of the town and port of Kingston upon Hull and on 15 April 1727 general of the horse. In October 1732 he was named governor of the island of Guernsey. He died at Whitehall on 7 May 1733 and was buried at Malpas, Cheshire, where he had lived, on 17 May. 
Cholmondeley was the reputed author of 'Verses and a pastoral spoken by himself and William Savile, second son of George, earl (afterwards marquis) of Halifax, before the duke and duchess of York and Lady Anne, in Oxford Theatre, 21 May 1683', printed in a book entitled 'Examen poeticum' by Jacob Allestry in 1693. According to Wood, Allestry had 'the chief hand in making the verses and pastorals'. Cholmondeley received the degree of DCL at Oxford on 1 November 1695. 
Cholmondeley's second surviving son, James Cholmondeley (1708-1775), was born on 18 April 1708, commissioned in the 2nd troop of Life Guards in 1725, and promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd troop in 1731. In 1741 he was raised to the colonelcy of the 48th regiment of foot, from which he was transferred to the 34th (Cumberland) regiment in 1742. He accompanied the regiment to Flanders in 1744 and was present at Fontenoy in 1745. At the outbreak of the Jacobite rising he returned to England, and as major-general took charge of two battalions brought over from Ireland. On the retreat of the Scottish army from Derby he was attached to General Wade's army and commanded a brigade of infantry at the battle of Falkirk (17 January 1746). It was there that he distinguished himself. When four of the front-line royalist regiments turned and ran, Cholmondeley's brigade stood fast on the right flank and proceeded to pour heavy fire on the advancing Scots, forcing them to retire. Further attempts by Cholmondeley to organize a counter-attack were prevented only by the approach of night and a heavy storm. The stand made by Cholmondeley's brigade prevented the fleeing English troops from being cut to ribbons, turning an abject defeat into a valuable draw; it enabled the royalist army to proceed later to Culloden, where Cholmondeley's regiment formed part of the front rank of Cumberland's army. He provided a detailed description of the battle at Falkirk in a letter to Edward Weston of 21 January 1746. In 1749 he transferred to the 12th dragoons and later that year to the 3rd Irish horse. In 1750 he became colonel of the 6th dragoons and in 1754 was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. For many years he was governor of Chester. He married Penelope, the daughter of James Barry, fourth earl of Barrymore, and died, childless, on 13 October 1775.

Channel, Elinor (fl. 1654), prophetess, of unknown parents, was an inhabitant of Cranleigh, near Guildford in Surrey. By the spring of 1654 she was married to 'a very poor man' and had at least four children, three of whom were very young (Evans, 2). While sleeping, 'a Blow given her upon the heart' woke her up, and 'an audible voice' instructed her to go to London and carry a message to Oliver Cromwell, the lord protector (Evans, 1). 
Channel's experiences in the city resembled the early career of Rhys (or Arise) Evans, into whose care she briefly fell, and who had attempted to issue due warning to Charles I and others in the late 1630s. Despite waiting around Cromwell's court over 17-19 April 1654, Channel gained no access to him, though someone directed her to Evans, who took her oral report and shortly afterwards published it as 'A message from God [by a dumb woman] to his highness the lord protector. Together with a word of advice to the Commons of England and Wales, for the electing of a parliament'. (George Thomason, the bookseller and collector, dated his copy 'July 10'.) Channel's later history is uncertain. Evans reports that a woman, answering her description but now struck dumb, was arrested by beadles and taken to Bridewell, though she was immediately discharged to 'the wanton mad crew, who flocked about her and abused her' (Evans, 6); thereafter, nothing is known (Evans, 1-7). 
Channel's message, of itself enigmatic, is glossed by Evans as an adjuration to Cromwell to facilitate the restoration of Charles II. As such, it accords with the numerous pamphlets Evans wrote in the early 1650s. The second part of the publication is Evans's own address to the English and Welsh electorate, urging them to vote for 'Men of qualitie that stood Neuters' in the conflicts of the civil war in the elections for the parliament that would meet in the autumn of 1654, in that hope that they would endorse his own objectives (Evans, 9). Evans claimed that Channel's prophecy had 'more truth and substance... than in all 'Hana Trampenels' [that is, Anna Trapnel's] songs or sayings' (Evans, 7) though his own brief involvement with her seems opportunistic, politically motivated, and of much less significance than the role Trapnel played in Fifth Monarchism. 
Another royalist prophet, Walter Gostelow, formerly milliner to Charles I, would seem to allude to the Channel episode in the epistle to Oliver Cromwell which prefaces his 'The Coming of God in Mercy, in Vengeance' (1658). He recalls that 'A person well known to your Lordship, E. C.', gave to Cromwell's attendants a paper for his attention and later posted it on the chapel door at Whitehall. He adds the minatory details that, when the paper was thrown into the fire, it set the chimney alight, and that the chapel officer who tore it down from the door subsequently died with a withered hand.

Greswold, Edward (bap. 1594?, d. 1633), religious recluse, was probably baptized on 5 August 1594 at Tanworth, Warwickshire. He was the son of Thomas Greswold (died 1598/9), landowner, and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1645), daughter and heir of Benedict Shuckburgh of Cubbington, Warwickshire. His father, who owned significant property in and around Solihull, died when Greswold was a child and in July 1602 his mother married William Lisle of Evenley, Northamptonshire. Although a younger son, Greswold was apparently well provided for and lived at Cubbington, a manor owned by his mother's family, with his wife, Margaret. They had at least eight children. 
Greswold's career provides an intriguing insight into the puritan community in early Stuart England, and the relationship between godly protestants within the established church and those who rejected this church entirely. It also offers a bizarre illustration of religious extremism before the civil war. His story was recorded by two contemporaries, the puritan minister Samuel Clarke, who found Greswold's actions repugnant, and the royalist gentleman Sir William Dugdale, who related Greswold's story as a curiosity and seemed more concerned with the rightful descent of the Greswold property. Clarke recalled that Greswold was a respected member of the godly community in Warwickshire during the 1620s. About 1629, however, he came into contact with the separatist preacher John Canne, who 'began to seduce him from his former opinions' (Clarke, 112). In later writings Canne published his arguments that Christians should be 'separated from the world, and the false worship and the ways thereof' (Canne). The majority of English puritans rejected this radical view, but it did appeal to a desire among godly protestants to create a church of true Christians untouched by the 'superstitious' habits of the wider world. It appears that Greswold took Canne's ideas about separation from the Church of England to their most extreme conclusion. He decided first that he could not attend the local church, second that he could not listen to any 'conformable minister' and from there 'fell to separation' (Clarke, 112). He eventually came to believe 'that all civil society with others, defiled him' (ibid.), locked himself and his family in his house, and instructed his servants to bring them food through the windows. Local ministers, including Clarke, came to remonstrate with him but were ignored. When one of his children died he placed the body in the next room and later ordered a servant to bring moss which he placed in the cracks between the rooms to stop the smell. This was only discovered when a justice of the peace 'sent some with command to break open his chamber door' (ibid., 113), and Greswold and his family were found 'with their haire, and nailes growne very long, [and] their clothes almost rotten on their backes' (ibid.). 
When released neither Greswold nor his children, 'being so tutored by him' (Clarke, 113), would speak to anyone. His children were sent to friends and eventually recovered but Greswold never wavered from his beliefs. He took to his bed, ignoring all those who came to him and 'intreated, counselled, threatn'd, and prayed' (ibid., 114). He turned his face to the wall and spoke not a word until his death 'which was not long after' (ibid.), in 1633. He was succeeded by his son John, who died in 1640.

Armstrong, Lilias Eveline (1882-1937), phonetician, born on 29 September 1882 at 152 Eccles New Road, Pendlebury, near Manchester, was the daughter of James William Armstrong, Free Methodist church minister, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Armstrong, 'nee' Hunter. On 24 September 1926, at the Hampstead register office, London, she married Simeon Karlovitch Boyanus (1871-1952), who at the time was professor of English philology at the University of Leningrad. It was not until 1934 that Boyanus was permitted by the Soviet authorities to settle permanently in London, where he took up a lectureship in Russian at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies. 
Armstrong graduated in 1908 as BA of the University of Leeds, where she was a king's scholar and where her principal subjects were French and Latin. Her first appointment after graduation was as a teacher of French at the higher elementary school, East Ham, London. She was senior mistress there when she left in 1918 for University College, London, to become full-time assistant to Daniel Jones (1881-1967) in the department of phonetics. In making this move, after having been fired with enthusiasm for phonetics through attending evening classes in the subject at University College, Armstrong left a secure position, from which she could without doubt have expected to acquire a post as headmistress, for a temporary appointment with a lower salary. Her outstanding ability and her personal qualities, however, ensured her success in her new career. She was appointed senior lecturer in 1921 and reader in 1936. 
Jones, while giving strong encouragement to his departmental colleagues to engage in research and publication, laid great stress on the practical side of the discipline. A sensitive ear that allowed a phonetician unerringly to recognize fine distinctions of sound was much prized, as was the ability accurately to reproduce the sounds, in meaningful utterances, of a language under description. To Jones, Armstrong was in these terms 'one of the finest phoneticians in the world' (Jones, 'Lilias Armstrong', 2), and to be taught by her the phonetics of any of the languages she had studied was regarded as a memorable experience. 
The earlier of Armstrong's many publications emphasized the practical aspect of the study, being often intended primarily as an aid to pronouncing correctly the language described. They were, however, firmly based in Jonesian phonological theory and in effect provided an account of the phonemic structure, along with allophonic variations, of the language, though generally without the explicit use of the word 'phoneme'. All the writings of Lilias Armstrong, whatever their intended readership, were characterized by clarity of structure and expression, by comprehensiveness, and by a careful attention to detail. 
For Jones and his colleagues an important tool in learning to pronounce a language well was a set of texts in phonetic transcription. Armstrong was a regular contributor to 'Le Maitre Phonetique', the journal of the International Phonetic Association, and also for some years its assistant editor. A regular section of this periodical was a 'Partie des eleves', which consisted of reading passages of phonetically transcribed material in a variety of languages, often prepared by Armstrong. Her first book, 'An English Phonetic Reader' (1923), was an extended example of this type of work. Two years later she collaborated with Pe Maung Tin to produce a similar work for his language, 'A Burmese Phonetic Reader' (1925). Preceding the transcribed passages in these readers as a standard feature was an account of the phonetic structure of the language. 
Throughout her career Armstrong retained a strong interest in the language that she had taught as a schoolteacher. After conducting classes on its phonetic structure for a number of years, she wrote 'The Phonetics of French: a Practical Handbook' (1932) which, though later superseded largely as a result of changes in the pronunciation of French since its publication, remained a useful work of reference. It is concerned principally with the phonological segments of French and does not deal in detail with intonation. This gap was filled by her co-operation with her colleague Helene Coustenoble (1894-1962) in preparing 'Studies in French Intonation' (1934), a work of theoretical importance as well as practical usefulness. In a similar way Armstrong worked with Ida C. Ward (1880-1950), also a member of her department, on a 'Handbook of English Intonation' (1926). 
Armstrong's research on African languages was intended more for an academic than for a student audience. Her published results include an important article, 'The phonetic structure of Somali' (1934), and a major book, the outcome of three years of research, 'The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu', published posthumously under the editorship of Beatrice Honikman (1940). The appearance of this book made clear the pioneering nature of Armstrong's work on the language, in particular with regard to her analysis of the importance of tonal features in the structure of both nouns and verbs. Her informant for her research on Kikuyu was Jomo Kenyatta (1889-1978), who later became prime minister and president of Kenya. 
Lilias Armstrong died in Finchley Memorial Hospital, Middlesex, on 9 December 1937, following a stroke. This early and unexpected death left colleagues with a certain sense of promise not entirely fulfilled as a writer. Her interest in general phonetic theory led her to study a wide range of very different languages of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and her fascination with the variety of phonetic typology might have considerably expanded her range of publications if her academic career had run its full course.

Henderson, Eugenie Jane Andrina (1914-1989), phonetician and linguistic scholar, was born on 2 October 1914 at Rose Villa, Archbold Terrace, Newcastle upon Tyne, the daughter of William Alexander Cruikshank Henderson, civil engineer, and his wife, Pansy Viola, 'nee' Schurer. The family moved in her early years to London where she went to school, though she continued to claim an ability to speak her original 'Geordie' English. 
After school, Henderson read English at University College, London, and achieved first-class honours. Taking advantage of the provision of phonetics classes there, she attracted the attention of the professor of phonetics, Daniel Jones, who encouraged her to study the phonetics of south-east Asian languages, and appointed her to a junior teaching post in 1938. On 8 January 1941 she married George Meier ('b'. 1913). She was to go on consistently to balance the responsibilities of a family with the demands of her career as a scholar and university teacher with grace and aplomb, and once declared facetiously in an introduction to a public lecture series that her hobby was 'bringing up a family of four sons'. Throughout her lifetime she continued to use her maiden name for professional purposes. 
Like a number of her contemporaries Henderson found the ultimate course of her career partly determined by the entry of Japan into the war at the end of 1941. In view of the urgent needs of the armed services for persons skilled in Japanese, and to a lesser extent in other Eastern languages, the School of Oriental and African Studies in the university became a major training centre in these languages for specific wartime purposes. Much of this work devolved on the department of phonetics and linguistics, headed by J. R. Firth, where Henderson remained until her retirement. 
Henderson was appointed lecturer in phonetics in the department, and her principal work, along with others', was the intensive instruction of naval and air force personnel in service Japanese for various intelligence purposes. At the end of the war, research and teaching provision in oriental languages was greatly increased, following the recommendations of the Scarbrough commission, and she was made a senior lecturer, and subsequently appointed reader (1953) and professor of phonetics from 1964. At the 1982 International Congress of Linguists in Tokyo she read the plenary lecture on phonetics and phonology, subsequently published in the 'Proceedings' (1983). In 1986 she was elected fellow of the British Academy. She did not shirk the administrative duties in scholarship: she was treasurer of the Philological Society from 1966 to 1974 and its president from 1984 to 1988, and she took the chairmanship of the Linguistic Association of Great Britain from 1977 to 1980. 
Although Henderson continued her interest in Japanese she concentrated her attention, but not exclusively, on the languages of south-east Asia. She took responsibility within her own department for the initial training of newly appointed lecturers in specific south-east Asian languages (such as Thai, Vietnamese, and Cambodian) prior to these lecturers' transfer to the south-east Asia department following their initial year of study leave in the countries of their specialization. For a time she was acting head of that department, and later head of the department of phonetics and linguistics. 
Henderson included within her competence experimental phonetics, and her 1970 article on the acoustic features of Kabardian (a central Asian language) has become one of the classics of that branch of phonetics. But the main thrust of her work in phonetics and phonology was made clear in her inaugural lecture, 'The domain of phonetics' (1965), in which she emphasized the importance of the subject, but always and necessarily within the wider context of linguistics as a whole discipline. At the time this stood in contrast to the approach of some traditional phoneticians, for whom syntax and morphology lay rather outside their terms of reference: 'The phonetician cannot close his eyes to grammatical considerations if he wishes to give the most helpful account of the use made of phonic features in a given language' (Henderson, 'Domain', 7). This attitude was exemplified in her work on Tiddim Chin. In 1964 she took part in a joint expedition to Tiddim in the Chin hills of Burma, in her case for fieldwork on the language. Her analysis covered the major levels of linguistics: sentence, phrase, 'figure' (intonation pattern), word classes, the morphological structure of words, and a brief stylistic analysis of two texts. 
Henderson's more specifically phonological works involved the exposition and application of Firth's prosodic phonology to a number of languages. Notable among these are her 'Prosodies in Siamese' (Thai, 1949) and her contribution to the book 'In Memory of J. R. Firth' (1966). Of the former article F. R. Palmer writes in his edited 'Prosodic Phonology' that it is 'the neatest and, in some ways, the most convincing of all the articles written in the prosodic framework' (Palmer, 27). In it she offers an analytical presentation of the interaction of the phonetic features of Thai, segmental and intersegmental, as opposed to a serial phonemic account based on the needs of a broad transcription, itself ultimately based on the letters of the Roman and the Greek alphabets. A more detailed account of Henderson's Thai article appears in Robins (311-12). A full list of her publications may be found in Davidson (5-9). The 'Buey Karen Dictionary', on which she was working before her death, was later completed by Anna Allot and published in 1998. Finally, attention may be drawn to what has turned out to be her most widely read and best-known work, her edition of a volume of extracts from the writings of Henry Sweet, which she entitled 'The Indispensable Foundation' (1971), following the claim by Sweet for his own subject in relation to the entire study of language (p. vii). 
In addition to Henderson's academic achievement and her dedication to her family, she exhibited energy and ability in several fields: she was an accomplished amateur pianist, and for a time she ran a small dairy farm around her house and garden in Hertfordshire ('when I was a cow keeper'), to which her colleagues were regularly invited. This was a particular delight to her many students from south-east Asia who, fresh from reading Wordsworth in English literature classes, were thrilled actually to see in springtime 'A host of golden daffodils... Fluttering and dancing in the breeze'. 
In politics and in social life Henderson maintained a fairly detached pragmatic posture, particularly with regard to the playtime revolutionaries of the 1960s and their more right-wing traditional critics. Challenged in a conversation once on 'principles', she replied 'I do so distrust people who act on principle'. No doubt it was her manifest common sense as well as her academic pre-eminence that led to her being approached by an Oxford college to be its head of house after her retirement, an invitation she declined as she wanted to retain her London home for visits by her sons and their families. 
Eugenie Henderson died suddenly at her home, 9 Briardale Gardens, Camden, London, on 27 July 1989. Following her funeral in Hampstead on 31 July, a memorial service was held in a church near University College and the School of Oriental and African Studies.

Cudlipp, Hubert Kinsman, Baron Cudlipp (1913-1998), journalist and publishing executive, was born at 118 Lisvane Street, Cardiff, on 28 August 1913, the youngest son in the family of three sons and one daughter of William Christopher Cudlipp, commercial traveller for a provision merchant, and his wife, Bessie Amelia, 'nee' Kinsman. Named Hubert on his birth certificate, he decided while still a schoolboy that the name Hugh had a better ring to it, and adopted it for life. He was so successful both in choosing and using this sobriquet that very few of his adult friends ever realized that it was not his actual birth name. 
Along with his two older brothers, Percival Cudlipp and Reginald Cudlipp, both of whom also became Fleet Street editors, Hugh Cudlipp was educated first at Gladstone elementary school and then at Howard Gardens secondary school, both in Cardiff. Leaving school, with relief, at the age of fourteen, he was fortunate enough to follow Reginald onto a local weekly paper, the 'Penarth News', published in a dormitory seaside suburb of Cardiff. It was not in fact much of a job: the paper was run on a shoestring and the two younger Cudlipp brothers comprised its entire editorial staff. They were officially apprentices serving their indentures but, with no premiums being paid, salaries in any normal sense were not either. For years afterwards Hugh Cudlipp kept in his possession a letter recording the arrangement made with his father that he was to be paid 5's'. a week for his first year, 7's'. 6died for his second, and the princely sum of 10's'. for his third. The paper, however, folded well before even the first proposed modest increase could come into effect. Cudlipp found himself equally thwarted in his next job. After the collapse of the 'Penarth News' he secured a junior reporter's post on the second of the two evening papers that Cardiff then boasted, only to see it disappear in a matter of months through a merger with its more prosperous rival. Not yet sixteen, he shrewdly resolved that his journalistic future did not lie in south Wales, and made for Manchester, in those days second only to Fleet Street in terms of newspaper production. 
Cudlipp's career prospered in Manchester. He joined Lord Kemsley's 'Manchester Evening Chronicle' and particularly enjoyed his time as a district reporter working in Blackpool. (He later wrote that he found the experience of observing the British working class on holiday 'more instructive than a year at a university' Cudlipp, 'Walking on the Water', 45.)) He also benefited from a solid grounding in the sub-editor's trade. But, although only nineteen, he already knew enough to realize that he would never achieve his ambitions in journalism unless he went to London. In 1932 he did just that, transferring to Fleet Street and to another Kemsley title, the 'Sunday Chronicle', where he became an astonishingly young features editor. It was in these early days in Fleet Street that he made his first marriage, on 8 April 1936, to Edith Elizabeth Gertrude (Bunny) Parnell, (1912/13-1938), a journalist and daughter of Frederick Robert Parnell, master upholsterer. Ever afterwards he enigmatically referred to her as 'the channel swimmer'. (In truth it was the Bristol, not the English, channel that she had swum -- though as a dutiful fiance he did follow her in a dinghy.) Everything else about this youthful first marriage he tended to keep to himself, perhaps because it failed long before it was formally ended, in 1938, by her death in childbirth (he was not the father of the baby, who also died). 
Cudlipp's decisive career break came just three years after he had arrived in London. He noticed -- and was encouraged by his eldest brother, Percy (already editor of Lord Beaverbrook's 'Evening Standard'), to follow up -- a classified advertisement in the 'Daily Telegraph' for 'a bright assistant features editor with ideas, able to take charge' (Cudlipp, 'Walking on the Water', 49). No indication was given as to the paper concerned and, when Cudlipp learned that it was the then limping tabloid the 'Daily Mirror', he almost withdrew his application. The reluctance, however, on the part of Lord Kemsley to offer him more than a 10's'. a week increase in order to keep him -- 'I would have been prepared to stay for an extra quid' -- made up his mind for him. On 3 August 1935, when not quite twenty-two, he joined the 'Daily Mirror' -- where, with two gaps, he remained for the rest of his active journalistic career. 
Within six months Cudlipp had been promoted to features editor, and two years later, in September 1937, he found himself transferred -- this time as editor -- to the 'Mirror''s stable companion, the 'Sunday Pictorial'. There he formed what was easily the most influential professional association of his life: his alliance with that paper's newly appointed editorial director, Cecil Harmsworth King. It was he who asked Cudlipp to come over from the 'Mirror', thereby earning for both of them the undying enmity of Harry Guy Bartholomew, the 'Mirror''s editorial director. An aloof and taciturn old Wykehamist (who happened, in 'Mirror' terms, to be 'founder's kin': he was nephew to both Northcliffe and Rothermere), King was the polar opposite to Cudlipp. Olympian in his judgements and cold in his manner, King prided himself on being a strategist, once remarking: 'I have a greater gift of foresight than anyone I have ever met' ('Daily Telegraph'). For his part Cudlipp, far more of a natural leader with his dynamic diction and raffish good looks, saw himself simply as a communicator. Between them they created a daring, contemporary version of the 'Sunday Pictorial' based on a dashing use of pictures, modern American-style typography, and, above all, political nous of an entirely new kind in a popular paper. The paper's always trenchant anti-appeasement articles were written by Cudlipp himself under the pseudonym of Charles Wilberforce, a device that enabled him to combine his gift for invective with King's knowledge of the workings of the political system. 
The editor's chair of the 'Sunday Pictorial' proved the only one that Cudlipp ever occupied, and even then his period in it was interrupted by the war years. Through its criticism of Neville Chamberlain the paper had attracted some opprobrium in right-wing circles, and towards the end of 1940 a question was asked in the House of Commons as to why its editor, only twenty-seven, was not already in uniform. This was an unfair aspersion on Cudlipp's patriotism: he had done his best to get his 'reserved occupation' classification lifted, and was only too keen to take part in the war effort. In December 1940 he enlisted in the Royal Sussex regiment, was soon sent to Sandhurst, and, having arrived as a subaltern in Egypt in time for the battle of El Alamein, was from 1943 to 1946 head of the army newspaper unit for the Mediterranean. In this capacity he founded and launched the British forces' paper, 'Union Jack', the title intended as a conscious riposte to the US army's publication, 'Stars and Stripes'. On 31 October 1945 he married a former 'Mirror' journalist and future 'Evening Standard' columnist, Eileen Mary Ascroft (1914-1962), with whom he had been in love since before the war. She was the daughter of Robert William Ascroft, of independent means, and the divorced wife of the film director Alexander Mackendrick. Cudlipp was appointed OBE (military) in 1945, and the following year was demobilized, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. 
Back in Geraldine House, off Fetter Lane, the headquarters both of the 'Daily Mirror' and of the 'Sunday Pictorial', Cudlipp once again found himself facing the abiding animosity of his former boss Bartholomew. It seems implausible that his original defection could still have been held against him; more probably what Bartholomew now recognized in Cudlipp was a threat to his own job. Certainly Bartholomew seems to have wanted him out of the way, and in 1949 -- with Cecil King temporarily absent in Nigeria, looking after the company's interests there -- he succeeded in attaining his objective. It was, however, a short-lived triumph: within two years (Cudlipp spent the intervening period none too happily as managing editor of Lord Beaverbrook's 'Sunday Express') King mounted a counter-putsch, and this time it was Bartholomew who was out. The invitation to Cudlipp to return followed at once, although this time no longer merely as editor of the 'Sunday Pictorial' but -- now that King had moved up to being board chairman -- as editorial director of both papers. 
For the next seventeen years King and Cudlipp, two very different individuals -- as distinct in their backgrounds as they were disparate in their interests -- worked harmoniously together. This was partly because King concentrated on extending the company's commercial base, acquiring the Amalgamated Press in 1958, and following that up with the takeover of the Odhams Group in 1962, bringing two further national newspapers (the 'Daily Herald' and 'The People') into 'Mirror' ownership. With a typical touch of hauteur the nephew of Lord Northcliffe declared himself, the following year, the first chairman of the International Publishing Corporation (IPC), a title that eventually passed, somewhat inauspiciously, to Cudlipp. There were, of course, occasional policy disagreements. It was no secret, for example, that in 1956 King thought that the 'Mirror' should support Sir Anthony Eden in his attempt to recover the Suez Canal from Colonel Nasser. King may on this occasion have had his finger closer on the working-class pulse than did Cudlipp but the latter argued forcefully that to support 'Eden's war' would be to wreck the paper's traditional relationship not merely with the Labour Party but with all progressive opinion. 
Next to journalism, politics had always been Cudlipp's consuming passion and, although he recognized that little or nothing could be done for the Labour Party at the general election of 1955 -- he eventually came up with the clever, if defeatist, headline 'Keep the tories tame' ('Daily Mirror', 24 May 1955) -- he pulled out all the stops on its behalf in 1959. That year's election result, in which the Conservatives under Harold Macmillan increased their majority from 60 to 100, came as a crushing blow to Cudlipp. Feeling that he had misread the nation's mood, he immediately declared 'a holiday from politics', even removing the traditional slogan 'Forward with the people' from the paper's masthead and ending the twice-weekly political column that had been contributed for the previous four years by the Labour MP Richard Crossman. Instead 'Mirror' readers in the week immediately following the election were regaled by the sad tale of Ferdinand the Bull, a creature so gentle that he refused even to do the duty expected of him. 
It was not Cudlipp's finest hour. But he soon found a new cause. In the long years of argument over British entry into Europe (or the Common Market, as it was then known) the 'Mirror' was always stalwart in making the positive case. The freshly re-elected Conservative government had every reason to feel grateful to it; indeed a Conservative cabinet minister at the time of the initial application in 1961 was heard to murmur 'We should be all right with the 'Mirror' behind us' -- meaning that the support of the 'Mirror' ought to enable the government to win the battle of public opinion (Windlesham, 157). Of course this new alignment put some strain on the paper's time-honoured relationship with the Labour Party, made worse when, at the party conference of 1962, its leader Hugh Gaitskell came out strongly against British entry. Gaitskell's premature death three months later, and the emergence of Harold Wilson as his successor served, however, to ease matters, and by 1964 the 'Mirror' was back firmly in Labour's corner (though not perhaps quite as vociferously as in 1959). It may nevertheless have been significant that Cudlipp chose to use the election campaign as the background for relaunching the old working-class 'Daily Herald' as a paper now called 'The Sun', 'born of the age we live in' ('Daily Telegraph'). It was one of Cudlipp's few flops, and the unlucky broadsheet was never to prosper until it was bought for a song by Rupert Murdoch and turned into a tabloid in 1969 (something that Cudlipp had always felt inhibited from doing, for fear of creating a rival to the 'Daily Mirror'). 
The early 1960s were not easy years for Cudlipp. His second wife, Eileen Ascroft, died of carbitral poisoning in a tragic accident at their home in Strand on the Green, Chiswick, on 29 April 1962. Nevertheless Cudlipp recovered his normal good spirits with his marriage, on 1 March 1963, to the then editor of the 'Woman's Mirror', Joan Latimer (Jodi) Hyland, daughter of David Jones, solicitor's clerk. This proved easily the longest lasting of his three marriages and brought him both calm and contentment. There was not, however, much sign of those qualities in his professional life. He agonized over the failure of 'The Sun' (which, the unkind alleged, meant that he had lost his popular touch), he mourned the fact that the Wilson government was not economically more successful, but above all he had to deal with the increasingly alarming megalomaniac tendencies of his own chairman, Cecil King. Unlike Cudlipp, who had never allowed himself to be bowled over by Wilson, King had great expectations of the new prime minister. Like his uncle Northcliffe in his relationship with Lloyd George, these tended to focus on the part that he would find himself playing as the power behind the throne. Things therefore got off to a bad start when, on forming his government in 1964, Wilson offered King merely a life peerage (rather than the hereditary viscountcy that he had expected), together with a rather humdrum post as minister of state at the Board of Trade. King angrily turned both offers down. He allowed his sense of grievance to fester, and his grand office suite in IPC's new headquarters at Holborn Circus became a gathering place for all the malcontents of Wilson's Labour Party. 
How far Cudlipp initially went along with King's disillusioned views is difficult to establish but there seems no question that some kind of Rubicon was crossed at a meeting that Cudlipp personally was asked to set up between King and Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the former chief of the defence staff. At this meeting, held on 8 May 1968 at Lord Mountbatten's Westminster home in the presence not only of Cudlipp but also of Sir Solly Zuckerman, scientific adviser to the government, King recklessly made the suggestion that Mountbatten should hold himself in readiness to take charge of the emergency government that would no doubt be needed after the inevitable military overthrow of the Wilson administration. For Cudlipp the sheer lunacy of this proposal (immediately refused by Mountbatten and branded as 'treachery' by Zuckerman) appears to have brought matters to a head. Two days later, with Cudlipp's encouragement, King's notorious, signed, personal assault on the Wilson government, headed 'Enough is enough', appeared on the front page of the 'Daily Mirror'. It was always Cudlipp's defence that he thought this course was preferable to the paper officially endorsing its chairman's line, but he also must have realized what the likely consequences would be. They did not take long to materialize. Three weeks later King was deposed by his own colleagues on the IPC board, and Cudlipp was unanimously chosen as chairman in his place. 
Cudlipp never felt entirely happy about wearing King's mantle; his natural habitat was the newsroom, not the sumptuous chairman's quarters on the ninth floor of the new Holborn Circus skyscraper. It was King himself who somewhat patronizingly announced on the day of his dismissal that his old subordinate was 'a first violin rather than a conductor' ('Daily Telegraph') -- and there may have been a germ of truth in that gibe. Certainly it was with some relief that, a year later, Cudlipp allowed IPC to merge with, and become a subdivision of, Reed International (which had traditionally supplied it with its newsprint). This meant that he was no longer responsible for the central commercial strategy of the company and could return to what he did best -- inspiring other journalists and lending his own flair to the business of producing mass-circulation newspapers. He did not, however, continue to do so for very long. In October 1971 he announced his impending retirement, which took effect on 31 December 1973. Knighted by Edward Heath in 1973, for his services to the European cause, he was created a life peer, as Baron Cudlipp of Aldingbourne, in the county of Sussex, on the nomination of Harold Wilson in the following year. 
In retirement at Chichester, Sussex, Cudlipp scrupulously observed Stanley Baldwin's injunction against speaking to the man at the wheel or spitting on the deck, and made only one tactical error, when he briefly made a return to what was by then called Mirror Group Newspapers, as a 'consultant' to Robert Maxwell, after those papers had passed into his greedy hands in 1984. His salary from Maxwell was a mere $10,000 -- and Cudlipp, soon realizing his mistake, ended the arrangement after a single year. Otherwise he concentrated his energies on the cultural life of Chichester, taking particular interest in the Festival Theatre there and becoming, in 1975, founder chairman of the city's annual festivities of music, arts, and fun. He also found time to write: both his autobiography, 'Walking on the Water' (1976), and his reflections on the newspaper trade, 'The Prerogative of the Harlot' (1980), were written in retirement, although two earlier (rumoured to be 'ghosted') works -- 'At your Peril' (1962) and 'Publish and be Damned' (1955) -- had appeared in his active, Fleet Street years. He made occasional speeches in the House of Lords, where he began by taking the Labour whip before, in 1981, joining the short-lived Social Democratic Party. A born raconteur, he was for twenty-five years a highly popular member of the Garrick Club. He died at his home, 14 Tollhouse Close, Avenue de Chartres, Chichester, of lung cancer, on 17 May 1998. He was survived by his wife, Jodi. He had no children.

Reid, John (1913-1998), author, was born on 1 July 1913 at Strathellie Cottages, Rathen, near Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, the first of the two children of James Gray Reid (died 1949), farm servant, and his wife, Margaret, 'nee' Todd (died 1969). After a fitful education at a series of schools he reluctantly followed in his father's footsteps and worked for a succession of masters on the land. The tedium of the farming round was relieved from the start by reading and by visits to the cinema, and then by his marriage, on 5 December 1934, to Margaret Jane Willox ('b'. 1916), followed by the arrival of three sons, Eric, Jack, and Graham. It was not until Reid suffered a serious illness in 1943 that he finally decided that he wanted to become a writer and, while he did not publish until years later he wrote continuously, finding inspiration not only from memory but also from research and excursions. He discovered some old business ledgers in a long-deserted shop, for example, and made good use of them in a masterly re-creation of a First World War airship station and the local inhabitants of Lenabo, now Forest of Deer. He kept diaries, compiled scrapbooks, and wrote obituaries of film stars and other famous people, which he compiled under the title 'Close the door softly'. A man of indefatigable curiosity and dogged persistence, he took the long road leading -- after many set-backs, including bouts of depression -- to ultimate success. 
Under his pen name, David Toulmin, John Reid published a novel, stories, and essays centring on rural life in north-east Scotland, especially the Buchan district. After several years of contributions to such journals as the 'Farmer and Stockbreeder' and the 'Buchan Observer' his first book, consisting mostly of short stories, 'Hard Shining Corn', was published in 1972; it was soon followed by another such collection, 'Straw into Gold' (1973). After several rejections and rewrites came his only novel, 'Blown Seed' (1976), which sold about 25,000 copies. 'Harvest Home', resuming the pattern of the first two books, followed in 1978; 'Travels without a Donkey' (1980) was an account of the car journeys taken around Scotland and the north of England by the author and his wife. 'A Chiel Among Them' (1982) was a mixture of stories and essays, while 'The Tillycorthie Story' (1986) was a concise account of a local estate; published in the same year, 'The Clyack Sheaf' was a final collection of stories and essays. Reid looked upon the award of an honorary MLitt from the University of Aberdeen in 1986 as an academic culmination to the high acclaim that he had already received, not only from literary critics such as John R. Allan, Isobel Murray, and Maurice Wiggin but also from other readers in Buchan and further afield. There was one more major publication to come, in 1989: a glossary of the language of north-east Scotland, 'Buchan Claik', in collaboration with a Peterhead fisherman, Peter Buchan. 'Collected Short Stories', with an introduction by Robert Smith, was published in 1992. 
John Reid died suddenly at his home, 49 West Dyke Avenue, Westhill, Skene, Aberdeenshire, on 13 May 1998, about six years after a debilitating stroke; his body was cremated and his ashes interred at Foveran kirkyard, Aberdeenshire. He was survived by his wife. Many of his unpublished diaries are now in the National Library of Scotland.

Gili, John Louis (1907-1998), bookseller, publisher, and Catalan scholar, was born Joan Lluis Gili i Serra on 10 February 1907 in Barcelona, the son of Lluis Gili Roig (1882-1957), bookseller and publisher, and his wife, Victoria Serra Sunyol. He was thus a scion of a publishing house founded by Gustavo Gili Roig in 1902, later Gustavo Gili SA, which became famous for its elegant books on art and architecture, including Picasso's 'Tauromaquia' (1959). Apprenticed in the book trade by his family, Gili was inducted into the creative discipline of translation by assisting a canon of Barcelona Cathedral to prepare Catalan versions of Homer and St Augustine. He acquired a love of English literature through his friendship with Josep Carner, and later translated short stories by D. H. Lawrence and Katherine Mansfield. This led to correspondence with the countryside author C. Henry Warren, who invited him to England in 1933. Gili returned to settle permanently in England in October 1934, when he went into partnership with Warren to open a bookshop at 5 Cecil Court, off Charing Cross Road, London (1935). When the stock of English books failed to sell the partnership was dissolved and Gili, now sole owner, filled the space with Spanish school and university texts imported from Barcelona. He then began to publish on his own account, beginning with a book on Luis de Leon as translator of the classics, printed by Sopena in Barcelona but with changed title-page. During the visit to England of Miguel de Unamuno in 1936 Gili was invited to meet him at the embassy of the Spanish Second Republic, where the novelist Perez de Ayala was envoy, and there obtained the philosopher's permission to publish any of his works in Britain. 
After the founding of the Dolphin Book Company (named for the sixteenth-century Aldine editions and the Mediterranean cetacean that represented social love in medieval art) Gili's first limited printing was 'The Crafty Farmer' (1938), a Spanish fairy tale retold by Henry Thomas, with illustrations by the Spanish artist Gregorio Prieto; Gili's collaboration with Prieto continued that same year in 'Estudiantes', an album of twenty-five line engravings of Oxford and Cambridge students. In those early editions Gili's mastery of page design and typography already came to the fore: he always observed the Renaissance golden 'rule of three', whereby the width of the upper margin was doubled in the side margins and trebled in the lower where the reader's fingers supported the volume. He also disliked the glare of white paper, preferring thick cream weaves for the special printings. 
The first public edition of 'Dolphin Bookshop Editions' was a collection of Unamuno's writings selected by Gili and with an introduction by J. B. Trend (1938). This was surpassed in the following year by one of Dolphin's most successful productions, Federico Garcia Lorca's 'Poems', jointly translated by Stephen Spender and Gili, with an introduction by Lorca's close friend Rafael Martinez Nadal, which was simultaneously published in New York and Toronto by Oxford University Press; a second impression appeared from Dolphin in 1942, and a new revised selection from the Hogarth Press in 1943. Gili later provided plain prose translations of Lorca's verse for the bilingual 'Penguin Poets' edition in 1960, which was much reprinted. He was also privileged to design an elegant edition of Lorca's unpublished play 'El publico' (1976), also with a prologue by Nadal. 
During the Spanish Civil War the Dolphin Bookshop became such a centre for supporters of the republic that in 1938 Gili received threats from an official at the rival Francoist embassy that his family in Barcelona would in due course suffer if he did not rein in these activities. On 24 June of the same year at Kensington register office he married Elizabeth Helen McPherson (1913-2011), the eldest of the three daughters of John Livingstone McPherson, a Scottish-Canadian missionary in China. Elizabeth had taken a first in philosophy at University College, London, and had won in 1937 a Henry fellowship at Yale, where fortuitously she met a member of the family who had inherited the bulk of the library of manuscripts and printed books of the French Hispanist Raymond Foulche-Delbosc. In late 1938 the newly married book dealers secured the contract to handle that important library, and in January 1939 Gili arranged for it to be loaded onto a railway wagon and transported to London. This bibliographical coup was to make Gili one of the most important Hispanic antiquarian booksellers of his generation. 
When the Second World War began in September 1939, Cecil Court seemed a dangerous place to keep important books and manuscripts. Elizabeth was just embarking on a doctorate in sociology under Karl Mannheim at the London School of Economics, which was evacuated to Peterhouse in Cambridge. The Gilis, and the rarer Dolphin stock, followed, to a small medieval house in Little St Mary's Lane, but before the end of the 'phoney war' they returned to London to new premises in Kensington. When the blitz began in September 1940 the Dolphin stock was moved again, to Oxford, at first to an artist's studio in Park Town, thence to more permanent quarters in Fyfield Road, where they organized a postal service for Hispanists in Britain, Ireland, and North America. 
In Oxford the Gilis again found themselves principal hosts for Spanish republican exiles. As an alien from a technically neutral country (he was naturalized in 1948, Anglicizing his forenames to John Louis), Gili began at this inauspicious moment to promote Catalan studies by publishing the first edition of his 'Catalan Grammar' in 1943, the year in which his son Jonathan Francesc Gili was born; he was later to become a well-known documentary film-maker. Two other children followed: Katherine, a sculptor, and Martin, who carried on the Dolphin Book Company. 
Of the seventy-three titles published under the Dolphin imprint between 1936 and 1996 no fewer than twenty-five were Catalan works, forty were Spanish or Spanish American, five were on art, and three were English works. The Catalan books included three editions of medieval texts prepared by Gili himself with enormous scholarly care. All the covers of the seven homage volumes to British and Irish Hispanists were designed with individual touches appropriate to the recipient. 
In photographs taken in his late twenties Gili appears as a figure of urbane handsomeness and quiet authority, but later in life his rugged and lithe physique and almost oriental physiognomy suggested rather an upbringing in the Catalonian countryside for which he had so much affection. This impression was strengthened when he was hard at work in his quarter of an acre on Cumnor Hill, cultivating Mediterranean vegetables under glass among the medlars, quinces, and numerous apple trees in an orchard surrounded by strawberry trees and punctuated by large abstract sculptures created by his daughter, Katherine. That idyllic setting no doubt influenced Elizabeth to embark on her publication of cookery books, including 'Apple Recipes from A to Z' (1975). 
In recognition of his role in providing a meeting place and publishing centre for republican exiles and his decisive measures to spread the culture of Catalonia in the Anglo-Saxon world, including as co-founder of the Anglo-Catalan Society, Gili was honoured with the cross of St George by the Generalitat de Catalunya, and was made an honorary MA by the University of Oxford and a commander of the order of Isabel the Catholic by Juan Carlos I of Spain. Up to his ninetieth year he regularly played tennis with his usual Oxford partner. He died of cancer after a short illness in Sobell House hospice, Oxford, on 6 May 1998, only seven weeks before the diamond wedding anniversary celebrations he and Elizabeth had planned. She and their three children survived him.

Ford, (Richard) Boris (1917-1998), educationist and literary editor, was born on 1 July 1917 in Simla, India, son of Brigadier Geoffrey Noel Ford CBE and his Russian wife, Ekatarina. He was first educated as a chorister at King's College School, Cambridge. Music was a lifelong passion: he sang, latterly as counter-tenor, was a good pianist, and built a harpsichord. He attended Gresham's School, Holt, a progressive public school in Norfolk, especially strong in the humanities. Its pupils included W. H. Auden and Benjamin Britten, whose work was always close to Ford's heart: his last book, 'Benjamin Britten's Poets' (1994), was an edition of verse set to music by Britten. His English master at Gresham's, Denys Thompson, sent him to be taught by F. R. Leavis at Downing College, Cambridge, where he took both parts of the English tripos (1938, 1939). While still an undergraduate he published an essay in Leavis's journal 'Scrutiny'. He was active among the undergraduates in the English Club who were determined, under Leavis's influence, to reform the English curriculum. 
Ford was a wartime educator: from the army education corps he moved up to become by 1946 officer commanding the Middle East School of Artistic Studies and then chief editor and director of the Army Bureau of Current Affairs (ABCA). ABCA gave officers and men a critical account of Britain, so critical that Ford attracted the attention of MI5. ABCA pamphlets helped the emergence of the welfare state: Ford believed that the Labour Party came to power in 1945 as a result of the democratizing influence of ABCA seminars. His first book was 'Discussion Method' (1949). 
In 1951 Ford became information officer of the technical assistance board of UNESCO. In 1953 he was invited by W. E. Williams, a former ABCA man, to edit a multi-authored seven-volume 'Pelican Guide to English Literature' (1954-61; revised, 1982-8). It was a significant initiative in English studies. Ford wrote in the 'General introduction' that earlier manuals had 'a take-it-or-leave-it attitude about them', but the 'Pelican Guide' was intended to be evaluative, concerned 'first and foremost, with value for the present', in the spirit of F. R. Leavis -- and perhaps it was created at Leavis's expense. Leavis closed 'Scrutiny' in 1953, remarking bitterly that Ford had 'approached my main people', and rightly considering that some of the 'Pelican Guide' essays were derivative. None the less, the overall plan was successful: the 'Pelican Guide' did provide a 'contour-map of the literary scene' with accompanying social history. The first volume, 'The Age of Chaucer', was unique to the series because it included a 200-page anthology of non-Chaucerian medieval poetry in original texts which gave early English poetry a presence for contemporary poets. 
In his 'Pelican Guide' period Ford also wrote and administered in the educational field. He was secretary to an inquiry into liberalizing technical education, publishing 'Liberal Education in a Technical Age' in 1955, when he became editor of 'Universities Quarterly' (until 1983; later known as 'New Universities Quarterly'), and also head of schools broadcasting for the television company Associated Rediffusion. His tenure was abbreviated by patrician comments on the quality of the network's advertising output. However, Ford received encouragement from the company for Benjamin Britten's opera for children 'Noye's Fludde'. In 1957-8 Ford was education secretary at Cambridge University Press, initiating its schools books committee which enabled the press to carry university-level English studies into the school curriculum. He brought David Holbrook and Sybil Marshall to the press. From 1963 to 1965 he was chairman of the National Association for the Teaching of English. 
Ford's torrent of post-war proposals and commissions flowed into an academic professional career as educationist, first as professor of education and director of the Institute of Education, then from 1960 to 1963 at Sheffield University, and then from 1963 to 1973 at Sussex University, where, as dean to the school of culture and community studies, with Vice-Chancellor Asa Briggs as ally, he put music on the map in the university. His last chair was at Bristol (1973-82). At a time when teacher training colleges were closing, his 'Changing Relationships between Universities and Teachers' Colleges' (1975) was timely. 
Ford never really retired. He edited for Cambridge University Press the seven-volume 'Cambridge Guide to the Arts in Britain' (1988-91), which resembled the 'Pelican Guide'. He disliked being called an entrepreneur: he was an opportunist with ideas which he nurtured with persistent gentleness, a gentleness that made him a friend to women, though not always to their husbands. He was married twice, first on 7 March 1950 to a schoolteacher, Noreen Edna Auty, 'nee' Collins (1921/2-1995), the cheery companion of his Yorkshire and Sussex years, with whom he had three children. This marriage was dissolved about 1973, and he married on 21 July 1977 Inge (originally Enid) Inglis, 'nee' Evans, a fund-raiser and exhibitions organizer; their marriage was dissolved in 1984. Boris Ford died in the Whittington Hospital, Islington, London, on 19 May 1998.

Grayson, Cecil (1920-1998), Italian scholar, was born on 5 February 1920 at 1 Court 6, Taylor Street, Batley, Yorkshire, the second son of John Grayson (died 1926), boiler maker, and his wife, Dora, 'nee' Hartley (died 'c'.1980), a seamstress. Educated at Batley grammar school and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, he obtained first-class honours in modern languages in 1947, his academic work interrupted by war service in India (1940-46). In 1947 he married Margaret Parry Jordan (1922-1999), with whom he had three daughters and a son. In 1948 he began teaching as university lecturer in Italian at Oxford; in 1958 he was elected to Oxford's Serena chair. At one time his pupils filled nearly half the Italian university teaching posts in Britain, and a goodly proportion of Commonwealth and American university teachers of Italian also counted him as their mentor. 
When Professor Grayson was elected president of the Modern Humanities Research Association in 1987, his presidential address discussed the advantages and disadvantages of a literary life: the allusion to the 'De commodis litterarum atque incommodis' of Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) was clear to Renaissance specialists. It was the first of Alberti's writings on which he worked, a cautionary introduction which warns against expecting too many material rewards from academic life. His research was closely identified with the development of the so-called 'nuova filologia' ('new philology') as practised by scholars such as Michele Barbi, Vittorio Cian, and Carlo Dionisotti. Professor Grayson's was a similarly rigorous critical approach; he had little patience with the cavils of post-war literary criticism; his method, which depended upon verifiable literary and historical evidence, concentrated on detailed textual analysis. 
In 1949 Grayson produced with Carlo Dionisotti an edition with commentary of 'Early Italian Texts'. The 'Opuscoli inediti di Leon Battista Alberti' (1954) firmly established his scholarly reputation, providing him with his first major edition and a breakthrough into the Italian academic hierarchy. For a quarter of a century after his election to the chair he was a vigorous co-editor of the journal 'Italian Studies'. He became a natural choice as one of Britain's vice-presidents of the International Association of Italianists (AISLLI), which he served for forty years. 
Professor Grayson's strong interest in Alberti continued with a brief but elaborate edition of an unpublished letter to Matteo de' Pasti, subtitled 'Alberti and the Tempio Malatestiano', published in 1957. And shortly afterwards he discovered and edited manuscripts of Vincenzo Colli ('Il Calmeta'), hardly known to scholarship before Grayson showed that here were the first pages of modern literary criticism; these he published as 'Prose e lettere edite e inedite' in 1959. In 1960 his inaugural lecture appeared: 'A Renaissance Controversy: Latin or Italian'. What began as an objective examination of the Italian 'questione della lingua' provoked ideas which rumbled on for a decade, though Grayson treated it as a casual sideline; the argument reached its apogee in 1971 when his essay 'Machiavelli and Dante' initiated further international debate. During that same period Professor Grayson had been engaged on his edition of the works of Alberti ('Opere volgari'), published in three ample volumes in 1960, 1966, and 1973. He also began editing Alberti's vernacular grammar, which he published in 1964 as 'Leon Battista Alberti e la prima grammatica della lingua volgare'. In 1972 he edited Alberti's 'On Painting and on Sculpture: the Latin Texts of De pictura and De statua'. His final Alberti edition was the text of 'De pictura' (1980), though he published an English version in 1991. 
Apart from his work on the Renaissance, Professor Grayson's essays on Dante's language and style, particularly in his 'Cinque saggi su Dante' of 1972 and on the development of pre-Renaissance vernacular literature, became minor classics. He gave regular lectures on Dante and for a quarter of a century was president-secretary of the Oxford Dante Society, whose essays he edited for Oxford University Press in 'The World of Dante' in 1980; he celebrated the tenth anniversary of his own retirement by giving Oxford's Paget Toynbee Dante lectures. In 1965 he edited for Oxford University Press a selection from Francesco Guicciardini, translated by his wife, Margaret. He also translated three of the historical biographies of Roberto Ridolfi (Savonarola, Machiavelli, and Guicciardini), items he considered part of his relaxation. 
Cecil Grayson had an imposing international reputation beyond Europe. In the United States he enjoyed many fellowships or visiting professorships: fellow in residence at Chicago's Newberry Library in 1965; and visiting professor at Yale (1966), Berkeley (1969 and 1973), UCLA (1980, 1984, 1987, and 1994), and New York University, where he taught for the whole of the academic year 1995-6 when already seventy-six years of age. He undertook long stints as visiting professor at Cape Town (1980 and 1983) and Perth (1973 and 1980), and was a frequent visitor to South Africa and the Antipodes. 
Professor Grayson was elected to Italy's most prestigious academies: the Lincei, the Crusca, Arcadia, the Istituto Veneto, and Bologna's Commissione per i Testi di Lingua and Accademia delle Scienze; in 1974 he was given the international Galileo prize, and in 1976 the British Academy's Serena gold medal, three years before his election to the Academy itself. His CBE in 1992 was anticipated by Italy seventeen years earlier with the title of Commendatore dell'ordine al merito. The honorary fellowship awarded him in 1986 at his old college, St Edmund Hall, gave him particular pleasure. At his retirement dinner he was presented with the nearest that Oxford approaches to a Festschrift: 'The Languages of Literature in Renaissance Italy' (1988), edited by his Oxford colleagues; in 1997 another Oxford University Press volume, 'Dante and Governance', was dedicated to him, marking the anniversary of his retirement. He lived in Oxford from 1947 to 1998, principally at 11 Norham Road, though he enjoyed much time at his cottage in Pembrokeshire acquired in 1960. In 1998 the city council of Mantua nominated him for honorary citizenship; he was preparing to attend the ceremony when he was taken into the John Radcliffe Hospital, where he died of coronary thrombosis on 29 April 1998. He was cremated in Oxford.

Coiley, John Arthur (1932-1998), museum curator, was born on 29 March 1932 at 3 Pilgrim Hill, West Norwood, London, the only son of Arthur Henry George Coiley (1896-1993), a share transfer clerk and later a company registrar, and his wife, Stella, 'nee' Chinnock (1901-1985), a secretary. He was educated at Beckenham and Penge county grammar school and Selwyn College, Cambridge (1951-7), where he graduated BA (1954) in metallurgy and PhD (1959) with a thesis on the application of electron microscopy to metallurgical analysis. His marriage to Patricia Anne Dixon ('b'. 1932), a grammar school teacher, was solemnized at the Unitarian Memorial Church in Cambridge on 30 June 1956; they had a daughter and two sons. 
Coiley is known principally for his role in establishing the National Railway Museum in York, the first national collection to be located outside London. His interest in railways started with a schoolboy enthusiasm which matured at university into a deep and abiding knowledge. The photographic skills acquired as part of his doctoral work sparked a lifelong hobby photographing railways in Britain and abroad. His early career was not, however, connected with railways. He worked as a research scientist, initially at the UK Atomic Energy Authority at Harwell (1957-60); a move to private industry, at first in a research capacity at Aeon Laboratories, Egham (1960-65), led to a post as development manager at Fulmer Research Laboratories (1965-73). Throughout this entire period Coiley's amateur interest in the history and contemporary practice of railways continued to grow, some of his photographic work being included in a compilation shared with four fellow graduates, 'Images of Steam' (1968, 2nd edn, 1974). A love of mechanical things was also apparent in the interest he shared with the rest of his family in motor rallying. His experience, mostly in the 1960s, as a navigator in competitive events left him with a taste for fast driving in ordinary traffic which often surprised those who had previously known only the unfailingly polite and seemingly mild-mannered man. 
In 1973 Coiley was appointed an assistant keeper at the Science Museum, bringing together in what was to prove a gloriously successful combination his interest in railways and the managerial skills he had acquired in professional life. The controversial decision to locate the National Railway Museum outside London had just been taken, and Coiley was at the heart of preparations to move the greater part of the Science Museum's railway collection to York. There it was to join in a newly converted engine shed the collection of historic railway locomotives, rolling stock, and other items large and small built up by the private railway companies and their nationalized successor. 
Appointment as the first keeper of the National Railway Museum in 1974 at the age of forty-one opened the most important and productive phase of Coiley's career. His unflappable manner, quiet diplomatic charm, and enormous drive disarmed critics of the move out of London and ensured that the museum opened on schedule on 27 September 1975, the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The museum was an instant and outstanding success, attracting more than a million visitors a year. Its innovative coverage of the history, technology, and contemporary practice of Britain's railways rapidly gained it an international reputation, which was further enhanced by Coiley's long-standing involvement in the International Association of Transport Museums, of which he was president from 1983 to 1986. 
Coiley remained in charge of the National Railway Museum until his retirement in 1992. Acquisition of adjacent land and buildings in the 1970s provided space for storing much of the collection, which was judiciously expanded as the modernization of the railways continued to displace equipment. Although the general public perhaps most readily appreciated the static and working displays of large, beautifully restored locomotives and rolling stock, less spectacular history found a place among the many smaller items on show. Out of the public gaze, a reference library and archive, a huge photographic collection, and a more modest one of railway art and graphic posters provided for the needs of scholars and enthusiasts alike. In the last years of Coiley's leadership the museum expanded and renewed many of its exhibitions, in the process giving a greater emphasis to the railways' social and human side. 
In retirement Coiley continued to live in Farnham, near Knaresborough, West Riding of Yorkshire, and maintained a close and supportive relationship with the museum through the organization of friends and volunteers he had helped to establish shortly after his arrival in York. He died, aged sixty-six, from a heart attack at Chur railway station in Switzerland on 22 May 1998, while leading a group exploring the delights of the Swiss railway system. Cremation on 1 June 1998 was followed by the burial of his ashes at St Oswald's Church, Farnham.

Trelawny, Ian Clarence (1917-1998), docks manager and port consultant, was born on 17 January 1917 at 1 Coltbridge Terrace, Edinburgh, the eldest child in the family of three sons and two daughters of Captain Clarence Walter Eyre Trelawny, an officer in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Barbara Cecil, 'nee' Carus-Wilson (died 1976). The family was from Cornwall, and Trelawny was educated at St Erbyn's School, Penzance, and King's College, Taunton. After working as a clerk for a cold storage firm, in 1938 he started a boat-building and yacht-broking business in London. On 23 September 1939 he married Mary Ethel ('b'. 1914/15), the daughter of Edgar Frank Eyles, theatrical manager. 
On the outbreak of the Second World War Trelawny joined the Royal Navy as a rating, serving in mine-sweepers and later in an armed merchant cruiser. After he had recovered from severe wounds received in action in August 1942, he was commissioned and was posted to Felixstowe, Suffolk, where he served in the coastal force. Following promotion to lieutenant-commander he commanded the 11th MTB (motor torpedo boat) flotilla from 1943 to 1945. He was awarded the DSC and bar for his part in many raids against German ships firing on British planes flying over the North Sea, and on E-boats attacking British coastal shipping. During the Normandy invasions in 1944 he worked on salvage, and later he organized the reopening of several ports along the northern European coast. He remained in the Royal Navy after the war, commanding a salvage ship in Hong Kong harbour for a time. On 12 October 1946, his first marriage having ended in divorce, he remarried: his second wife was (Angela) June Wilkinson ('b'. 1923/4), the daughter of Dr James Howard Wilkinson, medical practitioner. She had served in the Women's Royal Naval Service during the war. They had one son and three daughters. 
Trelawny was appointed manager of the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company in 1955. The company had been founded as the Felixstowe Railway and Pier Company in 1875 by Colonel George Tomline, a local landowner, who had bought 6000 acres of land from the duke of Hamilton in 1867, and obtained parliamentary permission to build a railway line from Ipswich to Felixstowe -- then only a small village on the north bank of the River Orwell, about a mile from the North Sea. The railway was completed in 1877. Hoping to develop Felixstowe as a port, he extended the line down to the Orwell and in the early 1880s built a small dock basin opposite the port of Harwich. But although Felixstowe developed as a seaside resort, the port did not prosper except as a centre for flying boats between the wars, and it was requisitioned during the Second World War as a base for air-sea rescues, as well as for coastal defence. In 1951 the nearly derelict docks were handed back to the company, which was bought by Gordon Parker, a Norfolk grain merchant, who became chairman. The docks were flooded during the devastating east coast floods of 1953, causing the dock basin to silt up, and the old wooden piers were destroyed, while the foundations of many buildings, and the railway lines, were undermined. 
Starting with a workforce of nine, Trelawny began dredging the docks and salvaging what remained of the infrastructure. This was in the face of opposition from the local council, which did not want the town to expand and tried to purchase compulsorily the docks to use as a rubbish dump. Trelawny was helped by the fact that Felixstowe, as a virtually redundant port, had not been included in the national dock labour scheme of 1947, and so he was not hampered by some of the restrictive practices enshrined in the scheme. Two new piers were completed in 1957, and, always in the forefront of developments in methods of cargo handling, he was the first dock manager to use forklift trucks, in 1956. In order to encourage the expanding plastics industry to import chemicals through Felixstowe, he reclaimed the old admiralty tanks, and built new ones, linked by pipelines to tankers moored on the quay, for the storage of liquid chemicals. An oil jetty was completed in 1964. 
The biggest expansion of Felixstowe as a cargo port came in the 1960s with the introduction of container traffic, and Felixstowe was the first East Anglian port to build a container holder for use on roll-on roll-off ferries. A new cold store, the only one on the east coast, opened in 1963 to handle frozen goods passing through the docks, and Trelawny went on to open a tanker terminal. By the mid-1960s work was under way on a scheme to reclaim land in Harwich harbour to build a quay to provide space for more container ships and ferries. The new container terminal was completed in 1968 and extended in 1973. By 1975 Felixstowe docks were able to handle 3 million tons of container traffic. Townsend Thoresen, the ferry company, began operating a regular passenger service to Zeebrugge in Belgium in 1974 and opened a continental ferry terminal in 1978. By the end of the century Felixstowe had been transformed from a quiet seaside town, chiefly a dormitory for Ipswich, into Britain's largest container port. Although the port was bought by European Ferries in 1976, and taken over first by P & O in 1987 and then by Hutchison Whampoa in 1991, the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company (known as the Dock Company) continued to own and operate most of the cargo handling infrastructure. 
Trelawny was appointed OBE in 1967. In 1972 he moved from management to be head of the consultancy side of the company, and he travelled worldwide, advising on the improvement of port facilities. He retired in 1987, and died on 22 April 1998 in the St Elizabeth Hospice, 565 Foxhall Road, Ipswich, Suffolk, of lung cancer. His remains were privately cremated on 30 April. He was survived by his wife, June, and their four children.

Waldman, Ronald Hartley (1914-1978), television executive, was born at 32 Gore Road, South Hackney, London, on 13 May 1914, the second of three sons of Michael Ernest Waldman, chief clerk with a firm of wholesale merchants supplying mineral water, and his wife, Bloema Greenberg. Born into a Jewish family, he grew up in London. Waldman was educated at Owen's School and Pembroke College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in history and was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. 
Waldman learned his craft as an actor and a producer with the Brighton Repertory Company and he wrote and composed theatrical reviews. He joined the BBC in 1938 as a variety producer and under the tutelage of Harry S. Pepper he became skilled in the creation of such radio programmes as 'Monday Night at Seven' (later 'Monday Night at Eight'). His voice became familiar through 'Puzzle corner', a popular part of the programme. His career was interrupted by the Second World War: he served in the RAF and produced variety shows for the armed services. He returned to BBC radio in 1945 and moved to BBC television in 1950. On 23 February 1953 Waldman married an actress, Lana (1930/31-1998), daughter of Sydney Morris, a skirt manufacturer. They had a son. 
Waldman joined in the BBC television pioneering days at Alexandra Palace when television was the junior partner to radio. By the time competition arrived on 22 September 1955 in the shape of ITV, Waldman, now head of light entertainment, was responsible for 450 programmes a year. There were variety programmes like 'Cafe Continental', 'This is Show Business with Vic Oliver' (Sir Winston Churchill's son-in-law), and 'Face the Music' with Henry Hall. Comedy programmes starred Arthur Askey, Benny Hill, Frankie Howerd, Norman Wisdom, and Terry-Thomas. Panel programmes made household names of Gilbert Harding, Barbara Kelly, and Eamonn Andrews. 
Within the television service light entertainment was not as highly regarded as drama and current affairs; but as Waldman welded his producers into a firmer unit, more programmes became successful, some outstandingly so. His visits to the United States taught him that the foundation of good programmes was to build series. He recruited the best comedy writers like Frank Muir and Denis Norden, who wrote 'Whacko' for Jimmy Edwards, and he ensured that 'Hancock's Half Hour', starring Tony Hancock and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, was transferred triumphantly from radio to television. His support for the writers ensured that they stayed loyal to the BBC. 
Among other successful programmes launched during Waldman's time were such landmarks in the television schedule as 'The Billy Cotton Band Show', 'Dixon of Dock Green' with Jack Warner, and 'This is your Life'. After the twenty-first anniversary of BBC television in November 1957, Waldman summed up his role: 'This is Our Life... to entertain 95 per cent of the people 95 per cent of the time' (Briggs, 4.139). 
After more than seven years of leading light entertainment Waldman was appointed in 1958 to a new post dealing with buying, making, and selling telefilms. His energy and vitality, coupled with a shrewd business sense, led to a growing role for the BBC as an exporter of programmes. Waldman was well regarded as a BBC ambassador: he was a man of medium height, a warm smile, and always well dressed. He was promoted to general manager, TV Enterprises, in 1961 and was congratulated by the director-general, Hugh Carleton Greene, for his tenacity and cheerfulness in a pioneering task. 
Waldman made his final career switch in 1963 when he was asked to head the British Commonwealth International Newsfilm Agency (BCINA). This was a BBC venture which brought together like-minded public service broadcasters from Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (and in addition the Rank Organization) to create a company which would bring about the fast flow of film (later videotapes) covering news events around the world. After an uncertain start BCINA became VisNews, and when the world-wide news agency Reuters joined, success followed. Waldman was a hands-on managing director and when he retired, aged sixty, in 1974, he had laid the foundations of a major international company that was to become Reuters Television. 
Waldman died from cancer, aged sixty-three, at his home, 60 Wolsey Road, Moor Park, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, on 10 March 1978. He was survived by his wife and son, Simon (who also worked for BBC television, in the news department).

Kelly, Mary Elfreda (1888-1951), founder of the Village Drama Society, was born on 25 March 1888 at Salcombe vicarage, Devon, the second of the four children of the Revd Maitland Kelly (1842-1929), from 1900 squire of Kelly, Devon, and his second wife, Elfreda Blanche Carey (died 1891). After her mother's death Ella Carey, her aunt, acted as housekeeper and mother to the younger children. Mary spent a happy childhood at Kelly House -- 'filled with sunshine, green grass and blue skies' (Kelly, 183) -- as one of the 'Little Ones', who looked upon their six stepsiblings more or less as adults. Educated at home by a governess until the age of sixteen, Mary then attended school at The Halsteads, East Sheen. It is believed that at some time during the 1920s she attended art school. During the First World War she worked as a cook in a VAD hospital in Exeter and then at the War Office as a clerk. She loved London, where her intellect was stimulated. After the war she returned home to Kelly House, where in 1918 she founded the Village Drama Society (VDS). 
Mary Kelly began the VDS at home, where there had been family theatricals since Victorian days. A little bored as a pampered young gentrywoman, yet also conscious of the democratic upheaval that came in the wake of the war, she now endeavoured to include local people in such activities. She developed plans for a Kelly Dramatic Society, which should include all the people in the parish, of whatever class or age. But there was a specific potential that she wanted to develop. The Revd Hugh Maitland and his wife had mounted a modest annual missionary festival in the parsonage garden. After the Maitlands left in 1905, the young Margaret and Dorothea Kelly continued it, moving it to Kelly House grounds and introducing a small pageant. 
On 15 January 1919 Mary Kelly called a meeting to announce her plans. While some of the tenant farmers and their families were immediately enthusiastic, others were much less so. But the squire's social writ -- the Kelly estate comprised the whole parish: all the farmers were tenants -- ensured that the whole village pulled together. Quite soon, the dramatic society established itself as something of a community. 
Mary Kelly wrote a 'Bible' story play, 'Joseph', which was performed on Ascension day 1919. Impressed by the emergence of talent from unexpected places, she went on to write and mount such plays each Ascensiontide, eventually moving the performances into the tithe barn. Maitland Kelly directed that a stage be built there. Emphatically Christian as well as communal in emphasis, the annual event -- which included a special service and a feast -- raised $100 per annum for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel medical mission that Mary's sister Ursula and her husband, Frank Drewe, had established at Holy Cross, Pondoland, in southern Africa. 
Mary Kelly's religious plays -- she wrote others -- were written around the village players, to suit their own characteristics. They adhered to their Devon dialect. An ethos of simple dignity was maintained. Gradually the Kelly play became famous, especially for its simplicity and the sincerity of the players. Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst, who arrived at Dartington in 1925, were friends and regular visitors, bringing a crowd with them. 
The idea of the Village Drama Society was to encourage similar experimentation in other villages. Visits by the Kelly players indeed encouraged other societies to form, and Mary was soon busy fielding requests for advice. Kelly being remote, she moved to Camberwell in the 1920s -- but returned to Kelly to produce the Ascensiontide play for seven or eight years. The society grew rapidly and Mary travelled the country speaking at Women's Institute meetings arguing for better drama -- but a mixed reception eventually made her decide to sever links with the institute. The VDS affiliated to the British Drama League (founded 1919), becoming absorbed by it in 1932. Mary continued to work for the league, and by 1939 over 600 village societies had formed. 
Mary wrote and produced pageants at Selborne (1926), Rillington (1927), Bradstone (1929), Launceston (1931), Bude, and Exeter Cathedral ('The Pitifull Queene', 1932). The Selborne play dramatized parts of Gilbert White's 'Antiquities' and letters, to evoke and construct an easeful, gentrified village summer. 'The Pitifull Queene' dealt with Henrietta Maria. Her major emphasis elsewhere is on the life of common folk, sometimes, as at the opening of the Rillington drama, achieving a domestic focus centred on women and children. The Launceston pageant sharply dramatized the distinct cultural and racial identity of the Cornish. Bradstone is the tiny hamlet neighbouring Kelly. As the squire's daughter, Mary could for this event forgo the business of financial guarantees that beset most pageant makers. Her father had a grandstand built. The bishop of Exeter attended. 
Mary handled the pageant form distinctively and well. In 'How to Make a Pageant' (1936) she drew on her own experiences and her witnessing of similar events in other countries to argue for its reform. By then an outmoded cultural form, characterized by apathy, embarrassment, and at best a vague sense of nationhood, the pageant had, she argued, the potential to show 'the slow unfolding and growth of ideal which history reveals', 'the conflict between the individual and the mass', so that 'the raw crowds [of performers] will lose all self-consciousness and be lifted together into a strongly felt and sincerely acted emotion' (pp. 6-9). The coexistence in the ostensibly 'non-political' Kelly of royalist sentiment on the one hand and enthusiastically progressive -- to some extent democratic -- impulses on the other was not unusual in the inter-war period. 
Mary Kelly's early success with village drama depended on much more than her class and her father's power. It rested on her good nature and her enthusiasm. Roy Johns ('b'. 1913), who got involved aged six along with his tenant-farmer father, Abel, and played for the Kelly Drama Society into the 1950s, recalled both her intellect and her 'wonderful sense of humour'. She involved herself fully in the village and insisted that any member might chair a meeting of the society. This outgoing woman, who could readily drop into dialect, was so well liked that 'people couldn't refuse her'. Plump, homely, and physically comfortable, she laughed easily, her laughter moving both her whole body and then others to laughter. 
Between the wars Kelly House filled again with children, as nephews and nieces from two families moved back from Africa. Mary loved and understood the younger generation, and took especial care of her godson Michael. His wife, Margery, who arrived at Kelly in 1937 recalled Mary as lively, full of fun, artistic, and a rebel: 'There was a rather outrageous occasion when she used face powder! Ye Gods!' (private information). To all the younger generation at Kelly she was fun and a great friend. Her stepsister Margaret praised the way she continued working despite ill health, and overcame all obstacles; but also noted that she did not suffer fools gladly. Of her various publications -- including plays and pageants, 'On English Costume' (1932), and 'Group Play Making' (1948) -- the most significant are 'How to Make a Pageant' (1936) and 'Village Theatre' (1939). 'The book of the Kellys' (1954) is an unpublished family history researched by Mary and completed by her stepsister Margaret. 
When war broke out in 1939, Mary Kelly moved back to the south-west to live in Exeter and to work for the drama and music committee of the Devon education department, visiting schools in the county. However, following two major operations, she retired and moved to South Africa later in 1939 to join her great friend Joanna Elder at Kokstad, East Griqualand. There she painted and helped both Africans and Europeans with their drama. On 9 June 1949 she was appointed OBE for her services to the British Drama League. Her life was again full of interest; but she fell ill and was hospitalized with dysentery, and while convalescing died suddenly on 5 November 1951 at Ikopo, Natal. At her memorial service in 1951 Ian Kelway, who succeeded Mary as Devon county drama adviser, declared that it was she 'who began again to give back to the ordinary village people what was their birthright' by reviving village drama (private information).

Hutchins, Elizabeth Leigh (1858-1935), social investigator and socialist, was born on 20 April 1858 at 25 Hanover Square, London, the daughter of Frederick Leigh Hutchins, a solicitor, and his wife, Emily Every. Little is known about her early years. Privately educated, she later attended King's College for Women in London and in 1896 became a student at the new London School of Economics, where she was taught by Beatrice Webb. 
Remaining in London, she joined the Women's Industrial Council in 1899, became a member of its executive committee by 1904, and served as the editor of its journal, the 'Women's Industrial News'. She was a member of the Fabian Society, serving on its executive committee between 1907 and 1912, and a founder member of the Fabian Women's Group in 1908. 
A prolific researcher, investigator, and author, Hutchins published at least twenty works between 1901 and 1917. Her meticulously researched works contain a wealth of statistics and information on the conditions of women's work, their wages, and the history of labour laws affecting them. Her book 'A History of Factory Legislation' (1903), co-written with Amy Harrison, provided detailed information about the development of factory regulations from their inception until 1901 and covered the campaigns for shorter hours, the extension of legislation to workshops, the creation of measures to safeguard the health and safety of workers, and special regulations for women. Hutchins viewed protective labour legislation as progressive reforms that reflected the state's responsibilities towards its female workers. This perspective led her to criticize middle-class 'women's rights' groups, as she called them, whose individualism led them to argue that protection violated women's freedom in the workplace. As a result she participated in the contemporary debate among women's organizations about the effects of protection on women workers. In his preface to this work, Sidney Webb praised it for being the first systematic treatment of the subject. By the time of Hutchins's death it was considered the standard work on factory legislation, and it has been routinely cited by historians ever since. 
Many of Hutchins's other publications dealt with the contemporary issues of women's home work and sweated labour. She contributed an article about a sweated industries exhibition held in Berlin in 1905 to the handbook for the Sweated Industries Exhibition held in London in 1906, an event intended to bring sweated labour to public and governmental attention. Her Fabian tract, 'Home Work and Sweating: the Causes and the Remedies', appeared in 1907. She also contributed to the Women's Industrial Council's investigation of home work, 'Home Industries of Women in London' (1908), the sections that examined legislative initiatives regarding home work in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. She supported the creation of minimum wage legislation for sweated trades. 
In 1907 and 1908 Hutchins delivered a series of lectures on women's work and public health. When the Women's Industrial Council offered a course at King's College entitled 'The relation of the state to women's work', in 1907 Hutchins lectured on the history of legislation affecting women in trade and industry. In the following year she presented four lectures at the London School of Economics on the nineteenth-century public health movement. The latter lectures were published in 1909 as 'The Public Health Agitation, 1833-1848'. 
During the pre-war years Hutchins was part of a wide network of social reformers actively working to improve the conditions of women's work. Her activities and writings brought her into contact with the Webbs, Margaret and Ramsay MacDonald, Clementina Black of the Women's Industrial Council, J. J. Mallon of the Anti-Sweating League, and Mary MacArthur of the Women's Trade Union League. 
Hutchins's career as a social investigator and writer ended with 'Women in Industry after the War' (1917). Thereafter she turned her attention and support towards the League of Nations, on whose committee she served. Formerly of Holland Park, London, Hutchins died at her home, 6 Granville Court, Granville Road, Eastbourne, on 17 October 1935. She had previously established a scholarship at the London School of Economics and provided for its permanent maintenance. 
Hutchins's obituary in 'The Times' characterized her as an accomplished woman with a wide circle of friends. She was a talented linguist and musician who enjoyed concerts, plays, and country walks. Friends and relatives described Bessie, as she liked to be called, as a woman who lived an unselfish life of private and civic service. Hutchins epitomizes the highly educated 'new woman' of the period who did not marry, but rather directed and devoted her immense energies and talents to a cause: the cause of working women.

Jenkins, Alice Brook (1886-1967), abortion campaigner, was born in Church Street, Ilkley, Yorkshire, on 4 December 1886, the daughter of Charlotte Glyde, a single mother and servant. She had five siblings, all of whom became involved in radical politics, her brother as an Independent Labour Party alderman and her four sisters in the suffragette movement. Academically gifted, she won a scholarship to a grammar school in her native Yorkshire, but could not afford to go to university and so pursued her education as a pupil-teacher, combining study with work. In 1907 she began a lifelong common-law partnership with William James Jenkins, an insurance manager. They moved to Ealing, west London, and had three children. 
In the mid-1920s Jenkins became involved with the Workers' Birth Control Group, an organization of feminist socialists, working women, and birth control advocates dedicated to extending working-class women's access to contraceptive information. She was also active in the Islington family clinic, which dispensed birth control information to working-class people. This encounter with the difficulties of sex and reproduction among working-class people convinced her that unsafe abortion was a pressing problem for working women. Her commitment to the reform of the abortion laws separated her from mainstream opinion in the birth control movement, but brought her closer to such figures as Stella Browne and Janet Chance. Like Browne and Chance, Jenkins was not interested in abortion as an isolated issue, but rather as a central element of a wider sea-change in English attitudes to sex and morality. In 1929 she told Dora Russell, for example, that she believed in a 'revision of the accepted morality of our generation', comprising 'freedom from cant and hypocrisy' (10 Nov 1929, 'Dora Russell papers', 7). That her own mother had been a single parent undoubtedly gave an added depth to Jenkins's belief in sexual and moral reform. 
In the 1930s Jenkins gained a wider reputation as a 'determined and devoted' advocate of birth control and abortion reform (Dora Russell to Madeleine Simms, 9 Feb 1968, 'Dora Russell papers', 345). In 1933 she organized a boisterous meeting at Ealing town hall to oppose a speech by the conservative Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton. But her greatest contribution was as a founding member of the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA). Jenkins served as honorary secretary of the association from 1936 until her retirement in 1962. If Janet Chance helped the ALRA as a propagandist and a source of funds, Jenkins was its organizational heart, sustaining it, often in the political wilderness, with an unbending commitment to the cause. She was the principal architect of a grassroots network of sympathetic members of the Women's Co-operative Guild and Labour Party women's sections. She nurtured this network even through the most desperate moments of the war, picking her way through rubble-strewn streets in the middle of the blitz to talk about abortion law reform to a handful of supporters. In the 1950s, after the ALRA had moved its focus to Westminster, Jenkins became a tireless and often fierce parliamentary lobbyist, keeping the abortion issue in the gaze of indifferent or hostile back-benchers. Though she always stressed that she was 'strictly non-party', it is clear that Jenkins's political sympathies lay with the left, particularly with the working women of the Labour Party and the Women's Co-operative Guild, which she saw as the lifeblood of the abortion cause (Alice Jenkins to Kathleen Child, 13 May 1957, contemporary medical archives, SA/ALR/A3/6/34). 
David Steel, the eventual sponsor of the successful 1967 'Abortion Bill', made clear that Jenkins's book 'Law for the Rich' (1960) had greatly influenced his support for the reform of the abortion law. In this work and an earlier publication, 'Conscript Parenthood? the Problem of Secret Abortion' (privately printed, 1938), Jenkins set the case for the legalization of abortion in the context of the conditions of working-class life. Abortion, she argued, was a fact of working-class existence because of poor economic conditions and lack of access to other forms of contraception. As the title of her later work suggested, Jenkins maintained that the practice of abortion in Britain was an example of an inequitable law. Middle-class women with means were generally able to obtain a safe, therapeutic abortion, while working-class women had to risk unsafe, illegal abortions in the backstreets. In both books Jenkins also proved herself an indefatigable foe of the religious opinion arrayed against sex reform, in particular the Catholic church. Jenkins believed that abortion should be an acceptable element of respectable life. As she said in 'Conscript Parenthood' (p. 72), it was 'the decent normal woman' who needed the 'relief' of abortion. 
Jenkins retired from an active role in the ALRA in 1962, when a younger generation took over its organization. She was also active in other causes, notably as the founder of the Anti-Litter League. As a particularly stout defender of Ealing's cleanliness, she would often apprehend litterers on Ealing Broadway, forcibly returning refuse to its original owners. After working for the reform of the abortion laws for nearly forty years, Alice Jenkins lived to see the achievement of her aim. She died of pneumonia at The Priory, Roehampton, London, on 25 December 1967, eight days after the 'Abortion Act' had received royal assent.

Palmer, Harold Edward (1877-1949), linguist and teacher of languages, was born on 6 March 1877 at 63 Wornington Road, North Kensington, London, the elder child of Edward Palmer ('b'. 1853), schoolmaster and (from 1890) newspaper proprietor, and his wife, Minnie, 'nee' Frostick ('b'. 1857). In the early 1880s his father moved the family back to his home town of Hythe in Kent, where he set up a school. Later he opened a stationery shop and in 1890 launched a local newspaper, the 'Hythe Reporter', a venture that provided his son with his first publishing opportunities. 
Harold Palmer's education began at local elementary schools, but he was withdrawn at the age of ten and tutored at home for three years. He spent two further years at a small private secondary school in Hythe before leaving for good in 1892 at the age of fifteen. His later adolescent years included a six-month exchange visit with a family in Boulogne (1892-3), but his time was largely spent pursuing personal interests like cycling, collecting fossils, playing the piano, and writing (mostly humorous) pieces for the 'Reporter'. In 1899 he took over the paper's editorship for two years but then left Hythe to pursue a teaching career abroad. 
By February 1902 Palmer was teaching English in a language school run on Berlitz (direct method) lines in Verviers, Belgium. The following year he established his own school, later known as the Institut Palmer, which flourished and in time came to occupy two separate sites in the town. On 19 November 1904 he married a local woman named Elisabeth Purnode ('b'. 1885), and a daughter, Dorothee, was born on 28 April 1905. 
During his time in Verviers, Palmer (who had no university training) set out on a determined course of self-education. He became a member of the local 'societe polyglotte' and started writing language teaching materials (his first book, 'Methode Palmer', an English course for French speakers, appeared in 1906). He deepened his linguistic studies by joining the International Phonetic Association and had the first of many contributions accepted by its journal 'Le Maitre Phonetique' in 1910, work that attracted the attention of Britain's leading twentieth-century phonetician, Daniel Jones of University College, London. 
Palmer and Jones met by chance on a cross-channel ferry in 1912, an encounter that proved helpful two years later when Palmer and his family, after being forced to escape hurriedly from German-occupied eastern Belgium, returned to England in straitened circumstances. After an attempt to start a school in Folkestone, Palmer took up a post teaching French in a London grammar school. He contacted Jones, who invited him to deliver a series of (extra-mural) lectures at University College on methods of language teaching, the success of which, plus Palmer's evident skill as a phonetician, encouraged Jones to employ him in the department. His duties included teaching spoken English and organizing a year-long course in language teaching methodology, the first of its kind at university level in Britain. Palmer's time at the college was unusually fruitful, and resulted in three substantial works that won him a lasting reputation as a leading thinker in the theory and practice of language teaching: 'The Scientific Study and Teaching of Languages' (1917), 'The Principles of Language-Study' (1921), and 'The Oral Method of Teaching Languages' (1921). 
Having established himself at home, Palmer moved on. He accepted a post as linguistic adviser to the Japanese ministry of education and in February 1922 left for Tokyo, where an Institute for Research in English Teaching (IRET) was set up with Palmer as its director. The decision to focus on research was unique for its time, and made imaginative use of Palmer's academic and practical expertise. After opening in May 1923, the institute attracted a substantial membership and started a monthly journal, the 'Bulletin'. IRET's basic aims were well summarized later by Palmer's Tokyo colleague A. S. Hornby: '(1) the compilation of English language courses; (2) the encouragement of reformed methods of language teaching; (3) the starting of research and experimental work in linguistic subjects, and (4) the training of teachers of English' (Hornby, 88). All IRET's work was underpinned by a strong theoretical framework derived from modern linguistics and psychology, in particular the ideas of Saussure and Bloomfield with their emphasis on spoken language, reflected in the titles of Palmer's major publications in the 1920s: 'English Intonation' (1922), 'A Grammar of Spoken English' (1924), 'English through Actions' (classroom oral exercises devised with his daughter Dorothee, 1925), 'A Dictionary of English Pronunciation' (1926), and 'The Five Speech-Learning Habits' (1927). 
From the late 1920s onwards Palmer became increasingly interested in text simplification and vocabulary control. Dissatisfied with the educational limitations of word-frequency statistics, he conducted a series of lexicological studies with broader pedagogical relevance, laying the groundwork for an innovative learner's dictionary combining both grammatical and lexical information. To extend his linguistic expertise (and publicize the institute), he undertook a lengthy lecturing tour in 1931-2 which took him to the United States, where he met Sapir and Bloomfield, both of whom became public supporters of his work in Tokyo. The culmination of these efforts came in 1935 with his participation in a working party (established in New York in 1934) to determine a definitive basic ('general service') word-list for English language teaching. The provisional list appeared in the 'Interim Report' (1936), but full publication was delayed until 1953. 
Now approaching sixty and with the international situation deteriorating, Palmer decided to return to England and he left Japan with a DLitt from Tokyo Imperial University in the spring of 1936. On their return the Palmers settled at Felbridge, on the Surrey-Sussex border, where Harold continued writing English language teaching materials, including 'The New Method Grammar' (1938) for young learners, which used railways as a metaphor for grammar (he even constructed a working model in his garden), and 'A Grammar of English Words' (1938). His last major work was his innovative 'International English Course' (1943 onwards), which unexpectedly adopted a bilingual approach to make it suitable for self-instruction purposes. Various versions appeared in the mid-1940s, but it became enmeshed in London publishing politics and was discontinued. 
In July 1942 Tristram, the Palmers' twenty-one-year-old son, was killed in action over the Netherlands while on a bombing mission. Harold Palmer never fully recovered from the shock, falling victim to serious depression and ill health (he had to return early from a lecturing tour of South America in 1944, for instance). He was also disappointed that his ideas for a British IRET fell on deaf ears. 
With the end of the Second World War, however, the influence of IRET began to emerge. The British Council founded 'English Language Teaching' using the IRET 'Bulletin' as its model, with Hornby as editor. Hornby also took responsibility for the dictionary Palmer had initiated in the 1930s (now the world-famous 'Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English'). In fact English language teaching in the 1950s and beyond reflected many of Palmer's pedagogical values: the emphasis on spoken language, for instance, the importance of ordered progression, and the need for effective classroom procedures. He died at his home, Coopers Wood, Felbridge, from acute heart failure on 16 November 1949, and was buried at Folkestone cemetery. His wife survived him. His death removed the man himself and with him the personality and charisma that had attracted so many people to him and to his ideas throughout his life.

Murdoch, Mary Charlotte (1864-1916), physician and suffragist, was born at 21 Institution Road, Elgin, on 26 September 1864, the youngest of seven children (three daughters and four sons) of William Murdoch (died 1871), solicitor, and his wife, Jane, 'nee' Macdonald (died 1887). She was educated by governesses at home before attending Weston House School, Elgin, and then boarded at Manor Mount Girls' Collegiate School, Forest Hill, London, after which she had tuition from Madame Troilliet in Lausanne. She returned home in 1883, and in 1885 took care of her widowed and invalid mother until the latter's death. A legacy from her mother enabled her to pursue her ambition to become a doctor. 
In 1888 Murdoch began her studies at the London School of Medicine, and ultimately obtained her qualifications in Scotland (after completing the third examination in 1892). After a midwifery course at the Maternity Hospital, Brighton, she gained experience as clinical assistant under Helen Webb in the outpatients' department of the New Hospital for Women, London, and attended Helen Mackenzie's outpatient department at Brompton Hospital. From 1893 to 1895 she was house-surgeon at Victoria Hospital for Children, Park Street, Hull, after which she spent a year at the Tottenham Fever Hospital where, under R. A. Birdwood, she gained experience in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. She returned to Hull in 1896 and became the first woman to practise medicine there. She set up in private practice, with additional consulting rooms in Grimsby, and was also senior physician at the Victoria Children's Hospital, Hull, where she showed a particular affinity with her young patients. From 1900 to 1906 her partner in private practice was Louisa Martindale, who later devoted a chapter of her autobiography to her association with Murdoch (or Murdie as she was known to her friends). A member of the British Medical Association after 1894, she was also active in the Association of Registered Medical Women and gave regular lectures to students at the London School of Medicine for Women. As a practitioner, she was known as a good diagnostician, and undertook scientific research into pericarditis and vaccine treatments. 
Murdoch became a prominent and influential figure in the civic life of Hull. She promoted infant welfare in the city, founding the first creche and a school for mothers, while encouraging the male dock workers to take an active part in child rearing. Concerned about the conditions of working women, she founded a branch of the National Union of Women Workers in 1905. Her campaigns to improve social conditions required courage and toughness. She was involved in a public controversy in 1911 as a result of a paper which she delivered on the need to improve standards of housing and welfare, using the example of the poor conditions prevailing in Hull; members of the Hull Corporation and its sanitation committee objected to the poor light in which Hull had been cast. She promoted the election of women onto borough councils and took part in a deputation to the home secretary urging the appointment of female police officers. She founded and became president of the Hull Women's Suffrage Society, a branch of Millicent Fawcett's National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), which promoted the cause by constitutional means. She refused, however, publicly to condemn acts of suffragette militancy, and resigned from the NUWSS when it did so, joining instead the Pankhursts' Women's Social and Political Union. Her friendship with Fawcett survived the rift. She attended several conferences of the International Council of Women, giving papers on 'Health and physical training' in Toronto (June 1909), 'Rights of citizenship' in Stockholm (September 1911), and 'Equal moral standards' in Rome (1914), the latter reflecting her involvement in the purity campaign. 
Energetic and tireless -- often taking only four or five hours' sleep -- Murdoch was fearless in her work and adventurous in her leisure. She was the first woman in Hull to own a car (a De Dion), which she drove at speed. She travelled widely, cycling across Belgium in 1902, and touring in Switzerland, Vienna, and Berlin with Louisa Martindale. Suffering recurring bouts of severe gastric illness since her time as a medical student, she became seriously ill in 1910 and underwent an operation. Her intentions to restrict her activities thereafter were not realized, and she continued to be a frequent public speaker. Shortly before her death, she was distressed by the closure of the infants' ward at the Victoria Hospital, and committed herself to raising the necessary funds to reopen it. Always interested in ethical matters, she joined the Church of England in 1914. 
Murdoch was taken ill after attending an emergency call in snowbound conditions and died from influenza, gastroenteritis, and peritonitis at her home, 102 Beverley Road, Hull, on 20 March 1916. Her funeral was held at All Saints' Church, Margaret Street, Hull, on 24 March 1916, followed by cremation at the Hull crematorium; a requiem mass at St Francis Mission Church, Sculcoates Lane, Hull, was attended by representatives of the numerous local voluntary bodies which she had supported.

Thurtle, Dorothy (1890-1973), campaigner for contraceptive and abortion rights, was born at 105 St Stephen's Road, Bow, east London, on 15 November 1890, the sixth child of the eight daughters and four sons of the working-class Labour politician George Lansbury (1859-1940), who at the time of her birth was recorded as being employed as a journeyman veneer dryer, and his wife, Elisabeth Jane (Bessie), 'nee' Brine (died 1933). Two of her siblings died in infancy. Like the other Lansbury children she was educated at an east London elementary school and grew up in a hothouse of 'fin de siecle' radical and working-class politics. She joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) at the age of sixteen and shortly after, employed as a clerk and an accountant, joined the National Union of Clerks. A member of the Women's Freedom League and the Women's Labour League, she was exasperated by the militant tactics of the suffragette movement, a position that caused some friction within her family, particularly with her brother William Lansbury, who was imprisoned in 1913 for window-breaking in support of the Women's Social and Political Union. Taking a position that would characterize her later work on abortion reform, she believed that political energies were better expended on working-class issues. 
Through her union activity Dorothy Lansbury met Ernest Thurtle ['see below']; she travelled to the USA, where he was working, and they married in Philadelphia on 13 August 1912. After returning to England early in 1914 they had a son, Peter, and a daughter, Helen. The Thurtles were political collaborators, co-authors of 'Comradeship for Clerks' (1913). Dorothy pursued a career in local politics in Shoreditch, the constituency which Ernest represented in parliament. General secretary of Shoreditch Trades Council and Labour Party, she was elected to Shoreditch borough council in 1925 and became mayor in 1936. Both she and Ernest positioned themselves on the left of Labour politics between the wars. 
The Thurtles were founding members of the Workers' Birth Control Group (WBCG) in 1924. This was an attempt to get the Labour Party to commit itself formally to the extension of working women's access to birth control information. In 1926 Ernest Thurtle presented an unsuccessful parliamentary bill to this end. For her part, Dorothy was a leading advocate of the cause within the Labour Party women's sections. She became deeply frustrated by the party's intransigence on the issue, arguing that it showed Labour's indifference to women's rights and made nonsense of the party's professed commitment to sex equality. In a memorable attack she said in 1926 that the party's leaders 'only have use for women so long as they have no opinions of their own but are willing to do the donkey work of the Party' ('Mrs Thurtle's protest', 'New Generation', April 1926, 40, quoted in S. Rowsbotham, 'A New World for Women: Stella Browne Socialist-Feminist', 1977, 35). The birth control campaign was a practical education in feminism for Thurtle, a lesson that stayed with her throughout her career. In 1945, for example, she compared women's position to that of slavery and spoke of them as an 'oppressed class' (D. Thurtle, 'Women: an oppressed class?', 'Labour Woman' 33/6, June 1945, 115). 
Like such other veterans of the WBCG as Alice Jenkins and Janet Chance, Dorothy Thurtle took up the cause of legal abortion in the 1930s. She was one of the first members of the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA) in 1936, serving as a vice-president until her retirement in 1962. Unlike other members of the ALRA, who tended to be Labour by covert sympathy rather than formal affiliation, Thurtle was a recognized local politician. Her greatest contribution to the cause of abortion rights was in her capacity as a member of the official interdepartmental committee on abortion, which sat under the chairmanship of Sir Norman Birkett between 1937 and 1939. The interdepartmental committee heard evidence from a wide variety of groups, including the medical profession, midwives, Labour women's sections, and the ALRA. Thurtle was the only unequivocal supporter within the committee of a radical revision of the law. When it published a final report recommending no major change in the law, Thurtle publicly dissented, issuing a minority report. In this she proposed that abortion be made legal in a number of circumstances on social grounds, particularly for women with high fertility rates. Thurtle was particularly sympathetic to the plight of working-class women 'at the mercy of their own fertility' (TNA: PRO, Ministry of Health MH71/30, Ministry of Health and Home Office, report of the interdepartmental committee on abortion, 1939, minority report). Though she had strong feminist leanings, her support for abortion was based as much on a concern for social justice between classes as for reproductive rights. What offended Thurtle was the inequality between the classes over access to abortion. She wrote in 'Abortion: Right or Wrong?' (1940): 'there is one practice for the well-to-do and another for the poor. Social justice demands equal facilities and treatment in this matter' (p. 27). This also sprang from her personal and political roots in the East End of London, and illustrates how working-class politics, socialism, and feminism could be wound together by abortion law reform. 
Thurtle remained active in the ALRA through the 1950s and early 1960s. She was also involved with the National Birth Control Council, which became the Family Planning Association, but retired from political work in 1962, when there was a generational changing of the guard within the ALRA. She lived to see the passing of the 1967 'Abortion Act', a reform for which she had long worked. She died at Napsbury Hospital, St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 28 February 1973. 
Dorothy Thurtle's husband, 
Ernest Thurtle returned to civilian life determined to follow a political career, and stood unsuccessfully as the National Federation of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers parliamentary candidate for Bethnal Green South-West at the general election of 1918. He represented former servicemen on the United Services Fund, which distributed aid. Defeated again in 1922, he was elected as Labour MP for Shoreditch in 1923. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the minister of pensions in 1924 and took the same role when his father-in-law was commissioner of works in 1929. He became a junior lord of the Treasury between 1930 and 1931. He lost his seat in the National Government's landslide of 1931, and worked as a brewers' representative, but returned to the Commons in 1935, representing Shoreditch (and, after 1950, Shoreditch and Finsbury) until his death. From 1941 to 1945 he was parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Information. 
Ernest Thurtle's greatest contribution to political life came early in his career. Appalled by the cruelty of military punishment during his time in the trenches, he spearheaded a campaign to abolish the death penalty for offences such as desertion and cowardice, also publishing two books on the question, 'Military Discipline and Democracy' (1920) and 'Shootings at Dawn' (1929). In 1924 he introduced a bill to abolish the death penalty in such cases, and achieved his aim in 1930, a considerable personal triumph that did much to humanize military justice in Britain. His anti-militarism in the early 1920s was also expressed in criticisms of the armistice day remembrance ceremonial and opposition to armed forces recruitment. A supporter of the League Against Imperialism, he visited India in 1928 and met Gandhi. In 1945 he published an autobiography, which omitted reference to many of the political positions which he had taken in the 1920s. He died at the Horton Hospital, Epsom, Surrey, on 22 August 1954.

Ullmann, Stephen (1914-1976), linguistic scholar, was born on 13 June 1914 in Hungary, where his father, Istvan Ullmann, was a senior civil servant. Ullmann read modern languages at the University of Budapest, from where he obtained a doctorate at the early age of twenty-two. In 1939 he married Susan Gaspar, with whom he had one son (Michael) and two daughters (Diana and Patricia). Stephen and Susan Ullmann left Hungary for the United Kingdom in 1939 and became permanently domiciled there as British citizens. 
From 1940 to 1946 Ullmann was employed by the BBC Monitoring Service. In 1946 he joined the University of Glasgow as lecturer in Romance philology and general linguistics, and was promoted to a senior lectureship in 1950, having been awarded the degree of DLitt in 1949. From Glasgow he moved to the University of Leeds, where he was successively professor of Romance philology (1953-64) and of French language and Romance philology (1964-8). From 1968 until his death he held the chair of Romance languages at the University of Oxford, and was simultaneously fellow of Trinity College. His international reputation earned him invitations to undertake lecture tours in many European countries, in circumstances are unknown. North America, and in India, and he held visiting professorships at the universities of Toronto (1964 and 1966) and Michigan (1965), and at the Australian National University (1974). From 1970 to 1976 he was president of the Philological Society. 
Ullmann's scholarly interests were broad and his knowledge encyclopaedic, but his research and publications fell into two main areas. The first was semantics, to which he had been introduced by one of his teachers at the University of Budapest, Zoltan Gombocz, and in which he did much pioneering work at a time when the study of meaning was somewhat neglected by theoretical linguists. Following the posthumous publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's 'Cours de linguistique generale' in 1916, theoretical linguistics, until then almost exclusively historical in its orientation, became primarily synchronic and descriptive. Recognizing this, Ullmann justifiably contended that semantics had largely escaped the impact of this revolution, since it continued to be concerned above all with the study of changes in meaning. The one significant exception to this generalization, he observed, was the development in Germany by Jost Trier and others, in the 1920s and the early 1930s, of the theory of semantic fields. It was largely through Ullmann's publications some two decades later that this approach to the study of meaning became more widely known to Western scholarship. 
Ullmann's approach to semantics was first set out at length in 1951 in 'The Principles of Semantics'. There he presents his view of the essence of the subject at that point in its development, and maintains a balance between descriptive and historical aspects. It had been preceded earlier in the same year by a more popular book on meaning and language, 'Words and their Use', which avoids discussion of theory. 
Following closely on 'Principles', Ullmann's 'Precis de semantique francaise' (1953) makes explicit its aim to present the principles of semantics to a wider public by applying them to French, although the audience envisaged, unlike that of 'Words and their Use', is clearly academic. This time the balance was tipped much more towards the synchronic side. Despite its apparently modest intentions, this book contains much that is new in comparison with its predecessor and develops considerably further some of the ideas contained in the author's earlier writings -- notably on synonymy, polysemy, and homonymy, and the problems involved in distinguishing between the last two of these. 'Motivation' in language is also extensively discussed. Taking as his starting point Saussure's insistence on the essentially arbitrary nature of the linguistic sign, under which view the relationship between a word and its meaning is entirely conventional, Ullmann aims to show that, on the contrary, the meaning attached to a linguistic symbol can be motivated at three different levels -- the phonetic (in cases where it is possible to speak of onomatopoeia or sound symbolism), the morphological (where complex forms are understood from a knowledge of the meaning of their component parts), and the semantic (where words take on new meanings because of perceived similarities between entities, as when one speaks, for instance, of the 'head' of an institution). A further point of discussion is the way in which it is possible to distinguish between 'intellectual' and 'affective' meaning, because of the existence in all languages of devices for conveying emotional overtones. Arguing that the presence of these various features occurs in different proportions in different languages, Ullmann developed his theory of semantic typology, showing in this context that French is typologically different from, say, German. Consideration of typology later led him to prepare a paper on semantic universals (1963). 
In 'Semantics: an Introduction to the Science of Meaning' (1962) there is less theoretical discussion, the book being intended mainly for non-specialists. The main themes of the two earlier books are taken up again, but discussed in language rather less technical. There is an attempt, too, to show how the subject had developed since the publication of his first major book, for Ullmann was always at pains to present his own theories in the broader context. 
Somewhat unusually for a general linguist, Ullmann concerned himself extensively with language as used in literature as well as with what one might by contrast refer to as everyday, non-creative language. Many points in his books and articles on semantics are illustrated with quotations from literary works, especially poetry. Where such items occur, one is not far removed from a discussion of style. It is therefore not surprising that the second of his two principal research interests should be stylistics. Ullmann is sometimes held to have worked first in semantics and then turned his allegiance mainly to stylistics. In fact the two strands run in parallel throughout his published work, with articles in both spheres first appearing in the mid-1940s. The closeness of the two in his mind is symbolized by the titles of his two books of collected papers, 'Language and Style' (1964) and 'Meaning and Style' (1973). His stylistic work was first directed to French poetry, and there are early articles on Racine, Hugo, Leconte de Lisle, Vigny, and Musset. Later he turned his attention to the novel, and this is the subject of his two books 'Style in the French Novel' (1957) and 'The Image in the French Novel: Gide, Alain-Fournier, Proust, Camus' (1960). The first alternates between the treatment of a theme (for example, word order) over a number of novels and an analysis of some aspect of a single novel: in the book as a whole, twenty novels by seventeen authors, mostly belonging to the nineteenth century, are examined. In his work on style Ullmann aimed to construct a bridge between the type of stylistics which is concerned with the expressive resources of a language as a whole and the type which looks at the variety of the language that is the particular creation of a given author. His own studies, however, concentrate on the latter. In the first of the two books, he looked at the linguistic world presented in a single novel, while the second was more concerned with the linguistic world of an author's total output. 
In both his domains of endeavour -- semantics and stylistics -- Ullmann was something of a pioneer. This was not in the sense that he was a creator of the disciplines, but in the sense that, in the first case, he did much to revive an important and neglected area of linguistics, and, in the second, he did much to strengthen a fledgeling subject. He was zealous in promoting both, seeing the former as 'the youngest branch of modern linguistics' ('The Principles of Semantics', 1) and the latter as the 'new science of style' ('Style in the French Novel', vii). He did not strive solely for novelty or originality. His extraordinarily wide reading had given him not only an exceptional knowledge of those who had contributed studies on topics germane to his interests, but also an appreciation of the value of their work. His own research was never conducted in isolation, for he had total familiarity with the work of his contemporaries. When reviewing the work of others, he always attempted, even where he disagreed with the trend of a book's argument, to highlight what was positive and insightful. 
Stephen Ullmann died on 10 January 1976 of a coronary thrombosis in the Evans Lane post office, near his home in Kidlington, Oxfordshire. He was described by those who knew him as a dominating presence who at the same time was shy and modest, as a man who was generous with his time to students and colleagues, as a brilliant and inspiring lecturer who yet suffered from stage fright, and as an academic who worked in fields that encouraged controversy but who made no enemies.

Milligan, Francis Sydney (1894-1965), adult educationist, was born on 18 September 1894 at 5 Grosvenor Square, Poulton-cum-Seacombe, Birkenhead, the son of Alexander M'Call Milligan, a commercial clerk, and his wife, Emily Cummine. Educated at Wallasey grammar school in Cheshire, he won a scholarship to Liverpool University in 1914 but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. As a pacifist Frank Milligan initially joined the ambulance corps as a stretcher-bearer but, after a few weeks in France, he enlisted in the 7th King's regiment (Liverpool). Awarded the Military Medal as an NCO he was subsequently commissioned, won the Military Cross, and finished the war with the rank of major. 
In 1918 Milligan resumed his education at the University of Birmingham, where he was awarded an MA degree for a thesis entitled 'Politics and industry within the state: a plea for evolution in place of revolution'. As president of the university's guild of students he was a member of the small group which established the National Union of Students in 1920. On graduation he spent four years teaching for the Workers' Educational Association, where he forged a lifelong commitment to adult education and local voluntary action. In 1924 he was headhunted to become warden of Beechcroft educational settlement in Birkenhead, where he relished the multifaceted role of warden which ranged from 'defining a common purpose' for the settlement's disparate user groups to 'acting as an odd-job man' (Milligan, 'The years between', 87). 
On 14 June 1922 he married Gwendoline Mary ('b'. 1899/1900), daughter of James Henry Spencer, a schoolmaster; they had two sons. Increasingly preoccupied by the needs of the unemployed, Milligan resigned as warden in 1933 to launch a bold and imaginative experiment in residential adult education. At Wincham Hall, a country house near Northwich in Cheshire, he ran six-week courses for groups of men from the unemployed clubs of south-west Lancashire and Cheshire. The programme combined practical instruction and technical education with discussion groups on social affairs and cultural activities. This successful experiment was based on Milligan's distinctive educational philosophy that 'individuals must be free to choose their own way of education' and that 'no-one shall nourish his own interests in isolation but shall put them increasingly to the service of the community' (Milligan, 'Wire in the blood', 25). 
The Wincham Hall experiment was brought to a premature end by the outbreak of war in 1939, when Milligan found himself unexpectedly running a hostel for evacuated women and children. The following year he rejoined the army as a welfare officer before becoming, in 1942, a full-time lecturer for Liverpool University's regional committee for forces education. In 1944 Milligan was appointed the first secretary of the National Council of Social Service's newly established community centres department which became the secretariat for the National Federation of Community Associations in 1945. The war had given a new impetus to the development of neighbourhood community associations and the educational value of community centres had been recognized by the Ministry of Education. But the high hopes of 1945 rapidly gave way to the harsh reality of post-war Britain; restrictions on the use of skilled labour for construction and constraints on educational expenditure meant slow progress in building new community centres and developing a professional cadre of centre wardens. 
Despite these problems the community associations movement grew to maturity during the fifteen years of Milligan's leadership of the federation. In 1945 the federation had eighty-five members and was in contact with a total of 400 local groups. By 1958 the membership was nearing 400 and the total number of groups with which it worked exceeded 1650. These achievements owed much to Milligan's 'imaginative, patient efforts to translate ideals into practical achievement... his grasp of principle and his understanding of human diversity' (Brasnett, 113) and his 'tolerance, tenacity and humanity' (Hutchinson, 16). Milligan was appointed OBE in 1958, and he retired in 1959, but he retained an active interest in adult education until his death at Cheriton, Alexandra Road, St Ives, Cornwall, of lung cancer, on 18 August 1965. His wife survived him.

Jones, Geraint Iwan (1917-1998), organist and conductor, was born on 16 May 1917 in Porth, Glamorgan, the elder son of Evan Jones, a professor of ancient languages at Cardiff University who became a minister in the Welsh Congregational church, and his wife Caroline Davies, formerly a hospital nurse. Evan Jones, a charismatic preacher with the 'hwyl', did not approve of his son's musical interests, but the boy received encouragement at Caterham School and at the age of sixteen won a scholarship to Cambridge; against his father's wishes he turned it down, and in 1935 became a student at the Royal Academy of Music. He studied the piano with Harry Isaacs and the organ with G. D. Cunningham (for whom he retained a lifelong admiration), was awarded the Sterndale Bennett scholarship in 1937, and graduated in 1939. On 24 June 1940 he married Margaret Audrie Kemp (1913/14-2001), daughter of Allen Frederick Kemp, engineer, and a fellow student at the Royal Academy. They had one daughter. 
Ineligible on medical grounds for military service Jones made his debut as an organist in 1940, playing the six trio sonatas of J. S. Bach at the wartime National Gallery concerts organized by Myra Hess. During the same year he gave more than thirty solo organ recitals for the BBC and soon built a reputation as one of the most remarkable organists of his generation: while not excluding the virtuoso repertory of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, he concentrated on the baroque period, and during the London season of 1945-6 gave the complete organ works of J. S. Bach in sixteen recitals. In 1948 he made the first of many tours in the USA and Canada. After a recital tour in Germany in 1949 he was engaged by the BBC to record performances on the 1687 Schnitger organ at Steinkirchen near Hamburg; these, and subsequent broadcasts and recordings on other European organs of historical importance, did much to swing public taste away from the grandiose instruments of the Victorian period and encourage an interest in the more intimate sound of the baroque organ -- in whose post-war revival he became a leading figure. His activities at this period also included work as a music producer for EMI. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in divorce, on 7 April 1949 he married the violinist Winifred Roberts, with whom he gave frequent recitals. 
In 1951 the actor Bernard Miles invited Jones to conduct performances of Purcell's 'Dido and Aeneas' at the Mermaid Theatre, a converted schoolroom in the garden of Miles's home in St John's Wood, London; the Wagnerian soprano Kirsten Flagstad, a friend of Miles's, sang the role of Dido, and the distinguished cast also included Maggie Teyte, Thomas Hemsley, Edith Coates, and Arda Mandikian. With characteristic regard for scholarly detail, Jones made his own edition of the score and directed from the harpsichord; though the casting of the principal female roles was distinctly unconventional, the performance bore the stamp of impeccable musicianship. It was recorded for the gramophone (Elisabeth Schwarzkopf replacing Maggie Teyte), repeated in the following year, and transferred to the Royal Exchange in 1953. 
It was from the musicians who played in the 'Dido' performances that Jones formed the Geraint Jones Singers and Orchestra, with whom he appeared as both conductor and soloist: their cycle of twelve Bach concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in 1955 marked the beginning of an annual series that lasted for over thirty years, and their many recordings included the Italian version of Gluck's 'Alceste' (with Flagstad again in the title role) in 1956, and two awards of the grand prix du disque in 1959 and 1966. As well as conducting, Jones was still touring widely as a solo performer, travelling as often as possible in one of the succession of classic Rolls-Royces that he drove with such pleasure, but in 1960 he was thrown from his car in an accident and permanently damaged his back; as a result he found it increasingly difficult to maintain the posture needed to control the feet in organ playing, and in later life appeared comparatively rarely in public as an organist, though he continued to record for the BBC in Germany, Spain, and elsewhere and appeared frequently at the harpsichord (particularly in America, and often in joint recitals with his wife). He remained in demand as an organ consultant, designing instruments for the Royal Northern College of Music, the Royal Academy of Music (at Marylebone parish church), the University of St Andrews, the Tsin Sha Tsui concert hall, and the Academy for Performing Arts in Hong Kong. In 1985 he published translations of Francois-Henri Clicquot's 'Theorie pratique de la facture d'orgues' and Robert Davy's 'Les grandes orgues de l'abbatiale de St. Etienne de Caen'. 
In 1960 Jones launched the annual Lake District Festival, of which he remained musical director until 1978; he later became artistic director of the Salisbury Festival of the Arts (1972-7) and the Manchester International Organ Festival (1977-87). He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1957 and taught the harpsichord there from 1961 to 1987, but his interest in young musicians found its most practical expression in his work with the Kirckman Concert Society, founded in 1963 to provide a platform for outstanding young artists. Though he could be impatient with less gifted performers, he was a shrewd judge and generous encourager of genuine talent, and his role as the first musical director of the Kirckman Society was one that he valued highly and retained until his death. 
In later life Jones was known mainly as a conductor and harpsichordist. Though widely recognized as a baroque specialist, he had little time for what he regarded as the 'authenticity craze', believing that imaginative musicianship was infinitely more important than historical dogma. As an organist he was, until his motor accident at least, a virtuoso of exceptional brilliance with a highly unconventional pedal technique; he stood quite outside the established tradition of the English cathedral organist and, apart from minor appointments in early life, never held a regular position as organist or choirmaster. His instinctive feeling for acoustics enabled him to develop a legato rare in organ playing, and he was one of the few performers capable of coaxing genuine musical expression from that notoriously intractable instrument. His love of the fine craftsmanship intrinsic to organ building extended in private life to Romanesque architecture and eighteenth-century furniture; he was a passionate traveller, a connoisseur of wine, and a convivial host with an impish sense of humour. He died, as the result of a stroke, at St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, Westminster, on 3 May 1998, and was cremated at Marylebone crematorium. He was survived by his second wife, Winifred, and by the daughter of his first marriage.

Mellish, Robert Joseph, Baron Mellish (1913-1998), politician, was born on 3 March 1913 at 63 Giffin Street, Deptford, the thirteenth of fourteen children (of whom only six survived) of John Mellish, docker, and his wife, Mary, 'nee' Carroll. Close proximity to death in childhood was the trigger for a crusade to improve conditions for families in east London, and one of Mellish's causes in later life was the North-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board: 'half my brothers and sisters died from scarlet fever and meningitis' (personal knowledge). His father had taken a prominent part in the dock strikes of 1889 and 1912 and was a founder member of the Labour Party. Mellish himself joined the party at sixteen, two years after he had left St Joseph's Roman Catholic School, Deptford, to work as a clerk in the docks. He was active in the Transport and General Workers' Union, and in 1938 became a full-time official in its docks section. On 15 October in the same year he married Annie Elizabeth ('b'. 1912/13), daughter of George Warner, docker; they had five sons. 
In 1940 Mellish was enlisted in the dockworkers' battalion of the Royal Engineers and served for much of the war in Burma as part of the 'forgotten' Fourteenth Army. He ended the war as captain. One of the reasons for his later good relations with the tories in the House of Commons -- despite colourful verbal abuse in east London vernacular -- was that the knights of the shires saw him as exactly the genre of Londoner who fitted their idea of the quintessential working-class Labour MP. But another part of the tory acceptance of him was that decorated guards, cavalry, and naval officers such as William Whitelaw, Francis Pym, and Humphrey Atkins, successively his opposite number as tory chief whip, recognized that he and they had fought in the same war, side by side, against the same enemy. 
On the unexpected resignation of the minister for food, Sir Ben Smith, in May 1946 and his decision subsequently to leave the House of Commons, Mellish was selected as Labour's standard-bearer in Rotherhithe, a constituency that had shrunk to a 22,000 electorate as a result of the blitz. He won the ensuing by-election, on 19 November 1946, by 7265 votes to 2821 for the Liberal Fred Martell and 1084 for the Conservative Freddy Burden, later MP for Gillingham. He held the seat (expanded in 1950 to Bermondsey) as a fiefdom for the next thirty-six years. His maiden speech, on 16 December 1946, was in support of the government's plans to nationalize transport. After the Labour losses in the general election of 1950 he got his foot on the ladder by being appointed parliamentary private secretary to George Strauss, minister of supply, and then, from January to November 1951, to George Isaacs, minister of pensions. Years later he would say: 'What matters is bleeding loyalty, especially when you know that the Minister is wrong!' (personal knowledge). He was also active in the London Labour Party, a raucous organization of which he became chairman in 1956 at the behest of Herbert Morrison. 
In October 1964 Harold Wilson, as incoming prime minister, had the inspiration of teaming up Mellish with the Oxford intellectual Richard Crossman at the Ministry of Housing. Mellish was described as 'the best thing that ever happened to Crossman' ('The Times'). The kind of issue that mattered to him was protection from eviction to deal with the Rachmanism of the time. Both at Housing and later as minister of public building and works, from August 1967, he supported the work of the Building Research Station, to combat dampness and hasten slum clearance. For seven eventful years from April 1969 he was Labour chief whip -- first in government, then from 1970 to 1974 in opposition, and again in government. As 'The Times' obituarist put it, 'His appointment proved a master-stroke; his combination of warmth... and toughness gained the respect of Members throughout the parliamentary party and particularly among left-wingers'. The truth was that the left felt inhibited with having a sustained animosity against a man with impeccable union working-class credentials. On several occasions he asked Wilson to move him to another post but each time he was persuaded to stay. He finally resigned in April 1976, having supported Michael Foot in the leadership contest following Wilson's resignation. 
Mellish's final years in the Commons were dogged by controversy and beset with troubles in Bermondsey from hard-left 'yuppie' incomers and the Militant Tendency, people who were moons apart from the dockers who had selected him four decades earlier. When Mellish announced in 1981 that he would not stand again for election Peter Tatchell, a leading figure on the hard left, was chosen by the local party as prospective candidate. Labour's National Executive Committee initially refused to endorse Tatchell's candidature but in the following year acquiesced. Mellish -- who was already facing disciplinary proceedings for supporting unofficial or independent labour candidates against left-wing official candidates at local elections -- resigned from the Labour Party and from the House of Commons, precipitating a by-election which was won by Simon Hughes, for the Liberal and Social Democrat Alliance. 
Mellish was deputy chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation from 1981 to 1985; it was his determination to devote himself full-time to this post that had led to his decision to leave the House of Commons. Following his retirement he was made a life peer, as Baron Mellish of Bermondsey. He sat as an independent, but according to one critic 'always voiced Thatcherite views' ('The Guardian'). Nevertheless he was (as he had been throughout his career) an outspoken pro-European. He was a keen supporter of Millwall Football Club, becoming its president. A leading Roman Catholic, he was made a papal knight of the order of St Gregory the Great in 1959. He was a devoted family man. In his last years he suffered from cancer and Parkinson's disease. He died at his home, Rectory House, West Street, Sompting, Sussex, on 9 May 1998; his remains were cremated. He was survived by his wife, Annie, and four of their five sons.

Fashanu, Justinus Soni (1961-1998), footballer, was born at Hackney Hospital, London, on 19 February 1961, the son of Patrick Ayo Fashanu, a Nigerian law student, and his wife, Pearl Ophelia, 'nee' Lawrence, a nurse from British Guiana. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 3 Shellgrove Road, Stoke Newington. He was one of four children (Justin, his younger brother John, and their half-brother Philip and half-sister Dawn) who were eventually placed in care when their mother's relationship with Patrick Fashanu ended. Justin and John spent time in a Dr Barnardo's children's home before being fostered in the summer of 1965 by Betty and Alf Jackson, Londoners then domiciled in Attleborough, Norfolk. 
As an adolescent, Fashanu's first love was boxing. Unable to apply for a professional licence until he was seventeen, at sixteen -- working briefly as steel erector -- he accepted an offer of a football apprenticeship from Norwich City after starring in schoolboy soccer, intending to use it as a temporary fitness platform for a career in the ring. He was later self-deprecatory about his football skills: 'The reason I became a footballer was simple: I could run faster than anybody else, that's about it. I didn't have any skill whatsoever, but I could run with the ball and hold it' (Cashmore, 57). The tall, teenaged Fashanu soon punched his way into the first team. If the dream of a boxing career had been subsumed by the reality of success on the football pitch, his muscular, lion-hearted style represented the nearest there was to a fusion of the two sports. 
Fashanu literally shot his way into football's national consciousness when he won 'Match of the Day''s 'goal of the season' in 1980, for a spectacular goal against Liverpool. An England Under-21 call-up came the same year, and he went on to make eleven appearances for the England Under-21 team, scoring five goals. After ninety appearances and thirty-five goals for Norwich, a move to Nottingham Forest, as the first black footballer to command a $1 million transfer fee, followed in 1981. However, Forest manager Brian Clough soon expressed a lack of confidence in the twenty-year-old; Fashanu's biographer believes Clough may have been influenced by persistent rumours of Fashanu's alleged frequent presence at a Nottingham gay club. This seriously affected his form. An average of a goal nearly every other game at Norwich was reduced to one in ten (three goals in thirty-two appearances) at Forest. Banned from the training ground by Clough, he once tried to take part, resulting in Clough calling the police to eject him. Clough later admitted, 'I should have dealt with Fashanu differently, certainly with a little more compassion and understanding' (Read, 76). After being loaned out, eventually rivals Notts County paid $150,000 for him. His goal average improved dramatically to nearly one in three (twenty goals in sixty-four appearances). It was at this time that he became a born-again Christian. He also became engaged, while rumours of his homosexuality continued in the press and football industry. Following his three seasons (1982-5) at County and two (1985-7) at Brighton and Hove Albion came an unsettled meandering that took him around England, Scotland, Australia, the USA, Canada, Sweden, and New Zealand: a search for form and consistency with the hope that, on return, some kind of general stability would also result. It never happened. 
In 1990 Fashanu announced publicly via a tabloid newspaper interview that he was gay. This created a rift with his brother John, now also a professional footballer, who felt his openness would affect his career detrimentally: 'No football club will touch him now' (Read, 115). While John Fashanu's prediction was not accurate -- his brother's football career continued for another seven years, including two years (1991-3) at Torquay United, for whom he scored fifteen goals in forty-one appearances -- his prediction of an intolerant, hostile reaction from the football industry had an element of truth. It was a brave highlight in a tumultuous career that promised much more than was delivered. 
In 1994 Fashanu (then playing for Heart of Midlothian) was the subject of much tabloid attention when he tried to sell stories of sexual liaisons with a married Conservative MP (allegations which he subsequently retracted). Sacked by Heart of Midlothian, he spent two years playing for Atlanta Ruckus in the USA and one season playing for Miramar Rangers in New Zealand before announcing his retirement from the game. In 1997 he moved to Ellicott City, Maryland, to coach Maryland Mania, a newly established team. In March 1998 a seventeen-year-old claimed to police in Maryland that he had been sexually assaulted by Fashanu. Fashanu, who admitted having sexual relations with the young man but always claimed that the sex was consensual, was questioned by the police but not formally charged. Nevertheless he fled to England, fearing that he was the target of blackmail. On 2 May 1998 he hanged himself in a lock-up garage he had broken into, in Fairchild Place, Shoreditch, leaving a note protesting his innocence of any charge of assault. At his inquest, it was revealed that the Maryland police had already dropped the investigation, owing to a lack of evidence. Sadly, Fashanu's courage as Britain's first openly gay male British professional footballer (which was still the case at the time of his death) had not led to a more sexually tolerant environment in male professional football in the UK. In 2009 a football team, the Justin Fashanu All-Stars, was formed in his honour in Brighton.

Oldisworth, Nicholas (bap. 1611, d. 1645), Church of England clergyman and poet, was born at the home of his grandfather Sir Nicholas Overbury in Bourton on the Hill, Gloucestershire, and baptized in the parish church on 14 July 1611, the elder son of Robert Oldisworth of Coln Rogers, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Merial, sister of Sir Thomas Overbury. 
Oldisworth was educated at Westminster School under the headship of Lambert Osbaldeston, who encouraged his verse writing. While at Westminster he developed a close friendship with Richard Bacon, who proceeded as a king's scholar to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1628 but left after a year for training at Douai. Oldisworth kept up his contact with his friend, addressing many poems to him and to his siblings; he was deeply affected by Bacon's death from the plague in 1636. 
From Westminster Oldisworth moved, as a king's scholar, to Christ Church, Oxford, in July 1628. He matriculated on 24 February 1632, in time to take his BA on 24 April and to be incorporated at Cambridge University. His MA followed in 1635, by which time he had already been presented with the living at Bourton on the Hill by his grandfather. 
Most if not all of Oldisworth's more than 120 poems were written while he was at Christ Church. Only two were published in his lifetime, in university commemorative volumes in 1633: 'Solis Britannici Perigaeum' and 'Vitis Carolinae gemma altera'. A poem to Ben Jonson, paying tribute to his influence, appeared in 'Wit Restor'd' (1658), an anthology by Sir John Mennes. Few of the poems display the brittle wittiness valued by Oldisworth's contemporaries but, with an often engaging awkwardness, the collection as a whole evinces an unexpected sensitivity to personal, domestic, and familial relationships. 
The fate of Sir Thomas Overbury appears to have haunted the family; Oldisworth himself gathered material relating to the trial of his uncle's murderers. He records reading the manuscript to his aged grandfather, Sir Nicholas Overbury, on 9 October 1637 and includes the old man's comments. Oldisworth also kept a manuscript fair copy of his moderately Laudian sermons (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. th. f. 20). Because he used sermons more than once he meticulously recorded when and where he preached them. 
Oldisworth married in 1640. He and his wife, Mary (died 1684), had three daughters: Mary ('bap'. 6 Jan 1641), Frances ('bap'. 11 June 1642, 'bur'. 28 Nov 1643), and Margaret ('bap'. 8 Feb 1644). Mary married a Londoner, and became Mistress Sherwood; Margaret married John Mann of Tewkesbury. 
As a moderate royalist Oldisworth expressed his bewilderment at the course of public events and their effects on people's lives. During the plague of 1644 and 1645 he appears to have moved his family to Willington in Warwickshire, near Shipston-on-Stour and about 11 miles from Bourton on the Hill. He occupied himself with preparing a manuscript fair copy of his poems, entitled 'A Recollection of Certain Scattered Poems', for presentation to his wife; the dedicatory epistle is dated 24 February 1645. (The volume -- Bodl. Oxf., MS Don. c. 24 -- was inherited by his daughter Margaret, who used it to record recipes.) 
Oldisworth continued with his pastoral duties, preaching perhaps for the last time in Burmington, Warwickshire, on 16 March 1645. He died at Willington, of the plague, on 25 March 1645 and was buried the next day in the chancel of the nearby church at Barcheston. The church having been refurbished, there is now no trace of his grave. His death is recorded in Barcheston parish register and, more fulsomely, by his brother, Giles, in Bourton on the Hill parish register.

Samber, Robert (bap. 1682, d. c.1745), writer and translator, was baptized on 20 April 1682 at Lymington, Hampshire, the son of Samuel Samber (died 1716) of Lymington, surgeon, and Susannah Legg of Fawley. The Samber 'clan' was affluent and influential (a number of seventeenth-century Sambers became mayors of Lymington). Given this social milieu it is rather surprising to find that Robert, unlike his elder brother Samuel, was brought up as a Roman Catholic (perhaps because of his mother's religion). While Samuel went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, Robert had to go abroad to acquire an education. On 11 July 1705 he entered the English College at Rome, presumably after spending some time at the English College at Douai -- he might be the Robert Samber who received a pass to visit Holland on 17 September 1703. He left again on 15 April 1706 without taking orders. 
Back in England Samber started on a literary career by publishing a meditation in verse entitled 'On the Passion of our Blessed Saviour' (1708). In the preface he talks about religious experiences during his stay at the English College at Rome and laments 'the new fashionable humour of squaring mysteries of Christianity by human reason'. Very quickly life must have taught him that the only way to make a living by writing was to adapt to the taste of the time. Most prominent in his next extant publication, 'Poems on Several Subjects' (1714), are imitations of Horace and epigrams in the true Augustan manner. Subsequently Samber engaged in all kinds of other literary activities that one associates with 'Grub Street'. The range is extensive: from religious verse, medical handbooks, plays, books on architecture and economic history, devotional treatises, and pornography to wedding odes. He used his knowledge of Roman Catholic literature in adapting a popular tract of Jeremias Drexelius for the English market ('A Devout Christian's Hourly Companion', 1716, and subsequent editions), cutting out all the too obviously Roman Catholic elements. He introduced England to two of the most advanced books on midwifery of his time (by Henry van Deventer). 
As one of Edmund Curll's hack writers Samber translated Jean Barrin's 'Venus dans le cloitre, ou, La religieuse en chemise' (again using his inside knowledge of things Catholic) and thus became involved in the major obscenity case of the century: in 1725 Curll was accused of publishing obscene books among which was Samber's translation. After lengthy legal proceedings Curll was fined 25 marks for each offence in February 1728, but, Curll being Curll, 'Venus in the Cloister' was again advertised in 1735. Samber instigated the publication of the correct text of Herman Boerhaave's 'Methodus discendi medici' by publishing a garbled version; he was the adapter and translator of literary 'curiosities', such as Charles Ancillon's 'Traite des eunuques'; and he was responsible for the English text of Charles Perrault's fairy tales which has never been out of print from 1729 to date. Many of his works, such as 'The Courtier', translated from the original by Castiglione, demonstrate that he was a very competent translator -- having French, Latin, and Italian -- and that he was highly interested in the problems posed by editing and translating. In the preface to 'The Courtier' he shows an intimate knowledge of the English publishing history of Castiglione, and discusses past and present English versions. Samber has also recently been attributed with 'The Touchstone' (1728), written by 'a person of some Taste and Quality'. The work, often identified as by James Ralph, criticized the moral poverty of modern drama. 
Samber's papers, preserved in the Bodleian Library, also give an impression of all the numerous projects that did not reach publication, such as a number of plays and translations of Ovid's 'Metamorphoses' and the homilies of Pope Clement XI. Among the papers are many draft letters to Samber's patrons (notably to John, duke of Montagu, and to members of the Catholic Howard dynasty) that give a unique insight into the day-to-day reality of the patronage system in the early eighteenth century. In order to ingratiate himself with Montagu Samber dedicated books to him, among them 'Long Livers' (1722; a translation of a work by Harcouet de Longville); in the preface Samber presents himself as an eager proselyte to the fraternity of freemasons, of whom Montagu was grand master. Furthermore, among both his published and unpublished works there are 'poetic congratulations' on births and weddings in the Montagu family and some of Samber's letters suggest that he was engaged by Montagu to act on his behalf in complicated legal issues. It is interesting to speculate why, in another pseudonymous publication (a translation, published in 1723 of 'L'eloge de l'yvresse' by A. H. de Sallengre), Samber mercilessly ridicules the drinking habits of the fraternity of which his patron was a prominent member. Robert Samber died about 1745.

Ghose, Manmohan (1869-1924), poet and university teacher, was born on 19 January 1869 at Bhagalpur, Bihar, India, the second son of Krishna Dhan Ghose (1844-1892/3), a civil medical officer in Bengal, and his wife, Swarnalata Basu ('b'. 1852), the eldest daughter of Rajnarayan Basu (1826-1899), a popular and distinguished poet and the first historian of Bengali literature. His younger brother was Sri Aurobindo (Aravinda) Ghose (1872-1950), the politician and spiritual leader. His parents belonged to Brahmo Samaj, a Hindu reformist movement opposed to the traditional practice of suttee, and his father, who had studied at Aberdeen University, was also an Anglophile who employed an English governess and deeply admired the English character. 
In 1877 Manmohan and his brothers were sent by their father to Loreto convent school at Darjeeling to be taught by Catholic nuns; Krishna Dhan Ghose wanted them to be at a distance from their mother, who as a result of repeated bouts of insanity would subject her children to extreme physical torture. In 1879 the family visited England and the boys were sent to live in Manchester in the house of the Revd William Drewett, a kind and learned Congregational minister who taught them Latin and Greek and read the Elizabethan poets with them. Manmohan, a brilliant scholar, was educated at Manchester grammar school (1881-4) and St Paul's School in London (1884-7). In London he knew Laurence Binyon, the poet, who remained his closest friend for the rest of his life. Binyon was amazed at Ghose's passion for Greek verse, his vast knowledge of English literature, and the skill and subtlety of the English poems he was writing. 
Manmohan won an open scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, which he hesitated to take up: his father, though a prosperous and philanthropic doctor, had many calls on his income, supported a great number of impoverished relations, and was harassed and distraught by the growing mental illness of his wife. Manmohan nevertheless went up to Oxford in Michaelmas 1887 with the intention of studying classics. He had almost no money and lodged among rich and fashionable undergraduates. He found himself unable to pay the tuition fees and lived a solitary and ascetic life, writing verse in his rooms and living on bread and butter. In the vacations he and his brothers stayed at 128 Cromwell Road, London, the office of the South Kensington Liberal Club, whose secretary was J. S. Cotton, editor of 'The Academy', who was born in India and sensitive to the plight of the Ghose brothers. Manmohan began work on a rich and colourful Indian story, 'Prince Pomegranate', but he was lonely in London. Sympathizing with his friend's sense of isolation, Binyon introduced him to Selwyn Image, who designed the cover for the forthcoming anthology of poems 'Primavera', and to Arthur Galton of the 'Hobby Horse' circle. Ghose obtained a second class in classical moderations in 1889 but, deeply in debt to Oxford moneylenders, did not return to Christ Church in autumn 1889 and instead pursued his classical studies alone. 
On 8 April 1890 Ghose met Oscar Wilde at the Fitzroy Street settlement. A little later, after several visits to Tite Street for afternoon tea with the Wildes, Ghose wrote to Binyon: 'He is a wonderful and charming being. You are inclined to think him superficial, I know, you should know him as I do then you would feel what depth and sagacity there is behind his delightful mask of paradox and irony and perversity. (Ghose to L. Binyon, 28 Aug 1890, BL)' Wilde himself was profoundly impressed with Ghose and, amused at the three-piece velvet suit in aesthetic brown in which Ghose would visit him, christened him 'the young Indian panther in evening brown' (Purani, 'Sri Aurobindo in England', 97). 
Ghose's poems were published in the little anthology 'Primavera' in 1890. They were praised by the reviewers (notably Wilde in the 'Pall Mall Gazette' and John Addington Symonds in 'The Academy') for the music and charm of the writing and the subtle mastery of English prosody and diction. Ghose at first concealed from Wilde that he was practically destitute; when Wilde discovered the truth he gave Ghose a wealth of practical help and advice and tried to persuade him to finish 'Prince Pomegranate', so that Wilde could place it with an editor. Ghose was never satisfied with the story and it was neither completed nor published. He became a member of the Rhymers' Club and a friend of Lionel Johnson and Ernest Dowson, but his verse was not published in 'The Book of the Rhymers' Club' (1892) because he could not afford to share the expenses with the other contributors. 
In 1893 Ghose's father learned that the ship bringing his son Aravinda back to India had been wrecked and his son drowned. The news was untrue, but the doctor died of heart failure. Ghose returned to India in mourning and took a series of teaching posts in Patna, Bankipur, and Calcutta, enduring dullness and exhaustion for the sake of the salary. In 1897 he was appointed an assistant professor at Dacca College; here, for five years, he taught English literature, corresponded with Binyon in England, and contributed poems to the 'Garland of New Poetry' (1898). In 1899 he married Malati Banerjee (died 1918), the beautiful, unlettered daughter of a Dacca chemist. At this time he began work on his 'magnum opus', the epic poem 'Perseus', and published a volume entitled 'Love-Songs and Elegies' (1898) with Elkin Mathews. Aided by Binyon and Herbert Horne, he made a study of Italian art and became an avid collector of prints and photographs of Renaissance painting. He became a friend and admirer of Rabindranath Tagore, whose 'Paras Pathar' he translated into English. He was made a full professor at Dacca in 1901. In the same year his first child, Mrinalini, was born. In 1903 he became an inspector of schools in the Chota-Nagpur division; this involved 200 days' travelling a year, journeying by ox-cart to remote villages. His second daughter and future biographer, Lotika, was born at this time, and shortly afterwards the family moved to Calcutta, where Ghose became a professor at Presidency College. He was widely regarded as the best teacher in the city. He filled his house with English flowers and reproductions of Italian paintings. He was extremely happy. 
In 1905, however, Ghose's wife fell ill with an incurable nervous disease, which led to paralysis and loss of speech and memory. At the same time, Ghose suffered greatly from the political activities of his younger brothers Aravinda and Barindra Kumar, who settled in Calcutta with the secret intention of raising an armed revolt against British rule. Ghose, who suspected nothing of this and was a frequent visitor at their house, was put under surveillance by the intelligence services. After the detonation of a terrorist bomb, which killed two English women and for which Barindra Kumar was given a sentence of life imprisonment, Ghose himself came under suspicion as a possible associate of terrorists. Friends and relatives no longer came to his house and he became isolated and remote. During the First World War he was again put in danger of arrest and imprisonment because he was wrongly thought to be involved in a case of revolutionary arms smuggling. The government allowed him to retain his liberty on the extraordinary condition that he abandon his grandly ambitious poem 'Perseus' in case it should prove to have a concealed political motive. At this time Ghose was in anguish at what was happening in England as a result of the war and was writing deeply patriotic verse to the country he regarded as his home. 
Restored to favour after a decade in which his salary had been frozen by the authorities, Ghose was promoted to a class I post in the Indian education service, with a specially enhanced grade of pay. Ghose's wife, whom he 'worshipped', died in October 1918, and his own health broke down following the long years of devoted care with which he had nursed her while also caring for two infant daughters. He aged prematurely. In 1921 he lost the sight of one eye and could see little with the other. There followed a period of renewed poetic composition, inspired by his grief for his dead wife. The blind Ghose dictated to his daughters two series of elegiac lyrics, 'Immortal Eve' and 'Orphic Mysteries', which were published posthumously in 1926 as 'Songs of Love and Death', with a moving memoir by Binyon. W. B. Yeats, moved to tears on reading 'page after page of majestic lines', described the volume as 'one of the most lovely works in the world' (Ghose, 'Selected Poems', 253). John Freeman compared the poems to 'The Angel in the House' by Coventry Patmore. 
For thirty years Ghose had cherished the dream of returning to England. In 1924 he booked a passage for himself and his daughters for a date in March, but he died at 275/3 Bowbazar Street, Calcutta, on 4 January 1924 after a short illness, three weeks before his retirement from Presidency College. While he lay dying his daughters read to him from Scott and Shakespeare at his request as no one was able to read to him from his beloved Greek poets. He was cremated the same day at the Keoratala burning ghat according to the rites of the Brahmo Samaj. 
Between 1970 and 1977 Ghose's daughter Lotika published four of a projected five volumes of her father's hitherto unpublished writings as 'Collected Poems', garnered from scores of notebooks and mountains of loose sheets of paper lying neglected for more than half a century in the cellars of Calcutta University Library. These volumes, unnoticed in India, where they were published, also remain largely unknown to the Western world. They contain 'Perseus', abandoned after 8572 lines, and the completed lyric epic 'Adam Alarmed in Paradise: an Epic of Eden during the Great War'. At 12,282 lines in trochaic trimetre, it is almost as long as John Milton's 'Paradise Lost' and 'Paradise Regained' put together -- a splendid testimony to Ghose's devotion to poetry, his delight in difficult metre and verbal music, and his powers of concentration and learning.

Doll, Josephine (1926-1988), actress and television producer, was born at 146 The Green, Earlsheaton, near Huddersfield, on 6 October 1926, the eldest of the three children of Bernard Rickett (1899-1985), a manager for Fyffes banana company, and his wife, Jessie Elizabeth (1902-1986), daughter of Edward Churchill Hampson, an engineer. She attended Longley Hall secondary school until, aged fourteen, she became a shorthand typist and started a local unit of the Women's Junior Air Corps. To help raise funds for it, she wrote and produced a performance of 'Hansel and Gretel'. At fifteen she won a drama prize and then joined the Huddersfield Thespians, with whom she made her stage debut in December 1943, playing Hazel in J. B. Priestley's play 'Time and the Conways'. 
Jo Rickett joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) as a wireless mechanic in 1944, but also staged and appeared in camp shows so that, in 1947, she won a wartime grant to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), taking the stage name Jo Douglas when she left in 1949. Alfred Hitchcock saw her rehearsing at the academy and gave her a role in the film 'Stage Fright' (1950). Her West End stage debut took place at the Vaudeville Theatre on 6 December 1949, as Nurse Brent in 'Bonaventure'. Meanwhile, on 16 July 1949 she had married (Victor) Douglas Ponton ('b'. 1917), an electrician who owned a shop in Sloane Square, Chelsea; her first son, Peter, was born on 5 September 1950. 
In 1951 Jo Douglas both produced and acted in an amateur performance of 'The Vigil' in St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, Trafalgar Square, where Ponton was in charge of lighting the play; she had to rush from this to appear in a revue called 'See You Again' at the Watergate Theatre. During 1952 she acted in three films, first donning her WAAF uniform once more to appear alongside Jack Hawkins in 'Angels One Five', then doubling for Clark Gable's leading lady, Gene Tierney, in 'Never Let Me Go' -- during the filming of which she met her future husband, (John) Christopher Shaboe Doll ('b'. 1919), then a camera operator with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer -- and finally appearing in 'Lady in the Fog' (released as 'Scotland Yard Inspector' in the USA). In 1953 she joined the actors George Cole and Sidney James in the film 'Will Any Gentleman'; presented the Saturday evening television show 'In Town Tonight', in which actors were interviewed about their work; and adapted Alan Paton's novel 'Cry the Beloved Country' into a play with music, which she produced with Edric Connor in the lead. She divorced Douglas Ponton in January 1954, retaining custody of her son, and married Christopher Doll on 8 May 1954. 
In August 1954 Jo Douglas played herself in a television play by a fellow RADA student, Lynne Reid Banks, called 'It Never Rains'. In that year she also became a regular star on the television panel game 'Find the Link', for two years (which led to her appearances in 'The Name's the Same'), and acted as announcer at the national radio show at Earls Court. During 1955 she appeared as a star on 'Tall Story Club', and in April the BBC gave her a trial as a producer-artiste for six months, and she became that programme's producer. In October 1955 she was awarded a two-year contract. She thus became the only woman producer of light entertainment in Europe. As Joy Leman remarked, since 'few women were involved in the making of television programmes, either as writers or producers in the 1950s' (Leman, 108), this was a mould-breaking appointment. In July 1955 Douglas produced the popular 'Saturday Night Date', followed by 'Tin Pan Alley', with Billy Cotton, in 1956. That year also saw her visiting military bases overseas to record material for the 'Forces Requests' programme. Meanwhile, in the six months prior to the birth of her second son, Christian, on 10 September 1956, she had appeared monthly on a women's programme, describing how her pregnancy was progressing. 
Until 1957 the hour between 6 and 7 p.m. -- known as 'the toddlers' truce' -- was designed to allow parents to put their children to bed free from the distractions of television. But Independent Television, launched in September 1955, was facing financial losses and persuaded the government to remove this ban. It ended on Saturday 16 February, a few minutes after the six o'clock news, with the BBC's 'Six-Five Special', which Jo Douglas both co-produced with Jack Good and co-presented with Pete Murray. Just how revolutionary the 'Six-Five Special' presentation appeared at the time is encapsulated in a comment in the 'Birmingham Mail' (18 February 1957) that it was 'just the kind of thing you might have expected from ITV'. With some pride, the BBC 'Handbook' of 1959 declared that 'while primarily designed for a teen-aged audience [it had become] a national institution equally enjoyed by the parents'. To 'Punch' magazine it was the teenage audience who were 'the real stars of the show' (3 April 1957). After the end of her contract in October 1957, Jo Douglas stayed on for a short time, but Jack Good had been forced out and Pete Murray soon followed. Jim Dale took over from Murray, but it was never the same. Indeed 'No-one else could do what Jack Good and Jo Douglas had done. It had been their baby, and once they were gone the party was over' (Murray, 124). 
Jo Douglas briefly then returned to acting, joining Alastair Sim, Ian Carmichael, and Hatti Jacques in the television play 'Left, Right and Centre', with Sidney Gilliat directing, before going over to ITV, the 'opposition' as the BBC saw it, where she worked first for Granada Television, producing the news programme 'People and Places' three nights every week, and then joined Associated Television (ATV), where she was, for a while, the sole female producer. She then switched to drama, administering a much needed transfusion to the long-running 'Emergency Ward 10' (devised by Tessa Diamond), bringing in actors like James Bolam. As she remarked, 'I want more exciting bods in beds' ('The Times', 13 July 1988), and the twice-weekly soap opera attracted audiences of over 20 million within a year. The 'Arthur Haynes Show' (1957-68) was another Douglas production for ATV, as was the 'Arthur Askey Show' in the spring of 1961. During 1961 she returned to presenting, on the fortnightly 'Home Shopping'. Then, with the series 'Love Story' (1963-7, 1969, 1972-4), she directed twenty plays by writers as diverse as Doris Lessing, Roman Polanski, and Edna O'Brien. She was also responsible for 'Fire Crackers', a 1964 sitcom about work-shy firemen, and, in 1968, 'Virgin of the Secret Service', thirteen hour-long episodes devised and written by Ted Willis as tongue-in-cheek spoofs on James Bond. 
In the early 1970s Jo Douglas produced a number of films, including Danny La Rue's first film, 'Our Miss Fred' (also known as 'Beyond the Call of Duty'; 1972), and 'Dracula AD 1972'. In 1975, with her husband Christopher directing, she produced 'Pilots Royal', a portrait of Prince Charles shown on BBC 2, which reflected her own fascination with flying. (She had gained her pilot's licence in 1967.) In that year she joined Willis Worldwide Productions as an executive producer. Beginning in 1978 she produced thirteen programmes featuring David Kossoff reading 'Bible' stories on Majorca, where she and her husband maintained a holiday home. She worked on various projects from 1980 to 1983, but in 1984 she had an operation and, on the advice of her brother-in-law, the cancer specialist Sir Richard Doll, underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. She retired in 1985 and twice visited her sister Julie in Australia before succumbing to cancer on 12 July 1988 at her home, White Briars, Slinfold, Sussex. She was survived by her husband and two sons.

Foss, Josephine (1887-1983), missionary teacher and welfare worker in Asia, was born on 19 March 1887 at Eastleigh, Dingwall Road, Croydon, the sixth child of Frederick Foss (1850-1908), solicitor, and his wife, Anne Penny Bartrum (1853-1924). Hubert James Foss (1899-1953) was a younger brother. After training as a teacher at the Froebel Institute, specializing in science subjects, she taught for seven years in London and Lancashire before training to become a missionary at St Denys College, Warminster. Early in 1914 she was appointed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) to teach elementary science, nature study, and craft at two schools in Peking (Beijing). She travelled from Berlin to Vladivostok by the Trans-Siberian Railway, having to show her baptism certificate in tsarist Russia because of their current persecution of Jews. Once in China she had to learn to speak and read Mandarin. After a year of intense tuition and much practice with the children in her hostel, she was able to teach elementary physics in Chinese to the boys. Having survived a virulent strain of tuberculosis, she struggled to open kindergartens and clinics in rural areas, carrying bones and crusts of bread in her pockets for the pariah dogs that were at first set on her as 'a blue-eyed Devil'. 
Foss returned on furlough to Europe in 1919 and had to be treated in Switzerland for her tuberculosis. Peking was judged too unhealthy for her and she was sent to Natal (1921-4), to teach English and teaching method to Zulu boys, including the future bishop of Zululand. In 1924 the SPG sent her to St Mary's Anglican School in Kuala Lumpur. In the backstreets of Kuala Lumpur she discovered a primitive school for the children of the Chinese poor, run over shop fronts by an elderly, frail English lady, Miss Elinor Edith Gage Brown (died 1926). In 1925 Josephine Foss took over when Miss Brown went back to England to die and immediately found herself struggling for government backing for her Pudu English School for Girls. 'But money, how much I wanted and how little I got' (memoirs, 30). She was allowed to move the site of the school to undrained wasteland near an old tin mine crater and, thanks to donations from the local Chinese, the first kindergarten, primary, and secondary classes for girls in Malaya began. She also established a boarding-house for rural girls -- Chinese, Indian, Ceylonese, Dutch, and English -- though not Malay Muslims because of their dietary restrictions. They were not all Christians, but Miss Foss did not think that mattered. She also initiated a Girl Guide movement, did local welfare work among lepers and battered children, and found herself the 'de facto' adoptive mother of several abandoned illegitimate little daughters of prostitutes. In 1935 she was made MBE for services to education. Her girls became the first women doctors, nurses, matrons, accountants, therapists, teachers, and lawyers in Malaya, and her Pudu School eventually grew to have more than 1000 pupils. 
After the Japanese invasion of Malaya in 1941 Foss was evacuated to Singapore. When Singapore fell she and the remaining British women were marched to Changi prison camp. She was interned for three and a half years, keeping up her own and her fellow prisoners' spirits, organizing work parties and clandestine meetings of husbands and wives. She endured punishment and interrogation as well as sickness and the endemic acute hunger. After the war the Colonial Office sent her an official commendation for the exceptional services she had rendered to her comrades in captivity. On her release she was too ill and weak to walk; she had lost almost all her hair as well as 5 stone. But former pupils from Pudu found her and cherished her back to the beginnings of renewed health. 
Foss recovered slowly in post-war Britain and applied to return to Malaya, only to be told by the SPG that the bishop of Singapore (John Leonard Wilson) refused to have her back. Perhaps this was because it was no longer possible under Malayanization to have a European as headmistress, or because she had not minded that so many of her girls were not Christian. Determined to save for her fare to return independently, she went back to South Africa to teach Zulu girls for a year in Natal. She later learned that her girls' school was declared a 'whites-only' area by the Nationalist government and all the Africans forcibly displaced. 
In July 1948 Foss returned to Singapore. No longer a headmistress, she had new work, training the first generation of Malaya's welfare officers. She went to hospitals, orphanages, leper settlements, and gaols and personally demonstrated the harmlessness of being a blood donor. But once the emergency of the communist insurgency began in Malaya, the government used her as an interpreter for Mandarin in the courts that were trying young Chinese suspects. She then had to trace and reunite the families of the communists willing to be repatriated to mainland China. As well as Mandarin she could speak Malay, and more than a smattering of Cantonese, Hakka, and Japanese. (In Natal she had also coped with the click language of the Zulu.) She was much happier doing welfare work again after the emergency, organizing campaigns against malaria and yaws and taking salt, clothes, and medicines by jeep and canoe, and on foot through the jungle, to inaccessible Malay villages. From 1952 she undertook parish work in Ipoh and taught in a boys' school there until 1954, when she went to teach at St Thomas's boys' school in Kuching, Sarawak. 
Josephine Foss returned to England in 1958, and taught Malay and Mandarin to English people and English to foreigners -- above all to the Japanese. 'I was determined to teach Japanese ladies to show that I had no permanent hate against them' (memoirs). She died at her home, 2 Broadlands Road, Highgate, London, on 23 July 1983.

Scudamore, Mary, Lady Scudamore (c.1550-1603), courtier, was the daughter of Sir John Shelton (b. in or before 1503, d. 1558) ['see under 'Shelton family] of Shelton, Norfolk, and his wife, Margaret Shelton ['see under 'Shelton family], daughter of Henry Parker, tenth Baron Morley. Nothing is known of her before her appointment as a chamberer of the privy chamber on 1 January 1571, but both her parents had significant connections to Elizabeth I. Her paternal grandfather, Sir John Shelton ['see under 'Shelton family], who married Anne Boleyn's aunt Anne, was governor of Hatfield when it was Elizabeth's nursery in 1534-6; Sir Henry Parker ('c'.1514-1552), her mother's brother, was Elizabeth's chamberlain in 1550-52. By January 1574 Mary had married (as his second wife) the gentleman pensioner Sir John Scudamore (1542-1623) of Holme Lacy, Herefordshire ('see under 'Scudamore family), becoming as a result one of the best-known victims of Elizabeth's bad temper. In the notorious 'scandal letter' of 1584 Mary, queen of Scots, accused Elizabeth of breaking one of Mary Scudamore's fingers and trying to conceal the incident as an accident caused by a falling candlestick. However lurid her account, the Scottish queen's source was the victim's close friend Lady Mary Talbot (wife of the future seventh earl of Shrewsbury), and there is independent confirmation from the maid of honour Eleanor Brydges that Mary Scudamore suffered both 'bloes and yevyll words... never woman bought hir husband more deare than she hath done' (Tighe, 163). But Elizabeth's hostility to privy chamber marriages has been greatly exaggerated and the marriage did neither Mary nor her husband, with whom she had two sons, any lasting harm. The best explanation is that as a Boleyn relation Elizabeth considered her to be a member of the extended royal family and expected her to seek prior approval of her marriage. She was also one of Elizabeth's favourite sleeping companions. On 9 October 1576 she was hastily summoned back to court from a holiday with her husband when Lady Dorothy Stafford broke her leg: 'for I fear untill you come her majestie shall not in the night have for the most part so good rest as she wyll take after your comyng' (earl of Sussex to Mary Scudamore, TNA: PRO, C115/M19/7543). 
Thanks to the survival of the large collection of Scudamore papers in the 'duchess of Norfolk's deposit' in the Public Record Office, Mary is one of the few women of the Elizabethan privy chamber to have left more than scraps of correspondence. Among her papers is one of the rare internal records of the privy chamber, the 'book of the stuffe of the quenes majestie's wardrobe', a daybook recording various items of Elizabeth's clothing and jewellery in the keeping of one of the privy chamber women. Since it runs from 1561 to 1585, Mary presumably inherited it from one of her predecessors. It was published by Janet Arnold in 1980 under the title 'Lost from Her Majestie's Back'. The Cecil and Talbot correspondence reveals that although Mary Scudamore was still a chamberer in 1589, she was by then regarded in some quarters as a particularly effective intermediary with the queen. In 1599 Charles Cornwallis referred to her virtues having advanced her 'to that honourable place you are in & therin have continued you to the great good of the house [the Howards] from whence you are descended' (TNA: PRO, C115/M18/7511). However, her financial exploitation of her influence has been cited by W. J. Tighe as evidence of the increasing rapacity of the privy chamber in the 1590s. In 1602 she was reported as seriously ill, and although she attended Elizabeth's funeral, like several other senior women of Elizabeth's privy chamber she did not survive the queen for very long. The exact date and place of her death are unknown, but she was buried at Holme Lacy on 15 August 1603.

Emidy, Joseph Antonia (c.1770-1835), violinist and composer, was born in Guinea, west Africa. Only two sources suggest a date, although neither is definitive. The muster books for the frigate 'Indefatigable' after 1 September 1795 state that he was then twenty-five years old whereas his gravestone records his age at death in April 1835 as sixty; it is probable that, due to his chequered origins, Emidy himself did not know his exact age. The gravestone, which, together with the burial record, are the only records of his second forename, describes him as 'a native of Portugal' but James Silk Buckingham, who knew Emidy in the period 1805-7, reports in his 'Autobiography' (1855) that he had been taken in childhood from Guinea into slavery by Portuguese traders, first to Brazil and subsequently to Lisbon. 
By 1795 Emidy was playing second violin in a Lisbon opera house orchestra when he came unwillingly into contact with the British navy. On 10 May 1795 the frigate 'Indefatigable', captained by Sir Edward Pellew -- later Lord Exmouth -- put into the Tagus for major repairs. Due to the crowded conditions aboard ship Pellew required a violinist to play for the sailors' recreation and ordered the kidnapping of the young black violinist whom he had noticed playing energetically in the theatre. Josh Emede, described as a volunteer, first appears in the muster taken on 24 June. The 'Indefatigable' sailed on 8 July to resume duties on the western approaches with Emidy, now categorized as a landsman, among the crew. He was to remain aboard, messing alone and in close confinement, until March 1799 when Pellew changed command in his home port of Falmouth. 
Cornwall became Emidy's home for the remainder of his life. From a house near the market square in Falmouth he developed a career as a teacher and violinist, appearing as soloist and leader with amateur harmonic societies in many Cornish towns. His professional duties are recorded in newspaper advertisements, reports, and -- occasionally -- personal memoirs. An anonymous watercolour, dated Truro, 8 November 1808, showing a black violinist leading a group of orchestral musicians, is the only visual record of his career. Emidy married Jane Hutchins (1778-1842), the daughter of a local mariner, on 16 September 1802 at Falmouth parish church. Eight children were born to the couple. In 1815 the family moved to Truro, where they lived at 4 Charles Street, a modest address close to the assembly rooms, theatre, and fashionable town houses where many of Emidy's professional activities were centred. Contemporary accounts speak highly of his ability as a violinist; Buckingham describes him 'playing to a degree of perfection never before heard in Cornwall' (Buckingham, 1.169), and Tuck, remarking that Emidy's fingers 'were not much larger than a goose quill', regarded him as 'the most finished musician I ever heard of'; the source of his 'great talent... was always a mystery to me, and to all who came in contact with him' (Tuck, 19). 
That a slave and victim of the press-gang should play an instrument professionally at all is remarkable, but more surprising is Emidy's flair for composition. The earliest reference to this occurs in advertisements for a concert in Falmouth in 1802 which included a violin concerto, composed and performed by Emidy. His compositions were of sufficient quality for Buckingham to attempt in 1807 to interest the impresario Salomon in furthering Emidy's career in London. A selection of orchestral and chamber scores was privately performed, but, although they were well regarded, nothing came of Buckingham's venture. It is impossible to judge any of Emidy's music today as no works were published and no manuscripts have been found. Joseph Emidy died at his home in Truro on 23 April 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of Kenwyn parish church, Truro, on 26 April. Both local newspapers carried brief obituaries, that of the 'Royal Cornwall Gazette' being the most informative.

Goldfaden, Avrom (1840-1908), playwright and theatre director, was born in Old Constantine, Ukraine, on 12 July 1840, one of four sons born to Khayim Lipe Goldenfodem, a watchmaker, and his wife, Khane Rivke. Like his brothers, he was apprenticed to his father, but in an effort to take advantage of a new tsarist decree offering the sons of Jewish families an alternative to conscription, he was sent to the rabbinical academy in Zhitomir from 1857 to 1866. By the time he completed his studies he was already a published poet, having submitted verse to the Hebrew literary journal 'Hamelits' and its Yiddish offshoot, 'Kol mevaser'. In the mid- to late 1860s he published one volume of Hebrew poems and two collections in Yiddish, which he issued under the more German-sounding surname of Goldfaden, the name by which he became well known to Yiddish-speakers worldwide. 
Although Goldfaden continued publishing verse throughout his life, it was primarily as a playwright that he made his name. His second volume of Yiddish writing included a three-act play, 'Di mume Sosye', written in the tradition of salon dramas by Jewish intellectuals dating back to the 1790s (indeed, the play in question was essentially an adaptation of Shloyme Etinger's comedy 'Serkele', in which Goldfaden had starred in a rabbinical school production). At the time the play was published there was no professional forum for staging Yiddish plays, but Goldfaden soon changed that. 
After completing his rabbinical studies Goldfaden married Paulina Verbl, daughter of the writer Eliyohu Verbl, who befriended and influenced his son in-law. Goldfaden drifted from one job to another for nearly a decade, culminating in a short-lived newspaper venture in Bucharest with his friend and former classmate the writer Yitskhok Linetski. At loose ends in Romania, Goldfaden began writing sketches for local performers, an undertaking that soon led to the formation of a professional company that began touring Romania and Russia in 1876. Goldfaden's career as a playwright progressed in several distinct phases, whose form and content were affected by a combination of the socio-political situation of eastern European Jewry and the evolving theatrical conditions of the Yiddish stage. In the first phase, from 1876 to approximately 1880, he wrote primarily light comedies that tended to satirize religious fanaticism and champion the agenda of the Jewish enlightenment, or Haskalah. Best-known among these works are the farces 'Shmendrik' (1877) and 'Di tsvey Kuni Leml' (1880) and the comic operetta 'Di kishefmakherin' (1879). 
As the condition of the Jews of the Russian empire rapidly deteriorated in the early 1880s, Goldfaden set aside his agenda of social reform within the Jewish community and turned to building national morale with operettas of the heroic Jewish past. This new outlook bred several of his most successful and popular works, including: 'Shulamis' (1881), an epic story set in late antiquity and following the fortunes of a shepherdess and the soldier who falls in love with, abandons, and ultimately returns to her; 'Doctor Almasada' (1881), a tale of persecution and redemption of the Jews in Renaissance Italy; and 'Bar Kokhba' (1883), based on the true story of a suicidal Jewish uprising against the Roman empire in the second century. 
If the legend that the ban imposed on Yiddish theatre in the Russian empire was imposed as a direct response to the production of 'Bar Kokhba', then Alexander III and his advisers must be credited with a reasonable degree of acuity as theatre critics. In any case, the ban, which officially remained in place until after the first Russian revolution of 1905, made life impossible for all but the handful of Yiddish troupes who continued to perform in Russia through a combination of stealth, bribery, and cajolery. Goldfaden and his actors were not among them, and for the rest of his life, he never remained in one country for more than a few years at a time. He first proceeded to Poland, where his company performed in Warsaw and later in Lodz, and then emigrated in 1887 to New York. There he composed his successful biblical dramas 'Akeydes Yitskhok' (1887) and 'Kenig Akhashveyresh' (1887), but did not get the welcome he expected from colleagues, and ultimately left for London. He led a troupe at the Princess Club Theatre for several months during 1889, but soon moved to Paris and then on to Lemberg (Lwow), his primary city of residence for most of the 1890s. 
Goldfaden made a dramatic return to London in 1900 as Paris delegate to the World Zionist Congress. Although his plays had long been ubiquitous on the Yiddish stage -- and indeed remained so for decades -- Goldfaden and his wife spent most of their final years in dire financial straits, and on his sixtieth birthday a fund was established in London to support the couple. His final years brought continued wandering and declining health, ultimately bringing him to his deathbed as his last play, 'Ben Ami', was running in the New York theatres in the closing weeks of 1907. He died in New York a few weeks into the run, on 9 January 1908, survived by his wife. On the following day 100,000 spectators were said to have greeted his funeral procession to Washington cemetery, New York, where he was buried.

Adler, Jacob (1855-1926), actor, was born on 1 January 1855 in Odessa, Ukraine, the son of Feivl Abramovich, an Orthodox Jewish wheat merchant, and his wife, Hesye. Of the twelve children of Hesye and Feivl (she had one son with her first husband, whom she divorced), only Jacob and a younger sister, Sarah, survived infancy. 
Jacob's parents had ambitious plans for him, hoping that with his quick mind he would become a doctor. Schooling did not agree with him, however, and he eventually left to earn his own living. With abundant charisma and beautiful handwriting, he advanced rapidly through a series of clerical and civil-service positions, culminating in a prestigious job as municipal overseer of weights and measures. His solid income allowed him to live the life of the bon vivant; he dressed like a dandy, caroused until the wee hours, and frequently attended the Russian theatre. There he became the leader of a claque that supported a popular local actress, and was bitten hard by the theatrical bug. 
When Adler learned that a Yiddish company led by Avrom Goldfaden was active in Bucharest, he extended an invitation to them to visit Odessa, and in 1879 they did so. Adler became an extra in the company and travelled with them to Kherson, thereby staying away from his office job so long that he was fired. Intentionally or not, he virtually forced himself into becoming a professional actor. 
Adler toured extensively with the Yiddish troupe, soon making his way to more important roles in such plays as Goldfaden's 'Brayndele kozak' and 'Shmendrik'. During one of these early tours, in Yekaterinoslav, he met and married Sofia (Sonya) Oberlender. In 1882 Adler joined the throng of Jews fleeing Russia in the wake of worsening conditions after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II. Adler settled for several years in London, where he and Sonya were among the pioneers who established Yiddish theatre in the East End. Sonya died in 1885. They had two children: Rivke, who died at age three, and Abe, who, like many of the Adler children by four different mothers, became an actor himself. At about the same time, another child was born to Adler out of wedlock, when Jenny Kaiser gave birth to a son named Charlie, who took his father's last name. 
Shortly after Sonya's premature death, Jacob married an actress named Dina Stettin, who became an international star, primarily as Dina Feinman, after her divorce from Adler a few years later and her marriage to leading man Sigmund Feinman. Adler and Dina had one daughter, Celia, who also became a major star. 
Adler was part of the original troupe at the Prince's Club Theatre in London, where in 1887 a false fire alarm created a stampede, leading to the deaths of seventeen in the audience. At least partly in response to the tragedy, Adler soon left London for the United States. Initially bypassing New York, the hub of the American Yiddish theatre, he worked for a short time in Chicago, then returned to Europe, where he spent two years performing in Warsaw. In 1889 he passed through London again before being invited to perform in New York, where he spent most of the rest of his career. 
Adler formed his two most lasting partnerships shortly after arriving in New York. He had fallen in love with actress Sara Heimovich-Heine ('c'.1858-1953), who was married at the time to actor Maurice Heine. In 1891 he and Sara both obtained divorces in order to marry each other. As a couple and as individuals they became theatrical royalty, and most of their children became professional actors as well. Frances and Julia had successful careers on the Yiddish stage; Stella and Luther crossed over into the American (English-language) stage with great success; and Stella made an indelible impact on American acting with her actor training programme. 
The other crucial partnership in Adler's career -- a symbiotic professional relationship that transformed the development of the Yiddish theatre -- was his involvement with playwright Jacob Gordin. Missing from Adler's many talents as a performer was a good singing voice, which often seriously limited a repertoire dominated by operettas and musical comedies. Adler's salvation as a leading man came in the form of Gordin, a Russian intellectual who, shortly after immigrating to New York in 1891, met Adler and other Yiddish actors and was inspired to write plays for the first time. Gordin's first effort, later that same year, was 'Siberia' (1891), which audiences reportedly resisted until Adler won them over through sheer force of personality. Gordin went on to write several more leading roles that became among Adler's best-known creations, including the title characters 'Der yidisher kenig Lir' ('The Jewish King Lear') and 'Der vilder mentsh' ('The Wild Man'), and 'Elisha Ben Abuye'. So effective was Adler as Dovid Moysheles, the contemporary Russian Jewish version of King Lear, that he was deluged with letters from parents thanking him for making their Shloymes and Moyshes better children. 
The late 1890s and beginning of the 1900s brought Adler's creative peak, with talented playwrights like Gordin, Leon Kobrin, and David Pinski writing for him. He also attracted attention outside the Jewish quarter with his portrayal in 1901 of Shylock, modelled closely on Henry Irving's sympathetic reading of the role. The production attracted, among others, prominent producers like Daniel Frohman, who mounted a Broadway production two years later with Adler playing Shylock in Yiddish, and an English-speaking supporting cast. The production was a critical as well as a commercial success, and Adler reprised the role on Broadway in 1905. 
An aged and feeble Adler gave his last performance in 1925, and died of a stroke on 31 March 1926 in New York city. The following day tens of thousands of onlookers lined the streets of New York to pay their last respects as his body was carried to its final resting place in Mount Carmel cemetery.

MacCrimmon family (per. 1600-1746), pipers, were hereditary pipers to the MacLeods of Dunvegan, Isle of Skye, holding tenancies at Boreraig, Galtrigill, and Borrodale. The origins of the MacCrimmons are obscure. Genealogies of the family have been produced, based mostly on James Logan's unreliable introduction to Angus Mackay's 'A Collection of Ancient Piobaireachd' (1838). They rely more on tradition, inference, and even invention, than on accurate records. However, through the tangle of romance attached to the name, there is no doubt that the MacCrimmons were masters and renowned teachers of 'ceol mor' -- the classical music of the highland bagpipes, also known as piobaireachd (pibroch). 
In May 1651 a 'John M'gyurmen' was declared by his fellow pipers to be 'the Prince of Pipers' (NL Scot., 3658, Wardlaw MS p. 379). Charles II called him forward and permitted him to kiss his hand, upon which the piper composed the piobaireachd 'Thug mi pog do laimh an righ'. Opinion has it that 'M'gyurmen' (a name otherwise unknown) is a rendering of the name MacCrimmon though, as piper to the 'Earle of Sutherland', the player in question would not have been employed by the MacLeods. 
Further evidence of the family's employment and status can be found in the records of the MacLeod estates, but they do not appear on the rent rolls as they probably held their lands rent-free, as did Roderick Morison. That they were formally recognized as teachers is reflected in an entry for 1698 referring to the 'Prentisep of McIntyre ye pyper with McCrooman'. Their musical prowess is mentioned in the Gaelic poems of Mary MacLeod -- notably 'Cronan an taibh' (composed shortly after 1666), which refers to Padraig Mor and his 'piob nuallanach mhor' or 'great shrill-voiced pipe' ('Gaelic Songs of Mary MacLeod', ed. J. Carmichael Watson, 1934, 44-5). Thomas Pennant refers to the MacCrimmons as hereditary pipers to the MacLeods of Skye, holding land rent-free and receiving pupils at their piping college; and when Boswell and Johnson visited the MacLeod stronghold of Dunvegan in 1773, Johnson recorded, 'There has been in Sky, beyond all time of memory, a college of pipers, under the direction of Macrimmon, which is not quite extinct.' 
The main members of the family were

Feinman, Sigmund (1862-1909), actor and playwright, was born Asher-Zelig Feinman on 28 April 1862 in Intshest, Ukraine. Since both his grandfathers had prominent roles in the synagogue, it was natural for Feinman to receive a traditional religious education. His father, however, was a manufacturer, and thus receptive to influences from beyond the Jewish sphere, so he sent his son to secular schools as well. 
Young Asher-Zelig's beautiful singing voice earned him a place in his synagogue choir, a position that would have given him a rigorous musical education. When a theatre company led by Naftule Goldfaden (brother of the Yiddish playwright and theatre manager Avrom Goldfaden) came to perform in the nearby city of Kishinyov, Feinman was drawn to it like a moth to flame, and joined the chorus. His rapid advance to leading roles made the theatrical life too tempting; he left home and joined the company in earnest. 
After tsarist authorities imposed a ban on the Yiddish theatre in 1883, Feinman headed for Romania, where his linguistic talents served him well, and he led several different companies there. Like many of his colleagues, he eventually made his way further westward -- first to London, and then in 1886 to New York, where he joined a company led by Sigmund Mogulesco and Moyshe Finkel. Feinman's fame continued to grow in America, where he ultimately came to be seen as a rival to leading men like Jacob Adler, David Kessler, and Boris Thomashefsky. All three towered over much of their competition in more ways than one: in physical stature, vocal strength, intelligence, and charisma. 
Feinman had another thing in common with Adler: after Adler divorced the actress Dina Stettin in 1891, Feinman married her, and she became famous under her new married name. Feinman adopted her daughter Celia, from her marriage with Adler; however, despite Celia's great fondness for her stepfather, she retained her natural father's name, and became internationally renowned on the stage as Celia Adler. Feinman had two children from a previous marriage (details of which are unknown): a son, Joe, and a daughter, Lily. Lily became an actress, and married the prominent comedian Ludwig Satz. With Dina, Feinman had another daughter, Becky. 
In 1892 Feinman became a manager of Poole's Theatre in lower Manhattan, New York, along with Adler, Mogulesco, and Kessler. Like many a similar venture throughout the history of the Yiddish theatre, however, this seems to have put too many large egos under one roof, and the partnership did not last. Feinman left New York altogether for a while, choosing instead to tour what American Yiddish actors called the 'provints'; in typically Manhattanocentric style, this referred to any venue outside the city of New York. Feinman spent several years touring smaller cities in the United States and Canada before returning to New York in the mid-1890s. 
The last decade or so of Feinman's career was peripatetic, with an itinerary ranging from Europe to North and South America. He spent long periods at the Pavilion Theatre in London and Gimpel's Theatre in Lemberg (Lwow), as well as enjoying successful engagements in Buenos Aires, and in Bucharest and many other European cities. 
Throughout much of his career Feinman was also active as a playwright. Among his dozen or so plays and operettas, the most successful were 'Azarye der Giber Hakhayil, oder, Der Printsesins Neyder' ('Azariah the War Hero, or, The Princess's Oath', 1896), 'Der Vitse-Kenig' ('The Viceroy', 1898), 'Khanele di finisherin' ('Hannah the Seamstress', 1899), and 'Der yid in Sobyeskis tsaytn, oder, Shabes koydesh' ('The Jew in Sobieski's era, or, The holy sabbath', 1904). All of these enjoyed popular success in America as well as Europe. 
In grand theatrical style, Feinman spent his final moments on stage. The portly and ailing actor, defying doctors' orders, embarked on a tour to Lodz in spring 1909. During a rehearsal of Karl Gutzkow's 'Uriel Acosta', long a staple of the Yiddish repertory, Feinman collapsed on stage on 1 July 1909, and died shortly thereafter. He was buried in the Jewish cemetery in Lodz the following day. 
Feinman's career has not been chronicled in nearly as much detail as those of many of his contemporaries in the Yiddish theatre, which is perhaps how he would have wanted it. Rather than make a permanent base in New York, he split his time with venues in Europe and elsewhere, where the spotlight was somewhat dimmer in his day (and the streets less cluttered with theatre historians). And unlike other stars like Adler, Bertha Kalish, Thomashefsky, or his stepdaughter, Celia Adler, Feinman never published his memoirs. He did, however, gain the admiration and love of his audiences and the critics, and his career deserves closer scrutiny.

Wiseman, Elizabeth, Lady Wiseman (1647-1730), litigant, the fifth daughter (the third surviving to adulthood) of Dudley North, fourth Baron North (1602-1677), and Anne, 'nee' Montagu ('c'.1613-1681), was born in London on 4 January 1647. She was sister to Francis North, first Baron Guilford, and to Roger North, lawyer and author of the lives of three of his brothers, Francis, John North (professor of Greek at Cambridge University), and Sir Dudley North, merchant. She married Sir Robert Wiseman (b. 1609/10), dean of the arches, and after his death in 1684 she married, in 1687, William Paston, second earl of Yarmouth (1653/4-1732) ['see under 'Paston, Robert]. After the death in 1685 of her brother Francis, Elizabeth cared for and educated his daughter Anne. At that time she was living at Chelsea, but within a year she had moved to the fashionable Soho Square, then newly laid out by Gregory King. Sir Peter Lely painted her portrait in 1678 or 1679, one of six he did for Sir Francis North of members of his family in return for legal work. The portrait has so far not been identified among the many by Lely of unnamed sitters. 
Elizabeth Wiseman was briefly the subject of London gossip in 1686-7, and is known to later times because of her unwilling involvement in a claim for breach of marriage contract. On the death of her first husband, Sir Robert Wiseman, she was left with a fortune of $20,000 although on marriage he had 'made no other settlement, then by a bond to leav her portion [of $1500] doubled'. Among the many suitors for this windfall was one Robert Spencer, who was a cousin of Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland, and whose cause was supported and encouraged by Elizabeth's eldest brother, Charles, fifth Baron North, and his wife, Katharine. Charles North hoped the marriage would gain him influence with the earl of Sunderland and at the court of James II. Charles and his wife arranged meetings between Elizabeth and Spencer. On one occasion Spencer appeared from an inner room after a promise that he would not be present; on another Spencer and Elizabeth were shut in a room together, after which Charles North and Spencer claimed that a marriage contract had taken place. Elizabeth vehemently denied this claim and put her case in the hands of her brothers Sir Dudley, then commissioner for customs; Roger; and Mountague, a merchant. On their advice she went to live at Brettenham in Suffolk with her sister and brother-in-law, Sir George and Lady Christina (or Christian) Wenyeve. As a consequence of her leaving London, and of the continued threats of Spencer and Charles North, a large correspondence to and from her three supportive brothers accumulated, and was preserved by Roger North because at one point he, as her lawyer, suggested that they might take an action against Spencer for breach of promise of marriage. The correspondence, preserved in case of the necessity for legal action, tells Elizabeth's (and her brothers') version of Spencer's claims and behaviour. It also gives details of the consequent flight from arrangements for a marriage to Sir John Thorold that were in progress when Spencer's suit began, and the antics in the pursuit of two other suitors (a Mr Danvers and a Mr Neal) for Elizabeth's hand in the seven months before she married the second earl of Yarmouth. No case for breach of promise was prosecuted, but the affair ended with a case in the court of the arches (1687). Spencer's deposition was made before Thomas Exton, dean of the arches, on 27 April 1687. In it he puts his own side of the story, graphically describing his behaviour towards Elizabeth (what she referred to as his 'flames and nonsence' and his 'rudenesses') and what he claimed was Elizabeth's acquiescence in it. When the case came to trial Spencer was made to retract his claim to Elizabeth and also to withdraw claims (presumably for damages) against the earl of Yarmouth's brother Thomas Paston and his friend Thomas Rawlens who, it seems, had assaulted him. At the same time Charles North apparently reluctantly withdrew his own claim that he and his wife had witnessed in their house a verbal contract of marriage between the two. Finally Spencer challenged the earl of Yarmouth to a duel, but the remaining documents do not disclose whether or not this was fought. 
Elizabeth Wiseman's case is of significance for information on the legal and social status of widows; the laws of evidence, which were constantly reviewed in the 1680s and 1690s, and for which circumstantial evidence was more widely accepted; and for details of social and familial interaction. Apart from this single episode little is known of her life. Ketton-Cremer records that when the earl of Yarmouth was imprisoned in the Tower in 1690 as an 'open partisan' of James II, Elizabeth 'petitioned the Queen to lodge with him'. A letter that Roger North wrote to their niece Anne Foley on Elizabeth's illness in 1728 gives a glimpse of difficulties in her marriage with the earl, who died two years after her and was declared bankrupt on his death. Elizabeth died in 1730 and had no children from either her first or second marriage.

Goldwin, William (1496/7-1562), schoolmaster, was admitted aged eighteen to King's College, Cambridge, as an Eton scholar, of Dorney near Windsor, on 16 August 1515. He took his BA early in 1520 and proceeded MA three years later, but from 1518 held a fellowship at King's until he returned to Eton College as headmaster for three years from 1525. By an error in the Eton audit books the master appears as John Goldwin, but no contemporary graduate of that name is known. Thus far, William's rise was rapid, but not as prodigious as that of Thomas Wolsey, who at twenty-four had become headmaster of Magdalen College School. In 1528 Wolsey brought Goldwin from Eton to be the first master of the college he was building at Ipswich, his birthplace, with a sister college at Oxford, to outdo Henry VI's and Wykeham's twin foundations. The Cardinal College of St Mary at Ipswich was to be more lavishly staffed than Eton or Winchester. To finance the new foundations Wolsey obtained the king's leave to suppress some dozen minor monastic establishments, mostly in Suffolk. 
Goldwin served under William Capon, the college dean, from its opening in September 1528 until its closure after Wolsey's fall at Michaelmas 1530. Ominously the lavish celebrations on Lady day 1528 were completely ruined by atrocious weather. In January 1529 Goldwin, addressing Wolsey once as 'your Majesty', sent him a report in ornate Latin prose, enclosing specimens of the first pupils' writing and praising the worship provided by the dean in the chapel. The college had been using Wolsey's 'Rudimenta grammatices et docendi methodus' which he had prescribed, according to its title-page, 'not only for Ipswich, but for all the other schools in England'. Goldwin wrote of 'so plentiful a crop springing up that he did not despair of the harvest'. The pupils were 'all of good intelligence and the flock increased hourly, so that the house was too small to hold them properly' ('LP Henry VIII', 4/3, no. 5159). When the blow fell the local boys were cast forth, since they and their grammar school's endowments had been swallowed up by the college. Thomas Cromwell, however, persuaded the king to refound the town school and Goldwin stayed on as master, moving back to a fellowship at Eton in 1539. He held several college livings -- Mapledurham, Oxfordshire, in 1544-6, Stogursey, Somerset, in 1554-6, and the rectory of Piddlehinton, Dorset -- from vacating his fellowship in 1550 until his death on 15 May 1562. It is ironic that his modest locally engraved inscription brass at Piddlehinton is a piece of monastic spoil; palimpsest, its reverse shows the lower half of the figure of a prior with his staff.

Ekarte, George Daniel (1896/7-1964), minister and community worker, was born in west Africa, possibly in the Calabar region of Nigeria. His early years were spent at mission stations run by Free Church of Scotland missionaries. Impressed by what he had heard of the glories of the 'mother country', he obtained a seaman's certificate (which named him simply George Daniel) and worked his way to Britain, where he arrived probably in the early 1920s. Instead of finding glories, he found Liverpool, the city with the highest infant mortality rate in the UK, where the unemployment rate among insured workers was 28 per cent; by 1933 10 per cent of the city's population was in receipt of relief, with the poor heavily concentrated in the racially mixed Toxteth district. The census of 1911 revealed 880 residents born in India and 693 born in Africa; ethnicity was not recorded. In 1919 anti-black riots in the city resulted in the lynching of a black man for whose murder no one was arrested, though the police witnessed the incident. 
Working in the local oil mills and sugar refineries, Pastor Daniels Ekarte, as he now called himself, began preaching on street corners, at a gospel hall, and at the Coloured Men's Religious Institute. He also began to visit Africans on ships and in lodging-houses and hospitals. Not satisfied with what he could accomplish this way, he approached the Church of Scotland foreign missions committee and probably also the Liverpool diocese for financial help to set up a permanent mission home. The African Churches Mission was opened in Toxteth on 7 July 1931. It became the main, if not the only, source of succour for the city's resident and itinerant black population, as well as for other local people, serving as a spartan hostel, a place of worship, and a canteen providing cheap meals and free breakfasts for the district's children. There was a scout troop and a Brownie pack, music and secondary school classes for schoolchildren, a mothers' union, and an annual children's Christmas party. The mission also served as a social services agency to which even the police referred people, especially Africans. The mission's ledger reveals the level of local poverty: money was provided for boots, winter coats, and burials, for hospital fees and for rent. During the Second World War, when Ekarte was an ARP warden, the mission also provided emergency housing. All this was accomplished with little financial support, but with help from neighbours, white and black, and donations from local shopkeepers. 
During the Second World War Ekarte became involved in two controversial issues. In 1940 he actively supported a strike by African seamen, demanding higher wages and the end of the system whereby deductions were made for the shipping company's Liverpool hostel, whether the men stayed there or not. (African and other 'colonial' seamen received not only much lower wages than their European peers, but also less living space and rations on board ship.) The men's demands were ignored. The other issue was that of the 'brown babies': that is, the 650 or so children fathered by African American servicemen stationed in Britain, whose white mothers did not want to keep them. (The American army did not permit the men to marry the mothers.) Ekarte lobbied the government for action on the children's behalf and even housed some of them at the mission. With help from the fund-raising efforts of Trinidad-born cricketer and government official Learie Constantine he tried to purchase a larger house to use as a children's home. The government did nothing; Ekarte could not raise enough funds for a home, and in a dawn raid the eight children at the mission were dragged away and dispersed around the country by Liverpool social services. 
Naturally Ekarte maintained a relationship with other black organizations in the UK and, when funds permitted, he attended their meetings. The mission was visited by civil and religious African dignitaries, occasionally by MPs interested in its work, and by officials from the Colonial Office, from which it received some support. Three future African prime ministers -- Hastings Banda, Jomo Kenyatta, and Kwame Nkrumah -- stayed at the mission in the 1940s. 
Though racial strife and discrimination in Liverpool did not decrease (there were anti-black riots in 1948), there was a huge increase in social service provisions after the war, and thus the mission lost much of its 'raison d'etre'. Ekarte could not raise the funds to repair the dilapidated and bomb-damaged mission buildings in Hill Street, and they were demolished by the city in 1964. Ekarte was moved to sheltered housing, at 27 Avison Tower, Princes Park, Toxteth, Liverpool, where he died of a coronary thrombosis on 12 July 1964, aged sixty-seven. He was buried on 20 July in Allerton cemetery, Liverpool. Of his wife, Lily, no details are known.

Skidmore, Francis Alfred (1817-1896), art metal worker, was born in Birmingham on 14 February 1817, the only child of Francis Skidmore (1780/81-1860), silversmith, and his wife, Flora (1790/91-1849), daughter of William Hedger. He was brought up in Coventry, where his father established a successful jewellers' shop in the 1820s. He was indentured as an apprentice, before becoming a freeman of Coventry in 1841 and entering his own maker's mark at the Birmingham assay office in 1845. 
Skidmore's upbringing was one of hard work, self-improvement, and social ascent. It was also conspicuously Anglican, with his father serving as churchwarden and foeffee for Holy Trinity Church, Coventry, then under the direction of the charismatic high church vicar, Walter Farquhar Hook. Both this work ethic and his religious background were to prove formative for the young silversmith. His first independent projects were chalices: for Holy Trinity, Coventry, and St Giles, Exhall, in 1845. In 1851, the year in which he became a partner in his father's business, he attracted the praise of the Anglo-Catholic Ecclesiological Society for the church plate which he showed at the Great Exhibition. 
This marked the start of a remarkable half decade during which Skidmore's life was transformed. In 1852 his expertise on medieval metalwork was acknowledged by his election to the intellectually prestigious and socially rather exclusive Oxford Architectural Society. On 12 July 1853 he married in Coventry, at Holy Trinity, Emma (1831-1901), daughter of George Carloss, watch gilder. She had also been living and working in his father's premises as a silversmith's assistant and was 'a lady of very similar tastes to his own' ('Coventry Standard', 20 Nov 1896). They had seven children, though only three sons and one daughter survived to adulthood. 
At the same time, Skidmore first encountered the architect George Gilbert Scott, who was to become his greatest patron, and in 1854 he opened new premises in West Orchard Street, Coventry, with a new title: 'Skidmore and Son, Manufacturers of Church Plate and Metal Work'. A year later, he was employed to design the roof for the new Oxford Museum (1855-7; rebuilt 1858). Here was evidence that he had become a national name, trusted to work on one of the most high-profile projects of the age. 
The years that followed saw Skidmore become one of the most notable craftsmen in the country. Through G. G. Scott, he was employed to work at cathedrals from Salisbury (1865-71) to Chester (1868-75), Lichfield (1855-61), and York (1862). He was also employed at public buildings from St Pancras Station (1869-72) to the Foreign Office (1861-8). He was inevitably Scott's first choice to produce metalwork for the Albert Memorial (1864-8). In 1862 his importance was recognized at the International Exhibition, where he was awarded a prize for 'progress, elegance of design and excellent workmanship' ('The Builder', 71, 1896, 430). His choir screen, designed with Scott and intended for Hereford Cathedral, was greeted as 'the most noble work of modern times' ('Illustrated London News', 30 Aug 1862, 246). By 1865 Skidmore was employing seventy-four men and fifty-one boys at the workshop in Alma Street, Coventry, where he had moved six years earlier, and Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Iron Company was launched as a joint-stock enterprise. 
These achievements owed much to forces beyond Skidmore's control. He benefited from a tidal wave of church building and restoration; from the ever-increasing popularity of the Gothic revival; and from both the invention of new and the rediscovery of old techniques of metalworking. But his own dynamism and ability also carried him far. He exhibited widely, winning prizes at exhibitions in Dublin (1865), Coventry (1867), and Wolverhampton (1869). His well-publicized talks on metalwork at the Oxford Architectural Society and at London's Architectural Museum established him as an authority on the subject. Above all, he was a highly creative artist in his own right, trusted by architects like Scott, who allowed him enormous freedom, recalling that Skidmore had taken his initial designs and then ''kicked over the traces' whenever he has had a chance' (Scott, 216). 
The result is a body of work which is instantly recognizable. Inspired by what he described as 'Ancient Examples' ('Skidmore's Art Manufactures Co, Book of Designs'), it owes much to the medieval models that were celebrated by both the Oxford Architectural and Cambridge Ecclesiological societies. His church plate, in particular, draws on the fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century collections of colleges such as Corpus Christi, Oxford. Yet Skidmore was keen to emphasize that what he was doing was also utterly modern, 'a legacy of this 'our' century' ('The Builder', 13, 1855, 576). He used the latest techniques like electroforming, and argued that, had the medieval masters possessed the technology that the Victorians pioneered, they too would have embraced wrought-iron, plate glass, and gas lighting. He was consequently responsible for a slew of foliated and ornamented gas lights in churches throughout the country, as well as some 'impossibly slim' (O'Dwyer, 258) and exquisitely decorated columns, replete with iron foliage and leaves, for the Oxford Museum. 
The roof at the Oxford Museum, however, failed; and Skidmore's business eventually failed too. As a former employee recalled, he was simply too punctilious. He 'worked for a good name, got the name, but lost money. He would break up goods of pounds and pounds in value just because they did not suit him in some trifling particular' (David Hiorns, 'Coventry Times', 18 Nov 1896). As taste turned away from the Gothic in general and Skidmore's sort of metalwork more particularly, he became just as unfashionable as he had once been modish, with Scott's own pupils coming to reject what they saw as 'gimcrack brasswork screens and gas-brackets with their vulgar blue paint, from the eminent firm of Skidmore' (J. J. Stevenson in 'Transactions of the RIBA', 1876-7, 225). He was forced to surrender control of his company in 1872, and went with a much reduced firm to work at nearby Meriden. This too was taken over in the 1880s, leaving Skidmore -- by now nearly blind as the result of an accident -- dependent on his freeman's pension and a fund got up to support him in 1894. He died, 'in rather humble circumstances' ('Coventry Times', 18 Nov 1896) at 118 Eagle Street, Coventry, on 13 November 1896 and was buried with his parents. 
After his death, Skidmore's reputation continued to decline. The twentieth-century revulsion against Victorian design led to the destruction or removal of much of his work. Even the Hereford screen was eventually taken down, denounced by the dean for its 'incongruity and over-obtrusiveness' (R. P. Price, 'The Times', 26 Aug 1965). Although his obituarists claimed that he had worked in twenty-four cathedrals, over 300 churches, and more than a dozen Oxford and Cambridge chapels, he seemed destined to remain forgotten when he was not condemned. 
In 1993, however, a campaign was started to raise funds for the restoration of the dismantled and decaying screen from Hereford Cathedral and in 1998 Skidmore's work at the Albert Memorial was restored. In 2000 a plaque in his memory was unveiled in Coventry at the site of his Alma Street workshop. A year later, in 2001, after the most expensive conservation project ever undertaken by the museum, the Hereford screen was installed at the V&A. It is now seen as 'one of the monuments of High Victorian art and a masterpiece in the Gothic Revival style' (http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-hereford-screen/).

Barton, Robert (d. 1540), sea captain and administrator, known to the English as the pirate Hob a Barton, was one of three sons of John Barton, sea captain in Leith, the port of Edinburgh. Some time prior to 1476 his father's ship and goods were captured by Portuguese ships. John senior was dead by 1494, when James IV granted Robert and his brother John letters of marque against the Portuguese while not authorizing their use. In 1497 James employed Robert to escort Perkin Warbeck on his departure from Scotland. Over the next ten years he undertook various commissions for the king in France and Flanders, including purchase of ships and naval supplies. He was also involved in James's shipbuilding schemes in Scotland. His trading ventures brought him considerable wealth which he invested in property, notably the lands of Over Barnton, acquired from the crown in 1508. 
In July 1507 James renewed the letters of marque in favour of Robert and John and their brother Andrew Barton. In 1508 Robert, having captured a Portuguese ship, was arrested in the Scottish staple port of Veere and was released only after strong protests by James. Although the letters of marque were suspended in June 1510, the Bartons continued their depredations, including seizure of goods belonging to English merchants. After Andrew's death in 1511 Robert took service under the French flag and renewed his attacks on English shipping. He was still involved with James IV's navy and in May 1513 took command of a new Scottish ship, the 'Lion', at Honfleur. His surviving brother, John, who sailed with the Scottish fleet to France in July 1513, died later that year. 
Early in 1514 the 'Lion' had to take refuge in Corunna, where Barton and an envoy sent by the Scottish council to John Stewart, duke of Albany, were taken prisoner, though they were released when France and Spain agreed a truce. In the following year Barton returned to France to escort Albany to Scotland. On 12 October 1516 Albany, as governor of Scotland, appointed Barton comptroller, responsible for collecting revenues from the property (crown lands and customs) and defraying the cost of the king's and governor's households. Though Gavin Douglas denounced the appointment of 'ane very pyrett and sey-revare' as comptroller (BL, Cotton MS Caligula B.iii, fol. 311), Barton's acumen and private resources enabled him to hold the office far longer than any of his predecessors. In 1519 he earned the gratitude of the queen mother, Margaret Tudor, by lending her his own money when she was on the point of pawning her jewels and unable to pay her household expenses. Nevertheless, internal unrest and intermittent hostilities with England depressed crown revenues, while expenditure on the king, governor, and queen mother was difficult to contain. Following James V's assumption of personal rule in July 1524 his household expenditure outstripped Barton's ability to fund it. On 30 July 1525 Barton warned that the crown's property could not sustain the burden and protested that whatever might happen in future should not be laid to his charge since 'he has done his exact diligence, spendit his awn geire and may sustene na forrare' ('APS', '1424-1567', 296). On 17 August 1525 James Colville replaced him as comptroller. 
Approached by the deposed Christian II to assist him in recovering the throne of Denmark, Barton had agreed to provide a small fleet of ships. Though this does not appear to have materialized, his heirs were to claim he had spent money that had not been repaid. In 1527 he procured the release of some of Christian's sailors arrested in Scotland, receiving arms and munitions from Christian's chancellor as security for his expenditure. His plans for assisting Christian were frustrated by James V's seizure of the munitions for use against the earl of Angus and his own return to office on Colville's resignation. 
On 6 March 1529 James appointed Barton treasurer, comptroller, great custumar, master of the coin, master of the artillery, and conservator of the mines of Scotland, to which he added custumar of Edinburgh and chamberlain-depute of Galloway. Though these were the most extensive financial powers held by any subject since the 1420s, they were undermined by the priority given to repaying Colville and a previous treasurer, Sir John Campbell. Moreover, James had embarked on an expensive building programme for the royal palaces. By August 1530 Barton's deficit as comptroller had risen to $7467 Scots, equivalent to a year's net income from the property. On 9 September Barton was again replaced by Colville as comptroller and soon afterwards by William Stewart as treasurer. By December 1530 Barton was in serious difficulties with his creditors, especially royal officers and servants who were distraining his lands and goods for payment of sums that had been allowed in his accounts. Because these were really the king's debts, the council gave Barton protection until he was repaid. Although repayment in annual instalments was promised, these came only intermittently. In July 1536 James granted protection to Barton, who was 'of gret age, febill and vaik in persoun' (Hannay, 'Acts', 456), probably so that he could accompany the king to France. Nevertheless, in June 1538 the lords of council ruled that this protection was invalid. They found Barton guilty of deforcing a royal officer acting for one of his creditors, though their sentence of escheat and imprisonment was not carried out. Barton is recorded as still living on 27 February 1540, but he had died by 23 March following, when James V replied to a demand by Christian II's daughter, the countess palatine of the Rhine, for the goods entrusted to Barton. Professing ignorance of the matter, James claimed he would have seen to restitution, had it not been that Barton was dead and had her envoy been willing to wait to sue his heirs. In 1541 Barton's widow and his eldest son John renounced sums still due to him from James V in return for a pension for two of his younger sons. About that time John Barton obtained renewal of the letters of marque against the Portuguese. They were suspended by the privy council in 1561 and finally revoked by parliament in 1563. 
Barton's first wife, Elizabeth Jameson, died possibly before 1507 and certainly by 1509, the probable year of his second marriage, to Elizabeth Crawford, daughter of Thomas Crawford of Bonnington and widow of Gilbert Edmonston, sea captain, of Leith. From his first marriage Barton had three sons, John Barton of Duddingston, Henry, and James; and a daughter, Margaret, who married James Sandilands of Calder. In 1511 he had granted all his lands to Robert, his son from his second marriage, who married his ward, Barbara Mowbray, the heiress of Barnbougle, and took the name of Mowbray.

Campbell, Katherine, countess of Crawford (d. 1578), noblewoman, was the eldest daughter of Sir John Campbell (d. 1546), first knight of Calder ['see under 'Campbell family of Cawdor], and Muriel (1498/9-1573x5), heir of Cawdor. She married first, before 1 October 1539, James Ogilvy (died 1547), master of Ogilvy and heir to Airlie. They had five children, three sons and two daughters. When the master was killed at Pinkie on 10 September 1547, Katherine became tutrix to the children, including her son James Ogilvy, fifth Lord Ogilvy. 
Katherine subsequently married David Lindsay of Edzell, ninth earl of Crawford (died 1558), no later than 12 November 1550, when she was infeft in a conjunct fee of the barony of Ferne. They had seven children, five sons and two daughters. Their eldest son was David Lindsay of Glenesk, who became heir to Edzell but not to Crawford -- the latter title reverted to the direct line on the death of the ninth earl on 20 September 1558. Another son was John Lindsay of Balcarres. 
The countess of Crawford was appointed tutrix and sole guardian to the children of her second marriage, and until her offspring reached maturity she managed the affairs of the heirs to both Airlie and Edzell. Her widow's terce became the subject of extended litigation between her and the tenth earl, and was not settled until 1563. Katherine did not marry again, but the English ambassador Randolph noted in a letter of 1565 that she was a very eligible widow whose fortunes in yet another marriage were being considered by her kinsman, the fifth earl of Argyll. 
Katherine maintained a close working relationship with Donald Campbell, Cistercian abbot of Coupar and curator of her eldest son, James Ogilvy of Airlie. The contents of Coupar Abbey were entrusted to her care by Campbell when his house was purged of 'Idolis and Imagis and tubernacuilis' in 1559 (Bardgett, 73). On Donald's death in 1562 the goods and gear of the abbey (except the commend) were granted to the earl of Argyll, who in taking up his gift removed from Katherine's possession some gold coins and rings bequeathed to her personally by the late abbot. Katherine spent four years in litigation trying to recover these items. 
After 1560, and more so after 1567, the countess of Crawford found her loyalties divided in the aftermath of the religious reformation and in the political turmoil that followed Queen Mary's abdication. She was not only the tutrix of a major house but a widow with the interests of many children to uphold. The eldest sons of each marriage, James, Lord Ogilvy, and David Lindsay of Glenesk, followed the earl of Crawford into the queen's party during the 1560s. The two daughters of her Ogilvy marriage, however, married into the protestant families of Erskine of Dun and Ogilvy of Inverquharity. The two eldest sons of her marriage to David Lindsay of Edzell were sent to the University of Paris in the mid-1560s under the tutelage of the protestant James Lawson. Their education in France was a condition of Dame Katherine's purchase of the tack of the kirk of Menmure, to which her second (Lindsay) son, John, was collated in 1565. Her interest in their education and her expenses are documented in letters between Lawson and herself. 
Katherine's religious opinions after 1560 are difficult to ascertain. She hosted Queen Mary overnight at Edzell in August 1562, and alluded to having attended the court of the queen regent in the 1550s, but Donald Campbell's adherence to the congregation probably brought her into the protestant camp. She maintained a close relationship with John Erskine of Dun, the superintendent of Angus and the Mearns, who borrowed money from her in 1571, and her testament suggests that she had greater confidence in her younger sons, who served the kirk, than she had in the elder two. 
The letters from James Lawson and other extant documents, in the Crawford manuscripts and elsewhere, reveal Dame Katherine as a capable individual and administrator. She fought for her rights and for the protection of her interests in the courts. She dealt with merchants, negotiated contracts, and loaned money, ensuring the security of each contract by having it registered in the books of council. She kept around her a very loyal group of servants who carried out her wishes, wrote and witnessed her business, and provided advice when necessary. In April 1570 she made an agreement with her old antagonist the tenth earl of Crawford, whereby David Lindsay of Glenesk would marry the earl's daughter Helen without tocher. This arrangement finally brought to rest a long-standing dispute between the earl and the heirs of Edzell. 
The countess of Crawford dictated her latterwill, without pious sentiment, at the castle of Brechin on 10 August 1578. She died there on 1 October following, and was buried at Edzell later the same month.

Clark, Alexander, of Balbirnie (d. 1591), merchant and provost of Edinburgh, is of unknown origins. He was in the service of and related by marriage to Henry Balnaves, a former royal secretary who was imprisoned for his protestant views in 1543. Clark formed an apparently irregular union with Agnes Scheves of Kemback, whose sister Christian was Balnaves's wife, and maintained a connection with Balnaves until the latter's death in 1579, when Clark was still keeping his accounts. In May 1546 both men were among the castilians who seized St Andrews Castle and murdered Cardinal David Beaton. Clark was captured at the end of the siege, in July 1547, and in company with John Knox was consigned to the galleys. He accompanied Knox to England after their release in February 1549. On 7 April both received rewards from the English privy council. Clark next appeared in Scotland on 20 February 1553, when he received a respite from Governor Arran for his treasonable activities in St Andrews in 1546-7. His activities in the interim are unknown, but it is possible that while in England he met other exiled Scottish dissidents, including William Harlaw, John Spottiswoode, and John Willock. 
By 1554 Clark was in France, where he appeared in the lists of the Scots archers in the service of Henri II. He did not return to Scotland with Balnaves in 1556, and in 1559 was promoted to the king's personal bodyguard, the Scots guard. He may have had indirect connections with the company of 'young' Arran, son of the duke of Chatelherault, who fled home in the summer of 1559. By 1560 Clark was an informant for Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, English ambassador in France. He was reported as a 'principal doer' in recent religious 'stirs', presumably the conspiracy of Amboise of that year (Hardwicke, 1.155). He may also have been Knox's source for events at the French court at this period. The precise date of his return to Scotland is unknown. On his return he enjoyed the confidence both of English diplomats and of Lord Seton, Queen Mary's Roman Catholic, pro-French envoy, who arrived in Scotland in the autumn of 1560. Clark was regarded by the English as a useful mediator between Arran and Lord James Stewart, and from at least early 1561 his contacts reached as high as Sir William Cecil, principal secretary to Elizabeth I. 
In February 1561 Clark was granted a divorce from Agnes Scheves by the kirk session of St Andrews. His second wife was Margaret Boyle and he purchased for himself and Margaret the estate of Balbirnie in Fife in 1565. In March 1561 he acted as an agent for Arran; though he refused to go to France to establish contact with the king of Navarre, he did undertake a mission to see Cecil. It was, as a client of James Stewart, earl of Moray, however, that Clark's career prospered after 1560. From 1561 to 1564 he acted as collector of the thirds of benefices. On 10 April 1564 he agreed to a contract, registered in the records of the burgh of Edinburgh, with Robert Lekpreuik, official printer to the general assembly, for an edition of the 'Book of Common Order', drawn up by English exiled ministers in Geneva in 1558, together with the metrical 'Psalms' of David. The arrangements demonstrate Clark's French contacts: Clark supplied paper from France and allowed Lekpreuik to purchase new printing irons in roman and music types, also probably from France, superseding his old, cruder black-letter type. Clark would hold the stock, releasing it in batches of a hundred, until the edition sold out. 
In January 1565 Clark was made a burgess and guild of Edinburgh 'gratis', at Moray's request, an unusual concession to anyone other than the monarch. Remarkably, he was immediately co-opted onto the town council. His links with the English agent Thomas Randolph were those of confidant and financier as well as informer. His account of the Palm Sunday riot of 1565 is remarkably frank about protestant violence and to be contrasted with Knox's censored version. And Clark, who claimed to be Randolph's 'treasurer', also enjoyed the exchange of ribald gossip about the court and the Englishman's fruitless pursuit of Mary Beaton, one of the queen's ladies of the royal household. 
Along with the town clerk, Alexander Guthrie, Clark was one of the four captains of armed bands of Edinburgh protestants discovered secretly mustering on the crags, close to the royal palace of Holyroodhouse, in July 1565, shortly before the abortive conspiracy planned by Moray against Queen Mary. Among those who stood as sureties for his appearance in court were two leading protestants, Patrick, Lord Lindsay of the Byres, and Robert Campbell of Kinzeancleuch, long-time friend of Knox. Like both Guthrie and Lindsay of the Byres, Clark was also involved in the events of 9 March 1566, when both the queen's servant David Riccio and her Dominican confessor John Black were murdered. A strong streak of pragmatism, demonstrated in his later career, first became evident when his rehabilitation after the Riccio murder was completed by his appearance on a leet (a list of designated candidates) for Edinburgh's town council, drawn up by Queen Mary in October 1566. A month earlier, the queen had officially asked for a passport for him through England to France; during this trip he acted as an envoy between Moray and both Cecil and Elizabeth. 
Despite being a Marian nominee Clark survived the queen's fall, remaining on Edinburgh's council throughout the period from 1566 until late 1570, which included Moray's regency. He also represented the burgh at the convention held at Perth in July 1569. Clark profited in various ways from his links with Moray during his regency. Along with William Birnie, a leading Edinburgh merchant, he was granted a licence in February 1568 to strip the lead from Elgin Cathedral, but their loot was intercepted by the fifth earl of Huntly. In February 1569 he was one of the commissioners appointed by the regent to raise a force to subdue Huntly and the other queen's men in the north. His business activities, like those of Birnie's widow, Helen Acheson, and her new husband, Archibald Stewart, were caught up in the civil war, their goods in France being seized through the intervention of a Marian agent, Sebastien Danelour. Although nominally a supporter of the king's men, Clark, like Stewart, lobbied both parties and their connections in England and France for restitution. In September 1569 both men were recommended to Mary, imprisoned at Tutbury by William Maitland of Lethington, even thoughMaitland acknowledged that Clark had previously been an adversary. Along with Stewart he lent money to William Kirkcaldy of Grange, leader of the queen's men under siege in Edinburgh Castle from 1570 to 1573, in return for holding some of the royal jewels as security. In June 1573, the trio of Clark, Acheson, and Stewart were called before the privy council to deliver up the jewels. After that, the business partners went their separate ways politically. 
Ever a survivor, even if one who occasionally wrestled with his conscience, Clark rose continuously throughout the complex, troubled years between 1578 and 1584 to become provost of Edinburgh; he first achieved office by means of a leet which Regent Morton tried to impose on the capital. Despite his close links with Morton, Clark survived his fall in 1580 by joining in the clamour for his execution. Notwithstanding his protestations of loyalty to the 'amity' with England, he was criticized by both English agents and his old radical protestant friends for being 'too pliable' to the royal court during the period of the rise of Esme Stewart, who became duke of Lennox in 1581. Clark was also vilified by Andrew Melville for failing to support the outspoken Edinburgh minister, John Durie, exiled from the burgh in May 1582 for his criticism of Lennox from the pulpit. Despite having survived as provost during the period of the Ruthven regime in 1582-3, he was nominated provost again by the royalist administration of the earl of Arran in September 1583. But in the crisis which followed the Black Acts Parliament of May 1584 and the flight of Edinburgh's radical ministers, Clark regained his conscience: when confronted with a royal letter condemning the exiles, he refused to subscribe to it. His political career petered out after this crisis, though he served one more year on the borough council (1584-5). 
Clark died in 1591, leaving a net estate of $3111 Scots and was buried in Edinburgh in Greyfriars churchyard. In the 1560s he had been one of the capital's wealthiest forty merchants. His chequered career is testimony to the acerbic comment of David Calderwood that the prime interest of Edinburgh lay in its 'particular' (Calderwood, 5.177-8). An early protestant figure of impeccable pedigree and impressive connections, as well as a long-standing example of the 'better sort' who served the English interest, Clark was above all a pragmatist.

Fleming, Jean, countess of Cassillis (1553/4-1609), noblewoman, was the only child of James Fleming, fourth Lord Fleming (1533/4-1558), and his wife, Lady Barbara Hamilton, the eldest daughter of James Hamilton, second earl of Arran. The estates and title passed to her uncle, John Fleming, fifth Lord Fleming, of whom Jean Fleming complained to the privy council in 1579 that he had failed to provide the 4000 merks promised for her marriage. She had a sixth part of the revenues of the lordship of Fleming assigned to her in September 1579 and was granted the lands of Thankerton and Biggar following her resignation as heir to her grandfather in 1583. 
In January 1583 Jean married John Maitland of Thirlestane (1543-1595), later James VI's chief minister, who became chancellor in 1587 and was elevated to the peerage as Lord Thirlestane in 1590. An English observer commented in 1589 that she was 'a wise woman and half chancellor when he is at home', although this was a rare comment on her involvement in politics ('Salisbury Papers', 3.446-7). In 1590, the year of James's marriage to Anne of Denmark, she had a daughter, Anna (died 1609). Two years later she incurred the queen's displeasure as a result of making indiscreet remarks about the latter's relationship with Francis Stewart, fifth earl of Bothwell, within Anne's hearing. This contributed to the friction between the queen and Maitland, and it was said in 1593 that Anne still 'cannot hitherto well brook his wife' ('CSP Scot.', 11.233-4). The following year the Maitlands had a son, John. 
Maitland died on 3 October 1595. Now a wealthy widow, Jean took a second husband, the much younger John Kennedy, fifth earl of Cassillis (1574/5-1615), in November 1597; the marriage was conducted with some haste and excited attention at court as she was a woman 'of good years, not like to bear children' (BL, Cotton MS Caligula B. iv, fol. 244). Cassillis's union with a woman twice his age was a source of amusement and an embarrassment to the young earl's associates: one commentator at court declared Cassillis to be 'clengit out of credit both here and at home with his own friends' since his marriage ('CSP Scot.', 13.I.329). By January 1598 King James owed the new countess 7000 merks and when he offered Cassillis the treasurership in spring 1599, it was rumoured that James's motive was that 'his wifes purse should be opened for her rose nobles' ('CSP Scot.', 13.I.444). Although terms for his holding the office were agreed by mid-March, a fortnight later Cassillis had formally refused the job, worried by its financial implications and offended by the rumour. The matter was not resolved until spring 1600, but the couple entertained the king at Thirlestane Castle that February. 
While Cassillis was with James in London in 1603, the countess and her brother-in-law, Hugh Kennedy, master of Cassillis, were captured, and the countess briefly imprisoned, by Kennedy of Drummurchie, one of the faction with whom the earl was feuding. In April 1604 Cassillis was ordered to be warded in Blackness Castle and find $5000 as surety for his wife's protection after assaulting her in the presence of the council and dragging her out of the council chamber; he was imprisoned again for the same offence later in the year. 
In March 1609 the countess was 'havelie diseasit and under medicine', prescribed a diet which excluded fish, and granted permission to eat meat in Lent ('Reg. PCS', 8.256-7). She died on 23 June 1609 aged fifty-five and was buried in St Mary's Church, Haddington, alongside her first husband. The Maitland family monument, erected by their son and heir, John Maitland, first earl of Lauderdale (1594-1645), depicts the recumbent effigies of Jean Fleming and Maitland of Thirlestane and also commemorates their daughter, Anna.

Fullarton, Adam (d. in or after 1595), religious activist and civic administrator, was born in Ayrshire into the family of Fullarton of Dreghorn. His family had links with the small group of Lollards of Kyle in the 1490s and was early converted to protestantism. Adam was either the brother or cousin of the protestant laird John Fullarton of Dreghorn, who subscribed the Ayr bond in 1562 and whose son became minister of Kilmaurs in 1589 and of Dreghorn in 1590. His mother was either Elizabeth Dalrymple or Helen Chalmers. 
Adam Fullarton was admitted a burgess and guild of Edinburgh on 24 December 1549, though it is not clear if this was through the familiar route for outsiders of marriage into a prominent merchant family, since the origins of his wife, Marjorie Roger (died 1583), are unknown. He first appeared on the town council in 1555-6. Both he and his wife were significant figures in the capital's emerging 'privy kirk' in the mid-1550s; she belonged to John Knox's 'dear sisters' of Edinburgh, with whom he corresponded both before and after his brief visit to Scotland in 1555-6, and her testament, drawn up in 1583, reveals a remarkable library of more than thirty books. It included English works by Cranmer and Hooper published during the reign of Edward VI, demonstrating the importance of English literature in nurturing urban protestantism in Scotland. 
In July 1559, when the lords of the congregation reached the capital and John Knox was appointed minister of the burgh church of St Giles, Fullarton emerged as the spokesman for the 'haill brether of the congregatioun' in the town, refusing the offer of a religious referendum made by the regent, Mary of Guise, on the grounds that 'God's truth should not be subject to the voting of men' (Marwick, 3.47-8). He was appointed a bailie on the town council brought to power in October 1559 by a purge by the protestant lords, and became probably the most significant protestant layman in the capital during the period that Knox was minister of Edinburgh (1559-72). He was on the council from 1559 to 1562, but like other militant protestants he lost office for much of the rest of the reign of Mary, queen of Scots; he regained office in 1567, during the regency of James Stewart, earl of Moray, and retained it until 1573. He became a bailie, dean of guild, and, briefly in the absence of the provost James MacGill, president of the burgh. 
Fullarton's roots may help explain Knox's close links with Ayrshire during the 1560s, when he was appointed a visiting commissioner four times. The connections of both men with Ayrshire also help to explain the militancy of the capital's protestant party. It was a letter from the uncompromising brethren of Kyle urging the rooting out of the idolatry of the mass, which led to a house to house search through the capital for Roman Catholic worshippers during Lent 1565; this resulted in the show trial and ritual beating up of a former chaplain of St Giles and provoked a riot by the burgh's Catholics on Palm Sunday. On 9 March 1566 -- the night on which Queen Mary's servant David Riccio was murdered -- Fullarton was one of twenty-one burgesses implicated in the killing of the queen's confessor, the Dominican friar John Black. The connection between the two deaths suggests that Fullarton had foreknowledge of both plots and saw them as a means for the radicals to regain control of the town council. 
After 1567 Fullarton served as a burgh commissioner: to parliament, to the convention of royal burghs, and to the general assembly, attending the important meeting at Leith in January 1572. He was a dean of guild on the council of the king's party exiled to Leith by the rival queen's party in June 1571. At Leith he was elected captain of the exiles' Edinburgh band, which he helped to provision, and he also lent sizeable sums to the king's lords, little of which seem to have been repaid. The testament of his wife, who died in 1583, recorded almost $1800 of outstanding debts owed by successive regents -- Moray, Lennox, and Mar. Fullarton's house was badly damaged during the year-long siege of the burgh (1571-2), and a claim for $3667 against unspecified persons for the spoiling of his goods and property remained unsettled at the time of his wife's death. Their joint estate was then recorded as amounting to $10,717 Scots; however, all but $441 was made up of unpaid debts, many of them unrecoverable. Fullarton himself was not among the merchant elite -- he was consistently assessed outside the top 20 per cent of taxpayers. 
In February 1575 Fullarton's close links with Regent Morton were rewarded by the grant of a lucrative twelve-year contract for the lead mines at Glengonner, near Leadhills in Lanarkshire, and in Orkney; Fullarton shared the contract with Morton's kinsman George, later known as Douglas of Parkhead. His long devotion to the 'amity' with England, for which he claimed in 1584 to have worked 'nycht and day', brought him into contact with the highest reaches of Elizabeth's government: his 'verre good freindis' included Bedford, Burghley, Hutton, Hunsdon, Killigrew, and Leicester ('CSP Scot.', 1584-5, 285). In April 1560 he was sent on a secret mission to England. 
In May 1577 Fullarton was appointed an emissary to pursue a series of actions by Scottish merchants against English pirates; the posting lasted over two years, proved largely fruitless, resulted in legal action against him by other Edinburgh merchants, and brought him considerable unpopularity. His uncompromising religious radicalism persisted into his last years. He suffered for his part in the welcome given to the radical minister John Durie, who had been critical of the royal court, on the latter's return to the town in September 1582, and he was himself exiled from the burgh after the Black Acts Parliament of May 1584 and incarcerated in Dumbarton Castle in August that year. By September 1585, however, when he was again sent to lobby Sir Francis Walsingham over the piracy cases, Fullarton seems to have been rehabilitated. A settlement was finally reached in December 1587. The last glimpse of Fullarton in the records comes on 23 June 1595, when his best wishes to Robert Bowes were passed on by an English agent in Edinburgh. His death is not recorded.

Guthrie, Alexander (d. 1582), civic administrator and religious activist, is first recorded on 10 January 1549, when he was admitted burgess and guild brother of Edinburgh. Nothing is known of his parentage or education. He became a lawyer who also engaged in trade, and was appointed common clerk of Edinburgh, probably in 1553. Although his own activities among Edinburgh's growing circle of protestants in the 1550s are not recorded, his wife, Janet Henryson (or Henderson), was one of the group of wives of influential burgesses with whom John Knox corresponded while in exile in Geneva. She was addressed as his 'beloved sister' in a letter of March 1558 ('Knox's History', 4.247). 
In April 1559 Guthrie's career became embroiled in controversy, when he was arrested by the Catholic provost George, fifth Lord Seton. Later Guthrie was sent, along with the protestant minority group on the town council, to negotiate with the lords of congregation when they reached the capital in June 1559. Along with Adam Fullarton and Alexander Clark he became one of the most consistent of the 'better sort' who relied on the 'amity' with England. He was a regular informant for the English ambassador, Thomas Randolph, from at least October 1560 onwards. To his Roman Catholic enemies he was known as King Guthrie (Lynch, 24). As such he took a leading role alongside Knox in the consolidation of Edinburgh's reformation by the new regime, brought to power by a coup in 1559-60. 
Guthrie's role in the government of the town increased through his continuous presence on the burgh council between 1561 and 1565. From 1562 he was also dean of guild, with responsibility for oversight of the burgh church of St Giles, for which Knox was first minister, and he was a member of the kirk session in 1561-2, the only year before the 1570s for which session records exist. Holding both burgh and political office simultaneously was unusual. It gave Guthrie a central place in the affairs of the capital in these years. He did not scruple to become involved in conspiracy and violence. He was one of the four 'captains' of protestant armed bands arrested for drilling in the royal park near the palace of Holyroodhouse in July 1565, shortly before the abortive coup led by James Stewart, earl of Moray. His connections with Edinburgh's legal establishment and with key protestant dissidents within the royal administration were demonstrated by the appearance in court as one of his sureties of Patrick Bellenden of Stenness, brother of the justice clerk John Bellenden of Auchnoull. In 1556 Guthrie had acted as godfather to one of the children of another influential legal family, the Bannatynes, which was in turn closely connected to the Bellendens. 
In 1566 Guthrie was implicated in the murder of the queen's servant David Riccio. After fleeing with two prominent conspirators who both held high office, Bellenden of Auchnoull and James McGill, clerk register, Guthrie was outlawed and replaced as town clerk by a royal nominee, David Chalmers, despite a formal protest by the town council. The fact that he was among the last of the Riccio conspirators to be granted a remission, in December 1566, when he was also restored to office, confirms his prominence in the affair. His subsequent career was less colourful. He continued as town clerk until his death on 23 August 1582, though he had briefly been charged with treason for failing to leave the burgh for some six months after its occupation by the queen's party in April 1571; but he successfully denied presiding over meetings of the burgh court during that time. Although Guthrie again served on the council in 1576-8, his final years seem to have been spent largely in the burgh archives in his care; the earliest records of the burgh, dating from 1403, exist only as a partial transcript devised under his supervision in 1579-80. Guthrie was succeeded in office by his son, Alexander. His wife, who survived him, did not lose her radical opinions in her old age. She was exiled from the capital along with the wives of the burgh's exiled dissident ministers, in the autumn of 1584. She lived until 1600.

Henrisoun, James (d. before 1570), merchant and propagandist, was apparently a native of Edinburgh and by 1527 owned land on the south side of the High Street. He made his living principally by trading to the Low Countries, where he bought military supplies for the crown. In this he co-operated with Francis Aikman, another Edinburgh burgess who was also a protestant, and he came to share Aikman's religious beliefs. He made repeated efforts to secure the position of conservator of Scottish privileges in the Netherlands, and eventually did so on 16 January 1543 from the second earl of Arran, the governor of Scotland, who was then inclined towards protestantism, but he lost it again the following year; in May 1544, as the regime became increasingly Catholic, Henrisoun presented himself to Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, during the earl's assault on Edinburgh (when Henrisoun's own house was burnt) and asked to be taken into the service of Henry VIII. Consequently he went to London with the English army as it returned home, and as 'James Harryson, Scottishman' was recorded in March 1546 as 'received to the King's service with a gift of 200 crowns by year', which was then twelve months in arrears ('LP Henry VIII', vol. 21, pt 1, no. 462). 
After three years in obscurity Henrisoun's time came following the old king's death, when Seymour, now duke of Somerset and lord protector, adopted a much more forward Scottish policy. Henry had made little use of propaganda, but under Somerset five significant pieces were printed and circulated, and Henrisoun had a major hand in at least three of them. The most important was the first, 'An exhortacion to the Scottes to conforme them selfes to the honorable, expedient, and godly union betwene the twoo realmes of Englande and Scotlande' ('ESTC', 12857), probably written in summer 1547 to accompany the English campaign which culminated in Somerset's great victory at Pinkie on 10 September. Dedicated to the protector, it formed part of an English attempt to persuade the Scots to agree to the provisions of the treaty of Greenwich of 1543, which had stipulated that Queen Mary was to marry Prince Edward (now Edward VI) in 1553. In an argument which makes massive use of the word 'Britain' (about 100 appearances) Henrisoun argues that the island had once formed a political unity and urges that for its inhabitants the single word 'Briton' should be substituted for the 'hatefull termes of Scottes and Englishmen' ('Exhortacion', 228). There is heavy stress on the material benefits which will flow from union and emphasis too on how such a marriage can help the two countries to 'agre in the concorde & unite of one religion, & the same the pure, syncere & incorrupt religion of christ' (ibid., 231). 
Two further treatises followed soon afterwards. In September 1547 came a 'Proclamation' ('ESTC', 7811) and in February 1548 'An epistle or exhortacion, to unite & peace' ('ESTC', 9181). Both urge the Scots to commit themselves to union with England through the marriage of Mary and Edward while simultaneously rejecting links with France and the papacy, and each stresses English magnanimity and the likely gains for the Scots. No author is named, but it seems certain that Henrisoun was closely involved in their production. Then in July 1548 he submitted to the king 'The godly and golden booke for concorde of England and Scotland' (TNA: PRO, SP 50/4, fols. 128-37), an even more radical manifesto of the benefits which Scotland will enjoy through union with England. As well as swifter justice, a revitalization of the personnel and structure of the church, and security of tenure for 'poor labourers of the grounde', Henrisoun advocates instruction for the Scots in a range of modern skills, such as mining, draining marshlands, and making sawmills, and the provision of 100 ships, along with an equal number of instructors, to revive the fishing industry in the Scottish ports. There was even to be a canal 'to drawe the weste and easte sees togither so that partable vessles shall goo between' (Merriman, 'Rough Wooings', 284). By now, however, continued Scottish resistance was causing Somerset to lose interest in proposals for peaceful union. Henrisoun, by contrast, appears to have believed in the cause he was promoting and in 1549 remonstrated at length with the protector over the counter-productive ravages now being inflicted by English armies on lowland Scotland. 
Following Somerset's fall from power in October 1549 Henrisoun found himself without either patron or employment and complained to the privy council of the government's ingratitude and neglect, threatening to detail his misfortunes in print. He had lost his burgess status in Edinburgh by 1546 and his property in the town in 1549. Approaches to fellow Scots, and even to Mary of Guise, brought no result. Restoration and rehabilitation finally came from an unforeseeable direction. In April 1551 Robert Stewart, a member of the king of France's Scots guard, arrived in London and sought out the duke of Northumberland, now head of the English government, with a plot so extraordinary that at first he would not divulge the details to Northumberland, but revealed them to Henrisoun instead, thinking him to be 'un bon Anglois' (Merriman, 'James Henrisoun', 100). A kinsman of her cook, Stewart had easy access to Queen Mary's kitchen, and he proposed to put poison in the young queen's food. Henrisoun promptly revealed Stewart's scheming, the would-be assassin was arrested and transported to France and execution, and the whistle-blower reaped his reward. 
By January 1553 Henrisoun was back in Scotland, enjoying a pension from Mary of Guise, and on 21 May 1554 he was once more made conservator of Scottish privileges in the Low Countries. Failing health meant that he had to employ a deputy, but on 30 October 1555 he was made overseer of the crown's mines and fishings, for his services 'in conservatioun of hir hienes persoun the tyme he was in Ingland' ('Register of the Privy Seal', 1548-56, no. 3068). Meanwhile he remained intellectually vigorous. On 7 October 1552 he presented a set of strikingly original proposals for the regeneration of Edinburgh, including a school, a playground, a covered market, piped water to four fountains, and a new town hall, or tollbooth. Many of these suggestions progressed from Henrisoun's drawing-board into reality, none so dramatically as his remarkable vision of a new hospital with 'ane priest, ane surrigiane, ane meddicinar, and 40 beddis' (Merriman, 'James Henrisoun', 102). By 1562 contributions were being collected (Henrisoun himself gave money) and construction began in 1567, to be completed in 1578. Henrisoun lived to see only the beginning of the work, since he appears to have been dead by 1570.

Ley, John (1549?-1604), explorer, was the third of four sons who lived to adulthood of Henry Ley of Teffont Evias, Wiltshire (died 1574), and his wife, Dionysia (died 1589), the younger of the two daughters of Walter Seymour of Berwick St John, Wiltshire. He was educated at Winchester College, and attended Oxford University and Clement's Inn, but 'beinge nothing affected to Studie the lawe He betooke himself to marshiall Courses' (Wilts. & Swindon HC, 366/1, fol. 8'v'). He accompanied Martin Frobisher on two of his three voyages in search of a north-west passage (1576-8). He later served with the rebels in the Low Countries 'longe tyme', rising to the rank of captain. Ley also undertook several privateering voyages 'at his owne charge'. He was captain of the 'John Young' of Southampton in 1590. In 1592 he commanded the 'Alcedo' in Frobisher's fleet, dispatched by the earl of Cumberland to seek East Indies carracks. Although Ley went to Ireland in August 1594 with the new lord deputy, Sir William Russell, his contacts in the seafaring community appear to have kept him abreast of Sir Walter Ralegh's efforts to discover El Dorado in Guiana and to have inspired him to venture in search of it also. 
Ley was among the earliest Englishmen to explore the coast of Guiana and the first to enter the Amazon. He sailed from Dartmouth with one ship on Shrove Tuesday 1597. He sighted what he called the 'westerne Cape' of the Amazon on 23 March before running up the coast to anchor in the Wiapoco (Oyapock). There he assembled a shallop and proceeded to explore the lower reaches of every river up to the Curratyne (Corantijn) for potential routes to El Dorado, making numerous contacts with Amerindian groups in the process. In the Curratyne Ley met up with Ralegh's 'Watte', commanded by Leonard Berry. The captains made for the Windward Islands and then parted company. Ley traded for tobacco with natives at St Lucia and took a Spanish frigate off Cumana. He returned to London with his prize on 24 August, his ship having arrived some time earlier. 
In March 1598, when Cumberland's fleet set forth for Puerto Rico, Ley accompanied it as far as Lanzarote and then made off alone for Guiana in his prize frigate, now called the 'Black Ley'. He reached the Amazon delta in June and spent about a month exploring 300 miles upriver, hoping to pick up news of an empire of Amazon women. He visited various native settlements, noting the longhouse dwellings built on piles above the flood. He found their inhabitants less welcoming than the natives he had contacted a year earlier. From the Amazon, Ley stopped in all the rivers he had visited previously, before making for the Caribbean and thence for England. 
It is not known why Ley delayed his third voyage to Guiana until October 1601. He dispatched an account of his two earlier voyages and of his progress to date in the third to his brother James Ley, the future earl of Marlborough, in a letter from the Cape Verde Islands in December. John Ley's account, a response to his brother's plea for a record of his discoveries, also contained lists of the rivers between the Amazon and the Orinoco, and of the peoples who inhabited them. He included descriptions of their customs and local fauna, as well as tales of monstrous peoples such as those 'without heads, haveinge their Eies, nose and mouth in their breastes', or 'with two faces one behinde and thother before, fower Armes, fower legs... and they goe and come and shoote both waies'. Ley probably touched in the Amazon in 1602. He certainly visited the Wiapoco, leaving a man there whom Charles Leigh met when he entered the river later in the year. Having 'Referred the settinge downe' of his third voyage after his return, John Ley 'was prevented by death' (Wilts. & Swindon HC, 366/1, fol. 15'v'). He died in London on 7 June 1604, and was buried in the chancel of St Andrew by the Wardrobe.

Atkinson, Mabel (1876-1958), feminist and socialist, was born on 22 May 1876 at Ridley Mill, Broomley, near Stocksfield, in rural Northumberland. She was the daughter of John Boland Atkinson, inspector of mines, and his wife, Jane, 'nee' Elliott ('b'. 1853), feminist and militant suffragette; she had four brothers and one sister. Her parents were, as she later said, progressive and sympathetic on female education and employment. As a young woman, however, she chafed against restrictive middle-class Victorian behaviour and dress; she considered the bicycle 'the first great emancipation' for women (Palmer). She was one of the first women undergraduates at Glasgow University, where she arrived in 1894, two years after women students had been admitted to the university, to be taught in separate classes from the men but with common examinations; she remembered it as a 'delightful experience of freedom' (ibid.). She graduated in 1900 (MA, first-class honours) with the medal for the most distinguished arts graduate of the year. She then pursued research at Glasgow and the London School of Economics before studying for a year at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania. That research, published as 'Local Government in Scotland' (1904), was the first survey of the subject and a characteristically opinionated argument for reform. 
In 1904 Atkinson returned to the north-east of England as a lecturer in philosophy and classics at Armstrong College, Durham. In 1908 she moved to London to be a Workers' Educational Association (WEA) tutor, a commitment to broadening education that was lifelong; she also lectured in economics at King's College for Women (part of London University) until 1915 and published an economics textbook with fellow lecturer Margaret McKillop in 1911. She wrote for the 'Daily News', on the gold standard, trade unionism, feminism, and -- a persistent personal and political theme -- the problem of celibacy for single, professional women, but left the paper over its position on women's suffrage. 
Atkinson joined the Fabian Society as an undergraduate in 1897 and became president of the Glasgow University group. Alongside the suffrage movement the Fabian Society was the main channel for her fierce political energy -- as a member, from 1906, of its local government group, where she led a study of local organization of labour; as a lecturer; as a founder member of the Fabian Society Women's Group in 1908; and as a reforming member of the Fabian executive from 1909 to 1919. She was vice-chair of the Federated Council of Women's Suffrage Societies and a frequent -- if initially shaky -- suffrage speaker; she was proud of taking part in every demonstration, as was her mother. She attempted to stand in the London county council election of 1910 but was not selected because she refused to denounce the suffrage agitation. Atkinson proposed the Fabian summer school and was education secretary, responsible for the general plan of events and the lecture programme. She participated enthusiastically in gymnastics on the lawn and, we can assume, in the 'unchaperoned flirtation' and 'surprisingly open' conversation commented on by Beatrice Webb ('Diary', 3.98). 
Atkinson's Fabian tract (no. 175), 'The Economic Foundations of the Women's Movement', published in June 1914, was a main outcome of the women's group's in-depth inquiry into how women's economic independence, particularly as mothers, could be achieved under socialism. An argument for maternal endowments (the forerunner of family allowances, for which Eleanor Rathbone would soon launch a campaign), it addresses 'a second generation of advanced women' facing 'a new set of problems' (p. 17), women who have economic independence 'so keenly appreciated and won by such fierce struggles', but only 'on condition of compulsory celibacy and... childlessness'. Because of marriage bans in most professional employment it was a 'forced alternative' that Atkinson herself faced (p. 18). 
Margaret Cole described Atkinson at this time as 'truculent' and 'something of a stormy element in Edwardian Fabianism' (Cole, 349). During the First World War she lectured on peace, signally failing to impress Virginia Woolf, attending her first Fabian event. She chaired the Fabian committee on the need for a supra-national authority, which contributed to the development of the League of Nations. She produced a densely argued study of infant mortality, 'Life-Saving in War-Time', for the Infant Welfare Propaganda Committee (1916); it is noteworthy for its practical sense of the social and economic circumstances of urban working-class mothers. 
On 2 July 1914 in Kensington, Atkinson made, in Cole's words, 'an unfortunate marriage' to an Australian journalist, Andrew Robert Barratt Palmer (1886-1948). When war broke out he joined up; in 1920 she followed him to Sydney but left and moved to Durban, South Africa, in early 1921. Then began a second career, under her married name, teaching economics and economic history at Natal Technical College, Durban (later Natal University College), and as director of the local WEA, and she soon gained a reputation for 'strong-mindedness and irritating persistence' (Vietzen, 'Beyond school', 53). In 1929 she joined the senate of the University of South Africa (she would knit when meetings became boring). She continued to write on economics and education and threw herself into local progressive causes, including the League of Nations study circle and the National Council of Women; she engaged with race relations and black trade union politics, becoming research secretary of the Joint Council of Europeans and Natives in Durban; she had a particular interest in Natal's Indian population. When Winifred Holtby visited South Africa in 1926 Palmer made clear to her 'the gravity of economic and racial antagonisms' (Brittain, 235); with Holtby she canvassed for support for the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union from British trade unions and Labour politicians, which led to the London Group on African Affairs. 
On formal retirement in 1936 Atkinson began a third career, for which she became well known in South Africa, working, as the university authorities observed, with her customary vigour to establish higher education for black, Asian, and other non-white students, initially unpaid and holding classes in her sitting room. Many of the students were teachers studying part-time so that classes were usually held at weekends with students coming long distances with considerable difficulty to attend. When a segregated section of the University of Natal for non-European education was set up in 1945 she became its director, justifying segregation as a first step, on the model of her own student days. Her approach was, unsurprisingly, shaped by her European liberal and colonialist frame of reference, and that segregationist compromise, and some interventions, came to be seen as highly problematic but she is remembered with gratitude by students. Non-European enrolment increased from 19 in 1936 to 351 in 1955, when, aged eighty and with failing eyesight, she again retired. 
It had been work that Atkinson undertook with 'a generous heart' (Marks, 6), 'pertinacity, idealism and practical sense' (ibid., 7) in the view of Dr Edgar Brookes, principal of Adams College, the African high school and college. Dr Sylvia Vietzen describes her as 'single-minded, shrewd, astringent on occasions, unremitting in work and formidable in intellectual power' (Vietzen, 'Mabel Palmer', 98). She was often, and remains, controversial. In later years her girth and thick glasses, plus green eye-shade, evoked some comment. She published her last book, 'The History of the Indians in Natal', in 1957. She was awarded a DPhil ('honoris causa') by the University of South Africa in 1947 and was made an honorary member of the Fabian Society in 1958. She died at her home, 24 Clair Avenue, Manor Gardens, Durban on 16 November 1958 and was buried in Stellawood cemetery, Durban.

Somerville, Euphemia Gilchrist (1860-1935), social worker and local politician, was born on 19 September 1860 in New Town, Dollar, Clackmannanshire, the daughter of William Gibb, a draper, and his wife, Margaret Scott McMinn. She was educated at Dollar Academy, where she won a number of prizes. On 28 June 1893 she married Alexander Somerville (1841/2-1907), a retired East India merchant, the son of Alexander Neil Somerville, a Free Church minister. They had two sons and a daughter. Her husband, a widower with three daughters, had taken up the study of botany after his retirement from business. After his death in 1907 Euphemia Somerville and her children moved to Edinburgh and from 1911 lived in Colinton. The introduction to 'A Child Lover' (1937), an appreciation published after her death, stated that her experience of child poverty in Glasgow was the motivation for all her work. Her first public role was in Glasgow where, in response to high rates of infant mortality, she organized voluntary health visitors on behalf of the city council. She was asked to develop a similar scheme in Edinburgh in 1908, and with Mrs Hamilton Maxwell started the Edinburgh Voluntary Health Workers' Association, under the auspices of the council child welfare scheme. 
Euphemia Somerville was elected to the town council for the Merchiston ward in 1919 as an independent, actively supported by the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association (EWCA). The EWCA was set up in 1918, after women were partially enfranchised, to educate and organize the new women voters. It was ambitious, with interests encompassing women's political representation at local and national level, equal pay, and social welfare, especially for women as mothers and for children, but also mental handicap, social housing, and public health. When she was first elected she went to live for a month in the Craiglockhart poorhouse 'in order that she might obtain first-hand information on this side of Social Service' ('A Child Lover', 11), and then took a diploma at the new school of social study and training at the University of Edinburgh, a course that was aimed at both professional and voluntary social workers and taken by many women active in social reform. On the council, she was a member at various times of the education, public health, housing, and town planning and public parks committees. A colleague said that she was seen as 'a party of one -- viz. herself' (ibid., 41), and that this limited her influence and preferment. Mrs Hamilton Maxwell saw her, however, as 'unconfused by political interest or side issues' (ibid., 14). As well as being the second woman councillor in the city, holding her seat until her death, she also became in 1932 the city's second woman bailie, or magistrate, after several attempts. When she took this position, the 'woman of the streets was the subject of Mrs Somerville's special personal attention' (ibid., 44). 
Somerville chaired the executive committee of the EWCA from 1922 to 1930. Her multiple roles illustrate a mutually reinforcing relationship between women in local politics and women's organizations. By 1926 she was pushing for more council housing within the corporation and had set up the EWCA subcommittee on housing, through which she launched the Edinburgh Welfare Housing Trust in 1928 to build 'good houses for the very poor' ('A Child Lover', 55) as a model of what councils could do. By 1934 the trust had built on four city sites. Accounts of that work hint that her determination over housing, particularly slum clearance, bordered on the obsessive. After her death it was said that 'the vast new housing schemes that now detract from the landscape around Edinburgh' were her reward ('The Scotsman', 1 Dec 1937) -- an ambiguous legacy but one that indicated a response to housing conditions of the time. In the introduction to a survey of the St Andrews ward in Edinburgh (just behind the smart shops in Princes Street), commissioned by the EWCA in 1931 and undertaken by two women chartered surveyors, Somerville wrote that they wanted 'to bring out in strong relief the environment of the child in overcrowded insanitary areas' (E. E. Perry and I. T. Barclay, 'Behind Princes Street', 1931, 5). Such concerns were also acted on by the Edinburgh corporation public health committee. After May 1930 the committee's responsibilities included administration of the municipal hospitals and all services for mental health and handicap. As the first convener of the new mental diseases subcommittee (1930-32), which administered two major institutions, Bangour Mental Hospital and Gogarburn, and their auxiliary services, Somerville championed progressive approaches to the care and treatment of the mentally ill and handicapped. 
Somerville was best known in Edinburgh for the toddlers' playgrounds of which, at her death, there were nineteen. They grew out of her work in health visiting, as toddlers were often neglected when a new baby came and also had high rates of mortality. The playgrounds offered supervision, 'exercise, fresh air, and happy occupation' ('A Child Lover', 18). Edinburgh was a pioneer in pre-school provision, having established in 1903 the first free kindergarten in Scotland, at Reid's Court, Canongate, and by 1913 it had five voluntarily funded child gardens, as they were called, there being only fourteen in the rest of Britain. However, with an estimated 4000 children under five living in crowded rooms in densely populated districts, cheaper provision was needed through the playgrounds and after-school play centres. From 1930 Somerville convened a special committee on the care and education of children up to five. She commissioned a survey of children's health in the poorer areas, information that was used to argue for council nursery schools, the first of which was built in 1930 and is still open. 
Somerville was similarly assiduous in the cause of equal pay and promotion for women employees of the council, on which the EWCA lobbied. In 1928 she was described as steadily and persistently pursuing equal increments for corporation clerical employees. She also argued for women and men to be represented on all boards and charitable bodies, and for council advisory committees in key areas with equal numbers of men and women members. 
The boundary between voluntary work, voluntary associations, and the local state was permeable at this time and one which many 'organized women' (as the EWCA called itself) crossed. In Edinburgh Somerville was the pre-eminent example of this activity, as she brought into local government her own early experience of voluntary health visiting. The influence of women and women's organizations on welfare policy was arguably at a height during the inter-war period, when poor relief, voluntary hospitals, public health, and children's health and welfare (through educational provision) were all locally administered. Somerville espoused campaigns for aged persons, rent rebates according to the number of children in a family, social centres in the new housing areas, and the appointment of women police officers. She was also a director of the Royal Maternity and Simpson Memorial Hospital, where she was seen as possessing expertise in maternal mortality, birthrate fluctuations, and venereal disease; she was a link between the hospital and the council's public health department. Although babies and small children were undoubtedly a priority in her work, to emphasize her role as a 'child lover' is to underplay her organizational and leadership skills and the expertise she developed in several areas of health and welfare. She was a 'practical visionary' ('A Child Lover', 15), with immense vitality, a notable thoroughness, and, according to Mrs Hamilton Maxwell, 'a genius for accuracy'. What she called practical Christianity was a central motivation, and in 'Citizenship' (n.d.), a pamphlet she wrote for the EWCA, she emphasized the importance of collectivity and citizenship as 'the gospel and practice of inter-relationships'. 
Euphemia Somerville died at her home, 27 Colinton Road, Edinburgh, on 27 September 1935. The herbarium of British plants she and her husband had collected was presented to the University of Edinburgh.

Macdonald, Agnes Syme (1882-1966), suffragette and campaigner for women's citizenship, was born on 8 September 1882 at 23 Dublin Street, Edinburgh, the fifth child and only daughter of the six children of Alexander Macdonald and his wife, Euphemia Henderson. Alexander Macdonald, from Kiltarlity, Inverness, was a wine and spirit merchant in Edinburgh; Euphemia, who was born in Kinross, took over the business in 1893. 
Agnes 'was one of the many daughters of the house who stayed at home' and she later said that was why she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). 'Possibly it's because I was a so-called 'lady of leisure'... At that time there were too many women running around with no training to do anything' ('Evening Dispatch', 12 Dec 1962). In the autumn of 1911 the truce in suffragette militancy ended when the government announced that no further time would be given to the 'Conciliation Bill', which would have introduced a measure of women's suffrage. The most dramatic protests so far took place in early March 1912, with window-smashing raids on the West End and Whitehall. A number of Scottish women travelled to London to take part. Using 'a hammer, which we wore round the neck on a rope and a bit of string' (ibid.), Agnes broke a police office window. She was charged with malicious damage on 5 March 1912 and, in common with others who had attacked government property, was given two months' hard labour. That period in Holloway was formative. 'We learned a lot about social conditions, particularly from the women who cleaned out our cells. It was a tremendous experience, and later it helped me after I trained to become a secretary, and took up social work' (ibid.). That social work was primarily women's movement organization and campaigning on social and equality issues. 
Agnes was secretary of the Edinburgh branch of the WSPU for a short time in 1913, but became alienated by what she saw as extreme militant activity. In 1918, with other women from both militant and constitutional suffrage campaigns, she set up the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association (WCA); she was its first and longest-serving secretary. Women's citizens' associations were formed throughout Britain at this time to organize and educate women voters into a political force and to promote women's representation. The Edinburgh association was inaugurated in Edinburgh city chambers on 9 May 1918 when 'The Lord Provost presided, and the hall was filled to overflowing with women, who showed keen interest and great enthusiasm in the new movement' (minutes, Edinburgh WCA, 1918-19). In 1919 fifteen Scottish women's citizens' associations formed the Scottish Council of Women Citizens' Associations; they remained independent of the London-based National Women Citizens' Association. 
Agnes remembered the inter-war Edinburgh WCA as busy and effective. 'There was such efficiency and drive! Deputations to Government Departments and town councils! Meetings all over the country, constant efforts to get things done. And we did get things done' ('The Scotsman', 31 March 1962). Organized citizenship was seen as the next stage for the women's movement; as well as continuing to campaign for the franchise on equal terms to men, they believed women's status as citizens would lead to feminist and social reforms. Their programme was ambitious, encompassing efforts to get more women elected to central and local government (the latter successfully) and campaigning for equal pay and promotion for women teachers and council employees, against marriage bans in employment, for pre-school nursery and play facilities, and on mental illness and handicap, public health, and social housing. With other women's organizations in 1920 they launched a campaign on 'child outrage' (child sexual abuse), and from 1925 began to lobby for a national maternity service. 
In July 1939 Agnes retired as secretary of the Edinburgh WCA; at that time she was caring for her younger, disabled brother, Roddy, with whom she shared a house in Strathfillan Road, Edinburgh. She had joined the Society of Friends and her organizational skills found outlet in Quaker relief work for European refugees and as a member of the management committee of Barns School in the Scottish borders. Set up in 1940 for delinquent city boys, it was run on progressive principles and was highly controversial. Agnes is well remembered by Edinburgh Friends for her strong, left-leaning beliefs and sense of injustice, her efficiency, energy, and enthusiasm, and sharp wit. Quakers who were children then remember her as 'the pan drop lady' who brought peppermints to meeting for them. She was also active on the Edinburgh Old People's Welfare Council. 
Agnes Macdonald died, unmarried, on 21 October 1966, aged eighty-four, after a period in a nursing home, at St Raphael's Home, Blackford Avenue, Edinburgh.

Skene, Lilias (1626/7-1697), Quaker preacher and poet, was the daughter of John Gillespie (died 1627 or 'c'.1647), minister of Kirkcaldy; according to conflicting accounts, her father died either around the time of her birth or shortly after her marriage. Her mother was Lilias Simson (died 1627), the daughter of Patrick Simson, minister of Stirling. One of at least eight children, her brothers included the Church of Scotland ministers Patrick Gillespie, principal of Glasgow University, and George Gillespie, minister of St Giles, Edinburgh. 
Lilias Gillespie married at Kirkcaldy on 26 August 1646 an Aberdeen merchant, Alexander Skene (1621?-1694), magistrate and author of 'Memorialls for the Government of the Royall-Burghs in Scotland'. She moved with him to Aberdeen, and between 1647 and 1669 bore ten children. Her eldest surviving son was John Skene ('c'.1649-1690), deputy governor of West Jersey (1685-8) ('Papers of William Penn', 96n., 105n.). She and her husband were fervent covenanters, respected for the strength of their faith even when their strict presbyterianism became impolitic at the Restoration. It caused a local sensation when, about the time when her last child was born in 1669, she suddenly converted to Quakerism. Her husband followed suit in 1672. Of her own conversion she wrote: 'It is very well known to all that lived in the place where I sojourned, I was none who conversed with them, I was never at one of their meetings, I never read one of their books', yet she experienced 'that thing the school-men call Immediat Objective Revelation' (Skein, 203). She continued to be known locally as Lilias Gillespie, but within Quaker circles she was called, English-style, by her husband's surname. 
Lilias Skene was the leading woman in Aberdeen's tiny but influential Quaker community, which included such figures as Robert Barclay, George Keith, and Alexander Jaffray of Kingswells. Quaker meetings were often held in the Skenes' house. She appears to have been the only woman to join the men in adjudicating disciplinary matters. About 1678 she helped establish the first Quaker school in Scotland. Lilias Skene's leadership and activism came to the fore between 1676 and 1679, years of persecution in Aberdeen when every adult male Quaker in the region (about thirty in all) spent months or years in prison -- including her husband, eldest son, and son-in-law Andrew Jaffray ['see under 'Jaffray, Alexander] of Kingswells, who had married her daughter Christian. Quaker women remained at liberty and continued to meet and lobby for the men's freedom. Lilias Skene was very active through this period. In a ferocious letter of 31 March 1677 to the Aberdeen magistrates, she refers to her own preaching ('at severall seasons and in diverse maners I have witnessed') and goes on to condemn their imprisoning 'honest men that have families wives and children... in those cold nasty stinking holes where ye have shutt them up, who have been as neatly handled and tenderly educated and as usefull in their generation as any amongst you' ('Brieff account of the most material passages', 37-9). It has been plausibly claimed, but cannot be confirmed, that she assisted her husband in compiling the two manuscript accounts of the history of Quakerism in Aberdeen which he produced in the early 1680s. 
Lilias Skene also turned her pen to epistolary evangelizing. In 1676 Robert Barclay encouraged her to write to Elisabeth, princess palatine of the Rhine (1618-1680), cousin of the Stuart kings, who Quakers hoped would intervene on their behalf even if (as happened) she could not be converted. Barclay introduced Skene to her as 'a woman of great experience and tenderness of heart who through great tribulations both of body and mind hath attained the earnest of the Kingdom [but whose] husband and son-in-law are now in Prison' (Hull, 27). Skene corresponded with the princess and her companion, Countess Anna Maria van Hoorn (or de Hornes), and was invited to visit them at Herford, Westphalia. George Keith's biographer claims she accompanied Keith, Barclay, George Fox, and William Penn on their tour of the Netherlands and Germany in the summer of 1677, and Barclay tells us she intended to go. But neither Penn nor Fox mentions her in their journals of the trip, and in a letter written to her in 1678 the princess seemed to imply that they had not met: 'I love your upright intention to travail (i.e. toil) in spirit for your friends, though unknown to you' (ibid., 33). Skene was in London in the summer of 1677, and also visited the bedridden philosopher and recent Quaker convert Anne, Viscountess Conway, at Ragley in Worcestershire. She befriended and corresponded with Anne Conway, and was entrusted with hiring new household staff for Ragley, all Quakers -- a task she could arrange from Aberdeen, thanks to her extensive contacts in the English Quaker community. 
Lilias Skene's letters and poems are among the few surviving literary works of non-aristocratic seventeenth-century Scottish women. Her only known publication in her lifetime (the author spelling her name Lillias Skein) was 'An Expostulatory Epistle, Directed to Robert Macquare', dated June 1678 and appended to one of Robert Barclay's polemics in 1679. Macquare (better known as Robert McWard) was a presbyterian dissenter whose vitriolic rants against Quakers had earlier drawn Alexander Skene into print. Lilias Skene's effort was gracious and restrained, but firm: 'O Robert! thy hard speeches have manifested thy own sad acknowledgement to be very true, the Holy fire is gone out with thee indeed' (Skein, 201). In the nineteenth century William Walker published (from his own transcription of a manuscript since lost) selections from thirty lyric poems and three anagrams composed between 1665 and 1697 (Walker, 85-102). Lilias Skene's poetry, like her prose, was filled with mystical allusions and scriptural images of suffering and salvation. The Aberdeenshire poll-tax book of 1696 finds her widowed and living modestly in Aberdeen with her daughter Anna and two servants. She died there on 21 June 1697, three years after her husband, and was buried beside him in an unmarked grave in the Quaker burial-ground at Kingswells.

Skene, Alexander, of Newtyle (1621?-1694), local politician and author, was born or baptized in Aberdeen on 27 October 1621, the eldest son and second of five children born to Marjorie Forbes (died 1650) and Robert Skene (died 1643). His father was elected treasurer of the town council, a post reserved for the wealthy, in 1629 and 1633. Robert Skene also served on the town council of 1638-9, a body dominated by covenanters, of which he was almost certainly one. In accordance with the family's wealth and status, Alexander Skene joined the Aberdeen merchant guild before the age of four in 1625. He enrolled at Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1637. Since his father is known to have taken the sons of other prominent Aberdeen merchants with him on expeditions to the cloth-producing regions of Yorkshire and to London, it is likely that Alexander received similar instruction. 
Few details concerning Alexander Skene's business affairs survive, but his career in public office and his writings attest to his involvement in commercial matters. His actions and whereabouts through the civil wars of the 1640s are unknown, but he was married at Kirkcaldy to Lilias Gillespie ['see 'Skene, Lilias (1626/-1697)], daughter of John Gillespie, the minister there, on 26 August 1646. They had ten children. Their eldest surviving son, John Skene ('c'.1649-1690), was active in Quaker circles in Aberdeen, emigrated to America in 1682 after his business failed, and was deputy governor of West Jersey (1685-8). 
Alexander Skene was first elected to the town council in 1648 (as treasurer, an unusually senior first appointment) in an election from which royalists and moderate covenanters were excluded. He was dean of guild in 1650. In 1651 the Aberdeen kirk session, also dominated by hard-line covenanters, elected him ruling elder. At the fractious general assembly of July 1651 he and Aberdeen's other lay and clerical representatives sided with the radical protester minority. After Aberdeen surrendered to the English army in September 1651 the local covenanting elite splintered when Provost Alexander Jaffray of Kingswells and two of the town's three ministers formed a short-lived Independent congregation (Scotland's only such) on the English model. Skene was close to all those involved, but any defection on his part must have been fleeting, as he remained an elder of the kirk. In 1656 he was elected a magistrate (baillie) of the town. His energy and organizational skills were instrumental in the successful introduction of the justice of the peace court, Aberdeen's only major institutional innovation of the seventeenth century. 
Skene's connections to the radical cause in church and state worked against him when moderates returned to public life after 1657. He purchased the estate of Newtyle (near Foveran, about 12 miles north of Aberdeen) that year, and was usually referred to thereafter as 'Newtyle'. Though not yet forty he virtually retired from public life. In March 1670 he paid to rebuild Aberdeen's medicinal Well of Spa for the public good, and republished Dr William Barclay's 1615 treatise on the well, to which he appended (under the pseudonym Philopolis) some celebratory verse and an 'Epistle Dedicatory' addressed to the town council. This public-spiritedness may have expedited his political comeback (and counteracted the effects of his wife's avowal of Quakerism the year before), because six months later he was again elected baillie and elder. His term ended in September 1671 and with it his career in public office, because shortly after he converted to Quakerism himself -- not long, he tells us, after suffering painful spasms upon saying of a prominent Quaker, 'It wer well to tak that Villain Georg Keith and hang him up at the [Market] Cross of Aberdeen' ('Brieff historicall account', 31). 
In 1672 Alexander Skene joined a tiny Quaker community around Aberdeen that already included such luminaries as Alexander Jaffray of Kingswells (whose son Andrew Jaffray ['see under 'Jaffray, Alexander] Skene's daughter Christian married), George Keith, and Robert Barclay of Urie. Despite the outburst against Keith, Barclay described the converted Skene as 'a Man very modest, and very averse from giving offence to others' (R. Barclay, 401). Quaker meetings were held in the Skenes' townhouse on the Guestrow. When Quakers were persecuted in Aberdeen between 1676 and 1679 Skene, like every adult male Quaker in the region, spent long stretches in the Tolbooth prison. In 1676 the Scottish privy council assessed fines totalling half his valued rents; when he refused to pay his livestock were seized and auctioned at the Aberdeen market, though the citizenry registered its distaste for this action by refusing to bid. Nevertheless, financial pressures stemming from the years of persecution may account for the sale of Newtyle in 1680. 
As soon as he joined the Aberdeen Quakers, Skene set about compiling their history. He was chiefly responsible for two lengthy and wonderfully detailed manuscripts on the subject completed in the early 1680s ('A brieff historicall account' and 'A brieff account of the most material passages'). He is also said to have compiled a manuscript of the coats of arms of all the principal Scottish families. Alexander Skene published on behalf of Quakers on four occasions, beginning in 1675 and 1676 with two accounts, co-authored with his son John Skene and three others, of a celebrated public debate in Aberdeen in April 1675 (moderated on the Quaker side by Alexander Skene) between Barclay and Keith on the one hand, and four over-matched Marischal College divinity students on the other. These were followed by his preface to George Keith's 'The Way Cast Up', dated February 1677 'from the Tolbooth of Aberdeen, where I am prisoner', in which he offers a comparatively measured response to Robert McWard's anti-Quaker tirade appended to the third edition of the letters of Samuel Rutherford. In 1681 he published a solo tract, 'A Plain and Peaceable Advice to those called Presbyterians in Scotland'. 
Alexander Skene's most important publications dealt not with Quakers but with civic government and urban history. In 1685 he published a remarkable handbook for prospective civic magistrates, 'Memorialls for the Government of the Royall-Burghs in Scotland', under the pseudonym 'Philopoliteius, or a lover of the Publick welfare'. It was dedicated to the Edinburgh town council and bound with a shorter work, 'A Succinct Survey of the Famous City of Aberdeen', dedicated to the Aberdeen council. Attribution is confirmed by an Aberdeen council minute of 18 November 1685 referring to 'the little book latlie emitted be Mr. Alexr Skene late baillie, dedicated to the Magrats and Counsell... to get tuentie thereof for the touns use' (Aberdeen town council register, vol. 57). The 'Succinct Survey' is derivative of James Gordon's 'A Description of both Touns of Aberdeen', dating from the mid-seventeenth century, but is none the less a vital source for local historians. The 'Memorialls' is a much more original work. It offers a systematic description of the workings of Scottish burghs from the unique perspective of a magistrate of deep experience and frustrated ambitions; it is open to question whether the book would have been written had Skene been able to continue his career in public office. Though laced with classical and biblical citations that establish the author's learning and piety, it is at heart a straightforwardly practical work that sets forth key legislation pertaining to Scottish burghs, explains the duties of each class of civic office-holder, and offers a wide range of advice on such matters as the planting of orchards in towns; the establishment of public libraries stocked with works on government, law, navigation, and commerce; the furthering of trade; the avoidance of faction; and the instilling of youth with virtue and civic-mindedness. 
Alexander Skene died in Aberdeen in January 1694 and was buried, as was his wife three years later, in an unmarked grave in the Quaker burial-ground at Kingswells.

Wolseley ring (act. 1873-1890), military reformers, was a group of British army officers in the late nineteenth century who owed their high ranks to Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley (1833-1913). The ring developed owing to several factors: patronage was a way of Victorian life; promotion in the army was governed by seniority and not by selection; the Staff College did not turn out a sufficient number of staff officers; and Wolseley personally believed that he could select the best men. 
The quality of senior officers during the Crimean War had not impressed Wolseley, and he began to keep 'a list of the best and ablest soldiers I knew' (Wolseley, 'Story of a Soldier's Life', 201). Wolseley's first experience of command was the 1870 Red River campaign. Then his choice of staff officers was limited to those already serving in Canada. John McNeill, William Francis Butler, Redvers Henry Buller, and Hugh McCalmont all impressed him with their military knowledge and capacity for hard work and were earmarked for future use. 
In 1873 Wolseley selected his staff for the Asante campaign, and it is the Second Anglo-Asante War that marks the real origin of the Wolseley ring. Apart from the officers listed above, he chose Henry Brackenbury, John Frederick Maurice, George Pomeroy Pomeroy-Colley, Baker Creed Russell, and Henry Evelyn Wood to accompany him. Qualifications for membership of the ring included loyalty to the chief, intellect, bravery, and experience of war. Few new members joined the elite after this campaign: Herbert Stewart was a notable exception. 
Men from the ring accompanied Wolseley on the various tasks the government set him. These included civil appointments, such as in Natal in 1875 and in Cyprus in 1878. Foremost, though, was their staff work when on campaign. In 1879 Wolseley was appointed to replace Lord Chelmsford after the early disasters of the Anglo-Zulu War. He was joined in South Africa by Brackenbury, McCalmont, Russell, Maurice, and Colley. In Egypt in 1882 Wolseley accepted the services of lieutenant-generals Frederick Willis and Edward Bruce Hamley as divisional commanders, but managed to find places on the staff for most of his ring. 
The cohesion of the ring lasted until the expedition of 1884-5 to relieve Gordon in Khartoum, Wolseley's last experience of active-service command. He complained in a letter to his wife on 31 December 1884, 'they torture themselves with jealousy one of the other, and sometimes even in their dealings with me are inclined to kick over the traces'. Buller failed to ensure an adequate supply of coal to keep the steamers running. Butler proved incapable of working in a team, and Wood was so deaf that working with him was a strain on Wolseley's voice. Only Herbert Stewart earned praise, but he died from wounds in the campaign. 
Wolseley's patronage extended to securing important appointments for his proteges while he himself served at the War Office. He collaborated with Wood to improve the training of the army. Maurice's intellect was encouraged and he became the 'pen of Wolseley' (Luvaas, 173-215). Yet loyalty to Wolseley did not always last. Wood was never totally forgiven for signing a peace treaty with the Boers in 1881 before the British defeat at Majuba and the death of Colley had been avenged. Brackenbury angered him by adopting the Indian viewpoint of the defence of India while serving there, in direct contradiction of his patron's opinions. He later served as director of ordnance when Wolseley was commander-in-chief. Buller equally was never totally forgiven for nearly being appointed commander-in-chief in 1895 instead of his patron, yet Wolseley did secure his appointment as commander of the First Army corps in the South African War. 
The ring has been criticized because allegedly it did not bring the best men forward, its size was too limited, and it divided the late Victorian army. The argument that Wolseley's men were not as able as he supposed rests on the performances of Colley, Butler, and Buller in the graveyard of military reputations, South Africa. Colley disappointed his chief in the Anglo-Transvaal War by attempting to take Majuba Hill with too few men and paid for his error with his life. Butler angered Wolseley by refusing to suggest provisions for the defence of Natal and Cape Colony when war with the Boers was imminent. Buller's poor strategic decisions during the war appalled Wolseley. 
The commander-in-chief, the duke of Cambridge, had his own circle of officers whose careers he encouraged, yet he disputed Wolseley's right to select his own staff. He argued that 'no army could stand these sorts of preferences without entirely dampening the energies of senior officers', but Wolseley was unrepentant (Verner, 164). The duke objected to the list of staff officers selected for the autumn campaign in 1885 to retake Khartoum because he felt that more men should be given experience of staff work. Wolseley replied that many new men had been tried already and found wanting. He listed them with caustic comments: one colonel was 'not fit to be a corporal' (Wolseley to Cambridge, 4 April 1885, Cambridge MSS, Royal Archives, M858/47). Nor had the Marlborough House set surrounding the prince of Wales fared any better: Stanley Clarke was not recommended for a medal or promotion. 
The argument that the Wolseley ring was a divisive factor in the Victorian army rests on its perceived competition with the Roberts ring based in India. This was more of a rivalry between the junior members of the rings, particularly Ian Hamilton, who upheld Roberts's reputation at every opportunity. There is little evidence of enmity between Wolseley and Roberts themselves other than their differences of opinion on the value of short service and their opposing ideas on Indian defence. The Wolseley ring and Roberts ring were just two among other circles formed around powerful men like the duke of Cambridge and the prince of Wales. 
The Wolseley ring owed its existence and validity to the failure of the Staff College to supply an adequate number of staff officers and to the system of promotion by seniority. As the Staff College's reputation improved, Wolseley encouraged young proteges such as J. Adye and E. S. E. Childers to apply in order to gain the necessary theoretical knowledge of staff work. Similarly the establishment of a promotion board and the acceptance of selection as the method for future promotions at the end of the century meant that rings like Wolseley's should no longer have been necessary in the army. The effectiveness of the Wolseley ring is demonstrated by the fact that it ensured Wolseley's reputation as the foremost colonial commander in the late Victorian army.

Ross, John (1728/9-1807), printer, was born probably in Scotland; nothing further is known of his early life. In 1762, after working for seven years as an overseer in a London printing house, he joined Rhys Thomas in the latter's two-year-old printing business in Carmarthen. Their imprints of 1763 refer to a 'new printing-house' in Lammas Street (Heol Awst). On 17 April 1764 Ross married Jane Edwards in St Peter's Church, Carmarthen; a son, Daniel, was baptized on 6 January 1765 and buried on 13 February of the same year. By March 1768 Ross was a member of Heol Awst Welsh Independent Chapel, of which he was subsequently a trustee; 'Mr Ross's father' also subscribed to chapel funds between 1769 and 1772. 
Rhys Thomas moved to Llandovery in 1764, leaving Ross to quietly revolutionize the Welsh book trade as the first printer in the area to serve an appropriate apprenticeship. He announced that he had procured from London a printing press and new types, including, it transpired, a Hebrew font. Initially he employed Evan Thomas to oversee the Welsh publications but in due course Ross learned the language himself. The quality of his presswork and his business acumen set standards which signalled the death knell of the non-professional printer in Wales. In 1772 he moved from Lammas Street to Priory Street, but in 1781 he returned to Lammas Street, to a site now commemorated with a plaque. Ross printed about 400 books in English, Welsh, and Hebrew on an infinite variety of subjects, designed to edify, inform, or merely entertain; they ranged from broadside ballads to folio bibles. He rarely published himself and, when he did so, it tended to be by subscription. Usually the onus of publication lay on the author, with Ross's efficient book distribution network within Wales and extending to English towns, notably London and Shrewsbury, facilitating the process. 
The size of Ross's editions was impressive; an unprecedented 8600 copies were issued of the first edition of his most famous publication, the 1770 Welsh 'Bible', with a commentary by Peter Williams. He was the printer of two early Welsh periodicals, the fortnightly 'Trysorfa Gwybodaeth' (1770) and the quarterly 'Miscellaneous Repository' (1795-6). Jobbing printing was lucrative; the professional classes, tradesmen, and gentry in the prosperous town of Carmarthen and in the neighbouring counties were avid clients. Cardiganshire quarter sessions records for 1786 reveal that Ross would also provide a Welsh translation service. His shop was well stocked with new and secondhand books, binding materials, stationery, and patent medicines. By 1787 he had a circulating library. A highly respected figure in Carmarthen, Ross was one of the two sheriffs of the borough in 1785. 
Ross died in October 1807, aged seventy-eight. The business was taken over by Ann Scott, who had married Walter Scott, a market gardener, in 1776. She is described in her obituary as John Ross's daughter but she is more likely to have been his sister, since she was 107 when she died in September 1842 and, according to the 1841 census, she was born outside the county. In March 1808 she disposed of 'the entire stock of a large Printing Office'.

MacDonald, Angus, of Dunyvaig and the Glens (c.1548-1613), chief of clan Iain Mhor or clan Donald south, was born probably in Dunyvaig Castle, in Islay, the family seat. He was the second of six legitimate sons of James MacDonald, sixth chief ('c'.1515-1565), and his wife, Lady Agnes Campbell (d. in or after 1590), daughter of the third earl of Argyll, who was allegedly abducted into this, her second marriage, in 1545. After her husband's death Lady Agnes was married for a third time, in 1569, to Turlough Luineach O'Neill of Tir Eoghain, or Tyrone, a political union which greatly facilitated the lucrative hire of her son's mercenaries by the native Irish. Angus succeeded to the chiefship, as eighth chief, after the death of his elder brother, Archibald MacDonald, in 1568. He is likely to have received a traditional Gaelic education, befitting the son of a chief, from members of hereditary learned families who taught literacy in common classical Gaelic, bardic verse, seanchus or history, harping and bagpiping, and the exercise of military prowess, such as sword fighting and use of the cudgel. He was born into the Catholic faith, though it was illegal to practise it in Scotland throughout his chiefship. With his wife, Fynvola MacLean of Duart, he had at least two legitimate sons, James and Angus Og MacDonald, and a daughter, Margaret; he also had two natural sons, Gillespie or Archibald MacDonald of Gigha and Ranald Og MacAllester. In 1597, according to the state papers for Ireland, he also accepted the eldest son of Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, under the Gaelic system of fosterage. 
The clan Donald south, a fragment of the old lordship of the Isles, was one of the most powerful on the western seaboard of Scotland in the late sixteenth century, with extensive lands in Kintyre, Islay, and Jura, and the Glens of Antrim. Angus MacDonald was not an impressive figure. Sir Arthur Chichester said of him in 1602 that he was 'a perpetual drunkard... [and] his men of base and treacherous disposition, inclined to dissolute and licentious living' ('CSP Ire.', '1601-3', 335). But he had the additional misfortune to be chief when a lethal combination of external forces and internal dissension had begun to prey upon the stability of the clan. The main external threat came from his mother's family, the house of Argyll. The Campbells, who had long coveted the clan's territory in Kintyre, were often employed by the lowland government in the 1580s and 1590s, as it became increasingly determined to bring the clans under control. In addition, the English government was constantly trying to limit the involvement of Angus's mercenaries in Ireland, and in this it increasingly had the support of James VI, looking ahead to the day when, as king of England and Ireland, he inherited all the problems associated with Anglo-Irish condominium. There was also almost continuous conflict between the clan and Angus's wife's family, the MacLeans of Duart, over the title to the Rhinns of Islay, a dispute which eventually gave the government an additional excuse for intervention. 
The MacDonald-MacLean feud, begun under James MacDonald, continued under his son, and reached a peak of violence in May 1586, when the massacre of MacLean prisoners by Angus's men led to the enactment of the statute known as 'murder under trust'. Eventually, in 1590, Angus was summoned with Lachlan MacLean and Donald Gorm MacDonald of Sleat under a safe conduct to Edinburgh, to discuss the governance of their territories. They were imprisoned instead, to be released a year later on surety of 10,000 merks each, and equal amounts in annual rent. Angus's heir, James ['see below'], was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle as surety for his father, and remained there almost continually over the next five years, with only brief periods of liberation to try and persuade his father to agree to terms. Angus was also compelled to find surety for his clansmen's good behaviour in Ireland. By 1594, however, both he and Lachlan MacLean had been placed under sentence of forfeiture for refusal to submit to the king. MacLean submitted in June 1596 and agreed to augment his rents, but Angus held out. In the same month, according to intelligence from Knockfergus, Angus sought the help of O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, whereupon the exasperated king gave MacLean a lease of the Rhinns of Islay, and commissioned Sir William Stewart of Houston to lead an expedition against the clan Donald south, with orders to take its main castles. Angus still refused to submit, but his affairs were made still more complicated by a dispute with his kinsmen in northern Ireland. The two branches of clan Donald south had co-operated under the leadership of Sorley Boy (Somhairle Buidhe) MacDonnell, but after the latter's death in 1590 his son James MacSorley quarrelled with Angus, principally over the Glens of Antrim, held by Angus of the English crown and administered by his son Angus Og. In 1596 James took forcible possession of the glens, and in the following year submitted a claim to Kintyre and Islay as well, declaring that Angus was illegitimate; the allegation was a useful weapon against Angus for James VI. With Argyll controlling the movement of fighting men between Scotland and Ireland, Angus could hope for no support from O'Neill. 
Beset on every side, and with no effective allies, in November 1596 Angus MacDonald submitted to King James. The settlement imposed by the king was potentially ruinous, since it required Angus to withdraw from Kintyre and Gigha. His agent in these negotiations was his son 
The MacLeans took the opportunity of this internecine strife to drive the MacDonalds out of Islay, and make good their lease from the crown. Battle ensued on 5 August 1598 at Loch Gruinart, where MacLean was killed. Sir James went to Edinburgh, offering to carry out the promises which his father had made in 1597 to evacuate Kintyre, to surrender Dunyvaig Castle, and to pay crown rents, and offered to pay his father a pension of 1000 merks per annum, for which he wished to be confirmed in the title to Islay. But thanks to the intervention of John Campbell of Cawdor and the seventh earl of Argyll, Sir James was not granted the feu. When Angus escaped from imprisonment in 1600, father and son vied for the leadership. Angus succeeded in capturing his son in 1603, and handed him over to Argyll, who nevertheless worked against Angus in the privy council to gain a feu of the crown lands in Kintyre and Jura, which had been forfeited by him. 
By 1605 Angus had effectively lost control of Kintyre and Jura, which were formally granted to Argyll in 1607. He held on to Colonsay and Islay, however, and like other chiefs consequently remained subject to pressure from the crown. A show of force in 1608, during which Dunyvaig Castle was occupied, was followed in 1609 by a commission led by Bishop Andrew Knox, which held a justiciary court to which the island chiefs were summoned, including Angus. The statutes of Iona which Knox then promulgated continued the process of reducing chiefly power; Angus MacDonald, brought to submission by the previous year's expedition, also agreed to pay $3000 arrears of rent. By this time he was probably worn down by his efforts to preserve his heritage. The last significant transaction of his life was effectively an acknowledgement of failure. By a deed of 1 January 1612 he surrendered his patrimony in Islay to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor, in exchange for other lands and a payment of 6000 merks, thereby continuing the absorption of MacDonald territory by the Campbells. By the time Angus died, probably in Rothesay, between January and 17 March 1613, the clan Donald south had effectively disappeared as a territorial clan. 
Meanwhile Sir James MacDonald had been put on trial in May 1609 for 'treasonable' breaking of ward and also for imprisoning and trying to kill his father. The court was presided over by Argyll himself, and inevitably Sir James was convicted, but though he was condemned to death he was not executed, but was placed in custody once more. Then, following Angus's death, his illegitimate son Ranald Og seized Dunyvaig Castle in spring 1614, triggering off a rising in Islay. Although Sir James made an offer from prison to recapture the castle, and to pay 8000 merks for the crown lands of Islay, a feu charter was instead issued to Cawdor. In May 1615 Sir James escaped from Edinburgh Castle, and with the support of MacDonald of Sleat and MacDonald of Clanranald drove Cawdor's men from Islay. In a letter to the secretary of state he insisted that 'if his Majestie be not willing that I sall be his heignes tennent in Ila, for Goddis cause let his Majestie hauld it in his awin hand; for that is certane, I will die befoir I sie a Campbell posses it' (Pitcairn, 21). But when Argyll arrived as royal lieutenant to repress the rising, assisted by English ships, Sir James was obliged to escape to Galway, and then to Spain. Although he was pardoned in 1620, he was never permitted to return to Scotland, but lived in London until his death there in 1626.

MacDonald, Alexander, of Dunyvaig and the Glens (d. 1536x9), clan chief, was the eldest son of John Cannoch or Cattenach MacDonald (died 1499) of Dunyvaig and the Glens, and his wife, Cecilia Savage. His father, who was hanged with his father, Sir John MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens, and two of his brothers on James IV's orders in 1499, had been the heir to the chieftainship of the clan Iain Mhoir, also known as the clan Donald south, the senior and most powerful of the cadet lines of the clan Donald. The clan had important holdings on both sides of the North Channel, in Kintyre and Islay in western Scotland, and the Glens of Antrim in Ulster. Alexander took refuge in the latter after his father's death, while his inheritance in Islay was granted to Sir John MacIan of Ardnamurchan, who had captured John Cannoch and his sons in 1494. Alexander MacDonald is said to have defeated an expedition by MacIan into Ulster, but he remained there and established a formidable reputation as a leader of the Scottish mercenaries who flocked to Ireland from the Hebrides in the sixteenth century. He settled his feud with John MacIan and married the latter's daughter Caitirfhiona (or Katherine), with whom he had nine sons (including James MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens, and Sorley Boy MacDonnell) and two daughters. 
Following the battle of Flodden in 1513 Alexander MacDonald's forfeiture was remitted. His marriage had brought him into the orbit of the earls of Argyll, the crown's principal agents in filling the power vacuum left by the disappearance of the lordship of the Isles. On 7 March 1516 'Alexander Johne Caynachis sone' was described as one of the 'familiaris and servandis to Coline erle of Ergile' ('Registrum secreti sigilli', no. 2722). But his reconciliation with MacIan did not last long. By March 1517 Alexander was supporting the bid by Donald Gallda MacDonald of Lochalsh to gain the lordship of the Isles, and later that year they came upon MacIan at Craiganairgid in Morvern and defeated and killed him. Donald died without an heir in 1519, and Alexander became the leading MacDonald in the Isles. 
By now the central government was aware of the need to win Alexander MacDonald over. On 13 March 1517 the council recorded its awareness that the clan Iain Mhoir was in revolt 'because thai have na heritage' (Hannay, 80), and proposed that if Alexander agreed to submit and give hostages for good behaviour he should be given a renewed remission and a grant of lands. Following the death of Donald Gallda he made his peace and recovered his inheritance in Kintyre and Islay, on condition that his followers 'keep guid reule and mak na extorsioun on the Kingis liegis, gevand plegis sufficient' (Macdonald and Macdonald, 2.516). Alexander also had to settle with the Campbells, and in 1520 he entered into a bond of gossipry and manrent with Sir John Campbell of Cawdor, a younger brother of the third earl of Argyll, whereby Campbell leased to MacDonald lands in Islay and Jura and the island of Colonsay. Although relations between the two men soon became strained, there is evidence that the king's government accepted MacDonald as 'de facto' lord of the Isles at this time. 
The re-establishment of the clan Iain Mhoir threatened the position of Lachlan Cattanach Maclean, the pre-eminent islander since 1493, and Alexander MacDonald gained most from Lachlan's murder in 1523, but even more important to Alexander were his relations with the Campbells and with the king. In 1528 he went into rebellion once more. In that year James V assumed power, and Argyll was made his lieutenant in the west, where the king had ordered the annulment of recent infeftments of crown lands. The beneficiaries of these had included Alexander MacDonald, and their revocation must have been a principal cause of his revolt, reinforced by his suspicion of Argyll's ambitions. An expedition against the Isles in 1529 was cut short by the earl's death. Summoned before the king MacDonald did not appear, but as preparations were made for a royal expedition he came to James at Stirling in June 1531 and submitted, on terms which included handing over his son James as a hostage. He was rewarded with $100 and a purple velvet gown. Soon afterwards the fourth earl of Argyll accused him of 'divers and sindry greit faltis' (Cameron, 234), but MacDonald appeared before the council in November to answer them, and when Argyll did not attend presented his own complaints against the earl, who was subsequently dismissed as chamberlain of Kintyre. 
In 1532, in a westward extension of that year's Anglo-Scottish hostilities, MacDonald led 7000 men to Ulster, and spent most of the rest of his life there. In 1533 he and Hector Maclean of Duart attacked the Isle of Man and captured an English ship, the 'Mary Willoughby', which they handed over to King James. The king sent bows and arrows to MacDonald, who, however, was also active on his own behalf, to the extent that on 30 August 1535 he was outlawed for a piratical attack on a Glasgow merchant's ships off the Mull of Kintyre. No further action followed, perhaps because MacDonald died in 1536, as stated in the annals of Ulster, or because MacDonald was reconciled with the crown; he may have been the Alexander mentioned in a letter from Archbishop John Allen of Dublin as active in the service of James V in 1538. He was dead by 1539, when his son James was described as 'of Dunyvaig'.

MacDonald, Donald Dubh (d. 1545), rebel, was the son of Angus (Angus Og) MacDonald ['see under 'MacDonald family (per. c.1300-c.1500)] and a daughter (perhaps named Mary) of Colin Campbell, first earl of Argyll. Angus died about 1490, and so did not live to see the event which above all else shaped the life of his son, namely the forfeiture of the lordship of the Isles in 1493 by Donald's grandfather, John MacDonald, and the consequent eclipse of his family. Archibald Campbell, who became second earl in 1493, must have consented to his sister's imprisonment in Innis Chonnell Castle on Loch Awe and young Donald claimed to have been born in captivity. He escaped in 1501, and found shelter first with Torquil MacLeod of Lewis and then with Maclean of Duart, and was welcomed as the rightful heir to the lordship of the Isles. Lochaber was invaded and Badenoch plundered, while as part of the king's response a Scottish fleet was gathered in 1504, with Andrew Wood and Robert Barton taking part. One account says that Donald took refuge in the castle of Cairnburgh in the Treshnish Isles off Mull; recaptured in 1506, he was brought to the lowlands and lodged in Edinburgh Castle. After being held in ward for nearly forty years 'until his hair got grey', reports show that he was free by May 1543. That was the year when Matthew Stewart, earl of Lennox, returned to Scotland from abroad, and it was not long before Donald, with Lennox as intermediary, was in touch with Henry VIII and other enemies of the Scottish crown. 
In June 1545 Donald Dubh MacDonald (the epithet means 'black') was being blamed by the privy council for the harrying and slaying of the young queen's subjects both in the islands and on the mainland, assisted by the king of England, and he was threatened with dire penalties if he and his supporters did not cease from such treasonable and rebellious conduct. Donald acted with the advice and consent of his barons, who formed a revived council of the Isles on the model of that which had met during the heyday of the lordship; this included, besides the leading men of his own clan, the Maclean chief and cadets, MacLeods, MacNeills, Mackinnon, and MacQuarrie. Meeting near Islay in July and at Knockfergus in northern Ireland in the following month, this body, along with Donald himself, took oaths of allegiance to King Henry and agreed to operate under Lennox's command. They were to assist in the invasion and conquest of Scotland, where Donald would hold the lordship lands (once they had been reclaimed) of King Henry, from whom he was to have an annual pension of 2000 crowns for his services. 
Two commissioners were appointed to put these proposals to the king; calling himself earl of Ross and lord of the Isles of Scotland, Donald Dubh MacDonald wrote a personal letter of humble submission in Latin to King Henry; after communing with Lennox (now married to Henry's niece) and his council, Henry received the two island commissioners in September, and an agreement was drawn up taking into account the articles submitted through them. This was readily accepted, and as an assurance of good faith Henry's advisers were given examples of the persecution suffered by those in what were called 'the wyld Ilis of Scotland' which had made them always the enemies of the Scottish realm. Donald has been credited with aiming to revive a form of Celtic kingship for himself under the English flag; observers say that he had 180 galleys and 4000 men with him when he sailed across the narrow seas to Ireland, and another 4000 at home to keep Huntly and Argyll busy when they were active in the North and South Isles on behalf of the Scottish government. At Knockfergus, Donald was joined by Lennox, but after some delay a full-scale invasion of Scotland from the west was postponed. What proved to be the last substantial attempt to re-establish the lordship of the Isles ended late in 1545 with Donald's death of a fever at Drogheda, without any direct heir to succeed him, but leaving a 'base son' whom he bequeathed to the English king's service.

MacDonald, James, of Dunyvaig and the Glens (d. 1565), clan chief, was the eldest son of Alexander MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens (d. 1536x9) and his wife, Caitirfhiona (Katherine) MacIan of Ardnamurchan. In 1531 his father handed him over as a hostage to James V, who entrusted him to the keeping of William Henderson, a canon of Holyrood. James returned home following his father's death. In 1540 he met the king during the royal expedition to the Isles and gave his brother Coll as a hostage. When Donald Dubh MacDonald escaped from prison in 1543 and claimed the lordship of the Isles, allying himself with England and the earl of Lennox, James MacDonald was almost alone among the chiefs of the Isles in remaining loyal to the Scottish crown (though his brother Angus joined Donald, presumably to safeguard James's interests). In 1544 Lennox ravaged Kintyre, and in the following year Hector Maclean of Duart used his influence with the fourth earl of Argyll to compel James to surrender the Rinns of Islay to him. 
Not for the last time MacDonald showed himself to be both acquisitive and politically adroit. In 1545 he was rewarded for his loyalty by the crown with the grant in heritage of lands in north Kintyre which he had formerly leased; together they constituted the barony of Bar. He also settled his father's dispute with Argyll and married the earl's sister Agnes Campbell. Then when Donald Dubh died late in 1545 MacDonald at once changed his political stance. His father had held a position akin to that of lord of the Isles, and he himself now aspired to the lordship. To that end he wrote to Henry VIII in January 1546, styling himself 'aperand aeyr of the Yllis' and offering to assist Lennox (Macdonald and Macdonald, 1.388). But when he found he could get little support from the islesmen he soon returned to his Scottish allegiance, while Maclean was induced to return the Rinns of Islay. On 12 October 1550 he purchased Ardnamurchan from Argyll. 
MacDonald now turned his attention increasingly to Ireland, where his clansmen were steadily infiltrating Antrim. Some of his cousins who had allied with the English had occupied the Glens of Antrim, but in 1550 these were driven out, and in 1551 MacDonald defeated a retaliatory attack on Rathlin Island. His activities alarmed the English government, and in 1556 he was himself driven from Ulster by the lord deputy, Lord Fitzwalter, from 1557 third earl of Sussex. He returned the next year, and although he defeated Sussex he also tried to make peace, but without success, and in autumn 1558 the English ravaged Arran and Kintyre. The casualties included MacDonald's principal residence, Saddell Castle, granted to him by the earl of Arran two years earlier. Meanwhile Reformation politics had begun to impinge on western Scotland, as Mary of Guise tried to build up James MacDonald, who was a Catholic, as a counterweight to the protestant fifth earl of Argyll. But her efforts failed, as James joined the lords of congregation with 700 foot soldiers. 
In September 1562 Queen Mary gave MacDonald a tack of lands in Islay and Kintyre, but during that year he quarrelled with Hector Mor Maclean of Duart, ostensibly over 'the slaying of a man' ('CSP Scot.', '1545-69', 593), in reality as part of a continuing contest for pre-eminence in the former lordship of the Isles. Argyll tried unsuccessfully to settle their quarrel, which had once more embraced the Rinns of Islay. In July 1563 the two men came before Mary at Glasgow and were instructed to produce their documents. The case was heard on 24 April 1564 and was decided in MacDonald's favour. Meanwhile MacDonald had bought substantial estates in South Uist. 
In 1558, when England faced a hostile Franco-Scottish alliance, Sir Henry Sidney expressed fears that James MacDonald would invade Ulster, with native support from as far away as the Dublin pale. In 1563 an English agent even claimed that it was Scottish policy to make James MacDonald 'Lord of all the Isles of Scotland' ('CSP Ire.', '1509-73', 228). This is unlikely -- before 1560 the Scottish government had supported James's activities in Ireland, but now England and Scotland were at peace. In any case MacDonald's last expedition across the North Channel was an essentially private affair. In 1565 he raised a large army of mercenaries to attack Shane O'Neill, an ally of the Macleans who was endeavouring to subjugate the MacDonalds in Ulster. Moreover O'Neill had married James's daughter but sent her home as unsuitable. But MacDonald was outmanoeuvred by O'Neill and heavily defeated in Glenshesk near Ballycastle on 2 May. Both he and his youngest brother, Somhairle Buidhe (Sorley Boy MacDonnell) were captured, and James died of his wounds at Castle Corcke, no later than 25 August. There were rumours that O'Neill had hastened the process. MacDonald's widow, with whom he had had three sons and two daughters, subsequently married Turlough Luineach O'Neill, Shane's cousin. Her first husband was remembered in Irish tradition as 'a paragon of hospitality and prowess, a festive man of many troops and a bountiful and munificent man' ('AFM', 5.1605).

Neil MacLeod (d. 1613), who in the meantime had gained control of Lewis and of Torquil Dubh's three young sons, proved to be by far the most effective of Roderick's sons. However, he was now to be involved in a struggle of a different kind. In 1598 James VI formed a plan to 'civilize' Lewis and contracted with ten Fife gentlemen, calling themselves the Fife Adventurers, to establish a fishing colony at Stornoway 'for the public good and the king's profit' ('Reg. PCS', 1592-9, 463). This was greeted with alarm by many in the highlands, and Neil led the initial opposition in Lewis. At first he was supported by his brother Murdoch, but later they fell out, and Neil handed his brother over to the Adventurers, one of whose leaders Murdoch had captured, and he was hanged at St Andrews in 1599. During the next six years the settlers were harassed by Neil MacLeod, who had the covert support of Mackenzie of Kintail, even though the latter was ostensibly backing the royal experiment. In 1605 Neil took Stornoway Castle. Two years later Mackenzie was given a royal charter to recapture it and to help the settlers generally, but he managed to warn Neil of the arrival of a supply ship for them, which Neil took.

Russell, John (c.1550-1612), lawyer and author, probably came from a Fife family, but nothing is known of his parents. He is first recorded in 1566, when he received a bachelor's degree from St Leonard's College, in the University of St Andrews; this suggests he was born about 1550. In 1568 he received his MA, and on 28 August 1571, when he was granted a crown pension, he was still described as a student at St Leonard's. He was probably studying law, for on 24 March 1575 he joined the Faculty of Advocates. However, he does not appear to have practised much at first; instead he began to teach, and on 23 March 1580 was called 'doctor utriusque juris' ('doctor of civil and canon law'). 
From the early 1580s Russell's practice at the bar expanded greatly. In Scotland, unlike in England, a lawyer could plead for clients in criminal cases, and Russell became a criminal specialist. Pitcairn's 'Ancient Criminal Trials', selected from manuscript sources, shows Russell in fifty-eight cases between 1580 and 1612, more than any other lawyer. He appeared in some of the most famous and important trials in Scottish history, including the witchcraft trials of Barbara Napier and Euphame MacCalzean, and the 1593 treason trial of the earl of Bothwell. He also had a flourishing civil practice. In 1599 he successfully defended the Edinburgh minister Robert Bruce when James VI tried to deprive him of his pension. On 19 May 1590 he made a Latin oration at Queen Anne's entry into Edinburgh. In 1604 he wrote a tract entitled 'A Treatise of the Happie and Blissed Unioun', supporting further union between England and Scotland. It survives in two manuscripts, one a first draft, the other an Anglicized version sent to the king in London; the Scottish version was printed in 1985 by the Scottish History Society. 
Russell's is one of the longest of twenty-eight surviving treatises that formed part of the union debate in Scotland and England between 1603 and 1605. It is organized as a three-part dialectic, containing arguments first against the union, then in favour of it, and finally refuting the contrary and affirming the positive positions. An appendix contains some practical suggestions. The principal reason given for a union is the increased strength that this will give a united Great Britain, in both religion and secular policy. But Russell approaches his topic as a patriotic lowland Scot. Any union must treat the two countries as equals and not subordinate Scotland to England: 'God forbid! Bettir that we of this age had nevir bein borne, than to sie that miserie in our tyme, thairby to amit [lose] that libertie quhilk our predicessoris have sua lang enjoyit' (Russell, 84). The treatise reveals Russell's characteristics in many other fields, as a committed protestant with an abiding hatred for 'Papistis, falselie callit catholiques' (ibid., 117), and as a well-read man able to quote classical authors from Plato to Eusebius, and moderns such as Machiavelli and Bodin. As befits a doctor of civil and canon law, he mentions various Roman law writers, and cites papal decretals. He decries the lawlessness and disobedience of borderers, highlanders, and princely nobles who think themselves above the law. He produces some astute analyses. He predicts that if the king does not return to reside from time to time in Scotland, the result will be 'ane aristocracie' and the loss of 'the heartis of his people heir' (ibid., 102), a fair description of what happened in the covenanting revolution of 1637-41. 
Russell emerges in both his career and his treatise as an honest but difficult person. In 1602 he ruthlessly pursued three people whom he suspected of burning his house. On 13 May 1609 he refused to obey a direct command from the privy council ordering him to defend Sir James MacDonald of Dunyvaig in a criminal trial. In the treatise, while Russell heaps praise on King James, he also scatters criticisms and unwelcome advice throughout the text; much of this was eliminated from the final draft, but some remained. This may help explain why Russell was rarely employed on public business. Russell had at least two sons, John (born before 4 March 1584), who became a lawyer, and James. He married Marion Carmichael on 17 November 1596, but must have had an earlier wife who was John's mother. He was successful enough to acquire the lands of Wester Granton in Edinburghshire. He died on 7 October 1612. In his inventory, his library was valued at $133 Scots and the king owed him $1200 Scots. His total estate, exclusive of his lands, was worth $2386 Scots.

Scott, Jean, Lady Ferniehirst (b. c.1548, d. after 1593), landowner, was the eldest of the three daughters of Sir William Scott the younger of Buccleuch (1520-1552) and his wife, Grisel (died after 1552), second daughter of John Betoun of Creich. Jean's grandfather had married as his second wife Janet, daughter of Andrew Kerr of Ferniehirst, but in spite of this close connection a violent feud erupted between the Scotts and the Kerrs, near neighbours on the border with England, and in 1552 the situation worsened still further when Jean's father was killed in a skirmish by the Kerrs. In 1565 both families decided on a reconciliation, and a complicated agreement was drawn up, involving various marriages between Scotts and Kerrs. Sir Thomas Kerr, now laird of Ferniehirst, was the only leading member of his family to refuse to take part in the pacification. Ironically, not one of the arranged marriages took place, but when Sir Thomas's first wife, Janet Kirkcaldy, died, leaving him with five small children, he married Jean Scott, daughter of the murdered Sir William. Their wedding in 1569 finally ended the feud, and Jean and Sir Thomas settled down happily together, although when her brother Sir Walter Scott died in 1574, $1000 of her dowry was still unpaid. From the time of her marriage she was known as Lady Ferniehirst as the laird's wife. 
Sir Thomas Kerr was a man of integrity, but his principles resulted in great disruption to their family life. Long active in support of Mary, queen of Scots, he sheltered leaders of the English northern rising at his castle of Ferniehirst, near Jedburgh, in 1569, and as a result an invading English force demolished the building the following spring. He was forced to go into exile on the continent in 1573 after helping his former father-in-law, Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to hold Edinburgh Castle for Mary, and although he was allowed to return in 1581, he was back in France again in 1583. During the early 1580s Jean was a regular correspondent of Mary, queen of Scots, and in her role as an intermediary between James VI and his mother, did much to keep the exiled queen's cause alive in Scotland. She also ran her husband's estates for him, and on 15 January 1583 he granted her power of attorney to deal with his debts in both France and Scotland. 
Jean's activities on her husband's behalf can be glimpsed in a letter she wrote to him from Falkland Palace on 1 September 1583 telling him that she had spent the past month at court trying to persuade James VI to allow him to return. Thanks to the support of the earl of Huntly, her efforts had finally been successful. Sir Thomas could now come back whenever he pleased, she said, and she signed herself in the conventional style of the time, 'Your humble and faythfull bedfallou till deith, Jene Scot' (NA Scot., GD 40, Lothian MSS, portfolio IX). Sir Thomas was restored to public life, but after an incident on the border in 1585, when the English warden's son-in-law Francis, Lord Russell, was killed, he was held partly responsible. He was imprisoned in Aberdeen Castle, where he died the following March, leaving Jean with three sons and a daughter. One of her sons was Robert Carr, James I's favourite, who became earl of Somerset. 
It is not known when Jean Scott died. She is last recorded in 1593, in the only surviving portrait of her, by an unknown artist, which shows her still in deepest mourning, gazing sorrowfully at the viewer. Her hair is concealed by a veil with a widow's peak, she has heavy ropes of pearls round her neck, and her spousing ring can clearly be seen on her right hand, which rests on a book. Above her head is the inscription 'Ubi amor, ibi fides' ('where there is love there is faith'). Like many women of her time, she had supported her husband in both public and private life, finding genuine love and contentment in her arranged marriage.

Stewart, Archibald (c.1530-1584), merchant, was the second son of Sir James Stewart of Beath and nephew of Henry Stewart, Lord Methven, the third husband of Margaret Tudor, widow of James IV. He acquired lands in Newton feued by his elder brother James as commendator of Inchcolm Priory in 1564 and was granted a pension of $40 in July of the same year. He was a friend of John Knox and a 'familiar servant' of James Stewart, earl of Moray, through whose influence as regent he was made a burgess and guild of Edinburgh 'gratis' in September 1569. A year later he was described by Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador and agent, as an 'old acquaintance' ('CSP Scot.', '1569-71', no. 489). Through Randolph, Stewart had various personal cases pressed with Sir William Cecil and the earl of Leicester during the Marian civil war of 1568-73. Stewart married Helen Acheson (died 1585), widow of William Birnie, the wealthiest Edinburgh merchant of his generation, shortly after Birnie's death in 1569. Most of the $29,064 Scots that Birnie left was in merchandise; a substantial amount of it lay in Dieppe. Birnie had also been a client of Regent Moray, whose government had given him and his partner, Alexander Clark, permission to strip the lead from the roof of Elgin Cathedral in 1568. 
Stewart's marriage brought him severe difficulties as well as new-found wealth. A nominal supporter of the king's party in the civil war, Stewart found that the assets of himself, his new wife, and her husband's old business partner in France were seized through the intervention of the Marian agent Sebastian Danelour. From at least September 1569 Stewart played a double game in order to have his goods restored to him. As well as lobbying Cecil and Leicester through Moray, he became an intermediary between William Maitland of Lethington and Queen Mary, held at Tutbury; he was recommended as her 'affectionate servant' ('CSP Scot.', '1569-71', 2, no. 1142). By these means he hoped to cultivate the duke of Norfolk to press his and Clark's case. His goods were eventually released in November 1570, with a hint that more might be done for him if his 'sincerity' to the Marian cause was further demonstrated. Three months later, Stewart, his wife, and Clark agreed to lend money to Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, who held Edinburgh Castle for the exiled queen, with part of the royal jewels as security. In June 1573, after the fall of the castle, all three were ordered to appear before the privy council, which since 1571 had included Stewart's elder brother, together with the jewels in their keeping. 
In public, however, Stewart and his wife, like Clark, had remained staunch supporters of the king's men. Hers was one of the houses of king's supporters demolished by the Marians in May 1572. Stewart was a member of the loyalist Edinburgh town council, which with Patrick, Lord Lindsay of the Byres, as provost, regained control of the capital in July 1572 after a year in exile. He visited John Knox, who had recently returned from his own exile in St Andrews, shortly before Knox's death in November 1572. Some of the loan to Grange was never repaid: Helen Acheson was still owed $758 when she died in 1585, leaving a net $10,496 Scots. Stewart served continuously on the council from 1572 to 1575, once as a bailie, and was an elder on the kirk session in 1574-5. 
In the second half of the 1570s Edinburgh politics, like those of the royal court and privy council, became polarized into pro- and anti-Morton factions. Stewart and Clark went their different ways. Like many other merchants Stewart became alienated by Morton's financial exactions. But the key factor in his allegiances was kinship. The period after Morton's dismissal as regent in April 1578 saw a widespread restoration of Stewart influence. Archibald Stewart was appointed provost of Edinburgh, a central figure in an anti-Morton administration in the capital, replacing Morton's kinsman George Douglas of Parkhead. He survived an attempt by Morton to displace him five months later, when the former regent regained power, and he remained provost until the autumn of 1579, which coincided with the rise to power of another Stewart, the king's cousin Esme. He continued on the town council for a further year but after that slipped out of active politics. His brother was created Lord Doune on 24 November 1581 because he was, as the young King James said, 'of our blood' ('Scots peerage', 3.188); in January 1581 his nephew, also James, had become earl of Moray through his marriage to the daughter of the murdered regent. 
Despite his losses during the civil war Archibald Stewart continued to enjoy prosperity. He acted as surety in August 1581 for a dowry of 8000 merks arranged in the marriage contract between his elder brother's eldest daughter, Mary, and Sir John Weymss. Taxed at three times the merchant average in assessments of 1581 and 1583, Stewart left a net $4128 Scots when he died, childless, in autumn 1584. He was buried, unusually, in St Anthony's aisle in St Giles's, Edinburgh, 'in respect of the honour and dignitie sumtyme borne' by him (Marwick, 1573-89, 348). Six months later, in March 1585, the town council agreed that his wife should be buried alongside him.

Stewart, Elizabeth, countess of Arran (c.1554-1595?), noblewoman, was the daughter of John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl (d. 1579), and his first wife, Elizabeth (died in or before 1557), daughter of George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly. Her first husband, Hugh Fraser, fifth Lord Lovat, died in 1577 leaving her with six children, and on 6 December 1578 Elizabeth married Robert Stewart, earl of Lennox and later earl of March (1522/3-1586), former bishop of Caithness, who was in his fifties, and was dismissed by contemporaries as 'simple and of lyttle action or account' ('Scots peerage', 5.355). Young, beautiful, and passionate, Elizabeth soon found him unsatisfactory, had the marriage annulled on 19 May 1581 on the grounds of his impotence, and on 6 July 1581 married her charismatic and ruthless lover, James Stewart (d. 1596), who on 22 April had been created earl of Arran. 
For several years Arran, along with Esme Stewart, earl of Lennox, virtually ruled the country, while Elizabeth reigned supreme as principal lady at court, infuriating everyone with her coarse, high-handed manner. Her husband acquired a multiplicity of honours and offices, but although he and his wife profited from the complicated political feuding of James VI's minority, in so doing they both attracted bitter hatred. According to gossip, Elizabeth pawned one of the crown jewels and sat beside the judges in the court of session so that she could pervert the course of justice for her own financial gain. In February 1585 she was maliciously rumoured to have been made comptroller, and she was even said to have had dealings with witches, and to have boasted of their prophecy that she would be the greatest woman in Scotland, while her husband would 'have the highest head in that kingdom' (Fergusson, 73-4, 59). 
When Arran fell from power and lost his earldom in 1585, the couple retired to Elizabeth's jointure lands in Inverness-shire, where they rode, hunted, and plotted their return. They had at least three sons and a daughter. According to one report, Elizabeth died in childbirth in 1590, but the Lovat chronicler claimed that the witches' prophecy that she would be the 'greatest' woman in Scotland was hideously fulfilled when she died 'all swelled in an extraordinary manner' from dropsy in 1595 (Fergusson, 74). Arran was murdered later that year. Elizabeth had been known to the church ministers as Lady Jezebel, and one modern historian has suggested that Arran and she were the inspiration for Shakespeare's Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. It is, however, difficult to say how much of her lurid reputation was caused by her own personality, and how much was attributable to the envy of her many enemies.

Carnegie, David, of Colluthie and Kinnaird (d. 1598), administrator, was the second son of Sir Robert Carnegie (d. 1566) of Kinnaird, Forfarshire, lord of session, and his wife, Margaret Guthrie (died 1571), and first appears in official records in 1555-6 as a debt manager. Given an estate by his father, at Panbride, Forfarshire, he also acquired through his first marriage, to Elizabeth (died before 4 March 1567), daughter of Henry Ramsay of Colluthie, the latter's estate in Fife, which became his main base; the couple had two daughters. His second marriage, by contract dated 4 October 1568, was to Euphame (died 1593), daughter of Sir John Wemyss of that ilk; they had four daughters and four sons, including David Carnegie, later first earl of Southesk (1574/5-1658), and John Carnegie, later first earl of Northesk (1578/9-1667). Carnegie had graduated MA, probably in law, but though he used his legal skills in his private business he only rarely used these officially (an exception being when he was named to the parliamentary commission on law reform in 1578) and he never practised as a professional lawyer. 
From 1580 Carnegie was employed by the crown in ecclesiastical affairs and he was king's commissioner to the general assembly which met on 24 April 1583. But it was the experience gained from managing his estates that was particularly exploited by the crown. From 1586 Carnegie was a regular auditor of the exchequer and held other fiscal offices; a privy councillor from 1592, he was a member of more financial commissions than anyone except John Lindsay of Balcarres. Archbishop John Spottiswoode considered that Carnegie was 'a wise, peaceable and sober man, in good credit and estimation with the king, and taken into his Privy Council for his skill and knowledge in civil affairs' (Fraser, 1.59). He was no courtier and, following the death of his second wife on 16 November 1593, married by contract dated 26 April 1594 a woman of relatively humble origins, Janet Henrison (died in or after 1599), possibly widow of Alexander Guthrie, town clerk of Edinburgh. Following the death of his elder brother, Sir John Carnegie, some time between 7 November 1595 and 13 May 1596, he inherited the family patrimony of Kinnaird. 
On 9 January 1596 Carnegie was named as one of the commissioners of a new permanent exchequer with powers of oversight over royal revenues. The commissioners, consisting of six members of the queen's financial council together with John Skene of Curriehill and Carnegie, became known as the Octavians, and for two years constituted an effective team. Carnegie's financial acumen was his particular contribution. He died on 19 April 1598 and was buried, as he had wished, at Kinnaird church.

Thomasine Pendarves (bap. 1618, d. in or after 1671)], daughter of Thomas Newcomen and his wife, Bathsabe ('nee' Philpott), of St Petrox, Dartmouth. She was baptized at Dartmouth on 13 September 1618. The Newcomens were a prominent Devon family, with interests in tin mines and in the exploitation of Ireland. It seems that Thomasine Pendarves was influential among the Abingdon Baptists even before her husband had abandoned the established church. However, her religion was of a more mystical nature than his, and she caused him embarrassment on several occasions, most seriously in 1649. The ranter Abiezer Coppe dedicated to Thomasine his first major work 'Some Sweet Sips of some Spiritual Wine', and published in it an exchange of correspondence he had had with her; her identity was hidden by the use of Hebrew letters but would have been clear to those learned enough to read them and familiar with local personalities. The letters show her as aspiring to the type of visionary prophecy practised by Coppe, and might also suggest an improper relationship between them. Another of her letters was published in the same year by her friend the political prophetess Elizabeth Poole in 'An Alarum of War'. Thomasine had intercepted a letter to her husband from William Kiffin, instructing him to anathematize Poole from the pulpit. Her reply to Kiffin argued against his policy and insisted that, as she could not trust her husband to take the right decision in the matter, further dealings should be with her and not with him. Kiffin does not seem to have responded.

MacGill, James, of Nether Rankeillour (d. 1579), lawyer and administrator, was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of James MacGill, a substantial Edinburgh merchant who was treasurer of the burgh in 1532-3 and 1545-6 and a bailie in 1549-50; and Helen Wardlaw of Torrie, in Fife. His father feued part of the common muir in 1537 and lands at Liberton, to the south of the burgh, in 1538; there is no evidence, however, to support claims that he was knighted and made lord provost of Edinburgh in the reign of James V. The younger James was educated at the University of St Andrews, where he matriculated at the 'Protestant well' of St Leonard's College in 1532. It is likely that after graduating he studied abroad, like many other law students. He was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 1 March 1550. On 4 March 1554 he was confirmed in possession of the lands of Nether Rankeillour, Fife. 
On 25 June 1554, two months after parliament ratified the appointment of Mary of Guise-Lorraine as regent, MacGill became clerk register, succeeding Thomas Marjoribanks, originally a client of Cardinal David Beaton; on 20 August following he was made an ordinary lord of session. His wife, Janet Adamson, daughter of William Adamson of Craigrook and Janet, daughter of Sir Archibald Napier of Merchiston, was one of John Knox's 'dear sisters of Edinburgh'. Knox wrote to her from Lyons, probably in 1557. She came of a prominent Edinburgh family. Her father was on the town council -- a bailie and dean of guild a number of times between 1527 and 1545 -- and her brother William Adamson was entered a burgess in 1542 and became one of the small circle of protestants in the capital in the early 1540s; William married Agnes, younger sister of John Bellenden of Auchnoull, who succeeded his father, Thomas, as justice clerk in 1547. The careers of these two crown servants, MacGill and Bellenden, both drawn from the close-knit Edinburgh establishment, were to shadow each other closely in the 1560s and early 1570s. Between October 1556 and September 1558 MacGill was one of the group of lawyers appointed presidents of the burgh, who could preside over the town council in the absence of the lord provost. He was also one of the trio of well-qualified lawyers appointed to advise the executors of the estate of Robert Reid, bishop of Orkney, who on his death in 1558 left an endowment to found a college in Edinburgh. He was one of the commissioners who negotiated the Anglo-Scottish treaty of Upsettlington (or Ladykirk) in May 1559. 
Although it has been alleged that MacGill, like William Maitland of Lethington, threw his lot in with the lords of the congregation late in 1559, there is no evidence to substantiate this. Knox testifies that their friendship began only late in 1560. Yet it is likely that MacGill would by reason of his office have been involved with the organization of the Reformation parliament of August 1560. He first made contact with the English agent Thomas Randolph in the following month. It is clear that MacGill, in common with the other major office-holders of the crown, survived the revolution of 1559-60 and remained in royal service. He was confirmed as clerk register and appointed to the privy council on the return from France of Queen Mary in August 1561. In the controversy among the reformers which followed the queen's return, when the Catholic mass was said in her private chapel in Holyroodhouse, a debate was held in MacGill's house in Edinburgh in November 1561. MacGill was one of the six privy councillors present who unanimously defended the arrangement, in the teeth of opposition from Knox and other leading ministers. That meeting was recalled by MacGill in the better-known debate between Knox and Lethington in the general assembly of June 1564. 
MacGill's prominence in this period is confirmed by his service on a commission, including Lethington and the earls of Moray and Morton, which devised the compromise settlement for ministers of the new church known as the thirds of benefices and approved by the privy council on 22 December 1561 though denounced by Knox. MacGill was also a member of the subsequent commission set up on 24 January 1562 which scrutinized the rentals of benefices and determined stipends of individual ministers. In August 1562 he accompanied the queen, Moray, and the bulk of the privy council on their progress to the north, which ended with the defeat and death of George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly at Corrichie. In December 1563 MacGill again tried to act as a go-between, arranging a meeting between Knox, Moray, and Lethington at his house. By the time of the meeting of the general assembly in June 1564, however, he was firmly classed by Knox as belonging to the 'courtiers' ('History of the Reformation', 2.102). 
MacGill was not involved in Moray's rebellion in the autumn of 1565 but fled the capital on 18 March 1566, along with Bellenden and Alexander Guthrie, town clerk of Edinburgh, nine days after the murder of the queen's servant David Riccio. He was declared a rebel and deprived of his office, which was given to James Balfour of Pittendreich. His rehabilitation as early as June 1566 suggests that he may have been only marginally involved in the Riccio affair. He was nevertheless singled out by the bishop of Mondovi as 'a man of no family and contriver of all evil' who needed to be eliminated (Pollen, 278). By 1567 he was back in the queen's service, and he sat on the assize which exonerated Bothwell from involvement in the murder of Darnley. By June 1567 he had joined the confederate lords who confronted the queen and Bothwell in the field at Carberry, and after Mary was deposed he became part of the hard core of confederates who emerged as the king's party. He and Sir James Melville were chosen to represent this faction in offering the regency to Moray when he reached Berwick early in August. 
In December 1567 MacGill was restored as clerk register by the new regent. His shifting allegiances in this period provoked an angry reaction in the Marian proclamation issued after the queen's escape from Lochleven in May 1568: he and Henry Balnaves of Halhill were condemned as 'oppin traitouris' and 'airis [heirs] to Judas' (Pollen, 273). Both were to be part of the formidable galaxy of intellectual and legal talent, which also included Lethington and George Buchanan, assembled by Moray to argue the case against Mary in her first trial at York in September 1568. After the York conference MacGill and Lethington were chosen for a special audience with Elizabeth; some later sources, including Calderwood, saw MacGill as the secretary's minder rather than his colleague. The divisions opening up both within Moray's administration and among the king's men as a whole over the treatment of the queen came to a head in a convention, held at Perth in July 1569, over the issue of whether to press for her divorce, an eventuality which might have made her restoration a possibility. Within the administration Bellenden and MacGill were resolutely opposed to this proposal, whereas Lethington and Sir William Murray of Tullibardine, the comptroller, favoured it. The debate was heated and acrimonious. MacGill was later one of the king's men singled out for ridicule in a series of propaganda pieces written by John and Thomas Maitland, the secretary's brothers. The assassination of Moray six months later confirmed these splits. Within a week of the murder MacGill and Morton represented the king's lords at a meeting with English commissioners in Edinburgh, at which they promised the continuance of the 'amity' in return for English military aid and support for Lennox's selection as regent. In March 1571 MacGill accompanied Morton on a mission to England, to ensure the continuing custody of Queen Mary. 
Against this background of difficulties for the king's party MacGill had been appointed lord provost of Edinburgh in October 1570, at the head of a council of king's men. That body was dismissed and exiled from the burgh in June 1571, but it set up a rival administration in the nearby port of Leith. MacGill seems to have been singled out for rough treatment by the Marians in the town. Many of his goods and valuables, which he was attempting to move to safety at Pinkie, were intercepted by a Marian force from the castle in May 1571. He and his son David, also a lawyer and Edinburgh burgess, were forfeited by a Marian parliament in June 1571, and two of his houses as well as that of his son in the town were demolished by the notorious Captain of the Chimneys in 1572. 
Throughout this period, in which the Leith exiles became the most militant element among the king's men, MacGill remained provost. He supervised a campaign of ruthless retribution, inflicted on more than 450 Marian sympathizers in Edinburgh through both the kirk session and the law courts after the exiles returned to the capital in July 1572 and displaced the Marian town council. He continued as a regular attender of meetings of the privy council throughout the period of Morton's regency (1572-8). After the temporary fall of Morton in March 1578, MacGill was confirmed as clerk register and charged, along with George Buchanan, with managing affairs until the next meeting of parliament. Ever the survivor, he continued on the privy council after Morton's rehabilitation. He died in Edinburgh on 16 October 1579. 
With his wife, Janet Adamson, MacGill had five sons and two daughters. The eldest son was James MacGill of Rankeillour, from whom descended the MacGills, viscounts of Oxfurd. The elder James MacGill's brother was David MacGill of Cranstoun Riddel (d. 1595), also a graduate and prominent lawyer. He was made a burgess and guild of Edinburgh 'gratis' by right of his father on 25 September 1555, became a lord of session, and was made a king's advocate in 1582. As early as 1565 his tax assessment showed him to be among the wealthiest ten lawyers in the capital. The MacGill brothers both appeared on a protestant subscription list of 1562 for a poor hospital in the capital. But David MacGill was condemned by the radical minister and diarist James Melville for his 'contempt of the ministrie', and when he died in February 1595, after a long illness, both Andrew and James Melville were present, to witness a death-bed repentance for his years 'without all sense of God' (Melville, 135). David MacGill married twice. With his first wife, Elizabeth Forrester of Corstorphine, he had six sons and two daughters. His eldest son, also David MacGill of Cranstoun Riddel, followed his father in making his career in the law. He became a lord of session and was made a privy councillor in 1603, but died young in 1607. Elizabeth died on 16 March 1579, and her husband then married Isobel Cunningham, who survived him.

Morrison, Sophia (1859-1917), cultural fieldworker in the Isle of Man and campaigner for the Manx language, was born on 24 May 1859 at Peel, Isle of Man, the third of nine children of Charles Morrison (1824-1880), merchant and ship owner, and Louisa Crellin (1830-1901). Her father was a well-respected figure who owned a fleet of fishing boats operating from the western fishing port of Peel. His relative wealth provided sufficient means to fund training for the professions of doctor and chemist for two of her brothers. From a background where education was keenly encouraged Morrison developed an interest in languages, particularly those of the Romance and Goidelic Celtic groups. As well as Manx Gaelic she was fluent in French and possessed a working knowledge of Italian, Spanish, and Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Diary entries reveal that she was already well read in European literature as a teenager. 
Despite being brought up in an English-speaking household Morrison became a fluent speaker of Manx Gaelic. She taught the language at evening classes in Peel, and in 1899 was among the founder members of Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh (YnCG; the Manx Language Society), of which she was appointed honorary secretary in 1901. She was editor and proprietor of the society's journal, 'Mannin', which appeared between 1913 and 1917, in nine volumes. 
Morrison was in constant contact with Manx antiquarians, including A. W. Moore (1853-1909), J. J. Kneen (1873-1938), and W. H. Gill (1839-1923), and held the post of vice-president of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society in 1912. She contributed an article on A. W. Moore to the 'Dictionary of National Biography' and to the 'Celtic Review'. Influenced greatly by figures of the previous generation such as the poet T. E. Brown and the music collector Dr John Clague she was committed to collecting and promoting all aspects of Manx culture. Furthermore she acted as a facilitator, securing the publication of pioneering teaching aids such as Goodwin's 'First Lessons in Manx' (1901). As a member of YnCG she was frequently part of the Manx delegation to the pan-Celtic movement, and her attitude was firmly that of the pan-Celticist rather than the narrowly nationalist. Her work as secretary to YnCG also brought her into regular contact with leading Celticists such as professors John Rhys (Oxford), Quiggin (Cambridge), and Watson (Edinburgh), as well as with Douglas Hyde (Dublin). 
Morrison's collection of folklore was greatly influenced by her friendship with the German folklorist Charles Roeder (1848-1911), who was based in Manchester; together with Roeder she published 'Manx Proverbs and Sayings' (1905). She bridged the worlds of informant and collector, and of educator and educated. She was widely accepted as the island's authority on Manx fairy lore, having published research in 'Folk Lore', for example. She contributed the Manx sections in 'Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries' by Evans-Wentz (1911), and her own publication 'Manx Fairy Tales' appeared in 1911, with subsequent editions in 1929 and 1991. 
In addition to her work for Manx Gaelic, Morrison was an important figure in developing 'Anglo-Manx' dialect writing, working extensively with the local theatrical company the Peel Players, who performed on the island and in Liverpool. She staged many plays by Christopher Shimmin and Josephine Kermode (Cushag). Joseph Wright's 'English Dialect Dictionary', for which she was an invited reader, proved invaluable in preparing 'A Vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx Dialect' (1924). The 'Vocabulary' was instigated by A. W. Moore and completed by Morrison with the aid of her relative the linguist Edmund Goodwin (1844-1924). It represents a series of snapshots of the Manx English linguistic situation of the late nineteenth century in particular, and draws on literary and oral sources. 
Morrison, who did not marry and lived with her parents until their decease, suffered in later life from neuralgic headaches and severe problems with her eyes, and underwent several operations. She died, of cancer, on 14 January 1917 at her home, 15 Athol Street, Peel. Her funeral, in Peel on 17 January, was well attended, her coffin being carried by members of the Peel Players. She was buried in Peel cemetery. 'No heavier blow has ever befallen the cause of Manx nationality' (Caine, 499). 
It is only Morrison's extreme sense of modesty that has concealed her contribution to the Manx revival. During a period of cultural and linguistic activity on the Isle of Man she was instrumental in introducing Manx Gaelic teaching in schools, and pioneered phonograph recordings of Manx Gaelic and Manx English speech and music. The all-encompassing nature of her contribution to Manx culture means that Sophia Morrison was the very locus for Manx revivalist, antiquarian, and folklore circles at the turn of the twentieth century.

MacGregor, Alexander (1806-1881), Church of Scotland minister and writer of Scottish Gaelic prose, was born on 26 May 1806 at the Mission House, Dalfuil, Glengairn, near Ballater, the eldest of the four children of the Revd Robert MacGregor (1767-1846) and his wife, Janet Menzies. Robert MacGregor was a collector of Gaelic poetry and a Gaelic poet. In addition to being a missionary on the Royal Bounty, he taught at a school during the week and it was there that Alexander received his early education before proceeding to King's College, Aberdeen, from which he graduated MA in 1827, having gained prizes in natural philosophy and mathematics. He then attended the Divinity Hall at the University of Edinburgh from 1831 to 1835. On concluding his studies he rejoined his parents who were now resident in the parish of Kilmuir, Skye, to which his father had answered a call in 1822. Remaining with the established church after the Disruption of 1843, he was ordained as assistant and successor to his father in 1844. On 18 December 1846 he married Catherine MacGregor (1822-1889); they had eight children, of whom six survived to adulthood. Their eldest grandson was Sir Alasdair Duncan Atholl MacGregor (1883-1945) whose posts included appointment as chief justice of the supreme court of Hong Kong in 1934. In 1850 Alexander MacGregor accepted a call to Edinburgh's Gaelic church and in 1853 he was translated to the West Church, Inverness, where he remained until he died in 1881. After his death one writer observed that: 'his large heart, his truly catholic spirit, his boundless charity knew not the mean, selfish, repulsive creed of those that would scarcely admit to Heaven any one but those who could see eye to eye with them in matters of ecclesiastical form and ceremony. (Mackenzie, 93)' MacGregor was one of the most prolific writers in Scottish Gaelic in the nineteenth century, contributing under the pen-names Alasdair Ruadh, Sgiathanach, and S. to most contemporary periodicals which published Gaelic. He has received little attention from scholars of Gaelic literature in the past, in part because Gaelic prose is under-researched as compared with poetry and song, but equally because his use of pen-names has tended to conceal the true extent and significance of his writing. Until the nineteenth century Gaelic prose was predominantly religious in nature and tended to be translated rather than original. MacGregor's writings, along with those of the Revd Dr Norman MacLeod (1783-1862), were crucial in establishing a register for non-religious writing, and broke new ground by experimenting with new genres, most notably the prose dialogue. His Gaelic writings appeared mainly in 'Cuairtear nan Gleann' (1840-43), 'Fear-Tathaich nam Beann' (1848-50), 'An Gaidheal' (1871-7), and 'Highlander' (1873-81). 
One of MacGregor's aims was to provide useful information and morally uplifting literature for Gaels in their native language. Thus his writings cover a breadth of subjects, ranging from essays which describe North America for intending emigrants, support the abolition of slavery, explain astronomy and coral, discuss education in the highlands, and argue the need for both Gaelic and English to be used in highland schools, to moral tales which promote self-help, temperance, and thrift. His prose dialogues, of which he wrote no fewer than sixty-four, draw on similar topics to his essays, but attempt to make information accessible to readers by using more colloquial language and by using characters to lend authority to the information being conveyed. MacGregor's partiality for this genre indicates a consciousness of his audience's requirements, as he used the dialogue to facilitate the transition between an essentially oral culture and the printed word. He also wrote prose in English relating to the highlands and he undertook a number of translations from English to Gaelic. He translated texts of guidance for fishermen and mariners into Gaelic, but most notable was his translation into Gaelic of the 'Apocrypha', undertaken at the request of Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte and published in 1860. MacGregor had a great interest in highland folklore and history and was described by a contemporary as 'our best Gaelic scholar, and the first authority upon all questions connected with the history, antiquities, traditions, language and literature of his countrymen' (Mackenzie, 95). In common with a number of contemporaries, such as Sheriff Alexander Nicolson, he collected Gaelic proverbs. However, instead of presenting them in the usual form of a list, he embedded them in his dialogues so as to display them in a manner more reflective of their everyday use. He wrote over thirty essays in English on highland destitution, Gaelic literature, and highland history. His contribution on the parish of Kilmuir to the 'New Statistical Account of Scotland' runs to some fifty pages and contains a wealth of information. His collected essays on Flora Macdonald were published in one volume, 'The Life of Flora Macdonald and her Adventures with Prince Charlie' (1882), as were some of his writings on highland folklore in 'Highland Superstitions' (1891) and a lecture on highland history in 'The Feuds of the Clans' (1907). He was instrumental in setting up the 'Celtic Magazine' in 1876 along with Alexander MacKenzie, who was to be its editor. 
MacGregor died on 19 October 1881 at his home, 4 Victoria Terrace, Inverness, and was buried five days later in the chapelyard, Inverness. An elegy to him was composed by the renowned Gaelic poet Mary MacPherson (1821-1898), 'Marbhrann don Urramach Alasdair MacGriogair' ('Elegy to the Reverend Alexander MacGregor') (Meek, 140).

MacLeod, Roderick (d. 1595), highland chief, was the son of Malcolm MacLeod of Lewis (died 'c'.1528) and his wife, Christine Urquhart of Cromarty. His family, which owned Assynt and Coigeach on the Scottish mainland together with the island of Lewis, had been closely connected with the lords of the isles, and when Donald Dubh MacDonald, the last of that line, escaped from prison in 1501 it was to Torquil MacLeod of Lewis, his uncle by marriage, that he turned for help. For his part in Donald's rising Torquil's lands were forfeited to the crown in 1506, but five years later they were returned to his brother Malcolm. Having succeeded his father, Roderick continued the family tradition of support for MacDonald claimants to the lordship of the isles in 1539 and again in 1545. Summoned for treason he failed to appear, and in 1554-5 the fourth earl of Argyll besieged Stornoway Castle. Although it withstood Argyll's artillery, Roderick submitted and was pardoned. 
Roderick MacLeod carried on feuds with many of his neighbours, but most of his later life was overshadowed by turmoil within his own family. He was married three times, to Janet Mackenzie, daughter of John Mackenzie of Kintail ['see under 'Mackenzie family of Kintail], to Barbara Stewart of Avondale in 1541, and to Janet Maclean of Duart. When a son, Torquil, was born to Janet Mackenzie, Roderick claimed that he was the child of Hugh Morrison, breve of Lewis, and divorced her. Torquil was brought up by his mother's people in Strathconon and was consequently known as Torquil Cononach. With Barbara Stewart, Roderick had another son, Torquil Oighre (the Heir), who, however, was drowned about 1563. Some ten years later Roderick married Janet Maclean and they had two sons, Torquil Dubh and Tormod. He also had five acknowledged illegitimate sons. 
The death of Torquil Oighre saw the start of the long and complicated tale of the 'ewill trowbles of the Lewes' (Macphail, 265). Roderick MacLeod had appeared to accept Torquil Cononach as his heir, but went back on this in favour of Donald Gormson MacDonald of Sleat, whose father had married a daughter of Roderick's brother Torquil. Torquil Cononach captured his father and held him prisoner for three years. On his release Roderick complained to the privy council of his 'evill handiling captivite feir of my life perell of hunger and cauld and manifest compulsione' (ibid., 282). On his release he made his third marriage and had his two younger sons. In 1576 Torquil Cononach again captured his father at Stornoway together with the family charters, and handed the latter over to his uncle Mackenzie of Kintail for safe keeping. Meanwhile the five illegitimate sons divided, with Donald, Rory Og, and Neil supporting their father, and Tormod and Murdoch backing Torquil Cononach. During the ensuing turmoil the latter's eldest son was killed by Rory Og, while Donald killed Tormod but was himself captured and beheaded by Torquil Cononach, who never lost the support of his Mackenzie relatives with their considerable influence at court. 
Roderick MacLeod died in 1595, in nominal possession of Lewis and with the young Torquil Dubh as his heir. In August 1596, however, Torquil Cononach received a royal charter for the lands and barony of Lewis and the lands of the mainland, and after the death from fever of his second son he named Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail as his heir. A year later Torquil Dubh invaded Coigeach but was captured and killed by Torquil Cononach, while Kintail abducted the dead man's brother Tormod from school in the lowlands and held him prisoner for several years. After his release Tormod saved the life of Torquil Cononach when the latter was captured by John MacHutcheon MacLeod of Sanday. In 1605 Torquil's daughter and heir, Margaret, married Roderick or Rory, the brother of Kintail, who gave him a charter for Coigeach while reserving a life-rent for Roderick's father-in-law. Torquil Cononach was dead by 1609, when Roderick was granted a crown charter for the lands. 


Finally, in 1610, after he had been made a peer for his good service in Lewis, Mackenzie was instructed to allow Neil to negotiate, a process apparently forwarded when Neil by treachery seized and handed over an English pirate ship. But MacLeod's opposition to the Adventurers was reinvigorated when Mackenzie died in February 1611. In spite of having by now lost most of the island of Lewis he withdrew with his 'infamous byke of lawles and insolent lymmaris [ruffians]' to the rock of Berisay, at the mouth of Loch Roag in the west of Lewis, and there turned to piracy ('Reg. PCS', 1610-13, 3). They eventually surrendered to Roderick Mackenzie after a threat to drown their women and children, and Neil was executed in Edinburgh on 13 March 1613; he was reported to have died 'verie christianlie' (Mackenzie, 258). 
Neil MacLeod left two sons, Donald and Rory Dubh, who were released in 1613 on the promise of good behaviour but returned to Lewis to make trouble; Rory was killed there while Donald was captured and banished to England, from where he went to Holland. The three sons of Torquil Dubh also all disappear from the record around 1613, while his brother Tormod was exiled. Neil's brother Rory Og, who died after escaping from Duart Castle, left three sons, of whom William and Rory were executed as rebels while Malcolm, after years of piracy, died in Ireland. Thus ended a line which was subsequently described as 'the stoutest prettiest men, but a bloody wicked crew whom neither law nor reason could guide or moddell, destroying one another till in the end they were all expelled of that country' (Mackay, 265). The heir male of the family was MacLeod of Raasay, but the lands of Lewis, Assynt, and Coigeach were inherited, after so much 'ewill trowble', by the Mackenzie descendants of Torquil Cononach's daughter.
