<span class="headword">Allen,  (Herbert) Warner</span>  (1881&#150;1968), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born at Godalming on 8 March 1881, the elder son of Captain George Woronzow Allen RN, and his wife, Ethel Harriet, daughter of the Revd Canon John Manuel Echalaz (1801&#150;1877), rector of Appleby in Derbyshire and fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. He was educated at Charterhouse School, where he came under the influence of the classicist T. E. Page. He won a scholarship to University College, Oxford, and obtained a first class in classical honour moderations in 1902, and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1904. Having had some disinclination towards metaphysics, and a leaning towards a literary career, he had meanwhile taken up modern languages and won the Taylorian Spanish scholarship in 1903.<br>
<br>When writing his first book, an edition of the translation by James Mabbe of the Spanish <span class="italic">Celestina</span> (1908) Allen supported himself by journalism. In 1908 he married Ethel, the daughter of Warwick Pembleton, and they had one son, G. Warner Allen. Also in 1908 he was appointed to the position of Paris correspondent of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. He thus became immersed in French life at the end of the <i>belle &eacute;poque</i>, and reported the sensational trial of Mme Caillaux. Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he was made an official representative of the British press at the French front. In 1917 he accompanied the British divisions diverted to support the Italians, and remained in Italy until the following year, when he was transferred to the American expeditionary force in France, and accompanied it in its occupation of Germany, where he stayed until March 1919. Out of these experiences he published <span class="italic">The Unbroken Line</span> (1916) and, with the paintings of Captain Martin Hardie, <span class="italic">Our Italian Front</span> (1920). He was made CBE (1920) and chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur for his war services.<br>
<br>As an extramural obligation to his proprietor Allen participated in the cross-channel flight of the <i>Morning Post</i> dirigible, which ended in disaster; but he fortunately escaped almost unscathed. He was foreign editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> (1925&#150;8), and London editor of the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> (1928&#150;30), while at the same time he made many contributions to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. He then retired to Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, in Berkshire, to concentrate on writing books, and produced some of his best and well-respected works on wine, including <span class="italic">The Romance of Wine</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Sherry</span> (1934); he had already published <span class="italic">The Wines of France</span> (1924). It was also at this time that he produced the first of his detective novels, <span class="italic">The Uncounted Hour: a Crime Story</span> (1936), and collaborated with E. C. Bentley on <span class="italic">Trent's Own Case</span> (1936), a sequel to Bentley's earlier mystery novel, <span class="italic">Trent's Last Case</span> (1913). His writing was interrupted, however, by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Although fifty-eight years old, he was then gazetted acting wing commander, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, and he served as assistant deputy director in the foreign division of the Ministry of Information from 1940 to 1941.<br>
<br>After the war, Allen returned to writing about wine, publishing <span class="italic">A Contemplation of Wine</span> and <span class="italic">Natural Red Wines</span> (1951), <span class="italic">White Wines and Cognac</span> and <span class="italic">Sherry and Port</span> (1952), and ending with <span class="italic">A History of Wine: Great Vintage Wines from the Homeric Age to the Present Day</span> (1961). In all of his publications on the subject, vinous information was nicely interwoven with literary and historical allusions. He travelled widely among the European vineyards; his accurate judgement of wine was recognized by all amateurs qualified to assess this, and he was greatly respected by the leaders of the wine trade.<br>
<br>Allen himself, however, set greatest value on a series of mystical writings such as <span class="italic">The Timeless Moment</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">The Uncurtained Throne</span> (1951). As a youth Allen had abandoned formal Anglicanism, but T. E. Page had imbued him with the spirit of Plato, and later reading of Plotinus and acquaintance with, among others, T. S. Eliot and Dean W. R. Inge evoked in him a perception of transcendental values and a faith in the immortality of the soul&#151;attuned to an ethic that was certainly Christian. This gave him great personal serenity and an outward gentleness of address which made him deeply loved, particularly by the young.<br>
<br>Warner, as everyone called Allen, was a man of rather above average height, with kindly features and, as the French politely put it, a <i>l&eacute;ger embonpoint</i> of the true gourmet. He was a keen Savage in the heyday of the Savage Club, and was naturally elected to the Saintsbury Club, founded in oenophilist memory of Professor George Saintsbury, with its limited membership and precious cellar. At home and at his club he went to great pains to select food and wines that would gratify his guests, who were usually considerable connoisseurs. Although he lived long as a countryman and had a fine garden, he was not addicted to field sports. But with his vast reading, undimmed memory, and facility with words, he had a quick draw and a flawless aim for the clues of the <span class="italic">Times</span> crossword puzzles.<br>
<br>Allen died at his Berkshire home, Iden House, Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, on 12 January 1968, and was mourned by a large circle of friends, and a school of young disciples who were perhaps more attracted by his philosophy of the table than by his spiritual intimations.<br>
