<span class="headword">Rolleston,  William</span>  (1831&#150;1903), <span class="occ">farmer and politician in New Zealand</span>, was born at Maltby Hall, Yorkshire, on 19 September 1831, the third son and ninth child of George Rolleston (1791&#150;1868), a Church of England clergyman and squire, and Anne Nettleship (<i>d</i>. 1851), the daughter of a well-known family of Lincolnshire scholars. The physiologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24026/', "George Rolleston")</script> was his brother. His family background was upper middle class rather than aristocratic, as some of his political opponents imagined. After studying at Rossall School, Lancashire, he took up a scholarship at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Much to his disappointment he won only a second-class degree in the classical tripos of 1855 and, disillusioned with his prospects in England, decided to emigrate. The premature death of his mother in 1851 removed his main tie to England, and he sailed to Canterbury in 1858 with &pound;500 earned during two years of tutoring.<br>
<br>Rolleston began colonial life as an employee on a high country sheep farm at Waireka (Lake Coleridge), where he became notorious for swearing at his bullocks in Greek. In 1861 he took up a run at the Rakaia Forks (Mount Algidus). He remained wary of run-holding because he lacked the capital to make a real success of the enterprise. Once he became engaged to (Elizabeth) Mary Brittan, the daughter of a Canterbury land developer, he determined on a more secure form of employment. He seemed rather relieved when he sold out at a profit in 1865 to take up the post of under-secretary of native affairs in Wellington (he had already had experience of local administration). The couple were married at Christchurch on 24 May 1865.<br>
<br>Rolleston turned to politics in 1868, when he stood for and won the superintendency of Canterbury Province, a position he held until the abolition of the provinces in 1876. He was also member of the house of representatives for Avon (1868&#150;84). Many of his supporters hoped for an administration which favoured the squatting interest, but Rolleston frustrated them by promoting closer settlement and enforcing policies opposed to land monopoly. Big landowners and their lawyers found their way around his regulations rather easily, but felt aggrieved at the superintendent's even-handedness. Rolleston also worked closely with Charles Bowen, the champion of the idea that primary education should be compulsory, free, and secular, and helped establish the Canterbury University College in 1873. These were prosperous years for Canterbury, and Rolleston became a very popular superintendent.<br>
<br>Rolleston's major chance at the parliamentary level came in 1879, when he assumed the deputy leadership in John Hall's ministry and served as minister of lands and native affairs. Rolleston is reputed to have exclaimed, on seeing how effectively a handful of owners had locked up Canterbury land, &#145;Lord lay not this sin to my charge&#146;. He subsequently surprised many by trying to introduce a radical perpetual lease in 1882. The legislative council rendered this initiative ineffective by adding a right of purchase clause. Even so, Rolleston won popularity for his administration of the important lands portfolio. His shorter term as minister of native affairs proved less successful: he actually approved the invasion of the Maori pacifist stronghold of Parihaka, but left the execution of this barbarous act to John Bryce in 1881.<br>
<br>Rolleston had a chequered parliamentary career after 1882. He made little impact in opposition to the ministry of Robert Stout and Julius Vogel and lost his seat to W. P. Reeves in 1887. He returned to the house in 1891 as leader of the rather demoralized and divided opposition, but could not compete with either the level-headed John Ballance or, later, the combative Richard Seddon. He faced a special problem in that he found himself approving the attempts of John McKenzie and the Liberals to promote closer settlement, and confined himself to carping about details. This performance lacked both inspiration and conviction, and the Liberals routed Rolleston and many other long-serving opposition members in the 1893 election. Rolleston returned for a final term in 1896 but failed to halt the Liberal onslaught before being defeated once more in 1899, a man seemingly out of tune with the new populist and democratic tenor of New Zealand politics. He often appeared to be on the wrong side because he was very much a &#145;new Liberal&#146; in supporting state intervention and universal education. Unlike most of New Zealand's so-called conservatives, he did not adhere to <i>laissez-faire</i> philosophies but rather believed that government should be actively involved in sorting out the social problems of the day, especially by promoting closer settlement of the land. His upbringing, classical education, and long association with the old landed Canterbury order, however, made it impossible for him to join the self-made men of the New Zealand Liberal Party, who spurned the classics and equated good family with monopoly and privilege.<br>
<br>Rolleston retired to his 1600 acre farm at Kapunatiki at the mouth of the Rangitata River. By now a rather lonely and isolated figure, he consoled himself by planting trees and reading the classics. He visited England before his death at his home on 8 February 1903; he left a widow, five sons, two of whom served in the New Zealand parliament, and four daughters.<br>
