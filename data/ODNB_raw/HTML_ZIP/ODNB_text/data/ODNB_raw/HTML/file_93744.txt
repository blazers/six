<span class="headword">Reina,  Casiodoro  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1594), <span class="occ">Reformed minister and translator</span>, was Spanish by birth, probably from Seville or nearby Montemol&iacute;n. The names of his parents are not recorded. After graduating from the University of Seville he was ordained and then joined the Observantine Hieronymite monastery of San Isidoro del Campo, where with Antonio del Corro and Cipriano de Valera he adopted protestantism&#151;all three were burnt in effigy in April 1562.<br>
<br>By 1557 Reina had fled with his parents to Geneva, where he joined the Italian congregation. He then settled in London, soon after Elizabeth I's accession, and was preaching privately, in Spanish, three times a week, before in 1560 he petitioned Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, and Sir William Cecil for permission to establish a Spanish church, arguing that public meetings would silence accusations of spying or doctrinal error. The petition succeeded and the community was assigned the church of St Mary Axe, while Reina received a royal pension. The French and Dutch churches regarded the new congregation coolly, and the Spanish church was still seeking in April 1563 to be recognized as their equal with a seat on the <i>coetus</i>, the synod of ministers and lay elders that oversaw the stranger churches. But despite these reservations Reina reportedly attended the colloquy of Poissy in August 1561, presumably in the entourage of the French minister Nicolas des Gallars.<br>
<br>The other stranger churches doubted Reina's religious orthodoxy; he was friendly with suspected heretics, and there were rumours that his congregation held unorthodox opinions on the Trinity. On 21 January 1561 the French church grudgingly approved the Spanish confession of faith, but in 1564, following Reina's departure, letters to him from Corro were found which seemed to confirm his anti-trinitarianism. By then, however, Reina was in exile. On 31 August 1563 he appeared before the French consistory, claiming that he had been accused of deceit, heresy, adultery, and sodomy, and on its advice put his case before the bishop of London. In September Grindal appointed a commission to investigate the charges of doctrinal errors and sodomy, but Reina, erroneously believing that sodomy at that time was a capital offence, fled the country on the 21st.<br>
<br>Reina escaped to Frankfurt via Antwerp, but in 1564 was in France, where he sought the support of Gallars and Corro. He returned to Frankfurt in 1565 but the accusations made in London continued to dog his career. For the next three years he travelled between Frankfurt, Strasbourg, and Basel, and became friendly with a number of influential German churchmen, including the Strasbourg humanist Johann Sturm, while working on a Spanish translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. It was published in Basel in August 1569. Reina then returned to Frankfurt with his family. In 1561 he had married Anna de Nivelles (<i>d</i>. 1612), daughter of Abraham Leon of Nivelles and widow of Dr Thomas le Feure, in London, but only one son, Marcus, had survived infancy. Settled in Frankfurt, they had four more children: Augustus (<i>b</i>. 1571), Margarethe (<i>b</i>. 1573), Servas (<i>b</i>. 1575), and Johan (<i>b</i>. 1577). On 16 August 1571 Reina became a citizen, a month after his admission as a full member of the city's French church, on condition that he again refute the accusations against him and resolve the ill will that had arisen from them between himself and the Calvinist leader Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze. Although Reina was probably engaged in the silk trade during these years, he also published two Latin commentaries on the gospels in 1573, and a Spanish confession of faith in 1577.<br>
<br>At this point an opportunity arose to serve the French Lutheran congregation in Antwerp. Before taking up the post Reina returned to London to address the allegations made against him in 1563. Grindal, now archbishop of Canterbury, convened a hearing at Lambeth Palace on 18 December 1578. The London stranger churches were particularly alarmed that Reina intended to serve the Lutheran church in Antwerp, and so would be in opposition to the Calvinist congregations there. But the matter was finally settled in March 1579, after Reina signed a declaration accepting the terms of the predominantly Calvinist Helvetic confession, although this proved insufficient to reconcile him to the French church.<br>
<br>Reina's appointment in Antwerp was approved by the city council on 6 August 1579, but his ministry was strongly opposed by the Antwerp Calvinists, led by another former London minister, Pierre Loyseleur de Villiers. The declarations made before Grindal establishing his Calvinist credentials were circulated in an attempt to discredit him among his new Lutheran flock, but although some damage was done, Reina's ministry seems to have been successful and he was well regarded. Following the Spanish occupation of Antwerp in 1585 he led the French-speaking congregation to Frankfurt, where he established a charitable fund for its relief. Having been initially passed over by the city authorities, he was appointed minister of the exile congregation on 20 April 1593. He died in Frankfurt the following year, on 15 March 1594, and was buried there two days later.<br>
