<span class="headword">Whitmore, Sir  George</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1572, <em>d.</em> 1654), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was born in London, the second son of William Whitmore (<i>d</i>. 1593), a London merchant, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1615), daughter of Sir William Bond, a London haberdasher and alderman, and granddaughter of Sir George Bond, lord mayor of London in 1587&#150;8. George Whitmore's elder brother, Sir William Whitmore (1572&#150;1648), was a lawyer and a member of the Haberdashers' Company and of the Merchant Adventurers; he sat as MP for Bridgnorth in 1621, 1624, and 1625, a constituency held by his son, Thomas (1612&#150;1653) in the Long Parliament, until his expulsion as a royalist in 1644. George Whitmore's eldest sister, Elizabeth, married Sir William Craven, lord mayor of London (1610 and 1618), and was perhaps the richest woman in England when her estate passed to her son at her death in 1624. His younger sister, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1656), married Sir John Weld and was the mother of the property developer Humphrey Weld.<br>
<br>Whitmore was apprenticed with his older brother as a haberdasher and later served two terms as master of the Haberdashers' Company (1621&#150;2, 1631&#150;2). He became a member of the Virginia Company in 1609, and owned substantial stock in the East India Company. In 1611 he married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1594&times;6?), daughter of Reynold (or Reginald) Copcott and Jaquelina Hoergaerden. Her stepfather was Richard Daniell (<i>d</i>. 1630), burgess of Truro, Cornwall, and owner of the former crown manor of Alverton. The couple had at least three sons and four daughters. In 1631 he rebuilt, in the Italianate style, his residence at Balmes (Baumes) House, Hoxton, in the parish of St Leonard, Shoreditch, where he lived until his death.<br>
<br>Whitmore's political career began with his election as sheriff for 1621&#150;2, followed by service as alderman for Farringdon Within (1621&#150;6) and Langbourne (1626&#150;43), and then as lord mayor of London in 1631&#150;2. He was knighted on 27 May 1632 and served as president of Bethlem and Bridewell hospitals in 1632&#150;42. As a wealthy alderman and an undersharer of the customs, in June 1639 he was asked to support a city loan to the crown of &pound;100,000, and later in the month, when the aldermen as a body showed themselves unfavourable to the loan, he was one of the seven who agreed to it. With the loan's failure, the customs farmers secured &pound;250,000 for the king, including loans from Whitmore and five other aldermen. Upon Charles I's return from Scotland in November 1641, he welcomed the king at Balmes in an elaborate ceremony, and had a road cut through his estate to smooth the royal journey.<br>
<br>On 3 December 1641 Whitmore was one of the aldermen who presented a petition to Charles urging him to remain near the capital and condemning recent disorders in the London area. With other wealthy supporters of Charles I he allegedly offered to raise 10,000 troops to protect the king in London at the time of the royal departure in January 1642. In February&#150;March 1642 he was one of the aldermen who signed a petition protesting at parliament's vesting of the London trained bands in the hands of a committee of safety, and acted to defend the claims of the lord mayor and aldermen to control of the city militia.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the civil war Whitmore was, in December 1642, a supporter of what parliament considered a royalist-backed petitioning campaign in the City, urging the need for an immediate peace. Meanwhile, his refusal to contribute to loans requested by parliament and its committees had been followed by refusal to pay an assessment of &pound;1500 set by the committee for the advance of money, which led to his arrest and imprisonment in Crosby House, London. With six other aldermen he was transferred to prison at Yarmouth, and later moved to Winchester House and thence to Lambeth Palace in 1644; the committee began seizing his assets, including rents from properties in Essex and East India Company stock. Meanwhile the court of aldermen removed Whitmore from his seat on 2 May 1643. He eventually received a discharge for his sequestered estates from the committee for compounding in 1651. He died at Balmes on 12 December 1654 and was buried at St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, London, on 6 January 1655. The estates he left to his sons included not only Balmes, but also properties in Yorkshire, Northumberland, Berkshire, Somerset, Dorset, and Essex.<br>
