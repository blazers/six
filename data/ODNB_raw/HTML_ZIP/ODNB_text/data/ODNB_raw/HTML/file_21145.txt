<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pakington, Sir  John</span>  (1549&#150;1625), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the son of Sir Thomas Pakington (<i>d</i>. 1571), sheriff of Worcester, and Dorothy Kytson (1531&#150;1577) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68014/', "Tasburgh, Dorothy")</script>]. His grandfather Robert Pakington was a London mercer and MP for the city, murdered in 1537. Robert was brother to the judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21143/', "Sir John Pakington (b. in or before 1477, d. 1551)")</script>. From his uncle Sir John, Sir Thomas inherited estates near Droitwich in Worcestershire, including the manors of Hampton Lovett and Westwood; and from his mother, lands in and around the town of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The main Worcestershire estates passed in turn to John, but John's mother, Dorothy, exercised what she evidently considered to be regalian rights at Aylesbury. On 4 May 1571, as &#145;lord and owner of the town&#146;, she nominated its burgesses without reference to any of the inhabitants. Dorothy's second husband, Thomas Tasburgh, sat more than once for the town and during the reign of Elizabeth, Aylesbury seems to have almost always sent Pakington nominees to parliament and has been justly described as an Elizabethan pocket borough.<br>
<br>Pakington was enrolled as a student by special admission at Lincoln's Inn on 22 November 1570. He was presented to the queen during her visit to Worcester in 1572, and was invited to court. It was reported that Elizabeth admired his athletic achievements, but that when he challenged other courtiers to swim against him from Westminster to London Bridge, she vetoed the competition. Naunton described him as &#145;a brave gentleman and a very fine courtier&#146;, but &#145;an ill husband of opportunity&#146;; for while at Elizabeth's court he &#145;stood very high in her grace, but he came in and went out, through disassiduity, drew the curtain between himself and the light of her grace&#146;  (Naunton, 32). However, Pakington remained sufficiently in the queen's favour to win a knighthood, conferred in November 1587.<br>
<br>Pakington found other routes to fortune. In November 1598 he married Dorothy, daughter of Humphrey Smith and widow of Alderman Benedict Barnham, a liveryman of the Drapers' Company; one son, John, was born to them<a href="#cosubject_21144"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>. On 20 May of the same year Pakington was granted the lucrative starch patent, which he assigned to the grocer George Berisford and three others, who in turn issued licences to five London retailers. Another monopoly, of salt, appears to have borne heavily on the burgesses and bailiffs of Droitwich, where salt was extracted, and to have led to their refusal later that year to pay taxes. As their local lord, John Pakington was one of the justices to whom the privy council looked to enforce obedience. Probably in early 1601, a Nicholas Scott lodged a complaint to the effect &#145;that Sir John Pakington the starch patentee, and his assigns, have farmed the counties of England for yearly rents, to the impoverishment of the retail grocers of London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 14.169). In the same year resentment at such patents was vented in parliament. The starch monopoly was later acquired by Robert Cecil and Lord Buckhurst.<br>
<br>In June 1603 Pakington demonstrated his loyalty to the new king, providing James with lavish hospitality at his Aylesbury mansion. In the latter part of 1607 he became involved in his only recorded subversive act. He had been a member of the council in the marches in 1597, when he was in receipt of a sugar loaf for his pains. However, the council's continuing exercise of jurisdiction in four English marcher counties was said to involve many abuses and aroused growing opposition. In 1607 legal resistance began, led by the bishop of Hereford and twenty-six leading gentry. These included Pakington himself, a member of the commission of the peace and in that year the sheriff of Worcester, who refused to obey the precepts of the council in its role as a court. The dispute engaged the attention of the privy council and the lords chief justices.<br>
<br>Pakington's family was not a happy one. In February 1607 it was reported that &#145;Sir John Pakington and his little violent lady are parted on foul terms&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.243). The scandal caused concern at the highest levels, King James even writing to Archbishop Bancroft urging that the couple be pressed to compose their differences. At about the same time, Dorothy Pakington was involved in an acrimonious dispute with Sir Francis Bacon, into which she drew Robert Cecil. Bacon had married Alice Barnham, Lady Pakington's daughter from her previous marriage, and she charged him with forcing into marriage another of her daughters, aged twelve. Relations between husband and wife did not improve. On 21 June 1617 there were reported to have broken out &#145;great warres between Sir John and his lady&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.86), and hostilities continued in the court of high commission. The issue finally fell to the arbitration of the lord keeper, who, unluckily for Dorothy, was then her old enemy, Francis Bacon. His verdict went against her.<br>
<br>Sir John had fine properties with which to console himself for his familial strife. His main residence, which he erected early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, still stands on high ground in the middle of Westwood Park. It was a substantial house in his time, and four distinctively designed wings were added after his death. In 1618 Sir John Pakington received a licence to enclose 1000 acres at Westwood, Hampton Lovett, and surrounding parishes, and here he impaled two great parks, stocking one with red deer and the other with fallow. His enclosure met with some opposition from the burgesses of Droitwich, on account of rights of way which they had enjoyed over the manor of Westwood. Sir John Pakington died in January 1625 and was buried at Aylesbury.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_21144"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Pakington</span>, first baronet  (1600&#150;1624)<span class="occ"></span>, was the only son of Sir John Pakington and his wife, Dorothy. He was created a baronet in 1620 and sat in parliament for Aylesbury in 1623&#150;4. His marriage to Frances, daughter of Sir John Ferrers of Tamworth, brought them one son, the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21146/', "Sir John Pakington (1621&#150;1680)")</script>, and one daughter, Elizabeth, who married first Colonel Henry Washington and second Samuel Sandys of Ombersley in Worcestershire. Pakington died in October 1624 and was buried on 29 October at St Mary's, Aylesbury. His widow married Robert Leasly on 29 December 1626.<br>
