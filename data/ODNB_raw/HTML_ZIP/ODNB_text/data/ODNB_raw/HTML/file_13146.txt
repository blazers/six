<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hewett, Sir  William Nathan Wrighte</span>  (1834&#150;1888), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Dr William Wrighte Hewett, physician to William IV, was born at Brighton on 12 August 1834. He entered the navy in March 1847, and served as a midshipman in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852&#150;3. In 1854, while acting mate of the gun-vessel <i>Beagle</i>, he was attached to the naval brigade in the Crimea, and on 26 October was in command of a Lancaster gun in the battery before Sevastopol. A column of Russians threatened its flank, and hurried orders were sent to spike the gun and withdraw the men. Hewett boldly answered that he took no orders that did not come from Captain Lushington, the commander of the brigade; and, breaking down the side parapet of the battery, he slewed the gun round, and opened a terrible fire of grapeshot on the Russian column, then barely 300 yards distant. The effect in that part of the field was decisive. A few days later his gallant conduct at the battle of Inkerman (5 November) was reported by Captain Lushington, and he was immediately promoted lieutenant, with seniority of 26 October. He was also appointed to command the <i>Beagle</i>, in which he served during the war, especially in the operations against Kerch and in the Sea of Azov, and which he held after the peace until the summer of 1857. Hewett was one of the first recipients of the Victoria Cross, his conduct on 26 October and 5 November 1854 being equally named in the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> (24 February 1857). Hewett married, in 1857, Jane Emily, daughter of Mr T. Wood, consul for the Morea; they had two daughters and three sons, two of whom, William Warrington Hewett and Edward Matson Hewett, became lieutenants in the navy.<br>
<br>Hewett's rank had for all this time been only provisional; he then passed his examination at Portsmouth, and was appointed to the royal yacht, from which he was promoted commander on 13 September 1858. He then successively commanded the <i>Viper</i> on the west coast of Africa, and the <i>Rinaldo</i> on the North America and West Indies station. On 24 November 1862 he was made captain. He afterwards commanded the <i>Basilisk</i> on the China station, from 1865 to 1869; was flag captain to Sir Henry Kellett in the <i>Ocean</i> on the China station from 1870 to 1872; was captain of the <i>Devastation</i> from 1872 to 1873; and from October 1873 to October 1876 was commodore and commander-in-chief on the west coast of Africa, in charge of naval operations during the Second Anglo-Asante War (1873&#150;4), being present at Amoaful and the capture of Kumasi. He was made KCB on 31 March 1874. In time he was also KCSI, chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and a member of the order of the Mejidiye, and of the Abyssinian order of Solomon.<br>
<br>In May 1877 Hewett was appointed to the <i>Achilles</i>, and commanded her in the Mediterranean and the Sea of Marmora under Sir Geoffrey Hornby. He attained his flag on 21 March 1878, and in April 1882 was appointed commander-in-chief in the East Indies. During the Egyptian campaign of 1882 he conducted naval operations in the Red Sea, notably the occupation of Suez and the seizure of the canal in August. The war in eastern Sudan again called him to the Red Sea. After the rout of Valentine Baker Pasha's Egyptian force at al-Teb (4 February 1884) Hewett landed with a force of seamen and marines for the defence of Suakin, on 6 February 1884, and on 10 February was formally appointed governor by Valentine Baker, as representative of the khedive. On 29 February he was present, unofficially, it would seem, at the second battle of al-Teb. In April, accompanied by John Wylde, he went on a mission to King John of Abyssinia, whom, by judicious concessions on trade, he induced to sign a treaty of friendship, at Adowa (3 June 1884), and to agree to assist the evacuation of Egyptian garrisons in his neighbourhood, and more especially Kassala.<br>
<br>On 8 July 1884 Hewett became vice-admiral, and from March 1886 to April 1888 was in command of the Channel Fleet. He had been for some months in very delicate health, which became seriously worse after his retirement from his command; he was sent as a patient to Haslar Hospital, Gosport, where he died on 13 May 1888.<br>
