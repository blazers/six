<span class="headword">Tottell <span class="st"> [Tottel, Tothill]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1528, <em>d.</em> 1593), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was the third son of William Tothill, fishmonger and citizen of Exeter, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Matthew). Richard was one of eleven children, with seven sisters and three brothers, Geoffrey (<i>d</i>. 1574), who would later become recorder and MP for Exeter, John, and Robert. Their father was prosperous, becoming bailiff, sheriff, and eventually mayor of Exeter in 1552. The family name was written variously as Tathill, Tothill, Tottel, Tottell, Tottle, Tottyll, or Toutell; Richard referred to himself as Tothill but signed himself Tottyl.<br>
<br>Tottell served his apprenticeship successively with the printers William Middleton (<i>d</i>. 1547) and William Powell, who married Middleton's widow, Elizabeth, and he was admitted as a freeman of London and a member of the Stationers' Company on 19 January 1552. His career flourished from the outset. He seems to have been well connected with the London legal &eacute;lite and on 12 April 1553, a few months before Edward VI's death, he was granted the exclusive right to print for seven years &#145;almaner bokes of oure temporall lawe called the Common lawe&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR, Edward VI</span>, 5.47); in 1582 the city's remembrancer, Thomas Norton, claimed that Tottell had gained the privilege &#145;at [the] sute of the Judges&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 2.775). When Mary came to the throne in 1553, Tottell was able to benefit openly from the patronage of a clique of eminent lawyers hitherto in exile on the continent, among them William Rastell, Thomas More's nephew, and Tottell's patent for common-law books was renewed on 1 May 1556.<br>
<br>When the Stationers' Company was formally incorporated on 4 May 1557, Tottell was listed sixty-seventh out of the ninety-seven members named in the charter. A month later he printed the work with which he has since become most associated, a collection of early Tudor court poetry that included poems by Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, earl of Surrey; entitled <span class="italic">Songes and Sonettes</span>, it is better known today as &#145;Tottell's Miscellany&#146;. It was reprinted at least eight times before 1600 and it was one of seven titles whose rights of publication were yielded by Tottell to the company in 1584 for &#145;the reliefe of the poore of the saide Companie&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 2.786). The year 1557 also saw the publication by Tottell, John Cawood, and John Walley of the first English edition of the works of Thomas More, and the printing by Tottell of Surrey's translation of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, and Thomas Tusser's <span class="italic">A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie</span>.<br>
<br>On 12 January 1559, Tottell's common-law patent was renewed by Elizabeth for as long &#145;as he shall behave and demesne him selfe well in using of the said priviledge&#146;, effectively for life; his name also appears in her general coronation pardon dated three days later  (Byrom, 223). It seems to have been at about this time that he married Jane, or Johan (that is, Joan), the daughter of Richard Grafton, who had been the king's printer during the reign of Edward VI and whose <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> Tottell would later publish. A son, William, was born in 1560, who entered Middle Temple in 1576 with Richard Grafton the younger, and later became one of the six clerks in chancery; he married Catherine, the daughter of Sir John Denham. Tottell's other known children were Alice (who married Thomas Colthurst in 1582), James, Anne (who married William Pennyman in 1594), Judith, and Richard.<br>
<br>To the aggrievement of other less prosperous stationers who claimed in a 1577 petition that he sold law books &#145;at excessive prices, to the hinderance of a greate nomber of pore studentes&#146;, Tottell profited over the years by shrewdly taking advantage of his law-book monopoly, publishing <span class="italic">The Bookes of Yeares and Termes</span> and other innovative and improved educational legal texts such as an annotated <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>; in all he published over 100 items relating to the common law  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.111). In 1577 a dispute with the newly appointed queen's printer, Christopher Barker, over the publishing rights of abridgements of statutes was resolved by the Stationers' Company: Barker was &#145;to have but half the benefitt During his lief&#146; and all copies were to carry his imprint only  (ibid., 1.115). Barker's own report on printing privileges submitted to Lord Burghley in December 1582 claimed that &#145;the patent of the Common Lawe hath ben very beneficiall &hellip; but nowe it is of much lesse value then before&#146;: in other words, Barker felt that Tottell had effectively exploited it to the full  (ibid., 1.116). It was perhaps in response to this report that on 18 February 1583 Tottell took the precaution of retrospectively entering, at a cost of 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., at least fifty titles in the company's register, most having been printed under his patent, and some published many years before. As Christopher Knott argues, the increasing value of Tottell's patent meant that he was &#145;less willing to risk capital on other types of publishing&#146; as his career progressed  (Knott, 311). However, he did make unsuccessful attempts to gain patents for the printing of cosmographical books and tables, and for the domestic manufacture of paper which was at this time all imported; an earlier effort to set up a paper mill with other stationers had failed. In 1583 he was noted as having three printing presses although he &#145;useth but one&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.248). After 1587 he printed very little.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Tottell was a man of considerable substance, able to make sizeable financial contributions to the Stationers' Company and other official causes. In 1588 he was one of only two members of the company able to contribute &pound;100 towards a royal loan, in addition to &pound;30 he had already contributed through the company. He was also an important member of the company, rising swiftly through the corporate offices and serving as master in 1578&#150;9 and 1584&#150;5. In 1587&#150;8 he was noted as having joined with other wealthy stationers in promoting the passage of the 1586 decrees of Star Chamber for the regulation of printing, paying &pound;5 towards the company's costs.<br>
<br>For all of his career Tottell worked at the sign of the Hand and Star, formerly the premises of Henry Smith (<i>d</i>. 1550), located on the north side of Fleet Street, within Temple Bar and conveniently close to the inns of court and the law courts. In 1556 he bought two houses and three shops near the Hand and Star; in July of that same year Ellen Cowper was indicted for stealing &pound;3 from his house. From 1572 onwards he also began to acquire land piecemeal in Little Missenden and Amersham, Buckinghamshire, hoping to found a family estate. In July 1580 he leased a mansion house, Pury Place, in Harmondsworth, Middlesex, and in 1588 he retired to Wiston, Pembrokeshire. In September 1589 his absence from London led him to be formally discharged of his responsibilities as a member of the Stationers' Company's governing body but &#145;havinge bene alwayes a lovinge &amp; orderly brother in the cumpany, &amp; nowe absent [not] for any cause savinge his infyrmytie &amp; farr dwelling from the cyty&#146;, these were to be restored to him whenever he was in the city  (Greg and Boswell, 33). As late as 1591 he was still able to contribute towards a company assessment for the provisioning of royal ships. He died in Wiston, either in early July or on 1 September 1593, survived by his mother, his wife and six children, and a brother, John. The common-law patent passed to Charles Yetsweirt, to whose father, Nicasius, one of the clerks of the signet, a reversion had been granted in 1577. Tottell's son, William (1560&#150;1626), was the father of the puritan exemplar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107351/', "Joan Drake")</script>.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Tottell had benefited from friends on both sides of the Tudor religious divide and had proved himself both cautious and clever in politically unstable times. Probably a Roman Catholic, he chose to settle his affairs by means of a family settlement rather than will and testament, although this may merely have been because he preferred to keep his affairs private. An extremely prosperous &#145;new man&#146; of much influence in his day, he ultimately failed in his great venture to found a county dynasty, his hard-won estates eventually leaving the Tottell family through his granddaughter Joan's marriage into the Drake family. His legacy lies in his reputation and achievements as an innovative publisher.<br>
