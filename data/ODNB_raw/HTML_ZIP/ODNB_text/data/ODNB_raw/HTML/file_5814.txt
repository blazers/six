<span class="headword">Cogan,  William</span>  (1676/7&#150;1774), <span class="occ">apothecary and philanthropist</span>, was probably born in Kingston upon Hull, the son of John Cogan (<i>d</i>. in or before 1694), a merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of John Battie, of Warmsworth, and Mary Pierrepoint, of Wadworth. His parents were married on 3 June 1662 at Wroot, Lincolnshire, where Cogan's paternal grandfather, John Coggan, was rector from 1641 to 1684. On 4 September 1694 he was bound as an apprentice to a London apothecary named either John or Isaac Garnier, and in December 1706 he was admitted to the freedom of Hull by right of patrimony. He quickly became involved in town politics and was elected chamberlain in 1712, sheriff in 1714, and alderman in March 1717. In July he sat for the first time on the bench, and on 30 September 1717 he was chosen mayor.<br>
<br>Cogan did not make his mark in Hull until his second mayoralty, in 1736&#150;7, when he addressed the problem of the poor. A governor of the town workhouse since 1726, he ordered inspections of the hospitals and invested corporation funds in apprenticeships. He also sought to improve the streets and reduce shipping congestion on the Humber. Cogan's most significant legacy to the town was his foundation, in July 1753, of a charity school for girls, to be administered by three trustees: aldermen William Wilberforce and Samuel Watson and the recorder Cornelius Cayley. He endowed the charity with &pound;2000 stock in consols and his own house in Bowlalley to establish a school &#145;for teaching and cloathing twenty poor female children and fitting them for household servants&#146;  (Attwood, 319). Twenty girls of ten years and above would be admitted for three years and taught reading and the church catechism as well as domestic skills such as sewing, knitting, and washing. Uniforms of brown wool dresses, blue cloaks, and white straw bonnets, all with an orange trim, were provided for the girls. On leaving the school they would be given a <span class="roman">Bible</span> and 20<i>s</i>. to buy clothes to fit them out for service. Several years later Cogan invested a further &pound;500 in a trust that would give &pound;6 to each girl on her marriage; the interest would be used to buy religious books. The school opened in a newly built house in Salthouse Lane in 1755 under its first mistress, Anna Stevens, who was paid a salary of &pound;14. Cogan's school flourished into the nineteenth century and moved to larger premises in Park Street in 1889.<br>
<br>In his final years Cogan made provision for the town's boys: in a codicil to his will, dated 1 October 1772, he set aside &pound;2000 as a trust to fund apprenticeships for boys at the age of twelve. Cogan was a widower when he drew up his will, but nothing is known of his wife or whether they had any children. He died in the town in 1774 and was buried in the Quire Yard of Holy Trinity Church on 22 July; the burial register records that he was ninety-seven. His lasting contribution to educational provision is commemorated in the name of one of the town's schools, the Alderman Cogan Church of England primary school.<br>
