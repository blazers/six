<span class="headword">Brewer,  Cecil Claude</span>  (1871&#150;1918), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 12 December 1871 at 9 Endsleigh Street, Bloomsbury, London, the youngest child of Alfred Brewer, an upholsterer, and his wife, Anne Heal. He was educated at a private school in Elstree, Hertfordshire, and at Clifton College. In 1890 he was articled for three years to the London architect F. T. Baggallay. He also studied at the Architectural Association, of which he remained an active member, and at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1894 he joined the office of Robert Weir Schultz in Gray's Inn; it was perhaps through Schultz that he was introduced to a circle of architects around W. R. Lethaby who talked of architecture, in the language of the arts and crafts movement, as reasonable building. Much of Brewer's career was spent among these colleagues, and he admired Lethaby all his life. But his sense of what constituted reasonable building changed with time.<br>
<br>In the early 1890s Brewer was living at University Hall in Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, a settlement devoted to work among the poor. The <span class="occ">architect</span> <a name="cosubject_64090"></a><span class="headword">Arnold Dunbar Smith</span>  (1866&#150;1933), born in London on 2 December 1866, the son of Joseph Smith, a leather merchant, and Elizabeth Margaret Mason, was also a resident, and he too was studying at the Royal Academy. In 1895 he and Brewer won a limited competition for the design of a new building for the settlement in Tavistock Place, Bloomsbury. The Passmore Edwards Settlement (later Mary Ward House) was built in 1896&#150;7 in the inventive yet reticent vernacular style which Lethaby and others used for middle-class houses in the country. Applied here for the first time to a public building in London, it had a striking and appropriate freshness, the influence of which can be felt in the work of other young progressive architects in Britain, including Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Following this success Smith and Brewer went into practice together.<br>
<br>The two partners were very different. Brewer was electric, urbane, interested in ideas, a fragile figure with a permanently boyish face. He could work feverishly, but had a weak heart and was never far from physical collapse. Smith was shy, composed, and precise. Perhaps because of these differences, they could collaborate closely. Theirs was not a large practice, and for a dozen years or so their work consisted mainly of houses in the home counties and East Anglia. Thanks perhaps to their settlement connections, progressive intellectuals and social reformers figured rather largely among their clientele. In 1899, for instance, they built Heath Cottage, Oxshott, Surrey, for Bernard and Helen Bosanquet, and in 1907 a small house in Haslemere, Surrey, for Adelaide Anderson, the first head of the women's branch of the factory inspectorate. The houses themselves were designed after the model of English domestic architecture of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, as was usual then, but treated with a mixture of freedom and severity typical of the Lethaby circle. In some of them, small complex spaces were cleverly articulated with English classical details, as if Wren had been asked to fit out a ship's cabin.<br>
<br>On 25 May 1904 Brewer married Irene MacDonald (1857&#150;1939), a daughter of George MacDonald, the novelist. They were introduced by her cousin the architect Frank Troup, who was one of Brewer's Gray's Inn circle. They lived at first in Gray's Inn; when Smith and Brewer moved their office to 6 Queen Square, Bloomsbury, in 1914, the Brewers moved there too.<br>
<br>In 1910 Smith and Brewer won the competition for the design of the National Museum of Wales at Cathays Park in Cardiff. This complex, monumental classical building was a new departure for the practice. Reasonable building it might be, but not in the homely sense of the arts and crafts movement. A friend wrote of Brewer, &#145;in later years he inclined more and more to the larger view of architecture as a matter of fine planning, ordered massing and intellectual expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">Architectural Association Journal</span>, 34, 1918, 27). Such a view had been gaining ground in England since about 1905, inspired by French theory and American practice in the classical tradition. In 1911 Brewer went to the United States to study museum design. On his return the competition design was revised in the light of his admiration for American classical work, particularly the entrance hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the work of McKim, Mead, and White. The building of the museum was interrupted by the war, so that Brewer never saw the design carried out; the same was true of the firm's designs of 1914&#150;15 for extensions to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Brewer's last major work was the rebuilding and enlargement, in 1914&#150;16, of part of Heals furniture shop in Tottenham Court Road, London (Ambrose Heal, the furniture designer and manufacturer, was Brewer's cousin). A commercial, steel-framed building, it was as much a departure from their earlier work as the museum in Cardiff and, until it was unhappily extended by Sir Edward Maufe in 1937, its subtle, stripped classical fa&ccedil;ade was one of the best-proportioned and most expressive modern shop-fronts in London. Brewer was also a founder of the Design and Industries Association, set up in 1915 to bring good design to bear on industry as the Deutscher Werkbund had done in Germany, and as the arts and crafts movement in Britain had failed to do. Brewer was an enthusiast for Germany, and would pester his friends with preaching and photographs of the latest German work. In its early years the association was run from 6 Queen Square and he acted as joint secretary until 1918, despite failing health.<br>
<br>In March 1916 the doctors told Brewer that the condition of his heart was worsening, and from that date he and Irene spent more time at Town End Farm, Radnage, near Stokenchurch in Buckinghamshire. Though very much a Londoner, he took to the Chilterns. His invalid's couch was fitted with a drawing-board; in one of his last letters, he wrote &#145;I am designing, mostly in my head, a great church upon a hill&#146;  (Brewer to Hope Bagenal, 21 July 1918, RIBA). Cecil Brewer died at Town End Farm, Radnage, on 10 August 1918, aged forty-six, and was cremated at Golders Green on 14 August. The practice continued in his partner's hands until 1933. The National Museum of Wales was partly completed under Smith's supervision, and the designs for the Fitzwilliam Museum were carried out as the Marlay (1924) and Courtauld (1931) galleries. Smith designed other university buildings in Cambridge, and also in Newcastle. On 11 August 1911 he married Clara Ellen Dean (<i>d</i>. 1944), becoming stepfather to the folklorist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71534/', "Margaret Josephine Dean-Smith (1899&#150;1997)")</script>. He died on 7 December 1933 at his home, Pine Court, 4 Gervis Road, Bournemouth..<br>
