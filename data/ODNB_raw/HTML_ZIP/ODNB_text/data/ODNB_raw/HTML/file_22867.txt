<span class="headword">Pughe,  William  Owen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Idrison]</span>  (1759&#150;1835), <span class="occ">antiquary and lexicographer</span>, was born William Owen at Tyn-y-bryn in the parish of Llanfihangel-y-Pennant, Merioneth, on 7 August 1759. He was the son of John Owen (1712&#150;1800) of Rhiwywerfa, near Abergynolwyn, and his wife, Anne Owen (1733&#150;1811). His father was a skilled singer to the harp, and he thus acquired at an early age an interest in Welsh poetry, which was deepened by the study of <span class="italic">Gorchestion beirdd Cymru</span>, when that collection appeared in 1773. Some biographers claim that he received his education at Altrincham, Cheshire, but there is no definite proof to support this. In 1776 he went to live in London. About 1782 he made the acquaintance of Robert Hughes (Robin Ddu yr Ail o F&ocirc;n) and Owen Jones (Owain Myfyr), through whom he became in 1783 a member of the Gwyneddigion, a society of London Welshmen founded in 1770. Owen thereupon began to collect materials for a Welsh&#150;English dictionary. The first section appeared ten years later, on 27 June 1793. Its publication proceeded slowly until 1803, when it was completed and issued in two volumes, with a grammar prefixed to the first. It contained about 100,000 words, with English equivalents, and, in a large number of cases, illustrative quotations from early Welsh literature. Its erroneous etymology is based on the assumption that all Welsh words can be resolved into monosyllabic elements of abstract signification, a notion first put forward with regard to English and other languages by Rowland Jones in his <span class="italic">Philosophy of Words</span> (1769). An abridgement of Owen's dictionary appeared in 1806, a new edition (revised by the author) in 1832, and a further edition, extended by Robert John Pryse, in 1866.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in 1789 Owen, together with Owain Myfyr, edited the poetry of Dafydd ap Gwilym (reprinted 1873), adding in English a sketch of the life and writings of the poet. On 9 August 1790 he married Sarah Elizabeth Harper (1771&#150;1816), with whom he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20985/', "Aneurin Owen (1792&#150;1851)")</script>, and two daughters, Isabella and Ellen. Ellen later married John, the son of the antiquary Richard Fenton. In 1792 Owen published <span class="italic">The Heroic Elegies and other Pieces of Llywarc Hen</span>, with a translation and a prefatory sketch on bardism, probably written by Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg). Owen had become dissatisfied with the orthography of the Welsh language, and throughout this work uses &#145;&ccedil;&#146; for the sound usually written &#145;ch&#146;, and &#145;v&#146; for Welsh &#145;f&#146;. In his dictionary a third innovation appeared&#151;the use of &#145;z&#146; for &#145;dd&#146;. In 1800 Owen translated into Welsh <span class="italic">A Cardiganshire Landlord's Advice to his Tenants</span>, a treatise on agriculture, by Thomas Johnes of Hafoduchtryd. The next year saw the publication of a far more important work, the first volume of the <span class="italic">Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales</span>, an enterprise for which Owen, Owain Myfyr, and Iolo Morganwg were all nominally responsible, though the main literary work was probably done by Owen, while the cost (above &pound;1000 for the three volumes) was defrayed by Owain Myfyr. The first volume was an attempt to give from the manuscripts the text of all Welsh poetry to 1370 (excluding that of Dafydd ap Gwilym, already printed). The design of supplementing this with a selection of later poetry (general advertisement of 1 January 1801) was never carried out. Volume two, which also appeared in 1801, contains the text of the <span class="roman">Trioedd, the Brutiau</span>, and other prose documents of a historical nature; volume three (didactic literature, laws, and music) followed in 1807. The three were reprinted, with some additions, in one volume at Denbigh in 1870. Owen was the editor of the <span class="italic">Cambrian Register</span>, a periodical devoted to Welsh history and literature, of which three volumes appeared, in 1795, 1799, and 1818. In June 1805, together with Thomas Jones (Y Bardd Cloff), Owen started the <span class="italic">Greal</span>, a Welsh quarterly of a similar character, which was issued under the patronage of the Gwyneddigion and Cymreigyddion societies of London. Its orthographical peculiarities proved an obstacle to its success, and it was discontinued in June 1807. <span class="italic">Cadwedigaeth yr iaith Gymraeg</span>, a Welsh grammar published by Owen in 1808, was printed at London in the same orthography, but an edition in ordinary spelling also came from a Bala press. Owen's concise <span class="italic">Cambrian Biography</span> appeared in 1803.<br>
<br>About 1803 Owen became a follower of Joanna Southcott, the religious fanatic. He remained a member of her intimate circle and often acted as her amanuensis until her death in 1814. In 1806 he inherited an estate at Nantglyn, near Denbigh, from a distant relative, Rice Pughe, whereupon he assumed the surname of Pughe. During the rest of his life he spent much of his time in Wales, and his literary activity diminished. Pughe's wife died on 28 January 1816, and to divert his mind from the loss he undertook to translate <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> into Welsh. <span class="italic">Coll gwynfa</span> appeared in 1819: its ponderous and artificial diction made it unintelligible to the ordinary Welsh reader. Pughe was no doubt the anonymous translator of Dodsley's <span class="italic">Life of Man</span> (<span class="italic">Einioes dyn</span>, 1821). In 1822 he published a Welsh poem in three cantos about Hu Gadarn, and in the same year he issued a volume of translations from English, which included Gray's &#145;Bard&#146; and Heber's &#145;Palestine&#146;. Most of his poetry appeared under the pseudonym Idrison. During his later years Pughe was chiefly occupied in preparing an edition of the <span class="italic">Mabinogi</span>, the Welsh romances; but although the Cymmrodorion Society in 1831 voted &pound;50 for the publication of this work at Denbigh, it never appeared.<br>
<br>Pughe died of apoplexy on 3 June 1835 in a cottage near D&ocirc;l-y-cae, in the neighbourhood of his birthplace, where he had gone for the sake of his health, and was buried that month at Nantglyn. He had been elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1793, and on 19 June 1822 received from the University of Oxford the degree of DCL. Pughe's contribution to scholarship must be regarded as a product of its own age, and it was the Romanticism of that age which clouded his linguistic approach. Many of his idiosyncrasies remained in the Welsh orthography and vocabulary until the early years of the twentieth century, when Sir John Morris Jones did much to rid the language of his influence. However, Owen did lay the foundations for later scholars, and his dictionary shows a very profound knowledge of early Welsh texts. His main faults were his fanciful orthographical experiments and his lack of critical power.<br>
