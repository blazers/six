<span class="headword">Atkins,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1685, <em>d.</em> 1757), <span class="occ">naval surgeon</span>, the son of John and Grace Atkins, was baptized on 26 November 1685 at Plaistow, Essex. He served a professional apprenticeship before commencing a chequered naval career in March 1701 as surgeon's mate of the <i>Charles Galley</i>. He progressed to first mate of the <i>Somerset</i>, where he successfully treated head injuries and splinter and gunshot wounds sustained during Sir George Rooke's action off Malaga in 1704, and his captain found him diligent, respectful, sober, and worthy of better things.<br>
<br>As surgeon of the <i>Tartar</i> (1705&#150;10) Atkins saw action against the French in the channel and skilfully handled a severe penetrating gunshot wound of the chest. The bomb-ketch <i>Lion</i> took him as ship's surgeon to the Mediterranean (1710&#150;14), where he received forty casualties within an hour during the battle of Vaia Bay near Genoa in 1711; among these was his captain, Galfridus Walpole, brother of the future prime minister. Walpole sustained a severe compound fracture of the forearm; Atkins amputated the limb but felt it prudent to consult senior hospital ship colleagues on his post-operative management. The matter became a source of controversy which effectively ended his advancement. In 1715 he was awarded the diploma of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company and, as a master surgeon, was qualified to serve as surgeon of a second-rate ship. Instead he was offered the position of surgeon's mate of the sloop <i>Shark</i>; he declined the offer, for by then he was a shrewd, observant, and skilled surgeon. His readiness to challenge established ideas if his own experience dictated brought him into conflict with examiners who were slaves to tradition. On re-examination after a three-year break in service he qualified only as a second mate and was appointed to the storeship <i>Success</i>. He again declined and finally, on 16 March 1719, was appointed surgeon of the <i>Swallow</i>, which, with her tender, <i>Weymouth</i>, was dispatched to seize pirates operating on the African coast. At Cape Lopez 270 were captured with &pound;10,000 in gold dust and Atkins acted as registrar at their trial.<br>
<br>The voyage introduced him to tropical diseases and he was first to describe African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). He also described craw-craw, or river blindness (onchocerciasis), and Guinea-worm disease (dracontiasis). Atkins provided probably the first detailed description of cerebral malaria complicating a falciparum infection, which, because it lacked the periodicity of common forms of malaria and was unresponsive to quinine, puzzled him. His differential diagnosis included heat exhaustion and typhus, which, he perceptively noted, was associated with dirt, infestation, overcrowding, and inadequate ventilation. Because the pursers of both ships had died and <i>Weymouth</i> had lost more than her original complement, he was appointed purser of that ship for the homeward passage via Brazil and the West Indies; the hurricane he encountered at Port Royal, Jamaica, was one which he was to describe vividly in one of his books.<br>
<br>The ship was paid off at Woolwich in May 1723 and Atkins was subsequently superannuated, retiring to Plaistow to write his books, <span class="italic">The Navy Surgeon, or, Practical System of Surgery</span> (1732) and <span class="italic">A Voyage to Guinea, Brasil and the West Indies</span> (1735). Both ran to several editions; the 1742 edition of <span class="italic">The Navy Surgeon</span> was much enlarged and carried philosophical speculations based on an extensive knowledge of classical and contemporary writers and his own protestant convictions. He also provided a useful account of the examination, appointment, and equipment of naval surgeons, and irregularities practised by the companies of Barber&#150;Surgeons and Apothecaries. His surgical practice was influenced by Richard Wiseman and James Yonge, but he was an independent thinker who established principles of casualty management not fully appreciated until the twentieth century. They included methodical planning; sorting of casualties into three categories to allow the surgeon to deal rapidly and effectively with those requiring immediate surgery, priority to be given to the arrest of haemorrhage; scrupulous cleanliness; thorough debridement; and antisepsis. Believing that naval surgeons required continuing education, he proposed a naval medical school in Portsmouth naval academy.<br>
<br>Atkins also became concerned about the plight of black slaves and issued one of the earliest denunciations of the slave trade, which he had witnessed on the African coast. A passage in <span class="italic">A Voyage to Guinea</span> seems to imply that he had served in a slave ship himself. It would account for the gap in his naval service from 1715 to 1718, during his period of disillusionment. His natural curiosity led him to study fetishes and speculate upon the wider aspects of faith healing, and he discussed the various properties of mineral springs. A concern for the poor brought him to recognize that infirmaries funded by local subscriptions would always be inadequate and only a national health service provided by taxpayers could offer the requisite standards of professional care. His excursions into philosophy were less successful and tended to obfuscate rather than develop his ideas.<br>
<br>Atkins died, unmarried, at Plaistow, probably on 6 December 1757, aged seventy-two.<br>
