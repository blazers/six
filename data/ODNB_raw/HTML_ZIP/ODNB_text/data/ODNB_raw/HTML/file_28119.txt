<span class="headword">Vassall,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1625), <span class="occ">shipowner and colonial adventurer</span>, was of French descent; his family, probably Huguenots, originated from near Caen in Normandy. Little is known of his parents or early career, though he apparently acquired a reputation as a competent authority on maritime matters, and was consulted by the high court of admiralty in suits concerning wreck in 1577 and mariners' wages in 1597. His seafaring career probably included voyages into the Mediterranean, to Leghorn and Genoa, during the early 1580s. In 1588 he set out two vessels to serve in the Armada campaign, serving as captain of one of them, the <i>Samuel</i> (140 tons). In 1594 he was rewarded for building four ships in association with Thomas Barnes and Bartholomew Matthewson. He was a prominent member of the Trinity House of Deptford, serving as an elder brother during the early seventeenth century, when he was involved in a wide range of maritime business. In 1609 he joined the Virginia Company of London, with an adventure of &pound;25.<br>
<br>Vassall married three times. His first wife was Anne Howes, whom he married at the church of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, on 25 September 1569. Following her death he married Anna Russell (<i>d</i>. 1593), on 4 September 1580; their children included four sons and one daughter, among whom were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28120/', "Samuel Vassall (bap. 1586, d. 1667)")</script>, MP and Virginia merchant, and <a href="#cosubject_28122">William [<i>see below</i>]</a>. On 27 March 1594, after the death of his second wife, Vassall married Judith (<i>d</i>. 1629), widow of Thomas Scott of Colchester and London, and third daughter of Stephen Borough of Stepney, with whom he had four daughters and two sons. A prominent and respected member of the maritime community in London, Vassall acquired various landed interests in the City and in Essex, including the lease on the parsonage and rectory of Eastwood, where he lived for a while, becoming a friend and neighbour of Samuel Purchas. In his will of 29 April 1625 he made generous provision for his wife and his surviving children. He died at Stepney, and was buried in the parish church on 13 September 1625.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28122"></a><span class="headword">William Vassall</span>  (1592&#150;1655)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 27 August 1592 at Stepney, was the fourth son of John and Anna Vassall. Little evidence survives for his education or early career. On 9 June 1613 he married Anna, daughter of George King of Cold Norton, Essex, with whom he had five daughters and a son, John (<i>c</i>.1625&#150;1688). He was a leading figure in establishing the Massachusetts Bay Company during 1629, when he was selected as a member of council and assistant. In 1630 he and his family emigrated to the colony, leaving their home in Prittlewell, Essex, though they returned to England the following year, going back to Massachusetts in 1635. After a brief stay at Roxbury, however, Vassall moved to Scituate in Plymouth plantation, where he acquired land along the North River and soon became a prominent figure in the local community. In partnership with his brother Samuel he was very active commercially throughout the 1630s and 1640s. In 1642 he was chosen as one of the deputies for Scituate, and served on the council of war during a time of disturbed relations with the indigenous people.<br>
<br>By the early 1640s Vassall was embroiled in controversy with the colonial authorities concerning membership of the church. In 1646 he was involved in a petition to relax restrictions on admission to the church, though it was dismissed by Edward Johnson as the work of &#145;persons of a Linsiwolsie disposition, some for Prelacy, some for Presbytery, and some for Plebsbytery&#146;  (J. Franklin Jameson, ed., <span class="italic">Johnson's Wonder-Working Providence, 1628&#150;1651</span>, New York, 1910, 240). Vassall returned to London, where he tried to pursue his case with parliament. John Child's <span class="italic">New England's Jonas Cast up in London</span> (1647) was heavily influenced by him, but it had little impact. In 1648 he migrated to Barbados, acquiring an estate in St Michael's parish. Able and hard-working, he was soon prominent within the colonial community. In 1652 he was a commissioner of the highways. During 1655 he was appointed a commissioner for implementing the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>; he was also chosen to serve in the recently established prize office. He died in Barbados later in the year, with property in the colony and a huge estate in New England. He was buried in Barbados in 1655.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28121"></a><span class="headword">Spencer Thomas Vassall</span>  (1764&#150;1807), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, a direct descendant of William Vassall, was born on 7 April 1764 in Massachusetts, the second son of John Vassall (1738&#150;1797), merchant and planter, and his wife, Elizabeth Oliver (<i>d</i>. 1807). His parents returned to England as a result of the political and military conflict in North America, settling at Bristol and subsequently at Bath. Apparently Vassall was educated at a foreign academy before joining the 59th regiment of foot as an ensign, at the age of twelve. Thereafter he acquired extensive experience, serving in varying capacities and campaigns with the regiment. As a young lieutenant he earned renown during the siege of Gibraltar in 1782. He took part in two campaigns in Flanders during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he was allegedly nearly executed on suspicion of being a spy. He also served as a senior officer in Antigua. He purchased the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 38th regiment, which he took command of in 1801. Under his leadership it became known as &#145;the Crack Regiment in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir of &hellip; Lieutenant-Colonel Vassall</span>, 18). In 1806 he participated in the capture of the Cape of Good Hope, where he served briefly as commandant. During his years in the service he became respected for his professional abilities; apparently, he was highly regarded by Sir John Moore, with whom he was compared.<br>
<br>Vassall married Catherine Brandreth Backhouse, daughter of J. Evans, clergyman, on 30 June 1795. They had two sons and two daughters. His last campaign was with the ill-fated expedition to seize Buenos Aires in 1807. He was injured during the capture of Montevideo, on 3 February, and died from his wounds on 7 February 1807. Although his body was interred in the grand church of Montevideo, his remains were brought back to England and placed in a family vault in St Paul's, Bristol, to which a monument, designed by Flaxman, was added. He died leaving property in Britain and Jamaica to be held in trust for his widow and children.<br>
