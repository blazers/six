<span class="headword">Everdon,  Silvester  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1254), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Carlisle</span>, came from Everdon in Northamptonshire; his parentage is unknown, but he was related to the locally important family of Thrupp or Thorp. Instituted vicar of Everdon in 1219, by 1229 he was in the service of the chancellor, Ralph de Neville (<i>d</i>. 1244), and made his career in the chancery thereafter, his advance being marked by his presentation to a number of valuable livings, culminating in the archdeaconry of Chester in 1245. In 1242 he was entrusted with the custody of the exchequer seal, this being a temporary substitute for the great seal, which went to Gascony with Henry III, and in 1244 he became temporarily keeper of the great seal itself, though he was never formally appointed chancellor. In 1246 the seal was committed to him again. He was by this time increasingly active in court circles, in 1243 receiving a gift of robes from the king, and according to Matthew Paris coming to be regarded as &#145;the king's faithful clerk, dear and close, obtaining the first place in the chancery, where he served him wisely&#146;  (<span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, 2.322). Royal favour and personal piety&#151;in 1235 he appears to have gone on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela&#151;made him a natural candidate for a bishopric, and in 1246 he was elected bishop of Carlisle, but at first refused promotion, apparently because he had qualms about accepting high spiritual office in return for secular administrative work. He was persuaded to change his mind, probably by the king, who provided him with pontifical vestments; the temporalities were restored on 8 December 1246, and he was consecrated bishop on 13 October 1247.<br>
<br>Everdon proved an effective and conscientious diocesan, settling disputes, ensuring that vicars received proper stipends, and safeguarding the rights and property of the see of Carlisle, most notably by bringing to a satisfactory conclusion in 1249 the long-running dispute over their respective endowments between the bishops and the canons of Carlisle Cathedral priory. In 1251&#150;2 he returned to the king's service, acting as a justice itinerant at eyres for Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Warwickshire, and Leicestershire, though his role appears to have been primarily that of a figurehead, since he did not attend all the sessions, and was restricted in the exercise of his judicial functions by being forbidden to act in the absence of more experienced colleagues. In May 1253 he attended parliament at Westminster, and formed one of a delegation of bishops which asked Henry III to respect the liberties of the church, particularly over episcopal elections; Henry's response was to ridicule the petitioners by reminding them that they owed their own promotion to his influence, Everdon being derided as having been formerly <i>clericorum meorum clericulus</i> (&#145;the littlest of my clerks&#146;; Paris, 5.374). But he remained in the king's favour and service, and was on his way to court in March 1254 when he was thrown from his horse near Northampton, suffering injuries from which he died a few days later.<br>
