<span class="headword">Robins,  Thomas Ellis</span>, Baron Robins  (1884&#150;1962), <span class="occ">businessman and soldier</span>, was born on 31 October 1884 in Philadelphia, USA, the son of Major Robert P. Robins of the United States Army, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas de la Roche Ellis. He was educated privately and at the University of Pennsylvania. At the age of nineteen he became the first Rhodes scholar from Pennsylvania to go to Oxford University, where he was at Christ Church from 1904 to 1907. He read history, but failed to get a degree. He played cricket for the Bullingdon Club. He then spent two years in New York in journalism and became assistant editor of <span class="italic">Everybody's Magazine</span>. He returned to England in 1909 to be private secretary to one of his Oxford friends, the sixth Earl Winterton.<br>
<br>Robins married in 1912 Mary St Quintin (<i>d</i>. 1974), youngest daughter of Philip Wroughton MP and deputy lieutenant, of Woolley Park, Berkshire. They had two daughters. Also in 1912 he became a naturalized British subject and joined the City of London yeomanry, with which he was mobilized on the outbreak of war in August 1914. He served overseas in the Middle East, being twice mentioned in dispatches and appointed to the DSO. For two years after the armistice he was provost marshal in Egypt and Palestine. After demobilization, he became secretary of the Conservative Club in London (1921&#150;8). From 1925 to 1928 he commanded the City of London yeomanry battery of the Royal Horse Artillery, which in 1928 won the coveted King's cup.<br>
<br>Robins was invited in 1928 to join the British South Africa Company (chartered in 1889) as its general manager in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. He quickly made his mark with this powerful commercial company, the principal assets of which were the mineral rights in Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and ownership of the railways. On the death of Sir F. Drummond Chaplin he became resident director of the company in 1934.<br>
<br>Robins formed a close friendship with Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, chairman of the Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa, and of De Beers Consolidated Mines. He served on the board of directors of both of these companies. Other companies of which he was a director included Barclays Bank DCO, Union Corporation, African Explosives and Chemical Industries, Wankie colliery, Rhokana Corporation, and Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines. He was an original director, and later chairman, of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Airways; and chairman of its successor, Central African Airways.<br>
<br>Robins's characteristics were a devotion to duty, untiring energy, a readiness to accept the burdens of responsibility, and a willingness to serve the public interest in any field. His interests were much wider than the success of the company which he directed. A keen freemason, he was for twenty years district grand master of Rhodesia. He was commissioner for Boy Scouts in that country and held the Silver Wolf decoration. For his long and devoted leadership in ambulance work he was made knight of the order of St John of Jerusalem. For two decades he was chairman of the Southern Rhodesia Agricultural Society.<br>
<br>Soon after the outbreak of war in 1939 Robins joined east Africa command in Kenya, commanding from 1940 to 1943 the 1st battalion of the Rhodesia regiment. At the request of (Earl) Wavell he served on the general staff in India in 1943. He returned to Southern Rhodesia to be assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general of the Southern Rhodesia forces until the end of the war. For his war services he was knighted in 1946.<br>
<br>It was inevitable that Robins should be made chairman and principal organizer of the Central Africa Rhodes Centenary Exhibition held in Bulawayo in 1953, which was opened by Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother. He was an original trustee of the Rhodes&#150;Livingstone Institute and of the Rhodes National Gallery. Later he became president of the Royal African Society in London.<br>
<br>Besides his merits as an administrator Robins was a genial host. His home, June Hill, Avondale, Salisbury, Rhodesia, was for thirty years as much a centre of attraction as Government House, to which all Rhodesians flocked, as did all visitors to the country from overseas. He commanded respect, admiration, and the affection of a host of friends of all ages, as of those who served under him.<br>
<br>In 1957 he returned to London and succeeded Christopher Hely-Hutchinson as president of the British South Africa Company. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Robins, of Rhodesia and of Chelsea, in 1958.<br>
<br>As Cecil Rhodes wished, here was one of his scholars from overseas, imbued with the spirit of Oxford, who exemplified Christian virtues of truth, courage, and kindliness; and, to a marked degree, of leadership: a man &#145;sans peur et sans reproche&#146;. Robins died at his London home, 76 Sloane Street, Chelsea, on 21 July 1962.<br>
