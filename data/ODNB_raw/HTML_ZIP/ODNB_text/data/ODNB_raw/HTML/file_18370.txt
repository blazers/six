<span class="headword">Maule,  William  Ramsay</span>, first Baron Panmure  (1771&#150;1852), <span class="occ">aristocrat</span>, second son of George Ramsay, eighth earl of Dalhousie (<i>d</i>. 1787), and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew Glen, and niece and heir of James Glen of Longcroft, Stirlingshire, was born on 27 October 1771. His father's maternal uncle, William Maule, earl of Panmure of Forth, died unmarried in 1782, and left his property to the eighth earl of Dalhousie, with remainder to Dalhousie's second son, William. Dalhousie died in 1787, when William succeeded to the valuable Panmure estates and adopted the name of Maule. He was twice married: first, on 1 December 1794, to Patricia Heron (<i>d</i>. 1821), daughter of Gilbert Gordon of Halleaths; they had three sons and seven daughters. On learning of his dissolute activities in London, his wife left him and returned to her family in Ireland. When his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18365/', "Fox Maule (later eleventh earl of Dalhousie)")</script>, took his mother's part, Maule cut him off with only &pound;100 a year and never saw him again. Maule's second wife, whom he married on 4 June 1822, was Elizabeth Barton (<i>d</i>. 1867), daughter of John William Barton of Hospitalfield, Forfarshire; they had no children.<br>
<br>In 1788 Maule purchased a cornetcy in the 11th dragoons, and afterwards raised an independent company of foot, which was disbanded in 1791. He was MP for Forfar, in April&#150;May 1796, and in 1803&#150;31. He joined the Whig Club in 1798 and was a steady adherent of Fox, after whom his eldest son was named. He virtually never spoke in the Commons, but supported the whigs on most major divisions until 1813. He was a founder member of the Hampden Club and helped secure Joseph Hulme's election for Aberdeen burghs.<br>
<br>On 9 September 1831 Maule was raised to the peerage as Baron Panmure. As a young man he was one of the most dissipated and extravagant, even of the Scottish gentry of his younger days, and survived them, thanks to a constitution of extraordinary strength and a fortune of vast resources. He did not alter his manner or morals as he grew older, and scandalized Victorian observers. He was devoted to his friends so long as they remained complaisant, and violent and implacable to all who thwarted him. His uncontrollable temper eventually alienated him from nearly all his family in his latter years, yet he performed many unostentatious acts of charity. In politics he was a liberal, and his views were invariably humane; in private life he was an immovable despot. He died at Brechin Castle, Forfarshire, on 13 April 1852.<br>
