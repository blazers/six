<span class="headword">Anderson, Sir  Hugh Kerr</span>  (1865&#150;1928), <span class="occ">physiologist and university administrator</span>, was born at Frognal Park, Hampstead, on 6 July 1865. His great-grandfather was a surgeon in the Royal Navy; his grandfather was a doctor at Peterhead, who died young, leaving a family. The second son, James Anderson (1811&#150;1897), Hugh Anderson's father, set out in 1828 for London, where he joined and ultimately became senior partner in a shipping firm which was later incorporated into the Orient Steam Navigation Company. James Anderson married Eliza, daughter of Surgeon-General John Murray, and Hugh was the third son of their family of four sons and seven daughters.<br>
<br>After four years (1880&#150;84) at Harrow School, Anderson went in 1884 to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, with the Sayer scholarship in classics, but then turned to the study of natural science. He became a scholar of his college in 1886 and gained a first class in both parts of the natural sciences tripos. On taking his degree (1887) he might have entered his father's business, but he preferred a career in science, and proceeded to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London in 1889 in order to complete his medical qualification.<br>
<br>After taking the degree of MB in 1891, Anderson returned to Cambridge, to begin active scientific work. He married, in 1894, Jessie Mina (<i>b</i>. 1861/2), daughter of Surgeon-General Francis William Innes; with her he had one son and one daughter. He was appointed university lecturer in physiology, and elected a fellow of Gonville and Caius College in 1897. With John Newport Langley he was the author of some fifteen papers of major importance, and by himself of about six more. The joint papers dealt with the opening of the pupil of the eye under sympathetic stimulation, with the nerve supply of the lower viscera, and with other nerve-fibre problems. Langley was zealous that each fact and each conclusion drawn from it should be rigidly established, while Anderson brought to the partnership a philosophic outlook and considered each new fact in its relation to general biological principles. Though the technique of the authors was subsequently superseded, it yielded a succession of results which formed an established part of neurology. The principal paper of which Anderson was sole author dealt with the development in their later phases of nerve-cells and their fibres, and he showed that trophic nutrition and functional reaction were separable and largely independent. Other work began to press upon him and, although he continued to follow and to encourage biological research, he ceased to be an active contributor to scientific literature from about the year 1907, when he became a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Anderson's college and university having discovered his business ability, he became more and more immersed in administration. He was appointed a member of the medical board of the university and of the press syndicate in 1907, of the financial board in 1908, and of the council of the Senate in 1910, and so continued until his death, becoming chairman of the press in 1918. Anderson was engaged in teaching and lecturing, in a way that was very stimulating to the better students, until he was elected master of Gonville and Caius College in 1912. During the First World War he resumed lecturing in medicine, while doing much in his college for the comfort of the staff officers who then filled its buildings.<br>
<br>In 1919 Anderson was appointed a member of the royal commission on the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. That body reported in 1922, and when in 1923 two commissions, one for Oxford and one for Cambridge, were appointed to give statutory effect to the recommendations of the earlier body, Anderson was called upon to continue as a commissioner for Cambridge. He became a governor of Harrow in 1922 and was an original member of the committee of selection for the Commonwealth Fund fellowships (1925). In 1927 and 1928 he acted for the university in negotiations with the international education board of the Rockefeller Foundation with respect to their offer of buildings and endowment for the biological sciences and for a new university library. The Anderson Room in the new library commemorated this work.<br>
<br>Anderson was of a sensitive nature and often distrustful of his own powers. His strengths lay in the laboratory, in the study, and in the committee room; his influence came from the width of his outlook, from his capacity for amassing and assembling detailed information, and not least from his great gift of sympathy. In addition to his scientific qualities he had a strong artistic sense and a love of music. He was knighted in 1922. Anderson died in the Home Hospital, 16 Fitzroy Square, London, on 2 November 1928.<br>
