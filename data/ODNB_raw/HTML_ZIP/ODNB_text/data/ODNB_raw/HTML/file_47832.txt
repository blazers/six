<span class="headword">Knight,  Eric Mowbray</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Richard Hallas]</span>  (1897&#150;1943), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, was born on 10 April 1897 in Menston, near Leeds, the third of the four sons of Frederick Harrison Knight, a prosperous but profligate Quaker wholesale jeweller, and his wife, Hilda Marion Creasser (1876?&#150;1919?). The elder Knight disappeared in 1899, reputedly killed in the South African War but suspected of having absconded to Australia, leaving his family in penury. Hilda Knight secured a post as governess in a noble household in St Petersburg, remaining there for some years before emigrating to the United States, where she remarried. Eric was sent to live with relatives in Leeds and later in Skircoat Green. A pupil at the Bewerley Street School in Leeds until the age of thirteen, he had become a &#145;half-timer&#146; the previous year while working as a bobbin-setter in a worsted mill, and later worked in an engineering works, a glass-blowing factory, and a spinning mill. In 1912 the family was reunited in Philadelphia, but Knight soon left home to work in a lumber yard and carpet mill before attending the Cambridge (Massachusetts) Latin school and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School.<br>
<br>Shortly after marrying Dorothy Noyes Hall of Boston on 28 July 1917, Knight enlisted in Princess Patricia's Canadian light infantry, later seeing action as a signaller in Flanders and in France. After the war Knight, by now the father of three daughters, tried unsuccessfully to establish himself as a painter and as a journalist. In the 1920s he served as an artillery specialist with the US army reserve at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, subsequently settling in Philadelphia, where he found employment as a film critic on the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span> between 1928 and 1934. Estranged from his first wife by 1929, Knight married the writer and editor Jere Brylawski (1907&#150;1996) on 2 December 1932.<br>
<br>A six-month stint in Hollywood as a screenwriter whose scripts were never adopted left Knight with a distaste for the American film industry. The Knights then cultivated an alfalfa ranch in southern California before returning to the east, where they eventually bought and renovated Springhouse Farm, a ramshackle stone house attached to a working farm in Pleasant Valley, Pennsylvania. On the basis of a handful of published stories and an unimpressive first novel, <span class="italic">Invitation to Life</span> (1934), Knight resolved to devote himself fully to writing. His first short story had been published in 1930, and for the next twelve years his fiction appeared regularly in American magazines, especially the <span class="italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> and <span class="italic">Esquire</span>. Many of these stories were reminiscences of Yorkshire village life, usually laced with local dialect and frequently involving a whimsical character named Sam Small, the protagonist of his novella <span class="italic">The Flying Yorkshireman</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Knight's <span class="italic">Song on your Bugles</span> (1937) was a quasi-autobiographical proletarian novel recounting the struggles of a gifted young Yorkshireman to reconcile artistic fulfilment with working-class solidarity; though favourably reviewed, it was a commercial failure. The next year he published a contemporary thriller set in Los Angeles, <span class="italic">You Play the Black and the Red Comes Up</span>, under the pseudonym Richard Hallas. In 1938 the <span class="italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> commissioned Knight to report on industrial conditions in distressed areas of Yorkshire. His first-hand account, expressing outrage at the closing of mines and factories, also inspired his fourth novel, <span class="italic">The Happy Land</span> (1940), published in England as <span class="italic">Now we Pray for our Country</span>. In 1940 he agreed to expand a previously published short story into a juvenile novel, the enduringly popular <span class="italic">Lassie Come Home</span>, the story of a resourceful and loyal sheep dog. The original film, starring Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor (1943), was followed by six sequels, six television series, and was updated and remade in 1994.<br>
<br>Despite disenchantment with British industrial and diplomatic policies and his assimilation to American life, Knight responded to the advent of war as a patriotic Yorkshireman. His last and most successful novel, <span class="italic">This above All</span> (1941), acclaimed as one of the finest novels of the war, was both a realistic love story that transcended class boundaries and a debate about whether Britain, weakened by social stratification and deficient leadership, deserved to win. During the second half of 1941 <span class="italic">This above All</span> was the best-selling novel in America and was quickly adapted into a popular Hollywood film starring Tyrone Power and Joan Fontaine.<br>
<br>For the first time Knight achieved literary fame and financial security. He lectured extensively on behalf of the British war effort and was interviewed in the media. He travelled to England late in 1941 to report on conditions in wartime London, to broadcast about America to British audiences, and to collaborate with Paul Rotha on the documentary film <span class="italic">World of Plenty</span> for the Ministry of Information. Knight was commissioned in the American army after being recruited by Frank Capra to provide scripts for the military propaganda series <span class="italic">Why we Fight</span> and for <span class="italic">Know your Ally&#151;Britain</span>, among the most significant documentary films ever produced. In addition he wrote <span class="italic">A Short Guide to Great Britain</span>, an orientation manual distributed to American soldiers before embarkation.<br>
<br>Although Knight always regarded himself as a British expatriate, his accent retaining traces of his Yorkshire background, his personal and professional identity was increasingly American, and at the end of 1942 he became a citizen. On 15 January 1943 Knight, recently promoted to the rank of major in the army special services division, was killed when a transport plane on which he was travelling to Cairo crashed in the Surinam jungle. In 1944 he was posthumously awarded the Legion of Merit for his role in explaining the war to American soldiers. Although his only lasting monument is <span class="italic">Lassie Come Home</span>, its name immortalized as his never was, Knight merits recognition for his contribution to greater Anglo-American understanding.<br>
