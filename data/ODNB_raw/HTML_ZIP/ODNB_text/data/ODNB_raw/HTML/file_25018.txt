<span class="headword">Sedgwick,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1573), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic theologian</span>, seems to have been a member of the Sedgwick family of north Yorkshire and co. Durham. His university career began at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1530. Admitted a fellow of the college on 2 June 1531, he graduated MA in 1533, was ordained deacon in Lincoln on 22 December 1537, and graduated BTh in 1545. Sedgwick was one of the original fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, being nominated by Henry VIII in December 1546. In June 1550 he publicly disputed with Bucer in Cambridge on justification by faith, defending the orthodox Catholic position. He was instituted to the rectory of Erwarton, Suffolk, in 1552.<br>
<br>In the following year Stephen Gardiner, the new lord chancellor, recommended both Sedgwick and Andrew Perne for the mastership of Peterhouse, and both were nominated by the fellows, the bishop of Ely selecting Perne for the position. In 1554 Sedgwick graduated DTh and was elected Lady Margaret professor of divinity, holding the chair until 1558, and was one of the team of Cambridge theologians deputed to Oxford to dispute with Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley on the nature of the mass in April of that year. In Oxford he was incorporated DTh, and on his return to Cambridge was elected vice-master of Trinity. On 12 March 1556 he was instituted to the vicarage of Enfield, Middlesex, on the presentation of the master and fellows of his college, but resigned it later that year. On 30 May 1556 he was admitted to the rectory of Toft, Cambridgeshire. He was one of the commissioners for religion and the examination of heretical books, and took an active part in the visitation of the university by Cardinal Pole's delegates in 1556 and 1557.<br>
<br>In 1557 Sedgwick was appointed regius professor of divinity, and in 1558 was collated to the rectory of Stanhope, Durham, by Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall, and was instituted vicar of nearby Gainford on the presentation of the master and fellows of Trinity. On 21 September 1559 he appeared before Elizabeth's royal visitors at Bishop Auckland, co. Durham, where he refused to subscribe to the oath of supremacy. He was thereupon remanded under sureties for four days, and then deprived of his livings. In 1561 he was removed from his professorship and confined to within 10 miles of the town of Richmond, Yorkshire. In 1567 George Neville, master of the hospital at Well, bequeathed him &pound;4. After the northern uprising of 1569 Sedgwick was incarcerated in York Castle, where he died in 1573. Considered very learned by contemporaries (though with the reservation that he was not very wise), he left no known writings.<br>
