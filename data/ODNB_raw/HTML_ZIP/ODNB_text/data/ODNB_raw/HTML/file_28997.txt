<span class="headword">Welles,  Leo <span class="st"> [Lionel]</span></span>, sixth Baron Welles  (<em>c.</em>1406&#150;1461), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the eldest son of Eudo Welles and Maud, daughter of Ralph, Lord Greystoke. Eudo predeceased his father, the Lincolnshire baron John, Lord Welles, on whose death in 1421 Leo succeeded while still a minor. He had been married on 15 August 1417 at Methley, Yorkshire, to Joan (or Cecilia), daughter of Robert Waterton of Methley, trusted retainer both of John of Gaunt and of the Lancastrian kings, who was granted his custody on his grandfather's death in 1421. How much this marriage and the Waterton connection mattered to him is suggested by his choice, long after Joan's death, of the Waterton chapel in Methley church for his burial. Knighted in 1426, Leo Welles was granted seisin of his inheritance in 1427, summoned to parliament from 1432, and was a royal councillor from 1434. He went to France with the king in 1430 and with Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, to relieve Calais, in 1436. Essentially a Lincolnshire landowner Welles served as commissioner principally of sewers and of the peace for the three parts of Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. Appointed as lieutenant of Ireland for seven years from 1437, perhaps reluctantly, and actually resident there from 1438, he failed to control the contending factions and resigned prematurely in 1442. Welles was quite well endowed for a baron, with an income of &pound;604 in 1436, but he had only &pound;322 net, the balance supporting his mother, aunts, brother, son, and repayments of his grandfather's debts. Following Joan's death, which had occurred by 1447, his wedding in that year as third husband to Margaret Beauchamp, duchess of Somerset (<i>d</i>. 1482), gave him an interest in her two dowers and her Beauchamp of Bletsoe inheritance. It also married him into the royal family, and placed him on the fringes of the dominant court faction. From 1451 to 1455 he was at Calais as a lieutenant of his brother-in-law Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset, apparently continuing until possession was secured by Richard Neville, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1471), on 20 April 1456. Elected a Garter knight before 13 May 1457, he was allegedly captured by the Yorkists at Bloreheath and took the Lancastrian oath of allegiance in 1459. Having joined Margaret of Anjou in the north in 1461, he was with her at the battles of St Albans (17 February) and Towton (29 March), where he was killed, and was subsequently attainted.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28999"></a><span class="headword">Richard Welles</span>, seventh Baron Willoughby and seventh Baron Welles  (<em>c.</em>1428&#150;1470), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was Leo Welles's son with Joan Waterton and his heir. Richard Welles married by 9 January 1449 Joan, sole daughter and heir of the Lincolnshire baron Robert, Lord Willoughby, whom he succeeded in 1452. The Willoughby barony was worth &pound;1002 in 1436. Welles was knighted and first attended parliament in 1453, and was a royal councillor in 1454. With the expectation of the Welles and ultimately the Waterton of Methley inheritances he was destined to be the principal magnate in the Lincolnshire area. Like his father Richard Welles was with Queen Margaret in the north, and at St Albans and Towton in 1461, but he was allowed to make his peace with Edward IV, escaped attainder and was pardoned on 5 February 1462, and continued to attend parliament. Richard's first wife, Joan, was the daughter of Elizabeth Montagu, sister of Thomas, earl of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1428), and Richard and Joan Welles were therefore included in the Salisbury roll of arms, which was probably prepared for the funeral of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1460), at Bisham Priory (Berkshire) in 1463. He associated himself with the dominant Nevilles in the destruction of the northern Lancastrians in 1464, at the enthronement of Archbishop Neville, and through his second marriage in 1468 to the widowed Margery Ingelby, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Strangways, a family of important Neville retainers. He was rewarded by the grant of his father's chattels on 9 October 1464, of his Welles estates on 11 July 1465, and by the reversal of Leo Welles's attainder in 1467. However, he had to overturn previous grants to his stepmother, the duchess of Somerset, who had been admitted both to her dower and to a life estate in the principal Welles lands with remainder to her own son, his half-brother John Welles, which was cancelled only in 1468 on the king's command. Welles had thus painfully reunited his inheritances, but not his local pre-eminence, which was shared instead by the king's kinsman Humphrey Bourchier, Lord Cromwell, and his household knight Sir Thomas Burgh&#151;hence, perhaps, the marriage of Richard Welles's heir Sir Robert Welles to Elizabeth Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1470), heir of Lord Berners and niece of Lord Cromwell, and his feud with Burgh, which resulted after 2 February 1470 in the destruction of Burgh's house at Gainsborough. Although Welles was summoned to London by Edward IV to account, and pardoned, he was already in alliance with the earl of Warwick and duke of Clarence, on whose behalf the Lincolnshire rebellion was organized as part of a much larger uprising. Edward IV advanced in person to suppress it, discovered the Welles family's role, arrested and executed Richard at Stamford on 12 March 1470, the date of Robert's defeat at Losecote Field (Empingham), and executed Robert also on 19 March at Doncaster. Although both were attainted and Robert died childless, their lands were diverted to the loyal Richard Hastings, Lord Welles, husband of Richard Welles's daughter Joan (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1474).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28997"></a><span class="headword">John Welles</span>, Viscount Welles  (<em>d.</em> 1499), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son of Leo, sixth Baron Welles and his second wife, Margaret Beauchamp, duchess of Somerset. As the younger son of both parents, he had no hereditary expectations. During the 1460s his mother sought to divert the Welles inheritance to him, and, but for the attainders, he would have succeeded <i>c</i>.1474 to the Welles barony. His pardon in 1478 as of Bletsoe, Bedfordshire, and Maxey, Lincolnshire, both properties of the duchess, suggests that he depended on his mother until her death in 1482. Apparently in the royal household at Edward IV's death, he was commissioned to victual the fleet sent against Sir Edward Woodville, but was already in rebellion against Richard III by 13 August 1483, when his property was seized. Knighted and recognized as Lord Welles by Henry Tudor on his landing at Milford Haven on 7 August 1485, he fought at Bosworth, and by February 1486 had been restored to his inheritance, created Viscount Welles, and elected knight of the Garter. Such favours recognized his special status as the king's uncle, half-brother to the king's mother, Margaret Beaufort, a connection which was reinforced by his marriage as &#145;a safe man&#146; to the queen's eldest surviving sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4984/', "Cecily (1469&#150;1507)")</script>. Hence he was appointed in 1485 constable of Bolingbroke, Lincolnshire, constable, steward, and master forester of Rockingham, and JP in six counties. In 1488 he was granted several forfeitures and in 1490 the castles of Caerleon and Usk for life. He served in France in 1492 and in 1496 treated with Burgundy. Such limited activity and moderate rewards indicate that he was never politically of the front rank. He had two daughters by 1493, Anne and Elizabeth, whom he planned to marry to the Stanley heir, but both predeceased him. At his death in London on 9 February 1499 the Welles inheritance devolved on the children of his four half-sisters.<br>
